Although the artwork is rather stylized, one can still see that the artist has been thorough on his research of the event for the sake of accuracy. A popular myth is that EMI's VLCV Spirit of Adventure was at the time engaged on the skirmishes at Benford on Elon. We see her here deploying her compliment of combat craft as it actually happened. Also note that the Spirit is portrayed sporting her dorsal mounted TS-75B Long Range Charged Plasma Cannons which common wisdom maintains where not available for Cosmo class carriers at the time (technically they where not as they where still in the experimental phase when this event took place but many sources have demonstrated that the vessel was in fact fitted with the equipment as the company saw the confrontation as an opportunity to test the new technology on the field). I'm satisfied to see that the artist has honored Combat Operator First Class Gilberto Schweizzer in his venerable number 5 MSF-28 Lancer, a rather brave undertake given the controversy surrounding the actions of this historic character. Very nice work. Thank you for sharing."

StarshipPorn,3cboyk,CuriousBlueAbra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:17:25 2015 UTC,"The lack of atmosphere doesn't automatically make a cube the best choice. It just means that aerodynamics can be ignored; the rest of the ship's components will still determine the overall shape. Engines need a thrust structure, radiators need lots of space, nuclear reactors need to be far away from the crew, the habitat may need to spin, etc. Different components will dictate different basic designs - some are tubes, some are umbrellas, most are sticks with fins.  Also, when it comes to high-powered spacecraft, like torchships, a sphere is one of the worst possible shapes. Not only would it put the crew right next to the probably-radioactive engines, it would severely limit heat dissipation since a sphere has the lowest possible surface-area-to-volume ratio."

The way they pitch it, and the way the few people who drop hundreds or thousands for the giant ships view it, is that the money is a pledge towards making the game, and as a reward for the pledge you will receive the ship right away when the game launches, instead of having to acquire it by in-game means later. This is how SC makes the money they need for development, they aren't funded by a larger studio or publisher."

StarshipPorn,3ajaj7,hett,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:51:41 2015 UTC,"They're also designed to somehow maintain altitude within an environment that has both atmosphere and gravity...when air intake becomes a necessary part of the propulsion and lift process...   They have antigravity technology, man. Repulsorlifts. X-wings magically lift off and hover over the floor of the Yavin hangar without any VTOL engines or spinning turbines or anything of the sort.  If anything, they are probably something like ram scoops as /u/lt_daaaan mentioned earlier. These are the same things as the red glowing things at the forward end of a Star Trek ship's engine nacelles. They collect interstellar hydrogen and compress it until a fusion reaction occurs which is used to propel the ship."

StarshipPorn,3ae1yq,Iamadinocopter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"You're assuming it would be traveling at high relativistic speeds in Einsteinian space. That would be bad, yes, potentially for the ship, but even more so, for the crew. No one wants to come home to family and friends who are elderly or dead, with their mission having slipped into history.  The painting depicts the ship emerging from some sort of ""hyperspace"" (pretty common in Berkey's work). It makes sense that that's where they would be conducting their high velocity travel.  Fake future science is so fun. :)"
StarshipPorn,3ae1yq,golgol12,2,Fri Jun 19 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"I think that it would be just the opposite. The sensors would be in the hull, to protect from damage from micrometeorites, radiation, etc."

I bought it when it came out in 1978 and still remember it as one of the worst books I've ever read Star Trek or otherwise. I'm just glad it at least it has the redeeming quality of eventually resulting in the Chris Moore painting.
StarshipPorn,3a1ffj,MungoBaobab,2,Tue Jun 16 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"one of the worst books I've ever read Star Trek or otherwise.   Oh man, that's really saying something. I actually bought a copy of the original along with the James Blish novelizations because I want to display the cover art, but I was interested in reading it. Thanks for saving me the trouble!   I also picked up a copy of ""Enterprise: The First Adventure"" by Vonda N. McIntyre.  I'm not a fan of the reboot films, to say the least, and I wanted to see how it ""really"" happened.   Well. According to this novel, the first mission of the Enterprise under Kirk's command is to fly a unicorn around from starbase to starbase on a sort of USO tour. Well, not a unicorn, but a pegasus. That's what their first mission is. A unicorn.   I stopped reading."

It's like everything that's wrong with a bad third season episode, but worse.  On the positive side, I do remember that James Blish's Spock Must Die! was actually a pretty good book.  Pickings were slim back in those dark days of Star Trek limbo, so I still read most everything, just to get some sort of fix. It was hit and miss, but some other good stuff turned up the the Trek fanzine / Best of Trek books.  I experienced an upside to so much of it sucking so seriously, though. It forced me to branch out into other science fiction.  I was especially thrilled when I discovered Larry Niven's Known Space stories."

StarshipPorn,39ay6i,ExdigguserPies,14,Wed Jun 10 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"What about the fact that when it crashed the sheer weight of the structure and energy of the impact would have created a wreckage spread over miles, not an intact ship. Unless it was more of a controlled landing."
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,wlievens,3,Wed Jun 10 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"It was probably a controlled emergency landing, since the thing seems very intact - other than being overgrown. If it crashed it would have probably obliterated everything in a wide radius."
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,roninjedi,8,Thu Jun 11 10:32:50 2015 UTC,"You would think that but its like a lot of the military or civillian ships that sit abandoned now. Its to costly, its easier to get the materials from the ground or an asteroid than it is to take apart the ship, separate everything, melt it down, and reforge it."
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,tman916x,10,Wed Jun 10 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"Reuse, reduce, recycle you Bantha fodder."
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,Chris-P,2,Wed Jun 10 19:27:26 2015 UTC,Dunno why you got downvoted for this. Can you give an example of something abandoned like that? Other than ones at the bottom of the sea (which are obviously just difficult to get to) I haven't heard of that.
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,DocCalculus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:38:32 2015 UTC,"4,000 planes for starters.  EDIT: Nevermind. Mothballed. Bad example."
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,alfonsoelsabio,4,Wed Jun 10 22:50:56 2015 UTC,"Nice! I'm thinking New Republic member planet Naboo, circa 12 ABY.  That ship was either part of a failed invasion, or a not-so-lucky element of an Imperial defense fleet retreating from NRDF liberators.  Those N-1s are woefully out-of-date, of course, so I bet either they're training ships, civilian air patrol, or just a low-priority district and/or squadron."
StarshipPorn,39ay6i,stug_life,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:26:46 2015 UTC,In Star Wars: Either you're right or the Noobians haven't upgraded their military much for some reason (restrictions by the empire? Lack of populous support? ).  IRL: they just look damn pretty.

StarshipPorn,39bdt7,Chris-P,7,Wed Jun 10 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the bridge like that, having a huge window that doubles as a computer screen, but... I expect in practice those bright white lights would kinda mess up any translucency the window would have and just turn the whole thing into a giant mirror instead."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,Randolpho,5,Wed Jun 10 17:55:15 2015 UTC,Not the mention the blindingly obvious weak spot. One single well aimed photon torpedo and the the entire senior crew's dead.
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,Randolpho,8,Wed Jun 10 19:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I assume it's transparent aluminum and not, you know, glass, but good point."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,halcyoncmdr,8,Wed Jun 10 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, a photon torpedo could be used to blow a hole in the bridge hull of any other Star Trek ship design. That's why they have shields."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,squidfartz,3,Wed Jun 10 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah but shields, especially as early as TOS-era, were pretty weak. You could drain the shield strength quickly with your energy weapons and then fire a single torpedo into the bridge.  The problem is they decided to merge the bridge with the ops room but went with the exposed design of bridges instead of the buried-inside-the-ship-and-well-protected design of ops rooms. If I'm not mistaken, at least some of the other factions go with the protected bridge designs but most Federation ships have this crucial weakness."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,metaldawg1,9,Wed Jun 10 19:47:06 2015 UTC,Could it potentially be a deliberate design choice on the part of starfleet to make them look less like warships?
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,I_Should_Go_N7,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Few of the Starfleet designs look like they're really designed for conflict, it's definitely one of the design considerations. The Defiant obviously is meant to be a small, fast, maneuverable ship compared to the sleek and elegant design of the Constitution or Galaxy classes for instance."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,I_Should_Go_N7,3,Thu Jun 11 06:29:46 2015 UTC,Transparent aluminum?
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,AdmSanctum,4,Wed Jun 10 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"That's the ticket, laddie."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,karmakeeper1,3,Thu Jun 11 14:40:04 2015 UTC,If you look closely you can see the track for a blast shield.
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,I_Should_Go_N7,3,Wed Jun 10 20:26:14 2015 UTC,Weapons that can easily penetrate the hull can surely blow a large hole on the bridge even if it doesn't have a glass window.
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,AdmSanctum,3,Wed Jun 10 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. Just pointing out there is a blast shield.  Like in Generations when the Duras sisters said, ""Target their bridge.""  I got excited to see how that was to play out.   Only time I can remember a bridge being taken out was on an Excelsior Class Starship during The Dominion Wars."
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,I_Should_Go_N7,2,Wed Jun 10 21:54:51 2015 UTC,Enterprise had a huge hole blown in the bridge in ST: Nemesis
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,K7Avenger,3,Thu Jun 11 04:48:14 2015 UTC,Enterprise got it's bridge carved out in Enterprise during the episode where Archer had the temporal brain tumors causing an alternate timeline.

StarshipPorn,39bdt7,Chemical_Castration,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:52:00 2015 UTC,Why do you think it would be a weak spot?
StarshipPorn,39bdt7,mistermasterdude,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:17:44 2015 UTC,"It's not too much of a weak spot but having the bridge so close to the hull plating is a securoty risk. Moderately light damage can cause a hull breach, vent the bridge into the space, kill the senior crew and cripple the command structure. If the bridge was located in the middle of the ship, you'd need much heavier and concentrated damae to do the same thing."

StarshipPorn,390t5f,TheEpicEdge,5,Mon Jun 8 18:52:15 2015 UTC,just downloaded this movie. Was told i have to watch it. Any opinions?
StarshipPorn,390t5f,F00TY,14,Mon Jun 8 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"really great movie overall, visually beautiful, with great soundtrack (you'll probably recognize the main theme since it's been since reused/reworked by john murphy in other movies). the plot takes a weird turn halfway through. i know a lot of people were pissed about it, but it's still very enjoyable...just changes the focus a bit (trying not to spoil)."
StarshipPorn,390t5f,UTLRev1312,4,Mon Jun 8 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"Basically this. The ending tends to polarize people, but if you're into cool sci-fi space-exploration stuff, it's definitely worth watching."

StarshipPorn,38weve,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:07:53 2015 UTC,"Clearly you've never watched GunBuster. The ships move so fast between FTL jumps that they experience turbulence in space. Also they take relativity into account big time. It's used to make a timeskip in the 3rd episode not only make sense, but also not feel off-pace.  Both series are only 6 episodes long, by the way.

Don't watch the linked trailers unless you want to be given the entire plot beforehand  Sci-Fi films with starships:   Starship Troopers 1, 3 and Invasion Event Horizon (Horror movie in space - this one gave me nightmares as a kid) Alien 1-4 (awesome movies) The fifth element (brain off, action/humor on) Sunshine (enjoyable, great music, cool concept - ignoring the omg the suns goin'out) Cargo (very great low budget sci-fi movie) Moon (very great low budget sci-fi movie) Ultramarines Star Wars (duh) Space Battleship Yamato (live action) [The Chronicles of Riddick)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCrDo3eCXkw) (okay only a little spaceships) Prometheus (very beautiful film, both in audio and video, for those that manage to enjoy its plot) Love (haven't seen it jet, another low budget sci-fi movie) Gravity (a feast for the eyes and ears) Elysium District 9 Edge of Tomorrow (I enjoyed this movie immensely because I didn't know anything about the plot - don't watch the trailer unless you want to be spoiled about the entire plot) Gattaca (there's rockets :P) Apollo 18 (same format as cloverfield - if you can't stand the first person/camera format then it's probably not for you) Europa Report Forward unto Dawn (live action Halo flic)   Sci-Fi Series with starships:   BSG Reimagined oh my god the space battles are so pretty Stargate SG1 /Atlantis (funny, cool action, though doesn't take itself seriously) Stargate Universe (gritty/dark similar to BSG) Star Trek TNG/Voyager/DS9/Enterprise (either you can stand the techno-babble or you can't :P) Planetes (great sci-fi anime series about debris haulers in LEO) Firefly (space cowboys - awesome series in my opinion - unfinished plot) Farscape (silly sci-fi action/comedy - same characters as the last SG1 seasons) Defying Gravity (first manned mission to visit several planets in one go, very cool execution, albeit cancelled after one season) Andromeda (Hercules in space - no firefight without fireworks - very cheesy at times :P)   Sci-Fi Shorts:   Atropa Forever After Tether Wanderers"

I did really like the design of the bugs, and of the Rodger Young.

StarshipPorn,364ctr,Womec,9,Sat May 16 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"Silicon Valley killed it.   It just occured to me...why didn't we have large scale commercialization of space already? And I had a strange answer:  The microchip and the fiber optic cable.  One of the few killer apps for space satellites was the communications satellite. But the microchip allowed multiplexing many voice streams onto a single high bandwidth signal, and the fiber optic cable made cheap long range high bandwidth communications possible.  What might have happened if the microchip and fiber optic cable weren't developed for another few decades? We might actually have needed hordes of communications satellites to keep up with global demand. That means a solid customer base for launchers, and that means mass produced launchers and/or big dumb boosters.  Without the microchip, these communications satellites suck up all sorts of juice. Thus, there's a huge incentive to develop efficient solar cells. With advanced space rated solar cells and cheaper launch technology, space based power may even be practical.  The result? Large scale industrialization of space, and sufficient economies of scale that launch costs are relatively cheap.   Isaac Kuo"

Captain Honrea of the Imperial Star Destroyer Benevolence negotiated a rebel surrender and 90 percent of the insurgent forces lived out the rest of thier prison terms on the resort rehabilitation penal colony on Kessel.

StarshipPorn,35ylfd,DeathsEmbassy,14,Thu May 14 21:42:21 2015 UTC,How did the Frigate launch fighters that are just now catching up to it?
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,Pendaelose,6,Thu May 14 17:28:41 2015 UTC,"It may have launched right before the hyperspace jump, then jumped moments before them while they were still warming up their drives."
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,Boonaki,15,Thu May 14 17:31:16 2015 UTC,OK then; another problem I'm having is - There's no room for Fighters in a Nebulon-class Frigate.
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,Pendaelose,14,Thu May 14 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"That image is too tiny to see.  It depends on where you are pulling your specs from though.  In the old (used to be canon) X-Wing and Tie-Fighter games a Nebulon B could carry a squadron or two.  One of the issues with a franchise as supermassive as star wars is that the ""official tech manual"" has been written and rewritten hundreds of times by different sources and many of them blatantly do not agree on many of the specifics."
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,ual002,3,Thu May 14 17:46:08 2015 UTC,"Basing it off the closing shot of TESB, you may be able to fit a Wing of fighters."
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,ual002,5,Thu May 14 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"It also depends on how they are housed.  There's plenty of room in the vertical design to stack fighters if only a couple are on the flight deck at once.  It would slow down how quickly you can launch, but it would vastly increase your capacity.     Like this, but for fighters."
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,Pendaelose,6,Thu May 14 18:02:21 2015 UTC,Nothing would really stop them from launching consecutively from a platform like that. Just think of it as vertical launch tubes from Battlestar.
StarshipPorn,35ylfd,Pendaelose,2,Thu May 14 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"you could launch consecutively, but not concurrently.  It could still be very feasible, but not as fast as launching them all at once.   In BSG every fighter on standby has it's own tube.  If they had to fire in series from the same tube it would slow things down a lot."

StarshipPorn,35ylfd,Lucretiel,2,Fri May 15 13:49:24 2015 UTC,"A wing is 72.  That's a bit much. Id say if we average, films, novels and games, we could estimate somewhere between 1 - 2 flights or 4-8 Starfighters depending on if they use floor space or have tightly packed racks.  And being that a lot of rebs are former TIE pilots, I bet the rack system would be common carryover.  Additionally, I think this would help explain the ratio of fighters to non-cal-cruiser type rebel cap ships seen in many artist renditions and games."

Obama signed the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 on October 11, which shelved the program, with Constellation contracts remaining in place until Congress would act to overturn the previous mandate.

StarshipPorn,357tay,rap31264,3,Fri May 8 04:52:39 2015 UTC,"In-universe technobabble will usually say the ship is designed around the shape of its warp field (example), and for some reason streamlined shapes are preferable to bulky ones. IRL, this was the design philosophy:   ""In my approach to Star Trek I wanted to be as practical as possible,"" Jefferies says. ""I could tell Gene was serious enough, but I really didn't know where to start. I knew the Enterprise was going to be on the cutting edge of the future, but essentially he gave me the job of finding a shape, and I didn't know what the shape looked like."" Although Roddenberry knew a lot about his ship, he had never visualized it, and consequently made the situation more complicated since he couldn't give Jefferies a detailed sense of direction. According to Jefferies, Roddenberry was absolutely clear to avoid any resemblance to a 1960's rocket ship. ""Gene described the 100-150 man crew, outer space, fantastic, unheard-of speed, and that we didn't have to worry about gravity. He had emphasized that there were to be no fins, no wings, no smoke trails, no flames, no rocket.    Source   Since then, every Federation starship design has just been endless variations on the basic disk-with-nacelles idea because it's become so iconic."

StarshipPorn,33izd7,BigBassBone,20,Wed Apr 22 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"That's no vessel, that's a space station.  A quick check on Wookieepedia suggests that the Vengeance Class and Executor Class were the longest used by the Empire, at 19km. While the Eclipse Class is shorter though (at a mere 17.5km), it is far more massive/bulky, with the other two being relatively flat.  To put them in context, the Death Stars are generally put as being between 120km and 160km across. They make the Star Destroyers look pretty tiny."
StarshipPorn,33izd7,TheGrumbleduke,8,Wed Apr 22 23:49:43 2015 UTC,"That's no vessel, that's a space station.   True enough, but the Death Star is capable of both sublight and hyperspace travel, so where is the line drawn?"
StarshipPorn,33izd7,BigBassBone,7,Wed Apr 22 23:58:39 2015 UTC,"Well yes - but I was going more for the quote. The Wookieepedia pages even note that the various Super Star Destroyers could be classed as space stations. Is a station something that is stationary, or something on which other things are stationed?  Hmmm..."
StarshipPorn,33izd7,TheGrumbleduke,3,Thu Apr 23 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"Well you can take ""station"" to refer to a base of operations like you mentioned (i.e. where things are stationed). Whether it's moving around or not, these things have legions of troops, squadrons of fighter pilots and all the equipment they need. The fact that they're heavily armed warships in their own rights is icing on that cake. The Super Star Destroyer is basically the aircraft carrier brought to its natural conclusion in space: a mobile military facility that can deposit troops, fighters and support craft wherever they're needed and give them the services they need in between assignments."

StarshipPorn,33izd7,Meior,4,Thu Apr 23 03:36:11 2015 UTC,"Plus the gravity would draw things towards the middle, rather than down. And it would still be pretty weak.  Let's run some numbers for the Death Star I;   120km in diameter => 905,000 km3 in volume, density of steel (from Wikipedia), 7,750 and 8,050 kg/m3, so let's go with 8 x 1012 kg/km3, estimated maximum mass assuming entirely filled of steel; 7 x 1018 kg acceleration due to gravity at the surface = Gm/r2 = 0.1 m/s2   So even on the outside, the gravity would be about a hundredth of what it is on the surface of the Earth, unless there was some super-dense material in there.

StarshipPorn,32tzrl,manualLurking,3,Fri Apr 17 14:43:11 2015 UTC,Could it be because the fighter crashed recently?
StarshipPorn,32tzrl,172n,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:39:42 2015 UTC,very possible. This all makes me so intrigued damn!
StarshipPorn,32tzrl,manualLurking,-1,Fri Apr 17 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"While this scene looks amazing, I feel like this is blatantly copying his Star Trek film where Kirk drives past the construction yards in Iowa where the Enterprise is being built.  As both a Star Trek fan and Star Wars fan this is kind of disappointing."
StarshipPorn,32tzrl,Ragefield,10,Fri Apr 17 09:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can find many examples from before that film of people driving past large spaceships on ground level. If one image being sort-of similar is enough to make you disappointed, you must not like a lot of films."
StarshipPorn,32tzrl,Chris-P,-5,Fri Apr 17 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"Considering they're made by the exact same person, a person who has stated that he loves Star Wars and knew little of Star Trek, and the films releasing six years apart, yes I am disappointed.  It feels lazy and as if he's re-using that shot in a manner that says, ""This is what I really wanted to make!""  The shot itself, as I said, is amazing but it would have been more powerful had it not been in the wake of his work and statements of the last 6 years."
StarshipPorn,32tzrl,Ragefield,7,Fri Apr 17 10:47:05 2015 UTC,Every James Cameron film has shots of people running through dimly-lit smoky industrial environments. So what? Aliens is still fucking awesome. Terminator 2 is still fucking awesome. The existence of similarities between films with similar themes made by the same director is pretty unavoidable really. It just comes across like you're looking for things to be disappointed by.
StarshipPorn,32tzrl,Chris-P,-7,Fri Apr 17 10:53:35 2015 UTC,"Now you're reading into things as if I'm attacking it.  He re-used a scene that he very recently used, almost shot for shot just going in the opposite direction, in a desert, with destruction instead of construction.  It's pretty but not awe inducing any more.  And if you're going to talk about themes, the themes of Star Trek and Star Wars are worlds apart both figuratively and literally except for when Abrams is involved.  Terminator 2 and Alien have similar themes in different settings, the same can not be said for Star Wars and Star Trek."

StarshipPorn,32ucqd,awful_at_internet,2,Thu Apr 16 21:51:24 2015 UTC,Star Wars Battlefront: Battle of jakku (free) DLC will likely tell this story.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,BruteForceFTW,-1,Fri Apr 17 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen theories that that's not just an Executor, but the Executor, and the ""desert planet"" is what remains of Endor. the Death Star was pretty goddamn huge; debris like that raining out of the sky could have catastrophic effects on a planetoid's climate. So I think it's at least a plausible theory."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,anothergaijin,13,Fri Apr 17 00:28:34 2015 UTC,Executor got blown to high hell when it collided with the Death Star II
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Colink101,2,Fri Apr 17 02:17:54 2015 UTC,Which one? The Force Unleashed talks about there being 2 ships named Executor - both were built in secret at the same time which disguised the fact there was two of them being built.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,anothergaijin,3,Fri Apr 17 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"The Lusankya [EU, no longer canon :( ] was what became of the second one, it was a prison under the Imeprial Center before it was taken by the new republic. It then broke free killing millions and escaping."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,SiS-Shadowman,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"It then broke free killing millions and escaping.   Which I'd really, really love to see animated  The general idea of building two huge ships in secret at the same time is pretty awesome. If they were to make a wink to the EU stories, little things like this would be the way to do it."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,BruteForceFTW,2,Sat Apr 18 03:14:41 2015 UTC,"It did. However in the (no longer canon) EU, the executor wasn't vaporized and cashed on Endor:   What was left of the Executor's wreckage came to settle in a large canyon on the Forest Moon of Endor. Three days after the Battle of Endor, Rogue Squadron X-wing pilots Wedge Antilles, Wister, and Kirst inadvertently stumbled upon the wreckage while pursuing TIE fighters during subsequent cleanup operations, only to find many of the Super Star Destroyer's turbolasers very much in functioning order. Remaining Imperial horses in command of the Executor showered the three Rebel fighters with laser fire as soon as they entered the canyon, destroying Wister's X-wing, before Antilles and Kirst escaped.[147]   Who knows which ship this is - maybe it's the Lusankya?"
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,SiS-Shadowman,3,Fri Apr 17 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"Shit man, the Lusankya is even less canon than the Executor crashing on a desert Endor."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,BruteForceFTW,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:27:23 2015 UTC,That may be so. But the thought of lysankya rising from coruscant is awesome as hell 😏
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:34:19 2015 UTC,True. The EU had a lot of cool shit in it.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,4,Sat Apr 18 13:38:27 2015 UTC,The only problem is that Executor did a head long into the Death Star.  There wouldn't be that much of the superstructure left.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Tuskin38,0,Fri Apr 17 08:09:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, all we can see is the rear of it. Which is the part that would have been most likely to survive a head-on collision."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,thekdude,2,Fri Apr 17 09:08:42 2015 UTC,"Even so, the explosion that took out the Death Star should have been sufficient enough to turn any part of Executor that survived the collision into unrecognizable scrap."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Fri Apr 17 09:46:43 2015 UTC,The rear of the ship would have already been moving away from the Death Star II for quite some time.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,InconsiderateBastard,2,Fri Apr 17 18:13:58 2015 UTC,The TFA panel at celebration confirmed it is a new planet called Jakku
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yea but the rebels used tractor beams to pull the falling debris away, so Endor should still be fine"
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,cRaZyDaVe23,4,Fri Apr 17 14:02:28 2015 UTC,Always figured the Executor was... bigger.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,3,Fri Apr 17 09:09:03 2015 UTC,They were very thin looking on edge.  But the length was pretty crazy.  The front of the ship is probably like 18 kilometers away from the engine that the ships enter.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,cRaZyDaVe23,2,Fri Apr 17 19:16:14 2015 UTC,"Those are presumably the main engines, but relative to the Falcon they look like they're the same diameter as a regular Star Destroyer's, which seems incorrect to me. I mean, I'll accept that my gut is wrong in this case, I'm just a little disappointed that they aren't way bigger in every direction."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,2,Fri Apr 17 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, the SSDs didn't have gigantic blue burning engines, they had a bunch of slightly smaller(ish) red burning engines...(at least nine with a few slightly larger but still red ones...)"
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,cRaZyDaVe23,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:26:47 2015 UTC,They were still supposed to be WAY bigger than regular Star Destroyers. There's no way that the largest engines weren't almost as big across as a regular Star Destroyer's entire trio of main engines.
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:29:27 2015 UTC,I think you're probably right...
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,cRaZyDaVe23,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:33:54 2015 UTC,"Probably. I'll take some numbers over my ""feelings"" any day, though. However, I've always felt that the canon size of THE Super Star Destroyer in the movies was inconsistent. Plus there's the whole thing with the Eclipse and Sovereign class SSD's being the same length as the Executor class in some media, but between twice and fifteen times larger in other stuff. Some people say that there were variances in size between individual units, which is more believable, but it's a retcon at best.   Honestly though, the super huge ships are the things I love Star Wars for. I was heartbroken when I found out that the Death Star wasn't really planet-sized, or even moon-sized. It was big, but it was hardly a celestial body."
StarshipPorn,32ucqd,Tuskin38,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:39:34 2015 UTC,"I can see that,  those very inconsistencies were why I said I remembered ish whatever I said...(If I'm not about to look up comparative sd sizes, I'm definitely not hitting a link or my back icon!)  And yes, learning the true sizes of the death stars did kinda suck, but it's not like the Empire or the Republic were building full on dyson spheres or anything..."

StarshipPorn,32tyxa,BruteForceFTW,10,Fri Apr 17 02:09:29 2015 UTC,"I mean realistically it's a massed produced vehicle numbering in the millions. They have tons of factories built specifically for making this ship and its spare parts, and all the techs are trained in its repairs and 30 years later you want the whole fleet changed?  That's a real tall order."
StarshipPorn,32tyxa,locopyro13,2,Fri Apr 17 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible. Episode 3 and 4 were only 19 years apart.  I didn't really mean anything by it, I've just been fearful of these new movies being nothing more than a massive circle-jerk over the Original Trilogy."
StarshipPorn,32tyxa,BruteForceFTW,5,Fri Apr 17 04:49:04 2015 UTC,"True, but remember, the changes between 3 and 4 were based on a military that had gone from a theoretical force used by a government with limited warfighting experience to a seasoned core of battle hardened troops and commanders. Which also explains the rapid changes between Episodes 2 and 3, they built a military force around old wars and theories, then changed it with actual experience, as well as a changing enemy. Once they had the formula down, there was little reason to change things drastically.   Look at the equipment fielded by real world militaries; the US has used the M16 rifle with very few changes since 1962. The AK-74M in Russia is basically the same design that was adopted 2 years after the end of WWII in the AK-47. Almost all US fighter aircraft were introduced in the 70's or early 80's. That's 30 years. The M1 Abrams, still the MBT of the US and still one of the most powerful and advanced armoured vehicles on the planet was first used in 1980, 35 years ago."

I feel that most horror flicks just try to push certain barriers as if to say, ""Yeah, look what we did!"" Event Horizon was relatively calm and it let your imagination take hold. It has a solid story, and it crosses the sci-fi barrier. I loved the implication that Hell was an actual place, and not just some supernatural realm.   I really want to see the prequel of the original crew. It would be so fucking disturbing."
StarshipPorn,323n4d,Jynx2501,8,Fri Apr 10 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"Totally with you. So much love for that movie. I love the crew, the actual science fiction elements, and then just the full on onslaught gore eye-rape scenes. You're totally right about the concept of hell. It's a fear that so many of us grew up with, and I gotta admit that it got under my skin big time.  I always think about when they finally watch the recovered footage of the first crew, then the captain turns it off and immediately says ""...We're leaving..."" Just that alone, I feel like is more rational than 99% of characters in horror movies.   That was just so funny to me for some reason, that they'd have a character actually be like ""Wow, fuck this ship we're getting the fuck out of dodge,"" instead of ""Well let's investigate and put our crew in mortal danger that will unfold in a totally predictable way."""
StarshipPorn,323n4d,jugzluvsrad,3,Fri Apr 10 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"So freaking true. hahaha.  Friday the 13th: ""Whats in that cabin?!?!""  Event Horizon: ""Nope!"""

I feel that most horror flicks just try to push certain barriers as if to say, ""Yeah, look what we did!""   See, it's funny you say that, because Anderson actually wanted a lot more gore. You know those brief glimpses of the crews getting tortured (and/or having a BDSM orgy, which may or may not be torture depending on your inclination) in Hell? Well, they actually filmed a lot more of that, and it was pretty gruesome. The studio told Anderson to cut most of it. Sadly (or not, depending on your feelings about it), we'll never get an extended cut or anything, because the film stock that wasn't used in the theatrical cut was destroyed.  Here's a 200% NSFW glimpse. (As you may recognize, many of these shots were in the theatrical cut, but only for a split-second.)"
StarshipPorn,323n4d,Triplanetary,3,Sat Apr 11 05:18:14 2015 UTC,"YEah, I saw these photos once upon a time. I'd probably still like the film if it had Anderson's true vision, but i really like the simplicity of the theatrical release."

Yay, good times! And then the plot unfolded... a horror movie that you don't know going in is going to be a horror movie is about 10x scarier. Brrr."
StarshipPorn,323n4d,testudoaubreii,5,Fri Apr 10 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't get to watch it back in the day but I've heard the same thing again and again.

It definitely got under my skin even when I watched it the first time at 22."

StarshipPorn,31tcxs,MrTotoro1,4,Wed Apr 8 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm probably in the minority with this but I think the prequel clones (especially phase II in Episode III) looked waaaay more badass than the stormtroopers. Not only that, but they acted way more professionally than them. More army-like."
StarshipPorn,31tcxs,TheNargrath,4,Wed Apr 8 20:15:48 2015 UTC,"So with you on that. It's like they took the classic Imp vibe and made it cleaner, more awesome. I'm not dissing the orginals, but they nailed the clone armor and vehicles, in my opinion. Especially the scouts. Goddamn, but those scout troopers on Kashyyyk were so cool."
StarshipPorn,31tcxs,MrTotoro1,3,Wed Apr 8 21:31:56 2015 UTC,Exactly! Dear god the Kashyyyk scouts are the shit! I can't help but feel like everything was downgraded in the old movies. Not that it wasn't awesome to begin with but when they made the prequels they made everything much more awesome (designwise of course). One thing that bugs me is that they are wearing the normal white armor on Endor in Ep. VI. Who thought that was a good idea?? That's just a stupid illogical thing to do. Ep. III on Kashyyyk was when they realised how dumb it was not to give them camouflage armor. They made the same mistake in Ep. II on Geonosis too though.   /rant

StarshipPorn,31tija,tedfa,3,Thu Apr 9 18:50:15 2015 UTC,Supposedly it uses turbo-electric jets (electric ducted fans) in the atmosphere and then it's chemical-plasma thrusters (an unclear hybrid of a chemical-electric thruster) to get it to orbit. It has a micro fusion reactor to power these energy intensive engines.
StarshipPorn,31tija,CrazyIvan101,3,Sat Apr 11 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Would be a good design. If you used nuclear power to heat up air you wouldn't need to use fuel in atmosphere. You could fly for how ever long the nuke kept hot. Years, decades, etc etc."

StarshipPorn,31ks77,bbqwoa,5,Mon Apr 6 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"If they were so concerned about conserving fuel, why weren't the landing and takeoff of the Ranger more rigorous? They just float down to the surface and back up again."

StarshipPorn,31ks77,Xeonith,7,Mon Apr 6 07:37:16 2015 UTC,Isn't that exactly what they did in millers planet?
StarshipPorn,31ks77,reste,19,Mon Apr 6 09:08:21 2015 UTC,"My theory is that it was to avoid the blight. We see in the film that the blight is an airborne microorganism which destroys a variety of crops and ruins the atmosphere of the Earth for human habitation. Exactly the sort of thing you'd want to avoid introducing to a new colony world. Had they launched the Ranger as a SSTO the outside may have been contaminated while climbing. We know there are lots of microorganisms which can survive and remain viable in space, even through reentry, so it's a real threat.  Instead they sterilize the Ranger (and cargo/crew) in a clean room then launch it inside a fairing on a Saturn V-esque rocket. We don't actually see the fairing (this is a theory after all) but nothing contradicts it. We don't see the Ranger from the outside until the edge of the atmosphere, we don't see it separate from the rocket, and the views and light seen during launch could be via windows in the fairing lined up with the windows on the Ranger (like the Launch Escape System of the Orion in the real world).  That, or Nolan wanted us to have Apollo feels."

I'd say they were carrying a ton of fuel up with them as well, since SSTOs would be very thirsty things, but they never showed any extra tanks or anything being delivered with them to Endurance. I guess at the very least, they were able to make it up there with a full tank of gas in the plane.  The other thing might be that the all the planets they were expecting to visit had significantly less gravity than Earth, but iirc they mention those figures in the movie and that's not the case."

Mila Kunis was secretly a space princess who stood to inherent a bunch of shit, and the people who currently own that shit don't want that to happen. Was it the part about genetic reincarnation?

The worldbuilding was detailed and interesting, and vastly too complex to fit into a single film. Instead what we got was one film where every scene was packed with largely-nonsensical exposition and throwaway elements that are never adequately explained, all the while failing to get across anything but the simplest parts of a simple plot because there was too much else going on.  The pacing in particular was just awful, and the writing suffered immensely from having to be packed down so tightly. They clearly made a lot of sacrifices to try to fit so much of the world into a single film - it would be interesting to see which parts were left on the cutting room floor - but it's a shame that they prioritised meaningless and contextless spectacle over an interesting story."

StarshipPorn,301wds,testudoaubreii,38,Tue Mar 31 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"Seems a lot more representative of a generic sci-fi spacecraft of that era.  Certainly not the stand-out unique design of the final craft. The semi-flying saucer, asymmetrical design is quite iconic.  Even the Corellian Corvette that was ultimately based on this design is more unique to Star Wars than this prototype.  Not much of this prototype design even looks ""Star Wars"" even though the general shape clearly influenced the Corvette design. The biggest element is the cockpit of the Falcon which is very much a take on the cockpit of this design."
StarshipPorn,301wds,The_Dirty_Carl,20,Mon Mar 23 21:53:52 2015 UTC,It also looked to much like the ship from space 1999.
StarshipPorn,301wds,moogoo2,3,Mon Mar 23 23:07:17 2015 UTC,That was my thought as well.
StarshipPorn,301wds,The_Dirty_Carl,16,Tue Mar 24 13:24:05 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, many of the first concepts for the Falcon were similar in design.  Long bodies with rear-mounted engines and a forward bridge/cockpit.  The legend goes that the final design came from Ralph McQuarrie going out to lunch and seeing a burger with an olive next to it.  Or so the legend goes."
StarshipPorn,301wds,The_Dirty_Carl,3,Mon Mar 23 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"This isn't a design for the Falcon, it's a design for the Tantive IV.  I'm blind, carry on."
StarshipPorn,301wds,TheHYPO,6,Mon Mar 23 23:50:56 2015 UTC,"The scale is a little small for the large passenger ship that the Tantive is supposed to be.  There isn't room in this thing for a shootout between two crowds of soldiers.    Plus you can see elements that the script calls for the Falcon to have.  There are some of those red cargo pods missing, replaced by scorch marks.  Clearly they were jettisoned at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.  It also has opposing sets of swiveling guns, perfect for the TIE fighter shootout scene after the Death Star escape."
StarshipPorn,301wds,TheHYPO,2,Tue Mar 24 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going off of what OP said.  I'm inclined to believe them, because it shares key structures and shapes with the Correlian Corvette.  The hourglass overall shape, the escape pod section is shaped like the final ship, the escape pods themselves are necessary in the script, the opposing turrets also present in the corvette.  OP could be wrong, of course, but it's easy to see how this ship could evolve into the corvette."
StarshipPorn,301wds,TheHYPO,3,Tue Mar 24 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"The book that discusses it is currently in storage, otherwise I'd cite page numbers.  It's a table book put out by Industrial Light and Magic documenting the history of their models.  They very unequivocally state that the original designs of the Falcon came from designs like that.  Oh, wait, here's the page in question, from wookiepedia."
StarshipPorn,301wds,TheHYPO,2,Tue Mar 24 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"Ah jeez, I feel stupid.  I just read the part of the title that I could see in my RSS feed, which didn't include ""Early concept model for the Millennium Falcon"".  I skipped straight to the comment about the Correlian Corvette after looking at the picture."
StarshipPorn,301wds,Jynx2501,2,Tue Mar 24 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, it's somewhat interesting they went through all the trouble of building a concept model (assuming this is original, and not some fan's later creation), as I would have thought most of the concepts would have simply been done on paper (like the page you just posted) and only the near-final designs would have the time and cost put into building (and painting)..."
StarshipPorn,301wds,Fiend1138,2,Tue Mar 24 13:34:16 2015 UTC,"They actually did that a lot.  You'll notice that the detail of that model as opposed to the detail of the model ised for shooting is drastically less.  It's a proof-of-concept, something done kind of fast so that the director can walk around it and make professional ""hmmm"" noises at it.  If that had ended up as the final design, there would be a lot more detail added.  Panel lines, bolts, dents, scrapes, paint chips, rust, blaster damage, all the unique stuff that now makes the Falcon instantly recognizable."
StarshipPorn,301wds,feor1300,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"No doubt the detail is less, but they still went through the effort even to paint the thing. Again, I don't know how preliminary or close to final this design was, but it just surprised me they'd make a model that detailed (guns are silver, seats in the cockpit are brown and other cockpit elements are painted, red pods, a decal, some fairly detailed widgets used for equipment/tech all over), and something as big as it looks like this is (not sure, but it looks to be at least 2 feet long) as a simple proof of concept demo...  For proof of concept, I would have expected something at a detail level more like this http://imgur.com/8hX9U3J  Not doubting you or anything, I'm just impressed."
StarshipPorn,301wds,OldClunkyRobot,3,Tue Mar 24 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"Remember, this was done in the mid 70s.  Computer graphics were non-existent, it was almost entirely practical effects.  Now compare that model with the intense level of detail on the actual Falcon.  Scrapes, carbon scoring, dents, holes.  Blaster damage and exhaust residue.  Blacked blaster tips.  Hundreds and hundreds of hours were put into the final models used in shooting, the model I linked probably had 50 hours into it.  And when you consider that this is how it was done back then, PLUS the shots they made were revolutionary, it makes sense that they took extra time on their concepts in order to get the best possible image."
StarshipPorn,301wds,alkonium,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"As I said, no doubt the detail is less, but given a sketch with enough detail, and a basic model to show the shape in 3d, I'd have thought that would be enough detail for a director to get the picture. I have no concept of how much time or effort would have gone into a model of that size/quality, but I would imagine this took days (maybe a week or two?) of work to build. I could be wrong though."
StarshipPorn,301wds,Vundal,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"Good catch on the jettisoned cargo pods (though those could have arguably be jettisoned Tantive IV escape pods, but I have read previously that Tantive IV was based on a rejected Falcon design).  Am I correct in my belief that the actual Falcon does not have any similar sign of the ""jettisoned cargo"" and that presumably it was just cargo held in some internal bay that was dumped loose into space?"

StarshipPorn,2zwd77,theswerto,2,Sun Mar 22 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"First thing I thought about  It's actually the name of a greek goddess. Many Gallente ships are named after greek gods, like the Phobos Heavy Interdiction Cruiser, Deimos Heavy Assault Cruiser, Oneiros Logistics Ship, Proteus Strategic Cruiser, Kronos Marauder, Hyperion Battleship or Erebus Titan."
StarshipPorn,2zwd77,Jonthrei,2,Sun Mar 22 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"[pedant]  Hyperion was a Titan. Proteus and Erebus were primordial deities, older than the Titans and the Olympians. Kronos is weird, and is referring either to Chronos (the primordial personification of time) or Cronus (a Titan). Phobos and Deimos are Olympians and fit the title ""gods"" well. They were totally dicks though. Oneiros was not an individual, but rather the name given to all the sons of Nyx, a primordial entity.  [/pedant]  But yeah the Gallente name almost everything after Greek mythology, basically."
StarshipPorn,2zwd77,jtr99,5,Mon Mar 23 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"During this years Eve Fanfest, CCP revealed 2 new ships of the new tactical destroyer class: The Gallente 'Hecate' and Caldari 'Jackdaw'.   The Amarr 'Confessor' was released in December and the Minmatar 'Svipul' in February. The Jackdaw will be the next released tactical destroyer and the Hecate will be the last.     (Copy and paste from a different thread)  In Eve, Subcapital combat ships come in 5 classes (Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, Battlecruiser, Battleship).   They are then divided into Tech 1, Tech 2 and Tech 3 models.  Tech 1 are your ""basic"" ships. Tech 2 are more advanced (due to lore reasons, tl;dr: better interfaces between the mind of the pilot and the ship), more expensive and more specialized.  Tech 3 ships use materials scavanged from ""sleepers"", a faction split up from the Jove, which are the most advanced race in the game. The sleeper materials can be split and mended again without structural drawbacks.   The first T3 ships were the 4 strategic cruisers: Legion, Tengu, Loki, Proteus. (1 per empire). Those strategic cruisers consist of a ""core"" and 5 subsystems (Defensive, Offensive, Propulsion, Engineering, Electronics). Those subsystems can be swapped out for others. For example you can use an ""Interdiction nullifier"" propulsion system and ""Covert reconfiguration"" offensive module to  get into enemy systems without being caught, then swap them out for more combat focussed subsystems and go hunting behind enemy lines.  The new line of T3 ships, called tactical destroyers, use sleeper materials for a different effect. During battle, they can change their layout to an offensive, defensive or speed configuration.   You can already fly 2 of those ships, the Amarr ""Confessor"" and Minmatar ""Svipul"".     With a price of ~45 mil ISK, the Svipul and Confessor are more expensive then other Destroyers, Friagtes or even T1 Cruisers. But, due to the flexibility in combat and the abillity to ""punch above its weight"", the currently released T3 destroyers are used by many capsuleers in Solo PVP, PVE and small gang warfare. The Hecate and Jackdaw will probably offer some more choices for players.      Here are some more pictures (Jackdaw, Hecate and early stage concepts)  Edit: And here is a picture of the inside of an Amarr 'Confessor' Tactical Destroyer, provided by CCP and created during Eve fanfest."

The Citadel was well done, I thought, but everything else just seemed... weirdly shaped. The closest to being normal looking were the Quarian ships, and we hardly saw any of them. That kinda makes sense, though. The aliens would naturally have alien ideas about aesthetics. I just think it's weird that human ships look almost as alien."

Can't be the glowy light, that's not the longest part of the ship. Does the gun point up?   It looks cool but I don't think it matches the in-game lore very well."

StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,Game-On,9,Sat Mar 21 00:36:34 2015 UTC,My personal favourite will probably always be the Ent-refit/Ent-A but the Ent-E is one sleek looking ship. My only minor gripe with the design is the lack of a neck between the between the primary and secondary hull. As part of the Enterprise lineage I always felt like it should have had one.
StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,iamanooj,2,Sat Mar 21 00:53:02 2015 UTC,"NX-01 refit ftw, imo."
StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,murderofcrows90,6,Sat Mar 21 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"No way! Blowing up that ship made NO sense. The threat was over, the enemy was defeated and it was like the writers said, now what? Uh, how about we blow up the ship?"
StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,philkensebben18-1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:25:17 2015 UTC,I heard that the sets didn't work well for movies.
StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,vmos,3,Sat Mar 21 08:33:38 2015 UTC,that would be strange seeing as they were originally built for a movie
StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,Triplanetary,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:47:26 2015 UTC,"A couple of them, sure. Not most of them. He's right. Why do you think the lighting in Generations is so dark?  Personally I'd have been happy if they'd just renovated the TNG sets to look better on the big screen, but Berman and co. wanted a shiny new ship I guess. It's funny, though - they managed to kill off both Kirk and the D in silly, uninteresting ways, in the same movie.  I don't want to gripe too much. I don't actually hate Generations (don't love it, but don't hate it). But if you're going to go from a TV show to a movie you should raise the stakes, in my opinion, maybe tackle a recurring issue from the show in a more definitive, dramatic way. That would've given them the opportunity to kill off the D in a more meaningful fashion. Having some random villain we've never met before just makes it seem like a two-part TNG episode."
StarshipPorn,2zr7m1,Jux_,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:48:11 2015 UTC,It was the ship itself. The D was short and wide - made for a 4:3 television. They need a ship designed to better fit the 16:9 movie ratio.

It's safe to assume there's a yacht. Anything you say about the area is as speculative as everyone else accepting that it is the yacht.

StarshipPorn,2za4y7,TheRealBramtyr,14,Mon Mar 16 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"My counterpoint to your (absolutely valid) argument would be that because the franchise decided to largely stick by Jefferies' and Roddenberry's rules of design, Star Trek's basic hull arrangement (saucer, secondary cylinder, with two nacelles on pylons) has become so iconic that no other science-fiction franchise can even put those same shapes together without it automatically becoming a Star Trek reference. It has bred instant brand-recognizability and internal design continuity. But yes, that does mean that at a glance the ships mostly look the same, and/or derivative of one another. Pros and cons."

StarshipPorn,2z0sdx,curson,6,Sat Mar 14 23:24:24 2015 UTC,The Hyperion Cantos books. The first two are some of the best Sci fi out there.. The other two are..not so much.
StarshipPorn,2z0sdx,SovAtman,2,Sat Mar 14 23:31:26 2015 UTC,Super thanks! <3
StarshipPorn,2z0sdx,curson,2,Sat Mar 14 23:32:53 2015 UTC,"I'm just finishing the second book, and I didn't even know there were two more. But apparently I didn't need to! Thanks anyways, I guess!"
StarshipPorn,2z0sdx,Theban_Prince,2,Sun Mar 15 05:52:42 2015 UTC,"Don't pass on them. I love Simmons and the Cantos is one of my favourite book series ever, and while it is true the last 2 books pale in comparison to the first two, they are by no mean a bad read and they still complement nicely the whole series.  Read them with this notion in mind, and you'll enjoy them as well.  edit: typos. I hate mobile posting!"
StarshipPorn,2z0sdx,Naggers123,1 point,Sun Mar 15 06:49:45 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? Because the first two are emotionally heavy, and if the last two are all twisted on top of that I don't know if I'd enjoy it.  Like, you're saying they're better sequels than the Ender's Game ones, right?"
StarshipPorn,2z0sdx,Iamadinocopter,1 point,Sun Mar 15 07:02:41 2015 UTC,"I loved Ender's Game just as deeply and passionately as I hated all of the sequels, so I am surely biased. I think Endymion is the weaker than the two, and arguably The Rise of Endymion takes a different point of view that the reader might or not like.   Still I would advise reading it all. The Rise of Endymion arguably scarred me, but I always believe it to be more due to when I read it the book itself.  Just go in prepared not to face another set of double masterpieces and I think you should not regret it in the end, one way or another."

The ships on the cover looked like ass.  Somebody could put a corpse on a space background and this subreddit would upvote it."
StarshipPorn,2ykmzm,Iamadinocopter,6,Wed Mar 11 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"It's also from an old Japanese Anime.  My point is that this image is from a different time and place than you are. Perhaps you are judging it more harshly because it is not what you are used to? Looking at it tells a story, unlike most of the pictures in this subreddit. There is depth to the image in that dimension."
StarshipPorn,2ykmzm,Dubliminal,-2,Wed Mar 11 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"The text is the story not the picture. The picture is a poorly drawn triangle pointed at a rock. This is a subreddit about starship pictures not blobs. It seems like every sci-fi book artist doesn't bother reading a description or making a coherent picture. They just dab some splotches, throw on some shit antennae, make a couple of lumps or wing and BAM! you have every anime/cover ship ship ever made.  My point is that it is lazy, and not diverse. This ship and images like it are not worthy of this subreddit."

StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,Gigabeto,11,Tue Mar 10 00:38:42 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm the only one who's distracted because it's located far too close to the Earth to be at even L1 or L2.
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,PFHarlock,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"I was going to say it could be the earth-moon L1, but then it would still be waaaaaay closer to the moon than earth."

StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,PFHarlock,1 point,Tue Mar 10 06:21:29 2015 UTC,"... or maybe the station's just named ""Lagrange.""  derp, didn't read the description"
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,sto-ifics42,1 point,Tue Mar 10 13:08:40 2015 UTC,"The description states it's in a Lagrange point. So it is a tad bit off. I'm curious how small the earth would appear at a Lagrange point. You don't think it would be too small to enjoy the view, would it? Also, space debris would probably be a pain."
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,gecko1501,1 point,Tue Mar 10 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"The description states it's in a Lagrange point.   My bad, didn't see that. So your criticism is valid.   I'm curious how small the earth would appear at a Lagrange point. You don't think it would be too small to enjoy the view, would it?   Annoyingly, I can't find a site that straight-up lists the Earth-Moon Lagrange point distances, so I tried doing the math myself and came up with this to-scale representation (measured from Earth's center).  The Lagrange points are all very close to the average Earth-Moon distance (384,400 km), so we know exactly how impressive the view would be. L2, however, is exempt because Earth would be hidden by the Moon.   Also, space debris would probably be a pain.   Would it, though? Debris is concentrated in LEO and GEO, with almost nothing out as far as the Lagrange points. Plus, I imagine relative velocities between objects floating around a stable Lagrange point would be much less than the relative velocities of objects in different orbits in LEO.   Then again the artist's work is supposed to be in the 31st century, so who knows what their space debris situation is like."
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,sto-ifics42,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:41:40 2015 UTC,"I just remember reading that those two Lagrange points collect space debris, man made our otherwise (because they act as gravity bowls) but I do see what you mean about the relative velocities."
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,gecko1501,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, but maybe it's not Earth."
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,clankypants,2,Tue Mar 10 05:06:42 2015 UTC,"Gravity is gravity, so no matter the planet, this station would be in orbit around it, not at a Lagrange point.  It could be speculated that the hotel (with no apparent windows ...) is in orbit before it's boosted to a Lagrange point."
StarshipPorn,2yi7i2,PFHarlock,1 point,Tue Mar 10 06:18:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking if it had a super-close moon, and/or if the planet was much smaller than Earth.  The pre-boost idea is a good one, too."

StarshipPorn,2yfmp4,TheLuckySpades,2,Mon Mar 9 22:26:45 2015 UTC,"Haven't read that one, but these novels are quite 'simple' with lots of stereotypes (a short guy who fights anyone who calls him short...) they are easy readers that's for sure."
StarshipPorn,2yfmp4,DocLecter,2,Tue Mar 10 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"I like the simplicity of 70s sci-fi art. Not that I don't have an appreciation for some of the modern stuff, but this semi-impressionistic use of just primary colors and simple primary blends (even the green in this is obviously yellow over the blue) lends itself to a very distinct style."
StarshipPorn,2yfmp4,Deltigre,2,Tue Mar 10 13:54:57 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%.  A lot of the stuff that came out of the 60s, 70s, and early 80s is so evocative in it's simplicity, and yet the detail allows the imagination to explore a ship's decks and corridors.  Stuff by the like of Peter Ellison, Paul Lehr, and Rob Cobb is astounding."

StarshipPorn,2xh4dh,Tuskin38,3,Sat Feb 28 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"And they were civilian courier vessels converted as a last ditch effort to bulk up the fleet as they were outnumbered ten to one.  There are no canon purpose built fighters or carriers in Trek.  Even the Scimitar carried Scorpion Assault Flyers, designed to be inserted into Atmo from orbit to establish air superiority to assist ground assaults.  STO has taken drastic liberties with Trek canon to wedge fighter/carrier play in to satisfy gamers who desire that play style, but that doesn't mean Trek canon is different."
StarshipPorn,2xh4dh,Emperor_Cartagia,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Fighters have existed in Star Trek Beta Canon long before STO existed. It isn't an original idea.  Also, I guess this also goes with your ""Last ditch effeort"" comments, but you can see shuttles fighting the borg cube in First Contact like fighters."
StarshipPorn,2xh4dh,Tuskin38,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"Beta Canon has thousands of ridiculous notions, hell, there's six or seven different Beta Canon origins for the Borg.  That's doesn't mean we can take them all as true or equal to the live action series and movies.  Anything seen or said in the live action Alpha Canon overrides and supersedes anything from the Beta Canon automatically, and in the live action, there's no fighters or fighter carriers.   you can see shuttles fighting the borg cube in First Contact like fighters.   Hell no you can't! The whole thing's on YouTube, go watch it, there's no shuttles in that battle."
StarshipPorn,2xh4dh,Emperor_Cartagia,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:15:52 2015 UTC,Jonathan Frakes mentions them in the Commentary. I never actually looked close enough to actually see if there were any. I assumed they were some of the smaller ships you can't actually make out. Like the Millennium Falcon
StarshipPorn,2xh4dh,4mygirljs,0,Mon Mar 23 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I've been having this particular debate for years, since before STO launched even, there's no purpose-built Fighters or Fighter/Carriers in the Hard Canon, only in the conflicted Soft Canons and Fanfic.  And I'm of the strong opinion there shouldn't be."

StarshipPorn,2x5j9e,DoubleDDaveN,7,Thu Feb 26 03:29:13 2015 UTC,The size of the windows definitely gives the impression that this is a much smaller ship than the Galaxy or Sovereign classes.  It's interesting to think that subsequent generations of starship design would feature smaller hulls due to more efficient or miniaturized technologies and/or smaller crew compliments due to even better automation.
StarshipPorn,2x5j9e,ContiX,7,Thu Feb 26 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps Starfleet saw sense about putting families on board a ship regularly sent into danger, engaging enemy ships, discovering new and deadly phenomena, etc...."
StarshipPorn,2x5j9e,philkensebben18-1,8,Thu Feb 26 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"I get the sense that the prevailing opinion in r/daystrominstitute is that people consider families on the Galaxy class era ships to be a mistake too.    I actually totally disagree.  Starfleet's primary mission is peaceful exploration; and as they continue to do that, ships only get further and further away from home.  It doesn't, to me, make sense that Starfleet would require people to leave their families behind for the better part of decades on a single tour of duty.  Imagine if Starfleet were to roll out a new flagship starship class and a new Enterprise.  They audition the best and the brightest of the fleet to serve as her crew.  Then they have their new crew picked out.  And then they tell them that, as befitting a new ship of this class and caliber, their first mission after their shakedown will be a long-range survey mission into the far reaches of the beta quadrant.  A true mission of exploration with untold potential for scientific discoveries and first contact opportunities.  Except it's going to be a 10 year trip.  Five years out, five years back.    How much of their human crew is still going to be interested in the trip if they aren't allowed to bring their families?  If there's no chance they'll be able to meet someone in the crew and start a family on the mission?    I can see Vulcans being willing to do that, but they're going to quickly run out of officers from species with shorter lifespans if they do that."
StarshipPorn,2x5j9e,Andr007,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"Not only this but 'putting' families on starships makes a statement about the nature and purpose of the ship, crew and the Federation itself.

StarshipPorn,2x5j9e,FrozenHaystack,14,Thu Feb 26 19:02:57 2015 UTC,Awesome! It looks like the Constitution class (Kirks Enterprise) and the Sovereign class (Enterprise E) combined.

StarshipPorn,2wy0b4,Boonaki,5,Tue Feb 24 04:52:47 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying it. It's not your typical  game in that you are not the centre of a plot in any way at all.  It's just you and several thousand other pilots trying to make a living in space. Any story has to be added by yourself for yourself. Various career options are viable from trading to outright piracy. There are several planned expansions in the future which will add content to the game.   The graphics are beautiful and the developers make an effort to keep the Milky Way ( it models the entire Milky Way ) as up to date as possible.  When some new planets were discovered a few months ago they'd been added that the game within hours.   I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in space or sci-fi
StarshipPorn,2wy0b4,Boonaki,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"A game called StarQuest Online did something similar.  They took a real map of the galaxy and plotted the stars, millions of them. It could actually take months of real travel time to go from Earth to the edge of the map"

Is it something to do with keeping people away from radiation sources in the drive modules?  That would make sense, although I'd still be puzzled by the saucer shape."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,jtr99,15,Mon Feb 23 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there are canon explanations.  The impression I got was that they developed a modular approach to starship design and, for various made up technical reasons, decided the saucer was a great shape for the non-engineering part of a ship.    It's hinted that one of the earlier designs for Federation ships had a sphere at the front with an engineering section behind it and nacelles attached.  That has come to be known as the Daedalus class.  Over the different design iterations, the sphere flattened out into a saucer.  Then the saucer stuck around a long time (with some sphere based ones coming back later).  I think the reality is this:  In the 60s spaceships looked a certain way.  They were rockets, saucers, or tubes/cylinders.  So, when they went to make the enterprise, they connected a cylinder to a saucer and bolted rockets onto it."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,InconsiderateBastard,4,Mon Feb 23 17:19:48 2015 UTC,Great explanation; thanks.
StarshipPorn,2wvega,jtr99,9,Mon Feb 23 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"One of the neatest sets of images you'll ever see re: the real development of the Enterprise and subsequent starfleet ship designs are the doodles by Matt Jeffries, struggling to come up with a design that Roddenberry and the staff felt would be the ""right"" ship:   Tons of spheres here; the end design later became the Daedalus class Bits and pieces of what would later be the Klingon Battlecruier's wing design, here seen as the Enterprise's drive section Moving the shapes around to get close to whatever Gene would like"
StarshipPorn,2wvega,Making_stuff,2,Mon Feb 23 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"I dont know if it is cannon, but the explanation I once read or heard was that you wanted to keep the people away from the engines as much as possible, especially in the early years because they were considered dangerous.  Its like attaching your house or business to two nuclear missels, sure they might be able to control the radiation, but if something goes wrong and they blow up, you want to be as far away as possible and have a way to escape..thus the saucer section.  So you have the saucer section with living quarters and of course the bridge, then you have the engineering section closer to the engines to control and manage them, then you have the engines pushed away from the ship just in case."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,4mygirljs,2,Mon Feb 23 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"Star Treck gets around much of the nastiness of space travel through warp fields, energy shields and particle deflectors.  It seems to eschew physical solutions for energy based solutions."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,herps,5,Tue Feb 24 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"The Loknar looks like they were making the NX-class with TOS parts, nice"
StarshipPorn,2wvega,Vertigo666,5,Mon Feb 23 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"What's cool is the Loknar Class was designed in the early 1980s for the FASA RPG game, and the NX Class was based upon the Akira Class from First Contact, made in 1996. So it seems possibly the Akira was based on the Loknar."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,Vertigo666,3,Mon Feb 23 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"I knew about the Akira (just flip the NX upside down), but not the Loknar.  Looks like I got it backwards haha."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,ndecizion,4,Mon Feb 23 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"The only thing bugging me on the Kelvin refit is the warp nacelle is inverted in it's orientation to the space craft.

StarshipPorn,2wvega,4mygirljs,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:41:08 2015 UTC,I didnt like the Kelvin because I thought you had to have pairs of nacelles by cannon to create a balanced warp field  Unless they squeezed two into one somehow?

StarshipPorn,2wvega,FrozenHaystack,3,Tue Feb 24 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"I really like the loknar design. I know that spaceships do not have to be slighty aerodynamically looking, but I prefer the longer, flatter design like this loknar, the intrepid (VOY), or the sovereign class. They just look like they are agile and fast.   But somehow both the loknar and the kelvin look like the warp core wouldn't fit in the engine section."
StarshipPorn,2wvega,Tokeli,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"No need for it to specifically be one of those ridiculous billion-deck-tall reactors.

StarshipPorn,2wmk5x,kknd69,10,Sat Feb 21 10:27:18 2015 UTC,Seems like the beams cut chunks of rock away from the asteroid and then tractor beams pull those chunks into the grinder assembly at the front. I suppose from there the rock is ground and processed from those forward drill bits.

Chris Roberts, the guy behind this game and owner of the studio building it, is a veteran of the genre and wanted to return it to its former glory without the interference of a giant publisher forcing it out early or getting features cut, etc.  Also note that there are packages that are like $30. I originally pledged $35 and got alpha and beta access plus the finished game. Ended up upgrading to a $135 pledge so I could start off with a good ship for exploration.

StarshipPorn,2vyvs1,ethan_kahn,20,Sun Feb 15 13:23:39 2015 UTC,That would make for an interesting story.  Crew of a crashed Star Destroyer having to survive on a backwater world with no way of contacting the Empire or the New Republic depending on the time period.
StarshipPorn,2vyvs1,DomUK89,15,Sun Feb 15 13:31:21 2015 UTC,"Cool idea. I would interpret and imagine something slightly different. Bare with me, as I am not a huge fan of Star Wars so I might refer to something wrongly. Prepare for continuity issues. :D     The ship had crashed there during the lengthy reign of the Empire - which to them was missing and so thought to have been destroyed by the Rebels, as it was missioning on a distant border system. The uncharted system was spoken to have been of great importance to high-ranking Rebels, and was thought to have been a key strategic point of importance in a coming attack against the Empire.  ...  Upon dropping out of hyperspace and arriving at a discrete distance from the only habitable planet in the system, the crew of the Star Destroyer, Capital class ship, observed an expected silent calm in the area. Upon approaching further, they took readings of an unidentified ship coming into viewable range. Along a mile long hull, there was a chunky array of featureless, heavily armoured bulkheads. Before the crew of the feared Star Destroyer could power their weapons in respect to the intimidating features of the unidentified ship, a piercing blue glow began to power through the entirety of the mystery vessel. Without further warning and with a blinding haze sweeping the ship, the destroyer was hit by a 150m thick beam of high radiation energy, which, without damage to the external hull, penetrated deep into the core of the ship before exploding, with a terrible destructive power which swung her around with a sheer burst of nauseating inertia.  The crew, under desperate orders from the Commander, immediately activated their damaged hyperdrive and aimed loosely for Empire space, in defence of the weapon-ship firing again.   The leviathan class engines reached their critical-mass and the ship entered hyperspace - but something was wrong. The ship roared and creaked, as the damaged bulkheads just coped with decaying hull integrity. With an honourable dedication, the crew gripped their posts. An Imperial Ensign - charged with hyperspace systems and star coordination, called out the status of his monitoring display, with great confusion and disbelief. The ship, he exclaimed, was violently drifting through hyperspace, with great speed - more than which had been witnessed before.   Before his superior could investigate, the ship dropped from hyperspace and there was a cataclysmic surge of energy that soared through the systems on the ship, causing multiple explosions within in at least the visible layout of the smoky command centre. Moving in the direction of the port side, the Star Destroyer rumbled aimlessly in to a star system, with a trail of ember and debris, chaotically streaming behind them.   The commander pulled himself to his feet slowly, with a subtle display of his fury building inside him, as he quietly gave a controlled grunt as he stood vertical once more. Pushing aside the corpse of a nameless ensign assigned to sensors, he hunched himself over the station and began forcefully interfacing with it without grace, as his torn fingers smouldered from inside his gloves. He uttered without fear to the survived crew, that the Capital ship was on an inevitable collision course with a close-by planet in this unknown system. Even with heavy damage to the external long distance sensors, their location was irrefutably clear. They had arrived, somehow, in a distant galaxy.  ""Humanoid life signs detected"", he grunted with a fierce focus. ""Prepare for uncontrolled descent"".    It's not very often I feel like spontaneously writing random, shitty, short-short sci-fi stories, so I just roll with it. Sorry if it was terrible. :D  edit: typo fixed"
StarshipPorn,2vyvs1,luk7f,2,Sun Feb 15 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"that was actually pretty good  Only mistake I see is ""their was a cataclysmic surge"" should be ""there was"""
StarshipPorn,2vyvs1,DomUK89,3,Sun Feb 15 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Admittedly, that's probably the only short-short I have ever written, and I found it a lot more enjoyable than I expected. I found myself wanting to go in to a lot more detail than I have the time for. Writing a sci-fi novel is definitely on my list of things to do before I die!  I'll shall correct the typo.   I also thought that maybe the unknown planet could be Earth, seeing as Star Wars is set in the past and in another galaxy. The cranes look quite human-like, so this could be a 1000 years after the story, as man finds it in the early 21st century."

StarshipPorn,2vvnbo,Agrippen,23,Sat Feb 14 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"The CAS-class Assault Carrier. The flagships of the Covenant Navy.  Armed to the teeth and vast in its size, few other Covenant machines were as intimidating as this. The Launch Bay was so large that two UNSC frigates could fit inside it. The ship itself was over 5 kilometers (nearly 3.5 miles) in length, contained several thousand Covenant soldiers, and was known to be used by the High Prophets as personal transportation. Along with its soldiers, the ship could contain hundreds vehicles, including Seraph fighters, Phantoms, Banshees, Wraiths, Ghosts, Shadows, and any other vehicles it needed to support an invasion. The ship also carried multiple pulse laser turrets for point defense, plasma torpedo launchers, and at least two energy projectors for glassing the surface of its enemy's planets.  Earth was unlucky enough to encounter the Prophet of Regret's Assault Carrier, Solemn Penance, and its 14 escorting capital ships when they arrived at Earth in late 2552. The small fleet was looking for a large Forerunner artifact buried in East Africa, but they did not realise the planet they had arrived at was their enemy's homeworld. The Humans put up a solid resistance, destroying the 14 escorting ships, but the Solemn Penance passed through, laying siege to the city of New Mombasa.   Supporting an invasion all by itself, it gave the UNSC military a hard time trying to retake the vast swaths of the city that the Covenant had taken over. Eventually, the UNSC had forced much of the Covenant back to the Carrier, where they were evacuated as the ship prepared to make a slipspace jump inside the atmosphere. Several squads of ODSTs were making a combat jump on the Carrier right before it made the jump, and only one UNSC ship, In Amber Clad, gave pursuit, jumping with the Carrier to Installation 05.  The Carrier's Slipspace Jump crippled New Mombasa, weakening its massive orbital elevator to the point of collapse. Only one small ODST squad survived, assissting the forces in the area with fighting the remaining armies from the Solemn Penance, being forced to evacuate shortly after with an Engineer in tow as reinforcing ships arrived to glass the city."

StarshipPorn,2umteb,sto-ifics42,11,Tue Feb 3 13:24:40 2015 UTC,"Top image from here, bottom two views from here.  Full Atomic Rockets analysis available here.   When the Orion nuclear pulse propulsion concept was being developed, the researchers at General Atomic were interested in an interplanetary research vessel. But the US Air Force was not. They thought the 4,000 ton version of the Orion would be rightsized for an interplanetary warship, armed to the teeth. And when they said armed, they meant ARMED. It had enough nuclear bombs to devastate an entire continent (500 twenty-megaton city-killer warheads), 5-inch Naval cannon turrets, six hypersonic landing boats, and several hundred of the dreaded Casaba Howitzer weapons — which are basically ray guns that shoot nuclear flame (the technical term is ""nuclear shaped charge"").  Keep in mind that this is a realistic design. It could actually be built."
StarshipPorn,2umteb,Chairboy,11,Tue Feb 3 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"Because of the propulsion method, the ISP increased as mass was added.  This means that the bigger and heavier it was, the more efficiently the bombs transferred energy to it for propulsion.  There were plans drawn up for hypothetical manned-missions to Saturn by the 1970s in an Orion-powered ship that would be build by ship fitters in Virginia/along the east coast because heavy-duty steel construction would be preferable to lightweight aerospace techniques.  They visualized a flying city in space that could be launched by the 1960s and it was very do-able.  Technological problems would have to be overcome, but modern engineering hasn't found any silver bullets yet that would have condemned such an effort.  Environmental and political problems?  OH VERY.  But not engineering!"

StarshipPorn,2umteb,Pendaelose,13,Tue Feb 3 15:57:57 2015 UTC,"As cool as I think Orion is as well, it's worth noting that to launch one into orbit as shown would require a few hundred nuclear explosions WITHIN our atmosphere.  So… I can appreciate the audacity of the idea and recognize that it most likely would work, yet still be happy that it wasn't built. Why? Because I live here. Earth is where I keep my stuff!"
StarshipPorn,2umteb,the_rabbit_of_power,3,Tue Feb 3 16:00:42 2015 UTC,And Arthur!  You were going to nuke Arthur!
StarshipPorn,2umteb,Chairboy,3,Tue Feb 3 18:47:52 2015 UTC,A helluva a lot of nucs have been tested in the atmosphere during the cold war though.  If it got closer to reality I'd wager they'd attempt using perhaps a more conventional rocket to get it into outside the atmosphere. Modify to make it safe enough it wouldn't kill humanity but probably not be the best thing for the environment.
StarshipPorn,2umteb,Antal_Marius,4,Tue Feb 3 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"There have been proposals to do exactly that, but if you use a rocket for the lower stages then you end up needing to use an incredibly expensive and performance limited technique to heave tons and tons of heavy steel in the space.   It's a tough sell, one of the big advantages for Orion was that you could make a gimormous spaceship as heavy as you wanted and still get it in the space.   Once you introduce rockets, you end up with a small fraction of what actually makes the technique attractive in the first place."

StarshipPorn,2ujadg,MrGulio,3,Tue Feb 3 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"Homeworld was one of my favorite IPs as a young man. The art style and game play were truly incredible in their time (hell the art even looks good aesthetically today). But I've seen the shit that gearbox does with games they want to hype and rush out for cash.   All I can say is, don't fuck me gearbox, don't you dare fuck me."
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,MrGulio,3,Tue Feb 3 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way initially and held off buying the collector's edition because of Gearbox's track record. However, after seeing the gameplay footage and their recent panel my confidence has definitely been restored. I guess we'll see at the end of the month, but it seems like they're doing everything right."
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,IntrepidusX,2,Tue Feb 3 03:34:42 2015 UTC,I pre-ordered the CE even though I wholeheartedly believe in you should rarely if ever pre-order because the statue looked like the kind of collectible I would treasure on my desk. The footage from PAX South has been a bit reassuring.
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,Tokeli,2,Tue Feb 3 03:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I paid the late fee and ordered a copy from the UK, mostly for that mothership though the art book sounds pretty awesome too."
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,undefeatedantitheist,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:40:48 2015 UTC,I pre-ordered too. I am so excited to experience that game again.
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,undefeatedantitheist,2,Tue Feb 3 04:14:52 2015 UTC,"Crap, we forgot to texture the freighter! Quick, slap a UV test grid on there, no one will notice!"
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,undefeatedantitheist,-2,Tue Feb 3 10:44:26 2015 UTC,Dat marketing.
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,undefeatedantitheist,1 point,Tue Feb 3 12:13:17 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm just a fan with an overabundance of hype."
StarshipPorn,2ujadg,undefeatedantitheist,-1,Tue Feb 3 13:49:55 2015 UTC,Verisimilitude.  (I'll save you the trouble: we have no way to know what the truth is).  This series is being posted while HW Redux is on pre-order - marketed sales for the first time in maybe 10+ years?  And Gearbox are involved.  Though from your account it looks like you're just excited.
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,sto-ifics42,9,Mon Feb 2 18:24:39 2015 UTC,Is this a visualisation of Michael from Footfall? I kind of want it to be.
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,Cow_Launcher,3,Tue Feb 3 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"It has 4 NASA shuttles strapped to it, so YES."
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,Chairboy,2,Tue Feb 3 05:17:44 2015 UTC,"...And if I'd read the comment that /u/sto-ifics42 made a full six hours before mine, I would've saved myself from looking dumb by asking the question. FML&LOL"
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,Cow_Launcher,2,Tue Feb 3 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"Not at all, it's a 30+ year-old book (golly I feel old) that never made it to fame stratosphere, so it was a totally cromulent question.  :)  My all-caps 'YES' was one of enthusiasm, not judgment."
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,Chairboy,2,Tue Feb 3 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"Heh - that made me feel much better, thank you!   I want to go re-read it now. See also: Lucifer's Hammer."
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,Cow_Launcher,2,Tue Feb 3 17:46:20 2015 UTC,"Besides the 4 shuttles /u/Chairboy mentioned it's also using the project orion ""just throw some big bombs out the back"" concept of propulsion so I'm completely sure it is."
StarshipPorn,2ujhlw,Kosh_Ascadian,9,Tue Feb 3 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"Full Atomic Rockets analysis available here.   The Orion-drive Michael Battleship is the biggest meanest son-of-a-spacer in the cosmos! Well, maybe second to the Project Orion Battleship.  Just look at that bad boy! Can't you just see that unstoppable titan blazing into orbit on a pillar of multiple nuclear explosions, ready to kick that alien bussard ramjet's buns up between its shoulder blades? The drawback to Orion-drive is that it don't scale down worth a darn. So they didn't even try. No ""every gram counts"" worries here, they freaking chopped the main guns off the freaking Battleship New Jersey and welded them on!  Any casaba howitzer weapons? Naw, spears of nuclear flame are too feeble. They are using full-blown freaking Excalibur bomb-pumped x-ray lasers! Not infrared, not visible light, not even ultraviolet. X-rays. Just like Teller intended.  What's that you ask? What about the pumping bomb? Well, this is an Orion-drive, moron. That's whats driving the ship. Spit out a few Excaliburs, they aim their hundreds of laser rods on their targets, then the next pulse unit simultaneously thrusts the ship and energizes the graser beams. Another jumbo-sized order of crispy-fried elephant, coming right up!  Still have megatons of payload allowance left over? Well, how about carrying a small fleet of gunships with nuclear missiles? And all four space shuttles?  The look on the elephant's faces was priceless! Michael is coming. And is he pissed!"

StarshipPorn,2ub2f7,she_did_what,2,Sat Jan 31 19:58:51 2015 UTC,That really does look to be the back of the same thing
StarshipPorn,2ub2f7,twcsata,2,Sun Feb 1 00:18:44 2015 UTC,It really is.
StarshipPorn,2ub2f7,Kosh_Ascadian,9,Sun Feb 1 01:15:46 2015 UTC,"Those ships are just hideous, but I have to say, the artwork of them is great."
StarshipPorn,2ub2f7,twcsata,5,Sat Jan 31 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"They definitely aren't the best looking ships, I just like the fact that they're Mandalorian capital ships. Too cool."
StarshipPorn,2ub2f7,raysweater,3,Sat Jan 31 18:44:13 2015 UTC,I can't agree that the big one is hideous. I think it looks very cool.  But the little dog-head-on-a-stick ones are horrible.
StarshipPorn,2ub2f7,VenaterStugots,1 point,Wed Feb 4 09:41:15 2015 UTC,"I never would have seen the dog-head bit unless someone pointed it out earlier in the comments...now I can't unsee it, lol.  I think what makes it ugly to me is that I've always objected to the idea of starships that don't (or can't, I should say) land.  Even though, yes, I know, from a practical standpoint, they make so much more sense.  The star destroyers and, say, the Enterprise get grandfathered in here, because I've known about them ever since I was a little kid.  But otherwise, it's a hurdle I can just never seem to get past.  I will say again, though, the picture is excellent."

StarshipPorn,2u9iad,Quwilaxitan,6,Sat Jan 31 04:41:26 2015 UTC,I have some very good news for you.
StarshipPorn,2u9iad,Quwilaxitan,3,Sat Jan 31 05:14:22 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that looks awesome. My only gripe was with the combat scaling in Homeworld 2 where no matter how well you did, the enemy had a comparable force to yours when you arrived in system... But that won't stop me from picking this up. Thanks for putting that on my radar!"
StarshipPorn,2u9iad,goldenrod,2,Sat Jan 31 07:42:17 2015 UTC,Holy shit the scaling pissed me off so fucking much.
StarshipPorn,2u9iad,soulassassino,2,Sat Jan 31 11:27:18 2015 UTC,"Even worse, the campaign was unplayable until the 1.1 patch, as the AI had unlimited resources and blatantly cheated."
StarshipPorn,2u9iad,outofband,1 point,Sat Jan 31 11:32:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but after 1.1 it was pretty easy once you got the grip on it. Just recently replayed it.
StarshipPorn,2u9iad,soulassassino,2,Sat Jan 31 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, no doubt, as soon as they fixed it, it was absolutely brilliant.  Fun fact: In Hungary, they released it with translated text and voice files, and that made the patch fail. If you went out and bought the game, you couldn't patch it, and play it past the Vaygr starbase mission. I had to torrent an english version to play it."
StarshipPorn,2u9iad,Mello-Fello,2,Sun Feb 1 13:28:51 2015 UTC,... and now I'm going to have to listen to Barber's Adagio again.
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,spatialcircumstances,10,Fri Jan 30 04:27:28 2015 UTC,I so hope that those awesome mods like PDS will either work with the remastered version or that they'll be ported. I'll be playing the shit out of this game once it's released.
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,SiS-Shadowman,4,Fri Jan 30 07:48:45 2015 UTC,"Gearbox stated that there will be mod support and tools available, including steam workshop. So while i doubt the old mods will work on the remastered version, it shouldn't be too long before updated versions of a lot of the older mods are available."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,polnikes,1 point,Fri Jan 30 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"Woah, so hyped for this!"
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,Inprobamur,2,Sun Feb 1 10:12:04 2015 UTC,"Last I heard, the PDS mod team folded and stopped development years ago. However, several people from the Complex mod (which was similar to PDS) were actually brought in to consult on the development of Homeworld Remastered."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,HighOverlordXenu,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:56:46 2015 UTC,"They said at pax they are actually working with modder to give them an even better environment for modding, so I'm optimist."

StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,BattleStag17,8,Fri Jan 30 14:33:05 2015 UTC,The awesome kind.  Space ship RTS.
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,jdmgto,6,Fri Jan 30 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"Adding on!  3D, Tactical combat. Choose squad formations, Aggressive vs. evasive attacks - balance fuel and firepower.    Battlestar Galactica style clashes with a huge number of ships and an awesome research tree + lore.   Homeworld was cutting edge back in 1999. It's unmatched in terms of space combat. Sins is the closest you'll get, but even that's 2D and the focus is on land and acquisition, where Homeworld is all about the ships."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,AtomicSteve21,3,Sat Jan 31 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"I remember it as 3D Command and conquer in space, that 3D cards could handle if they were more than 2 generations out of date ( which was saying a lot back in the late 90's early 2000's).

StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,Silberdrachi,2,Fri Jan 30 12:25:56 2015 UTC,"So excited for this, just hope Gearbox doesn't screw anything up."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,jdmgto,2,Fri Jan 30 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"Well, as long as they have nothing to do with the story, it might be okay."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,finalremix,3,Fri Jan 30 15:37:48 2015 UTC,"To do a ""Remaster"" all they should do is up the texture quality, maybe improve the models a bit, some lighting effects, take advantage of new graphical improvements, etc. There is literally no reason to touch the story, voice acting, music, game play, any of it. Don't fuck with it, make it pretty, and I will give you my money."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,jdmgto,2,Fri Jan 30 16:09:18 2015 UTC,How similar is Homeworld to Sins of a Solar Empire? Will I like Homeworld if I was a huge fan of Sins?
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,IamHeretoSayThis,3,Fri Jan 30 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"I love both Sins of a Solar Empire and Homeworld, but they are very different games. Homeworld focuses on controlling a single fleet on a single map with an emphasis on tactics (you can control where your ships are in 3d rather than on a flat plane). You don't control planets or asteroids, instead your 'base' is the mothership, where you build ships, research and gather resources with no real empire building like Sins. Matches are oriented around destroying the enemy mothership. While Homeworld is not as fast paced or as process oriented as Starcraft, it is a much faster game per match than sins."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,polnikes,1 point,Fri Jan 30 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! That sounds pretty awesome, I'm disappointed I missed this game when it first came out. Most definitely will be picking it up this time around!"
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,IamHeretoSayThis,2,Fri Jan 30 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"Homeworld stress the RTS much more than Sins (well, HW is an RTS and has no turn based elements). It's smaller scale, but at the same time everything is on scale and you have hose battles with small fighters and km long spaceships exploding all over the place, it's awesome."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,outofband,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"Humor has it that a mothership class is coming soon. After Homeworld remastered release, the third sequel to the series. Homeworld: Shipbreakers aka Homeworld 3."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,Tachyonzero,3,Fri Jan 30 10:32:50 2015 UTC,Shipbreakers is a prequel to the original Homeworld.
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,HighOverlordXenu,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"I do believe Shipbreakers is not a Homeworld 3, just another pay-to-win."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,budi_utomo,3,Fri Jan 30 14:40:16 2015 UTC,What makes you say that?  The same people who did HW1 and 2 are behind Shipbreakers and have stated that it will be a prequel to the series. I have high hopes for it.
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,budi_utomo,0,Fri Jan 30 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"Homeworld is about commanding a fleet (in space!) into battle (in space!), while Shipbreaker looks like giving order to  scavengers."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,ShakesJr,3,Sat Jan 31 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"It started out that way. When Gearbox bought the rights to homeworld, they wanted the people making shipbreakers, blackbird initiative (pretty much everyone who made the first two games is in this company) and gave them the ultimate use of any homeworld IP to them for no charge forever or something, and long story short they are a subsidiary (sorta?) of gearbox and now shipbreakers is going to be official homeworld material. so the f2p is now a full title game and set as a prequel to homeworld 1999."
StarshipPorn,2u5xgs,budi_utomo,1 point,Sat Jan 31 23:54:22 2015 UTC,I just want more Homeworld-esque games :(  Shipbreakers would be more like CnC series.

StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,vaderfan1,25,Wed Jan 28 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Must be awful to realize that, right as combat starts, you need to be on the bridge in the other tower."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,waffle299,13,Wed Jan 28 22:54:58 2015 UTC,"Picturing that guy ""Okay okay I'm on bridge two right? Fuck fuck fuck""back down all the elevators I'm so fucking dead running down countless halls bumping into stuff"" please don't let the commander notice me"" back up the elevators into the right one then tries I sneak into his star ship cubicle."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Mrjimmyboy,7,Thu Jan 29 00:51:33 2015 UTC,I always thought of it as an aircraft carrier: ship ops and flight ops exist in seperate places.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,anubis2051,12,Thu Jan 29 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"Because of its carrier role, the Venator-class featured a novel dual bridge tower design. The port tower was the starfighter command bridge, while the starboard tower served as a standard helm and command bridge.   Wookieepedia agrees with this idea"
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,jwaldo,6,Thu Jan 29 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"Still isn't as useful as ship ops on one deck and flight ops on another deck of the same ship. Or better yet, ship ops buried deep within the hull where no A-Wing can kamakazi and flight ops on a tower."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,waffle299,1 point,Thu Jan 29 05:45:27 2015 UTC,Which is why real Aircraft Carriers do just that...oh wait
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,anubis2051,2,Sat Jan 31 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"Real carriers need to have visual contact with the flight deck in order to organize it properly. Star Wars seems to be able to depend far more an sensors, which can mean it can be buried in the hull like the CIC room of a modern carrier. The flight deck on the Venator class actually is internal, it would make much more sense to have it buried in the hull overlooking the launch bay. Plus just the height of the towers is kinda dumb, they could be put half way down and function just as well."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Warhorse07,1 point,Sat Jan 31 14:16:57 2015 UTC,"True which is why a Battlestar's CIC, in the new series,being deep in the interior of the main hull makes much more sense.  But most sci fi just wants shit to look cool. :)"
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,waffle299,2,Fri Jan 30 00:55:48 2015 UTC,Galactica is cool. Pegasus is terrifying. And both are more or less functional.    I wish more designers would realize that cool does not have to equal stupid.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,anubis2051,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:03:15 2015 UTC,Galactica's design still comes from that of a ship with a big glass windowed bridge at the front of the ship.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,steve7992,4,Sat Jan 31 02:04:16 2015 UTC,"I never understood the design of putting a bridge so exposed in space, most specially two of them. If the shields are defeated the ship is still armoured so it would be able to take punishment but my first target would be those bridges. Without shields even fighters could take them out."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Maxanisi,8,Thu Jan 29 06:53:01 2015 UTC,I always thought the two towered bridge was stupid
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Jaezor,13,Wed Jan 28 23:43:35 2015 UTC,The Royal Navy disagrees with your assessment.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Quest4life,1 point,Thu Jan 29 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"Weren't the Nimitz class carriers just out classed by the new Ford class? Not that it matters, just shows the age of this chart"
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Gryat,1 point,Sat Feb 7 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"ha, nice one. BURN."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Warhorse07,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the second structure on the UK carrier is basically the air traffic control center for the fighters which on US carriers is in the same ""tower"" just a different deck.  Is that the case here?  Seems like any sort of ATC command center for fighters on this SD should be within line of sight of the ventral launch bays.  On the other hand warships through the years have frequently had alternate, emergency, steering areas that a ship can be conned from but they are usually low and far from the main bridge, which makes sense.  You don't put your alternate bridge right next to the primary."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,willywag,27,Fri Jan 30 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"Always thought this was the best looking of all the Star Destroyer classes, especially with the Republic colors."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,McCheesington,7,Wed Jan 28 19:41:12 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with that.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Quest4life,10,Wed Jan 28 20:31:24 2015 UTC,Have you seen the huge lego versions of these? They're incredible.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Boonaki,5,Wed Jan 28 22:27:09 2015 UTC,Bought one at LEGO in Disney back in 2010 for 80 bucks. Now they are selling on ebay for 400. It's currently sitting in all 2000 pieces after an epic battle.

StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Scarecrow3,7,Thu Jan 29 00:01:54 2015 UTC,One of my favorite ship types in Star Wars.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,burgerbob22,5,Wed Jan 28 21:26:43 2015 UTC,this is a screenshot of the Jedi cruiser named 'Tranquility'. She makes her debut on The Clone wars season 1 ep. 9.
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Scarecrow3,3,Wed Jan 28 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"I always heard those called cruisers, not destroyers. But a little research tells me that both are used. They're muddling their naval terminology!"
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,burgerbob22,5,Thu Jan 29 00:52:49 2015 UTC,"I think ""Star Destroyer"" is more of a type of cruiser or type of ship, not necessarily the class. They are still cruisers. There are also still destroyer class ships too."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Scarecrow3,0,Thu Jan 29 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"I always thought cruisers were lightly armoured and designed for speed over durability, while destroyers were heavily armed and armoured. I guess ""Star Destroyer"" makes sense as a class name, but they seem to be the main capital ships as well, which would make them destroyers rather than cruisers.  I looked up the terms though, and there's really no consensus on what they mean exactly. I guess I'll fall back on the old excuse of ""fuck it, it's sci-fi."""
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,burgerbob22,7,Thu Jan 29 04:08:16 2015 UTC,"IRL, destoyers are smaller and less armored/armed than cruisers."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Scarecrow3,-2,Thu Jan 29 04:38:31 2015 UTC,"I think you've got that backwards. Cruisers are fast and light, destroyers slow and heavy. Hence the names."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,lionel1024,9,Thu Jan 29 04:59:03 2015 UTC,"Nope...  Destroyer  Cruiser  Basically, destroyers are smaller escort vessels. Cruisers (in the modern definition) are capital ships, much larger and more heavily armed. Cruisers these days are rare though, and armor is not really a thing in modern navies."
StarshipPorn,2tzkr8,Scarecrow3,2,Thu Jan 29 05:07:26 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. That's why I joined the army instead of the navy; it's easy to tell a tank from a truck.

StarshipPorn,2u12bm,PraetorianXVIII,2,Thu Jan 29 01:07:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of them were much cooler than Kushan, true. But I didn't really like their mothership that much. Felt a bit off. Like it's not really built by the same people or a completely wrong scale or something. Kushan mothership fit in extremely well size and design wise with the rest of Kushan stuff compared to the Taiidani one.  Design wise the Taiidani assault frigate was my all time favourite through the whole game though."

Someone in here said that he added a hyper drive, looks like he doubled the guns, moved the droid bay, added another gun thing in the center.   So he completely rearranged the internals, more than doubled the power consumption, and it still is just a custom and not a prototype of a new design?  /r/shittyspaceshipmods"
StarshipPorn,2tq7f4,DingleberryDouchebag,4,Mon Jan 26 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"It's Star Wars.  Shitty ship design/mods is the norm.    Even the X-wing is a shitty design.  There's a reason why no jet or propeller driven plane in war fighting history mounted its guns at the tips of the wings.  Mounting them so far apart makes it extremely difficult to have both guns actually hit the target at the same time.  The X-wing took it a step further though.  In the games and books the guns were set to zero (cross fire) at a specific distance in front of the fighter.  Talk about making hitting what you're aiming at even harder.  The unnecessarily variable geometry wings are also dorky and impractical from an engineering perspective.  Having the cockpit so far back would also adversely affect visibility.  There's a reason why all real-world Earth-tech fighters have the cockpit as far forward as possible and usually also elevated.  The B-wing is another giant turd of a fighter design.  All three of the gun pods are way the hell away from the cockpit, making aiming them a real bitch of a job. Good luck getting more than one gun on target at a time.  The variable geometry wings just mean more complexity.  The ridiculously long center pylon appears to serve no purpose and just takes up more deck space.  The entire thing could be reduced in size and complexity just by mounting a single giant gun pod in the middle, directly beneath the cockpit (or two smaller pods immediately to each side) and mounting the engines behind the pods with the torp tubes tucked in either under or outboard of the gun pods.  Add a bit more meat where necessary for fuel storage.  The frigates are another classic shitty design.  An engine/drive pod at the back and a long ass spine with nothing on it all the way up to a GIANT forward head.  It's like the ultimate in exaggerated dick jokes.  The drive force wouldn't even be directed through the ship's center of mass.  It would just sort of fly in a loop if it were real."
StarshipPorn,2tq7f4,sedatedinsomniac,3,Tue Jan 27 02:56:27 2015 UTC,Laser doesn't emit a muzzle flash.    crossing the beams limits your effect kill box to only a few hundred meters beginning a specific distance from the ship.  Face it.  Most of the Star Wars ships were sketched up to look cool rather than be functional.  The x wing's real advantage over a TIE fighter was its superior durability and shields.  The TIE had a better gun plan and better forward visibility.  Visibility to the side was a joke though.

From it's size it looks like it could load a very large object, but the overall ship size is not very large so it could only carry one large object, or a lot of small ones.  Cargo could then be some sort of specialized vehicle or equipment, such as a mining vehicle. Alternatively, it could be high value small equipment, materials - or as someone below suggested, spice.  It would be interesting if artists posted notes about their thought process behind the design, assuming they approach it from a functional viewpoint like this."

StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,dancingliondl,4,Sun Jan 25 17:48:36 2015 UTC,Those and Joey's armor were the only good things in that movie.
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,requiem1394,3,Sun Jan 25 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"The craft's unusually thin shape was problematic for blue-screen photography; the model tended to blend into the starfield. As a consequence, some planned sequences with the B-wing were cut from the original release of Return of the Jedi, and the B-wing is not explicitly shown in action during the Battle of Endor in the film.   I suppose this is one advantage to CGI now.  You can tweak the image how ever way you want in order to make a model visible. I've heard that this problem with blue screen technology is one reason why you rarely saw protruding flat solar panels or fins on sci fi ships from certain eras."
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,Wealthy_Gadabout,6,Sun Jan 25 15:55:25 2015 UTC,It looks like a toy.

StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,Gregorofthehillpeopl,4,Sun Jan 25 09:03:14 2015 UTC,I thought the B-wing flew vertical when it locked it's wings. At least thats what I remember from games and movie.
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,pirates_knob,9,Sun Jan 25 07:45:34 2015 UTC,"The cockpit rotates gyroscopically...the pilot can fly with the body of the craft in whatever configuration they want, really."

StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,LondonRook,-8,Sun Jan 25 08:26:11 2015 UTC,"No, he means orientation of the cockpit with regards to the body of the craft.   When dealing with life support systems & tactical piloting, none of that shit is ""relative"". Thats not how acceleration & gravity work. Not-having-your-frail-human-form-crushed-to-death-by-the-gravity-associated-with-changing-vectors is a constant.   Its, like, cool when star wars inspires physics. Its fucking stupid when people get the basic foundations of our physical reality wrong, in a hypothetical discussion about space flight of all things."
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,dumboy,8,Sun Jan 25 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"Whoa, you need to take it down a notch.  For one, this is a conversation about star wars, the Universe that popularized the physics of sound created by craft in space.  And secondly there's no reason why opening wings would cause a gyroscope to lock.  If they can build a starship they can certianly have those two systems independent of each other."

StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,ysadamsson,11,Sun Jan 25 07:05:45 2015 UTC,"Because it's really awesome? It's pretty neat,  the cockpit gyrates with the motion of the ship so as to limit g forces on the pilot.  Also lots of heavy weaponry.   Edit: motion not notion."
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,ysadamsson,9,Sun Jan 25 07:14:44 2015 UTC,"I guess the gyration would make it easy to take evasive maneuvers without tearing your pilot in half. Also, since it's easier to turn on the thin axis, you can rotate the ship and keep your orientation while turning.  I see your point. :D"

At least in ""X-Wing vs TIE Fighter"" it has 3 laser cannons, 3 ion cannons, and can carry missiles, torpedoes, or bombs. It is a HUGE upgrade from the Y-Wing. It has more powerful shields, more firepower, and more manoeuvrability."
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,Tokeli,-1,Sun Jan 25 16:27:20 2015 UTC,Why locate the guns at the other end of the ship from the cockpit?  It's like trying to shoot accurately whilr holding a pistol straight out to the side at the end of a ten foot pole and pulling the trigger with a string. Why have the ship unfold like it does?  It is unnecessary added complexity without functionality.  It reduces overall durability while also making the ship larger than necessary when it has to fit aboard a carrier where space is at a premium. Can you imagine trying to park something that ungainly?
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,DriverX7,5,Sun Jan 25 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"1) Targeting computers that adjust sights and zero the guns properly?  2) What? It unfolds BECAUSE space is a premium, and it takes up less space folded up. And generally in Star Wars, fighters with ""split wings"" can perform faster maneuvers when they're folded and locked.  3) Landing computers!"
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,Tokeli,1 point,Sun Jan 25 16:52:37 2015 UTC,"The B Wing doesn't seem to use an Astromech droid, why is that?"
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,sedatedinsomniac,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:31:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's either beneath that hatch just behind the rotating mechanism, or it doesn't even need one. Would probably say it doesn't need one, as the B-wing is more advanced than the X- or Y-wing that's the rebel mainstays. It's got room for an actual navigation computer, which is the main use of an astromech on a fighter."
StarshipPorn,2tl7l6,Osiris32,-2,Thu Apr 30 06:11:05 2015 UTC,In the starwars universe the guns were zeroed to cross at a specific point (see the books). And were typically fixed position guns except for the A wing. Folded up it's still a giant waste of space.  Why have landing computers when nearly everything else in the starwars universe is manually controlled?

StarshipPorn,2t8wij,burgerbob22,3,Thu Jan 22 10:09:58 2015 UTC,"The big fuel tank is actually for the shuttle's 3 main engines not the boosters.

""Star Light Star Bright, the place where Alex and Maggie went to the stars!"" was a horrible line delivered badly.  In fact, I'd also say that much of the acting was mediocre or sub-par.

Ok, it's not that the acting was spectacular, or that the writing was amazing.  It was the feeling of the movie.  It fit perfectly into the time in which it was made.  Everything about it screams 1980s!  Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 80's, and that's why I love it so much.    I think it did well at being what it was set out to be.  I mean, it wasn't on the epic level of Star Wars.  It didn't need to be, though.  It was something different entirely.  Parts of it were a little cheesy, but I think that added to its charm."

StarshipPorn,2spwkp,Jonruy,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"Technical capabilities of the ion engine are limited by the space charge created by ions, that limits the thrust density (force per cross-sectional area of the engine) to a very small level. Therefore ion thrusters create very small levels of thrust (for example the thrust of Deep Space 1's engine approximately equals the weight of one sheet of paper).  Wikipedia"

Anyone can kill off a parent, or wife/girlfriend, or a few hundred people, or even an entire planet in a video game. What made that resonate so hard was the hope the game had built up getting to that point, you were setting out on a grand quest. Then they hit you with this, and that music, and the Karen's reaction to it. That sold it. That turned another ho-hum, blown up planet moment into one of the most resonating moments in gaming for me.

It shouldn't be too surprising, considering they took cues from the International Space Station when designing it, but it looks like something humans would really send into the stars.  Even more interesting is how they make futuristic technology like stasis pods, cryogenic seed vaults and advanced robots look old and used in the movie, sort of like seeing the space shuttle with all its scorch marks and worn tiles from dozens of missions."
StarshipPorn,2sfj3t,Metlman13,7,Wed Jan 14 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"it is the most realistic looking starship in all of science fiction movies   ... in all of them? You sure? What about the Venture Star or Discovery or Pegasus? Each one was designed with the help of engineers & scientists. NASA even did a full design study based on Discovery, and I'm fairly certain the Venture Star is the only fictional spacecraft with proper heat radiators to appear in a big-budget SF film."
StarshipPorn,2sfj3t,sto-ifics42,3,Wed Jan 14 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"Never saw the show with Pegasus in it, so I can't comment on that.  Among sci-fi works, Discovery One and ISV Venture Star (better image) have some of the most fleshed out backstories behind them, even when they don't play a very important role in their respective films.  Discovery One, from a late 1960's perspective, was a hyper-realistic future spacecraft, especially in an era where one of the common sci-fi tropes was a V2-esque rocket going around and landing on planets. I also like how its backstory is spruced up with descriptions of how companies like General Electric, Westinghouse, IBM and General Mills contributed to the ship's construction, it is very reminiscent of real life private company contributions to space programs such as Apollo. Now, of course, the ship looks retro-futuristic with its designs and lighted up analog controls, but it still is as timeless as the movie it's in.  ISV Venture Star is also explained in insane amounts of detail from various backstory works of the Avatar universe. I just remember when I went to see it in theaters in late 2009, seeing the opening shot of it approching Pandora was one of the most amazing scenes of that whole movie, and I loved all the little details of it, such as the centrifugal crew compartment, the mirror shield, and the cavernous habitation module, which despite its immense size, is still dwarfed by the ship' superstructure (did I mention that I've always strangely liked open-structure starship designs?)."

Voyage to the Planets and Beyond, while somewhat obscure, is a must-see for any hard-SF fan. It's essentially an envisioning of what humanity could undertake if all our space programs joined forces and were given a blank check to explore the solar system.   It is our destiny to explore the far frontiers of space. Last century, we took the first steps to the moon. Imagine we were ready to take the next giant leap. This is the story of a manned voyage to the planets: humanity's greatest challenge, and ultimate adventure.  This eight-billion-mile tour of our solar system is based on science fact, not fiction. Using data from over 40 years of unmanned probes and human spaceflight, it is a vision of how technology could take us on a search for the origins of our own planet, and signs of extraterrestrial life.

Jonathan Nolan decided there would be engine pods, detachable colonization pods, and living area pods arranged in a circle for artificial gravity. The only question was how many of each. They picked 4 of each, for a total of 12, because 9 was too few and 15 was too crowded.   EDIT: Source, from Empire Magazine's coverage of the film   [Empire is] convinced Nolan and Crowley have deliberately gone for a clock theme [...] Neither of them are having it. ""We try not to overanalyze,"" insists Nolan. The design, says Crowley, is driven by the practical needs of the story."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,MungoBaobab,7,Wed Jan 14 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"While pretty....   Warp nacelles must be in pairs. As Andrew Probert explained in this web site's 2005 interview, ""Gene specified to me, in fact, that starship warp engines operate in pairs... because they're codependent.... So in the same breath he negated [Franz Joseph's] three-engined dreadnoughts along with the single-engined destroyers [and scouts], on the edict simply that, to achieve warp drive, you had to have codependent warp engine pairs.""     Source"
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,Goblin-Dick-Smasher,12,Wed Jan 14 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, but Probert himself was involved with the design of the Constellation class as documented here.  According to the link:   Probert noted on the design, ""Now, Gene dictated that there are no three-engine starships and no single-engine starships. When I was first designing the new Enterprise he said, ""The Federation ship's engines always are co-dependent"". It is the same as to say they always worked in twos. So that's why when Sternbach and I came up with the Stargazer, it had two sets of twos.   As regards to the possibility a ship like this fan-made concept actually existed in-universe, we know the more modern, ""refit"" configuration Constellation class ship USS Hathaway was launched in 2285, during the events of Star Trek II & III.  The refit of the Enterprise began in 2270 until the events of The Motion Picture, and the original USS Constellation was lost in ""The Doomsday Machine"" set in 2267.  So that's three years for Starfleet to launch this design and name it after the lost ship from the TV series.  The prototype USS Constellation, NX-1974, was detailed in the Operation: Retrieve chart from Star Trek VI, although not seen onscreen."

I don't give into the ""they were pairs inside one Nacelle casing"" that explains away the Future Enterprise-D. There's no on screen source that says that."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,DefiantLoveLetter,3,Thu Jan 15 14:05:09 2015 UTC,"WE have to separate TNG era vs. TOS era.  Even some of Roddenberry's ideas changed/were refined when TNG started.

StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,Goblin-Dick-Smasher,2,Thu Jan 15 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"Well, another problem is that the Saladin/Hermes class from the original tech manual was shown in the B/G display on the Enterprise Bridge in ST:II. The odd numbered nacelle thing was canon well before TNG.  Roddenberry's rules did provide a nice aesthetic for the better looking ships in trek, I'll give him that. However, Nacelles only work in pairs to achieve warp drive is not canon. Maybe, speculatively, they work more efficiently in pairs?"
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,DefiantLoveLetter,2,Thu Jan 15 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"Saladin/Hermes class from the original tech manual    If you're referring to this tech manual it's not considered canon.  It's Franz Joseph designs.   the Saladin/Hermes class from the original tech manual was shown in the B/G display on the Enterprise Bridge in ST:II   You're going to have to show me that.  I don't recall it.  I have the movies on my computer, so if you give me a time stamp I can screen shot it and share.  I'm not trying to argue canon.  Just made a point, that's all.  I actually like the aesthetic of the Franz Joseph designs.  But I do think Roddenberry did intend it to be two at first, I have books written in the early 70's all about the making of star trek but haven't read them in forever and that was something that stuck with me.  Now, he could have changed his mind, totally permissible.  Hell, it's all made up anyway."

If I can't find them there or through Google, I'll check my copy of the DVD when I get home and update here.  I discuss canon all the time, especially when behind the scenes things come up.

But I have read a lot of what Gene said, and in the early days, so somewhere lost in my head that stuff is rattling around waiting for something to touch that synapse and bring it to the foreground.  Doesn't mean it's still correct or current, just from what I recall is all.

StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,UsoInSpace,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"I believe Roddenberry's intent was two nacelles.  The ""they work in tandem"" didn't mean you can have as many as you want as long as they're considered in pairs.  But, there's a difference between TOS era (not reinvented TOS era from TNG folks that made it canon, but actual TOS erea) and TNG.  TNG changed some core rules, and then they'd change them again, to fit into how things conceptually would work.  Of course, none of it really matters, I love the concept of Franz Joseph's designs so it's a moot point of argument now."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,Goblin-Dick-Smasher,2,Thu Jan 15 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"If his intent was that ships have two nacelles, he would have said 'one pair', 'two nacelles', 'only a pair of nacelles', or something to that effect."

StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,halcyoncmdr,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:08:03 2015 UTC,"They excuse that by claiming (and I believe there is some backup for this claim in the technical manual) that a galaxy-class warp nacelle is functionally two engines in one housing.  So the original fit of the ship would, essentially, have four engines.  The refit would have six."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,Goblin-Dick-Smasher,2,Wed Jan 14 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity (since I've never read the technical manuals, and haven't read much into the canon-aspect of it personally), could they have been talking about the new triple nacelle design being that way since they're upgraded, but the old dual-nacelle design being different? It's not totally inconceivable that a newer design might reduce the size requirements substantially and enable them to pair the engines up within each nacelle. Or does the explanation specifically say it applies to all Galaxy-class engines, even prior to that triple nacelle design?  That would allow the old dual nacelle design to fall within the requirements, as well as the triple nacelle design."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,thereverendsteve,1 point,Thu Jan 15 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"The discussion is single nacelle vs. triple nacelle per the old Fran Joseph tech manual, a page of it is here.  The single nacelle mentioned above from that book.  The discussion is if Roddenberry wanted the ship to always and only have two nacelles, or nacelles in pairs.  My recollection of older conversation was two, others say they've seen it recalled as pairs in TNG era.  But in the ST:II and ST:III there is the single nacelle ship (linked to in this reply) that [appears on a bridge console](i.imgur.com/MK7YgN6.jpg).  And if that appearance makes that ship canon or not."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,Stealthy_Lehninger,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:13:49 2015 UTC,"I would have to check to be sure.  But I do know that if you look at the design of the warp coils in galaxy class engines, you'll find that they are spilt into two halves, top and bottom.  The thought, again not canon, is that each coil half can act independently of its counterpart, making each engine split so that it could function as two independent engines"
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,thereverendsteve,1 point,Thu Jan 15 22:16:27 2015 UTC,But what's the point in having 6 engines over 4? What's the galaxy classes max speed in comparison to the dreadnoughts?
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,Stealthy_Lehninger,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"Normal galaxy class was warp 9.2 normally with an emergency speed of 9.7  I think, but that's off the top of my head.  The dreadnought was capable of at least warp 13 according to the episode.  It's not clear if the extra engine makes that possible, or if it's there for redundancy, or some other reason."
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,thereverendsteve,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:10:00 2015 UTC,Warp 13? Isn't that getting into transwarp territory?
StarshipPorn,2sfi9m,ActionFlank,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"It's not canon, but the consensus is that they reconfigured the warp scale again, just like they did between tos and tng.  That way they don't have to give speeds like ""warp 9.9999997"""

StarshipPorn,2sbnxj,tgiokdi,1 point,Fri Jan 16 07:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more than a ping. Imagine getting 285,000 texts at the same time. Is your cell phone designed around you routinely getting that many texts at the same time? No, probably only designed for a handful at a time at most. Most ""real"" computer systems don't scale up to insane numbers for routine tasks that are generally small."
StarshipPorn,2sbnxj,zutroy,2,Fri Jan 16 08:02:57 2015 UTC,"well, 1, please consider we're talking about a theoretical future technology, which leads me to 2, i doubt it would be much more than a TCP/IP hello ping, and I would imagine that there's a vast difference in knowing how many distinct 'hello' messages your getting and being able to reach each of the messages that were included in them.  sorta the difference between knowing you have 10 pieces of mail and reading the contents of each letter, aye?"
StarshipPorn,2sbnxj,tgiokdi,1 point,Fri Jan 16 08:16:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's silly to argue over a theoretical future technology. But Star Trek is based on the extension of human technology, so it's not outside the realm of logic to make parallel comparisons.  Imagine getting a notification in your email client (phone, gmail, whatever) that you had 285,000 new messages. As you said, not the contents, just the notification. I dare say the email client would choke on even the notification. If you design a system to handle 10 notifications at once, scaling up to 285,000 is a rather extreme burden on such a system."

StarshipPorn,2s64x9,SobanSa,22,Mon Jan 12 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"Luke looked around the small bay as he landed. Artoo's concerned vocalizations did not need a translation. ""I'll be ok Artoo. Business as usual."" The two storm troopers waiting with their blasters served as a reminder that this was not actually business as usual.  Popping the cockpit, Luke climbed down the ladder. He felt more then saw the imperial commander behind him. Luke turned to see a small man with an impeccable uniform. He was flanked by the two Stormtroopers. ""Commander Skywalker I presume?"" He said formally, extending his hand.  Luke took it, their hands shaking. ""That's me."" He tried to smile, but the last time he had seen stormtroopers they had been trying to shoot him. Their relaxed posture did not relax him.  ""Welcome to the Inevitable. The captain and you have much to discuss. If you want, we will refuel your starfighter and hook it into the ship's charging system.""  Luke was unsure if he should take this offer. However, he figured that artoo could watch the ship. Besides, there was no way for the droid to safely get down from there at the moment. ""Certainly, my Artoo will oversee the connection."" He said.  The Impeial commander nodded to some techs and turned to lead Luke to the bridge. The Captain was a huge man, but old, he turned giving Luke Skywalker a curious look. ""Commander Skywalker, it's good to see you. I trust you have the proof I asked for?""  Luke nodded, reaching for his lightsaber and igniting it. ""This is what you wanted to see?"" He asked before deactivating it again.  The captain looked at the blade fascinated. ""I wanted to make sure you were who you were rumored to be. I served with your father during the clone wars."" He took the code cylanders from his pocket and handed them to Luke. ""The Inevitable, it's officers, and crew have now officially defected to the Rebel Alliance."""

StarshipPorn,2s64x9,Pookieburr,6,Mon Jan 12 18:58:45 2015 UTC,Wow that man sure can write! I guess I should really start the Bacta War series seeing as how they get praised so much.
StarshipPorn,2s64x9,cmmgreene,8,Mon Jan 12 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"Bacta Wars, Wraith Squadron, Iron Fist and I Jedi. Man I miss Corran Horn, they wrote him so well, and they showed that even if you are force sensitive you can still be beaten by the likes of Wedge Antillies and Tycho Clechu. I really like how the EU explained individuals like Han, Wedge, Tycho and even Fett. The force is almost always with them even if they are mostly blind to, I hope this new movie explores this more."
StarshipPorn,2s64x9,Pookieburr,6,Mon Jan 12 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, personally the force just wasn't my cup of tea and I always held more interest in the average rebel/imperial trooper since they were in the thick of things. I liked the heroes don't get me wrong but they could never convey the rawness of the conflict that Star Wars was."
StarshipPorn,2s64x9,cmmgreene,6,Mon Jan 12 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"There was an interesting story where a Squad of Storm Troopers go rogue and start doing some avenging angel type missions.

The Empire is not just faceless evil, some people hated its action but were proud of the good they did while in service to the galaxy."

It doesn't look like a large ship.  Plus in the distance there are a couple of rebel cruisers and some more X-Wings flying around.  So the question might be ""How exactly did this state of affairs come to be?""  It doesn't even look all that tense--the X-Wing has no marks on it so it hasn't been shot up, and they already have it hooked up to power (of course they might be scouring the computer or something)."

StarshipPorn,2s64x9,feor1300,3,Mon Jan 12 18:23:50 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd be holding him at gunpoint if they were the ones planning to defect. They may have armed guards present, but the party accepting the surrender wouldn't have his hands up."
StarshipPorn,2s64x9,pimpmyrind,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  They don't know if they csm trust the rebels yet, do they?"
StarshipPorn,2s64x9,feor1300,3,Mon Jan 12 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, but if you're surrendering to someone your probably not going to hold that person at gunpoint. Like I said, I could understand armed guards, but if someone said they wanted to surrender to me, and then when I showed up they pointed a gun at me and made me put up my hands, I'd assume the whole thing was a trap.  Whereas if I was surrendering to someone and then held me at gunpoint I could understand it as they'd be worried my surrender might be some kind of trap."
StarshipPorn,2s64x9,pimpmyrind,3,Mon Jan 12 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like he's really at gunpoint though.  Neither trooper is aiming at him, it only looks like the one on his right is sort of holding his blaster kind of nonchalantly in his direction.  I think there is something going on here more than ""the rebel pilot got caught.""  If they expected him to be a totally unwilling and hostile presence in the hangar then they'd probably be more tense.  So I'd go with, yeah, either he's surrendering/defecting and they're not sure what to make of him, or else the Imperials are surrendering/defecting and they're just tense and on edge because they're worried about the Rebels blowing them out of the sky."

StarshipPorn,2s0ryj,wolfpacsoldier,3,Sun Jan 11 04:53:34 2015 UTC,not OP but SW is a CAD/CAM software compared to MAYA thats a 3d modelling software.  SW is mostly used in industrial settings since you can make very detailed technical drawings/blueprints with the optional 3d views for clarity (helps visualising the finished piece)  Maya probably has way more options for the 3d modeling since its dedicated to 3d animation.  in the end the programs have different markets and different toolsets (the makers of maya does have other software that correspond to SW though)

I had never read of such a thing in the Dune novels, so I dug a bit deeper into the artist's portfolio and found that his Dune art is based on an alternate Dune universe where Dune spoiler.

StarshipPorn,2rasfc,alfonsoelsabio,4,Sun Jan 4 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"Several possibilities (and the Episode IV novelization or some other source might state an answer definitively)   Tantive IV was involved in an operation over Toprawa, where Rebel agents transmitted the Death Star data from the surface as the ship flew overhead.  The ship could have been damaged during this operation. Star Destroyers have powerful tractor beams.  Perhaps the ship was caught in one (or more) and was being reeled in from the moment it comes on screen in Episode IV (tractor beams are not visible in SW) Darth Vader was aboard Devastator at the time.  He's a Sith.  Perhaps he simply out-maneuvered Tantive IV or foresaw its flight path or something."

Just like the ship.  EDIT: I'd rather have the trailer flat-out lie to me rather than have the entire plot revealed before I even buy my ticket. There was some movie that lied spectacularly well that came out in 2014 but I can't for the life of me remember what it was. I thought the trailer had ruined it but it misled very well."

Wouldn't 70-years worth of smugglers' mods lead the ships to look more different than this? They both installed the exact same dish? They both installed the exact same guns? Both ships are missing the exact same external panels? This artist took no effort to make these unique. They just threw stripes on the Falcon."
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,marsmedia,2,Mon Dec 29 20:30:58 2014 UTC,"I agree with you for the most part, but the visible turret is different.   https://www.google.com/search?q=millennium%20falcon%20turret&client=ms-android-verizon&espvd=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sboxchip=Images&sa=X&ei=T72hVMKSA4mxyQSD2oCgAw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&biw=360&bih=559#facrc=_"
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,HellsAttack,-1,Mon Dec 29 20:48:35 2014 UTC,Did it occur to you that that is how they left the production line?
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,SPCGMR,11,Mon Dec 29 20:36:55 2014 UTC,"actually they didn't leave that way off the production line.  YT1300 stock didnt have the dish, concussion missile launcher, the 2nd quad turret."
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,DontGetCrabs,1 point,Mon Dec 29 21:36:07 2014 UTC,I am thouroughly amazed by how much detail I have missed from the SW universe. And I thought I was hardcore for playing the games and stuff.  Looks like I need to get to the books. Where's a good place to start?
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,Lemonade_IceCold,9,Thu Apr 16 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"So you're suggesting that Han Solo, who obviously tinkered extensively with his ship (or had Chewie tinker) given his bragging, left his ship externally stock."
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,Jordanis,5,Mon Dec 29 21:09:52 2014 UTC,"Yes, as it would allow him to go un-noticed and not attract attention. He's a smuggler, not a mercenary."
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,SPCGMR,6,Mon Dec 29 21:23:03 2014 UTC,"A lot of the stuff marsmedia is talking about isn't stuff that says 'mercenary'.  The hull panels and the dish, for instance.  They're old ships by ANH.  It's like an old Ford truck.  Lifts, exhaust pipes, different colored or missing body panels--that's all totally normal and doesn't stick out at all."
StarshipPorn,2qpkva,Jordanis,7,Mon Dec 29 22:59:53 2014 UTC,"I'm not that deep into the old EU, but were there ever any other ""Smuggler"" YT-1300s in the old lore other then the Falcon?"

StarshipPorn,2ql10r,genuinewood,9,Sun Dec 28 12:14:47 2014 UTC,"In ""Occupation"" I spotted them carrying the miniguns and missile racks, so it's possible this one's kitted for ground strike?"
StarshipPorn,2ql10r,soulassassino,11,Sun Dec 28 21:02:05 2014 UTC,"Seems plausible. I have always liked the physics of the Vipers in the show. How the pilots were able to translate and rotate regardless of air using the ships' RCS thrusters, and also how the engines did not have to always be on. It was very believable."
StarshipPorn,2ql10r,genuinewood,13,Sun Dec 28 21:07:01 2014 UTC,"BSG in general seemed to at least to some degree try to follow how real physics work in their portrayal, which was great. I also loved how they used the sound effects that ""were recorded"" from inside the ships. Such as the viper sounds we heard were all from the pilot's point of view, as there's no sound in space. Great compromise."
StarshipPorn,2ql10r,soulassassino,5,Sun Dec 28 21:15:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah. When ships exploded far away, the only thing that would be heard was the small pressure wave from the explosion. Although, do the Cylon ships make noise in space?"
StarshipPorn,2ql10r,genuinewood,6,Sun Dec 28 21:28:54 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they have both engine and firing noises done along the same line of thought."
StarshipPorn,2ql10r,soulassassino,3,Sun Dec 28 22:16:02 2014 UTC,Funny enough just re-watching the whole show. This thing is badass when kitted like this.

And that they put miniguns on a spaceship?  If those things are fired in space, they will ruin someone's day at some point in the future.  Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son of a bitch in space."

Once you fire this hunk of metal, it keeps going till it hits something. That can be a ship, or the planet behind that ship. It might go off into deep space and hit somebody else in ten thousand years. If you pull the trigger on this, you are ruining someone's day, somewhere and sometime. That is why you check your damn targets! That is why you wait for the computer to give you a damn firing solution! That is why, Serviceman Chung, we do not ""eyeball it!"" This is a weapon of mass destruction. You are not a cowboy shooting from the hip!"
StarshipPorn,2ql10r,dinklebob,5,Mon Dec 29 00:11:39 2014 UTC,"What is that from? Anyway, it's a fun quote but space is too big for that to be a problem. In the off-chance it hits a planet it will just burn up in atmosphere anyway."

StarshipPorn,2q2fng,OgodHOWdisGEThere,2,Mon Dec 22 14:14:01 2014 UTC,I believe that's the point. it's a throwback to the older elite and frontier games with their wireframe models.
StarshipPorn,2q2fng,TrueNateDogg,4,Mon Dec 22 19:44:56 2014 UTC,"I'm aware of that, but in my opinion it's a poor way to inform design, like I said, as a result of this the game now has a very narrow scope in terms of art direction. every environment in the game has the same colour palette and all the  ships share the same basic geometry. because of this, I feel that the game communicates the physical scale of the ships very poorly. it seems that because the game is coming from a relatively small studio for a project of this size, they have not really been able to invest in a proper art department. still, I admire their ability to focus the development of the game thus far on gameplay."

StarshipPorn,2q1ups,sto-ifics42,10,Mon Dec 22 09:01:28 2014 UTC,Because maybe the colony will have orbital components or need access to an orbital facility for resupply? Same concept as the colony in Avatar on Pandora. That's one of countless reasons I could imagine a shuttle being necessary. Or you could be you and just think it makes sense for the massive colony to lift off like energy is free and weight doesn't matter.
StarshipPorn,2q1ups,SwordPen,-12,Mon Dec 22 14:32:15 2014 UTC,Shuttles cannot take off under their own power. That's a one-way trip down.

StarshipPorn,2q1ups,SwordPen,-13,Mon Dec 22 21:35:41 2014 UTC,"Do those look like conventional modern day space shuttles to you?   Pretty much, yes.

You can throw authors names around but you're just so small minded I doubt you even understood the books you read. Those ""little bits"" and countless other components could easily be more than advanced enough to do any number of things.

StarshipPorn,2pyp3u,TomSaylek,23,Sun Dec 21 11:27:58 2014 UTC,"The tech is technically there, its just too inefficient to be viable really. There would have to be massive advancements in jet propulsion before something like this becomes viable, the fuel would be empty in less than half an hour to lift something of this weight. At the current stage of propulsion, this is just an inefficient helicopter, only when jets become equally efficient will this then be convenient and will then have the advantage of being faster in a straight line."
StarshipPorn,2pyp3u,Goldie643,3,Sun Dec 21 14:47:28 2014 UTC,"....I was under the impression that Pelicans used fusion rocketry for propulsion....that would essentially be what it would take to move something like that around to & from orbit, with troops/Scorpions/etc....."
StarshipPorn,2pyp3u,jpowell180,7,Sun Dec 21 16:56:46 2014 UTC,"Some sort of nuclear propulsion is probably the most viable given the large amounts of energy you can get out of such a small amount of fuel (this also explains how Pelicans can maneuver in space where normal jet propulsion, relying on combustion with oxygen, would fail), however nuclear propulsion is very early days at the moment, with no craft using it. If it were to happen, it would most likely come out of space travel development, but I wouldn't hold your breath, good old jellywobblers do their job just fine for now."

StarshipPorn,2pyp3u,evildead4075,11,Sun Dec 21 10:58:35 2014 UTC,According to the Halo Wiki it's used for orbit to surface transport.

StarshipPorn,2pt9fc,Jumbify,3,Fri Dec 19 19:04:05 2014 UTC,When is that game going to come out?
StarshipPorn,2pt9fc,Boonaki,3,Sat Dec 20 03:22:04 2014 UTC,"Its set to have a full release for roughly the later half of 2016. But large chunks of the game will be finished before then, for example the first singleplayer episode will be release late 2015."
StarshipPorn,2pt9fc,KserDnB,2,Sat Dec 20 03:26:22 2014 UTC,"You sound like you know a fair bit about the game.  What's the graphics going to be like?  The gameplay elements?  Will it actually live up to its hype or will it just be another one of many, many let downs who promised a lot to get funding money and then delivered fuck all?"
StarshipPorn,2pt9fc,KserDnB,3,Sat Dec 20 04:04:47 2014 UTC,"The graphics are expected to be world class upon release - Here are some pictures of the game's graphics right now: http://imgur.com/a/0LELP  They are calling the game a ""First Person Universe"", it is primarily made up of space sim and FPS elements.   I think it will live up the vast majority of the hype - they have the ability to pull this off. Currently 300+ employees are working on the game spread across ~5 studios.   Just check out their ""about the game"" webpage, it's really well done:  https://robertsspaceindustries.com/about-the-game/spaceflight"
StarshipPorn,2pt9fc,ExcelMN,3,Sat Dec 20 04:25:43 2014 UTC,"Well it sure does look amazing!  In the past few years I just don't even bother getting excited for games because they usually end up being well.. enourmous dissapointments, but some of the things I heard about this game... I even heard there are some FPS elements to it where you can breach other ships and take it over etc.  Definitely looking forward to it from what I've read before but making that mental leap to ""excited"" is pretty hard haha.   THE GAME DOESN’T STOP WHEN YOU LAND   Star Citizen’s world isn’t just flying spacecraft. A fully-featured FPS mode lets you disembark and take the fight to the enemy… or to explore distant worlds, or navigate city streets in search of the perfect upgrade. We’re building a first person universe, not just the space between stars  That big just gives me the biggest gamer boner but who knows how it'll actually be open release haha, and because there isn't as much footage as I'd like out right now I guess I'll just take your word on it haha, I am now definitely excited.  -edit-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-xvCg8CI9U  o m g"
StarshipPorn,2pt9fc,KserDnB,3,Sat Dec 20 06:40:02 2014 UTC,"They put up videos of the FPS unveil, btw - they hired illfonic to focus on and work that up.   Damage models track by limb (head, torso, upper/lower left/right arms/legs).  different kinds of damage require different response (light can be dealt with via medpack type field treatment, heavy requires getting to an actual aid station, and total is ""you're going to bleed out if you dont get to an aid station and oh yeah you need a prosthetic now"".  Injuries to legs remove your ability to walk or crawl, necessitating the new dragging mechanics.  Gravity and air come into play - if someone isnt in a space suit you can just pop an airlock or suck the air out on them.  If they dont have maneuver jets, you can turn the gravity off to screw them over.    Equipment is limited to what your inventory can carry.  Inventory is based on what you're wearing (clothes are gear, like any mmo, but they dont add stats).   Didnt wear cargo pants or a tac vest?  Good luck, you only had room for a pistol and a space mag.  You cant carry everything, so intelligent choices and load balancing among your people is going to come into play.  Also, equipment works on a rock-paper-scissors type thing.  Oh, you have nightvision goggles?  Flares are going to fuck that up.  Robot arm, gives you more stable aim?  Emp is going to kill that arm, at least for a while, so you have to switch to pistol.  Theres more, but cant remember the other things mentioned."

Just think of all craft out there as a having specific niche or roll that they would fill within the theatre of their operations; and their name is a designation of that. Fighters typically are designed to go toe to toe with other fighters. Intercepters function as mission denial against enemy reconnaissance and bombers. Bombers carry large ordnance to damage large targets. Heavy fighters would fill the gap between fighter and bomber functions, or are beefed up for longer mission duration."
StarshipPorn,2pd10u,Bahgel,2,Tue Dec 16 23:04:50 2014 UTC,"Exactly. Also, eventually there will be additional ""lines"" or ""makes"" of ships of various types.

It was 1988 level graphics, but you actually built the engines, weapon systems, etc. People could beam onto your ships and sabotage them, you in turn would defend the ships.

StarshipPorn,2obwyy,sto-ifics42,36,Fri Dec 5 03:44:46 2014 UTC,"The Bowl of Heaven is a very literal starship in more ways than one - not only does it travel among the stars, it actually uses one as its engine! Plasma ejected by the star is directed along a single beam using immense magnetic fields, providing thrust. The ship itself, a centrifuge a hundred million miles across, is then pulled along by gravity. The centrifuge has a habitable surface area that completely dwarfs that of Earth, able to hold countless species and civilizations as the solar-system-size vessel careens through interstellar/-galactic space.  A more detailed explanation of the design can be found here."
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,xSARGEx117x,38,Fri Dec 5 03:45:09 2014 UTC,"While it is an intriguing thought, it's even more absurd than a Dyson sphere.   It would take the resources of a Tier III civilization.   But it would be so cool, who cares about the resources required! :D"
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,Jonruy,11,Fri Dec 5 04:41:32 2014 UTC,"While it is an intriguing thought, it's even more absurd than a Dyson sphere.    Tell me about it... I don't even know where to begin to do the math, but exactly how much of the galaxy would you need to consume just to produce this monstrosity? Assuming all it took was just an amount of raw mass - not even considering whether or not you had the right kinds elements and materials - how many solar systems worth of planets would you have to refine to build this?"
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,karadan100,16,Fri Dec 5 09:08:14 2014 UTC,"One would think a hell of a lot of 'exotic' matter would be required to make the super-dense base material.   It'd certainly make graveyards out of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of solar systems.   How would you steer it?  So many questions. Love the ridiculous scale though. Larry Niven always did like his mega-structures. Ringworld was an amazing book."
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,Jonruy,11,Fri Dec 5 09:16:55 2014 UTC,"One would think a hell of a lot of 'exotic' matter would be required to make the super-dense base material.   You'd need scrith - the stuff Ringworld was made out of, with tensile strength on the order of nuclear binding energies."
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,Jonruy,7,Fri Dec 5 15:42:13 2014 UTC,"Would it really, though? Or was that just a thing the author made up that sounds really strong?"
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,Reaperdude97,11,Fri Dec 5 16:20:03 2014 UTC,"Solar-system-size structures like Ringworld or the Bowl of Heaven produce artificial gravity by spinning like a centrifuge. This creates absurdly massive tensile stresses in the structure, on the order of 70 petapascals. For comparison, carbon nanotubes have the highest tensile strength of any known material, at 70 gigapascals - a million times too weak to build a megacentrifuge. Hence the use of ""scrith,"" a fictional substance used by Niven in his sci-fi works which has a tensile strength far exceeding that of any known substance."
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,Captain_English,2,Fri Dec 5 16:41:23 2014 UTC,What if the structure were to generate artificial gravity through more traditional (for sci-fi) methods? Any species capable of creating a Bowl of Heaven would have to have access to FTL engines (or else construction would take eons) besides having to be able to manufacture this mythical scrith. Couldn't they have developed a more sophisticated method of generating gravity by that point as well?
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,karadan100,6,Fri Dec 5 17:28:24 2014 UTC,"Good hard sci-fi minimizes breaks from reality, and when it does introduce unrealistic elements it constrains them with sensible & consistent limitations. We know from our own history that materials science advances as time marches on; perhaps Niven found it more sensible to have super-advanced aliens using super-advanced materials rather than granting them magical spacetime-warping abilities. Besides, if a species was able to weave spacetime on such a scale, the whole star-drive idea would be completely unnecessary, because they'd have a gravity drive at their disposal.  (this might be explained better in the books featuring the Bowl, but I have not read them)"
StarshipPorn,2obwyy,Captain_English,2,Fri Dec 5 19:07:28 2014 UTC,"Hmm, we do NOT need to make it that intense do we? A more realistic concept would be a Dyson Swarm that could interconnect, and then direct the plasma through the dyson swarm. The dyson swarm could be computing and storage systems, which could simulate envirnoments that are thousands of times larger than the bowl of heaven."

StarshipPorn,2o1w0h,Decepticon1,10,Tue Dec 2 15:35:17 2014 UTC,"In case you where wondering about any of the math.  It was travelling at 209 854 720.6 m/s or 755 476 994 km/hr or 469 431 641 miles/hr (for you Americans).  If it took 6 years relative to Earth the people on the ship people would only experience 4.28 years of travel time due to relativity (according to this formula). If it was 6 years ship time people on Earth would have experienced 8.4 years.  The total distance traveled was around 4.2 light years if it was 6 years relative to Earth or 5.88 light years if it was 8.4 years relative to Earth.  If the ship was launched from Earth I would guess it's destination to be Proxima Centauri (4.2 light years from Earth) or Barnard's Star (5.96 light years from Earth) depending on which time frame you go with.  Edit*  Just some more facts and a simple explanation. Formula used before can also be used  to calculate the distortion of not only time but mass and size as well. If you plug 1 in for t then you get 1.4 out as a result for t1. That number indicates the value of distortion. So your mass would increase by a factor of 1.4 (10kg to 14kg), the length of a space craft would decrease by a factor of 1.4 (140 meters to 100 meters) and time experienced by the people on the ship would decrease by 1.4 (6 years to 4.22 years or 8.4 years to 6 years).

Who the hell fights in Low-Planet-Orbit within kilometers of each other!?  This entire battle sequence will never ever happen to any space-faring hyper-intelligent species.    What bothers me insanely about the Star Wars universe is that they obviously have the technology to engage in warfare that spans lightyears.   They have drones.  They apparently have nearly limitless energy production (enough to raze, even destroy entire planets).    Why the fuck are they doing close-broadside combat when they obviously have the tech to fight from immense distances?  Battles should take place across an entire star system.. maybe even multiple star systems.  In the scale we're talking about.. it's an entire galaxy with possibly trillions upon trillions of sentient intelligent beings.  I have no idea why battles are only between hundreds of fighters and dozens of ships grouped close together.. it should be tens of thousands of capital ships; each with expendable droid bombers with precision strike capabilities that span entire systems.  With drones tech, and ability to remotely operate stuff.. there's absolutely no need to individually pilot ""fighters."" (Ender's game and their carriers and drone fighters).  Battles are fought by lobbing missiles that go into light speed, then appear out of nowhere to destroy entire fleets.  (Read the Hyperion series.. space battles are actually conducted in this fashion; and close-in combat is just a terrible exchange of energies where it's essentially a mutually assured destruction).    Also, during this particular sequence, the goddamn Jedi's could've easily used their force powers to deflect those incoming buzzdroids missiles.  goddamn man.     Star Wars military doctrine is the most impractical display of space fighting ever.     And don't get me started about the deathstar.  It's a ton lot more energy efficient to lob huge asteroids at a planet to destroy it then it is to lob enough energy to a planet enough so that it explodes with immense force.. essentially insane overkill to destroy the population of a planet."
StarshipPorn,2nyf3j,DanTMWTMP,7,Tue Dec 2 05:19:16 2014 UTC,"I'm late to the discussion but the ships are this close together because The Separatists launched more of a raid than an invasion, they jumped so that they were just outside the planetary shield and moved in. They took too long to complete their objective and the Republic Fleet arrived, since the Separatists were inside the shield they had to move in point blank range to engage them. Also in The Return of The Jedi, The rebels move right against the Imperials so that if the Death Star fired again there would be Imperial collateral damage from the blast"
StarshipPorn,2nyf3j,GAR_66,6,Thu Dec 4 22:29:13 2014 UTC,"Deathstars are a total counter-measure to the Yuuzhan Vong. And the whole series is rule-of-cool, like why are there giant walkers being used on a moon entirely comprised of one gigantic forest? Or why don't the jedi/sith use the force more creatively, like dismantling your opponent's lightsabre?  It is all because it's way cooler to do it how they do. You are a goddamn liar if you don't think that opening battle between the Republic and the C.I.S. was visually impressive."
StarshipPorn,2nyf3j,MaserPhaser,3,Tue Dec 2 14:43:50 2014 UTC,"Actually, the fighters are only drones in the movie.  In the book, the planet which Ender became governor of had a fighter pilot as its mayor before his arrival.  Edit: Forgot to put Ender's name in."
StarshipPorn,2nyf3j,karmakeeper1,3,Tue Dec 2 05:33:36 2014 UTC,"Wait, what!? They were drones in the movie?! That takes away a portion of the impact of it all, I think."

StarshipPorn,2nyf3j,karmakeeper1,3,Tue Dec 2 15:49:30 2014 UTC,Guns on bottom or on top create a larger target for the enemy though.

StarshipPorn,2mgkbu,CorFace,3,Mon Nov 17 01:12:33 2014 UTC,I think I watched that show mainly for the occasional glimpse of that ship.
StarshipPorn,2mgkbu,TheIrateGlaswegian,4,Thu Nov 20 19:24:33 2014 UTC,"As much as I enjoyed Stargate: Atlantis, I never really took to the Daedulus; it looked flat and uninteresting. I think my main problem is that all the edges are too straight, the odd curve here and there would have been nice. The Battlestars from the modern BSG, which were similarly styled with their parallel launchbays, look better with the subtle curves. I suppose there was an element to it that said ""This is flat and uninteresting looking, therefore it must be Terran"", but I would have liked something a wee bit more iconic.  [edit: Utilitarian. That was the word I was trying to think of that sums up the Daedalus. Function over form.]"
StarshipPorn,2mgkbu,drmacinyasha,9,Sun Nov 16 20:48:55 2014 UTC,"I used to feel the same, until I finally realized why it looks like a giant table with a dong sticking off the front: It, and the Prometheus before it, were both originally designed as missile ships.  It's less of a spaceship, and more of an SSBM with two aircraft hangars strapped on the sides, and an aircraft carrier's conn tower taped on (with the bridge not in said conn tower)."
StarshipPorn,2mgkbu,TheIrateGlaswegian,2,Mon Nov 17 02:50:05 2014 UTC,"I'll give you that. Kind of like the A10 Tankbuster is a plane wrapped around an Avenger cannon, and is widely considered (wrongly, in IMO) to be an bloody ugly plane. Again, function over form. I still think Daedalus could have done with a few curves here and there, though."

I thought it was ugly, but it made sense why they did the design the way they did.  Also definitely watching lots of Stargate this weekend..."

If they really needed to see out, as if through a window, they would just put up some displays. They could have a little sensor arrays all across the hull of the ship as well. As it stands you bomb the central sensor array, and bomb the one bridge.  It does look good though. I like it."

Instead, it explodes, leading to:   OFFICER: Sir! We've lost our bridge deflector shields!  PIETT: Intensify the forward batteries! I don't want anything to get through.   Even so, the A-wing kamikaze shouldn't have been enough to down Executor on its own. Executor would have -- and did -- have several backup bridges.

The entire notion of the giant globes as related to shields is a confluence of hasty assumptions due to editing and then unchecked secondary source nonsense, largely stemming from game mechanics.

StarshipPorn,2lcykm,FiberOptik,11,Wed Nov 5 13:27:15 2014 UTC,"I don't know that much about Star Trek, so I was wondering, How many Enterprises got totally destroyed? Was there ever a point in the universe when there were more than one of them flying simultaneously?  Awesome pic btw."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,karadan100,31,Wed Nov 5 17:28:35 2014 UTC,"There were 7 Starfleet ships that bore the name Enterprise. None of them served alongside each other, the name is usually transferred to the next new flagship of the fleet built when the last one is retired or destroyed. Here's a rundown of the ships.  It starts with the NX-01 which was chronologically the first even though it was on the last aired series, Enterprise. This was earth's first exploratory ship and survived long enough to be retired at the end of the series and be put into Starfleet's Museum fleet.  Then 100 years later comes Kirk's ship, the NCC-1701 Enterprise that was shown in the 60's series plus the first 3 films. It was destroyed in order to save Spock and protect the secrets of the Genesis planet.  The 1701-A is given to Kirk at the end of the fourth film after he saved humanity for the 30th or so time. This ship survived until the last original series movie where Kirk and Co. retired. This ship was given to a new crew and we have no information about it afterwards.  The Enterprise B was only shown for about 15 minutes in the 7th film during it's shakedown cruise. No information after that.  The Enterprise C was shown in an episode of The Next Generation after coming forward in time during the mission it was supposed to have been destroyed in. This mucks up the timeline so it has to go back and be destroyed by the Romulans so history can be restored. This is the only time that I can think of with 2 different Enterprises at the same time and place.  The Big D was Picard's ship during the run of The Next Generation and was destroyed by the Klingons during Generations, the first TNG movie. Interestingly during one episode the barriers between timelines break down and there are over 1000 Enterprise Ds in the same region simultaneously.  The Enterprise E is the ship from the remaining three TNG movies, again captained by Picard. It survives in the last film and is still serving the fleet.  So that's one in active duty, one retired, 3 destroyed, and 2 unknown.  There is also an appearance by the future Enterprise J for about 5 minutes of screen time in Enterprise so there is presumably Enterprises F, G, H, and I at some point as well but we never see them.  The D was shown destroyed many times throughout the run of TNG, including 5 times in one episode and 3 in another but there was always some timeline trick to getting out of it, until the movie anyway. The NX-01 was also destroyed once (that I can think of) during it's run as well, of course that was reversed as well. Kirk's somehow managed to be only destroyed once even though he was the most reckless of the bunch.  Was that too much info for a relatively simple question? Yeah, probably. But I needed some sort of distraction instead of actually doing my work."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,phaser_on_overload,9,Wed Nov 5 18:45:44 2014 UTC,"The 1701-A was actually decommissioned at the end of Star Trek VI, so it wasn't given to a new crew, it was either mothballed or salvaged for scrap.  Other than that good stuff. :)"
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,feor1300,6,Wed Nov 5 20:10:56 2014 UTC,"No it wasn't.  ""Captain's log, stardate 9529.1. This is the final cruise of the starship Enterprise under my command. This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew. To them and their posterity will we commit our future. They will continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man, where no one, has gone before.""  Final line of the film, right before Kirk flies the Enterprise into a White Dwarf, killing them all... Or did he?  No, no he didn't."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,phaser_on_overload,13,Wed Nov 5 20:50:05 2014 UTC,"Except for Uhura's last statement, that they're to report for decommissioning. You decommission a ship, you retire a crew. The only people the ship was going to be given to was the crew of the salvage yard.  Nothing wrong with that though. She had a good run."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,feor1300,4,Wed Nov 5 20:59:17 2014 UTC,"Huh that's strange, I never really noticed the disconnect with those lines before. It doesn't make sense that way, why would kirk get all misty and philosophical about sending the ship to be stripped and hung in a museum?  That would make it being the refit of the Yorktown make sense, though. They wouldn't decommission a 7 year old ship but a 30-40 year old ship that they slapped on new signage when they gave it to Kirk would be believable.  Beyond that she had a so so run as the Enterprise, Kirk battling god and stopping an assassination plot pales in comparison to the 1701 proper. But at least the Museum Fleet can genuinely say they have Kirk's ship.  Plus they had probably been planning this for years seeing as the B was launched later that year.  You've given me something to mull, I like it."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,phaser_on_overload,2,Wed Nov 5 21:18:43 2014 UTC,"I think that line was supposed to be a nod towards TNG. As in he wasn't saying ""this ship is getting a new crew"", he was saying ""the spirit of the Enterprise will live on in a new ship with a new crew""."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,Lord_Wibblington,3,Tue Nov 11 09:59:01 2014 UTC,"The Enterprise-class was obsolete in its role at the time of the 6th film.  The entire role was being taken over by the Excelsior-class ships.  I think that, had the big E not gotten shot to shit at the end of STVI, they probably would have let Kirk & Co. sail around for a while longer doing Kirk stuff.  But since it was basically trashed, Starfleet probably said, look, you've had a good run, but it's just not worth fixing that ship up."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,pimpmyrind,5,Thu Nov 6 01:13:45 2014 UTC,What's an Enterprise-class?
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,BigBassBone,3,Thu Nov 6 07:30:43 2014 UTC,"Depends on what head-canon to which you subscribe:   The NX in NX-01 is thought to be registry code for 'Explorer' type ship (versus destroyer, cruiser, etc). That would allow Enterprise (NX-01) to be the lead ship of the Enterprise class. (Most believe, though, the NX stands for 'experimental' -as it would be in the later UFP Starfleet- and have just called the whole class 'NX' instead of 'Enterprise') Some consider the massive refit of the Constitution-class Enterprise in 2270 (into the first movie version) to represent a new class of ship and since some sources seem to suggest Enterprise was the first to receive the refit, this new class should be named after her. A similarly sized camp, however, feels the term 'Constitution refit' (or Constitution  II) is the best nautical method and subscribe to there not being an Enterprise class (unless they believe the NX-01 was the lead ship of that class).   Side-note: if there had been another season of Star Trek:ENT, there were plans to add a secondary/engineering hull onto the ship. As the ship -in canon- was decommissioned without that happening (and the show canceled), some sources suggest the extension was added to the Columbia NX-02 and named the Columbia class (by ADM Archer), which would support the concept of the -1701 being the lead ship of an Enterprise class centuries later...but calling an NX-registered ship a member of the Columbia class suggests those of the original configuration were of the Enterprise class...first.   I myself go for the Enterprise class being the first Enterprise and the -1701 and -1701A being upgraded Connies."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,Coopering,2,Thu Nov 6 10:53:47 2014 UTC,"The refit connies were all ""Constitution class.""  IIRC the purpose-built version (whatever was rechristened Enterprise-A) was the Enterprise-class.  There's precedence in the US Navy at least...the Ticonderogas are just upgraded Spruance-class vessels, and IIRC there were several Sprucans that we sold to Iran in the days of the Shah that had their own class even though they are the exact same frame."

StarshipPorn,2lcykm,jadesaber2,7,Wed Nov 5 20:48:19 2014 UTC,"I doubt they'd save the -A, it wasn't particularly historic. The original 1701 was the one that did all the famous stuff.

StarshipPorn,2lcykm,BrockN,5,Thu Nov 6 00:12:41 2014 UTC,The saucer section is 30 decks thick (thicker than the entire Enterprise D). There are also no turbolifts in the J; you get around via site-to-site transporter.   The J is 'Universe Class'. Its primary mission is to explore other galaxies. The ship is also 3 miles in length.
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,supergalactic,2,Thu Nov 6 04:05:23 2014 UTC,Seems like you'd want backup transportation since the transporters failing seems to be a weekly occurrence.

The TOS Enterpise (NCC-1701)  The Ambassador Class Enterprise (NCC-1701-C)  The Galaxy Class Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)  Now, when a new Enterprise enters service, it usually means that the previous one was either retired because it had reached the end of it's service life or destroyed, no two Enterprise's ever served at the same time."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,StarTrekMike,6,Wed Nov 5 18:04:15 2014 UTC,Is it just me or do there seem to be a great many aesthetic similarities between 1701-D and the Dreadnought from STID?
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,AgentLocke,2,Wed Nov 5 16:09:10 2014 UTC,1701-E looks more like a Dreadnought. Mainly because Sovereign is more combat-oriented.

StarshipPorn,2lcykm,belinck,3,Wed Nov 5 17:07:51 2014 UTC,"I feel like it is too busy looking, it has a nice shape but they put too many small details into it that kinda ran contrary to the whole idea that Starfleet ships are supposed to have clean looking hulls.  To put it more bluntly, it looks like they were going out of their way to make it look ""cool"" as opposed to elegant."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,StarTrekMike,1 point,Wed Nov 5 18:06:28 2014 UTC,"I think it makes it look more ready for war, It's squat streamlined, and doesn't look like the expended as much effort on the outsides as they did on the inside, possibly reinforcements too."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,Jeffgoldbum,1 point,Fri Nov 7 16:08:09 2014 UTC,"The increasing level of detail over the course of Trek history pretty closely matches how sharp the picture would be to the expected audience.  TOS got away with a lot of kludges in the effects and design department because most everybody was watching on small, low-quality displays with fuzzy reception.  It wasn't even a sure bet they'd have color.  This remained true, with minor improvements, up through TNG.  DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and the TNG movies all took place where even on a TV rebroadcast a significant chunk of people would be watching on cable, and there were DVD releases pushing the boundaries of 640x480 NTSC.  The JJPrise would look like shit in any of those historic formats, but in 16:9 1920x1080 or better, it shines."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,tidux,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:02:07 2014 UTC,"I would say that the JJPrise is actually a return to the elegance and simplicity that we saw in TOS, the films, and TNG."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,StarTrekMike,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:17:02 2014 UTC,"In broad strokes, sure, but there's a ton of smaller details that wouldn't have worked well at lower resolutions, like the subtle spinning lights pattern on the nacelles, or the warp effect.  That balance is actually why I like the JJPrise design - they even scaled it properly so the shuttlebay door size makes sense compared to the actual deck layout."
StarshipPorn,2lcykm,tidux,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:18:54 2014 UTC,"I think you really hit on why the JJPrise design really works for me, it has lots of detail but it is subtle, it still maintains a very clean looking hull with consistent colors and a very elegant and sleek look.  The Sovereign class just feels very cluttered in comparison, lots of details that look very cool but don't really give the ship any lasting power besides how ""cool"" and ""badass"" it looks."

StarshipPorn,2lcykm,kakatoru,3,Wed Nov 5 18:15:29 2014 UTC,I've always thought that the Defiant was one of the uglier ships. Kinda stubby and squished. But I'm wierd like that.

The enterprise is dripping on raw power, seeing it take off into orbit at the beginning of into darkness it felt like the first ship to feel like it could accelerate to hundreds of time the speed of light in the blink of an eye."

StarshipPorn,2lbqfd,GeminiOfSin,0,Wed Nov 5 09:11:00 2014 UTC,"So you'd think the Enterprise E would have been a part of some of these battles, almost certainly this one in particular. It would have been cool, even just as a cameo, to see Picard winging the E through the battle fucking up scarabs as they go.   But yeah, it was Sisko's time to shine and I don't remember if there was any in-movie explanation for their absence."

StarshipPorn,2l3go6,Decepticon1,18,Sun Nov 2 21:07:46 2014 UTC,"""The ISV Venture Star, and the other ships of its class, represent the highest technological achievement in human history.""  Blueprint  ""The starship ISV Venture Star from the movie Avatar is one of the most scientifically accurate movie spaceships it has ever been my pleasure to see. When I read the description of the ship, I got a nagging feeling that something was familiar. A ship with the engines on the nose, towing the rest of the ship like a water-skier? Wait a minute, that sounds like Charles Pellegrino and Jim Powell's Valkyrie starship.  Well, as it turns out, there was a good reason for that. James Cameron likes scientific accuracy in his movies. So he looked for a scientist who had experience with designing starships. Cameron didn't have to look far. As it turns out he already knew Dr. Pellegrino. This is because Dr. Pellegrino had worked with Cameron on a prior movie, since Dr. Pellegrino is one of the worlds greatest living experts on the Titanic.  After James Cameron had designed all the technical parameters of the Venture Star, master artist Ben Procter worked within those parameters to bring it to life.""  Labeled picture  ""In the upper diagram is a green arrow at the ship's nose, indicating the direction of flight. The ship is 1.5 kilometers long. In the Sol departure phase, a battery of orbital lasers illuminates a 16 kilometer diameter photon sail attached to the ship's nose (sail not shown). A mirror shield on the ship's rear prevents the laser beams from damaging the ship. The lasers accelerate the ship at 1.5 g for 0.46 year. At the end of this the ship is moving at 70% the speed of light (210,000 kilometers per second).""  More information here"

StarshipPorn,2l3go6,Fraun_Pollen,11,Sun Nov 2 22:53:39 2014 UTC,"More stats  The ISV Venture Star can carry a large payload of cargo and passengers to establish commercial and scientific outposts on alien worlds. The ship's current mission is the exploitation of indigenous resources on Pandora, and is one of twelve ISVs that travel between Earth and Pandora on a continuing basis.  Size: Length = 1,502.4 meters; Width = 302.25 meters; Height = 218.3 meters.   Range:  4.4 light-years. This range is set by onboard fuel supply and its containment system, and the life-support consumables, and the infrastructure needed to contain them. Because each gram of mass must be accelerated and decelerated (as well as the onboard fuel to accomplish this), every possible weight-saving measure has been taken. The ship carries only enough fuel for the planned mission profile, and a minimal amount of additional maneuvering. There are only enough supplies for the minimum crew needed to remain out of cryosleep. Air, water, and food must be replenished at Pandora, and the ship refueled there with locally-manufactured anti-matter and hydrogen and deuterium harvested from Polyphemus.  *Cruising speed: * 210,000 kilometers per second (70% of lightspeed, or 0.7 c).  Maximum Acceleration: 1.5 g.  Mission Profile:  0.46 year initial acceleration @ 1.5 g to reach 0.7 c; 5.83 years cruise @ 0.7 c; 0.46 year deceleration; 1 year loiter in orbit around Pandora; 0.46 year acceleration @ 1.5 g to 0.7 c for return trip; 5.83 years cruise; 0.46 year final deceleration @ 1.5 g to go into orbit around Earth.  Mission Duration: 6.75 + 1.0 + 6.75 = 14.5 Earth years. However, relativistic effects shorten the time onboard ship to slightly less than 6 years each way.   Engines: Two, arranged symmetrically in a tractor configuration. They are angled outward a few degrees off the ship’s longitudinal axis so their exhaust plumes bypass the ship’s structure. This results in a slight cosine loss to thrust efficiency, and the body of the ship must be shielded from the plume’s thermal radiation, but the mass-savings advantage of a tensile structure outweigh these disadvantages. Since a very long truss is needed to separate the habitable section of the ship from the engines which produce large amounts of radiation, such a structure would be prohibitively massive if it were a conventional space-frame truss designed for compressive loading. But the carbon-nanotube composite tensile-truss creates the necessary stand-off distance at one tenth the mass. Essentially it is a tow cable with enough torsional rigidity to allow the ship to maneuver, including the pitch-over maneuver which must be performed to turn 180 degrees for the deceleration burn when inbound to Pandora.  A matter-antimatter reaction causes the total conversion of matter into energy, as per Einstein’s famous formula of E = mc2. The antimatter (in this case anti-hydrogen) is contained by a magnetic field in a near-perfect vacuum in which it circulates as a high density cloud of atoms cooled to near-absolute-zero temperature. When antimatter and matter (normal hydrogen) are brought together, they mutually annihilate and produce an enormous amount of energy, which must be directed by an ultra-powerful magnetic field to form the exhaust plume. These photons of energy, although massless, possess momentum, and their ejection provides the thrust to accelerate the ship. Additional thrust is obtained by injecting hydrogen atoms into the plasma before it leaves the engines. The exhaust flare is an incandescent plasma a million times brighter than a welding arc, and over thirty kilometers long. The plume is considered to be one of the most spectacular man-made sights in history.  Structure: The ship's primary structure (which could only exist in zero gravity) consists of the two side-by-side engines attached to a tensile-truss of carbon-nanotube composite. This connects the propulsion section to the payload section, which includes habitation modules for crew, the cryovaults for passengers, amnio tanks for the avatars, and the cargo section.  Navigation: 1. Three-axis triangulation from reference stars during cruse phase. 2. Radar ranging when in proximity to planets and satellites. 3. Synthetic-aperture side-looking radar for surface mapping purposes.  Lightspeed Communications: 1. Modulation of beamed power by ±0.1% for high bit-rate uplink during acceleration and deceleration phases. 2. Pulse-width modulated dedicated lasers for downlink and uplink when not using beamed power – bit rate dependent on distance 3. Standard VHF/UHF radio for short-range communication between orbit and ground.  Cryosleep System:  The individual passenger compartments are equipped to freeze their occupants solid and maintain them at a very low temperature until the end of the voyage, when they are gradually re-warmed and thawed out. The problem of irreparable cell damage caused by the formation of intra-cellular ice crystals that stymied 20th Century life-extension attempts was solved by using low doses of microwave radiation to jostle the water molecules as the temperature drops, and completely prevents the formation of any ice crystals. The failure rate of this process is less than 1%, and passengers and their heirs release the RDA for any liability as a condition of their employment.  Crew: 25  The ship’s functioning is largely automated, using triply-redundant, radiation-hardened computers, but emergency manual control is provided for all functions. The minimal crew is cross-trained in all specialties. There are three crew teams of five each, who serve for 20-month tours, and are in cryosleep for the balance of the voyage. This seeming waste of mass was necessitated by the experience of mid- 21st Century space missions when crew members proved psychologically unstable after two years in close confinement. There are two main functions of the human crew: monitoring the power and propulsion systems, and supervising the developing avatars. Humans have the ability to notice anomalies too subtle for the automated monitors, in spite of these systems’ tremendous sophistication. In addition to the 15 flight crew there are 10 medical crew in cryosleep, who are awakened before the rest of the passengers to assist with their recovery from suspension.  Passengers: 200  The passengers are placed in cryosleep so that they do not require any air, water, or food for the duration of the journey. Typical outbound passengers are replacements for RDA personnel, troopers, and avatar operators. Inbound passengers are limited to those who have finished their tour of duty. Unfortunately, the cost of shipping back personnel precludes returning individuals still under contract who have medical problems that cannot be treated on Pandora, so they are euthanized there. The only exception to this policy is for high-level RDA executives.  Cargo Capacity: 350 metric tons Pandora to Earth  Cargo, outbound:  1. Universal object-manufacturing system (In-situ Stereolighography plant). This can produce large, complex objects from data describing their three-dimensional form and material composition. Using raw materials obtained on Pandora, construction and mining equipment far too large and massive to be shipped from Earth can be produced, along with any replacement parts that are needed. Smaller items such as weapons and furniture, are also created, using design data brought from Earth. Locally-designed items are made as well, or modifications of existing designs. 2. Micro-miniaturized components like mirco- and nanoprocessors and other circuitry elements that cannot be manufactured on Pandora. 3. Data modules. Currently, photochromic glass holographic data-storage cubes are used, each one-centimeter cube containing 100 Petabytes of triply-error-corrected data. Typical imported data includes the specifications for equipment to be manufactured on Pandora. 4. Two Valkyrie shuttlecraft for transfer of personnel and cargo between the orbiting ISV and the surface of Pandora. These vessels are left at Pandora, to replace those from previous missions that have exceeded their design life as manned vehicles. The replaced craft are re-purposed to serve as automated gas harvesters, skimming through Polyphemus’s upper atmosphere to obtain hydrogen and deuterium for refueling the ISV. 5. Developing avatars in amnio tanks. 6. Drugs and other medications that cannot be produced locally.  *Cargo, inbound: * 1. Refined unobtanium. This is the ISV’s raison d’etre. It takes precedence over all other items, including returning employees if there is no available mass capacity. 2. Data modules as described above. Typical exported data includes the molecular structure of Pandoran organic compounds that may have medical or other applications on Earth. The data will be used to synthesize them for testing and eventual sale. 3. Small Na’vi artifacts to be sold as collectables to wealthy individuals for extremely high prices.   *Potential Hazards: * The Venture Star is a vast collection of complex interlocking technologies built to travel from one star system to another in the shortest time without killing the crew and damaging the cargo. At the incredible speed it travels, the ship could be destroyed by colliding with debris larger than a grain of sand. Although statistically rare given the emptiness of space, it is believed that a collision over the life of the ship is possible. Another danger is radiation generated by impacts of smaller particles with the debris shield. These gamma rays result from the incredible speed (0.7 c) of the particle with respect to the ship. If the ship should happen to encounter a high concentration of dust grains, the on-duty crew could receive a lethal dose. Since individuals in cryosleep are more resistant to radiation damage, in such an event automated sensors would awaken one of the other crew teams from cryosleep after the radiation level decreased."
