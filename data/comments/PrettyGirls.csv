PrettyGirls,3dykf0,carpenter,4,Tue Jul 21 00:38:02 2015 UTC,Now that's a face I haven't seen in a long time..
PrettyGirls,3dykf0,Bryman91,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"It's strange the difference between seeing a photograph like this and seeing someone like this in real life. You see the photograph, and you think, ""pretty girl"", then nothing more. You see someone like this in real life, and you think, ""Holy SHIT, who IS that?"". You lose some of your ability to function normally, your heart rate goes up, you become aware of the present moment in a way that you weren't before. It's almost like being in the presence of something dangerous."
