So the Zen master has more of a heritage meaning to me. I study Shorin-Ryu Karate...derived from shaolin Kung fu...which (according to legend) derives from Bodhidharma. It's just a plus for me that he has some really interesting takes on philosophy and I envy his take on life. I wish I was more self aware at more times so I strive to be like him and other martial arts masters. It's all good in my book.

It's a particular take on traditional Okinawan karate by my grandmaster Tadashi Yamashita. I've also recieved my black belt from him. He's a bad man! It's a good reminder for me to stay loose, roll with the punches, and focus speed and power. Under these three symbols I have a hidari-gomon   The finger gesture I'm not so sure. It was on the original painting which also included the reed he was floating on. I believe it may have something to do with that story, the legend that Bodhidharma travelled across a river on a single reed."

Buddhism,3e3d1k,buddhistask,5,Tue Jul 21 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"Rebirth isn't really comforting to Buddhists; in fact, the concept of rebirth is downright scary to us, because it means enduring this cycle of suffering all over again. But fear of death is a good starting point.  See, the thing about all of your concerns is that after listing them out, you never touch on the idea that maybe you don't even exist to begin with. You're trying to unpack the source of this fear in order to overcome it, but you don't realize that the root of the fear itself is how strong your attachment to your own identity is.  But your identity is a fiction. it's like a dream, a ghost that is neither real nor unreal. It's just a composite of different phenomena interacting in a system, but because you perceive a Self exists, you become attached to it, and you don't want it to go away. But the Self is only there in your mind; it doesn't exist in reality.  You must investigate very deeply what you conceive to be your Self. Investigate all phenomena that relates to your experience of Self, that composes your experience of Self, and all phenomena that is not your experience of Self. Then, when you have contemplated this, you should ask yourself: ""So what is Self?""  In all likelihood, you will deduce that Self is mind-manifest, not truly there, empty of essence... merely a concatenation of sensory phenomena across a network. Here, you will realize that your attachment is truly empty, that Self is empty, and that this 'death' you fear is no more real than the Self you perceive as 'alive' and 'I.'"
Buddhism,3e3d1k,animuseternal,3,Tue Jul 21 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"Acceptance conquers the fear of death. Anything born must die and anything that arises must cease. All things arise dependent on other causes and conditions. You see yourself as fixated and stable in a world of instability (hence you see yourself becoming something forever). The reason you think this is because of not properly discerning the impermanence and emptiness of the five aggregates.   The Buddha taught us that we have all lived inconceivable lives in the past, meaning we have all been born and died inconceivable times, yet here we are.   Rebirth won't be understood unless you learn about the 12 links of dependent origination.   You should learn about what the Buddha taught. You are experiencing stress, suffering and dis-ease (dukkha) and that is what the Buddha explicitly addresses. Fear of death will diminish through understanding of impermanence and change. As long as you hold on to the idea of a self being preserved, you will suffer because it simply can't be. The self isn't yours in the first place, it's beneficial to see the five aggregates as they arise and pass away."
Buddhism,3e3d1k,numbersev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"Death scares everybody, even if they would never admit it. They're scared because they know so little about the process of dying. That is why it is important to get as much knowledge as possible on the matter. The method here is simple - the more you know the more confident you become.  Please, check out the Bardo Thodol textbook (known in the west as Tibetan Book of The Dead). It would also be great to read some commentary that would clarify the meaning, for example, this one.

We may sympathise with its rather pitiful existence but perhaps in its mind it is happy with all it has. Perhaps eating from a pile of dung may feel like life's greatest moment to it in its little confined life with limited knowledge of the greater world.   We are just like the fly, life is full of suffering but we yearn for that pile of little pleasure dung again and again that we become terrified of death parting us away from it. Who knows if reincarnation exist the fly might just reincarnate into a better form of life but it doesn't comprehend that idea just as we don't comprehend the idea of Nirvana."

Buddhism,3dy7mo,cyanocobalamin,60,Mon Jul 20 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"for the benefit of those just starting out, talk to us about how 10 years of the practice has benefited you :)."
Buddhism,3dy7mo,Jayantha-sotp,225,Mon Jul 20 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"Back when I was in college I had a class with a professor who was studying the physiology of human stress.   This was decades before there was an article in the news every day about the measured benefits of meditation.  One of these benefits he called ""tropotropic tuning"".     There is a part of our brain called the amygdala that is responsible initiating the fight or flight response ---- what ordinary people call ""stress"".  The professor discovered that not only does a regular, daily mediation practice reverse the fight or flight adaptations after meditation, but it ""tunes"" the amgydala, the brain, to respond to stress faster and then turn off the stress faster -----  you stay calmer all of the time,  in between daily meditations sessions, --- just going about your daily business.  I remember a graph he showed to us comparing the stress responses of meditators and non-meditators to a sudden, surprise, loud noise.  The non-meditors graph was a stretched out bell curve.  The graph for the meditators was a sharp spike.  In other words, meditators response to stress faster and harder -- they get ready for the situation faster.   However, once the situation is over, their system will also power down from stress faster.  This professor taught standard breath meditation in his class.   I kept with it for a while because I enjoyed the deep relaxation.  I also had a number of incidents where I normally would have been freaked out.  Instead I noticed some fast alertness, then complete calm in otherwise disturbing situations.  Magic, aka that ""tropotropic tuning"".  Ten years ago I went through a personal crisis where I felt a lot of anxiety and had trouble sleeping.    I knew that eventually mediation would crank down my every day stress response.  I decided to apply my knowledge from being an ""on again, off again"" meditator to stop sabotaging the maintenance of the daily habit.  I stopped doing the things that caused the maintenance of daily habits to fail.   It worked, I stayed with it.   After several months the anxiety dissipated and my sleeping patterns returned slowly to normal.  In the ten years since the daily mediation practice has made a lot of things what would have been very hard me on me less hard.   I can't say that enough.  My love of meditation led to my explorations of Buddhism.  If I can give one tip based on my experience, aside from practicing consistently, I would say to approach meditation as a relaxation exercise.  All of the good stuff people look for in Buddhist meditation flows effortlessly out of authentic relaxation and letting go.  I relearned this lesson by poking about in a vihara library many years ago and finding a pamphlet of Ajahn Brahm's ( ""A Basic Meditation Method"") shoved behind some ancient books.    Ajahn Brahm makes a big deal about ""letting go"" and relaxing.    It made a big difference for me, even with just feeling comfortable sitting on the floor after 40 min.   Like many other people trying to learn Buddhist meditation through a language barrier the connotations of the words ""concentration"" and ""discipline"" led me to the exact opposite of the ""letting go"" attitude you want in Buddhist meditation.  Ajahn Brahm's pamphlet ""gave me permission"" to do meditation as a relaxation exercise again.   I felt more comfortable sitting on the floor for long periods of time by focusing on relaxation.   My mind also became more ""still"" and without any effort.  FWIW, an alternate translation of of samdhi is ""stillness"" rather than ""concentration"".  Anwyay, back to the benefits of my long experiment with meditation.  Many, many, many hours of simply feeling joy.    Many, many, hours of deep relaxation.      I don't have thought patterns that maximize resilience.   The way I habitually think leans towards making situations worse.    Meditation helped me see that and meditation also helped me remain functional during many hard situations in my life, even with the maladaptive thinking.    Meditation kept the situations at the level of being unpleasant. I think without meditation those situations would have escalated into major health and life problems."

Buddhism,3dy7mo,themadhatter444,7,Mon Jul 20 17:13:36 2015 UTC,Outstanding reply. Thanks for taking the time.  How long is a typical session for you?  Edited for wording.
Buddhism,3dy7mo,UrbanZenMonk,23,Mon Jul 20 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"I started off with 5 minutes with the promise that I would NOT increase the time unless I had an appetite for it.   That was one of the many ways I failed in the past.  I would crank up the time to reach a length goal for my ego and make it feel too demanding on myself.  Then I would blow it off and go ""off again"".  I found that if I genuinely resolved to leave the time alone that I would eventually reach a point where I felt like having a little more time.     I would only increase the time when that happened.  Eventually I worked up to hour long sits.   I never recorded when that happened.  I would have to flip through my old log books to find that.  My WILD guess would be somewhere around the 3rd year."
Buddhism,3dy7mo,UrbanZenMonk,8,Mon Jul 20 17:25:01 2015 UTC,Dude this is exactly my problem and why I can't commit to meditating every day. My ego wants me to go as hard as I can and sit for as long as possible since that's what I was trained to do through out my life in sports and what not.   Im definitely gonna give it another shot now with a way more relaxed approach like yours
Buddhism,3dy7mo,FlyinEye,10,Mon Jul 20 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"I came from a similar background.  It took me being worn to the bone from anxiety and insomnia to stop that.  I was desperate for relief and I knew that the ""tropotropic tuning"" would only come with consistency.   So, I made consistency my only priority.  If I sat down for only 5 minutes I would still applaud myself.   It felt very unnatural."

Buddhism,3dy7mo,belhamster,4,Mon Jul 20 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"I don't have thought patterns that maximize resilience. The way I habitually think leans towards making situations worse. Meditation helped me see that and meditation also helped me remain functional during many hard situations in my life, even with the maladaptive thinking.    That's a big thing with myself, right now. The habitual thinking and making situations worse.  I've actually improved it with an outside source from Buddhism, drumming, as my teacher is more positive. Thus, when doing drumming, my entire perspective is positive, calming, etc.  If I get upset during it, I walk away and take a breather (whether 10 minutes or 3 hours). This is spilling over into other aspects of my life, as well, being able to take situations as they come, be more relaxed, and take positives from it.  Glad you've had such success."
Buddhism,3dy7mo,songhill,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:14 2015 UTC,How does drumming change your thinking?   Is it like taking a hard work out and just getting pumped off of the stimulation?
Buddhism,3dy7mo,khattify,8,Mon Jul 20 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the physical act of drumming or the exercise it provided, though, it does help the physical aspect. I don't feel I need the exercise, though.  What changed my thinking was just how I approached my drumming. I was taught to not become frustrated with it but rather, at the end of each session, take something away that was positive. So, maybe one day I struggle with a new lesson but can take away the fact I did a new lesson. Perhaps the next day, I plow through that lesson, or, perhaps I finally get a new pattern down or perhaps increase my speed a bit or have an arm become more dependent.  The point is really, I was focusing on more positive's, ignoring negative's (leaving me more clear minded with a thought of 'good work' versus 'god damn it' which carries over to something else). Yesterday, I really struggled with an exercise that 5 days ago, I thought I had down. I was starting to become frustrated but stopped, reflected on the idea I've been practicing hard for the past week (1.5-2 hours per day (I work full time, dog, motorcycle, rest of my life)) and thought ""take a break. You've achieved a lot this past week.""  Before, I'd maybe walk away in a huff and puff or toss my drum stick (or whatever it was) at/through the wall. Not productive and not great for the long term. Ruins the joy in it, too.  Drumming just happened to be the device. Bonus is I can really just get into a beat, over and over again, 10 minutes straight, just over and over again. Kind of a meditation of sorts, just absolutely nothing but 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4 (with the beat), feeling my body become more adjusted, become more habitual to how I hit the pads, etc.  ""Stop trying to hit the drum and hit it!"""
Buddhism,3dy7mo,youhaveaprettymouth,4,Mon Jul 20 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks.  Basically, you used drumming as an exercise in noticing the positive instead of sticking onto the negative."

Buddhism,3dy7mo,RaffBluffin,5,Mon Jul 20 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"Well I do both.  I focus on the breath to calm my mind.  Then I go to objectless meditation where I work on letting go and relaxation of the mind.  I hope that makes sense.

Buddhism,3dy7mo,chainlinks,11,Mon Jul 20 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"Every bit does help.  My personal opinion is that it isn't the same thing.  I think meditation, and the effects of being resilient to stress is like jogging in that consistency is everything.   You get more from jogging 15 min every day than taking a hour run every weekend."
Buddhism,3dy7mo,mkpeacebkindbgentle,5,Mon Jul 20 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"It's hard to simply be mindfully aware if you don't meditate, because the mental habits that allow us to be mindfully aware are most easily strengthened through meditation.   If you can manage a walking meditation when you aren't engaged in any other activity, that might help, but ideally you would try to sit consistently if you can.  There's no use beating yourself up if you can't, though.   Just treat it as a puzzle to solve: why aren't you sitting every day?   Don't believe it's useful?   Don't make time?   Aren't getting the results you hoped for when you do sit?   Etc.   Like the OP, my meditation got consistent when I was able to generate some confidence that meditating was worth my time; prior to that, nothing I did would stick."
Buddhism,3dy7mo,fireyou74,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"Everything helps. Remember, mindfulness is a relatively mild form of practice, and traditionally would be used to prepare the meditator for other techniques, or else done all day (eg. in a monastic setting).   If so, ideally you'd want to be doing it a lot (which is not possible for many people)."

Buddhism,3dy7mo,testphase,6,Mon Jul 20 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"My big fear when I started was that the day would have flown by, it would be very late and I would want to, need to go to bed.  I got around that by telling myself that if I didn't get in until 2am, I wouldn't like that, but I wouldn't beat myself up either as the time of day in the present moment was beyond my control.   So, if it was 1am and I still handn't meditated for the day,  I would just ""write it off"" as being ""2am"" and sit anyway, at 1am.  Beyond that I promised myself to try something no matter how brief, unless I was knocked unconscious in the hospital.  Nothing like that happened.  I did end up meditating very, very, very, late a number of time of time over the years, but I never met up with any strong challenges until my 9th year.  Last summer, year number 9,  my sleep issues returned, my last parent died, and my relationship with my GF ended harshly,  all around the same time.    I had a big problem with anxiety.  I was also extremely sleep deprived and panicky for most of the summer and the fall.  If I got very relaxed all sorts of anxiety would come up, in addition to recent memories and memories from my childhood.  The anxiety was more than I could handle and sit still.  I very often ended up doing hour long walking meditations.  I would also do hour sits but I would go in 20 minute segments ( too little to get deeply relaxed enough for anxiety to bubble up ) taking 5-10 minute breaks in between each set."

Buddhism,3e2etu,Jayantha-sotp,4,Tue Jul 21 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"Obsession is always rooted in fear.  To be obsessed with anything--even the Dhamma--is a sign of something unhealed in you that is crying out for healing.  You're looking to the Dhamma to ""save"" you from whatever it is you fear, to help you escape it.  This is not taking refuge in the Dhamma, this is grasping at it as a way to escape your feelings rather than understand them.  The answer: mindfulness.  When you feel the urge to think about or talk about the Dhamma in this obsessive way, stop.  Breathe.  Look deeply.  What are you feeling?  What are you thinking?  What are the roots of this obsession?  If you chose not to think or talk about the Dhamma so much, what would be so bad about that?  Ironically, in this way you are actually practicing the Dhamma instead of thinking about it.  There is a Pali term for this phenomenon, though sadly I can't remember it (I'll try to look it up again).  So you're not unique in this.  Many people become obsessed with reading Buddhist books, talking about Buddhism, etc. thinking that they're being good Buddhists; but actually they're not.  Practicing the Dhamma is always about the middle way: not too much, not too little.  Just enough to maintain the discipline and practice sufficiently, but nothing to an extreme."
Buddhism,3e2etu,DukkhaTales,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:59 2015 UTC,Focus on showing the teachings rather than just talking about them. Teach the dharma through your actions.
Buddhism,3e2etu,B_Vainamoinen,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:35 2015 UTC,"Aroused persistence and energy (one of the factors of enlightenment) due to insight of dhamma. Are you becoming obsessed....or confident? If you have been practicing diligently, you may be on the brink or even within the stream.  Just hold out, keep soaking in knowledge and teachings and practicing in daily life. Understanding will continue to grow and you will hit a point where you can more easily explain it. But the dhamma, although open and evident, is not easily seen by many people. It must be spoken step-by-step (cause and effect). Minds are tuned to 'I' vs 'other' and not causation (the four noble truths)."
Buddhism,3e2etu,numbersev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:58 2015 UTC,"Clearly you are enthusiastic about the Dhamma.  This is good.  The best way to teach it is by example rather than by words that fall on unexcited ears.  Live the Dhamma and when others notice you'll have the experience to answer their needs.  If they don't, don't worry about it.  When the Buddha set out to bring the Dhamma to others he met a wandering ascetic.  The acetic noticed his clear appearance and asked ""Who is your guru?"" The Buddha explained that he was self enlightened.  The acetic remarked ""it may be so friend"" then walked away not wanting to hear more."
Buddhism,3e2etu,Rks1157,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"Less thinking, more doing.  It is very easy to get excited about an intellectual understanding. Not just the dhamma, but in other areas. Practice, bring yourself to the point that you understand the teaching emotionally. Then, it is very easy to discuss, but you will be over the need to overshare."
Buddhism,3e2etu,toothless-tiger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:29:27 2015 UTC,Just don't talk about it to anyone unless they ask questions or want to have a chat about Dhamma.

Buddhism,3e230u,surfersbeware,6,Tue Jul 21 10:42:48 2015 UTC,"Here, 'love' and 'passion' are talking about similar things. Namely, attachment... craving.  Buddhadharma teaches that craving creates suffering. This is the fundamental teaching, the basis of cause and effect that all schools of Buddhism agreed upon. So this is the kind of 'love' and 'passion' being spoken of.  People don't understand 'love'. Ask a thousand different people what it is and you can get a thousand different concepts. What we know of it has been conditioned by countless romantic movies and songs and stories that revolve around the drama created by craving. This is all love 'for me', as if you could get love and -- I don't know -- absorb it or eat it and be fulfilled by it. That's not love.  Love driven by a sense of incompletion isn't love. The incompletion comes from the basic misunderstanding of who we are. One thinks of oneself as separate, and therefore one deeply feels separate; one feels the loss of the universe, the loss of completion; and one's whole life becomes a more or less vague quest to 'get' completion. One seeks it in experiences, states of being, the collection of possessions, the collection of skills and knowledges, and in relationships: ""you complete me"". That's bullshit love.  Real love turns that around. It comes not from a sense of loss and a selfish impetus to grasp and devour something, but from one's original completion. It is not feeling but harmonious response. It is 'for you', because this 'I' is already complete. When we prostate, we prostate to that original completion. The Buddha represents our true, complete, awakened mind. So we bring our small, petty, negative, suffering being back to this completion. It is a very good relationship! To bring the wounded, needy, broken one back to its healing, back to its completion.  The Buddha represents this: what we really are. But in addition, the historical Buddha revealed the path that allows us to actually attain our true awakened self; so there's an additional layer of gratitude and respect in bowing to the Buddha, or to any enlightened being helping us along the path. If you don't yet feel that gratitude, or shy away for religious reasons, no problem; just bow to your greater self, your original mind. Different traditions teach the precepts differently. The Vinayavada (way of the ethical code), also sometimes called the way of the śramanas or Theravada (the way of the elders)  or sutrayana (the scriptural path) requires you to follow the precepts very strictly. Mahayana and other traditions follow precepts just as strictly, but also include the guidance to use your wisdom in applying the precepts.  One of the difference in application is the general thrust of teachings, where Theravada tends to be a bit more about purifying oneself of faults, and Mahayana tends to be a bit more about saving all beings. Of course, Theravada saints save all beings and Mahayana saints have purified themselves, so the difference isn't exclusive; there's just a difference in approach. All Buddhist traditions can lead to enlightenment.   In Zen, they may say ""know when to apply the precepts, and when to abandon them"". It means that before precepts there is your original wisdom mind, from which all precepts arise. The precepts are given so that you can return to your mind of wisdom; but the mind is primary. When your mind is functioning well, you don't need a code of conduct. Attaining your mind is beyond religion in this sense. But since our ignorance is very deep and tricky, we use precepts to help us attain our true mind.   You don't have to make up reasons to have a watch or any possession. It doesn't all have to be about spirituality. You like the watch -- no problem. You can buy it, enjoy it, and move on. Attachment to the watch is a problem, but in the grand scheme of things it's not the biggest problem. Guilt about having the watch is another kind of attachment problem. Also not the biggest deal.  But know the danger of making and holding opinions! Let go of your big attachments, the ones that keep you from offering big love to the world. Then you can take care of watches and things.  As you practice, your attachment will naturally sort itself out. Even treasured possessions will start to lose their taste, lose their power to grab you. Your passion and joy and inspiration will be fully to help all beings out of their suffering. But take great care with this notion of ""I'll do it later"". Being a little better than yesterday is maybe a good thing, or maybe a trap. If you condense it into a philosophy, it can be a way of avoiding your responsibility, and a way of making compromises.  There are two points here. First is that you are already complete. So 'being good' is not really the aim. It's just a convenient way of taking about practice sometimes. But really your job is to express your original completion, not to try to be something in particular. This point comes clear with practice integrated into daily life.  The second point is that cause and effect are clear. Issues of love, emotion, goodness, precepts, attachment, and so on are not about some set of standards foisted upon you, but about the results you get from your thoughts and actions. Originally there is no good and bad, there is just cause and effect.  There's a story about a butcher who killed animals for a living. Having learned a bit about Buddhism he thought that he could do his killing during the day, and then do good action at night, like charitable works, studying the Dharma, and doing meditation. The story says that after he died he went to a place where at night he experienced great blissful heaven, and during the day he suffered unspeakable agony of hell.  You can't escape the results of what you put into motion. Therefore it is said that you should avoid doing even the smallest negative action, and make a point of doing even the smallest positive action. This is the mindset, but we all have the reality of our current capacity, and adding guilt to the mix is not helpful."
Buddhism,3e230u,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:30 2015 UTC,The story about the butcher receiving unspeakable agony for providing other people with food sounds a bit weird to me. Care to elaborate?
Buddhism,3e230u,sneeku,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"The story points out that there is a result to actions. Negative results come from negative actions, like causing terror, pain, or death for other beings. The fact that these actions are well-intentioned or performed within a culture that accepts them is only slightly mitigating; it doesn't erase the result.  For example, many people these days wage holy wars, killing in the name of goodness. They think they are helping everyone. Many others protest for very worthy causes, but they bring aggression and ill-will to their protest, believing that the cause justifies it. Sometimes we may harm others because we think they deserve it or because we are trying to change their behavior. Although we think of ourselves as being justified, it doesn't erase the painful repercussions of our violence. We will receive the results of our negative intentions and actions.  Doing positive action will bring happy results; but it won't eradicate the results of any negative actions that you also perform."
Buddhism,3e230u,TheHeartOfTuxes,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:58 2015 UTC,"Real love [...] is 'for you', because this 'I' is already complete.   So I was right in assuming a translation problem. Regarding the nuances of ""love"", from my personal standpoint it is a very complicated concept and a very big word. But your explanation resonates with me. I'd even say that my own definition of love was heavily influenced by Buddhism ... this ""completion"" always assumes something is missing in every person. Or in other words, that a being which chooses to live alone is imperfect.  Many years ago, a friend told me about her epiphany about the term ""panta rhei"" (everything flows), and that everything is somehow intertwined. For about a minute, I labeled her as a lunatic, but the thought lingered in my mind, and it stuck.  Today, I don't see love as holding somebody as close as possible and not letting the person go, but as enjoying the journey of life together - maybe for a short time, maybe until death. That's why I sought clarification for ""love"" and ""passion"".   no problem; just bow to your greater self, your original mind.   Not to repeat myself from the other comments, but I just love this concept in Buddhism. Now that I somewhat understand why some people bow to a Buddha statue, it makes it easier for me to come to a conclusion.  I think there's a point in putting something into a symbol or a gesture, it is easier to understand than a long string of words. People understand what a crucifix is, and people understand what a Star of David is, both without having someone explain this specific religious symbols in a specific language. But if I say ""it is an action-centered religion from Japan"", you wouldn't necessarily know I'm talking about Shinto, even though you understand English. In the religions, specific actions like the reciting of mantras have their place, but what I find intriguing about Buddhism is that there's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to practice. Sure, there is a way, but you can follow it ... it's not like a commandment.  While I know there are different traditions in Buddhism, usually I only have heard their names. I'm most familiar with Zen Buddhism, but interested in knowing about the other ones as well. I'll grab some books for deepening my understanding. For now it's good to know there are different ways of practicing Buddhism.   You like the watch -- no problem. You can buy it, enjoy it, and move on.   You provide a deeper insight to my problem in a few words than I have come up with in a few monts. It seems I'm overthinking things, and not focusing on the underlying problems - or even focusing on a petty problem to ignore the elephant in the room. Another commenter mentioned the natural human condition. Maybe I just have to accept the fact I just want certain things. But I'm not always sure why, and this irks me.   First is that you are already complete. So 'being good' is not really the aim.   I chose ""becoming better each day"" as a synonym. Is it better for me that I can do 10 push-ups instead of 5? Maybe yes, maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's even worse, because I want to brag about it. Actually, I'm not interested in being famous, achieving an arbitrary level of knowledge or whatever, but making the world a better place ... as cheesy as it sounds. If I manage to make somebody smile, and I manage not to make somebody else angry, the world is a better place. By working on myself and - using your words - becoming better at expressing my original completion, I might not only help myself, but the people around me. Wouldn't it be nice if the world were full of love and understanding?   adding guilt to the mix is not helpful   To come back to the watch, it looks like I already set up a chain reaction of thoughts, which led to some kind of suffering - but as I mentioned in another comment, I'd rather delay buying it. I don't need it, but I'm not entirely sure why I want it. There are just a bunch of justifications. I even might be attached to the mere thought that I want to own this object again. Sure, in the end it's only about ""I buy it, I own it"" versus ""I don't buy it, I don't have it"". But for now, it provides an interesting thought process for me.  Thank you for the extensive reply!"

Buddhism,3e230u,deathnate4,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"Some years ago, I started reading about Buddhism for this very reason. Craving. Attachment. Unhappiness. While I can't recall how my path went, I remember becoming interested in the teachings, but would rather label myself as an atheist than a Buddhist. Guess what? In hindsight I might have sought the label ""atheist"", but meant ""somebody educated and seeking reason and meaning in the world"" - and I thought people practicing religion are somewhat stupid. Don't worry, I learned a lot since then ...  Unsurprisingly, I didn't find many reasons and lots of meaning for certain aspects of life. They just ... were. Over the years my thought processes changed and I just don't care so much about the opinions of others anymore. Today, I have no problem in calling myself a Buddhist or whatever. It makes it easy for others to put me in a box. They do it anyway, so I might as well give them a pointer in the general direction ...   Beautiful writing. You will help many people with your words as you clarify your life.   Thank you, this means a lot to me. Especially since this isn't even my native language. :)"
Buddhism,3e230u,flagrant_armadillo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"There is more about this in this chapter about pleasure, so I'm somewhat confused. Maybe a case of ""lost in translation   Yes, that's probably the case. Love is not something bad in Buddhism, but from a Buddhist perspective what we usually refer to as love a lot of the time is really just strong attachment.    Or does the statue represent exactly this and not Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama)    Sometimes yes. You can see it as a representation of a being that has already gone beyond suffering and thus somewhat of a role model or goal, you can also see it as a representation of your own capabilities being that you possess Buddha-nature; you could also bow to a Buddha statue as a show of gratitude to the past Buddha who brought forth the Dharma to the world. It's really up to you. You don't even have to perform prostrations if you don't like the idea.   And even His Holyness the Dalai Lama swats mosquitos   I just want to point out that just because the Dalai Lama does it, doesn't mean it's ok. The Dalai Lama is not necessarily the standard by which to live by.   Is it correct that these are guidelines, which I should adhere, but am not bound to   Yes. However it's important to keep in mind that as long as a being has not attained Nirvana, they are bound to Samsara. So the precepts are not meant to bind, but to release from bondage, and it's advisable to take up the precepts in such a way that you don't intend to break them.   For me, it's a reminder that time is fleeting and nothing is forever, a symbol for space exploration   I'm not sure how you've managed to convince yourself of this, but I'll be the voice of reason and inform you that you do not need an expensive, luxury wrist watch for that. So you should be honest with yourself on why you really want it."
Buddhism,3e230u,numbersev,2,Tue Jul 21 11:21:34 2015 UTC,"It's really up to you.   Actually, I like this idea, it seems to be prevalent in Buddhism. There's just so much stuff, so many ideas of Buddhism, and I don't want to outright ignore some aspects I see. At least I want to take a look at them. If they work for me, great - if they don't, well, it's up to me what to do about it. In either case it's interesting to know why stuff is done, and why I think this is interesting, outrageous or whatever.   So the precepts are not meant to bind, but to release from bondage   This makes much more sense to me than ""rules of conduct"" or whatever I found online, thanks.  Oh, regarding the Dalai Lama, yes, he's another being. I'm responsible for myself and my actions alone. I just selected this specific example to give something to relate to ... actually, I'm not particularly fond of worshipping idols. I'm more interested in their ideas and practices.   So you should be honest with yourself on why you really want it.   My problem here is I'm already honest with myself. I'll write up a longer response in the other answers, since my problem is not with this specific item and its price tag, but the idea behind something representing something. But your point is still valid: I don't need a watch to remind me of time. It just makes things easier for me, I like to give my brain shortcuts for certain thought processes - that's why I put in the example with the mala. Do I need a string of beads to remind me of being mindful? No. Does it help? From my own experience with similar ""mental links"", yes.  Thank you!"
Buddhism,3e230u,Rks1157,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama) talks about passion: ""As rain doesn’t seep into a well-thatched hut, so passion does not, the well-developed mind."" From what I understood, passion is a problem because it's not the middle way, but an extreme form in one direction ... is this correct?   ""Passion"" here means kleshas.   Regarding love, every being deserves love and so on. ""Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil. Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters."" Well ... so does love in this context mean attachment or does this really mean I should not love, say, my partner or other sentient beings? There is more about this in this chapter about pleasure, so I'm somewhat confused. Maybe a case of ""lost in translation""?   Yeah it means attachment. In Buddhism Metta is unconditional loving-kindness without attachment.   Apart from the text, I'm a little bit confused about practicing Buddhism, or more specifically, prostrating to a Buddha statue, an altar or something like this. Sure, as a Buddhist I respect the teachings of the Buddha (Dharma) - but wouldn't I rather be bowing to all sentient beings, for their inherent Buddha-nature? Or does the statue represent exactly this and not Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama)?   In my studies I've never picked up on an emphasis on prostrations. Maybe the sources you've investigated happened to emphasize it, but it's not essential to Buddhist practice.   Next, let's say I undertake the five precepts - abstain from harming living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication. Is it correct that these are guidelines, which I should adhere, but am not bound to? To take it from the title of my text, my goal is to bring light into the world, not to become the most spiritual being ever. And even His Holyness the Dalai Lama swats mosquitos. I would say for myself that being a little bit ""better"" and more mindful than I was yesterday is a win, is this consistent with Buddhism?   You're under no obligation to do anything. If you happen to wish to train for your welfare and the welfare of other sentient beings then Buddhism has a lot of wisdom to share with you on that project. But how vigorously you wish to train is, of course, up to you. In other words Buddhism doesn't dictate to us that we must live for the welfare of sentient beings, it shows us how to do so. The 5 pañcasīlāni (lit. ""training rules"") are a key part of such a life according to Buddhist tradition.   But there's another thing I'm buying in the next days: An expensive luxury wrist wratch...   One of the first things you'll learn studying Buddhism is that the Buddha gave a critique of the usual method we use to seek well-being: stimulating the 6 sense bases to generate a pleasant feeling. We stimulate the 6 sense bases to produce physical, emotional, or intellectual pleasure. The problem is that this feeling is transient. Neither the feeling itself nor the sensory contact that produces it can be sustained long-term. We're left moving from one source of stimulation to the next as the pleasure they produce is depleted or we lose sensory contact with them. Buddhism very much revolves around the project of using other methods to acquire a much more stable and enduring fulfillment that doesn't depend upon unstable conditions. When its drawbacks are understood deeply then the desire for material possessions and other sources of sensory stimulation falls away naturally. In the mean time there is no benefit in repressing this desire or feeling guilty about it. It's the natural human condition."
Buddhism,3e230u,Rks1157,2,Tue Jul 21 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome, the correct terms provide much more meaning, the text makes sense now. Maybe I should grab another copy in a different language (I read it english, but am a non-native speaker) and try to get more out of the text.   In other words Buddhism [...] shows us how to do so.   This seems to be a key point which I missed. I already pointed out in another comment that I like the notion of doing what I think is right, and still having a precise framework which I can follow. That's why I like to see Buddhism as a philosophy rather than a religion: It's not about dogmatic stuff, holy artifacts and strict rules which one must follow, but about providing a path to reduce suffering and finding to oneself.   The problem is that this feeling is transient.   Oh, I know that all to well ... I read a lot about craving and attachment, and I'm still falling back into this trap almost every single day. Thanks for pointing out there's not much to gain by feeling guilty, I often catch myself in justifying ""useless"" stuff. Usually, there's no harm, just some short-term pleasure. Sometimes, there's long-term pleasure ... my wonderful headphones come to mind, which have provided me with endless hours of listening pleasure. But you're right: As soon as I don't have access to my headphones and want to listen to music, there's this feeling of deprivation. I can get auditory stimulation somehow else, but it's not the same.  To get back to the watch: You have a point with the sensory stimulation, especially since Buddhism counts the mind as a sense. I know this object gives me a certain sense of pleasure, but I simply don't know if this is something ""good"" or something ""bad"". So I worry about my worrying ... does this make sense? Maybe I should just let go of this thought and see what happens. But the harder I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion I should at least delay buying it. From a karma point of view, buying or not buying it triggers some kind of action, and it looks like I can live with not buying it and still enjoy the reasons for which I would have bought it.  Thank you!"
Buddhism,3e0avo,throwaway0604693,6,Mon Jul 20 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"I just moved to a new state. Working at a job I am unhappy in but it is only temporary until I start graduate school. I am alone. I don't know anyone out here   I feel like you really just gotta look at this one logically; no Buddhism needed. You just started a new chapter in life, so there is no reason to think you should have this immediate connection with the state and/or the people in it. One, just give it some time. You will more than likely acclimate especially if you are practicing right. The response to change is awareness and equanimity. Hopefully you have practiced this in meditation. Now is the perfect time to use that in the real world. Two, try and go meet people like at a gym, at your job, at a meditation center near you, something.    I don't seem them as sex objects and have done some meditating on the human body and don't find it all that appealing anymore.   Personally, I don't find this to be a bad thing at all. Maybe this is a good thing for you. I have found a similar thing happening to me over the past year; sex and women don't seem appealing as much and, for me, they waste a good bit of energy i could use elsewhere. The key thing here though is that I'm not apathetic towards women or asexual. I still find the act of sex pleasurable and see the many benefits of having a partner.   This is the marker for me to know I'm on the middle path (at least my subjective path; everyone's is different). I once was overly attached to women and was obsessed with sex/emotional attachment (craving). I also went to the other side of complete depression and wanted nothing to do with them in a negative way (aversion). Now I'm finding myself just becoming more detached and am not bound by my emotions, thoughts, wants, sights, etc. as much anymore.   Maybe this is how you feel also, and this is a great opportunity to expend your energy practicing in solitude and with less responsibility. People saying you should want to have a girlfriend are just attached to their own views that are heavily carved into their minds due to social ""norms.""   Give yourself some more time to figure stuff out. Being single is by no means wrong. You are your own refuge. Screw what other people think is right for you. If your views are in line with Dhamma, then that is perfectly okay. IMHO I think worrying more about your job, grad school, and getting used to the new living situation is a more important priority than women at the moment. Don't just take what I say with blind faith though, you do what you think is best.     I often think about becoming a monk.   That's great, I ponder about it a lot also. Try out a few retreats and talk to some monks themselves to try and get a feel for what it is like. Big commitment.    I often think about becoming a monk. My mom asks if this is just me avoiding life   Maybe she's right, maybe she's not. You really have to make that call yourself and see whether or not this is true. However, living as a monk is not avoiding life. True, you aren't as socially involved, but you still go through vicissitudes and still have the same 6 senses that make up reality for you. The degrees and experiences of both are just vastly different. Additionally, practicing, spreading and maintaining the Dhamma is such a wonderful thing even if your mom doesn't understand. Again, you need to really think things over.  Good luck with everything. All things are impermanent!"

Buddhism,3e0avo,numbersev,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:31 2015 UTC,"""I feel like I am not sure what I want.  Now I don't know if I want to have a girlfriend or not because my views on the human body have changed.""   Good insight. Lets  take it a little further, this will change too.    What confuses you is that you are expecting things as they are to always be as they are.  This includes your feelings and perspectives and what you identify with being you.     You are maturing.  You've come to see that girls are people too.  This is good thing, a very good thing at this time in your life.  You can concentrate on your studies and build a foundation for meaningful relationships rather than relationships based on a sexual attraction that changes with the wind.     When the conditions are right you'll find yourself interested in girls again.  I can almost guarantee it."
Buddhism,3e0avo,Rks1157,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think this is a good time in OP's life to practice acceptance. They used to have sexual desire, and felt sociable, now they don't. Rather than try to justify those desires (or lack of) by comparing them to the past, to another's viewpoint, or to a hypothesised future, they should really try to accept things as they are. Things might change, they may not. What's important is what's happening right now. OP: Personally, I don't think you should disrupt your life to join a monastery at this point. The monastery will always be there. I would certainly join a sangha, do some retreats, and get to know your local monastery (which you will have to do for a while to join one anyway). I think you should continue with school, and accept how you're feeling right now as just another feeling."
Buddhism,3e0avo,TetrisMcKenna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:14:19 2015 UTC,"A girlfriend (or boyfriend) is more than just a sex object. There is a whole spectrum of relationship that can exist in the girlfriend space. Being asexual doesn't mean you should skip out of those kinds of relationships. Sometimes a best friend can fill that niche just fine too -- it doesn't need to be a girlfriend. Someone (or ones) who you can love and can love you back.  So I'm not really sure exactly what your question is (if one even has been formed) and my views aren't strictly Buddhist, per-se.   Monkhood. I, too, wanted to ""avoid life"" and join a monastery, when I was younger. I suppose I still do now. But I think that's a loaded quotation marks there. ""Avoid life"". What does that mean? I take it that your mother means it to mean ""avoid having a job/responsibilities"", but it's not like being a monk is responsibility-free. But that doesn't mean you're not ""running"" by wanting to join a monastery either (nor does it mean you are, to be explicit).     The reasons  that I wanted to join a monastery were that I wanted to drop out of our society and explore consciousness. Well, the reasons I consciously acknowledged so far, at least. Presumably, in a monastery, I wouldn't have a traditional American dayjob working 9-5, etc. That was attractive to me. What is it that you expect to get out of joining a monastery?  Presumably graduate school won't cost you a lot of money since you'll be doing research for them? Maybe my PHD-only research has tainted  my information graduate school in general. In this case, going through will only cost personal resources (time, energy) and you'll end up a lot more marketable for jobs. A program of graduate study changes a person a lot. Now that I'm thinking about it, graduate shcool is similar to a monastery in some ways -- it requires lots of will power, it teaches (provides environment to learn) lessons.   The most glaring thing I notice among your post, though, is your solitude. The way you write about it makes it seem like you do not desire solitude. Grad school is one environment where it's easy to not be in solitude (at least outside thesis-writing hours). Granted, one can find non-solitude anywhere. Make friends at work. Make friends of friends at work. Solitude can lead to depression if not approached with a healthy mind. Not all social engagements need to be ""lets go out to a bar"" kind of stuff too. You mention needing to recharge as an introvert. Try inviting people to do things that replenish you, instead. Or learn to get energy from others. I was an extreme introvert too until I learned what it took to enjoy and recharge in social situations. Not sure I can word that solution or if that solution would even help you (or if you can even be helped in that regard).  So there's my word vomit. Everyone's confused at this stage in their life, so don't be down about not knowing what you want."
Buddhism,3e0avo,Kowzorz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:17 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your response.  It helped a lot.  You are right I am just really confused.  And yes my mom thinking I am avoiding life and running away but she doesn't know buddhism at all.  I don't see it that way.  I want to explore consciousness and get answers that I have always craved growing up.  Do you know if I need to be a monk to do that?  Is a year in a monastery enough time?
Buddhism,3e0avo,Kowzorz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:30 2015 UTC,"Have you tried explaining your perspective to her? It might not click with her, but receiving an explanation to how you see the world or your goals, especially if it's well thought out, might bring some perspective to her view.  I think it's important to consider post-event situation as well. So you go to a monastery for a year. Now what? Stay there the rest of your life? Enter grad school? Walk the country performing miracles? Not all options you have now will be available after you spend time at a monastery. Not all options you have post-monastery will be what you desire, be it now-desires or future-desires. Is what you desire important when compared to other things, such as what is ""best"" for you?  You can explore consciousness without being a monk. You can be a monk without joining a monastery, depending on what you consider a monk is. It seems like you're looking for permission to do what you want and/or a place that will provide it for you. You won't always get that. If you go the conscious exploration route, you won't even necessarily get answers you crave. Ideally, you won't even crave then either.   My experience involved researching into what monks actually did at monasteries. That didn't turn me away from wanting to go to one, but it showed me that the only thing special about a monastery is the guidance provided and the environment to do it in. There's plenty of guidance everywhere (some better than others, though the same can be said of monasteries) and plenty of places to perform."
Buddhism,3e0avo,jenni5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:21 2015 UTC,i hear your struggles.  i can empathize.  practice metta for yourself and gratitude.  remember to have joy!  having friends and enjoying life is a big part of buddhism.  its not all cold meditation and solitude.  are you changing cities in a few months?  in a year?  you can practice buddhism while you work and earn money and pay off your debts.  you can practice while you are a student and find the path that is right for you.  the solution doesnt begin or end with your decision.  it evolves.
Buddhism,3e0avo,ElMelonTerrible,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think you are mixing some Buddhist and non-Buddhist logic in incompatible ways.  Your ideas about the evil consequences of sexual desire are wrong-headed and disturbing.  Setting aside Buddhist motivations for a moment, the problem with sexual objectification is when sexual desire becomes your only way of relating to women, when you can't appreciate anything else about them, when you look at someone who is intelligent or artistic or hard-working and all you see is something you want to fuck.  It's totally fine to look at a woman and feel sexual desire for her, as long as you are capable of seeing her as a full human being.  Repressing sexual desire because it is mentally associated with immorality, or simply through depression or self-negation, is something that happens to a lot of people, and however it happens, the results are unhealthy.  It stunts their emotional development and their relationships, and it comes out in strange ways later in life.  So... if we add Buddhism to the picture, does Buddhism make it all okay, since we are supposed to aim for the extinction of desire?  No, not really.  Buddhism is not about repression, depression, or self-stunting.  Buddhism is not about convincing yourself that sexual desire has evil social consequences.  That is not Buddhist logic.  Consider a doctor whose ambition is to eradicate yellow fever.  It is a noble ambition, but attachment to it gives rise to dukkha just as surely as attachment to sexual desire.  If you are mixing moral judgment against sexual desire with the Buddhist aspiration to the extinction of all desires, you are mixing two things that have nothing to do with each other.  You should not use psychologically harmful means to achieve Buddhist ends."
Buddhism,3e0avo,throwaway_210715,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are like my twin! I am going through very similar circumstances, so may be we can help each other out.   I am starting grad school too in a month, in a new country no less, where I will know absolutely no one. Nor do I know anyone where I work now, but at least I am able to do what I like.  My last serious girlfriend dumped me 4 years ago. Since then, a few dates, but nothing more. Have never really enjoyed pornography or masturbation. I am not disgusted by sex or anything, but I just don't care for it that much anymore. The thought of ever having a sexual relationship with anyone, and all the associated baggage, seems less and less appealing to me everyday. Some sort of companionship, yes I could be fine with that. But I have always been an introvert, and feel like I could live alone just fine, all my life.   Ever since I started getting into Buddhism (about a year ago), the thought of leaving everything and becoming a monk has possessed me from time to time. To live a simple life and practice meditation more thoroughly.  But I love my research, its something that I have always wanted to do. Plus, my work is experimental, so I treat it as a fine excuse for a meditative practice, much like Thich Nhat Hanh's washing the dishes meditation. Working with a certain degree of mindfulness has made my work that much more rewarding and enjoyable, and I am sure it will be the same during my PhD.  I am putting off thoughts about becoming a monk, simply because I feel I do not know enough about Buddhism to make that decision now. Is one year enough to know all that is there to know about Buddhism to make such a life changing decision? I am not so sure. So I am putting it off till I finish my PhD, which will be about 5 years from now. Then, I won't also be ""running away from life"", because I will have made my small contribution to my area of research. Meanwhile, I am continuing with my meditation practice, and will join a Buddhist center when I start my PhD. Hopefully after 5 years of practice, I will know if the path of being a monk is what lies ahead for me.   As far as dating and relationships, I have no idea. I do not think I am going to actively seek for dates anymore. If it happens, it happens on its own. Meanwhile, I am spending time on things I actually enjoy, such as travel and writing.  Let me know what you feel. Do not think I have it all figured out, but writing this down certainly helped me clear things up a little bit in my head. I am just taking it one day at a time, as I am sure most of us are. PM me if you want to talk."

Wanting a partner is about wanting to feel complete, wanting.to find fulfillment.  You do not know what will fulfill you?  Joy, wellbeing and love will fulfill you.  You love buddhism?  Your own world have told me where your joy is.  Monks do the opposite of avoid life. They come to know life in its full measure.  Know the truth of it.  It is.not a morbid practise but a blissful practise.  Whatever you do, if you go with the desire to find the truth and dissolve your boundaries and identities, anything will become a beautiful spiritual process.

I think having a good mentor who will answer a lot of questions you have and will guide you on to the right path.  Become an apprentice to a zen master or a monk and see how it helps. Be careful in who you choose though, a bad teacher can do more harm than good.   Go out to buddhist meetings, meet some people. In my experience people who come to these meetings tend to be very welcoming, very non judgemental and very compassionate. Its an environment any character from any background can fit right in.  Give it a try. :)"
