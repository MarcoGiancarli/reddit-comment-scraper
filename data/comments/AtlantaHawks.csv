AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,cosmo_bear,5,Tue Jul 21 19:34:49 2015 UTC,I would love to meet the one person who likes live more than 2k.
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,snippler10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:30 2015 UTC,That's my roommate. But that's because e got live for free.
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,cosmo_bear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's about the only way I'd try it."
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,Intercepting,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:40 2015 UTC,Live has been getting better... the player models can sometimes be better than 2K but that's about it. They still have a long ways to go to be as good as 2K.
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,poerhouse,3,Tue Jul 21 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"I expect Live will be better this year, but they've got a looooong way to go to approach 2K. I remember back in the dark ages when Live was head and shoulders above any other round ball game.  Yeah, I'm old and shit."
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,Jus10Crummie,3,Tue Jul 21 21:05:35 2015 UTC,"I hope not, 2k has madden fever bad and their product has been half assed for awhile, Im praying that Live really pulls something special out their ass so 2k will actually care about their product."
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,poerhouse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"I feel ya, but I disagree. For me 2K ain't broke- no need to reinvent the wheel every year. Then again, I'm not a competitive player; I'm a big MyPlayer guy and that mode has come leaps and bounds over the past few years. That said- Live being awesome again would in no way be a bad thing for anyone..."
AtlantaHawks,3e3wqt,Jus10Crummie,3,Wed Jul 22 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I love MyPlayer, but online is straight broken, has been for a long time. in 06, 07, 08, 09, & 10, NBA live was super smooth online so I deserted 2K after a couple years but had to come back cuz Bynum Jesus u know."

AtlantaHawks,3e57w7,BillClintonSaxMaster,2,Wed Jul 22 01:27:42 2015 UTC,"I got a Spud Webb jersey off of there and have been surprisingly pleased. I've compared it to a friends legit Nique jersey and found a few small differences. Mainly a blank name tag on the logo patch in the bottom of the jersey rather than the players name on the legitimate jersey, and if you put them up next to each other you could see slight differences in the lettering and sewing patterns, but nothing too crazy for the 6 or 7 bucks I paid for it. Go for it, man. You won't be out too much even if you're disappointed."
AtlantaHawks,3e57w7,robotron2112,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:50:16 2015 UTC,just make sure you check the feedback before buying. I don't think they have any of the new jerseys yet though
AtlantaHawks,3e57w7,ArianaArmy33,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"I've bought many jerseys off aliex in the past, and the one piece of advice I have for you is: ALWAYS go for the $30 jersey over the $20 jersey. That $10 makes a HUGE difference, and in most cases is the difference between your jersey looking exactly like something from the NBA store, and a knock off you'd find on the streets of Bali."
AtlantaHawks,3e57w7,macgarnickle,-2,Wed Jul 22 08:23:52 2015 UTC,"The big downside is that with AliExpress your jerseys are not paying the license fees to NBA Properties.  These license fees are part of the BRI (Basketball Related Income) that is split between the owners of the NBA teams and the players.  When you deprive the owners of income, you jeopardize the profitability of the league, and this may lead to more teams losing money, and possibly even dissolving like what happened to the Providence Steamrollers in 1949."
AtlantaHawks,3e64m4,18andover,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:30:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to admit it, we miss a superstar that can lead us. SF position got a little weaker, depth and frontcourt got stronger. But mostly this is just Vegas underrating us. It always happens. I think we go to the ECF again."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,schroders_cat,9,Tue Jul 21 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"I think it was a little better. I think people are underestimating the Splitter addition, and more importantly, the Pero subtraction. Don't get me wrong, Pero brought us some great moments but I personally don't think he's the kind of PF/C we need on this team. I also like Holiday a lot and think that THJ will do well in our offense, not so sure about defense though. If anything, I'm actually concerned most about how healthy Millsap will be now that he's getting into his 30s and also whether or not that shoulder injury is going to continue to nag him.  This may be an unpopular opinion, but that's just me. I would grade them more towards a B/B+, and I really hope their play in the regular season proves me right."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,DankVoid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:09 2015 UTC,What I don't get is why couldn't keep Oubre. He could've been great in our system. Are the 2 second round picks really worth it?
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,KickedInTheDonuts,5,Wed Jul 22 07:22:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, I would've gone B, maybe B+. Our hands were tied with DeMarre and Paul, we simply could not afford to keep both of them. If you want to start grading based on taking points off for stuff that it literally impossible, then sure, give us an F for failing to lure LeBron and Kevin Love and LMA, bringing in Greg Popovich as an assistant coach and bringing back Jesus to serve as GM. You have to base it on what is actually possible and I would say we were solidly above average for that. Kept the more important of DeMarre and Paul, and vastly improved our bench depth."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,GT2018,5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:23 2015 UTC,"I think people underestimate the system improving players. Judging THJ based off his stint with the Knicks is silly. DMC and Millsap BOTH got better playing here, which is why we can't afford to keep both of them. Why would you expect them to stay at the danger level? (Splitter aside, he's used to the system and will probably be about the same). Plus, losing Pero really isn't that big. I'd  grade at least a B."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,kraken-on-standby,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:34 2015 UTC,Last season's squad finished with 20+ more wins than expected. I'm gonna trust that Bud knows what he's doing.
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,KillaBeesKnees,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"For comparison, this is the grade Fox Sports gave us last year:   Grade: C+  Best Move: Re-signing Mike Scott.  Worst Move: Signing Thabo Sefolosha.  The Hawks didn’t sign any marquee free agents, but still managed to fill some areas of need. Bringing in Kent Bazemore gives them flexibility and athleticism on the wing, while drafting Adreian Payne provides frontcourt depth and versatility. Thabo Sefolosha’s shooting woes may outweigh his defensive presence, though. However, one of the steals of the summer was Mike Scott returning to Atlanta. He has proven to be valuable as a stretch four and his game will only continue to improve."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,rjdab,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"We may have given Cleveland a run for their money if Thabo had been healthy. Still would've lost, but could've stretched it to 5, maybe 6."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,GT2018,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"At the least I think they would have been able to keep JR Smith from going complete insanity mode in game 1 before he did. By the 3rd or 4th three I would have hoped they would have had Sefolosha checking him. And if it stopped him, that game turns into one of the ugly Cleveland vs Chicago games and Atlanta has a better chance at getting that game."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,Daphne1895,2,Wed Jul 22 04:29:43 2015 UTC,TRUST IN BUD
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,4219534,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"The only problem i had with our offseason was how we handled the draft.    I liked the splitter signing, glad we brought Tavares over from spain.  Resigned Millsap, and signed a solid cheap guy in Holiday.  All that is very solid.  I'm going to withhold judgement until I see what Bud can do with Hardaway.  He hasn't led me wrong yet... but my opinion as a fan is that I'd rather have taken Oubre or someone else after we traded down.  All things considered, I think C is a fair grade.  Not a disastrous offseason, but definitely not very sexy."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,broeho,4,Tue Jul 21 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"Alright the Trailblazers lost 4 out of their 5 starters, that's an F.  We also added bench depth so I think C is a good grade"
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,killjoyous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:54 2015 UTC,Losing JYD and trading Oubre stings.  We still have a starting position to fill and Hardaway started less than half of his games last year.
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,Kllian,5,Tue Jul 21 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"Oubre would probably not have started for at least the first half of next season. Even if he was kept there is still a ""starting position"" to fill."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,Daphne1895,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'd personally rather get a veteran than a rookie at this point (ie THJ over Oubre). We were so close to the finals last year, and this window doesn't open up often. Gotta take advantage while you can."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,GT2018,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"THJ is not a SF. The starter is probably Sefolosha which I think I'm fine with as long as he has a season similar to 2013 in OKC. The real problem would be if they didn't fine more offense in other signings and I think they did, should be able to average 102-103 PPG again."
AtlantaHawks,3e2vjv,Daphne1895,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:14 2015 UTC,"Right, I didn't mean to imply he's a SF. I just meant since they're both basically bench players at this point, I think THJ is closer to being able to contribute than Oubre."
AtlantaHawks,3e2fc0,CTIDmississippi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Hawks had a good jersey set, and it is now ruined."
AtlantaHawks,3e2fc0,bearg0d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:54 2015 UTC,I honestly didn't know anybody who liked our jerseys last year. Now it's split 50/50 between love and hate but I think that's better than the meh kind of feeling the last ones gave off.
AtlantaHawks,3e2fc0,KillaBeesKnees,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:06 2015 UTC,I don't hate the new jersey set. I just wish last year's hadn't been a one and done.
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,Keeks_marone,15,Tue Jul 21 00:04:22 2015 UTC,Good for him.
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,fireglz,7,Tue Jul 21 00:06:11 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously. I really hope he gets more PT in Dallas. He's a great shooter.

AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,CheetahSperm18,12,Tue Jul 21 00:44:43 2015 UTC,"Nice, with Wes recovering from his Achilles Injury, I can see him getting more PT with us, is he a good personality in the locker room? Sorry its just after DeAndre and Rondo we Mavs Fans are rlly skeptical as of late"
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,Frezkye,7,Tue Jul 21 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"IIRC, a lot of the veterans spoke fondly of him back when he got PT pre-Bud. From what I know, he never complained about his lack of playing time, and was professional with us while he was here.  Really good shooter, defense is kinda eh."
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,CheetahSperm18,10,Tue Jul 21 01:18:31 2015 UTC,"That's good stuff to hear, and cmon bro I'm a Mavs fan lol I don't know what defense is, he'll fit in well from what you guys have said, we've won games with Monta ""Fuck Defense"" Ellis as our starting SG. Thx telling me about Jenkins btw"
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,StoopidFlexin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:57 2015 UTC,Yea he barley got any PT.
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,drsmith21,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:07 2015 UTC,"Knock down shooter when open, but that's about it. Not a good passer. No handles or defense. Had a back injury that out him out for about 6 months and he never really recovered. If he's watched and learned from Korver the last 3 years, he may turn out to be a solid rotation player. Seemed to get along with the guys on the team and never bitched about being bounced to the D league or riding pine."
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,justcamp,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"His defense is god-awful which is why Bud never played him.  Jenkins is a good spot up shooter, but that's his only real skill."
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,bties,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:30 2015 UTC,"I've been following John since his days at Vandy.  Pure shooter, hard worker, all around good player.  Not elite in NBA terms, but has the potential to be a regular contributer if given minutes.  I've wanted to see him break out ever since he was drafted by my hawks, but it just didn't pan out in ATL.  Good luck to him in Dallas"
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,personman1983,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"Could become a really solid player, but lack of size and physicality will be obvious on occasion."
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,duhpolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:16 2015 UTC,"I was a fan of his whenever he was on the court, but like others already mentioned, he didn't get much PT, mainly for his size/lack of defense. He is a very good shooter, and not selfish to give up a good shot for a better one when necessary. When he shoots it, pretty much expect it to go in. It's the defense that's his main problem."
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,CheetahSperm18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"Reminds me a lot of Aminu but reversed, little PT, great defense, not so good offense"

Garage was empty and it looked oddly depressing, I didn't approach him as I had a few to drink and my sober wife who was driving told me to leave him alone since I was obnoxious from alcohol and it was late. Adreian Payne used to live in my building too and both of these former Hawks are very humble and genuinely nice guys. Any reason Jenkins might have been upset with this trade?"
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,TwoDaysToRetirement,2,Tue Jul 21 23:48:12 2015 UTC,not a trade he just left in FA so it was his choice but I dont think we offered him anything (we just dont need him) so that might be why
AtlantaHawks,3e0dpu,T64dw4n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:50:02 2015 UTC,Ah... I guess he might have been just re-evaluating his career or clearing his head with choices. I hope he does well in Dallas.

AtlantaHawks,3dxwfv,dunkndnuts,0,Mon Jul 20 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, the bulls will be healthy it seems, but they have a brand new coach. It's tough to say if Toronto improved or not, and how much of a leap teams like miami or Milwaukee can make. I believe we'll be in the top 4 though"

AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,dunkndnuts,5,Mon Jul 20 02:09:35 2015 UTC,I would like to see Petteway get a shot. I would prefer to grab another young asset and see what we can do with them and then try to make a move next summer.
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,BeautifulMohammad,4,Mon Jul 20 03:09:13 2015 UTC,I think we'll keep that spot open.
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,ajg47,2,Mon Jul 20 03:21:07 2015 UTC,"I could also see them trading away Mike Scott before the season for something other than a rostered player, and signing one of Petteway or GRIII. That may (or, obviously, may not) happen, but either way I bet that Bud likes the flexibility of the open spot enough not to sacrifice it for a 15th guy."
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,schroders_cat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:14 2015 UTC,The 15th man won't have a guaranteed contract (until some time in January at least).
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,ifthenwouldi,7,Mon Jul 20 20:58:19 2015 UTC,I'd say Petteway is the most likely now. We don't need another guard (Patterson) and I think GRIII is too similar to Baze. Petteway played about equal to them and would best bring something new to the roster.
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,wildhairguy,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:21 2015 UTC,petteway is a guard too.
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,Decatur_Psalm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:41:14 2015 UTC,Hawks had him starting at F on the box score.
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,wildhairguy,4,Mon Jul 20 15:59:54 2015 UTC,Exactly. GRIII is like a transition guy that's not developed. Petteways a nice wing with good size that can step into the 3 off the bench
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,personman1983,2,Mon Jul 20 02:28:10 2015 UTC,"Pettaway does not have good size, unless under-sized is good, and its not."
AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,knutts21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"Hawks need size at the position, GRIII is short, petteway need to add weight, and it'd be nice if patterson were bigger. No one in summer league has the size. Petteway isn't caught out of position as much as GRIII. It'd be nice to get a guy like jerami grant or Luc mbah a moute, but no one on the roster in summer league fits the 3 cleanly. Carroll didn't have the weight for the position, but he was okay in a system where 3's and 2's are interchangeable"

AtlantaHawks,3dwcya,personman1983,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:50:13 2015 UTC,"I thought we had two slots; completely forgot we signed Justin Holliday till I checked the depth chart.  My vote is for Patterson.  Patterson's upside is capped by his lack of athleticism and explosiveness... but I think he could come in and play ready minutes for us right now just based on his command of the floor, vision, and awareness. Plus, he brings enough shooting to the table that he's not a non-factor without the ball either. Defensively he's kinda like Korver in that he doesn't have great size and he lacks quickness so he'd get shredded by superstars like Harden or Durant, but I think he'd be an adequate team defender. He reminds me of a cross between Andre Miller from 3-4 years ago and current Paul Pierce.   Overall he could be a starter in the league, but he'd very much be a system guy - kinda like Diaw. Ideally he's better coming off the bench and either running the bench offense, or serving as a secondary facilitator. I think he'd be a good foil for Dennis when Dennis is playing out of control  I like Robinson's athleticism and tools, but he hasn't yet put it all together. TBH I'd rather have him than Justin Holiday, as a developmental player, but there's only one spot.  Petteway has played well in SL but I don't think he'll be able to contribute against real NBA talent.

GRIII: 22 in January  Petteway: 23 in October  Not only is GRIII more than a year younger, but this is his second year in the league meaning he is used to the schedule and coaching in the NBA. Petteway was not in a system at Nebraska. He will need to adjust to that."
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,wonderbreadftw,11,Tue Jul 21 00:29:26 2015 UTC,He's not even a starter on the summer league team
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,Muff09,-5,Sun Jul 19 21:29:22 2015 UTC,This.
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,Gtsweet,3,Sun Jul 19 23:12:53 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him given a chance in this system. Let Bud work with him and see how it pans out. No risk really in giving him a couple minutes here and there.
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,Crcsoccer1,3,Sun Jul 19 21:00:19 2015 UTC,To be honest he seems very similar to Bazemore just with less progress in him. I'd see Baze taking over for Thabo before I see GRIII.
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,wildhairguy,2,Sun Jul 19 22:03:57 2015 UTC,"GRIII is bigger and longer than Bazemore, I agree that Baze is more ready at the moment, but he's just too small to guard bigger forwards"
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,killjoyous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:55:31 2015 UTC,No.  He hasn't shown an ability to play in the NBA yet.  Tearing it up in college or summer league doesn't always translate.
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,humancartograph,0,Mon Jul 20 12:18:09 2015 UTC,"He's played in the nba before, didn't really pan out so well. I could see him riding the bench for a while for us"
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,meep6969,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:29 2015 UTC,"I think he could do well in our system given some time to develop.  We're pretty much only going to rely on him to hit open 3s and play some defense, and I think he could do that.  He's almost certainly not going to be ""our answer"" at the 3, but I could see him getting some solid backup minutes by the end of the season"
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,killjoyous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:39:44 2015 UTC,What?? He was literally a rookie last year
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,ajg47,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:35:58 2015 UTC,Literally wasn't good enough with being the exception of a rookie
AtlantaHawks,3dvajx,meep6969,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the answer comes in the form of a small 2 year contract for Dorell Wright or trading for a guy who doesn't have a big contract hit like jared dudley or maybe even a jerami grant. From the summer league I'd like Lamar Patterson or terran petteway, guys more polished to be in a system as complex as the hawks. Bud like his 1s 2's and 3's to be able to kind of flow between positions. But if we don't get a guy like jared dudley, sefalosha definitely gets the start. He's an upgrade from carroll on defense, he's longer, stronger, heavier, he's just not a great shooter, similar to what carroll was before adapting to the system. I think Thabo is the answer with a small contract like jerami grant or dorell wright, but worst case lamar or terran. Hopefully we get a godsend in the form of iguodala. He'd be perfect."

AtlantaHawks,3dpdy7,Dyson6,3,Sat Jul 18 15:06:38 2015 UTC,Way too much volt. Maybe just the border or something
AtlantaHawks,3dpdy7,KudzuChimp,3,Sat Jul 18 04:41:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're going this route. If you look at the unis, it's easy to see the volt is a highlight/trim color only. I think we'll see tiny bits of it to make the red, white and black pop, but no way they fill the paint with volt (he said hopefully).

AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,flurryzzz,7,Fri Jul 17 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"I think I'd rather have GRIII than the other two.  He has the most upside by far and is a better fit in general.   Patterson is a more polished player and is an amazing passer, but we have a logjam at the 2 spot and he's probably too small to play the 3. Petteway has, like /u/fireglz mentioned, a great motor.  That's something that would fit in great on our team, but he likes to iso more than I'm comfortable with and his shot seems inconsistent. GRIII is an insane athlete and has the length and size to be a 3 for our team.  He's definitely a project, his shot mechanics aren't great so his three pointer is inconsistent.  I think our player development staff can turn him into a serviceable shooter.  He's also got good lateral quickness which means he could turn into a very good defender."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,killjoyous,2,Fri Jul 17 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"Petteway either hot or cold on offense. I think he could be a great offensive role player.  He brings a lot to the table on defense, though."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,newchong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"I've always loved GR3, I just don't know why they'd take on another project type player. Holiday is in that vein and I still consider Baze to be too. Well, Baze is at least still a work in progress."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,ajg47,3,Sat Jul 18 02:19:56 2015 UTC,surprised Ashley hasn't stood out
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,ArianaArmy33,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:08 2015 UTC,Well Bud didn't mention any bigs so I'm asuuming he is set with them. We have 6 power forward/ centers on the roster so I guess Bud would only add a guy if it was a versatile wing to try and develop him.
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,Atlanta-Avenger,4,Fri Jul 17 18:41:12 2015 UTC,Petteway has one of the craziest motors i've ever seen. Really secure with the ball from what I can tell too. Would be stoked to have him on the roster.
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,fireglz,6,Fri Jul 17 18:15:41 2015 UTC,How much have did watch him at Nebraska? Because he is just a huge chucker.
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,wonderbreadftw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:55:50 2015 UTC,I didn't watch any of him at Nebraska except for the tourney and when they played Michigan. Hopefully our system helps his chucking nature.
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,fireglz,2,Sun Jul 19 00:11:16 2015 UTC,"So this might be a bad question, but what do they mean when they say ""should the Hawks consider having 15 players?"" It seems like everyone here is picking one of these three guys to be number 15, but I hear about other teams this offseason having 16, 17, 18 players. Do those teams have to cut down on some guys or what? Dumb question but I figured you guys would know."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,blessedmitch,2,Sat Jul 18 02:51:18 2015 UTC,"There are only 15 spots on an NBA roster. 13 spots for active players and 2 for reserves. A team can only have 15 guys under contract at any given time. The Hawks have exclusive rights to sign Lamar Patterson since they drafted him, but as he isn't under contract he doesn't count towards those 15 spots. They don't have rights to GRIII or Petteway, so any team could sign them if the Hawks choose not to."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,DEaster89,2,Sat Jul 18 02:58:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! With those other teams, do they ""have"" a lot of players but in actuality don't have more than 15 under contract and are looking to cut down their roster? I'll try to find an example."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,blessedmitch,2,Sat Jul 18 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"Correct. In the context of summer league the term 'cut' probably refers to a player on a summer league roster that doesn't make the regular season roster.  The Rockets waiving Tarik Black to sign Josh Smith back in December is the most recent example of a team releasing a player to open up a roster spot for another player that I can think of off the top of my head. They probably would've liked to have kept Black, but he was their 15th player under contract."
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,DEaster89,2,Sat Jul 18 03:34:16 2015 UTC,You know your stuff. Thanks!
AtlantaHawks,3dn0i6,blessedmitch,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure a team can have more than 15 players under some form of contract during the offseason and there's a deadline to pare it down to 15 prior to the regular season.

AtlantaHawks,3djt5w,Korver360windmill,2,Fri Jul 17 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"If Schroder improves his shot, he could make Jeff Teague expendable. Maybe next summer Teague could be the trade piece that lands the Hawks either a top 5 lottery pick or an All Star.   We have Horford's bird rights so I expect him to resign next summer. Bazemore will be a free agent, he's been doing a bunch of marketing for the team this summer, I think he resigns too.   That leaves a lot of money to go after a good SF. Swing for the fences and try to get Kevin Durant. If that fails there will be Nicolas Batum, Harrison Barnes, Gerald Green, Danilo Gallinari, Ersan Ilyasova, and Mo Harkless. If we're looking for a post-Korver succession plan, then Bradley Beal is there."

AtlantaHawks,3dkvop,mehjbmeh,7,Fri Jul 17 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"Brandon Ashley has been really impressive. A mobile 6'9 with a nice stroke from three, good rebounder, and good around the rim.  After reading all of his draft notes, looks like teams don't think he's physical enough and is inconsistent defensively. He sounds like a taller and longer Mike Scott. I think he could give a couple of good minutes off the bench as a stretch 4 in our system."
AtlantaHawks,3dkvop,chessbrah,4,Fri Jul 17 02:48:39 2015 UTC,"Idk how many people we'll pick up from this squad, but I wouldn't mind Ashley and Petteway. And Holt. And Patterson."

Pretty much going to be our instant offense off the bench sixth man kinda guy"
AtlantaHawks,3dk2gj,tylewis628,0,Thu Jul 16 22:55:22 2015 UTC,I see him taking the starting role and moving Korver to the bench or less minutes. With Korver's age and injury I think THJ will have more oppurtunities.

AtlantaHawks,3dk2gj,Atlanta-Avenger,6,Fri Jul 17 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"Tiago is so good at diving to the rim off pick n rolls, Dennis kills at pick n rolls, THJ will be moving a lot in the system, Moose/Mike at PF can space things out some, Kent at SF brings perimeter D (Dennis too) and he slashes. I've thought a lot about this second unit, THJ should see great improvement. Having Kent and Dennis D next to him and Splitter behind him should really help hide his defensive deficiencies. Extremely excited to see the second unit play on the same page."

AtlantaHawks,3dk2gj,ajg47,3,Fri Jul 17 01:58:59 2015 UTC,If he's a Mike Scott that can finish at the rim and not shoot the team into a slump then that's pretty much all I can ask.  Numbers-wise? He'll shoot his highest % from 3 and hopefully be a net positive player when he's on the floor.

AtlantaHawks,3di71n,wildhairguy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. If he gets his positioning down he's definitely an upgrade over Elton Brand.

Second, everyone is freaking talking about him like he was a lottery pick and ""omg we aren't going to be as good defensively"" or ""omg we need to sign a vet wing""....Demarre Carroll wasn't even averaging 6 pts when he got here. Trust and believe in our development program. We will always be a small market team and we don't 'get' or 'sign' big names. We will hardly sign big name players but WE WILL develop them.

AtlantaHawks,3de64y,Capn_Barboza,6,Wed Jul 15 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"I went to Michigan and I really want to see GRIII succeed, but as a Hawks fan first I think a guy like Patterson or Petteway could add more to the team this season. Robinson's shooting percentage has never been consistently good, even in college. Sure he's athletic and he's got potential, but I feel like people have been saying that for a long time and I haven't seen big enough improvements."
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,jjfreshhh,3,Wed Jul 15 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"GRIII is very athletic but I feel like he needs to find his true game. At times he plays a little out of control, he needs to just slow down and let the game come to him"
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,draftdaydeion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:53 2015 UTC,Petteway was chucking in that last D League game.

AtlantaHawks,3de64y,jjfreshhh,10,Wed Jul 15 20:30:48 2015 UTC,I think Thabo can step in for Carroll pretty well. I was really impressed with how well his offense improved I as the season went along and the way he alters shots was something I always noticed.
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,bearg0d,3,Wed Jul 15 17:09:09 2015 UTC,I really hope Thabo and Baze stay healthy or we're in for some trouble.

AtlantaHawks,3de64y,NeonSubtlety,-8,Fri Jul 17 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"So he pretty much confirmed Splitter off the bench, which means we're sticking with Al at the 5. Not sure about y'all but I feel Millsap should go bench and Tiago start."
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,yyyyydjrsr,11,Wed Jul 15 20:03:12 2015 UTC,Millsap isn't coming off the bench as the highest paid player on the Hawks.
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,rjdab,8,Wed Jul 15 20:12:59 2015 UTC,You can't be serious are you? Why would we bring a $18 million player of the bench. Especially one that has the talent of Millsap
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,draftdaydeion,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"I mean he's the highest paid, but it's tough to argue he's better than Al. With the Al/Sap combo we were exposed on size, and neither of those guys plays the 3. It seems strange to start a guy just because he's paid the most."
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,yyyyydjrsr,4,Wed Jul 15 20:20:00 2015 UTC,"Its not just that he's paid the most, its that when he's on the floor he is a huge offensive threat. Thiago doesn't bring you much offense, just his ability to fill the paint and grab you boards. We were exposed on size only against the Cavs with the Thompson & Mozgov combo in the eastern conference finals. Yes size is an important factor, but its not everything. Just ask the championship Warriors when Coach Kerr decided to sit a struggling Bogut, for a VERY undersized Draymund Green at center. HE IS 6'7"
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,draftdaydeion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of different factors to that though. The warriors had 4 guard scoring threats with that small ball lineup, forcing the cavs to match them rather than simply outsizing them. They didn't play mozgov and thompson together at all really after going small. Our guys were much colder and less threatening during their series so small ball wouldn't have been as intimidating (which could honestly change next year, making my point moot). Also Draymond, despite being 6'7 has shown he's an elite defender of post players despite that size, which you can't say for Millsap.   Playing Horford and Millsap 4/5 is ideal for the cavs because they can play both bigs without a real defensive liability. Whereas Thompson couldn't guard Barnes or Iguodala."
AtlantaHawks,3de64y,yyyyydjrsr,3,Wed Jul 15 21:33:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, however you don't sign a player that much just to sit him. If they really wanted to have Millsap off the bench, then they'd offer him 2-5 mil a year. Like Scott, Mack, even Dennis."

AtlantaHawks,3df6c2,Blitzcregge,5,Wed Jul 15 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Hole: size on the wing  Atlanta will have a different look to its roster next season after losing DeMarre Carroll in free agency and trading for former Spurs starting center Tiago Splitter. The Hawks also acquired Tim Hardaway Jr. from New York, but there remains no ready-made replacement for Carroll in a starting lineup that was one of the most stable units in the league in 2014-15. Mike Budenholzer will have to mix and match between undersized offensive options (Kent Bazemore, Hardaway) and more defensive-minded players (Thabo Sefolosha, Justin Holiday). Kyle Korver can play some at the position as well. On paper, all of those players are more 2 than 3, so ideally you'd like to see one more wing who has a little more length and physical presence than anyone in that group.  The Hawks have 14 roster spots accounted for, using cap space to fill in their open slots. It appears they have done so without using their $2.8 million room exception. Atlanta does have the wing options we mentioned, and it's possible that Budenholzer prefers to stay flexible with his last roster spot, perhaps by keeping around a summer league player like Glenn Robinson III on a non-guaranteed deal at first. As far as players left on the market, Dorell Wright might make some sense. He wouldn't likely step into the starting lineup, so rather than tie up his last open slot, Budenholzer could well bide his time to see who might become available during the season."

AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,TCorlz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:19:03 2015 UTC,Playing shake it off during a time out? gross
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,Aviator157,-6,Mon Jul 13 22:10:05 2015 UTC,Edy has been averaging more fouls than points. He's awful.
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,Muff09,11,Mon Jul 13 23:01:56 2015 UTC,He has no offensive game right now.....I thought this was known by everyone? Defensive/rebounding big that may develop an offensive game.
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,Daphne1895,6,Mon Jul 13 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"He actually has a nice touch. He doesn't have any moves and he's not going to take too many shots, but I've been impressed since last SL with his ability to score outside of dunks."
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,BaconOfTruth,10,Tue Jul 14 00:52:19 2015 UTC,Have you seen his defense? The other team can't even attempt a layup cause they know he's there.
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,mitchymcgee,9,Mon Jul 13 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"He can block shots, get boards, and make his free throws. That is really all we need from him honestly.. I like what I'm seeing in him. Only thing I would want from him is a little more aggression."
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,k10taylor,2,Tue Jul 14 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"and to be fair, dude is probably still trying to feel it all out and get a sense for what's going on."
AtlantaHawks,3d69o1,mehjbmeh,2,Tue Jul 14 00:36:36 2015 UTC,"He is still trying to learn a TON of new stuff and feel it out but also, it's hard for bigs to shine in summer league because the guards are so ball dominant/bad. They missed him for good looks a bunch of time. Dennis will be great at finding him for easy lobs."
AtlantaHawks,3d50yz,thrashfan,4,Mon Jul 13 16:03:58 2015 UTC,looks like we will have plenty of money to both pursue free agents and re-sign Al next offseason.
AtlantaHawks,3d50yz,WP4114,6,Mon Jul 13 17:44:21 2015 UTC,Chances are if Bazemore continues to improve his 3 and D signing Horford and Bazemore will be our only moves
AtlantaHawks,3d50yz,Capn_Barboza,2,Mon Jul 13 20:37:53 2015 UTC,I'm okay with those moves.
AtlantaHawks,3d50yz,mehjbmeh,6,Mon Jul 13 21:57:42 2015 UTC,Edy is gonna play 1999 mins this year.

AtlantaHawks,3d5khy,tylewis628,5,Mon Jul 13 18:22:18 2015 UTC,Bazemore at the three spot and probably THJ at the two spot.

AtlantaHawks,3d5khy,schroders_cat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:30:11 2015 UTC,I actually just posted a poll on that yesterday asking who on the SL roster the fans thought deserved a roster spot the most and GRIII blew the others away. Really hope we give him a roster spot

AtlantaHawks,3d4f6m,gargoyle45,10,Mon Jul 13 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who lurks here and very rarely posts on reddit as whole, I have to say this situation was handled in such a bad manner. I work during most Hawks games and can't catch too many. Martinsek's highlights were such a lifesaver for me. Without them I would be basically judging the Hawks season on box scores and stats.  For how much work and time Martinsek devotes to us Hawks fans its no wonder he doesn't want to come back here. Thrash's lame reasoning for taking away his mod status doesn't resonate with me and he comes off as being so petty. Ask yourself, would a guy who puts in so much work on this sub and the nba sub ruin his reputation by intentionally messing up our sub? Common sense says no.   Just my two cents. Sorry for formatting or spelling mistakes, posting this on my phone."

I think that would have been a great addition for us, he still has a ton of upside, just buried behind Harris and Gordon. I'm pretty high on Holliday's potential but more wing depth is always good."
AtlantaHawks,3d2aqz,aghaud,10,Sun Jul 12 23:15:56 2015 UTC,Freaking NICE getting Holiday for the minimum. Who would y'all want to sign now with that $2.8M? Dorell Wright? Maybe Jordan Hill if we're worried about Tiago's calves? Or would it be smarter to leave that last roster spot open until mid-season?
AtlantaHawks,3d2aqz,dakane328,3,Sun Jul 12 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"Not really relevant, but Jordan Hill went to my high school. Would be kinda cool to see him on the hawks."

AtlantaHawks,3d2aqz,DarthJones1,5,Mon Jul 13 01:00:19 2015 UTC,How the hell do you guys get 60 wins and operate under the cap?
AtlantaHawks,3d2aqz,theycallmebp,5,Mon Jul 13 04:13:44 2015 UTC,IMO its because we got handcuffed by the two year deals that Millsap and JYD were signed on which made us unable to have the birdrights to go over the cap to resign both. if we had them under a third year each it would be a completely different story. it is amazing though how we are able to find success like this. fingers crossed it continues.

As I wrote to Abdiesel, you got someone who is very low risk and quite high reward - well freaking done on your FO's part.  Only downside (that I don't think I've mentioned anywhere) I would say is this dude is taking skinny to a whole new level. His legs look like straight up twigs. Hopefully he can use the summer to fill out a bit"
AtlantaHawks,3d2gi7,thrashfan,15,Mon Jul 13 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"Edy gets coached 100% of the time he's on the floor. Coaches constantly barking some kind of instructions to him.  Patteway is a natural leader in how he is interacting with others.  Patterson is one fired up sonofabitch. No need to light a fire in his ass, he's going 10,000 mph."

AtlantaHawks,3d1ns4,ArianaArmy33,3,Sun Jul 12 23:12:02 2015 UTC,I don't think he played bad but he seemed timid and uncomfortable to me.
AtlantaHawks,3d1ns4,lincolnluxor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:14:00 2015 UTC,I think that is going to be the norm for a while at least on the offensive end. Defensively is where I want to see him settle in.   I still think that some people are going to be disappointed with Tavares because they have some unreal expectations for him.
AtlantaHawks,3d1ns4,lincolnluxor,2,Sun Jul 12 23:16:40 2015 UTC,Excited to see if Edy is more comfortable. Hoping Lamar Patterson can build off of last game...

AtlantaHawks,3czplx,theDrunkWookie,4,Sun Jul 12 06:37:04 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely. A lot of what he did isn't really on his stats so much as what's missing from the stats of who he was defending.

It wasn't a mod  Sek, since you want to air this out instead of replying to my multiple attempts to talk to you one-on-one lets do it this way.  First off JB isnt fully aware of what was going on so don't be upset with him.   Yes, I changed the password. This was immature of me. I should have spoken with you about my grievances before doing this. (Edit: But you have to admit having two users on the Twitter has proven problematic, if you decide to come back we need to address this) I was not talking about you with that comment, or anyone particular. I removed your permissions because after the drama between you and I, perhaps shortsightedly, believed that you would be the type to try and hurt the sub (whether by deleting things or removing mods) Also JMo had more because I was working out permissions.

I am sorry for belittling you. I did not realize you took what I was saying to heart (If you are talking about things said in the GroupMe)   You did a great job posting game threads, producing awesome content for the sub and Twitter and I handled all of this VERY poorly. However, you left. You wouldn't talk to me the other day. I never wanted you to remove yourself from the mod team. And honestly I was foolish to kick you off the Twitter like I did, I should have talked to you about it. After speaking with JB yesterday I had come to the conclusion that I did this all wrong. If you will DM we can talk about your role on the sub moving forward, if that still interests you."

AtlantaHawks,3cvjsr,tocohills,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:58:44 2015 UTC,Lamar Patterson has the inside track. Had a good first summer league game. Spent the year in Turkey. Brandon Ashley is also a possibility.
AtlantaHawks,3cvjsr,Atlanta-Avenger,-7,Sun Jul 12 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"Snag Josh Smith or sign a summer league standout. Terran Pettaway has a very hardworking attitude and I think he would do great under Buds system.

The squad is full of undersized wings who have virtually no shot of making the team with Bazemore, Hardaway Jr. and Holiday all under guaranteed contract."
AtlantaHawks,3cvjsr,DEaster89,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:50:53 2015 UTC,Good recap. With Holliday signed it would seem pointless to sign a smaller guard but I see no harm in signing Pettaway or Patterson even if it is just to move them into the d-league.

AtlantaHawks,3cuvnk,AtlantaHawks,15,Fri Jul 10 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"The Deal  Hawks get: Center Tiago Splitter  Spurs get: Rights to Georgios Printezis, protected 2017 second-round pick  Atlanta Hawks: B+  By acquiring Splitter, whom he coached as an assistant in San Antonio, Atlanta head coach Mike Budenholzer (also calling the shots during the offseason in his new role as president of basketball operations) will have an embarrassment of riches in the frontcourt next season. The ability to bring Splitter off the bench behind starters Al Horford and Paul Millsap, both All-Stars, will give the Hawks a different look and allow them to play multiple styles.  Atlanta has long been enamored with the idea of acquiring a 7-footer and moving Horford to power forward, and Splitter is the best 7-footer the franchise has had since trading Dikembe Mutombo to Philadelphia -- 14 years ago. He also came cheap, given San Antonio's need to clear room to sign LaMarcus Aldridge. The 30-year-old Printezis is unlikely to ever come to the NBA, and depending on the protection, the Hawks might not be giving up a draft pick either.  A Splitter-Horford frontcourt will be much more defensive minded than the Horford-Millsap pairing. Atlanta will no longer have the ability to space the floor at every position. But Splitter is used to playing with another big man, which certainly never created any problems for the Spurs' offense. And he will upgrade the Hawks' interior defense while giving them a newfound offensive rebounding dimension.  Alas, re-signing Millsap and adding Splitter took up all of Atlanta's cap space. (In fact, the Hawks had to waive Austin Daye to complete the trade because of Splitter's 15 percent trade kicker.) So Atlanta had to go cheap to replace departed starting forward DeMarre Carroll, signing Justin Holiday away from the Golden State Warriors.  In this free-agent market, it's unclear how effectively the Hawks could have replaced Carroll using the money they spent on Splitter. The only unrestricted free-agent wing who went for a similar amount was Arron Afflalo to the New York Knicks, and the smaller Afflalo isn't as versatile -- or effective -- defensively as Carroll. Given that alternative, trading for Splitter and trying to find the next Carroll looks like the right call.  San Antonio Spurs: A  It's still a little surprising the Spurs couldn't get anything of value for Splitter, given his reasonable contract. And the unexpected growth of the salary cap to $70 million would have made it easier for San Antonio to clear enough cap space for Aldridge and Tim Duncan's bargain deal by moving Boris Diaw, allowing the Spurs to keep another 7-footer on the roster to play alongside Aldridge and David West.  Alas, San Antonio couldn't have known all of that when this deal was agreed to on the opening day of free agency, or even by the Fourth of July when Aldridge committed to joining the team. And it's possible the Spurs were just ready to move on from Splitter because of concerns about his recurring calf injuries, which limited him during the postseason. All things considered, it's hard to quibble much with a move that allowed San Antonio to emerge as the biggest winner of free agency and a co-favorite in the Western Conference."
AtlantaHawks,3cvbg1,thrashfan,7,Sat Jul 11 01:59:44 2015 UTC,"Edy looked a little slow on defense, but was a nice presence on the inside. He is obviously very raw like we thought he was going to be so he's gonna need a lot of work. I don't see very much playing time other than garbage time."

AtlantaHawks,3cvbg1,LickMyMeatus,2,Sat Jul 11 02:53:25 2015 UTC,Moose and Edy underwhelmed. I'm really hoping Pettaway or Patterson get signed just to try them out. After cutting Daye there is cap left so they could add them.

AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,mehjbmeh,6,Fri Jul 10 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"Other teams in the east have gotten better. Demarre is a big loss on both ends of the floor. Kyle will be a year older, coming off of two surgeries and the playoffs laid out how to defend him and the Hawks offense. The Hawks don't have anything to prove during the regular season and aren't going to have the type of momentum that winning 19 games gives you."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,BeautifulMohammad,20,Fri Jul 10 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"LeBron. As much as I love the Hawks, the Cavs bad start last year was due to chemistry issues, and I honestly think they have gotten that worked out.   I still feel without a doubt we are the 2nd best team in the east though, even without demarre.   prepares for the down votes"
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,FutureShock25,0,Fri Jul 10 00:44:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a down vote worthy comment, but I don't think it's true either.  LeBron has only won 2 Finals, and it's no consequence they were with Miami not Cleveland. The fact is that LeBron can't ""lead"" a team to the big win. Unless he can play bully ball he just doesn't have it in him and I don't think he can bully an Atlanta team that knows what they're up against now (and wants to avenge a sweep) and a Miami team that just wants to slap LeBron in the face. The Cavs have been annointed with the East and I think that's the death kiss, if that team hadn't been so hot they don't advance at all, and they're going in expecting to advance. I think it's a recipe to be upset.  Further let's look at coaching. Atlanta has Bud, Miami has Spolstra, and the Cavs have LeBron. Let's face it. He's the coach not Blatt. That's a weakness. End of story he's not going to gameplan objectively, and he can't because he has to play while coaching.  I would put money down that Atlanta and Miami finish ahead of Cleveland and the first one to meet Cleveland will upset them in the playoffs."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,killjoyous,15,Fri Jul 10 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"Cleveland made the finals without Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love healthy.  That's 2 out of their big 3.  Until someone proves otherwise, they're the favorites.  I do think that we match up better with them this year due to our new size, but they have the more talented team."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,jmonumber3,2,Fri Jul 10 01:19:03 2015 UTC,"I think that Lebron without Kyrie or Love meant that he had to take over and play at a level that he doesn't usually (while he is still capable of). They also had to slow down place and play a different game than they were used to so it was a different scheme without those two. Plus, who knows how the stats change without a ""scrappy"" player like Dely or a rebounding machine like TT starting. I'm not saying you're wrong, but saying that having two players means that they win is like saying ""if we won game 1, we would've won the series."" Maybe they/we do but bother things change the game plan and the whole landscape changes."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,killjoyous,3,Fri Jul 10 01:33:06 2015 UTC,"Right now they should still be the clear favorite.  This was their first year playing together, 2 of their best 3 players missed serious time in the playoffs due to injury, and they still swept us.  I know we were playing with a lot of injuries too, but their roster is just more talented than ours.  Maybe some of our players will break out this year and prove me wrong, but right now the Cavs look like the best team in the East."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,beefsupreme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:40:20 2015 UTC,And we were without our best defender who would have been on LBJ when Demarre was out. We can play what if all day but that gets tiring.
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,PilateBlack,3,Fri Jul 10 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"LeBron has only won 2 Finals, and it's no consequence they were with Miami not Cleveland. The fact is that LeBron can't ""lead"" a team to the big win.   LeBron is the most impactful player since Jordan (and since Jordan never had to win a championship on his own, we'll never know if LeBron or Jordan is the MIOAT). Sure, he can't win a championship with a supporting cast entirely comprising scrubs, but no one can come closer. I know this doesn't technically contradict what you said, but your comment comes off as trying to shit on LeBron for not winning by himself, which isn't fair."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,GT2018,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right. Cleveland was way better than us last year. I think we actually won the regular season series, but they completely dominated the playoff series. They were by far better. Now that their chemistry issues are pretty much fixed, they should improve in the regular season too."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,poerhouse,5,Fri Jul 10 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"To quote the President: ""Aaaahh, Look....""  I love this team and am over the moon for our philosophy, image and staff. As a lifelong Hawks fan (and I remember going to 'Nique era games) I could not be happier to be a fan right now. That said, as cliche as it's become, our team is called SpursEast for a reason- and the Spurs would not have become the Spurs without the Admiral, Timmy, Manu and Tony (and now Kawhi and LA). Al has a chance at being a Hall of Famer, Denis has a lot of promise but is still very green. Jeff, though great, still eludes general discussion of the best PG's in the league these days and Paul is the ultimate workhorse but no floor general. As much as last January made me want to believe that we could beat the 'no superstar' talk, our cooling off collectively without a clear leader to pull us up through an entire series showed.   Listen- I think we'll still be in the top 3 in the east this season; and I think we'll end up doing a little better in the playoffs, but the NBA knows who we are and what we do now. They'll be ready for us and our record will reflect that this time around. To be frank, I now have come to believe that with this being today's NBA, to take the title we will need a superstar. At least one. None of our guys are there yet, though someone may emerge or we may actually wind up doing the impossible and attracting a big name someday soon. That said, I'm still gonna have a BLAST watching this team this year no matter what happens."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,poerhouse,0,Fri Jul 10 02:51:57 2015 UTC,"My problem with that is ""needing a Superstar to win it"" is a self fulfilling prophecy.  If any team wins it the media will generate a ""superstar"" or two within a team.  If Atlanta won it all last year we'd hear non-stop how Horford or Millsap was our SuperStar.  The only thing that separates a ""role player"" and a ""Superstar"" is wins."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,poerhouse,2,Fri Jul 10 15:56:45 2015 UTC,I see your point- but what it all comes down to is 'the extra gear' all the analysts were talking about towards the end of the season. Our guys didn't have it. We need a guy/guys who do. Is it coaching? Training? Timing? I guess we'll see...
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,Daphne1895,2,Fri Jul 10 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"what about experience?  Let's face it, the only guy who had been in conference final before was DNP: Police Brutality.  I think getting beat down in the Finals will inspire the team far more than break it.  I mean like about all the interviews, they all said the same thing, they didn't play their best and they knew it. They were going to reevaluate and come back.   I fully believe that Delledova getting in their heads, JR having the perfect game, and LeBron going off was a perfect storm far more than it was indicative of the Cavs as a whole.  I mean objectively speaking, I never saw the Cavs play a better series than that, and likewise I never saw Atlanta play a WORSE series."
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,DBac7812,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"All true- and all valid. Thing is, IMO the reason the Warriors took it in the finals is two fold: 1.) Cav injuries and 2.) the fact that they had multiple guys who kicked into 6th gear AND played like a team. I'm not saying we don't have anyone who has that gear, but we haven't seen it yet. I believe we'll get there... but I just think it'll still be too early for us this season. I'd love to eat my words and be proven wrong, of course!"
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,Atlanta-Avenger,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:31:43 2015 UTC,See that's wierd. I thought in the Finals the Cavs glass slippers came off while Golden State played like they always did.  I think you saw the vs Celtics and vs Hawks Cavs series as closer to the real Cavs than the Bulls and Warriors series.  I think the oppisite. I think the Cavs flaws were overlooked because James and career nights from role players
AtlantaHawks,3cqqsz,Shade_Raven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"I don’t really think Chicago was that impressive against Cleveland. They won two games, but one of those was helped by Cleveland trying to go small and starting Miller who is a pretty bad defender, and the other ended on a Rose bank shot 3. Chicago could have easily lost in 5 again, which they’ve usually done against James. 2 of the games in this series weren’t close, and there was a 3rd one in which Chicago was down by 17 but managed to do a too little, too late comeback."

AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,Hot_Lanta,3,Thu Jul 9 17:28:14 2015 UTC,Luckily he will always be a bottom option for us than!
AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,C-Jammin,4,Thu Jul 9 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"We signed DeMarre for 2 years, $5M and he turned into a terrific player in Bud's system.  We're signing Holiday to close to the minimum.  This is not to say he's going to be as good as DeMarre Carroll became, but I've heard some high opinions on him and obviously Bud feels he fits.  Maybe this is the same sort of thing with DeMarre.  Get a cheap guy and put him in the system and turn him into a really solid player.  I think there is some potential here."
AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,red__falcon,2,Thu Jul 9 22:29:38 2015 UTC,"Mis-read balling as bailing for a second there, thought he had done a DeAndre on us."

AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,datzevo,2,Thu Jul 9 22:26:36 2015 UTC,I never knew Chris Tucker can shoot the ball like that
AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,jolley517,2,Fri Jul 10 03:46:55 2015 UTC,Those open 3's he was hitting reminds me of DeMarre knocking down those same open shots last year. Could be a guy we develop just the same way
AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,wildhairguy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:22:20 2015 UTC,I feel confident that either him or baze will be producing at a DMC level by the playoffs and the other will be a rock solid rotation player. If this happens cavs will be sweating.
AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,_Sumaes_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:53:22 2015 UTC,Another good clip showing his all around skills. At the very least he will be a great role player for you guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSU7tWqffN8
AtlantaHawks,3cp0at,GT2018,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:14 2015 UTC,Oh man your video is way better than the one I found. He's definitely a good shooter and he finishes around the rim pretty well too
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,-Lemur,16,Wed Jul 8 22:39:09 2015 UTC,I like it. He's long and has a smooth shot based on one YouTube video I saw
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,flurryzzz,10,Wed Jul 8 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"Man, this guy wasn't even on my radar, but the more I learn about him, the more this seems like the next DeMarre Carroll signing. Great shooter, great defender, long, athletic, and fairly young to boot. I'm already a little nervous that two years from now he'll have outperformed his contract so much that we won't be able to afford to re-sign him. Lot of potential.  For what it's worth, this is really shaping up into a quietly great offseason IMHO. I know Budcox took some heat for the draft night trade, but this kid seems like he's 100% better as a backup wing option than Kelly Oubre would have been. Just my two cents."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,aghaud,2,Thu Jul 9 00:11:28 2015 UTC,Hes pretty much the 3pt shooting version of Kent Bazemore
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,_Sumaes_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:56:13 2015 UTC,"Best part of all: as a Dubs fan I've seen plenty of videos of Justin getting extra shots up after practice. His big problem is confidence, strength, and an overeager nature leading to foolish bites on pump fakes and crosses"

AtlantaHawks,3clvej,theDrunkWookie,6,Thu Jul 9 03:03:47 2015 UTC,"I like it. It's not a big signing. But he's young, athletic, and has room for improvement. Should be a good fit in our system."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,schroders_cat,9,Wed Jul 8 22:55:44 2015 UTC,"He's a 6'6 2-guard, probably could defend smaller SFs."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Bankingitbig,6,Wed Jul 8 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"He's pretty skinny for the 3 spot, but hopefully he can guard smaller SFs. Wish we would have gotten Wesley Johnson especially after seeing he signed for the min."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,aghaud,4,Wed Jul 8 22:52:50 2015 UTC,The 7-foot wingspan certainly doesn't hurt. His dimensions are right in between Thabo's and Bazemore's.
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Starsy,7,Wed Jul 8 23:38:41 2015 UTC,"Let's see if we care...   11.1 minutes per game in 59 appearances. 13.9/4.0/2.6/0.7/2.2 per 36 minutes. 12.1 PER, 0.498 TS%.   Good enough for third string SG, behind Korver and Bazemore."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,velocirappa,7,Wed Jul 8 23:00:55 2015 UTC,He also had a string of starts when Klay was out and played really well. Hope he does well for you guys.

AtlantaHawks,3clvej,theDrunkWookie,7,Wed Jul 8 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, mistook your comment. THJ is Tim Hardaway Jr. Probably gonna be second string SG. I could see Bazemore playing more SF this year."

AtlantaHawks,3clvej,killjoyous,5,Wed Jul 8 22:41:30 2015 UTC,Why? Shelvin can play the 1 or 2 and Holiday can play the 2 or 3
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,cripplercrawlspace,2,Wed Jul 8 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"There's no way Shelvin keeps any time at the 2 with the acquisitions of Hardaway Jr and Holiday. The only reason he even saw time there last season was due to a lack of depth at the position. As for Holiday, the 3 isn't really an option for him at this point, but maybe it could happen down the line if he puts on some serious weight. Shelvin can find a role as the 3rd string PG on this team, but I think it's more likely that he's packaged along with Mike for help at the 3."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,killjoyous,3,Wed Jul 8 23:16:01 2015 UTC,"We still need at least three ball handlers on the team in case Jeff or Dennis get injured.  We could use more help at the 3 and I could see us moving Scott, but Shelvin is a valuable backup point guard."

AtlantaHawks,3clvej,chessbrah,3,Thu Jul 9 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think so because his contract is guaranteed this year and it doesn't help the team to cut him. Teams can have a max roster size of 15 and can dress 13. Hawks will be at 14 under contract after Justin Holiday (assuming we pick up the option on moose and daye). Korver and Thabo will begin the season inactive so he'll be on the active roster at the start. Once those 2 comes back, Hawks will probably send someone down to the D-League, probably Austin Daye."

AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Muff09,-16,Fri Jul 10 00:09:47 2015 UTC,This guy couldn't string 5 minutes for the Warriors and now we depend on him to replace Carroll?? lol terrible signing
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Podlaskie,7,Wed Jul 8 23:08:55 2015 UTC,"He's not replacing Carroll, he adds depth. Also Bazemore barely played for the Warriors as well so that doesn't really mean much."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Capn_Barboza,5,Wed Jul 8 23:12:34 2015 UTC,The warriors had the most 3 and D guys on a team I've ever seen
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,NeonSubtlety,2,Wed Jul 8 23:46:34 2015 UTC,He's not replacing carroll.  Sef is.  Obviously.
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Muff09,-4,Wed Jul 8 23:13:21 2015 UTC,If we depend on Sef as a starter we're in trouble
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,NeonSubtlety,5,Wed Jul 8 23:14:52 2015 UTC,"Sef and the other 4 starters was our best lineup last season, statistically.  Sef was fantastic last year."
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,Capn_Barboza,0,Wed Jul 8 23:16:24 2015 UTC,Except he's another year older coming off a leg injury
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,NeonSubtlety,2,Wed Jul 8 23:51:04 2015 UTC,The injury is a fair point.  But there's little reason to think one more year would affect thabo substantially more than it would carroll.
AtlantaHawks,3clvej,C-Jammin,3,Thu Jul 9 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"I think when we signed Carroll, no one expected him to be anything but some quality defensive minutes off the bench.  It's all about the system."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,BlitzArchangel,3,Wed Jul 8 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"If Mavs land DJ and make a move for a point guard, they are legit. Ty Lawson maybe? I really don't give a shit about the DJ drama though and think he should do what's best for his family."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,justcamp,2,Thu Jul 9 00:34:50 2015 UTC,I don't know. I think you are putting to much stock in Wes. He was good before the injury sure but the Achilles is such a terrible injury.
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,cosmo_bear,2,Thu Jul 9 01:01:11 2015 UTC,"If he likes his role in LA, he shouldn't have agreed to leave in the first place. If he thinks his role will change in LA, then he's in for a rude awakening. He will never be more than a defender/lob target on that team."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Atlanta-Avenger,2,Thu Jul 9 01:03:28 2015 UTC,"Well if he goes to LA Parsons will be upset, and fans will boo Jordan. I hope he likes being a villain."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Bankingitbig,2,Thu Jul 9 01:27:24 2015 UTC,Hawks should trade Splitter and other assets for Parsons..
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Im_just_a_lamp,3,Thu Jul 9 03:16:02 2015 UTC,"I think this just shows me that even DJ thinks he isn't that great offensively and his free throw rate probably wouldn't be as easily dismissed if he was with another team. Otherwise, I've lost respect for him just because of how poorly he's handled this and let it get this far. On a side note, I don't agree with how some people are saying this situation is super fun mostly because there's a team that's getting screwed over because one dude is going back on his commitment without saying a word to the guys that were giving him exactly what he was asking for"
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,bigboston93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:53:56 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with being more realistic about your own abilities i dont think he will ever evolve into much of a offensive threat. So it would make sense for him to stay in the clips i think cuban just sweet talked him(hes best friends with his agent).  I  dre realised hey i cant shoot free throws how the hell and am i gonna become a offensive threat especially when the mavs pieces are not that enticing anyway.
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Im_just_a_lamp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:11 2015 UTC,"Him being realistic about himself is not a problem in itself. I actually like that it seems he knows he is a rebounding specialist, but the free throw shooting is still something I can't wrap my head around which is a different conversation. In regards to becoming an offensive threat, Carlisle's offense seemingly works for big men like DJ as we've seen with Tyson Chandler"
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,bigboston93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:25:41 2015 UTC,Fair point but do the mavs have as much to offer. With an aging dirk and not many other prospects why would you leave the clippers for the same money? I dont get what his pull to the mavs was anyway. Even if i hated chris paul he basically provides room service the way he assist.
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Im_just_a_lamp,2,Thu Jul 9 03:29:05 2015 UTC,That's a legitimate concern and from a basketball perspective it does make sense for him to sign back with LA. I hate that he is going back on his commitment without talking to the Mavs before all of this blew up to what it is and that's why I have lost respect for him not because of any of the basketball reasons
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,bigboston93,2,Thu Jul 9 03:42:09 2015 UTC,Agreed I think he handled it wrong and it is not how ant grown man should handle situations. But i personally just have a hard time feeling bad for organizations in general. Not to mention they won a chip not to long agi. I do feel bad for their die hard fans though and hope it does not hurt their chances to bad.
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Skirpy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that LA is the perfect place for DJ to be. I can't imagine anything better than having CP3 be able to slash it inside, draw the big men out and just lob me the ball almost at will. I know he wants to have plays run for him, and I'm sure Dallas would do more of that for him, but I just don't think it is possible for him to put up the types of offensive numbers he did in LA without an elite point guard.   But as a fan, I have always loathed the Clippers bitching and moaning after every. Single. Call. I want this to blow up in their face so bad."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,DEaster89,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:35:50 2015 UTC,WES WILCOX GOTTA GET IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND STEAL WES MATTHEWS
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,jmonumber3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:35:42 2015 UTC,"What DJ did was by all means legal and legit but at the same time a huge fuck you to the mavs. It's one thing to go back on your word but it's another to not be man enough to tell the people who you are letting down that you made a mistake. It's not just a matter of professionalism but you always hear how the league is also a brotherhood. The rest of the NBA, especially those with ties to the Mavs won't forget this.   Tl;Dr: everyone makes mistakes, be a man and own up to them instead of not answering your phone and playing cards behind locked doors."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,Intercepting,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"It was so funny and pathetic with the way the Clips handled this. First they all come to his house and surround him. Griffin literally blocks the front door so nobody else can get in, and they stay there and make sure no one even tries to get in until midnight when they sign the contract. Then I'm almost certain that Griffin slept in that tent outside of Jordan's house at like 2-3 AM.  Feel bad for Cuban though. This really fucked over the Mavs and now we're going to see the aftermath here in about an hour or two. And Cuban is a smart guy, so he'll find a way to make the Clips pay for this."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,joannes3000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"I think the only thing that truly bothers me is that DeAndre allegedly didn't take any calls from Cuban last night. That's kind of lame. At least have your agent make that call. Something, anything. Don't just sit there and NOT answer the phone."
AtlantaHawks,3cm4i0,OldOrder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:38 2015 UTC,He handled it poorly but I don't have a problem with him going back to the clippers. Mavs should have pushed him to sign a contract immediately while they were still in his ear. Clippers haven't done anything wrong by know that he wasn't signed yet and going hard to retain him.
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,FutureShock25,56,Tue Jul 7 14:02:04 2015 UTC,Pure class from DeMarre.

AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,LAXlittleant26,40,Tue Jul 7 19:09:02 2015 UTC,I was sad that he left. Now I'm sad I read this.
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,fuzzyllama1,40,Tue Jul 7 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"This is so incredible. DeMarre left a huge impression on me as a fan. His dedication, improvement, and style will never be forgotten. He really began competing with Al as my favorite Hawk. It's so sad he has to go, but I'm glad he'll make some bank and have a big role when he does.  And once his contract is up and the Hawks are looking for some vet presence on the wing, DeMarre will be my first choice to make a comeback."
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,thrashfan,8,Tue Jul 7 14:28:58 2015 UTC,"That would be nice. Who knows what he will be in four years but I imagine him being a great vet bench presence and 6-7th man. Wouldn't mind he, Al and Sap all retiring here when the time comes. Even if so we can all relive the 2014-15 season."
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,fuzzyllama1,2,Tue Jul 7 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"I have the same feeling. A little slower, but a great bench leader for the young bloods."

AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,kareemk,4,Tue Jul 7 14:41:16 2015 UTC,"Carroll is a great person, I'm sure, but he's not worth the 16mil as a player. And that's what some people forget. I'm happy that he gets a great pay day, but at the same time all teams are a business at the end of the day, and their number one priority is getting the best product at a certain price. So if you can't afford that one player, you get the next best one (or two) to make up for it/exceed it."
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,justcamp,6,Tue Jul 7 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"So if you can't afford that one player, you get the next best one (or two) to make up for it/exceed it.   We haven't done that yet.  DeMarre is definitely a 15mil player based on the market this year and his contract will be fine after the cap rises.  Ferry did a poor job managing the cap for this off-season and the fact that Sap and JYD bet on themselves and took 2 year contracts with us really hampered our ability to keep the team together.  I'm glad DeMarre got paid.  Too bad it wasn't by the Hawks."
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,kareemk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"Uh, ferry was suspended before the 14-15 season. And you don't manage a cap unless you rework contracts."

AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,schroders_cat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"Guys what is the plan for you SF spot now?   Additionaly, have any of you watched Heat games last year? Henry (formerly Bill) Walker didn't look great with us, probably because our spacing sucked and we had no PG to consistently feed him open looks, but he reminded me of poor mans DMC. He hustles hard, defends and is a knockdown shooter. I know it's not perfect, but I feel he is the kinda of player who would flourish in a great system such as yours or Spurs. Also, it doesn't look like Miami will resign him so you could get him for cheap, probably even vet. min. Thoughts?"
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,supergrega,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:25:02 2015 UTC,"Walker definitely wasn't in my top names for potential replacements, but the free agent depth at 3 is dwindling, and your description of his playing style is enticing -- especially at that price.  Hopefully we can pull the trigger on something at the 3 soon so that our sub's collective anxiety can go back down."
AtlantaHawks,3cfcz5,Adampro123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:03:13 2015 UTC,"You could head over to the Heat sub and ask for some suggestion on his games. The only one I can remember from the top of my head is his last game when he played full 48 min. He only played around 25 games because we got him late, but he hit 2 game winners. Also had to play some PF and even C because of our injuries and he held his ground against Drummond for a little while.  On the down side, he did have 2-12 games or 0-8 from three point games. He pumped faked for no reason a lot and then drove in the lane where he sometimes made a great pass but mostly just overdribble into traffic. His defense was inconsistent too, but dude really hustled.  Not saying he will replace DMC's production or that he is a starting calibre SF for a contender. He's not a franchise savior and won't be the best role player on a team. But as I've said, I think he can be a nice 3 and D contributor in the right system."

AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,GT2018,4,Wed Jul 8 18:55:13 2015 UTC,B+ if we're allowed to count trades as well. Would've loved to get DMC back but there was really no way that was possible. We've done just about everything we can afford to do to improve the team.
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,Boom_Angry,4,Wed Jul 8 06:20:04 2015 UTC,B. Got Millsap back which is great. Wish we could've gotten someone on the wing but not too bad overall.
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,Muff09,3,Wed Jul 8 05:17:11 2015 UTC,C. We got bigger and that's good but left a giant hole at SF position. Just don't trust Thabo and Bazemore to be starters..
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,C-Jammin,3,Wed Jul 8 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly confident in Thabo or Bazemore starting, but we didn't trust that DeMarre would be anything but some defense off the bench.  Both guys are the same type of player (3 and D, though not as consistent) that Carroll was.  I think both, especially Thabo, could provide above average defense and 10 points a game in a starting spot."
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,abesrevenge,2,Wed Jul 8 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"A-. Played out exactly how I was hoping. We now have a true center to see what Al can do in the 4. I like the upside of perhaps getting Portis instead of THJR, but that is my only complaint. The core of a 60 win team is still there."
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,trafewsan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"C+  However, that will more than likely change as a suspect there will be a trade of some sort after the League's signing moratorium is over."
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,draftdaydeion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:59:49 2015 UTC,"B- Resign Millsap back, but lost Carroll which leaves a gap at the small forward position. Hopefully we can develop Bazemore and Thabo comes back healthy so we can fill up that spot.  Addition of Tim Hardaway Jr. gives you instant scoring off the bench. Plus got a little bigger on the boards with splitter and calling up edy tavares (who is still very raw but has high upside)"

AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,furycutter80,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:52:44 2015 UTC,C - we got more flexibility with the frontcourt but I'm unsure how far that's going to take us. We need at least 1 wing defender we could develop alongside Thabo and we didn't get it. If Thabo goes down our defense takes a huge hit because he doesn't really have a good replacement and our whole team motto is defense (offense comes if you hustle on defense). I don't know what the FO's plan is to fix it but it's a pretty obvious hole that everyone has their fingers stuck in their ears about and it worries me.
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,draftdaydeion,3,Wed Jul 8 06:13:39 2015 UTC,"Believe the plan is to develop Bazemore into that wing defender. Very athletic and has great length with that wingspan. Always plays with high energy, but can be careless at times"
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,oballistikz,2,Wed Jul 8 14:54:33 2015 UTC,Idk if you feel there's a difference between the two but I feel that bazemore just overthinks a lot. I'd have to imagine at this point he gonna settle down. He gets the system now.
AtlantaHawks,3cik7x,draftdaydeion,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"He does overthink a lot. Maybe he's trying hard to prove himself, or could just be his inexperience. I agree with you, I think he will perform higher this year with a higher expected work load"

AtlantaHawks,3chq34,CDub22EP,15,Wed Jul 8 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"It's sad and all, but I gotta be the voice of reason.  I was literally the target audience for the Thrashers and they never interested me at all. I was far from alone. The Braves, Hawks, Falcons, and hell even the new MLS team have my interest, but Hockey just doesn't do it for me or a lot of the people in this area like it obviously does for people in Winnipeg.  Likewise apparently Basketball just isn't the thing in Milwaukee, so why not send them to Seattle, a city STARVING for Basketball?  I mean it's cold, but you can be a fan of a team out of state, it's about what's best for an area and team, not what's convenient for a minority of fans."
AtlantaHawks,3chq34,mehjbmeh,17,Wed Jul 8 00:35:08 2015 UTC,These are two very different situations. You're comparing a decade old franchise that sucked all but one year to one that's been around nearly 50 years with a championship.  I loved the Thrashers. I cried when they left. But these aren't at all similar.
AtlantaHawks,3chq34,thrashfan,3,Wed Jul 8 00:47:28 2015 UTC,and all this time i thought your name meant that you were a fan of the musical genre
AtlantaHawks,3chq34,atomsej,8,Wed Jul 8 03:37:54 2015 UTC,"I have to agree a bit. There are cities wanting a NBA franchise. It makes absolutely 0 sense to expand when there are teams in the brink of failing.   I get that a lot of Bucks fans want the team stay in Milwaukee, but it sounds like the residents don't want the team. It makes 0 sense for someone in Atlanta go and petition for something in Milwaukee that the residents there don't even want.   I've seen people go as far as asking others to call their local reps..don't do that...  Let the city tax payers decide how they want to spend their taxes..  It's a sticky situation all around, and while I hope Milwaukee keeps their team, it kind of seems like they might not have the fan base to actually support it. Really sad for Bucks fans, but I hope they keep their team and more people get interested."
AtlantaHawks,3chq34,jennys0,4,Wed Jul 8 01:29:06 2015 UTC,"Just because you weren't into it, doesn't mean the city wasn't. From 03-07 we had a better avg attendance than the Chicago Blackhawks, a city pretty famous for their love of hockey. Also within that time period, we were  typically higher in rank than at least 3-4 northern teams where hockey is king.   Sure we were never breaking records with attendance but we were never once at the bottom.  The destruction of the Thrashers was a combo of the Spirit Group and Don Waddell. The city didn't give up on the team, the owners openly spoke of wanting to get rid of the team they were forced to purchase when they wanted the Hawks."
AtlantaHawks,3chq34,beefsupreme,3,Wed Jul 8 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the Supersonics attendance pretty poor? Granted they had a fairly dismal decade from 98-08. I wouldn't say the city is ""starving"" for a basketball team. Sure there are a small amount of die-hard NBA fans, but you will find that in any city. The Seahawks attendance was also pretty poor until they started winning championships."
AtlantaHawks,3chq34,Bankingitbig,6,Wed Jul 8 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want someone to lose their team, but that seems more like a decision for the people of that city and state to make than for us. I just don't want the Hawks in Seattle."

AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,nerdyintentions,4,Tue Jul 7 03:09:06 2015 UTC,"A few teams in the East have clearly gotten better.  Bucks have gotten better (Monre plus Jabari back), Pacers have gotten better (assuming healthy PG), and Miami is better (with Chris Bosh back but that does sort of assume that Whiteside isn't a 1 season wonder).  We are kind of an X factor.  Lot of questions. We have no big changes or marquee players coming back from long injuries.  Its just a question of whether the system can work its magic on the new guys and what affect the new frontcourt depth will have.  I understand the pessimism though.  In general, you really have to give people a reason to be optimistic and our lackluster playoff performance (when compared to expectations set by the team's success during the season) combined with our so-so off-season has people skeptical."
AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,poerhouse,3,Mon Jul 6 22:57:06 2015 UTC,This is all fine by me.  I think Bud'd rather have us as underdogs anyway- it's easier to coach the hunger in when there's a lack of respect from the outside.
AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,ATLjoe93,2,Mon Jul 6 23:23:15 2015 UTC,I do believe we will regress (slightly) this year. I also believe that the Cavs are paper favorites in the EC atm. I do NOT believe there are 4 better teams in the EC than the Hawks. I am not drinking the Miami Heat kool-aid.

I mean I expect regression but, what? Is Atlanta going to have injury problems again like 2013-2014? I think losing 15 games off of the win total is possible but really pushing it, I’ve said 48-52 wins and the 2nd-4th seed.  I've had a feeling that the reality might have been both 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 were on the outlier side for the Hawks."

You could make an argument that a Schroeder, Hardaway, Baze, Muscala, Splitter starting 5 would be better than anything the bottom 10 teams will put on the floor this season. Teague's only going to keep getting better. Sef will hopefully be healthy all year, Sap and Horford  will be their All-Star selves. This team probably wont win 60 again but I think 55 is a very realistic expectation in the East."

AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,RaptureVeteran,-9,Tue Jul 7 06:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna rant just because im miserably bored right now  I actually have no issue with this. 8-10 range is more accurate but I have no problem with people cooling off on us. Its nice adding Splitter and all but we still have a huge hole @ the 3 spot, unless you think Thabo is suddenly going to become a reliable shooter now. Korver was significantly slower on defense in the playoffs. Mike Scott was hot garbage the last 2 or so months.  So yes, while I think we have a significantly better rotation @ the 4/5, there is a question mark with Dennis' off the bench, Teague doesnt give 100% all the time, hell he barely gives 90% 3/4s of the time (its the #1 reason i really dont care for the guy. He could be a top 5 PG in the league if he wanted but he plays lazy as shit too much and turns it on only when he feels it benefits the team in the final few minutes of the game far too often. him vs the nets is picture perfect proof of this. shit stat lines until 4-5 minutes in the game and then suddenly he finishes with a solid line. Where the fuck was that the entire game asshole?)  its not realistic to expect another near record shooting season from korver and hes coming off an ankle injury/surgery, we have no reliable starter @ the 3 and frankly, going back to the dennis thing, you can circle the entire bench in that 1-3 spot as a weakness/question mark thanks to how utterly awful they were the last 2 months of the year  the only way this team wins 50 games imo (which isnt popular here because its not full blown derpathon optimistic and homer filled garbage)   teague needs to play hard all the time the entire 4/5 rotation stay healthy, im convinced that moose shits shit that is of better quality than anything pero does in his life so its a monster upgrade by default that splitter and moose replace the garbage that was scott and pero off the bench find a fucking 3 that is not thabo or bazemore. while thabo is a A+ defender and over 80% of our top rated lineups on NBA.com feature Thabo in the lineup, and bazemore is a A+ hustle player, neither of them are remotely reliable as offensive weapons and neither of which should be playing more than 20 minutes a game (and in bazemores case hes far more useful to the team when hes playing closer to 15 because of how he uses his energy) The bench needs to improve across the board in the back court. Dennis needs to develop a god damn jump shot that will net him closer to 40% as a three point shooter, this might seem like a significant jump to some people but for me, in the NBA, guys usually see their biggest strides from year 2 to 3, Dennis has no excuse for this sub 30% three point garbage this year. None. Bazemore needs to develop a jump shot too. He was worse than Pero to me. He was the ""please pass please pass please pass"" guy. Scott needs to find his old confident self.  The team in general needs to get back on track. Essentially the team shit the bed post ASG and the ball movement that won us 19 games in a row shit the bed. A lot of iso. A lot of holding the ball for 7 seconds hoping someone would actually move their ass from the spot theyve been standing in. Just a lot of bad basketball.    Realistically I see this team as in the 44-50 win range. This could change depending on what happens with that 3 spot but frankly if we go into the season with thabo and bazemore splitting time @ the 3 i may end up being more pessimistic than i already am"
AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,broeho,8,Mon Jul 6 23:20:42 2015 UTC,"lmao you are the shittiest fan ever.  we just won 60 games and lost one player from that team. we made the eastern conference finals and lost to lebron. nothing but doom and gloom from you, all the time. how you manage to find nothing positive from last amazes me.  this is an actual quote from your post:   the only way this team wins 50 games imo (which isnt popular here because its not full blown derpathon optimistic and homer filled garbage)   FOH dude. yeah, we are the optimistic homers because we expect our win total to not go down roughly 20%   smdh"
AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,RaptureVeteran,-7,Tue Jul 7 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"You're a homer because you did literally nothing to argue my point other than get upset that I had an opinion that differs from you. You provided nothing. Like most homers in sports do. Its rah rah rah well we did so and so last year therefore we will do so and so this year.  solid god damn reasoning, you might be able to work for ESPN bringing all these hard facts and logic to the table bro"
AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,broeho,8,Tue Jul 7 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"You just LOVE being a martyr.  I could pick literally any team in the NBA and apply the same logic you just gave to say that they will win 40 games.  you pointed out a few negative things about our team, ignored all positives, and then made a shitty prediction.  overall, you just don't understand the big picture at all. you don't understand that other teams are not perfect, and that our team is pretty god damned good already. We have one of the strongest starting 5's in the NBA and you think that losing a mid-tier SF is gonna correlate to 10-15 more losses.  Dennis Schroder isn't Chris Paul, so you think we are gonna get 10-15 more losses.  If things were so bad, we would have won 40-50 games last year.    Korver was significantly slower on defense in the playoffs   82 game season, man. He proved to be an awesome player all year long. You picked out the one point in the season that he didn't play well and drew the conclusion that he is now just a bad player.   Mike Scott was hot garbage the last 2 or so months.   Mike Scott played 16 minutes per game. That is a fact. The fact that you are even citing him as a reason why we are gonna be mediocre next year is straight clownwork.   Teague doesnt give 100% all the time, hell he barely gives 90% 3/4s of the time   this isn't an analysis at all, just your bs opinion (the type of thing i'd expect to see on ESPN actually) like ""the hawks didn't win because they didn't WANT it bad enough"". zero substance to that point.    shit stat lines until 4-5 minutes in the game and then suddenly he finishes with a solid line. Where the fuck was that the entire game asshole?   It's called a small selection size. Guys get hot and cold. Guys don't make every shot. Guys turn the ball over sometimes. Do you think Teague is the only player in the NBA that plays bad for a quarter, then does well in the 4th quarter sometimes?  You are gonna get mad at teague because he doesn't play perfect 100% of the time?  By the way, whatever amount of effort teague gave last year was good enough for us to get 60 wins. There's no reason to expect him to get worse.   there is a question mark with Dennis' off the bench   Schroder is one of the best backup point guards in the NBA. he's also extremely young and shows massive potential. you remembered him having a few bad games and somehow you drew the conclusion that he is going to suck for 82 games and cause us to have a mediocre season. terrible logic. the fact that you point him out as a weak spot on our bench is laughable.   we have no reliable starter @ the 3   We also have 4 all-stars at the 4 other starting positions.   im convinced that moose shits shit that is of better quality than anything pero does in his life so its a monster upgrade by default that splitter and moose replace the garbage that was scott and pero off the bench   this sentence doesn't make any sense, but I think you are saying that our team is getting better  You picked a few minor weak points on our team, ignored everything good, assumed everyone would get worse, assumed nobody would get better, and ignored the fact that we were good last year with those same weak points. We got rid of our worst player in Pero.  We solved one of our biggest problems in signing Splitter.  Teague has shown significant improvement every year in the NBA.  Schroder improved massively and was an awesome spark for us last year and he should only get better.  Al Mother Fucking Horford is back again and should be healthy going into the beginning of the season (unlike last year).  Millsap was re-signed.  Our entire team gets another year to learn this badass system."
AtlantaHawks,3cchz9,RaptureVeteran,-5,Tue Jul 7 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"my issue with this team is they left a shit taste in my mouth  looked like garbage vs the nets, wasnt much prettier vs the wizards (actually id argue we were significantly worse but were incredibly fortune to escape this series at all). The team lost to a Cavs team that didnt have Love or Irving and had rather cringe worthy play (historically bad in the finals) from the role players. While Shump and Smith had some solid games vs us its still rather pathetic to me a team that prided themselves on defense got beaten up all over the place by basically just lebron james (hey bud? bud...yeah...bud...lets not cover lebron fucking james with a god damn 4, just for future reference, he might just easily blow by him and put the nail in the coffin because of a bad coaching decision)  i say garbage in comparison to a one seed who clinched the East with damn near a month left in the season. You dont struggle with a 8 seed, period. I hate the woulda, coulda game but just to be a cunt, the hawks are likely a paul pierce shot being let off a split second sooner from losing to the wizards and never making it to the ECF.   The entire bench played awful in the playoffs  Scott, Dennis, Pero, Bazemore (who at one point was, iirc, 0-20 from the 3 point line until he finally drained one).  I saw multiple writers on twitter either tweet or reply to me on twitter agreeing with me that Bud was out coached in EVERY single playoff series the team was in. And I love bud, but he was down right bad in the playoffs and maybe it was an uncomfortable position he was forced into because the korver injury and horford and millsap playing hurt for a majority of the playoffs.   I havent even gotten to the point that I never said I was mad at Teague for not playing perfect. No. Never said that, actually your reading comprehension is mostly pero antic bad throughout the entire reply (never said korver was bad either, but this post would be 8 paragraphs longer if i pointed out your incredible inability to read). I stated I was tired of how he seemed to approach the game (which seems to gel with various tweets from ""insiders"" ive seen who questioned his motivation levels throughout the playoffs).  I never expect perfection from an athlete, but i sure as fuck dont respect a guy who takes plays off and i always got the sense teague took plays off. hell, i recall 2 friends of mine at a watch party mentioning it out loud before i ever did, they were both upset over how he decides to turn it on and when he decides to do so. its fucking infuriating.   The team could be better, i dont doubt this at all, considering, as you said, that the team returns so much its not out of the question at all. but the taste they left in my mouth? shit. tastes like pure garbage. struggled vs the nets, struggled vs the wizards, 4 all stars lost to lebron james and a damn near historically bad supporting cast and bud looked like shit, thats all pretty fresh in my head (seriously, bud was so bad i didnt even get upset when redditors and people on twitter sarcastically said can the nba strip him of the coach of the year award and give it to kerr, he was truly that bad in the playoffs. I saw multiple media people say we might as well have had mike woodson coaching us, yup)  as i told a friend of mine, you want to get a more accurate, realistic and likely more optimistic read from me? Ask me a week before the season starts. Because right now? Lol. Not big on this team. Not after what they did in the playoffs. i think im being fair saying this team could hit 50 wins as it is right now and even that makes me uncomfortable as of today"

Good regular season, playoffs just dont show up. As a FAN you should hope for the best out of your team though. I cant really see the fan in you because you dont see any good in your team. Ive seen raiders fans say their team was going to win the championship after their (1-15?) season and you think ur team is losing 5-7 spots in the EC because of damare carrol? Seriously Damare CARROL? That is all we lost this season right? You dont think the team will grow at all? Like none of our starters are getting better? Its just really hard to believe youre really a fan when you clearly cant see any good in what the hawks bring to the table. If nothing you have COY and he clearly added something to the team because we werent making the ECF before him. Idk man... I just dont know."

AtlantaHawks,3ccnv8,Jus10Crummie,0,Tue Jul 7 03:06:55 2015 UTC,Guess we have different definitions of non-factor.  If you need the best players on the team that had the best record in the East to reproduce his production (and that is arguable considering Teague averaged more minutes per game with lower FG%) then that sounds like a factor to me.

I'm an eternal optimist- and while I see us having a record slightly off from last season (teams prepare better for us now and it'll take awhile to train the new dudes up to fill in for JYD adequately) I believe we'll still remain an Eastern Conference elite team. I don't expect as big of a leap as we had regular season last year, but I do expect us to play better in the playoffs. I do think we'll need to prove we're for real two years in a row to really allow our young'uns to break through (lookin' at you, Denis) and attract the big name or two we missed out on this offseason.  Honestly, I'm fine with us being solid contenders for a few years. The Spurs didn't start their dynasty by coming out of nowhere.

AtlantaHawks,3cax8g,datzevo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"I would say show up an hour before the game if you have never been. I don't exactly know how to describe its location, but there is a really good deck close to the arena right next to a chik-fil-a and before you hit the cfb hall of fame that does 10 dollar parking on game days (other places you will pay 20). Other than that, every time I go I wait to eat until after and go to hudson's grill right near the arena. Good food that's better priced than the arena and lets you wait out traffic. That's what we do anyways."
AtlantaHawks,3caqiw,Raydioactive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:02:49 2015 UTC,What are the chances of the Cavs getting rooted against like the Yankees this year? If they get Joe Johnson and with these other absurd contracts...I could see the Hawks picking up a lot of fans.   We're really the only team with the correct depth to challenge them I think.
AtlantaHawks,3caqiw,duhpolan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:07:38 2015 UTC,I had a dream that Tristan Thompson and Middleton signed with the hawks. And also we got Danny ferry back. Weird.
AtlantaHawks,3caqiw,Raydioactive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:26:52 2015 UTC,I had a dream about the hawks where we went on a 8 or 9 point run in about 12 seconds. With Tim Hardaway Jr. hitting the 3 that brought the house down. Philips was lit
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,Cleebot,4,Mon Jul 6 03:12:04 2015 UTC,Well the cap jump that's coming up helped. We got lucky we got Teague on a deal that is going to look like a steal compared to all the new ones.
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,bearg0d,2,Mon Jul 6 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"And to think, it was argued whether the Hawks made the right decision to match the Bucks offer sheet."
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,joannes3000,3,Mon Jul 6 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"Just wild how Reggie is making more than a top 3 point guard... that he was backing up for most of his career. He played well for the Pistons though.  Teague for 8 mil is a steal. He has his flaws, but I'd rather have him for 8 mil than some of these other contracts out there."
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,DBac7812,-6,Mon Jul 6 04:29:57 2015 UTC,Reggie Jackson isn't that far off from Teague bro. Check his stats post-trade.
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,JahlilOkaforGOAT,4,Mon Jul 6 03:31:34 2015 UTC,I think Detroit really boosts his stats though. He is basically option #1 over there on offense.

AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,JahlilOkaforGOAT,-1,Mon Jul 6 04:03:34 2015 UTC,you're saying reggie jackson is worth twice as much as teague? lol
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,JahlilOkaforGOAT,-4,Mon Jul 6 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"How in the hell did I say that? Quit trying to read between the lines. I am saying Reggie is almost as good of a player as Teague, and Teague is obviously on a good contract. Shitting on Reggie is just a Bitch thing to do"
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,JahlilOkaforGOAT,2,Mon Jul 6 04:03:21 2015 UTC,ok so is he worth 16 million?
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,ATL_GritzBlitz,-3,Mon Jul 6 04:13:00 2015 UTC,With the cap rising yes he is. He will soon be as good as Teague. I give it two years
AtlantaHawks,3c9fcj,thesilvaserger,4,Mon Jul 6 04:42:30 2015 UTC,Well Teague is technically still growing as a player too.

AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,poerhouse,8,Mon Jul 6 04:12:49 2015 UTC,Idk if he's the right type of player for our team but it sure would be fun to have SwaggyP represent Atlanta
AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,chessbrah,6,Mon Jul 6 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"this is the biggest question for me.   Young seems like a chill enough dude, but I dunno if he's got the discipline in him, but that said, if he comes in and does buy in I think he could be as good for the system as the system would be for him.  Just promise me that if he does end up here we're all burying that ""swaggy P"" nonsense."
AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,JM4G1C,2,Mon Jul 6 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I mean, seems like a cool enough dude, and would probably be quite the unofficial spokesman for the team... as for his on court play, I submit this... exactly what we don't need around here."
AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,Crcsoccer1,2,Mon Jul 6 10:28:49 2015 UTC,"Young balled out a year ago, but kinda sucked last year. But maybe could be a cheaper SF option with upside?"
AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,killjoyous,4,Mon Jul 6 03:06:48 2015 UTC,"Man just imagining a small ball bench lineup of:  Schroeder, Kent, THJ, Swaggy, Mike Scott or Moose.  Would be GREATNESS."
AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,Crcsoccer1,4,Mon Jul 6 03:34:43 2015 UTC,It would also be the worst defensive lineup in the NBA haha
AtlantaHawks,3c9eoc,T64dw4n,2,Mon Jul 6 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"Swaggy is making 5 million a year, would be a steal if he could quit making dumb plays and went back to balling first"
AtlantaHawks,3c8tav,Martinsek,6,Sun Jul 5 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"The Hawks did him wrong. It's a real shame.   I can't remember, did Danny sign Baze and Thabo or was that after?"
AtlantaHawks,3c8tav,thrashfan,2,Mon Jul 6 01:34:25 2015 UTC,Danny traded for Thabo on 7/15/14. Basketball Reference says his last day with the Hawks was 9/12/14. Then Bazemore was signed on 9/23/14.
AtlantaHawks,3c8tav,rjdab,5,Mon Jul 6 02:15:37 2015 UTC,I miss you bae.
AtlantaHawks,3c8tav,mehjbmeh,2,Mon Jul 6 00:01:28 2015 UTC,As fucked up as this firing was... New ownership didn't have a choice.  The over sensitive people in this country always wins.  And corporations easily bend when it comes to public controversy like this.  It what it is.  He'll get a new GM job... Wouldn't be surprised he puts together another great team.  Hopefully in the west.  Because if its in the east and his team beats us in the playoffs I'm going to lose my shit.
AtlantaHawks,3c8tav,CLEANSH0T,2,Mon Jul 6 08:25:51 2015 UTC,I hope at some point Ferry gives insider perspective on the bickering factions in the Atlanta Spirit and how they (dis)functioned as a group.

AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,FutureShock25,10,Mon Jul 6 01:59:06 2015 UTC,Yeah as much as I love Demarre Millsap was a 2 time all star and our leading scorer. We made the right choice.
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,bearg0d,8,Mon Jul 6 02:52:35 2015 UTC,Yup. Sounds about right to me.
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,poerhouse,3,Mon Jul 6 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"that article is talking a bit of shit, i feel like we are going to be a better team this year."
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,AlconTheFalcon,2,Mon Jul 6 02:59:48 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling Carroll is going to talk more shit later on.  I can see him becoming hated around here.  He's already slipped in a few jabs so far, and when things don't work out in Canada, I could see him frustratingly start talking even more shit.  I know he's everyones favorite former Hawk but I wish nothing but BUST for his future up north.  It only means we were right, and he ain't shit.  And I want the Hawks to be right."
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,CLEANSH0T,2,Mon Jul 6 08:36:19 2015 UTC,Smart choice picking Paul. Its gonna be funny when the salary cap explodes and guys like Schroeder want 20 million a year. Hopefully next year we can re-sign Al and have some space for when it does.
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand the reason for keeping Paul over DeMarre. Paul has been a consistently good player his entire career, whereas DeMarre was exceptional last year, but it was an anomaly.   Paul was definitely less of a risk. I do hope demarre keeps up his high level of play though. He definitely deserved the payday and deserves to be a star."
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,SteamandDream,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:49:33 2015 UTC,It's true. We didnt have Bird Rights for either one so we could not exceed the cap to re-sign them
AtlantaHawks,3c97m8,T64dw4n,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:18:55 2015 UTC,Now i feel bad about  being mad at Demarre
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,mehjbmeh,8,Sun Jul 5 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"there's no practical way, we are over the cap so we basically have to give up ~$25m worth of players to acquire him in a trade"
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,Decatur_Psalm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we are not going to be under the cap this year. New ownership just admitted they will gladly spend the luxury tax for this year."

AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,kareemk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:25:52 2015 UTC,There is ~10 million dollar gap.
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,BeautifulMohammad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:34:20 2015 UTC,"So if a team is 4 million over the cap, there's no luxury tax?"
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,kareemk,2,Tue Jul 7 13:34:21 2015 UTC,Exactly.
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,BeautifulMohammad,0,Tue Jul 7 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"right. I know we're over the cap and will pay lux tax, but could a trade for him allow ATL to spend over the cap or would we have to fit him in the cap space to make the trade?"
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,Decatur_Psalm,2,Sun Jul 5 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"it doesnt have anything to do with us paying luxury tax, that's a separate line from the salary cap line.   the general rule in a trade is that outgoing contract salary has to match incoming.   so if we cough up 25 mil worth of our players like millsap and thabo (just an example), then yes, we could make the trade, and roughly speaking our team payroll would be about where it is now.   the thing is that we dont have enough contract dead weight to make trading for joe johnson a viable move. the players we'd have to move are too valuable for us.   there are a few exceptions, one that comes up during the offseason is if a team is under the cap, then you can absorb the salary up to the cap line, and then you only have to match the remaining. so if our team was $15m below the cap, then we'd only have to offer $10m in a trade to get joe johnson back.   for the splitter trade we were far enough under the cap that we didnt have to give up any salary to acquire him."
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,drsmith21,2,Sun Jul 5 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"Not quite; salaries have to 'match' if the trade puts you over the cap. You can't combine cap room with a trade exception. The incoming salary must be within 150% (+$100k) of the outgoing salary. If we trade a $6M player, we can get a $9.1M player back.   A team is always free to absorb a player if it doesn't put them over the cap, but they have to send something in return, usually a protected 2nd round pick. It's not limited to the off-season. Philly has absorbed several players during the last few seasons."
AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,nerdyintentions,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:19:57 2015 UTC,How is Cleveland going to pull it off?  Sign and trade Hayward but that is only 10 million right? And if I'm understanding your post that means that they can absorb up to 15 million dollars in incoming salary.  How do they make up the other $10 million?  Do they have to let JR walk to make it happen?

AtlantaHawks,3c8kj8,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"ah. Thanks that makes sense.  So the Cavs lux tax spending spree has far more to do with resigning their own without using ""cap space"" per se, than exceptions to be able to acquire more weight?"

Let's be honest, the majority of hate for Johnson is all about him being ""iso joe"" and sticking the team in the NBA purgatory of one and done playoff runs, if he's a role player instead of the focus I think he'd be welcomed back."

The green needs to stay as an accent color. I'm cool with the baseline and sidelines to have the green trim but not the whole out of bounds area  Edit: a word
AtlantaHawks,3c6h3e,JM4G1C,3,Sun Jul 5 08:13:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, no volt green hawk... and the volt green needs to be used sparingly at best. I'm all for the blacked-out sidelines."

AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,killjoyous,12,Sat Jul 4 17:12:03 2015 UTC,yes. this has DeMarre 2.0 written all over it.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,jamesbradb,11,Sat Jul 4 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"not as in player type, but as in someone who hasn't reached their potential coming here to blossom."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,jamesbradb,7,Sat Jul 4 17:19:15 2015 UTC,Here's the NBA.com player comparison of Demarre vs. Johnson.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,Persuasive_Penguin,7,Sat Jul 4 18:11:16 2015 UTC,and lets keep in mind that Carroll played in a much better team and got so many good/open looks. That helps the stats for sure.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,Muff09,3,Sat Jul 4 18:18:09 2015 UTC,Very similar smiles.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,GT2018,4,Sun Jul 5 21:25:19 2015 UTC,he would be a good pick up
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,SteamandDream,4,Sat Jul 4 18:00:29 2015 UTC,http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2355246-in-wake-of-lost-stars-lakers-stuck-with-roster-full-of-unrealized-potential  http://www.silverscreenandroll.com/2015/5/13/8590297/la-lakers-wesley-johnson-free-agency-season-review  Only recent write ups I could find about him.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,BeautifulMohammad,11,Sat Jul 4 19:07:55 2015 UTC,His middle name is Jamarr.  almost rhymes with demarre.....not sure why i find that relevant.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,jatl,3,Sat Jul 4 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"Dammit, My first thought was Wesley Matthews. WJ is a good, versatile player though."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,ATLjoe93,2,Sat Jul 4 22:14:28 2015 UTC,Matthews already signed with the Mavs.  We couldn't afford him anyway and its a high risk/high reward type of signing considering his injury.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,nerdyintentions,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:39:12 2015 UTC,Same! Almost shit my pants in confusion. This would still be a nice pickup too though.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,playalisticadillac,2,Sun Jul 5 00:02:21 2015 UTC,Would be a great fit. He was pretty good offensively on a horrible Lakers team. With our offense he could improve a lot. I think he would excel highly in this system.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,Crcsoccer1,2,Sat Jul 4 20:32:51 2015 UTC,I always liked his game in LA. Thought he was a really smart and reliable player on a really bad team. He has much more potential than what he was able to show in LA.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,chessbrah,2,Sat Jul 4 22:27:10 2015 UTC,Hopefully he sees what the Hawks organization did for Carroll and signs with us even if its a couple of years rental in hopes of a big payday.    If the Hawks can be the sort of organization that turns water into wine then we'll be contenders for years to come even without big FA signings.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,nerdyintentions,3,Sun Jul 5 05:44:27 2015 UTC,PLEASE  If we nab Johnson I think we legit are a better team than the Cavs.
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,mehjbmeh,23,Sat Jul 4 20:25:34 2015 UTC,Bruh Wesley Johnson is not the piece that makes us better than the Cavs...
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,killjoyous,10,Sat Jul 4 20:54:47 2015 UTC,I agree with you a lot on the Falcons sub but you say the craziest shit here.. Can't hate the optimism tho
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,alcoholsuperhero,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:00:12 2015 UTC,"It's only crazy because i'm saying it puts us over LeBron. But hell, you can't just kneel down and expect him to win. He's far from invincible and last year the pieces around him were lights out that series while our open shots just didn't fall.  I honestly think ATL's biggest needs were size and experience. We're building on both."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,mehjbmeh,3,Sun Jul 5 01:16:31 2015 UTC,"He's not invincible, but he's not far from it. He's a living legend, he's made 5 straight finals and is likely to make another this year. I think we've improved and I don't think we'd be bulldozed in another matchup, but adding Splitter, THJ and potentially Wes Johnson and subtracting Demarre isn't going to make us better than the team that swept us with two all-stars in Kyrie and Love injured."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,alcoholsuperhero,2,Sun Jul 5 07:20:34 2015 UTC,"That's ignoring that Teague ate Kyrie alive every time they met and that Delly, dirty player or not, put the whole team on tilt and off their game (hell he arguably caused the sweep by causing a Korver injury and Horford's ejection) and Love only looked like his former All Star self in four games total.  The Cavs came in hot and Atlanta was in a cold streak was far more telling on that series than anything else."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,mehjbmeh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"Sure Teague had the edge in the regular season, but that doesn't negate the fact that Kyrie makes the Cavs a much fucking better team. Love didn't look as good as he has in previous years, but that's due to being a third option, not because of any regression - he's still most definitely a top power forward. The spacing he brings to the floor makes the Cavs, again, makes the Cavs a much fucking better team."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,alcoholsuperhero,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:42:09 2015 UTC,What is the Falcons sub? I've looked at AtlantaFalcons before and it's a ghost town
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,usmseawright,4,Sun Jul 5 09:18:39 2015 UTC,"You need /r/falcons, not /r/atlantafalcons. First one is the active one."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,Steffnov,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:48:35 2015 UTC,"I think it would've been an interesting series with both teams healthy, but I still think we would've been beat.  I think we would been down 3-1 in that series regardless.  I'm not sure Welsey Johnson would change that, but hopefully we'll get another crack at them in 2016 and see what happens."
AtlantaHawks,3c49ja,C-Jammin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:56:49 2015 UTC,idk i'm not a fan of this move
AtlantaHawks,3c5jp5,CDub22EP,8,Sun Jul 5 00:30:12 2015 UTC,"Orlando is small (like 6/8 teams tops) and earlier than LV. We used to go to Orlando and one year we did both iirc, but Vegas has more teams and more games. Summer league is as much about looking at players on your SL team as scouting players on other teams. Plus it gives you a little more time to finalize your roster."
AtlantaHawks,3c5jp5,drsmith21,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:54:10 2015 UTC,Also Las Vegas summer league works as sort of an informal meeting of all the league's execs and coaches. When else are they all going to be in one place? It's sort of the NBA's version of the winter meetings.
AtlantaHawks,3c5jp5,tocohills,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much what Dr. Smith said. Even though I'm confident each team has scouts at both.
AtlantaHawks,3c3lrx,datzevo,6,Sat Jul 4 13:02:23 2015 UTC,Is there any update on us and Wesley Johnson?
AtlantaHawks,3c3lrx,Tyronne_Lannister,4,Sat Jul 4 19:29:36 2015 UTC,LMA to the Spurs. Spurs/Hawks finals?
AtlantaHawks,3c3lrx,mehjbmeh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:02:09 2015 UTC,part of me would love this because the Spurs are an awesome team with an awesome fanbase.  part of me would hate this because there's no way anyone can beat this Spurs team.

Stopped in the middle of a green intersection and beeped at us, rolled down his windows and yelled Hello. It was fucking Dennis. Didn't even offer to drive us to Phillips. What an ignorant asshole."

AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,Orgcore,3,Fri Jul 3 17:01:27 2015 UTC,When was this relative to tipoff? I always thought players got there well before any fans showed up. Like 5 hours before tipoff.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,GT2018,2,Sun Jul 5 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"2 hours. This day he was on the bench, but we've seen him on centennial a few times around 2 hours before tip off when he was playing"
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,GussyH,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:30:48 2015 UTC,I think they go home or out after morning shoot around. I've been told by people that park at the Credit Union deck (neat player parking)  that the guys arrive just a couple hours before tip.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,Poopship_Destroyer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:11:00 2015 UTC,He drives through campus FYI. I biked behind him and got ahead of him and waved on Techwood by Perry/Matheson/Field literally a game prior to /u/LemonStealer's story. It was around 5:00 (for a 7:30 tip).
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,killjoyous,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:58:52 2015 UTC,I need to watch for him then
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,GT2018,16,Sat Jul 4 14:13:32 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of Schroeder. He's a competitor and one of the most improved players last season IMO. I love this fire.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,GT2018,3,Sat Jul 4 14:20:52 2015 UTC,His hair's cool too.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,jknox94,12,Fri Jul 3 13:13:53 2015 UTC,I hope his shoot will be more concistent next season. i think thats probably his biggest weakness imo. Do you see him starting over teague sometimes next season?
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,hogie276,7,Fri Jul 3 16:35:26 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the only way that would happen is if he improved his scoring consistency and shooting.  Even then it's hard to imagine benching the guy that was an all-star last year, maybe we'll see more of the two PG lineup"
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,koorob,5,Fri Jul 3 15:04:57 2015 UTC,I fucking love that two PG lineup. Almost no team has 2 guys quick enough to guard one of our PGs
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,khalorei,11,Fri Jul 3 15:29:15 2015 UTC,Your English in this post is pretty much perfect.   Anyway we love him. He makes some mistakes sometimes but that comes with being a young player. He's got a very bright future in this league

AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,RonFucknSwanson,4,Fri Jul 3 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"I saw Dennis at Lenox Mall during the playoffs, but it was a very strange situation. I was going up the escalator and he was going down, all I said was ""What's up Dennis, good luck with the game"" and he gave me a nod and said ""Thanks"". I contemplated going back down the escalator and taking a picture, but at that point they were already half way through the beast of a line at the Starbucks, and I didn't want to draw attention to him, especially since he was with who I assume to be his girlfriend.  Seemed like a cool dude though."

AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,kraken-on-standby,2,Sat Jul 4 06:27:10 2015 UTC,Love him! His Instagram banter with Jerome Boateng had me all giddy since I'm a bit of a football geek as well.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,wildhairguy,2,Fri Jul 3 13:19:44 2015 UTC,Love everything about him. Especially his attitude.  He's gonna be a Hawk for life if the ownership and FO care about winning.

AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,bosoxlover12,2,Fri Jul 3 15:00:21 2015 UTC,I think he'll be star PG in a few years. Right now I love what he brings us off the bench. Love Schroder!
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,silentkatana,2,Fri Jul 3 17:11:31 2015 UTC,I love him. Doesn't seem to take basketball too seriously and isn't fazed by going up against star point guards. His swag is contagious.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,WhosYourPapa,2,Fri Jul 3 17:29:58 2015 UTC,Good player that has the potential to get much better. Hope he stays in Atlanta and becomes Super-Mecha German Chocolate and breaks every ankle in the Eastern Conference (except Korvers). Love the gold nugget in his hair too.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,uckTheSaints,2,Fri Jul 3 18:04:55 2015 UTC,"Another note on Dennis, I think he is going to thrive with such a strong PnR center in Splitter."
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,Big21worm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"Love him. His improvement has been awesome to watch. He is amazingly quick, and it seems like he is developing a great 3 pointer. I think of him as a Rondo type that can play lock down D but he can actually shoot"
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,Matt2486,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a Celtics  fan, but I really like Schröder. Super quick, very good finisher, and if he gets a good jump shot he'll be a stud in the league.  I'm waiting for the new Hawks jerseys to go on AliEx, so I can get the one in my flair."
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,Rudelbildung,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:10:32 2015 UTC,I think he has a chance to be great. If he keeps improving at the rate he's going he'll be one of the top pgs in the league.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,Rudelbildung,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:40:35 2015 UTC,Dennis lives in my neighborhood and I met him a couple times. He's the coolest. I speak German so I got to talk about his time in Braunschweig a bit. It's clear that he loves the game and the Hawks. I hope he becomes a career guy in Atlanta because I think he has a great future in the league.
AtlantaHawks,3bzfyq,HighBitual2-2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"He's very well liked down here, however I don't think he's well liked in the national eye due to punching Boogie Cousins in the dick and playing some pretty bad hero ball in the playoffs this year. However most people would agree he has a very bright future."

AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,goamateur,11,Fri Jul 3 10:21:45 2015 UTC,"Is gladly take Wesley Johnson from that list. He's still very young and I believe he could perform well in a team ball setting unlike in LA, where its all about Kobe."
AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,USAFHART,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I feel like we need some playoff experienced veterans this time around. We all saw how we fell apart in the playoffs, maybe a calm and collected leader would be best."
AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,duhpolan,10,Fri Jul 3 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if more playoff experience is really what we need. Teague, Horford, Korver, Sefalosha, and Splitter are all playoff tested veterans. I know we fell apart last year but I think that was a lot more tied to the long season, tired legs, and complete lack of rebounding that doomed us."
AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,jperez3209,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"Playoff experience? You realize the Hawks have the longest streak in the NBA for consecutive playoff appearances. We just run into Lebron James and never have an answer for him. Something tells me that if Lebron wasn't in Cleveland, we would have faced Chicago in the ECF and would have won rather easily."
AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,USAFHART,2,Sat Jul 4 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"u didnt just run into lebron. u went from transfixing play calls and suffocating D to  free form rookies who then had to scramble on D.

AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,Muff09,0,Tue Jul 7 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"why is everyone hating on mike scott so much? and what's up with wing help? we got thabo, baze, and korver that can and will rotate through the 2 and 3 positions.. with the solid bigs coming in and moose's emergence, slide mike scott to the reserve 3. he's can shoot and always seems to get to the right place at the right time on offense. Might have a slight weakness defensively but he can and will rebound."
AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,hogie276,2,Fri Jul 3 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"Scott is a turnstile on defense and an incredibly streaky shooter. We all like him, but he was benched in the playoffs for a reason. As for our current wings, they're all too small to guard the bigger 3s in the league. Thabo's the only one who really has a shot. So we need a big 3 who can play defense and possibly develop a 3 point shot."
AtlantaHawks,3bz92a,cosmo_bear,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"The only reason I would keep Scott is because he's the only guy on our team who can do 'poster' dunks, and get the crowd and team hyped up"

AtlantaHawks,3bxobn,Eggman87,5,Fri Jul 3 00:31:01 2015 UTC,Congrats to him! I'm pumped to see how he develops with the Hawks!
AtlantaHawks,3bxobn,besaid_jim,4,Fri Jul 3 01:20:13 2015 UTC,If he turns out to be something good...oh man. That length. That wingspan. That semi-decent ~73% FT percentage that will hopefully go up because he's only played basketball for like 6 years...welcome to Atlanta

AtlantaHawks,3bzmcs,killjoyous,2,Fri Jul 3 13:28:57 2015 UTC,I feel like if we'd drop anyone it'd be Austin Daye or we'd try to move Mike Scott somewhere.  Mack is a solid backup PG and a good guy to have on the bench in case of injuries.

AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,justcamp,3,Thu Jul 2 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, maybe... or maybe not.  I think it's definitely too early to tell.  Did anyone anticipate Schroder becoming our sixth man and averaging double figures last year?"
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,broeho,9,Thu Jul 2 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you want evidence of my point, look at Schroeder's first year. Also, there's Muscala's and Payne's rookie seasons. Edy will bounce between D League, bench, and garbage minutes unless someone gets injured. He is raw and Buds previous treatment of rooks is pretty telling as to what we should expect."
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,justcamp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"That's not really evidence of anything except that schroder wasn't good as a rookie.  Every player is different....  and you may very well be right about him... He probably will get very limited minutes.    But I'm just saying I wouldn't say anything definitively about him because it is currently July.  We haven't seen him in camp at all and unless you are... like... some Euro-league scout, I'm gonna go ahead and say that you have only seen limited youtube highlights of him.  Maybe he's even better than you think!  Maybe he'll get better over the summer! The possibilities are endless!"
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,broeho,2,Thu Jul 2 19:30:18 2015 UTC,the problem is that he's been playing for only 5 years  that's just not enough time skill-wise unless the dude ends up being michael jordan.

AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,T64dw4n,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:22 2015 UTC,didn't even think of that. God I hope not
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,cwolfe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"There is no chance.  Spurs still need to make a move to have enough to sign aldridge to the max.  Also, the Spurs would be negotiating with him not the Hawks."

AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,thrashfan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:48:17 2015 UTC,http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q95  Hopefully this 30 day rule applies in this situation and he can't be involved in the trade which is supposed to officially take place on the 9th I believe.  Edit: Or maybe you can sign and trade rookies? I don't know.

AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,T64dw4n,3,Thu Jul 2 20:18:17 2015 UTC,Wasn't there just a report here a day or two ago saying he wasn't interested in coming over?
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,poerhouse,10,Thu Jul 2 15:49:48 2015 UTC,Money can change a man's perspective.
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,jbtrackxc,2,Thu Jul 2 15:53:29 2015 UTC,I guess so- don't get me wrong... bring on the twin CAWers!!!
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,poerhouse,6,Thu Jul 2 17:16:51 2015 UTC,I suspect that was just leverage to get a multi-year deal.
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,trafewsan,2,Thu Jul 2 16:00:40 2015 UTC,he may have been worried he would be coming over to sit on the bench...these moves this week could have given the hawks something to promise him out of a move here
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,T64dw4n,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:26:10 2015 UTC,We are going to be huge this year. But this might mean Splitter is just a trade chip.
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Mrchickfila,5,Thu Jul 2 15:28:18 2015 UTC,Nah I think we keep Splitter. He's good and generally knows our system and Bud. Tavares got a multi year deal. We are likely bringing him over to start developing him like we did Moose
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Raydioactive,8,Thu Jul 2 15:37:10 2015 UTC,What does this mean for Muscala then?
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Drummerboy93,2,Thu Jul 2 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think the better question is what does it mean for Mike Scott. Splitter, Moose, and Horford all have the ability to play the 4 or 5. Edy will need time to develop and probably play the Elton Brand role."
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,cosmo_bear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:55:27 2015 UTC,Perfectly put. I think Scott and Mack are gone. I will miss young 3moji
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Raydioactive,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:58:20 2015 UTC,Why not both? ;)
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Tyronne_Lannister,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Muscala is better suited as a PF. He showed some extended rang last year and a workable mid range and post game. My guess will be roughly the same minutes as last year for Al and Paul, Splitter getting the majority of Pero's minutes (likely a few more), and Moose filling in for PF where we used to have Mike Scott. I also think Scott is gone along with Mack to make the cap mechanics work."
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Raydioactive,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:01 2015 UTC,Also curious about this. It seems as though they'd want to put more work into Tavares over Muscala
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,Davidclabarr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:07:59 2015 UTC,Moose is playing summer league. I think that means we plan to keep him over Scott. Muscala is the better defender of the two.
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,tocohills,3,Fri Jul 3 05:54:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Brand and Pero out, Splitter and Tavares in. Everything else should look pretty similar. Still haven't figured out what we are doing at SF...start Shrekolosha? Move Millswamp to the 3 and start Donkeiago at 5 with Hogreford at 4?"

AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,HansSven,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:24:44 2015 UTC,He's still very raw.  Other than garbage put backs he has NO offensive game.  He can't shoot has no touch and no post game at all.  Watch the video posted earlier.   He can rebound and play OK defensively.   He's coming in to get experience and coaching and probably make a few trips down to the D league during the season.  I doubt it's someone they have any significant plans to use this season.  Hopefully he can improve quickly and be somewhat useful at some point.
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,JustHitTheBall,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:51:58 2015 UTC,Tavarres isn't close to ready to play heavy minutes.  He likely won't play much.

AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,twsmith89,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:05:12 2015 UTC,You don't have to have players under contract to invite them to Summer League. We did that with him last year. I'm sure his agent was using that as a leverage tactic in contract negotiations with the Hawks.
AtlantaHawks,3bvqqr,jperez3209,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"Changed his mind. Apparently Fenerbahce offered him double what the Hawks did, but Tavares wanted to play in the NBA. He'll be in Vegas with Moose and Patterson."

AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,T64dw4n,2,Thu Jul 2 20:23:49 2015 UTC,The reaction by the ESPN guys was awesome when the hawks drafted Edy. Cant wait to see how he develops https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0HKqhraeak
AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,theycallmebp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"So i imagine hes the 5th big, playing behind Moose. Probably doesnt really get much PT barring an injury or us getting lucky and closing out the division early again. Moose and Splitter off the bench, Scott and Tavares  as the third line for the 4/5 spot respectively. He'll be good for coming in and giving hustle minutes where we can also afford the obvious foul problems he has.   This signing looks more like they want to get him in Atlanta and working with NBA coaches, get him in a NBA weight room around NBA trainers to prepare him to takeover for when Millsap is gone (and even then they may never have the intention of starting him, they may just want to develop him and trade him since im not sure he'll ever develop a mid range jumper which kind of kills what Bud wants out of his bigs). Absolutely dont see him doing much of anything this year. Hes way too raw and ive read so so so much about how he is so undisciplined with his fouls that in the nba he would foul out in like 20 minutes or something like that. Most NBA bigs would eat this kid for breakfast in the post, the first thing that stuck out to me was how much success super undersized 4s and 5s were having against him in regards to moving him down under the basket, they just have no post moves over seas and he can recover by just jumping and swatting. in the nba this kid is a major liability on defense from day one regardless of his height/length."
AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,RaptureVeteran,5,Thu Jul 2 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, I only really see him playing this year if we're up by like 30. He does have a nice upside, though. Obviously he's huge, and seems to have pretty good mobility for his size. He could potentially develop into a good rotation big, but for now he looks like he'll be a penalty machine that can't keep up with the faster pace of the NBA."
AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,T64dw4n,4,Thu Jul 2 20:03:51 2015 UTC,Filled out quite nicely compared to that video
AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,lefthandpisces,3,Thu Jul 2 20:27:30 2015 UTC,holy shit
AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,NeonSubtlety,-2,Fri Jul 3 02:04:13 2015 UTC,I think we can quit comparing him to gobert.  He's big.  But he's a plodding mother fucker.  Definitely generally athletic.  And I'm really impressed with his lateral movement.  But this kid takes a long time to change gears and can't get much more than a foot and a half off the ground.  I think we pray he turns into Roy hibbert.  But there's real risk he's hamed haddadi.
AtlantaHawks,3bw9g0,T64dw4n,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:13:43 2015 UTC,not really...hamed haddadi never got drafted and he applied for the draft 6 years into his professional career...he was just a terrible player. NBA analytics and scouting have improved tremendously since Hamed was a rookie 10 years ago. Player development is much more important these days. He has potential to be like Roy Hibbert but not he will be used appropriately unlike Roy Hibbert (in later years)

AtlantaHawks,3c0m28,mehjbmeh,8,Sat Jul 4 02:29:04 2015 UTC,Actually passing and defense are two of JSmoove's strengths.  It's his shot selection and ability to stretch the floor that wouldn't work for us.
AtlantaHawks,3c0m28,killjoyous,3,Sat Jul 4 05:26:26 2015 UTC,We are pretty set at the 4 and Josh Smith did not work out at all at the 3 for us.

AtlantaHawks,3c0m28,DatWerkk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"We now have Splitter and Tavares backing up Horford allowing him to play more at the 4 along with Mllsap, so yes we are fine."

I guess I'm just not as sure as you that that's how our rotations are going to work. Unless Millsap is suddenly going to start playing many more minutes at the 3, I can't imagine Horford spending all that much time at the 4."
AtlantaHawks,3c0m28,DatWerkk,5,Sat Jul 4 18:03:26 2015 UTC,Smith would never sign here and the fans would never accept him.

AtlantaHawks,3c0m28,alcoholsuperhero,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:12:07 2015 UTC,I like Josh Smith and think he's a very good talented player. I still don't think he would fit our system. We need a 3 that can effectively shoot the three in order to space the floor. With Josh Smith the defenders would play off him and crowd the inside making our bigs less effective.

AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,Raydioactive,4,Thu Jul 2 15:19:00 2015 UTC,Is it just me or are the NBAs contract/trade/cba rules way more complicated than other sports?
AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,VusterJones,4,Thu Jul 2 16:52:42 2015 UTC,It's very complicated. I don't like baseball though and haven't taken the time to learn about the NFL cap rules and such so I really can't say. The NBA does seem to have an insane number of work-arounds though
AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,8,Thu Jul 2 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"Well MLB has no cap and no max contracts, their's is very straight forward."

AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,justcamp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:14:25 2015 UTC,I literally have no idea
AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,w_a_w,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:02 2015 UTC,They do have arbitration though.
AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,theShah12,4,Thu Jul 2 19:02:11 2015 UTC,TL;DR THANKS FERRY
AtlantaHawks,3bvpsj,T64dw4n,4,Thu Jul 2 16:59:47 2015 UTC,New owner already said he was going to go over the cap. It's a non-issue at this point.
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,IJustDontGetSarcasm,15,Thu Jul 2 14:59:01 2015 UTC,"He might have sucked last year, but you can't watch that and say there's no talent. Let's all remember Carroll was struggling just to make it in the league, and now he's making $15 mill/year. In Bud's development techniques we trust."
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,cosmo_bear,4,Thu Jul 2 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I think we should at least give him a chance before we dismiss the trade (like a lot of fans are doing already).  He was playing for a shit team with a shit organization/FO and a shit coach within a shit system.  He was literally up to his knees in shit and we're upset that he didn't flourish?  He's coming to a better situation where he won't shoulder as much responsibility/burden on a team that isn't trying to lose with a good system that has a record of getting the most out of players.  I say let's give him a chance.  He has the talent to plug a serious hole for us that was exposed in the playoffs.  IMO, THJ working out is just as important as the frontcourt depth that we have acquired.  If we can make it all work, we'll be title contenders again with a better chance of making it to the finals."
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,nerdyintentions,4,Thu Jul 2 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"That was fun to watch, I like the move. In bud we trust"
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,Dizzydsmith,4,Thu Jul 2 15:39:27 2015 UTC,I am a Kicks fan Tim is gonna be a bad man in this league Fish buried him in the rotation and killed his confidence when he should have been given a very long leash in a tank season.  Perfect landing spot for him really gonna be a hell of a shooter for you guys and hes also pretty athletic.
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,Gettingbuckets,4,Sun Jul 5 02:00:13 2015 UTC,Him and millsap will be a nice one two punch
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,fbrooks,3,Thu Jul 2 15:47:59 2015 UTC,great offense...defense looked pretty suspect
AtlantaHawks,3bvn59,TaTaToothey,3,Thu Jul 2 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Even though his defense isn't his strength, this the All-Star rookie game. The score is 120-120 in the second quarter. So don't put much  thought into this video. I also believe that his defense will be better in Atlanta where he isn't playing for a shit team and will have the drive to be great on both ends of the floor, because that is what Bud demands."
AtlantaHawks,3bw9o0,hrtattx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:51:27 2015 UTC,didn't realize Mike Scott cost that much
AtlantaHawks,3bw9o0,T64dw4n,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:08:11 2015 UTC,Horford's getting paid next year.
AtlantaHawks,3bw9o0,cosmo_bear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:08:47 2015 UTC,"How do we have no cap space when everyone on our team seems underpaid, sans Millsap?"
AtlantaHawks,3bw9o0,Atownbomber,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:29:22 2015 UTC,"After that Thompson/Landry/Stauskas trade, maybe Philly is willing to take on assets. Can we have Hollis Thompson for Mike Scott and Shelvin Mack? Should be good enough for at least Jerian Grant. Maybe throw in the TWolves 1st rounder from the Payne trade to sweeten the pot. I know Hinkie likes to stock up on picks."
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,SuperBowlDolphin,17,Thu Jul 2 04:37:07 2015 UTC,"Hate to see him go, but he deserved to get paid. He's had to grind every day since he came into the league and it's finally rewarded him. Best of luck to him.  Except when we play him."
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,DankVoid,11,Thu Jul 2 04:40:12 2015 UTC,Nothing but love to the JYD
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,JerryLangford,9,Thu Jul 2 04:43:49 2015 UTC,I just really hope we give him a warm welcome when he comes back to Atlanta
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,timboslice22,10,Thu Jul 2 13:02:04 2015 UTC,Love Carroll as a person but he bamboozelled the Raptors.
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,mehjbmeh,7,Thu Jul 2 07:18:05 2015 UTC,It was great watching Demarre go from underrated to a highly sought-after free agent. One of my favorite Hawks in recent memory.
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,bearg0d,4,Thu Jul 2 06:40:48 2015 UTC,He was a blast to watch in the playoffs. He willed us to at least one win. I hope for his sake that carries into Toronto. Time will tell
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,thrashfan,6,Thu Jul 2 06:47:53 2015 UTC,Can't wait til he comes back. He'll get a well deserved standing ovation from me -- never took a possession off the past 2 years. Can't say we would have seen Hawks basketball into late May this season without his heroic performances tbh.
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,Orgcore,7,Thu Jul 2 15:56:46 2015 UTC,Glad he's getting paid but I'm gonna miss him. :.(
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,ArchEast,3,Thu Jul 2 12:51:51 2015 UTC,Coolest hair on a 60 win team.
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,DEaster89,8,Thu Jul 2 07:17:23 2015 UTC,I think Shröder takes that category.
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,THR33ZUS_BANGS,2,Thu Jul 2 12:34:25 2015 UTC,"Really sad not to have him anymore, still thinking about buying his jersey on discount."
AtlantaHawks,3bu6u2,jknox94,2,Thu Jul 2 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"Anyone find it weird that Drake hasn't welcomed him to the ""6"" yet? He does it for almost all of the Raptors players and Demarre is the newest and highest paid one on the team now...no love from DRAKE?!!?"
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,thrashfan,14,Thu Jul 2 11:38:28 2015 UTC,"Hey small forwards, we came here to use cap space and use the MLE. And we're all out of cap space."

AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:44:06 2015 UTC,I love that song. Gary Clark Jr is a revelation.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,cosmo_bear,2,Mon Jul 6 11:03:36 2015 UTC,Does anybody have any clue who the starting day small forward will be? I assume Thabo but if he is still hurt then what do we do?
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Jus10Crummie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about Thabo's broken leg too much. Fractures are generally less serious than ligament damage. But yes, as it stands he's the starter. However, I would expect us to go after a defensive minded wing that has something resembling a 3 point shot with our MLE."
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,duhpolan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:32:40 2015 UTC,"God I want Baze to start so bad, I know he's raw but the only way he will reach his potential is if Bud puts the pressure on him, I really like Thabo coming off the bench. I mean worst case scenario he does really bad for awhile and never improves and we put our veteran starting caliber SF in the lineup."
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Crcsoccer1,5,Mon Jul 6 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"Don't know anything about this, but wasn't there a post about the new ownership wanting to spend over the cap?"
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,mehjbmeh,2,Thu Jul 2 13:38:47 2015 UTC,http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/basketball/hawks-will-exceed-salary-cap-when-final-roster-set/nmqcM/?ecmp=ajc_social_twitter_2014_hawks_sfp  Article from today that states Hawks will land somewhere between 67/69 million and 80/82 million. States Tony still wants to go over the cap.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,BishonenOtaku,15,Thu Jul 2 14:11:30 2015 UTC,~♡~♡~ Repost if you're a strong independant Hawks team that don't need no cap space ~♡~♡~
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Shade_Raven,5,Thu Jul 2 15:19:22 2015 UTC,Maybe we can ask the Cavs for some of their magic cap space
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Crcsoccer1,2,Thu Jul 2 15:18:10 2015 UTC,Cavs have a 120mil payroll like wtf
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,randomdude45678,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:34:46 2015 UTC,Alright so this article has us at $67.8 million after all the deals. So if they cut Daye and the cap rises to $69 million that would give the Hawks $3 million in cap space. So there is still hope.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,justcamp,3,Thu Jul 2 14:02:33 2015 UTC,Do I smell.....luxury tax? Hell if the Cavs can commit $120mil to player salaries in one year we should atleast be able to do like 80mil  Ressler pls
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,randomdude45678,5,Thu Jul 2 14:05:49 2015 UTC,You can't just sign dudes and push yourself over the cap. It's going to take a sign and trade to get an FA that pushes us over the cap.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,justcamp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:54:34 2015 UTC,Why not?
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,ATL_GritzBlitz,5,Thu Jul 2 14:57:09 2015 UTC,That's how the cap works during FA. It's so the Knicks or Lakers can't go buy up all the big name FAs without working some deals and losing assets.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Crcsoccer1,2,Thu Jul 2 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"You can only go over the cap to re-sign your own guys, that's how the Cavs are doing it."
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,hecrey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, cmon Tony"
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,cosmo_bear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:09:59 2015 UTC,Anyone know of any realistic SF options with the cap situation?
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,peruseaway,2,Thu Jul 2 14:32:42 2015 UTC,Mid-level exception.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,tocohills,2,Thu Jul 2 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"I am looking at Corey brewer, but I don't know if he would take the mid level"
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Mrchickfila,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:19:19 2015 UTC,KJ McDaniels? He's cheap.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,tocohills,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:11:54 2015 UTC,Honestly we are going to have to do some trades to fill the hole.
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,cteez910,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:58:35 2015 UTC,Rumor is Quincy Acy. Gerald Green will cost at least 7 mil. Scott and Mack on the trading block. That's $5 mil if you can find a buyer. Maybe Philly?
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,peruseaway,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"I like Omri Casspi  Pistons just took on Danny Granger.  Wonder what it would take to get him.    Brewer seems too expensive with our current situation.  Dont know how much Bellinelli might be, hes played SF before."
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,Crcsoccer1,0,Thu Jul 2 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am hoping maybe we could pull some magic. I think ferry made a mistake by not getting Paul at least on a 3 year deal so that we could have his bird rights.   Corey would be perfect I just don't know the market for him, but I think you are correct in saying we are priced out at the moment. But he would be perfect.    Marco can't play defense from what I remember but he would be a nice piece.    I don't know anyone on this team I would want to trade for a small forward who wasn't young and up and coming. Kind of wish we found a way to keep oubre."
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,cosmo_bear,-1,Thu Jul 2 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"EVERYBODY REMEMBER ALL THESE DEALS ARE STILL JUST RUMORS, SO PLEASE JUST WAIT AND #BELIEVE-IN-BUD and #TRUST-TONY"
AtlantaHawks,3bv2c3,hosey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"Well, you're half wrong/half right. The deals cannot be come official until next week due to league rules, but they are agreed upon, and I have never seen anyone back out of an agreed upon deal."
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Calicagoan,16,Wed Jul 1 22:36:13 2015 UTC,I like that a lot better than 4 years. Good deal.
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,cosmo_bear,0,Wed Jul 1 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I like this deal a lot better. I'm excited about our new bigs rotation, unless we try to dish Splitter before the season starts."
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,vernalagnia,13,Thu Jul 2 01:32:02 2015 UTC,So we keep Paul and don't have to commit $80mil over 4 years.   Win-win
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,MovingToSeattleSoon,0,Wed Jul 1 22:40:28 2015 UTC,And we still have a shit ton of cap space
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Mybrainmelts,5,Wed Jul 1 22:52:46 2015 UTC,Huh? We have like 4 mil left.
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Tomahawkchop14,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"We have none left. :\ Depending on where the cap ends up, it looks like we will have to try and trade Scott or Mack. Unless Splitter waives his trade kicker."
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Bankingitbig,2,Wed Jul 1 23:38:57 2015 UTC,I can part with Mack.
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,SamBo_LamBo,2,Thu Jul 2 00:04:26 2015 UTC,please god not mike scott
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Keeks_marone,10,Thu Jul 2 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Our front court seems rather loaded now with Paul, Splitter and Horford."

AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,StoopidFlexin,5,Wed Jul 1 22:45:52 2015 UTC,"I think many of us saw this coming months ago; Carroll goes for the money(rightfully so), and Millsap takes a hometown deal.  So happy to see the team mostly back together and adding Splitter for basically nothing."
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,ATL_GritzBlitz,3,Wed Jul 1 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"A ""hometown"" deal would be Millsap signing for his Early Bird Rights which would be 3years/$53M would allow us to go over the cap. Then we would have roughly ~5.5M to spend on a wing player."

AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Sub8sub,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:39:11 2015 UTC,This makes me SUPER excited because Millsap structured this to help bring in more players AND give him to option to stay on for a bird rights contract when the cap jumps :)   Hope to see him retire a Hawk!
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,mehjbmeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:06:15 2015 UTC,This isn't structured at all to help bring in more players though. :\ He is just betting on himself again and thinks he can get one last big pay day when the cap is significantly increased.
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Bankingitbig,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:41:59 2015 UTC,I mean I see nothing wrong with that. It helps us both
AtlantaHawks,3bt2ou,Coachpatato,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:29:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. I like the 2+1 year deal better than the 4 year.
AtlantaHawks,3bva33,paybe_mossibly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"How good is Tobias Harris going to be? Looking at some of these highlight videos, the kid can do it all on the offensive end. Good handle, hits the three with a good-looking, smooth form on his jumper, attacks well, finishes above the rim, seems to play with real intensity. He averaged 17/6 last year and he's only 22.  So what's the catch? Why wouldn't the Hawks have gone for him prior to offering Millsap that initial crazy deal? I haven't seen Harris play much because Orlando is never on tv. Is he inconsistent? Bad attitude? Lazy? Terrible defender?  I can spot elite bball talent pretty well in younger pros, could tell that James Harden and Paul George were going to be elite players way before they were being talked about. I'm having a similar reaction to Harris but just haven't seen enough of his body of work to really say one way or another. He's without a doubt got the offensive potential, though."

AtlantaHawks,3brkcl,tabelz,6,Wed Jul 1 16:28:07 2015 UTC,Millsap cannot play the 3. So much slower than the average SF.
AtlantaHawks,3brkcl,trafewsan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"yeah, Tiago will probably be the first man off the bench, but I do like that we can finally have a big lineup if the need arises."
AtlantaHawks,3brkcl,tabelz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:49:05 2015 UTC,I mean if Millsap leaves Tiago's good enough to start probably and Horford can go play the 4 like he did in college?
AtlantaHawks,3brkcl,ajg47,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:52:07 2015 UTC,Yes but we still need a starting SF. Thabo has no offense and don't think Kent is ready for it yet.

AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,T64dw4n,7,Thu Jul 2 20:42:03 2015 UTC,I've seen the opposite assertion. People think he's a fully rounded player. Edy is not. Keep in mind Bud's previous treatment of rookies and temper your expectations for the guy. Tavares IS going to ride the bench and he IS going to spend time with the D League club this year. He IS NOT some proven commodity. Be excited but be realists in your expectations for a young guy who only started playing ball 7 years ago.
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,justcamp,4,Thu Jul 2 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"He's far from well rounded, but it's not like he's trash...He played in the same league as Moose and he out rebounded Moose in that league and Moose did decently for his 1st year, so there is something to look forward to"
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,justcamp,5,Thu Jul 2 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"If you'll recall, Moose came over in 13-14 due to injury, then bounced between the bench and D-League. It takes a while for big guys to get used to the speed of the NBA. I'm just saying this to combat the idea that we have ""three real centers."" We have a starter in Al. We have a backup in Splitter. We have a bench big in Moose. We have an unknown quantity in Edy. Buds system is not easy for rookies to grasp and he generally does not give them much time. Tavares may excel, but let's be real, we know nothing about the guy as an NBA player."
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,justcamp,2,Thu Jul 2 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"Valid point. I guess I'll just hold off on assumptions until I see how he does once the season starts...Summer League isn't a real meter of how a player will perform either, but I def see Edy play in the D-League multiple times this season. I just don't think he's gonna end up being like Gustavo Ayon when he played for us...Edy will see more minutes consistently imo."
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,atomsej,2,Thu Jul 2 22:26:06 2015 UTC,"Don't take me saying Edy will play in the D League to mean I think he's a D League talent. Moose and Schro both did stints there to quicken their route to the roster. Both are staples of the team moving forward, but had mechanics to work out before taking on a larger role in the NBA. It's just how Bud does things. Honestly, I do think it will take a longer time for him to grasp the NBA game than it did for them because of his size and because he started playing ball later than either of them."
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,justcamp,3,Thu Jul 2 22:28:56 2015 UTC,I'm still not convinced he will be able to transition to the NBA successfully at all. When you're 7'3 and were picked late in the draft then that's a very risky maneuver and hes going to need to put in a lot of hard work to be decent in the NBA.
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,killjoyous,3,Thu Jul 2 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's a project. I'm glad we'll get to see what we have in him this year, but I don't expect Edy to contribute much."
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,cosmo_bear,2,Thu Jul 2 22:39:08 2015 UTC,All 7 footers come with risks attached...look at all the 7 footers who were busts that were picked up in the first round
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,k10taylor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:03:45 2015 UTC,He really has improved a ton since we drafted him though
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,ATLjoe93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:39:45 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that the Hawks had him pegged as a late first rounder and got him in the early second.
AtlantaHawks,3bwwp7,Matt2486,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:06:07 2015 UTC,He did end up leading the league in rebounds (7.9) and blocks (1.7 I believe)

AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,DankVoid,29,Wed Jul 1 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"I'm completely fine with him walking. Since the day he came into the league, he's had to fight to stay alive. Now that his hard work has finally paid off, he deserves to make his money."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,DankVoid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:27:22 2015 UTC,100% But it sounds like he never gave coming back a thought even though the money wasn't the best
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,T64dw4n,14,Wed Jul 1 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that Atlanta's FO made it clear from the beginning that they weren't going to reach on him, so there wasn't much to discuss. I would have a problem with this if DeMarre was a well established player in the league who had already made his money, but this is different."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,GT2018,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"totally agree...he was good in our system, not sure if it will translate in another team's system, so I hope he gets his money and then realizes how good it was here and eventually ends up a bench player on the Hawks 6 time NBA championship roster in the early 2020s"
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,justcamp,5,Thu Jul 2 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"I hate that he left. He was one of my all time favorite Hawks. With that being said, if I were him I would totally do the same thing."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,myatl,9,Thu Jul 2 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what DMC did for the team, but I appreciate Wilcox/Bud even more for not overpaying for an asset."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,scene_missing,19,Wed Jul 1 22:36:16 2015 UTC,President Bud already knows he can coach up another SF that fits his system. Whoevers next in line will thrive under the president's care.  Bud may be a coach but he is a bad a$$ too.

AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,Starsy,3,Thu Jul 2 04:23:07 2015 UTC,"I've said it once and i'll say it again. Demarre was great for us and i wish him nothing but the best unless he's playing us. But he had a good season in a system that he thrived in that i don't see him replicating next season, at all. Only a fool would've paid him that much. Imagine paying him and letting trill walk...That's madness."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,shyspy,3,Thu Jul 2 00:08:41 2015 UTC,"At least we know Coach Bud can separate the emotions of being the HC that sees these players every day, sees them grow, and switch into rational-GM-mode that has to keep the Hawks as a business franchise, successful. Paying the Junkyard Dog 15 mil a year -- that's bad business.   Also, tangent hot take, there's a reason Toronto will forever remain just 'that team in Canada that Drake likes'. Someone try to explain to me this move? I love JYD as much as anyone, but a world where he will make potentially more than D-Wade, and almost double Aron Afflalo and Jae Crowder (similar players I might add), is a world that I'm not sure I understand anymore; and neither do the Raptors apparently."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,_durren_,7,Thu Jul 2 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"Carroll's awesome year was a product of the system. He'll disappoint outside Atlanta.  Good luck to him, of course, but he'll be traded before his contract is out as a valuable expiring contract."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,poolnickv,6,Wed Jul 1 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"The problem is Bazemore and Thabo aren't as good as him, so this hurts our depth big time, unless we find or develop another Demarre.   He was also arguably our best player in the playoffs, so I think we'll miss him as much as he'll miss us."
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,Adampro123,5,Thu Jul 2 00:37:50 2015 UTC,But has Bazemore peaked yet talent wise? I feel they could coach him up to be near the same type of player as Demarre was. Good for him for getting the pay he deserves though.
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,broeho,2,Thu Jul 2 03:39:28 2015 UTC,Bazemore ain't that kind of guy.
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,drsmith21,4,Thu Jul 2 06:40:22 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm the only one who thinks that DeMarre is going to be a star. Everyone else seems to think he was only good because of our system. I guess we'll see. Glad he got paid.
AtlantaHawks,3bt0ma,abesrevenge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"I can honestly say, yes.  I think you are the only person who i've ever heard say that they think DeMarre is going to be a star."

AtlantaHawks,3btfps,crustman34,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"The Hawks don't have a mid-level exception, just the $2.8 million room exception. The Hawks will sign Millsap with cap space, which means they must first renounce all exceptions except the room exception."

AtlantaHawks,3bs4cb,THR33ZUS_BANGS,5,Wed Jul 1 19:36:16 2015 UTC,No income Tax in FL...  I wouldn't blame him.  Other than the 2 years he's spent here what ties does he have to ATL.  I don't blame anyone for taking more money.
AtlantaHawks,3bs4cb,ScottX99,8,Wed Jul 1 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"The income tax aspect is always overblown. Athletes, performers and entertainers that make this kind of cash have to apportion their income-earning activities - meaning 50% of is it state-tax free, but the rest is taxed in the state it's earned.  So over the life of an 4 year/80MM contract, we're talking about $2.4M of a difference between FLA and GA. That amount could likely be more than made up for with better endorsement deals playing in a bigger market and for a better team."
AtlantaHawks,3bs4cb,THR33ZUS_BANGS,3,Wed Jul 1 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"This is the point I was trying to make. Success and legacy trumps a little bit of money playing in a down market. In this case, Atlanta looks like a much brighter future over Orlando for Millsap.   On a side note - I love always getting down voted for voicing an opinion in my own team's sub. So what if we disagree? I didn't attack anyone, just stated what I might do in a given situation. Man, sometimes the people in here who call themselves ""fans"" really disappoint me. Makes a guy not even want to come here sometimes..."
AtlantaHawks,3bs4cb,Ellimistopher,2,Wed Jul 1 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"Atlanta looks like a much brighter future over Orlando for Millsap.   Are you sure about that? They just drafted the Croatian Kobe, and have that crazy hair dude Elfrid."

AtlantaHawks,3bs4cb,Ellimistopher,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I thought we were talking about the future.   In any case Vucevic, Harris, and Fournier are entering their 4th seasons, and Oladipo is entering his 3rd season. So only Elfrid would be a 2nd year player in the starting lineup. They would bring Hezonja and Gordon off the bench.  I mean, if you want a chance to win a championship right now, you come back to Atlanta, but in 2 or 3 years, Orlando might be much better positioned than an aging Atlanta squad."

AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,TheEggmannn,2,Wed Jul 1 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"No where close to joe Johnson. Joe had the biggest contract in the nba over like 7 years, millsap's deal is pretty standard considering the deals inferior players(Middleton, brandon knight, Tyson jackson) are getting. We aren't getting a superstar this offseason and we don't need one to win the championship. Our biggest advantage is bud's system in bud I trust"
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,myatl,8,Wed Jul 1 22:23:19 2015 UTC,What would ferry have done....... Im curious to know.... Burr...
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,mavajo,-9,Wed Jul 1 14:22:23 2015 UTC,"He'd let Millsap walk instead of overpaying and hamstringing the franchise, and he'd find some economical option(s) to re-supplement the team output.

I know you guys want to hope beyond hope that our franchise didn't just shoot itself in the foot (again), but it did."

AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,DankVoid,2,Wed Jul 1 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"Probably should have clarified. I disagree with matching Orlando. I think it's good to try and keep him, but I think that we panicked and overpaid him. He's voiced in the past that he loves the Hawks organization, and that would lead me to believe that he would be willing to take a pay cut (or just not a max deal) to stay here. Taking a max deal would mean that DeMarre would most likely walk, and resultantly would take away part of what Millsap loves in Atlanta."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Ithinkiamjoseph,14,Wed Jul 1 14:47:08 2015 UTC,that would lead me to believe that he would be willing to take a pay cut   Not the best to bet on a professional athlete taking a pay cut.

AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,fuzzyllama1,4,Wed Jul 1 15:42:33 2015 UTC,I mean he's a two time all star...and amazing is just a word. It's not like comparing him to AD or something.

AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,SSTATL,6,Wed Jul 1 15:07:46 2015 UTC,"I imagine we'll regress further without him and they'll be even unhappier.  Having cap space is key in the NBA, but the Hawks have struggled mightily to get anyone to come here the past 20 years, what good is the cap space going to be if we can't get anyone to use it?"
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,drsmith21,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"Really,  cap space doesn't mean shit in the NBA. Most teams stay over the cap. Aside from the Heat getting LeBron,  no NBA champ has won after signing a big name FA using cap space."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Capn_Barboza,0,Wed Jul 1 21:51:12 2015 UTC,There's a difference between using it just cause you have it and using it in a fiscally responsible way.   Was the teams success linked completely to milsap or was it more due to how good of a coach Bud is?  If it's the latter then it's always a mistake to give Milsap a max contract. It's not like he's Lebrick or something.
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,SSTATL,3,Wed Jul 1 15:34:30 2015 UTC,Demarre just signed for 4/60 with the Raps...you think Milsap isn't worth 20 if Demarre is worth 15?
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Capn_Barboza,0,Wed Jul 1 16:10:41 2015 UTC,Well now that we have splitter doesn't that create a log jam in the front court?
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,online_predator,0,Wed Jul 1 16:19:05 2015 UTC,Splitter isn't going to play more than 55 games this year
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,SSTATL,5,Wed Jul 1 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"her option. What we should have done with Marvin and Joe.   He made the All-Star game the past two seasons, you don't think he was a factor for this team's success this year?   Dragic just re-upped for 5/90 mil, contracts and cap space are going to skyrocket the next two years...do you think the Hawks should just roll out the same team next year minus Milsap and Demarre and hope we can sign a big-time FA even though everyone else will have cap space?"
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Capn_Barboza,-2,Wed Jul 1 15:50:34 2015 UTC,Who's to say the next Milsap isn't out there willing to take a cheaper deal?
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,paybe_mossibly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"Look at where we finished this season, and how that still got us absolutely nothing in free agency. You think LaMarcus Aldridge or Marc Gasol will have an easier time getting to the Finals in a Hawks jersey or a Spurs or Grizzlies jersey, where they still have to get through GSW, OKC, Houston, Dallas, LAC, and each other? Obviously big name players are not interested in Atlanta. There is no reason to let a guy like Millsap walk and have an average 6-7 seed team while money just sits around in your vault if no one is going to play here even when you're the best-coached team in the conference by a mile and made it to the conference finals with half the talent these other teams have.   You sign Millsap and you stay in the top 3 of the East for a few years if you want a chance in hell of getting a big time free agent down the line."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Capn_Barboza,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:54:46 2015 UTC,I understand your logic. But the last time we gave a guy a max contract the fans and ownership chased him out of town because it hurt our cap flexibility.   Let's also not forget that we will be resigning Horford and Teague next  year. So depending on what the max contract is next season we'll probably only be able to retain 1 of those.  Edit  not Teague just Horford next season.
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,paybe_mossibly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"Right, but Paul is not Joe, Joe is not a likable guy and Paul is as hard-working as it gets in this league. That's not gonna change, he's just one of those blue collar players, that's how he got into the league being undersized.   And again, this cap flexibility isn't gonna matter because we had a shitload of flexibility and the perfect fit for a guy like Gasol or Aldridge and neither gave us the time of day.   We'll see what happens with Horford and Teague. Schroder is going to be better than Teague in 2 seasons barring injury so we'll probably let Teague walk."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Capn_Barboza,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:09:39 2015 UTC,Joe was more likeable when he wasn't making max money.   At this point I hope Paul stays with us as he's our only hope. Without him our line up next season is super sketchy... Teague Korver Bazemore Horford and Splitter.   Still don't like Bazemore getting starter minutes so hopefully there's a replacement for DMC out there.
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,drsmith21,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"This isn't a max contract. It's the largest we could offer him,  but it's not a max contract."

AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,azuresou1,2,Wed Jul 1 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm gonna be the dissenting voice and say that I think this is a reasonable deal, and that you guys are CRAZY for comparing this to Joe Johnson's contract.  The cap is $69M this year and will be $89M next year. That means Millsap's $20M a season is hefty at 29% of cap this year, but then only 22% of cap next season.   22% of cap for arguably the best player (probably 2nd best) on a 60 win team who is still in his prime is a phenomenal deal.  Compare this to Joe getting 6 years, $119M in a time where the salary cap was around $58M. He was getting something like 32% of the cap, on a team that was barely making it out of the first round, and his game had already begun declining."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,mehjbmeh,2,Wed Jul 1 16:17:54 2015 UTC,Thank god. If Splitter is his old self this could work out
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,StoopidFlexin,2,Wed Jul 1 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"Damn thats way too much, but that bum Khris Middelton got $15 mill a season"
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Intercepting,4,Wed Jul 1 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"At first I thought this was a stupid offer. But, after reading the comments, I think the management is making a good move.   And remember, Ressler said we're spending over the salary cap so we still have an extra 15 million to play with. I think he may be perfectly okay with paying the luxury tax for a year just to bring back DMC, since the cap is going to jump in a year.   I trust the management on this one."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,whtge8,2,Wed Jul 1 15:28:57 2015 UTC,Magic fan here. This looks like a lot of money to you guys and not a lot of you seem happy about this. Is this strictly because of the money or does Millsap not deserve that much? I wouldn't mind overpaying for him since he is that kind of talent that could really put us into playoff contention. Plus not a lot of people are salivating at the opportunity to join Orlando so we usually end up overpaying.
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,Capn_Barboza,3,Wed Jul 1 14:40:11 2015 UTC,I'm having flashbacks of Joe Johnson now.
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,america_eff_yeah,2,Wed Jul 1 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"He's just at that point in his career where he probably will start to produce less. He's hit the peak and is starting to come down, IMO."
AtlantaHawks,3br6ce,tomchaney479,2,Wed Jul 1 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"Good point.  I didn't realize that he's 30 turning 31 next season.  So, he'll be making $20 mil when he's 33-34.  Doubtful that he'll be the same player then that he is now."

Who do you see itching to sign here? 3) Millsap is a proven all-star, DMC had one good season and basically a great playoff run- paying millsap posed the least risk 4) if we don't resign millsap, this team would be much worse next year.   5) CAW CAW mother feathers!!!!"

AtlantaHawks,3bsbo7,Crcsoccer1,5,Wed Jul 1 19:19:07 2015 UTC,I know the odds are exceedingly low but.....  Teague/Korver/Green/Horford/Splitter.  That sounds good.  That sounds real good.
AtlantaHawks,3bsbo7,nerdyintentions,2,Wed Jul 1 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"That would probably be an upgrade over Carroll, which is saying a lot when you consider how good Carroll became as a two-way player."

AtlantaHawks,3bsbo7,vernalagnia,3,Wed Jul 1 19:42:19 2015 UTC,Don't forget he's a RFA... So I imagine the warriors are low balling him at the moment.

AtlantaHawks,3bt8gy,Crcsoccer1,3,Wed Jul 1 23:45:02 2015 UTC,I'd love to get him but it would probably have to be a sign and trade

AtlantaHawks,3bt8gy,BeautifulMohammad,3,Wed Jul 1 23:26:42 2015 UTC,We are pretty much at the cap and you can only go over it to re-sign your own players or to use something like the mid level exception.
AtlantaHawks,3bt8gy,mehjbmeh,2,Wed Jul 1 23:26:49 2015 UTC,does the Tiago trade count under that? or only if we're at cap when we make the trade?
AtlantaHawks,3bt8gy,BeautifulMohammad,2,Thu Jul 2 02:14:40 2015 UTC,With his salary we are at the cap or very close to it.
AtlantaHawks,3bszh2,Admiral_Koofers,6,Wed Jul 1 22:10:55 2015 UTC,He's trash
AtlantaHawks,3bszh2,Decatur_Psalm,3,Wed Jul 1 22:34:03 2015 UTC,Because we need a quality starter better than Sefolosha and he isn't better than him
AtlantaHawks,3bszh2,Crcsoccer1,2,Wed Jul 1 22:19:10 2015 UTC,That's fair. Not interested in a 1-2 punch of offense and defense wih the two?
AtlantaHawks,3bszh2,playalisticadillac,2,Wed Jul 1 22:27:23 2015 UTC,I'd bring him in on the cheap and hope he gets hot from the arc every few games

AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,Martinsek,3,Wed Jul 1 19:06:59 2015 UTC,Could you explain a little bit more? I don't know what either of those terms mean LOL
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,Martinsek,11,Wed Jul 1 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"When you have a players Bird rights you are allowed to go over the salary cap to sign him, but when you go over the cap, you have to pay the luxury tax.   So basically Dan Gilbert has a metric fuck ton of money to spend."
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,cripplercrawlspace,2,Wed Jul 1 19:09:28 2015 UTC,Oh thanks for clearing that up for me.. So basically we're broke boiz???
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,Bankingitbig,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"No, neither Millsap nor DeMarre were on the team long enough for us to acquire their bird rights. They're unrestricted free agents because of this.  EDIT: What the guy below me said."
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,furycutter80,2,Wed Jul 1 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"Bird rights doesn't have anything to do with being unrestricted or restricted. We do have Early Bird Rights on Demarre and Paul, but unfortunately under that we can only offer Millsap something like $74M over 4 years (significantly less than the $80M he is offered). Thus, we are trying to match Magic's offer using our salary cap space rather than the Early Bird Rights. Another thing that having the Full Bird Rights allows you to do is to sign a player to 5 years instead of 4. This incentivizes players to stay with the team and take the longterm contract."
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,Bankingitbig,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:03:22 2015 UTC,Why do Bird rights only let us offer 74m? Don't we get to decide how much we offer him?
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,PiGaKiLa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"We only had the Early Bird rights (only 2 years on the team vs. 3). If we had full bird right we could have offered him max. With Early Bird Rights,  the first year salary can be no more than 175% of his previous salary, with non-compounded 7.5% raises each year after. So his last year salary of 9.5M * 175% = 16.625M starting salary with 7.5% raises afterward. If we did this, the only thing that would hit our salary cap would be his $12.350M cap hold. This would give us 18.8M(the starting salary Paul signed) - 12.350M(his cap hold) = ~6.45M more in cap space.  Edit: So since he wants the max, we are not using the Early Bird Exception to sign him, but instead are fully using our salary cap to sign him."
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,Intercepting,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:50:15 2015 UTC,"Our new owner Ressler has stated he plans to always spent over the salary cap, which is a very, very good thing for us. That being said, paying Carroll $15 million/yr just doesn't make sense for the team. He's just not worth that much to us. Horford's contract expires next season, and it'll cost us a max deal to resign him. Together with Millsap's offer this season, that will make two max deals on the team. Gotta b smart about the money elsewhere."
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,loosemoose9,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:19 2015 UTC,A metric fuck ton  New measurement?
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,StoopidFlexin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:14:57 2015 UTC,Close.  The salary cap is actually lower than the tax limit.  A team can be over the cap without paying tax.
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,broeho,4,Wed Jul 1 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"In essence, the Larry Bird exception allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign their own free agents, at an amount up to the maximum salary. To qualify as a Bird free agent, a player must have played three seasons without being waived or changing teams as a free agent."
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,cripplercrawlspace,2,Wed Jul 1 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"How are the lakers able to sign Kobe and LA (in theory) for monster contracts after getting luxury taxed out the ass for the past few years (Kobe, Nash, Dwight, etc.)?"

AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,RuntheFlats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:26:33 2015 UTC,Basically there's not a hard cap and they can go over the soft cap to retain players already on your team if they're willing to pay a luxury tax. Dan Gilbert is going to be paying over $100 mil in luxury tax this next year.
AtlantaHawks,3bs9y1,childishdorito12,2,Wed Jul 1 22:07:32 2015 UTC,I don't understand either. I'm gonna go with....this is all rigged lol

AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,StoopidFlexin,2,Wed Jul 1 17:03:28 2015 UTC,Didn't even think about that. Moose and Splitter is an awesome combo

AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,KickedInTheDonuts,9,Thu Jul 2 19:21:47 2015 UTC,Starts at center and moves Horford to PF.  The biggest hole to fill right now is Carroll leaving.
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,celtic-pride1,-7,Wed Jul 1 16:48:59 2015 UTC,Wouldn't Horford fill Carroll's position?
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,mfoste34,29,Wed Jul 1 16:52:53 2015 UTC,lol wut
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,kareemk,7,Wed Jul 1 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're being downvoted, could be honest mistake. The problem with that idea, is everything. Al doesn't fit the 3 spot (small forward) Al is the 4 spot (power forward) and could at times play the 5 (center). Nothing about Al's physical stature allows him to properly play the 3 for an extended period of time.   He's too slow, not as quick, and can't really shoot reliably from afar (3 point line).   He's solid from mid range doe."
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,Dabawse26,7,Wed Jul 1 17:11:05 2015 UTC,Ah. Is Millsapp also too big/slow for the position or could he possibly slide over for Horford?
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,kareemk,5,Wed Jul 1 17:13:56 2015 UTC,Millsap is too slow defensively to play SF full time
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,C-Jammin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:14:50 2015 UTC,Too big and slow. Not as athletic and a 3 should be. He's the perfect 4
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,alcoholsuperhero,4,Wed Jul 1 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"Horford at SF.  Lol no.  Millsap couldn't even go to SF.  Right now, our starter at SF would be Thabo."

AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,KickedInTheDonuts,3,Wed Jul 1 16:55:47 2015 UTC,Definitely makes me sad that we didn't stick with Oubre in the draft.  That's starting to look like a mistake.
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,alexteate,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"We got THJ and a couple of picks out of it so not really. And personally, I'm not seeing Oubre being that good of a player."
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,Decatur_Psalm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:23:23 2015 UTC,Can Sap guard and play the 3? I feel like his advantage is being a quick and undersized 4 that can stretch the defense. I see Tiago being the 1st sub off the bench for AL or Sap.
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,beefsupreme,8,Wed Jul 1 17:32:03 2015 UTC,Nah he's way too slow to play the 3 for large stretches. Also he's pretty slow on shot releases so it's hard to keep him on the perimeter.
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,SchroodCriminal,5,Wed Jul 1 17:53:10 2015 UTC,I doubt he is a starter but who knows at this point.
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,VusterJones,2,Wed Jul 1 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"IF, Sap comes back then instead of Sap-AL w/ bench of Scott-Pero we have Sap-Al w/ bench of Moose-Splitter Seems like a big upgrade all around, just not as much floor spacing."
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,SchroodCriminal,5,Wed Jul 1 16:53:11 2015 UTC,Pero is gone and I doubt we'll see Mike Scott in a hawks uniform again.
AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,DankVoid,6,Wed Jul 1 16:54:36 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying LAST YEAR our bench was Scott and Pero THIS YEAR it could be Moose and Splitter Big Upgrade IMO

AtlantaHawks,3brpsr,noodlz05,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"I like it and it could work IF the other team doesn't have a quick SF, but that probs won't be a consistent rotation considering all the small ball being played."
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,STUPlDSEXYFLANDERS,35,Wed Jul 1 17:14:10 2015 UTC,an absolutely terrible player who can't shoot or play defense who I also miss with all my heart already.
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,Martinsek,2,Wed Jul 1 17:14:59 2015 UTC,I feel your pain
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,besaid_jim,18,Wed Jul 1 17:17:48 2015 UTC,Carroll can't create much on his own. At the end of the season he was putting the ball down more and actually getting decent looks at the rim but honestly I believe he did as well as he did on offense because of the system we have. He had been in the league years before and only broke out last year. That being said he was our best player in the playoffs and has improved vastly on offense.  I believe he's an upgrade for you guys from Ross and he is a smart player but I highly doubt he will be as good for you as he was for us.  Just an opinion.
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,blopez86,2,Wed Jul 1 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's what I'm afraid of too, honestly. Atlanta plays a much more team-oriented style of basketball compared to Toronto's isos"
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,Hot_Lanta,3,Wed Jul 1 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"His defense will still be there though, and his hustle. So he will contribute on that end. Even if he isnt the offensive threat he was here, he should so fine for you guys. His three ball (which is decent) will still be there too. Think a a 10/3/5 kinda guy a night, but playing great D and giving it his all."
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,jknox94,10,Wed Jul 1 22:16:55 2015 UTC,Let the wound heal... Jeez
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,TrocarSlushWeasel,7,Wed Jul 1 17:27:42 2015 UTC,"He's terrible.  I hope you kept your receipt, because you should send him back."
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,broeho,5,Wed Jul 1 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"He's a really good 3 and D guy, with the added dimension of really great size for his position, both in length, and strength.  So he can often handle his own against bigger guys and scoop up rebounds, and score some garbage points... which are underrated."
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,cwolfe,6,Wed Jul 1 17:18:19 2015 UTC,He sucks. Give him back
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,besaid_jim,5,Wed Jul 1 18:11:12 2015 UTC,Treat him well! Toronto is very lucky to have him!
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,DankVoid,5,Wed Jul 1 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"He worked very well in our offense and I think he will have a pretty solid output for you guys, but I don't think he was worth 4 years $60M. I'm happy for him though, he's worked hard since the day he came into the league and completely deserves it."
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,JustHitTheBall,3,Wed Jul 1 17:38:43 2015 UTC,Great defender who relies on other players to get him scoring opportunities.  Scored almost 90% of his FG off assists.  And you guys are one of the worst assist teams in the league... Wouldn't worry about the D but not sure if he'll be able to score in TOR like he did in the ATL.
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,pln1991,3,Wed Jul 1 18:02:15 2015 UTC,Good shooter  Good cutter  Garbage buckets  Good (not great) defense  Hustle  Good dude
AtlantaHawks,3bru6j,mehjbmeh,2,Wed Jul 1 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"If we're being honest... ""we don't know.""  Carroll had a career year, BUT, he also was HUGELY benefited by the system here.  At worst he's a high motor guy with great D.  At best he's that with great shooting and clutch gene."

AtlantaHawks,3bs015,DankVoid,3,Wed Jul 1 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"Personally... I don't know. Part of me thinks that Millsap would be a little redundant given how much we're gonna have to pay for him. On the other hand, I still think Tobias Harris would be a gamble for how much we'll have to pay him, but we do need the depth at 3. While I don't really think they could go wrong either way, I'm leaning towards Tobias slightly at the moment."
AtlantaHawks,3bs015,Hot_Lanta,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:20:14 2015 UTC,Isn't Tobias coming off a achilles tear?  Those are notoriously hard to come back from if so. Generally taking a year or more to return to form.

AtlantaHawks,3bs015,DankVoid,4,Wed Jul 1 17:59:28 2015 UTC,Thabo and Baze currently. We could also let Sap go and try to sign Tobias Harris to play 3.

And here's the kicker, Millsap goes to the bench and play the David lee/Andre iggy role. Make a personal sacrifice to win us a god damned championship. Out bench would be sick tho, 1. Dennis (the QB) 2. THJ (the instant offense) 3. Thabo (defensive anchor) 4. Millsap (can also anything rebound, score, play defense) and 5.

AtlantaHawks,3br5cg,DankVoid,2,Wed Jul 1 14:15:14 2015 UTC,but more importantly with a lineup of possibly of three of our starters Korver Teague and Horford this team is a 6-8 seed and no better than the iso joe and smith days.

AtlantaHawks,3br2zd,mehjbmeh,2,Wed Jul 1 13:45:40 2015 UTC,I don't think we can do that since they're both free agents.
AtlantaHawks,3br2zd,Coppermcpick,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:59:51 2015 UTC,"We technically can, but I don't see it happening. We could sign Millsap and extend his birds rights (I believe), then trade his birds rights and him to the Magic. The Magic could do the same for Tobias. I believe the Magic even with this deal can still match any offer for Harris though and I don't see why they wouldn't. Harris can play the 3 spot."
AtlantaHawks,3br2zd,Countingfrog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:30 2015 UTC,Don't have bird rights. He was only a 2 year contract.

AtlantaHawks,3br2zd,mjridiculouz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:03:17 2015 UTC,Magic fan here. Only reason why Millsap would come to us over staying is he doesn't believe that Atlanta can beat Cleveland so with that being said he would just go where the money is. But if he doesn't believe that you guys can beat Cleveland then he should stay in my opinion.

AtlantaHawks,3bqyja,thrashfan,0,Wed Jul 1 13:02:29 2015 UTC,Clicking on filters no longer takes you to weird links. Changed it to open a search page. Much cleaner.
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,thrashfan,20,Wed Jul 1 02:17:35 2015 UTC,"IMPORTANT NOTES:   4yr/$80mil will last Paul til he is 34. Right around the time it will be obvious he lost a step The salary cap is expected to jump to $69mil this year In 2016-17, the cap will be approximately $90mil In 2017-18, the cap will be approximately $108mil and level off from there. Meaning this contract won't lock us up for long I believe this contract still hurts other signing because Millsap is a UFA and we have to sign him with cap space since his early bird rights only allowed us to sign him to approximately $13mil   All in all, this is the correct move. He was integral to our system and while it may out us over the cap this year, next year his hold will only be 22% of the cap. And in 17-18 it will only be 18.5% of the cap. I think it's safe to say he is worth that. The organization wants to show that it takes care of it's own, and knowing this system is very important to success. Paul has had 2 years to peel back the playbook and really get comfortable. That comfort would take time to develop with any other power forward.  Lastly, if this means we can't sign Demarre, then so be it. I love Carroll but I believe what he brings to the team is more easily taught/replaced. You can teach defense and shooting to a player willing to work hard enough. It is much harder to find a guy Milsap's size who can hold his own against 3s, 4s, and 5s (although guarding 3s and 5s is only reasonable for a short amount of time. not the whole game)  We made it to the ECF even though we were plagued with injuries and our bench absolutely disappeared. We need to retain this guy.  EDIT: I posted this in a comment below but I figured I'd put it with this info as well. There are talks of us offering him less to start off but a 7.5% raise each year using the early bird exception so it totals as the same amount of money. I'm not a CBA expert though so that might not be possible  Here is a source from peachtreehoops that discusses the ability to raise the amount of money each year using the early bird exception. the TL;DR version of it is if we were to use that exception we could only offer $73,981,250 over the course of the contract"
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,Raydioactive,5,Wed Jul 1 14:29:32 2015 UTC,This kind of insight is very convincing as it uses logic to help us understand overarching theme. Job well done!!! Burrr!!!!
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,myatl,2,Wed Jul 1 14:46:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for looking at the situation in context of the long term CBA. If we're paying him $20 mil four years from now and he's still playing at this caliber, that's not a bad deal. However, I've yet to see a source on us matching the Magic deal, thinking we are trying to be creative with it. Possibly trying to convince Paul to risk another short term deal in light of the cap explosion two years from now."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,broeho,7,Wed Jul 1 18:06:35 2015 UTC,Does the city of Atlanta have the plague or something?  What is keeping free agents from considering us?  Pls someone explain.  Why is it that no free agent ever even considers ATL as a potential destination?  Now we are gonna have to lock down Millsap for 20 Mil/Yr unil he's 34 if we want any chance at signing a big-name player.
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,jknox94,2,Wed Jul 1 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"More to do with money than the city. Hawks don't have the flexibility to throw around max contracts like the Lakers, Knicks do. Hawks aren't the only ones that big name free agents aren't talking to. Consider the Cavs, Warriors, Clippers, Celtics. All these teams have made their roster moves in the past and have to work with what they have. They don't have great flexibility either, they can make little free agent moves here and there, but a big name free agent is mostly out of the question. Meanwhile, the Lakers, Magic, and Knicks have been keeping their rosters cheap to prepare for a big free agent market like this, that's why we can't compete."
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,broeho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:35:06 2015 UTC,Who are we overpaying right now?  I was under the impression that we are in a really good spot with cap space.  Lots of good contracts on this team.. that will probably change this summer as we have to overspend to get anyone.
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,jknox94,2,Wed Jul 1 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"We aren't overpaying anyone, I never said that. Just that the roster we built fills a lot of cap, and while we do have space it's not enough for big names. To build a contending roster you have to fill a lot of cap room, and we did."
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,broeho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:51:31 2015 UTC,I admittedly am no expert on NBA cap rules and bird rights and any of that stuff.... which is why my head is spinning when I hear that we can give 80 million bucks to a guy over 4 years and yet we can't afford to get a star player.  Especially when the Lakers are going crazy over the cap seemingly every year.  Are they not penalized for that?  Smh i don't get it.
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,Bankingitbig,2,Wed Jul 1 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"There are certain rules on when you can and cannot go over the cap. You're allowed to go over the cap to resign your own players if you have their Bird's rights. Unfortunately, we only have the early bird's rights for Carroll and Millsap (since they were with us for only two year). Thus, the contracts we can give them and go over the cap with aren't that high."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,Intercepting,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:52:04 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'd have to agree.  But I'd much rather take his $8.5 million deal than pay Millsap a max deal well into his 30's. We may have dodged a bullet on this one.

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,Intercepting,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:56:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I imagine his production is going to drop off at some point. He's turning 31 next season and that plays a HUGE factor in any sort of contract.  Like I said on another thread, I think the Magic are overpaying just so they can be somewhat of a winner again. They're going to find themselves stuck in the same loop we were in, though - winning 45-50 games a year and not being exactly mediocre, but not great either."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,fuzzyllama1,2,Wed Jul 1 16:09:14 2015 UTC,Hoping we let Millsap walk and get 2 solid guys for the 20 million instead
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,noitamroftuo,2,Wed Jul 1 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"Jae Crowder would be the perfect fit for this team. Would love to have him as our starting SF. Doesnt need the ball to be productive, stands up to superstars, solid defense. I think hed replace Demarre very well."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,trafewsan,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:20 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we can go over
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,jknox94,2,Wed Jul 1 15:29:53 2015 UTC,we are going over the cap...i think people just don't want us going over the cap for someone like paul
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,rompskee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Paul (and DMC) is Unrestricted with only 2 years on the team, so no full Bird rights.  Because of that, Atlanta can only offer a contract that is within cap space."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,jknox94,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"Getting Millsap back would make the Splitter deal make less sense. Not no sense, but less sense. I assumed when that deal went through that upper management had a suspicion that Millsap wouldn't be back. But hey, Splitter and Moose spelling Paul and Al would be a solid frontcourt rotation. I'm all for it. Especially if we aren't getting Tavares."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,ichinii,3,Wed Jul 1 23:40:49 2015 UTC,Well both are synonymous with celebrating about closing out a series just a little too early
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:13:51 2015 UTC,Any realistic possible SF that the Hawks could still bring in?  What do we have left to offer?
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:14:38 2015 UTC,So since Millsap has resigned realistically can we get anybody else or are we done?
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,fireglz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:41:18 2015 UTC,We can free up about 5 million in space by cutting Daye and the cap raise by 2 million. So a vet minimum is probably all that's left unless Paul is signed last and they use early bird rights on him

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,cwolfe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:19:57 2015 UTC,why is there so much negativity about Tiago? is he not good? because from what I've seen in my many years of watching the NBA is that he's good AND he has playoff experience...8.5 mil is not bad for him
AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,jknox94,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"It's not bad, but it does throw a big wrench in Demarre/Millsap talks."

AtlantaHawks,3bpeyh,DankVoid,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:23:58 2015 UTC,we should go for Paul pierce for the small forward position cause why not
AtlantaHawks,3bpxo5,mehjbmeh,8,Wed Jul 1 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"“Once I heard him say that, all hands on deck now,” Hardaway told reporters Monday at his introductory press conference in Atlanta. “Obviously as a basketball player, you take that to heart. So, it’s time to move on, get better, and when the time comes, the time comes. Right now, it’s all about Atlanta basketball.”  Sounds to me like we need to thank the ""Zen Master"" for giving Hardaway some motivation to reach his potential. Pretty much openly admits he wasn't giving it his all in NY and honestly, I can't blame him. The Knicks were in tank mode and he was getting shoved into an offense that didn't fit him. I'm becoming more and more excited to see what he becomes here."
AtlantaHawks,3bpxo5,DankVoid,3,Wed Jul 1 05:10:33 2015 UTC,Exactly. Once tank mode is engaged it's basically damage control for the players. Why go all out if you know you're going to be at the bottom of the league? The last thing they (the players) want to do is injure themselves and have their career take a completely different path.
AtlantaHawks,3bpxo5,kraken-on-standby,7,Wed Jul 1 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"It didn't look like Phil is giving it a 100% effort in the office last season, so why would the players try their best?"
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,furycutter80,6,Tue Jun 30 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of these are still just rumors and ""reports,"" which aren't always true. The only real reports I believe are from either Stein (sometimes) and Wojnarowski (probably butchered his spelling).  Sometimes this talk are smoke screens that teams are laying out to try and fool other executives.   Stay positive man. Believe in Wilcox, Ressler, and Bud."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,Intercepting,2,Tue Jun 30 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"I believe. I also know that there are more than just 3 or 4 FA's out there. Plus people are opting out of contracts left and right like K. Love, DWade and David West so there will be options now."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,myatl,10,Tue Jun 30 17:33:50 2015 UTC,Ur concern is legit and a very healthy one too cuz it means you genuinely care about ur team.  But don worry and believe in bud.
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,abesrevenge,9,Tue Jun 30 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"When have they ever got a top tier FA? It was a pipe dream to think they were realistically going to get any of those guys. They have a plan and it does not involve landing any of those three, trust me. They know what is realistic way before any of us do."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,paybe_mossibly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:49:34 2015 UTC,What's the plan now?
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,abesrevenge,2,Wed Jul 1 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"Sign back Milsap and offer max deal to Harris to play 3. Splitter at 5, Horford at 4 (finally his natural pos.). Looks like an ECF favorite if the pieces fall right."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,paybe_mossibly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:59 2015 UTC,Except you forgot about Millsap in building your rotation. Splitter will come off the bench and Al will stay trapped at the 5 and Millsap will start at the 4.   And correct me if I'm wrong but the Hawks can't afford to pay Tobias max money after the Millsap deal. Magic can offer him more. I think he'll stay.   So we're in a bit of trouble as we don't have a legit starting 3. If we could get a nice swingman we'll be good to go but it's looking impractical at the moment.
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,abesrevenge,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:05:28 2015 UTC,Corey Brewer is still out there and Splitter is going to start at the 5 I am almost certain. He will be a double double guy almost every night in this system.
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,meep6969,3,Wed Jul 1 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"Bud has proven that he can turn that lower 2nd or 3rd tier guy into a highly productive player. Just look at Demarre Carrol who was averaging 6 points a game before he came here, the Hawks have a phenomenal development staff who can turn any guy into 1st string man. You just have to have faith in Bud, no worries"
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,mehjbmeh,2,Tue Jun 30 17:36:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if all we do this year is bring back everyone and they actually stay healthy, we're looking at much better results.  I fully believe the 3 out of 4 wins vs the Cavs is more indicative of the team than the sweep.  We had no one who could really guard James and there were open shots for days, they just didn't seem to fall.  I think a lot of it was playoff jitters. Some desire to get revenge for a sweep could do a lot to help."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,usmseawright,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"My greatest hope is that one more year near the top of the east might put us in some serious FA conversations next year when the cap goes up. I feel like if we put production into places that were missing it before, as in Pero and Brand's cases. Plus we get Thabo back. We should be better next year anyway, imo."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,DankVoid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:15:11 2015 UTC,"I'll believe it when these guys actually sign. Until then, anything can happen technically. Sadly, I don't think we're going to make any blockbuster deals this summer. I realistically see us as a low to mid 50-win team who has a shot at getting to the ECFs. I don't see us getting to the Finals until we make such a deal. Until the opportunity presents itself, I think the organization's plan will be to keep the main pieces around and wait for the right move."
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,callmerevan,0,Tue Jun 30 17:15:51 2015 UTC,Marc pls :(
AtlantaHawks,3bnfho,BeautifulMohammad,-5,Tue Jun 30 21:42:09 2015 UTC,"Bringing back Louis Williams for 10 mill. 3 point shooting, the system!"
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,DankVoid,7,Tue Jun 30 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"Ill give it my best shot.   PG- Teague, Dennis, Mack    Jeff has this spot on lock down. He is the perfect fit for us too. Passing vision is excellent, defense is solid, and scoring ability is good.   SG- Ellis, Korver, THJ      Ellis very well might be the big Free agent signing for us. Some say he doesn't fit, but I think we can get him to work. Unleash him just enough. Korver is ideal off the bench IMO.   SF- Carroll, Thabo, Bazemore      Carroll is a must sign to me. He epitomizes this team and get better every year, every game, every week.   PF- Thompson, Scott.        This is the position that has the most mystery to me. I would love Aldridge here, but that looks unlikely. I want Millsap back, but money. Tristan Thompson would be a boost for rebounding, solid D and I'm sure we could work on his scoring. Scott is Someone i don't want to lose. His scoring off the bench is underrated, but inconsistent.   C- Horford, Moose, Edy       Horford has this in lock and its not even close."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Hot_Lanta,3,Tue Jun 30 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"If you replace Thompson with Millsap this would be such an amazing lineup. I'm a little iffy on Ellis but I think you're right that Korver is best of the bench, and Ellis can definitely score."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,GT2018,2,Tue Jun 30 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"That was my thinking too for Ellis and Korver. Hopefully we land Sap too, but who knows with how money works out"
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Hot_Lanta,3,Tue Jun 30 19:28:21 2015 UTC,I think Monta could work too and I don't see why Bud and Wilcox wouldn't aggressively go after him (its obvious at this point that we are not going to get Gasol or LMA).  The THJ trade shows that we are looking for guys that can create their own offense.  We desperately need that come playoff time.  If we get Monta and THJ to fit into the system of team ball and then unleash them when our offense goes cold then cage em back up when the rhythm starts flowing again.  It could be a difference maker.
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,nerdyintentions,2,Tue Jun 30 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"He wants to be here, and we need him here. He could do wonders if we can get him to play team ball 90% of the time and Hero ball that rare 10% we'll need him too"
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Hot_Lanta,2,Wed Jul 1 00:59:34 2015 UTC,Do you think we have a realistic chance of getting Thompson? I feel like the Cavs would not want to lose him
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,skba1995,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"My thoughts too. I know he's restricted, and he showed quite a lot in the playoffs this year. I think he's got too high of a ceiling for them to let him walk."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Hot_Lanta,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"The problem for them is paying what he wants. He thinks he worth max, and so does love. Between him, love and lebron. Thats alot of cap. Plus Delly, Shump, Jr and basically that entire roster. They might lose one"
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,jwn0323,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:58:01 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain we can't afford Ellis, Carroll, and Thompson. We definitely can't with Mike Scott still around. The money just doesn't add up. I could be wrong, but with Ellis and Carroll both set to make 10+ mil. Thompson going north of that as well. It just doesn't seem feasible."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Hot_Lanta,2,Wed Jul 1 01:46:44 2015 UTC,"I figured Ellis would be 9 ish. And Carrol around 10. And then.beyong that. Fuck it, the Nba cap confuses the hell out of me. Maybe a sign and trade than."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,jwn0323,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the NBA cap is pretty dumb. What hurts us is not having bird rights for Carroll or Millsap. It's going to be interesting to see how the Hawks dance around the cap this summer honestly."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Kushtavious,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no way to afford Thompson, Carroll, and Ellis. Carroll will get roughly 14-16 mil range. Might take a discount for Hawks but doubt it. Ellis just opted out of a contract that offered slightly over 9 mil. He will be looking and getting somewhere in the 12 mil range. Lastly, Thompson is loved by the Cavs. He and Lebron share the same agent and they are willing to spend over the cap to retain him. Thompson should get an offer of at least 15 mil. So all that together you are looking in the 40-45 mil range in contracts.  Hawks have roughly 25 mil to spend in free agency. The numbers just don't work. Sign and trades only realistically apply to max contract players and Hawks are not going to offer any of those 3 a max.  A more realistic line up would have 2 of those 3 in it."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,Hot_Lanta,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"Carroll is not a 14 million dollar player, and Ellis is around 10 to 11. Thats about 20 to 22 for both.   Hawks have said they will go over the salary cap, and a sign and trade is the way they would do it. Thompson is the perfect fit for that.   But that just my opinion. We'll see how things shake out"
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,jatl,3,Wed Jul 1 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"i'm thinking it's the same as last year, with a far stronger second unit."

AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,jwn0323,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"Teague, Korver, Bazemore, Millsap, and Horford is what I'd personally like to see. Adding in Ellis to come in and lead the second unit along with Dennis. Preferably with some frontline help off the bench. Not sure who makes sense there yet. I'm surprised the Hawks aren't looking into Brandan Wright. Would be a good fit."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,jalapenobusiness1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:49:23 2015 UTC,"True, gotta love Baze and he's still growing so much as a player. And then the thought of Dennis, Ellis, and Thabo in the second unit would give us unbelievable depth throughout the regular season."
AtlantaHawks,3bnkgy,mehjbmeh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"Teague, Ellis, DMC, Al and Brandon Wright (phx suns)"
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,andyarms23,4,Tue Jun 30 13:44:22 2015 UTC,"Under the radar guys I really like that can make our bench really good:  Brandan Wright, Marco Belinelli, Kosta Koufos, Al-Faouq Aminu, Jonas Jerebko, Alexis Ajinca, Gary Neal.  I especially like Jonas Jerebko. He's a 6'10 stretch 4. He has shot over 40% the past 2 season from 3 and over 80% from ft. I feel like he got lost in Detroit his entire career playing in a terrible system behind all those bigs they have there."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,chessbrah,5,Tue Jun 30 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"Demarre.   With Horford, Millsap, Demarre, Korver, Teague, Schroder, Thabo, Scott, Mack, Bazemore, Muscala and THJ we have 12 roster spots. I can see us cutting Daye as his contract isn't guaranteed (I believe). I also don't think we resign Brand. I could see us bringing Edy and Lamar over. This would put us up to 14 players with one spot left. With that spot I could see us trying to sign someone like Alexis Ajinca or Bismack Biyombo. It's not flashy, but I think it's solid.  To add some splash, I could see the Hawks packaging Mack, Scott and Daye (for salary matching) along with next year's MIN 1st for someone."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,Bankingitbig,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"You realize Millsap is a free agent, right? Your post makes it look like he's under contract."

AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,abesrevenge,6,Tue Jun 30 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard officially that he won't be coming over. His buyout isn't that expensive. I know it is ideal for the Hawks to sign him with cap space to have his rights for another year (hawksfanatic did a good write up of this). So, I am not an expert and not exactly sure if the Hawks would have room after signing Millsap and Demarre."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,Bankingitbig,3,Tue Jun 30 16:22:09 2015 UTC,Get ready for a Jared Dudley type.
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,BeautifulMohammad,3,Tue Jun 30 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"LMA not visiting us is a bummer but expected. I really don't think we'll get a big time free agent, our moves will probably be through trades."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,playalisticadillac,0,Tue Jun 30 15:32:17 2015 UTC,Which sucks because I thought our success this past year would make a little bit more desirable FA location. Guess I should've known better.
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,Korver360windmill,-3,Tue Jun 30 17:24:42 2015 UTC,The fact that we struggled to fill the arena during the ECF probably isn't a huge draw.

AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,tocohills,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:19:28 2015 UTC,"Millsap and maybe a defensive wing or Monta Ellis. I know we like to write off Ellis, but we were looking at him two years ago and rumors have started again of our interest. So, there has to be something to the rumors, even if it's a passing interest.  Edit: As far as Sap goes, I feel the fact that we're not talking to LMA (after being rumored in his top 5) might speak to us feeling good about bringing back Millsap."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,cosmo_bear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"I still want to believe that we're going to pursue Gasol. I think that the front office is beginning to show its intent now that Pero's (unofficially) gone and that THJ was added for 2.3 million. I think we deal out Mike Scott and Shelvin for cap space, don't re-sign DeMarre or Millsap, and try really hard to sign Marc. This is 30% what I think is going to happen and 70% what I want to happen.   Edit: Also want to add that Elton Brand is most likely retiring, and Daye is most likely not getting re-signed."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,DankVoid,5,Tue Jun 30 15:12:39 2015 UTC,"Gasol is not leaving Memphis. DC is going to walk, I just don't think they are going to match any offer he gets. We just need to replace Carroll in FA and it is not going to be a top tier guy. . Omar Asik is someone that I have liked for awhile now but Bud might not want a true tank that can't move very well. Still if you can get Asik on a mid-level 3 year deal you fill some holes that DC leaves and you get bigger and stronger in the middle."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,abesrevenge,2,Tue Jun 30 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I just like imagining what could be with Gasol on this team. If DC does go (and I think he will, he completely deserves to get paid) then I am fairly content with (healthy) Thabo at the 3.   While watching Mozgov in the ECFs and Finals, all I could think to myself was ""Damn, why can't we get a big guy like that?"""
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,DankVoid,0,Tue Jun 30 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"So I'm sitting here browsing with the Russillo Show on and Danny Kannell and Rusillo wax eloquent for about 5 minutes on how D-Wade is a role player these days and how he needs to go somewhere where he can fit.  I'm just putting this out there, I know he's older, but say the Hawks sign him to a two year deal and snag Millsap as well?  Just floating this spur of the moment."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,PiKappaFratta,2,Tue Jun 30 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think people realize that D Wade is still playing at an all-star level.  There are obvious knocks to him:  He's old and has zero chance of lasting anywhere close to a full 82-game season.  He'd also be expensive.  That being said, he's still a star player.  He's got that old-man game."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,broeho,0,Tue Jun 30 21:46:51 2015 UTC,"I'd take him on a cheap deal, though I doubt he'll take much of a pay cut. He could take it easy all season for us then light it up in the playoffs. I'd love that."
AtlantaHawks,3bmpr6,playalisticadillac,0,Tue Jun 30 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"It would have to be very cheap. He's 33 with knee problems. Also, let's not forget that Millsap's 30 and suffered that shoulder injury at the end of this past season."

AtlantaHawks,3boihc,BourbonismyCoke,6,Tue Jun 30 21:32:16 2015 UTC,Slim to none. Edy has his entire family living overseas and doesn't want to leave them. On top of that Fenerbahce and Madrid are interested in him and he has expressed a desire to stay in the Euroleague. Thats why he told the Hawks he's not reporting for summer league.
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,callmerevan,-2,Tue Jun 30 21:39:15 2015 UTC,It drives me crazy this guy has so much talent and so little drive.
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,mehjbmeh,7,Tue Jun 30 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't understand him. Does he not want to play in the best basketball league in the world? Maybe he's afraid he won't play, but I think the earlier he gets over here the quicker he'll get more minutes."
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,DankVoid,-3,Tue Jun 30 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"That's some ass backwards thinking. If you could make a great living in a place you consider home and be an integral piece to your company, would you leave to make less money and be less important to another organization?"
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,justcamp,2,Wed Jul 1 00:13:48 2015 UTC,why did he submit his name for the NBA draft?
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,broeho,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:20:39 2015 UTC,To have options. Things also change over the course of a year. Tavares wasn't a highly sought after FA in his league when he declared.
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,justcamp,0,Wed Jul 1 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"it's more like ""if you could make a decent amount of money in a minor league near home or make a decent amount of money in a pro league away from home which would you pick?"""
AtlantaHawks,3boihc,mehjbmeh,5,Wed Jul 1 00:15:57 2015 UTC,"He can undoubtedly make more money in the short term there and he is a fucking star in his league right now. He will never be an NBA star.  In a profession where your earning window is so short and unpredictable, I can't begrudge anyone for taking the fast cash or putting their family over the pride one gains from playing in the best league in the world. Fans are fucking weird in thinking players should share their priorities."

AtlantaHawks,3bo255,Jangorox79,4,Tue Jun 30 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. While the salary cap will go up, I think players are more interested in long-term deals that are guaranteed money. Career ending injuries are rare, but have to be considered."
AtlantaHawks,3bo255,cosmo_bear,3,Tue Jun 30 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"Just as unlikely that we will be able to sign them to a normal 4 year contract. The top free agents (LMA, Gasol, Love) will get to dictate the contract they want and any team will give it to them. We just won't be selected, as they will sign elsewhere."
AtlantaHawks,3bo255,Bankingitbig,0,Tue Jun 30 19:41:20 2015 UTC,"I totally understand the injury worry and the want for guaranteed money.  The more I think about it seems like this would be more of an option for the younger guys (Draymond Green, DeAndre Jordan) than the older. Both Gasol and Aldridge will be 30 in 2016. I'd be wary about offering them max deals that more than likely would take them to the end of their careers. It just seemed like something I'd pitch if it was down to us or staying with their current teams. Ressler keeps saying we won't be afraid to spend money although it's probably in reference to the guys already here."
AtlantaHawks,3bo255,Bankingitbig,2,Tue Jun 30 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"No I totally agree with you. In fact, I think DeAndre Jordan has already said he wants only a 3 year deal to take advantage of the increasing cap. I won't be surprised to see LeBron sign only a 1 year deal to take advantage of the rising cap. But my point is.. These top FAs will get to dictate the contract they want and any team will give it to them. They just won't choose the Hawks."
AtlantaHawks,3bmu07,mjridiculouz,6,Tue Jun 30 14:19:30 2015 UTC,Undersized but he is great at steals and definitely isn't a slouch at defense.
AtlantaHawks,3bmu07,bearg0d,4,Tue Jun 30 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"He was 9th in defensive rating this year at 99.2, better than Marc Gasol and tied with Nerlens. He has limitations, but he plays to his strengths which are length, vision, and solid base of strength. Good rebounder for his size, unfortunately our whole team sucked at rebounding. Putting him next to Vucci and I believe he would flourish and have a great season because they compliment each other well. Vuc inside presence and rebs, Millsap stretch 4 and vision for steals.  One thing though is that I believe Horfords good speed (for a center) really helped Paul because he could defend further out knowing Al had the speed to rotate quick enough. For sure Vucivic is stronger and bigger than Horford, but Paul would have to adapt to that if he came to Orlando. Fortunately he's played with Al Jefferson, so he has some experience with that."
AtlantaHawks,3bmu07,fuzzyllama1,3,Tue Jun 30 15:59:36 2015 UTC,One of the best in the league
AtlantaHawks,3bmu07,meep6969,3,Tue Jun 30 14:34:14 2015 UTC,"Don't let the Cleveland series fool you. While he definitely struggled against LeBron, it's LeBron. I personally think he's more of an awkward offensive player, although he does get the job done. It just seems like he's always tripping over himself when he drives to the lane. I definitely want him back in Atlanta."
AtlantaHawks,3bmu07,DankVoid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"Very good defender currently. The issue is he is undersized so he relies on quickness to get the job done. He is quite quick compared to other PFs he just doesn't look it. My main concern is he is 30 so if he loses a step in the coming years he won't have size to fall back on which could become an issue.   Even so, I want him to resign very badly. He is an incredibly important cog."
AtlantaHawks,3bmu07,Raydioactive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. Great hands, great positioning, good quickness. Undersized, but strong."
AtlantaHawks,3bmmai,Cleebot,4,Tue Jun 30 13:12:19 2015 UTC,"Good defensive player. His offense is more bad than his defense is good. Perhaps worth a look if he's cheap, but probably not a good system fit."
AtlantaHawks,3bmmai,pln1991,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:02:57 2015 UTC,"He could be a phenomenal bench player for us. His offense is terrible, but who knows. Him and Thabo could form an absolutely absurdly stifiling second unit."
AtlantaHawks,3bmmai,fireglz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm thinking too. If we can get him for one those cheap 2 year contracts that we gave to DMC and Millsap, I think it would be crazy good for our second unit. Plus, the dude's only 22!"

AtlantaHawks,3blbil,cosmo_bear,10,Tue Jun 30 03:44:28 2015 UTC,I welcome Millsap being a Hawk for a few more years. Maybe next year we'll actually keep a draft pick to be his eventual replacement
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,thrashfan,2,Tue Jun 30 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"Millsap stays, Demarre is leaving, which means we pick up a big name FA or 2 decent ones"
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,meep6969,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"Well, not a really big name. Millsap will probably get at least $15 mill/year (at least). So, what? We won't have more than $10 mill or so to spend."
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,meep6969,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:16:58 2015 UTC,Decent FA then? Whoever that would be
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,abesrevenge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:49:25 2015 UTC,Tobias Harris to replace DC? We wouldn't be looking at top end FA's but I feel he could help us get physical and bring a little bit of the junkyard fight we lose with DC.
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,thrashfan,2,Tue Jun 30 06:43:18 2015 UTC,TH will command as much if not more than DC
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,Bankingitbig,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:28:08 2015 UTC,"Stuff I'm reading says $9-10 mill for Harris. So, about the same."
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,Raydioactive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:37:44 2015 UTC,"Was reading that Celtics and Pistons will offer him the max, which would be $16M."
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,Abiv23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? I mean, he's good, but not that good."
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,Raydioactive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:17:06 2015 UTC,The idea is he is young and will hopefully continue developing. I'm not convinced his shot will get there though. Seems like a big gamble
AtlantaHawks,3blbil,abesrevenge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"His shot is why he's a good player, 46% fg 36% 3pt"

AtlantaHawks,3blbil,abesrevenge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:03:58 2015 UTC,apparently the Celtics are offering the max deal to just about everyone if what I keep reading is to be believed.

AtlantaHawks,3blbil,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:59:30 2015 UTC,I was thinking 9-10 mil for Harris and DC is going for around the 12 mil range. That could all go up though.

AtlantaHawks,3bjzl1,WrongTetrisBlock,9,Mon Jun 29 21:52:23 2015 UTC,I cant remember what game it was but it was toward the end of the year and he hit like three threes and we lost our shit.

AtlantaHawks,3bjzl1,JerryLangford,6,Mon Jun 29 22:45:21 2015 UTC,Probably better overall for the team that he is gone. He was a good defender but his offensive game has been really bad since the end of last season. Still he played a good role for us and I think he was a good locker room guy to have.

LMA has a better ""killer"" instinct than anyone on the Hawks. Also, Marc Gasol would be a great addition (but would hurt our spacing somewhat).  Also, Millsap and Carroll will be signing 4 year deals. No way at their age do they take a 3 year deal."
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,Bankingitbig,2,Mon Jun 29 21:15:04 2015 UTC,LMA has a better killer instinct? What are you basing this off of?
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,Capn_Barboza,7,Mon Jun 29 22:03:02 2015 UTC,Both of you made baseless claims and you expect him to explain himself?
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,justcamp,-2,Mon Jun 29 22:05:50 2015 UTC,I just figured most people who follow the NBA know of the Trailblazers woes in the playoffs... Even though they've had a pretty deep roster over their years.
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,Capn_Barboza,3,Mon Jun 29 22:10:58 2015 UTC,"Bruh, have you even seen the West?"
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,justcamp,2,Mon Jun 29 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"LMA straight beasted in the 2013 playoffs, he averaged 26/10"
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,killjoyous,3,Tue Jun 30 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"LMA's playoff stats compared to regular season increase a bit more than Horford's/Millsap's. Also, LMA has the ability to create for himself more than Millsap and Horford do."

AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,stdfan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:04:43 2015 UTC,"Im just trying to keep us from running into another JJ issue. You give max money to a guy and chances are he'll be a let down. LMA hasn't done much of anything playoffs wise in his career... Why would that change here?   Same with Klove. Yes they have their statistical advantages over Milsap, but Milsap will come much cheaper and play as good of or better D then those two.   I'd love to get Gasol but he's not leaving grind city.   Kawhi and Jimmy are UFA's so they'll get matched.   I guess winning 60 games and making it to the ECF means we should blow up our roster?"
AtlantaHawks,3bj1zy,Capn_Barboza,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:09:06 2015 UTC,Kevin Love never played on a team worth a shit until this year and got hurt early so that argument is invalid. Aldridge averages 21 and 9 in the playoffs. Milsap averages 11.9 and 7 a game so that argument is invalid.  Milsap wasn't that good in the playoffs he is 100% replaceable.

AtlantaHawks,3bj3sm,BeautifulMohammad,5,Tue Jun 30 04:35:45 2015 UTC,There are people upset by that? How is it at all surprising that an organization in Atlanta focused on 18-35 year olds supports that decision? I don't understand people sometimes
AtlantaHawks,3bj3sm,childishdorito12,5,Mon Jun 29 18:54:51 2015 UTC,Yeah check out some of the replies on the tweets. I doubt that most of the people are big Hawks fans so much as they just want to rage against anything that goes against their opinions and threatening to not give the organization money makes them feel like they have some power or righteousness.   Would be a good opportunity for the guy who runs the account to troll crazies and give normal people a laugh but we live in an age where you can be fired for using the wrong emojis.

AtlantaHawks,3bgxxz,sparlivdor365,3,Mon Jun 29 18:08:44 2015 UTC,The blue/grey one looks damn fine. The red one might take some time to get used to but it's nothing too atrocious.

AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,HawksInTheBay,5,Mon Jun 29 02:33:50 2015 UTC,Golden State has an amazing FO because every players structured contract allows for all of them to come back next year and any offer on Green will be matched. This is just a ploy to get a few offers on the table and drove his price up.
AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,abesrevenge,11,Mon Jun 29 03:28:15 2015 UTC,I doubt that GS wouldn't match any offer from any team at this point.
AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,ATLjoe93,3,Mon Jun 29 02:37:23 2015 UTC,No shit. He can play 3-5 and is a young guy with all-star potential.
AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,justcamp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"He made it pretty clear this year that he can thrive as a system player, so I don't doubt him fitting in here.

Also now's a good of a time as any to say this... the guy totally looks like a combination of Brandon Bass and Welvin Da Great."

AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:49:18 2015 UTC,I hope somebody offers him a ton of cash early in free agency just so golden state has to accept it fast or let him walk and try and replace him. Hopefully somebody offers him 15 million which he accepts and then the Warriors must match it which would then take up their entire cap space and even make them go over the cap room they have (about 11 million)
AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:37:10 2015 UTC,Would we offer him? yuUup. Would GS let him leave? noOope.
AtlantaHawks,3bgtlo,GT2018,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:41:16 2015 UTC,I think he's just enjoying being this wanted for the first time in his career. Love to have him but doubt he's going to leave the Champs since they can match.
AtlantaHawks,3bed2b,PoetJustice,5,Sun Jun 28 13:02:22 2015 UTC,"Opinions on a Millsap for Favors swap?   I really like it, every formee player we've gotten from the Jazz has turned out to be nothing but a bona-fide stud as of late. I feel like Favors is something special, he's only 23, has played in the league for years and remains on nuclear alert for breaking out but just hasn't yet for whatever reason. Despite this, he's the 18-10 points-rebound guy that would definitely give us a massive pressence on the inside."
AtlantaHawks,3bed2b,besaid_jim,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:51:46 2015 UTC,I'd be for it as long as it was certain that Gasol or Aldridge weren't coming.
AtlantaHawks,3bed2b,BeautifulMohammad,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:48:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind that swap. Doesn't have the range of Millsap but he has an ok 15 footer. He will be locked up for 3 years at 12 million which may be less than Millsap gets.
AtlantaHawks,3bed2b,bearg0d,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:19:05 2015 UTC,I would love this but doubt the jazz do it.

AtlantaHawks,3ba5el,justcamp,3,Sat Jun 27 14:35:37 2015 UTC,haha perhaps if there is another one. Pretty sure this is only the second.
AtlantaHawks,3ba5el,thrashfan,6,Sat Jun 27 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"That's definitely what we are hoping for. Our coaching staff has done a good job coaxing better defense out of people. Hopefully he can learn to play D, I don't think scoring will be a problem. He will be able to fit a certain role and get comfortable within it. He isn't ready for top dog status yet, but I think that potential you are talking about is what Bud and the rest of the staff see in him too. It was a risky move for us, hopefully it works out"
AtlantaHawks,3ba5el,jolley517,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:12:57 2015 UTC,Listening to interviews with our new GM and with Bud they were beyond excited when they got the offer.

AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,HCE1132,2,Sat Jun 27 11:02:48 2015 UTC,"THJ is likely to impress a bunch of you guys because the Knicks are a bad, toxic team that makes players worse, and Atlanta is a team that is actively making players better. Korver, Millsap, and DMC have all outperformed themselves because the system we run makes them better players. We have a good idea of what we'll get out of him, moreso than a draft pick. I think our focus is going to be getting some free agents and making another deep playoff run rather than teach rookies basics of being in the NBA. Hopefully it works out for us."
AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,kraken-on-standby,5,Mon Jun 29 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree with him more, Hardaway will transform into a valuable asset. We just have to believe in Bud, this guy has proven he can turn a mediocre player into a star. He's proven it in the past 2 years, have faith yall"
AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,meep6969,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:12:19 2015 UTC,"This is true, but sometimes you have to take the risk and go with the draft pick. What if the Warriors traded Steph Curry for some already 'established' player in the league?"
AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,atomsej,5,Sat Jun 27 17:55:56 2015 UTC,"Steph Curry was a lottery pick. There's a BIG gap between the lottery picks and the rest in terms of not only if they'll bust but when the good ones will actually be able to help the team, Atlanta is very much in Win Now mode and can't wait on a 15th pick to develop."
AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,mehjbmeh,3,Sun Jun 28 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"We were literally 1 pick away from a lottery pick though, but I feel you on the 'win now' part. However at the same time why would we want 2 future 2nd round picks if we were in 'win now' mode, and THJ isn't necessarily the most 'established SG there is"
AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,atomsej,3,Sun Jun 28 02:49:13 2015 UTC,because THJ is MUCH cheaper than a 1st rounder this year is and his contract allows plenty of control by the team and the 2nd rounders can be stashed in foreign leagues to give Atlanta even more Cap savings.  THJ is roughly 40% about having a rotation shooter and 60% about saving money for FA.
AtlantaHawks,3b9ypf,mehjbmeh,0,Sun Jun 28 15:57:56 2015 UTC,HARD-ON FOR HARDAWAY
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,Jewtheist,15,Fri Jun 26 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure why everyone hates this trade. We got the second best player on an NBA team for a pick we very well could have not used. Hardaway is 23 and imo has more potential than oubre & can also also make an immediate impact. People see what bud did with Demarre, and I'm willing to bet he does even better with hardaway."
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,Tomahawkchop14,5,Fri Jun 26 17:19:22 2015 UTC,Are you really repping this trade because we got the second best player from the Knicks?  We could have gotten the best player from more than 300 college teams.  I would have taken Anderson at #19 and been happy.
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,TrocarSlushWeasel,5,Fri Jun 26 20:07:02 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you here. The guy the Knicks picked up isn't that much younger than Timmy Jr. anyway. (7 months I think.)  Why not take a safer investment that has proven NBA ability. I look and see what Bud and staff has done for players like Carroll, Moose, BazeGod, and even making Thabo more consistent from deep. (Not 100% sure on this, but he was around 40% before he went down in Feb.)"
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,LAXlittleant26,5,Fri Jun 26 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like hawks fans are not seeing the bigger picture here.  Hardaway is cheaper than the pick, and he is good enough to be a rotation player game 1.  If you trade another rotation player you will have the money to be able to resign both DeMarre and Millsap."
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,loosemoose9,2,Fri Jun 26 20:26:04 2015 UTC,Hardaway and Schroeder should be really fun to watch off the bench as long as their defense can hold up.
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:44:58 2015 UTC,The best part: they are 23 & 21. Bright future in ATL.
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,Tomahawkchop14,4,Sat Jun 27 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I appreciate the time you took to write this and I agree with you. I think THJ will make more of an impact than any rookie could have at that spot, which is what you want when you just made the ECF. But how he performs 5 years from now, who knows.."
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,Bankingitbig,3,Fri Jun 26 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly worried that I'll have to watch the Hawks prove that an over abundance of 3 point shooting doesn't translate to playoff success for the next few years. The Nets series was a joke. We barely beat out the Wizards who had their own injury problems. The Cavaliers destroyed us and they only had Kyrie for two games.   I can deal with that but atleast give me the hope that the rookie, that we got to draft by fleecing Brooklyn, will turn into a good player that we will still have after this iteration of the Hawks is done. Instead I have to hope that a player who doesn't posses an NBA skill other than being ok at shooting 3s will somehow put us over the top against a presumably healthy Cleveland."
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,BeautifulMohammad,2,Fri Jun 26 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"As far as your first point... I think the Warriors proved that not to be an issue. We just severely underperformed in the playoffs especially when comparing our shooting results of the regular season. For the Cavs series we were also quite hobbled.  That said, my biggest concern with THJ is his defense. On offense I could see THJ being similar to Carroll, but not on defense. Not to mention Thabo's situation and what his recovery will be like.   I loved our move to go from 15 to 19 for 2 2nd rd picks with so many options still on the board... disappointed with the outcome from there though. I'm hoping Bud and co. prove me wrong!"
AtlantaHawks,3b7jfw,aussiemac24,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:21:52 2015 UTC,The Warriors had tons of versatility unlike the Hawks.

As you said, he's not very dynamic, and he's not a shooter like our current mold is, but he's a great passer from down low and a good finisher (eye test; stats may disagree), so he's still useful offensively. The big thing for me that I need to check is his rebounding. If he's a solid rebounder, I'm all for picking him up. The Spurs are likely going to have to part ways with him to pick up LMA, and I think he'd be a great fit."
AtlantaHawks,3b8cu1,davidsreddittag,2,Fri Jun 26 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"I know this thread is old, but he is a solid rebounder. A big difference between the 2011 first round series of SA vs Memphis and 2013 WCF of SA vs Memphis was Splitter was playing 30mins/game in 2013 compared to 30 mins total in the 2011 series.  Z-Bo and Gasol shat on SA in 2011 because Duncan was hurt and Antonio Mcdyess was our second best big. 2013 Splitter frustrated and out-hustled Z-Bo/Marc. He also plays great defense on stretch 4s like Dirk and LMA. He single handedly won game 1 of the first round in 2014 against Dallas. Shut down Dirk and was one of the few players that could make a shot.   He'll probably play great against someone like K. Love."
AtlantaHawks,3b8cu1,Golai77,2,Wed Jul 1 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"Tiago is the exact type of player the Hawks need to add some versatility in the playoffs but I don't think he would give you enough bang for his buck, especially when it is him or Millsap. I don't know if the Hawks can come up with a better 4/5 than Millsap/Horford. They need to catch a break and find an affordable BIG man that can give 20 minutes a night. Maybe Tavares can come over and become that guy for us."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,Crcsoccer1,22,Fri Jun 26 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"If you ask me, I think LMA to the Spurs is a foregone conclusion.  Pulling Gasol away from the Griz'll be tough, but nabbing him, moving Boss to the 4, letting Paul go and resigning Junkyard is my personal dream scenario."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,poerhouse,3,Fri Jun 26 15:00:22 2015 UTC,If the Spurs have the cap space for LA. I think they have to get rid of Splitter to do it.

AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,brafalawk692,13,Fri Jun 26 17:55:59 2015 UTC,I really like LaMarcus... Imagine him and and Horford as our big men. Solid post presence while still staying true to Bud's system of spreading the floor.
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,fuzzyllama1,5,Fri Jun 26 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"Didn't LMA start shooting from 3 when he was open this year too? He'd be great offensively, but we'd lose a bit defensively without Millsap. It'd be nice to have a go to scorer though. I think it would work out well."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,TheSequel88,3,Fri Jun 26 15:51:54 2015 UTC,We would need to teach him the passing that we have working in ATL I think
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,pln1991,8,Fri Jun 26 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"I want Gasol. If not him, Aldridge. If not him, Millsap."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,jknox94,7,Fri Jun 26 14:28:58 2015 UTC,"Dream scenario? Sign LMA and Demarre, let Paul walk. I think LMA and Horford as a duo can alleviate our lack of big man pains, and I've always just been a big Aldridge fan. Of course the easiest solution to our big man problem is Gasol, so I'd be happy with that too. If either of those are too good to be true, I think we can realistically find an effective rebounder/post scorer for cheap. Either way, I think we need to let Millsap go. I'm losing confidence that we can win a championship with Horford as our only big man, and I don't think Millsap would be open to coming off the bench to let another player start."

AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,LAXlittleant26,3,Fri Jun 26 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, we'd bring Paul off the bench as a sixth man, and keep the offensive pressure on teams.  However, I really think next year Moose will break out. He showed signs in the Wiz series when given a chance."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,reb_mccuster,2,Fri Jun 26 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"maybe we can sign LMA and afford to keep Paul without making him take too large of a discount?  idk, I would just hate to fuck over Paul in any way after the season he just gave us."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,justcamp,3,Fri Jun 26 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"Paul is getting 14-16mil. LMA is not signing for the 10-12mil left over. Plus, Paul is an all-star. Dude deserves to get paid for what he brought to the team the past two seasons."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,LAXlittleant26,0,Fri Jun 26 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"In that scenario I see us losing Carroll. However, having Thabo and Timmy Jr. we still have serviceable wing defenders who can play well in our offense. We would also have Mike Scott who we could play at the 3 as well with our second unit. Which would give us a lot of size and floor spreading similar to our first unit."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,fatboyslimbz,3,Fri Jun 26 17:34:05 2015 UTC,Timmy Jr. is a sub par defender.

AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,DBac7812,3,Fri Jun 26 18:18:38 2015 UTC,Aminu would be a signing that fits our MO. Good size and good defender at either forward spot. Played really well for Dallas in the playoffs.
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,Shade_Raven,2,Sat Jun 27 00:31:01 2015 UTC,I think we should let Paul go

AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,jknox94,0,Fri Jun 26 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"Let Paul walk automatically. If Demarre will settle for less than 10 million then I keep him.  If both leave my replacements are- Danny green, Gasol, Aldridge, Love, Monroe, draymond, Dunleavey, Thompson, Chandler. If they can get 3 of these guys for 25 million then they would have an awesome free agency."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,fuckinkangaroos,3,Fri Jun 26 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"Chandler really is an interesting under the radar free agent, I'm surprised more people aren't talking about him. I think while we all dream about Aldridge or Gasol, Chandler is a very realistic solution. He's still kind of expensive, but there's gonna be a lot less teams courting him than those bigger names. Less teams, less competition, less money."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,StoopidFlexin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm really hoping that if they don't get Gasol then they move to a new solution of Tyson Chandler, demmarre, Monroe.

AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,Jonnychestnuts,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:35:17 2015 UTC,Tyson is extremely limited offensively and completely counter to Bud's five shooters on court at all times strategy.
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,tharoosta,2,Fri Jun 26 18:44:59 2015 UTC,Thompson is gonna want max.
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,BeautifulMohammad,2,Fri Jun 26 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"Demarre won't settle for less than 10 mil and I don't blame him. I'd rather sign an Aldridge if at all possible. I don't think Gasol will leave Memphis and frankly I consider Horford a center and not a pf at this point in his career. If we could sign Aldridge and add some additional bench depth I would go for trying to resign Demarre even if it takes us over the cap. Now that all depends on what the new ownership is willing to spend. I would still be shocked if we went that direction, as the organization has prided itself of keeping itself nimble and flexible when it comes to contracts."
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,StoopidFlexin,2,Fri Jun 26 14:57:28 2015 UTC,Sign and trade Millsap for Cousins.
AtlantaHawks,3b70ws,DEaster89,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:44:34 2015 UTC,If Cousins is seriously up for grabs then Teague and Horford would be a reasonable trade. Both of those guys are due for a pay raise soon and will be paid exactly what they are worth or possibly more than while Cousins will be making less than he is worth.

AtlantaHawks,3b816k,nerdyintentions,5,Fri Jun 26 19:20:33 2015 UTC,My initial reactions:  Paul Millsap signing: He's an upgrade over Josh Smith.  DeMarre Carroll signing: Who?  Bazemore signing: Who?
AtlantaHawks,3b816k,rjdab,2,Fri Jun 26 20:25:16 2015 UTC,Same for me. I wasn't too happy about the Carrol signing but he has developed into my favorite player. I feel with the Hardaway Jr trade some people are upset but I trust Bud. There's a reason he works in the NBA and I'm a mechanic I'll trust he knows what he's doing.
AtlantaHawks,3b816k,Human_highlight,4,Sat Jun 27 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"The /r/AtlantaHawks reactions would be interesting to see too. As I recall, literally every free agent Ferry added to this team was considered a disappointment or a ""consolation prize"" for a lot of fans at the time.

Korver was a ""massive overpay,"" Sefolosha was ""not Melo,"" Bazemore was ""not Deng,"" etc. Funny how it all worked out."
AtlantaHawks,3b816k,aghaud,6,Fri Jun 26 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"Millsap Reaction  ""DeMarre Reaction"" lol  Here's a preseason thoughts thread from before this season.  Basically Millsap we knew he was good in Utah, but didn't know how he would fit with Horford, DeMarre we had no clue who the dude was, Bazemore we were like ""ahh cool the dude with the bench reactions from Golden State Dennis will be happy"".   Also, these signings were way before the sub blew up, so we had like ~1000 subs or something like that, so not many opinions, just /u/buteo_jamaicensis ranting by himself lmao."

AtlantaHawks,3b816k,Dragic-Bronson,2,Fri Jun 26 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"I was pretty optimistic about DeMarre for a guy that cost 2.5 mill. I didn't know he existed before we signed him but then I consumed pretty much every word that was written about him. ESPN had a good write up on his player page that basically talked about his defense, effort and him becoming more rangy over time. I figured we may have got a burgeoning discount 3 and D guy and was glad we finally had a legit SF.   Paul Millsap was a steal.  I felt similar to Bazemore as the more optimistic Hawks fans are feeling about Hardaway because we didn't waste a 1st round pick on him."
AtlantaHawks,3b816k,BeautifulMohammad,2,Fri Jun 26 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"I had never seen a minute of DeMarre Carroll before he was signed, but the immediate reaction on the AJC Hawks blog was that he was a better player than Marvin Williams, whom Tyrone Corbin apparently wanted on the Jazz.  With Millsap, you knew you were getting an extremely crafty offensive player on a cheap deal who was likely to make better decisions with the ball than Josh Smith. I had no idea he would be this good defensively, despite being an undersized power forward at 6-6. And of course, nobody knew he would emerge as a 3-point shooter."

AtlantaHawks,3b8rg4,cripplercrawlspace,2,Fri Jun 26 22:55:10 2015 UTC,We have known since pretty much this time last year. Since we introduced the new Pac logo in the 2014 Playoffs there were rumblings. In the summer Hawks execs spoke with the media about there being a rebrand possibility. So during the year anyone who followed the team was certain of new jerseys. And when the Xmas unis leaked a couple months ago we got a solid idea of what they would look like.

AtlantaHawks,3b82yb,ATL_GritzBlitz,4,Fri Jun 26 21:32:56 2015 UTC,People are stuck on Oubre who we chose for the Wizards but there were a few interesting options at number 15. I think if they really wanted Hardaway he or a comparable player could have been had at way less of a cost than a 1st round pick. It will probably be awhile before we get a pick better than the 25 range.
AtlantaHawks,3b82yb,BeautifulMohammad,4,Fri Jun 26 20:06:26 2015 UTC,"It was a good move to obtain someone who has proven that he can play in the NBA.

AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,mehjbmeh,15,Fri Jun 26 04:51:49 2015 UTC,Yeah it's pretty funny watching people declaring who won this trade when Oubre hasn't even played in a nba game yet. We definitely put too much value on mid first round lottery picks.
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,bearg0d,3,Fri Jun 26 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"What has happened to our other Euro stash players that we have drafted seemingly every year now in the late 2nd round? Has any really panned out? The old ""two years away from being two years away"" guys?"
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,abesrevenge,5,Fri Jun 26 06:57:38 2015 UTC,"I really believe Coach Bud isn't in the business of developing rookies into professional athletes, especially since Hawks appear to be in  ""win-now"" mode. He did say that there were players he would have taken at 15 but it was probably a short list he felt worthy to roll the dice on. No team has the draft down to a science because it's close to impossible to accurately forecast players' futures, especially the mid-round talents.  Drafting Euro players allows us to save that cap-space/roster-slot for known NBA players while monitoring their professional progress at no cost to the organization. Their draft rights are also tradable assets. We do have a scout who lives in Spain who assumedly keeps track of our players and reports on prospects. 7'3 Edy Tavares is almost definitely being brought over this year to replace Elton, the rest we will continue to wait and see."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,Decatur_Psalm,6,Fri Jun 26 07:25:01 2015 UTC,"im giving it till tavares this year. i think he could actually be decent. if not i'm just gonna call our drafting horrible, because missing with nogueira and payne in consecutive years is kinda wack."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,thrashfan,6,Fri Jun 26 07:03:45 2015 UTC,Moose worked out pretty well.
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,MovingToSeattleSoon,3,Fri Jun 26 09:23:25 2015 UTC,Moose is from Minnesota and played college ball at Bucknell
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,thrashfan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"Moose was a 4 year player from Bucknell who the Hawks had a first round grade on and even he wasn't brought in immediately.  ""Atlanta had Muscala firmly in the first round, and made a few attempts to move up, to no avail. Muscala kept sliding, and as the No. 44 pick approached, the Hawks' draft room became giddy when he was still on the board after Ricky Ledo was announced at No. 43.  With no roster spot for him in Atlanta, Muscala started the 2013-14 season in Spain. But after Horford's season-ending torn pec and Gustavo Ayon's shoulder injury, Ferry brought him over just after the All-Star Break. A skilled, sweet-shooting big man who can rebound, Muscala has impressed in his first full season in Atlanta, posting a true shooting percentage of 60.8 percent.""  http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/_/id/12888054/how-atlanta-hawks-built-winner"
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,abesrevenge,2,Fri Jun 26 15:09:01 2015 UTC,Im well aware of Moose's history. The fact remains that we stashed him in Europe for a year.
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,dillpickles007,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:13:40 2015 UTC,The exact opposite of what I am talking about.
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,Crcsoccer1,5,Fri Jun 26 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"I frankly don't like the trade.  I'd rather have Dekker/Hunter/Oubre if we wanted to grab a wing.  At 29 I might've been ok with it but it kind of feels like we wasted the gift that was the 15th pick.    But as you say 'in Bud we trust'.  I don't think anyone we could have picked at 15 would have played much of a role next season, so hopefully we have a plan heading into free agency to use the little bit of extra cash this freed up."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,daeve,2,Fri Jun 26 05:14:57 2015 UTC,I honestly think we could have won the draft with portis at #19
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,aghaud,2,Fri Jun 26 13:59:11 2015 UTC,"I wanted Rondae, or would've been fine with Anderson or Grant. Hell even Portis. I'm going to trust Hardaway is secretly bff with Marc Gasol and thats why this happened"
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,TrocarSlushWeasel,2,Fri Jun 26 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"One other point to consider: The fact that we'll have both Hardaway and Bazemore at the backup SG spot means that Coach Bud will be able to pick matchups in a way that optimizes both of them. If the opposing team's backup SG is strong, we'll be able to put Bazemore on him and shut him down defensively. If the opposing backup SG is weak, we'll be able to send out Hardaway and rack up extra points. Being able to choose between Bazemore and Hardaway depending on the situation will probably make both of them much more valuable than they would be on their own."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,fireglz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:26:01 2015 UTC,"I would have preferred Anderson at #19 to Hardaway.  They'll have similar salaries, I think, if this was a salary dump to get more room to resign Carroll/Millsap."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,DBac7812,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"It feels like Mike Scott has fallen out of favor with the team as the go to bench sparkplug. He lost all of his minutes during the playoff's and I'm not so sure that it's exclusively due to the back injury.   Honestly, If you look at what Mike Scott gave us last year (a decent conversion rate of open look 3's )  ( some hype inducing dunks.) and contrast it with what we're getting with Hardaway Jr.  ( A slightly better  3 point shooter) ( A more consistent ability to convert at the rim )  ...and I think it's a great fit. I know they're not the same position, but as far as what they're capable of providing the team, I think Hardaway Jr. is probably an upgrade. Offense used to stop with Mike Scott touching the ball, now the offense stops with Tim Hardaway Jr. touching the ball. He's a career 35% 3-pt shooter in a godawful offensive system in NY. Let's see if he can't be a more productive player than the jumbled amalgamation of bench guys we rotated around late last year."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,White_Flight_26,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:01:25 2015 UTC,"The more that I look at Hardaway the more comfortable I am with the trade. I mean.. I don't think he would have gone 15 in this draft, but he has had some really good flashes in the NBA and he's not much older than Jerian Grant. Bud sees something in him so I'm gonna let this one play out before judging any more.."
AtlantaHawks,3b5qia,dillpickles007,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:20:57 2015 UTC,I like how complainers would rather have a more expensive 15th pick than THJ. 15th-20th picks in the draft hardly ever turn out to be decent. And we save money. Idk what everyone's problem is. We're not looking to lose cap space to develop players along. We want to win now.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,Coteup,26,Fri Jun 26 01:42:26 2015 UTC,Someone tell me how to feel?
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,ern19,19,Fri Jun 26 01:44:45 2015 UTC,Ok so I'm a Knicks fan. Tim has potential on the offensive end and has a pretty nice jumper.  But as it stands for him now if his shot's not falling he's probably not giving you anything else.  Sub par defender... Doesn't know how to create for others / can't really put the ball on the floor.  But who knows... pretty much every young player we've traded has gone on to be an all-star.  So good luck. Tame your expectations. At least you didn't take Porzingis with the 4th pick.  Hopefully he makes me eat my words.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,CorsoKO,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:17:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dirk is a bad comparison for Kristaps, but don't forget how much Dirk struggled early on and how much work he put in to build his game. It's a cliche, but NY is a hard place for a young player to develop. Hopefully this kid has the drive, and more importantly the support system around him."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,whitebabyjesus,25,Fri Jun 26 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'm both a Michigan fan, and a Tim Hardaway fan and I'm kinda losing my mind here. I think it's an awesome trade. Remember, he was one of the few ""Untradable"" assets the Knicks had last year, meaning they valued him MORE than JR Smith and Shumpert.   Honestly, I think this is a great trade. He doesn't need as much time developing since he's been in the league for a moment and he gives us another great shooter. I dig the shit outta this trade."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,fireglz,15,Fri Jun 26 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but there is a lot of misinformation here. He wasn't ever a '2nd option' on the Knicks. He is just a very very streaky shooter who can at times get to the rim. No passing game, doesn't rebound and poor defensively. Hopefully for him he can develop into that scoring 6th man role."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,mostbasicusername,3,Fri Jun 26 02:02:42 2015 UTC,doesn't rebound    That's OK.  Nobody else in Atlanta does either.  :P
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,mavajo,17,Fri Jun 26 11:33:51 2015 UTC,38% FG is a great shooter? oy vey.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,cheekybloke,12,Fri Jun 26 01:53:24 2015 UTC,......because the Knicks are some sort of mythical fountain of talent. Carmelo Anthony is a fantastic leader.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,fireglz,5,Fri Jun 26 01:57:22 2015 UTC,LOL
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,TitsMcgee-00,10,Fri Jun 26 02:19:16 2015 UTC,"He was the second option on the Knicks. He won't be that here, he's a good shooter."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,ATL_GritzBlitz,3,Fri Jun 26 01:55:40 2015 UTC,You're right...a second option on the knicks should be a 5th option for us.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,atomsej,8,Fri Jun 26 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"he's wasn't the second option. knicks actively tried to get him to stop shooting. what hawks are getting is a guy with an array of offensive moves but no clue when to use them. he still has the chance to be very good on offense. not much hope on defense, but maybe your guys could help his overall IQ. ceiling might be a kevin martin type player."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,E-Miles,7,Fri Jun 26 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"Lol, no we did NOT value him more than JR Smith and Shumpert.  He was one of the worst players on the team."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,pinata_penis_pump2,7,Fri Jun 26 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"Knicks fans are low on him currently, and I don't think it's very justifiable. Fish didn't let him get into rhythm last year, as he would pull him as soon as he fucked up. He is CLUTCH. Also awful on D, but I think he can become at least decent enough at it. Personally, as a Knicks fan, I'm going to miss him and think that he was generally a scapegoat for an awful, awful team that sucked. I'm pretty bummed actually..."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,whiskeyandtea,-7,Fri Jun 26 01:56:08 2015 UTC,Bad? Best case scenario is we field the same team except with Demarre getting paid 5x as much for 4 years or so. We get to continue being LeBron's punching bag if we don't get knocked out by the Wizards or another younger team. All without the hope that who we could of drafted this year would have turned into a good player on a rookie contract.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,BeautifulMohammad,6,Fri Jun 26 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because Kelly Oubre or Sam Dekker would turn us into instant contenders. It's not like THJR is some old geezer anyway, he's what, 23? Demarre wasn't exactly a heralded player when we brought him in, either."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,online_predator,3,Fri Jun 26 05:27:35 2015 UTC,Demarre cost 2.5 million. Hardaway cost a 1st round draft pick. Demarre was known for his effort and was considered a good defender with a developing 3 point shot. Hardaway is known for his streaky 3 point shooting and complete lack of defense. Don't compare the two.  When you can't attract top tier free agents then one way of improving is finding talent in the draft. You can possibly lock a good player for a long time on a cheap contract. Plenty of good players have been had in the mid 1st round for example Kawhi. We threw away that chance for a slightly better version of John Jenkins who thinks he is Ray Allen.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,BeautifulMohammad,3,Fri Jun 26 05:57:58 2015 UTC,"Demarre also came off the bench for a Utah team that couldn't make the playoffs, and saying he had a ""developing"" 3pt shot is revisionist history, as he was literally only known as a scrapper who can get rebounds and score in transition."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,online_predator,0,Fri Jun 26 13:54:38 2015 UTC,22% of his shots were 3 point attempts in his last year at Utah
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,BeautifulMohammad,3,Fri Jun 26 18:00:09 2015 UTC,and he made 28% of them. your point?
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,online_predator,-1,Fri Jun 26 18:31:08 2015 UTC,That he has been developing a 3 point shot.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,BeautifulMohammad,43,Fri Jun 26 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"Carroll worked out, Thabo worked out, Bazemore worked out...  I trust the Hawks opinions on wing players. I'm hopeful."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,SharplyDressedSloth,18,Fri Jun 26 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"As a Spurs and Hawks fan, I think it's time to adopt a classic Spursism for the Hawks: In Bud We Trust."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,Starsy,6,Fri Jun 26 02:28:07 2015 UTC,"That's a good way to put it. I realize Ferry isn't in charge, but we need to have faith in Bud's ability to develop players. Hardaway has talent."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,cosmo_bear,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:55:11 2015 UTC,"You should be, i think they can make a decent player out of him if he wants to listen and work hard to get better."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,Cefkovod,24,Fri Jun 26 10:19:24 2015 UTC,Remember what we did with our last first round pick? He rode the bench and never played and got traded. Buds system is hard for a newbie. Bud thinks he can come in and fit perfect in our system. I'm beginning to chill and actually think about it. It might not be horrible. Who knows if Korver will ever be the same after his injury. Guys... just sleep on it.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,tharoosta,9,Fri Jun 26 01:59:15 2015 UTC,"Remember what we did with our last first round pick?   Just because our previous draft pick was a bust doesn't mean we should be tossing them away for role players like THJ. Yes, there's a chance they will bust like Payne or Henson, but we really needed to take a swing since this team as constructed will not get past Cleveland, who will be even better next season.  Role-player, one-dimensional shooting guards are expendable and can be easily picked up in free agency. To spend our 1st round pick, one of our biggest assets to improve this season (given our cap situation), on a guy like THJ, is a tremendous waste of value, especially for a small market basketball team like Atlanta.   Who knows if Korver will ever be the same after his injury   The thought of this makes me even more depressed than this trade did itself. I need another drink."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,shyspy,8,Fri Jun 26 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"You act as if Oubre wouldn't be a one-dimensional role player for us next year. If you think Oubre is the missing piece that will suddenly vault us past LeBron, you need to put down the kool-aid.   We won 60 games last year without Oubre, I think we'll be ok."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,drsmith21,-2,Fri Jun 26 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"We won 60 games last year without Oubre, I think we'll be ok.   I'm happy we won 60 games last season - it was the most fun I've ever had watching this team, but if you think this team is good enough to win it all, then perhaps you should ""put down the kool-aid."" Keep in mind the road to the Finals will never be as easy as it was this year for the Hawks again.  Also, I never said anything about Oubre, and didn't care much for him, but surely we could've done better than Timmy Hardaway Junior. One draft pick may not vault us into eliteness, but it's paramount to at least maximize value from it. This move was anything but that."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,shyspy,2,Fri Jun 26 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest, at one point in the season when everyone was healthy we were the best team in the league by a fair margin, even better than golden state. If the playoffs started before thabo got injured i could easily see us making the finals and maybe winnin it all."

AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,atomsej,2,Fri Jun 26 16:45:53 2015 UTC,"This isn't to defend the trade, since I don't really have a strong opinion on it at the moment.  But, how often are #15 picks difference makers or team-changers anyway?  Those types of guys are almost exclusively taken in the lottery picks.  Outside of the lottery picks, you're generally just gonna get a role-player at best anyway - extremely rare that you get a game-changer.  This ain't the NFL.  So I don't see any obvious loss here.  The biggest thing I'd like to see the Hawks do is trade away Teague.  Far too inconsistent and isn't reliable.  His perceived value greatly exceeds his actual value, IMO, and I think we could get a very nice return."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,mavajo,2,Fri Jun 26 11:32:31 2015 UTC,There have bern plenty of post lottery picks that have made nice impacts on squads. Hell even thj himself was a 24th pick
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,atomsej,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"I agree that #15 picks can be hit-or-miss, but when they hit, they really change the outlook of the team. Heck, Teague, Dennis, and Millsap were all picked at positions later than 15."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,shyspy,21,Fri Jun 26 17:10:27 2015 UTC,We needed a sixth man.  We got a sixth man.  I'm fine with it because he fills an immediate need which is bench scoring.  He also won't hurt us as a starter until Korver is cleared to play.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,justcamp,11,Fri Jun 26 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"Korver should not be a starter anymore. This is probably an unpopular opinion here, but you guys saw what happened in the playoffs. He's been coming off the bench his entire career and can do it again for us and be incredible at it."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,thabooshka,30,Fri Jun 26 02:01:28 2015 UTC,"Korver is our offense.  The team's offensive rating TANKS when he is off the court.  Without finding a number one option, Korver must start for this team."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,justcamp,11,Fri Jun 26 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"Without even looking at metrics, I want Korver to start just because of the spacing he can provide. Starting the game allows our other four starters to have ample room to do work and will help us get to early leads. Plus, with all of the high usage players we have starting, Korver as a starter literally just had to catch and shoot, which he is more than happy doing."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,davidsreddittag,3,Fri Jun 26 02:23:55 2015 UTC,Metrics are a product of what we see on the court.  I said the same thing you did in half the breaths.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,justcamp,3,Fri Jun 26 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"For sure. I was just bolstering your argument because there are people who don't want to dabble with metrics. Just watching Korver play, he definitely fills our starting role fine."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,davidsreddittag,4,Fri Jun 26 02:33:27 2015 UTC,I didn't mean that to sound as dickish as it reads.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,justcamp,5,Fri Jun 26 02:57:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for pointing out our biggest flaw. Korver being our most important offensive piece. You shut him down, we suck. It can't be that way because again, as we saw in the playoffs, he isn't that difficult to shut down if you just put a man on his hip the whole way."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,thabooshka,7,Fri Jun 26 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"You're simplifying a complex concept.  Korver gives everyone else space to work.  Shutting him down still gives Teague, Sap, Carroll, and Horford room to be effective offensively.  Our greatest weaknesses in playoffs were unquestionably bench scoring, wing defense, and rebounding."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:56:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, he does help spread the floor really well. But he's been a bench player his entire career and I really think he could flourish their in our system. He would come in and totally change the flow and pace of the game and throw other teams out of rhythm. I love Kyle, trust me, he's one of my favorite Hawks. But for a championship contending team that we all want to be he will do us much better off the bench, being able to give us a spark we need when we need it."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,thabooshka,3,Fri Jun 26 03:00:25 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think you'd have the same argument if the Hawks had a sixth man capable of carrying the team for stretches when Korver is on the bench.  Taking your most game-changing offensive option off the floor and putting him on the bench just because he was a bench player prior to his seasons in Atlanta makes no sense to me.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:07:43 2015 UTC,Has there been an in-depth analysis of what happened to our offense (and Korver) in the playoffs? I remember reading a great article shortly after our January run detailing exactly how Korver opens up the offense in addition to his great shooting. It felt like in the playoffs we never got an open look and had to scratch and claw for every basket. I've only been closely following the NBA for 5-6 years so the nitty gritty strategy stuff is still a bit mysterious to me.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,khalorei,3,Fri Jun 26 02:31:04 2015 UTC,Injuries man
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,sumoboi,3,Fri Jun 26 06:07:42 2015 UTC,"When October rolls around and you remember that NBA players don't give two shits about playing defense during the regular season, you will most definitely want Korver starting."

AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,atomsej,9,Fri Jun 26 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"Listen I'm not gonna look anybody in the face and say this trade is terrific. A first round pick for someone like Tim Hardaway Jr is never impressive, but what we have is an interesting young scoring bench player. I think most knew we weren't gonna make a big splash in the draft and most of our big news comes from our free agency situation. Not only is signing Demarre and Millsap looking very doable right now, but in the first time in forever, Atlanta is a free agency destination. Don't doubt Bud and co until free agency season is over, that's where all the important moves will be made."

AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,Wong-A-Donger,8,Fri Jun 26 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"Trying to be an optimist - think he will be much more effective on a MUCH better team that doesn't run the triangle and preaches team defense. He costs less than the 15th pick would have and can play right away. Scoring off the bench, someone who can create off the bounce and finish on the break. A lot of negative stats on him, but he played for a Knicks team that quit week 2 of the season."
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,jamesbradb,10,Fri Jun 26 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"Just putting it out there, the Knicks players the Cavs got looked amazing in Cleveland. I'm thinking any Knicks player will look good elsewhere now."

This much was evident from our series with the Cavs and even the Nets.   To end up with Tim Hardaway Jr, a one-dimensional bench-caliber player, as our main haul of such an important night is quite... disappointing.  Love Bud the coach, but really iffy on him as GM.

AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,slic62000,3,Fri Jun 26 03:39:53 2015 UTC,I like it. Not only do we get a shooting guard that can do other things than just shoot but also we save more money to re-sign Demarre and Sap.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,stbennett,2,Fri Jun 26 01:45:40 2015 UTC,he can be a chucker too with not that great perimeter defense as say shumpert or carroll. playing with the knicks is the opposite of bud's system and his chucking showed up more recently. i hope he works out though.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,cheekybloke,2,Fri Jun 26 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's all we need him to do. Someone to hit spot up 3s off the bench."

AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,NeonSubtlety,6,Fri Jun 26 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"Hawks have repeatedly said they prefer proven nba talent over mid alter first round questions. He shot like shit in NY because that team sucked ass and he was the 2nd option. There's a reason Shumpert, JR, Amare, have all improved dramatically after leaving last year's black hole of a team"

AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,cheekybloke,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:54:30 2015 UTC,he was drafted for his offense and that hasn't really manifested. playing on the knicks hardly gives a player much motivation to get better on defense either. he's here for scoring off the bench but he is streaky and tended to just take jumpers over slashing to the rim.
AtlantaHawks,3b56kx,NeonSubtlety,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"My guess is that he'll come off the bench while thabo starts.  The thing is...from what I've seen, he's not the type to create his own shot.  He'll be great at the end of our rotations.  But, someone else will need to initiate that offense.  Hard to understand when I thought we were really after some more depth in the frontcourt.  Dekker and portis both felt like good fits.  But the front office clearly didn't feel like they were an answer for us.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed.  But I hope I'm proven silly for being so."

It chaps me a bit that people got so bent out of shape with this move. Bud isn't an idiot. He's not swinging blindly here- mark my words we'll look back on this a year from now and be giddy.

With Tim, we get an athletic, young, CHEAP, 2-year guard that can get to the basket better than Korver, and also shoot 3's. Now we don't have to worry about signing Ellis and spending big bucks on him, and we have more room to worry about finding a big man. I highly doubt this could do anything but help us in the long run. We're going to have a great luxury with this guy coming off the bench."

AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,thrashfan,3,Fri Jun 26 13:17:35 2015 UTC,"When I got home I got the full details and was disappointed none of the 2nd round picks were this year.   But after watching some THJr highlight reels and hearing what Bud said about him I think we can mold him into a great scorer in this system. Plus we saved money. I really really liked the Oubre pick, but Bud and Co felt like this was the best move. In Bud We Trust"
AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"It's clear that Bud doesn't believe in Scott or Jenkins.  THJ is here to hit spot up threes when Korver is on the bench and run in transition when Baze or Schroeder create a turnover.  The system will limit Hardaway ISOs and will get him better looks that he got in NY.  It's still up to him to put in the work on defense or else Bud will move on like he did with Payne, Jenkins, and presumably Scott.   This was definitely plan B.  We didn't really have the assets to move up and none of the players that would have been difference makers here fell to 15.  We gathered assets, addressed a need, and saved half a million which may come in handy in negotiating with DeMarre."
AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,thrashfan,0,Fri Jun 26 13:39:09 2015 UTC,Really interested to see what happens with Mike Scott in the next few days. I am sure they are trying to shop him to free cap.

AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,thrashfan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:08:06 2015 UTC,"You're thinking we send a 2nd and Scott for a 2nd? Man, if so they really are quite clever. Seems like one of the few ways a team might pick him up at 3mil a year"
AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"After the draft, I don't expect we'd get a 2nd for him.  Maybe a Euro-stash.  Our 2nd's purpose would be for another team taking the ~1.5mil difference in contract.  We could try to dump Shelvin's 2.5mil as well."
AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,thrashfan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"That sucks. But who knows, maybe someone likes him."
AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"He's not a bad player, but definitely took a step back this season when we needed him to take a step forward.  I love Scott's energy off the bench, but his production tanked at the end of the season.  If he's not producing on offense, there's no reason to give him minutes because of his awful defense.  Oh fuck, I just said the same thing every Knicks fan has said about Hardees Jr."
AtlantaHawks,3b6t6a,fireglz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've watched highlights of the April 13th game against NY and I gotta believe that factored into us grabbing THJ. There's a lot to be said about contrasting the level of camaraderie between Hawks players and Knicks players. I think ultimately, we're a much better fit for him.  Remember, JR Smith was a 35.5% 3pt shooter in 24 games with NY. Then he went to Cleveland and shot 39% for the remaining 46 games. Funnily enough, Hardaway's a 35.3% 3-pt shooter in his two years with the Knicks. If we can get that same increase from moving him to a much friendlier shooting offense with more open looks there's a lot to be excited about.   The negative is there. He doesn't play defense and the ball tends to stop on offense when he touches it, but he could realistically be the 3rd best perimeter player on the team coming into next year, and another athlete who can penetrate and score or kick the ball out.  Since we missed out on draft hype here, let's get some pre-THJ draft video's going here.

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Kllian,4,Fri Jun 26 02:08:56 2015 UTC,I'm okay with Tim Hardaway Jr. Just don't leave Phillips Arena. It's perfect and we don't need a new arena.

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,atomsej,4,Fri Jun 26 01:45:01 2015 UTC,WOOO TIM HARDAWAY
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,mistarogers8,5,Fri Jun 26 01:46:51 2015 UTC,Clearly a cap space saving move.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,tocohills,3,Fri Jun 26 01:48:24 2015 UTC,So with our 15th overall pick we get....A Knick?

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,stnewton,14,Fri Jun 26 02:02:50 2015 UTC,They saved roughly $35. Now we can sign all the free agents. All of them.

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,3,Fri Jun 26 01:03:50 2015 UTC,FUCK WE TRADED OUBRE
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,jknox94,3,Fri Jun 26 01:18:46 2015 UTC,I have to imagine that trade was in the works before we drafted Oubre. It's not like we drafted him then Washington started hollering. Likely some rule prevented us from trading the pick straight up so we agreed to draft Oubre for Washington. Doubt we would have drafted Oubre if it weren't for the trade.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Intercepting,4,Fri Jun 26 01:35:39 2015 UTC,NOW I NEED A NEW FUCKING TV  BUSTED A HOLE IN IT. THIS IS FUCKED
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,TCorlz,3,Fri Jun 26 01:46:22 2015 UTC,Maybe Bud sees some nasty potential and we got a steal. I trust with Bud over there they have some smarts going around.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,jknox94,5,Fri Jun 26 01:53:58 2015 UTC,I can't imagine Tim Hardaway was the ultimate goal out of our trades tonight. Everyone just chill atleast until the offseason is over before you jump ship.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,schnarglord,2,Fri Jun 26 02:04:22 2015 UTC,Damnit! I really wish we could have scooped up Trilly Willy :(

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,brokerrobtampa,3,Fri Jun 26 01:01:04 2015 UTC,Why?  Oubre or Porter would be solid at 15
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,tocohills,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:02:11 2015 UTC,I guess I can talk myself into Oubre.

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,cosmo_bear,2,Fri Jun 26 01:22:10 2015 UTC,Gotta be Portis/Hollis-Jefferson/RJ
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,tharoosta,2,Fri Jun 26 01:24:16 2015 UTC,I think Portis is is the guy we really wanted and we realized we could probably get him at 19 and gain 2 picks.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,brokerrobtampa,2,Fri Jun 26 01:25:50 2015 UTC,How can you trade away a guy who wore red to the draft. Plus those shoes...
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,killjoyous,2,Fri Jun 26 01:28:03 2015 UTC,Word is we are trading again...
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,brokerrobtampa,2,Fri Jun 26 01:31:05 2015 UTC,We can take Portis here!
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,jknox94,2,Fri Jun 26 01:35:43 2015 UTC,I am not happy about getting Tim Hardaway...
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,killjoyous,2,Fri Jun 26 01:36:40 2015 UTC,"So I guess we get Portis here judging by some comments? The second Vivlamore trade rumor looks shaky. Someone convince me of Portis, I don't know much about him. Edit: lol jk. Welcome tim hardaway I guess."
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,schnarglord,2,Fri Jun 26 01:41:17 2015 UTC,We got Tim Hardaway Jr.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,kevinonthemoon,2,Fri Jun 26 01:41:18 2015 UTC,WTF do we need Hardaway Jr for?! :(
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,GT2018,2,Fri Jun 26 01:42:19 2015 UTC,Possibly to make another trade. Who knows who it will be for or who we will trade but now we have 4 point guards on the roster.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,killjoyous,2,Fri Jun 26 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"This time for sure! Portis come to ATL  edit: wait, what now? I don't have a stream so I'm just refreshing the draft tracker, what's this about Hardaway??"
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,GT2018,12,Fri Jun 26 01:49:15 2015 UTC,Bro you're so late haha
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Decatur_Psalm,2,Fri Jun 26 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"Haha all I can do is periodically refresh the draft tracker... Judging by this thread things aren't going well though, and we also aren't getting Portis."
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,jknox94,2,Fri Jun 26 01:47:38 2015 UTC,why didnt we get a defender like hollis jefferson or something
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,2,Fri Jun 26 01:49:38 2015 UTC,Hardaway is young and more athletic that Korver so he's got that going for him. No need to overreact just because it's not a blockbuster. There's still a shit ton more offseason trading and signing to deal with.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,-Runaway,2,Fri Jun 26 01:51:23 2015 UTC,15 for the Tim Hardaway Jr and the Wizards' 2016 and 2019 second-rounders.   wow.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,C-Jammin,4,Fri Jun 26 01:55:30 2015 UTC,A 2019 second rounder? I'd rather pass a fucking kidney stone.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,BeautifulMohammad,2,Fri Jun 26 01:58:48 2015 UTC,I have to imagine this is a cap move.  I expect us to go all-in in free agency in 2016.

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,MSU1X,5,Fri Jun 26 02:12:29 2015 UTC,"Basically we traded oubre for grant and two second rounders. Then traded grant for Tim Hardaway Jr, for simplicity sake. In the end we have Tim Hardaway jr and two future second rounders."
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,MSU1X,2,Fri Jun 26 02:14:27 2015 UTC,SWEDENNNNNNNNN.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,aumht,2,Fri Jun 26 02:16:53 2015 UTC,Another stash pick. Damn.

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,johnofga,2,Fri Jun 26 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"So we got 2 foreign stash and cash guys, plus Tim hardaway jr. Danny Ferry is sitting at home laughing right now at what has transpired. Literally all we needed to do was draft a sf or pf who could replace Demarre or Paul. The grades we will receive for this draft won't be pretty."
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,6,Fri Jun 26 04:18:48 2015 UTC,Smh at all the non believers in this thread.   CAW CAW!
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,GT2018,3,Fri Jun 26 04:23:21 2015 UTC,Reports that we've called about trades to get Mudiay.  Wut
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,twsmith89,2,Fri Jun 26 01:54:49 2015 UTC,"Why would we even do that?? Teague just went to the ASG, Schroeder has potential to be even better than him, even Shelvin Mack is serviceable off the bench. PG is our most solid position."
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,2,Thu Jun 25 23:21:40 2015 UTC,We'd have to give up so much to make this happen. I feel like it's an overeager new owner group trying to make a splash
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,2,Thu Jun 25 23:23:19 2015 UTC,Portis or Oubre. Good draft
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,gsu_ut,2,Thu Jun 25 23:30:15 2015 UTC,Yes! Thank you Rockets
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,jknox94,4,Fri Jun 26 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, just fucking wow"

AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,2,Fri Jun 26 01:19:08 2015 UTC,Well hope is still alive to Get Dekker
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,ichinii,2,Fri Jun 26 01:20:40 2015 UTC,I really hope we didnt make that dumb trade for Sam Dekker
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,ichinii,2,Fri Jun 26 01:21:34 2015 UTC,It would be a dream if we got Sam Dekker.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,Shade_Raven,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:23:07 2015 UTC,I have no idea who we will draft.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,broeho,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:14:45 2015 UTC,A forward or Center.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,killjoyous,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:58:43 2015 UTC,I'm in this bitch. LETS GO.  I have absolutely no idea what we are gonna do.  Not a clue.  I actually don't know what anyone is gonna do.  Never been so uncertain going into a draft.  I'm excited.
AtlantaHawks,3b4jp9,cosmo_bear,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:12:57 2015 UTC,So now either Mudiay or Winslow is going to be all the way down to #8.  Crazy

AtlantaHawks,3b525m,brokerrobtampa,29,Fri Jun 26 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"Philips is great.  Nice inside, great amenities with the CNN center and great food around the place.  Its unique with its suite wall that also makes it lowder and allows for fans to be closer to the court.  MARTA runs right to it.  The city is in the middle of the target demographic of young city dwellers. The only downside is traffic and you're gonna get that no matter where you are in ATL.    This would make absolutely no sense.  It made sense for the Braves because Turner field has nothing going for it really.  Theres the stadium which is nice enough, but thats it.  The Braves target young white families, and those all live in the northen suburbs.  They're gonna have high end shopping near it to cater to that same demo.  Smaller stadium to increase demand and to make the stadium look full more often. The only downside from moving the stadium is the lack of a downtown backdrop, but that doesnt matter. Its baseball, watch the game. For the Hawks it makes no sense.  Moving the stadium would be awful and wholly detrimental to the team."
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,cteez910,28,Fri Jun 26 02:12:23 2015 UTC,"Eugh, I'm tired of this shit. We don't need a new arena every 15 years."
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,justcamp,12,Fri Jun 26 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"FUCK NO. YOU UNDERSTAND BRANDING YOU OWNERSHIP TWATS? Remember how you paid almost twice what the franchise was valued at in 2012? That's because of positive branding and Phillips Arena is almost certainly a huge part of that. We're not a ghost town. Phillips gets incredibly loud, and Sir Foster is our primary non-basketball attraction.   JUST STOP TOUCHING SHIT AND LET WINNING SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS. JESUS."
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,fireglz,10,Fri Jun 26 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, I love my city but if this is true, this is awful, we are so fickle, why can't we keep a place for our sports teams and make it iconic?"
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,dirtyjoo,7,Fri Jun 26 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"There is no point in getting a new arena. It's not like baseball where every field is unique. It's just an arena, they all look the same"

AtlantaHawks,3b525m,ridingthepine,4,Fri Jun 26 03:29:58 2015 UTC,Maybe we can worry about that when those corporate boxes/suites are actually full
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,woahwoahwoah8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:57:42 2015 UTC,Yup. Saw the game in Utah this year and I was commenting on how their arena was surprisingly nice and how it was probably about 15 years old. I looked it up and it's 24 years old. New or unique doesn't really matter when you're watching a basketball game.
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,GT2018,11,Fri Jun 26 03:38:09 2015 UTC,fucking no. I'm ok with a new arena but only if it's downtown. If we move out to Cobb like the Braves we might as well move the team to fucking Seattle.
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,cteez910,-10,Fri Jun 26 02:11:08 2015 UTC,Overreation much?
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,GT2018,11,Fri Jun 26 02:15:55 2015 UTC,Nothing from this team would frustrate me more than moving out of Atlanta.
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,justcamp,4,Fri Jun 26 02:28:48 2015 UTC,I refuse to support the Braves moving because it is a symbol of Atlanta's hideous sprawl.  I have so much more invested in the Hawks than I do the Braves and still will not support the team if they choose to move out of downtown.
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,cteez910,14,Fri Jun 26 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"Thats just being bullheaded and obtuse just for the sake of being.  The whole ITP/OTP identity clash a myth perpetuated by self-righteous Atlantans who think they get to decide what makes something ""Atlantan"" or not.    All cities sprawl.  Every single big city has an suburban sprawl.  Chicago, NY, Houston, Charlotte, Seattle, Dallas, Philly, DC, etc.  Its literally a basis on how metro areas are built."
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,justcamp,5,Fri Jun 26 03:09:55 2015 UTC,"Charlotte's sprawl is awful, but none of the other cities you listed are as spread as Atlanta.  The metro area is also painfully slow to accept viable public transportation options and refuses to cooperate with one another though Fulton/City of Atlanta is the major supplier of jobs to the area.  It is a complex argument that I don't really feel like having, but it has nothing to do with me being bullheaded, obtuse, or out of touch and I'm not concerned with what makes someone a real Atlantan."
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,cteez910,5,Fri Jun 26 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"Houston's sprawl is waaaay worse than Atlanta.  So is Dallas'.  DC is pretty much all sprawl. A 12 mile move down 75 is enough to make you cease being a Braves fan.  Thats impressive, but as you say, you have your reasons."
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,beefsupreme,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:33:12 2015 UTC,Toyota Center is in the downtown Houston area  American Airlines Arena is in the downton Dallas area  So its completely possible to have mega sprawl but stay in the city where your team is based.
AtlantaHawks,3b525m,GT2018,2,Fri Jun 26 16:54:14 2015 UTC,I feel the exact sake way. I never really followed the Braves so losing them so the suburbs isn't that bad. But the Hawks are by far my favorite pro sports team. I really hope the ownership doesn't move them out of the city.

AtlantaHawks,3b525m,ArchEast,3,Fri Jun 26 11:34:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Given the Falcons and Braves push for new stadiums (funded with hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money), a lot of people in the metro area are obviously weary of yet another potential handout to a pro franchise."

I completely understand why the Braves are moving - Turner Field is located in the armpit of this city and there's nothing fun or interesting nearby.  Phillips, though, is in a good location and the facility itself is still quality.  This would make no sense.  A re-model would be fine though.  The place is still generally nice IMO, but some improvements couldn't hurt.  The ""club"" section is great.  The rest of the place is very average."

AtlantaHawks,3b5dm1,ATLjoe93,7,Fri Jun 26 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't think he will be bad here, he never had a consistent coach in NY and the team overall was trash. Questionable that we traded the 15th pick for him, yes, but I think this could turn out well for us."
AtlantaHawks,3b5dm1,mitchymcgee,5,Fri Jun 26 02:52:55 2015 UTC,"To your point about the Knicks being trash, remember that JR Smith and Shumpert both looked like totally different players after leaving New York."
AtlantaHawks,3b5dm1,CLSmith15,0,Fri Jun 26 04:51:37 2015 UTC,"Not really.  JR was still a streaky chucker and Shump was still a ball hawk on D.  Let's be real, the tagline in the Finals was that Lebron and a bunch of nobodies where on the cusp of winning a championship.  However, I believe our system will give Hardaway more spot up attempts and will limit his weaknesses in isolation.  He can also get to the line which is something we sorely need when the offense stagnates in the third or fourth."
AtlantaHawks,3b5dm1,justcamp,4,Fri Jun 26 13:10:57 2015 UTC,"Hardaway's one of my favorite players and IMO with a good coach like Bud, on a contender, and not the 2nd offensive option like he was on the Knicks, I think Hardaway will prosper. He has the potential to be a 15+ PPG guy but New York was not the best system for him. I'll be watching much more Hawks games this year because of this trade and hopefully Hardaway has a great season."
AtlantaHawks,3b5dm1,-Lemur,7,Fri Jun 26 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. We basically used our 15th pick to draft a 23 year old with NBA experience and good offensive skills. He still has time to develop and he won't have a lot of pressure on him.   Also, the 2 future 2nds don't hurt."

Him - Olympiakos pf/c. Pure pf actually, but this season our coach started using him at c. He's 208cm (6'10""), quite long for pf. Needs to work more on upper body, improve his drive, but otherwise he's quite fast and good at defense. His perimeter shot is not bad, but not exactly consistent. He's still very young but got valuable first team time this season and played in all the important games.  At first he was susceptible to quick fouls but improved that during the 2nd half of the season. He brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm. He probably needs 2 more seasons in Europe before he makes the big step."

Won't hesitate to shoot the three ball and can catch fire quickly.  Good size at 6' 6'' for a 2.  First team All-Rookie two years ago, had a string of 20 point games in his rookie season.  Good athleticism and not an awful rebounder for his position. Average court vision.  Cons: Difficulty creating his own shot and has bad handles.  Makes a lot of boneheaded plays such as fadeaway threes with plenty of time on the clock.  Despite his athleticism, he's not a great cutter and isn't the best finisher at the rim.  He may have some attitude problems as I often got the impression that he believed he was a superstar (Dion Waiters disease), though he rarely backed it up.  Has a reputation as a streaky chucker (well earned in my opinion) because, well, he chucks the ball a lot.  Can hit three quick 3-pointers then go 3-14 for the game.  Gives minimal effort on defense, though he has the size to at least try."

AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,Kllian,3,Fri Jun 26 12:03:09 2015 UTC,oh God pls no
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,ATLjoe93,6,Fri Jun 26 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Cons:  is a bit of an unknown talent. He was VASTLY misused by the knicks and undeveloped, we overpaid for him in terms of pick value. Is a bit older and thus a little less time under contract.  Pros: Fits the mold here FAR better than the Triangle, is VERY reasonably priced and turned a single pick into himself and two 2nd rounders, frees up much needed cap space."
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,mehjbmeh,3,Fri Jun 26 04:55:12 2015 UTC,"""VASTLY misused by the knicks""... I think that is part of the Pros. We see a talented player who was in a horrible situation for personal growth. 13-14 Knicks were bad, 14-15 Knicks were horrendous. He was seen as a serious asset last summer, and he regressed as just about every Knick did this past season. THJR still has a lot of work to do but he was miscast, underdeveloped, and out of sorts in NYC. Hopefully, the change in scenery brings out a better player than anyone we could have drafted at 19."
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,BourbonismyCoke,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:37:38 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I think he's going to look like a very different dude in a year or two. The question is will that dude be a role player or something better?  Honestly, I see him as a role player who does his job well and that's worth a 15th selection to get him and two 2nd rounders."
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,mehjbmeh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:39:32 2015 UTC,Pros: him and Schroeder will be fun to watch  Cons: defense with those 2 will drop dramatically
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:37:55 2015 UTC,In Bud's system if he improves this summer he will give you guys a much needed scoring punch off the bench.  If Thabo gets healthy and up to his best again him and thabo would be a great pairing in the 2nd unit.
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,loosemoose9,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:23:29 2015 UTC,Pros: Has extensive playing time for a player at his age without super high expectations. I would say he has panned out quite well for someone w ho was drafted in the mid 20s. Could become a very good 3 and D player like Wes Matthews. It's up to Bud to develop this kid  Cons: Didn't get the best value of the earliest non lottery pick. Still a lot of relatively good talent available for us to choose from
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,PoetJustice,-5,Fri Jun 26 05:08:26 2015 UTC,"cons: chucker, streaky shooting, shitty defense, not a passer pros: can sometimes light it up  downvote me all you want but i bet you i watched more knicks games than any of you."
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,Decatur_Psalm,9,Fri Jun 26 03:21:27 2015 UTC,i watched more knicks games than any of you.  We're sorry for your loss.
AtlantaHawks,3b5hb8,mehjbmeh,-7,Fri Jun 26 11:42:00 2015 UTC,Pro: Maybe the Hawks hire a real gm now.

AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,TheOrginalGatorHater,9,Thu Jun 25 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm glad they're so polarizing. If much rather it be a love/hate thing that the 'meh' it's been since forever ago. My whole argument is the team created a play identity last season- it's time for them to have a visual identity, too. The average NBA fan couldn't tell you what the Hawks looked like. That won't be a problem now. The more we're in the eye of the public at large, the better we'll do with getting players wanting to play in the ATL. Atlanta isn't Miami or NY or LA. We've got to use whatever tools we have to make this team a destination. I think the new look helps to that end."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,poerhouse,3,Thu Jun 25 18:25:39 2015 UTC,I don't like the new uniforms but this is the best argument I've seen so far as for why they are a good thing. Have an upcaw!

AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,ajg47,5,Thu Jun 25 12:14:54 2015 UTC,"Gasol mentioned Atlanta in an interview a few weeks ago, but that's it"
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,hrtattx,2,Thu Jun 25 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"Gasol likes Memphis, don't think he's leaving there."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,vernalagnia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"He really does seem like a one team forever kind of guy because of his extensive ties to Memphis. I'd be shocked if he left, but I was shocked at LMA wanting out of Portland, so what do I know?"
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,JM4G1C,3,Thu Jun 25 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"While I can't say that I'm a super-duper sports follower of any kind, when I see things like this, it makes me wonder when X player is said to be ""considering"" the Hawks, I almost feel like it's a throwaway mention, or something to drive their price up. Correct me if I'm being naive... or too cynical..."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,myatl,3,Thu Jun 25 12:19:50 2015 UTC,You may be right but considering how hawks werent even mentioned in this kind of situtation before ill take it as a big improvement even if a player has ill intention of increasing his leverage by throwin in hawks lol
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,jperez3209,3,Thu Jun 25 12:27:08 2015 UTC,"As exciting as it is to see us listed in this light, I think we should all calm down with all these free agent mentions. Every single major free agent will mention us as a destination because we have so much cap space. Their agents would be silly not to make sure their players know exactly where they can get a max deal. Doesn't mean we will even consider it. As great as Aldridge is, giving him a max deal would mean signing him until he's 35.... I balk at that notion and I figure Bud & West will too."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,whit192,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:33:50 2015 UTC,"Even if we don't end up in the running, the fact he is out there makes it more likely we keep Paul."

AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,jknox94,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"Well consider me a fan. Skill wise it'd be like having two Al Horfords on the floor. I trust Aldridge's rebounding ability more, he's a little more traditional in the big man sense. His jumpshot will still allow us to spread the floor. I think he's a really healthy medium between a physical center like Gasol and a finesse guy like Horford that we'd do great with."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,vernalagnia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"My loyalties are pretty much split 50/50 with Portland and Atlanta. I can't be too thrilled about this. I think he's making a dreadful mistake leaving Portland.   He would fit fairly well here though. He started taking, and making threes with at a decent clip and would make a good upgrade from Millsap.   edit: Although, it's worth noting that he really dislikes playing small and likes to have a fairly traditional big man defensive center to take pressure off of him. He makes a great duo with Rolo for that reason, but teamed up with Horford he would have to get out of his comfort zone significantly."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,joannes3000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"I live in the Portland Metro area and your edit is why I never thought he'd consider coming to Atlanta. Aldridge made it very clear that he wanted a traditional center on the team so he could play the 4 on both sides of the ball. That's why Rolo was a pretty ideal signing for the Blazers. I couldn't imagine that Aldridge would be in a hurry to come to Atlanta where he wouldn't have that traditional center again.  That said, I don't think he's making a mistake leaving Portland. This iteration of the Blazers has hit its ceiling, even if Matthews comes back and the likes of McCollum and Leonard continue to develop. Plus, Aldridge is a big family guy so I've always assumed one of the Texas teams will land him when he leaves."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,vernalagnia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think this Blazers group has peaked, honestly. And not just because 3J and the Legend are going to continue to get better. They've been horribly unlucky with their playoff runs the last two years, running into the Spurs in their utterly unstoppable form last year and limping into the playoffs with basically everyone hurt this year. They spent quite a spell at the top of the West this year, when everyone was healthy - and even with Rolo hurt. I think they had the ability to make the WCF with a good roll on the injury dice, but it looks like we'll never know now."
AtlantaHawks,3b1ycn,joannes3000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Probably not the place for this debate, lol. But come on, now. In the West, even with a healthy roster, I just don't think the Blazers have the talent on board to get past the 2nd round. Shedding Batum's awful contract is a step in the right direction, but now they face the same issue they (and the Hawks) have faced for years - who's going to take their money?"

AtlantaHawks,3b34p0,Intercepting,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Got this from AJC. Looks like we'll either get a new arena or a makeover:  Ressler and Grant Hill, who’s the vice-chair of the Hawks’ executive board, graciously sat still and answered our many queries. Under close questioning by cub reporter Kevin Riley — OK, he’s actually our editor, and I expect a pink slip any minute — Ressler allowed that there were three things the new owners could do about Philips Arena, which opened in 1999: Nothing, remodel or rebuild. And the first, Ressler said, “isn’t an option.”"
AtlantaHawks,3b34p0,playalisticadillac,3,Thu Jun 25 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"I can understand a remodel, but they would be fools to actually leave Philips."

AtlantaHawks,3b2nzh,VusterJones,9,Thu Jun 25 15:11:48 2015 UTC,We should draft him and Jahlil Okafor. Trade John Jenkins to the Kings for Demarcus Cousins. Then trade Elton Brand to the Pelicans for Anthony Davis.

Header  In the header we brought back the old Upvote Factory logo with a sleeker twist. Those of you who have been here since the beginning remember it fondly.  In the center is of course the skyline. To the right is the teams retired banners and the most recent division champs banner.   Over further we have moved the ""users here now"" up, and added in a cool key links block. Complete with links to our twitter, wiki and to message mods as well as links to the team's socials.  Below that is the new submit/search box. Firefox users might notcie this acting weird. If you do please screenshot it and PM along with your resolution.   On the left is our new announcements box. And then the thing I am most excited about, our new schedule. During the season this will display the two most recent games and the next 10-ish. You can click these to go to their corresponding threads or sites.  Sidebar  Fancier new buttons and a fairly pleasing aesthetic for the new sidebar. And of course the players social links. Hover over there faces and Instagram/Twitter icons appear.   Below that our related subreddits.  Lastly  I have added and am going to work in more neat things you can do in comments. Like the  which is just...  [](/#cawcaw)   Also, in posts and comments the # ## ### #### macros are unique.  This is H3  And this is H2  I am still working on these and adding lots more comment images  And as I said in the post great new, cleaner, flairs.

AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,catpooptv,8,Thu Jun 25 02:33:44 2015 UTC,Goose and Moose dynamic duo.
AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,Wong-A-Donger,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:56:05 2015 UTC,Championship confirmed.
AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,ATLjoe93,3,Thu Jun 25 04:18:13 2015 UTC,"He could be a useful fourth big on the right team, but he's limited by his inability to shoot. He'd be behind Pero, Moose, Tavares, and whomever the Hawks draft on the depth chart.  From what I remember, I'd say he could potentially be Mason Plumlee with better hands."
AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,DEaster89,3,Thu Jun 25 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt he'd be behind Tavares right now.  Goose is 30 years old and ready to contribute right away, Edy is 23 and still very raw in terms of experience.  He's gonna need a lot of time to get our system right"
AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,killjoyous,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"Ayon is more skilled, especially around the basket. But I still think that Edy will be able to contribute almost immediately on the defensive end."
AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,DEaster89,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"He could have helped the Hawks in the playoffs. He has been battling plantar fasciitis and health is always a concern for Ayon. Europe's lighter schedule is better for him, but he would have competed for third big with Pero this season if the Hawks had extended a 1.85m qualifying offer to keep him on the team. Hawks ended up $5 million below the cap for the season so this is money they saved on Ayon then didn't use for anything."
AtlantaHawks,3b10ad,BuddyGrizzard,0,Thu Jun 25 16:11:09 2015 UTC,No.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Crcsoccer1,39,Wed Jun 24 17:30:49 2015 UTC,It's nice to see players wanting to actually play for the Hawks for once.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Podlaskie,14,Wed Jun 24 17:38:47 2015 UTC,It's like being the kid at the dance that no girls want to dance with until you hit the floor and bust out all the sweet moves.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,mapex_139,6,Wed Jun 24 22:54:03 2015 UTC,If he can adapt to our play style then I would be all for it. If Coach Bud thinks he can get him to pass more and take good shots then I think this would be great.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,logancook44,5,Wed Jun 24 19:34:16 2015 UTC,I'd love him off the bench.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,playalisticadillac,4,Wed Jun 24 17:56:50 2015 UTC,He isn't worth the money IMO. He can't make 3s and his defense is poor. Bad fit for the system and would probably want a big paycheck. Now if he would settle for less than 10 million and come off the bench then him and Schroeder together would be a good idea.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,GT2018,4,Wed Jun 24 18:42:51 2015 UTC,No thanks
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,PiGaKiLa,6,Wed Jun 24 20:47:28 2015 UTC,He was a 29% 3 point shooter last season (career 31%)...as a shooting guard. Doesn't seem like a good fit here.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,chessbrah,8,Wed Jun 24 17:46:14 2015 UTC,everyone improves their three % when they come here
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Intercepting,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"Athletic scorer though. He's still young and we could improve his shooting.  Having him starting at Shooting Guard instead of Korver would be better for us, though."
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Bankingitbig,3,Wed Jun 24 17:48:15 2015 UTC,"I actually think Monta being a 6th man would be ideal, but I think he will command too much money to be a 6th, nor would he be happy about it."
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Shade_Raven,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:10 2015 UTC,He's 29 IRC
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Intercepting,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:16:32 2015 UTC,oops
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,peejyluigi,3,Thu Jun 25 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"Schroder, monta, thabo is a pretty fantastic second unit 1-3. I'm all for this"
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,alcoholsuperhero,2,Thu Jun 25 05:58:19 2015 UTC,"If he could take the body blow to his ego he'd be the perfect 6th man. Love me some Monta, might even get his jersey if we got him."
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,justcamp,2,Wed Jun 24 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"Monta doesn't seem like he fits the system or the culture of our team, but he would give the offense an interesting wrinkle because he can create his own shot. He also would give space to our shooters and front court because he can push the defense around. He's not my first choice, but I do think Monta makes the Hawks a better team."
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Bankingitbig,2,Thu Jun 25 00:00:44 2015 UTC,"I think he would be an interesting fit. On one hand he isn't the greatest at 3pt shooting and is pretty lackluster on defense. But he could provide a lot on our offense and has the ability to create for himself, which we need."
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,dailyduds,2,Wed Jun 24 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"If we could get him for a good deal I think he would be a great fit. I just don't want him to suck up all of our cap space. But we definitely need something athletic who can drive to the hoop other than teague and schroder. Korver is great, but having Ellis's athleticism to play in the 2 or even in the 3 sometimes depending on what happens there, could help our system a lot. I'm sure his 3 point shooting would improve when he comes here. and if korvers defense improved, so can Ellis's. He has a skill set that would fit very well into our system if he can calm himself down and listen to the team player role that Bud needs him at"
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,ajg47,7,Wed Jun 24 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"Ellis is literally point guard size, playing him at the 3 would be a disaster"
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,USAFHART,2,Wed Jun 24 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"Monta Ellis is interested in coming to Atlanta, Atlanta fans are not interested in him coming to Atlanta. Shoots (and misses) too much, plays zero defense and wants to be the batman of the team and get batman money. Chances are slim we even look his way."
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Bankingitbig,4,Wed Jun 24 19:20:40 2015 UTC,The Hawks looked his way pretty seriously 2 years ago.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Im_just_a_lamp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:28:03 2015 UTC,"Monta seems to me to be a better Lou Williams in terms of a fit in our offense but idk if we are looking for that exactly. I'm not against it at all but I think it would take some ""experimenting"" to see if it would work out in the long run"
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,BeautifulMohammad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:45:58 2015 UTC,I don't see the Hawks doing much better in the playoffs next year than they did this year. I wouldn't mind seeing how the same team would do with Monta in place of Korver.
AtlantaHawks,3az2rf,Boom_Angry,0,Thu Jun 25 03:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think people are too wrapped up with our ""system"". Bud doesn't care about who fits the system from last year, he wants to acquire as much talent as possible and make tweaks to our offense if need be. So really it comes down to if he thinks he can utilize Monta effectively."

AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,Bankingitbig,4,Wed Jun 24 15:58:07 2015 UTC,Waiting for that volt green home alternate Walter Taveras jersey tho.   Nah just kidding. I think I'll go conventional with a black Horford one.
AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,ATLjoe93,2,Wed Jun 24 17:59:44 2015 UTC,Probably won't even buy a t-shirt jersey.
AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,BeautifulMohammad,2,Wed Jun 24 19:17:24 2015 UTC,Old ones.

I think I'll stick to my older Hawks jersey's and apparel. These are just too ugly for my taste, plus I probably couldn't pull them off anyway."
AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,Mgarc1125,9,Thu Jun 25 01:11:31 2015 UTC,None.  I hate em.

AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,USAFHART,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:08:16 2015 UTC,Probably a red Horford or a black Teague
AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,CDub22EP,0,Thu Jun 25 04:04:05 2015 UTC,"Black. Honestly, I fully expect the white jersey to sell horribly. I also think the Hawks are going to have to be really smart with merchandise...for some reason a lot of these marks (see Muscala photo on right) don't look good at all on t-shirts, apparel, etc.   I'll probably stick to the merchandise that focuses on black and volt. It will encompass the brand a lot better than the ""primary"" logos they have without any of the new colors."
AtlantaHawks,3ayoo5,mfoste34,0,Thu Jun 25 13:51:19 2015 UTC,Kent black or red.

AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,StuffandSuch5,14,Wed Jun 24 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"I like reading Lukas' columns, but he's a traditionalist through an through aesthetically; I had little hope he'd be into a total rebrand like this. I'm not fazed in the slightest."
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,poerhouse,15,Wed Jun 24 15:38:25 2015 UTC,I hate them too.
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,StoopidFlexin,7,Wed Jun 24 15:47:34 2015 UTC,My only real problem is the neon green/yellow. It looks terrible. If they had just used the classic yellow/gold or even white then they would have been fine. Hopefully they're not set on using that color.
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,nosliw54,5,Wed Jun 24 20:31:46 2015 UTC,To be fair he's the uniwatch guy. Solid mind on these sorts of things
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,thrashfan,7,Wed Jun 24 15:50:11 2015 UTC,I respect his opinion but I think it comes down to the last idea: classic design or fashionable? I think the Hawks are clearly going for the latter and I'm fine with it. I have no problem becoming the Oregon Ducks of the NBA (in terms of jerseys).
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,e6matt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:30:15 2015 UTC,Which is a hilariously stupid position that is so arbitrary it's unbelievable.
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,CineFunk,2,Wed Jun 24 18:40:36 2015 UTC,Well hes run UniWatch.com for years. I am certain he was only recently hired by ESPN.
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,thrashfan,3,Wed Jun 24 18:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've seen it before, opinions on jersey fashion are so subjective that I find it hilarious anyone gets upset at his."
AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,CineFunk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:47:59 2015 UTC,"No he's been with ESPN for a long time. He used to do weekly articles on ESPN.com, and then every other Thursday he'd do a larger feature piece. Then back in 2006 (can't believe it's been that long), he started the Uni Watch Blog. Trust me, I'm a loooooong time reader."

AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,DJ_Roomba__,4,Wed Jun 24 16:47:29 2015 UTC,"Hard to respect his opinion when he makes such a big deal about none of the uniforms featuring ""Hawks"" on the chest, that's been the case for a year now."

AtlantaHawks,3ayiyx,murph32xx,3,Wed Jun 24 19:12:40 2015 UTC,I think he just meant that neon is the 2010's version of teal  in the 90's  Edit I can't spell teal well
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,QuitKillingMyVibe,3,Wed Jun 24 18:49:16 2015 UTC,Im hoping we get Gasol or LMA but I would hate for either Demarre or Millsap to walk.
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,TheSequel88,2,Wed Jun 24 20:56:50 2015 UTC,Lamarcus Aldridge would be huge. But for us to get him we would probably have to let either Millsap or Carrol walk.
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,BlindBanditMelonLord,5,Wed Jun 24 20:47:02 2015 UTC,I would be ok with that. The only FA I would be willing to lose one of those guys for is LMA
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,GT2018,5,Wed Jun 24 20:49:33 2015 UTC,I am also hoping for Marc Gasol. I think he would fit wonderfully into Bud's system.
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,BlindBanditMelonLord,2,Wed Jun 24 20:52:11 2015 UTC,Wes Matthews!
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,Gtsweet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would be a much bigger fan of Wes in our system than LMA. Dude plays hard defense and shoots 3's at a high %. Normally I wouldn't think it's possible, but if Portland tries to lowball because he's coming off an injury....."
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,fireglz,2,Thu Jun 25 05:33:28 2015 UTC,All of our money will probably go to re-signing Demarre and Millsap.
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,BeautifulMohammad,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:00:34 2015 UTC,I would love for this to happen.
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,AlmightyDaq_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:06:30 2015 UTC,I'd rather Afflalo over Ellis. Gotta look for players who fit here rather than pure talent
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,goamateur,2,Wed Jun 24 23:26:34 2015 UTC,Afflalo could thrive in our system. He's got the defense for sure and I think Bud could make him stop taking Kobe Bryant shots and play disciplined offense within the system. And he wouldn't be that expensive.
AtlantaHawks,3azdng,Jus10Crummie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:52:14 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I hope we resign Carroll, let Millsap walk, and get LMA, Danny Green, or Marc Gasol.  Hopefully our draft pick winds up being solid too."

AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,JerryLangford,6,Wed Jun 24 20:48:29 2015 UTC,Let the haters hate. I'm hyped!
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,poerhouse,3,Wed Jun 24 14:24:01 2015 UTC,Seconded.
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,ATLBlazer,3,Wed Jun 24 14:26:08 2015 UTC,Seconded +1
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,RP336,4,Wed Jun 24 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"I like the jersey, and the design, but the neon is terrible. And I'd like to see the shorts have the pattern all over them not just the side panels, looks off. Lastly, please don't mix and match, that'll look terrible. Hawks fans I am not hating,just saying its a great idea / concept, but the execution is off just a tad. Certainly an upgrade to the uniforms you just got rid of though"
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,Podlaskie,6,Wed Jun 24 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"I am gonna have to disagree about the mix and matching, I think it's a cool idea that can look good."
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,Raydioactive,0,Wed Jun 24 15:30:25 2015 UTC,Yeah mixing and matching will be dope
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,RP336,4,Wed Jun 24 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"When you watch the live stream of this, you can really notice the difference b/t the Black jersey w/ that awesome awesome pattern on it and the black shorts NOT having the pattern except for the side panels. I think they should have continued that pattern on the shorts. Really stands out. Again, guys, not trying to hate on your squad. I'm about them unis, boss. The neon hurts and the pattern not on the shorts hurts. I give it a B for creativity."
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,Raydioactive,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, I like how the pattern is just on the top and the neon is awesome to me, but I also have a throwback maravich jersey so maybe I'm just used to it. I watched the live stream and thought it looks good all around and I'm willing to be the shorts aren't patterned to make the mixing and matching a little more fluid looking"
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,RP336,2,Wed Jun 24 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, the pattern on the shorts would make mix and matching look weird. The uniform to me, could easily be a 10/10 by using less neon ( or scrapping it altogether) and by using just normal yellow instead of the neon."
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,Raydioactive,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:43:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured the neon would be hit or miss. I personally love it and was hoping we'd incorporate into an alternate the last few years. I understand people not liking it though. Clashes a little with the red
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,RP336,0,Wed Jun 24 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"hey, huge upgrade either way. I guess I am more/less just trying to have my cake and eat it too, tailoring it to my personal tastes. The neon is exciting, its outside of the box, as well as the pattern & the mix and match possibilities. Just wish was done a little different. I was not a fan at all of the blue in the previous uniform set. Atlanta Hawks I think red / yellow. Never blue."
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,Raydioactive,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:53:38 2015 UTC,Hated the blue as well. Mostly I'm just glad the franchise is willing to make a few bold choices now and do something different from the rest of the league. It felt like the entire past decade they were trying to blend in

AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,StoopidFlexin,2,Wed Jun 24 15:22:37 2015 UTC,Can we get a poll to vote if we like it or not?
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,bencatapane,2,Wed Jun 24 15:44:11 2015 UTC,"I'm good with the uniforms, but what's with the yellow and green? I don't care if it has any ""underlying themes"" it just makes these uniforms look basically ugly. Perhaps a throwback to the uniforms when ""Pistol Pete"" was on the team?"
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,BeautifulMohammad,2,Wed Jun 24 16:44:39 2015 UTC,The font is so awful with the thorns protruding from the As and 6s. If you're going to try and use a crazy mellow yellow green then go all out with it don't awkwardly shoe horn it. The pattern looks dumb on only half of the shorts. It's awful. It looks like it was randomly generated out of a list of current trends.
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,cripplercrawlspace,4,Wed Jun 24 19:27:49 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT MIX AND MATCH JERSEYS THANK YOU BASED KOONIN

AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,MrCleanMagicReach,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:42:29 2015 UTC,I'm intrigued by the claim that a lot of the design elements/ideas came from the players themselves. Cool if true.  Could also explain why the overall design seems cool if a bit off in some ways... players are not designers.
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,ATLBlazer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:35:13 2015 UTC,Looks like they're going to be using the floor projections in the release. Also looks like they've got the out of bounds blacked out. Maybe we'll find out about the court design too?
AtlantaHawks,3ayct9,poerhouse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:00:48 2015 UTC,The Philips Logo is covered too. Interesting.  https://twitter.com/peachtreehoops/status/613721421827690496

AtlantaHawks,3awps1,codyave,9,Wed Jun 24 02:58:17 2015 UTC,I like the black ones the best but I have a feeling those will be our alternates and the whites will be our home jerseys. Either way I'm pumped and love the way they did the neon green.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Vituperat,11,Wed Jun 24 03:33:04 2015 UTC,I have a feeling the red might be the alternate actually. Notice it says ATL and the other two say Atlanta.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,cosmo_bear,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:36:44 2015 UTC,I cant tell if id rather have it be a lighter yellow or a darker green. But i think the white ones are awesome. (Also that backback is sick).
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,cteez910,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:35:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely a darker green, because then it actually has meaning (the classic 'pete maravich' green color)"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,atomsej,39,Wed Jun 24 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"I edited the neon green to classic yellow, what do you guys think?  http://i.imgur.com/GjW6SHu.jpg"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,p0tatoman,19,Wed Jun 24 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"So much better, I'm on the fence about them as they stand, the only one I like is the black one. I really wish they had used the yellow instead of neon. I appreciate them trying something new, and it's definitely unique which can't be said about our old jerseys."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,online_predator,5,Wed Jun 24 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"Great job, they look better in my opinion."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,supergrega,4,Wed Jun 24 09:57:28 2015 UTC,pretty good as well. Does anyone know what's up with the triangles though?
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,ATLjoe93,8,Wed Jun 24 04:26:52 2015 UTC,Bud implementing a new offense confirmed
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,GussyH,7,Wed Jun 24 08:46:04 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to see us run the triforce offense for quite some time now.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,ATLjoe93,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:48:56 2015 UTC,not a fan of it. reminds me of a HS jersey for some reason but i think it'll grow on me.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,cheekybloke,3,Wed Jun 24 06:49:50 2015 UTC,i like this more but the home looks awfully similar to the cavs' color scheme.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,cheekybloke,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:49:07 2015 UTC,"Only on the white jersey IMO.  The others, especially the black would look much different."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Hedgey,2,Wed Jun 24 13:01:10 2015 UTC,Yeah the black looks like the heat.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,cheekybloke,2,Wed Jun 24 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"Any chance you could do an edit with Pistol era white, green, and blue?"

AtlantaHawks,3awps1,keyboardsitter,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:55:23 2015 UTC,Not really feeling the yellow. Looks like McDonalds. Can you edit out the triangles and just make it a solid color?
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,StoopidFlexin,47,Wed Jun 24 14:06:34 2015 UTC,Love them. We are a franchise known for mediocrity and our boring ass uniforms were the embodiment of that. This is bold and may take some tinkering but it's such a solid step. I think a tone down of the lime on the numbers wouldn't hurt but these will be fun to see on the new court.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,jperez3209,15,Wed Jun 24 03:07:00 2015 UTC,Non-Hawks fan here: I've always viewed the Hawks are the epitome of a boring franchise and their nondescript jerseys only enhanced that opinion. However these new jerseys are really sweet and I'm finally coming around to see the Hawks as 'cool.' It's about time! Go Hawks!
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,127crazie,4,Wed Jun 24 05:14:38 2015 UTC,You're boring :(  In all seriousness I have to agree with you two. I don't see why people hate these uniforms. They're a hell of a lot better than our old ones and are something new and different. We'll definitely stand out now
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Intercepting,3,Wed Jun 24 16:28:44 2015 UTC,I love them too. When I first saw that we were putting in the green color I was disappointed because I didn't think there would be any way they'd look good. But now that I see them I think they're amazing. I think the younger NBA fans will especially love them and you'll see these everywhere.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,playalisticadillac,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:11:00 2015 UTC,"Thunder fan dropping in just to say I totally agree! At first I was skeptical about them but the more I look at them, the more I like them! I think they're great and the younger fanbase will definitely run with these.  Now if only my team could follow suit..."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,lifeapparel,14,Thu Jun 25 21:53:23 2015 UTC,One of the main things I don't like is losing our court design. It looked so dang good last year.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Coachpatato,3,Wed Jun 24 03:09:05 2015 UTC,How do you know they're changing the court design? I havent seen that.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,cteez910,7,Wed Jun 24 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"I could see them keeping the court design but changes out of bounds to Black with a Red ""Atlanta Hawks"" wordmark with white and neon trim."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,johnofga,2,Wed Jun 24 04:04:17 2015 UTC,They will definitely change it because the outside is navy and navy is no longer a color that we use.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Coachpatato,7,Wed Jun 24 03:48:49 2015 UTC,As long as they keep the center logo I'm happy
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,pcorn81,3,Wed Jun 24 03:50:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. Love the pac
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,uckTheSaints,2,Wed Jun 24 15:36:11 2015 UTC,agreed our court design last year was one of the best in the league and probably the best we've ever had. Its a shame that it will only be around for one season
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,koorob,24,Wed Jun 24 06:37:31 2015 UTC,i like the throwback jerseys we wore last season 100x more than these.  sigh.  i will buy them anyhow.  caw caw
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,AlmightyDaq_,8,Wed Jun 24 03:21:17 2015 UTC,Would do anything to get my hands on those ThrowBack Jerseys.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Shade_Raven,3,Wed Jun 24 06:28:54 2015 UTC,I'd murder
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,MrCleanMagicReach,2,Wed Jun 24 10:38:49 2015 UTC,I'd be murdered.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,poerhouse,11,Wed Jun 24 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"I am excited. It almost would have been cooler to have this rebranding before last season- but these new unis are the visual embodiment of a completely new franchise- one that has taken the spotlight out of nowhere and captured a lot of folks' imaginations.  There are Easter eggs and visual references to nearly every past generation of this team if you know your history and look close (the 'Hawks' down the side of the blacks from the 70's, Pac logo from the 80's, ATL from last-gen, etc)... but there is a true evolution in the color palate. I'm guessing the volt is supposed to be a blending of the Pistol Pete era green with the 80's yellow. The challenge will be in living up to the new expectations for the team on the court- if the team remains contenders in the coming years (in Bud we trust) it'll make the colors feel more comfortable and settled- it's just a pretty big jump from what we're used to seeing, so it feels jarring.  I guess I just love that the design honors the past but pushes forward to represent a team with a new identity to both Atlanta and the league. You can tell that, unlike LAC's new kits, a great deal of thought and love went into these. A reimagining of a single throwback wouldn't have felt as cathartic if you ask me."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,lookoutfortank,28,Wed Jun 24 03:49:51 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but these unis are pretty damn ugly. That neon green just doesn't look right.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,AlmightyDaq_,5,Wed Jun 24 04:41:34 2015 UTC,agreed
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,noodlejabb,3,Wed Jun 24 06:29:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah these are pretty bad. I think the alternate uni is truly horrible. I will forever hate any jersey that says ""Atl""  Edit: and home uniforms should have the team's name on it"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,williammc,3,Wed Jun 24 16:31:52 2015 UTC,I think they're gross but that's probably because I'm old.  I can see young people liking them.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,lookoutfortank,7,Wed Jun 24 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"I'm 22. I don't think age applies here. When something is ugly, it's ugly."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,woahwoahwoah8,14,Wed Jun 24 13:33:35 2015 UTC,I'm 22 and I think they're amazing. Funny thing about opinions...
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,atomsej,2,Wed Jun 24 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, the colors are supposed to represent the Hawks. Neon green says nothing about Atlanta to me. You can't force neon green to have meaning. Neon green seems to be the focus of all of the uniforms, which in my opinion was a very bad decision. I wish they reserved neon green to the alt-uniforms, and just left our classic colors on our main ones, especially since even our new logo doesn't have neon green in it."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,kcha295,6,Wed Jun 24 22:19:36 2015 UTC,I'm happy to be on the more edgy side of nba uniforms than the bland side. I love these but boy a lot of people won't.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,LetsGetADrink,6,Wed Jun 24 03:00:52 2015 UTC,Lakers fan here. These are my new favorite jerseys. If you guys had a player I liked then id snag one for sure. For now im just on the fence about settling and getting a Teague one.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,thrashfan,3,Wed Jun 24 08:33:41 2015 UTC,Get a Horford. He's your best bet to retire a Hawk and go down as one of our legends.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,LetsGetADrink,2,Wed Jun 24 09:33:54 2015 UTC,"Even though my opinion on him is pretty neutral, it doesn't change the fact that he's a Gator. I can't go Horford"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,thrashfan,2,Wed Jun 24 13:14:59 2015 UTC,"Haha then you wouldn't like being in Sixth Man. Dawg, Tech and KSU fans alike do the chomp for our boy Al"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,LetsGetADrink,3,Wed Jun 24 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'm an FSU fan/alumni. Buying a Horford jersey is one thing, doing the chomp would never happen haha."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,noodlejabb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:31:52 2015 UTC,Yeah Jesus christ. I don't think I could force my arms to move in that way no matter how hard I tried
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Raydioactive,3,Wed Jun 24 16:28:27 2015 UTC,Bazemore my friend. It is impossible to dislike Bazemore
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,LetsGetADrink,2,Wed Jun 24 12:20:40 2015 UTC,That's true. I actually gave him some thought since he's probably my favorite Hawk.   I'm just hoping you guys pick someone up this offseason. It would make my decision easier.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Crcsoccer1,19,Wed Jun 24 13:18:00 2015 UTC,"Black looks good but seriously Neon Green? WHY? We could've just been red, black, and white"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,KoreanTerran,10,Wed Jun 24 03:18:41 2015 UTC,"I guess they were trying to go for something new.  It looks fine, but I wanna see them on some players"
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,poerhouse,20,Wed Jun 24 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"You mean like Chicago? Or the Raptors? Or the Heat? Or Portland? Or Houston? I'm pretty sure that's why they avoided red, black and white. This team now has a unique visual identity."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Crcsoccer1,8,Wed Jun 24 11:19:22 2015 UTC,That's the one thing I like about these jerseys. Nobody is copying it and we are now the most unique team in the league. I can't wait to see the new look court.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,poerhouse,2,Wed Jun 24 15:46:47 2015 UTC,Yup. My guess is it'll feature the triangles and slate color.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,noodlejabb,0,Wed Jun 24 16:01:30 2015 UTC,nobody is copying it   Because they're uglier than two rats fucking in a bucket

AtlantaHawks,3awps1,USAFHART,3,Wed Jun 24 16:46:33 2015 UTC,Very different but they are extremely unique and are actually pretty sweet. Bet they look great on our players.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Raydioactive,3,Wed Jun 24 12:19:10 2015 UTC,"The neon reminds me of our unis from the 70s. So it's like we've rebranded and brought in a uniform concept that honors just about every era of our uniforms.

AtlantaHawks,3awps1,FlashGorden,2,Wed Jun 24 18:27:37 2015 UTC,I love these uniforms. They are so Atlanta. Everyone loves to hate on Atlanta anything so it's perfect that we now have a uniform that everyone hates.   But seriously these uniforms are sick.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,RP336,2,Thu Jun 25 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"Love the new jerseys. I like the minimalist, throwback look others have done but I think that's also why I like how splashy and unique these are."
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,daaanson,2,Thu Jun 25 02:37:02 2015 UTC,The jerseys are sick. Just lose the neon. It destroys an otherwise brilliant design. Looks like McDonald's High School All American Uni's. Waaaaay too much neon. Still an upgrade from the horrible sets you have had last however many years. Never dug the blue.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,xxNEWNEOxx,2,Wed Jun 24 12:37:33 2015 UTC,I don't get it. The typography on these uniforms doesn't work with the rebrand at all. I figured they were going in a nets/retro direction which would have been great. So disappointing.
AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Matt2486,2,Wed Jun 24 13:05:08 2015 UTC,it looks like someone spilled surge energy drink on their fubu jerseys. The black one is legit.

AtlantaHawks,3awps1,Raydioactive,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:21:56 2015 UTC,The green looks really nice when paired with black only. I could definitely see myself getting that fleece. But neon green combined with red looks pretty ugly in my opinion

The Clippers have some bad away jerseys, but to my eyes, the Atlanta Hawks now own the worst jerseys in the NBA.  Which is a damn shame, cuz you guys had quality unis through the 80s.  Even the early 90s ones at the end of Nique's tenure were solid.  The mid 90s black and red Mutombo/Laettner years were kinda weird.  But I really dug the early 2000s red and yellow look.   Then y'all screwed everything up with the dark blue.  And now, another rebranding fiasco.  Awful.  Neon green, wtf???"

AtlantaHawks,3ax8m9,Orgcore,4,Wed Jun 24 11:58:20 2015 UTC,The neon isn't even the worst part of them IMO. That weird pattern on them looks like the fucking Umbro shorts I wore playing soccer in the mid 90s.

AtlantaHawks,3ax8m9,AlmightyDaq_,3,Wed Jun 24 06:31:15 2015 UTC,Throwbacks are throwbacks- they'll still wear the 'Nique era throwbacks. The idea here is to include a dash from every era of team history.

AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Falcons44,6,Tue Jun 23 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"This is a good opportunity for me to reiterate that NO ONE knows what the Hawks will do. This is a notoriously quiet organization when it comes to leaks, and that stands here."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"As far as moving up, I think Stanley Johnson could be a name to watch and if Willie Cauley-Stein falls, that is intriguing. Moving back is trickier, simply because this is a very deep draft (at least in my opinion), but the Hawks could easily be short on roster spots depending on how free agency goes and the status of Edy Tavares."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:05 2015 UTC,Want to echo what Brad is saying. The Hawks usually play everything close to the vest. I imagine they have explored a number of possibilities in regards to moving up and back in the draft. Just depends on who is available and who they are targeting.

I think they want to but the interesting thing to watch is that the Hawks haven't overpaid for anyone in the last three seasons. Will be interesting to see how high they will be willing to go.   A lot of the talk has centered on DeMarre, but it is Millsap that I'm afraid is going to get a max offer."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Falcons44,2,Tue Jun 23 22:16:51 2015 UTC,When you say you're afraid Millsap will get a max do you mean you'd rather pay DeMarre and not Paul or just that you think a max is too much for Paul?
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,jbtrackxc,3,Tue Jun 23 22:20:13 2015 UTC,"Let me elaborate. I don't know if the Hawks will be willing to pay the max for Millsap. I like both guys and think they are great fits for what Atlanta wants to do, but overpaying them would most likely be a mistake. I haven't really thought about choosing between the two, but I can think of a few guys who could potentially replace them."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,2,Tue Jun 23 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for taking the time to do this guys!"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:24:12 2015 UTC,We appreciate you guys having us. It is always fun.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,peejyluigi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"I know this is directed at Kris (and he can answer), but for me, a max is an overpayment for Paul AND he is pretty likely to get it."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,3,Tue Jun 23 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"With new uniforms and potentially the volt color, will the court colors change too?"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,thrashfan,6,Tue Jun 23 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"This was something that was brought to my attention earlier today. I hadn't really considered a change to the court being in the works since they changed it dramatically last season.   I haven't seen anything official, but it seems like that might actually be the case as well. I will be at the uniform unveil and will be sure to report anything I hear in regards to the court."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:19:04 2015 UTC,There were rumors of a charcoal color a while back. We'll hopefully see tomorrow.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:17:34 2015 UTC,I wasn't a huge fan of the navy outside border. Wouldn't mind seeing that modified.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Falcons44,3,Tue Jun 23 22:50:20 2015 UTC,I think that would be the area that is most likely to change
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,gvedak,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:53:34 2015 UTC,"I believe that the organization has said the court wouldn't change, but I may be making that up."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,3,Tue Jun 23 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Are the hawks drafting oubre if he is there at 15? I can't figure out why he hasn't gotten more chatter in hawks circles, but I guess it's just a foregone conclusion that he will be off the board? He is a great fit for the hawks"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"I've been pretty vocal in support of potentially taking Oubre at 15. He is (easily) the riskiest pick in the range IMO, but the upside is arguably the highest. This is a team that isn't looking for immediate contributions from the pick, and Oubre's ceiling is so high that it is justifiable to swing for the fences."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,gvedak,2,Tue Jun 23 22:36:53 2015 UTC,I was ready to take him in the SB Nation Mock Draft but he went off the board at No. 14.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Falcons44,3,Tue Jun 23 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"So I was talking with a fellow fan the other day and he brought up an interesting opinion that is in now way related to these current Hawks.   He said that if the Hawks had drafted Joe Johnson when they had the chance, rather than signing him to a huge contract that ASG fought each other over, the Thrashers might still be in Atlanta.   Do you guys feel as though the big issues for ASG, mostly financially, started with the Joe Johnson signing?"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"Short answer? No. I think the financial issues had a lot more to do with the individual owners being rich but not NBA owner-rich. In the grand scheme, Johnson's contract isn't breaking an owner, especially when you consider the salary cap and its built-in restraints."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,thrashfan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"From a non-financial standpoint, it certainly caused some fighting within the ASG. Still think it would've happened eventually anyway."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:58:30 2015 UTC,"No you have to remember that Johnson earned his first extension and then some while in Atlanta. It was the second extension that was the outlier.   I feel for Thrasher fans, but the dysfunction in the former ownership group was present at every level. I don't think a single move on the basketball side had any consequences on the Thrashers."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,3,Tue Jun 23 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"What players do you think the Hawks will pursue in FA?    How long before Schroder overtakes Teague in the line up, if you think he ever will?"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,thrashfan,2,Tue Jun 23 23:15:17 2015 UTC,Sorry about the delay guys
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:12:35 2015 UTC,Bobby Portis or Sam Dekker if both are available at 15?
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,5,Tue Jun 23 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"It's Portis for me. Without giving TOO much away, I wrote about Dekker in a piece that will post tomorrow, but I love Portis. He may be my favorite player in the 15 range. Think he's a solid combination of safety and upside."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,thrashfan,3,Tue Jun 23 22:15:03 2015 UTC,Spoiler alert: I don't like Dekker. At all.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,jbtrackxc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"Doh, I really like Dekker outside of his shot. Thanks, I'll take a look tomorrow"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"100% agree, as a big ten basketball fan, this dude is so overrated and if he stayed in school he would be a 2nd round pick next year.  Didn't show up to games throughout his entire career until this tournament."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Magmar_01,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"I think the point about his lack of consistency is accurate. One of the things I cover in tomorrow's piece, but there are a few more issues too."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:23:47 2015 UTC,"I like Portis. Think he has a lot of upside and would fit well into what the Hawks like to do on the offensive end of the floor. Not a bad one-on-one defender, but needs to improve his rebounding.   Great competitiveness though and that is something that Mike Budenholzer talks about all the time."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Magmar_01,2,Tue Jun 23 22:15:21 2015 UTC,What do you guys think the chances are a guy like Kaminsky falls out of the top 10. If the Hawks are indeed trying to trade up for him I am still not sold he will be there.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,note-to-self-bot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"It's a great question. First, I'm not sure he's a guy that is worth paying a large price to trade up for. Second, I do think there is a reasonable chance he lands in the top 10. I like Frank, but he's more of a mid-first round guy to me than any higher."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:24:28 2015 UTC,He is a guy whose stock has been all over the board but has been inside the Top 12 for most of the process. If the Hawks move up then they are targeting a guy that is high up their list. Kaminsky is an intriguing name as is Cauley-Stein or even a guy like Stanley Johnson who may be sliding just a bit.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,3,Tue Jun 23 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this, I think Cauley-Stein is probably the only guy in this theoretical range that I would trade up to get."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,3,Tue Jun 23 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"I also think he is the least likely of the ones mentioned to slide this far. From what we have heard about the Pacers, they wouldn't trade out of this pick if Cauley-Stein was going to be available."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:29:18 2015 UTC,My love for Moose has me being biased toward selecting Frank haha
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,2,Tue Jun 23 22:31:24 2015 UTC,"I think Kaminsky can play, but I'm not moving up to get him. Your point about Muscala actually would make it less justifiable IMO"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"We advertised draft and free agency questions, but if you guys have any questions in regards to Peachtree Hoops or SB Nation I'm happy to give my take there as well."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,thrashfan,3,Tue Jun 23 23:15:15 2015 UTC,"I value the work you guys do at Peachtree Hoops, you are really into it. I wish someone at ajc showed a bit more enthusiasm."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"So with the Hawks rebrand, will the PTH site also get a matching change in color scheme?"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,9,Tue Jun 23 22:31:48 2015 UTC,Good question. I got this
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,jbtrackxc,3,Tue Jun 23 22:34:56 2015 UTC,OMG
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,jbtrackxc,3,Tue Jun 23 22:35:47 2015 UTC,Hey guys! I found the guy who designed the Clippers new logos!
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:37:08 2015 UTC,I'm gonna have to let Kris handle this one. /ducks
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"Probably not until sometime down the road, but that is a great question. I was surprised how much the secondary logo and the Peachtree Hoops logo favored"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,OhhMarr3133333,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:33:13 2015 UTC,What are your guys' thoughts on Kelly Oubre? And would the hawks have to move up to get him or could he slip to 15? If the hawks do indeed try to get him.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"similar question below, but I don't love moving up for him if the cost is significant. It is possible he can fall to 15, but I think somebody will be tantalized by his upside before that and he'll go between 9 and 13."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,thrashfan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw it right after I posted it haha, note to self: always refresh and make sure your question hasnt been asked already before asking a question haha my mistake."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:47:57 2015 UTC,Just in case you forgot:  always refresh and make sure your question hasnt been asked already before asking a question
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"He is a guy that I think we as a group all like. There are some risks there, but a lot of upside. It seems like every year they come into the draft looking for wing depth and go a different direction.   He is an interesting guy that I haven't really seen projected to the Hawks a lot, but is usually projected in range of the 15th pick. I'd be happy with him at No. 15."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Magmar_01,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:41:07 2015 UTC,Did you find the Austin Daye 2015-16 commitment odd?
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,3,Tue Jun 23 22:40:28 2015 UTC,His contract is not guaranteed. He signed a pretty standard contract for a guy who is signed for the remainder of the season after signing a pair of 10-day deals.   This gives him a chance to go to training camp and compete and it gives the team the flexibility to keep him or walk away altogether.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,2,Tue Jun 23 22:43:09 2015 UTC,"Daye's deal is non-guaranteed, so they can basically release him at any point if my knowledge of the deal is correct. Basically locked him in for training camp, but if he can't make the team, he'll be let go with little to no penalty."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Magmar_01,2,Tue Jun 23 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"He's a guy with first-round pedigree and a very low cap number, and Bud must see something in him given the prior history in San Antonio and the fact that they brought him in. Could be a candidate for the 14th/15th spot on the roster."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"Got it, makes perfect sense."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:42:55 2015 UTC,Friend of mine brought up a hypothetical scenario. Would you rather have DC and Millsap or LaMarcus Aldridge.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,deadjournalistdotcom,2,Tue Jun 23 22:45:19 2015 UTC,"Aldridge is an interesting name, but I will take guys the caliber of DMC and Millsap over a single player just about everytime"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,BTRowland,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"DC and Millsap in a vacuum for me. I like Aldridge, but he is overrated by some because of the raw numbers he has put up in Portland."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,OhhMarr3133333,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:45:56 2015 UTC,What about Gasol?
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,deadjournalistdotcom,3,Tue Jun 23 22:48:08 2015 UTC,Sign me up if he is really willing to leave Memphis.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,OhhMarr3133333,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:51:00 2015 UTC,"that one is closer, and you have to tell me who is playing small forward before I can answer it :)"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,OhhMarr3133333,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:48:51 2015 UTC,"It is probably still DC and Millsap because of Gasol's age (30), but I value him higher than LMA"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"If available in the second round, should the Hawks pick up RJ Hunter?"
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:50:41 2015 UTC,I can't see him slipping to the second round. I think he'd be a reach at 15 but think someone in the Top 30 grabs him up.  Saw some reports today that suggested his stock was on the rise
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:52:06 2015 UTC,"I think I saw a report saying he was working out with the Wizards today, but that may have been my imagination."
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:53:36 2015 UTC,Hunter has landed in the lottery in some mocks. Divisive prospect.
AtlantaHawks,3avs7i,tacotoosday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:56:47 2015 UTC,"The Hawks pick at 50 and 59 (as of now), and Hunter is NEVER going to be available at that point. I think RJ should be a late-1st/early-2nd round guy, but he's probably going in the top 20 and could go even higher."
AtlantaHawks,3aximz,JerryLangford,2,Wed Jun 24 08:12:14 2015 UTC,Anybody up for a new uniform up-caw party?
AtlantaHawks,3aximz,Raydioactive,3,Wed Jun 24 12:00:06 2015 UTC,SO FRESH! Can't wait to order mine
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,RP336,11,Wed Jun 24 01:37:24 2015 UTC,I just want my yellow back  .  please
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,dakane328,11,Wed Jun 24 02:10:54 2015 UTC,Neon anything is fucking terrible.
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,Martinsek,3,Wed Jun 24 02:06:07 2015 UTC,Not the neon I hoped for but honestly it will stand out and bring attention to a team that has been boring for years and I love the unis 100x more then our last set so I don't mind. It will grow on me.
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,bearg0d,2,Wed Jun 24 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that it hurts the design. Unless its in very minor touches, like maybe a bit of piping on the collar and shorts. The Xmas jersey had so much neon tho."
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,thrashfan,2,Wed Jun 24 01:50:32 2015 UTC,I like it. I'm just tired of people calling it green and not yellow. It's a great trim color.
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,ATLBlazer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:41:24 2015 UTC,"I can't decide if I like it until they unveil the jerseys, but I don't have a good feeling about it. I just don't see how neon could go with red and blue. Hopefully they surprise me."
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,WildBananna,2,Wed Jun 24 01:52:30 2015 UTC,How are the current unis perceived to most fans? Personally I hated when they became a blue team.  Growing up I loved the Nique era unis and I think should just go back to those.
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,WildBananna,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly like the current ones, but I don't have anything against them. I do agree that the older ones were a good amount better, though."
AtlantaHawks,3awh0b,poerhouse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:31:45 2015 UTC,Blue is retired. No more blue at all.

AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,waitrewindthat,3,Tue Jun 23 15:36:26 2015 UTC,I'm hoping it's more of a neon yellow than green

AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,GT2018,5,Tue Jun 23 16:59:44 2015 UTC,Tbh i wouldnt mind an alternate like that
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,Tomahawkchop14,2,Tue Jun 23 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe as an alternate, maybe, but not as the primary. I realize that's only an alternate for Baylor though (not their primary). I kind of like the idea of being the only NBA team with neon but it's very hard to pull off."

AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,mfoste34,3,Tue Jun 23 21:04:42 2015 UTC,yeah pretty sure koonin cited them when discussing our future color scheme/jerseys
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,bearg0d,3,Tue Jun 23 21:34:53 2015 UTC,Really wouldn't call that green. This is essentially Nike's volt/Oregon yellow.
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,cosmo_bear,2,Tue Jun 23 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"it's very clearly a mix of green and yellow. volt green when googled is basically highlighter yellow, which this is not:  https://www.google.com/search?q=volt+green&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=MYuJVZWXLNHtgwS3hoG4BA&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&biw=1920&bih=1003"
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,jbtrackxc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:37:38 2015 UTC,It could look more volt like on the jerseys. Volt uselly doesn't look the same when rendered.
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,padawaner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:06:12 2015 UTC,true and every monitor is different. for me it looks like a flat light green.
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,padawaner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:15:38 2015 UTC,I believe volt yellow it the color were rumored to be using not green.
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,padawaner,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:37:51 2015 UTC,"volt yellow and green both show up as highlighter yellow according to google, and that is not what hawks.com's color looks like."

AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:41:33 2015 UTC,In the numbering? I think the yellow/green is just for contrast and to stick out.  The triangle pattern? There's a chance that works its way in as a motif somewhere in the uniforms.
AtlantaHawks,3au8x4,AlmightyDaq_,3,Tue Jun 23 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"The color will make it. It's definitely not just for ""contrast"".  By your own argument if they use the pattern why not the color. Why that color? Why not regular yellow? Or a flat green like the 70s jersey? That color is there for a reason. It's the future of our color palette."

AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,woahwoahwoah8,9,Wed Jun 24 03:44:54 2015 UTC,I'm terrified at the thought that Pop retires and Bud takes over as HC of San Antonio.
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,justcamp,5,Tue Jun 23 17:38:17 2015 UTC,Messina is already in place as the coach in waiting for pop
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,whoopthattrick84,2,Tue Jun 23 20:33:08 2015 UTC,thats why we need to build something here so he has no reason to leave before pop retires
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,atomsej,2,Tue Jun 23 18:19:40 2015 UTC,Bud is coach and president coming off the franchise's best year in 50+ years and he's in the East. Why would he drop everything he's built here for a more scrutinized spot (following a top 3 NBA coach ever) in the cutthroat West and probably lose his president title?
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,AtlantaHawks,3,Wed Jun 24 01:08:59 2015 UTC,Yeah. Why follow in Pop's footsteps when you could be the best Hawks coach ever.
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,Shade_Raven,0,Wed Jun 24 01:24:21 2015 UTC,The Hawks are traditionally unimportant in the larger scope of the NBA.  They have always been in the shadow of whatever powerhouse dominates their conference.  What does it matter to be the best coach ever of a team with only a minimal list of accomplishments?
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,justcamp,-2,Wed Jun 24 01:35:19 2015 UTC,Bud called San Antonio home for 20 years and had a hand in building the culture there.  Why stay in Atlanta where he's unlikely to secure a star?  Why stay in Atlanta who has a notoriously fickle fanbase?  Why stay in Atlanta with a long history of poor ownership?  Why stay in Atlanta where Bud has to rebuild everything he already built elsewhere?
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,justcamp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:41 2015 UTC,Because he doesn't have to build much more. They were in the ECF and the attendance was in the top 15 all year.
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,abesrevenge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"That's absurd.  If Sap and Carroll leave, we are back to square one.  What Ferry/Bud have built is a good foundation, but you're naive to think that they have built a San Antonio-like juggernaut that will run the East for the next 20 years."
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,justcamp,3,Wed Jun 24 05:07:43 2015 UTC,he also has the whole head coach/gm thing goin on. he's pretty much his own boss. that's big
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,mackwon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:58:47 2015 UTC,"He's not going to be GM this year.  Also, that is not a recipe for success in my opinion.  Coach and GM can have competing interests."
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,justcamp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:08:17 2015 UTC,"And when did I say they built a Spurs like domination? When Duncan, Parker, Gino, and Pop leave the Spurs are also back at square one. The Hawks promoted him to President which he quickly accepted. I don't think he would take on that much responsibility if he planned on leaving next year. The Hawks will sign Carroll or Sap, just not both. I am not so sure the Spurs are that much better of a job right now. They aren't exactly overflowing with young talent."
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,abesrevenge,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:05:37 2015 UTC,"You said there's not much left to build.  That is a ridiculous statement.  Also, have you ever turned down a promotion?"
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,justcamp,5,Wed Jun 24 12:09:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that they'll be willing to pay him quite a bit given his record, especially since the new management seems more committed to the team."
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,newmannewaccount,2,Tue Jun 23 15:48:17 2015 UTC,He will be getting his money. The new ownership just needs time to take over and it will be their first priority.
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,abesrevenge,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:54 2015 UTC,You are high as hell if you think they won't give him a long term deal. He's the best thing to happen to Atlanta since the Braves of the 90's or The Varsity.
AtlantaHawks,3au6gi,Matt2486,0,Wed Jun 24 20:56:02 2015 UTC,I would be shocked if we don't give him a huge contract. Only way he wouldn't get a huge contract is with a terrible season this year (like single digit wins - 100% not happening) or some kind of scandal (99% not happening).
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,Decatur_Psalm,2,Tue Jun 23 23:35:51 2015 UTC,"He'd be awesome for us. His shooting and defense are much improved. I bet this coaching staff could do a lot with him. Super athletic, great size, great passer, fun to watch. People who think he wouldn't fit haven't watched him since he's been in Sacremento. He bullies people in the post and goes for boards. Can get his own shot if need be. He has swagger. He's coming off his best season yet so I don't know what the asking price would be. George Karl loves speedy point guards though..."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,ajg47,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"That'd be too much to give up Dennis at this point. He's young and plays a big role in our lineup now. If he goes to that shithole he won't be the same guard he is in Atlanta.   Gay is a better shooter than most people think he is. He's definitely showing signs of improvement all around and could be a guy like Korver, where he peaks later on in his career.   I think he would be a solid replacement for Carroll but I wouldn't pursue him just yet unless management knows that Carroll is for sure leaving. I don't think Gay will be off the market by the time July 10 hits anyways."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,Intercepting,3,Wed Jun 24 16:39:33 2015 UTC,pretty much the last player in the NBA that I want on the hawks
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,broeho,2,Tue Jun 23 23:43:48 2015 UTC,he wasnt that bad last year.  who would you want at the wing if demarre leaves?
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,ajg47,2,Tue Jun 23 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he was awesome last year. His shooting percentages are slightly lower than Carroll's but Gay takes more attempts and averaged 21 pts a game. Gay also has the edge in assists, rebounds, blocks, and ft% for those into that stuff. Would be nice to have a wing who can create his own shot and find guys like Korver."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,ajg47,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"yeah his biggest knocks were his volume shooting at the cost of efficiency and his contract. the contract is no longer an issue, so it's mostly the other one, but i'm sure the coaching staff could do a good job fitting him in and improving his shooting mechanics as we've done with other players.  his 3pt% wasn't even terrible last year, it was around 36% which was better than jeff teague and paul millsap."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,broeho,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah and in Memphis, Conley and Gasol weren't as refined yet so Rudy was shooting A LOT. In Sac he's still working without quality teammates (besides Cousins). Our system stability and quality players could do wonders. I would be on board if we got him by chance, but not screaming from mountaintops for us to get him."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,Crcsoccer1,0,Wed Jun 24 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"I don't really know who is realistically available this summer, I just really don't like Gay's style of play... I think he's pretty clearly a bad fit for ATL."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,justcamp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:03:24 2015 UTC,This would be a bad idea
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,justcamp,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:45:56 2015 UTC,Where would we magically get the cap space to fit Rudy?
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,justcamp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:36:15 2015 UTC,"since it's a trade we just need to send enough outgoing salary so that the difference fits within the cap or match salary entirely. it wouldn't be impossible since his contract is only around 12 mil, the harder part is giving sacramento enough in terms of actual value, that may include mike scott, our draft picks, and/or one of our point guards"
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,justcamp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"I thought Rudy's cap hit was 19 mil for another year.  It's still a tight squeeze to try and cram another 12 mil contract before re-signing Sap.  That said, I would rather give Rudy 12 mil this year rather than DeMarre considering the explosive offense he can bring, however the contract could become a JJ type albatross in a few years."
AtlantaHawks,3aw2rj,goamateur,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"cap is going up, 12 mil wont be anywhere close to what joe's deal was."

AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,meep6969,7,Tue Jun 23 01:33:33 2015 UTC,"Good discussion here boys, well try this again tomorrow"
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Raydioactive,2,Tue Jun 23 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"What are your reasons for portis? Personally, I'd like to spring for a wing. I'm not sold on anyone in particular yet though"
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Atownbomber,3,Tue Jun 23 12:02:54 2015 UTC,"I saw Portis play in person vs Uga this year. I loved the way he played, commanding the ball on offense, and just straight dominating Georgia on the glass. He can shoot a little bit too and Uga had to be aware of where he was on every possession or else they'd get burned."
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Raydioactive,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"Very cool. I just feel with Millsap (who I think we are definitely bringing back) Horford, Moose, and Tavares (who we may be bringing over) as well as Scott, our front court is crowded. I also think Demarre is going to get an absurd offer and leave so I was hoping we would focus on the wings.   Portis does look really solid from what I have seen though so I'm not against it by any means"
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Atownbomber,2,Tue Jun 23 13:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that the front court is a little crowded (If we bring back Millsap), but it was exposed in the ECF for lack of size/rebounding. Edy has some, but is unproven. Moose isn't going to start dominating the paint anytime soon, so another big wouldn't hurt. I would prefer a center or a scoring guard, but if Portis is the best available, take him."
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Raydioactive,3,Tue Jun 23 13:36:56 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head with ""best available"". I would prefer us just acquiring talent and figuring it all out when the time comes."
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Shade_Raven,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like we could pick up any wing player in FA and they would do just as well in Buds offense, then again I could be completely wrong"
AtlantaHawks,3as2hx,Shade_Raven,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:41:19 2015 UTC,The best we could hope for is probably Portis or Myles Turner
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,childishdorito12,4,Mon Jun 22 16:21:57 2015 UTC,:'(
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,Wong-A-Donger,4,Mon Jun 22 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"Kind of indifferent to this. On one hand Ferry did a good job of assembling this team with good contracts, but on the other hand, I felt that he has had a pretty poor draft record."
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,Bankingitbig,4,Mon Jun 22 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Well, missed on Payne, Jenkins, and Bebe. Hit on Scott, Muscala, and knocked it out of the park with Schroeder. Could have been better, but found more value in the second round than most teams."
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,cosmo_bear,2,Mon Jun 22 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"""Hit"" is a strong word here as none of them but Schroder are likely to be starting for the Hawks anytime soon.  Dennis certainly has star potential but Muscala and Scott are pure rotation players at the moment.  I've always seen the draft as an opportunity to bring in an impact plays and Mike Scott and Mike Muscala are not those things."
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,PiKappaFratta,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Mainly because I define ""hit"" in the second round as finding a rotation guy."
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,cosmo_bear,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:38:31 2015 UTC,Too early to say on Payne but regardless Bud has a better eye for talent
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,ajg47,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"Well, we missed on Payne is what I mean. Hopefully he works out for the T'Wolves, but he's about to be stuck behind KAT."

AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,meep6969,5,Mon Jun 22 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"you realize that without the nique years we probably dont even have a team right now, right?"
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,Decatur_Psalm,-6,Mon Jun 22 22:09:06 2015 UTC,Uhh yeah we would? Nique wasn't even the best player we've had and he didn't get us out of the second round
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,meep6969,4,Mon Jun 22 22:13:49 2015 UTC,ok so just another troll.  pettit didnt even play in atlanta and not getting out of the 2nd round had hardly anything to do with nique.

AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,jknox94,-6,Mon Jun 22 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"Is he still playing for us? No and his comments about how our organization is run is bringing us back into the mediocre hawks, last time I checked Nique didn't get us to ECF, the team Ferry put together did"
AtlantaHawks,3aq3v0,meep6969,8,Mon Jun 22 18:50:47 2015 UTC,Nique still has a big presence in the organization.

AtlantaHawks,3an5dc,usmseawright,7,Sun Jun 21 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"He delivered a message at Passion City church yesterday morning and obviously brought his family there too. They set up basketball goals and he shot against a father, a young kid, and then Kent Bazemore. The preacher asked him if he forgave Delly (he hasn't).

AtlantaHawks,3ags53,ATL_GritzBlitz,-2,Sat Jun 20 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"Because I only have so much sporting money to go around, and I'm not giving it to a pussy ass owner group.

AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,C-Jammin,14,Thu Jun 18 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Shame, but the article seems to mention that the new GM, Wes Wilcox, helped Danny Ferry put the team together, so hopefully he learned a lot during Ferry's time with the team.   I'm a little worried about making a coach the president of basketball operations though, when has that ever ended well? I am not being facetious, I really want to know. All I know about that is that Doc Rivers was(is?) president for the Clippers and he screwed that up royally."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,T64dw4n,7,Thu Jun 18 15:23:19 2015 UTC,The greatest example of it working is in San Antonio with Popovich. Hopefully Bud learned a thing or two about balancing the two roles while he was there.
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,crice937,2,Thu Jun 18 15:59:02 2015 UTC,Oh well then it all makes sense...I had no idea Pop did it in SA.
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,T64dw4n,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"He is still Pres. of Basketball Ops., I believe, but handed GM duties over to R.C. Buford in the early 2000s"
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,Golai77,6,Fri Jun 19 04:51:47 2015 UTC,"The article seems to mention that the new GM, Wes Wilcox, helped Danny Ferry put the team together, so hopefully he learned a lot during Ferry's time with the team.   You know, I might be reading between the lines a little too much here, but honestly in this interview from last year (sort of near the end) it sounds like Wes Wilcox and his team were the ones doing most of the legwork all along, and Ferry's main role was just to approve or reject whatever plans they came up with for the team. I know most Hawks fans are upset to see Ferry go, but I honestly feel really good about having Wilcox as his replacement. If nothing else, it should actually make it easier to attract free agents, just in terms of the fact that Ferry had a reputation for being gruff and impersonal, whereas Wilcox seems much more like someone players would gravitate to personality-wise."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,aghaud,5,Thu Jun 18 16:25:09 2015 UTC,Seems to me like they're trying to go full Spurs mode
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,First-Mate_Wiggles,2,Thu Jun 18 16:16:16 2015 UTC,Pop does both pretty well.  I trust Bud to handle things well plus it'll help having Wilcox to work with
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,hecrey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah and honestly Bud has knocked all the non-basketball stuff he's done out of the park, most notably the way he handled the Thabo/Pero thing and also the DeMarre not coming back into the game thing. Bud really showed up as a team first guy who supports his players and doesn't feed the media or throw away the locker room."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,mtmv2,13,Fri Jun 19 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"if ferry ends up in cleveland beating us in ECF's for years to come with some latvian motherfucker making a half mill a year and shooting 45 percent from three im'a be a mad motherfucker, until then....well i'm still mad.  but bud is what really matters."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,jatl,4,Thu Jun 18 17:13:23 2015 UTC,What a shame.
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,jouelle1,4,Thu Jun 18 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"I was all gung ho for keeping Danny Ferry for a long time but I did read an opinion a few weeks ago basically saying; if you are a new owner and you have to listen to the opinions of 1,000 people and 950 of them say Danny can stay but 50 of them are screaming RACIST at the top of their lungs, is that something they really want to deal with?   I say no. The folks calling Danny Ferry out are a lot louder than the ones saying he should stay, regardless of who it is saying what.   It's unfortunate, but it's the way it is."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,jperez3209,6,Thu Jun 18 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"I can see their angle of why they want to part ways with Ferry. Guessing they don't want players to say ""oh this guy said that Deng has some African in him/is a racist"" and decide not to come to Atlanta as a result.   Even though I'm sure 90% of the players are fine with him now (most of them probably didn't care in the first place), it's a damn shame he's being fired. Guess they're promoting Bud so there isn't a huge uproar about the firing."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,Intercepting,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:53:06 2015 UTC,I guarantee you that the new ownership can care less right now what players think about Ferry. 100% the main reason they are doing this is so they can have good PR right off the bat and not be known as the people who 'let Ferry keep his job'
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,atomsej,0,Fri Jun 19 00:40:06 2015 UTC,"yep...these new owners are business men, they understand the importance of good PR...same with Steve Koonin, he's worked hard to change the culture of the team and this sort of thing hanging over their heads would have tarnished that"
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,T64dw4n,2,Fri Jun 19 01:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the decision to get rid of Ferry, but I had no doubt that he was going to be forced out when new ownership took over. That said, I'm a big fan of the move to give coach Bud more power and the promotion of Wes Wilcox to GM. If Ferry had to go this is how I wanted it to go down."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,cosmo_bear,3,Thu Jun 18 16:06:49 2015 UTC,I posted this exact link before this (I think you can check my profile to see this is true). I don't particularly care but maybe the moderators would like to know in case some bot is randomly deleting posts. Just something to look into
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,Raydioactive,6,Thu Jun 18 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"That being said, here is my comment from my post:   Honestly, I was hoping they would put this behind the organization, realize the mistake, and let Ferry come back. I'm upset we are losing him because he was instrumental in putting this phenomenal roster together. The bright side of course is that we are committing to Budenholzer and it looks like we are going to have a great coach for many more years. Can't wait to see what the future holds"
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,Raydioactive,2,Thu Jun 18 15:18:24 2015 UTC,"I really agree that I wish that the organization could've learned from the mistake with Ferry onboard, but I'm also happy to see that Wilcox is getting the promotion since he seemed like such an integral part of this FO team."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,HawksInTheBay,4,Thu Jun 18 15:27:50 2015 UTC,"Fine, i trust our management now. Never said that before."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,Matt2486,2,Thu Jun 18 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"I hate this for Ferry but this is fantastic news for the future of the Hawks if you ask me. In the the back of my mind, I've been a little worried that Bud may leave at somepoint, maybe for the Spurs job after Pop retires, but more power for Bud could keep him here for very long time which is something I want. However, it is a big risk to give a coach too much control, but it has worked in the past for teams in both the NBA and NFL. I believe in Bud though, I think if anyone can succeed at it, it's him."
AtlantaHawks,3aajqd,ATL_GritzBlitz,2,Thu Jun 18 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like for someone such as Bud, giving him this much control is great. I think that they discussed with Bud and he has a vision where he wants to take this team. Having a president that differs from Bud's views would only cause friction."

Dude would be invaluable in scouting european prospects over the next few years."

AtlantaHawks,3abktd,nikesoccer,5,Fri Jun 19 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"Short list of how I think we make the finals: -Get Marc Gasol: my highest priority -Sign Danny Green -Sign Demarre through bird rights, if we go over the luxury then so be it, -let bud draft who he wants  -bring over Tavares -let every other free agent walk including Paul"
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,Crcsoccer1,2,Thu Jun 18 21:21:26 2015 UTC,Love this potential starting lineup with Al actually at the 4!!
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,paybe_mossibly,0,Thu Jun 18 21:40:35 2015 UTC,Al couldn't guard Sap. Ideally I'd like to keep them both in the starting lineup and sign a couple of big nastys to come off the bench when we need to go big. We can replace Carroll by drafting Portis. Let Scott pero and brand go and then go get me a 2 that can actually create a shot with korver coming in off the bench.
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,jalapenobusiness1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:02:33 2015 UTC,"This is my dream scenario. Gasol is a huge priority in my book. I love Al, but I don't think we can win a championship with him as starting C. He can overpower PF's and I feel like he's fast enough to guard them. Getting Danny Green as another 3-and-D guy would be awesome as well."
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,theDrunkWookie,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"We can't go over the cap to resign Demarco.  We have his early bird rights which limit the amount we could pay him. Anything over that amount to has to fit into our cap space. On my phone right now so I don't recall the exact amount,  but it's not very much."
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,drsmith21,5,Fri Jun 19 04:28:15 2015 UTC,you are the new Hawks GM   Oh shit I guess I should put some pants on
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,noodlejabb,3,Fri Jun 19 13:46:17 2015 UTC,"I would trade Mike Scott to free up cap space. Not sure what we'd get in return, probably a 2nd. Then I would draft Portis to fill his roster spot and because Bobby looks good at 15. I would let Elton and John walk in free-agency and do my damnedest to re-sign both Paul and DeMarre.  If that is impossible I would sign-and-trade one of them in order to get something back for their services, preferably a 1st in this years draft. If Sap is the one to go I would make a run at Greg Monroe.  But lets assume I keep both of them. With any existing cap space I would offer Edy the league minimum and make a run at Danny Green because he's a damn good fit here, and a short-term replacement for a possibly falling Korver."
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,thrashfan,2,Thu Jun 18 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"Ideal situation at the end there. Sign Edy low, keep Trill and Demarre and Danny Green would be brilliant here. Not sure that's at all possible seeing as Demarre initially looking to be over 10mill/year, but god willing.."
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,thrashfan,2,Thu Jun 18 21:07:10 2015 UTC,Letting go of Scott will release over 3 million in cap space. If Sap takes 13-14million for the first year deal we might swing it. Somehow.
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,dawgsfan1,2,Thu Jun 18 21:13:53 2015 UTC,True dat. Hoping this actually becomes reality then. Seems like the ideal scenario to me.
AtlantaHawks,3abktd,Persuasive_Penguin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:15:56 2015 UTC,I make it a priority to resign Demarre Carroll

AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,dawgsfan1,24,Thu Jun 18 16:38:34 2015 UTC,Ok well I have $20. Who wants to pitch in?
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,jknox94,7,Thu Jun 18 18:22:53 2015 UTC,crazy how hes had a 6 year career and he can make 6 times his total earnings in his next contract
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Decatur_Psalm,5,Thu Jun 18 17:25:28 2015 UTC,i wish him luck i really do and i hope someone pays him that money even if it isnt us . he deserves it.
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,JustinG1000,4,Thu Jun 18 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"If that's all he wants we should pay him. He's improved so much in 2 years, in a year this will look like a steal. Particularly if we do something like 10/12/14/14."
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,e6matt,2,Thu Jun 18 20:12:43 2015 UTC,Reverse that and I'll be okay... more cap flexibility in the future is better than more flexibility now... especially if we aren't going after a big FA this year
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Capn_Barboza,2,Thu Jun 18 21:26:58 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. The cap will be growing exponentially over the next few years.
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Wong-A-Donger,9,Fri Jun 19 20:33:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i don't think he's worth that....I love him as much as the rest of you, but that nearing max contract money."
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Matt2486,-5,Thu Jun 18 19:42:55 2015 UTC,Not really...
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Matt2486,11,Thu Jun 18 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"He's been in the league for 6 years.  The maximum amount of money a player can sign for is based on the number of years that player has played and the total of the salary cap. The maximum salary of a player with 6 or fewer years of experience is either $9,000,000 or 25% of the total salary cap (2013–14: $14,670,000), whichever is greater. For a player with 7–9 years of experience, the maximum is $11,000,000 or 30% of the cap (2013–14: $17,603,700), and for a player with 10+ years of experience, the maximum is $14,000,000 or 35% of the cap (2013–2014: $20,537,650).[10] There is an exception to this rule: a player is able to sign a contract for 105% of his previous contract, even if the new contract is higher than the league limit.[11]"
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,jhey22,3,Thu Jun 18 20:27:36 2015 UTC,I think he's absolutely worth that. And I'd say there's a good chance he'd take a little less to stay in Atlanta.
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Crcsoccer1,3,Thu Jun 18 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"Let him walk. Sign gasol, Danny green, Replacement for Demarre, and draft pf, fill in other gaps with the other 2 draft picks"
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Capn_Barboza,5,Thu Jun 18 20:08:31 2015 UTC,Isn't Danny Green more of a 2 than a 3 defensively ?
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,paybe_mossibly,6,Thu Jun 18 21:28:07 2015 UTC,Absolutely and not a replacement for Demarre.
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,Jameisisabitch,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:33:03 2015 UTC,He's more than capable of Ding up the 3
AtlantaHawks,3aav5w,GT2018,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:50:03 2015 UTC,"Pay him. I'd rather just keep everyone together for one more year and add some role players in free agency and the draft. We were so close last year, and I really think we would've gone to the finals if we hadn't had so many injuries down the stretch. I really don't want to change things up unless maybe if Gasol is a lock to sign with us."

AtlantaHawks,3abxbm,Crcsoccer1,3,Thu Jun 18 21:15:19 2015 UTC,prob best explanation you will find on the internet
AtlantaHawks,3abxbm,Decatur_Psalm,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"This is great, I'd love it if the Hawks could snag Thompson"
AtlantaHawks,3abxbm,Intercepting,2,Fri Jun 19 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"To keep Lebron, Love, and Irving, they'll have to go over the cap. Smith is half retarded and probably will find a team who'll pay him pretty good money because of how hot he can get in a hurry. Shumpert will be paid pretty nicely and I think it'll be by the Cavs because he has the potential to become a starter and not a 3 and D guy.  Resigning Thompson would surely push the team into the luxury tax. I think they'd be stuck with Dellavedova as their backup point guard because they couldn't afford anyone else at this point, unless they wanted to break the luxury tax record. And to pay that much of a luxury tax for only one season (with the cap expected to jump), maybe Dan Gilbert will decide to go all in and try and buy himself a championship, which the Nets owner (Russian guy, forget his name) failed to do. But this is an entirely different situation and you don't have four aging stars... in fact, they'd have the exact opposite (if you think Thompson is a star).  By the way, Mozgov is also going to become a free agent and he's going to surely demand something in the 8-14mil range after the playoffs and time he had in Cleveland.   I guess they could try and trade Varejao, but I doubt anyone would want to take on that contract without the Cavs giving a pick or something in return. He's paid too much to be a backup, sort of like the situation with GS and David Lee.  TL;DR - it's a fucking mess and I would not want to be a part of the management staff in Cleveland because it's going to be tough to resign all of those guys... unless Dan Gilbert decides to open his wallet and let them spend as much as they want, of course."
AtlantaHawks,3abxbm,PootieTooGood,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:32:07 2015 UTC,that's a really bad analysis of where we're at. go check the cavs sub for realistic plans.
AtlantaHawks,3abxbm,DemonicDimples,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:58:10 2015 UTC,Mozgov has a team option. Cav's still have MLE to offer a back up point guard.
AtlantaHawks,3abxbm,TrocarSlushWeasel,2,Fri Jun 19 23:08:14 2015 UTC,"With Thompson , love, and Lebron all wanting max contracts   Good grief."
AtlantaHawks,3a934o,Lionhearted09,2,Thu Jun 18 05:02:57 2015 UTC,Afford being the keyword here... At the right price and contract length they're sure to bring him back... if he wants his max worth at this time they should oblige him by letting him walk
AtlantaHawks,3a934o,Capn_Barboza,2,Thu Jun 18 13:23:30 2015 UTC,Yup. Milsap isn't the only player out there that can fill his role.
AtlantaHawks,3a934o,beefsupreme,0,Thu Jun 18 14:27:03 2015 UTC,But he is the only available player that can fill his role at a price point the Hawks can afford.

AtlantaHawks,3a934o,Capn_Barboza,2,Thu Jun 18 15:35:28 2015 UTC,Let him walk
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,JPR231317,10,Thu Jun 18 12:31:22 2015 UTC,"At the very least: Top 3 seed in the East, conference semifinals. If we get Gasol or Aldridge, #1 seed with at least conference finals appearance."
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,Tomahawkchop14,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:46:02 2015 UTC,And if we lost either Paul or DeMarre?
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,thrashfan,0,Thu Jun 18 21:02:08 2015 UTC,Both: 4-6 seed One: 3-5 seed
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,Tomahawkchop14,6,Thu Jun 18 22:37:05 2015 UTC,It's almost impossible to say without having any idea what the squad will look like
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,teh_centurion,6,Thu Jun 18 13:52:30 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, the biggest improvement from players in Bud's system is between year 2 and 3. So, assuming we keep Millsap (I think Carroll is cashing in elsewhere, which he has earned) we will definitely be a top 3 seed. If the improvement is as big ans I have read, and our draft pick hits, I think we will be challenging the Cavs for the one seed. But that would require a lot more things going our way that are tougher to control.  Question for you: If you retain Love, even with how good you all were in the second half of the season, do you think the Cavs defense will be good enough to win a championship? That is my biggest concern for your team right now."
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,Raydioactive,0,Thu Jun 18 14:59:29 2015 UTC,"I think so, our defense was pretty good, it was mostly what won us the two games in the Finals, aside from LeBron. And usually, because of Loves poor defense, we would have TT in late anyways. An example would be Kyrie's 57 point game, he didn't play the last few min. of regulation."
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,Raydioactive,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was more referring to having a league average defense during the strong run in the second half of the season. Blatt did well I think and he will likely figure it out, but I think it's going to be tough to balance the offensive firepower of love and irving when they bring so little to the other side of the ball. It can be done of course and I think it is completely fair to assume the will be the one seed, just something fun to look for next year"
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,beefsupreme,2,Thu Jun 18 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"Well an off season without Ferry is scarry to say the least.  I'm not saying Bud CAN'T do it but its his first time being head hancho so its up in the air.  If we can resign at least 1 of Demarre or Milsap and find a couple more pieces, we are right back where we were this year.   If not, who knows."
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,callmerevan,2,Thu Jun 18 17:30:36 2015 UTC,If by some grace of god we get Gasol and retain Demarre I fully expect to be 1-2 seed. Lose both Paul and Demarre (basically no chance of this happening) 6-7. Keep Paul lose Demarre and rely on the draft to fill his spot 2-3. Lose Paul keep Demarre 3-4.
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,chessbrah,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"I think the team and coaching staff learned a lot from this season. We can't peak too soon because we just aren't the type of team that can turn it off and on. I expect a decent start to the season but nothing crazy like the run we had mid season this year, but will finish stronger leading into the playoffs. Probably end up with 50-55 win and a top 3 seed."
AtlantaHawks,3aa1k6,thrashfan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:45:23 2015 UTC,Its going to be very interesting. If we lose either Millsap or Carroll and dont upgrade in our replacement of them we will fall. 4-5th maybe.  Also consider that the Korver we know may be gone forever thanks to Delly's fat ass.

AtlantaHawks,3a7q3y,thrashfan,3,Thu Jun 18 00:10:37 2015 UTC,Lebron with Kyrie and Love healthy and in sync could be rough.
AtlantaHawks,3a7q3y,AYoungOldMan,13,Wed Jun 17 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"everyone keeps saying this. I honestly think losing Kyrie and Love helped them vs Atlanta.  Love spaces the court but isn't a mismatch on anyone like Thompson was and Kyrie can't defend Teague and is a class act, were as Delly can't defend Teague but CAN put everyone on tilt with the shit he does. I think Kyrie's scoring wasn't as useful to them as Delly drawing fouls and ire was.  I think Atlanta was its own worst enemy this playoff season and still overachieved. If the right things happen this offseason I am not worried about the Cavs. The Spurs lost to LeBron too once... once."
AtlantaHawks,3a7q3y,mehjbmeh,2,Thu Jun 18 00:18:17 2015 UTC,Rumor is Love wants out.
AtlantaHawks,3a7q3y,WhenIDipUDipWeDip,2,Wed Jun 17 23:34:00 2015 UTC,doesn't matter if he does or doesn't. The facts are that their cap situation makes it VERY tough for them to keep both Love and Thompson. If they do swing it they'll have to mortgage their future.
AtlantaHawks,3a7q3y,mehjbmeh,2,Thu Jun 18 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"Love doesn't want out at all, he's stated this several times. It will be tough to keep cap though, gunna have to pay luxury tax."

But I think Bud is too big on Pero to let him leave, and we've got young bigs who need minutes to develop so signing a guy like Lee would not be helpful.

AtlantaHawks,39y7n5,myatl,2,Mon Jun 15 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"I like both the wordmarks but I don't understand why they have one type of ""A"" for the ATL and another ""A"" for Hawks. I would prefer consistency. Someone did point out the A in the ATL seemed to be paying homage to the A's the team had in the past. In this link under the jersey logos you can see something similar from '99-'07"
AtlantaHawks,39y7n5,Raydioactive,2,Tue Jun 16 12:03:07 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess we will see new uniforms on Thursday. That will be a week before the draft. They've definitely done a great job of not leaking anything.
AtlantaHawks,39y7n5,mfoste34,4,Tue Jun 16 16:20:33 2015 UTC,Yall can hate on the secondary logo but these word marks actually look really good

AtlantaHawks,39xpyi,HawksMod,2,Mon Jun 15 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"Shelvin was ok, I think that he is potentially a little underrated and didn't receive much playing time. He had that crazy game where he shot the lights out but if he's an unreliable shooter he fits in well as a 3rd string PG imo."
AtlantaHawks,39xpyi,furycutter80,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"He did deserve a little bit more playing time, but I understand the staff wanting to develop Dennis and give him the experience. Dennis has more potential, while we know what Shelvin has and can give us. So when he was really needed that's when we played him. And seeing how the Hawks won 60 games this season we just simply didn't need him much. I mean a lot of people put Dennis above some of the starting PGs in the league this year. When you have a top 10 and a top 30 pg on the same team it kinda makes sense the 3rd string doesn't get much PT. I'm really happy that he did make good use of his time when he did come in though."
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,HakeemNOlajuwon,3,Mon Jun 15 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"Probably thought free throws were easy and didn't require any practice when they're one of the things that most players practice the most  They're called ""free"" for a reason. not sure why anybody wouldn't shoot 50-100 each practice."
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,Intercepting,3,Mon Jun 15 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"But he shot relatively decently the first 8 years of his career (5 years 69% or higher), anything happen between year 8 and 9 that would've caused the 10-20% dip? It just seems strange that someone's free throw shooting would go down that drastically after being relatively consistent for 8 years."
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,ajg47,5,Mon Jun 15 22:48:04 2015 UTC,It's just Josh Smith.
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,Intercepting,3,Tue Jun 16 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yep. Knowing him and all of the talk about him in his contract year, he probably got the idea that he could turn into some sort of fucking hybrid of Lebron James and Ray Allen and become the greatest player of all time"
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,cripplercrawlspace,3,Tue Jun 16 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"In his early days as a Hawk, Josh would split his time between the 3 and 4 spots, but became a full-time 4 as things progressed. The full-time switch was sometime around 2008 and the strength/weight he gained to accommodate the switch was very noticeable. My thinking is that the added strength threw off his mechanics and he doesn't practice FTs enough to fix the issue."
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,paybe_mossibly,2,Tue Jun 16 07:37:01 2015 UTC,Seems like the best analysis.
AtlantaHawks,39y83k,beefsupreme,3,Wed Jun 17 15:27:36 2015 UTC,He seemingly didn't practice anything but dunks in the offseason.

He's said it's hard for him to add weight, so hopefully he can get that going this off season.

One of the coolest things that happened this post season."
AtlantaHawks,39tiuf,fuzzyllama1,9,Sun Jun 14 18:06:07 2015 UTC,Easily one of my favorite moments this year. That play fell apart and went through a massive mood swing as moose got it and let it go. Moose is the man. So clutch. Fuck Paul Pierce
AtlantaHawks,39tiuf,thrashfan,2,Sun Jun 14 18:20:08 2015 UTC,Being in PA I didn't see him play all too much but when I did he showed signs of improvement and he was playing with a lot of energy!

AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,Vituperat,4,Fri Jun 12 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Idk how trades work, but if we got Marc gasol somehow, I'd be down to trade Millsap for gobert"
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,duhpolan,4,Fri Jun 12 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"Well, there are sign and trades, but I don't believe bird rights transfer in that scenario anymore. So, there's kind of no point to them anymore except for cap reasons."
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,cosmo_bear,2,Fri Jun 12 19:37:24 2015 UTC,"...Not quite something I think the Jazz would want. Gobert looks like piece they want to build around. And because Millsap is a UFA he really would only agree to sign a max with us (since we can offer slightly more money, I believe) if we were to trade him to a destination he wanted to go to."
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,Raydioactive,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:41:00 2015 UTC,I'm not sure we could resign Millsap and Gasol in order to trade Millsap.
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,cosmo_bear,2,Fri Jun 12 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Could do a sign and trade, but no one ever gives up anything significant in those."
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"Sign and trade wouldn't be advantageous for anyone considering we can't give him the fifth year on his next contract, which is generally the reason for sign and trades."
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,cosmo_bear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:41:00 2015 UTC,I don't think players can get a fifth year in sign and trades anymore. Didn't the last cba do away with that?
AtlantaHawks,39mb8r,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"You know, I think you're right since Melo wasn't available for trade until some point half way through the season. S&Ts really don't make sense nowadays unless cap holds would make a signing impossible."

AtlantaHawks,39lnz4,duhpolan,14,Fri Jun 12 16:35:11 2015 UTC,I think he said he was just going to let the case play out in the court system. He hasn't tried to blow this whole thing up either because he said he wants to remain professional about the situation. Really support the way he's handled it so far.
AtlantaHawks,39lnz4,Intercepting,4,Fri Jun 12 17:11:20 2015 UTC,"Nba news is different from the regular news you see on tv, and with the finals going on you probably won't here anything till the offseason"
AtlantaHawks,39lnz4,meep6969,8,Fri Jun 12 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"Sure it's different, but a black guy got his leg broken by the police. Which he NEEDS for his PROFESSION. To be clear, I'm not on that hype about police victimizing black people, but the media sure is, so why isn't it being covered, even if it's NBA news? What I'm saying is, it is more than NBA news basically lol. But my main concern is what is going on with Thabo right now"
AtlantaHawks,39lnz4,slurpyderper99,-2,Fri Jun 12 17:44:56 2015 UTC,Ted Turner man.
AtlantaHawks,39lnz4,aghaud,6,Fri Jun 12 23:18:37 2015 UTC,Court date this Tuesday
AtlantaHawks,39lnz4,AYoungOldMan,2,Fri Jun 12 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"It's a PR game at this point, The Hawks don't want any bad press with new ownership and a new front office coming in. The sports world is preoccupied with the NBA and NHL finals. Thabo's lawyers don't want anything blowing up until they go to court. I'm sure he'll take legal action, but until that point comes there's really more to lose than there is to gain by trying to make it a large media narrative at this point. Give it time, I'm sure you'll hear something."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,PiKappaFratta,19,Fri Jun 12 18:41:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but Marc gasol and letting go of Millsap is probably our best bet at being contenders. Millsap is great, but we need an upgrade on this roster. Def keep demarre tho  If Millsap can step it up just a bit, I think it'd be great but at this point he's just a solid 14/7 (not sure about his real stats) kinda guy seems like."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,duhpolan,5,Fri Jun 12 19:20:46 2015 UTC,Sap is pretty much a lock for 18/8 and he adds ~2 steals which is solid at the 4.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,justcamp,2,Fri Jun 12 19:32:16 2015 UTC,Plus a great defensive rating
AtlantaHawks,39m705,fuzzyllama1,9,Fri Jun 12 19:52:19 2015 UTC,I think the point is: he doesn't suck.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,justcamp,2,Fri Jun 12 19:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that wasn't the question. While I love Millsap, Marc Gasol would be a huge upgrade imo."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Vituperat,-4,Fri Jun 12 20:59:13 2015 UTC,Conversations don't always revert to the base question big dawg.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,justcamp,41,Fri Jun 12 21:51:11 2015 UTC,Marc Gasol
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Tomahawkchop14,25,Fri Jun 12 19:17:01 2015 UTC,And it's not even close.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,justcamp,3,Fri Jun 12 19:31:41 2015 UTC,But we would wish Paul the best!
AtlantaHawks,39m705,mehjbmeh,8,Sat Jun 13 15:14:13 2015 UTC,Gasol. We'd have to let Millsap leave though. He can't play small forward. We'd probably move Horford to PF and possibly work out a sign and trade with someone to maximize on losing Paul
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Raydioactive,0,Fri Jun 12 19:21:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if Horford can guard stretch-4s
AtlantaHawks,39m705,KickedInTheDonuts,10,Fri Jun 12 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think he can. He does well guarding pick and rolls and stretch 4s aren't necessarily quick, they can just shoot. Horford is really versatile and his ""natural position"" is at 4. Now as we all know Horford can ball at center but his pick and pop game along with smart passing and solid defense makes him a very plausible PF. I can only think of a few 4s he might have trouble with honestly.  Do you have any in mind that he couldn't guard? I just can't think of many but I may be overlooking someone"
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Raydioactive,2,Fri Jun 12 19:47:45 2015 UTC,Horf couldn't guard Millsap.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Shade_Raven,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:43:00 2015 UTC,Touche
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Raydioactive,3,Fri Jun 12 22:53:12 2015 UTC,He'll lose weight if he moves to the 4
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Shade_Raven,3,Fri Jun 12 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"Keep Demarre,sign Marc, draft Sam dekker, and we win the free agency"
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Crcsoccer1,5,Fri Jun 12 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"In terms of salary cap, I just can't see Gasol happening unless we lose both Millsap and Carroll. That doesn't exactly sound ideal to me, and since Millsap and Carroll both seem like they want to stay (and since our front office seems to agree), I prefer to stay loyal to our guys. I mean, if everyone had just stayed healthy during this year's playoffs, the Hawks would probably still be playing right now. I don't want to disrupt that.  Now if Millsap and Carroll decide they're going to leave the team and get paid no matter what, then that's a different story. Getting Gasol would be a hell of a Plan B, and I'd be fully on board with that. But honestly, it doesn't seem realistic to expect that we'll be able to just swap out Millsap for Gasol straight up. Unless we also cut loose a couple of other players, the numbers just don't add up IMO."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,aghaud,2,Fri Jun 12 20:04:21 2015 UTC,Kind of off-topic but where did you get the impression that Carroll wants to stay? I've seen Paul hint at it but I've never gotten the same impression from Demarre. Hope you're right but I've been getting the feeling he's going to leave.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,noodlz05,2,Fri Jun 12 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"He tweeted the other night during the fourth quarter, when the Warriors were taking control, something along these lines of ""The answer is simple, team ball"". That gave me the impression that while he might not stay with the hawks, I doubt he is going somewhere like Cleveland, where it's LeBron ball and company."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,johnofga,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:27:07 2015 UTC,"I just always got the impression that he had ""bought in"" for good, if that makes sense. I'm pretty sure he's made comments to that effect, but I can't remember specific examples, I'm afraid. Obviously I can't know for sure what's in his head. I guess we'll see.  Please stay DeMarre!"
AtlantaHawks,39m705,aghaud,3,Fri Jun 12 21:24:43 2015 UTC,Marc Gasol
AtlantaHawks,39m705,BlitzArchangel,2,Fri Jun 12 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"Seems like I'm in the minority here, but I don't think Gasol is a good fit for the system we run, especially since Horford would have to move to the 4. Marc Gasol is a better player than Millsap, but I think this team gets worse by adding him. Just my opinion."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,noodlz05,4,Fri Jun 12 20:46:36 2015 UTC,The thing about Gasol is he could fit in anywhere and I do t think we would get worse by adding a player who was a legit MVP candidate for the first half of the season.
AtlantaHawks,39m705,bearg0d,3,Sat Jun 13 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"i can't think of a better center for the offense that budenholzer likes to run than Gasol. if you don't think he's a good fit, who do you think would be a better one?"
AtlantaHawks,39m705,broeho,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"I think the opposite.   It's clear the Grizzlies have a strong defense with a mediocre at best offense. Inserting someone used to playing defense that good in the West, with our offense system, is a good choice."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,Rundy2019,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:44:56 2015 UTC,Gasol
AtlantaHawks,39m705,cosmo_bear,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:32:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like Gasol is a direct upgrade from Millsap. Millsap has probably been my favorite Hawk this whole season and the most consistent in my mind, but i would still take Gasol over him."
AtlantaHawks,39m705,atomsej,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:55:20 2015 UTC,Gasol. Omg could you imagine Horford playing at PF instead of at center all year?
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,jjdore20,8,Fri Jun 12 14:56:02 2015 UTC,Yeah kinda seemed like a pro-wrestling move to me. For show.
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,SirSwerveAlot,11,Fri Jun 12 15:53:08 2015 UTC,"With all the talk of moving the camera guys back for injury concerns, I simply cannot believe that the best player in the world and most important player to his team would throw his body and risk injury in that position."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,justcamp,4,Fri Jun 12 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think as he is going down he is thinking of the camera man though. Lebron has been bitching about not getting calls for the series, so in his mind he may anticipate the need to sell this one more than others."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,justcamp,-3,Fri Jun 12 16:13:50 2015 UTC,You're naive to think that players don't know exactly where they are on the floor.  No way would LeBron purposefully lose control of his body there.
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,greensmurf30,4,Fri Jun 12 16:15:15 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt he doesn't know where he is, I doubt that at that moment his mind is concerned where the camera is in relation to him."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,Intercepting,2,Fri Jun 12 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He was very off balance trying to save the ball and he just lurched forward. The chances that he actually could have saved it were pretty slim, but it's the finals - leave nothing behind."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,ajg47,2,Fri Jun 12 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"He went head first into the camera. It's hard to regain your balance when you lean forward and you shift your momentum in front of you.  Getting a cut on the head can hurt pretty bad, but nobody knows how bad it felt except for him. As for the security people pushing away the cameras and the person cussing out the camerman Lebron ran into, I think that was a little over the top."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,drsmith21,5,Fri Jun 12 17:14:38 2015 UTC,"He did get cut up and I'm sure it hurts but holy cow was that over dramatic. The whole rocking back and forth, writhing and yelling, pushing away all the broadcast cameramen. Over the top."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,ajg47,9,Fri Jun 12 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he wasn't the one pushing away the cameras at first. You could hear on the broadcast a woman say ""we don't want the cameras on him"" when he first went down. And I think the dramatics ended the moment he got a 2"" gash in his head. Everything after that looked like legitimate pain. Especially once he noticed his hand was covered in blood he freaked out a little bit. He did overplay the contact and that resulted in hitting the camera, but after that it seemed like it really fuckin hurt."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,whoopthattrick84,4,Fri Jun 12 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"I've seen far, far worse injuries with far less ridiculous antics. We all have. Plus, this is coming from a guy who regularly uses theatrics on touch fouls. Do the cameras need to be pushed back? Of course. Did it probably hurt a lot? Yeah. It was still way too much. We've seen Curry and Klay (who had blood leaking from his ear) with far more serious injuries and very little reaction just this postseason. He tries to sell every thing that happens to him, it's just a fact."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,justcamp,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"I've never had any head injury like that so whatever I say is probably a load of crap, but I feel like it would be one of those things that stings like hell the minute it happens and sort of just goes away on its own as the night goes on."
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,Ben_Afflock,3,Fri Jun 12 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"nah dude, falling down without control head first into the edge of a camera really, really hurts. you don't need to have experience a blow to the head to understand that. this is such a reach"
AtlantaHawks,39l9o0,red__falcon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems like you're right. I just envisioned it as more of a sharp, stinging, cut than something like being bludgeoned in the side of a head with a rock."

I didn't like the Warriors for cockiness mostly, but seeing Lebron cry after LITERALLY EVERY PLAY that doesn't go his way makes me wanna punch his future grandchildren. Add in Delly (which is obviously biased) and the crap he pulls. He isn't a dirty player, but he's an instigator that I know the type too well when I play in tourneys and pick up. Annoying as shit, acts like they are innocent in everything and just gets in people's heads. Really not there to play basketball, at least the guys I play with.  Edit: Just kidding, I'm just salty still"

AtlantaHawks,39ix4c,thrashfan,3,Fri Jun 12 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"That's funny, today is also the first day I've accepted what happened and can enjoy the game without blaming the Cavs.  Also lebron is literally putting up historic numbers, hard to outplay that."

AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,Armond404,2,Wed Jun 10 21:00:09 2015 UTC,He was courtside during Game 5 against the Wizards! My friend and I were able to spot him from 311 with that unique fashion sense haha. Gotta love Thugger.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,dogblood,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:13:14 2015 UTC,I saw him court side at game 1 of the ECF too - the yellow hair and crazy dress makes it easy to spot!
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,Buc07,-3,Thu Jun 11 12:01:07 2015 UTC,Young Thug sucks. His voice is atrocious and his rhymes are beyond simple. Not anything I listen to. It is cool however that he's giving us some exposure. I'm fine with teens jumping on the bandwagon cause maybe that way we will be able to get national attention and garner some respect.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,CDub22EP,11,Wed Jun 10 14:50:21 2015 UTC,You don't listen to Thugger for his lyrics or rhymes. His music is perfect for a summer kickback or party but you dont listen to his stuff expecting a deep message or poetry
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,Buc07,-4,Wed Jun 10 19:36:36 2015 UTC,Nah.   Outkast >>>>
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,thosepoorfolk,11,Wed Jun 10 22:52:23 2015 UTC,Lol outkast are living legends of rap you its not even fair to try to compare young thug to them. If you don't like his music that's fine but you don't have to tell other people their opinions are invalid.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,Buc07,-3,Thu Jun 11 00:07:18 2015 UTC,Lmao when did I say his opinions were invalid? I said I disagreed and that Outkast filled all those roles better than Young Thug. Don't be the feels police and make sure everything everbody says is polite and politically correct.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,WKWA,4,Thu Jun 11 13:40:38 2015 UTC,Yeah man I wish he was more like Hopsin or Mackelmore and spit that real shit.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,Buc07,0,Thu Jun 11 16:46:07 2015 UTC,Hahaha good one man!
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,bearg0d,4,Thu Jun 11 18:37:58 2015 UTC,Yeah he is very polarizing. I personally enjoy his voice but his lyrics are so damn bad.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,tabelz,5,Wed Jun 10 14:53:50 2015 UTC,Yeah nobody listens to young thug for the lyrics. It's his flow and voice that are interesting.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,slugga_slugga,4,Wed Jun 10 18:46:35 2015 UTC,His stuff is melodically interesting to me. this track is potentially my song of the year.
AtlantaHawks,39aw5k,bearg0d,6,Wed Jun 10 19:32:15 2015 UTC,I've had this song on repeat since it came out! The whole Jamie XX album is great

AtlantaHawks,398yq9,duhpolan,17,Wed Jun 10 02:55:44 2015 UTC,Draymond set an illegal screen first but Delly was definitely wrong for that.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,bearg0d,27,Wed Jun 10 05:02:59 2015 UTC,"Delly's a dickbag, but the thing that upsets me most is how effective his tactics are. It's clear he had Horford and Teague on tilt most of the time and that took them out of their game, now he's doing it to the Warriors.  Unless the Refs start punishing him or someone goes straight Hockey goon on him I expect he'll keep upsetting dudes and taking advantage of them being out of proper mind."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,mehjbmeh,2,Wed Jun 10 04:10:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly, i've been saying that on the warriors subreddit but you can't get away from /r/nba lebrine dick riders. Cleveland  is a disgusting team that is nothing more then lebrons ego trip."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DatDissonance,-6,Wed Jun 10 17:43:44 2015 UTC,Best Hawks team ever swept by LeBrons ego?  Guess that's why he's the king!
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Givesgoldforhimym,4,Thu Jun 11 02:26:27 2015 UTC,"Sadly yes, twas a combination of  refball + dirty players + lebrine postups and the hawks not playing well. Lol at lebron pushing that nickname for a decade. Any king who says im the king is no king at all."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DatDissonance,-11,Thu Jun 11 03:04:40 2015 UTC,you sound like a child
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Givesgoldforhimym,3,Thu Jun 11 03:12:13 2015 UTC,no the best Hawks team got swept by injuries and didn't have a wealth of acquisitions ready to step in and follow a superstar.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,mehjbmeh,2,Fri Jun 12 00:07:27 2015 UTC,U just need someone to do the same thing on him. Every team has a disposable player that should play this role.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Celtic-pride,0,Wed Jun 10 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"It's not like Green is some saint. His moving screens are also dangerous. He injured shump, he has tried to injure Delly on several occasions, and he whacked lebron in the face. These guys are playing dirty against Delly, and he's saying get the fuck away from me.  The funniest one was when he grabbed shump with one hand and Delly with the other for a curry screen. One guys arm and one guys leg. If your Hawks were playing against the Warriors, you would be losing your shit. Plus that screen in the video was bullshit and he flopped."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DeanBlandino,41,Thu Jun 11 17:58:47 2015 UTC,Looks like he just threw a body check into Draymond Green's butt after getting hit with a hard screen. You may be projecting your frustrations here.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,king_lloyd11,9,Wed Jun 10 04:27:18 2015 UTC,True. I hated him after the Hawks series but he has won my respect. Guy plays hard. I can't help but like him.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,KickedInTheDonuts,-30,Wed Jun 10 19:56:24 2015 UTC,Don't get in the way of the 13yo's venting their teen angst.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BellamysManson,39,Wed Jun 10 04:44:18 2015 UTC,such a little bitch
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BackstageChip,36,Wed Jun 10 03:34:35 2015 UTC,"As a massive Hawks fan who has gotten over the fact that he did some skeezy shit to our guys, THIS is not what it looks like. Seriously, if you think this is some dirty shit then you need to readjust what you watch the game for. This guy is a little shit who gets picked on constantly and now that he's fighting back we want to brand him. I saw what he did to Korver, this is nothing close. I'm a fan of the game itself and what I see is a guy giving every fucking thing he has for his team every play. It's crazy how many times he has fought for the ball. Champs or not, Lebron is going to look back on this year and see that this was the team of pickems who didn't quit. Delly got popped so he popped right back, nothing more."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,mapex_139,6,Wed Jun 10 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"He got popped in the shoulder, so he retaliates by popping Green in the knee? Nah, that's a lousy response."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,MrCleanMagicReach,5,Wed Jun 10 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"Watch it again, he shoulders his ass/upper thigh."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,mapex_139,2,Wed Jun 10 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"He started to get up, and then intentionally dropped back down slightly for the hit. Where the final contact was made is irrelevant. His intention was there to go low."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,MrCleanMagicReach,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"I liked Hawks fans till they started hating on Delly, he is the last player who is dirty."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DuncanDonuts32,0,Thu Jun 11 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but still fuck Dellavedova!"
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,chessbrah,4,Wed Jun 10 21:05:02 2015 UTC,WTF what a little shit
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,padawaner,20,Wed Jun 10 04:09:08 2015 UTC,Draymond knocked him over on a dirty ass shove. Delly retaliated.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,ProbablyMyLastLogin,12,Wed Jun 10 05:00:38 2015 UTC,Kinda like when Horford retaliated?
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,nerdyintentions,7,Wed Jun 10 13:29:21 2015 UTC,"well no thats different because delly has like crazy hustle and is such a gym rat and wow how can you rag on a guy like that? He is probs a bit better than lebron, just incredible effort on that little guy."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,jjdore20,-10,Wed Jun 10 18:04:44 2015 UTC,well he didn't drop a pussy like elbow
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,PootieTooGood,6,Wed Jun 10 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Nope, he just hurled himself toward another man's ass."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,nerdyintentions,-4,Thu Jun 11 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"Lol. ""Hurl."""
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DeanBlandino,3,Thu Jun 11 18:02:36 2015 UTC,I don't see how Cleveland praises him so much.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Intercepting,3,Wed Jun 10 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"As much as I dislike the guy, he lays it all out there for his team."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,k34ts,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:32:02 2015 UTC,Because he's proving to be an instrumental cog in a potential NBA title winning season..
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,MTT92,-19,Thu Jun 11 02:02:51 2015 UTC,Because we aren't looking at him through the goggles of salt
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,PootieTooGood,14,Wed Jun 10 04:43:24 2015 UTC,Fuck off
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,SidBreamTrackTeam,4,Wed Jun 10 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"Normally I would be rooting for a guy like this, but not after all these fucking dirty moves.  Play ball man c'mon now."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Falcons44,13,Wed Jun 10 04:01:45 2015 UTC,Tanya Harding goes for Draymond's knees  FTFY
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,gtatlien,12,Wed Jun 10 04:00:38 2015 UTC,"He clearly pushed into his lower back, no where near his knees."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DemonicDimples,3,Wed Jun 10 04:40:50 2015 UTC,This.  Report released before the game that Draymond had a lower back injury.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,LAXlittleant26,13,Wed Jun 10 12:11:10 2015 UTC,Green did throw an elbow (all of the Warriors players set illegal screens) but it still doesn't give Dellevadova the right to go after his knees.... again.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Buc07,5,Wed Jun 10 04:27:12 2015 UTC,Wish he would stop going for the legs and I am not comfortable at all with this but: That little pig f*cker has brought it over and over again. He is playing so far above what I would have thought was his ability and he has my grudging respect.  Fuck him but respect as well. I despise him even more for forcing me to acknowledge that he has showed up in a way no one on our team did. Carroll came close but Delly is beyond that in terms of bringing it at this point. Little goat loving shit that he is.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,cwolfe,3,Wed Jun 10 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"Illegal screen that didn't get called. Honestly I would have done the same thing. Delly might be a little dirty but with the way NBA officials miss stuff he's getting away with what's being allowed. He's a smaller, less-skilled guy trying to set the tone and make his impact in different ways, and his coach, Blatt, endorses his borderline-pest behavior. I almost like him and hate him at the same time. I at least understand why Cavs fans love him."

AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BMC4,9,Wed Jun 10 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"Why do cavs fans feel the need to go on other teams subreddit to defend this dude? Like seriously, you or your like were never ever in here unless it was a hawks v cavs gameday."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,beefsupreme,-1,Wed Jun 10 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"Why can't other fans be here? I didn't say anything bad and wasn't trolling, I just want to discuss it"
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BMC4,5,Wed Jun 10 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"Not saying to can't be here, I was just curious why you felt the need to defend this guy."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,beefsupreme,-3,Wed Jun 10 17:10:19 2015 UTC,Delly? Cuz I like him and he isn't really in the wrong here
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BMC4,7,Wed Jun 10 17:15:47 2015 UTC,Going around to random places to defend a guy you don't even know is a bit crazy.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,beefsupreme,-1,Wed Jun 10 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"Huh? We all watch basketball, we all love our team. Do you know Al Horford? Or Korver? But you still love watching them and defend them. That argument doesn't make sense to me"
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BMC4,8,Wed Jun 10 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"Defending him on r/cavs (orwhatever), r/warriors or r/nba is normal. Going out and finding random subs to defend him in is bordering on obsession."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,beefsupreme,2,Wed Jun 10 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I just like checking out other teams subs, and you guys were having a discussion about someone on my team, so I wanted to chime in"
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,BMC4,5,Wed Jun 10 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"There have been a bunch of obnoxious cavs fans filling the sub and just spewing shit. You're not one of them, but a lot of people are getting fed up with it."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,jjdore20,2,Fri Jun 12 15:53:59 2015 UTC,I still have flashbacks from what that dirty weasel did to korver. and now /r/nba treats him like the messiah instead of a common thug that should be put down like a rabid dog.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,DatDissonance,2,Thu Jun 11 12:22:33 2015 UTC,What's little piece of shit. I hope the whole NBA hits him hard next year.

AtlantaHawks,398yq9,CptnSaveAHo,-26,Wed Jun 10 05:25:53 2015 UTC,"You're the ones that have tried to defame someone who has done nothing wrong. Dellavedova did nothing wrong against Korver, Horford, nor here. You lost and you're still mad about it and feel like you were somehow robed of something by Dellavedova. You were swept by a better team that out worked and out hustled you and Dellavedova was a big reason why. If you don't want Cavs fans here stop talking shit about our players."
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,ShyKidFromCleveland,32,Wed Jun 10 05:32:59 2015 UTC,I'm a Thunder fan that lurked over from /r/nba. Just found it funny you told them to enjoy another 40 win season when they haven't missed the playoffs in 8 years while your team is one year removed from having 4 seasons without 40 wins
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,CptnSaveAHo,-28,Wed Jun 10 05:40:05 2015 UTC,They had not made it past the second round until this year. I think it was a flash in the pan.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,ShyKidFromCleveland,15,Wed Jun 10 05:43:17 2015 UTC,I'm convinced they can still be better. I don't think they've had as solid a coach as Coach Bud in a while. I think the attention they gained this year can help them bring in some big free agents which is also something they haven't been able to do in a long time. Idk if they'll have the same success they had this year again next year but I wouldn't be surprised if they made it to another ECF within the next couple years or maybe even a finals appearance.
AtlantaHawks,398yq9,CptnSaveAHo,10,Wed Jun 10 06:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we're not one player away from being a lottery team."

AtlantaHawks,398yq9,Dat_Foig,0,Wed Jun 10 07:22:26 2015 UTC,It doesn't even look like Delly does anything more than throw a shoulder/elbow into the lower back AT MOST. Draymond set an illegal screen and then when Delly was getting up he moved his right leg back trying to block Delly more and then seemed like he stepped on Delly's foot trying to move away.  Some of you guys really need to grow up and learn to put things in the past.

You don't want arguably the GOAT on your team? You don't want to always be a powerhouse team? I've already seen multiple people say they don't want Lebron. Well lemme tell you something, whoever doesn't want Lebron fucking James on their team needs to be checked into a mental hospital. He's by far the best player on the planet right now and we would be in the finals getting ready to play tomorrow instead of sitting at home with our thumbs up our assess."
AtlantaHawks,398cql,jbtrackxc,2,Thu Jun 11 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"I mean I don't want to win with another team's hand me down crutch. Lebron belongs to the Heat. He defined his legacy with ""The Decision"" instead of sticking in Cleveland and grinding it out to get his ring(s). Now, he's back in Cleveland out of guilt. He realized that he took the easy way out (teaming up with fellow allstars in Miami so that they can check off that box beside ""Ring"") instead of staying faithful to his home town. Yeah, he'll probably go down as the GOAT but he'll be remembered mostly for his years in Miami. Every team after that will be like a crappy little league team that couldn't win on their own and had to bring in a ringer. I'd rather win with quality guys that are selfless, that play as one, than win by bringing in somebody to save us because we're too pitiful to do it ourselves. Thats the fuck I mean ""not like that""."

Tristan Thompson gets off on skinny white guys, so he meets Mike Muscala in a southern Ohio gas station for a little glory hole action.   JR Smith has a tattoo fetish, so when he walks into his local tattoo parlor and sees Mike Scott getting inked, he can't resist giving him a BJ at the same time.   Everyone knows the only reason Kyrie went to Duke is his insurmountable attraction to old white dudes. He sees coach Bud at a bar drinking away his sorrows after the sweep and demands to be 'recruited' like Coach K did to get him to Duke. Or maybe he and Thabo meet and leg rehab and there is a spark that leads to a romp on the exercise equipment.   LeBron loves when guys cut backdoor, so he's obviously madly in love with Kent Bazemore, who is the master of going back door and slamming it home.

DeMarre reveals he is a submissive and an exhibitionist, so Bud starts teasing him during games.  Schroder challenges Teague to a game of 1 on 1 after practice to try and prove himself to the starting PG. Vivid descriptions of contact during the game follow and then they release all their sexual tension in the shower together.  Pero visits Thabo in the hospital post-NYPD and vows his love and loyalty to Thabo. After his visit he gets a call from the hospital that NYPD has kidnapped Thabo. Pero goes on a Taken-like mission to find his friend and experiences a lot of confusing feelings along the way.  End with a full team orgy after they win the 2015-2016 finals.

The old owners have no reason to shell out however many millions of dollars remain on Ferry's contract when they themselves are heading out the door. The new owners will have to be the ones to buy out Ferry's contract, and they can't do that until they officially own the team -- i.e. the day before the draft.  Come to think of it, the date of the handover might itself be a significant sign that Ferry is on his way out. They might have decided that the night before the draft would be the most low-key time to buy Ferry out, since everyone's attention would be occupied with the draft anyway, and it would attract less media attention. Not to mention the fact that the whole rebrand thing is supposedly going to occur around the same time. I guess we'll see soon enough."

AtlantaHawks,38vzth,AlmightyDaq_,3,Sun Jun 7 08:12:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, Have never posted on Reddit. Decided to make an account just for this subreddit (I usually lurk).   I wanted to express a certain opinion I'm not so sure is common (?) I feel as though we would be better off with our starting five remaining for next season, perhaps we don't need a Marc Gasol. I feel as though our starting five can take us to the championship, and it's our best bet, perhaps this is the general consensus but from talk lately it seems as though everyone is alright with letting 'Sap walk and obtaining someone else. I'm thoroughly convinced that what we have in Atlanta right now is special, and that we should just let it be and ride it out."
AtlantaHawks,38vzth,FiftyShadesofpiss,2,Sun Jun 7 08:58:58 2015 UTC,"We need height. One of the main reasons we lost in the ECF is because we got WAYY out rebounded. We need a solid big man so that Al can be moved to PF. If we can't get a true big man or Tavaras can't perform, I am afraid we might just have another repeat."
AtlantaHawks,38vzth,FiftyShadesofpiss,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:57:46 2015 UTC,I also think it is very unlikely we keep the original 5 as Carroll will be up for big bucks and I would hope the Hawks don't over pay what he is worth.

AtlantaHawks,38vzth,davidsreddittag,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:51:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. We should go after Marc, but so is every other team. We need some height for sure, but I'm not sure we need to do any massive overhauling to our personnel. Edy will be a big help if he transitions well to the NBA, and we can find a new Brand replacement (he didn't play much last year, but he was playing big minutes with Al hurt two years ago) who is a true rebounding center.   Another facet to this argument is that I think Al and Millsap especially can be better rebounders. Sap was a great rebounder in college and Utah. I think if the rest of our roster develops more offensively, maybe we take the load off of Millsap offensively a bit so he can play more like a traditional PF rather than a SF in a PF body. Plus, this should keep him more relevant as he ages and loses his quickness."

For good reason, because the guy can beat 90% of defenders, especially if he gets a switch...which is remarkably easy these days. The problem lies in the last half of the equation, he just needs to get better at recognizing when to go up and when to pass out because the defense has collapsed.

I know LeBron and the Cavs just beat us but I can't help myself rooting for a huge underdog. Seeing LeBron somehow going god mode and willing the Cavs to a series victory would be amazing, as unlikely as that is. Also I think I'm jealous of the Warriors because as the two best teams of the regular season, they're having the postseason that I wish we could have had."

AtlantaHawks,38qpr0,atomsej,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"Teague was a top choice for me but I feel like his future with the team is less secure with Dennis emerging as a potential starter.

AtlantaHawks,38qpr0,koorob,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:08:30 2015 UTC,Millsap if he stays or Horford if millsap leaves. Always felt like Millsap was underappreciated especially jersey sales wise.
AtlantaHawks,38qpr0,KickedInTheDonuts,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"on the one hand, you want to get a jersey with a player that is locked into a long-term contract.  the mike bibby jersey i bought wasn't a good investment.  of course having been burnt by that, you feel like you got a player that there is no way in hell he could not be on the Hawks for the next 5 years, with literally an unmoveable contract, so i get a joe johnson jersey, and boom worthless again.    I'm holding 2 milsap jerseys right now and please god let him re-sign.    i think i'll go with BAZE and to represent for him re-signing DMC.  Moose was my close off the bench 2nd choice but I don't want to play too much into the white guys supporting the white guy on team stereotype."

I get we kept him around so new ownership could decide what to do with him, but it really was a disservice to him in the end. I can only hope new ownership looks at what the Hawks were while trying to win the conventional way. Praying to hit on a star in the draft, overpaying free agents to stay in playoff purgatory. It doesn't work. What Ferry and Coach Bud were doing works. I hope they find a new GM that meshes with Coach Bud. Otherwise, they've lost a fan and the franchise will return to obscurity."

AtlantaHawks,38qngi,thrashfan,3,Sat Jun 6 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"Good article. I hope that he opts to stay with us because he owes Bud and the Hawks so much with regard to his success. I mean, we're built like the Spurs and their guys stay."
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,Tomahawkchop14,40,Fri Jun 5 12:21:42 2015 UTC,Marc Gasol would be a dream.  We would have a true center for the first time in an extremely long time.  That would allow Horford to move to PF.  I think it would be a slight upgrade on offense and a huge upgrade of defense.
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,C-Jammin,12,Fri Jun 5 12:30:37 2015 UTC,Has Horford ever played PF in the NBA? I know his skill set fits the position but he's been a 5 for so long I just wonder how quickly he could adapt.
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,khalorei,13,Fri Jun 5 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"His offensive skill set already fits the 4 and while I think he is a solid defensive player, he gets outmuscled in the post by bigger guys.  He'd be on the big side for a PF so I think it would show up on defense pretty well.  It's what he played in college, so I think he could adjust to it pretty well."
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,C-Jammin,0,Fri Jun 5 14:47:04 2015 UTC,I just don't think Horford could guard elite stretch 4s like love or even draymond
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,ajg47,7,Fri Jun 5 15:29:48 2015 UTC,He wouldn't have that hard of a time guarding them (maybe Green). I'm more worried about them guarding him. He takes advantage of 5's because they don't want to close out on his jump shot and he's faster than them. 4's aren't afraid to guard midrange jumpers and have more foot speed. I think the whole Horford moving to PF is only a slight reward and a lot more of a risk than people think.
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,drsmith21,7,Fri Jun 5 17:11:06 2015 UTC,Gasol is very skilled in the high post though. It would allow Horford to take guys like Draymond to the low post and hammer them with that baby hook.   Horford vs Love is a battle i would have loved to see in the playoffs this year.
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,ajg47,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"That makes a ton of sense in theory, I'm just skeptical it'd work. Don't get me wrong, I'll still take Gasol, I just don't think Al moving to the 4 suddenly makes him a lot better."
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,NayOfThunder,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, Gasol's mid-range jumper is just as, if not more, wet than Al's. We could quite possible end up with the best mid-range big man combo in the league."

AtlantaHawks,38ns75,JustinG1000,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of lazy to look at the stats, but I was reading somewhere that Marc gasol isn't that much better on the boards than millsap or Carroll. I honestly would rather keep our team together because they'll definitely be hungrier. And if it doesn't work out, then they could just make some trades or even blow the team up. Remember, these past two years were upposed to be ""rebuilding"" years."
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,ajg47,0,Sun Jun 7 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"I'm super down, but only if we can't resign demarre and or Paul.

I would hate to lose one of our starters"
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,Sino13,2,Fri Jun 5 18:41:54 2015 UTC,idk if walter is ready for the nba yet and we really need a big that can rebound
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,VusterJones,2,Fri Jun 5 19:39:50 2015 UTC,He's a great rebounder and it's already been leaked that he's coming over this summer. He was a top 3 center in Europe last season.
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,tharoosta,-1,Fri Jun 5 19:59:10 2015 UTC,I feel as though the front office would never ever pay for gasol. Ever.

AtlantaHawks,38ns75,GT2018,-3,Fri Jun 5 16:44:58 2015 UTC,Were more than likely not going to pay Demarre the money he wants to stay. Marc is more expensive. Not gonna happen unfortunately.
AtlantaHawks,38ns75,BishonenOtaku,6,Fri Jun 5 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. The reason we wouldn't resign Carroll is we don't think he's worth the 10-12 million he's most likely going to get. Marc made around 16 million last year, so if we paid him 17-18 million, that would be completely worth the money considering what he brings to the table"

AtlantaHawks,38is4h,noitamroftuo,6,Thu Jun 4 14:22:56 2015 UTC,"yes.  bradley is worthless.  he says things to get clicks.  he is like skip bayless on a much much much smaller scale.  most often he goes for cheap heat and says he just loves what an atlanta team is doing.  either way, he presents no evidence that ""New owner likely to bring in new GM"" and actually uses the word ""guess"" so even ESPN is click bating  edit - just read the bradley piece, and i guess this is his evidence ""It’s whispered that, in preliminary discussions with incumbent Hawks executives, the Ressler (new hawks owner) camp has evinced no inclination to keep Ferry."""
AtlantaHawks,38is4h,beefsupreme,9,Thu Jun 4 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"If this turns out to be true... holy fucking shit.   I suppose this would be a classic ""such is life of an ATL sports fan""/"
AtlantaHawks,38is4h,koorob,5,Thu Jun 4 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"The 2 people that will decide this are Antony Ressler & Steve Koonin.  Nobody has any information whatsoever from either of those 2 about what they are going to do about the GM.  So we have no idea and these articles add nothing.  They are both smart guys, they know the pros of keeping an awesome GM, and the cons of the backlash from some people in keeping Ferry.    My prediction is they will hire a REALLY GOOD new GM and that is the announcement they will make.  That is the only way to have a winning outcome of this decision and they know that.  Basketball-wise all the Hawks fans will hate losing Ferry but if they hire someone who is definitively awesome then we'll all get over that in 1 second and get hyped for the new guy.  If they just said we are getting rid of Ferry and we got nothing else to say, then we're all pissed and disappointed.  The non-basketball fans who dislike Ferry because of the prior owners malicious actions will only be happy without Ferry.  So, the new owner isn't going to want to have to deal with that as his first order of business, unless he is looking to be a really outspoken kind of owner and pick a fight the first decision he makes.  Which it doesn't seem to me he is.  You have to go back to what Koonin said about our team this year and the demographics of who the fans are.  Antagonizing some small minority of outspoken people by keeping Ferry is a losing proposition for the team even though its the best basketball decision."

AtlantaHawks,38is4h,catrotica,2,Thu Jun 4 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"Ferry's comments were not as racist as they were made out to be.  He said that ""he [Deng] seems like the type of African to sell illegal things in the back of his shop"".  This is speaking about the continent of Africa, not a particular color of people.  There are white people living in Africa that could do this.  It is actually ignorant and more racist by people to generalize that everyone from Africa is black.  Plus, I assume this was said to other men, and if you are a man, you know you say things like this that are just meant as jokes and don't reflect your true feelings."
AtlantaHawks,38is4h,Falcons44,0,Thu Jun 4 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"oh boy.  Thanks for helping identify the Real Racist.  We all needed that.  BTW, even if you do say stuff like that in private, there is a big difference between doing that and saying it on a conference call at work.  No one in their right mind would say that in an office.  I love DF but don't sugarcoat it, he made a dumbass mistake."
AtlantaHawks,38is4h,Wong-A-Donger,2,Fri Jun 5 05:54:02 2015 UTC,"Sure he made a mistake, I am not denying that.  But to fire him over his comments is fucking laughable.  If you can honestly say you have never made a comment that could be taken offensive by anyone before, you must already be in Heaven.  He was reading off of a report that he did not make.  Sure he should have read the report before hand and excluded that piece, but you can't seriously blame only Ferry for this.  It is just upsetting to me that people who are not even being talked about (Americans) are feeling offended about comments made towards Africans, that could be white, black, and many other races. At the end of the day, Deng forgave Ferry for his comments.  That's the only thing that matters.  Why can't everyone else move on like Deng has already done."

AtlantaHawks,38is4h,GT2018,-2,Fri Jun 5 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this forever. Ferry absolutely will not come back. He said something racist. I know there's a lot of context, and he didn't really say it so much as quote someone else, but saying something racist is not one of those things where that stuff matters. The bottom line is he said something racist so he's done."
AtlantaHawks,38is4h,catrotica,3,Thu Jun 4 15:28:55 2015 UTC,I think there should be a distinction between saying something racist and actually being racist. No one actually thinks Danny Ferry is a racist. Shouldn't we focus on punishing actual racists and not blanketing any mistake as racist and immediately punishable?

I got this idea from an article reading our new uni will be comic book inspired one. You have no idea how glad i am to see our last primary logo finally meets its demise. To me the logo was nothing but a symbol of incompetence of the franchise, especially when it comes to attracting Atlantans it failed miserably. KEEP FERRY!!!! As a 20 year hawks fan, IVe seen nothing but an average team at best until Ferry took over as the teams GM and he has done a tremendous job putting together a very competitive team. I acknowledge he made a mistake last year so lets have him apologize for what he said and move on. I really want to see us win!!! I have no doubt in my mind you have all enjoyed this years hawk as much as i did if not more.   LETS GO HAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
AtlantaHawks,38hqxo,Raydioactive,2,Thu Jun 4 10:28:38 2015 UTC,I'm still psyched for these uniforms.

AtlantaHawks,383azz,Boom_Angry,3,Mon Jun 1 19:31:55 2015 UTC,"Stay tuned, as the Hawks also announced Monday that new uniforms, the most modern and cutting-edge in the NBA, will be unveiled before the 2015 NBA Draft."
AtlantaHawks,383azz,meep6969,4,Mon Jun 1 17:34:55 2015 UTC,I was hoping for something similar to our Nique Era throwbacks. Oh well. I've kinda accepted the fact these uniforms are going to be ugly as shit.

I don't quite like the way the border looked on that draft cap."

The Hawks organization probably went through months and months of focus groups and designs before deeming these to be the best ones...Plus you got to realize that the NBA & new owners also have to approve the logo, so there are a lot of parts in play"
AtlantaHawks,383azz,america_eff_yeah,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"I think the number one thing I hate right now is people saying that we are being unoriginal and just made this logo to fit in with the rebrands that have happened lately, completely ignorant that this is an update of our old logo."
AtlantaHawks,383azz,williammc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"Don't care for either. Love Pac Man but ""Basketball Club"" is a soccer reference. Don't see how that helps us ""sell the Hawks"" to Atlanta. Seems like they're going for those Alpharetta Unicorns. Secondary logo is a bad attempt to incorporate an emoji or something."

AtlantaHawks,383azz,atomsej,2,Mon Jun 1 21:43:02 2015 UTC,"Not just football, all sports in Europe (or the UK at least) use ""club"". Football, rugby, cricket, bowls, tennis, anything really. I think it fits with the image they're looking for because clubs here are far more a part of the community than I get the impression they are in the US."
AtlantaHawks,383azz,wherethefisWallace,5,Mon Jun 1 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"ty for pointing this out, as someone from Europe I love the 'basketball club' part of the logo, makes it seem much more mature."

AtlantaHawks,385ma2,rjdab,21,Tue Jun 2 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"If the new ownership fires Danny Ferry for something that has clearly become a non-issue, it really won't make me feel optimistic about the future of the franchise. I would hate for them to make a change just because they didn't hand pick the current GM. The issue with Danny Ferry has clearly become a non-issue, otherwise it would still be a big deal that he hasn't been fired yet. A lot of players came out in support of Ferry (including Luol Deng) for what was pretty clearly a mistake.  Owners should only make changes if there is something wrong with the current state of the team. The Hawks just had the best season in franchise history, and making any changes to the GM/Head Coaching situation would be a huge mistake, especially since it is clear our team is where it is due to coaching."
AtlantaHawks,385ma2,draycon530,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it ""has clearly become a non-issue"" among (mostly white) folks on the internet, but that certainly doesn't mean it's a non-issue for everyone. There are plenty of people IRL who understandably think the team might needlessly be inviting some problems if they bring back a guy who has a reputation for saying that ""African"" is a character flaw.  That being said, OP is right about the need for the coach and GM to be on the same page, so IMO the new owners would have to be crazy to bring in a new GM from anywhere other than the Spurs system."
AtlantaHawks,385ma2,aghaud,6,Tue Jun 2 14:55:59 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, the organization should look at the other side of the argument.  The overwhelming majority of the fan base would be upset at firing the best GM the team has ever had.  Alienating your fans to appease a very small, and shrinking, group of people that mostly have no interest in professional sports, is not the best note to start your ownership with."
AtlantaHawks,385ma2,trafewsan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the new owners are going to be facing plenty of criticism whether they bring Ferry back or not. They'll have to think about free agency too, and whether every player will be as quick to forgive and forget as Ferry's fans have been. It's a bit of a no-win situation. IMO, the outcome that would make the most sense would be to basically leave things the way they are now, with Wes Wilcox handling the front office duties and Coach Bud recruiting free agents (like he was doing even before Ferry left). Either way though, there's no way to make everyone happy. But at least we've got the luxury of having our contending team already assembled; that's more than a lot of teams can say..."
AtlantaHawks,385ma2,aghaud,11,Wed Jun 3 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'm black, and I think he should come back. Most black Hawks fans I know want him back. There was even someone that wrote a letter to the Hawks asking them to bring him back."
AtlantaHawks,385ma2,aghaud,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, of course there are obviously plenty of black fans who want him back. I'm just saying that a lot of the internet-based Hawks fandom seems to have convinced themselves that it would be a total non-issue if they brought him back, and I frankly don't think it would play out that way at all. I'd be surprised if they did bring him back, to be honest."
AtlantaHawks,385ma2,thrashfan,14,Tue Jun 2 21:07:40 2015 UTC,If anyone other that Danny or assistant GM Wilcox is the GM next season I will be disillusioned. If that new GM gets rid of Bud I will gladly stop watching and supporting the Hawks

He made the hire of RC Buford in 2002 to be the GM.    After the great 2 years we've had under coach Bud if he isn't allowed to pick who he wants to be the GM then we'll know this is just the same old Hawks.

AtlantaHawks,382olg,Raydioactive,6,Mon Jun 1 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"It's okay. Not what I expected.   My only gripe is this ugly lime green I keep seeing.  It doesn't work with the red, white, charcoal look. It's an eyesore almost."
AtlantaHawks,382olg,Raydioactive,6,Mon Jun 1 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel ya. I'm holding out until we see the actual jerseys because I read a few places the color looks more yellow than it appears from the computer graphic.

It's most definitely not a Hawk.   Simple outline of our late logo (Hawk holding a basketball) to match our new Pac-Man logo would've been easier on the eyes. This really seems like some 3rd year industrial design student went to town trying to fit too much art and symbolism into a logo. It's a logo, keep it neat and simple. Everybody should know exactly what it represents by first glance."

AtlantaHawks,382olg,Raydioactive,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"Agree completely. Wasn't really this comment, but I was talking with someone about the logo and I just don't think the hawks are going to utilize the second one very often. They seem very committed to the pac and the only place we've seen the secondary is on the waistband (which it works pretty well on due to its simplicity)  Really I just think everyone needs to wait til we see the whole brand before passing total judgement. Who know? Maybe all of this stuff works really well together and we just can't see it yet"

AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,DatDissonance,5,Sun May 31 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how bringing back the entire squad that made the ECF is screwed? It's been obvious since the start of the playoffs that we probably weren't going to be able to keep both Millsap and Demarre, unless one of them decides to stay with the Hawks for a little less money. We may get lucky if one or both decides to sign a 1 year deal and wait for the cap to go up next year. We're also helped by the relatively low number of teams that could offer these guys a huge contract.  We could sign a big money FA by letting Paul walk (less likely). We could sign a mid-level FA if Demarre leaves (more likely). Either way, we're in good shape to be able to replace them. Not many teams can say that about 2 of their starting 5 potentially leaving."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,drsmith21,4,Sun May 31 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"It won't be so easy to replace DMC. He's not only a good basketball fit, but he's the perfect culture fit for what Coach Bud is trying to build. I think a lot of people are operating under the assumption that the league is inundated with 3 and D guys when it just isn't. I would hate to see him leave."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,WhosYourPapa,6,Sun May 31 18:04:18 2015 UTC,There are few great 3 and D guys in the NBA and even fewer who we can afford. I feel as though re-signing DeMarre should be the priority. I love Millsap but he is more easily replaced.
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,thrashfan,5,Mon Jun 1 01:16:51 2015 UTC,also because we dont have much depth at the perimeter as we saw in the playoffs. thabo got hurt and that messed up our entire rotation.
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,Decatur_Psalm,4,Sun May 31 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"Horrible cap situation? Our cap situation is awesome. It's the only reason we are gonna be able to possibly keep Carroll and millsap. I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous. We are in really good shape with the cap, to be blunt."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,peejyluigi,4,Mon Jun 1 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"Also, the Hawks will not be able to use Carroll's early Bird rights to exceed the cap to re-sign him. Early Bird deals can only be for a maximum of 175% of the player's previous salary, which for Carroll would be less than $5 million. He's going to make 2-3 times that. The Hawks potentially could use Millsap's early Bird rights to re-sign him since they could pay him up to $16.7 million, which isn't that far from being a max contract. If the Knicks offer him the max, the NYC income tax would eat up much of the difference."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,DEaster89,5,Sun May 31 10:10:16 2015 UTC,It's not so bad.
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,flintrock70,6,Sun May 31 19:03:48 2015 UTC,Where did you get these numbers?  So we went from mid-20s in payroll to being automatically screwed and no one noticed?
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,Decatur_Psalm,2,Sun May 31 11:59:10 2015 UTC,"because we were ""underpaying"" carroll and millsap by a lot. Now both players are going to be expensive after their short contracts expired, so just to keep the same roster we are paying probably $15mil extra which is the value of a star."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,flintrock70,0,Sun May 31 22:12:24 2015 UTC,"So speculation, 100% speculation."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,Drak_is_Right,2,Sun May 31 23:09:40 2015 UTC,(not a Hawks fan note):  Hawks if they have to should pay no attention to the Luxury tax for a single year.  The salaries added as long as they are not franchise player tag ect will not be tied as a percentage of the salary cap and the Hawks salary situation will resolve itself. They had a good thing this year and should keep the momentum.
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,stnewton,1 point,Sun May 31 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"This is also assuming the Hawks don't pick up Daye's option (seems likely), EB retires or goes elsewhere (who knows?)  and we let Pero and Jenkins go elsewhere in free agency. There's also the chance Tavares is bought out of his European contract and makes the move to the dirty south (yes, please).    I don't really know too much about what penalties going OVER the cap can cause, but the fact that the cap will increase by a large amount in 16/17 makes me think it'd be worth it to take a hit this year. July will be an interesting month, for sure. Can't wait!"
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,mehjbmeh,1 point,Sun May 31 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""horrible"" is the right word.  It's more of a ""Complex""  Atlanta has a ton of free money and the cap is about to rise significantly, BUT, the contracts they were using focused far more on flexibility than anything else.  It's not a horrid situation, it's just this year and next year defines the team for the next 5+ years."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,cwolfe,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"Really don't see us as screwed. We lose Demarre but not through anyone's mismanagement. He just outgrew his contract to such a degree that we can't afford to keep him and have to find someone more reasonably priced. That's how these things go. We resign Millsap, bring over Tavares to come off the bench hopefully find a replacement for Pero and Demarre and we're in good shape. We had a great squad this year but failed to execute. No one hit the open shots in the play offs. If these guys aren't going to hit the open shots then we trade and replace but the pieces we have worked well until the Post Season.   Don't see us as screwed at all. We just aren't bringing in Gasol or Aldridge."
AtlantaHawks,37y0bz,mehjbmeh,-5,Mon Jun 1 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"""Where did you get these numbers? So we went from mid-20s in payroll to being automatically screwed and no one noticed?""  It is precisely BECAUSE we have a mid-20s payroll that we are screwed. Teams that are over the cap get to use the mid-level and bi-annual exceptions. Think about all the options Cleveland has. They're one of the higher payrolls in the league but they could sign-and-trade Love for another max player if they wanted to and they have Brendan Haywood's $10.5 million non-guaranteed deal that they could send to a team that wants to salary dump a useful player.  Once upon a time the ASG derided Steve Belkin for wanting to run the team ""on the cheap."" Then they stupidly gave Joe Johnson a max contract. Since then, the Hawks have had a bottom five payroll. I'm convinced that the ASG tried to compete for a championship while operating $5 million below the cap this season so that they could pocket that money plus the playoff revenue on their way out the door.  ""Someone likes the threeeeeeeeeee""  I like players that hit better than 15% from three when it matters.  ""Hawks if they have to should pay no attention to the Luxury tax for a single year.""  The problem is how do you get from $5 million below the salary cap to all the way into the luxury tax? It's not a simple process, and teams plan this out years in advance. The ASG was planning years in advance to keep operating costs as low as possible while they looked for a buyer.  ""I'm not sure how bringing back the entire squad that made the ECF is screwed?""  The Hawks played the Cavs without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love available for significant parts of the series. Do you think the same squad will be competitive against the Cavaliers if Love, LeBron and Kyrie are all healthy in the playoffs next year? The Cavs also have multiple exceptions available and Brendan Haywood's non guaranteed contract as avenues to add impact players. The only thing the Hawks can do is hope DeMarre will take $13 million and hope Millsap will take $16.7 million and bring the exact same squad back next year with marginal tweaks to the bottom third of the roster. Please tell me how the Hawks are not screwed.  ""We may get lucky if one or both decides to sign a 1 year deal and wait for the cap to go up next year.""  Early Bird deals must be for a minimum of two years with no opt out in the second year. In order to sign either player to a 1-year deal or a 2-year deal with a player option in the second year, they will have to use pure cap space.  ""We're also helped by the relatively low number of teams that could offer these guys a huge contract.""  That number is not low enough. There are at least 10 teams with significant cap space.  ""Either way, we're in good shape to be able to replace them.""  Replace them with whom? Life must be easy in Candyland.  ""This is also assuming the Hawks don't pick up Daye's option (seems likely), EB retires or goes elsewhere (who knows?) and we let Pero and Jenkins go elsewhere in free agency.""  The Hawks should be able to bring back Pero and Jenkins on veteran's minimum exceptions (if they are so inclined) once the rest of the roster is set. I doubt there are teams lined up to engage in a bidding war for their services."

AtlantaHawks,37udnt,Jameisisabitch,6,Sat May 30 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"Suspension was a good thing to keep to Atlanta's ""lay low"" strategy when big time stuff happens around their team. It really hurt us at the deadline, though. Bud can coach but he can't manage the team.   It'd be stupid if he didn't return. It's not like his comments were that awful in the first place. I think the team forgot about it anyways."
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,Intercepting,6,Sat May 30 16:00:38 2015 UTC,I agree. It makes no sense to fire him now. Hopefully common sense prevails and he is given back his position as gm as soon as possible.
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,goamateur,3,Sat May 30 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said. I also believe he still played a minor role behind the scenes even while on leave. He was probably told to fly below the radar, but still keep in touch when it comes to basketball operations until everything eventually passed over. It's not that far fetched to think Coach Bud probably has him saved in his phone as Randy Jerry. If the new ownership plays this smart, they could reinstate him the next time the NFL has another inevitable situation on their hands, i.e. ray rice, etc. Might help minimize the blow back..."
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,THR33ZUS_BANGS,3,Sat May 30 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"Man who knows, we don't know anything about how the new owners feel about him.  It's impossible to say right now"
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,killjoyous,2,Sat May 30 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"You guys may not have noticed that Michael Gearon Jr. is staying on as a minority owner for the Hawks with the new ownership group. This is undoubtedly the owner who recorded and leaked the conference call. He had a vendetta against Bruce Levenson, who replaced him as the controlling owner and hired a GM, Danny Ferry, that Gearon didn't like. Gearon staying on could be an indication that he has more dirt that he could leak if he doesn't get what he wants. The last thing he wants is for Danny Ferry to come out of this smelling like roses. I would not count on Ferry returning to a public-facing role with the Hawks. Ever. They may keep him around because they are on the hook for $6 million over the three years remaining on his contract and they have no way out of it."
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,BuddyGrizzard,1 point,Sun May 31 09:37:35 2015 UTC,"I get that he's on leave, but I'm sure they had someone get his orders through a third party? I mean, how do you operate without a GM for most of the year?"
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,gtatlien,1 point,Sat May 30 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"Also, do you really want Ferry running your draft after Nogueira and Payne? Do you really want him making personnel moves after he gave away two first rounders and the sixth man of the year and got NOTHING in return?"
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,BuddyGrizzard,1 point,Sun May 31 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"Adreian Payne looked really good after being traded to Minnesota. I would have liked to see him given more time to grow in Bud's system.   As for Mr. 6 Man, Loooouuuu - I've always been a big fan. He's an ISO guy that can light you up for 25 points off the bench on any given night. The thing is, he didn't have quite as many of those games in Atlanta because it just didn't fit the scheme, and it showed.   We may have not gotten any IMMEDIATE returns for those two guys, but we increased our cap space significantly in the Toronto trade and received Minnesota's 2017 1st round pick.   Personally, I like that Ferry isn't a ""win now, throw-all-your-eggs-in-one-basket"" kind of GM. We needed to build a foundation and bring consistency to Atlanta first. The ring(s) will follow."
AtlantaHawks,37udnt,THR33ZUS_BANGS,2,Sun May 31 21:05:07 2015 UTC,"If DeMarre ends up staying for 13 million or less, it worked out perfectly.

I believe he dumped that salary to go after Monroe."

AtlantaHawks,37udnt,How_Far_We_Done_Fell,0,Mon Jun 1 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly think he gets fired. I think we held onto him this long to let new ownership decide what to do with him. Two things. First, new ownership will be criticized more heavily for keeping him than firing him (overall, not by fans). Second, new ownership generally likes to leave their mark on a franchise. A new gm would be a way to do that. Now, it's possible that they keep him in hopes that things have calmed down over the past year. It's also possible Bud fights for Ferry and ownership gives a star coach his gm back. That said, I think it's more likely than not that he's gone.  Edit: It's not like I'm trashing Ferry here. I think he's a great GM who said some stupid things. I want to keep him as much as anyone else, but let's not pretend it's farfetched that he won't be back."

He wasn't at fault, has had a good reputation in the league, and it doesn't sound like the cops are going to face any discipline. If it had been lebron, there would have been a million hashtags saying #stoppoliceviolence, but your player didn't get that benefit.  I can now totally see how that looked like a mean post.

AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,Raydioactive,16,Fri May 29 18:57:22 2015 UTC,"Best quote of the article: "" A league is not healthy if it consists of only three types of teams: contenders with superstars, teams losing on purpose to get superstars, and a bunch of cute little hamster-jogging-in-wheel teams killing time before venturing onto one of the other two paths."""
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,Mgarc1125,5,Fri May 29 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"This is an inherent problem with the existing league structure. With no ""punishment"" for being at the bottom (such as relegation in football in Europe), and in fact potentially great reward, you're encouraging middle of the road teams to be worse than they potentially could be.  If something is done to stop the tanking, many more ""also-rans"" will start to be more competitive.  How to make being the 10th best team in the league more rewarding than coming last is the trick to it."
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,Ajinho,6,Sat May 30 01:49:25 2015 UTC,The best idea i've seen is the draft picks having nothing to do with your placement. Instead you randomly assign a 1st overall pick to each team on a 30 year cycle.
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,mehjbmeh,12,Sun May 31 03:52:29 2015 UTC,"Zach Lowe is an amazing writer.  No one else in the media, especially ESPN, even begins to deconstruct pro basketball like he does."
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,trafewsan,9,Fri May 29 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I normally like reading Lowe's stuff but I think this was a bit rushed and meh. The Hawks season all seems to be shroaded in to much myth and narrative, star and team, lebron, market, players and injuries, which is all very 'thought provoking' but pretty vain and self satisfying and ultimately pretentious.  On that note though, the most mythical thing about the season is this mirage that appeared and has since been reconstructed and redescribed through so many different story lines. The most confusing aspect of all this is hearing players and coaches talk about it as if the change is a complete mystery, how can you dominate both ends of the court so thoroughly and to such detail and then NOT understand what exactly went wrong. If it is put down to playoff nerves, I guess I can swallow that but still wonder how what happened during the season didn't displace those nerves or how the rational play calling perfection leaves space for nerves at all?!   One thing I have written on this sub a few times and haven't had an overwhelming response to, which cloaks it in mystery even more for me (although a few folks have confirmed it) that despite everything said by coaching staff and players they know full well that they changed the whole system after the all star break and continued it to the very end of the playoffs. That transformation was from a team that called copius amounts of various, relentless and merciless plays after plays that put the bigs in so many situations the other team had no chance to predict or hedge leaving different killer options available every time down the floor. To free form basketball. A style that had been perfected by the Spurs (and Mavs) that I believe inspires good players to become great, by giving them complete autonomy and trust in their ability to think while playing, which mature players love to do. However, even though I respect the attempt and the principitle fortitude not to divert from it, I dont think it would have compromised the Hawks development to go back to some tried and tested flex, high lows or horns sets, which the guys were familiar with, to restore fluidity and fluency in their rhythm and technical execution and ultimately rebuild that confidence. Something that the bench surely lacked, how can Mike Scott go from having an above average season, and looking like someone who could be another issue for Lebron, to 0 minutes game after game?   The reg season had a certain flow about it, that even though it was not purely manifest from the imagination of the players in real time, it was sublime. Make an easy 2, get back on D, set up, collapse on the drive or box out on the jumper, rebound, then get out in transition, transition bucket. All of that was set up from that initial play call, that as Lowe said, 'confounded' teams, even in the west!  Why be so eager to ditch what you had tried so hard to master and perfect all season? Why not talk about it in the press? Is it a secret? Or have I just been walking in the desert, wanting good team basketball like a tall drink of water so badly and only seeing mirages of those awesome plays and breathtaking basketball from my winter stoop?   I was dissappointed in Lowe's article because it tried to mainstream what the hawks had done and it ultimately reduced it to just another season that will be forgotten, as if the article was written out of sympathy, sort of like, oh I guess I should write something about the hawks losing because everyone will be expecting it.   My overall feelings of this season are a bit melancholic due to the reception of dismissal as soon as the hawks entered the post season, especially from people who had barely watched a game all season and continued to use washed up cliches to determine where they would end up. They may have been right but this attitude contributed to the fact that the discussion was never remotely close to where I tried to take this today. My point is, far more happened in this season than most are even coming close to and I was a little dissapointed Zach didn't get closer, and I worry that the progress will be lost if its not documented accurately, and sincerely hope greater heights can be reached. I may be way off though, I am not even sure about what I saw anymore..."
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,haughtcrestedelmer,5,Fri May 29 22:00:07 2015 UTC,"Ehh.. we soared in January. We were also 100% healthy at the time. We had a lot of unfortunate injuries and very few of our guys were 100%. Not making excuses but I think we had some bad luck along the way. We beat Cleveland if that series is in January.. not a sweep, but we do win it."
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,america_eff_yeah,3,Fri May 29 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. He mentions that a bit. I also think our bench is an issue. Schroeder will improve of course and Thabo getting injured killed us but we assuming we keep Carroll and Millsap, we need a scoring upgrade. I will say I think the majority of our upgrades can come internally though (Moose and Baze in particular)"
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,yyyyydjrsr,1 point,Fri May 29 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"He kind of touched on it, but I think a rebound snagging center should be a primary goal for us in the offseason. Horford just isn't physical enough to go against powerful centers in the postseason. If that means getting rid of Millsap then so be it."
AtlantaHawks,37r5h2,lackingcredibility9,3,Fri May 29 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"Why not both?  Hawks front office is considering bringing over Walter Tavares next year.  If they do and you keep millsap, you can go very big with Millsap at the 3, both horford and millsap can play the 4 in more defensive/rebounding lineups, and you still have the great starting unit that played so well defensively and offensively to more than cover up for hte rebounding when no bench players were in the game."
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,teckademic,3,Fri May 29 13:30:29 2015 UTC,So do we have enough Demarre & a max? Or millsap & a max?
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,Tomahawkchop14,1 point,Fri May 29 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"I'd rather Millsap+max but it'd have to be a max on a young player if we want to stay under the cap.  DeMarre is more replaceable and honestly not worth the $10m-$12m he is going to get offered, but not many guys have the size and strength that Millsap brings.  Also this article doesn't mention it but the luxury tax - if we have new owners who don't mind spending money, can we just sign over the salary cap?  How does Brooklyn rack up $100m in bills?  Do all the contracts over the cap come from trades?"
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,Orgcore,2,Fri May 29 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"You can go over the cap when re-signing players, but you are taxed for it. I believe that's roughly how luxury tax works."
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,cosmo_bear,1 point,Fri May 29 18:58:32 2015 UTC,plus 2 of the guys in the new ownership groups are multi-billionaires...don't think they'd mind getting taxed
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,T64dw4n,1 point,Sat May 30 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"From my weak understanding of that article and another he linked to it looks like Millsap is easier because he was already priced high whereas Demare's value is likely to increase beyond 104% of the average value. So if we max him out, again poor grasp but grasping, it eats away our cap space whereas if we do so with Millsap we'll still have money to play with."
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,cwolfe,2,Fri May 29 19:48:38 2015 UTC,im so confused...is there an idiots guide ?
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,RuntheFlats,1 point,Fri May 29 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"The part on exceptions isn't quite right. Exceptions aren't  'renounced.' They're either granted (if a team is over the cap, or apron for the non-taxpayer) or not (if the team is under the cap). Exceptions count against the cap only if you're close enough to the cap for the exception to put you over the cap.  If you're not over the cap, then you can't use an exception and thus it doesn't count against your cap. There is no need to renounce it since you don't qualify for it anyway."
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,drsmith21,2,Fri May 29 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"No, exceptions can be and are renounced. At the beginning of the offseason, the NBA creates a listing of all the relevant assets on a team's ""Team Salary"" which includes the cap values for all players under contract, the free agent holds associated with free agents, and the value of any other exception for the team (Traded Player Exception, Disabled Player Exception, Bi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception, and Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception). What I believe you are confused by is that the CBA stipulates certain conditions for use of the Tax MLE, Non-Tax MLE, Room MLE (which doesn't have a cap hold) and the Bi-annual Exception.  See VII, 4, a, emphasis on 7:   Section 4. Determination of Team Salary.  (a) Computation. For purposes of computing Team Salary under this Agreement, all of the following amounts shall be included: (7) The amount of any Salary Cap Exception that is deemed included in Team Salary in accordance with Section 6(m)(2) below.    See VII, 6, m, 2:   In the event that when a Disabled Player Exception, Bi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (or the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception if the Team is no longer able to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but remains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception) and/or Traded Player Exception arises, the Team’s Team Salary is below the Salary Cap (or in the event that, prior to the expiration of any such Exceptions, the Team’s Team Salary falls below the Salary Cap) by less than the amount of such Exceptions, then (i) the Team’s Team Salary shall include, until the Exceptions are actually used or until the Team no longer is entitled to use the Exceptions, the amount of the Exceptions (or any unused portion of the Exceptions), and (ii) the amount by which the Team’s Team Salary is less than the Salary Cap shall thereby be extinguished. When the Disabled Player Exception is used to sign or acquire a player, the Replacement Player’s Salary for the Season covered by his Contract, instead of the amount of the Exception, shall be included in Team Salary. When a Bi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception or Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception is used to sign a player, or when a Traded Player Exception is used to acquire a player, the Salary for the first Season of the signed or acquired Contract plus any then-unused portion of the Exception, instead of the full amount of the Exception, shall be included in Team Salary. A Team may at any time renounce its rights to use an Exception, in which case the Exception (or any unused portion of the Exception) will no longer be included in Team Salary.   The only Exception that does not count against a team's ""Team Salary"" would be the Room MLE. So for the Hawks to get to ~$24.6 million, they would have to inform the NBA of renouncing their free agents and their exceptions."
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,hawksfanatic,1 point,Fri May 29 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"When I said exceptions aren't renounced, I meant that the Hawks would not have to renounce the MLE or BAE to get to the $24.6M cap space, not that no exceptions are ever renounced. Obviously if you're renouncing a player, you're technically renouncing his veteran free agent exception.     In the event that when a Disabled Player Exception, Bi-annual Exception, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception (or the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception instead of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception if the Team is no longer able to use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception but remains able to use the Taxpayer Mid-Level Salary Exception) and/or Traded Player Exception arises, the Team’s Team Salary is below the Salary Cap (or in the event that, prior to the expiration of any such Exceptions, the Team’s Team Salary falls below the Salary Cap) by less than the amount of such Exceptions,       The last 8 words are the most important part: unless you're close enough to the salary cap then the exceptions don't count against the cap. If the salary cap is $67.1M and the Hawks are at $42M in team salary and cap holds, there are no exceptions the Hawks are entitled to and thus nothing to count against the cap.   If the salary cap is at $67.1M and the Hawks are at $65M the Hawks are entitled to the BiAnnual Exception and the BAE counts against the cap (@$2.14M). If the salary cap cap is $67.1M and the Hawks are at $64M then the Hawks are not entitled to the BAE so the BAE doesn't count against the cap. There is no need to renounce something which you don't have in the first place.   The only reason to renounce the BAE, for example, is if the Hawks were at $65M and wanted to sign someone to a 1 yr/$2M contract. Since the team is within $2.14M of the cap they're entitled to the BAE, but a 1yr contract doesn't fit in the BAE, so they would have to renounce it in order to sign a player to that contract."
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,drsmith21,1 point,Sun May 31 05:40:10 2015 UTC,What you think the CBA says is not what it actually says. You should read the full section you've quoted to understand why you are wrong. I already highlighted the relevant wording in that section as well as the relevant sections of the CBA which details that exceptions carry cap holds.
AtlantaHawks,37pupj,hawksfanatic,1 point,Sun May 31 17:57:40 2015 UTC,I still can't believe we got Demarre for $3 mill...and Pero is definitely not worth 104% of what he got paid this year...

If that is a direction the mods pursue, I volunteer to write about Maravich as he is my favorite player and I can basically recite the biographies on him."

AtlantaHawks,37o3y5,rjdab,2,Sat May 30 03:14:19 2015 UTC,I will be making changes like that once we know what the team's color scheme will be next year. A lot of the color and desgin (especially the header image) is pending on what the team goes with.

AtlantaHawks,37os0c,kevinonthemoon,19,Fri May 29 05:31:34 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned this before, and I'll say it again. The only ""problem"" with the Hawks this season is we fans expected too much.  You don't go from a #8 seed to NBA champion in a year. Only twice in the entire history of the NBA has a team gone from #8 or worse one season to the NBA finals in the next: the 2008 Celtics, who had just acquired Garnett and Allen, and the 2015 Cavaliers, who just acquired LeBron James and Kevin Love.  Unless you make a huge free agent splash, you don't go from #8 seed to the NBA finals. It just doesn't happen. Getting to the NBA finals requires experience under pressure. It requires experience under the spotlight. We didn't have that this year. We'll have that in the future.  It was unreasonable to expect the Hawks to get to the Finals this year. Had we gotten there, it would have been absolutely unprecedented, the first team to go from #8 to the NBA Finals without a major acquisition. Every other NBA finals team has had at least a year of strong play before reaching the finals. We needed that year, too. Between this year's experience and our excellent salary cap position, we'll make the finals by 2018. I guarantee it. The Hawks will be in the NBA Finals sometime in the next three years."
AtlantaHawks,37os0c,Starsy,3,Fri May 29 08:06:17 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree with all of that.  There was absolutely  no reason at all to expect us to win it all this year, especially at the beginning of this year.  That said, if we could have somehow fins a way to get back to that midseason form, I think we would have rolled to the ECF and had a pretty good shot of beating the Cavs.  Still don't know if we would have beaten Golden State the way they are playing right now though."

AtlantaHawks,37lngl,callmerevan,8,Thu May 28 15:34:19 2015 UTC,12 mil a year for Demarre is a bit too much for us I think
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,noodlz05,12,Thu May 28 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Demarre is such a versatile player now on both ends of the court that 12 mil is a pretty fair asking price. There aren't many 3-and-D guys in the league that can do what he's been doing in the last half of this season, and he has already developed chemistry with the rest of the team...and he very likely has his best years ahead of him...I say bring him back."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,cosmo_bear,3,Thu May 28 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"We just finished paying Millsap $8.5 mill/year. Horford is making $12 mill/year. $12 mill/year is a fair market price because you're worth what someone is willing to pay. For us though, it's an overpay. I honestly wouldn't want to pay Demarre more than $9 mill/year at most. We can't overpay just to compete. We've learned that lesson already."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,pzauteenk,7,Fri May 29 04:18:25 2015 UTC,12 mil in NY gets you much lesser than what maybe 10 mil gets you in Atl... (Maybe we have a chance!) :)
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,callmerevan,2,Thu May 28 17:52:59 2015 UTC,We have enough cap space to sign two max contracts and still have a little left over to sign some vet minimums. So if everything hits the shitter I would rather resign Demarre for 12 or slightly more and get either Marc Gasol/Millsap to a max and have a weaker bench.
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,drrhythm2,2,Thu May 28 16:32:18 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that mean our team would be worse than this season? Are you saying basically ""same starters but weaker bench?"""

AtlantaHawks,37lngl,cosmo_bear,3,Thu May 28 16:47:12 2015 UTC,"He's been amazing in finding undervalued players for us. We may have to do that again. I think at Millsap's age, $15 mill/year is fair and I like Demarre at $8 maybe 9 mill/year. If we can't get them for that, we may need Ferry's expertise on undervalued players."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,Wood80,1 point,Fri May 29 04:21:11 2015 UTC,I think we're going to lose Demarre.  He will get $10-$12/year contract from other team.

AtlantaHawks,37lngl,BlindBanditMelonLord,-1,Fri May 29 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"I hear some guy named Kevin Love may be exploring free agency. Don't think he fit into his last team very well, but Coach Bud could probably find a role for him."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,kraken-on-standby,9,Fri May 29 04:52:42 2015 UTC,"They would do poorly because the Knicks system is a failure at best right now. While I'd love to keep them, we could do just as good of not better finding replacements in free agency, because this season basically was a movie trailer for us. It shows everyone that they can come here and compete for a title."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,broeho,13,Thu May 28 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"I actually think the knicks would probably fuck them both up and they would have disappointing seasons.  I love Carroll and Millsap, but I also wouldn't be devastated to lose them if we could replace them with really good players who fit our system (like a Marc Gasol or something). I'm hoping that stud players around the league are starting to realize that this system is awesome and that maybe they can win titles here.  I don't want to underestimate how good our team is, cause everyone on our starting 5 is a really good player, but If this is what we can do with a roster of glorified role players, imagine what we can do with real elite talent if they buy into the system."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,Orgcore,1 point,Thu May 28 15:52:21 2015 UTC,"I'll love DeMarre forever but I agree - he definitely is gonna be a pretty average player if he goes to New York.  Wouldn't matter since he would be getting paid, but no way DeMarre is a $10-$12m player without our system."
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,njdevils5790,1 point,Fri May 29 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"I still think it's gonna take a few more successful seasons before any of the top talent show interest in Atlanta. Although we have a good coach and good team, atlanta is still not one of the top free agent destinations. Hopefully over the next few seasons we can change establish this winning culture for our team and become a desirable destination for free agents. I don't think we're gonna be able to grab a big name during free agency, so I think it'd be in our benefits to sign demare even if we're over paying him a little. I don't see any free agents we can realistically land to replace the hole demare's absence would leave"
AtlantaHawks,37lngl,Decatur_Psalm,3,Fri May 29 11:00:46 2015 UTC,signing both doesnt make sense for them with melo alternating between 3 and 4. i think they'd pass on millsap since there's a lot of overlap with melo.

With the rumored money Demare is going to get thrown at him it will most likely be Millsap. But, we could also let them both walk and go for a big name like Aldrige and move Al to the 4. Then we have to find someone to fill in at the 3 for Demare. We have some interesting choices to make. I am really curious what we do this offseason, lots of options."
AtlantaHawks,37mns7,saacman,6,Thu May 28 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Payne's roster spot was tough because he was more of a 4 and we had plenty of those and Mike Scott was playing very well at the time. We also have Tavares overseas currently who is 7'2""(?) and a rebounding monster. Our weakest point is on the wings especially with the high probability that Demarre is gone. I'd prefer the Hawks keep the pick and draft a dude who they can groom into a killer 3 and D player."

AtlantaHawks,37mns7,T64dw4n,2,Thu May 28 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"Well Tavares still needs to work on his rebounding.  He's long, but he doesn't outmuscle people very often.  From everything I've heard, he is a pretty good defensive player, but still needs to work on establishing position inside and doesn't have much of a shot.  He may make the team, but he'll be behind Horford (if Horford is a center as opposed to PF) and Muscala."

AtlantaHawks,37j4bv,KickedInTheDonuts,24,Thu May 28 01:08:00 2015 UTC,The Pistons made it to the Eastern Finals six straight years.  2003 was the first of the six.  They had won one postseason series in the previous 11 years.

AtlantaHawks,37j4bv,Vituperat,4,Thu May 28 02:59:41 2015 UTC,Tavares rhymes with Wallace(kinda). Hawks 2016 champions confirmed.

AtlantaHawks,37j4bv,mcpdizzle,1 point,Fri May 29 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"I guess you could do a southern twang and pronounce Wallace like 'wall- less"" instead of 'wall- luss' and emphasize the last syllable of 'ta-var-ESS' actually I suppose its doable. Good discussion."
AtlantaHawks,37j4bv,dogshenanigans,10,Sat May 30 16:04:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, going from where the Hawks were last year to a championship would have been unprecedented. Only one team has ever gone from an 8th seed or worse to NBA champion in one year: the 2008 Celtics, who traded for Allen and Garnett the offseason before.  Don't get me wrong. I would have loved to win the championship this year. But we have nothing to be ashamed of -- in NBA history, you generally don't go from #8 seed to NBA champion. You go from #8 seed, to #5 seed, to #2 seed, to NBA champion. An NBA Finals is in our near future. By the end of 2018, we will have been to at least one NBA Finals (maybe not won, because zomg Western conference, but at least been to one)."

AtlantaHawks,37iji4,poerhouse,4,Thu May 28 02:03:23 2015 UTC,It's pretty well written except for the 'rebuilding' part. There is no rebuilding needed. Our foundation and philosophy is now the envy of a lot of other teams. Now it's time to build off of what we already have. Time to supercharge it and add some extra logs to the fire next season. This postseason will do that- as experience and as a collective axe for the team to grind next year.
AtlantaHawks,37gv7h,IdealParadox,30,Wed May 27 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"Cleveland fans are plenty used to the heartbreak of sport  We would never rub it in the other teams face, sorry for all the trolls, but they aren't Cavs fans they are the unfortunate side-effect of having a really good team  IMO, this series was decided by ATLs lack of rim protection, fixable and not something that will break the bank...ATL will be an Eastern Conf playoff mainstay for the future, congrats on the season"

All in all, you Hawks fans are classy, and didn't say anything this series I wouldn't have if I was rooting your way. The anti-LeBron circlejerk is as real as the pro-lebron bandwagon, and we're still trying to deal with both of those things in every playoff series we're in.   Good luck in the future, I hope you guys can reload."

The turnaround in wins from last year was astronomical.   Hopefully, this season will make Atlanta a more viable option for free agents. Maybe, after seeing this kind of turnaround and season, they'll want to come here for once. The fans were engaged. Ticket sales were outstanding. The team made it all the way to conference finals and just ran out of gas.   Good luck in the finals, Cavs!"
AtlantaHawks,37gv7h,MuadD1b,2,Wed May 27 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"Cavs fan here, I just want Cleveland to win one, then I don't give a fuck.  I want every team in the East to get healthy and kill the West, those guys are fucking douche bags.  As long as it's not Boston, obligatory 'fuck Boston' here,  I don't care who wins from the east as long as the west loses."
AtlantaHawks,37gv7h,THR33ZUS_BANGS,8,Wed May 27 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you, sir. It takes a lot of class for a true fan to come here and apologize on behalf of a few bad apples.  I'll be the first to admit it. I was guilty for feeding the trolls and getting caught up in the madness here in this sub during the playoffs. I even showed my ass a few times. But when the dust finally settled, I have no problem saying the Cavs were clearly the better team. Congratulations and good luck in the finals."

The team made history for our city in all sorts of ways.  Beating Warriors at Home.  4-all stars.  That month.  Beating the Cavs at Home.  Nique Night.   Wizards game 5.   Those are some awesome memories.  Met a bunch of other #truebeliever hawks fans.    Can't wait for next season to do it again.  Thanks Hawks.

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,killjoyous,43,Wed May 27 02:44:42 2015 UTC,I fucking loved this season. Watching every game with my Hawk bros has been amazing. I'm so happy about how far we made it this year. The amount of progress this team has made is just beautiful.  The fact of the matter is we've always been a team that has been stuck in the middle of the pack and this year we took a huge lead hella early in the regular season and fucking dominated everything.   I appreciate everything Coach Bud has done and I love this team Danny has built. I am excited for whatever comes next.   60 wins is nothing to be ashamed of. A perfect month is nothing to be ashamed of. A 19 win streak is nothing to be ashamed of. The best twitter in the nba 4 all stars Starting 5 named player of the month First eastern conference finals appearance as Atlanta Coach of the year  We have nothing to be ashamed of guys let's stay proud.  There is so many positive things to come out of this year and I'm just glad I got to celebrate it with the best fans in the nba and I don't care what anyone says it's true.  True to Atlanta.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Back_Sweat,37,Wed May 27 02:51:32 2015 UTC,I was there for the Antoine Walker era. I was there for the 13-win season. I was there '08 Celtics series.

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Jaerbs,26,Wed May 27 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, first ECF in the history of the team. We have come a long way from the Isaiah Rider days. Interesting to see what we do this off season. Hate to say it but we really need a scorer."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,noodlz05,10,Wed May 27 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"Everybody on our team is a scorer, just failed to step it up when we needed it the most. We just didn't seem mentally prepared, and that's not really out of the ordinary for guys who aren't used to the huge expectations and don't have deep playoff experience. I firmly believe we don't really need to change much, if at all. Bring the same team back next year and we'll be much better with experience. If it's not working midway through the season, then make some moves."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,gsfgf,11,Wed May 27 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"A scorer is going to be someone who gets us that bucket when we are going 0-10 to start the third quarter. I like our guys, but we need some tweaks and we are unsure how FA is going to shake out."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,noodlz05,9,Wed May 27 03:21:43 2015 UTC,Pretty much every one in the starting five can be that guy. Lebron started game 3 0-10...no one is immune from bad shooting. I'd rather have 5 different people to fall back on rather than just 1. Not to mention the fact that most scorers are ball stoppers...good luck finding one that fits our offense.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Reoh,10,Wed May 27 03:33:32 2015 UTC,"Plus, it's the NBA.  Actual team teams tend to take a little while to develop, but if we can keep this crew together for a few years, we'll get a ring."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,dbthelinguaphile,8,Wed May 27 03:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, unless you drop big money to bring in superstar talent, you gotta give it some time. Really hate how so many people here want to change up the team even though we've shown we can compete. Year 1: almost upset the 1 seed with Horford injured. Year 2: ECF with multiple injuries, and very little deep playoff experience. For fucks sake, give it another year at least."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,dillardPA,2,Wed May 27 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"I was shocked how well we played this year, I thought it could happen but I didn't expect us to win so many games and then make it all the way to the ECF!  We learnt a hard lesson now, but that's ok. We learn from this and come back stronger next year."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,noodlz05,2,Wed May 27 14:27:13 2015 UTC,An underrated reason Portland improved from last season to this one is the continuity of the team. Could be a big factor coming into next season for you guys if you're mostly bringing them back.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,TheChinchilla914,5,Wed May 27 16:57:40 2015 UTC,"While I don't think we should break the team up, I think we need do need to find that one player that separates himself from the rest. He doesn't have to be a ball hog to work in our system but we do need someone that can put the team on his back at times. We're modeled after the Spurs, but at the end of the day we don't have a player that comes close to someone like Tim Duncan or even Tony Parker.   There's a reason why the NBA champions for the last 25 years included one of: Lebron, Duncan/Parker, DWade, Dirk, Kobe, Shaq, MJ/Pippen etc. Unless we become an insane defensive powerhouse like the 04 Pistons or a couple of guys turn into an equivalent of the Celtics' Big 3, I have a hard time seeing us get over the hump in the playoffs when it comes to crunch time.  I love this team but we can't ignore the obvious. Sometimes you just need that guy who can put the team on his back for a bit and create plays when the team is slumping. So many times we'd hit a slump where we'd get stagnant and none of our guys could create a play. Even though we won, I couldn't help but be envious seeing the way Wall energized the Wizards during our series against them."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Decatur_Psalm,5,Wed May 27 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"History definitely backs your view, but I think it can be done without a superstar as long as you have versatile pieces in a system that brings out the strengths of each player. It's total speculation at this point whether it will ever work, but I think our progress after just two years says a lot. We'll see how things play out!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,killjoyous,3,Wed May 27 05:01:44 2015 UTC,I mean the NBA literally changed the rules after the '04 Pistons.   They want hero ball. Lets tell em to go fuck themselves next year
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Decatur_Psalm,26,Wed May 27 07:06:12 2015 UTC,yep i hope this series puts a bad taste in our players mouths and we come out better in next year's playoffs.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,jmonumber3,22,Wed May 27 02:46:06 2015 UTC,We'll come back next playoffs if our team isn't horribly crippled haha

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,rimmyrim,1 point,Wed May 27 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"I ask myself that all the time. I have no clue why we get all of the hate. My only guess is that since we came out of nowhere, people thought it was a fluke and that eventually the bottom would fall out from under us, but it never really did. People were calling us the worst 1-seed in history, but we continued to win. I guess once people realized Cleveland was going to beat us, they decided to hop back on the ""Hawks are overrated"" bandwagon.  Hopefully, if the Hawks continue to play at the level they did this year, they might begin to earn more respect and less hate"

I have always supported the Hawks because they are the home town team but it was tough to watch for a long time. Bibby, Joe, Marvin, Josh, and Al were just not fun to watch. Having gone to Kennesaw State (and hating UGA and Tech) there is no team I root for in basketball that has ever really done anything. This years team did something that I had never experienced before. It's a special feeling waking up on NFL sunday for Falcons games, or heading to the Ted for Braves games. This years Hawks gave me that same feeling. I was finally excited for MY team and not just watching basketball because I enjoyed the sport. I could talk shit to people for the first time in my life about my fucking team. It was an amazing winter during a tough football season where the Falcons blew it because of the Hawks. Everyone that isn't a Hawks fan will look at this team as ""pretenders"" and that we shouldn't have even been a 1 seed. Another classic Atlanta team that had a great regular season and choked in the playoffs. Well fuck them. This team won 60 games and gave me a new level of love for basketball I didn't know I had. CawCaw!"

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Squintz69,13,Wed May 27 02:54:42 2015 UTC,Beautiful team work. Couldn't put it together in the ECF but we did better than 26 other teams.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Adampro123,14,Wed May 27 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"Been an honor guys. From the undefeated month, to the team of the month, to four Hawks all stars, to the 60 win season, to the 1 seed in the East, to the Coach of the year...and all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. Thanks for being the best damn sports sub on reddit guys, hell of a year."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,msl_atl,6,Wed May 27 02:59:02 2015 UTC,It was a good ride.  I think next season will be even better.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,jamesbradb,5,Wed May 27 03:22:28 2015 UTC,I hated how we went out but overall we had an awesome season! Thank you to all the players and coaches that gave us a great year. I look forward to next year!  And it was great get on here and see other Hawks fan that love the team as much as i do. I live in Alabama and no one really cares about the Hawks here and all my friends are Mavs fans so it's nice to have a place to go to that knows exactly how you're feeling when it comes to your team. So thanks to all the people that come here and post too.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,lookoutfortank,5,Wed May 27 03:25:38 2015 UTC,Hawks on top
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,shyspy,4,Wed May 27 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"I loved witnessing the growth of this team and the camaraderie of this sub all season. Hats off to the mods, who make this all possible. Thanks for upvoting and commenting on my posts and articles, I look forward to a very active sub this summer! Caw Caw!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,davidsreddittag,6,Wed May 27 03:18:51 2015 UTC,So happy for what this team was able to do this season. We will be back next season. I haven't been this excited about basketball since I was a kid. Looking forward to this off season and the regular seasons to come. GO HAWKS! CAW CAW!
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,mcjcheerios,6,Wed May 27 03:20:02 2015 UTC,This team was expected to win 40 games and possibly not make the playoffs and they vastly exceeded those expectations!  We may not be a true contender (yet) but I'll take this over the Mike Woodson days of Joe and Josh chucking away shots any day!
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,FiveLine,7,Wed May 27 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be stuck at work all day tomorrow, but everyone who can, yall better wear your Hawks shirts/jerseys/snapbacks/whatever proudly tomorrow. These boys put in work this year, so much so that no one even remembers Ferry's Deng comments before the season. Heck, don't even be afraid to bust out the goggles."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,dakane328,8,Wed May 27 03:28:35 2015 UTC,Great season. I am excited to see what next year holds!

I love my city and even though this loss broke my heart, it really showed me that this team is capable of doing alot of things, great things. Thanks for a great year, and thanks to this sub for making it all the better. CAW CAW"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,america_eff_yeah,7,Wed May 27 03:43:01 2015 UTC,One of my favorite memories this season.

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,ABondaxFan,3,Wed May 27 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"We had a fantastic season this year and were kept up with in an awesome fashion. This series had some fantastic play on both sides, and I'm excited to see the changes for next year.   Rome wasn't built in a day, and our franchise will be true to atlanta next year by playing some damn good basketball.   Here's to next year guys. CAW CAW!!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,MrCleanMagicReach,4,Wed May 27 03:35:23 2015 UTC,Real proud of our guys. We did some amazing things this season and can't wait to see what we do next season.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Fork_was_Taken,4,Wed May 27 03:50:43 2015 UTC,Congrats on a great season! I would marry Dennis Schroeder if he would have me.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Bluegodzill,10,Wed May 27 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"Agree with the sentiment, but it's technically the greatest season in Atlanta Hawks history. They won titles in St. Louis."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,GBralta,3,Wed May 27 03:09:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I goofed
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,DrPass,8,Wed May 27 13:48:47 2015 UTC,Cavs fan here. Thanks for a good series. Looking forward to next year fighting for the 1st seed. Love and Sefolosha get to play in next year's ECF so that will be fun. Hope y'all are rooting for us and not the Warriors.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,doitforthepeople,6,Wed May 27 03:22:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great year Hawks...and hopefully many more will follow!
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,JustinG1000,6,Wed May 27 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"It's been a hell of a ride, fellas. I'll be right here next season with my NBA league pass subscription. I moved from Atlanta to Southern California 15 years ago and it's good to have a great group of HawksBros to chat and and enjoy games with. Next season, let's shoot for 70 wins and bring this motherfucker home. Fuck the Cavs. Fuck the King. Fuck the Celtics especially."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Atownbomber,3,Wed May 27 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Not salty at all. I have nothing but pride in our Hawks. We showed in game three that we are still scary when we play Hawks basketball. If we put in some real work this offseason and use that cap space wisely, I think  this team can win 60 games again and maybe even win it all! So excited for this team's future!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Wong-A-Donger,3,Wed May 27 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Big up Hawks fans. Had to have been fun. Most fun I've had as a Nuggets fan is when we went to the WCF.   Seems like y'all have a great coach and culture, I'm jealous and look forward to much sucess from the Hawks."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,ridingthepine,3,Wed May 27 04:52:39 2015 UTC,i really want demarre but rumor is that some other team is gonna pay him 15 mil a year and i dont see how we can do that
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,ichinii,3,Wed May 27 09:21:34 2015 UTC,What a season!! Glad I could experience it with my hawkbros!
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,CoLiNieS,3,Wed May 27 12:17:23 2015 UTC,Great season guys! It was awesome every second of the way!
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,TheChinchilla914,3,Wed May 27 13:08:47 2015 UTC,"Great season. I have never been as invested in a team as I was this season, and that is 100% due to our team being a cohesive unit comprised of guys I legitimately admired, who also happened to play beautiful team basketball for almost the entire season. I don't think people realize how rare it is to have a team like this. We were lucky. I look forward to next season, and staying true to Atlanta."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,JustinG1000,10,Wed May 27 13:52:56 2015 UTC,It was a great season overall. Our city's championship drought continues. Being an Atlanta sports fan you want to cry when disappointment happens but you gotta be happy about something you know....Falcons will win us a championship this year.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,SharplyDressedSloth,11,Wed May 27 02:58:01 2015 UTC,"Great series guys, promising team. We'll try to do the east proud."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,msiddiq98,15,Wed May 27 02:50:01 2015 UTC,Give them hell. Not sure who I'll personally be cheering for but it will def be a great Finals.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,ft_yuk,-2,Wed May 27 03:05:28 2015 UTC,Ill be cheering for a Cavs championship and Delladova getting shot. Take what you want.

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,EconomicTech,5,Wed May 27 06:03:28 2015 UTC,Love these guys to death. Now I can't wait for the Warriors to beat the living shit out of the Cavs.  Caw caw.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Dimaaaa,7,Wed May 27 03:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna put aside my ATL-Sports fan induced saltiness for a minute and say thanks Hawks and /r/atlantahawks. Who cares if we got swept? That doesn't change our 60 wins or 19 win streak. It doesn't change the fact that we made it to the ECF for the first time. It doesn't change our incredible season. I'm sure we'll bounce back next year with a healthy team (screw Dellavedova, NYPD, refs, etc.). Thank you for giving me 🏀 to look forward to throughout the season. It's been a pleasure. Fuck the Saints. CAW CAW.  #TrueToAtlanta  TLDR: Love this team. Fuck the Saints. CAW."
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Ayatori,2,Wed May 27 03:13:43 2015 UTC,NEXT YEAR!
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,macpatrik,2,Wed May 27 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"It's certainly tough to swallow because we really did get a peek at how amazing this team could be. It was so frustrating to watch us struggle through the playoffs. In the end, it was an unbelievable run and the best part of it is that we are just at the foundation of what will hopefully be a long and successful run at the top.   Our weaknesses are clear and hopefully we can be as effective in addressing them as we were last season (defensive wing depth). Hopefully Edy Tavares brings that DREB prescense that we so desperately need and we get Paul and Demarre back on reasonable deals.   This offseason will be fun and I'm already counting down the days till next October (I'll be married then too, exciting times people).  GO HAWKS"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,Jtwood019,2,Wed May 27 13:42:27 2015 UTC,"Your team was great! Without injuries and the help of the NYPD, I think you could have taken the East and possibly the whole thing.  Is your whole team back next year? Cause that would be awesome! I very much enjoyed watching your team style games in a star centered NBA.    Good luck in the off season and hold your heads high. Your team is awesome!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,TotesMessenger,2,Wed May 27 15:16:38 2015 UTC,GG Hawks. Watching your team has been a true pleasure this season.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,allancaesar,3,Wed May 27 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"You guys had a really incredible run this year, I'm super impressed with how this team played all year. I was really pulling for you guys to make it out of the East if it hadn't been us. Really love your team's game, your coach, your players, and especially the great sense of community this franchise has going on. I'd definitely love to be a Hawks fan if my heart wasn't with the Cavs.  Can't wait to see you guys at full strength again next year, counting on you guys to pull out those unreal runs again like you did in January.  Good luck next season!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,PixyFreakingStix,5,Wed May 27 07:33:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for a great series guys. You were refreshing breath of fresh air after dealing with Bulls and Celtics fans despite the whole Dellavedova thing. Hope to see you guys next season.
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,tiercel,1 point,Wed May 27 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"Long term lurker here. Really enjoyed the highlight clips every night after a game. I first remember watching the Hawks back in the Jason Terry, Mutumbo, and coaching carousel days. This has been the most fun team to watch and I couldn't be prouder to be a Hawks fan. I love our core group of players and with Coach Bud and Danny Ferry at the helm, I have no doubts we will have a championship soon. Thanks again guys!"

AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,killjoyous,0,Wed May 27 10:02:48 2015 UTC,"Hawks' fans were nothing but class during that series, even with all the Delly stuff going on.  I'm really looking forward to a Cavs/Hawks rivalry with you guys!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,asneaxl,0,Wed May 27 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"We need to focus on the joy of the year, and how it made us feel, and not the end.  That January run is how I'll remember this team, not the bad luck that struck us late.  Caw Caw!"
AtlantaHawks,37eqxf,el_toastradamus,0,Wed May 27 19:11:02 2015 UTC,Fuck all of you. GO SAINTS!!!
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,rsrl,15,Wed May 27 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've gathered from watching:   Too much iso. We moved away from our ""spurs east"" identity after all-star break. We felt like we could cruise through the opposition, which we did.  We rested our starters during the end of the all star break. Again, to cruise through the opposition, give some rest, and give some changes for our bench to play.  We didn't play our bench much during the playoffs. This is the biggest thing imo. Our identity is to have guys like shelvin Mack and Mike Scott come in and rain threes, but they rarely got to get a rhythm and we only used them due to injuries and because we were losing. Why play then during the regular season then hold the off in the playoffs? One of our advantages was that we had a ""deep"" bench, but that wasn't apparent.  Rebounding. We just can't.  Shot blocker/alterer. We are too small, period.  Threes weren't falling due to the above points and we lost our confidence.  Injuries. Major ones to thabo and Korver, and minor ones to horford, Teague, Carroll, Millsap. Basically our straters and our best bench defender.  Emotion. We let emotion get the best of us especially in the cavs game. They were playing mind games, and we fell right into their trap, resulting in more iso, less passing, not knocking down shots, etc.    That's all I can think of at this moment, but I'm sure I can think of more. Proud of our boys tho, and here's to a new year!"
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,duhpolan,1 point,Wed May 27 23:27:18 2015 UTC,Pero Antic should have played way more in my opinion. But yeah I totally agree with point #3. Bench is what helped us get 60 wins.
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,cloudberrylive,3,Thu May 28 09:09:20 2015 UTC,Really? Our bench sucked during the playoffs. Bud's biggest criticism was that he didn't play the starters together long enough. Our bench +/- was pretty bad. Pero and Scott couldn't hit a shot.
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,Bankingitbig,12,Thu May 28 12:42:33 2015 UTC,I think our issues started with the NYPD
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,RamblinGamblinTiger,9,Thu May 28 00:11:43 2015 UTC,"We bricked a ton of good looks throughout the playoffs.  We aren't built for offensive boards, so not shooting well has a negative multiplier added to it.  Also the refs want LeBron to win."
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,williammc,3,Wed May 27 23:19:24 2015 UTC,Most of our starting five was playing hurt and Thabo absence was a lot bigger than we thought. Honestly it sounds like a cop out but we lost a player who could actually slow down Lebron defensively and we were a worse team without it. Other than that we just weren't moving the ball as well or hitting the shots we normally would make.
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,bearg0d,3,Wed May 27 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"The Cavs were better. We played awful all playoffs but Cleveland just whipped our asses with our two best defenders down.  Experience as well.  Most guys were very new to the playoffs.  And of course rebounding.    No one here will say it but by the third game in the opening round, we all knew that there was trouble brewing.  We just flat out slumped at the absolute worst time to do it."
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,catrotica,2,Fri May 29 07:30:02 2015 UTC,"ultimately it was we had no answer for LeBron, our two guys who did it in the regular season were Thabo (DNP: Police Brutality) and Carroll (who hurt his knee game 1)  Because everyone was too focused on LeBron, he was able to get wide open looks for the snipers on the Cavs.  Also, The cavs had much bigger players who just out rebounded us all game."
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,mehjbmeh,2,Thu May 28 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"Injuries. Sounds like an excuse, but it's the injuries. From the moment things started to get weird in February and only went downhill from there, it mirrors the time when players started to get banged up and out of rhythm."
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,sean7706,5,Wed May 27 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"It's not ""Injuries"" it's WHO was Injured.  With Carroll hurting and Thabo gone we had no one who is even a reasonable match up for LeBron."
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,mehjbmeh,1 point,Thu May 28 18:39:40 2015 UTC,Our team doesn't score without our starters outside of Dennis. Mix and match our starters the whole series=no points. We did play like poopie as well.
AtlantaHawks,37ihgl,TCorlz,1 point,Thu May 28 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"Lack of playoff experience (compare us to Pierce and LeBron, they've done it a million times), rebounding became a much more apparent problem when teams start to play defense, and rotations were a little off for various reasons, causing us to give up massive swings in those minutes. I don't think iso was our problem since those mostly came in desperate time. Also, fuck the NYPD."
AtlantaHawks,37flsp,thrashfan,14,Wed May 27 07:18:01 2015 UTC,Good on those fans.

AtlantaHawks,37flsp,TaTaToothey,19,Wed May 27 14:05:56 2015 UTC,Actually it was the 6th man group that reached out to the team and asked if they could be there at 2am to greet them and cheer for the wonderful season they just had because that is what those guys deserve. But please keep posting nonsense like you actually know what you're talking about.
AtlantaHawks,37flsp,emoney8,0,Wed May 27 14:42:46 2015 UTC,just a joke take it easy my man!
AtlantaHawks,37i9du,subsequent,3,Wed May 27 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"At some point, it looked like the team was just too frustrated and we didn't stick to our plan. We let our opponents harass and fluster us into retaliating, which we did. We took on the bait and played a brand of basketball we were less familiar with causing us to forget our fundamentals. We let our opponents dictate the speed and style of the game. A good example of that is Lebron getting into Millsap's head. Created huge gaps in our defense that pulled Millsap up to the half court line! Lebron beat him every time 1 on 1."
AtlantaHawks,37i8rs,jknox94,5,Wed May 27 20:49:11 2015 UTC,stay classy
AtlantaHawks,37i8rs,BillionaireBob,3,Thu May 28 02:12:39 2015 UTC,Pretty childish. And factually inaccurate.
AtlantaHawks,37i8rs,joshcook,1 point,Thu May 28 03:00:32 2015 UTC,"You are correct. His name is not Tonya Harding, in fact, but Matthew Dellavedova."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,gatoreagle72,6,Wed May 27 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"An ideal offseason, in my opinion, would be to resign Carroll and to let Millsap test free agency. I would move Horford to PF and find a center. Edy Tavares has a lot of potential and there are a handful of bigmen in the upcoming free agency period. Moose is a wonderful bench player who the Hawks should keep and should simply replace Pero.  Hawks are stacked at PG and I would consider getting rid of Mack and or Jenkins. I love Bazemore and Scott, but would consider moving Scott if there were any good trades. I would like to see us pick up a microwave type player who could come in and provide instant offense off the bench, like Lou Williams and Jamal Crawford did for us in the past and similar to how J.R. Smith has been doing for the Cavaliers. Perhaps Austin Daye could be that type of player for the team.   I have very high hopes for the Hawks next year and have simply had an amazing time cheering for this team this season."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Malthous,6,Wed May 27 21:49:41 2015 UTC,I like your idea of Al playing the 4. That was his position in college. I think Bud might want more of a 3pt threat at that position though.
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Skirpy,5,Wed May 27 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"Let's just go ahead and swap Paul for LaMarcus Aldridge. A guy can dream, right?  Then we desperately need a legitimate post presence off the bench. Maybe Koufos or Robin Lopez?  If I'm being realistic, the best scenario I can see is getting Millsap back and then trying to find a different player in the same vein as DeMarre (I think some of his success is due to the system and can be replicated or nearly replicated by someone else). I think the draft pick is very important, as well. We need someone who can grab a rebound at all costs at any point, even if that is all he is good for, or a Jamal Crawford-like spark scorer off the bench in my opinion. And yes, I realize the latter is tough to get outside the top 10 but our front office has shown they can do some special things. Fingers crossed."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,theShah12,2,Wed May 27 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in seeing if DeMarre's production could be replicated with someone else too. He has definite talent, but I think the system is making him more valuable."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,thrashfan,3,Wed May 27 15:48:56 2015 UTC,http://hoopshype.com/free_agency_2015.htm  Danny Green would be awesome or belinelli
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Aviator157,1 point,Wed May 27 15:20:57 2015 UTC,Green would be a good fit. We need depth at that position
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,johnofga,1 point,Wed May 27 15:45:16 2015 UTC,Would really like to snag Green. Especially given Kyle's surgery. He might be the same next year.
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Aviator157,2,Wed May 27 21:51:28 2015 UTC,We also need to remember that Horford is a free agent after next season. We can't spend ALL our money on new players and not plan for paying Hordord what he deserves. Maybe after this next season we will trade Teague and use that 8 mil to resign horford for 19/per
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Papasmurf345,6,Wed May 27 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"The cap explodes after next year, so signing people to max now won't keep us from signing Horford to max when his contract is up."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Bankingitbig,1 point,Wed May 27 22:15:35 2015 UTC,I'm just saying in terms of not putting us in a situation where we have too much money tied up with too few players. We need to be in a position where singing horford to the max doesn't do that.
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,Papasmurf345,0,Wed May 27 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"Re-sign Millsap (max) and Demarre (12 mil?), Elton retires, let Pero go, cause I love him but we could do better. Draft Frank Kaminsky (a better Pero IMO) and bring over Edy Tavares to be our rebounding, shot-blocking machine, which we're already doing. And sign a quality wing with the rest of our money under the luxury tax- Danny Green, Shumpert, Marco Belinelli, Wes Matthews. Don't blow up the Teague/Schroeder combo yet, but if we think it's best we can make a move at the trade deadline to possibly trade Teague. I just think we need a point guard who's willing to pass to lead our talented starting five."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,cosmo_bear,10,Wed May 27 15:28:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think trading Teague would be a good idea, especially if you want a passing PG. I believe Schroder has shown times where he stops the offense, shoots too quickly in the shot clock, or just tries to ISO. I like Teague a lot better especially after the Cavs series too (thought we he played well except for Game 2)."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,thrashfan,3,Wed May 27 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"I don't want to trade Teague either, he's a good starting point guard on a great contract. I just think that when Schroder shows that he is ready for the starting job and can distribute better we should let him take over."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,mexicanpetal,2,Thu May 28 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"I like your thinking, Pero has been underwhelming this year"
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,JustHitTheBall,2,Wed May 27 15:46:51 2015 UTC,"What's Sap's max? Because I'm thinking we don't need to pay more than $15 mill/year considering his age. Also, I'm feeling more around $9 mill/year for Demarre. They can both probably get more elsewhere, but they won't be as effective out of our system. We definitely should not overpay just to keep them. We've learned that lesson by now."

AtlantaHawks,37gshh,dogshenanigans,1 point,Wed May 27 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"Draft Trey Lyles... multiple mocks have him available at 15 and he fits as a stretch 4 and can replace Antic.   Let Jenkins and Antic walk.  Resign The JYD, and Milsap.  Unless Kevin Love opts out of Cleveland.  He fits our system perfectly and I'd max that dude up over Milsap in a heart beat."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,mehjbmeh,1 point,Wed May 27 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"Draft dekker or kaminsky(pretty sure he is gone by this pick), re-sign Demarre and Paul if we don't go after Aldridge. Then sign another good player in free agency. I love the idea of getting Danny green. Biggest needs are definitely a solid rebounder (maybe taveres could fill this), another wing shooter, and a good backup for Demarre"
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,JustHitTheBall,1 point,Wed May 27 23:55:27 2015 UTC,"If we're dreaming here, sign Leonard and resign Caroll. More realistic, resign Caroll and go after Love/Gasol/Aldridge."

AtlantaHawks,37gshh,meep6969,1 point,Thu May 28 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"Resign Millsap and Carroll, let Brand, Pero, and Mack go, draft Frank Kaminsky, bring in some kind of rebounding/shot block guy, and if the stars somehow align I wouldn't mind seeing Kawhi Leonard as a Hawk, god knows he fits the system."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,dogshenanigans,2,Wed May 27 18:00:46 2015 UTC,Mack still has 1 year plus a cheap team option year he's not going anywhere unless he's traded.
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,k_braves,0,Wed May 27 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"Sign Marc Gasol for what would be close to max and sign Millsap or Aldridge to max. Then find some better or cheaper bench players- Pero, Brand, Mack and Salmons leave and we can bring a Splitter in for length, Jamal Crawford back to fill Korvers gap when he sits and keep Dennis, Baze, Scott, Muscala. Then bring over Tavares, draft Dekker and maybe somehow get Willy-Cauley Stein or Kaminsky or even Oubre. Personally I want to keep Teague but if we get bigger name player in a trade then I'm all for it."
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,mexicanpetal,7,Wed May 27 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"Gasol, Millsap and Horford would make things kinda crowded, don't you think?"
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,TheWanster,0,Wed May 27 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"Let Millsap walk, he's too small of a player and it really showed in the last series and honestly looked like he didn't even care to be playing. Resign demarre with a 5 year 50 million deal. Get Marc Gasol somehow some way, as for the draft I haven't been following too closely"
AtlantaHawks,37gshh,mexicanpetal,1 point,Wed May 27 16:55:17 2015 UTC,Cmon Millsap didn't play well but he played hard. I just wanna re-sign our guys and try it again honestly. No way we get gasol.

AtlantaHawks,37gshh,JustHitTheBall,-1,Wed May 27 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"The Pac logo isn't our official team logo, the one with the Hawk and the basketball is. NBA requires every team's official logo to include a basketball. Just FYI"
AtlantaHawks,37g91h,ATLNBA,7,Wed May 27 12:12:02 2015 UTC,"Our players don't have finals experience.. and got tired after 2nd round? I really don't understand any of what happened vs Cleveland. The only time I saw the regular season Hawks was in the 1st half of Game 1. They were 3-1 vs Cavs in regular season.. and I know that supposedly doesn't mean much in playoffs. But I remember vividly the win vs them with Love and healthy Irving.. I didn't see the same Hawks team in the playoffs at all.. even vs Washington and Brooklyn, we looked tired and lazy. For some reason the intensity wasn't there. I'm really puzzled about that fact. Hopefully this will be the start of regular playoff runs, however. Not too many teams come out of no where and make it to the finals.. their players need the experience first, then act upon it later. Number 1 priority is to maintain and improve roster as much as possible."

AtlantaHawks,37g91h,mehjbmeh,2,Wed May 27 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"That Cleveland is bigger than us and it showed in the rebounding.  We get more boards, we win at least 2 of those games  So I wouldn't have a problem with every single player adding 10-15 lbs of muscle in the off season.  That could alleviate a pretty much any issue concerning our size, since its not likely that horford or Millsap will get any taller"
AtlantaHawks,37g91h,PiKappaFratta,-3,Wed May 27 21:02:04 2015 UTC,2 Things: 1. This is a superstar driven league 2. Regular Season doesn't mean anything
AtlantaHawks,37g91h,windmuffin,2,Wed May 27 18:30:09 2015 UTC,Two straight years of both conference finals being the one vs the two seed? Home teams winning about 65% of playoff games historically? I'd say regular season might mean just a little more than people think.
AtlantaHawks,37hjq6,mehjbmeh,12,Wed May 27 18:05:13 2015 UTC,Every team in the nba is going to throw max money at him.

AtlantaHawks,37ele0,reddier5,14,Wed May 27 03:37:11 2015 UTC,Like we don't have injuries. This team does not have a once in a generation star. Any injury to role players hurts more.   Don't bring that shit here. We know you are a better team. We are trying to stay positive. A fan from Cleveland should relate.
AtlantaHawks,37ele0,AlconTheFalcon,21,Wed May 27 03:05:28 2015 UTC,You think he is from Cleveland? The closest he's gotten to Cleveland is when the camera pans the city in the pregame cut scene in NBA2k15.
AtlantaHawks,37ele0,cl-_-cl,-16,Wed May 27 03:21:38 2015 UTC,He said we had that money on the bench cause we overpaid. It's because of injuries
AtlantaHawks,37ele0,Got_Engineers,-30,Wed May 27 03:39:35 2015 UTC,$32.5million of the Cavs payroll has been sitting on the bench this series...
AtlantaHawks,37ele0,reddier5,16,Wed May 27 02:33:36 2015 UTC,Like Lebron is worth the measly 20 mil you are paying him. The point we are trying to make is we outplayed our expectations and should not be disappointed losing to a better team.
AtlantaHawks,37ele0,Orgcore,4,Wed May 27 03:10:19 2015 UTC,"Let's not kid ourselves and pretend LeBron isn't worth $20m...dude is a ticket to the NBA finals.

AtlantaHawks,37et4s,jerms317,1 point,Wed May 27 05:16:51 2015 UTC,There is no curse. It's just our teams have never really been that good to get into the playoffs constantly enough. Idk why people blame it on a curse when we just don't have as many shots at playoff wins as cities like Chicago and Boston/New England. We'll get there. I already see it in this team and the Falcons are really turning it around so far this offseason. Who knows what the Braves are doing tho...
AtlantaHawks,37et4s,ATL_Energy,2,Wed May 27 05:29:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't mean to hit a nerve. Hawks got to the ECF which is an incredible achievement and they haven't reached their potential. Things are on the up for them and hopefully your other teams. I Just thought if I never hear about it again that would imply the franchises having success in the future. Happy cakeday.

AtlantaHawks,37ca81,ArmoredCyclone,-1,Tue May 26 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Life long Cleveland sports fan here, You fuckers would kill to have someone hustle as hard as him. If you play soft you get beat, sorry that's just how it goes. I should know, I've watched years upon years of soft sports teams. Your Hawks now are the Cavs during Jordan's time, soft booty. Just be happy for your franchise turnaround"
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,ManBearPigTroll,2,Wed May 27 16:53:06 2015 UTC,"Cav's fan here, you guys have a good team I think you are two pieces away from really contending for a ship, y'all desperately need a true center with size, like gasol and then you can put horford at the 4.  and you gotta add a true scorer who can get his own without anybody's help, you dont need a superstar because theres like only 4-5 of those in the NBA, but a great scorer who's good off the dribble will do"
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,divorcethroway,-23,Wed May 27 06:12:50 2015 UTC,Cavs fan here. Thought it was funny. Upvoted.
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,Buc07,17,Tue May 26 17:47:02 2015 UTC,Who cares?
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,divorcethroway,-15,Tue May 26 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"You replied, so obviously you?"
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,bojank33,9,Tue May 26 18:33:19 2015 UTC,Fuck off.
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,divorcethroway,-12,Tue May 26 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I don't think you'll see too many Cavs fans back in this sub after tonite. Probably not too many Atlanta fans either."
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,efc4817,18,Tue May 26 21:09:09 2015 UTC,Go put your Miami Heat Lebron Jersey back on
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,the_termenater,15,Tue May 26 23:33:32 2015 UTC,He would put his OLD cavs  jersey on but it has burn holes in it.
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,Bosefchrist92,-6,Wed May 27 00:51:03 2015 UTC,Mm you mad bro?
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,Cleveland_man,-35,Wed May 27 01:08:32 2015 UTC,"I laughed, I don't care what anyone says this is funny. You should start this into a meme.  Do one where Delly injures K-love to get play time. ect. ect."
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,Buc07,41,Tue May 26 17:09:34 2015 UTC,Get out of our subreddit.
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,king_lloyd11,9,Tue May 26 18:26:22 2015 UTC,Why is this even a thing? Cavs fans can come in this sub just as you guys can go into the Cavs sub...
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,adebisi_,12,Tue May 26 21:50:31 2015 UTC,"because the past few days they came in, made negative posts about the hawks, and then upvoted them to the top and downvoted hawks fans posts since theres so many more cavs fans on reddit than hawks fans. so the hawks fans have become fed up"
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,king_lloyd11,2,Tue May 26 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"Dunno man, looks like that this Cavs fan is supporting OP's post and being pretty nice about it. Seems like he's the one getting downvoted hard because of his flair. If they are making abusive posts, your mods should be taking care of it."
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,adebisi_,10,Tue May 26 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually a Hawks fan either but the frustration is understandable. the Hawks were pretty well liked all year and now they're going through the ""opponent of Lebron treatment"" where the entirety of /r/NBA turns against not only the team but the fans, calls them whiners, ect. just look at how people talked about the Bulls this year, Pacers and nets last year, most teams that play Lebron in the playoffs end up getting a lot of shit because Lebron band wagoners come in and up vote a bunch of toxic posts and public opinion will tend to go with whatever posts are upvoted  to the top."
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,king_lloyd11,-7,Tue May 26 23:41:11 2015 UTC,"But /r/NBA hasn't really turned against them. Hawks fans are letting Lebron trolls get under their skin and the Hawks have looked like they've let the Cavs do the same. I can see how that hits a nerve, but how people react to the shit is totally on themselves. There was a troll in the Raptors sub during the Wizards series that would keep creating accounts and talking shit, but he was generally either shit talked back or ignored until the mods deleted his stuff.  That said, as I said above, flooding and spamming, that's a situation for the mods to take care of. Telling other team's fans to stay off your subreddit is useless and that I'm always going to do it anyway regardless of being told to or not. Like you can't be territorial of the internet haha."
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,adebisi_,13,Tue May 26 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"the top post in an /r/nba thread was ""delly is making the hawks his bitch"" there are highly upvoted posts saying (my wording) ""the hawks used to be likable but really turned out to be a bunch of whiny bitches""  they have definitely been turned on"
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,king_lloyd11,-3,Wed May 27 01:54:37 2015 UTC,"But that isn't because they're playing Lebron like you seem to imply. It's because they haven't really shown up in this series. Other than game 3, there really wasn't a really competitive game where I didn't think that the Cavs didn't have it in hand. On top of not showing up, they let the Cavs under their skin and looked to be shook by them. I think trolls from the fanbases of any team would talk crap with this showing."
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,adebisi_,7,Wed May 27 03:08:27 2015 UTC,"I've been reading reddit for a while, I can tell you that there is a definite pattern of Lebron opponents in the playoffs getting hated on hard, the only exception really being the Spurs just because they played so well"
AtlantaHawks,37ca81,Cleveland_man,-26,Wed May 27 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"Watch this magic: www.reddit.com/r/atlantahawks+clevelandcavs+nba   You don't even have a subreddit, just another series of gameday links"

AtlantaHawks,37ca81,Cleveland_man,-19,Tue May 26 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"That isn't a troll, that is how you can view multiple reddits at the same time. So when you say i'm invading your reddit i'm actually in a few."

Given all of our injuries I definitely did not see a sweep coming, but you guys certainly had your fair share of issues as well.    I was definitely hoping for a more...civil...series between our two subreddits (and, as a whole, both of our subs are pretty equally at blame here, although for differing things), but hey, that's what tends to happen when people get heated during the playoffs.  I'd like to believe it's the vocal minority in both cases being the idiots, but...the playoffs sometimes bring out the worst in people.  Anyway, wishing you guys the best of luck with the injuries and whatever else in the off-season.  No reason you guys can't come back even stronger next year!"
AtlantaHawks,37euxy,Sartuk,9,Wed May 27 03:00:40 2015 UTC,Thanks and hope you guys take the title. Always best to lose to the champions.

This was a really, really good team that had some atrocious injury luck at the worst possible time. It happens, unfortunately. This playoff season seemed to be rough to many teams, but no one seemed to get as brutalized as the Hawks.  This team will be poised to make another deep playoff run next year. Count on it."

And it was still pretty good even after it happened with a lot of you.  Hope we can see you guys in the playoffs again next year.  I think you guys need to pick up a scorer in the off season.  You need someone that can take over and shoulder the load.    I know first hand how it is to watch a 60+ win team disappear.  Take it from a life long Cleveland fan..  There's always next year.

I hope your team is as exciting next year as it was this year. I watched almost every hawks game this year starting in lat December and loved your team so much.

AtlantaHawks,37euxy,BillClintonSaxMaster,-14,Wed May 27 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to play hard and lose honestly, but losing by 40 in a 4-game sweep is just an intentional insult to fans.  It's a way of mocking them for even caring enough to watch.  And that's sad, because it means the team's players hate the very people who make their careers possible."
AtlantaHawks,37euxy,welfarecuban,17,Wed May 27 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know what the words you're using mean, or else you wouldn't have put such a meaningless string of words together."
AtlantaHawks,37euxy,BillClintonSaxMaster,-7,Wed May 27 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like this - imagine a chef who is putting together a high-quality soup.  Things seem to be going well, but then right toward the end, the chef dumps a cup of manure right into the pot.  That's what the Hawks did in this series.  They dumped manure all over their fans.    Now, to be fair, BEFORE the ECF, they were doing well.  But the ECF itself?  That was a horrendous insult."
AtlantaHawks,37euxy,-Runaway,2,Wed May 27 07:53:33 2015 UTC,"Ehh, not as a whole. Game 1 we didn't play well and lost by 5 I think? I didn't think the refereeing helped but you'll never have a truly even game with the refs. Game 2 was shit. Game 3 our guys played with a bunch of effort without our biggest impact player of the game and made it about as close as it could get. Tonight was very ugly.   It hurts when the focal point of your offense gets hurt and you have to try to redefine yourself as an offense. Even when Korver wasn't hitting, he was spreading out the court. +60 on the court, -30 off the court I believe. I'm not happy with how we looked but it was the perfect storm against us. A well executing cavs team against a struggling/hobbled hawks team.  LeBron has showed several times that he can take a group of C-rate role players farther than they should go because he just makes them better.  I don't even know if this is a response to your post but its a slight rant that makes me feel better."
AtlantaHawks,37euxy,Papasmurf345,15,Wed May 27 03:56:52 2015 UTC,ooof. fuck right off.
AtlantaHawks,37e4i0,Martinsek,58,Tue May 26 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly these people trolling aren't even true fans of the game of basketball. As a Cavs fan, and a basketball fan, I don't see how a true basketball fan can have anything but respect for what the Hawks have done this season. I'm sorry for those who are trolling and I hope it doesn't damn your opinions of us Cavs fans too much."
AtlantaHawks,37e4i0,JayBomb7,7,Wed May 27 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"I know they aren't, I've seen true Cavs fans and I've seen the douchey bandwagon fans. You're one of the good ones"

He was already in double digits and if I'm not mistaken, the leading scorer in the game at the time. Would be nice to see him come back in hungry and combo up with Teague who will be looking to score some serious points with those fast breaks and quick moves to the basket. I'd like to see Blazemore maybe toss a few daggers if he can help it and keep up the intensity on defense. We have a damn game to win out there. Let's go get em tonight!"

AtlantaHawks,37f682,Starsy,5,Wed May 27 04:26:56 2015 UTC,"Just FYI - ESPN published today that we will have $24.6 million in cap space...I'm not going to crunch the numbers myself (nor could I), but one of these articles is wrong.  http://espn.go.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/12958036/nba-roster-reload-next-moves-atlanta-hawks"
AtlantaHawks,37f682,Remix0588,1 point,Wed May 27 12:43:05 2015 UTC,"Cap holds. $24.6 million is including Millsap's and Carroll's cap holds (as well as some others). For practical purposes, that means the $24.6 million is after we re-sign them. I'm assuming we give them more, that's why I use $19 million below."
AtlantaHawks,37f682,gatoreagle72,1 point,Thu May 28 02:08:19 2015 UTC,ESPN accounted for the salary of our 2015 first-round draft pick. That's the difference I believe.
AtlantaHawks,37f682,BishonenOtaku,5,Wed May 27 13:35:18 2015 UTC,15 mil for a rookie? That's a bit hard to believe
AtlantaHawks,37f682,gatoreagle72,2,Wed May 27 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right about that. Not sure about the rest of that difference.   EDIT: According to the article, there are other cap holds as well"
AtlantaHawks,37f682,drrhythm2,3,Wed May 27 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"If we were to throw maximum money at both Millsap and Carroll, we'd still have almost $19 million to go before the luxury tax. And with the salary cap blowing up after next season, there's no strong reason not to go over the cap for '15-'16.  We could bring back all the important pieces of the team no matter the coast and still sign a max free agent. We could bring in Draymond Green (restricted, but the Warriors would have to go into the luxury tax to resign him), or DeMarre Carroll, or Kevin Love, or Brook Lopez, or Danny Green, or Josh Smith.  My money's on max money to bring back Millsap, big money ($12 million range) to bring back DeMarre, and instead of a single big free agent, 2-3 quality upgrades. Bring in Danny Green, Fredette for his shooting, and a couple other quality backups. You're not going to get much better than Teague, Korver, Carroll/Green, Millsap, and Horford as your starting lineup."
AtlantaHawks,37f682,dillardPA,4,Wed May 27 04:36:31 2015 UTC,"Honest question: Doesn't the starting lineup need to improve if we want a real shot at a championship? Struggling through 2 rounds and completely flaming out in the ECS leads me to believe the starting lineup is flawed somewhere (to the extent that winning 60 games and going to the ECS is ""flawed"")."
AtlantaHawks,37f682,Super_Black_Brother,3,Wed May 27 11:58:58 2015 UTC,"Starting lineup has got to improve. All of these people saying we just need to add a couple of people to our bench are a little too optimistic to me. I think our lack of individual talent really showed in the playoffs when teams had more time to prepare and really game plan against our system.  We really need a true center so that Horford can play PF. I think we should let Millsap go, just don't think he's worth near the money he's going to demand. We should try our best at keeping DeMarre and seeing what we can get at center."
AtlantaHawks,37f682,drrhythm2,2,Wed May 27 16:28:41 2015 UTC,We need someone who's a great rebounder.
AtlantaHawks,37f682,Coachpatato,1 point,Wed May 27 12:25:52 2015 UTC,Hard to argue with that. Everyone is talking about how great Millsap is but he seemed largely ineffective in the playoffs. So was Korver.
AtlantaHawks,37f682,drrhythm2,4,Wed May 27 12:36:47 2015 UTC,I think Millsaps shoulder injury was probably worse than we know.
AtlantaHawks,37f682,Coachpatato,1 point,Wed May 27 13:29:30 2015 UTC,"Probably. The question for me, though, is if we would want to enter the playoffs with the same starting five, or not. Is the answer different bench pieces, or is there a flaw with our big five that would make it tough to reach the finals?"
AtlantaHawks,37f682,drrhythm2,2,Wed May 27 13:33:32 2015 UTC,I say yes. I mean sure I wish we could get a superstar but its not that easy. Our starting five was good enough to win 60 games and get to the ECF even while banged up and lacking experience. We're still ahead of where everyone thought we would be.
AtlantaHawks,37f682,Coachpatato,1 point,Wed May 27 13:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you can bank on the ""even while banged up"" part. You could argue the teams we played were at least as banged up as we were, if not more so - at least in terms of critical players being out for games or even the entire series.   Before this year I didn't understand what all the commentators meant when they said that playoff basketball is different; now I get it. It's more intense, more physical. The refs let you get away with more. I can see the value in having a go-to stud player. The Hawks got too cold, too often. Started games well, and fell off through the middle half.   It's great we made it to the ECF, but we barely got there. 0.2 seconds and Pierce's shot puts a dagger into our souls, and they may well have ended up taking that series. In, what, 16 post-season games we only really dominated 1 of them. The outcome was seriously in doubt right up to the end in every other game we won. That tells me that, while we may have been the slightly better team, it would have taken very little for us to lose one of the earlier series."
AtlantaHawks,37f682,Wood80,1 point,Wed May 27 13:58:05 2015 UTC,"I mean I agree with you that we would benefit greatly from having all-nba first team type superstar. The question is how do you get that? Do you think we should trade away all our players and tank? Or tread water for years and try to luck out with a Harden type trade? Or should we try again with a starting that won 60 games, add some bench pieces and will have more experience next time?   I prefer the third option. It seems like our best choice."
AtlantaHawks,37f682,RuntheFlats,1 point,Wed May 27 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"Where though? Half of me agrees, but the other half doesn't really see where we need improvement. Mostly, I think we just needed experience."

AtlantaHawks,37exyv,Raydioactive,1 point,Wed May 27 19:39:35 2015 UTC,"You want some real optimism?  That video is nearly a year and a half old and we're suspected to sign him to the team over the summer.  I can't wait to see the progress he's made. It's probably Bud's dream scenario to be able to play transition defense, not crash the boards, but not completely give up on rebounding. With Tavares' size around the basket I really think he's going to be a huge niche player for us.   Bonus: Here's a recent picture of Tavares with a selfie stick https://twitter.com/waltertavares22/status/601746268008927232"
AtlantaHawks,37exyv,fireglz,1 point,Thu May 28 03:13:47 2015 UTC,"So considering he doesn't have a horrible summer- is he expected to be on the roster next season?  Maybe take Brand or Antics spot on the roster?  And how developed is his post game, offensive and defensive?"

He is pretty raw offensively but from the scouting reports I've read and clips I've seen, he has great defensive instincts and quickness for a guy his size (7'3 with 7'9"" wingspan). Tough to project how he will translate to the NBA at this point though."

AtlantaHawks,37f994,atomsej,2,Wed May 27 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thought we could have beat the Cavs if we played to our potential and had everyone healthy? I mean it's not like 75% of our team was hurt or injured or anything. You have to remember that we were the best team in the league at one point, even better than the warriors."
AtlantaHawks,37f994,DTX180,2,Wed May 27 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"Losing Thabo was obviously big in this series since he was a key defender on Lebron. To be fair to the Cavs they werent exactly healthy themselves though.  With that said, the team has some holes. I think we need to keep one of Millsap or Carroll, but im afraid we might lose both. The bigger statement is how much do free agents believe in our system. When we were trying to get a Chris Paul or Dwight Howard, they didnt really want to come here even though we offered em max deals. Not to sound like a espn talking head, but have we changed the culture enough is a big question imo. I think smart free agents will be pleasantly surprised here."
AtlantaHawks,37f994,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,2,Wed May 27 13:30:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately that is one thing about us that ESPN has right. In the NBA, where salary caps and max contracts are a thing, ""superstars"" can essentially write their own contracts. Just paying a guy isn't enough."

AtlantaHawks,37ep9b,ALLBEEFWIENERS,5,Wed May 27 02:21:59 2015 UTC,Watched a majority of our games this year from start to finish and saw how great we could be (January). Just disappointing to see us finish the year the way we did
AtlantaHawks,37ep9b,jpeazee,3,Wed May 27 03:02:47 2015 UTC,Exactly. I think the team and organization will grow and come back stronger next year
AtlantaHawks,37ep9b,jpeazee,3,Wed May 27 03:06:45 2015 UTC,Let's hope so. This is a huge offseason. We could either strike gold with a huge signing or potentially lose out on 2 of our starters with no return... Let's hope it's not the latter.
AtlantaHawks,37ep9b,GT2018,3,Wed May 27 03:15:10 2015 UTC,"It's too late to watch now, but I felt the same way in each game this series when we were down big. I kept watching though because this was still a hell of a season. The Hawks have historically been terrible, now they're finally good, and you give up just because they won't win it all? Finishing up in the top 4 is way better than anything I've ever seen from this team. I kept watching just out of respect for one hell of a season. Like I said though I see where you're coming from."
AtlantaHawks,37es7n,virtualdrummer,4,Wed May 27 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"Lol...My dad is pissed right now, but I'm going to forward this to him.  It will make him laugh.  Thank you."
AtlantaHawks,37es7n,CLEANSH0T,2,Wed May 27 02:48:30 2015 UTC,He knows the burn all to well
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,dawgsfan1,3,Wed May 27 03:01:55 2015 UTC,"We need to add another shooter. When Korver fell on his face this series (35% from 3) our offense went to hell and that cant happen. A lot of people have us taking Sam Dekker who is a bit raw as a shooter but hes got a ton of potential because of the intelligent system he came out of and hes incredibly athletic and aggressive.   Pero needs to get the fuck out of Atlanta and never come back unless its to play against us. This leads to me saying that we need to find some bigs. 2. Pero needs to be replaced and barring some kind of major steps in the offseason for Moose (which isnt really out of the question after he plays in summer league i assume) we'll be in a dire situation here. I assume we try to bring back Millsap but whether or not we do, we need to bulk up on our bench. We cant afford to have these monster decline in rebounding numbers when Horford and Millsap sit (millsap is below average on the boards anyways so that might be a moot point). Maybe they bring over one of the bigs from overseas? I dont know. I dont know what we do with Scott. He needs to get his mind right. He went from reliable 6th man to complete garbage in a heartbeat after the injury so if he can return to form than that helps, but as it stands RIGHT NOW, I dont consider Scott a reliable option off the bench as a go to 4 or 5  Need to add another perimeter defender off the bench. I dont think we'll see DMC back in Atlanta, someone like the Lakers are going to offer him considerably more money then we will be willing to match and frankly he needs to get paid and not take a home town deal.   So its tricky. We may end up starting Bazemore at the 3 next year but thats a significant drop off in offense if thats the case. We may end up having a situation where Baze and Dekker are shared starters at the 3. Of course maybe we end up signing someone completely unforeseen.  Teague needs to improve his three point shooting, as does Dennis. Horford needs to improve his post game and Millsap needs to improve his defense and rebounding.   So the additions I see needing to be made:   shooter perimeter defender (the fact this team fell apart because one guy in thabo got hurt is a major concern going forward) 2 reliable bigs added to the bench. somehow. antic needs to be gone"
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,RaptureVeteran,2,Wed May 27 03:30:32 2015 UTC,"No reason for Pero to totally leave town. He'll be cheap and he knows the system. While I think him and Moose should swap roles, there's no reason to get rid of Pero. At worst he can occupy the role that Brand did this season that will be opened up once he retires."
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,uckTheSaints,2,Wed May 27 05:57:19 2015 UTC,What type of shooter do you need? An Eric Gordon or Monta who's more adept at creating his own shot?
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,RaptureVeteran,2,Wed May 27 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If Korver had a twin brother who was just as good as Korver I wouldnt sign his twin brother. Korver being so inept at putting the ball on the ground is one of the things that killed the offense when teams were able to scout us and put forth the attention to shutting down Korver. We absolutely need a guy like Monta or Gordon, the problem is, we wont get either if we end up resigning both DMC and Millsap. So who knows. If we resign both of them we'll have to find the shooter in the first round and hope he doesnt play awful as a rookie, that or hope a guy like Monta takes a deal."
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,atad123,4,Wed May 27 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"I think we should let Paul walk, honestly. His game is still mainly athleticism and he is about to be 30. He relies on his face up game to get by usually bigger defenders. Not many post moves, a lot better from three but still inconsistent pushing horf to the 4, would be ideal in my eyes. If we could land Marc Gasol I would be through the roof"
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,RaptureVeteran,2,Wed May 27 03:54:13 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, though Millsap was a beast before the shoulder injury. But Millsap and Horford are too similar, and Horford has a more consistent and useful midrange, and is a natural 4.   I honestly think Marc Gasol solves almost all our problems (great defender, gets rebounds, and has great offense with excellent midrange), but I doubt Memphis lets him walk. An interesting alternative would be Brook Lopez, who I think we can get because the Nets will look to rebuild sooner or later, or Monroe, who is talented offensively, and can get boards."
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,mexicanpetal,1 point,Wed May 27 04:44:42 2015 UTC,"Im of the same opinion actually. I dont like Millsap, never have. But I also dont like big men who wish they were 2 guards and I dont know another big in the NBA who thinks so differently of himself and his position than Millsap does. He's also an atrocious defender for a guy who wishes he was a 2 guard.   The only situation I see us letting Millsap go, is if we end up getting Frank Kaminsky, who is a slower but comparable player because of Franks ability to put the ball on the floor and also stretch you out, hes honestly a better defender right now and probably a smarter rebounder right now. If we get Frank, it wont shock me to see us not bother resigning millsap, you resign DMC, then you have more money to go after better 6th men"
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,Human_highlight,2,Wed May 27 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"You said it before I could, I think Monta Ellis is somebody we should look into."
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,cripplercrawlspace,2,Wed May 27 03:14:25 2015 UTC,He would be an interesting fit. Would he be a sixth man? Could Kyle come off the bench In a pinch
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,dillardPA,2,Wed May 27 03:19:32 2015 UTC,I mean Kyle has been a bench player his whole career. If we got someone like him Korver would still see sets I think but not start or get as many minutes.
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,Nearph,2,Wed May 27 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with that, I mean a guy like Monta gives us a lot more freedom on offense I feel like. Two true ball handlers on the floor will help with some more 1-5, 1-4 or 2-5, 2-4 pick and roll sets. Or even have Jeff, Monta and Kyle on the floor at the same time for end game offense seems pretty potent too"
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,Im_just_a_lamp,2,Wed May 27 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"With Millsap being on the wrong side of 30, I'm scared of getting into a Joe Johnson 2.0 situation that cripples our cap space. He's going to be seeking financial security for the home stretch of his career and I really don't want us to be the ones forking over the money."
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,uckTheSaints,1 point,Wed May 27 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"Paul isn't as prolific as Joe, but I see what you're saying. I think people are over evaluating the market a bit I'll be surprised if Paul gets Max money thrown at him."
AtlantaHawks,37ew9n,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Wed May 27 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing is finding a leader. I know its cliche but its true. We need someone to rally around and someone that can separate himself and change the game on his own at times.  Maybe it'll be a guy we have, but I think our best shot is getting Marc Gasol. We have a ton of money, he'd be the star of the team but he won't get hounded like he would in other places, we're a great offensive team on the rise which isn't something the Grizzlies could give him and I think he'd work really well in our system.  I think in terms of free agents we should go after Demarre, I could care less about Millsap to be honest. He's getting a bit old and I've never been big on the guy. I'm interested to see how Tavares does and if he can adjust to the NBA; he's certainly an exciting prospect giving his physique."

I hope Horford brings all the frustration from the last game and uses it to dunk on everybody and Mike Scott goes back to the 20 PPG bench scorer that I knew and loved and Shelvin Mack goes 6/6 from three again. Honestly I just want to win a game so people stop shitting on us it doesn't have to be a blow out or anything.Nah fuck that let's win four in a row.
AtlantaHawks,37bppa,bearg0d,4,Tue May 26 13:29:22 2015 UTC,"Need to cut Mike a bit of slack. Remember he missed a heap of games just before the playoffs, then played a few games and then when the playoffs began he barely got any minutes. I know players are supposed to come off the bench 'ready' but the past month he hasn't been able to get in a rhythm at all."

AtlantaHawks,37bppa,bearg0d,-4,Tue May 26 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"And which talk is that?   How he has single-handledly taken out at least 3 players during this year's playoffs thus far, whether by injury or ejection? You can't deny his dirtiness, there's a valid reason why guys want to throw elbows at him. Whenever there's a close-up shot on TV of players looking at him, it's usually a look of pure hatrid. These guys know each other pretty well and play against each other all season, their body language speaks wonders about the general opinion of this guy.    I actually give Horford and Gibson credit for not completely annihilating him. If you're going to get ejected, why not go out big?  Ok, I'm done talking about it."
AtlantaHawks,37bppa,THR33ZUS_BANGS,7,Tue May 26 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Like I said it's just petty and serves no point. It's understandable from any other point f view that what Horford did, intentionally hitting another player while he was on the ground, is worse then getting under other players skin and diving for loose balls recklessly."
AtlantaHawks,37bppa,bearg0d,-3,Tue May 26 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"If you call that Figure Four Leg Lock he put on Gibson ""diving for loose balls recklessly"", you sir, are very naive.   Rick Flair would be proud."

I'm willing to bet money CMB dedicated a portion of film sessions regarding this scrub and about steering clear of scuffles with him. One of two things can happen, and neither are good: A) twist an ankle/sprain a knee or B) retaliation and ejection. He's a scrawny white guy and automatically gets the benefit of the doubt every time.   We can agree to disagree, and your downvotes are amusing. Keep em coming. CAW CAW!"
AtlantaHawks,37bppa,THR33ZUS_BANGS,8,Tue May 26 18:58:20 2015 UTC,I didn't downvote you but like I said it doesn't really matter what his track record is because there is no proof he's out there trying to injure other players. What your post is saying is that our guys should try to injure him and that he deserved to get elbowed and I can't rock with that. Imagine if Cavs fans were saying they should send Perkins in to hurt Horford for what he did to one of there guys and trying to use evidence of every hard foul he's ever committed to justify it.
AtlantaHawks,37bppa,bearg0d,-1,Tue May 26 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"there is no proof he's out there trying to injure other players   Exhibit A  In the case of Horford and Korver, when you launch your body at another player's legs, what more are you trying to achieve? He certainly isn't going to admit he's playing dirty, if that's what you're looking for.   And you're taking what I said out of context. I never said our guys should go out there and try to hurt him. I said:   there's a valid reason why guys want to throw elbows at him   Just because I understand why a guy would want to fight him, it doesn't mean I condone that type of behavior. Shit, who am I kidding? I would fight him.   All jokes aside, we're fighting for the same squad (I hope). My OP was just me stating how bad I would like Horford to take out his frustration and have an amazing game. Here's the PG version of what I meant to say ;)   I can't wait to watch Horford shit all over Dellevadova score a triple double and deny Dellevadova tonight.    I'm just fired up, nothing but peace and love to all hawks fans."

AtlantaHawks,37cgca,FutureShock25,11,Tue May 26 16:41:53 2015 UTC,Players now see that this system works. Can't speak for the other intangibles but we're one of the top two teams in the East. Making us a great destination for guys seeking a winner.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,thrashfan,6,Tue May 26 16:50:35 2015 UTC,I think the success of Carroll and Millsap really help us out. Solid players may be willing to come here cheap and use our system to get themselves a bigger pay day. That's fine with me.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,Aviator157,9,Tue May 26 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"this is correct, and agents know this."
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,forgotmyothernames,7,Tue May 26 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"I heard Brand talk a bit about this issue on the radio. He also said that practices are intense but relatively short. It's not a 4-5 hour grind everyday, and players like that."

AtlantaHawks,37cgca,mehjbmeh,6,Tue May 26 21:16:54 2015 UTC,Chicago is nowhere near any kind of reboot.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,ajg47,-1,Wed May 27 01:41:23 2015 UTC,You'd have to change your style of offense with durant.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,cl-_-cl,9,Tue May 26 19:35:47 2015 UTC,No you wouldn't.  Durant makes quick moves doesn't hold the ball long in one place and has every offensive skill there is.  He would fit in pretty much any offense.  The only change that would happen for the most part is plays would be designed to end with a durant isolation at the end of the shot clock if you didn't get a good shot out of the motion.

I'd like to find a guy who can really take over a game when crunch time comes, but still play to the system that has been created.  I'd love to see a big man come that can really play down in the post.  It would be nice to have someone who you could dump the ball down to and just muscle their way at the basket.    Just my wish list.  Doesn't have to be a ""Superstar"" but just someone who says ""I'm winning this game for the team""."

AtlantaHawks,37cgca,gobigred3562,10,Tue May 26 17:21:07 2015 UTC,No one wants Melo. We can stop talking about him forever now.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,beefsupreme,2,Tue May 26 17:38:09 2015 UTC,Did I imply that we should want Carmelo Anthony?
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,gobigred3562,0,Tue May 26 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno, you ""paged"" him. As a player though, he is irrelevant and we can stop talking about him."

AtlantaHawks,37cgca,beefsupreme,1 point,Tue May 26 21:15:23 2015 UTC,I don't think a ball dominant player such as Carmelo would work well in our system anyway. The only thing nice about a player such as him would be the increased fan base.

AtlantaHawks,37cgca,mehjbmeh,2,Tue May 26 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"We have several players (Millsap and Carroll come to mind) who are each looking at new contracts worth at least 10-20 million more than they signed with the Hawks. If Thabo stays healthy he would also be playing above his value. We've signed Kent Bazemore who's played strong minutes as a starter for a 2 year, 4 million dollar contract.  I'm hoping the Hawks will develop a reputation as a team where you can sign if you feel like you're undervalued as a player in the free agent market. There's nothing wrong with attracting talented, undervalued free-agents with a chip on their shoulder who believe in what Coach Bud's system represents.   Honestly, I want Kevin Love to be devalued during his FA hunt. I could see him signing a deal with the Hawks until the new CBA if the money he's after isn't there. Give us your slighted, your peeved and your hard workers. We'll give them a shot at a big contract."
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,fireglz,1 point,Tue May 26 18:10:53 2015 UTC,Kevin Love has never struck me as a hard worker. Let alone someone who cared about how devalued he's been.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Tue May 26 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I don't think he makes the adaptations he made throughout the regular season this year if he wasn't a hard worker. He's a solitary individual, which can be misconstrued for him being lazy, but he doesn't seem to have any history of laziness.  He's a PF that shoots 3's at a (relatively) high percentage. I feel like he'd be an absolutely perfect fit in our system, but there's a lot of volatility to this NBA offseason so it's all really a crapshoot."
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,mexicanpetal,1 point,Tue May 26 21:29:22 2015 UTC,Kevin Love isn't really devalued that is just the media saying that.  He might not be able to choose where to go anymore but he could get the max somewhere.  He really would be a great fit for you guys both offensively and helping your rebounding issues.   Very unlikely he opts out though and unlikely he goes to atlanta if he does.

AtlantaHawks,37cgca,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Tue May 26 21:55:44 2015 UTC,I think we should look at trying to get Drummond; good traditional rim protector that could give Horford more outside looks.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,lackingcredibility9,2,Tue May 26 20:21:20 2015 UTC,I have been looking at the free agents and it's Monroe who will be the free agent.  Drummond has a $3million team option which they are certainly going to exercise.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,theDrunkWookie,2,Tue May 26 20:41:15 2015 UTC,He's an offensive center and not a very good rim protector.   Horford is a better rim protector.  He could help you rebounding though.
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,lackingcredibility9,3,Wed May 27 11:16:53 2015 UTC,"Did you mean to say defensive center? He averaged ~13 PPG and almost 2 BPG. Maybe I'm crazy, but I see Drummond as the defensive center and Horford as an offensive option, whether that be PF or C."
AtlantaHawks,37cgca,lackingcredibility9,2,Tue May 26 21:52:57 2015 UTC,Yea I'm an idiot and mixed up Drummond with Monroe

AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,llawinga,18,Tue May 26 02:51:43 2015 UTC,I have to totally agree with you here. If this is considered a Flagrant I then so should have Horford's. The ref last night told coach Bud that he HAD to give the Flag. II given the circumstances of making contact shoulders and above.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,lm763208,25,Tue May 26 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"Or you know, maybe they got the Howard one wrong. I mean they are both clearly eject-able plays."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Excitedpenguin,0,Tue May 26 03:09:20 2015 UTC,Both made a lot of contact towards the head area without a basketball play.. Both should have been tossed. Couldn't agree more. Hawks.. we get you're mad but can you seriously see Delly do anything to get elbowed in the head? I just can't.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,legendcat,29,Tue May 26 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"Commentary by the announcers was spot-on, too. This was more vicious, directed at and hit the other player's head. Should have been a flagrant 2.  The difference? The refs recognized that it was not unprovoked. Howard's response, while not justified, was understandable in the context of the situation.   In the Hawks game, the refs T'd up Dellavodova because he rolled up on Horford. Horford's foul was not judged in the context of Dellavodova's action (the refs admitted that post-game). That is crazy.  In both situations, there was lots of ""chippiness"" back and forth. It boiled over briefly. No one got hurt. In Houston, it's a flagrant 1 and move on. In Cleveland, the refs tip the whole balance of the game in favor of Team LeBron..."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,nerdyintentions,4,Tue May 26 03:05:12 2015 UTC,I'm not usually one for conspiracies but the NBA could stand to benefit from a little drama in the Warriors/Rockets series where as they want King James in the finals ASAP.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,THR33ZUS_BANGS,4,Tue May 26 14:38:03 2015 UTC,Conspiracies and the NBA go together like peas and carrots.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,beefsupreme,8,Tue May 26 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"It's funny how fast everyone forgot about Donaghy. The dude admitted that he and other ref's were deliberately assisting in the rigging of games. He even named names of refs that are STILL OFFICIATING cough cough Joey Crawford.   It's so obvious that the NBA wants GS and lebrawn in the finals its sickening. Hell, they didn't even want us in the ECF.  From Donaghy's book:   During one particular summer game, Duke Callahan, Mark Wunderlich, and I made it to the three-minute mark in the first quarter without calling a foul. We were running up and down the court, laughing our asses off as the players got hammered with no whistles."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Seany_,5,Tue May 26 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Don't worry it'll be upgraded to fragrant 2. Their reasoning behind calling Horford for the flagrant 2 mirrors Howard's hit to a tee, they don't wanna look like jokes."

AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,insert_name_here_,21,Tue May 26 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"The refs literally ended our season with that call. Even though I agree with Horfords ejection, its upsetting to see a star player do something worse and stay in the game."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,fuuuuuuuuuuuck216,15,Tue May 26 03:10:29 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they'll maybe add to Howard's tomorrow. That was worse than Horford's in my opinion. Should've been a clear cut ejection today.

Horford's thing could have been construed as an accident. Horford gets ejected. Howard slaps Bogut with his arm/elbow in the head. Howard stays. Fucking bullshit."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Steffnov,8,Tue May 26 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"Does Howard get the ""star treatment"" too? I've never had a problem with refs, but this year's CF's have been a turning point I think..."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Excitedpenguin,2,Tue May 26 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"These whole play-offs have seen some horrible officiating. This series is certainly up there with the worst, but they've been total shit the last month. Not sure what the refs were told before this post-season, but it's been disgusting."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,tomtomtumnus,-28,Tue May 26 08:42:04 2015 UTC,"Horford's thing could have been construed as an accident.   Yes if your a blindly biased hawks fan, i could see that it could."

I think it was fair and square considering Kyrie didn't play, him being out the last two games has given the hawks a break if anything. It does suck that Horford was doing so well when he was thrown, woulda been an even crazier game. But we can't dwell on the what ifs, gotta focus on tonight, good luck to the Hawks"
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,thisbaseball1,4,Tue May 26 18:08:50 2015 UTC,I just want some consistency.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Hot_Lanta,-3,Tue May 26 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"You don't want some consistency. You already get a high level of consistency between games. You want absolute consistency and absolute perfection, and you're never going to get that from a heavily officiated contact sport."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,thisbaseball1,5,Tue May 26 14:25:54 2015 UTC,No..... I want consistency on calls like this. And that's not to much to ask for either.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,thisbaseball1,-3,Tue May 26 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"You want consistency on just specifically this type of call? Other types of inconsistencies wouldn't bother you? I don't believe that at all. So you want consistency on all calls, right? The plays being referenced are two different plays in two different situation with two different levels of instigation (Bogut's shot deserved a foul call in the first place, whereas Delladova didn't commit a foul) and two different crews with two different biases calling each. Both were called flagrants immediately, which already reaches a certain level of consistency. So what that means is you want absolutely perfect consistency which you're never going to get from heavily officiated contact sports. Even if you had the exact same play in the exact same sport happen at the exact same time at two different places in the world, you will very often get two different calls despite the level of training these officials go through. It's inevitable. There's inevitable human error in the process of officiating in sports. It happens in baseball. It happens in soccer. It happens in football and rugby and hockey.  One last point: You're telling me that you (and Hawks fans in general) wouldn't be angry about Horford's ejection if Howard had been ejected the next day for this? I know that's not true because one, a great many Hawks fans were already angry with the call as soon as it happened, and weren't satisfied with the NBA explanation, and two, are now saying that both plays ""should have resulted in an ejection,"" not that ""both plays should have resulted in the same call."" Fans here would still be angry if Howard's resulted in an ejection. So you don't want consistency, per se, you want calls to consistently go your way.   Edit: so much salt being swept under the rug today."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,RayZR,5,Tue May 26 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"Horford's deserved an ejection. This one also probably deserved an ejection. Two different crews worked each game. That's all there is to it, really."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Shmexy,4,Tue May 26 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"I understand my commenting here likely isn't welcome, and I apologize in advance if I'm trodding on any toes, but my interpretation is that the reason Howard received a Flagrant 1 is because it wasn't entirely unprovoked.  It really did look like Bogut was latching on unnecessarily and for an extended period of time after the play just to keep Howard from being able to make it back to defense.  It wasn't right of Howard to swing around like he did, but I don't think a Flagrant 1 was the wrong call."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,DBac7812,12,Tue May 26 06:01:09 2015 UTC,Are you implying that Horford's flag II wasn't provoked?
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,itsbarron,11,Tue May 26 07:34:49 2015 UTC,Right? The refs admitted that they gave Delly a tech for going for Al's knees. They totally understood why Horford did what he did. Both were retaliation.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,DBac7812,-4,Tue May 26 08:19:29 2015 UTC,They gave delly a tech for standing over horford after the play. They don't give techs for reckless basketball plays or fouls. They give flagrants

AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Steffnov,-4,Tue May 26 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"Mm, no, I wasn't. Mostly commenting on why Howard probably didn't really deserve to get ejected for what he did (although penalized for sure).  I understand why Horford reacted the way he did considering how Dellavedova rolled over Korver's ankle. That being said, I've looked over the replays a couple times and it does look like Dellavedova just took an unfortunate spill in Horford's direction (that time anyways). Horford's post-game quotes just seem to be misattributing a lot of malice to what looks to me to be just unfortunate positioning. In that sense, I suppose how I feel is Horford's reaction wasn't unprovoked, but it was probably unjustified."

AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,youonlylive2wice,2,Tue May 26 08:44:49 2015 UTC,The entire point of this thread is how the ref's judgement is clearly flawed/biased/whatever and in the exact same thread people are pointing to the ref's judgement as proof that Dellavedova made a 'dirty' play. Do you see how ridiculously hypocritical this is?  Hey look at the refs making awful calls that are inconsistent and unfair. But they also called a T on Delly so that's the one call they got exactly right...come on.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,nerdyintentions,1 point,Tue May 26 19:20:15 2015 UTC,Except the justification for the Horford II is that the two incidents (Delly rolling at his knees & Elbow) are to be looked at separately and assessed separately.  That's fine if that's the rule - that each swing is unique.  But the justification for why Howard's is only a I is that it was provoked & retaliatory... Which does not matter if the actions are to be assessed separately.    These are two very similar events and its not just that the rules are applied differently its that there is not even a consensus in how a very important section of rules is to be applied (fighting / dirty play / responses).
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Morrisaurusrex,1 point,Tue May 26 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"I understand the complaint about Howard's and Horford's flagrants being treated differently, you guys have a good case there (I still don't think Horford deserved a II fwiw). My point is that people here are complaining about the refs being unfair, but then using the refs to justify their belief that Dellavedova was actively trying to injure Horford. Basically what is being said is ""I don't agree with the refs, except when I agree with them"", and it happens that you guys disagree when it doesn't favor your team and agree when it does."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,nerdyintentions,1 point,Tue May 26 21:12:55 2015 UTC,"See, I saw it as more of evidence from a non-biased and present party that Dellavedova's actions weren't pure happenstance.  I don't think anyone is arguing that Horford didn't deserve a flagrant...  Not an ""agreement when convenient"" but more of Case A & Case B.  An example of ""it was retaliatory, even in the refs eyes...""  Personally, if they decide that associated incidents are going to be judged individually that would be fine.  If they decide that they want to rule exactly by the letter of the law, state that before and stick to it.  I hate that idea, that zero tolerance behavior, but its at least consistent.  But instead what we got from 2 separate crews was (1) saying I am required to follow the letter exactly regardless of context and the others saying context matters.  Which is basically reffing out of 2 completely different books."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,itsbarron,1 point,Tue May 26 21:27:56 2015 UTC,"Delly is the perfect guy to play that role on the Cavs.  Sneaky, crafty, unassuming asswipe but more importantly they don't need him on the court to win and he's always going after players that are more important to the opposing team so that even if he does have to sit over one of this incidents, he's likely taking down a much bigger peice of the other team with him.  It pisses me off just thinking about it."
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,ThePun_,3,Tue May 26 14:48:35 2015 UTC,So... he's the Cav's Littlefinger.
AtlantaHawks,37a5ob,Aborkle,0,Tue May 26 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? You guys have seriously lost your minds over this. Cavs don't need him on the court to win, when he's started the last two games? Who else is going to play PG with Kyrie hurt, Joe Harris? This devious plot you think you've cracked is nothing more than a figment of a bitter, frustrated imagination and I hope some of you guys realize how absurd you're acting when this is over."

This isn't /r/cavs or even /r/nba and homerism and a little salt should be expected.

No matter how much you hate a player, when they step off the court they are human beings with families. This is their livelihood. Injuries suck, I'm sorry about Korver. I'd be willing to bet all my money it was an accident (I promise if you had watched Delly play for more than 3 games you'd realize he just plays hard, not dirty). Nonetheless it sucks and I wish we all could have gone through this playoff series without injuries. Also I apologize for any downvotes from the cavs sub. We are just worried about Delly's future. He's a great guy and great teammate and we don't want him to get labeled as a dirty player because that is hard to shake."
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,dmintz,54,Tue May 26 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest. This year r/Cavs more than doubled in subscribers.  The majority of these people aren't Cleveland fans, they're the legion of band wagoners who will go everywhere and troll everyone for not liking whatever team of the week they think is the best.  If Atlanta was up 3-0 I'm sure there would be a huge influx of unflaired ""hawks"" fans being assholes to people on the Cavs sub.  One way or another the series will be over by the 2nd at the latest, we can deal with this till then."

However if a Cavs fan thinks anything they disagree with is someone being an asshole (and many of them do) then no, they shouldn't be down voted. I think the cavs fans do believe people are being ass holes when they say Delly was dirty. That doesn't mean they should police our sub and down vote what they don't agree with. I'm not about to go over to /r/cavaliers  and pull that shit. I'll save it for r/nba."

I mean how many of them are browsing the oppositions sub instead of talking to each other about the series? Really odd but doesn't leave a good taste in the mouth about Cavs fans though most are LeBron fans I'm sure. None the less
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,cwolfe,26,Tue May 26 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. I think it's good to see Cleveland Cavs fans, or any other team's fans for that matter, on here. This is an area where those other teams can see more Hawk-centric content if they so choose to.   There's a reason why we do joint-game threads during the playoffs. There's a reason why we have team flair for all of the NBA teams.  While I do agree that the trolls are getting bothersome, the level-headed Cavs fans have done a great job in rational talking points."
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,jbtrackxc,3,Mon May 25 20:34:31 2015 UTC,Joint threads should be posted in /r/nba so this crap doesn't happen.

I felt the shit that was being said was pretty egregious and obviously biased, so I gave my opinion. A lot of people seem to agree with me.  Edit for the downvoters: can you honestly say that Delly looked dirty after watching the replay from every possible angle, as well as the screenshots? Is Horford not pulling him down?"

They explained it post-game:  https://twitter.com/Rachel__Nichols/status/602695490988318720  The refs watched the replay over and over - they agreed with most Hawks' fan analysis. I understand you don't agree with it, but realize that the Hawks' position is the same as the refs' about what Della did. Those defending it or claiming it didn't happen are (edit) fooling themselves.  The fact that Dellavedova lunged at Horford's leg isn't really an interesting discussion any more. It happened. The real question is, how does Horford get ejected when Howard doesn't following a much more egregious play?"

You all seemed reasonable at first but I'm watching all of these no comment phantom down votes and I think it is classless. Down vote it on r/nba but to come in here and police our comments is bull shit behavior and telling about a fan base. I'm in a Hawks sub and I fully expect to get down voted by a bunch of Cavs fans because they don't think I should talk to fellow Hawks fans in a manner they don't agree with.   Want both sides of the story? Cool. But be civil and keep your down votes for a shared environment or your sub.

I obviously do not follow any other team nearly as closely as I do with the Cavs, where I try to watch every single game (and attend as able) barring work or major social event. I follow the NBA closely enough to have a general feel for a team but the knowledgeable fans on every team specific sub give me far more insight on what to watch for or fear for and the like.  E: I also do this for the other series that don't involve the Cavs since if I am watching the games I might as well try to get a better understanding of both teams that you can only get from watching them regularly throughout the year. Plenty of smart fans here and on every other team sub who know the game as well as their team better than I would get by reading a writeup on NBA.com or other site."

AtlantaHawks,378lu0,rps215,2,Tue May 26 03:33:42 2015 UTC,probably right. Does make /r/AtlantaHawks a less attractive place for me to hang with other Hawks fans for the playoffs. Even the fucking game threads are full of this shit. Why would you not be in your own thread for the game?
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,cwolfe,2,Tue May 26 02:07:44 2015 UTC,"Idk why they do it. I'm a mod with the mavs sub and honestly at times I didn't even want to go there cause I knew rockets fans would just annoy me and everyone else. It's not fun. Tbh though playoff basketball brings out the worst in fans for some stupid reason, but I guess trolls gonna troll. Our game threads were poisoned by rockets fans."
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,rps215,2,Tue May 26 02:34:12 2015 UTC,Playoff basketball brings out the worst in places other than Reddit as well. Took my kids to the game the other night and people were so determined to have a good time we ended up being next to one fight and getting drinks thrown on us. No problems ever before even when sitting next to opposing fans. We have had good times in fact. Playoffs just brings out the idiot in people.   What is your take on making a sub like yours or ours private?
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,cwolfe,2,Tue May 26 06:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I went to the 2011 finals and even mavs fans were pricks to me.. One dude stole a shirt the other tried fighting a 55+ year old man next to me. I was right in the middle. And then this year vs Houston saw tons of fights next to me.. So weird.  I wouldn't make it private. Sign of weakness tbh. But banning gets the shit posters out of the way. If it gets so severe though, you could have only approved submitters posting so there's no troll posts"
AtlantaHawks,378lu0,rps215,2,Tue May 26 14:46:47 2015 UTC,What a waste of a finals experience. That's a real shame. It looked to me like as the ticket price/hype level increased so did the asshole ratio.

You were invited over in one thread not to take over the board, you can not seriously claim 'sportsmanship' while writing 'after this week, you won't be having this problem again until next year... maybe.'

AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Incrediblemoment,1 point,Tue May 26 15:36:11 2015 UTC,fag have fun winning 25 games next year.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Vxmonarkxv,0,Mon Jun 15 23:52:54 2015 UTC,"You did get swept and key word ""In the finals""."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,SaucyMustard,-1,Tue May 26 17:22:23 2015 UTC,He definitely was not a Cavs fan in 2007.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Excitedpenguin,-1,Thu May 28 04:23:41 2015 UTC,Bulls fan here.  Fuck this guy. I remember he had Taj Gibson in a leg lock in our series but didn't get called for anything.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,sami055,7,Tue May 26 21:26:32 2015 UTC,At the time but received a tech for it post game. Which is reasonable it wasnt that bad a foul. Much like a hold in a screen or a box out. Hardly call it dirty
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Aborkle,3,Mon May 25 19:36:27 2015 UTC,They also didn't call Taj hitting him on the screen and Taj shoving him down while he was trying to box him out. I don't think Gibson should've been ejected because it looked way worse in real time but in slo-mo you can see he was trying to get his leg loose; but you can just act like Gibson didn't do shit and was innocent.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Gods_Vagina,0,Tue May 26 02:52:32 2015 UTC,I know when I try to get my leg out of something I kick it and then hover over it...
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,BellamysManson,5,Tue May 26 18:39:51 2015 UTC,I wonder if anyone else remembers that...

AtlantaHawks,3784bz,mexicanpetal,3,Mon May 25 22:23:26 2015 UTC,Because you are a bunch of idiots
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,TimmTuesday,1 point,Mon May 25 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha! Good one! Just kidding, it wasn't. Calling someone an idiot because they support a different team than you is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. Other than that we're all just regular human beings that live our lives just like everyone else. If you met me in real life, and this is probably the case for a lot on here, you probably wouldn't call me an idiot."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,mexicanpetal,4,Tue May 26 17:24:46 2015 UTC,Lol I don't think you guys are idiots because you're hawks fans. It's because of the big fuss you guys are making about this
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Excitedpenguin,2,Tue May 26 19:54:11 2015 UTC,"Listen I know we're making a big deal of it, but think about it, Horford got ejected. Whether or not he deserved it is a different matter, he's our best player, so naturally we're gonna get pissed. Imagine one of our random bench players went and got Lebron ejected somehow, whether or not he deserved it, you'd still be pissed."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,mexicanpetal,3,Tue May 26 20:10:18 2015 UTC,Cause you are idiots if your using a still from a video as hard evidence when you can watch the clip and see his hand brushes Als leg and is gone. dosent hold.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Excitedpenguin,2,Tue May 26 20:12:32 2015 UTC,You say that like he hasn't gotten two men wrongfully ejected or anything.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,mexicanpetal,4,Tue May 26 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"Correct mate. And if you think that ejection was wrongful or in anyway dellys fault and not the players who reacted, then that just furthers my point of you being an idiot."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Excitedpenguin,2,Tue May 26 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe it wasn't directly his fault, but he usually does act like a cunt whilst playing, so I can understand Horford's annoyance which led to his elbow."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,mexicanpetal,1 point,Tue May 26 03:02:03 2015 UTC,His a grown man. He should have some sort of self control and not act like a thug.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Excitedpenguin,2,Tue May 26 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but in the heat of the moment you just react and Al reacted, it happens with literally every player, what doesn't happen with every player is being a huge cunt."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,mexicanpetal,3,Tue May 26 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"Hardly see how Delly is being a ""cunt"". But Al is just frustrated but a cool guy, when his the one who elbow dropped delly. But i mean if thats your stance with nothing to back it up other then you just think his a cunt, then we're clearly not going to get anywhere. Yeah players get frustrated and some take out their frustration when they shouldnt like JR. Doesnt make them a bad person, i love JR, i get it. But the ejection was deserved and delly did nothing wrong."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,Excitedpenguin,2,Tue May 26 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"How is he a cunt? Let's look at the Chicago Taj Gibson ejection for example, leg locks him for no reason, Gibson reacts and then gets ejected."
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,DRlZZY,2,Tue May 26 03:40:16 2015 UTC,"Hardly makes him a cunt. Its the same as holding in a screen or on a box out. Was no chance to hurt him. And i'd argue Taj was the bigger cunt leading upto that incident. Taj  Also if were talking cunt plays, what about this one by Jeff teague? Is he a cunt?"
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,NHeim11,0,Tue May 26 03:48:23 2015 UTC,lmao @ that first comment.
AtlantaHawks,3784bz,ksunole,-2,Tue May 26 03:51:16 2015 UTC,did the same shit to gibson and got him ejected.. this dude sucks
AtlantaHawks,37798f,bearg0d,18,Mon May 25 13:29:54 2015 UTC,I was so fucking proud of the way the Hawks played last night. Such an amazing year! I love this team!
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Atownbomber,9,Mon May 25 15:15:28 2015 UTC,Agreed man. We went from an 8 seed to a one seed without any trades or major FA acquisitions and made it further then ever before and our guys played hard while missing two all stars and a key bench player against the best player in the league.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Drak_is_Right,4,Mon May 25 15:19:37 2015 UTC,granted the best player in the league was missing two all-stars and borderline top-10 players.  Frankly I'd take Irving or Love over any of the Hawks starting 5 if building a team.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,DBac7812,3,Mon May 25 17:26:41 2015 UTC,True. But it helps when you lose those two and have the best player in the world left (and TT who's probably moved ahead of Demarre in the 'he's gonna get paid' contest). Whereas we lose Korver and replace him with Bazemore (who's actually played surprisingly well offensively) and Horford with Moose. Not blaming injuries though. It's been pretty evident since game 1 who the better team was.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Mon May 25 17:32:09 2015 UTC,He's still Lebron James. He's made the finals before in Cleveland without any all stars.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,mar10wright,0,Mon May 25 17:55:19 2015 UTC,I think the Cavs were basically paid to take J.R. Smith....one of the trades of the year right now it looks like.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Johnnyk421,30,Mon May 25 18:02:28 2015 UTC,I will be happy to see Steph  Curry shoot Lebron's eyes out.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,PoetJustice,9,Mon May 25 13:55:13 2015 UTC,"Unless Della rolls curry first, maybe the nba would actually kick him out then. Maybe."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,__xaq,0,Mon May 25 15:47:24 2015 UTC,Draymond would probably kick his soul out of his body if he rolled curry
AtlantaHawks,37798f,williammc,13,Mon May 25 21:00:43 2015 UTC,It's a little like that infield fly call in the wild card play off against the cardinals a few years back. Everyone lost it and I was in this weird place of being proud that Atlanta sports fans actually cared and embarrassed for how we were acting.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,AlexSPerry,15,Mon May 25 13:54:05 2015 UTC,Also similar in that it was total bullshit.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,williammc,6,Mon May 25 14:47:24 2015 UTC,Elbowing someone in the fucking head and getting ejected for it is not bullshit.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,AlexSPerry,13,Mon May 25 14:57:21 2015 UTC,So that's why JR smith was ejected?  Oh wait no he wasn't.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,eGRaFFiTi,16,Mon May 25 15:01:38 2015 UTC,Then that means the JR Smith call was bullshit and they got it wrong.  The Horford call wasn't bullshit. Plus the dude admitted to doing it on purpose in the interview after the game.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Wookie_Goldberg,6,Mon May 25 15:31:22 2015 UTC,Same reason why Teague wasn't ejected. https://vine.co/v/eA9LhvIiWqj
AtlantaHawks,37798f,humma__kavula,2,Mon May 25 16:43:28 2015 UTC,You seriously trying to compare those?
AtlantaHawks,37798f,GAVOL1,3,Mon May 25 16:23:48 2015 UTC,Yeh I'm still salty about that one.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,alphastryk,3,Mon May 25 15:36:35 2015 UTC,Fuck Sam Holbrook. Still salty over that call.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Johnnyk421,1 point,Mon May 25 16:14:35 2015 UTC,Now why did you have to bring that up again? I'm still mad about that
AtlantaHawks,37798f,go3dprintyourself,-1,Tue May 26 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"This is nothing compared to throwing stuff on the field. All the commentators agreed the call was BS, no one should be ashamed of what fans said or that they were upset."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,goamateur,29,Mon May 25 15:45:49 2015 UTC,I feel like people on both sides are cooling down after sleeping it off. Cheers man.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,DeanBlandino,6,Mon May 25 13:44:29 2015 UTC,I think we should just forget the past 3 games and watch/support the team.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,PLZ_PM_YOUR_TITS_,5,Mon May 25 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"I think the Hawks fell victim to what people thought they would- lacking a big star and playoff experience. That said, it was a great season, and next year I expect the Hawks to compete much better. I think the 3 ball will drop better when the players have more experience with playoff experience, and having seflosha back will help as well. One FA acquisition and this team could be getting to the playoffs with the ability to beat a healthy cavs team."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,PLZ_PM_YOUR_TITS_,6,Mon May 25 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm still on the neither did anything wrong wagon. Flagrant one. I don't think Al was dropping the peoples hammer, and don't think Delly was hoping for the legs. Just an awkward fall all around."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,williammc,19,Mon May 25 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"I was with you until Horford basically admitted to it. I'm sure it was spur of the moment but absolutely justified call and if it was any Cavs player doing the same thing to Dennis or Teague we would want his head. I'm glad everybody is so ride or die for this team after years of not caring and apathy but one of our players messed up and we should own up to it rather than becoming ""those guys""."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,hashish16,5,Mon May 25 14:26:00 2015 UTC,He admitted?  I missed that. I honestly thought it was all just hard basket ball from both players.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,noelsusman,11,Mon May 25 14:54:42 2015 UTC,Yeah he did.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Wookie_Goldberg,4,Mon May 25 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"Della 100% pushed into the legs though.  He was called for a technical for it, which makes no sense.  Bullshit call all around."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cphil5,9,Mon May 25 15:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'll keep reiterating this. He is landing on Carroll's back when it looks like he is pushing off from that angle. Watch the base line angle, you can see Carroll curling up underneath him to protect himself and Dellavadova sliding off his back so he doesn't put all his weight on him."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Wookie_Goldberg,1 point,Mon May 25 15:23:45 2015 UTC,https://streamable.com/y46n  We're obviously biased here but to me it clearly looks like he unnecessarily jumps into Horford's legs as he was falling.  The refs thought the same and gave him a technical for it.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cphil5,15,Mon May 25 15:47:47 2015 UTC,I see Horford pulling him and him tripping over Carrol.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,hashish16,2,Mon May 25 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"And people here aren't going to agree with you. Sorry man. People see different things. And the refs kind of validated the Hawks viewpoint by giving Delly a tech for it. Sure, Horford went full retard with the elbow and deservedly got a Flagant 2. You defending Delly on this sub isn't going to change anyone's opinion about how they see his actions."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,TrocarSlushWeasel,11,Mon May 25 16:30:09 2015 UTC,"You can understand my frustration about the conversation being about Delly being dirty, when Horford drops an elbow on him. Reggie didn't help yesterday."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Wookie_Goldberg,3,Mon May 25 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you are wrong to defend your guy. I was just trying to explain that the Hawks fan saw what they saw. And Reggie saw what he saw. Neither side is gonna change the other side's view because people see certain aspects of the play differently. And with the refs giving out a Tech and a Flagrant 2 on the play, both sides have something they can cling to in order to validate their opinions on the matter."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,TrocarSlushWeasel,1 point,Mon May 25 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"Look at that last replay from the base line vantage. When you say he is pushing off with his legs, he actually on top of Carroll's back.   Come on is it that hard to understand when you land on someone you push off to redirect the force. Otherwise he would have sat on his head and shoulder area."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,Wookie_Goldberg,-7,Tue May 26 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"Cavs fans can't have it both ways.  If you're gonna complain about Olynck, you can't exonerate Della....whatever.  You can see he just rode Horford all the way.  He jumps over Carroll so he can get into Horford's legs.  Horford was dumb for succumbing to his trolling, you gotta just take a number and get him later."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,CraftyMuthafucka,9,Mon May 25 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"They aren't comparable. Delly didn't ""ride him"". Horford committed an over the back foul and pulls him down by the shoulder. Then Delly trips over Carrol. Horford instigated the entire thing. Here's a video from an angry fan. I don't agree with his tone or vitriol, but you can see the play happen.  edit: you might wanna watch this video on mute, actually.  https://youtu.be/kGAcFqJZs18"
AtlantaHawks,37798f,TweetsInCommentsBot,-4,Mon May 25 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"Whatever.  You and that guy see it how you wanna see it.  If Olynck really could yank out somebody's shoulder on command, Matt Barnes would already be doing that nightly."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,williammc,5,Mon May 25 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"If Olynck really could yank out somebody's shoulder on command, Matt Barnes would already be doing that nightly.   Yea it's a complicated process"

AtlantaHawks,37798f,sartreofthesuburbs,-2,Mon May 25 17:12:31 2015 UTC,Then after that he leans into Horford.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,CarlosVela,12,Mon May 25 15:28:06 2015 UTC,No he doesn't. He really does not at all. You must be looking at a different clip.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,CarlosVela,9,Mon May 25 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"Or pulled down by Horford, same difference."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,GhostdadUC,-4,Mon May 25 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"He wasn't falling. He extended his legs to drive into Horford. Horford reacted poorly, but the guy was trying to injure him just like he injured Korver."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,HighBitual2-2,-24,Mon May 25 17:02:26 2015 UTC,Horford was trying to hurt Delly. But you can't deny that Delly is a dirty player.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,GhostdadUC,17,Mon May 25 14:04:52 2015 UTC,After watching the replays I don't think he did anything to deserve an elbow drop. Horford is my favorite player in the NBA but he fucked up and in turn hurt the team. I just don't think we can complain about Delly when the leader of our team is doing the rocks finisher moves during the most important series in our franchise history.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,bernie16wb,-1,Mon May 25 14:08:36 2015 UTC,Watch the replay again and please tell me you don't see Delly going for Horford's knees.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,noelsusman,16,Mon May 25 14:18:27 2015 UTC,Watch the baseline replay.  Horford is holding onto Delly's arm and dragging him down.  EDIT: Video link
AtlantaHawks,37798f,GhostdadUC,4,Mon May 25 14:56:56 2015 UTC,LOL to that replay and the guy talking in it!
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cwolfe,0,Mon May 25 15:23:53 2015 UTC,The best part of that video was the guy not knowing what an armbar looks like.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,GhostdadUC,7,Mon May 25 16:09:43 2015 UTC,Granted his vocabulary is off it still shows his arm being held.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cwolfe,3,Mon May 25 16:11:45 2015 UTC,I know it's just amusing to me as someone who once took jujitsu classes.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cwolfe,3,Mon May 25 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Seen a lot of ""arm bar"" and stuff thrown around. Last series the ""leg lock"" got me. It's not that they aren't accurate descriptions that people understand, it's that in MMA or BJJ they have pretty specific meanings which almost none of the NBA examples come close to fitting."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,CarlosVela,-2,Mon May 25 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"Here's three views including the baseline replay: https://streamable.com/y46n  You can't just gloss over the ""and Delly just goes down"" part like there's nothing there.  He clearly jumps into Horford's legs.  Al was fouling him and the elbow was stupid, but I think there's something there.  The refs agreed and gave him a technical for it."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,CarlosVela,6,Mon May 25 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"Delly is still being held when he ""jumps"".  If he doesn't try his best to stay with Horford he could possibly dislocate his elbow/shoulder just like what happened to Kevin Love.  Have the refs actually come out and said what the technical was for yet?  I honestly don't know."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cwolfe,-2,Mon May 25 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt Al has him locked up. It could have been a foul on Al. The fact is Delly directs his fall to Al's knee as he directed his dive to Korver's leg. Just like withTaj, Delly gets a foul and retaliates in a dirty way. Taj was ejected just like Al but Taj was never endangered. I am surprised Al's knee wasn't damaged. Being fouled by Al is no excuse just like there is no excuse for Al retaliating. The difference is Delly was never going to get hurt by Al but Al, like Korver, could have suffered serious injury due to the nature of the retaliation.  Tempers flare but professionals don't go for the legs and someone needs to have a talk with Delly."
AtlantaHawks,37798f,oofficial,4,Mon May 25 16:33:58 2015 UTC,Discussing this with you would be pointless since you believe that Delly targeted Korvers legs.
AtlantaHawks,37798f,cwolfe,1 point,Mon May 25 16:52:37 2015 UTC,Just a reminder that we had a discussion about Delly getting away with the leg lock agains Taj. You're defense was that they reviewed the play. In this case they reviewed the play and gave Delly a technical for intentionally making contact with the leg. I suppose this is different? A solid defense when Taj is ejected and Delly receives no foul but irrelevant when Delly is found to have intentionally made contact with Al's knee. Delly is a good player and his goodness is only hurt by this nonsense. You know the leg lock. You hopefully have seen the picture of him grabbing and ankle while on the ground in the last game. He's called for the intentional contact on Al. Many think (you not one of them of course) that he fell intentionally on Korver leg. Clearly this is a part of his game.   I don't think Al was right. It was stupid and cost his team the game. But Delly did what he did. Did it to Korver. Grabbed an ankle of a player running down the court and thought better of it. Leg locked Taj. The guy has a pattern and it's a shame. The better team is winning this series IMO and Delly hasn't cost us any games but his behavior is dangerous and I sure hope he hasn't cost Korver too much of next season.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,KickedInTheDonuts,57,Mon May 25 01:39:37 2015 UTC,Horford admitting he threw the elbow on purpose in that interview really doesnt help his case with the NBA for game 4.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,JesusCock,24,Mon May 25 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"""I made a mistake and i'm sorry"" sounds a lot better than ""he's got a pattern of playing physical"" to me."

The refs agreed with what the Hawks fans said about what Dellavedova did.  The only thing that's in dispute is whether Horford's response merited a flagrant 2."

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,mmmk7603,12,Mon May 25 05:40:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about that play and the comments on this sub:     People are acting like it has to be one or the other.  I think Horford made a boneheaded play, and I think Dellevedova did too.  Just because one happened doesn't mean that the other didn't.   All the Hawks fans will say it's dirty, all the Cavs fans say it's not, but know this:  the referees gave him a tech, so THEY think it's dirty.  So whether you like it or not, that means he should be careful come next game, else he might be ejected going into future games. To hell with whoever made this pic.  If I had the game footage and photoshop skills, I could make anyone on that court look like the dirtiest player of all time.  There's always lots of jostling going on."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,humancartograph,3,Mon May 25 17:57:09 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I don't think a lot of Hawks fans are excusing Horford. We all agree that it was a stupid play.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,DICKVERSACE,4,Mon May 25 14:13:43 2015 UTC,So you're saying its fake? c'mon.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,humancartograph,4,Mon May 25 14:21:05 2015 UTC,"Not saying it's fake at all.  I'm saying it's just strategically chosen moments, whereas I'm positive I could find moments where any player A is grabbing player B.  That happens all the time.  I was just saying if I had the game footage and knowledge of how to photoshop red circles on the picture, I could show you a million dirty plays each game, any game."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,DICKVERSACE,3,Mon May 25 15:26:34 2015 UTC,"Right, but I mean there's footage to go along with it."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,humancartograph,4,Mon May 25 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, but here's where I get off this train.  We can sit here and argue whether it was dirty or not.  I feel it was, you feel it wasn't, that's fine.  The problem with all of this is intent, and no one arguing these plays can tell whether he intended to undercut Al's legs or just ended up there.  It looked to me like he looked down, saw DeMarre, and went for it, thinking he'd get a loose ball foul, but I'm sure you'd disagree.  So that's what I mean when I say intent is key, and we'll never know that.    Also why I always regret commenting on these things."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,DeanBlandino,5,Mon May 25 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think horford yanked delly over- not as a dirty play. There was a body on the ground that delly stumbled around, and what horford thought was a dirty launch into his leg was just delly trying to keep up with his arm. Due to delly already gaining- imo a somewhat undeserved- reputation, horford freaked out on him. Everything made sense, and it wasn't anybody being evil. It was just a scrappy game. Nobody had a beautiful game, even lebron scrapped his way to a great stat line. But everyone played hard. I'm glad horford didn't connect with his elbow, or he wouldn't play in the next game, and I'm also glad he didn't get injured. Idk thats my hot take lol"
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,thecameraman8078,4,Mon May 25 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"Watch the replay bro. The only thing ""photoshopped"" in that screenshot is the red circle."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,humancartograph,3,Mon May 25 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"I'll just copy my other response:    Not saying it's fake at all.  I'm saying it's just strategically chosen moments, whereas I'm positive I could find moments where any player A is grabbing player B.  That happens all the time.  I was just saying if I had the game footage and knowledge of how to photoshop red circles on the picture, I could show you a million dirty plays each game, any game."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,thecameraman8078,2,Mon May 25 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying, I misunderstood what you meant. But this is the kind of play that got Kevin Love sidelined for the next 6 months back in game 4 round 1. When that happened, it seemed like the majority of the media has been saying ""It's unfortunate but it happens all the time, blablabla."" But this play last night everyone is calling Delly dirty. It doesn't make sense to me."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,humancartograph,4,Mon May 25 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Well,  not to diminish the impact, but it's true, and the key here is that it's up to the refs to police these things.  I actually argued that after the Love arm-pull that the refs should be policing these loose ball situations tighter to prevent situations like that and now this.    The reason I didn't like the play from Delly is that (as I said in another post) it looked to me like he looked down, saw DeMarre, and went for it, thinking he'd get a loose ball foul, but I'm sure you'd disagree. So what is key is the intent that anyone has when making plays, and we'll never know that.  My bigger point is that since the refs gave him the technical foul, clearly THEY think it was a ""dirty"" play (or a non-basketball play, as they would call it), and so he had better be careful what he does from here on out, whether he means to or not.  You can bet they'll be watching intently.  It will be interesting to see if the league officials office comes out with a comment about it.  I doubt they will (other than whether to say if Al is suspended or not), but it would be great it they did."

I've watched this kid go from undrafted raw prospect to a key reason we are up 3-0 in the ECF in the span of two seasons by doing everything you could want out of a player. He hustles every play, dives for every loose ball, rebounds as if he's 5 inches taller, and he hits shots that a lot of ""stars"" would fail to hit under pressure. You guys have your little shit talking party, but if you take off your bias sunglasses, you'll see that Korver was a freak accident and Horford was just clearly in the wrong (which he admitted after the game, I give him kudos for that) - the ONLY thing Delly has done is leg-lock Gibson, and that's after Gibson shoved him to the floor from behind.   I thought people rooted for the little guy who got bullied and fought back... but I guess you don't see it that way!"

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,coldsholder1,12,Mon May 25 08:52:44 2015 UTC,"He locked Taj his leg. Petty? Yes. But not trying to injure him at all. Korver: He dove for the ball, yes it was a bit reckless but the alternative was to give the hawks a fast break. I do not believe it was his intention to hurt him. Horford: that one is one horford. Dallavedova got dragged, he tripped and he fell. Nothing he can do there."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,Zaitsev38,5,Mon May 25 12:21:49 2015 UTC,"Idk about trying to INJURE but he's trying to draw the ire of players so they overreact. It works, it has been effective, and if the refs don't call him on it then it's within the rules. But it's what D12 would call a bitch ass move."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,mtmv2,10,Mon May 25 12:34:09 2015 UTC,https://vine.co/v/eA9LhvIiWqj   Isn't this a bitch-ass move?
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,Zaitsev38,1 point,Mon May 25 13:27:48 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with searching for the line and I don't think he has crossed it. What do you mean with a bitch ass move?
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,mtmv2,3,Mon May 25 13:38:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think he has crossed it either, but the guys on Inside the NBA made a good point when talking about the NBA brotherhood and when you're the type of player that disturbs that or displays behavior that most players don't like, especially when you haven't established yourself as a respected player. You're bound to get ""touched up."" Al's decision was dumb but there is something there with Delly's play style. Its not all just a huge coincidence."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,DeanBlandino,2,Mon May 25 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"He is an annoying player on the field for the opposing team (the al incident), he doesn't take being thrown around (the taj incident) and gives it his al on every play (the korver incident). If you want to give him flak I think you can only do it for diving at the ball and injuring Korver. I don't think he did it intetionally but it was a bit reckless. The other two were either fouls on both side or something he has no control over. So yes i do think it was mostly an accident that dellavedova injured an player and an other got ejected while being tangled up with him."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,Zaitsev38,5,Mon May 25 14:00:56 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to brand his being on the ground and wrapping his legs around Taj Gibson's leg as ""not taking being pushed around"" or something he has no control over then you are delusional."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,bernie16wb,2,Mon May 25 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"That play was stupid, but I don't think that brands him a dirty player. He was never the dirtiest player on the floor, and isn't the dirtiest player on his own team. JR is more dirty for sure."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,mtmv2,2,Mon May 25 14:30:23 2015 UTC,No he had no control over the incident with Horford. And yes i brand the fact that he leg locked Taj ''not taking being pushed around''. He got pushed to the ground and retaliated with a leg lock. Incredibly petty as I said before but we should not overreact and act like he almost ripped his leg of.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,eleven21,2,Mon May 25 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"The Taj thing was stupid and deserving of a foul but not dangerous at all. That's not something that's ever going to injure someone, just piss them off (rightfully so). It's was a dickhead move in response to a dickhead move (getting elbowed to the floor). Not smart or nice but not really dirty."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,mtmv2,2,Mon May 25 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"Once again if you look at what I originally said, not injuring people on purpose, designed to draw ire of players, effective, petty move."

Obviously Taj and Al should know not to retaliate, but it's hard to remember that when you feel someone is trying to hurt you, which I think it's clear that's how they feel.

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,faint-smile,6,Mon May 25 14:49:36 2015 UTC,Horford dragged him onto Carroll you dumb fucks
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LaGoku,13,Mon May 25 04:47:55 2015 UTC,Maybe if hawks players showed half the hustle as delly they wouldn't get their knees cut because they'd be down on the floor getting loose balls like delly.

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,GratefulDesean,6,Mon May 25 03:31:11 2015 UTC,He didn't do anything wrong on the Horford play. I still don't like him because he flops and has an annoying face
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,whythehellknot,4,Mon May 25 12:45:23 2015 UTC,"At least your reasoning for disliking him is actually rational/somewhat true (with the face thing being a bit subjective, I guess lol)."

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,buddha_abusa,22,Mon May 25 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, dude. He pulled something similar with Taj Gibson in their series with us."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LaGoku,8,Mon May 25 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"He got shoved to the ground by Taj first and then did the leg lock as retaliation. I don't think Taj should've gotten ejected, but Delly didn't do anything that bad."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LegendaryLuigi,19,Mon May 25 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he seems to instigate these situations and the refs turn a blind eye. Its infuriating to watch as a basketball fan"

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,cosmo_bear,1 point,Mon May 25 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. Both Delly and Dunleavy act questionably and it can lead to injuries which is not good and it should be addressed. Kenny makes a very good point, when you're constantly involved in these types of plays you're not exactly blameless."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LegendaryLuigi,0,Mon May 25 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"Refs T'd him up, so that's good."

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,kmhokies35,18,Mon May 25 02:59:00 2015 UTC,I like you guys. But I want you tell me with all honesty that Horford did not cock his elbow up and bring it down on Delly. I would have been okay with a flagrant 1 but what Horford did was unacceptable. He got pulled down into Al's leg he did not fall into it.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LegendaryLuigi,3,Mon May 25 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"Horford absolutely cocked his elbow with then intention of coming down on Delly. He looks like he realized mid motion how stupid this was and pulled it, but too late.  This is extremely uncharacteristic of Al, and I do believe he thought in the moment that Delly tried to fall/jump on the side of his knee. I don't know what Delly's intentions were, but his actions are reckless at best.  He's a turd."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,iCandid,5,Mon May 25 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"The cock back was viscous, but he held back bringing it down. I think he realized half way through what he was doing and half way tried to stop."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,Kolaris8472,6,Mon May 25 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that. I do think he made a conscious decision to avoid hitting Delly square in the head at least. But when you cock back your elbow like that and make contact around neck level or higher, it's pretty damning."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,iCandid,-15,Mon May 25 05:02:57 2015 UTC,Dellavedova is intentionally hurting players and it's not even a question anymore now.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LegendaryLuigi,8,Mon May 25 05:09:57 2015 UTC,Dude do you think he is a fucking ninja? No way in hell you can dive for a ball and come up with it in the pace of an NBA game while perfectly timing a move to fuck up a guys ankle whose movements are completely unpredictable to you at game speed. What you are saying isn't even physically possible.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,LegendaryLuigi,4,Mon May 25 02:05:35 2015 UTC,Right...like that accusation assumes Delly would give up on a play to go try and take out someone's legs by literally sitting on the ground. Absurd.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,taeiou,19,Mon May 25 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"Comeon dude it was an accident with Korver, Does he play recklessly? yes, but he is not going for players ankles"
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,cl-_-cl,-7,Mon May 25 06:57:02 2015 UTC,Delly and Korver was the only even questionable Delly play in this entire series. If you seriously think Delly was trying to roll onto Horford's legs and injure him on that play you are delusional plain and simple.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,cosmo_bear,-4,Mon May 25 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"people are saying things like he was a rugby player, what does that have to do with anything. he shouldn't play that way in the nba. those aren't basketball moves."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,NoobuchadnezaR,10,Mon May 25 02:09:26 2015 UTC,It's not a basketball move to dive for a loose ball on the ground?
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,bumbleb333,0,Mon May 25 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"He doesn't just go for the ball, he goes past the ball to keep Korver from getting it. Inevitably hits his leg.   It's not intentionally causing injury, but if your style of play keeps hurting people it needs to change."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,2uneek,11,Mon May 25 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Well yeah he has momentum from diving, that doesn't make it reckless.  One injury=/=keeps hurting people."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,DemonicDimples,5,Mon May 25 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Cocking your elbow up and purposely making contact above the shoulders is okay though. Take a look at the comments on the video of the play on r/nba and you'll see most people said Horford was clearly in the wrong. And that's coming from a sub, that collectively, is usually pretty biased against the Cavs (and don't even try to tell me that's not true)."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,10aciousTed,1 point,Mon May 25 02:41:31 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about that drop by Horf. I agree that it was unnecessary. I'm talking about the fact that he leans into his knees and jumps to them after they already untangled. That is intentional and not even the first time this series he has done the same.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,sean7706,5,Mon May 25 02:25:08 2015 UTC,"What I see is Delly getting pulled down by Horford and tripping over Demarre as well. Obviously we are gonna see different things with our respective biases. I know it's ill-advised to come into your opponents sub and comment on something like this, but I promise I wasn't trying to start shit (besides with that downvoted guy making the comment about Delly and FTs). You guys have genuinely been the most reasonable fans of the teams we've faced in the playoffs and I wanted to know what proof you could give me that that was intentionally dirty by Delly. You guys think he was pushing off the ground and into Horford's legs. I disagree. But you gave me a justification at least and that's what I was looking for."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,lacyinyourfacey,15,Mon May 25 02:32:09 2015 UTC,"Said this in the other thread.  Let's not go too far. Dellevedova was going for the ball, but the way he falls is dangerous to the other players. It's understandable that Horford wanted to get out from under him. Flagrant 2 was bullshit."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,Wood80,65,Mon May 25 02:45:48 2015 UTC,He dropped an elbow? That's a flagrant 2 even if you miss
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,hashish16,3,Mon May 25 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"I'll say what I said in the game thread. He cocked his elbow back with evil intent, but he didn't really throw it hard. Almost like he realized how stupid he was being and tried to pull back."
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,Orgcore,4,Mon May 25 01:57:30 2015 UTC,The way he falls? You mean the way he was pulled down?
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,awall02208,7,Mon May 25 05:00:42 2015 UTC,The way he falls is dangerous? This is just fking ridiculous. Horford grabbed his arm and made him fall. That's like me punching you in the face and then blaming you for bruising my knuckles

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,TwoTenths,11,Mon May 25 14:09:32 2015 UTC,Injuries happen and they really suck but blaming Dellavedova as if he were dirty is just a scapegoat for your frustration. I'm sorry this happened to you guys but there's no way the guys is out there looking to take people down. I do agree it could have been a Flagrant 1 though.

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,swedishpenis,1 point,Mon May 25 14:50:46 2015 UTC,Comparing Korver to Dellavadova is highly laughable. Korver is one of the nicest guys in the league compared to a guy who seems to think the nba's equivalent of a chop block is ok.

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,swedishpenis,3,Sun May 31 10:13:02 2015 UTC,Perkins is way dirtier. When he came into that Celtics game it took him all of 7 seconds to throw Crowder to the ground by his neck in something that did even remotely resemble a basketball play.
AtlantaHawks,375iu9,mehjbmeh,4,Mon May 25 02:01:48 2015 UTC,"We can't look at LBJ cross-eyed without getting tagged, but they can attack our players with the intent of injury? OK.   I'm not normally prone to outbursts of bad sportsmanship, but we need to dogpile that dick at the end of the game."

AtlantaHawks,375iu9,kyridiculous,1 point,Mon May 25 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"Un-biased opinion on what occurred because until that play I could care less who won. Now I want the Hawks to win because Dellavedova is intentionally aiming for knees. Horford did cock his elbow in a quick attempt to do some damage so a technical foul is the appropriate response.  As for Dellavedova, he needs to be fined and maybe suspended for his obvious dirty plays."
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,dailyduds,9,Mon May 25 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"Just another quick note, if it had to come down to spending our money on DeMarre or Millsap, I think DeMarre would be the smarter option"
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,Intercepting,7,Mon May 25 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"If we can get Gasol, I'd let Milsap walk and move Horford back to power forward. That would solve our rebounding problem."
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,KickedInTheDonuts,3,Mon May 25 19:34:23 2015 UTC,As much as I want this it's pretty unrealistic.
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,LAXlittleant26,2,Mon May 25 23:46:01 2015 UTC,Pick and Pop with Gasol and Horford!
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,cwolfe,2,Tue May 26 00:12:10 2015 UTC,I think the pending increase in cap room with the 16/17 contract might lead Paul to sign a one year extension. Everyone who signs now is going to want to price in that increase or protect themselves from being undervalued relative to the market in one season.  I'm not sure he is a max player though. I dunno. He's fantastic but I have this illusion of max players stepping up and dominating games not quarters during the playoffs and I've only seen Al do that this year. I realize that vision of a max player is evolving and the bar is getting lowered but I dunno.
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,chessbrah,2,Tue May 26 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Millsap is going to be the 4th or 5th most sought after UNRESRTICTED FA. Teams are going to offer his a max or close to it. The contract will be a discount in a couple of years as the salary cap goes up. As far as Paul's mentality goes, this is the most prosperity he's had in the league, I'd think he'd want to stay on this team as long as he's paid fairly."
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,Crcsoccer1,3,Mon May 25 21:37:09 2015 UTC,I say we should just let milsap walk and sign Aldridge and demarre. Aldridge is a great shooter and would be great in this system.
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,bearg0d,1 point,Mon May 25 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"If we could somehow get Gasol from Memphis I think we would be championship contenders. I like LMA but I think he and Al have an overlap of skills and do t know how well they would work together. That being said I'm putting a lot of faith in Walter""Edy"" Tavares developing well here."
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,Buc07,2,Mon May 25 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"""For your Atlanta Hawks, Edy Tavares, weighing in a 265 pounds and standing seven foot THREEEEEEEEE!!!!!"" But in all seriousness, both of these guys are going to be getting offers from many many teams, offering a lot of money. With our lack of superstars now, I feel as if we can only get better. I think keeping DeMarre and fitting a (potentially) new power forward in to the system are our main priorities. I just want to stay away from guys like Josh Smith and Greg Monroe. I would't mind Jeff Green at a steal, but I'm not sure how well he'll fit in to the 4 slot, if at all. The more I think about it, paying Millsap might be the best option if we can't get LMA or Gasol and possibly play Horford at the 4"
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,Crcsoccer1,1 point,Mon May 25 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm not so sure if Bud could turn Aldridge into a 3pt shooter as well as he made Millsap one, but the added size in the front court would help us so much on our dreaded offensive rebounding. Kevin Love has the perfect skill set for us IMO, but I feel as if he would be a terrible team player and wouldn't fit in our system. I agree with you, Aldridge would fit the team basketball system well."
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,Shade_Raven,4,Mon May 25 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Have you seen Aldridge shoot. I mean, the dude's game consists of mid range jumpers and fade aways. In the All Star game the dude was just fucking draining threes. He can definitely tweak his game to play in our system.  That said he probably won't sign in ATL"
AtlantaHawks,378d1g,KickedInTheDonuts,1 point,Mon May 25 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yep one of the reasons we are down 3-0 is that our rebounding has been awful.

AtlantaHawks,3766re,DZ84,11,Mon May 25 05:26:33 2015 UTC,/r/nba is the most reactionary knee-jerk board on Reddit. If LeBron plays well he is better than MJ (LOL). If he plays bad he is a literal potato.

AtlantaHawks,3766re,mehjbmeh,6,Mon May 25 17:32:37 2015 UTC,Amen. I would have given anything for Teague to hit that shot just to shut up /r/nba and ESPN who guaranteed it was going to be a sweep. Hawks get more hate on that subreddit than any other team

AtlantaHawks,3766re,Mlkeyz,-6,Mon May 25 05:50:04 2015 UTC,"Your getting hate on /r/nba now because a vocal part of your subreddit complained about the referees in games 1 and 2, said how delly pushed himself into Krovers legs in game 2, and the only thing I saw while reading the game thread as the game was going was how Hawks fans said the Delly was going after Hordfords legs, this is what gets your fanbase shit.  Theres nothing being hated on about your team, both players or coaches, its the apparent whiny fan base."

AtlantaHawks,3766re,CarlosVela,8,Mon May 25 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"If Love is healthy, it's an easier cavs team for us to face. This means less playing time for Tristan Thompson, who's been a fiend for offensive rebounds. Kyrie being healthy makes it more difficult, but you make it sound like next year's cavs could sweep this year's cavs like it's nothing."
AtlantaHawks,3766re,Orgcore,-8,Mon May 25 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"yep, if love and Irving are healthy the cavs are the best team in the NBA and the hawks will have no chance  Just watch what lebron is doing alone.  just add a healthy Irving an unstoppable scorer with a deadly off the dribble 3 pointer shot, unguardable 1v1, he had 2 50+pt games this year. watch those games and you will know how special he is, he is a machine just add him to Lebron and they will annihilate you"
AtlantaHawks,3766re,ManBearPigTroll,5,Mon May 25 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"I think we match up better with the cavs of Love is in, so I'm standing by that opinion. If a 100% Kyrie is in then yall are definitely better, but it's a little unfair to take his best games and take LeBrons best games and assume they're both possible at the same time with no regard for a possible change in chemistry. I think a completely healthy Hawks and a completely healthy Cavs isn't a ""no chance"" situation like you think, but hopefully we'll be able to find out next May.  In the regular season when the big 3 were healthy we won the series, so I don't know how much credibility your speculation has. Luckily, this speculation doesn't even matter because yall will likely make it to the finals."

No Kyrie, no KLove, and LeBron misses his first 10 shots and you're team couldn't do anything with those circumstances, you didn't play well enough to win. You deserve very little credit. You earned home court advantage, that's enough credit. The playoffs is when the season really starts, and your team is about to be swept. Losing sucks, but you guys have spiraled out of control from the respectable fan base you were when the series started. Now this sub is filled with so much salt. It's easy to be good sport when you win. Your true character comes out when you lose.   You guys, Horford and company are all a bunch of hypocrites.

Cleveland sports fans have endured a lot of heartbreak on the field/court/etc. and we hardly ever can attract top name free agents to give us better hope going forward.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,atomsej,4,Mon May 25 03:37:48 2015 UTC,"True that. Good effort. I must say though that I'm pissed as hell that we let Teague shoot a three and the end of regulation, we had 10+ seconds, run the damn pick and roll."

AtlantaHawks,375vni,mcjcheerios,1 point,Mon May 25 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"For real... a Teague three is the best play we could draw up? I love coach bud but come on man, get something going to the basket."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,atlantajordan,4,Mon May 25 06:02:45 2015 UTC,He really let you guys down.  That play is the play that should have happened the possession before.  Teague would have had a chance to ice the game and if he didn't and shot it at the buzzer if we would have gotten the rebound we would only have 3 seconds left to win the game.  The play in overtime was much more terrible than the regulation one. The fact that he put Pero and Mack in the game despite so many better shooters being on the bench during that play was terrible.  Why he played Mike Scott that many minutes I will never understand.  He looked very not deserving of the coach of the year award.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,lackingcredibility9,2,Mon May 25 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"Lol who exactly was he supposed to play? Look at our roster and tell me. Horford got ejected, Antic was inbounding because he's tall and a good passer, and given that Korver was out p much the best 3 point shooters we have save for like John Jenkins were in the game."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,mtmv2,1 point,Mon May 25 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"Well I researched your teams shooting a few days ago so I have an idea of about everybody's 3p% and who your best and worst shooters are.  Mack and Pero are both terrible 3 point shooters at close to 30% each and Mack took your last 2 shots.  Mike Scott is a respectable 35% shooter but was 0/5 for the game and playing terrible.   You had Schroeder (35%), Bazemore (37%), Muscala (40% on small sample but good in playoffs too and already hit a big shot), and DeMarre (40%) on the bench.  Plenty of choices.  I would have gone Teague, Bazemore, Demarre, Millsap, Muscala.  I would not put Antic and Mack out there.  edit: forgot to put who was out there.  You had Millsap, Antic, Scott, Mack, Teague.  Not having Demarre out there is so bad that I have to assume he was hurt.  Even other than Demarre you had choices better than Mack."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Mon May 25 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"I wanted DeMarre out there but yeah I also figured he wasn't 100% and he's been pretty cold shooting since the injury anyway. At that point in the game though Mack was 3-5 from 3 pt range, so you figure if he's having a decent shooting night it's not a ridiculous thing to have him out there. Schröder was ice cold and really he doesn't yet have NBA range on his shot. Baze actually has been making some big shots for us this series so I would have been cool with him taking it. Antic is definitely a better shooter than Moose but you really don't want either of them taking that shot.   In any case all of that could have been avoided if Jeff had just driven to the basket at the end of regulation. He'd had a lot of success just stepping back and driving full sprint all throughout the 4th."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,mtmv2,1 point,Mon May 25 14:49:38 2015 UTC,I don't agree with any of that.  Demarre has only taken two 3 point shots since the injury so I don't think you can say he is ice cold. He is the only hawk starter who has shot better during the post season (42%) than he has during the season (40%).  Schroeder at a respectable 35% is a better 3 point shooter than Teague (34%) so I don't know what you mean saying he doesn't have NBA range.  Antic is a terrible shooter (30%) from 3 while Muscala is 10% better at 40%.  How is Pero the better shooter? He shot the worst percentage on your team. And again Bazemore is 36-37%
AtlantaHawks,375vni,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Mon May 25 14:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just going off watching them the whole playoffs. Dennis these playoffs has been shooting 24% from 3, and he typically misses badly. He didn't play much because this whole series he's been taking the bait on shooting Js instead of driving, and it's been hurting the team. Meanwhile Jeff dropped 30 last night and hit a big 3 in the fourth. DeMarre has taken six, not two, three point shots since the injury, and has made two of them. He's had a fantastic playoffs but just hasn't looked like he did in the Wiz and Nets series. Mike Muscala has attempted a career 25 shots from downtown. He's 2-7 from 3 this entire playoffs. Antic has probably had a 4 game span where he shot 25 threes. Not fair to compare those."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,mtmv2,2,Mon May 25 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"I am aware of Dennis in these playoffs and I didn't suggest he be put in the game at all or over Teague.  I suggested Bazemore over Mack, Carroll over Mike Scott, and anybody (even Schroeder) over Pero.  Are you really calling 2/6 ice cold?  That is 33% which is better than Pero Antictfor the season.   1 more make and he would be at 50%.  I put the disclaimer that Muscala had a small sample.  But Pero Antic is barely better than Josh Smith.  Also this idea that you go with the guys who have been hot the past handful of games instead of the guys who have peformed all seasons is not how a team should operate for the most part.  It's terrible to see a 60 win team not trusting their guys and constantly changing rotations after almost every loss."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Mon May 25 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah we've been doing that too much and really at the end of the day it's because our roster isn't good enough, plain and simple. The DeMarre thing though, I wouldn't be surprised if he specifically told Bud to put someone else in the game because he didn't feel comfortable or ready to go. He's done that in these playoffs before his knee sprain even.  Edit: though I must say we have been giving Antic heavy minutes all year and he's been  our guy all year, so to suggest we should do that, then suggest Moose over him is contradictory. I do think Baze should have been in though."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,mtmv2,64,Mon May 25 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"60 games, ECF's, fought back without our 2 best players and our best wing defender. we had to overcome the NYPD, the refs, the NBA, Paul Pierce, everyone. let's just enjoy it. we'll be better next year."

AtlantaHawks,375vni,watsyurface,12,Mon May 25 03:44:42 2015 UTC,"We played well tonight overall, so I'm way better with the loss than I have been with any other we've had this post season.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,DBac7812,5,Mon May 25 04:32:06 2015 UTC,I had the lowest expectations of all (2nd round playoffs) and i'm so amazed we made it to the ECF. The East will still be a dumpster fire next season with the low draft order the Knicks got. We'll be back. We'll get a good player in FA/Draft and we'll be back.  Until then it's time we turned our attention to the NYPD for what they did to Thabo.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,AnonymousInAtl,4,Mon May 25 04:01:38 2015 UTC,Don't forget the Danny Ferry situation and the recent change in ownership.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,dirtyjoo,6,Mon May 25 13:20:15 2015 UTC,So proud of this team for forcing overtime. Full strength cavs vs full strength hawks would have been hawks in 5. I'm excited for next year.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,NSFW_MANNING_ONLY,11,Mon May 25 03:48:17 2015 UTC,What? You know we've been w/o Kyrie AND Love this whole series?
AtlantaHawks,375vni,BMC4,-5,Mon May 25 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"Love being out is actually turning out to be a positive for y'all since he's smaller and doesn't get as many rebounds as Thompson. And Kyrie is extremely close to Teague in skill level, with Teague having far better defense and Kyrie taking a slight advantage on the other side of the ball. It would be a much closer series because even if our injured players aren't as talented as y'all's, they have much more overall positive impact to our respective team."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,DRlZZY,3,Mon May 25 06:52:04 2015 UTC,"Kyrie is way better than Teague on offense and is not that bad defensively. Love is still a 17/10 guy, that is a harmful loss.   You guys are missing Thabo and Korver, IMO that's not even close"
AtlantaHawks,375vni,BMC4,2,Mon May 25 07:01:24 2015 UTC,Not as big of a difference as having Kyrie and Love
AtlantaHawks,375vni,BMC4,0,Mon May 25 13:50:28 2015 UTC,You are delusional if you really think the injuries on both teams benefits the Cavs.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,TehGray,35,Mon May 25 15:09:36 2015 UTC,hawks in 7
AtlantaHawks,375vni,msl_atl,24,Mon May 25 19:26:06 2015 UTC,The NBA is rigged...to make our underdog story as dramatic as possible
AtlantaHawks,375vni,PoetJustice,3,Mon May 25 03:47:39 2015 UTC,"I wish.  Right now it's rigged for Lebron vs Curry.  If we can't pull off the greatest upset of the current era, then I hope that the Warriors spank Lebron's ass so hard."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,Hedgey,2,Mon May 25 03:55:48 2015 UTC,Current era? You mean history?
AtlantaHawks,375vni,dailyduds,8,Mon May 25 15:00:58 2015 UTC,I absolutely love the positivity...
AtlantaHawks,375vni,tomtomtumnus,35,Mon May 25 18:38:07 2015 UTC,Why didn't Scott just grab the fucking ball?!? God fucking dammit!!!!
AtlantaHawks,375vni,GBralta,17,Mon May 25 03:51:08 2015 UTC,This was the breaking point in the game don't know why it's not being mentioned more that was one of the dumbest plays I've ever seen just grab the fucking ball.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,machmezie0731,4,Mon May 25 03:40:44 2015 UTC,Truth. That or us going for a Teague three to end regulation instead of him driving or giving the ball to Paul.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,atlantajordan,8,Mon May 25 03:55:17 2015 UTC,I don't even care we lost (okay that's a lie) but I loved the effort our hawks showed tonight
AtlantaHawks,375vni,biqboy,16,Mon May 25 05:53:09 2015 UTC,"I told myself im expecting a sweep, but  I foolishly let the hawks deceive me in thinking we could win. And I will think that again next game. Why do I do this to myself"
AtlantaHawks,375vni,duhpolan,-1,Mon May 25 03:39:01 2015 UTC,I want one win just to being it back to atl for the chance dellavadova gets lost and finds himself in a dark alley......

AtlantaHawks,375vni,Got_Engineers,3,Mon May 25 04:13:34 2015 UTC,"That fool does not represent all Hawks fans. I feel bad for Delly, copping a lot of flak for playing the game the way I respect. Giving it his all every possession."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,Reoh,3,Mon May 25 04:43:44 2015 UTC,I mean we felt the same way about Kelly O. Shit's tense this time of year.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,justcamp,3,Mon May 25 03:39:04 2015 UTC,We could drink each other's tears while we're at it.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,duhpolan,2,Mon May 25 03:41:43 2015 UTC,Just line us up in front of an AA gun North Korea style
AtlantaHawks,375vni,rimmyrim,3,Mon May 25 03:43:21 2015 UTC,It really does sound like Best Korea at the moment.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,justcamp,4,Mon May 25 03:43:59 2015 UTC,My laptop that I was watching the game on took one for the team...

AtlantaHawks,375vni,_durren_,12,Mon May 25 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"With the way we played tonight, I think this series will be coming back to Atlanta. Especially if Horford is not suspended. This team has a lot of fight left in it."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,uckTheSaints,7,Mon May 25 03:40:55 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they will suspend him for 1 game just to finish us off.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,ichinii,2,Mon May 25 03:43:08 2015 UTC,It would only make sense now. Ugh!
AtlantaHawks,375vni,Ironychef,18,Mon May 25 03:45:31 2015 UTC,"the Paul Pierce bank shot is nothing compared to this. I've never been on an emotional roller coaster like that in my life. The Horford ejection, potential Teague game winner, to the ending. Genuinely sick. WHY CANT ATLANTA HAVE A GOOD MOMENT FOR ONCE"
AtlantaHawks,375vni,blessedmitch,7,Mon May 25 03:49:52 2015 UTC,I would say The Putback was a good moment.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,Orgcore,31,Mon May 25 03:39:48 2015 UTC,"Very proud of them but so many what-ifs. If Horford doesn't get a bullshit ejection, Hawks win this game. They go into game 4 with a Korver-Hero-Ball-less offense that's rocking and rolling and a defense that has learned how to contain LeBron isos.  Winning 4 straight would be the greatest justice porn of all time."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,rimmyrim,12,Mon May 25 04:22:31 2015 UTC,I would sacrifice both my testicles for 4 straight wins just to watch Cleveland not make it to the finals

AtlantaHawks,375vni,Got_Engineers,7,Mon May 25 03:42:56 2015 UTC,learned how to contain Lebron isos? he scored 37 points....
AtlantaHawks,375vni,Papasmurf345,19,Mon May 25 05:53:43 2015 UTC,On 37 shots. I think that's a shooting percentage that we'll take.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,atlantajordan,0,Mon May 25 03:41:01 2015 UTC,Damn right. We could/should have won this game regardless of his 37 points.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,Orgcore,6,Mon May 25 03:42:52 2015 UTC,"Dude he shot the ball 37 times. He couldn't drive and kick the entire 4th quarter because we kept Shump, JR, and Delly covered. LeBron does not make that final drive to the hoop 100% of the time. They are so beatable."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,eavc,4,Mon May 25 05:54:56 2015 UTC,He shot 37 times.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,mexicanpetal,9,Mon May 25 03:44:57 2015 UTC,I'm already at peace with this. What a ride it was. Mack was great. MVTeague sighting at the end. Renegade hawks are best Hawks. I still believe we take it back to the A. GO HAWKS

JR and shump have been big. Meanwhile the hawks bench has mostly been just barely serviceable and fuck my life"
AtlantaHawks,375vni,america_eff_yeah,3,Mon May 25 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"We kept it interesting. My team fought for 53min. tonight. I don't like the result, but after game 2 and watching Houston's last game, I appreciate the effort. Good Game and I'll see yall Tuesday."

In the postgame interview he kept talking about how he ""has countless injuries"" and how ""his team needed his leadership."" He's so goddamn full of himself. But he wants his bullshit storyline where he's hobbling and he collapses on the court after the game because he's ""playing on emotion."" It was a phenomenal game but shit, dude probably jerks off to his mirror. /rant"
AtlantaHawks,375vni,panthers_fan_420,4,Mon May 25 04:29:31 2015 UTC,I've always felt that way about him but that's the best way I've seen it worded.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,uckTheSaints,8,Mon May 25 04:20:49 2015 UTC,Kyrie is out because he's actually hurt tho
AtlantaHawks,375vni,cavesofparadise,0,Mon May 25 04:31:08 2015 UTC,And the assumption is that lebron isn't hurt? Have you ever actually experienced a cramp? (not to mention all the other pains a guy like that must feel playing 40 PLUS minutes nightly)

AtlantaHawks,375vni,SpottyRasang,3,Mon May 25 05:49:17 2015 UTC,I thought the post game speech gave off fake vibes but I wouldn't judge his collapse as representative of anything extra as he was understandably tired

AtlantaHawks,375vni,Spuwk,-4,Mon May 25 11:41:26 2015 UTC,I just wish he could show a shred of humility instead of telling us how much adversity he had to overcome to get the victory
AtlantaHawks,375vni,BillClintonSaxMaster,0,Mon May 25 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"It was certainly a great game, but he's had so many better performances than this. Also nowhere near the Jordan flu game, which is clearly what he wants for himself."

That said, we knew this series was over before they found a way to give us hope again. I just want to give all my man love to the JYD. Is there a player with a bigger heart? Dudes a warrior. I want to give my appreciation to this team for captivating my much jaded atlanta sporting soul. I know we're better than this, and I hope we can see the same core with a slightly upgraded bench next year. All we can do is get game 4 and bring them home for a send off.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,williammc,2,Mon May 25 06:03:14 2015 UTC,"Our offense looked a lot better than it did the first 2 games of this series, and I think it's because we didn't have Korver out there so the team finally said to themselves we need to move the ball more. Hopefully we at least avoid the sweep and Horf gets that flagrant 2 reduced to a 1 so he can play"
AtlantaHawks,375vni,stdfan,2,Mon May 25 03:51:32 2015 UTC,It's because you finally made some shots and Teague was so aggressive.
AtlantaHawks,375vni,rooneygirl420,2,Mon May 25 03:43:06 2015 UTC,Cut Mike Scott. Dennis fucking shoot jumpers so you can actually be a threat on offense. Teague learn to drive. Paul GROW SOME BALLS.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,2uneek,2,Mon May 25 08:23:36 2015 UTC,Well Schroder does need to learn to shoot everything else he's being dramatic with.

I bet if LeBron was in the same situation as Horford and did the same thing, he wouldn't have been ejected. I'm so sick of the LeBron circle jerk. I thought I was watching a basketball game, but nope. It was the LeBron show. If/when Cleveland makes it to the finals, I hope Golden State destroys them."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,JesusCock,5,Mon May 25 04:09:08 2015 UTC,LeBron would have never done that.  I am shocked Horford did that.  He should have kept his cool and let Pero clothesline him or something.

AtlantaHawks,375vni,carbonNanoNoob,2,Mon May 25 03:49:40 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: cavs fan. You guys should have won this. The delly situation was total shit. No way was that flagrant 2 on Horford. If he is  suspended, I lose all faith in the refs. JR had a good couple seconds to think about slugging Jae Crowder in the face. Horford almost fell into it after Delly jumped into him. Delly needs to remember he's not playing rugby anymore.   He better hope the cavs keep him for the rest of his career, because like Horford said, it's a brotherhood, and if you're putting others careers on the line because you're the backup point guard compensating by being a cannonball, a lot of people aren't going to like that. Should be 2-1, Horford is a saint."

AtlantaHawks,375vni,DICKVERSACE,0,Mon May 25 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but if I could mind meld the pain I have felt from season after season of the Browns (from Couch to Manziel) and Indians (since '95), you wouldn't say that. T_T But for real, the Cavs have took hits from Boston, from Love to JR to Kyrie. I don't want to see what's going to happen if Atlanta snaps and just says 'Fuck it'."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,-Runaway,-1,Mon May 25 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"I don't either. If he sees a live ball on floor, you're damn right Delly will dive for it. The only ""dirty"" thing he has done was that leg lock to Taj. Everything else is clean."
AtlantaHawks,375vni,DICKVERSACE,1 point,Mon May 25 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, besides Gibson, nothing he has done is dirty. And I don't think he's a dirty player. But he has the potential to affect players' careers doing this, and if he fosters a reckless reputation, I'm worried it may affect him negatively among his peers. I mean, Teague has always seemed smug to me, but Horford is a saint. He straight up threw a bow at Delly. Dudes are taking this personally. None of what he's done is illegal or dirty, and I don't know he can stop, because he's not doing it on purpose. Not some Kendrick 'Brick Shithouse' Perkins, moving screen play. Absolutely hustle defender, Delly will do shit lebron and kyrie wouldn't dare risk, and do it legally. But if he took a clothesline from the hawk equivalent of Perk or JR, I wouldn't be shocked."

AtlantaHawks,375vni,MartinATL,1 point,Mon May 25 03:52:35 2015 UTC,The fact that he was tugged doesn't effect whether it was malicious. He fell to the knee on Al and legs on Korver intentionally. Could have called a foul on Al for tying him up but that doesn't let him off the hook at all. Any more than the foul by Taj excuses the leg lock. Intentional and habitual by Delly. They showed another shot of him grabbing and then releasing an ankle later in tonight's game. Just reveals how his brain works. Some guys just work this way and he is one of them. Maybe he isn't out to hurt people but he does this on purpose. I understand you may not be willing to admit it now but when he gets traded and the reel of 25 incidents like that show up on YouTube you won't argue with it any more. I have less of a problem with JR who is just a dumb ass who loses his mind than I do with Delly because he could have broken Al's leg and it is looking like surgery for Korver. JR will hit you in the face and nuts like any self respecting dirty player. Delly is going to end someone's career. I loved Anthony Mason and Charles Oakley when I lived in NYC. They just weren't going to let you get a lay up. They hit you in the head shoulders not in the legs. That's fucked up and career ending stuff.   Maybe you could look at the replays and see how he controlled his fall with Al and lunged towards Korvers legs. I accept Al pulled him.

Then the refs - after extensive review of the tape - acknowledge they gave Della a technical for going after Horford's knee.  Crickets..."
AtlantaHawks,3762yi,llawinga,7,Mon May 25 17:10:05 2015 UTC,Everything I will say here is fact. Please point out where you think Delly is being malicious in this play. https://streamable.com/y46n   Delly bodies up Horford to keep him from the loose ball. ( Good B-Ball play). Horford pulls Delly by the arm over Carroll and he trips and falls.   How are you blaming Delly for anything here?
AtlantaHawks,3762yi,TwoTenths,0,Mon May 25 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, Della was falling into Horford. But he doesn't just fall down. While his body is next to Horford's leg, he launches into Horford's knee.   It's pretty clear and that is exactly what the refs saw as well, which is why Della received a technical foul. Not sure why you are missing that.  EDIT: And to amplify the point...it's not me or anyone else in the sub blaming Dellavodova. It was the referees. The same ones who ejected Horford. I guess you think they saw the Horford retaliation correctly but not Dellavadova's action?  No one - including Horford - is suggesting that what Horford did was appropriate. Fortunately, neither player was injured, but both were at fault. The issue is whether Della's conduct should be viewed as a mitigating circumstance. The refs refused to look at the incidents together. But the result was ejecting an All-Star player from the second quarter of Game Three."

AtlantaHawks,376b9k,atlantajordan,9,Mon May 25 06:11:09 2015 UTC,"The defensive strategy was definitely better.  We need to go 1 on 1 iso with LeBron 24/7 all game 4.  Bud began to put more faith in Carroll and Millsap in the 4th and LeBron was taking tough hook jumpers.  When we rotated help to LeBron constantly in games 1, 2, and a little of game 3, he just kicked it to Delly/JR/Shump for an easy 3.  I swear they are hitting open 3s at like 66%.  That's 2 points per possession (3 points * .66).  50% seems like a super generous scoring rate for LeBron on his isos, but even if he scoring 50% of his isos, that's still only 1 point per possession (2 points * .5).  And I've been iterating this over the past day or two, but Korver's absence was HUGE.  We play this weird version of off-ball Hero Ball.  In typical hero ball (i.e. Harden), someone isolates and drives to get a layup or draw contact.  In Korver Hero Ball, we setup every possession to either:   get Korver an open 3 get the defense rotating onto Korver which opens up other (slightly lower 3pt%) shooters   ...but he's been blanketed by a single player all playoff-long.  Works great against regular season defenses, but Bogdanovic, Beal, and Shumpert haven't been fucking around with Korver (except Bogdanovic in game 6 where he was like ""lol too much running, I'm tired, this is dumb"").  Either way -- traditional iso Hero Ball or Korver Hero Ball -- the offense runs through 1 key figure.  Tonight was definitely more variation in sets and I think the Cavs played some very reactionary, ""uhhh well we didn't particularly plan for this so let's do our best"" defense on it."
AtlantaHawks,376b9k,Orgcore,4,Mon May 25 06:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I thought you guys had a great plan. A ton of our points came from when Bron tricked the floor into 5-teaming him again, or at least giving him a long look so someone could sneak into the paint for easy points. When the floor covered everyone, nothing was going in.  I can't remember the quote, but some coach talked about going against Kareem in high school three times for the championship. The first two times the strategy was max coverage on Kareem, and they lost both games handily. The third final when they finally won, they played one-on-one basketball and he basically said ""We'll give Kareem his points, block out the other four, and see if he can outscore our five""  Of course, there's the other example of not covering a star and having a Wilt Chamberlain 100+ pt ""hangover"" game. I doubt that will happen nowadays."
AtlantaHawks,376b9k,RobotRodriguez,4,Mon May 25 13:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well, the Cavs actually missed second-half baskets in Game 3, which helped our cause a lot."
AtlantaHawks,3766gb,Orgcore,5,Mon May 25 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"We had numbers (5 on 4), I know.  But the Cavs initially put Dellevedova on Teague with no plans to foul.  Why do we always play 24-second-shot-clock-low-percentage-field-goal isoball for the last 2 minutes of every game with a lead, and then the one situation where that might be considered an okay strategy, we move the ball and take a quick shot?  Also, sorry for the clickbaity title."
AtlantaHawks,3755tn,MitchShredder,10,Sun May 24 23:41:09 2015 UTC,Hell yeah! I want to win but if he has a solid game I will be happy. I love bazemore he has so much intensity and always so upbeat like he loves the game. So fun to watch. I hope he drops about 20.
AtlantaHawks,3755tn,Human_highlight,2,Mon May 25 00:15:47 2015 UTC,Hey nice start! Who do you think will be getting the wing backup minutes?
AtlantaHawks,3755tn,bearg0d,3,Mon May 25 00:41:15 2015 UTC,Realy the only backup wings we have are John Jenkins and Shelvin Mack even though he's more of a point guard. I guess Austin Daye counts but I doubt he gets any minutes.
AtlantaHawks,3755tn,cloudberrylive,1 point,Mon May 25 00:44:14 2015 UTC,Well he did carry that texas team to a ring.

AtlantaHawks,375gm9,C-Jammin,20,Mon May 25 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"Ken Mauer that dumb fuck, what a terrible, terrible call. Flagrant 2? So a flagrant 2 and a technical the other way, how does that even make sense?   I'm a Warriors fan but I'm rooting for the Hawks. The Hawks have been through so much, the police beating Thabo Sefolosha, Korver's ankle, Carroll's knee. Now Mauer steals Horford.   I hope you still pull out a win."

AtlantaHawks,375gm9,cwolfe,9,Mon May 25 01:36:56 2015 UTC,I will say this. After everything... I'm damn happy the Hawks have the half time lead. That's incredible given the circumstances. Korver does so much for this team. Carroll has 1 league. The refs are trying to fuck the Hawks. A lead at half is great. Let alone on the road.

Those killed us tonight (perhaps fittingly, since opponent o-rebs have killed us ALL season).  Even worse, they got HUGE 3 pointers off multiple of the offensive rebounds.  And then to make matters even more worse, Teague would respond by dribbling up to the 3 point line with 18 seconds left on the shot clock and bricking a 3.  We can talk about an ejection or fouls or whatever all we want, but if the Hawks wanted to win this game, they should have fucking pulled some boards on defense."
AtlantaHawks,375w53,Orgcore,-1,Mon May 25 04:44:07 2015 UTC,True.   Thompson was definitely a beast. I do think he got away from his 6th foul in the 4th on one of teagues drives but it is what it is.  We had two healthy starters on the court in the second half and still should have won the game. Gotta add some depth on our front line with a rim protector and the East is ours next year
AtlantaHawks,375w53,Guardian_Ainsel,6,Mon May 25 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"Thunder fan here just checking in. I don't have a dog in this fight, but did you guys think that ejection really wasn't fair?"
AtlantaHawks,375w53,schoolsterz,4,Mon May 25 05:30:52 2015 UTC,"I think most fans feel it was a flagrant 1. Didn't elbow his head.  Its the fact that the guy has developed a habit of rolling into ankles and legs. He literally just ended our starting SGs season with that type of play.   It seems like he is scrappy but if he loses position on a play he purposely falls into the guys legs.  They also gave him a T for something so that added to it. If it was a clean play on his part, why the T?   In playoff basketball, flagrant 2s should only be given in extreme circumstances....."
AtlantaHawks,375w53,flintrock70,9,Mon May 25 06:33:51 2015 UTC,"I dont understand how you can look at the tape and honestly say to yourself that there was any malicious intent by Delly on either the Korver play or the Horford play.   Korver play he dove for the ball and turned his body to protect it/pass it out. Thats textbook basketball. Unfortunately Korver got injured (trust me we know about injuries), but it was in no reality a dirty play.  Horford play he gets arm barred and dragged into Carrol, and dragged to the ground. I don't see how anyone could call this intentional/dirty. Not commenting on Horfords elbow swing.   I understand the frustration, and trust me I've been there. I've never seen my favorite teams win a championship. But to call a player dirty when he's playing clean high-effort basketball is just silly, I hope you can see that."
AtlantaHawks,375w53,Guardian_Ainsel,2,Mon May 25 07:32:36 2015 UTC,"Its not like he is saying he is going to hurt them. He is just doing things that are frowned upon.  If you head fake underneath the basket and the defender jumps, its very dirty to initiate contact and draw the shooting foul. It could very easily injure the defender if you jump into his legs.   Same goes with diving for balls and falling into ankles and knees.   Its happened 3 times now. That's the issue I have."
AtlantaHawks,375w53,mexicanpetal,1 point,Mon May 25 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"Scrappy play is one thing, it's the habitual chop blocking that will get him a broken nose or worse if he crosses a team with more hot heads and a weaker coach."

I know common sense says, without Korver you guys are fucked because it diminishes the perimeter threat and it also forces you guys to play at a slower pace than normal; however, I think Horford, Millsap & Teague are about to come up big for you guys, if any coach in the league can pull a new offensive set with this three, it's Budenholzer. I'm not entirely sure what to expect from the Hawks but I'd like to see a Memphis-like offense, with the 4 and 5 playing the mid-range & post, pull in defenders and move the ball, get some open threes (similarly to the triangle offense?)."
AtlantaHawks,373qj4,SmokingFrog,2,Sun May 24 19:35:49 2015 UTC,get some open threes   At this point the Cavs are giving Teague open threes anyway because they know they'll get a free rebound out of it

DeMarre just wasn't able to stop him. He did a pretty good job of slowing him down though, Teauge got a pretty open shot for a buzzer beater."
AtlantaHawks,379j6p,Bosefchrist92,2,Mon May 25 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"I swear, these Cavs fans are getting worse as the day goes on."

AtlantaHawks,375tjt,azuresou1,1 point,Mon May 25 03:15:55 2015 UTC,They have gotten lost as time has passed us by. I just don't know anymore.
AtlantaHawks,375tjt,AnimatedAnixa,1 point,Mon May 25 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"I mean we've run iso high pick and rolls at the ends games all season, this wasn't any different.  If you take a random game winning/tying attempt from this past season, it very likely would have looked like the same play we ran tonight.  It sucks.  I thought the ball movement was actually good today although Teague got a little zealous in the 4th.  Korver's absence was huge and not feeling pressured to force the ball to him was crucial.  Sadly, as quickly as Delly giveth (the play that put Korver out for the season and nearly got us right back in the series), he taketh away (the play that Horford emotionally lost it on) and that killed our offense for the second half.  I think game 4 would have been extremely winnable.  I still do think it's extremely winnable if Horford is back but it's going to largely depend on the boys feelings towards game 4.  I'd understand if this game just deflates them, but I hope they can show the same passionate effort they gave tonight."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,thrashfan,21,Sun May 24 14:44:34 2015 UTC,"If the Hawks can come away with a win tonight, I think there's still a chance to turn the series around. It'll be tough with the injuries, but this team has heart and there's still players that can put up serious numbers if the offense finds their rhythm. Have faith fam, it's not over yet."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Not_Frank,2,Sun May 24 15:01:29 2015 UTC,Let's freaking goooo!!

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,GBralta,8,Sun May 24 15:03:06 2015 UTC,I got to go to game 2 on Friday and even though we lost I had amazing seats right behind Sir Foster And the 6th man section. The energy they brought was amazing and if we get swept I'm glad I got to experience the eastern conference finals. I hope we can pull some magical shit and turn poop into hand grenades somehow but I'm not too optimistic.   If we win I'd be happy but if we loose I won't be too sad.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Back_Sweat,7,Sun May 24 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"48min. of effort! That's all I ask for, but that and a win would be preferred."

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BRI503,7,Mon May 25 00:59:48 2015 UTC,Fucking love the Cavs jumping up and down unable to get the rebound or get the shot in just like lebron's smug ass was screwing around doing last game. Karma.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Payton23,4,Mon May 25 01:01:16 2015 UTC,"I'm so funny, right guys?"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,goamateur,6,Mon May 25 01:03:06 2015 UTC,Alright this is where the comeback begins and our team plays the tight kind of offense that we know they are more than capable of doing! CAW CAW Hawk family
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Im_just_a_lamp,6,Sun May 24 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"It'd be tight to win the series, but worst case I'd love to send the boys off at home. They worked hard this season."

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,5,Mon May 25 00:49:50 2015 UTC,I guess this is going to be the game thread?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,GBralta,5,Mon May 25 00:52:06 2015 UTC,Al's gotta' have a big game tonight. We also need to focus on getting Thompson and LeBron in foul trouble.

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,dawgfan24348,6,Mon May 25 01:06:08 2015 UTC,Cavs are shooting around 25% and we only up by 3. We have to do something about those damned offensive rebounds.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,GBralta,6,Mon May 25 01:06:28 2015 UTC,Wow NBA just went full retard.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,fatboyslimbz,5,Mon May 25 01:39:04 2015 UTC,He is going for his legs! What bullshit! On the second time he landed on his feet he lunged into Horford! He could have fallen but he didn't. Christ! How can the nba allow this. How is that a flagrant two?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,crimedawg27,4,Mon May 25 01:39:16 2015 UTC,This is getting silly now. Maybe just eject all our players for getting in the way of Lebron's story?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BringMeTheBigKnife,4,Mon May 25 01:39:59 2015 UTC,Time to take on these bandwagon fans at the Q.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,2,Mon May 25 00:31:15 2015 UTC,why does everyone assume our fans are bandwagon fans?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,go3dprintyourself,5,Mon May 25 00:38:10 2015 UTC,"Because after LeBron left, that place was empty."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,IsawUstandingThere,2,Mon May 25 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"it really wasn't, i mean it wasn't packed but still the number of people who attend games is not indicative of the number of fans. But I was still at some games, I've had season tickets with the Indians for several years. Mostly half empty stadiums. But those fans are still die hard. It doesn't matter how packed the stadium is.  Also, the success of Cleveland sport teams really help the economy of Cleveland. People can't afford to go to as many games."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,go3dprintyourself,2,Mon May 25 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"Same reason people assume ours are, we both have a lot of band wagoners."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,bearg0d,2,Mon May 25 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah there are always bandwagon fans. Same with Kobe, Jordan, Magic. I don't think that really says anything about the actual fans. That's just part of the game. I guess we're on the same page though. I don't consider Atlanta fans bandwagon fans."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,go3dprintyourself,4,Mon May 25 00:47:56 2015 UTC,Sh3lvin
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BRI503,4,Mon May 25 01:16:05 2015 UTC,Here we go with the offensive fouls.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,5,Mon May 25 01:25:57 2015 UTC,Kinda hard to win 8 versus 5
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BringMeTheBigKnife,5,Mon May 25 01:26:48 2015 UTC,wow refs
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BRI503,3,Mon May 25 01:38:32 2015 UTC,What just happened
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,dawgfan24348,8,Mon May 25 01:40:53 2015 UTC,Fucking Della keeps falling on people's legs.  EDIT: Cavs fans get the fuck outta here downvoting. He did the shit in Chicago and did it in this series too.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,3,Mon May 25 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"I think we played really tight over the first two games and went away from our offense when Smith and Shump caught on fire in both games. If we can stick to our offense, share the ball, and make those open shots (and take less dumb shots in general), we can win this game."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Intercepting,3,Sun May 24 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Best of luck guys, I'm hoping for a cavs win obviously, but can't help respect the Hawks team and fan base! As long as it's competitive tonight and not anything like that garbage on national television yesterday"

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,fatboyslimbz,3,Mon May 25 01:33:10 2015 UTC,Elbow didn't even hit
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,goamateur,5,Mon May 25 02:01:02 2015 UTC,I spent all day yesterday brainstorming this scenario where the offensive approach changes radically due to Kyle's injury and the Cavs have a harder time stopping it.  It has given me a sense of optimism and hope about this game.  Why do I do this to myself?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Orgcore,4,Sun May 24 15:27:00 2015 UTC,JJ is going 7/8 from three tonight.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,justcamp,2,Sun May 24 17:24:06 2015 UTC,James Jones going for atleast 21 confirmed :D

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,goamateur,4,Mon May 25 01:13:59 2015 UTC,Total. Bullshit.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,PickShark,5,Mon May 25 01:39:09 2015 UTC,I give up on the NBA. On some serious shit.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,2,Mon May 25 01:39:35 2015 UTC,Predictions for final score and top scorer for tonight's game?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,jbtrackxc,9,Sun May 24 14:55:11 2015 UTC,96-91 Hawks; top scorers: Millsap with 24 and James with 32.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Not_Frank,9,Sun May 24 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"99-96 Hawks. Schroder with 27 points, meinfücker"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,daeve,2,Sun May 24 16:08:56 2015 UTC,Hawks 102 Cavs 98. Horford with 34 points. He's gotta go off for us to win.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,goamateur,2,Sun May 24 15:06:28 2015 UTC,IT'S TIME FOR THE MACK ATTACK!
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,vernalagnia,2,Sun May 24 21:00:34 2015 UTC,Still haven't played our best basketball. Group effort tonight. We get eight guys with 10+ points but not one player over 20.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,dudekay,1 point,Sun May 24 21:36:20 2015 UTC,I think Teague will get over 20. He has been pretty damn good this series
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Human_highlight,2,Mon May 25 00:18:17 2015 UTC,Win or lose at least I'll have alcohol tonight. Caw caw!
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Adampro123,2,Mon May 25 00:22:40 2015 UTC,Ball don't lie
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,fatboyslimbz,2,Mon May 25 00:50:58 2015 UTC,They still have nightmares about Mack
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,goamateur,2,Mon May 25 00:57:16 2015 UTC,How many offensive rebounds are we going to give up today?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,GBralta,2,Mon May 25 01:00:19 2015 UTC,LeBron seems to be trying to be a player coach more and more.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,cwolfe,2,Mon May 25 01:00:24 2015 UTC,0 for 9. I like I like
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,KickedInTheDonuts,1 point,Mon May 25 01:01:20 2015 UTC,yet only up by 3.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,IsawUstandingThere,2,Mon May 25 01:03:56 2015 UTC,I don't know what I expected going into that game thread.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Dmaster1014,2,Mon May 25 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"This postseason we've only been ourselves out of timeouts. The longer the game flows without stoppage, the sloppier we get."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,IsawUstandingThere,2,Mon May 25 01:11:02 2015 UTC,I feel so...apathetic watching this game :/
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Bluegodzill,1 point,Mon May 25 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"well, probably cause the hawks are not the home team"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BRI503,1 point,Mon May 25 01:17:40 2015 UTC,This does not feel like a playoff game at all. Looks more like a late season game where both teams are just trying to stay healthy for the playoffs. I'm happy that we're winning though..  edit: nvm
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,DBac7812,1 point,Mon May 25 01:19:29 2015 UTC,Apparently so do the mods - no game thread. Maybe less is more? Be the dude?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Cat_friendly,2,Mon May 25 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"The refs and BS calls is why the NBA's popularity dropped so much a few years ago. If the NBA doesn't watch, it it will again."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,fatboyslimbz,4,Mon May 25 01:28:42 2015 UTC,Just gotta find that regular season offense.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,DementedWatchmaker,2,Sun May 24 15:53:35 2015 UTC,Keep passing and driving. Cmon guys.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,2,Mon May 25 00:51:23 2015 UTC,I feel bad saying this but Korver's injury is huge for this offense. Better ball movement when you don't try to force him 3s every time down the court against NBA playoff defense. Sad it took an injury for Bud to realize that.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Orgcore,2,Mon May 25 00:55:17 2015 UTC,i agree. team looking better off the bat
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,BRI503,1 point,Mon May 25 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"Eh, I disagree that bud needs to realize this. I think the loss of korver makes is more apparent to the team that they need to get back to the principles that got them there. In order for bud to realize it he would have to had made a conscious adjustment to adjust the system, right? The system is read and react. He's not actively doing anything. I think this is a mini Kevin love effect much better d for a slight decline in productivity. The problem will be the spacing. We have to keep this pace, trust in the system, and dodging the offensive rebound bullets. We can do this! Caw caw!"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,crimedawg27,2,Mon May 25 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"They lead: ""LeBron's Christ."" We lead: ""LeBron's hurt.""  He's been hurt since CHICAGO!"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,IsawUstandingThere,1 point,Mon May 25 01:18:12 2015 UTC,it's pretty ridiculous honestly. TNT has such bad commentary sometimes. I just listen to the Cavs radio when I can it's much better lol.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,go3dprintyourself,2,Mon May 25 01:24:43 2015 UTC,Who gives a fuck what Blatt has to say....he's not even the real coach.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,2,Mon May 25 02:05:20 2015 UTC,We haven't had a fair game all series.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,1 point,Mon May 25 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"So do we see more Mack or JJ? Or both?  Also who spells Carroll during the time Bazemore is already on the court?  Edit: to be clear, I'm still optimistic. These are just questions I'm wondering about for tonight. Trust Coach Bud"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,getspolanthers,2,Sun May 24 20:32:54 2015 UTC,I think for us to win Moose and Mike Scott need to see significant playing time. Mike Scott is an electric player when he's in rhythm and we need to get him going.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,NSFW_MANNING_ONLY,2,Sun May 24 21:02:45 2015 UTC,He can't play defense though.

AtlantaHawks,373fdo,T64dw4n,3,Sun May 24 16:42:26 2015 UTC,A different plan would not be a bad thing. The plan they've been using has not been at all effective
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,cwolfe,1 point,Sun May 24 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"One game at a time. Let's shoot for the gentleman's sweep by grabbing one and make it more respectable from there. Hopefully the bench comes back to wake up the starters to ball movement, aggressive screening and making the easy buckets. And Teague, that thing you did last game... don't do that anymore. You get paid too much to suck that bad."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,cwolfe,1 point,Sun May 24 19:57:46 2015 UTC,We moved the ball WAY better in that quarter than the first 2 games.

Regardless of what happens tonight, the Cavs will still hold the home court advantage.  Really, they don't have a ton of pressure.  It's all on the Hawks."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,C-Jammin,0,Sun May 24 15:50:30 2015 UTC,Lebron has been sucking all night. Just stop double teaming him for fucks sake. Bud why are we still doing that?
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,ichinii,-5,Sun May 24 23:37:14 2015 UTC,"I have an unpopular opinion, shocker, but I actually think that losing Korver will have the Kevin Love effect for us. That is that Love is such a piss poor defender and such a major liability there that the moment Thompson came in for him while there was a drop offensively the team instantly became harder to score on, as shown by Millsap having a horrible series vs the Cavs (same can be said for Delladova being an upgrade defensively over Irving and Teagues production shitting the bed when Irving actually sat out game 1 in the 2nd half and how he struggled game 2 with Irving out the entire game)  Korver is great offensively, hes a threat, etc etc even despite how bad hes been during these playoffs (35% from 3). But he is just an awful, awful defender. Beal ran circles ran around Korver (I counted 3 times in Game 1 that Korver actually fell on the floor chasing Beal). Shumpert and JR have run circles around him. I've literally seen Korver fall on his ass trying to guard guys the last two series, hes been bad. As I told a friend of mine last night Bazemore is a SIGNIFICANT upgrade defensively over Korver. I also said to a cavs fan on another forum ""whats it matter if Korver scores 12-15 if he constantly gives up 20+ points a game because hes so bad defensively?""  I fully expect a loss today but it wont shock me if our defense looks better today than it has the last two games because korver isnt out on the court being schooled by anyone hes guarding. Also the fact that Bud hasnt made a single adjustment this entire series and we still triple LeBron when he enters the lane, and Korver is so slow to rotate and recover that LeBron generally knows to instantly pass out to Korvers side because of this fact. Bazemore is significantly faster, more athletic and quicker and I think that if Bud continues to not adjust out of this god awful schematic approach that Bazemore wont be able to get taken advantage of because hes so much more athletic than Korver. And if Bud actually does make an adjustment to us playing more one on one and less crashing down on LeBron? Absolutely see this really being a close game because neither Shump or JR can abuse Bazemore like they had to Korver  /rant"
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,RaptureVeteran,5,Mon May 25 02:16:54 2015 UTC,You're out of your damn mind.  The only way you could believe Korver is a defensive liability is if the last time you saw him play was three seasons ago.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,justcamp,0,Sun May 24 18:27:45 2015 UTC,Normally Korver has been solid on D but he has been a liability these playoffs. Beal and Shumpert have gone off on us.
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,uckTheSaints,-1,Sun May 24 20:35:43 2015 UTC,Beal scored 20+ vs him. Otto Porter put up solid numbers when korver guarded him  The only delusional person here are the silly god damn delusional homers like you and the other 5 dip shits who down voted me who don't actually grasp basketball

Anybody who disagrees with you doesnt get basketball? You're seriously the worst sometimes. Korver led the league in steals and blocks at one point in these playoffs tied only with Lebron. Don't act like he's a shitty defender. I know you're gonna have some reply coming back insulting my intelligence for disagreeing with you but I'm actually not going to bother replying this time."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,Payton23,1 point,Sun May 24 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing delusional about it. Korver deserves respect for getting us here and being a vocal leader of this team. Your premise is that Korver gives up more on defense than he provides on offense, which is untrue by any statistical measure.  You are the biggest fucking whiner here and you've even said as much with your ""perfectionist"" and ""pessimistic"" comment. Epitome of #truetoatlanta. You only pop up to bitch when the team drops a few games."
AtlantaHawks,373fdo,justcamp,9,Mon May 25 01:05:24 2015 UTC,"Because they are my team. Because they have had a great year. Because they can lose and still be worth supporting. Because the Eastern Conference Finals is a Big F*cking Deal and being one step away from the Finals in year 2 of a rebuild is an amazing accomplishment. Because I don't want to be the fan who missed year 1 and 2 of a 3 year march to the Finals. More reasons than that but the more I read comments like this the more I think the Atlanta curse is the fans, not the teams."

Perhaps most fascinating was this quote, which wasn't really about the Thabo matter:   The only concrete reason one received [for lack of Thabo coverage] was “people not being particularly interested in the Hawks compared to other teams in the playoffs.”    Nice to hear it finally being admitted. Though the circularity of the situation is mind-blowing: ESPN doesn't cover a team because of perceived lack of interest, lack of coverage creates lack of interest, and so on."
AtlantaHawks,3719g4,llawinga,13,Sun May 24 01:18:20 2015 UTC,ESPN controls the conversation on Atlanta teams and I think a big part of the lack of coverage has to do with its major media competitors being located here.
AtlantaHawks,3719g4,justcamp,2,Sun May 24 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"It's true that there isn't much interest in the Hawks outside of this city, but we have journalists in this city, and if they dug up something groundbreaking, ESPN would cover it just like they would with any other team."

Atlanta doesn't have another defender like Thabo, Cleveland has LeBron who's just as likely to drop 40 as Kyrie.  I mean for god's sake, the individual high score for a Hawks player was Milsap had 20 in one game.  When Cleveland loses a star, it has another.  We never had a star, the star was the whole team, losing any piece is equivalent to our Star being injured."
AtlantaHawks,370j7p,mehjbmeh,5,Sun May 24 00:35:14 2015 UTC,"Milsap had 30 in one game. I believe that's what you meant.  We have depth that Cleveland doesn't, but you're right that they always have someone who can drop 30+.  We've played good defense holding them in the 90s, but our biggest problem is the lack of shots being made and quality offensive looks. We're running more of an iso than Cleveland and that is not Hawks basketball."

But the memory of my team playing without any kind of effort or urgency in the ECF is still freshly minted into my brain. I don't mind us losing if any team is simply better, I have a big issue when more than half of the time it doesn't even look like we're trying.  Teague's on-court demeanor was horrible, and clearly spread like a wildfire amongst his teammates. He's overly emotional when things aren't going perfectly for him, and the team has suffered this season when he's not interested in being on the court.  Do I somehow believe we can make this competitive? Yes. But we'll have to learn how to play defense and stop spying 4 defenders on lebron all damn game."

AtlantaHawks,370i5h,uckTheSaints,0,Sat May 23 23:46:48 2015 UTC,This sucks now but in the term of this series I don't think it hurts much. Korver has been garbage these playoffs and his offense hasn't made up for the defense he's played. Him vs Shumpert on the court is a huge liability.

AtlantaHawks,36z0px,sean7706,6,Sat May 23 13:02:15 2015 UTC,Seems like Kent and I agree. I'm not giving up just yet. It's time to unleash the # RoadHawks and take 2 back.

AtlantaHawks,36z0px,GBralta,5,Sat May 23 15:04:00 2015 UTC,It's possible. But it will be hard. I'm curious how Hawks will do if they stop 5-teaming Bron and just let him have his 40 points and see if the rest of our guys can score enough to make up the rest while being properly defended.
AtlantaHawks,36z0px,RobotRodriguez,3,Sat May 23 20:29:12 2015 UTC,I believe coach Bud has a plan.
AtlantaHawks,36z0px,GBralta,4,Sat May 23 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"We've taken on the demeanor of Jeff Teague, Al Horford, Paul Millsap all year. Now is not the time for passive.  We need 5 Schroders out there. We gotta go out there and just slap the shit outta them if we want to get back in this. Horford should give Joakim a call, he probably has the right idea."
AtlantaHawks,36z0px,fireglz,2,Sat May 23 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"With our injuries before Korver got injured Atlanta is clearly the better team.  A better team that doesn't show up ready to play 48 minutes and doesn't make shots isn't going to beat a LeBron team ever though.  I watched the games twice and I honestly don't know what is going on with all your players.   Ball movement isn't the problem because we are giving up open looks to do things to stop the ball movement.  There are 3 problems. 1 is you guys haven't played at a higher defensive and hustling intensity from the regular season for the most part.  When your players have been getting open looks that aren't wide open but are good shots to take, every player except Horford, Korver, and Schroeder hesitates to take the shot or doesn't even look to shoot, especially teague.  The 3rd and biggest problem is the obvious one that you guys aren't shooting well and haven't shot well the entire playoffs.  I wonder if it's a confidence problem."

AtlantaHawks,36y82v,uckTheSaints,-9,Sat May 23 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly when it comes to cities like Atlanta and Cleveland, the road team has it easier. While at home both of these teams will be playing with the weight of the cities past failures on their shoulders, the crowd will always have an ""impending doom"" mindset. This leads to the road team having the metal edge."
AtlantaHawks,36y82v,fastlikeanascar,3,Sat May 23 04:20:30 2015 UTC,Love the optimism! Takes 4 to win a series. Not 2.
AtlantaHawks,36y82v,GhostdadUC,1 point,Sat May 23 08:59:59 2015 UTC,Is that why the Cavs only lost 2 home games in 2008-2009?
AtlantaHawks,36y82v,uckTheSaints,2,Sat May 23 17:50:22 2015 UTC,Hawks had the best home record this year check out how that went. Some teams/players prefer playing on the road. Leads to a different mindset. In their past 3 playoff series the Hawks have won 50% of their road games (5/10) and they had one of the best road records in the league.
AtlantaHawks,36y82v,GhostdadUC,-1,Sat May 23 20:53:14 2015 UTC,So because the Hawks lost 2 home games that means that the road team has it easier?  That's a pretty big leap.
AtlantaHawks,36y82v,uckTheSaints,1 point,Sat May 23 20:58:58 2015 UTC,Not because of the 2 games. Just in general. The mindset of a team playing on the road is a lot different than at home and a lot of players prefer that to the pressure of 12k home fans looking on. Tons of NBA players have said as much.
AtlantaHawks,36y82v,GhostdadUC,2,Sat May 23 21:05:50 2015 UTC,Well they aren't going to come out and say that the crowd intimidates them...

AtlantaHawks,36zq6k,haughtcrestedelmer,2,Sat May 23 14:47:00 2015 UTC,They did run one out of TO last night that got Korver an open look and he passed out of it instead of shooting. They have lost sight of those great screens and picks that got them open looks. Glimpses show up and they end up with an easy lay up or open 3 then they wander back into no pass/one pass shots and not setting screens and moving off the ball again. One of my biggest doubts about Bud is his inability to bring them back to that style during the game. They struggle to find solid plays out of time outs to get rolling again.
AtlantaHawks,36zq6k,cwolfe,1 point,Sat May 23 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"I started to worry about Bud too, but then thought, as I wrote later in the description, that this must be a part of the process! I hoped with the time off during the ECSF and ECF they could digest and analyze what has happened so far in the playoffs and that they beat the cavs quite easily during the season with like 80/20 plays/free form and even though the arguement is that they can learn plays, they still have to be able to guard them and teams that play as individuals prefer to defend against this poor free form because it is nt good enough to test them and means they can guard man on man, which these sort of teams love to do because its hero ball but on the defensive end. Solid execution of plays would mean everyone on the cavs would have to follow orders and I think this is where they re weakest. Once again, this must be a dedicated conviction to principles of development, which I hope produces even better basketball in the future, cos it sucks to watch at the moment."
AtlantaHawks,36zq6k,cwolfe,1 point,Sat May 23 18:01:08 2015 UTC,Time will tell. I hope you are right and that if we don't keep Ferry we have someone else with as good an eye for talent. I feel like we need some pieces.

AtlantaHawks,36y7gh,tabelz,2,Sat May 23 02:56:14 2015 UTC,I said the same thing. I'm also telling myself that this year was a freebie and this level of success came at least a year early. I'm excited for what we do in the off season and seeing how it works out next year. I have so much more hope for this franchise than I've had since I became a fan in '08.

AtlantaHawks,36y7gh,TetheredGoat,1 point,Sat May 23 07:48:39 2015 UTC,Caw caw. It's been a joy to follow this team this year regardless of the outcome of this series. We've gone farther and did more than anyone thought and the journey to get here was an absolute blast.
AtlantaHawks,36y7gh,Cleebot,1 point,Sat May 23 02:57:28 2015 UTC,"What I love the most is how far we've come in just two short seasons under Bud's tutelage. We are playing team ball, not settling for superstars to carry us. Obviously, injuries are completely derailing us at the moment, but we still won 60 games. We are still the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, playing in the Eastern Conference finals. If you had told me that the Hawks would win 60 games this season and finish with the #1 seed, you would have to have had an oxygen tank on stand by because i'd lose breath from laughing so hard.   However, we've done it. We've had the greatest season in Atlanta Hawks history, and we are only two years into what should be a decade or more of continuity within Bud's system. He's no Pop, but i'll be damned if we aren't close. With our great success this season, it could very well push superstars to finally start looking Atlanta's way. We are no longer just ""that team that plays in a big city."" Every facet of our organization took a step forward this season.  I don't know what everyone else's realistic expectations for this season heading into it, but I am willing to bet that NOBODY unless you are just wanting to play the  ""I had them here all along"" internet card, had them getting this far with so much success.   So I say to you, cheer for your Hawks as much as possible for the rest of the season. Hold your head up high, be proud. This season, win or lose in the ECF was a HUGE success. Although we may not see that success in a trophy case, you will see just how much getting to the ECF will help us come free agency. Be prepared for some more star power in the coming months."

AtlantaHawks,36y83k,TheHighestEagle,10,Sun May 24 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe we have to learn how to lose the ECF before we learn how to win it. An Atlanta basketball team has never made it to the  ECF before, so I look at this as a stepping stone. How many years did the bad boy pistons lose in the 1st or 2nd round before they finally won back to back chips? We have a bright future ahead. Winning 60 games is no reason to be disappointed in losing in the ECF. Coach Bud is laying out the building blocks for us to be a perennial contender for years to come. Gotta start somewhere. I would've loved to attend the parade on Peachtree street in a few months but at the same time I realize championship success is a long and tough process"
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,quieterjuice,2,Sat May 23 08:12:22 2015 UTC,We have a lot of work to do and it isn't going to happen this season. We've done a lot this season and I just hope we build on it over the summer. It is clear the team and Bud need more work to get over the hump. It is going to be tougher next year so we'd  better add some pieces and get the system down.

Last year, we were below .500 and now we're a 60 win team in the ECF. We've got tons of cap space and nowhere to go but up. That's something to be excited about IMO.

It sounds weird but you should see how angry I get watching sports. Its pathetic. Truly pathetic. Ive had a lot of people on other forums I post on ask me why I even watch sports and I'm just like....just because. It hit me after game 1 that this shit makes me miserable. I spend like 3 hours exaggerating and being a complete asshole and taking out my anger on complete randoms on the internet. I turned the TV off and I told me wife ""I need to stop watching sports for awhile if my team is involved"""
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,1 point,Sat May 23 04:35:25 2015 UTC,I've struggled mightily with this. I used to snap at my kids when my teams lost. I had to check to see if they won before I watched otherwise I'd ruin my day. Believe it or not getting a season ticket has helped because I'm committed to the team and enjoying it for the long haul not just this game/season. Don't know why it has worked but it has.
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,cwolfe,0,Sat May 23 14:29:38 2015 UTC,"I fucking know man. This shit makes me so goddamn angry. But I can't quit watching. Even if we go down 3-0 I'm gonna be convinced we'll pull some 04 Red Sox shit.  I think it's because I know that if I see an ATL team win a title it will truly be one of the happiest moments in my life. I can't give up on the possibility that it might happen, ya feel me?"
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,uckTheSaints,-1,Sat May 23 04:40:37 2015 UTC,Awwww come on man. You wouldn't root for a hobbled Cleveland team to win a title? I mean I get that people hate LeBron but still...have pity (if we beat the Hawks of course).

AtlantaHawks,36y83k,uckTheSaints,3,Sat May 23 05:28:38 2015 UTC,Done deal
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,shivstroll,10,Sat May 23 14:36:07 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? The Hawks have gotten farther than they ever have before while in ATL. They have been highly successful. I know this socks but we shouldn't get down on this amazing Hawks team. I think going out in the first round is easy more disappointing.
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,cwolfe,11,Sat May 23 03:12:15 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding me? How does a team forecast to win 40 games going to the Eastern Conference Finals become a disappointment? People taking four all stars, 60 wins, an unbeaten month, coach of the year and three rounds of playoff basketball as a loss is just beyond me. Any year we don't win the finals is a confirmation of the Atlanta curse? What a fan base."
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,0,Sat May 23 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"Because expectations change. This was a fun year, no one expected any of this stuff to happen, but once you win 60, 19 in a row, habe 4 all stars and the coach of the year you pretty much change your expectation and the team hasnt looked good in the playoffs. theyve looked like a 6 or 7 seed lucky to even advance past the nets and then they go on and will likely get swept by the cavs. its embarrassing. im not judging this team based off what i thought they would do in august im judging this shit show performance from the team and coach bud based off them being a 60 win one seed and how generally god awful the teams looking in every series. You just dont get swept by the Cavs, you dont, just just cant rationalize that if you win 60 games and clinched the one seed about a month prior to the end of the year. And because of that, this team is a disappointment to me because of how piss poor they have looked in the post season"
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,cwolfe,1 point,Sat May 23 14:49:58 2015 UTC,Problem with that logic is having a season feel more successful if they don't make it to the ECF. So how does a team succeed without winning the whole thing? They ran out of gas and ideas but for Bud's second year I think they were tremendous. My biggest concern is how hey build on what they've done without repeating the lackluster performance in the playoffs.
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,What_Mama_Dont_Know,8,Sat May 23 16:38:45 2015 UTC,What about 98 Falcons?

AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,3,Sat May 23 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"Thats the superbowl one right? We werent supposed to get into the SB in the first place, I wasnt pissed off about that loss."
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,uckTheSaints,8,Sat May 23 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"2010 Falcons were a bigger post season disappointment. At least the 2012 Falcons won a game and were  extremely competitive against the 49ers. When I look back to the 2012 season, I know we were one of the best teams around. When I look back to the 2010 season I think we were a bunch of pretenders."
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,2,Sat May 23 03:15:33 2015 UTC,Them too. I couldnt remember if it was 11 or 10 or 09 or 08 or whatever.
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,uckTheSaints,4,Sat May 23 03:20:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree here. 2010 Falcons, fine call em a disappointment. Same with the 2008 and 2011 Falcons. The 2012 Falcons were the only one of those teams to actually show up in the playoffs and play like the team they were all season. I have respect for the 2012 Falcons, they were a couple calls away from a Super Bowl. I have no respect for the  Falcons team that got beat by 20 points at home to Green Bay in the 1st round"
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,3,Sat May 23 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"my problem with 2012 Falcons is they were the only team that were right there. They held a halftime lead on the niners they were mostly dominating the niners in a very methodical, efficient manner and then the offense and defense both shit the bed. Harry Douglas with the worst drop of his career and we blow a chance to beat a super beatable ravens team in the SB"
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,dillpickles007,2,Sat May 23 03:30:42 2015 UTC,Yeah but at least they were in that game and played hard.  More than you can say for this Hawks squad...
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,3,Sat May 23 03:33:26 2015 UTC,true that
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,uckTheSaints,2,Sat May 23 03:35:36 2015 UTC,Thats the reason I cant hate on the 2012 Falcons. They gave it their all. They left everything they had on the field.  You can't say the same about the 2010 and 2011 Falcons.
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,uckTheSaints,2,Sat May 23 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. But I don't agree with you saying that they're one of the biggest postseason disappointments ever. We should have won that game, but SF was a great team. I think the 2012 Falcons postseason was fine in the grand scheme of things. We were one of the best teams around that year we just didn't get the breaks that a team needs to be champs."
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,RaptureVeteran,2,Sat May 23 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"But for me, its still an all time great disappointment, to go alone with basically every other wasted high seed Matt Ryan and the offense threw away"
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,mondrarytomic,2,Sat May 23 03:47:37 2015 UTC,Douglas didn't drop that pass. He fell down on the route but still caught the ball. Because he fell down it let the defender catch up to him.
AtlantaHawks,36y83k,cteez910,1 point,Sat May 23 09:15:56 2015 UTC,"I went to that game the day after I got my wisdom teeth out and didnt take any pain meds so I wouldnt be hazy for it.

Shitting the bed like this is going to take away all of the momentum this team built over the regular season and we'll be right back at square 1 come October.  That is the most disappointing thing about this IMO.  Its back to half-empty arenas with half of the few people in attendance wearing the opposing team's jersey.

I'm not trying to be a dick, and don't get me wrong.  I was concerned about the hawks.  especially your shooting which I highly doubt will suck this bad thru the whole series.  they will start hitting shots eventually and I hope the cavs can respond.  but I feel and have felt the cavs are the better team.  I mean we have lebron. and just like lebron said.  any lebron james team is going to be the favorite no matter who they play."

None of the shots were falling and what do we do? TAKE MORE!!! The Cavs were more than happy to let Teague and Dennis take 3s. Also our defense was non existent. Too many open 3s.

Schroder looked better than Teague and didn't get many minutes. And I can't believe Pero got any playing time at all over Muscala

AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,TheManWithNoName23,14,Sat May 23 03:19:48 2015 UTC,It's a 2 hour chase sequence with a few breathers sprinkled in. It's one of the freshest action movies I've seen in the past 10 years. Go see that shit!
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,deanremix,4,Sat May 23 03:24:04 2015 UTC,Awesome. I'll check it out.  Thanks for the recommendation.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,powerthirst,6,Sat May 23 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"Best way I can describe it is if a bunch of middle schoolers came up with crazy ideas for an action movie, but pulled them all off.  It's completely absurd but awesome"

AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,HOLY_HUMP3R,39,Sat May 23 03:09:35 2015 UTC,Not being patronizing. I seriously feel bad that you guys are getting bit by the injury bug. Didn't come here and rub anything in your face. I came here to give my best wishes to those guys. Don't be like that man.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,Orgcore,-25,Sat May 23 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take much empathy to realize that we don't know want to hear anything from Cavs fans right now, regardless of how polite they may be. Just posting in its own right is unnecessary right now. This fucking hurts for it to end in a thoroughly dominated massacre like this. Like I said, congrats on your win but I think my post in our game thread about patronizing Cavs fans shows we don't really care to hear from you guys right now."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,elessarjd,12,Sat May 23 03:19:42 2015 UTC,I think you're being a bit melodramatic here.  Not wanting people to discuss the game because of how you feel.  Other hawk fans may feel differently about it.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,Orgcore,-12,Sat May 23 03:28:45 2015 UTC,I've cooled down a little bit more now and started to accept it...I figured everyone else was taking this as hard as I was.  It sucks to be completely hopeless when you're still 2 games away from elimination...I wanted to be completely hopeless once a team had won 4.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,deanremix,5,Sat May 23 04:26:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  That redditor didn't make us lose or make us play poorly.  I posted on their sub wishing them luck if they win the ECF. Losing sucks, for sure... but it's still just a game and we're here in the ECF!"
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,HOLY_HUMP3R,24,Sat May 23 04:35:14 2015 UTC,"Well, whatever makes you feel better man. Have a nice night and I hope you have a better day tomorrow."

That may be the reason.  Either way, agree with Holy- I want to win, but I don't want there to be any excuses.  Anyway, Hate to see any team play at less than 100%, unless its Pittsburgh or Baltimore. (or the bulls, because Noah sucks.)"
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,740Buckeye,6,Sat May 23 03:47:06 2015 UTC,"I mean there was a guy earlier who basically said he'd rip the heads off any cavs fan that came on the subreddit, so there's probably a bit of fear.

AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,goamateur,4,Sat May 23 03:44:39 2015 UTC,"Why do we not go to the paint more? I accept that 3's are our game but if they aren't falling (what are we for this series? 10-40?), stop shooting! They have rarely had good looks and it looks like every 3 taken is a result of a botched possession.  tl;dr: Go to paint. Get rhythm/confidence/better looks and most importantly POINTS from attacking the paint."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,MonkeyManJohannon,4,Sat May 23 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"When the Hawks are going 110% and the Cavs seem to be cruising at about 80%, it's easy to lose sight of anything good.  This team can win, but the Cavs were the better team in the last two games.  I hope to see the scales tip in our favor on Sunday, but to be perfectly honest, as long as I don't see our team just throw in the towel, I'm proud as hell of these Hawks, and win or lose, we're in the fucking Finals...that's something only 3 other teams did this season.  That's fucking awesome, even if it's the bitter end."

AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,YourFriendlyWhiteGuy,7,Sat May 23 03:17:42 2015 UTC,Fuck this negativity. Acting like the series is over after two games? That's how you get fucking swept! We're a good team and we have a chance to win the next game. We win the next game and this series is tight again.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,AlconTheFalcon,3,Sat May 23 09:34:28 2015 UTC,Dawg look at the stats.  It's not a good outlook. Plus were hurt and being out coached.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,welfarecuban,2,Sat May 23 03:32:55 2015 UTC,"i'm with you amigo. best road team in the east. play your game, play your best, and win game three and this is a series again. we're 3-3 on the road in these playoffs, and we're on a two game road winning streak."

AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,deanremix,7,Sat May 23 03:36:04 2015 UTC,Gonna keep this short and to the point. Im really upset with Coach Bud. I know that hes had some limitations because of injuries but thats not an excuse overall for how bad the tactical adjustments have been the entire playoffs. He's been out coached in every series on a regular basis and and a team that came into this game as one of the worst offensive units in the playoffs from a FG% POV is absolutely crushing us and there is no adjustment to counter it. I dont know what happened to you Bud but I dont like it.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,NOSDOOM,2,Sat May 23 04:08:02 2015 UTC,We agree on something!
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,khalorei,1 point,Sat May 23 03:42:36 2015 UTC,They may have one of the worst fg% but I think they may be leading in ortg and in points diff
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,Exilarchy,1 point,Sat May 23 06:58:34 2015 UTC,"I usually wouldn't admit to listening to Chuck and Chernoff but Chernoff pretty much said this exact thing this afternoon. He talked about how he expected to, by this point in the playoffs, be able to point to a game where a key adjustment won it for us. Nothing so far. Not to say I'm not a Bud fan but I'm surprised he hasn't had ""his moment"" in these playoffs."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,khalorei,4,Sat May 23 04:12:30 2015 UTC,"I never understood people's dislike of chuck and Chernoff? Chuck Oliver is a total ass, but he generally knows his stuff and provides an entertaining show. I just really enjoy Matt Chernoff in general. What is people's beef with their show?"
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,AlconTheFalcon,3,Sat May 23 04:10:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure, really. I generally enjoy it but haven't found many people that do."

AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,GBralta,5,Sat May 23 07:23:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Its been bad, and a major concern for me. I know hes a second year coach but when youre this deep into the playoffs you shouldnt be coaching on a Monty Williams level. This team has arguably the best pure 3 point shooter in the NBA (arguably being the key word) and Bud is completely  lost as to how to get him any open shots. I've never seen the offense enter one on one iso mode like i have in the playoffs, the regular season ball movement is a rarity and the defense has been bad. When opposing players start setting career highs vs you on a consistent basis than thats a you problem, and the defense approach has been so embarrassingly awful through the entirety of the playoffs that this getting crushed by the cavs isnt even remotely a shock to me."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,duhpolan,7,Sat May 23 09:24:39 2015 UTC,This series isn't over. We have to fight and we will.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,GBralta,26,Sat May 23 04:15:00 2015 UTC,I'm not one to be negative about the Hawks. But we bouta get swept.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,duhpolan,2,Sat May 23 03:10:27 2015 UTC,I think we get one in Cleveland.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,khalorei,17,Sat May 23 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"honestly speaking, how? I don't see how we can win a game. Our team-ball is long gone, and so are some of our players to injuries :( I just don't see it. It's been a great year, let's add players and make a run next year."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,crimedawg27,2,Sat May 23 03:15:28 2015 UTC,I upvoted all of these comments. /u/duhpolan because I agree and /u/GBralta because I want to believe!
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,whiskerss,5,Sat May 23 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"As crazy as it to conceive, I think it was actually beneficial for the injuries to occur to the cavs for this series. Our only chance to beat them is in an up and down game where our guys can get loose and in a shooters Rhythm. If Kyrie were playing then Teague would be blowing past them and if love were playing we wouldn't be getting crushed on the boards. In their stead, insert dellpickle who is giving us fools gold as good as the josh smith threes and ISO joe 21 ft 2's, by tempting us to play ISO ball. Insert Tristan Thompson and more mosgov to crush us on the boards. If we can just keep it close their offense goes to shit in the fourth quarter, but we have to find a way to get the offense moving again. Where are our cuts? Our multiple screens, multiple sets, and side to side action? They're being replaced by fools gold."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,Adampro123,2,Sat May 23 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"Not looking good, but we need to find a will to win somewhere. It's difficult when they just don't seem to miss from 3 and we keep tossing up bricks. Here's to trying to get a little healthy and coming out strong game 3."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,rubriclv4,2,Sat May 23 03:19:23 2015 UTC,This is really deflating and depressing but i hope this isn't going to stop fans from coming out and supporting the team going forward. The fans have been great all year and they deserved a better performance in this game. Hopefully we can win 1 in Cleveland and at least get it to game 5 and win 1 game at home for all the people who has came out and supported this team all year.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,TaTaToothey,2,Sat May 23 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"Guy I love the hawks. Grew up in the ATL. Having said that, every team has some teething to do their first time in the playoffs as a unit. This is a good learning experience. Now the guys know how much more intense playoff basketball (especially defense) is. Also don't forget Lebron is at full Lebron right now and well, good luck golden state."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,TribeFaninPA,4,Sat May 23 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"This has been a really interesting showing from the Hawks. I honestly don't feel like the Cavs are playing that great, we legitimately have lost our way. Really sucks"
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,uckTheSaints,4,Sat May 23 08:19:24 2015 UTC,I was glad to see Horford came back in the game.  Sorry to see Korver go down.  Hope he is okay.
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,DBac7812,3,Sat May 23 03:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well at least we're gonna find out if this team is for real or not on Sunday. I expect a win. Either way though, neither of these teams will be able to challenge the west winner if both teams continue to play like this."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,stilldontpaymenomind,2,Sat May 23 03:42:32 2015 UTC,Man reading /r/nba/new actually managed to piss me off again. I really hope they at least make this series interesting again over the next couple of games.

The feeling right now is one of those incredibly common moments you get watching Atlanta sports and cheering on a team - going from the  highest of highs to the lowest of the lows. I've been super fortunate to have a handful of them over the last years (Hawks 2014 season, Hawks 2013 season, Hawks 2012 season, Hawks 2011 season, Hawks 2010 season). It was one of those moments that you will have occasional nightmares about that remind yourself of the memory 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. years down the road."
AtlantaHawks,36y8zn,autowikibot,2,Sat May 23 03:38:20 2015 UTC,"It hurts man.  I knew when that game was 11-5 that we didn't have the pieces to stop their offense and we weren't going to outscore them the way the offense had turned into iso-ball.  I prepped myself for an emotional second half, regardless of whether it ended up knotted at 1 or it was the last time we were probably going to say goodbye to the team.  As the 3rd quarter went on, I knew there was literally no stopping their offense as is - either you're going to help on LeBron and they are going to get an open look at 3 or LeBron is just going to be too good to stop 1 on 1 for an easy 2.  There was one possession in the 3rd where for once, we didn't help out LBJ's defender.  He was defended well (by Millsap? Can't remember) and still was too strong and banked in a really tough shot with nothing but grace.  The offensive movement never showed up during that 3rd and I knew we were dead in the water.  It hurts.  I didn't think we would win this series but I thought we'd at least make it entertaining.  These two games have looked like the Magic ECSF from 2010 and there hasn't been a moment since halftime of game 1 where the Hawks haven't gotten thoroughly dominated in every part of the game.  Every time LeBron isos at half court, I just start flushing scoring possibilities through my head -- it's the scariest thing I've seen all season."

There needs to be changes in the off season.  Personally I think the small ball is not working.  We need a center.

AtlantaHawks,36xn58,hardindapaint12,10,Sat May 23 02:02:13 2015 UTC,Seriously the same fucking thing. Every fucking game. We just decide we want to stop passing the ball and playing defense and then go scoreless for minutes.
AtlantaHawks,36xn58,Payton23,8,Sat May 23 02:09:50 2015 UTC,"I am a big fan of Bud and will be after this horror. But the game plan here is on him, unless they just didn't execute. I also think Carroll playing was a distraction. Should have come back for game three."
AtlantaHawks,36xn58,Azhamilton,10,Sat May 23 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"We've been awful in 3rd quarter all playoffs. This is a coaching issue.

AtlantaHawks,36xn58,wildhairguy,4,Sat May 23 02:27:42 2015 UTC,If we could sub out Teague I think we'd be better off. His demeanor out there is bad.

AtlantaHawks,36xn58,cme9,8,Sat May 23 02:33:26 2015 UTC,Who the hell knows. Bud's coaching has looked suspect this series.

AtlantaHawks,36xn58,TheIronTARDIS,4,Sat May 23 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"So with Horford, Korver and Carroll injured, the scrappy bench will be worth watching Sunday. Even if we're Zero and two.  At that point, 1 win means we're only one win from tying. Long odds, sure, but still some Hawks basketball left."
AtlantaHawks,36xn58,-Runaway,4,Sat May 23 02:50:28 2015 UTC,I feel so sorry for all the people that paid to watch this farce that coach Bud and the Hawks are putting on. They have no idea what they're doing or what they should do.
AtlantaHawks,36xn58,DwightBeanie,4,Sat May 23 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"I like our bench now. Intensity. Fuck, maybe even playing for job security. Effort is all I, and I'm sure a lot of you guys, ask for right now. If you legit lose because the other team is better, then that's one thing. Bow out, and be happy you got to the ECF. But when you lose because of laziness, etc. I don't feel sympathy, nor do I have a real desire to watch anymore."

AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,FiftyShadesofpiss,25,Sat May 23 03:17:39 2015 UTC,The series is over. Now we are playing to not be embarrassed. I'm not optimistic. This series isn't coming back to Atlanta.
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,NakedCallBoy,3,Sat May 23 03:23:11 2015 UTC,"Wow so diehard, aren't you? We've lost two games. This isn't a best out of three. It's best of 7 and we're not even halfway through 6 games."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,ATL_Energy,4,Sat May 23 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"Bruh I love the Hawks as much as you do, but the Cavs are gonna have to shit the bed HARD for us to even win another game. Teague is now our only healthy starter (FURIOUSLY KNOCKS ON WOOD) and we can't even hit enough wide open shots to keep home court advantage. I'd be content to even get this back to Atlanta."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,NSFW_MANNING_ONLY,8,Sat May 23 05:10:11 2015 UTC,So how do you see this playing out? Seriously.   I want to believe but at the same time I have my feet on the ground

AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,Shade_Raven,1 point,Sat May 23 10:46:45 2015 UTC,"We played awful in both games. If we play even remotely well (which unfortunately has been a rarity recently), and the Cavs shooting percentage comes back down to reasonable levels, there's no reason why we couldn't steal a few games in Cleveland. Is it likely at this point? Nope...but I think we will win at least one of the next two games. This team has played best with their backs against the wall, so I think our best game of the series (I know, not a high bar) is yet to come."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,noodlz05,1 point,Sat May 23 03:47:05 2015 UTC,The series really isn't over. All it takes is one game to get back in it and put pressure on Cleveland.
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,uckTheSaints,10,Sat May 23 04:59:56 2015 UTC,This series isn't over.  This has been a great season in any case.
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,williammc,2,Sat May 23 03:21:59 2015 UTC,Lebron has never lost a series being 2-0 and the hawks have never won a series being down 0-2
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,homesickalienz,2,Sat May 23 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with what we've accomplished this season, but I'm disappointed with how the team is playing right now, and throughout the playoffs really. If we were playing our game and still getting beat, I'd be okay with that...but we seem to choke at least 1 quarter a game, which is something we never did during the regular season, it's insane. I don't know if it's the pressure of being the 1 seed in the playoffs, injuries, fatigue...could be any number of things...but you can see it in their demeanor and play. It's frustrating to watch.  Either way, I think we have a great future if we can re-sign Carroll and Millsap. The highs and lows of this year will ultimately make us a better team next year."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,noodlz05,2,Sat May 23 03:37:45 2015 UTC,"It's weird, success in the NBA seems to be predicated upon peaking at the right time.  SAS looked like the best team in the league from Jan to April, and then fell apart in round 1.  CLE looked terrible until late January, but is playing very well at the moment (despite injuries). ATL, for whatever reason, just isn't playong at their A level the last two rounds.  Outside of GSW, every team has had their ups and downs this season.  It's a fickle game."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,tomchaney479,2,Sat May 23 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone's saying we played awful.  The Hawks are getting killed not because they are playing awful or lack of effort, they are getting killed because they are just getting straight up outclassed by a really fucking good team on both ends of the floor.  Of course you're going to have to resort to non-stop poor 3's when the entire offense they've used for 82 games this season is getting stifled.  I wish they would use the usual offense too, but it isn't successful right now when they try it. The Cavs are rotating, playing screens, and anticipating passing lanes absolutely perfectly.  There's literally nothing the guys can do about this right now.  It fucking hurts and I hate how completely helpless it feels but it is what it is and that's why they are on their way to a sweep."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,Orgcore,2,Sat May 23 05:11:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry. They aren't outclassed by Mozgov, Delly, TT, JR, or anyone other than LeBron. They aren't setting good pics, they aren't moving the ball, they are settling for no pass or one pass shots when they have relied on quick ball movement and assists all season. Not sure why but they have lost sight of their style of play and are not capable of playing iso ball like LeBron can. End of season everyone is hurt on all teams. Our team just lost their focus and are running on fumes. They've done good this year but if our team is outclassed by Cleveland minus Kyrie and Love we should stop trying. Just move down to the D league."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,cwolfe,2,Sat May 23 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"No, we're getting killed because we're missing open shots and aren't moving the ball like we used to. That's all there is to it. Limiting the Cavs to 97 and 94 points is actually very good, especially considering that JR Smith got extremely hot in game 1 and in game 2 it was shumpert. Our offense is the problem and has been throughout this playoffs. We've been settling for way too many jumpers, and when we have been getting open looks they haven't been going down."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,atomsej,2,Sat May 23 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is you guys are all acting like there's not 5 other guys trying/succeeding in stopping us from moving the ball. For 82 games this season, we moved the ball at will and played with the defense like a marionette. The Cavs rotations and anticipation is too good for us to toy with them on offense like that."
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,Orgcore,0,Sat May 23 17:15:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, we're still playing like horse shit"
AtlantaHawks,36ya1f,ajg47,1 point,Sat May 23 13:53:42 2015 UTC,"The thing is, we haven't played a single good game since the playoffs started. That's 14 games in a row where we haven't found our rhythm and shooting. It's not going to change over the next two games, especially with us being away in cleveland."

AtlantaHawks,36yih6,mehjbmeh,5,Sat May 23 04:49:45 2015 UTC,"Marc Gasol as our Center and slide Horford to PF, Millsap to SF, Demarre as SG and Teague as PG. But if that didn't work then sign smaller contract guys for roles i.e. Tiago Splitter, Monta Ellis or maybe even a Conley"
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,callmerevan,3,Sat May 23 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"Gasol in Atlanta would be incredible and the money is there to sign him and Millsap to max contracts (if our new owners aren't overly cheap), but I don't think he's going to leave Memphis."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,Orgcore,2,Sun May 24 02:49:41 2015 UTC,"From what I heard and how things turned out for the Grizz it seems like Gasol and Conley are on their ways out. Marc said he's going to listen to all offers and won't rule anything out. But if he signs with the Hawks and we have the line-up of Gasol/Horford/Millsap/Demarre/Teague and have Scott, Korver, Schroder, Muscala, Bazemore and Splitter coming off the bench I think that the Hawks would be a constant threat to win the title. And hell if we can't sign Demarre and Gasol I'm perfectly fine with losing Demarre."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,callmerevan,1 point,Sun May 24 13:45:40 2015 UTC,"I think Gasol would be a good fit here if he were to ever leave Memphis. A lot of talk of him going to the spurs but we run a similar offense in a weaker conference with a good amount of cap room, no media pressure or at least not at the level of NY or LA, close enough to his home that it wouldn't be too much of a shift from Memphis( we have BBQ here) and he could be the face of the team that we are missing( Along with Horford but the boss is more of a secondary star then a first option kind of guy). Doubt it happens but a bear can dream..."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,bearg0d,8,Sun May 24 03:56:15 2015 UTC,No way in hell would I want Kobe Bryant on this team.   Deandre? We could get better big men.   I love Jimmy Butler. I think he would be a fantastic addition and would start ahead of Korver. Korver has been a bench player his entire career and would be really solid off the bench.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,thabooshka,3,Sat May 23 05:07:34 2015 UTC,"Teague/Schroder/Mack  Korver/Bazemore  Carroll/Sefolosha/Daye  Millsap/Scott/Muscala  Horford/  IIRC, this is the list we will have heading into F/A. Personally, I don't want to break up the core. Talent is already pretty deep but why not make it deeper, however it may be hard seeing as there is not much mid level talent in this F/A group. Here are some guys I'd would be happy to have on the roster. I have tried to look for guys who fit our system.   Alexis Ajinca   A mid range threat and he will help the team on the boards being 7'2"". Has come off the bench for NOP and although he is a little slow on defence I am sure Bud will help develop him better than Monty Williams. Ajinca will be relatively cheap to sign (3-5mil) and an upgrade on Pero. Eric Gordon  Sticking with the NOP theme. There aren't any other iso players in this F/A group. Even though he is almost the last resort, I think adding Gordon, a 3pt threat and a nightly chance to go off to the Korver/Bazemore rotation will make a dangerous combination.He has had injury issues in the past which will hopefully bring his value down but he did finish off the season strong which is a good sign.   Greg Monroe  I haven't watched enough of him tbh. 6'11"" big man would make the hawks bigs rotation even more imposing. Still young and could be developed into a guy to fit our system. Put up some big games this season. Needs to work on mid range.    It is unlikely we can afford all three of these guys, these are just some of the less obvious suggestions so we can improve our core instead of throwing our cap space at Jordan, Lopez, Hibbert etc.  Anyways, we still have work to do this season with the team we have."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,goamateur,6,Sat May 23 10:42:10 2015 UTC,"These are some good realistic singings. We aren't gonna get Conley, Griffin or Kobe lol"
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,KickedInTheDonuts,4,Sat May 23 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"You guys are crazy if you really think you want DeAndre.  You would need a brand new offense if you brought him in and you have such a great thing going.  He has virtually 0 offensive skills.  He's not a good fit in Bud's system at all for a max contract.  You guys should trade Teague $8 million contract and trust in Schroeder's and Mack's development if you can't get a better point guard in return.  Possibly the trade could free up enough salary cap space to resign both Millsap and Demarre.  Different plan obviously if you can sign one of the big time free agents this summer.    I think Kosta Koufus as a backup big man for you guys would bring some much  needed defense and rebounding to your bench.  Some other solid role player I think could make a huge impact are Barbosa, Seraphin, and Al Farauq Aminu.   I would also keep an eye out on the Toronto Raptors blowup that might happen this summer.  Picking up Lowry for Teague would really give you another leader and go to guy.  Jonas Valanciunas would be interesting too if you lost Millsap.  Ty Lawson is another player who would be good to try to trade for."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lackingcredibility9,3,Sat May 23 07:56:38 2015 UTC,I would not want Lowry for Teague personally I'm just fine with the one two combo of schroder and teague. We need a big man and a true SG.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,callmerevan,-1,Sat May 23 20:51:56 2015 UTC,Korver isn't a true SG?
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Sat May 23 20:55:50 2015 UTC,Hawks fans downvoting me for defending Korver!?!?  You guys really need to step up as fans.  You win 60 games and make the conference finals and then after losing game 2 you all start talking about how this team can't win as constructed and wanting to change the entire team.  You guys are the nicest fans but you aren't very supportive of your great team.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Mon May 25 09:22:47 2015 UTC,Korver has no ability to make his own shot off the dribble and that inability showed to really hurt us in the last two rounds. In the playoffs he hasn't gotten near the same amount of breathing room as he did in the regular season and his shooting percentage has shown that.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,dillardPA,1 point,Wed May 27 04:49:27 2015 UTC,I watched about 90% of hawks games and from what I saw he didn't get much breathing room in the regular season either except against the crappy defensive teams.  What you need to look for is not how he gets himself shots but how bud's system uses him to create shots for other.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lackingcredibility9,0,Wed May 27 07:26:13 2015 UTC,"i don't consider him to be a true starting sg. Sure he's a great shot and all but he isn't starting material, if he was to come off the bench that would be a huge lift for our team simply because he's better as a bench player."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,callmerevan,0,Sat May 23 21:29:51 2015 UTC,I can't agree with that.  He's the most important player in your offense and gives every other player on the team the space to operate.  No player on your team makes a bigger statistical impact when they are on or off the floor than Korver.  He is one of the greatest shooters of all time and just had a career year.  He is a solid defender and a great passer.  He tires out whatever opposing team's starter is guarding him.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lackingcredibility9,0,Sat May 23 21:40:22 2015 UTC,"But he can only play pick and pop and rotate without the ball on back screens and such. He's a solid defender and a great shot but he's not the reason why the Hawks are lethal on offense. The fact that Millsap and horford have amazing midrange shots and millsap even stretching to the three coupled with teague and carroll, who we know can shoot the three and hit the midrange, is why this hawks team is great. Kyle is not the reason for the spacing, its the fact every single starter can hit jumpsuits reliably that makes us usually so deadly."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,callmerevan,0,Sat May 23 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"The statistics tell a different story about how important he is.  I wish I were able to look up actual statistics right now but your offense isn't very good when Korver isn't on the floor.  Also about the spacing, a coach setting up his defense isn't treating a Horford 15 footer the same as a Korver wide open 3.  A Korver wide open unchallenged 3 is basically worth the same as a wide open layup.  Defenders will give up the Horford midrange if they have to.  A Korver challenged 3 is a very bad shot to give up and a korver wide open 3 is a shot a defense cannot give up under any circumstances.  A great coach like bud can use that as a deadly weapon to create good shots for the other players in a way that would not work with a less lethal sniper."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lackingcredibility9,1 point,Sun May 24 00:01:47 2015 UTC,Shroder doesn't have the court vision we need. Love his slash in the paint but he just doesn't have the play creation yet. Teague really let me down in the playoffs so I don't know what we do. Don't know where his mojo went.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,cwolfe,2,Sat May 23 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"Lmao kawaii. Imo I think we need a clear cut leader. I love ball movement, but I really feel the critics are right. We need someone to perform in crunch time. Idk anything about who's available or anything, but I think we need someone who's playoff tested and ready to lead. Idk who that is tho."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,duhpolan,3,Sat May 23 05:06:22 2015 UTC,"It's not about having someone to perform in crunch time at all. If we moved the ball and made open shots last night, then I'd probably remember the night. We have up. We need someone outspoken with fire on this team."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,ajg47,1 point,Sat May 23 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant lol I guess I didn't really say that tho"
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,duhpolan,-4,Sat May 23 14:17:16 2015 UTC,LOL that's a textbook Freudian Slip.  You don't think Leonard is that dude?
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,fuckinkangaroos,2,Sat May 23 07:56:08 2015 UTC,"We need a rim-protecting center who can score and REBOUND. Millsap and Horford are too similar and undersized to bang with the bigger guys. Keep Demarre and let Paul walk. Bring the 7'3 Edy Tavares over to replace Pero. Hell, I'd even be okay reupping Pero at his $1M rate to be the transition backup center since Bud inexplicably loves him and just have Edy replace Elton on the roster.  Offer big bucks to Marc Gasol, Greg Monroe, Deandre Jordan, Brook Lopez, or Draymond Green. Horford would slide to 4 with Moose, Mike Scott, and I guess Austin Daye behind him.  Hawks had 27th lowest payroll this season, $5M below the cap. Hopefully new owners buck that trend and spend even more than the $27M cap space available to replace Paul and re-sign Demarre. Plus we get Thabo back. Damn NYPD.  If Booker falls to us at 15 in the draft, maybe trade Teague if we can get a star wing in return; Heil Schroder! Otherwise, a wing like RJ Hunter or a big like Kaminsky but who really knows.   Faith in Bud and hopefully new owners let Danny Ferry (the true GM of the Year) return from exile.  But THIS SERIES AIN'T OVER. True Believer until the final buzzer. Caw fucking Caw!"
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,Orgcore,1 point,Sat May 23 05:29:47 2015 UTC,"I really want Kaminsky but I fear that ship sailed when the Pacers and Heat choked away the 8 seed to the lovely Brooklyn Nets a little over a month ago :l.  Kaminsky is going to be Millsap but with more height and maybe stronger if he can put on some more muscle over the next few years.  Bobby Portis might be alright...6'11"", 242 PF and can shoot the 3.  If he puts on 10-15 pounds, he'd be great learning behind Millsap for a couple years."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,lnternational,1 point,Sat May 23 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"Kaminsky is a solid pick, given the 15th you should have a realistic chance to get him as he is projected somewhere between 12 and 17. I would love him in Cleveland behind Mozgov. Then we no longer have to play Varejao at center.."

AtlantaHawks,36yih6,Orgcore,0,Sat May 23 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think about signing short contracts at SF and PF for 2015?  2016's free agent class is loaded so we could just clear space and offer a couple max contracts to a guy like LeBron, Durant, Brook Lopez, Kevin Love (RFA), David Lee, Nicolas Batum, Gallinari (RFA), etc...  As for 2015, maybe LBJ wins in Cleveland, decides his work is done and declines his player option?  We could offer him a max.  I know that's unlikely, but pickings are super slim.  Other options include Jeff Green, Mike Dunleavy, DeMarre, Gerald Green, Luke Babbitt, Kyle Singler (RFA).  Power forwards include LMA, Millsap, Smoove (lol), David West (player option), Thad Young (who might be tired of losing), Bass...hell I think Bargnani would be an awesome Hawk but he might be a bit expensive for what you're getting."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,LAXlittleant26,-5,Sun May 24 02:46:57 2015 UTC,"Trade Teague. Let Paul Millsap Walk Cut Antic   Make a push to sign Conley and DeAndre. Which would allow us to move Al to his true position, and yield better results as well.  We placed our trust in Jeff to lead the team, and the results have been the same under various coaches. Maybe Woodson was right all along in not giving him more minutes. Dude just seems uninterested in playoff basketball.  Moose has proven he's ready. The ones stopping him are Antic and Coach Bud."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,ajg47,6,Sat May 23 06:50:26 2015 UTC,No one is stopping Moose. Mike Woodson is never right. DeAndre Jordan would never fit in our fucking system.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,LAXlittleant26,1 point,Sat May 23 13:47:09 2015 UTC,So I take it you have no problem trading Teague for whatever we can get or signing Conley?
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,ajg47,1 point,Sat May 23 17:50:07 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I want a leader as a point guard. It's clear Jeff won't be that guy.
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,Catuey,-4,Sat May 23 18:00:24 2015 UTC,"Forget DeAndre, I'd rather go after Blake Griffin. Sign and trade Millsap + player + a pick? Horford and Griffin would be a devastating front court."
AtlantaHawks,36yih6,DemonicDimples,4,Sat May 23 10:34:58 2015 UTC,There's no way the Clippers would trade Griffin

Our strength as always been our teamwork and depth. Losing a guy like Carroll doesn't mean as much to us as it does to Cleveland. With that being said, GO HAWKS!!"
AtlantaHawks,36vesc,ssovm,4,Fri May 22 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"We have had to listen to that all season. I can't stand it when these commentators try to rip us because we don't have some stand-out, over payed, walking Nike contract. We win because we have SEVERAL great players at extensive depth who play fantastically together as a team. Game 1 I believe it was Chris Webber who said something along the lines of us not having a ""superstar"", but how 5 of our guys combine to make one. Bitch, our starting 5 are better than one fucking superstar! We have beaten superstars all season. We are about to come out strong tonight and stun Cleveland in the Highlight Factory."

AtlantaHawks,36vesc,TheDuke4,-1,Fri May 22 18:24:07 2015 UTC,I don't want to be the Debby Downer but depth counts a lot less when it comes to defense...DeMarre is the best defender on the team (and Thabo is #2) so losing him is absolutely massive since we're so reliant on him to stop the LePipe.  Also this throws off our rotations and our offense is heavily reliant on chemistry...the new rotations as a result of position shifts probably haven't gotten enough reps to avoid sloppy turnovers.

But on the bright side, worst case scenario you'll miss an awesome Hawks victory. Which means we got an awesome Hawks victory.

AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,atlantajordan,8,Fri May 22 14:53:55 2015 UTC,What a spectacularly deep and informative breakdown.   That was wonderful. The laziness on the screens has been frustrating all series. I'd love to see them commit to getting Korver open on every possession.
AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,jperez3209,3,Fri May 22 15:15:42 2015 UTC,All series?  It's been 1 game!
AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,GhostdadUC,0,Fri May 22 19:24:30 2015 UTC,Obviously I meant all playoffs.
AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,jperez3209,3,Fri May 22 22:31:07 2015 UTC,It's almost painful to see those clips of it working well earlier in the season alongside so much offensive bumbling. Great video.
AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,eavc,3,Fri May 22 15:19:30 2015 UTC,This is exactly what happened to Korver when he was on the Bulls
AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,windmuffin,2,Fri May 22 22:06:56 2015 UTC,awesome video! will be checking out more of this series!

AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,oballistikz,2,Fri May 22 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"Basically what it boils down to is, to get him good shots, we need to move the ball in a way that draws his defender away from him and towards the interior, and then set up screens that get the ball to him with a little space and time, and we're failing to do that consistently."
AtlantaHawks,36vt0s,mtmv2,1 point,Fri May 22 22:57:03 2015 UTC,I gotcha. That makes sense obviously. His words though seemed so complicated.
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,pzauteenk,7,Fri May 22 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"Coach Bud put him in a couple games in the Brooklyn series, but his offense wasnt good. When his offense isnt going he is basically useless since his defense sucks. In the playoffs, you give more time to your starters instead of your bench because the other team does the same and every game counts. I feel like since Demarre is injured that Scott will get some minutes this next game, and hopefully his shooting is on point tonight."
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,atomsej,3,Fri May 22 16:28:33 2015 UTC,Bud said that DMC being injured most likely won't affect Mike Scott's minutes. Meaning he's probably completely out of the rotation. Moose has taken any minutes that were left.
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,ajg47,3,Fri May 22 16:46:43 2015 UTC,But moose is awesome.
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,oballistikz,1 point,Fri May 22 23:03:19 2015 UTC,He's definitely performed above expectations
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,ajg47,6,Fri May 22 23:11:53 2015 UTC,"I just recently was wondering the same thing and decided to look into it.    Apparently, Bud called Scott into his office at the end of the Brooklyn series and said that they were going to try something and move Moose into the lineup and Scott would no longer be in the rotation.  Scott said he didn't really know why, but that he was just ready to be a good teammate and be prepared if they decide they need him to step up.    IMO, I'd love to see Scott on the floor.  He can ignite a crowd with his monster dunks or getting hot from 3.  Hopefully he'll snag some minutes tonight, but I'm not counting on it."
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,Big_Balled_Hawks,3,Fri May 22 16:55:52 2015 UTC,Makes me think we might try to trade him and Bud is trying to develop Moose. I really hope not though.Im hoping he goes ham like he did against the pacers last year.
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,bearg0d,6,Fri May 22 17:14:55 2015 UTC,There's going to come a time when Mike Scott is going to have his time to shine this series and he is going to light it up. I guarantee it
AtlantaHawks,36w0zp,meep6969,2,Fri May 22 16:39:12 2015 UTC,he sucked tonight :(

AtlantaHawks,36tes8,TheDuke4,10,Thu May 21 23:42:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember seeing this live and thinking it was a flop. JR smith had a drive attempt where he snapped his head back when he was a foot away from his defender then did it again once they closed out and got the foul that pissed me off but it could have just been the angle I was at, doubt it though."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,bearg0d,7,Fri May 22 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"I was at the game and they showed a replay of it there. Really was a huge flop.  And every Cleveland player did that ""snap your head back"" thing to try and draw a foul after J.R. got that call even though it was clearly a flop"
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,Intercepting,4,Fri May 22 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"I could see this was a flop from the other side of the arena.  Shumpert made the shitlist for the rest of the series with that one, and I go to Georgia Tech."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,Orgcore,6,Fri May 22 03:48:10 2015 UTC,I hate that they called this a foul on Korver yet Pero and Milsapp were getting shoved down the court and there was no calls.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,Adampro123,6,Fri May 22 11:10:02 2015 UTC,"Again, the Hawks didn't play their game and didn't deserve to win but these calls were happening ALL night."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,TaTaToothey,6,Fri May 22 12:08:49 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Cavs won that through LeBron and JR killing it, but the calls did us no justice. Wouldn't have affected the outcome I don't believe, it's just good to point out the ridiculousness."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,drrhythm2,5,Fri May 22 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno - the Hawks are a momentum team, and we had a lot of momentum early in the game, and a few of the offensive foul calls really kept us from building a big lead, and also got in the guys heads."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,TaTaToothey,4,Fri May 22 12:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they had like three offensive calls in a row and then Paul got that tech - ruined our lead and got us out of our offense. We can't do that again though - we won't get the calls and they have to know that"
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,drrhythm2,3,Fri May 22 12:41:40 2015 UTC,"Also, it seems like in the playoffs we tend to start out hot and then fade over time, then come back to life late, but maybe by then its too late. I'm over-generalizing, but we really seem to have great first quarters, then the middle of the game is just trying to hang in there."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,TheReverendWillyG,6,Fri May 22 12:45:20 2015 UTC,Surely it didn't help and momentum for us is such a huge factor. I just don't want to be one of THOSE guys. We lost the first game of the last series too and look who's still playing. Best thing we can do is learn from our mistakes and apply corrective measure in Game 2. I'm pumped. ATL is pumped. Let's wreck these fools.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,Shade_Raven,0,Fri May 22 12:51:24 2015 UTC,and the refs handed the game to Cleveland  mid way through and the rest was garbage time
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,jperez3209,5,Fri May 22 17:12:42 2015 UTC,Look at that offensive foul...
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,BillClintonSaxMaster,3,Fri May 22 13:09:46 2015 UTC,I'd just like to see Lebron get called for a few of his stiff arms and arm slaps when he drives.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,__xaq,2,Fri May 22 14:57:19 2015 UTC,"Biggest pet peeve in all of professional sports. The only way he gets by his defender in a one-on-one situation (with the exception of calling for a screen) is when he extends with his off-arm at the start of the dribble, during the dribble, and again at the hoop. He's super athletic but he's not quick enough to beat people off the dribble. And then they call shit like this on Korver? Please."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,homesickalienz,9,Fri May 22 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, but Kyle did himself no favors with that left hand."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,JacarSwe,7,Fri May 22 01:34:05 2015 UTC,Shit attempt at a flop and shit attempt to call it what it is by the ref.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,homesickalienz,1 point,Fri May 22 00:56:20 2015 UTC,Did Korver push him in the chest?
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,JacarSwe,1 point,Fri May 22 01:41:40 2015 UTC,No I meant call it a shit flop. Let em play or call a foul on shump.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,homesickalienz,-21,Fri May 22 02:03:54 2015 UTC,He pushed of with a straight arm. That's a foul. The ref is standing right there.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,DemonicDimples,6,Fri May 22 02:08:46 2015 UTC,This is so minimal compared to all the other fouls the past 2 series. I don't see that push as something to complain about
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,Sawgon,-6,Fri May 22 02:14:32 2015 UTC,But it's still a foul regardless of if Shump emphasized the contact.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,JacarSwe,5,Fri May 22 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"He didn't push off anything. He put his hand on him and he flopped. A lot of players put their hands on other players without putting any force into it.  Example 1: LeBron puts his hand on a player, no force behind it, not a push.  Example 2: LeBron puts his hand/arm on player, uses force, pushes."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,Sawgon,-1,Fri May 22 04:39:09 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to make contact with a player if your arm aint straight just like in these pictures. Krover extended his arm untill it was straight and made contact whiel trying to make space. Its a pretty easy call for the ref. For example in picture 2, if Lebron toke a step back and extends his arm to make space he would comit an offensive foul."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,JacarSwe,3,Fri May 22 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"if Lebron toke a step back and extends his arm to make space   Hilarous, considering that's his go-to move when driving. Are you in the comments asking for a foul on him every time he does it?"
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,AlconTheFalcon,-2,Fri May 22 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"No? I was just here because people dont seem to understand that when you extend your arm and make contact whiel trying to make space its a offensive foul. Im pretty sure Lebron does it and pretty much any NBA player does it. But when its as isolated and obvious as in this case it will be called. But Lebron sure is one of the players that is using it a lot and should probably be called more. But he is in his 12th year and have been doing it for a whiel. Refs dont call it against him, and they dont call it on a lot of players."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,GhostdadUC,2,Fri May 22 14:11:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, Lebron just got banned from the NBA for years of doing it."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,JacarSwe,0,Fri May 22 05:54:16 2015 UTC,A little bit but it wasn't a lot.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,GhostdadUC,-2,Fri May 22 02:04:02 2015 UTC,So is it a foul?
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,JacarSwe,2,Fri May 22 02:07:46 2015 UTC,By the book? Yes.  I don't know if I would call it a foul in the conference finals.
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri May 22 02:08:26 2015 UTC,Well I guess Lebron should stop pushing with his forearm and go full arm leangth.

AtlantaHawks,36tes8,atlantajordan,-3,Thu May 21 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing the other angle and it was a definite push-off. Yes, Shump ""sold"" the push off but he did not ""flop.""   It was an iffy call but the push off was easy to see."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,TSR3K,3,Fri May 22 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. That is nowhere close to an offensive foul.. I get it if you want to say bad calls went both ways, but there's no way you can say this one didn't go the cavs way."
AtlantaHawks,36tes8,eleven21,0,Fri May 22 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"The other angle shows you more of the subtle push off. But like I said, it was an ""iffy"" call. I guess I was just arguing with the point of the whole post that Shump should be fined for a flop when I don't think it was a flop."

AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,HOLY_HUMP3R,-3,Thu May 21 17:50:40 2015 UTC,I'm gonna need you to know which team Atlanta beat to get its ONLY pro championship in history.
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,ATL_Hawksfan,1 point,Thu May 21 18:01:09 2015 UTC,"Would I rather he play? Sure. But I'd much rather he be healthy, Demarre is a role model and one of my favorite players.  I don't give a fuck about imaginary internet points and I stand by what I said"
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,killjoyous,16,Thu May 21 18:59:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck these assholes who are cheering for this injury. Not saying there's any here or even on /r/clevelandcavs, but I've seen some IRL and it's sickening.   I was watching yesterday's game with a group of five friends, all Cavs fans, and of the six of us, absolutely fucking zero of us were cheering or applauding the injury.   DeMarre had made himself into a household name this year, I was really looking forward to watching him test his muster against LBJ in this series, and up until his injury he was doing a pretty damn good job.   For the next 3-6 games, we're as bitter of rivals as there can be, but when this series is over I still wish all y'all the best. This Hawks team plays a different kind of ball, completely selfless, no hero shit, and it's refreshing to see.   Between Thabo's accident assault by the NYPD (not picking that fight, I'm in NWA's corner though) and now this, y'all had the shittiest run of shit luck I've seen happen to a playoff-caliber team.    I'd be lying if I said I didn't want the Cavs to win the ECF, but not like this, man. Not like this."
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,OpticalDelusions,6,Thu May 21 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"I second this so hard. I was watching the game and let out an audible, ""Fuck....no...."" when I saw DeMarre go down. I don't know how anyone could cheer for ANY man to get injured, let alone someone like DeMarre who goes out there and gives it his all and seems like a genuinely good guy. With Love's injury we know all too well how it feels and it makes me angry that anyone could wish that upon another player."
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,Nizzl,6,Thu May 21 18:07:41 2015 UTC,"Love's injury was as bad or worse than Carroll's, but at least with Love's injury we had a villain. Carroll's injury was just shit luck, which is so hard to accept when you're talking about a guy who cracked the  top-25 player list this year."
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,OpticalDelusions,5,Fri May 22 04:14:01 2015 UTC,"I guess good for him when it comes to him being a FA.... Sucks for us that we can't use our best player on the floor right now. I hope he gets healthy, not for the series but for himself.  He's just one of those guys that's been through so much and deserves the rewards."
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,kareemk,2,Thu May 21 15:03:11 2015 UTC,Such class being displayed by this sub. I've wanted you to see you folks in the semis since you hosted the pregame thread.

Oh well, can't complain about 4-1 series win for us (please don't get swept. Please don't get swept.)"
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,kareemk,1 point,Thu May 21 15:39:43 2015 UTC,What's the likelihood that we resign him?
AtlantaHawks,36qzx6,friskydrisky,2,Thu May 21 13:38:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It depends, if there's a surplus of support from the fans. It might make him decide to stay, and take a couple mil less than him going anywhere else.   I'd personally would love to see him progress his game with us. But ultimately it's his call. This will probably be his only chance to get a massive contract."

AtlantaHawks,36syaz,TheDuke4,-9,Thu May 21 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"Yea I hope so. If Korver keeps pushing of with a straight arm we will probably be able to take advantage of it. Korver didn't even looked at the ref, he knew what he did."
AtlantaHawks,36syaz,JacarSwe,3,Fri May 22 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"Did you even watch the video? He doesn't ""push off"". Korver never touches anything but the defender's hand before he side steps into his shot. The point is that Shumpert tries to sell it and he looks like an IDIOT. It doesn't change the game. It's just worth pointing out."
AtlantaHawks,36syaz,TheDuke4,-7,Fri May 22 02:15:37 2015 UTC,That angel is stupid. You can't see if he hit him on the arm or in the chest. But he did hit him and Shumpert exaggerated the contact to sell the foul. And why is it worth pointing it out? It's not like the Cavs flopped their way through the game. It was a stupid push off which might not have made much contact but enough for Krover to just turn around and walk.
AtlantaHawks,36syaz,JacarSwe,4,Fri May 22 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out simply because it's a horrible call and a blatant flop. Go troll some other thread. It's ""ANGLE"" btw."
AtlantaHawks,36syaz,Intercepting,-4,Fri May 22 02:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not trolling. You do know you are not allowed to push of with an extended arm. It's a foul. Thanks I was pretty unsure about the ""Angel"" ""Angle"", English ain't my first language. Sure it might not have been called a foul if Shumpert didn't sell it. Korver can only blame himself for that."
AtlantaHawks,36syaz,JacarSwe,6,Fri May 22 02:38:19 2015 UTC,"I was there and it was an obvious flop. And it happened right in front of me.  Your own fan base is even agreeing that it was a huge flop. You're not going to win this one, bud."

AtlantaHawks,36s6vv,NayOfThunder,5,Sat May 23 00:07:16 2015 UTC,"It was a personnel issue. With JYD out and JR Smith on fire/Korver being a liability on defense last night, they put Kent on the perimeter oriented JR and Paul on LeBron. I don't get the half court pick up quite as much but it could've been a combination of trying to force LBJ into a turnover/confuse him with a different style/ give the help defenders plenty of time to react if LBJ gets past Millsap (then Sap would recover to stop any pass out of a drive by LBJ). Paul actually did a pretty good job. James got by him for a dunk but on the reply you see Kent and Korver both run back to the shooters instead of rotating to stop lebron."

AtlantaHawks,36pog7,Aviator157,0,Thu May 21 03:20:25 2015 UTC,It was unlikely but I wouldn't have been shocked to see him get close to it.
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,ATL_GritzBlitz,1 point,Thu May 21 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"He's had a great playoffs and I wouldn't be surprised if he gets overpaid, but he's still a 12/5 3&D player who's 28 years old."
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,dillpickles007,1 point,Thu May 21 14:54:40 2015 UTC,because he is going to be coming back from a serious injury from what it looked like
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,Keeks_marone,1 point,Thu May 21 15:34:28 2015 UTC,I think he'll be fine.  It looked a lot worse than what it actually was.  I hate saying it but usually when a player is in a ton of pain that's actually a good sign.  Tears often go unnoticed right away.
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,GhostdadUC,16,Thu May 21 03:19:56 2015 UTC,The ONLY ONLY ONLY silver lining on this (I even hate using that term) is that his price will go down which makes it even more likely we can retain him. I pray he's okay though.
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,ajg47,6,Thu May 21 15:10:52 2015 UTC,"Oh geez.  That's a rough way of thinking of it, haha."

AtlantaHawks,36pog7,yellowcurry30,13,Thu May 21 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"Posted in another thread on here, but since this is also related to DeMarre's injury - wanted to chat here with you guys as well.  I'm going to take cover here in 'enemy territory', but wanted to say that our friends in /r/clevelandcavs were pretty upset about that foul.  We hate to see an injury, especially after having so many of our own.  To see that much pain on an elite athlete is hard to watch and I wish him the best and hope it's nothing serious.  Dude has serious skills.  Good luck and I hope no more injuries!  Whichever team comes out of this has to represent the East well and we can't do that with all these banged up teams."

AtlantaHawks,36pog7,humancartograph,2,Thu May 21 11:58:56 2015 UTC,Career as a Hawk... So yes he thinks if this is the end of his 'Hawks' career then...
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,uglycrepes,2,Thu May 21 12:12:28 2015 UTC,"OP said ""Hawks career"" not ""career"" so he's talking about his career as a Hawk not as a NBA player in general."
AtlantaHawks,36pog7,nerdyintentions,-19,Thu May 21 13:05:22 2015 UTC,"I have watched that over and over. and I know everyone thinks i'm crazy but I urge you to watch again.  James leglocks Carroll.

AtlantaHawks,36r0np,Jus10Crummie,2,Thu May 21 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah he did, Lebron did his mind games at first, then we went on a run."
AtlantaHawks,36r0np,lowercaselong,1 point,Thu May 21 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"going on an offensive run and guarding lebron are two completely different things though. look, no matter who you put on him, hes going to drive and score points, but i think its a mistake assigning paul to him. that's all i'm saying.  edit: i'll retract slightly after getting into this post but i still feel like we have to come up with another suitable option for LBJ"
AtlantaHawks,36r0np,duhpolan,1 point,Thu May 21 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"I think we can pull through, and here's why: some good signs from Wednesdays game. We had so many isolation plays and bone headed plays down the stretch, yet we were still in it at the end; a 2 possession game if we didn't make stupid turnovers. Jr Smith played like a man possessed, but I still think we ""slowed"" lebron down. His distribution was totally off, and his isos weren't that scary because of our swarming defensive nature whenever he drives. Two of Korvers shots were waved off by stupid calls, which I feel would've given him and the team some momentum and confidence. One thing we should do: put in streaky shooters Mike Scott and shelvin Mack! What happened to being one of the best three point shooting teams? We need these type of guys to get hot, I mean that's how we got 60 wins in the first place. Now I don't see as many drive and kicks, I just see forced not in rhythm threes from Teague, Carroll, and schroder. If we can just tone that down and find the open man, we can win this. I believe."

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,thrashfan,39,Thu May 21 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"Copy/Paste of my comment from the /r/nba PGT   Shaq said it best in the post game. When we start playing stationary, we are very easy to guard. If we keep up our movement all game (like we had in the first half) we are nearly unbeatable, but for some reason, we always break down.   Why in the hell can we not keep up our game for 48 minutes? It is literally 24 minutes of really good Hawks basketball, then 24 minutes of fucking playground hero ball that let's the other team back in it or win it EVERY SINGLE GAME."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,12,Thu May 21 03:36:07 2015 UTC,Good point. I saw some great basketball in the first half and then at the end with the run lead by Baze.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,KickedInTheDonuts,10,Thu May 21 03:38:29 2015 UTC,Why in the hell can we not keep up our game for 48 minutes?   Running around a lot is tiring.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,quentin-coldwater,2,Thu May 21 13:13:14 2015 UTC,"Yup. Watching them play 110% during the first half makes me tired for them. By halftime, I'm breaking a sweat from just lifting beers to my mouth."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,burgerkingdomdelight,7,Thu May 21 14:45:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. It seemed like in the second half Korver especially just stood still in the corner with Schumpert on top of him. No movement at all.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Mgarc1125,6,Thu May 21 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This was such a winnable game if they just kept up their effort from the first half. As soon as we were down by 18, they start trying again and come back. It's like they abandon everything that worked in the first half and start throwing up terrible shots. It's frustrating to watch because I feel we are the more talented team"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,nouvellediscotheque,3,Thu May 21 04:13:02 2015 UTC,"We are no longer playing our up tempo, quick passing game in the second half. Why? I don't know. It seems to work pretty damn well in the first half."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,cwolfe,2,Thu May 21 04:04:37 2015 UTC,One of the things that really stands out for me is Bud calls time outs and tells them to move the ball and play at a fast pace and  we don't change a thing. Beginning of games and 3rd quarters they get the message (3rd quarter sometimes) but once we stop moving we don't seem to remember to move again.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,emperornel,30,Thu May 21 13:06:11 2015 UTC,Please recover soon Demarre. Cavs fans are being very civil.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,JesusCock,31,Thu May 21 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing we agree on, injuries are making the playoffs less fun :/"

Lebron is Lebron and nothing we can do about JR being well defended but still able to make the shot. But an injury is always worst than a loss. Sad day"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,humma__kavula,12,Thu May 21 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"Felt like we kinda gave up a bit there once the lead got away. Seemed pretty even matched otherwise. Oh well, Friday is another game."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,OldOrder,1 point,Thu May 21 03:34:19 2015 UTC,Really? I thought we showed good fight to come back and make it a game after JR was hitting everything and Demarre's injury. The way they played with energy from that point gave me hope for Friday.

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,SirSwerveAlot,10,Thu May 21 03:48:41 2015 UTC,Can someone with more basketball knowledge tell me why on earth Korver and the other guys GOT OUT OF THE WAY to allow Lebron to dagger dunk us? What the flying eff was that about??
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Shade_Raven,7,Thu May 21 05:52:58 2015 UTC,Scared
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,lnternational,1 point,Thu May 21 12:55:48 2015 UTC,Would you like to be hit by 200-something pounds coming at you at full speed? I would have ran out of the damn arena
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ksunole,2,Thu May 21 09:58:05 2015 UTC,"6'8, 250lbs. Dude was already by everyone at that point. Only thing to do would have been to foul and it would had to have been a flagrant to stop him. We were out of position from the get go there with Horford and Milsap not in position."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,eavc,0,Thu May 21 13:59:54 2015 UTC,Nobody was scared. That's insane. Korver was floating to cover the outlet pass because there were a ton of Hawks behind him to step in front of Lebron. No idea what those guys were thinking. The basketball equivalent of a blown coverage.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,mtmv2,0,Thu May 21 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"If you watch the replay, Korver and Baze run out to the perimeter to cover the 2 guys on the wing that would be wide open on a kickout 3. The problem with that play was right before LeBron's drive, when Horford went way too far out after I think TT, when TT was setting up a screen for LeBron. That left the middle wide open for LeBron, and it's between staying with LeBron and giving up a wide open 3 or a potential and-1, or running out to cover the wide open guys on the wing, which was their job anyway. It was Al's fault on that play."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,nouvellediscotheque,38,Thu May 21 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"Sucks that Demarre is hurt, huge loss on D.   Liked Bazemore's intensity.   At least Korver made a 3 this game.   Fuck JR Smith."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,beardman_cometh,10,Thu May 21 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"Also, Teague should have been more involved 2nd half."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,nouvellediscotheque,13,Thu May 21 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"He was involved in throwing up bricks and trying to get fouled. He should have been driving, distributing the basketball and trying to run the offense. You are exactly right."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,beardman_cometh,12,Thu May 21 03:42:45 2015 UTC,That last drive where he tried to get fouled and obviously didn't on an important possession just made me sad.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,c_rizzle53,6,Thu May 21 03:45:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I dont understand why Teague and Dennis just stopped driving the second half. Kyrie and Delly for the most part got eaten by them the first half.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,KickedInTheDonuts,3,Thu May 21 03:55:48 2015 UTC,That about sums it up
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,_the_Tree_,2,Thu May 21 03:39:10 2015 UTC,"as a cavs fan, I really hope Demarre is ok for game 2... it's a sprain so it doesn't sound good... but this series would suck with more injuries to blame"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,jwfutbol,3,Thu May 21 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Bazemore really impressed me. Teague was lighting our guards up the first half. Tristan and JR really made a difference for us. Sorry about Demarre... Sucks having that happen anytime, let alone the playoffs."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Penguana7,40,Thu May 21 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"Hawks can say 'Oh well we would have won if Jr didn't catch fire, he won't shoot like that the rest of the series.' Thats what bulls fans said during our series except it was Delladova, or james jones, or shumpet, or mozgov. Point is, Lebron makes everyone single player around him better, he sets an example for the team and they follow him. So you have to expect a different role player stepping up each night because that's whats gonna happen. Best of luck, get better demarre"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,lnternational,19,Thu May 21 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"Its Dellavedova, damn it... I'll show myself out"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,cwolfe,5,Thu May 21 09:51:47 2015 UTC,"Tru Dat. Someone is going to step up and JR wasn't getting the respect he deserved on this board IMO. Cavs look very vulnerable especially when LeBron goes iso on every play in the 4th but nothing matters if you don't hit your shots. We didn't hit our shots. Someone is going to run on every night. JR, Shump, Delly, LeBron, Kyrie. We can take that (and did) but if you can't make shots you're gonna lose. Can't shoot 24% from 3 when the opposition is shooting 40%."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,LemonStealer,16,Thu May 21 13:40:23 2015 UTC,I'm so sad right now. I want to die. Why is all of the alcohol gone.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,uckTheSaints,17,Thu May 21 03:32:29 2015 UTC,"We need to hit some threes really bad. I however still trust in the supernatural powers of the Cleveland Sports Curse, I believe it is much stronger than the Atlanta Sports Curse."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,KickedInTheDonuts,15,Thu May 21 03:35:13 2015 UTC,Antic and Schröder were garbage at times
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,nouvellediscotheque,20,Thu May 21 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"Schröder   Hero ball bullshit from him all playoffs. Someone gets the reb, passes to Shröder, he goes down and lobs up a brick within 5 seconds. I've seen it countless times."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ksunole,5,Thu May 21 03:44:47 2015 UTC,Antic is trash. Schroder is effective only when driving. His maturity level has to increase. He kills the offensive flow when he decides to take jump shots.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,watsyurface,-1,Thu May 21 03:56:18 2015 UTC,Even when he drives he just misses.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ksunole,1 point,Thu May 21 04:18:27 2015 UTC,"He did okay driving the ball last night. I feel like Teague and Schroder can drive at will on this team, which is what we need to do. If they start settling for jump shots we are in trouble."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,rimmyrim,6,Thu May 21 13:49:51 2015 UTC,JR was the difference in this game.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,cwolfe,2,Thu May 21 03:39:36 2015 UTC,That shit was getting ridiculous. Channeling his inner regular season Korver.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,rimmyrim,1 point,Thu May 21 13:00:27 2015 UTC,Not hitting shots was the difference in this game. JR got his. Someone else will get theirs on Friday but we can't win if we don't score

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,hoochiscrazy123,6,Thu May 21 12:04:29 2015 UTC,Get well soon Demarre
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Imglenwesley,4,Thu May 21 03:32:06 2015 UTC,It's kinda crazy to even be here because a bunch of shit has gone wrong
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ksunole,4,Thu May 21 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"I just went through my mourning state and wanted to punch something....then realized I needed to find he silver linings in this game...had JR shot normal and, well, made 4 or 5 of his 3s instead of EIGHT, hawks very well could've won this one. And if Teague could've hit a few of hose jumpers down the stretch. I may be in the minority but I think bazemore can fill the void of Carroll...Carroll is an above average defender, but James was working him tonight. Bazemore has the athleticism to match anyone, I'm just hoping that he can harness that into matching against James defensively.   I may just be reaching here but I am not as worried as I was early during that 4th quarter. I mean, the Cavs are without Love and for the most part Irving. Would I give up Carroll for Love and Irving? I'm afraid I would. (Again just trying to find positives!) In my opinion, the Hawks as a unit are better than the Cavs as a unit at this moment. Keep the optimism guys, I know I am"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,trafewsan,3,Thu May 21 03:46:41 2015 UTC,"I love me some Baze, but James will own him in the paint. He's giving up way too much size. I think Milsap is stuck guarding him in game 2."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ksunole,2,Thu May 21 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Paul was thrown in the fire tonight, and despite the rantings of Reggie Miller, did a decent job.  Maybe with a day to prepare he can slow down James even more."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Imglenwesley,1 point,Thu May 21 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"I think what Reggie was getting at was proven on that easy dunk. Guard him closer to the basket and maybe he will settle for jump shots. Paul is giving up more speed than size (though James is huge), playing him that far out plays into James speed advantage. I think we see Baze guard JR Smith (JR actually missed the couple of times Baze was on him and got blocked). Kent's length and athleticism causes issues for shooters."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ksunole,1 point,Thu May 21 13:41:34 2015 UTC,"I think so too, but James would own anyone in the paint. I guess what I'm trying to convince myself to be true is that the drop-off between Carroll's play and  Bazemore's ""potential"" play isn't as great as I previously thought. We all saw the play the second unit had against the Wiz - are they THAT good? Or does hustle and high-energy play fill the gap? Before today's game JYD was averaging 17 I believe in playoffs, which is great, but his value(in my opinion) comes via defense which isn't quite as hard to fill as say, if Sap was injured and a scorer needed to be replaced"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,c_rizzle53,2,Thu May 21 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"Pero shouldn't sniff the floor. He's a waste of minutes and brings nothing to the table. I believe they have him out there to try to bring their bigs away from the basket, but Pero hasn't hit a three in forever so they are just going to let him shoot. Moose, Baze and Scott should get huge minutes coming up."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,santa_91,3,Thu May 21 13:43:25 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with this. I think a Bazemore/Scott combo would be enough to slow Lebron down. But really I think we should just let Lebron get his and stop everyone else. Lebron can get 60 but if the other 4 and the bench cant get the 40+ they need to win, we got this."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,syxx242000,5,Thu May 21 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this won't be a popular opinion but I thought Bud got outcoached by LeBron tonight. Our halftime adjustments were total shit. They couldn't stay in front of Jeff or Dennis, so lets just throw up a bunch of mid range jumpers with  no one anywhere near the basket to grab a rebound."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,KickedInTheDonuts,7,Thu May 21 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"Remember when Shelvin Mack and Mike Scott destroyed the Pacers in the playoffs last year IN their building? The Hawks threw up brick after brick in the 2nd half. It's crazy that they never even breathed on the ball all game. Unbelievable. But maybe with Demarre gone Bud will realize that this team is still capable of scoring OVER 100 points if everyone is utilized and clicking. Korver has been a one-trick pony for most of his career yet his D is solid, but currently he's been as close to useless and Scott and Mack have been on the bench."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,syxx242000,2,Thu May 21 03:31:32 2015 UTC,"To me, Korver's defense isn't all that tbh"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,nouvellediscotheque,11,Thu May 21 03:37:21 2015 UTC,He definitely gets exposed 1 on 1 but he's smart and plays good team D by rotating and doing the fundamental things a lot of players don't.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,LemonStealer,3,Thu May 21 03:40:45 2015 UTC,"I think he's often in the mix and even if he doesn't get the steal or block, someone else does because he's causing a more difficult situation for the opposing players. Just something I've noticed."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Tundraaa,1 point,Thu May 21 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"Korvers D is not solid. Mine is when he sinks a bucket, but that's just about it."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Im_just_a_lamp,1 point,Thu May 21 03:40:41 2015 UTC,Korver was pretty bad for us in the playoffs too.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,cwolfe,4,Thu May 21 03:34:33 2015 UTC,"This game was so winnable for us that it actually gave me a headache after the final buzzer. I know I'm  playing the ""what if"" game with my thoughts but it took us missing basically 20 3s and a career performance from J.R. to beat us, IMO, because I've always thought that Lebron was going to get his. This is weird for me but I also think I'm all for playing Moose over Antic simply because I think he's a better rebounder and can play D good enough because let's face it Mozgov and TT aren't exactly offensive forces. I did like seeing Teague be more aggressive overall. I also liked how our D did with the exception of J.R. going aim bot level of shooting and that last play where there was no help to be seen. I really hope Demarre is alright (and would be ecstatic if he could come back this series). I'm upset right now but looking back on some these factors I can see us getting this series back. I just hope this series doesn't break my heart.....or my liver"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Im_just_a_lamp,1 point,Thu May 21 04:19:27 2015 UTC,I don't see us taking this series. Not because we can't but because we have shown an inability to make the adjustments stick. It was clear in the first half we could win but when we stop playing our ball we seem to be unwilling or unable to start again. We descend into iso play in the fourth quarter and lazy passes around the perimeter. This is our 3rd series in a row of struggling with this but  the Cavs are too deep and strong for us to get away with it.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,cwolfe,1 point,Thu May 21 16:25:29 2015 UTC,"I understand your view but I don't completely agree. The part that I don't agree with the most is that the Cavs are too deep and strong for us and that is because the only guys that get considerable amount of time off their bench is J.R. and Delly and I think our bench can at least match those two over the series as long as there aren't anymore career games off the bench like J.R. had last night. To address the lack of ball movement is something I agree with you on in regards to that the offense isn't anywhere near the same without it but I think that's more along the lines of something Bud, who probably already has, or the players to notice and keep with it"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,rloch,1 point,Thu May 21 21:52:38 2015 UTC,I know we could I just haven't seen us do it. The pattern has played out over and over again. I wonder if Bud Ball just needs another season with our guys to become second nature. They just revert to slow isolation ball and passing around the perimeter or lazy three attempts early in the shot clock. We're better than that we just forget and bud can't seem to wake them up when it happens. The Cavs aren't deeper. They just perform consistently which we haven't.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,TaTaToothey,1 point,Thu May 21 23:11:43 2015 UTC,I could not agree more. I hate the loss but still believe that we will take this series.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,ssovm,4,Thu May 21 07:23:21 2015 UTC,We had about a 9 point lead and the refs called 3 offensive fouls on us that were terrible (one was when Paul took a T) and that seemed to really change the game.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Shade_Raven,6,Thu May 21 12:39:56 2015 UTC,We'll get revenge on Friday guys! Caw caw!!!!!!
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,kcarter80,2,Thu May 21 03:37:49 2015 UTC,We got shit on at home. I fear for happens in cleveland
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Dizzydsmith,9,Thu May 21 12:52:54 2015 UTC,Reasons for optimism:  Hawks won't go 4-23 from 3.  Irving looks like he is going to be a non-factor.  Teague and Schöder seem strong.  Coach Bud said the doctors are cautiously optimistic is may be a sprain instead of a tear in the post game press conference.  Hawks stayed strong through some serious adversity.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Tenken8,25,Thu May 21 03:50:36 2015 UTC,"Refs killed the momentum in this game. I try not to complain about officiating, but the NBA is far and away the most biased officiating out of the big 4. It's going to be an uphill battle."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,cme9,-33,Thu May 21 03:35:23 2015 UTC,What are you guys bitching about? You guys were getting every bullshit call the first 3 quarters. Kyrie and LeBron were getting clobbered in the paint with no calls. Teague hooks Delly on that fastbreak and they called a foul on Delly.   So stop bitching about officiating because it favored your team this game. Worry about JR and LeBron... Not refs
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,MistaB784,13,Thu May 21 04:09:01 2015 UTC,Why are you coming into a losing teams sub just to antagonize? What is the purpose of doing that? Do you enjoy it?
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Tenken8,3,Thu May 21 05:59:41 2015 UTC,"LOL genuinely laughing at the ""do you enjoy it"". Dunno why that part made me crack up."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,MistaB784,-2,Thu May 21 11:29:40 2015 UTC,I don't enjoy when losing teams blame the game on refs instead of their own team losing it. Did the refs hell JR Smith make all those 3s??? Fucking sore losers
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,peeinherbut,20,Thu May 21 15:27:38 2015 UTC,Did we watch the same game?
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,SpankThatDill,5,Thu May 21 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? Lebron gets away with nearly every push-off, and when you graze his jersey, they call a foul. There was one moment where we got 5 points erased from 2 consecutive possessions for awful calls on Korver and Millsap. They definitely killed the momentum of the game. Many things went wrong, I'm not singling out the refs, but they definitely didn't help the situation."

You have JR Smith catching fire like he does all the time... and then you have two big men down low hustling their asses off, grabbing rebounds, etc.  I don't think that overall we played the worst game we've ever played. Certainly not our best -- especially from 3 -- but not awful."

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,FL14,17,Thu May 21 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"How many times did the broadcasters absolutely shit on Millsap for his defense on LeBron?  Yet by my count, LeBron was 1/5 from the field after Carroll left the game.  But no, the commentators talk about how LeBron is too good for Millsap to defend that high up the court."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,iCandid,16,Thu May 21 03:47:35 2015 UTC,Yeah that's definitely true about Millsap.  I thought he was doing alright D on LeBron.  But I think that was just Reggie Miller being an idiot.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,KingJames006,5,Thu May 21 03:53:31 2015 UTC,Reggie Miller's an idiot.  This is the same guy that moaned about the over and back not being called on the Cavs because he doesn't know the rules.  He just likes hearing his own voice.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,CLSmith15,2,Thu May 21 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"He made the shot where he stopped in the middle of the paint, he made the fadeaway one leg shot, and then the final play for the blow by dunk. All guarded by Milsap, I thought he did a good job too but let's be fair"
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Dizzydsmith,-1,Thu May 21 13:14:45 2015 UTC,"The first two were before Carroll left which is why I missed them.  Not saying Millsap is capable of completely shutting LeBron down, but he can hold his own."

And let's be honest, those Cleveland hating articles stopped as soon as lebron went back."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,Dizzydsmith,13,Thu May 21 14:12:21 2015 UTC,media up LeBron's ass is very different from them being up Cleveland's ass like the above post said.  That's what I was responding too.  We still have to deal with a montage of Cleveland Sports Heartbreak (1995 fists raised) in the pre-game of every sporting event.
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,TCBinaflash,-3,Thu May 21 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but being up lebrons ass is one in the same. The media still wants lebron in he finals, thus Cleveland in the finals. The NBA still wants lebron in the finals, thus Cleveland in the finals."

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,draycon530,10,Thu May 21 17:22:19 2015 UTC,I agree but I think apart from the offensive fouls I believe the refereeing was pretty even each way. There will never be a perfectly refereed game
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,goamateur,2,Thu May 21 03:46:53 2015 UTC,"But it was the offensive fouls that destroyed our momentum in the 3rd. We were doing alright, and then they started calling illegal screens and the Cavs stole the momentum."

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,BillionaireBob,4,Thu May 21 11:33:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to blame the refs, we didn't deserve to win considering how poorly we shot, and how well JR and LeBron played.  However the refs certainly didn't help.  I felt like LeBron and Thompson got away with a LOT underneath the basket.  I felt like the refs generally called ticky tack fouls on us (like all those illegal screens) and did not call them on Cleveland.  And worst of all, they completely killed off our momentum from a late 13-1 run by taking like 5 minutes to review a call that was made correctly to begin with."
AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,CLSmith15,2,Thu May 21 03:34:23 2015 UTC,Think though. They were momentum killing fouls/turnovers. Perfectly timed. Just sayin'

You see a questionable call against the Hawks and it's easy to remember because it annoyed you. You seed a questionable call against the Cavs and you forget about it a possession later because it left no lasting impact on you.  The Hawks last, and that's it. The Cavs scored like 1 point during a six minute stretch. The refs didn't make the Hawks shoot like 4-24 from three. It is what it is."

AtlantaHawks,36pqf5,1982mike1,-12,Thu May 21 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to rant. I need to rant. I dont care how badly you people hate me because I say shit you dont like, but i need to rant so fucking deal with it  I had the Cavs in 6 before this thing started but I actually had a lot of hope and slight slimmers of optimism that we could pull this series out of our ass, without Carroll I am 90% sure we are getting swept now. I want to rant on why. And before i get into it, I want to add some proof as to how much of a drop off it is without DC on the floor:  @ESPNStatsInfo The Hawks' offense has been over 12 points per 100 possessions better this postseason with DeMarre Carroll on the court this postseason   Kent Bazemore is just not a good offensive basketball player. He's shooting 21% from 3 in the playoffs and hes not really reliable enough putting the ball on the ground to get off his own shot. We've all seen him dribble, anytime a defender comes up and pressures him he loses the ball pretty much right away. Hes a great hustle player and a good defender but for a team whose offense has been, overall, an abortion throughout the playoffs Bazemore just absolutely 100% isnt the guy capable of replacing Carroll Kyle Korver is fucking garbage. Im sure this one comment will piss people off but I dont care. I remember having a conversation a long time ago with a friend telling him I've never understood why teams have trouble with Korver because hes completely 100% inept at dribbling and why so many teams sag off him to double someone else is beyond me. I said I would just keep a body on Korver all the time. Never sag, never leave him, ever. Go over all your screens and you'll hold Korver to a few points a game and render him completely irrelevant on offense. The wizards realized how one dimensional korver is and they never ever took a body off him, Cavs copied that tonight and Korver was still mostly irrelevant on offense and nearly fell over trying to defend Shumpart and Smith on multiple occasions. I realize we have to play him just because of the threat that maybe someone from the Cavs will slack off and Korver will find room to get off a shot, but based off what i saw in the wizards series and this one game ive come to the full realization that korver is really just a 5 PPG guy the rest of the way through the playoffs. Antic fucking blows Antic fucking blows X 10 Moose needs to take all of Antics minutes. This wont happen, but he should. What the fuck happened to Mike Scott? If you told me 3 months ago that we lose DC to a bad injury late in the playoffs I would have replied with ""well that would suck but at least Korver is reliable and Mike Scott is a solid 6th man"". Neither of these are true now. Korver is shit and without looking it up I feel like the last time Mike Scott played a second was in game 1 or 2 vs the wizards.  Jeff Teague is infuriating to watch play basketball. This guy goes off for 17 in one half and then plays lazy garbage ball the entirety of the 2nd half. I dont know of another player who rotates between insanely average PG to top 10 level like teague does. Westbrook plays at 100%, 100% of the time. Teague plays at 100%  half the game, maybe, if we're lucky. Frankly the more I watch Teague the more I hope to god we never extend his ass in 2 years and we either trade him or just flat out dont waste our time trying to resign him. Fuck giving this guy top 10 PG money. I really truly do not like Jeff Teague.  Why the fuck is Paul Millsap guarding LeBron James at the 3 point line? Millsap isnt a good defending 4 as it is, hes not even a average shot blocker and hes an awful rebounder (im ranting), while he might win a few battles with LeBron the reality is the moment LeBron gets Millsaps hips turned its lights out. See the play with 40 seconds left in the game. I know Baze is significantly lighter than James but at least Bazemore can jump through the roof and turn and run with LeBron step for step. Im obviously not the coach of the year, but im not sure that putting Millsap on LeBron is quite the good idea mr bud   I know a lot of people will find some sliver of hope in the run at the end after being down by 20 or so but for me? Thats mostly a Cavs problem with their offense going into complete iso mode. I dont see a truly realistic way the Hawks can win vs the Cavs right now. I know, I know, there is no way in hell Smith shoots this hot from 3 again, but our D was just above average WITH DC playing, now without him? Christ almighty. LeBron will average close to 30 a game vs us, we cant guard him. For Atlanta to win, I really think Teague/Horford/Millsap ALL have to average 20 a game. With how awful Korver is and how unreliable Bazemore is, im looking at a realistic scenario where the scoring breakdown to win is:  Teague: 20 Horford: 20  Millsap: 20 Korver: 5 Bazemore: 8 Dennis: 10 Antic: 4 Moose:  5   Even in this attempt at being realistic but not really realistic scenario we still need an outlier game from someone like bazemore or korver or our D to be all world.   Losing DC sucks. Sports suck. I hate that this is just another Atlanta pro sports team, like 2012 Falcons or insertanyBravesteam where our conversation will be ""remember that REGULAR season?""  Im tired of this shit. Ive been a Hawks fan since I moved to the city from Houston when I was 6 years old so you can suck my dick with the impending ""go root for someone else"" garbage. I'm like a battered house wife.   I also forgot to mention, Fuck the nets for getting to the playoffs. I dont know how the fuck won 60 games but as I watch us play in the playoffs I realize we desperately needed an infusion of lotto caliber talent.   Fuck sports."

In fact when you watch the replay, you can see the injury happen when LeBron is still a good 5 feet away. He only ran into him because the guy stopped running (obviously, since he hurt his knee) and even then you can tell LeBron is doing his best to pull up and not run into him full force.  And he wasn't apologizing. He was giving your player encouragement because as he said in the post game interview, ""we are all brothers""."

I just went through my mourning state and wanted to punch something....then realized I needed to find he silver linings in this game...had JR shot normal and, well, made 4 or 5 of his 3s instead of EIGHT, hawks very well could've won this one. And if Teague could've hit a few of hose jumpers down the stretch. I may be in the minority but I think bazemore can fill the void of Carroll...Carroll is an above average defender, but James was working him tonight. Bazemore has the athleticism to match anyone, I'm just hoping that he can harness that into matching against James defensively.   I may just be reaching here but I am not as worried as I was early during that 4th quarter. I mean, the Cavs are without Love and for the most part Irving. Would I give up Carroll for Love and Irving? I'm afraid I would. (Again just trying to find positives!) In my opinion, the Hawks as a unit are better than the Cavs as a unit at this moment. Keep the optimism guys, I know I am   Edit: I also think Friday will decide who wins the series. I Hawks win Friday I see a series win - meaning Baze fills in and the offense clicks 100% instead of about 75-78% like tonight. I don't think Bud is far off from figuring it out...in Bud I trust."

AtlantaHawks,36nn92,drrhythm2,5,Wed May 20 22:22:17 2015 UTC,That's a good point.
AtlantaHawks,36nn92,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,9,Wed May 20 22:40:59 2015 UTC,It's also interesting to note that LeBron James is 0-8 in game one of playoff series on the road.

AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,schwertfeger,3,Wed May 20 17:03:30 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on how much trauma your mouth experiences during the removal.
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,ATL_GritzBlitz,4,Wed May 20 18:18:29 2015 UTC,See if you can get your hands on some alcoholic ice cream.  Or make jello shots

AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,tabelz,10,Wed May 20 15:46:51 2015 UTC,We win the NBA Finals. Falcons make a huge run to the Super Bowl. Georgia and Georgia Tech make both conference championship games. Book it.
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,ichinii,3,Wed May 20 18:51:10 2015 UTC,That is one thing new with the CFB Playoffs. I find myself rooting more for UGA because how fucking sweet would a post Jan 1 game be between the two?
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,Hugo_5t1gl1tz,2,Wed May 20 18:55:20 2015 UTC,B-b-but what about the Braves?

Also, you guys were one of the coolest fan bases /r/clevelandcavaliers has interacted with this season, so I'm glad it's you guys in these finals with us. Here's to a competitive series void of attempts to rip off arms. Respectfully, Go Cavs!"
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,PierdolePierogi,9,Wed May 20 15:52:48 2015 UTC,"With all respect, (Samuel L Jackson Voice): I have HAD IT with these motherfucking cavs in this motherfucking thread. LETS FUCKING GO HAWKS."

AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,MTT92,7,Wed May 20 21:24:04 2015 UTC,Hawks about to stun the Cavs tonight. Strap in boys because this is going to be one hell of a game. Can't wait to see the shame on LeBron's face when Demarre makes him go 3-15 again. Im confident that my boy Korver is ready to set the net on fire this series.
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,AlconTheFalcon,24,Wed May 20 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"So many Cavs up in here, it's like Phillips Arena back in 09."

AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,tyler9090,16,Wed May 20 16:03:14 2015 UTC,We'll only hate you until the series is over. Unless you win of course. Then it will be long standing bitterness. Until we beat you guys next season.
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,PickShark,12,Wed May 20 16:12:43 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling if we lose to you guys, our bitterness will still be pointed at Boston and Olynyk"
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,tyler9090,11,Wed May 20 16:31:14 2015 UTC,which is fair. because the biggest reason why I think us Hawks will win is because there's no Love to worry about. I'd be much more worried about losing with him on the court.

AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,Squintz69,4,Wed May 20 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yaaay I am too excited. Even if it's a blowout, sweep, etc. on either side (which it won't be I don't think), at least both franchises are doing well and made it to the ECF. Even if the Cavs absolutely massacre the Hawks, I'll still be super proud of the team and how they got Atlanta excited for something. Who cares about ""bandwagon"" fans, as long as they're passionate then that's all that matters.  I think Hawks win first two because of home court and all that, but Cleveland evens the series up at their court. Then after that, who knows"
AtlantaHawks,36mwhs,spoongrd,3,Wed May 20 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"Who has a ticket and where are you at? 320 row H  I'm donating my vocal chords to the Hawks tonight.  If you don't have a ticket and you're in the A, then get one. We need every fan there to get the factory bumping."

Then having people tell us it's just a gift we've been blessed with. I do motion graphics and have experienced the 'gift' there but the 1 in 200 keeper pics I end up with are one step up from snap shots. 10,000 hours to go I guess. Wonderful Braves stuff as well.

AtlantaHawks,36olx7,phi186,5,Wed May 20 22:18:55 2015 UTC,"Jeff Teague is the point guard, the main ball handler. Dennis Schroder is his backup. They'll be matched up against Kyrie Irving and his backup Matthew Dellavedova (also known as Outback Jesus).  Kyle Korver is the shooting guard, he's a great shooter. He'll match up against some combination of Iman Shumpert and Jr Smith.  Demarre Carroll is the Small Forward. He's going to be matched up against Lebron. This is the matchup to watch for in the series.  The Hawks two big men are Paul Millsap (Power Forward) and Al Horford (Center). They are matched up against Tristan Thompson and Timofey Mozgov, respectively. You'll see them in the paint a lot (just under the basket), trying to make layups or grab rebounds. They are really good at stretching the floor though, so they can take deeper shots as well."

I know it's hard to retain a TON of information in these last minute situations so I figured just sticking to the basics would be helpful. All that matters is that you have a basic idea of what's going on, cheer your team on and enjoy your date. Hope it goes well! Have fun tonight."

AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,xshare,3,Wed May 20 15:59:25 2015 UTC,Used it plenty of times. Always a great deal and sometimes you even get great seats!
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,ItalianKick,2,Wed May 20 16:29:45 2015 UTC,I just used them this morning for the first time. So you are saying that there is a small chance that these tickets wont be the worst possible seats at Phillips?
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,xshare,3,Wed May 20 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. There is. Last time I got my friend on it (game 2 vs Wiz), I got my tix first and got 300 baseline row Q and he got 200s baseline row E. Wished I had never told him about it ;)"

AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,spicedmeats,1 point,Wed May 20 21:27:15 2015 UTC,Nice have you ever purchased any of the upgrades? Mine is 314 which I'm definitely fine with esp for $40 but would be pretty sweet to move closer.
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,xshare,2,Wed May 20 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"It definitely would be. The upgrades are great and usually pretty cheap, especially with a baseline price of $40 for where your seats are now.  The upgrades are good but be careful, don't get a ""200s"" upgrade to any row past like E, maybe F (not sure about F). Those high 200s rows are awful, that overhang makes it so you can't even see the scoreboard and the angle is such that if people stand you can't see the court even if you stand."

AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,xshare,3,Wed May 20 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"With so many of us getting it the odds are that the seats won't be so great, but for $30 to see the ECF who cares."

No way can most Athenians  pay that. That high a price your always restricting what  group of people you want to go to the game.
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,daddylikedat,3,Wed May 20 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Not even being a dick/I graduated last year, but I really don't think  that the hawks owners care about whether college kids can afford to go to the games."

AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,cwolfe,2,Wed May 20 19:41:47 2015 UTC,They just released these tickets. I've been watching the tickets and they were not available until earlier today. I'm also amazed at the prices they're charging. Ridiculous. I received my PO tickets a couple of weeks ago and they had face values printed on them doubling with each series but what is being charged at Ticketmaster is double that value. Unbelievable.  Edit: Checked prices at the Roaracle and our tickets are cheap relative to them. Go figure
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,Big_Balled_Hawks,2,Wed May 20 14:42:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I was actually mad when I saw what they were asking for face value tickets.  Wayyyy to high
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,sickBird,2,Wed May 20 14:24:23 2015 UTC,"Part of me wants the Phillips to have poor attendance tonight. $100 bucks for 400s tix is a little insane, granted this could be the norm in most ECF games"

AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,xshare,7,Wed May 20 15:31:56 2015 UTC,This is an ignorant comment.
AtlantaHawks,36mk3r,jperez3209,2,Wed May 20 15:38:05 2015 UTC,"I think the point he's making is valid. I'm a huge hawks fan and I paid for the tickets at full-price (wish I had waited) thinking they would only sell out and go up in price after that. In other cities (including Cleveland, Houston -- not just bigger cities than Atlanta with higher cost-of-living), our face-value prices are normal/cheap and they're selling all of them easy in other cities. The values we're seeing in the secondary market are crazy-cheap compared to what you'd pay in any other playoff city left. And that's just supply & demand -- our demand isn't as high.   It sucks, and I hate it, and I absolutely love our fans -- we're passionate and I know we're all big Hawks fans here... but the city as a whole doesn't support the team like other cities do. And that's a fact."

Otherwise you just kinda feel disconnected from the action. The company my father works for used to have a box in the early - mid 2000s  and nobody would ever use the tickets so we would get free ones to Thrashers and Hawks games when I was growing up.

AtlantaHawks,36k7dy,mrgiantnutpain2,2,Wed May 20 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"They'll drop. If I hadn't had someone buy me tickets, I'd go sit at the FedEx and buy tickets at tipoff on StubHub and print them there. Tickets drop really low. Game 1 vs. Nets was down to $3 a ticket at tipoff. They won't drop that low but I bet someone gets in for $20."

AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,LosingMyEdge7,5,Tue May 19 17:36:51 2015 UTC,Strongly disagree. Browns fans have to believe and have faith in something they haven't seen for twenty some years. All a Cavs fan need do is witness.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,moodyfloyd,26,Tue May 19 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"cavs in 6 if kyrie can power through with no additional setbacks. reason: blind faith.  if we lose kyrie for extended time, hawks in 7."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,GhostdadUC,14,Tue May 19 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going back and forth between Cavs in 6 and Hawks in 7.  I think the winner of game 6 will ultimately win the series as in the Cavs are going to either close it out or the Hawks will then win game 7 at home.  The fan in me has to choose Cavs in 6.  A few reasons for me feeling this way.  Hawks have looked very beatable throughout the playoffs and through the later parts of the regular season.  I do not think that the Wizards are a good team at all and the fact that so many of the games came down to the very end makes me feel very positive about this series.  Roleplayers have been stepping up for the Cavs.  Shump, JR, TT and even Delly have all been amazing these playoffs.  I'm going to say it now.  Tristan Thompson is going to win this series for the Cavaliers.  The Hawks were one of the leagues worst rebounding teams this year due to their lack of size in favor of speed.  In order to stop TT the Hawks are going to need to double and even triple team him on boxouts leaving lanes open for other players to grab boards.  With Atlanta needing to commit so many bodies to boxing out it is going to slow the pace of the game down and cut down on their fast break opportunities which favors the Cavaliers.  I am really worried about this series and the Hawks are definitely going to be the biggest threat we have faced thus far.  I just feel that after the slugfest that the Bulls series was this team is going to be ready for this series.  All of our players really stepped up.  All of this is dependent on Kyrie's health of course."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,6,Tue May 19 17:36:14 2015 UTC,Really depends on which Hawks show up. If January Hawks show up we're in good shape. JR is scary and Shump is great on D but I think too much is left on James shoulders. He showed (by necessity) some of the old do it all himself James against the Bulls and it left the Cavs looking thin and light. However if the slower moving Hawks of the Nets series show up then Cavs in 5 and I'm still proud of my boys. They done good.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,buckeyegold,6,Tue May 19 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Cavs in 6, maybe 5. Just a gut feeling, don't have a specific reason outside of my own optimism."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cahill48,7,Tue May 19 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"I think/hope it will be Cavs in six.  I think Kyrie/Shump will be in much better health after almost a week off, and that TT/Mozgov will be terrors in the paint protecting the rim, and rebounding (especially offensively).  And, ummm we do have LeBron James :)  That being said, when you all get your offense going, you can honestly be unbeatable.    I am hoping for a good series.  Good luck brothers!"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,ChessClubChamp,4,Tue May 19 17:32:37 2015 UTC,If Kyrie and LBJ are healthy and find their shot? Cavs in 6. If not? Hawks in 7.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,redditor4258,0,Tue May 19 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"Cavs in 5 if we are able to steal game one otherwise cavs in 6. Hawks have no answer for Mosgov a healthy Irving and LeBron and Delly, Shump, Smith, and Thompson will all hold their own in their match ups."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,killjoyous,21,Tue May 19 17:34:40 2015 UTC,Mozgov is definitely not the matchup I'm worried about haha
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,redditor4258,4,Tue May 19 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"The only reason I mentioned him is cause you have no big bigs. He probably wont play a whole lot but when he is in floor spacing and down post will be a challenge, but yes of the three he is the least dangerous."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,killjoyous,17,Tue May 19 17:56:19 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm more worried about Tristan Thompson.  He gobbles up offensive rebounds and that's one of our biggest weaknesses.  I foresee a lot of second chance points for him/the Cavs
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,redditnewbie987,6,Tue May 19 18:00:40 2015 UTC,Mozzy also does a really good job at tipping out the ball on the offensive glass. Watch our last game with the Bulls when we got 53 boards. Mozzy kept getting us second-chance points by tipping it out.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,fuzzyllama1,5,Tue May 19 18:52:40 2015 UTC,Pullin the old Tyson Chandler knock the ball to the 3pt line and hope a guard picks it up
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,BMC4,6,Tue May 19 19:36:33 2015 UTC,Especially with your bigs being a bit undersized. TT can have a monster series
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,dogshenanigans,9,Tue May 19 19:33:35 2015 UTC,"But our bigs can shoot long jumpers, so him and mosgod will have to either commit to contest those, or commit to rebounding. The whole 'we have bigs the hawks can't handle' thing tends to end up in our favor for this reason."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,BMC4,6,Tue May 19 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"Also, the Bulls have bigs that stay out of the paint (Gasol, Noah) and TT and Mozgov still could get boards"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,dogshenanigans,5,Tue May 19 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"Gasol and Noah can't hit long jumpers, not a great comparison."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,LosingMyEdge7,8,Tue May 19 20:11:52 2015 UTC,Gasol can most definitely hit long jumpers and often does when he's healthy. Granted idk that long jumpers that aren't threes are that valuable from an analytic standpoint.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,BMC4,3,Tue May 19 20:34:51 2015 UTC,But on the offensive end it'll be an issue for you guys
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,dogshenanigans,6,Tue May 19 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been all season. But by all means, if you wanna get the ball out of your playmakers hands to feed Thompson and mosgov be my guest. The only real concern big-wise is yalls offensive rebounding."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,BMC4,6,Tue May 19 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by offensive end, sorry, should have made that more clear. The offense goes through LeBron and our guards at all times but TT and Mozgov have the rebounding potential"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cripplercrawlspace,4,Tue May 19 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of people just associate Pero as being soft because of his 3pt game, but dude is a great low post defender and he actually outweighs Mozgov by 10lbs."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,atomsej,4,Tue May 19 19:20:47 2015 UTC,Our bigs spread the floor out so Mozgov is going to be the one who will be playing outside of his comfort zone.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,3,Tue May 19 19:28:46 2015 UTC,Mozgov isn't scary. Lopez was scary but we can take the low post points if we don't let it turn JR and Kyrie loose on the perimeter. Gortat and Nene should have been a lot scarier than Mozgov but we bottled them up nicely. A lot was said about them playing poorly but they had some help on that. Mozgov can get his 10 ppg against us. Delly and his Aussie leg lock is frightening. JR getting free on the perimeter when he is in the mood. That's scary. LeBron stacking up the fouls when he brings it inside is very scary. Shump and his terrific D is scary. Mozgov is just another big body and not the worst we've seen.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Stowcenter93,2,Tue May 19 22:04:07 2015 UTC,"Cavs in 4 cause I'm cocky as fuck.  Also, the Browns are next years Super Bowl champs."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,killjoyous,24,Tue May 19 22:57:30 2015 UTC,"Al Horford's jump shot is going to be extremely important in this matchup.  If he starts hitting his jumpers, Mozgov will have to leave the paint to contest them.  That opens up the lane for Teague to drive or for Horford to take it to the rim himself."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,redditnewbie987,14,Tue May 19 17:47:38 2015 UTC,Exactly. We will have to play some small ball with TT at the 5 if Al is hitting his jump-shot. Mozzy is too slow to recover and doesn't switch well.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Raydioactive,20,Tue May 19 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"I think Kevin Love being out is going to be a much bigger deal than some people are thinking. If you go back to the last game the teams played against one another, you will notice the Hawks trapped Kyrie hard on ball screens which took away the roll man. This worked really well until Blatt made an excellent adjustment and used Love as the screen setter and had him pop out for a very open 3.   I'm curious how the Cavs counter that hard trap now. They don't really have any other solid screen setters who can also shoot. Lebron is off from deep currently and Kyrie is hobbled making those traps even more difficult to traverse.  Also who guards Korver like Beal did? Shump could but that takes him off Teague who generally blows by Delly, Irving, and Smith. Of course that depends on his ankle which looked better in game 6.  A Lebron-Kyrie PnR could be countered if we guard Bron with Millsap and Kyrie with Carroll but that may be unsustainable. Honestly my biggest worry is the rebounding. For us to win the series we have got to team rebound against Thompson and Mozgov.  I'm calling Hawks in 6 cause I can't pick against us and a game 7 might actually kill me."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,throwaway1232141513,6,Tue May 19 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"TT's a beast on the boards. He also almost always kicks it out and then the ball gets passed to a wide open three. We have a lot of perimeter shooters, and if they get hot, Lebron and Kyrie will find them and get them open."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,fuzzyllama1,7,Tue May 19 18:02:00 2015 UTC,Wow that's a really good point about KLove and them having no pop man. I didn't even think about that.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Raydioactive,5,Tue May 19 19:40:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I haven't heard a ton about that. It obviously isn't the end all solution for the Hawks but it was the Cavs first counter to our defense. It will be interesting to see how effective their new strategy is.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Sartuk,5,Tue May 19 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"Love being out's huge.  I love you HawkBros, but I think this was going to be a relatively easy series with Love around.  The Hawks haven't been the same Hawks that started 40-8, and the Cavaliers were really rolling going into the post-season.  My guess would have been Cavs in 5, and I don't mean that as any disrespect to you dudes: I just think a totally healthy Cavs team was pretty clearly the team to beat in the East.  Now?  This is basically a toss-up.  The loss of Thabo might be exactly what gives the series to the Cavaliers, honestly.  Offensively, LeBron really struggled against Chicago (and to be fair, his incredibly high usage with poor scoring efficiency was how he played in the regular season whenever Love sat, so to expect this to change with no Love against the Hawks is iffy).  Kyrie's offense will likely be alright, but Kyrie defensively against Teague absolutely mortifies me.  I could see Teague and Korver absolutely tearing us apart.  Shump's a wonderful on-ball defender, but he's ""meh"" off-ball, and that's where a lot of the work on Korver has to be.  Honestly?  I'm scared this series.  I think it's going to be a great one.  I'm going to go with Cavs in 6, but Hawks in 6 or 7 wouldn't shock me.  This is going to be a good one, I think!"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Raydioactive,1 point,Wed May 20 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"The series is going to be amazins I think. I will say that the Hawks played very well and beat the Cavs fully healthy, but I will agree that the Cavs kept rolling into the postseason while the Hawks looked like they lost their rhythm from resting too much. The thing I'm most worried about aside from rebounding, is Demarre getting in foul trouble. If he has to be taken out we just don't have a ton of options to defend LeBron for long stretches."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cahill48,17,Wed May 20 11:59:37 2015 UTC,Waddup Hawks bros!!!  Hoping for an awesome series.  Great looking sub btw.  :)
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,ChessClubChamp,15,Tue May 19 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how the media is calling for Cavs in 5... This is going at least 6 games, and I'm not entirely sure our superstars are going to be > the Hawks' team ball...  Regardless, I'm hoping for a fun, competitive, not-heart-breaking series. Good luck everyone!"

AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,tyler9090,10,Tue May 19 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of them are overreacting to our stomping of the Bulls in game 6. I'm cautiously optimistic, but I think it's foolish to think it'll be a one-sided series by any means"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,ChessClubChamp,8,Tue May 19 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"Makes sense - and frankly, I was so worried about Kyrie's health that I completely ignored the point differential of Game 6.  I'm actually still kind of in shock that we made it past the Bulls... which is likely the native Clevelander in me bracing for the worst."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,BMC4,2,Tue May 19 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going Cavs in 5 simply because I think the Hawks and Cavs are trending 2 different ways, and the Cavs create some matchup issues for the Hawks."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Raydioactive,3,Tue May 19 19:35:51 2015 UTC,Matchup issues on one end might not be so favorable on the other. Both rosters have some stuff they can exploit about the other team.

I sincerely hope there won't be too many tasteless and unoriginal civil war jokes.   Completely unrelated: Where does everyone think the top prospects are going in the draft?   I'm kind of hoping Okafor goes to the Wolves at #1 and Russell goes to the Sixers at like #3 or #4. I'm also very interested to see where Mario Henzonja winds up.

AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,TSR3K,8,Tue May 19 18:14:04 2015 UTC,I don't think it so black and white. Korver will get his looks- not as many as the regular season- he just needs to make the open shots that he gets.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,GhostdadUC,7,Tue May 19 19:17:29 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see Delly on Korver.  Delly won't be further than 1 foot away from him at all times.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,0,Tue May 19 19:20:57 2015 UTC,With his legs locked tight around him
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,GhostdadUC,3,Tue May 19 22:07:33 2015 UTC,He was just trying to get up... allegedly
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,0,Tue May 19 22:08:52 2015 UTC,"Crossing your legs around someone else's is a strange way to go about it. The Starters had a great segment on it where Lee, their resident Aussie, talked about what a common school yard move that was in Australia. The other guys chimed in about how he does it around the office as well. Hilarious."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,GhostdadUC,3,Tue May 19 22:23:29 2015 UTC,I mean yeah.  It's very clear that he knew what he was doing.  Either way Gibson deserved everything that he got for how he was playing/acting.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,-1,Tue May 19 22:27:29 2015 UTC,Nope. Sorry. There was no contact on the kick and locking a guy up like that is begging for him to try and shake his leg loose with more force than necessary. Shoulda been a double tech and game on. For him to get tossed was ridiculous and for Delly to get away with nothing was equally ridiculous. That they looked at the review and saw what happened and tossed Taj while doing nothing to Delly is one of the few things I've seen that gives the paranoid ref/league 'fix is in' moaners some real ammunition. That made no sense.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,GhostdadUC,5,Tue May 19 22:32:19 2015 UTC,He was tossed because he needed to be restrained and then shoved JR Smith.  Not just because of the kick.  If he had just kicked himself loose and walked away it would have been over but if you watch the full video 2 Cavs players run in because Taj is literally walking towards Delly and standing over him.  That's a big fucking no no in todays NBA.  I agree that Delly deserved a tech but you're crazy if you think Gibson didn't deserve to get tossed in an already heated series.    It's hilarious because people complain when the refs don't take control of a situation before it gets too heated and then when they take control of a situation in a heated playoff series they get blamed for rigging a series when they toss a player who acted way over the top.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,-1,Tue May 19 22:44:37 2015 UTC,Now you're just making shit up. He received a flagrant 2 for kicking. Nothing else. What the series was up to that point is irrelevant. Flagrant 1 if you want to send a message about kicking motions but ejection? That is the kind of call that makes people think the ref/league has an agenda.
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,GhostdadUC,3,Tue May 19 22:57:46 2015 UTC,"Hardly.  Rewatch the aftermath where Taj is being restrained and then shoves JR.  If you want to deny video evidence than this conversation is over.  That might have been the reasoning given but the way he acted after was definitely made it easier for the refs.  Also, what the series was up to before that is not irrelevant at all.  Have you ever seriously watched or played basketball?  Refs call games differently all of the time based on how high emotions are running and it happens all of the time.  It's called calling a game tight and it is an effective strategy to deescalate tensions between the two teams.  I agree that that is the kind of call that makes people think the ref/league has an agenda.  Problem being that those people are idiots and the NBA shouldn't, and probably doesn't, care about their opinions."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,Ttiger,6,Tue May 19 23:01:06 2015 UTC,For me this series all comes down to outside shooting. If the Hawks can go full '09 playoff Magic and hit all their open outside shots while the Cavs outside role players go cold... we're going to lose. I don't see any other path to victory for them unless we suffer more injury woes. Atlanta is more than talented enough to pull this off.

I think the X's and O's of this series will be the best we've seen in these playoffs. I expect Budz to throw us things we haven't seen yet, and I expect Blatt to make the necessary adjustments.   But in the end, I expect the best players to win. Maybe the Cavs stay healthy enough to run those players out there, maybe not. :) If JR Smith looks distracted, I'm blaming your strip clubs. :D  If we're healthy, we'll win in 6 or 7."

AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,mfoste34,6,Wed May 20 15:34:58 2015 UTC,How accurate are the Spurs comparisons when it comes to the Hawks? Is it just because of Budenholzer and the fact that there is no standout star? Or is there more to it than that?
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,BMC4,12,Tue May 19 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's easy to draw the comparisons since Coach Bud is a Pop disciple, but we have our own unique style with probably less post game and more emphasis on jump shots. Pretty much anyone on the team can hit an open three."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,TSR3K,5,Tue May 19 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"I read ""Pop disciple"" as Popsicle..."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,tyler9090,7,Tue May 19 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"I think they are a little exaggerated. The Spurs move the ball fluidly, like the Hawks, and have the similarities w/ Bud, but I think their offensive styles differ. The Spurs like to play through the post w/ Duncan and work out from there. I think the Hawks prefer the pick and roll/Horford face up to play through, as in the recent games I've seen, Horford rarely plays w/ his back to basket"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,6,Tue May 19 19:38:04 2015 UTC,Obviously I wish we had home court advantage but being the home team for the first 2 is scary as shit!
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,-Runaway,4,Tue May 19 19:48:12 2015 UTC,At least we have JR for the first 2 games this time
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,deanremix,1 point,Tue May 19 20:21:59 2015 UTC,So far. Give JR some lee way to change that situation.

AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,redditnewbie987,5,Wed May 20 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"I subbed to the Heat subreddit over the summer. I subbed to the Celtics and Bulls subs during those series. I like interacting with the friendly fans but I also enjoy reading delusional/salty comments for a good laugh. I subbed here a few days ago when you guys advanced so I could start reading some of those entertaining comments and I've yet to find any. I'm impressed and disappointed at the same time. No matter. It's going to be a great series and im excited to interact with you guys! You seem really chill. Every fan base has their douchebags (I know we do), but I like what I see so far. Enjoy the lottery and the dubs/rockets game tonight and I'll see you back here tomorrow!"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,erftonz,10,Tue May 19 22:31:00 2015 UTC,"I think the Hawks will take this series. There is no pressure on them at all to win. Sports media have largely written them off. The Hawks beat them (3-1) in the regular season and Cleveland is more banged-up than Atlanta is. There was pressure to win the last two series and Atlanta almost buckled under it. I feel like they're playing with house money at this point and will play like there's nothing to lose and a lot looser. They seemed really tight in the Washington and Brooklyn series.   Meanwhile, ALL the pressure is on LeBron to win and to do it with hurt supporting cast. He'll definitely get his, but I think that ultimately Hawks team play will win out in the end.   There will be blowouts by both teams in this series as well.   Coach Bud is miles greater than Coach Blatt. LeBron is miles greater than any single player on the Hawks.  Hawks in 6. Maybe that's wishful thinking, but I think the Hawks not only can do it, but will.   Good luck to both teams. Regardless who wins this series, I'll be pulling for them in the finals.   Most importantly GO HAWKS!"
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,cwolfe,8,Tue May 19 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"Coach Bud is miles greater than Coach Blatt   I disagree with this. I am not saying Bud is or isn't better (he probably is better given that he took an 8th seed to a 60 win season), but I don't think he is miles better by any means. Media influence has significantly skewed everyone's view of Blatt but he largely outcoached Thibs and most definitely kept up with Stevens in the prior two series. He found a way to shut down Isiah Thomas in the Celtics series who was giving us a ton of trouble, found a way to incorporate TT in the starting lineup with Love going down, got meaningful minutes out of James Jones, completely shut down Rose in the last two games of that series and has turned Delly, an undrafted player, into a good backup for Kyrie (especially with Kyrie injured). Don't sleep on him."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,redditnewbie987,6,Tue May 19 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll just have to see. Again, best of luck."
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,TheChinchilla914,3,Tue May 19 19:34:56 2015 UTC,I have that image of Blatt nervously trying to call for the timout he doesn't have and the assistant running over to stop him. Then he calls a last minute shot for someone other than LeBron. He's not as bad as they said earlier in the season but he's shaky. At the same time Bud has made some boneheaded moves in crunch time as well as some peculiar rotation calls that cast a shadow over his Coach of the Year halo
AtlantaHawks,36ii9x,MarinePrincePrime,6,Tue May 19 22:14:36 2015 UTC,"The timeout call was absolutely boneheaded. I think he just isn't used to that from the Euroleague. But like you said, everyone, including the best coaches, makes mistakes. The media just likes to focus on mistakes and has largely looked past all of the important adjustments I put forth in my argument above that helped us win the last series despite being in bad shape health-wise.    Other than that, I actually agree with his set-play to have LeBron inbound the ball. Several reasons: 1) We had trouble inbounding the ball on the previous possession and burned through two timeouts. We needed our best inbounder on it, which is LeBron. 2) LeBron was ice-cold all night (9/29 before the final shot). JR, on the other hand, was 4/4 from three in the 4th quarter and brought us back into the game. 3) This same drawn play has worked before for a buzzer beater against the Spurs (LeBron inbounding and Kyrie shooting). Instead of Kyrie, it was supposed to be JR this time. In fact, against the Spurs, it worked two straight timeouts in a row: here is the final one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoPfTavpt8o)."

Just a feeling about the way we're trending compared to Atlanta.   However, I could see us doing it in 6 if we drop Game 1, which I wouldn't be surprised about. LeBron has said himself Game 1 is always a feel out game for him and he typically doesn't do great in Game 1s.  I, however, cannot see a realistic situation in which we lose, unless LeBron gets hurt or Kyrie is out for the entire series"

Whatever it takes to get at NYPD."
AtlantaHawks,36htbw,kareemk,3,Tue May 19 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"To further refine your argument they'd use him being there to minimize his pain and suffering. ""If he's able to sit Courtside at a basketball game, then clearly he is able to walk around and partake in everyday activities"".  Which I'm sure the Hawks will use that argument that he can't even do his own laundry. Let alone go out"

AtlantaHawks,36iluv,DwightBeanie,8,Tue May 19 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"Rick Kamla gave a very unbiased analysis of the series. Cleveland guys decided that any evidence given wasn't important and tossed it aside. They brought up Korver making the All-Star Game; Kamla brought up Mo Williams making the team for Cleveland a few year ago -albeit that doesn't matter. Not ten seconds later, one of the guys got mad and said that they wanted to debate. How the fuck can you say you want to debate and argue but simply toss the other person's argument aside? Rick Kamla, while great at NBA analysis as a whole, is True to Atlanta."
AtlantaHawks,36iluv,Malthous,5,Tue May 19 21:22:24 2015 UTC,I heard that interview too and I liked how Rick stood up for Jamie and for our Hawks (especially Korver). I can't wait till this series starts and we can show the country just how good our Hawks are!

AtlantaHawks,36hitn,Aviator157,2,Tue May 19 12:56:04 2015 UTC,Times like this is when I wish we still have Ivan Johnson.
AtlantaHawks,36inka,IWantSuperpowers,16,Tue May 19 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"Thabo is a really awesome perimeter defender and a smart offensive player.  He's basically the Demarre Carroll of our 2nd team.  I don't know how much it would have changed things because almost every game was ridiculously close and could have gone to either team.  He was a really big part of our success during our red-hot middle of the season, though... so he definitely would have helped."
AtlantaHawks,36inka,broeho,6,Tue May 19 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"This. I know for a fact had he been healthy (or not out for the season) that game 3?4? against the Nets when Deron Williams went for 30+points and something crazy like 5/7 from three, that wouldn't have happened.   Also, game 3 against the Wizards when Beal and the whole team had that crazy 60% from three in the first half.... that too wouldn't have happened.  And Paul Pierce wouldn't have gotten those three last second three point shots."
AtlantaHawks,36inka,kareemk,7,Tue May 19 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"For some reason we played our worst basketball of the season when Thabo was out, and the best when he was healthy. Even when Jeff Teague was out for a little bit we still didn't play that bad."
AtlantaHawks,36inka,atomsej,5,Tue May 19 20:20:09 2015 UTC,What I noticed from watching Thabo is that he has long ass arms and even though he isn't blocking shots left and right when he challenges a shot from a wing player they are more likely to miss. His defense against lebron earlier in the year was great and I couldn't help but wish we had him when we faced the wizards to slow down beal when korvers shot wasn't falling. His offense also improved through the year so he wasn't a total waste on that end and was one of the top 3 players off the bench and kinda of our 6th/7th man with Dennis  in the regular season.

By far the best atmosphere at a basketball game I have ever been to in person.  This was just after the streak, and both teams were on top of the NBA.  And if this truly is a magical year, let us beat the best to win our championship.  I can't believe I just wrote that."
AtlantaHawks,36k6hz,Big21worm,1 point,Wed May 20 11:44:28 2015 UTC,GS would be hella hard to beat considering Steph Curry has been lighting up the Top Ten recently and killing it on the court.

AtlantaHawks,36ioo1,tyler9090,2,Tue May 19 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Specifically playing against the cavs, these will happen a moderate amount of times. Take a drink after the following: When Tristan Thompson gets a rebound, when JR Smith sinks a 3, when someone alley oops the ball to Mozgov, when Delly scores at all, when LeBron talks to a ref about a call, and when Kyrie finishes at the basket with some kind of ridiculous circus shot.  I'd be totally down to following any counter-rules you guys make up for us playing against the hawks"
AtlantaHawks,36ioo1,tyler9090,2,Tue May 19 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'll contribute a few counter-rules (things I roll my eyes at as a Hawks fan when they happen, they'll happen a moderate amount of times as well and there's nothing you really can do but drink since they should not typically happen):   Pero hits a 3. Pero pump-fakes a 3 and draws a foul. Teague or Schroder hit a mid-range jumper/3 with more than 15 seconds on the shot clock. Millsap, Horford, or Schroder hit both their free throws. Hawks successfully score out of a timeout inbounds play. Schroder or Teague iso and hit a buzzer beater at the end of a quarter. Horford flexes towards your bench.   Hawks fan versions:   Pero misses a 3. Teague or Schroder take a mid-range jumper/3 with more than 15 seconds on the shot clock. Millsap, Horford, or Schroder miss a FT. Bud draws up some terrible inbounds play out of a timeout. Schroder or Teague iso and miss a buzzer beater at the end of a quarter. Horford flexes towards the Cavs bench."

AtlantaHawks,36hu49,TaTaToothey,2,Tue May 19 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Combined with Arnovitz' cautious reprieve. These are 2 obvious fans of the Hawks that have the slight degree of dissatisfaction warranted by the disparity from performances during the season to the playoffs.  Their reaction seems to be mature and accurate, neither home baised, but affectionate, neither dismissive, but skeptical. I appreciate anyone who takes more time to speak about the Hawks phenomenon in the media than their marketable value today dictates."

But the Park Bar by Centennial has these large af water bottles they fill with coke and rum that I am quite fond of. And they are 3 for the price of 1 or 2 for the price of 1 I cant remember. Best part is that you can carry them to Thrilips and get properly wasted.  In fact, when the Cavs were here in March I was so drunk I didn't know they we're wearing the retro jerseys until the second quarter all thanks to Park Bar."

Come Wednesday our fan bases will cut the friendly chatter and mutual masturbation that we've had going on and we'll be enemies, at least for a series.

AtlantaHawks,36f8ji,DellyTres,38,Tue May 19 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"Cavs fans in here acting like they are more ""disrespected"" than you Hawks fans is funny and a little disturbing. I don't know what mainstream media Cavs fans are reading. Just about everyone picked the Cavs to fly through the East, and again in this series. Ever since Lebron won titles he's been godlike to the national media, even this year - one of his worst, statistically speaking.  THIS is disrespectful. ESPN doesn't even put a Hawks player in the conference finals preview. Hawks fans have every right to feel disrespected and I hope they win the title just so the mainstream media HAS to say something about them. ATL is due for some good vibes and recognition."

""We're used to that shit too"" - Implying that ESPN disrespects the Cavs or neglects them in the same way they do the Hawks, which is completely untrue.   ESPN does not discuss the Hawks unless they absolutely have to. They find excuses (just as with Lebron on the Heat) to talk about a Lebron team whenever possible."

AtlantaHawks,36f8ji,moodyfloyd,1 point,Tue May 19 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, reading comprehension. Lol. Nothing in your original comment mentions ""the city of Cleveland"" relative to the ""city of Atlanta."" The implication was comparing the coverage of the Cavs and Hawks by ESPN and relating those two, given that we're in the Hawks sub and you have a Cavs flair.  But if you're going to compare Cleveland and Atlanta as sports cities, at the very least people discuss Cleveland. ESPN the magazine had an entire fucking issue about Cleveland earlier this year. An entire issue of ESPN the magazine was devoted to Cleveland. Lebron being from your state and playing for your city by default makes your city relevant. At the very least, for the past 13+ years, people have been enamored with a guy from Ohio named Lebron James who is maybe the biggest American sports star.   As for other sports teams, Cleveland has been the butt of jokes for sure - however, famously so. American has a hard on for middle America teams and cities, and Cleveland has the ""hard working"" city label. So while they're usually complete jokes in football and often in baseball, they are at least recognized. The Falcons, even during their 13-3 and a few yards from the super bowl season was dismissed regularly. And by dismissed I mean not even talked about."

You didn't just say ESPN is shit media. You said you're used to their shit too.  Comments and criticism when you guys (the Cavs) are struggling is far different than not being covered at all and roundly dismissed by pundits by omission. The Hawks are ""covered"" (if you can call it that) in the polar opposite way from the Cavs.  Again, you guys got an entire ESPN magazine issue devoted to your city. Atlanta would be hard pressed to find an article about their sports teams in 5 straight issues of ESPN the magazine. Hard to see how Cavs fans can relate to Hawks fans in relation to ESPN coverage."

You have no idea the kind of shit I hear every night from patrons about how the Hawks were going to lose to the nets and the to the wiz and now to the cavs. The night we went down 2-1 to the wiz was honestly one of my worst nights cooking period.
AtlantaHawks,36f8ji,TheFlying,2,Tue May 19 05:25:28 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I don't get. Haters keep saying we're gonna lose every round and it doesn't seem to happen. Oh they advanced? They're gonna lose now. Like seriously?

Then somebody, don't know who, said that one of those games was early in the season when LeBron wasn't trying and another was when the Cavs had a bunch of games in a row and the Hawks had a bunch of rest so you can throw the regular season record out.  Yeah, they were that nonchalant about what happened during the regular season.  But then Van Pelt picked the Hawks anyway."

How many times have you heard people give the Warriors shit for being inexperienced with a first year head coach and that the regular season doesn't mean anything in the playoffs?
AtlantaHawks,36f8ji,jperez3209,2,Tue May 19 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"Lets be real, ATL isn't going to get much hype in this series. It freaking Lebron, he is basically 90% of ESPN's content.

If they think the rockets have a chance but the hawks don't they didn't watch the 4 teams play each other during the regular season.  Houston got absolutely demolished by the warriors almost everytime they played and Golden State looks like the worst matchup they could face in the NBA.

AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,thrashfan,3,Wed May 20 04:09:46 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my bad for phrasing it like that.   Does he buy a lot of tickets? Yes. That's because he's figured out how to do it successfully. He's also a good guy and seems to enjoy helping people out by giving discounted tickets from time to time when he feels like it.    Was the advice bad? Yes. The prices are dropping but he tried to help people out by telling them to buy before the scalpers got to them and jacked up the prices.
AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,jmonumber3,2,Wed May 20 04:13:44 2015 UTC,"see my comment below on the facts.  the advice was only bad if you weren't jumping on tickets the MINUTE they went on sale.  I posted my advice around halftime of the game so people could do that.  It is true that if you were buying tickets an hour or two later, you did not hit the optimal time to buy tickets.  That is unfortunate.  As I said in the other thread, its exceedingly difficult to perfectly time ticket buying."

AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,Martinsek,6,Wed May 20 04:04:49 2015 UTC,i deny all charges.
AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,koorob,6,Wed May 20 04:05:37 2015 UTC,On the count of being a shit bag you are found guilty!  On the count of being a sales rep you are found innocent. Based on the fact that you're a shit bag scalper
AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,thrashfan,-6,Wed May 20 04:07:48 2015 UTC,"Koorob's advice: ""My recommendation right now is go buy game 1 and/or 2 IMMEDIATELY when they go on sale direct. Everyone buying from resale is going to pay even more and if you wait there will be no direct availability or it will be way worse seats. Game 2 will be in even HIGHER demand because its a weekend, so if you can't handle multiple browsers at once go buy those first.""  This is proven as FALSE.  FACT: Prices went down FACT: Tickets not yet sold out FACT: Koorob provides bad advice  Thanks, goodnight."
AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,koorob,4,Wed May 20 04:08:16 2015 UTC,"FACT:  The prices immediately when the tickets went on sale are at this moment still SIGNIFICANTLY lower than what they are today.  FACT:  Hawks raised prices on tickets within the first hour of tickets being on sale. FACT:  Prices were lowered several days later from the +1 hour prices, but are still significantly higher than the 0 minute prices.  EXHIBIT 1:  Receipt for purchase of 2 tickets in section 308 row F for $109 per ticket at 10:02pm Friday for game 2 from ticketmaster.com.    EXHIBIT 2:  Current ticketmaster.com site showing tickets in 300s sideline for $179 (wednesday) and $199 (friday).  CONCLUSION:  Buying tickets immediately upon them going on sale was the best deal for ECF tickets and my advice in this case turned out to be correct.  My advice is only educated guesses about the ticket markets and is not perfect, but in this case it was good."

AtlantaHawks,36kzkj,jmonumber3,4,Wed May 20 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"if i thought this advice was bad i would.  i have definitely given other advice you can go back and look for that did turn out to be bad.  for example, at the start of the season I advised people to avoid buying tickets for a whole slew of games because I thought you'd be able to get them at resale closer to gametime much cheaper.  That advice turned out to be terrible (it was true for the last 5 years but not this year) and it would have cost anyone who followed it a lot of money.  That's a good example of me giving bad advice.  You should cite that one instead."

So either way you'd be going.  So how are you not going?"

AtlantaHawks,36fj7a,GT2018,7,Tue May 19 02:53:18 2015 UTC,Proof is in the pudding.  They are gone because regulars spoke out against them.
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,AtlantaChillen,3,Tue May 19 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"on one hand, the kind of dynamic pricing model where single game prices shift around based on demand is very common now in all sports, and the Hawks will typically release additional tickets over time. So i understand that happening.  Being completely sold out is a sign prices were too low, and for a game that has only been on sale for 4 days in total I'm sure they do expect many ticket sales on final day.    On other hand, i agree with you in game 1 case.  its really hard to know how much people will be willing to pay for tickets as its pretty unprecedented situation and its a very short time window to sell, and the Hawks made several mistakes including:   Overpricing some sections (definitely 300 baselines and upper sidelines - whereas the premium seats were not at all overpriced) Waiting too long to release inventory so that during the initial flurry where people were most excited to buy tickets they couldn't get them. Failing to connect the nba ticket exchange to ticketmaster until monday which drove people to other secondary ticket sites and that depresses primary ticket sales.   I expect philips will be effectively sold out wednesday, but arenas call anything close a sell-out."
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,koorob,2,Wed May 20 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"That second point was definitely a huge mistake. Looks like they did that to gauge whether or not prices should go up or down since prices have definitely gone up since, but not cashing in on the hype after game 6 was pretty dumb."
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,stnewton,-3,Wed May 20 01:53:20 2015 UTC,"their 'dynamic' pricing model has sufficiently sketched me out to the point that i'm scared to buy tickets. i feel bad for those who paid $160 only to see the same seat cost $60 less shortly thereafter. i understand that its not in the hawks' interest to allow scalpers/resellers to make all the money, but some people must be feeling pretty ripped off right now."
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,koorob,5,Wed May 20 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"after you have bought your tickets you will only create pain and misery for yourself by going back and looking at prices again.  it is almost impossible that you will ever time ticket buying perfectly - whether you bought direct from TM and the resale market collapsed and you blew money that way, or Hawks raised/lowered prices.  Pay a price you are happy with and enjoy the game.  don't worry what other people pay."
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,koorob,-7,Wed May 20 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"umm, are you earning a commission on ticket sales? first, you have posts encouraging people to buy tickets IMMEDIATELY after they go on sale, which turned out to be very bad advice. THEN, you're saying to buy tickets and never check prices again? That is some pretty shady advice, pal."
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,jatl4,8,Wed May 20 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"Actually buying tickets immediately when they went on sale turned out to be excellent advice.  for example, i bought tickets on friday at 10:02pm for game 2 in 308 row F for $109/ticket.  at this moment those tickets are selling for $199/ticket on ticketmaster for friday's game ($179 for wednesday).  Within a short while they pushed prices significantly higher but those first minutes were the best deals you could get. As I've said quite a bit, this is very uncharted territory for hawks tickets.  I give advice based on my years of experience for the benefit of our redditors at no fee and actually to the detriment of my own ticket selling as what I usually suggest on here would keep you away from tickets at the highest prices I often sell them at.  My advice has generally turned out to be very good and better than what most inexperienced ticket buyers would figure out themselves.  If you read our ticket wiki on here I wrote, you'd notice that I suggest that waiting things out until the last minute is very often the best possible way to get the cheapest tickets, but it does incur risk.   My advice not to look at prices after you buy is for your own sanity, it doesn't affect how much you actually pay for tickets."
AtlantaHawks,36k3go,koorob,-6,Wed May 20 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"Dude, give me a fucking break - ""at no fee and actually to the detriment of your own ticket selling.""

AtlantaHawks,36f1vg,jbtrackxc,2,Mon May 18 21:54:11 2015 UTC,Good podcast.  Just wanted to point out that Paul Pierce did almost go to the Clippers last offseason but they weren't willing to give him enough money because they also wanted Spencer Hawes.  He can't go to the Clippers next season because he is still under contract with the Wizards.    Also wanted to say that resigning Demarre with the plan to trade him is very unlikely unless the team he is going to can only make it work with the cap rules by doing a sign and trade.  If you signed him and then traded him at the deadline like what happened to Isaiah Thomas that is very bad business for attracting and keeping free agents in the future.

AtlantaHawks,36c3hn,itellitlikeitis666,2,Tue May 19 14:20:45 2015 UTC,Actually the opposite.  I am a massive fan of LBJ. Always have and always will.   The owner of the Cavs i cannot stand. After his childish letter where he slammed lebron and claimed Miami would have no success i now want the opposite. I am happy for lebron to win rings elsewhere just not cleveland.

The thing is I don't understand why...  -our fanbase is pretty nice compared to others for the most part  -we don't have any douchebag/dirty players (aside from maybe shroder)  -We work as a team and when we're clicking our basketball is very easy on the eyes  -we have a very good coach  -our fans have been extremely supportive ever since the undefeated month, and have been one of the best fans throughout the playoffs even if our team may have not deserved that much support  so, what gives? What's with the hate? I think we're the most hated team that's left, even with the Rockets and the Cavs still in the mix, and that says something..."
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,atomsej,34,Mon May 18 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"I understand why. Ever since Jordan the NBA has been promoting the shit out of individual players. Jordan became bigger than the game itself, much less the Bulls. That trend of promoting the individual has since continued with all of the elite players in the league. Marketing trends + isolation style play dominating the last generation of players results in a lack of respect for or interest in a team like ours that doesn't focus on individual success and has no marketable players. No one  likes the Spurs, but almost everyone respects them because of what they have accomplished. We haven't accomplished anything, so we are neither respected nor well liked."

I don't think it's people hating on the Hawks but just legitimately thinking they don't have a chance.  To be fair nearly every article, podcast or interview I've seen/heard has been ruling out the Hawks, and a lot of people will formulate their opinions from these.  Also - I can't believe I missed out on a two chainz shirt.  There's only XL's left and I'm seriously considering adding 50 pounds so I can wear one."
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,AlconTheFalcon,8,Mon May 18 14:31:12 2015 UTC,"Cavs fans in r/nba are the only people saying that the hawks will be a tough series, while the rest of the folks are pretty much going with a ""the hawks are so fucked"" approach."
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,millsmillsmills,3,Mon May 18 14:39:36 2015 UTC,I think those comments are more of a Karma grab/low hanging fruit joke anyways.  With Love out though I do think this will be an awesome series.  I think Thompson loses a lot of value against your bigs.  And if Kyrie isn't 100%  I think the Hawks could definitely take this series.
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,BlindBanditMelonLord,1 point,Mon May 18 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely would have taken this series with the Cavs over the Bulls. That's not to say Chicago is a better team, as the previous series informed us. But we just match up way better with Cleveland. Even with Gasol not at 100% the Bulls would probably give us fits with their size alone."

AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,nerdyintentions,18,Mon May 18 03:02:32 2015 UTC,This is (hopefully) when things get fun because the Hawks this year seems to play better when there are low expectations.  There is very little pressure on this team right now.
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,drrhythm2,5,Mon May 18 15:25:30 2015 UTC,I doubt they feel like there is little pressure.  This is the biggest stage any of them have ever been on.  They certainly aren't just sitting back and reading reddit's opinion of them to figure out if they should feel pressure.
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,NewGhoulOrder,2,Mon May 18 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"Little pressure in the sense that most of the analysts and pundits expect the Hawks to lose.  Where as, at least with Brooklyn, almost everyone thought the Hawks would blow through them (a lot of predictions for a sweep).  I'm talking about the media and vibe in general not just what is being said on reddit.  Basically, I think the Hawks can go out there and play their game and not worry about living up to expectations."
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,robotron2112,1 point,Mon May 18 12:12:09 2015 UTC,"One the one hand, the Hawks didn't end up choking and losing to inferior teams in the first two rounds. So that is a weight off our backs.   On the other hand, we now have a legit shot at getting to the finals against a team that, while good, is certainly beatable and that the Hawks can really match up well against.

AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,Twistify804,1 point,Mon May 18 07:01:45 2015 UTC,I would expect hawks fans to like Boston.  They are a lot like your team but with less talent.
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,Tenken8,1 point,Mon May 18 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that Washington was underrated and I even think they would be competitive with both the Bulls and the Cavs. But they were underrated for good reasons.  They weren't nearly as good during the season as they were in the playoffs.  You guys would likely drop at least 1 game to the Celtics and would be extremely unlikely to sweep the Bulls.  The Cavs were very likely to sweep the Celtics only because the Celtics match up so badly vs the Cavs.  You guys, though a much better team, didn't match up well vs Brook Lopez and Brooklyn so I didn't expect you guys to sweep going into the series though they were by far the worst team in the playoffs.  The truth is it is extremely hard to beat an NBA playoff team 2 games in a row yet alone 4, and there is a ton of chance in NBA games.   Even if the Celtics aere better than Brooklyn, and the Bulls were better than Washington, both of which I believe, it doesn't mean anything that it took you guys a copule more games to win your series than the Cavs."
AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,gildedtreehouse,3,Tue May 19 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"just be patient bros, I'm used to the the lack of respect that Atlanta sports gets all around. we wont be a favorite to win a game for the duration of the playoffs and I cant wait for the so called ""experts"" to insert their foots in their mouths.

AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,uhdude,3,Tue May 19 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"The vibe I'm getting is pretty much whoever wins this series is going to be the enemy of the sub in the NBA Finals.

AtlantaHawks,36bjp8,bearg0d,3,Mon May 18 06:55:52 2015 UTC,I don't see much hate on you guys. Everyone is hating on the clippers cuz of their big choke.   But people were disappointed that you guys barely beat a Washington team that had John wall injured and missing for a few games. You guys didn't look as dominate in that series as everyone expected you guys to be.

I doubt that Cleveland will intentionally do that either. I really think that the Wizards played excellent defense the entire series and the Nets were not shabby on D either. I don't expect the Cavs to play D to the level of either Washington or Brooklyn.  On offense the Cavs are formidable but they are also prone to turnover the ball. People don't seem to realize how much of the Hawks offense is generated by their defense. This will be the key to the series in my opinion. If the Hawks can turn it into a track meet, they will win."

AtlantaHawks,36bjsn,gildedtreehouse,7,Mon May 18 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"My nba ""bone goal"" is for the rockets to get swept by the Hawks in the finals. Josh Smith being the mvp for the Hawks from all the rebounds he provides."
AtlantaHawks,36bjsn,Boom_Angry,4,Mon May 18 02:34:16 2015 UTC,Not sure if it's a compliment that you want us to beat the Cavs since you just want an easier match up in the finals.  I hope y'all beat the dubs.
AtlantaHawks,36bjsn,itellitlikeitis666,5,Mon May 18 03:10:32 2015 UTC,Good luck beating the Warriors lol. You'll need it.
AtlantaHawks,36bjsn,america_eff_yeah,2,Mon May 18 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"In order for us to break the curse, I have a feeling Josh Smith will have to airball a crucial 3 pointer at the end of game 7."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,theadjunctbrofessor,26,Mon May 18 04:29:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly:  Korver's slump.  If Korver gets back to form, I see that opening up a lot of looks for the rest of the team."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,mehjbmeh,6,Mon May 18 04:58:28 2015 UTC,I feel like Korver is the x-factor. The fact that he shot so poorly in the 1st 2 rounds and we still managed to win both in 6 games.... if he can get 4-5 threes per game I'd have a very good feeling about winning this series.
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,VusterJones,3,Mon May 18 12:10:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. But he's a rhythm shooter, and if he takes a while to heat up, I could see us running a deficit before too long. Smith, Shumpert, and Kyrie are usually consistent right out of the gate, and we've got to keep pace with them."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,RoninGT,3,Mon May 18 05:05:22 2015 UTC,"The one thing that remains constant is the threat of a Korver 3. He's still going to draw a defender with super glue style stickiness, which always helps down in the paint."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,tiercel,3,Mon May 18 10:35:04 2015 UTC,"So do you think we'll trade Threezus for more intensity in terms of a driving offense?   If Teague plays like he did against the Wiz in Game 6, I think it might work but we'll have to deal with Mosgov and TT down in the paint, who are big, strong, aggressive guys. And I'm not so sure we have an answer for that.   edit: why the fuck are people downvoting discussion-oriented questions? jesus fuck."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,RoninGT,3,Mon May 18 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"I think people thought you meant ""trade"" as in basketball trade, not strategy trade, giving up one skill to exploit another instead. People get protective of our guys, and talk of trading a popular player isn't going to be received well. They just read your post too fast and missed the context."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,mehjbmeh,3,Mon May 18 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. Korver proved towards the end of the year that he can be kind of a streaky shooter. So we have to see. But the question becomes who would sub in for Korver? Assuming you run Horford, Millsap, Teague, and Carroll, then would the next choice be running a 2-PG offense with Schroder?"
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,whoopthattrick84,1 point,Mon May 18 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"If we trade anyone I could see Teague for CP3. Teague is MUCH cheaper but still a top PG and Bud sitting Teague says he's not really ""sold"" on Teague as the guy."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,lackingcredibility9,5,Mon May 18 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"Jeff Teague is nowhere near the caliber of CP3. 2. it was teagues decision to sit, bud was going to sub him in with 3 minutes left but Teague said Schroder had the hot hand"
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,Jus10Crummie,1 point,Mon May 18 15:38:09 2015 UTC,I don't agree that Korver's peformance will matter in terms of opening up looks for the rest of the team.  Korver can be 0/15 in the series and we would still be crazy to choose to play him any differently than if he were 11/15.   Korver has earned to reputation to never allow an easy look at all costs no matter his recent peformance.
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,tiercel,11,Tue May 19 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"I think Rebounding will be our biggest problem, Tristan Thompson and Tim Mozgov have been doing a really impressive job for a few months if not longer. They are both really long. Long players have given us fits this year, so even with Al and Paul taking care of their box out assignments we still run the risk of getting beat on the boards, we cannot afford to give Lebron more opportunities than he going to get regardless. It will take extended focus on the task from our 2s and 3s to make a difference.        I feel pretty confident in Korver contributing more on offense this time around, chasing Beal all over the place really wore on him last series. Jeff will have to be aggressive which might be a little easier with Delly and Kyrie guarding him, neither are quite the defender John Wall is. Al and Paul just need to get a few blocks a game and hit the mid-range a little more consistently and well be good. I feel really confident that Demarre can force a few extra turnovers and misses from LeBron, but we can't afford to give him extra opportunities which goes back to my first point."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,mehjbmeh,14,Mon May 18 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"With the accepted ""wisdom"" around the league that we don't have a true star, I'm worried Cleveland will get the preferential ""Star Treatment"" on referee calls. Lebron's teams seem to flop and bark unlike any other, and the refs eat it up.  We can't play the Cavs and the Refs too. All I'm asking for is a fair shot."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,Adampro123,2,Mon May 18 10:45:36 2015 UTC,Why not? Refs were HORRID Games 4 and 6 vs the Wizards

AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,mtmv2,7,Mon May 18 13:56:53 2015 UTC,Lebron going god mode on us. Seems like the last few 1 seeds that faced off against Lebrons teams didn't quite get the result we are hoping for.
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,mtmv2,2,Mon May 18 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about that too. I expect us to get an early start, since he'll most likely save the gas in his tank until the series really demands it. We'll have to be smart about when we really push for the W in games 1-3, or we may find ourselves crawling out of a grave of our own doing."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,dillardPA,2,Mon May 18 04:37:26 2015 UTC,"LeBron James no doubt. Shut him down. If LeBron does well, it doesn't matter at all if our other problems are solved."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,TaTaToothey,2,Mon May 18 11:53:18 2015 UTC,"I believe you, but I hear this sentiment echoed all over the subreddit but no one seems to itemize why, other than ""he's the greatest player in the world. 'Nuff Said.""   What specifically about LeBron's play should we pay attention to? His drive? His passing? I'm not sure what the most important thing to focus on is.   edit: downvotes? really? for prompting discussion about the intricacies of LeBron? Jesus fucking fuck guys c'mon."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,dogblood,3,Mon May 18 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"Lebron is a threat because he doesn't do one thing great and others just ok, he does everything really well. You can stop a great shooter by playing closer to him, you can stop a great ball handler by forcing him to take jump shots, you can stop passers by limiting the lanes and lines of sight. The thing about Lebron is he is never the best scorer in the NBA, he is not the greatest passer, he isn't the best jump shooter, yet he is really good at all categories. He doesn't have a true weakness so it's hard to say force him to do this or that when whatever you force him to do, he will do well.   Lebron is never going to finish at the top of any stat category in the NBA. However, he will most likely be the biggest threat on the floor. The best thing to do is just to play our team brand of basketball. Lebron will get his 20 points a game. The key is to not let him get 35+. That's when we will lose. Simply contest all of his shots, don't let him get to the rim and help when he drives. He will be forced to pass or shoot a jump shot. He will make around 40% of them but at the end of the day that won't beat us."
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,Lionhearted09,2,Mon May 18 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"Whatever team he's on never loses until at least the finals. I couldn't tell you why by picking apart what he does, because I've no clue"
AtlantaHawks,36c2ui,cwolfe,2,Mon May 18 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"I mean to be fair if you actually seriously need an answer to this question you haven't been paying attention for the past 5 years. The dude can play all 5 positions especially against us since we don't have a true center, and does everything really well. To focus on any part of his game would be not doing the rest of his game injustice. He's the best passer, the best scorer, the best defender, and the smartest player on his team."

So Golden state is going to be prominently displayed. The Cavs have the biggest box office draw so they are going to get center stage. We would be in the middle had we played as we did in January throughout the playoffs but we've limped through 2 series. We don't get respect for that. Why should we? When we were rocking the league adored us. A starting line up for player of the month, 4 All Stars, Coach of the year. Now we look pretty average and no one respects us. We can earn that but we can't whine it our way. It's not about the refs or the league. Thankfully it is about how we play and we've played pretty meh overall. Our meh is good enough to get us into the ECF which is amazing. But it's still meh."
AtlantaHawks,36e275,cwolfe,2,Mon May 18 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"They didn't have to display them in a convex arc like that.  I understand that Golden State and Cleveland are the headliners, but come on, this is diminishing the Hawks and Rockets to a ridiculous degree."
AtlantaHawks,36e275,CLSmith15,1 point,Mon May 18 21:10:17 2015 UTC,I do motion design/gfx for NBA at Turner and that is how I would have done it because it keeps it interesting. Flat row or 2x2 is boring and doesn't happen in real life. The fans would be happy but it would look like ass. The way these choices get made in my world is someone will tell me (or I will guess) that Golden State and Cleveland are the big two. Then I would do the layout this way with fading light not to diminish the other teams but to add to the realism of the look. It creates a natural light fall off and makes it more interesting.  Just the way people create. Not intended to slight Houston or Atlanta but intended to highlight GS and Cleve.
AtlantaHawks,36e275,cwolfe,1 point,Mon May 18 21:38:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that flat is boring, but it could've been less convex so that the Rockets and Hawks logos would've been more visible.  I don't think that would've looked weird."
AtlantaHawks,36e275,CLSmith15,1 point,Mon May 18 21:54:03 2015 UTC,I'm sure it could have but there isn't any disrespect there IMO. They also could have (and I would have) lit/color corrected it in such a way that the full color of the Rockets and Hawks logos would have popped. I think that is what makes the difference. You don't see the red of the logos but the Cle/GS logos pop. That was unnecessary and kinda low quality

He was a liability on defense all series and as Manning said, Millsap straight worked on him. Not to mention he lost game 5 for the wizards, he reached on Shroeder losing Millsap which made Nene box out Millsap giving Horford a free opening for the board/basket."
AtlantaHawks,368idh,delilahHD,10,Sun May 17 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"That actually is a cool thing to think about. Every game seemed so detached from the others, such wars in themselves that I hadn't thought about it. Way to go Hawks, let's kick some LeButt."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,Shade_Raven,12,Sun May 17 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"Everyone has been saying Horford needs to play at the PF position since he's been in the league. He's been a top 5-10 center his entire career. At this point center is his position and he has some advantages being undersized. But we do have some help coming once we bring over Walter Tavares, though I doubt he'll play more than 8-10 mins/game next year.  As far as the draft goes, it's going to depend on if we can keep DeMarre or not. Someone is going to offer him a BIG contract, and with Milsap being the top priority, I'm not sure we'll be able to keep DeMarre. So I think they'll draft a wing player who can defend and develop him for the future.   I don't think we'll be able to get him at 15, but Stanley Johnson would be great. He's is a shutdown defender and great rebounder. And he's incredibly strong at 6'6 240! His college teammate, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is also an amazing defender. He's a little longer but not as physically imposing.  Another guy I'd love to get is RJ Hunter. We all know about him already from Georgia St. He's friends with Jeff Teague from their home town and played on the same high school team as Jeff's younger brother. He's got amazing length at the SG position and he's maybe the best shooter in the draft. He's also a great passer and playmaker. I see a little Steph Curry in him."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,chessbrah,6,Sun May 17 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that in the regular season that Millsap was definitely the top contract. But postseason? DeMarre has been probably the single best player on the team, and I would honestly put him over Millsap at this point. Though I'd like to just keep both and be even better next year."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,kraken-on-standby,7,Sun May 17 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Carroll will be cheaper and his perimeter defense and three point shooting are extremely important to us. Also, I think a team with big cap space is likely to make Millsap a $15 mill plus offer, which is probably a little too rich for us given his age. That said, I hope he's willing to sign around a $12 mill annual deal to stay with us."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,cosmo_bear,5,Sun May 17 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"If there's a shooter that can play defense, I want him. RJ might just fit that bill."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,america_eff_yeah,2,Sun May 17 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"Doesn't RJ seem like the type of player that could be a home run pick? Seems like he has ""it"", whatever that is."

I want to say he was a 86 when I drafted him. He was Rediculously  good. (Ik that doesn't translate into truth for real life) but still wouldn't be upset to have him
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,Adampro123,2,Mon May 18 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"I think Looney may slip to 15 because he is a project and a team like ATL will definitely have time to see him mature. One key issue with this is Tavares is due to come over and Muscala may be something they want to pursue. I think the injury to Sefo has shown where they need help, back up wings. The shock disappearance of Scott in the playoffs may change that towards the front court. I think Kaminsky will be wiffed on as not traditionally high pick material although he seems to be someone who the spurs would jump at, therefore Bud would take advantage. I know Frank can't defend anyone but i think he can easily adapt to a team defensive system that will not expose his weaknesses (like Dirk)."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,C-Jammin,2,Sun May 17 20:40:09 2015 UTC,I don't watch much college basketball so my opinion isn't a strong one or anything but i did watch some of the NCAA Tournament and i was really impressed with Frank Kaminsky.   I imagine either Milsapp or Carrol is going to sign elsewhere. I wish we could keep them both but honestly I think I'd rather keep Carrol. Horford would need someone to play along side him and we could either have Kaminsky or let Moose or Mike Scott step up and be a starter and have Kaminsky be our backup since I think Pero is also on his way out.
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,cosmo_bear,2,Sun May 17 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"I like Kaminsky but he's an outside playing center.  I want a guy who can get in there on the boards, grab some rebs, and create second chances.  I'm not sure Kaminsky has that sort of power.  He is long, but I think he will get outmuscled by quite a few guys."
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,lnternational,3,Sun May 17 23:25:03 2015 UTC,Don't forget that we have Edy coming over soon. 7'3 and a great rebounder and good defensive instincts.
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,Adampro123,1 point,Mon May 18 01:37:42 2015 UTC,7'3? Holy shit!
AtlantaHawks,369rt1,bearg0d,1 point,Mon May 18 12:47:54 2015 UTC,That's a really good point and i absolutely agree with you. if there's one thing we really need it's a guy that get's in there and fights for rebounds every game. Hopefully we can find that.   At the same time i feel like any rookie coming out of college is going to get out muscled in the the paint and you can always put on muscle and work on your game to improve in the paint especially if you have the size.   No matter who we get I have faith they can do well with us. It seems like every player that plays for our team improves.

Don't let the toxic fans bug you, most of them haven't been donning our colors for too long. Don't get me wrong, all of us are passionate as hell for our team and will cheer and boo accordingly, but many of us have been experiencing this frustration of treadmilling back and forth in the first and second rounds of the playoffs that we are just enjoying this amazing ride of brand new heights. I'm sure you Cavs fans who didn't follow Lebron to Miami and back feel the same way as well. I hope the Rockets lose, so we can have a fresh conference finals with teams that haven't had titles since nearly 40-60 years ago or if at all. Here's to the new era of basketball!"

Frustrated, the refs call Game 7 a wash, and declare the team to come out of the West to be the NBA champion.   sigh Also, hawks fans, thanks for being awesome.

Those of us old enough to remember the Braves beating the Indians in '95 won't let that go though.   Here's to a good series with no injuries. Either way I agree with OP, tired of the West thinking they are the shit. Hoping the East takes it this year. GO CAVS, FUCK NOAH."

Back when I was younger and still played there was nothing I liked better than when both teams played really well and gave it their all. I still feel the same watching games now.  Winning a close game always feels better than winning a blow out. The game becomes so much more exciting, so much more fun. Knowing you beat them at their best.  But if I could walk away from a game knowing that I couldn't have done more, then I could respect that they just played better. Sure I'd have rather won, but at the least I'd know that I didn't just give it to them freely.  They would have to work for that shit."
