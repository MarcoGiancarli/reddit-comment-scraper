RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,bensayshi,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:05 2015 UTC,No further comments needed
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,HappyGoLuckyDolphin,5,Tue Jul 21 00:59:50 2015 UTC,Him and Stephen Harper must be spending too much time together...he likes to spew about similar rhetoric here in Canada.
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,lyndy650,4,Tue Jul 21 03:10:41 2015 UTC,The fossil fuel lobbyists are all consolidating money towards parties of the heads of state-- they're fearing the end of their industry monopoly.
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,Theconverge,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:07 2015 UTC,"Thats what happens when the only economic policy is ""More oil and coal!!"" While simultaneously ignoring all other sectors of the economy"
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,lyndy650,4,Tue Jul 21 14:49:09 2015 UTC,It's not often I'm ashamed to be an Australian... but this is one of those times.
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,KamaKaZzie,3,Tue Jul 21 07:49:20 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe he's that dumb... Maybe this was taken out of context or something
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,aguywithagoat,9,Tue Jul 21 01:34:00 2015 UTC,"He's not dumb, he's a shill."
RenewableEnergy,3dzdlw,tlalexander,4,Tue Jul 21 02:35:37 2015 UTC,"Believe it, while trying to please his paymasters he's become as transparent as the wind he seems to hate so much."

RenewableEnergy,3dyoh8,anutensil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"I'll be totally honest, I follow politics, and energy is so far off everyone's radar as of late, a stance on wind subsidies will MAYBE become a sentence in a debate should environmental policy come up."

RenewableEnergy,3dyeiz,untouchedURL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:14 2015 UTC,I have stock in Vivint.  What does this mean?
RenewableEnergy,3dyeiz,BarcodeNinja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"It means that by q4, as long as he merger is approved, you will receive a buyout from SunEdison int the form of:  $9.89 per share in cash + $3.31 in the form of SunEdison stock + $3.30 in convertible notes  The total buyout is worth $16.50 per share of Vivint Solar.   Your other option is to sell now and take the cash at its current value (which has gone up to $15.75 after the announcement.)"
RenewableEnergy,3dyeiz,TyceGN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the info.  What is ""convertible notes""?"
RenewableEnergy,3dx16p,DonManuel,2,Mon Jul 20 06:14:30 2015 UTC,Renewable's are taking the lead. Good news.
RenewableEnergy,3du10x,pateras,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:36:58 2015 UTC,"I've got a plan to beat out all these offerings. It's pretty simple; you don't make things cheaper by adding more ""stuff"". High voltage systems, DC-DC converters, complex BMS systems all cost money. And DC storage is all about delivering the most kWh for the least $$.   So we take the cheapest battery technology (mass produced 18650 cells, just like Tesla uses). Package them very densely, in a hot-pluggable, hot-swapable ""blade"". Add just enough smarts to prevent thermal run-away, over-discharge, and over-charge situations. And let the make things simple for the end-user by facilitating modularity and upgradeability as needs change or new chemistries/capacities become available.  One pack, millions of uses."
RenewableEnergy,3durjp,thunderclap2995,5,Sun Jul 19 17:55:10 2015 UTC,"This is common when being off the shore means it has not yet docked. Therefore the ""trade"" is not complete. This can be driven by futures investing where someone somewhere wants the price on the market to change, the boat to dock, then for the sale of the stock to happen.  V.common in oil. With the rise and rise of renewables you can expect to see the same thing."
RenewableEnergy,3durjp,AFDIT,4,Sun Jul 19 18:49:03 2015 UTC,That is a terribly written article. They repeated the same 3 to 4 facts over and over.
RenewableEnergy,3durjp,Readed-it,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:02:07 2015 UTC,That's nearly word for word what I was going to say.
RenewableEnergy,3durjp,TheLatentSun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"Well, they used the same 3 to 4 facts stated multiple times.  The article was not written well at all."
RenewableEnergy,3durjp,Readed-it,2,Tue Jul 21 00:42:28 2015 UTC,That's what I was going to say almost word for word.
RenewableEnergy,3dtiwd,DonManuel,4,Sun Jul 19 08:41:37 2015 UTC,"if you want to view the article as 1 page instead of 4 http://www.pressdemocrat.com/business/4215757-181/healdsburg-man-uses-heat-to?page=0  I have often wondered why this isn't more mainstream to use solar thermal to desalinate water, seems like a good idea especially for small scale potable water in parts of the world with limited resources"
RenewableEnergy,3dtiwd,2dumb2knowbetter,0,Sun Jul 19 13:13:29 2015 UTC,Maybe it is a fire hazard to heat mineral oil to 666 degrees Fahrenheit?
RenewableEnergy,3dtiwd,strangerzero,2,Sun Jul 19 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"i'm sure it could be, if not a saftey hazard for humans, but the article stated that they heated the mineral oil above what they actually needed. I found a website that lists the auto ignition temp for common fuels here  but i would have to think they would have something like this engineered to be safe"
RenewableEnergy,3dqatv,DonManuel,3,Sat Jul 18 12:14:49 2015 UTC,"anyone more interested in this should check out Akon Lighting Africa, the musician Akon started a company to help bring solar energy to sub saharan parts of Africa where they struggle with energy and power."
