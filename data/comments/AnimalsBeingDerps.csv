AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,tablepants,42,Tue Jul 21 02:25:05 2015 UTC,This actually makes me sad.
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,sheRATCHETT,77,Tue Jul 21 03:22:39 2015 UTC,This is an OCD like behavior that is common in animals that are kept in captivity. Especially ones who typically patrol a large area in the wild.  It is sad.   This is why zoos are such a double edged sword for me. Conservation and education on one hand. Captivity of wild animals on the other.
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,kilgoreq,11,Tue Jul 21 03:34:58 2015 UTC,Would this behavior reduce if the captivity were to be expanded? I've seen this in elephants and their trunks sway around at their feet. It is very unfortunate that places dont have the funds to give them more space. When I saw this I thought the bear was having some sort of seizure.
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,violbabe,13,Tue Jul 21 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"This definitely can be combated, not just with more space but more so with increased enrichment, anything in their environment to keep their brains busy. However, it is not always an indication of a bad zoo, often animals move from hand to hand and this stuff gets ingrained in them and is then even harder if even possible to get rid of."
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,snatch55,2,Tue Jul 21 05:24:48 2015 UTC,"One thing zoos are starting to do is, where possible, switch animal habitats regularly. For instance, they might move lions into a habitat that had zebras in it and vice versa. Predator and prey can both smell each other, and they keep their minds active in the same way they do in nature. A little stress seems to be good for wild animals. They can switch it up with as many animals and habits as possible, stacking predators, giving small animals a brief period in huge enclosures, etc. The only limitation of this is the transportation of animals between habitats, so they're does need to be infrastructural planning or renovation."
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,wookiewookiewhat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:45 2015 UTC,"I think so. More space, better enrichment. Anything to keep their mind active and boredom away. I'm not an animal behavior expert or anything, I just worked in a zoo briefly. Maybe someone with more knowledge will chime in."
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,kilgoreq,2,Tue Jul 21 09:24:37 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this.  It should also be noted that, once this becomes a habit, it lingers even if the bear is moved to a better habitat. There is an animal sanctuary near my home that had a Himalayan bear, rescued from a horrible situation, and she did this. Her new home had plenty of space to roam, and the keepers provided enrichment almost daily. She had a much better life, but the habit remained. The keepers pointed it out, themselves, as part of their mission to educate about the abuse of exotic animals."
AnimalsBeingDerps,3e0v04,zerhanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like its boredom. Sitting within the same walls over and over, day after day is boring. The image is said to be from Lowery Park Zoo in Tampa FL, which is a very small zoo, with what I feel are inadequate enclosures. Smaller zoos should specialize more, instead of having more species.   I'd like to see more zoos that rotate exhibits. If you have four enclosures that are connected why not every so often change which animal is in it. That way they have new sights and smells to explore."

After about a week the dog started moving again so they unwrapped him and discovered that they had screwed up when putting it back together. Now one half faced forward while the other face backwards. Didn't matter to the dog through, if he flipped over he'd be able to keep going where he left off."

AnimalsBeingDerps,3clrw8,da1inchpunch,0,Wed Jul 8 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"This is her at nine weeks old. I had her for five weeks and I fell in love. I had to give her up and I miss her dearly, Giving her away broke my heart. She went to good owners who were morning their own Red Heeler that had died last year. It is wonderful how quickly and completely you can love a dog. I didn't fully understood this truth until now. The thing is, unconditional love, like the kind you get from a puppy can be overwhelming. It frequently and thoroughly took my breath away. I love her and miss her but she is where she belongs, where she can run all day. She taught me a whole lot of new lessons about my self. Essentially, this gorgeous little chew anything-crap on the rug-tail chasing menace taught me how to accept being loved without restraint."
