One of the things about practice is that it doesn't make perfect, it makes permanent.   Practice incorrectly or even correctly to stimuli that do not act as real defenders act, and it might create bad habits and strengthen bad decision making processes."

Kevin Hogan (stanford qb) started using this around the midway point of last year — If you watched them at all you know how different he looked first half vs. second half.  Right now the tech mainly is useful to give qbs mental reps by giving them lots of looks to diagnose quickly. Should help Kap a lot in his pre-snap reads.

Chug! Chug!"" and Rice was getting loose with a cigar and also sipping on a pitcher. Clearly he was trying out some of his TD celebrations that didn't quite make the cut!  Everyone started chanting ""Jerry! Jerry!"" - it was an awesome weekend.   Biggest letdown? Aaron Rogers was actually pretty boring. From the few holes I followed him he never really got involved with the crowd. AJ Hawk drives the ball like a damn beast.   Tickets were cheap too.

49ers,3dzmml,amd777,10,Mon Jul 20 21:10:54 2015 UTC,You seriously think he's not going to be on anyone's radar?

Opposing coaches have only seen his potential, but not enough to be 100% sure they need to emphasize the need to plug in the extra guy in the box (like they would against Frankie G).  There's also not a whole lot of talk from anybody about Hyde... and I think that's a good thing."
49ers,3dzmml,RatedR2O,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:30 2015 UTC,"Both ESPN and NFL FF predictions have him at around 1000 yds, 10 TDs. He's definitely on the radar"

49ers,3dzmml,Realik,4,Mon Jul 20 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"On a team like us, 1000 is a minimum as long as he stays healthy. Unless we completely change our offense, he's going to get plenty of touches."
49ers,3dzmml,seejay12,4,Tue Jul 21 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"Well i imagine he never gets tackled once. So starting at the 20, he should only need 2 carries a game to have a great season :)"

49ers,3dzmml,5thEagle,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"You're right, I don't know why you got hate. In a run first offense like what we run here, he's going to get 1000 as long as he stays healthy. If he plays 16 games and gets sub-1k with starter number of carries, then that's REALLY fucking bad."

Extremely high broken tackle rate 2014 success running from 1 back formations Familiarity and experience running outside zone from pistol formations, and we are transitioning to outside zone and probably will not abandon the pistol.    As long as he stays healthy he'll run for 1000 yards. It's not that big a deal actually even with mediocre per play production."

49ers,3dzmml,seejay12,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"First round talent with all the skills you want in a bell cow smasher and enough burst and speed to be effective three downs.   He'll certainly be platooned, but he's going to get plenty of carries and should be effective, which is a good situation to be in when you're moving on from your franchise's leading rusher. Not every team has the luxury of an heir apparent in place."
49ers,3dzmml,18andover,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:17 2015 UTC,"Considering he's all we got, he has a lot of things you want from a back. Good burst, breaks tackles (2nd in the league behind Lynch), and can catch out of the backfield. With limited touches, he did fine last year."
49ers,3dzmml,switchn,-6,Tue Jul 21 04:02:44 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this for months. This kid might go for 2,000 yards this year. Everything is in place for him.  He's the only person in the organization currently that has the potential to replace my Harbaugh flair."
49ers,3dzmml,18andover,6,Tue Jul 21 02:52:10 2015 UTC,2000 yards is very unrealistic. I'd be impressed with over 1300.

49ers,3e0a7i,IAmADuckSizeHorseAMA,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why this sub has to deal only with absolutes.   If you deny all of the good Harbaugh did for us, you're insane. However, if you deny he had his faults, you're equally insane. At the end of the day, we had a brilliant mind for a head coach but who was too stubborn to acknowledge his faults and, in spite of his reputation as an offensive master minded quarterback whisperer, the offense and quarterback play regressed every year, not the other way around, with the exception being from 2011 vs 2012.    He was the exact leader a lot of our guys needed to realize and achieve their potential, he was also so stubborn that he prevented us from taking the next step because he couldn't separate the personal and business sides of football. He took us to a Superbowl, but we had the same exact playclock/redzone woes his last year that he had his first year, and never showed improvement there.  There were some really basic fundamentals that we never saw improvement on. There was also some exceptional work we saw. It's time to call Harbaugh what he was: A smart coach who is too stubborn for his own good. He's not cut out for the NFL, he's not able to accept he has superiors, he shows blatant disregard in terms of showing his superiors respect (I don't care what your issue is, you do NOT tell your boss that your meeting is for ""men only""), and he can't do what's best for business if it's a tough, personal call. Until that changes, he won't thrive in the NFL and have a dynasty like someone as brilliant as him deserves.  It's time to end this BS that if you criticize him, you're saying he's a bad coach. He can have faults and still be a good coach."
49ers,3e0a7i,callmecatalyst,2,Tue Jul 21 23:40:33 2015 UTC,"I really loved having Harbaugh as a coach and I wish he would have been able to make it work with the SF front office, but I think keeping Baalke (if there really had to be one or the other) was the smarter decision because Jim Harbaugh doesn't exactly typify stability, nor does he seem like someone who is committed to his job for the long term. He's a guy that is so highly sought after because he can make your team competitive overnight and that blinds people (myself in 2011-2012 included) from listening to or acknowledging any faults about him that may be harmful or toxic to the team and/or franchise.    I'll always have a special place in my heart for the khakis and cleats and red sharpie (I heard it was actually a whistle, too). Harbaugh is such a great motivator and ""rah rah"" guy but his approach seems to be the polar opposite of another recently successful ""rah rah"" coach: Pete Carroll. I would take Jim over Pete for a HC any day of the week and twice on Sunday, but like him or not (I've disliked Carroll since his early 2000's years at University of Spoiled Children) he is a ""long term"" hire. He is steady and not volatile or prone to moving every few years. Jim seems to wear out his welcome or move on after about 4 years where ever he's been a HC. (My personal theory is that he gets bored or wants to be successful at an even bigger stage or accomplish a more impressive task by taking some team or school or franchise that looks hopeless and then boosts his ego by being able to make them great almost before he's finished unpacking. That is of course, if he's not booted out like SF did which I also think he never thought anyone would have the balls to show such a wildly successful coach the door because he's a dick. So anyway, I think in 2013 there were times I couldn't believe we ended up winning some of those games and that in the future many of those close games could end the wrong way for us, and suddenly he could look not-so-untouchable. And that coupled with who-really-knows-what-happened between him and his bosses ended up being the end of his tenure in SF with the 49ers.)   I do not love Jed York, but I certainly don't think he's a bad owner. I think if I had to pick one way or the other, I'd say he's been good to us. His father was a truly awful owner. So many people in here and in the Bay that I've talked to acted like York was somehow now Dan Synder levels of awful for letting Harbaugh go (this was still before any other coaching changes were made so JUST because of Harbaugh being shown the door), when they don't know about or remember when Mooch was snubbed by John York after one of the most exciting playoff wins in 49ers history, and yeah, the subsequent divisional round loss to the eventual Super Bowl champions that year, but my god, fucking MOOCH AFTER A PLAYOFF RUN AND NO ISSUES WITH THE FRONT OFFICE? That, to me, makes Harbaugh's 8 win season (which featured 4th quarter stats so egregious that all signs pointed to a systemic failure in the coaching staff that he refused to let York mess with and protected guys like Roman who clearly didn't care or know what half time adjustments are) completely justifiable when you don't even know if the guy will stick around if you do give him this big contract extension. He always kept his options open, never gave specific answers, and I actually DID worry for a day or so when I heard the Longhorns offer him $10 mil/yr - because as much as I loved him as our coach, he seemed like he'd take an intriguing offer any the first sign of trouble or if he became remotely unhappy with something here.    Basically I'm saying I do appreciate the gray areas of the situation. You have to. But in terms of how insufferable and negative EVERY single thread about anything was in this sub for months on end, yes, it got a little uncomfortable because I felt like I couldn't offer an opinion that wasn't super harsh on York while playing up the victim complex/martyr-status that was confusingly given to Harbaugh. But things are all good here - and I figured at worst it would only last until our first Tomsula 2015 season victory for people to move on. I'm glad it's already happened for the most part now though - because now we can be objective about Tomsula and not start the season already looking for reasons to justify not liking the promotion."

He also ran too upright for a rugby league player but it didn't stop him becoming of the games greats.  He has the uncoachable and unique ability to make defenders miss, I just hope that he does this in the NFL like he did in the NRL.  He could be a real asset as KR or PR and, heaven forbid, a few injuries  to Hyde, Hunter etc might see the 49ers relying on Hayne more than they expected."
49ers,3dsega,kiwi_colt,5,Sun Jul 19 02:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm excited too. We won't know if he can make it until his first pre season chance. People talk so much about the measurables and the technique that makes NFL players great, but there's an extra intangible that guys like Hayne have which allows him to break tackles effortlessly. I've been watching Hayne since he was a teen and he's only been hit 2 or 3 times in his whole career. He's a hard man to tackle and always puts himself in a good position to come out on top."
49ers,3dsega,switchn,2,Sun Jul 19 03:53:00 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  Hayne was never the most natural looking athlete when he ran but he had that natural instinct to step at just the right time.

49ers,3dsega,dude_with_Email,3,Tue Jul 21 09:18:18 2015 UTC,"Here's a sample of tackles from the first half of this year in the NRL (what Hayne used to play).  I'm a fan of both sports and both have huge hits.  The signifigance of the try he scored against St George was not that the defense couldn't hit, they can, but that Hayne instinctively avoided them using side steps (or jukes as you call them) and acceleration.  Check out these hits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hef8nDc23Yk"

49ers,3dsega,ausazza,7,Mon Jul 20 10:56:25 2015 UTC,I just really want him to make it. How rad would it be if this year is the rebuilding year for us and next year we come out swing and this freak of nature along with Hyde destroy it. I guess I just like sappy football stories though

49ers,3dsega,4thdontcare,5,Sun Jul 19 03:56:41 2015 UTC,Hayne's age doesn't do him any favors either. Then we also drafted Mike Davis on top of having Hunter return while signing Bush. The field behind Hyde is full of older/broken/untested parts. More tossing crap and seeing what sticks.
49ers,3dsega,anxdiety,3,Sun Jul 19 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"Hayne's chances on making the roster will not be based on his skill as a running back, there is literally 0% chance that he makes the roster this season as a running back.

49ers,3dsega,tossinkittens,6,Sun Jul 19 17:38:54 2015 UTC,At least wait until we have seen him play a game or two before saying what he can and can't do.

Can someone one make a football argument for why he should be on the squad? Honestly, the idea that this guy who has never played football before is better than any of of the collegiate athletes who have been playing this game their entire life is insulting."

49ers,3dsega,switchn,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"Theres video of him at the niners training facility looking like a fish out of water, trying to set a legitimate block. That he runs too upright, has been a public comment by the niners coaching staff as well, thats not a secret. He's 6 foot 2 and runs like hes still playing rugby. And I am still yet to hear a football reason for why he should make the squad. Maybe I'm wrong, but nobody has brought any football reasons as to why he should make the final 53. 'wait until he plays a game or two' is not good enough. Plenty of players have stood out in camp already, and have rave reviews. Athleticism is only part of football, can he memorize an NFL playbook, or pick up a blitz, or read a defense?"

Oh, for sure the Niners can prove everyone wrong, and of course we all hope they do, but right now, does anyone think of the Niners as a great team?  Do they put the fear in teams the way they did 2, 3, 4 years ago?  No way.  That's all that Steve said here and he's not wrong.    Right now, the teams that have that perception of greatness are the Patriots, the seaducks, and the Packers.

Kap is not a 5 year old.  What fans think of a player is irrelevant, the player himself is in control of his development. Some QBs can overcome adversity (porous O-Line, mediocre receivers)-- those QBs are currently called Brady, Rodgers and Wilson.

49ers,3do36y,polticalmind,-5,Fri Jul 17 22:50:14 2015 UTC,Wilson's decision-making and his ability to read defenses has nothing to do with how good the Seattle defense is.  Same goes for the other QBs.  Cobb is a good WR but can you say for certain that he'd do well with a lesser QB? Look at what happened with Eric Decker. He was a great WR because Peyton made him a great WR. As soon as his QB was called Geno Smith it was over.

49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,2,Sat Jul 18 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"that's what I said.... that the QB position is far more important. Rice would've been a good WR anywhere but if he was stuck with a crappy QB his whole career, he wouldn't have had any of the untouchable records he has today."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,2,Sat Jul 18 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Right, it works both ways though. Steve Young for instance would not have had the career he had if he he was stuck in Tampa throwing to whoever the hell he was throwing too behind a horrible offensive line with no run game. And horrible coaching. That being said, yes the QB position is for more important. You more important for a few reasons. That being said, any player still has to be put in a good position to succeed."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,2,Sat Jul 18 01:05:40 2015 UTC,Kaepernick didn't have the chance to learn from a HOF qb for three years before starting like Rodgers did.
49ers,3do36y,Ma-teo,7,Fri Jul 17 22:56:37 2015 UTC,People always say this. Yet it's well known that Favre and Rodgers did not have a good relationship. They're not even similar in play style.
49ers,3do36y,SirShlappy,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:50 2015 UTC,"Regardless of who he learned from - Rodgers had three years to develop.   That said, Kap did have one and a half years as well."
49ers,3do36y,Rosetti,2,Sat Jul 18 10:27:51 2015 UTC,Jim Druckenmiller had the privilege to learn under Steve Young and he wound up an XFL reject.
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,2,Fri Jul 17 23:03:42 2015 UTC,The player himself is in control of his development to an extent. Having a poor offensive coordinator or multiple offensive coordinators within a few years span will absolutely hinder a player's development.
49ers,3do36y,Ma-teo,-5,Fri Jul 17 23:13:04 2015 UTC,"not ""absolutely""... people said that about Alex Smith and that may have been a factor but good QBs have a way of pushing through that stuff (i.e. Drew Brees). And Alex although he did well under Harbaugh, he definitely plateaued and is still the same serviceable game manager with KC.  Kap has been with the 49ers since 2011 and was coached mainly by Harbaugh. And that's not a bad teacher to have for 4 years straight.  Let's not blame Roman again or anyone else. Excuses become tiresome after a while."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,3,Fri Jul 17 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"You cite Brees. He also had a down period to start off his career. Actually he was fairly average to horrid from 2001-2003. He was benched at one point for ancient Doug Flutie. The Chargers were essentially ready to move on and drafted Philip Rivers in 2004. When contract talks stalled with Rivers, Brees went into the season as the starter by default. That is when the light clicked for him. He was a Pro Bowl caliber QB for San Diego for two years, and then went on to New Orleans and became an even bigger megastar under a coaching staff that knew how to utilize his abilities to the best they can be. So takes some time with some players.   Not everyone starts well out the gate. There is a great out the gate. There is a fantastic article by Bob McGinn on Rodgers development his first few years in Green Bay when he was a backup. The Packers were almost ready to move on from him. He wasn't showing anything special in preseason, he was having injury problems with a broken foot, and his overall attitude wasn't that great apparently. Then he changed his mindset and got his chance to be the starter in 2008 after Favre's antics were too much for the organization to tolerate anymore. Here is the read:  http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/rodgers-made-a-career-audible-with-packers-4p3loj7-136856133.html  It took a while for some other guys. Warren Moon and Dan Fouts both struggled their first few years, before they started dominating. Part of that was on them, and part of that was also on their organizations."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,2,Sat Jul 18 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"Actually he was fairly average to horrid from 2001-2003. He was benched at one point for ancient Doug Flutie. The Chargers were essentially ready to move on and drafted Philip Rivers in 2004.   At the time Brees was 22 years old. Yes ""not everyone starts well out the gate"", but when you're 28 as Kap will be when the season starts, the gate is a little ways back. And the time to learn to be an effective pocket passer (and by extension a top-tier NFL QB) is running out. Late bloomers like Rich Gannon and Brad Johnson are very rare.  And Warren Moon was already lighting it up in the CFL and could've easily played in the NFL earlier than he did. But back then being a black QB was problematic."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:12:12 2015 UTC,"So? Colin just completed his third year in the league as a starter. The light clicked on for Brees in his fourth season as a starter. Colin was also two years older than Brees when he came into the league.   The CFL and NFL aren't the same. Warren Moon strugged his first four seasons in Houston, playing some pretty bad ball. It took him a while to adjust to the talent left and condensed field size. It also took a while for Houston to acquire the necessary talent to help him. They really didn't take off until Jack Pardee replaced Jerry Glanville."

49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,3,Sat Jul 18 00:48:12 2015 UTC,"Oh but he was talented and had some solid stats in a Division I program. He was also rated as a first round talent and was the second first QB taken in the 1997 draft (Jake Plummer was the second)  The 49ers -and specifically Dwight Clark- dropped the ball when they didn't scout him as well as other teams did. There were intangibles (his personality, he was basically a dumbass who couldn't handle an NFL playbook, date rapist, etc) that should've raised a few flags, but... the 49ers had a sad legacy of poor draft picks in the 90's. Druck was one of the worst.  edit: Δ second to first"
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"But college is different than the NFL. He wasn't talented at the NFL level. That's what I meant. That entire draft was horrible as far as QB's were concerned. Jake Plummer was the only one that semi-panned out. And he had to go to a different team that knew how to utilize his talents, and wasn't complete garbage. He wasn't going to just push through his difficulties in Arizona. He needed a better situation."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"He wasn't going to just push through his difficulties in Arizona.   Well he kinda did, and even got them to the playoffs and beat the Cowpies during the tail end of the Aikman/Smith/Irvin years. Not a bad job when your owner is the horrible Bill Bidwill."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:49 2015 UTC,That doesn't make Jake a good quarterback at the time because the Cardinals beat an over-the-hill Cowboys team. What did Jake do after that the next four years in Arizona? If he pushed through his difficulties why did the Cardinals let go of him?
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:26:34 2015 UTC,"Bill is on record as saying he would have liked to seen us get Jake,and I believe he even lobbied for him to the powers that be before the draft.  Yup.The rest is history."
49ers,3do36y,MerryPrankster1967,2,Sat Jul 18 08:30:49 2015 UTC,Walsh? Not sure he was with the niners in any capacity in 1997.  Seifert and Clark were absolutely terrible at evaluating talent
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,3,Sat Jul 18 16:33:50 2015 UTC,He wasn't but he was still lobbying pretty hard for Jake by most accounts.I think he saw enough of Jake Vs Standford to know if anything that he was a more sure fire pick than Jim Drunkenmiller :D   I remember some of the first 49er websites and chat rooms dedicated to the 49ers were up in arms about JD after he was drafted.He did some ridiculous feat of strength type thing and everyone said thats why and the only reason why he was taken over Jake. 'Dat arm strength doe' type of deal.
49ers,3do36y,MerryPrankster1967,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:22 2015 UTC,The Druck actually went about 15 picks before Plummer.

I recall that I really wanted us to pick him, and then Dwight decided that that giant oaf from Virginia could learn the W. Coast offense."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Uhhh yeah ummm...Steve Young wouldn't have lasted in Tampa because well, his team was terrible. He wasn't going to develop there. You can overcome some minor obstacles like an inconsistent offensive line or receivers that drop a ball or can't get open every once in a while. However, if you're on a team that is just garbage from top down then your chances of being a successful QB are nill. You have to have talent to utilize. Not just a bunch of scrubs. As it relates to Colin he doesn't have that bad scenario, but my point is that every situation is different and folks shouldn't just chalk it up to ""QB determines development"" as if it's that clear, cut, and dry."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,0,Sat Jul 18 00:42:57 2015 UTC,"Steve Young wouldn't have lasted in Tampa because well, his team was terrible. He wasn't going to develop there.    You have no way of knowing that. And yes the QB through his own intelligence, work ethic and ability to be a team player does determine the trajectory of his development/career.  Steve would've been good in Tampa-- not as good as he was with the 49ers where we had the best offense coach of all time. But he had the IQ, and all the other intangibles to have a solid career as an NFL starter."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,2,Sat Jul 18 01:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yes I do, because he was terrible his two seasons there. And the Buccaneers would continue to be terrible until the late 90's. How was Steve Young to pan out under the conditions in Tampa when things kept getting worse for him? What players did he have around him? What coaches? There are some good organizations and bad organizations. Tampa was a bad one. Especially during that time when there was less scrutiny on teams doing bad. Hugh Culverhouse was notorious for cutting corners with the Buccaneers as the owner. He realized he could make money with owning a football franchise without having his team actually be successful or doing little to improve the franchise itself even down to the littlest things. It wasn't a shock that the team only started to improve after he died and was replaced by Malcom Glazer.   Steve Young not succeeding in Tampa is not an outlandish prediction to make because A) it was happening and B) there was no light at the end to the tunnel to suggest Steve's situation would improve, let alone he would be there much longer. The Buccaneers were horrible before and after Steve's tenure.   And no one is questioning Steve's football IQ or his talent overall. But at a certain point you still need quality players and coaches to help you succeed at your craft. Tampa wasn't the place for that."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"You don't, unless you have a crystal ball and then I'd stand corrected.  The Bucs were terrible. Yes Hugh Culverhouse was Ebenizer Scrooge personified, but that doesn't mean that a good QB wasn't going to progress and even do OK there. Yes Steve would've had a lower ceiling as far a accomplishments go (coaching plays an important role and the Bucs were cheap), but he could've still progressed and been good. No that doesn't mean Super Bowls of course because you need defense for that."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,2,Sat Jul 18 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"So you'd like Steve Young's chances of succeeding in Tampa at the time when he was with the franchise? Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. Everything I outlined is a conclusion with a basis to start. I could say that no one knows for certain that the sun is going to come up tomorrow, but I wouldn't like my chances in that assessment. Saying I don't have a crystal ball doesn't negate the probability based on the information provided that Steve would have continued to fail there. But if you'd like to offer a counter point as to how or why he would have succeeded there (like I asked you before) I'm all ears..."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:40 2015 UTC,"I said he would've succeeded to a degree, not at the same level as he did with the 49ers. The Bucs were doormats and may have eventually hit on a draft pick at another skill position. It's speculative, but it's far more plausible than being so certain of Steve's absolute failure in TB.  Archie Manning also succeeded to a degree and probably would've had multiple rings if he was on a better team. I guess people can call Archie a failure too."
49ers,3do36y,Bolinas99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Who did they have in Tampa though before, during, and after Steve Young was there that would have helped? What draft picks did they hit on that made a huge difference? Every franchise hits on a player or two obviously. Even the horrible ones like Tampa. That doesn't mean those organizations would be able to put together an entire unit of quality players that were capable of going places. Who in the organization would have spearheaded the sudden turnaround? Who would have supplanted the cost cutting owner? Saying the Buccaneers would have hit on a draft pick at another skilled position isn't a strong argument that Young would have had success. What existing evidence is there on the table that he would have succeeded? That's what I'm getting at. Everything we know to have happened, the evidence that is on the table, is indicative that he would have most likely failed if he stayed there.   And unfortunately Archie was a failure. He had talent, like Young. He was on the Saints his entire career though. They never won the divison or made the playoffs. Not even a winning record. Despite Archie's talent they Saints could never get beyond a certain point. Steve Young almost fell into the same situation. Luckily Tampa Bay thought he was garbage and traded him. Another sign of Tampa's incompetence at the time. They didn't even know when they had Hall of Fame talent on their roster, let alone know how to utilize it."
49ers,3do36y,Ness7891,0,Sat Jul 18 04:01:27 2015 UTC,One of those QB is NOT like the others.
49ers,3do36y,Frankocean2,5,Sat Jul 18 01:23:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with what Steve is saying, we lost a lot of our guys who are recognized and feared throughout the league. The ones we do still have had down years in 2014-2015 and now we have to re-earn that reputation without the patrick willis' and the frank gore's."

49ers,3do4m7,craighowser,2,Sat Jul 18 20:07:08 2015 UTC,What other metric can you use to measure average in this situation
49ers,3do4m7,NaVorroBooman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:03 2015 UTC,it depends what metric the writer of the list used to rank the QBs
49ers,3do4m7,craighowser,2,Sat Jul 18 22:49:46 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. There are 32 teams in the league. Being ranked in the top 16 makes the player above average. Being ranked in the bottom 16 makes the player below average. The writer ranked Kap 17th among QBs so the writer thinks he is below average. He did not compile multiple lists ranking different aspects of being a QB. One list ranking from 1-32. Anyway you slice it Kap would be below the ""average"" line."
49ers,3do4m7,NaVorroBooman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"not necessarily, the skill of QBs in the league could be top heavy or bottom heavy, both of which would skew where the average line would lie, only if their skill levels were a perfect bell curve would the median also be the average, which is almost impossible."
49ers,3do4m7,craighowser,0,Tue Jul 21 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"Well yes necessarily. So I'm not sure you understand how ranking works in statistics... Data transformation is always assumed when compiling a ranked list. So all ranked lists always have a uniform distribution, or a ""perfect bell curve"" as you said.   Here is an example that will help.   Say there are 10 students. The five students with the highest GPAs get a pizza party at the end of the year while the students with the bottom five GPAs have to go to summer school.   The students, their GPAs, and their rank:    Student GPA Rank    Mary 4.0 1   Phil 3.9 2   Kim 3.9 3   Daryl 3.5 4   Bob 1.8 5   Tom 1.7 6   Ken 1.5 7   Jane 1.4 8   Paul 1.2 9   Kate 0.3 10    Mary Phil Kim Daryl and Bob all get the pizza party while Tom Ken Jane Paul and Kate all have to go to summer school, even though it seems like Bob should be in summer school instead. The top five are the top five and the bottom five are the bottom five. Uniform distribution.  Once the data transformation has occurred GPA ceases to apply.   The same can be said of any ranked list. In the case of the article, the data transformation is the ""skill"" metric you mentioned, or any other metric the author decided to base his decision off of."

49ers,3do4m7,NoseDragon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:36 2015 UTC,My bad
49ers,3do4m7,polticalmind,-7,Fri Jul 17 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"Probably pocket passing, pocket awareness, and reading through his progressions? I love KAP but Cam clearly showed improvement this past season which gives him the edge. Im just surprised they ranked Tannehill & Bradford above him. Oh well!"
49ers,3do4m7,enjumuneer,10,Fri Jul 17 22:28:36 2015 UTC,None of what you wrote describes Cam Newton at all. It's actually a more accurate description of Tannehill honestly.
49ers,3do4m7,MrBot,5,Fri Jul 17 22:42:43 2015 UTC,Have we watched the same Cam? Lol I probably watched ~8 full Panther games this season and don't see any of that in Cam.
49ers,3do4m7,seejay12,10,Fri Jul 17 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"I saw a lot of high throws to a 6'6 receiver. It's pretty hard to throw over the head to a receiver like that, but he does it constantly."
49ers,3dlkyy,areyouhighbuddy,21,Fri Jul 17 06:50:09 2015 UTC,"Cowboy's first day coaching.  ""First, you need to be a big gigantic beastly man. Then you shove aside the smaller, weaker man in front of you."""
49ers,3dlkyy,cornskismo,4,Fri Jul 17 15:04:21 2015 UTC,And then you do it again and again nonstop until everyone in the league thinks you are a machine.
49ers,3dlkyy,ChocolateSunrise,5,Fri Jul 17 20:23:40 2015 UTC,Also don't feel pain. Always be able to recover from any injury.
49ers,3dlkyy,SirCunningLinguist,18,Fri Jul 17 23:56:57 2015 UTC,Just come help mentor your team. I can handle him doing that with no pads.
49ers,3dlkyy,Legndarystig,5,Fri Jul 17 06:50:43 2015 UTC,Player coach? The cowboy coaching in pads...I need new pants!
49ers,3dlkyy,rymarr,5,Fri Jul 17 08:50:08 2015 UTC,His presence would be great but who knows if he would be any good at coaching. This article alludes to him going back to Missouri and not back to the 49ers so the title is a bit misleading.
49ers,3dlkyy,Toolazytolink,2,Fri Jul 17 14:43:45 2015 UTC,Hopefully he does go and gain coaching experience and finally make his way back home to us.
49ers,3dlkyy,MrG,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"In my dreams I see Cowboy sticking around with the team this year, a surprise NFCW division run for the Niners and somewhere along the way there, Cowboy coming out of retirement to help cinch the NFCW and help bring home Lombardi #6 in front of the home crowd.  I mean, it's not that far-fetched, is it?"
49ers,3dlkyy,PMinisterOfMalaysia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:06 2015 UTC,step 1: be one bad motherfucker
49ers,3dlkyy,DMdoesGB,0,Fri Jul 17 21:57:06 2015 UTC,How amazing...just...speechless..
49ers,3dlkyy,TastyDonutHD,-14,Fri Jul 17 07:02:21 2015 UTC,maybe he can not make armstead a total bust
49ers,3dlkyy,buhhboyy,13,Fri Jul 17 08:31:24 2015 UTC,Calling a player a bust before he has even stepped onto the field? Why even waste your time posting a ridiculous comment?
49ers,3dlkyy,JaquiskiTaterTartt,-2,Fri Jul 17 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"He does have the making up a bust (high risk high reward, talented but raw), but I agree, way too early to call him a bust."
49ers,3dmy5r,whiskeydeltatango,4,Fri Jul 17 16:04:20 2015 UTC,I'm glad someone finally did a comprehensive analysis of this. It's satisfying to see that maybe our FO is not completely retarded. We have set ourselves up in a good position financially.   Now we just have to see how our young talent pans out and hope the Seahawks pay Russel Wilson a billion dollars and fuck the rest of their team over for a decade.
49ers,3dmy5r,nappythrill22,9,Fri Jul 17 18:38:11 2015 UTC,Not sure where the perception of our FO being retarted when it comes to player personnel would come from. Baalke built a roster that went to 3 straight championship games and we are finally out of salary cap hell. We have plenty of young players to fill the voids of players who have left. I think people tend to confuse the way Jed handled the firing of Harbaugh with Baalke and Marathe's ability to assemble a great roster. I didn't think that aspect of the job was ever in question.
49ers,3dmy5r,enjumuneer,3,Fri Jul 17 22:15:22 2015 UTC,I think people tend to confuse the way Jed handled the firing of Harbaugh with Baalke and Marathe's ability to assemble a great roster.   TBH I do kind of lump it all together even though I should be more nuanced in my feelings. I've just grown to have such vitriol for Jed that my take on all FO dealings has been clouded.
49ers,3dna1i,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:33:42 2015 UTC,Bethea should have been #1 for his performance last season.
49ers,3dna1i,seawied,2,Fri Jul 17 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"How well they are projected to play next season is a factor. I don't think Bethea will do bad, but the guys ahead of him are elite when on the field (Staley, Bowman, Smith)."
49ers,3dnris,MrG,2,Fri Jul 17 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't argue that they will be top of the division, but there's still a good chance that we, or even ARI makes the playoffs."
49ers,3dnris,seejay12,0,Fri Jul 17 22:50:29 2015 UTC,Gooooood gooooood NFL sportswriters.....let your HATE flow through you!  http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/shutdown-countdown--hard-to-be-optimistic-about-the-49ers-144612030.html
49ers,3dnris,Pit_of_Death,5,Fri Jul 17 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"what ""hate""? Didn't see anything belligerent, crass or offensive aimed at the 49ers players or the fans.   sometimes the truth is unpleasant. These are the same writers who had us going to our second Super Bowl after the BAL loss, and they were accurate about the strength of our roster back then."
49ers,3dnris,Bolinas99,0,Fri Jul 17 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"It just feels like the 49ers' most recent era of success, which started when Harbaugh arrived, has come and gone.   Sportswriters love to jump onto an opportunity to discount the Niners, especially after the past two offseasons. I would prefer to be underdogs."
49ers,3dnris,Pit_of_Death,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:30:53 2015 UTC,"yeah but discounting a team when the circumstances justify it is far from being ""hateful"".   Even the people in the know (the casinos) know that the 49ers aren't going to do a whole lot this year (40 to 1 SB odds). And when it comes to Kap here's what the bookmakers say:   ""They like [Kaepernick] and think he can do it. I'm not convinced,"" Dave Cudney, manager of Harrah's and Harveys Race & Sports Book said. ""But so many fans are (convinced), and we get so much action from them. They have faith. There's a lot of faithful.""   It's ok to be optimistic when it's justified. Being oblivious and a googgly-eyed Pollyanna however, is how fans get played for suckers."
49ers,3dnris,Bolinas99,-5,Fri Jul 17 21:54:23 2015 UTC,ESPN is the fox news of sports. Idc what they say
49ers,3dnris,Realik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"not an ESPN fan (and yeah Fox can eat shit), but even a broken clock is right twice a day.  given all that's happened to our roster this offseason, the coaching changes (a net downgrade and not necessarily referring to Harbaugh here), we'll be lucky to win 6 games.   Hope I'm wrong; I'll gladly eat my words"
49ers,3dnris,Bolinas99,0,Fri Jul 17 20:52:01 2015 UTC,Ill gladly hand feed them to you too
