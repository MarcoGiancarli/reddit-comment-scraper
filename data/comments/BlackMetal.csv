BlackMetal,3drva1,nromolo6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:48:00 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure. It seems like they just kind of disappeared
BlackMetal,3drl5f,AStraightLine,3,Sat Jul 18 19:52:45 2015 UTC,"Sure we have had Atmoblack, DSBM, Pagan Black, Orthodox, Bestial Black and all of that since but these are not main branches off the Metal tree.   those may not be considered main branches of the metal or musical tree but they are full fledged genres to me. i think what we have now is the age of a billion different micro-movements or what fenriz called ""the myriads"", where although many are rebelling against the norm and creating niches, it's not a unified movement that everyone identifies with. and i think this is the norm nowadays and the age of everyone uniting under the flag of metal or whatever and evolving together to undermine the existing trend- is gone. instead we have individualized fetishes and obsessions that gather a little momentum when like-minded people get together, but many of these little movements are just as vital as the greatest pioneers of the past.  tl;dr: i just rambled and ended up saying nothing in particular"
BlackMetal,3drl5f,deadboltduck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah I see your point, though I don't think any of those sub-genre / myriads could ever be considered as detailed and explored as the encompassing genres like Black and Death etc.  Also something in that idea upsets me, like there will never be another large scale innovation, just little bits and new themes every now and then."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,2,Sat Jul 18 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"Also something in that idea upsets me, like there will never be another large scale innovation, just little bits and new themes every now and then.   TBF, unlikely as it seems, it could well happen- I highly, highly fucking doubt that anyone in 1975 thought that sounds like Autopsy would exist just fifteen years later."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,riboch,2,Sun Jul 19 07:24:09 2015 UTC,"Whatever major movement occurs in the future, I imagine it will embrace technology, new instruments beyond what *core/prog metal have, rebel against new cultural norms, and will all be considered ""local"" phenomena.  I have a few expectations: politically dissident metal in the East (Russia and China) as well as Central and Southern America incorporating traditional instruments, anti-islam metal incorporating local instruments in the middle east, ""peace/anti-tribal"" metal in Africa.  As for the west, I expect three things:    more women to enter and set off a whole new set of metal, one-man bands that will use artificially generated sounds/samples, and aesthetically pleasing sounds to a wider audience.   My justification is because these are things that are missing.    To expand upon /u/deadboltduck's comments, technology has been like a prism to music and has caused us to see an entire spectrum of music arise, e.g. Violet Cold who has infused blackgaze with pop (listen to La Petite Mort).  Culturally, we may see lenses focus efforts every now and then, but exceedingly unlikely that we see a whole new genre appear out of a vacuum.    As for upcoming styles: blackgaze/atmospheric but with classical instruments: brass, strings, and percussion; new forms of period metal: e.g. steampunk, victorian, swing (1920's); as well as new subject matter, everyone uses Tolkien, but maybe people will move to Orson Scott Card, or some other prolific writer like Stephen King."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,noarkjokes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like the fact that Deafheaven played Bonnaroo and that thousands of stoner bros were down with it is a sign that blackened music will start to be more ""socially acceptable"" like metalcore is now...   I saw an article a while back asking if the ""future of metal is riffless"" and I'd have to say I think it might be... I think things can only get more noisy/abstract/chaotic from here and arythmia would really be the logical backlash to the overly rhythmic/groovy breakdowns that make metalcore so popular.   EDIT: So I guess what I'm saying is that ""noise"" (for lack of a better term) will start to become a larger and more explored branch of metal."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,winterrwonderland,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to think of the emergence of new genre based on an outright rejection of postmodern Leftism and the associated ideological and cultural ethos (eg. egalitarianism, multiculturalism, etc.)  I do not know what such a subgenre would sound like, but a sound that harkens back to the ""good old days"" would be consistent with its values and general neoreactionary stance."

BlackMetal,3drl5f,Sanity_Assasin,0,Mon Jul 20 05:44:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I think something new will come as a result of disgust with mainstream Metalcore. Much like how Thrash came about due to a dislike of Glam Metal and Black Metal came about as a result of this hatred of more fancy, technical Death Metal, something will likely come about in response to Metalcore. That, or people will just bitch about it on the internet. But what really needs to happen, is enough young people need to be upset about Metalcore."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,_skeletontoucher,2,Sat Jul 18 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"Is it possible this rebellion could be showing up in bands such as Young And In The Way, Trap Them, Mammoth Grinder? It seems a small population of older metalcore fans (including myself) seem to be migrating to this genre that I can only, in my ignorance, describe as slightly blackened speed/powerviolence. But they don't necessarily go as far as Pig Destroyer, for example."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,Captain_Man,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"I've got heavily into bands a la Iskra recently, so a more directly raw black metal style hardcore/crust than Trap Them, for example, and are more consistently aggressive in a hardcore sort of way than YAITW, and don't go so far into grindcore as many seem to do.  Oathbreaker's another great one too.  Obviously crust's been in the world since the 80s, and Iskra was one of the first bands to do the blackened crust thing so it's not a super-new genre, but I guess a lot of the inspiration the newer wave of bands would be taking is from shit like that."
BlackMetal,3drl5f,Sanity_Assasin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yep the visibility and incorrect general public opinion of Metalcore and Deathcore could cause, I know in college I was very annoyed that people thought Metalcore and Deathcore was Metal and therefore assumed that's what I listened to when I explained I was into metal.  But what do you think could come as a rebellion against that, all I can see is a conservative revival of the original sounds of metal, much like what Fenriz is doing and calling for."

BlackMetal,3dqimt,AStraightLine,2,Sat Jul 18 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"I get why you would recommend this to Urfaust fans, it's pretty good.  But for some reason I can't really stand the vocals. It's the guy that did Heidevolk for a long time, and I really don't know why, but I just don't like his vocals. But that's absolutely personal preference, because he is in fact a great singer.  I'm going to leave this here for you guys. I think you'll like this. These vocals are quite similar to Urfaust's harsh, vibrato inspired, weird, slightly deranged sounding vocal style."

The whole point of you doing this is to remove the availability and charge an exorbitant price to someone who actually wants the limited release. Stop trying to make a quick buck, let another interested person enjoy the release."
BlackMetal,3do7r4,poopthrash,10,Fri Jul 17 22:42:22 2015 UTC,If you are buying multiple copies because you are a crazy collector or getting some for friends I'm totally fine with it.  If you are flipping them on Ebay/Discogs then fuck you.
BlackMetal,3do7r4,Brozhov,5,Sat Jul 18 00:41:29 2015 UTC,It feels a bit.. off. When someone orders more than one copy a die-hard edition or whatever from us I feel a bit weird but we have no rules against it.

BlackMetal,3do7r4,deadboltduck,2,Sat Jul 18 00:46:59 2015 UTC,Yes.  I've seen a lot of labels limit the number one person can purchase for that very reason.

BlackMetal,3dkpc0,DeviState,0,Fri Jul 17 03:12:39 2015 UTC,Damn that's a fine album. My only problem with it is I think it could have benefited from better production quality.
BlackMetal,3dkpc0,DeviState,5,Fri Jul 17 03:54:08 2015 UTC,I think the poor quality makes it what it is.
BlackMetal,3dkpc0,DeviState,0,Fri Jul 17 04:26:12 2015 UTC,On most BM albums I would agree with the use of a low fi approach but emperor has a lot of intricacies that get lost in the mix. I want it produced to the quality of like IX equilibrium or anthems.
BlackMetal,3dkpc0,Cabal_stgm,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:12 2015 UTC,Anthems was really well produced I agree.

Satanic Warmaster is a little harsher than Dissection, though, so if you're more into that style, try Sargeist. Ohtar's ""When I Cut the Throat"" is sort of halfway between the two."

Horna, Behexen and Sargeist are all excellent. Sühnopfer is also definitely recommended from my end, but I think they're more of a different ilk.  For Dissection, here are some not yet mentioned:   Stortregn Vinterland Unanimated Necrophobic Aorlhac   For Satanic Warmaster, try:   Eternity Ritual Nattfog Clandestine Blaze Isvind"

BlackMetal,3d9d8r,aderptoremember,7,Tue Jul 14 14:58:26 2015 UTC,here is one that i dreamt about for a long time:  FINAL TRIBUTE TO THE BLACK LEGIONS  Black Cilice/Manierisme/Jute Gyte
BlackMetal,3d9d8r,deadboltduck,3,Tue Jul 14 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"Jute gyte doesn't sound like an LLN band. At least not to my ears. Close with black cilice but I'm not familiar with the other one (I'll have to look into it). If you're interested in more bands like that there's a great scene in Portugal beyond BC. Mons veneris in particular sounds a lot like LLN bands, with a very uncomfortable sound and a lot of improvisation. Irae, cripta oculta, and vetala are all good, but vary in how similar they are to 90s French scene. And all these bands do great splits with each other. Check it out"
BlackMetal,3d9d8r,AcidBastard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"my reason for picking jute gyte is mainly that i wanted to pair up current bands that are equivalents of the 3 main LLN projects: black cilice for vlad tepes, manierisme for mutiilation, and jute gyte for belketre - of whom i could not think of any better replacement. i am a new fan to the basque scene, and downloaded some 10 releases a while ago that i'm still going through. they are all making perfect music and i want to establish in my mind some classics before i go for a second batch, definitely will include mons veneris and irae among them when the time comes."
BlackMetal,3d9d8r,deadboltduck,2,Tue Jul 14 23:43:05 2015 UTC,You won't be disappointed. In fact you may change your choice for a modern belketre once you give Mons veneris a listen
BlackMetal,3d9d8r,AcidBastard,6,Tue Jul 14 23:52:30 2015 UTC,"Mamaleek/Peste Noire   Interesting combo, I'd be interested to hear that.  To add to the conversation, a Blut Aus Nord/Deathspell Omega split would kill me."
BlackMetal,3d9d8r,Xcsl,2,Wed Jul 15 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, that would be incredible. It would work better if Blut Aus Nord did their earlier creepy style of black metal instead of their current atmoblack though."
BlackMetal,3d9d8r,HackTheRipper666,2,Wed Jul 15 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think it would fit well with Deathspell's content. Granted I think whatever style Blut Aus Nord goes with, it will totally be an awesome fit with DsO."

There's honestly not much similarity between Weakling and all the artists they apparently inspired - no Cascadian BM is nearly as fucking bleak."
BlackMetal,3cxahl,RNGmaster,2,Sun Jul 12 03:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's easy to see pieces of Weakling in other USBM, but I think most Cascadian BM has a much more watered down sound in general."
BlackMetal,3cxahl,noarkjokes,2,Sun Jul 12 05:37:09 2015 UTC,"Serious question, why are they even considered ""cascadian black metal""?  First time I listened to Dead As Dreams I had exactly zero info about weakling aside from hearing that a lot of my friends recommended them. I listed to the album and loved it.  Got online to see if I could find their discography and, much to my dismay, discover that they only had one album. I also discovered that people grouped them into the cascadian black metal sound, which I can't even hear, possibly because I'm not sure what elements are required to make them fall in to that category. So can someone explain to me what I'm missing? What about this record makes it cascadian black metal?"
BlackMetal,3cxahl,plainoldasshole,-3,Sun Jul 12 08:04:58 2015 UTC,"Well both Weakling and Wolves In The Throne Room have ridiculous logos that look like ""tribal"" tramp-stamps.  So there's a similarity, I guess.  I didn't know ""Cascadian blackmetal"" was a thing.  Is it all wussy and boring like WITTR?"
BlackMetal,3cxahl,UnezkaTurigahl,2,Sun Jul 12 09:21:31 2015 UTC,"First off, I love WITTR so I'm just going to ignore that statement.  Secondly, from what I understand cascadian is a term to describe bands in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Washington. Sound-wise, basically atmospheric black metal. A couple other bands that fall into the cascadian genre include Ash Borer, Deafheaven. Also, Weakling was a huge influence on the sound for cascadian, so I guess that's why they threw Weakling in the mix."

Thats a direct quote, so by that what i took was he believes the African has qualities ruined by mixing with white/european as well as vice versa.

BlackMetal,3cwjqi,UnezkaTurigahl,3,Sat Jul 11 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Varg's RPG, ""MYFAROG"", is rather Euro-centric, as most fantasy is.  BUT!  You can choose play a race that is not European-inspired if you wish, as long as you're alright being called a Weakling or a Darkling, and having lesser stats than the European flavored races.  The Weaklings and Darklings are also described as all being criminals, 'filthy"", ""vulgar"", uneducated animals who have no will to better themselves.  I'd say that makes Varg's views on non-Europeans pretty clear."

Being used to nigger music and nigger or Jew lyrics they need to become used to the lyrics first, and then they can be introduced to real Aryan music. That's why I can support these ""half-way"" to the right way bands. That is pretty much the role of old Burzum as well, to be a 'gateway to Heaven'. You become what you listen to (mentally), so I deem it very important that we promote Aryan music to our Aryan race. This as well, is a part of the struggle. This way we can save our collective mental and spiritual health as well. Instead of primitive, degenerate, subhuman mentality promoted by the nigger (pop) music today, we can educate and 'heal' our race with Aryan music, promoting. Aryan ideals like honesty, justice, honour, faithfulness, strength, courage, respect, nature awareness and so on.   Oh, Varg, you're so silly."

But I'm a total WASP so I guess I can't really understand things from your position.  I will say this though, seeing a black person wearing any sort of metal shirt or spotting a black person at a metal show is like finding a fucking unicorn.  Despite metal generally being a white sausagefest,  Metalheads have generally seemed accepting of all types from what I've seen, and I think most Burzum fans just like the music and don't give a shit about Varg's ramblings.

BlackMetal,3cpcv4,apolotary,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:15:58 2015 UTC,"Ah! I recalled one more thing - there was this word, not used anymore, 'pomroka', which roughly translates as 'complete darkness', as well as 'complete lack of understanding' (probably there's a similar in Russian - probably also from old Slavonic, or we even borrowed it from your language, which, to be honest, happened a LOT ;) ). 'Mgła' and 'pomoroka' were sometimes used interchangeably, but that's no longer the case - contemporary polish language uses 'mgła' strictly to describe fog, mist etc. But historically yes, there was the exact same connotation with darkness.  Damn, I never suspected I'll use my notes from historical grammar here ;)  So yes, if we take the historical meaning of the word in polish, it's associated with darkness as well as with mist.

BlackMetal,3cfthu,dimeadozen09,4,Tue Jul 7 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"The guys name is Mikael ""Nattramn"" Nilsson. He still makes music (kind of), and was for a period of time in a mental facility. However he never attacked a girl with an axe. It was his brother who did it. His brother was in a psychotic rage at that time. Afterwards, he committed suicide because he couldn't bear the idea of him almost killing a child. Nattramn was shocked by his brother's suicide and never got over it. He wrote a book of poetry, its hard to find, but rather good. This is (aprently) the only website that has anything of his available: http://www.humanianimaliliberati.com/nattramn.htm  you can order his solo record here: http://shop.humanianimaliliberati.com/Diagnose-Lebensgefahr-Transformalin-2LP-CONTAMINATED-edition-HAL012-CONTAMINATED.htm"
BlackMetal,3cfthu,thefrozendivide,3,Tue Jul 7 18:31:22 2015 UTC,I don't get why someone would think he replaced his hands with the pig feet. On the pictures you can clearly see that the pig feet are only attached to his hands and that his hands are still there.

The new Caina album is basically in that style but their old stuff is less consistent. Gehenna (the American ones) tend to vary in style a lot between releases, but some of their stuff is very raw, crusty black metal. On the more hardcore-oriented side of things there's stuff like Let It Die, Black Veins, Old Skin and Esoteric Youth. They're definitely not black metal, but it has a similar feel. There's also a label called Yamabushi Recordings that mostly puts out bands that sound half way between 80's hardcore and the black legions, so that might appeal to you if you like YAITW."
BlackMetal,3cf45y,WarCommand,2,Wed Jul 8 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"Thx for the detailed reply! I know (and like) Ancst already, I absolutely forgot about Caina, I used to listen to their ""Hands That Pluck"" album, but that was a few years ago. It was a nice and more atmospheric record, if I remember right. Think I give them a new chance. And of course I know Gehenna, but they where never my cup of tea. As for the rest - I'll work through it. Thx again!"

BlackMetal,3bywvj,prelapsus,2,Fri Jul 3 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"One of the most hypnotic live bands I've ever seen. Given how hot and full the room was, and the fact that I was heavily intoxicated, it felt almost hallucinatory."

BlackMetal,3bwpv0,lasyke3,3,Thu Jul 2 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"Well their output is uneven, for example this album is loads better then his others.  I think it's a well known project among bm fans, as it was one of the first us bands playing traditional black metal."

BlackMetal,3busnn,shitterbug,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that actually would have been my second guess"
BlackMetal,3busnn,Filth_catalyst,3,Fri Jul 3 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"The thing with inspiration is, at least in  my opinion, that you should look outside of the genre you're working in yourself. Otherwise you'll just copy someone else's sound!  To write good black metal I don't really think you should listen to and get too much inspiration from there.  Instead, look at all the late 60's and early 70's psychedelic rock bands that used the sitar, especially british bands."
BlackMetal,3busnn,Sla5021,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"I've been doing my best with that concept, actually. As I said in my post I've been listening to a lot of Amorphis and Om looking for ideas and have likewise spent time focused on Ravi Shankar, The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, etc., but for whatever reason I'm getting more ideas for djent-prog stuff from them rather than anything kvlt.   What I feel I need at this point is something which would work with the styles of early Mayhem, Shining, Xasthur, etc., something to show me how it's done just as a demonstration."
BlackMetal,3busnn,automaticfantastic,3,Fri Jul 3 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"If Taake can play a banjo, you can figure this out.  Rip it up. Drone solos for daze."
BlackMetal,3busnn,Maledicte,2,Thu Jul 2 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but Taake didn't do anything very interesting with that banjo solo. It was tacked on like an afterthought. Dig deep, OP. Think about how you can really weave it into the music. Maybe the way that Fell Voices bookends Regnum Saturni with that bellows drone -- is it a harmonium or a shruti box? Dunno, but it rips hard."

BlackMetal,3bokao,NovemberComingFire,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"Really surprised this hasn't been uploaded.  Actually pretty different than their other tracks - less progressive song structures with awesome chorus, folk instruments, and bagpipe/whistle interlude.  I wish he went further in this direction."
BlackMetal,3bokao,PerAsperaAdInferi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, the folk elements in this song are really awesome. I prefer his other stuff overall though.  The only actual problem with this song, is that if you listen to the whole EP, with this one tacked on at the end, it's a totally different production style, so it kinda breaks the flow of the album."
BlackMetal,3bokao,Stinkfished,0,Wed Jul 1 01:59:43 2015 UTC,That's great it's like an American Agalloch.

BlackMetal,3bkf3i,AveLucifer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:11:09 2015 UTC,That is a compilation album from HHR. It's actually got a bunch of great war metal/Blasphemy worship bands on it.

BlackMetal,3bjwbw,Wulfgar_One_Eye,6,Mon Jun 29 20:50:22 2015 UTC,I don't think she's made any attempt to hide the fact Ulver and Garm are her biggest inspirations and why she wants to make music.
BlackMetal,3bjwbw,colourofspace,-5,Mon Jun 29 23:16:30 2015 UTC,Recycling classic works from 20 years ago and making stupid artsy music videos on a major label is just so played out and ridiculous.
BlackMetal,3bjwbw,Wulfgar_One_Eye,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:34:57 2015 UTC,Well Garm did co-produce the album and I'm sure he had a lot of influence on the sound...
BlackMetal,3bjwbw,Wulfgar_One_Eye,-5,Mon Jun 29 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"There's a difference in the influence of a producer and lifting melodies from other works.  She's just a ""pretty face"" with the ability to strum monotonous power chords and basic scale tremolo riffs and add distortion and tons of layers of effects to her vocals to pass it off as black metal."
BlackMetal,3bjwbw,thetrvebvtthvrt,2,Mon Jun 29 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"take the word pretty face from that sentence and that describes a disturbing percentage of black metal going all the way back to the 90s. the conventions of the genre make it easy for people of less practiced musical ability to make listenable things. is that good or bad? its all in the eye of the beholder. in my opinion, if i was going to listen to rote hackneyed music, i'd listen to the one by the chanel model and not the fat nazi clown, provided she'd show me her body while doing it."
BlackMetal,3bjwbw,deadboltduck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:06:40 2015 UTC,personally i find the fat nazi clown much easier to relate to. she has a better singing voice than garm though. upvoted for living up to your username.

BlackMetal,3ate0x,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:49:24 2015 UTC,"Slavonic Chronicles:       Slavonic Chronicles is an EP released by Ukrainian black metal band Drudkh on September 20, 2010 (see 2010 in music), on the French label Season of Mist. It was released in two formats: as a 10"" LP and as a mini CD. The last one is available only as a part of a deluxe leather book edition of Drudkh's 2010 full-length album, Handful of Stars, strictly limited to 600 copies.   Slavonic Chronicles consists of two cover versions of tracks by Slavic black metal bands: ""Tam Gdzie Gaśnie Dzień..."" (originally by the Polish band Sacrilegium, taken from a split with Polish band North, titled Jesienne Szepty) and ""Indiánská Píseň Hrůzy"" (originally by Czech band Master's Hammer, taken from the album Šlágry). It was generally well received due to its stylistic similarity with classic Drudkh works like Blood in Our Wells, as opposed to the almost post-rock sound of Handful of Stars.  The Sacreligium cover was dedicated ""to our Polish brothers fallen in September 1939"", and because the group was unsuccessful in contacting Sacreligium for the song's lyrics, the lyrics in the Drudkh version come from the Ukrainian poet Vadym Lesych (1909–1982).

BlackMetal,3asxrw,satanridesbikes,-1,Tue Jun 23 12:41:45 2015 UTC,"I really hope you are a writer for a music blog or magazine. This was great. My pop is an old punk that's 'been there done that' and I was raised around a lot of punk music. When I became a teenager and started finding my own music that wasn't his UK Subs or Agnostic Front I was still in to punk. I remember one time telling him how I thought a band had 'sold out'. He reminded me that what happens when a band plays together for 15+ years is that they get good at playing their instruments. That if I liked their older shit it's still out there and it's that simple for me to put that record on. If i don't like the new shit it's more than likely that I am being stubborn and too punk for good music.   That always stuck with me. So the debate with Deafheaven is obnoxious. It's really good. They are talented bands and no one is forced to listen to them. Like you said they have never claimed black metal, but it also shouldn't be such a bad thing that they are labeled as such. If black metal has evolved in to something more than a bunch of whiney white dudes recording riffs into a tin can toput on cassette then is it such a bad thing?"
BlackMetal,3asxrw,Illoomorpheme,10,Tue Jun 23 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think their riffs are weak and they are not particularly interesting, but not the worst. It's just boring to me."
BlackMetal,3asxrw,DustbinK,2,Tue Jun 23 16:17:16 2015 UTC,Riffs aren't exactly the point of shoegaze and literally 100% against the point of post-rock. I would argue that you can't have riffs at all to truly be a post-rock band.

BlackMetal,3asxrw,killinmyname,8,Thu Jun 25 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they're great. Had a passing interest when I heard Roads To Judah, but I bit on Sunbather harder than I have on a record in quite some time. For what they do, love it or otherwise, they do it quite well.  It seems to me that presentation has a lot to do with the vitriol they receive. Basically, they don't look or (totally) sound the part, and the people I see and hear talk about them tend to lump them into black metal without a good deal of rhyme or reason. Same reason a lot of people have a problem with the influx of ""Cascadian"" bands that have popped up over the last few years. Lack of orthodox visual aesthetic, themes dealing with depression and isolation but not suicidal, no Satan, and visually kinda hipster-looking. Also, it would be pertinent to mention that they only really borrow from the black metal sound, and from that only enough to claim some sort of loose influence (although the influence does indeed sound sincere). Enough to certainly boil the blood of more staunch fans of the genre.  Mostly, I think its their broader appeal that makes them so polarizing among people who are into black metal. Borrowing from a genre that is terribly anti-commercial to become almost commercially viable is one of the more heinous things to do, according to most people in the scene I've come across. However, I find their sound a bit more unique, and therefore refreshing. Wouldn't ever lump them in with what we all know as black metal, though."
BlackMetal,3asxrw,Vulkanon,3,Sat Jun 27 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"I really like them and I also really like traditional black metal and other weird esoteric subgenres. That's all it is to me, not some 'new scene of black metal' or whatever, just something some people will like and some won't. Don't see why there has to be hate because it's different, and as far as being hipsters go just remember you like a genre that still releases independent cassette tapes like a tradition."
BlackMetal,3asxrw,Spedmonger,2,Tue Jun 23 09:07:55 2015 UTC,Not really my cup of tea. I think they're boring overall but I don't hate them or anything.

BlackMetal,3asxrw,meatpuppet79,6,Tue Jun 23 10:12:59 2015 UTC,"They're divisive because to many they are pretentious, mastabatory hipsters playing at some fantasy of black metal but actually achieving its very antithesis. And then there are a lot of young (American) fans who've had their black metal  experience shaped by this, some Burzum and Wolves in the Throne Room, and for them, this is black metal. Each to their own and all that bullshit. Trollhorn of Finntroll and Moonsorrow sums it up pretty well: http://yersiniafestis.blogspot.fi/2014/12/you-call-your-metal-black-its-just.html  Personally, I hate them for being shallow, self conscious shadows of black metal... my-first-black-metal for scene kids, and for the above reasons too, I guess."
BlackMetal,3asxrw,prof_shine,3,Sun Jun 28 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"This makes sense to me, and mirrors my frustration at the state of ""emo"" since the mid-90s. I came of age in the early/mid-90s punk/hardcore scene, and really took to the bands that were called ""emo"" or ""emocore"". It was raw and gritty, and occasionally heavy, but had an emotional edge. Then everyone started trying to sound like Sunny Day Real Estate and The Promise Ring, and the ""-core"" was all but forgotten. Within a few years ""emo"" meant ""whiny indie-pop"". Then it became a hairstyle and jokes about self-harm. I miss the days when it meant screaming your head off in basements to a bunch of crusty depressed punk kids about alienation and self-loathing.  So yeah, I empathize with the frustration that something you love is being corrupted into something unrecognizable. Here's hoping that ""black metal"" roots will always be remembered, and not just ""blast beats and screaming vocals""."

BlackMetal,3asxrw,apocalyptan,4,Tue Jun 23 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"They've repeatedly stated in interviews that they don't really see themselves as being a black metal band:    We’re just a band. The black metal thing makes my hair curl, because we get the question all the time, like, “How do you feel about being alienated from the metal community?” I’m like, “Are we, really?” I mean, we have other stuff going on, but anyone that hears Sunbather can clearly see that it’s extremely metal. I still listen to black metal all the time-- that’s obviously one of my favorite kinds of music-- but I steer from it very strongly these days. Are we even a metal band? I don’t know. I just want to ask people if they like it. If you don’t like it, that’s fine-- get the fuck out of my way. If you did, thank you, let’s hang out.   Your use of ad-hominem at the band members and linking to a pretty ""get off my lawn"" blog post (much respect to Finntroll/and especially Moonsorrow, but ""Wolves in the Clone Room""? Really? ""Curzum"" got a laugh though) makes me think you have a whole complex against what you perceive to be their fanbase and the media attention they've received, rather than any substantiated claim against the music beyond ""I don't like it and I don't like that kids like it and call it black metal"""
BlackMetal,3asxrw,meatpuppet79,2,Tue Jun 23 20:12:48 2015 UTC,I find them boring and derivative and pretentious and happily feeding on the carrion of actual black metal is all. As for ad hominem attacks and dislike of their fans? Boohoo. Welcome to black metal.
BlackMetal,3asxrw,DustbinK,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"pretentious and happily feeding on the carrion of actual black metal is all.    Still nothing to do with the music here. Disliking their fans or the members is fine, I'm hardly going to begrudge you that, but doesn't really reflect on the music at all.    boring and derivative   There you go. Of course, similar critiques applies to plenty of 'actual' black metal as well, but at least it can be seen as a judgment of the music itself, not whatever ideal of them you've created in your head.   As for accusing them of dealing in some ""fantasy of black metal"", I think you're the one with a fantasy if you really think the genre of black metal (which we can denote through the use of particular musical elements) is going to somehow remain exclusively connected to the particular ideological and visual aesthetic associated with its origins, despite having exploded in global popularity. But that's another discussion :)"
BlackMetal,3asxrw,meatpuppet79,2,Tue Jun 23 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"Happily feeding on the carrion of black metal is everything about the music. They have made every effort to 'borrow' the sounds and signatures of black metal, but when they are called out for being boring and derivative (of black metal), they insist ""oh no, we aren't actually black metal at all!"" The fact they are being discussed here, (and were spammed in this sub endlessly until they were banned) should give some hints as to how far they've aped the genre."

BlackMetal,3asxrw,NovemberComingFire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree about black metal staying underground only. I thought so before, but I have changed my mind. The idea about underground, selling little and only to ""true"" people, not earning money, not thinking that you are bigger than your fans and so on, everything comes from Hardcore. And how the hell we can know who are ""true"" and who are not, as most of the people who call themselves true are just normal idiots. original black metal bands such as Venom never had to be in underground to be accepted! Then why should we? The underground is both a means for the hardcore people to put us down and control us (at least it was before, they have mostly disappeared now but their ideas still linger on), and a bad exuse for bad bands to be eequal with great bands. Those who scream most about being in ""underground"" is also often those who make so bad music that they don't have a chance to get big themselves. I think that if we could make black metal bigger than it is now, we could have a great movement growing with hundreds of brutal soldiers spreading sorrow, death and evil in the world. Just look at the punks and the MC-people, they don't have to think about this, and they have came to a point that they have their own worlds with their own womrn, their own pubs, their own concert places, and so on. We will never be able to do the same if we work hard to earn as little money as possible in order not to be commercial. We must get rid of the ""underground"" ideas. The real underground have nothing to do with this. It's of course not right if people start playing blaack metal in order to become rich and nothing more (then they should choose some other music style anyway!), but there is something in between. I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change my ways of thinking and being, which is the real important being here. If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us. - Euronymous   Obviously people who want their black metal to sound like Katharsis and Blasphemy only won't find much to dig about Deafheaven but I totally disagree about this whole ""black metal wasn't meant to be big!"" notion. And the idea that it was never supposed to be arty? If anything it's one of the most artistically serious genres out there and has always been that way even from the first wave with a band like Celtic Frost."
BlackMetal,3asxrw,alienardo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"I of course was using 'arty' in a facetious fashion to highlight the pretentious mimicry for the sake of fashion that a lot of these new American bands seem so anxious to bring, and their fans so anxious to defend.

She does amazing woodcarving tattoos, as well as dark surrealism like Beksinski/Kittelsen/Giger, and blackmetal themed tattoos."

BlackMetal,3a1g8d,horizontii,4,Wed Jun 17 01:53:24 2015 UTC,Joseph Deegan from Slidhr is a tattoo artist.  I would also recommend Daniel Corcuera(Nekronikon) Wrest from Leviathan is also a tattoo artist.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,Abandoninghope,3,Tue Jun 16 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any specifically ""black metal"" tattoo artists, but in my experience the tattoo community has a greater proportion of metal fans than the general population. I would recommend deciding on the type of tattoo you want to get; portrait, script, band logo, or maybe even something more abstract yet still metal themed, and search for artists who specialise in that type of art. For this Instagram is your friend and allows you to find amazing artists from all over the world and lets you browse their portfolio with ease. I want to get a black metal themed tattoo myself, but am currently finishing some other work first. I did have some success searching for inspiration on IG for fan art of artists or bands. There are a huge number of talented but undiscovered artists around.    Sorry I can't point you in a definite direction, but patience and Instagram are your friends in this situation!"

BlackMetal,3a1g8d,Sla5021,3,Wed Jun 17 02:03:54 2015 UTC,Jef Whitehead (aka Wrest) from Leviathan is a tattoo artist. I couldn't find information on where his studio is located but if you contacted him on Facebook I'm sure he could help you out.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,BlackArtsTattooer,3,Tue Jun 16 15:06:31 2015 UTC,He is located at his his and Stevie's shop in Portland. I think he's on a break from tattooing for a minute because he broke his hand.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,Sla5021,4,Tue Jun 16 18:31:39 2015 UTC,Stevie is also a hell of a tattooer.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,BlackArtsTattooer,3,Tue Jun 16 19:57:03 2015 UTC,Yeah she is. Jef has been one of my favorites since way back when I walked into a shop to get my second tattoo and saw his flash on the wall. Stevie I just discovered a few years ago and she is also amazing. They both have great immediately recognizable styles.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,Sla5021,4,Tue Jun 16 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"No one does a skull like Jef....and IF they do, they stole it from him."

BlackMetal,3a1g8d,Sla5021,3,Tue Jun 16 20:40:41 2015 UTC,For real. The guy worked at Ed Hardy's Tattoo City with Corbin and Higgs and plenty of other huge names.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,FraterQayin,3,Tue Jun 16 22:57:38 2015 UTC,Thank fuck. About time someone on reddit knows what's up.
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,forcehatin,3,Tue Jun 16 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"People into BM often miss the point that Jef is actually better known as a tattooer. He's worked in some big name shops and with some big name guys. We are talking lineage stretching back to Ed Hardy and beyond. He's no slouch in that community.  At least this was all true until the Decibel cover. He could be better known as Wrest now. I'm not sure. Either way, dude has been a hell of a tattooer for a very long time.  James ""Human Furnace"" Bulloch from Ringworm is also a talented artist. I know that's not BM but most people don't know HF as James the tattooer."
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,3DprinterFR,5,Tue Jun 16 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"Jef Whitehead, he does all the music for Leviathan and works in a shop somewhere in Portland Oregon. Also there is Carlos Aguilar of Black Shadows Tattoo in Sweden (Malmo I think). He does a ton of work for bands like Watain and Dark Funeral.  Jef takes the cake in my book though, He's the essence of USBM. A one man band with dozens of releases and does tattoos and music as a career, it doesn't get much more badass than that."
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,checkin_in,2,Tue Jun 16 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"Jef was famous as a tattoo artist long before he gained notoriety with  Leviathan. I agree with you, my vote is for him. He's done my favorite work I have on me.  Uncle Alan is one of the best in the world, black metal or not. If money, traveling to Copenhagen(?) and time spent on a wait list aren't an object for you, go with him.  Also worth mentioning are Tim Lehi and Heath Rave in Chicago."
BlackMetal,3a1g8d,LifesABowlofJerrys,2,Wed Jun 17 00:50:39 2015 UTC,Actually Uncle Allen does come to Asia (mainly Japan) a lot so I could book with him when hes next here!

BlackMetal,39bagm,deadboltduck,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:05:45 2015 UTC,Hmmm ... I don't really want to talk during a podcast for a few reasons.   Biggest reason is I listen to the podcasts myself and I don't really want to hear my own voice all the time. That's actually something I dislike about Fenriz' podcasts. First time through ... love hearing him talk. By the third listen .. I'm all STFU Fenriz!  Another reason is I probably can't pronounce the names and songs from most black metal bands. :)  What if I started including time stamps in the track list? That way you know which band is playing from 35:04 - 41:11?
BlackMetal,39bagm,deadboltduck,2,Thu Jun 11 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"recently i made a podcast for a friend, and you are right i can relate to all of these issues, ended up recording the whole thing 3 times because i couldnt stand some small issue with my voice or forgetting what to say, second time i read from a script and it sounded robotic and dreadful... but i digress. time stamp would definitely be appreciated."
BlackMetal,39b3hd,Left6Foot6Trail6,2,Wed Jun 10 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"If it was ever recorded, I doubt it will ever get released since both bands are long-defunct. There were so many bootlegs circulating for the kvlt German and French bands back in the day, that if someone ever did have some sort of physical copy, it was unlikely that it was legit. Plus, except for their splits with DSO and Evil, they mainly collaborated with German bands."

Not sure where you are in VA, but I just did a 7 hour/350 mile drive and it wasn't bad. It looks like there's also a line straight from Norfolk station to Penn Station in New York, which is about 3-4 miles from the venue.

Not a fan of the vocalist's death-tinged style, but it does add a new dimension to the sound. A few too many riffing-with-drums parts that are lazy in the guitar department, too. Production wise it's a bit flat but organic sounding enough to pass as classic Norwegian black metal. I'd rate it above the last CD and above the God Seed studio album, too.

BlackMetal,38ypt2,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"Do you want more black/thrash recommendations, OP? If you like stuff like Sepultura already, black/thrash and stuff that sounds super bestial/primordial with a good smatter of black metal, death metal, and thrash influence could be good ways for you to get into the genre.  Also: Watain is hella mediore, later Immortal is way weaker than earlier Immortal if you haven't hit that, and re: popular bands, yeah, a lot of the most popular bands are more popular because of aesthetics rather than because of any quality. The only REALLY good thing that Mayhem ever did was Deathcrush (which you might like, actually, since you like Sepultura), Watain is popular because they tour a lot and have a spoopy image, Immortal is popular because they made silly music videos (though their first couple of albums are rock solid), Gorgoroth is popular because of memes and Satan (first three albums rule, though), Dissection is popular because they're melodic and accessible, etc.  That's not to say that good and popular black metal bands don't exist- Darkthrone and Bathory's first few albums each are some of the best black metal ever made, a lot of Marduk rules, first Ulver album is great, Burzum's pre-prison material is awesome, early Rotting Christ is great, etc.  Finally: if you want to focus on a certain time period, make it around 1986-1994. That's when most of the genre's development happened, when all of the influential bands put out their best albums, and generally the time period people are talking about when they discuss individual influential scenes, such as the French scene, the Norwegian scene, the Brazilian scene, the Greek scene, etc."

De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is a fun album though.  And I would think if you like Marduk's ""Panzer Division Marduk"", then you might like Mayhem's ""Wolf Lair Abyss"".  To ease people into blackmetal I often suggest Dissection's ""Storm of the Light's Bane"" or Satyricon's ""Nemesis Divina""."

I'll throw in later Emperor, early 2000s Enslaved, and early Dimmu Borgir since you said you liked Old Man's Child (I only have one OMC album and I don't even remember what it's called - although I do like it - so I'm not really an expert on them)."

The Emperor songs need to be listened together. I would recommend headphones be worn and listen loudly. Alsvartr is essentially an intro to Ye Entrancemprium.

BlackMetal,38ypt2,demon_eyes61,3,Mon Jun 8 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Tip of the iceberg but just a few names to serve as intros, Inquisition, Funeral Mist, Archgoat, Antaeus, Carpathian Forest, Anaal Nathrakh and Arkhon Infaustus for faster/heavier/thrashier stuff. Try Leviathan (specific albums though), Krieg, Judas Iscariot and Profanatica for an introduction to US style stuff (avoid Xasthur or Twilight if you dislike the more ambient/drony stuff). Serpent Noir, Gehenna (early 3-4 albums), Emperor, Enslaved, most Blut Aus Nord and Limbonic Art are excellent choices for something occult-ish or atmospheric or even epic but not too weird or demanding. Try those before you venture into more obscure styles or weird or complex sounding stuff like Dodheimsgard, Blaze of Perdition or Deathspell Omega or more demanding scenes like DSBM. You can also try black metal/hardcore hybrids like Celeste, Young and In the Way or Kickback as they are relatively fresh and angry stuff. As for gothic/black seriously, don't trust that term, it can mean a ton of stuff, it's more about style and lyrics than about music."

BlackMetal,3900sb,StormMFeel,5,Mon Jun 8 06:47:12 2015 UTC,"Not many bands do what you're asking... the type of gothic music you describe and black metal are inherently different, and can be difficult to combine. You might have better luck looking for a gothic metal band with a growling vocalist, maybe Cradle of Filth. My Dying Bride doesn't have growling, but their instrumentals are close-ish to the doom/BM genre. Check out Tristania as well.  But:  While not exactly a traditional gothic style nor particularly slow-paced, Carach Angren has a couple of songs with classical elements, including violin/piano.  It's hard to describe Limbonic Art, so just give it a listen and see if you'd like them. This particular song has the best of both worlds, IMO.  Draconian aren't BM by definition, but I'd recommend them nonetheless based on your post, purely for their majestic vocal work. If you like this song, check out in particular The Solitude, but also, Seasons Apart and Through Infectious Waters."

He was a manic depressive, infatuated with death and morbidity and was finally immortalised by taking the decision to end his own life - all this before Mayhem became the band they are today. All these things add up to 'legendary' status in many folks eyes I guess. Pretty standard."
BlackMetal,38t1er,Nosraahl,4,Sat Jun 6 16:39:38 2015 UTC,This. Everything OP says is right but Dead was pivotal to the genre due to circumstances and the tragedy of his character. It embodied the genre perfectly. Think he was also the first (or one of) to introduce corpsepaint.
BlackMetal,38t1er,Ishamep,15,Sun Jun 7 01:08:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't really get it either until digging a little further.  In a thread a few weeks backs some folks were speculating that he had suffered from Cotard Delusion as a result of childhood experiences (almost freezing to death, ruptured spleen from a fight with a bully).  That made him a really fascinating character and so I found some documentaries on him and there was some family stuff that really turned him into a fully fleshed out person in my mind, but I still didn't think he was that great of a vocalist.  But I listened and listened and finally came across his first band MORBID (Swedish death metal) and the album December Moon and I think he is much better here than a lot of the Mayhem stuff.  Also, Atilla's operatic stylings are what drew me into Mayhem in the first place."

I never experienced anything inside myself.  I was always empty; quiet; stole. There was just nothing.""

BlackMetal,38t1er,Rust__,2,Sun Jun 7 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"Per Yngve docs  Its the ""Part 1 and 2"" videos, but there's some other shit there as well."
BlackMetal,38t1er,BlasphemyAway,2,Sun Jun 7 05:20:47 2015 UTC,Thank you.
BlackMetal,38t1er,Rust__,6,Sun Jun 7 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"I think he was Mayhem's best vocalist, because I like how his vocals actually have grit to them. Maniac was great live (still is, mind you) but his vocals in general lack the depth that Dead's had in droves. Attila is a better vocalist, technically speaking, but his vocals are far less interesting to me because there's nowhere near as much natural grit and distortion compared to Dead or Maniac. He's a good songwriter, and fits Mayhem well, but IMO the only thing featuring him that I've ever enjoyed is De Mysteriis, which Dead wrote the lyrics for (obviously). But even still, the live recordings of Dead performing Funeral Fog and Freezing Moon appeal to me far more than any other part of Mayhem's entire catalogue.   Dead bores you, Attila bores me. It's a matter of opinion. And, if you ask me, Dead was better in Morbid anyway."
BlackMetal,38t1er,Kanex,-1,Sat Jun 6 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Attila is a better vocalist, technically speaking   Seriously? I think he fucking sucks, flat-out; hearing him mangle Chainsaw Gutsfuck live was almost enough to kill the song for me, though I'm still glad to have heard it live."
BlackMetal,38t1er,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,3,Sat Jun 6 20:45:28 2015 UTC,"I've never heard him live, so I can't comment. He is (or at least, was) a rather proficient studio vocalist.  Also, you'll notice I said ""technically speaking"". In this context meaning Attila is actually a vocalist by trade. Dead was just a Swedish kid with a passion for being kvlt as fuck. His vocals were a vessel for his artistic expression, they weren't his ""craft"" per say.   I'm sorry you had to witness such a thing, though. That song is awesome, and seeing it butchered live must have sucked something fierce."
BlackMetal,38t1er,Kanex,0,Sat Jun 6 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"Man, I think he sucks in studio, too- he sounds like a fucking pterodactyl, not a black metal vocalist. To me, great black metal vocalists are dudes like The Black Lourde of Crucifixion (Grand Belial's Key, Crucifier), Hellbutcher (the one in Nifelheim/Necrocurse), KK Warslut, Chorazaim (Megiddo), etc- like, I just can't stand Atilla's voice.   I dunno if being a professional actually implies technical superiority- Tom Gabriel Warrior is a guitarist/vocalist by trade as well, and I don't think that a single person would argue that there aren't far more proficient amateur guitarists/vocalists out there- the real difference is his dedication and songwriting ability, which all of the YouTube shredders don't have.  To be fair, I have very little interest in Mayhem post-Deathcrush, and was at the concert entirely to see Revenge...and Revenge absolutely crushed, so I'm satisfied with that show, still, and as far as Mayhem's set goes...well, I listen to black metal for riffs, not for the vocalists, and even if Atilla blows, I'm happy to have heard some Deathcrush songs live."
BlackMetal,38t1er,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,-4,Sat Jun 6 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"Dead is better because he's a worse vocalist   Seriously, go read this post to someone, so you can see how this comes off."
BlackMetal,38t1er,DustbinK,9,Sat Jun 6 20:58:44 2015 UTC,He was just so damn trve
BlackMetal,38t1er,mesoramen,4,Sat Jun 6 16:27:29 2015 UTC,His vocals were more interesting than Atilla's and more importantly everything about him made him living black metal. Atilla just sung black metal. Dead was black metal. His obsession with death and his possible cotard delusion means that he was as close to a living corpse as possible. Atilla was just an ordinary guy he can't compete with a living corpse when it comes to black metal.
BlackMetal,38t1er,Dragovic,5,Sat Jun 6 20:38:47 2015 UTC,"Classic ""dead artist"" phenomenon. Bad artists become good, good artists become great."
BlackMetal,38t1er,Sressolf,7,Sat Jun 6 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"He was the live definition of black metal. Well, until, dead shot himself. Then he was even more kvlt!"
BlackMetal,38t1er,EarthSculptor,3,Sat Jun 6 18:11:27 2015 UTC,Dead's rhythms were indeed improved by Attlia.  But Attila sounds like a drunken bum undergoing a seizure.  And Maniac sounded like a constipated goblin.  Mayhem has consistently had shit vocalists.
BlackMetal,38t1er,UnezkaTurigahl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:10:44 2015 UTC,I honestly thought they all fit the music pretty well although their voices are much different when compared to each other.
BlackMetal,38t1er,Flognickin,4,Sun Jun 7 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"Mayhem is a band who had a bad singer (Attila), a real bad singer (Maniac) and just an okay singer (Dead). Dead is immortalized by the things he said and did, and he has the whole band to thank him for that. Let's say without Euronymous and Varg Vikernes, Mayhem wouldn't have been the legend it is today.   I love Attila at their new album, but at De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas its almost painful to listen to. In a good, but also bad, way."
BlackMetal,38t1er,BrainDisorder,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:51:59 2015 UTC,But it is real fun to do Atilla's vocals on DMDS in an extremely over exaggerated manner.
BlackMetal,38t1er,Flognickin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:01:39 2015 UTC,"He was best at vocals to me but because of sound difference compared to Attila. Where dead sounds more Emperor style and Attila is more comparative to Immortal. Also helps that dead was so dangerously obsessed with death that he became living breathing black metal. His suicide sealed the deal making him forever kvlt. He started the black metal frontman stereotype: corpse painted, morbid and just out right giving one hell of an atmosphere in every show."
BlackMetal,38t1er,everywhereiscompton,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Great vocalist, and front man, tragic situation. I do like Attila."
BlackMetal,38t1er,ITPV015,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:02:56 2015 UTC,"Dead' vocals have always seemed to me to have a pretty unique sound. You're right in that he's not a good ""black metal vocalist"" but that's because he was a black metal vocalist from before there really was such a thing. People hadn't yet decided that ""okay, everyone go with the banshee shriek thing."" His vocals are gritty, influenced by death metal and crossover thrash rather than other black metal artists. The characteristic roughness of his voice also plays very well into that raw, necro sound that was popular at the time but black metal has largely moved on to a more polished sound.  But most importantly there was so much more passion behind his vocals than anyone else ever managed. Sure, other people might be interested in satanism and death, but Dead meant all of his songs about being dead and such very very literally. Even his suicide note made reference to the fact that he didn't believe he was actually human. It's a breath of fresh air in a scene full of people like Nazgul/Werewolf who just do whatever schtick is controversial this week for shock value."

BlackMetal,38rg20,noarkjokes,3,Sat Jun 6 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"Keeper is pretty good. Just heavy as fuck sludge, rounded out by some ambient sections. Similar to Thou, if you've listened to them. Newest split with Sea Bastard has probably their best song to date."

BlackMetal,38otzd,austinrubin,2,Sat Jun 6 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"Same guy, but I don't like any of his Leviathan releases while this is one of best CDs I own period."
BlackMetal,38otzd,Ishamep,3,Sat Jun 6 02:46:15 2015 UTC,"I can't source this, but I believe I read somewhere the Leviathan album Massive Conspiracy Against All Life was originally meant to be released as a Lurker of Chalice record, but for whatever reason that didn't work out. So I don't know if that makes a difference, but I'd check that out if you haven't already, I certainly dig it."
BlackMetal,38otzd,mohonay,3,Sat Jun 6 03:26:58 2015 UTC,Gave MCAAL another spin just now on your suggestion and I just don't like it. Now that I didn't turn it off rather fast I've come across passages that could clearly be at home at Lurker but mostly it does nothing or annoys me.  It was clear from a recent tread that Scar Sighted was scoring high odds on 2015 lists so tried that too and it jsut doesn't work for me so I've pretty much given up on Leviathan.  Taste is a fickle mistress. I often find myself not liking mainstays of the genre.
BlackMetal,38otzd,Ishamep,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:02:56 2015 UTC,"fyi just in case- there are two other lurker of chalice discs (or one may have been a tape?  I forget) that came out prior to the s/t.  You can usually find them on a blogspot type post under '2002' and 'l.o.c.'  I honestly can't remember what they sound like, but there's definitely reused material between them.  I think the first one is more ambient/samplish? I forget.  Oh- and leviathan has an ambient album that I love (silhouette in splinters).  Worth a listen."
BlackMetal,38otzd,Nihm_Brisby,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:24:17 2015 UTC,here ya go: a track from first demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlcgtG4ERyk  full second demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyQfxEqyv-E  Way rougher than the s/t for sure.
BlackMetal,38otzd,Nihm_Brisby,2,Tue Jun 9 03:30:05 2015 UTC,Have you listened to his new album? Very good. Similar atmosphere to Lurker if you ask me.
BlackMetal,38otzd,colourofspace,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:24:56 2015 UTC,Really? I tried to get into this one but it kind of felt like Leviathan outtakes to me. Massive Conspiracy Against All Life is probably one of my favorite USBM albums.

BlackMetal,38qwib,AcidBastard,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:04:56 2015 UTC,"The production on the album is far too modern and clean for my taste. Compare that with the filthy raw production of the demo and you'll see what I mean. And the album lacked the unrelenting intensity of the demo. But the demo was recorded about a decade before the album so it's not surprising that they sound significantly different.   Edit: I just read that the legitimacy of the demos alleged date of recording is up for dispute. One way or the other, it's better than the album"

I have severe anxiety issues which causes me to have frequent panic attacks. I can't always be taking Xanax or Clonopin for them or I'd be a complete drug addict by now.   But for some strange reason, no idea why, I discovered that black metal calms me down - not all of it, of course. Stuff like 1349 that's just really aggresive and schizophrenic sounding will only make me feel worse. And, honestly, a lot of bands have vocal styles or lyrical themes that are a big turn off for me.  But then, I also love Peste Noire, and some other less atmospheric/black-gazey stuff. I'd never want to listing to KPN during a panic attack, but the rest of the time, I love 'em. There is an undeniable beauty to Peste Noire's music, despite it's intentional ugliness.   And that is the same for almost all Black Metal that I like - it's raw, ugly and harsh, yet that is just the surface.

I wish you could pick genres or have it suggest shows because there could be a show you'd be interested in that you miss because you're not following any of the bands playing. Go to any clubs that frequently play metal and look for fliers/posters, and check the venues' websites for calendars. It's definitely not easy to keep track/be aware of all the shows in your area."
BlackMetal,38gcht,the_Demongod,2,Thu Jun 4 05:49:21 2015 UTC,I never thought of picking shows based on genres. That would work very well. I wonder why they haven't implemented it yet.

BlackMetal,38gcht,LifesABowlofJerrys,3,Thu Jun 4 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"Looks like the consensus so far is ""kinda, but not really."" Though I'm not a Luddite, I don't listen to music on my phone at all and do so rarely on my computer, so I don't have a digital library for an app to scan, and my janky old phone is no longer app-worthy anyways. Also: fuck Facebook.  Bandsintown looks interesting, but it looks like I'd need to sign in through Facebook to personalize it. Again, fuck Facebook. I'm militantly against volunteering my personal data so that Zuckerberg can market corporate shit to my friends. The idea that my interest in music would be used as marketing data is beyond repellent.  I know how to do research, so I already know about some of the goings-on in my city. It just seems like there would be a website that would both aggregate data regarding live shows and allow user-generated entries for newer bands (independent of Facebook) that's more streamlined than Bandsintown looks at first glance. Like, I'd be able to pick a genre, a zip code, and a radius and boom, there's a listing of what I could go see with less than a minute of my time wasted.  To the developer who cashes in on this: I'll take my cut in small bills, please."
BlackMetal,38gcht,JohnMeowkovich,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"Ha, I honestly just do it the roundabout way. I have bands that I listen to regularly, so I have a ritual of checking ticketmaster for shows every month. I also just pick up my local (free) independent paper and flip straight to the live music sections. There's unfortunately no clear-cut answer. Just have to do what you feel comfortable doing. I don't have facebook either and am firmly against social media like that as a whole. Good luck on your search!"

No need to worry about transcodes, YTs poor quality, or streaming a video. This lets you listen to the whole album (and this is an albums genre) and often bands discographies. You can also choose individual songs unlike YT. You can buy it in lossless format and lower without the need for a program and Bandcamp only takes 15% instead of 30% like other outlets. Bands will also post tour dates on Bandcamp."

BlackMetal,38gnqm,AveLucifer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no. There are quite a few that incorporate more obvious punk/hardcore elements, like breakdowns and whatnot, but they mostly lean into crust punk, and nowhere near deathcore.   There are some bands that share enough similarities to be a good recommendation, like XisForEyes, Hester Prynne, Into Infernus, and In Chasms Deep, but they're all primarily deathcore and still pretty far removed from AW's style, which was unique. Into Infernus is the most black metal-focused, and their first album is about as close to AW as you're gonna get."

Lately I've been seeing a ton of posts that would have been downvoted to shit a few months ago and a lot less people that know what they're talking about- was there an influx of new people that I missed?

BlackMetal,38b9fk,DustbinK,3,Wed Jun 3 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"I think it really matters that we talk about music based on how it sounds. How many times do you hear a new album on ""Atmospheric Black Metal Albums"" and it's full on acoustic, ambient music with no trace of black metal? The reality is that black metal has an established sound. It is a thing that exists, not just some arbitray term. If something isn't black metal, it isn't black metal. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But don't tell me something is black metal when it's dark ambient or some other thing, it cheapens the term and makes things more confusing.  The Mantle certainly has metal elements (I'd say on 2 tracks), and Agalloch is cetainly a black metal band, but they are also a post rock hybrid, and the Mantle is mostly a post rock album."
BlackMetal,38b9fk,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,3,Wed Jun 3 12:04:46 2015 UTC,What I've found in my experience is the people that know less and less about music altogether are the ones that argue about genre   Seriously? I'd say that it's definitely the opposite- the people that have spent enough time learning about metal to know the differences about genres are generally much more knowledgeable than the people that think that Bathory is death metal or that Black Sabbath is a hard rock band.
BlackMetal,38b9fk,DustbinK,3,Wed Jun 3 19:11:28 2015 UTC,I find it hilarious that someone is somehow an elitist for wanting to be on-topic.

But having listened to (and produced) lots of noise myself, it just sounded to me like a half-hearted effort from people who didn't have a good footing in the genre.

NYBM is an artistic take on the musical style, though often criticized for not being ""true"": Krallice, Liturgy, Yellow Eyes...  Post-black/Blackgaze is a monster right now: Alcest, Lantlôs, Sleeping Peonies, An Autumn for Crippled Children...  I don't know what exactly to call it, but dissonant black metal is one of my favorites: Deathspell Omega, Blut Aus Nord, Dodecahedron, Patrons of the Rotting Gate...   Then there's awesome stuff like A Forest of Stars that defies classification."
BlackMetal,387q9n,metagloria,3,Tue Jun 2 14:42:13 2015 UTC,Is Cascadian Black Metal a thing now? This is one of the things I was hoping to find out. I don't know if there are new regional scenes emerging within black metal of which I should be aware. From an atmospheric standpoint it would make sense for the rainy northwest to produce a black metal scene. What makes Cascadian Black Metal a distinct part of the overall black metal genre?
BlackMetal,387q9n,DustbinK,3,Tue Jun 2 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"The atmospheric elements, the focus on nature and eco-spirituality. It was a thing, but its moment has passed for the most part. Skagos' ""Anarchic"" is in my opinion the pinnacle of the style, and one of the greatest albums of all time.   A band I didn't get to mention is Fen, who have released four awesome albums. They're post-black with elements of post-rock and prog (mainly in song construction, i.e., not many black metal bands would throw down a 13/8 part)."
BlackMetal,387q9n,noarkjokes,3,Tue Jun 2 16:28:24 2015 UTC,Arguably Cascadian Black Metal already came and went.

To be honest, I think it sounds kind of uninspired, their riffs are riffs for the sake of being BM riffs... I do like Yellow Eyes far better than Krallice and Liturgy though, particularly because they did a great split with Monument."
BlackMetal,387q9n,noarkjokes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:45:11 2015 UTC,their riffs are riffs for the sake of being BM riffs   I've only listened to Krallice and Liturgy and don't find them typical at all. Krallice has a distinct style that sounds like prog mixed with BM and Liturgy (when they were black metal) pulled from various genres including math-rock. I really don't think they're comparable other than not being conventional and causing a lot of divisiveness amongst listeners.
BlackMetal,387q9n,DustbinK,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah, people do seem to love or hate Krallice. I guess in my opinion Krallice sounds somewhat emotionless, like all their riffs are calculated to sound a certain way, and it's like pulling teeth to try and listen to an album all the way through for me. I don't know, I just find them super boring, despite loving 20 minute atmospheric marathon bands like Fell Voices, Lluvia, and Paramnesia. Liturgy's guitar style sounds similar to me, even though they have that annoying ""burst beat"" technique which was cool for one song but in the end I think it makes all their songs sound the same. Evidence of the divisiveness, it seems, haha"

Also Satanic Warmaster's Fimbulwinter (Really highly rated album by almost everyone I know in 2014). Leviathan released a few album since then, I believe one of his best works, Scar Sighted, came out earlier this year. Either way, those are all some pretty cool albums to check out.

I like Starkill, but it's debatable whether they're ""black metal"", but there's an argument to be made that they are.  I like some of the stuff Xanthochroid does.

Dimmu Borgir seems to have been backburnered by its members. I was curious to see where they would go next as the ""metal"" that was left in their sound was slowly giving way to an almost movie score feel.  Never heard of Starkill. I'll look them up.

BlackMetal,3881da,blerp_blerp,7,Tue Jun 2 14:46:32 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it has to do with the DIY ethic of black metal, coupled with the budget afforded underground acts. A band selling cassettes limited to a run of 66 aren't generally going to be able to afford a vinyl press, or a professional cd. A cassette is super cheap, the dubbing is inexpensive, even if it's outsourced, and the j card can be photocopied anywhere.   Perhaps some of it also has to do with inaccessibility, as well. Keeping the underground just that, underground."
BlackMetal,3881da,jafebsemas,3,Tue Jun 2 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not about cost it's about inaccessibility. Because let's face it, you could go buy a couple hundred blank cds for a dollar or something. It's a carry over from the early 90s."
BlackMetal,3881da,Shiftkgb,6,Tue Jun 2 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"I concur with /u/jafebsemas   Getting a physical product out is much more important to bands than just having a Bandcamp page.  You can get 100 cassettes pro-manufactured for about $125. Even cheaper if you make it yourself.  CDs will run you almost 10 times that much! Vinyl .. don't get me started!  For what it's worth being ""traditional"" or ""old school"" is a desirable thing in a black metal band for a lot of people. Cassettes harken back to the old days of tape trading."

BlackMetal,3834wn,SilentGreg,4,Mon Jun 1 19:32:04 2015 UTC,"A microtone is basically a tone or a note that doesn't ""exist"" within the 12-note system that most modern music uses. Think of a quarter step, halfway between two notes. So microtonal music is taking advantage of those in between notes to create a sound that, since we're used to the 12-note system, sounds exceptionally dissonant."
BlackMetal,3834wn,electricsheep12345,3,Mon Jun 1 19:42:30 2015 UTC,Cool! Thanks for the explanation!
BlackMetal,3834wn,Apteronotus,3,Mon Jun 1 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically using 24 notes per octave instead of the usual 12."
BlackMetal,3834wn,Nihm_Brisby,3,Mon Jun 1 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"Great explanation. When you think about it in the context of the title too, it really fits thematically because the Ship of Theseus is a well known allegory about how changes relate to identity. New tones replacing old ones like planks on a rotting ship etc.  Also, ""Machinery That Renders Debt Infinite"" obviously about student loans."

BlackMetal,3834wn,joetron2030,5,Tue Jun 2 05:20:43 2015 UTC,"ELI5: Listen to the linked piece. Does it have an 'out of tune' sound? Do some notes seemed to 'bend' or 'shift' in 'unnatural' ways? That's the sound of microtones to an ear not used to them. If a band played without first tuning their instruments, there would be sonic similarities with this music.  PS.  Some people claim that once you become accustomed to music based on a 24 note scale (or any scale with more than 12 notes), that it stops simply sounding 'bent' and 'out of tune', and starts to sound like a new 'normal.' At that point, a composer is supposedly now in possession of a richer musical vocabulary. Other's dispute this, usually supporting their claim with evidence from acoustics, the physiology of the ear, etc...  Western music actually is fundamentally microtonal. The notes we use are 'in between' the actually frequencies one would need to create the 'truest' intervals. This is done to make all 12 scales sound the same: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_temperament A modern piano tune in a standard way is actually not capable of producing a true 'fifth' (the 'most important' interval in music) (edit: accidentally posted this to a lower level comment originally)"
BlackMetal,3834wn,headless_bourgeoisie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:54:24 2015 UTC,"Well temperament:       Well temperament (also good temperament, circular or circulating temperament) is a type of tempered tuning described in 20th-century music theory. The term is modelled on the German word wohltemperiert that appears in the title of J.S. Bach's famous composition, The Well-Tempered Clavier. The phrase wohl temperiert first appeared in Musikalische Temperatur (1691) by Bach's predecessor Andreas Werckmeister (1645–1706), an organ tuner and music theorist.

It even seems like the guitar was recorded in a bedroom without particularly good recording equipment, which isn't necessarily a problem (I listen to much worse recordings) but it does kind of detract.

War metal isn't doom, how can it be the heaviest metal genre  Also:   raw black metal (in style of Cultes des Ghoules and in style of early Mayhem); blackened death metal (in style of Portal, no Behemoth-like bands allowed);   what's the point of including shit that isn't war metal in a war metal sub; fucking awesome as Adversarial is, they sound absolutely nothing like Conqueror or Blasphemy offshoots, and that goes even further for raw black metal; Vlad Tepes or Katharsis are entirely unrelated to Revenge"
BlackMetal,37zq0n,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Sun May 31 19:59:01 2015 UTC,"""War metal isn't doom, how can it be the heaviest metal genre"" - this is what average person who is not into the more underground WBM will say. I know what I'm going to say is not going to be professional, but that's the only thing to prove your statement wrong, so here it goes. Chose 1 heaviest doom metal song you've ever heard and put it here, and I going to reply with heaviest WBM song, so you can compare.  As for your second statement, sure that early Mayhem doesn't sound exactly like Blasphemy or Conqueror, but, their early music (as early I mean pre-Deathcrush demo tapes) was very influential to the genre (for example, Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance of Beherit claims that the largest influence for Beherit had been Mayhem). Adversarial would not be the perfect example of what was stated on that page, but, it is fast, bestial, raw, ""brutal"", which are also characteristics of WBM. Also, Vlad Tepes and Katharsis do not sound anything like early Mayhem, so they are instantly out of discussion."
BlackMetal,37zq0n,WhiskyTech,0,Sun May 31 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"Black Sabbath- Black Sabbath. Nothing will ever convince me that anything else is heavier, ever.   Rippikoulu- Musta Seremonia demo  Besides, DAE opinions? I listen to a fuckton of black metal and death metal and still think that Orodruin is heavier than almost all of it.  Sidebar brings up Cultes des Ghoules, which sounds absolutely nothing like war metal or early Mayhem at all (unless their pre-album stuff does, in which case, my bad and I repent)- that's why I brought it up. If it just said ""early Mayhem"" I wouldn't have said anything. There's a big difference between Cultes des Ghoules and Mystifier, after all.  Adversarial is Incantation + black metal. It has nothing to do with war metal, and that's my point- black/death that isn't war metal shouldn't go in a war metal sub unless it's the early formative stuff."
BlackMetal,37zq0n,DustbinK,1 point,Sun May 31 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"""Nothing will ever convince me that anything else is heavier, ever"". You have a nice statement here, heaviness is in a lot of cases based on your personal thoughts. But, if we are taking in mind low tunings and amounts of distortion, and comparing the crunchier, more crushing, lower sound, I will have to link you Darklord (actualy, any song by the band, it is really hard, if not impossible, to find band sounding ""heavier"" then this one).  You are, but not fully right. Cultes des Ghoules doesn't sound like WBM, but, it did influence some newer WBM acts.   On the other hand, Damaar has nearly the same sound as Marduk's Panzer Divison (tuning being different only), yet Damaar is and Marduk is not considered WBM. The goal would be to promote the music that is also chaotic and extreme, which has characteristics close to WBM.

BlackMetal,37r6ss,ZeroThePenguin,2,Fri May 29 23:09:42 2015 UTC,Do you find it hard to get the tapes at the back?
BlackMetal,37r6ss,AveLucifer,2,Fri May 29 22:01:12 2015 UTC,"No, for the most part. I've got two of these drawer things, and only one of the six drawers kind of sticks."
BlackMetal,37r6ss,jafebsemas,2,Fri May 29 23:06:47 2015 UTC,Those are made exactly for music cassettes.  They also made them for VHS tapes.
BlackMetal,37r6ss,bobhwy,4,Sat May 30 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"An acrylic display case works (preferably a wall mounted lock-and-key type). Kind of like the ones you'd display sports cards in or something. If you want to go a step further, UV tint the case so the cassettes stay closer to mint. Just have them lay down flat with the title towards you, obviously. Im a collector at heart so Im a little biased with this option.   Edit: as /u/AveLucifer pointed out, scratches are plenty visible. I'm extra careful but they still will show  If you don't want to go with something like that, a barely see-thru, plastic storage box with a tight fitting lid(or clasps) works. The longer/thinner the better."

BlackMetal,37r6ss,poopthrash,3,Sat May 30 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Finally. I've been dreaming of such a thread forever.    I use Ikea's Kassett boxes. The narrower one fit exactly 2 rows of cassettes stood vertically. One box fits about 28 tapes that way. There's room to put at least 4 more lying down on the top of those.    My problem with this system is that it's hard to browse through what tapes I have, especially since I don't sort alphabetically. I do know there are ready made solutions on the market. My dream system would be something from Napa Valley, though it's not happening anytime soon because I've just never seen it in a country I'm living in. It probably was only ever an American thing.    I've also always though about something like this because it's very easy to reorder the tapes. I'd probably then shift to sorting them alphabetically, with one row for the most recent unlistened ones.    I really hate most other premade options, especially the drawer or revolving rack types because they look so kitschy and dated. Especially these. If I got a Napa valley type I'd stain it or refinish it somehow anyway.    I guess my dream solution would be to make my own version somehow. I do have some experience with woodwork, but it's a lot of time and effort that I can't exactly afford now."

BlackMetal,37lmss,rammsdell,6,Thu May 28 17:20:00 2015 UTC,I've been listening to Dødheimsgard's A Umbra Omega for weeks now. It is incredibly demanding but so interesting and varied album.
BlackMetal,37lmss,thecultisalive,2,Thu May 28 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"I was hoping this was going to be within the same realm as 666 international now that Aldrahn is back on vocals again and at first I was disappointed listening to A Umbra Omega with that expectation but the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me.  It's definitely off the wall batshit insane for the most part.  I have a lot of mixed feelings for the band, I love all of their albums, especially Aldrahn's vocals on the albums, but I'd never want to see them live if Aldrahn is in the live lineup.  If you watch their live shows on youtube with him on vocals you just have an overwhelming sense that he's not used to the stage but he's trying to awkwardly cover it up by moving around a lot while pulling some strange dance moves, plus he's so inconsistent with vocals live I can't help but think ""WTF Aldrahn, are you even trying?"", his delivery of the lines are just very distant from what he laid down on the albums."

BlackMetal,37i4ob,flytrap666,1 point,Thu May 28 00:02:30 2015 UTC,"communists twisted Marx's philosophy     How, by adding a dictator? Sure, there's a difference between Marxism and Leninism (or even Stalinism) but the lack of social classes, lack of public property, equality for everyone (I mean equality, not equity), and collective agriculture are all constant in Marxism and Leninism.    As for the relationship between Nazis and Nietzsche, the National Socialists did have ideas similar to Nietzsche: The division of the strong and the weak can surely be seen reflected in the Nazi thought, and Übermensch (super human)."
BlackMetal,37i4ob,leredditaccounts,1 point,Thu May 28 00:14:26 2015 UTC,"But the way the strong and weak are defined is different. By nazis all who are not they are weak, and they are strong. By nietzsche strong, or the ubermensch are people who are above morals, not afraid to sacrifice things and people, not afraid of responsibility, enigmatic and cold, who can accomplish goals above the masses, goals which create the world as they want it to be instead of preaching it. Yes you might see alot of similarities here between nazi view and nietzsche, but nietzsche explicitely called nationalism and antisemitism decadence, claiming they are only antisemites because they envy the jews for their work discipline and good organisation, and power they can buy when needed.   Infact his philosophy is quite dangerous, but i find most freedom of thought within it."

That doesn't mean blowing $200 on Izotope Ozone, but it does mean at least using a limiter to get another 5 or 6 db worth of volume out of your mix. You need to decide what kind of black metal you want to write- is it punkish, early Darkthrone stuff? Dissonant like Deathspell Omega or later Mayhem? Do you want some atmospheric tracks with layers that sound like Blut Aus Nord? Your choices here will determine the length, riffing style, and variation in sound- just one or two guitar tracks versus 4 for atmospheric stuff- and allow you to put a structure to your ideas.    Go listen to the records by bands you want to sound like and pay attention to the song structures. Write them down - ""Riff A- 0:00-1:00; Riff B-"" etc etc- and analyze them. Is there a melody leading from A to B? Do the drums change? Is there a bassline subtly moving the song forward? That's what good musicians spend the most time on. It's not as fun as just cranking something out and putting it to tape, but it's necessary if you want people to actually listen. Your song has at most two or three riffs and is almost five minutes long, without any breaks to speak of- that's going to turn people off. I understand it's a demo, but I wouldn't fall into the trap of just wanting to release stuff, even if it's for fun, without developing it to a logical end point."
BlackMetal,375at0,PlumbTheDerps,2,Mon May 25 11:43:20 2015 UTC,"it'd be wonderful if I could get some feedback. (and a vocalist/lyricist)   i can shriek variations of ""hail Satan"" mixed in with unintelligible nonsense for you if you want, but I definitely don't care enough to actually write lyrics  bad example, but something like this (for context, I did a throwaway ""cover"" of part of World Eater as a joke with some extremely low-in-the-mix vocals)"
BlackMetal,375at0,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Mon May 25 06:37:52 2015 UTC,It's okay but you definitely need some vocals in there or it just sounds too bland.   Have you tried doing vocals yourself?
BlackMetal,375at0,UnanimatedFelix,2,Mon May 25 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"yea, I can't do them at all. I really do want a vocalist just to try to make it sound more black metal-y.

The False/Barghest split was one of the first black metal albums I bought from a record store, as opposed to online, and the two Barghest songs on there were phenomenal, still some of my favorite USBM. They were incredibly dynamic, and had a fresh sound.  This... is disappointingly flat and the rhythmic death metal vocals really make this sound incredibly generic to me. I really didn't like the album artwork so I shied away from listening to this, but I like the title of this song so I gave it a go... I expected more creativity from them, especially since I believe members of Thou are part of Barghest..."

I'll agree that this isn't the strongest song on the album, but it was what I was currently listening to. You should check out the rest of it, and considering you can listen to it on bandcamp for free, there shouldn't be a reason not to, even if you don't like the art work...   And to clarify, there was only one member from thou, and he was one of the guitarist, but is no longer in the band currently."

BlackMetal,36y7zh,KittenLoves_,6,Sat May 23 04:43:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like the prettiest black metal wouldn't be black metal at all, but blackgaze ...   The prettiest actual black metal would probably be stuff like what you've mentioned, Wolves in the Throne Room (the actual bm stuff), later, viking-inspired Bathory and things in that vein. Peste Noire's ""Ballade Cuntre Lo Anemi Francor"" is kind of pretty, as is Gris's ""À l'âme enflammée, l'âme constellée..."".  This is really difficult because, you know, it's not really a genre written to be pretty. But here are a few songs that may have that elusive quality:  Mamaleek - Poor Mourner's Got a Home  Burzum - Glemselens Elv  Orakle - Tourments (this is the full album, because I can't find the song itself anywhere on youtube; in any case, it's the first one.)  Hopefully this is helpful."

BlackMetal,36y7zh,SailorLax10,1 point,Sat May 23 05:09:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's very hard to just dive into Black Metal and expect to like it. The music on the surface is very dense, very confusing and it's easy to get lost and miss the beauty. It sort of requires listening correctly at first until you do it automatically. My point is that I agree to introduce black metal concepts through crossover genres. Like gaze, atmospheric or post. I definitely belief in beauty.   Think most of us have givne some thought to what music you'd play to introduce someone to it. I played Burzum's Belus as first which was pretty magical and showcases the grandeur the music can have without the usual instrumentation. Right now I think Ne Obliviscaris also makes an excellent choice as an inbetween."

Both Somberlain and Storm of the Light's Bane were great albums that are rather accessible since they are kind of a blackened blend of various metal genres."

BlackMetal,36y7zh,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,2,Sat May 23 22:01:00 2015 UTC,Because the blackgaze sound appropriates musical attributes but does not incorporate the black metal aesthetic. If anything it's subversive to it given the juxtaposition of it with actual black metal.

Other bands in that vein or similar include Thulcandra, Sacramentum, Unanimated, later Watain, etc.  Other melodic BM bands of different ilk I'd suggest include Kvist, Sorhin, Thy Primordial, Windir, and Mistur.   If you enjoy Emperor, check out some symphonic BM bands like Limbonic Art, Obtained Enslavement, or Old Man's Child. If you enjoy Emperor's later efforts, or find yourself partial to Ihsahn's solo work, you might find some avant-garde BM to your liking, e.g. Arcturus."

It's epic, beautiful, melodic, and one of the best albums I've ever heard.  The top two stand out tracks to me are Old Mornings Dawn and Carhadras, so if you haven't got time, at least give those a go."

No need to worry about transcodes, YTs poor quality, or streaming a video. This lets you listen to the whole album (and this is an albums genre) and often bands discographies. You can also choose individual songs unlike YT. You can buy it in lossless format and lower without the need for a program and Bandcamp only takes 15% instead of 30% like other outlets. Bands will also post tour dates on Bandcamp.  Also, your title is wrong, which just goes to show the low effort people put into YT uploads."

BlackMetal,3671tb,YouDumbZombie,1 point,Sun May 17 03:55:09 2015 UTC,"Most of them were only released once on vinyl or are hand numbered original pressings. I believe ""Telepathic with the Deceased"" and ""Defective Epitaph"" are reissues and the rest original. I have all studio albums plus an EP and self titled demo. None of the split EPs though. Most expensive one was the ""Bloodstained Mirrors"" album."

BlackMetal,361p31,Vandrendulf,2,Fri May 15 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"And so are communists. In my opinion Black Metal should never be used for political propaganda. And I used ""worse"" because in Germany we have a lot of this RABM bands and they are among the most intolerant idiotic people I know and also there are more NSBM bands making good music than RABM bands."
BlackMetal,361p31,Vandrendulf,2,Fri May 15 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"All the Communist communities I'm a part of have been ridiculously accepting and very equality based. I've found most of the people who find us extreme are right wing reactionaries and fascists.  I'm not saying there aren't bad sides to communism (I don't subscribe to particular brands and disdain the practices of men like Stalin for example) but comparing us to white power, Nazi punks, we're definitely less shitty. I've never met a nice Nazi.  But I get why some people believe this music should be politics free, that is how I prefer it most of the time."
BlackMetal,361p31,alexaxrossiya,5,Fri May 15 16:12:29 2015 UTC,"I just have a very negative opinion on RABM because in Germany they are on a real witchhunt after Black and Pagan Metal bands, want to cancel concerts of bands that never had anything to do with any fascist views, and stuff like that  just because they have a different opinion.

Communism involves a lot of things, like public ownership of the economy and other things in a stateless and classless society.  They're quite radically different."

BlackMetal,35yz20,thaggis,1 point,Thu May 14 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"That's the problem, they hav e such a unique sound it's so hard to find similar bands. I've got all of Eldrig's solo albums, my favourite is 'Everlasting War Divinity'. In the song 'Death to the Unwilling', when I heard it the first time and the music stopped and some dude just shouted 'DEATH TO ALL CHRISTIAN CHILDREN' I burst out laughing.... Then i continued loving the music.  You're right, though, Eldrig's solo work isn't quite as good as Fanisk, though it's still very good."

BlackMetal,35skr2,flytrap666,3,Wed May 13 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"At first glance he seemed racist, but he's just very proud about being Norse.    It depends on what you mean by ""racism"" though: 1: The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.  2: Racial prejudice or discrimination    He believes that the races exist, but I don't think he has a prejudice against them."
BlackMetal,35skr2,flytrap666,5,Wed May 13 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"but I don't think he has a prejudice against them.   He was recently charged with inciting hatred against Jews and Arabs. He rants about Jews trying to take over the world, constantly calling them scum. Dude showed up to court in an SS uniform. He has praised Hitler on numerous occasions IIRC.   This doesn't really fall under 'being proud about being Norse'. I do have the ability to look past this sort of stuff, I believe one should think and say what they like, but it does somewhat put me off being a full on fan of his."

I've never heard anything like this.    EDIT: He's said some things about Jews, yes, but that's more of a Zionist conspiracy thing, not hatred just for being Jewish. He's also liked a video made by a black man so that's part of the reason for why I don't think he hates other races."

BlackMetal,35skr2,flytrap666,3,Wed May 13 23:24:45 2015 UTC,"War In Europe     That's more of a Zionist conspiracy. And the remarks against Muslims are in response to the mass immigration of Muslims into Scandinavian countries. He said that he doesn't agree with Breivik because a true nationalist wouldn't kill children of his own nation. No one is denying that Varg is a tinfoil, but he doesn't necessarily express hatred. If you can get past the ""love-letter feeling"" of this video explains Varg's political views pretty well.     Racial Hatred     The article didn't give much evidence, and the ""Heroes"" blog (which he said he didn't write anyways) is difficult to read. What I can tell from the pictures is ,again, a Zionist conspiracy theory and anti-Christianity     S.S. uniform     That doesn't look like a S.S. uniform"

BlackMetal,35rshh,nebelmacht,3,Tue May 12 23:45:57 2015 UTC,Depends what you mean by Asian influenced? I don't think there would be many asian influenced black metal bands simply because Black Metal is not of asian origin and is limited in very small circles. Having said that there is a Death Metal Band called Rudra from Burma who you might find interesting.
BlackMetal,35rshh,DeviState,3,Wed May 13 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"RUDRA is from Singapore, not Burma.  Also from Singapore is the band Impiety, a Black Metal band.  There are metal scenes in Bangalore and the Bengal region, with lots of bands. Honestly Encyclopedia Metallum is OP's friend here. Just search by country."

BlackMetal,35rshh,DeviState,1 point,Wed May 13 01:59:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I think most metal is same-y and forgettable. Although it makes the standout bands seem that much better
BlackMetal,35rshh,heruka,1 point,Wed May 13 02:42:37 2015 UTC,Definately. I wish metal bands would try different things with vocals. I am a big fan of bands that try new things and new ideas sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but its always worth a listen. Babymetal is a good example of how the genre can be expanded into something completely new.

BlackMetal,35fp1c,poopthrash,3,Sat May 9 22:41:17 2015 UTC,I don't know man... His speed is incredible at times and his rhythm can be knife sharp. Not sure how he does it but he seems to be able to play like he's never played drums a day in his life on purpose and sometimes brings out his overwhelming endurance on the drums for other tracks. As a drummer it's probably the most interesting thing about striborg's sound for me.
BlackMetal,35fp1c,iClarion,1 point,Sun May 10 02:34:54 2015 UTC,Do you have a couple of tracks to show me? As a drummer not knowing much of Striborg you have sparkled my interest.
BlackMetal,35fp1c,pival,1 point,Sun May 10 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"It's a little tricky to find good individual tracks online but many of his full albums are on YouTube. The album Trepidation is probably the best example I can find. His first track in Mysterious Semblance is a good example of technical ability that requires a strong sense of rhythm while sounding like a sloppy mess.  There's 2 things to keep in mind about his drumming being intentionally shitty. First, he's gotten a lot better at drumming over the years, however he's still not trying to be perfect, like most drummers do. He doesn't use a metronome, and he records his drums almost always last, so he's playing to nebulous and somewhat ambient guitar tracks. This means the timing for entering a fill is up to feeling rather than a concrete structure of notes and bars. And that carries into his beats too which can often speed up and slow down on a whim which creeps me out."

BlackMetal,34zfyn,MetalGamer666,2,Tue May 5 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"wow, what's with this riff? it seems like a huge change in direction to me, as if he's just not feeling the forest's black emptiness anymore but forces himself to record some stuff anyway. there is just this awkwardness that was never there before. like darkthrone's confused years (after total death, before the crust influence), and i fear that striborg is going into a confused period as well."
BlackMetal,34zfyn,deadboltduck,2,Wed May 6 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"Just in case non of you have noticed the fact that both my user name and the you tube channel name are that same, I was the one who uploaded this on youtube. And I wanted to thank you very much for the feed back I have recieved. I have two more Striborg tracks here that I have also uploaded just in case you want to listen to more from this album. Thanks and enjoy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk42nZBp2bg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkNEYBgh5NI"
BlackMetal,34zfyn,nromolo6,1 point,Wed May 6 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"He's definitely changed. When he did that One Man Metal interview(judging by his view on solitude/current life), it seemed like he was going/wanted to go in a different direction. Same thing with Xasthur and his decision to do that ""doom grass"" project Nocturnal Poisoning(changed back to xasthur again)."
BlackMetal,34zfyn,deadboltduck,2,Wed May 6 11:14:45 2015 UTC,"judging by this track though, he's just not good at writing melodic leads, it's like he got tired of noise and wanted to write real music, but it's also like someone who only ever made paint splatter art trying to draw a nude woman and ending up with something similar to a portrait of gumby. i'm just sayin', striborg used to kick ass..."
BlackMetal,34xbhj,Captain_Man,4,Tue May 5 09:53:25 2015 UTC,What an album cover.
BlackMetal,34xbhj,MUTILATORer,2,Tue May 5 19:23:50 2015 UTC,In fact the whole EP is something else
BlackMetal,34xjha,noob_senpai,3,Tue May 5 11:45:29 2015 UTC,"I can tell this album will make it as though their EP and this album were done by two different bands.   Not that this is a bad thing cause I'm loving this so far, and I loved the EP too. These guys are really promising."
BlackMetal,34xjha,KELLANISCOOL,2,Tue May 5 20:47:24 2015 UTC,Australia's on point as usual
BlackMetal,34wjtr,FatSoccerMan,14,Tue May 5 03:37:19 2015 UTC,I'd recommended a sneaky day trip out to The Grim Frostbitten Moonforrest.
BlackMetal,34wjtr,whiskybearapocalypse,5,Tue May 5 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest visiting Garage, Bergen's metal bar. The guy from Enslaved works the door when he's not on tour. A walk around the city mountains are also in order, to get a feel for Immortal's videos."
BlackMetal,34wjtr,thenka,3,Tue May 5 05:38:03 2015 UTC,"Neseblod record shop is cool. Just don't buy anything, it's overpriced"
BlackMetal,34wjtr,11equals7,2,Tue May 5 10:01:27 2015 UTC,I second Neseblod
BlackMetal,34wjtr,nromolo6,2,Tue May 5 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"I bought some rare .45s that were reasonably priced. Just make sure you take cash of you do want to buy anything, because they only take MasterCard and some bullshit Norwegian card. Pretty much everything in Norway is wildly overpriced, though, if you don't live there and make the kind of wages their citizens do."
BlackMetal,34wjtr,WeedFinderGeneral,1 point,Tue May 5 13:39:46 2015 UTC,"i remember seeing somewhere that there is a bus tour run by a guy from a death metal band that tours the local black metal historical sites, can't remember his name though  edit: guitarist from cadaver inc"
BlackMetal,34wjtr,deadboltduck,1 point,Tue May 5 16:05:57 2015 UTC,"In Bergen: - Garage metal bar - Fantoft Stavkirke (restorated replica of the church Vikernes burned down and featured on the Aske EP cover, still has burned remnants of the original laying around) - Grieghallen (the culture center that houses a small studio were a lot of legendary albums were recorded in the early nineties: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eirik_Hundvin)  Oslo - Elm Street Pub (some of the Oslo bands were known to and still hangout there from time to time) - Site of old Helvete shop (Schweigaardsgate 56)"
BlackMetal,34wz4a,FancyTea,2,Tue May 5 06:38:37 2015 UTC,"Raventale are one of my favorite lesser-known black metal bands.   If you like atmospheric black metal, check this band out!"
