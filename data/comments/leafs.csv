leafs,3e2n9c,RicoPapaya,19,Tue Jul 21 14:12:56 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, until we get an offer that is worth us moving him, he's more valuable on the roster."
leafs,3e2n9c,ersal,9,Tue Jul 21 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"Players values going forward, as far as the Leafs are concerned, should be gauged by what they might bring to the table 4-5 years from now. Sure he might still be putting up points but we might just be wasting his most productive years rebuilding when we should be spending that time developing the players/picks we could get in a trade. He's also going to need a new contract before the Leafs are competitive again. I don't think we have to worry much about the return as he's very productive and on a reasonable contract."
leafs,3e2n9c,micatola,7,Tue Jul 21 15:30:17 2015 UTC,Dude. He's going to be 31 in five years. That's directly in his prime. We better start getting rid of guys like Marner and Kapanen because they're gonna be too old in 5 years...
leafs,3e2n9c,cfmcg,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to think high end talents wash out at 30.  Kadri will be almost 30 in 5 years, (29 years , ~10 months to be exact). Better ship his ass out too I guess.    However, JVR is a specific case for me, and it has nothing to do with his age.  The only reason I'm okay with trading him is because we can demand a king's ransom from a contending team.  His cap-hit is so friendly that I'd bet there are a lot of teams that would overpay for him to put them over the top for a cup run.   Plus, JVR is probably worth Bobby Ryan type money at UFA (7x7), which he could easily get on the open market in my opinion. I'm just not sure if I'd be okay being the ones to pay him that kind of money.    That said, if we're getting awful offers (Kessel type offers), then forget it.  We keep him."
leafs,3e2n9c,g1663,5,Tue Jul 21 19:33:53 2015 UTC,JVR is a very productive player on a very good contract. We can't get stuck undervaluing our assets and not getting a proper return. We need to squeeze every bit of value from any trades because that return will be our future.
leafs,3e2n9c,ersal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:36 2015 UTC,Totally agreed. I think we can get better than what Kessel fetched for sure. This to me is the deal that could really kickstart the rebuild in style. I'm not sure how he will play under Babcock because his underlying numbers aren't good so I'd be more inclined to cash in now rather than waste a year of that awesome contract when it could really sweeten any potential deal.
leafs,3e2n9c,micatola,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:30 2015 UTC,There is no way a team is giving up that much for JVR. I just can't see it.
leafs,3e2n9c,El_Gato_Grande,3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:54 2015 UTC,"Obviously hard to say until we find out the return if he is traded, but I don't think it's that far-fetched. The biggest thing JVR has going for him is that he's on a great contract - he can give you top 6 or borderline top line production for just over a $4m cap-hit, almost half of Kessel's.   That makes JVR a potential great buy for any team in a win-now mode - a lot of them are in close against the cap which makes it hard to add another weapon through free agency. It also means there would be more teams interested in trading for him and driving up his price, whereas there were only one or two possibilities for Kessel based on his contract and NMC.   To add onto that, it's definitely feasible for the Leafs to take back a bad contract for JVR. They're nowhere near the cap and have little interest in competing the next couple years.  For example, how valuable would it be to the Flyers to add JVR and be rid of Umberger. With no cap space, they have no other way of improving their offense. Or maybe the Wild, taking back Backstrom, or the Stars and Lehtonen. In all cases, it would upgrade the opposing team immediately and free up money for other moves to improve elsewhere. That would definitely be worth a good prospect or two and a top draft pick."
leafs,3e2n9c,tmlrule,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:08 2015 UTC,"He's 26 right now, so I have no reason to think he'll be past his prime in 5 years. He's been a reliable player thus far and could be the kind of guy the rookies can fall back on over the next few years as they develop. I think he's exactly the kind of player the team needs."
leafs,3e2n9c,drStark,3,Tue Jul 21 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Well we will lose out the value of his sweet contract. We'll likely be garbage and below the cap until he's a UFA, so we don't get anything out of that. That's wasted asset value.  I also think he's going to get exposed when playing without Kessel. On the top line, Lupul was PPG player for over 100 games. JVR wasn't even that good."
leafs,3e2n9c,JoeyHoser,6,Tue Jul 21 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"His cap hit is special. Come the trade deadline there'll be a team looking to add someone like JvR and will probably give up some great prospects for such a cheap, big-bodied forward."
leafs,3e2n9c,Whiterhino77,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"A team I always thought JVR would be a perfect fit for is Anaheim. Getz and Perry need a LW. Maroon is currently a poor mans JVR and is putting up good numbers with them, imagine JVR. Would love to get Theodor from them plus picks."
leafs,3e2n9c,davesuperstar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'm a huge JvR fan and bought his jersey immediately, but we gotta be pragmatic. It's already been mentioned in the thread to hold him if nothing enticing is sent our way, couldn't agree more.   But this is one of the best contracts in the league, and like you said he'd thrive on a defensively-responsible Anaheim team - we could take Anaheim to church for him."
leafs,3e2n9c,Whiterhino77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"He has like 3 years left though. Teams generally want rentals at the deadline, not commitments."
leafs,3e2n9c,JoeyHoser,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:33 2015 UTC,Yup you're right but that's why I mentioned his cap hit is special.  I think a lot of teams would love to commit to a former 2nd overall pick that puts up 55-60 points a season on one of the most statistically-odd teams in the league when his AAV is absurdly cheap.  I could be wrong but maybe the reason why we don't see many players like JvR shifting around at the deadline might be because there really aren't many guys as talented as JvR with a cheap contract coupled without a NTC (although I believe he has one kicking in after this season).
leafs,3e2n9c,Whiterhino77,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yup you're right but that's why I mentioned his cap hit is special. I think a lot of teams would love to commit to a former 2nd overall pick that puts up 55-60 points a season on one of the most statistically-odd teams in the league when his AAV is absurdly cheap.   Well yeah but it's just that the trade deadline is generally for quick fixes via expiring contracts. There is no reason why a team would pay more at the deadline for JVR than in the summer. They're just getting less JVR, and subsequently paying less for it. And in the meantime, we run the risk I mentioned before of him being exposed without Kessel and his value dropping significantly. If a team runs into injury trouble or something that makes them all of a sudden want a top six forward approaching the deadline, they aren't going to want a 3-year injury replacement that costs a fortune.  There is just nothing to be gained by hanging on to him until then. His value will almost certainly not increase, and there's a strong possibility it decreases, significantly."
leafs,3e2n9c,JoeyHoser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:57 2015 UTC,"He absolutely does not cost a fortune, it's the opposite.  As far as the rest of your post goes, I think that's debatable. Teams get desperate at the deadline because they know (or at least think they do) exactly what they need. That's when you get bidding wars which drives prices up.  Furthermore, at the deadline  teams are going to know whether they're a roster player away from being a contender, whereas in the off-season the bubble teams have no idea where they will be and won't be as amenable to trading future pieces away for a roster player.  So I guess an argument could be made just as easily that teams would pay more for him at the deadline. I think you're putting too much stock into the remainder of his contract - it's incredibly cheap and if a team really doesn't want that commitment then they could easily trade him away later;  I see no reason why the duration of his contract would be a liability. Actually as far as I'm concerned his term is an asset given how cheap his AAV is."
leafs,3e2n9c,Whiterhino77,5,Tue Jul 21 20:20:33 2015 UTC,Short answer: yes. Long answer: yes.
leafs,3e2n9c,Squadz,4,Tue Jul 21 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"He's young and pretty talented offensively and can eat top minutes. I don't want our young guys being thrown in the first line until they're ready.  When he's in his prime on his last year or two on his contract, trade him at the deadline.  His cap is going to be extremely friendly still and a team like the ducks will probably pick him up."
leafs,3e2n9c,Snizzin,10,Tue Jul 21 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"The Leafs are definitely better off with him than without, but I think he's incredibly overvalued ATM and would yield a good return. His value could drop without Kessel"
leafs,3e2n9c,davesuperstar,11,Tue Jul 21 14:45:17 2015 UTC,He has a NTC kicking in during the 2016-17 season so the time to trade him would be between now and the trade deadline.
leafs,3e2n9c,newbo750,6,Tue Jul 21 14:56:17 2015 UTC,This is the critical thing people keep overlooking. The window on moving him for maximum returns is closing. Soon after you'll need to take what is the best deal available as opposed to what would be the best deal period.
leafs,3e2n9c,micatola,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:37 2015 UTC,It looks like Shanny and Co. are eager to sign established players with something to prove to fill the roster. This will make it difficult for prospects to get a sniff at the big show. They've already stated that the rebuild will be painful so I wouldn't worry about our young players being thrown to the wolves if things don't go well. Especially with Babcock at the helm. He's notorious for not putting inexperienced players in his lineup.

That means Phaneuf, Lupul, Bozak, and (though I disagreed with it) Kessel.  Guys. JvR is 26 years old. It's debatable that he's even beginning to enter his prime. He young. He's talented. He has an amazing contract. I don't see any reason whatsoever, unless we get him for something ridiculous (like Eichel or McDavid straight up lmao), why we should get rid of him.  I'm still sour about the Kessel trade. We had a top5 winger int he league. But at least it kind of made sense. He was a bit older. Apparently, he had attitude problems in the locker room. He wasn't a very good two-way player. Etc etc...but JvR? If we trash everything, pretty soon we'll be trading guys like Nylander away..."
leafs,3e2n9c,VitaminTea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"26yo is offensive peak for forwards. Chances are (especially with Kessel gone) that he'll never top his 30/30 season. He's a good player on a good contract, but his value right now is the highest it will ever be.  And that's just boxcar stats; his underlying numbers are abysmal.  His NTC kicks in next season and he's a UFA in 2018. I say trade him."

Also, the guy who ran the study says that ""The vast majority of players are at 90 per cent of their best by age 24, although there are a few late bloomers,"" (24 of course being JVR's age in that 2013-14 season)."

The only qualm that I had with the study is that he did give to much weight to +/- stats, which most would agree is a pretty flawed metric.  However, I still think it is at least something to figure out when players usually peak. Obviously everyone is different. I'm not saying JVR has peaked (though, his numbers will suffer this year because we will be a bad team) just that I've never heard anyone saying 26 is a peak age for forwards.

Guys like Marner don't come around often, and while I like Werenski, Meier, and Rantanen (assuming they'd still be available), I'd much rather take Marner.   It'd be a tough deal to turn down, but it doesn't knock your socks off. If McDavid didn't exist, Marner might've gone #2 overall if Strome played a full season sans McJesus.

The fact the Leafs made the trade conditional on at the very least AZ leaving Hanifin to begin with suggests they liked one of Strome/Marner enough to not do the deal if both were left on the board by AZ.  Otherwise they could have just made the offer without that condition, or left it on CBJ to impose it, which would have given away less info about their rankings.  We're also only hearing Columbus' side; ""if they don't take Hanifin"" is the part they were interested in.  For all we know the Leafs could have said ""if they don't take Hanifin or Strome"".  Or, more likely, the Leafs were playing a bit of game theory and didn't want to straight up tell other teams who was their #3 guy.  Now, this reasoning doesn't rule out the possibility of Strome being the guy we wanted.  But that seems less likely, as the speculation has been pretty unanimous that we had Marner ranked #3.  Furthermore, if Strome was the guy by a significant margin, presumably when AZ took him the Leafs would have called Columbus back and tried to negotiate more.

Personally glad we ended up with Marner, but if say 2 out of those 4 picks end up being great players for Columbus there's always going to be that ""what if"" factor, regardless of the fact that Toronto probably wouldn't have gone with the same players Columbus did."
leafs,3dzmd1,kordata,7,Tue Jul 21 14:36:40 2015 UTC,I actually really like seeing this.  It's super interesting to see the calculated moves each team does. CBJ thought they had a 77% chance of getting their guy so they decided against it. But the GM even admits if that 23% case comes around he's going to regret not pulling the trigger on the deal.  Really shows the tough decisions they have to make. Interesting to see Toronto realize this and attempt to capitalize on it. That 100% certainty must have been awfully tempting.

leafs,3dzmd1,cfmcg,3,Mon Jul 20 22:55:15 2015 UTC,I definitely would've stuck with Marner. Skill dropped off after that hard
leafs,3dzmd1,Snafu93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:55 2015 UTC,I loved the video and wish the leafs go back to showing the draft behind the scenes (although I doubt it since Shanahan prefers more secrecy).    Kekalainen is a very astute evaluator of talent.  Curious to see how Werenski stacks up against Hanifin and Provorov now.  I was pretty high on him before the draft but right behind Provorov.
leafs,3dzmd1,178239104511126,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"So 8 (Werenski), 24 (Konecny), 34 (Dermott), 38 (Bittner) and 58 (one of Kylington/Bracco)  vs.   Marner, Dermott, Bracco, Dzierkals.  I love Marner, but that 1st scenario is tough to turn down."
leafs,3dzmd1,Zoidberg22,8,Tue Jul 21 03:30:04 2015 UTC,I assume the leafs were making that trade thinking marner would be gone at 3.  So it would've been hanifin/strome vs those 4
leafs,3dzmd1,178239104511126,5,Mon Jul 20 20:44:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't assume that. The deal was rejected by the Blue Jackets. The Leafs were clearly willing to give up a shot at Marner for that package.
leafs,3dzmd1,MrSpaceBaby,5,Mon Jul 20 20:53:47 2015 UTC,I would assume they were hoping that Provorov was still there at 8.

Toronto all along wanted Marner, but if Arizona took him they were moving because their fourth overall selection could no longer be used for Marner.    Maybe I'm completely wrong, but it seems to me they (Toronto/Columbus) didn't expect Arizona to take Strome, which is odd because the hockey world predicted it well in advance."
leafs,3dzmd1,PessimisticPanda,4,Mon Jul 20 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think they necessarily expected AZ to take Marner, I think they were working on plan B in case it happened because they had Marner as a clear #3 and then Hanifin/Strome/Werenski/Provorov all close enough that they were okay with trading back and taking whichever of them was left.  Their philosophy around moving back, which Dubas talked about regarding the #24 and #29 picks, was that they were willing to do it if they have a cluster of players rated fairly closely.  I personally think it's unlikely they had Marner in a cluster with the others given that it sounds like they were much higher on him than Hanifin or Strome.  The huge grins around the Leafs table after AZ picked kind of said it all, they all seemed giddy as fuck that they were about to go up and pick Marner."
leafs,3dzmd1,178239104511126,4,Mon Jul 20 23:33:17 2015 UTC,"So basically it would be Marner and Dzierkals for Werenski, Koneckny and Bittner.   I don't know. I think I'd rather have Marner."

leafs,3dzmd1,tkang1234567,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:52 2015 UTC,They could have taken both of Kylington and Bracco instead of Bittner and maybe picked Barzal at 8
leafs,3dzmd1,CryptOfRays,2,Mon Jul 20 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"Both scenarios would've been amazing. Obviously, depending on how the 24th pick and 2 other second rounders turn out, it might leave some bitter taste in our mouth.  But I also like to think of it this way. There is no doubt that Marner is a better prospect than Werenski. Seeing how the trend of Leafs being successful at getting so many picks on Draft day and their moves on UFAs, we're going to see a lot more picks coming our way in the near future as well. I think sheer number of picks are amazing to have, especially starting from rd 2 and onwards since it becomes harder to project their skills and development is a bigger factor for those kids. But quality becomes a huge factor in upper echelon of 1st round (1-10th pick). Top 5 pick are usually blue chippers that doesn't come by often (look at our history with top 5 picks). We need elite skills to start a legitimate rebuild and a new core. We already have fairly good depth in bottom 6, bottom pairings. I am confident that Marner will become the player that can easily get us 1st rd and 3 2nd rds in the future."

In 5v5 situations, players who have played > 400 mins:   Kadri, and Gardiner had the best CF% on the team (49.8 & 49.79, respectively), despite the flak they received constantly from the media Not one leaf posted a CF% higher than 50%... yikes Kadri posted those numbers despite starting mostly outside of the offensive end (-1.96 ZSO%Rel) I'm not a fan of CP60 (= CF60 + CA60) because, ideally, you want a high CF60 and a low CA60. So instead I made a new (?) stat, which I'll call Corsi difference per 60, or CD60 (= CF60 - CA60). This tells us the difference in relative corsi per 60mins. The results...    Top 5, in order... Gardiner (-0.45), Kadri (-0.47), Winnik (-2.72), Rielly (-4.07), Panik (-4.73)  Bottom 5, in order... Lupul(-13.85), Holzer(-13.76), Holland(-13.43), Robidas(-13.23), JVR(-13.05)  The leafs were really bad last year lol. But the top 5 in CD60 were all brought back, which is nice  PS.

If the draft is before the season, those players may most likely be put into the draft. The kids will be protected with the entry level contracts.   If Phaneuf is still around, maybe he becomes a guy. If anything, it may be the random players on one or two year contracts playing depth roles.

leafs,3dzy2i,wingmage1,4,Mon Jul 20 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"I pulled this from HFboards regarding how it worked when Nashville, Atlanta and Minny/Columbus entered the league:   The #2 seed in the draft lottery for the expansion teams is true....but they shared that seed with the teams that had the second worst record in the league. So in the 98 and 99 drafts, there were two teams in each draft that shared the same lottery probability. The scenario the league set up was that the lowest the expansion teams could drop in the lottery was to third.....meaning that if the team they shared the #2 seed with (or the team with the 3rd seed) won, the expansion team would pick third.  With Minnesota and Columbus, there was a coin flip prior to the expansion draft. The team that won the flip had the option of choosing to pick first in either the expansion draft or pick before the other expansion team in the entry draft.   So if I'm understanding correctly, Quebec/Seattle will have the same lottery probability as the 2nd worst team. However, it's a bit more complicated now that the first 3 spots are all lottery.  All in all, it's not a good time to be bad, as you stand to drop down as low as 7th if you're the 2nd worst team in the league."
leafs,3dzy2i,raptosaurus,3,Tue Jul 21 01:10:41 2015 UTC,"if anything, it would slightly move up the rebuild in other teams getting weaker relative to us, with the potential to remove a bad contract or two as well"

Some were little things like rotating around who read off the starting lineup before the game, and another thing was shifting to a preference of having morning skates in all but totally impractical situations, even if they were short. That may have been something that changed more for this year than last. He also doesn't hold the rookies to the same standards - a big reason he wanted to trade for Legwand last season was to have an established center he could hold accountable while the others focused on learning. Developing youth may not be what he's known for, but between the experiences this season and last showing he's open to making some changes along with his desire for the challenge, I wouldn't assume it isn't going to work.

leafs,3dy7mz,walrus527,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:10 2015 UTC,I feel like we should temper any Red Wings feedback with Olympic feedback.
leafs,3dy7mz,Vilheim,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe once we have Olympic-calibre players. Getzlaf, Crosby, Toews, Perry, Benn, Tavares,  Doughty, Weber, Subban, Price... I'd argue it makes a coach's job a little easier when his team has players of that calibre playing together. A lot of talent and leadership in that room. By all means we should take that feedback in to consideration, but take it with a block of salt."
leafs,3dy7mz,BlackandRead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:23 2015 UTC,Hell maybe we should wait until we have Red Wings caliber players.
leafs,3dy7mz,walrus527,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:41 2015 UTC,I'm not convinced that coaching elite-level players who are all from different teams is easier than lower tier players on the same team.

leafs,3dy0bx,SMGiven,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:33 2015 UTC,He's got such a cool name
leafs,3dyggv,Unimatrix7,23,Mon Jul 20 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"Veteran presence, minute-muncher, mentoring and a chance to revitalize his career under Babcock."
leafs,3dyggv,loco_canadian,12,Mon Jul 20 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"He's also good at just taking the same old BS questions everyday from the media when it comes to terrible losing streaks. Might not seem like much but it helps shelter some younger guys that will be on the team from dealing with Simmons, Feschuk and Kelly personally"
leafs,3dyggv,billmurray43,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:48 2015 UTC,Team shit eater....how very sad!
leafs,3dyggv,diddlemeonthetobique,6,Mon Jul 20 23:50:50 2015 UTC,Hopefully he doesn't play more than 23 minutes a night. On nights where he does he plays noticeably worse.
leafs,3dyggv,Xer0day,5,Mon Jul 20 15:59:50 2015 UTC,I think Rielly and Gardiner can push 25 minutes including PP minutes especially with the excess amounts of D we have. But the problem is they won't likely be paired.
leafs,3dyggv,lmHuge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:22 2015 UTC,Definitely. In his draft year and the year leading up to it he was averaging just over 29 minutes a game
leafs,3dyggv,Xer0day,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"He's probably going to most nights. I know most are not going to like it, but hopefully he's going to be used more effectively under Babcock's system. The key is that he's going to have to play tough minutes to shield some of the young D who are still developing. We have two other veteran D, but I don't think giving more minutes to Robidas and Polak is going to yield better results."
leafs,3dyggv,loco_canadian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"This is going to be Gards year, He shouldn't need to be over sheltered anymore. Its time for him to shine"

leafs,3dyggv,Seacord,11,Mon Jul 20 15:55:32 2015 UTC,i hope babs doesn't play him as a 1st pairing.  he's clearly overworked and overplayed with the minutes he logs every game.  we've got up and coming d-men like rielly who can step up into the top pairing.
leafs,3dyggv,katamura,12,Tue Jul 21 02:19:17 2015 UTC,Moe Still needs another year to develop on the second pairing.
leafs,3dyggv,Theshwizard,4,Tue Jul 21 20:45:36 2015 UTC,He can be the guy that takes the majority of the criticism of the media and fans while the younger guys develop and make mistakes. It's kind of sad to think about but that's an important part he can play.
leafs,3dyggv,LeafsFan1993,4,Mon Jul 20 16:01:12 2015 UTC,Captain
leafs,3dyggv,mzebone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"A lot has been said already, he can take the media and he can shoulder the blame. I feel this is the year that Morgan steps up and starts playing the full game. He played real well last year but still a bit sheltered. I also want to see Polak do some interviews. I feel they would be amazing.  Let phaneuf start in charge, and then let the players under him take it from him as they are ready. I feel that if Gards and capt Morgan take more time away from Phaneuf he will become much more reliable for us."
leafs,3dyggv,Vilheim,3,Mon Jul 20 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"Yes.  By all accounts he's a good team guy, a good foot soldier, he's well-liked in the room, he works hard.  No reason he can't be."
leafs,3dyggv,thewolfshead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"According to some reports he doesn't like Lupul, but according to Feschuck, Simmons and Co Lupul doesn't mind his wife."

leafs,3dyggv,Theshwizard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:33 2015 UTC,He will be dealt after he builds his value up a bit
leafs,3dyggv,cloud_28,3,Mon Jul 20 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Captain, mentor for young defensemen like Rielly etc, makes a guy like Babcock happy because he has at least 1 quality defense, make the Leafs bearable to watch."

The only reason they're keeping him is because his contract is too much to move right now, don't expect ""Captain"" Phaneuf to do anything of great value this year much like he did last and the year before..."

leafs,3dyggv,LinLeaf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"Not really. He was always pretty bad, especially defensively. The fact he struggled is not a surprise at all. Not to toot my own horn, but I offered to bet any Phaneuf supporter whatever they chose that within a year or two they would hate that contract and want it gone.   It didn't even take a year."

leafs,3duj4j,AmmarH,9,Mon Jul 20 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"This seems informative, but I have no clue what NHLe means"
leafs,3duj4j,brokenshoelaces,15,Sun Jul 19 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"Basically its to equal other leagues numbers to NHL numbers.   You always hear about how _____ got 70 points in the OHL, but what does that mean he will get in the NHL? NHLe is that calculation and it does it through all the leagues."
leafs,3duj4j,the-may,7,Sun Jul 19 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"Just to add to that, my understanding is it's the average number of points a player scores in the NHL the year after he scored x points in the CHL/AHL/wherever.  So these numbers are what we could expect the player to score next year if the play in the NHL.  One catch is that as far as I know they are based on a constant conversion factor.  Which means I wonder if it might slightly under-estimate the production of top end guys like Nylander and Marner, because most players jumping from AHL/OHL to NHL play reduced roles, whereas these guys would be jumping right into the top six."
leafs,3duj4j,InternationalCow,9,Sun Jul 19 17:07:29 2015 UTC,Gabe Desjardins (who developed this) accounted for this by basing it off of even strength goals only (because most 3rd and 4th liners aren't on the PP). This is included in the conversion factor so we can just use total points per game (which is much easier to gather).  Here's the article where he explains it.   http://www.behindthenet.ca/projecting_to_nhl.php

leafs,3duj4j,CharlottesWebster,4,Mon Jul 20 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Gauthier is a bit of an odd case. He didn't start playing hockey until his teens if I recall correctly, and he didn't take it seriously until his draft year. Before that he was leaning toward football.   Because he started so late he hasn't developed as much as other players his age. We may see him break out a bit around age 23. I believe having him play top minutes in the echl and working with the leafs training staff could really help him."
leafs,3duj4j,NathookGD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. Much better than pigeon-holing him in the Marlies bottom 6 as a shut down guy. Let's see what he can do in other situations.

Yeah he wasn't exactly Tim Gleason or Deryk Engelland, 5G 9 Pts is very acceptable hence why I believe he is an effective 3rd pairing D or a guy you can stick out on the PK against Perry Lucic and other Net Pests. But when people get mad because he plays next to Rielly or Gardiner over pairing them together or sticking them Next to Phanuef, they are fully justified. He does nothing to help their game as they play a very up tempo style that his legs cant keep up with.   He should fetch a nice return. I actually wonder if now that Anaheim has a bit of a back log at Goal if we could package him with Chris Gibson to get John Gibson and a late pick or something of the likes"

But when people get mad because he plays next to Rielly or Gardiner over pairing them together or sticking them Next to Phanuef, they are fully justified   I wouldn't say that. Reilly and Gardiner are both offensive defense, having a big tough stay at home defense certainly doesn't hurt either of their games, and allows them to do what they do best without worrying so much about whether or not they can make that rush up the ice or not.   they play a very up tempo style that his legs cant keep up with.   Believe it or not, Polak is one of the faster skaters on the Leafs. This is pretty widely regarded, if you google ""Roman Polak skating speed"" there are plenty of results ranging from TLN, to PPP, to HF that all agree.   He should fetch a nice return. I actually wonder if now that Anaheim has a bit of a back log at Goal if we could package him with Chris Gibson to get John Gibson and a late pick or something of the likes   We already have a backlog in goal of our own with Gibber, Bibeau, and Sparks, with Reimer and Bernier both already showing they can manage at a #1 spot."

leafs,3dn7uh,theDudes_rug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:22 2015 UTC,I'd love to see a kids line in the AHL of Kapanen - Nylander - Brown.  Kapanen and Nylander have unreal hands and vision and Brown is just a pure worker.
leafs,3dn7uh,elikmac,2,Fri Jul 17 19:08:33 2015 UTC,I'd love for him to get to that second line winger spot but I think it's more realistic he ends up as a scoring touch in the bottom six here or somewhere else
leafs,3dn7uh,Clarkester29,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"61 points in 76 games in his first AHL season. Looks to have top six potential, or a scoring third liner at worst."
leafs,3dn7uh,Omalley19,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:36:47 2015 UTC,I'd say next year will be another year in the AHL for Connor. He will get call up time. Probably see Nylander/Brown/Marner in the NHL October 2016.
leafs,3dn7uh,Clarkester29,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"I know it's far to say who's going to be up, but I doubt Marner will be up. Reasoning I doubt he'll be up is because he's going back to London this year (unless he steals a spot top 6, but I don't see that happening, and shouldn't rush him), and unless he's for sure ready in 2016, I don't foresee Leafs management fucking up and bringing a young player up too early, mistakes of the past, but you never know."
leafs,3dn7uh,ConvertsToMetric,2,Fri Jul 17 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"He has to play in the NHL next year, otherwise the leafs would have to send him back to the OHL, which would be ridiculous, unless if he has an underwhelming seasons this year."

Better to let prospects over-ripen than to bring them up too early.

The media doesn't pay to much attention to the A outside of Nylander for obvious reasons.  Brown for where he was drafted was a guy that if he made the NHL it would have been a nice surprise as guys like Nylander, Kap and Marner have to be first liners if not excellent 2nd liners to not be huge disappointments"

leafs,3dm758,Wellhowboutdat,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:05 2015 UTC,It's so they can have over agers playing in the league and keep some of the talent around. Otherwise all the players would leave at 18

With the change in lottery, it isn't as necessary to finish lower in the standings for a good pick, and our management has shown they know how to capitalize on a mid round picks.  I also think with the moves they have made, this team isn't going to be a dumpster fire and they will be trying to be competitive, we won't be a playoff team for sure, and once we move a lot of guys at the deadline the team will decline naturally, but this team is going to battle and I think they will at least be fun to watch, a lot of these guys are playing for their futures in the NHL at this point, and Babcock isn't the type to not compete."

The problem I have with him is it seems like he doesn't know the game as well as most pro commentators.  He's constantly missing important things that happened during the play, says things that are flat out incorrect.  I've seen really good scoring chances happen while hes busy on some tangent asking his cast members about their playing career or some crap and then he doesn't even mention that it happened.  And he gets players wrong all the time, so many times this season where he mixed up Kadri and Bozak because he saw the number wrong even though it was really obvious who was on the ice at the time."

leafs,3dkg74,anmar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:08:07 2015 UTC,I was at the game last year when the Canucks were in TO and Miller got pulled after allowing 4 goals in 5 or 6 shots... The entire crowd was mocking him... Greatest hockey moment I've ever seen in person.
leafs,3dkg74,thewolfshead,7,Sun Jul 19 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"No no, THIS is the Phaneuf I want to see next season.  The whole reason he had success in Calgary and originally had a big contract was because of his offensive ability, which the Leafs have done everything to stifle (play him tough minutes with bad d partners, or with d partners who aren't strong enough defensively, don't set him up for PP one-timers, start overwhelmingly in your own end)."

leafs,3dkg74,Shamussss,4,Fri Jul 17 15:27:44 2015 UTC,"100% agree.  The contract was a little too rich, but he's still a great defense man.  Offense is his strength, not logging most minutes on the team, while having to play penalty kill as well.  If anyone is to blame for his decline in play, it's the leafs coaching and management."

leafs,3dkg74,PoliteIndecency,2,Fri Jul 17 12:05:37 2015 UTC,My buddy and I paid $200 each on whim to sit in the two seats right beside the TV cameras. Access the Maple Leaf club and we actually had a pretty good section to cheer in. Had a blast. It's really hard making the long walk up to my usual 300s after that.
leafs,3dkg74,CamIsBack9,3,Fri Jul 17 13:34:19 2015 UTC,Hopefully Babcock gets Dion shooting more. I feel like he's taking less and less shots each season. He needs to unload that bomb more often.

But don't expect drastic improvement everyone, remember he's on the wrong side of 30 now."

Was at the major sports bar in Calgary (having just moved there) and was obnoxiously cheering against new friends I'd made all night. Then this happened I went nuts.

leafs,3dkg74,vanKessZak,3,Fri Jul 17 00:35:36 2015 UTC,It's not so much that his legs started to go. It was the skate cut near his knee that messed up his mobility.  http://video.mapleleafs.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=81217

leafs,3dlbth,thismadhatter,12,Fri Jul 17 12:20:11 2015 UTC,He had a six game point streak late in the year where he put up 5 goals and 2 assists. In the other 53 games he scored 2 goals and 4 assists. I don't see the point in giving a roster spot to a player with those numbers.
leafs,3dlbth,POPS_GHOSTLY,5,Fri Jul 17 12:53:44 2015 UTC,Exactly.  People keep saying he was like Mason Raymond.  Raymond had 20 goals and was consistent.   Not a good comparison.

leafs,3dlbth,v1be,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:13:12 2015 UTC,"No. The value of a David Booth to this team is how much he can return at the trade deadline. And last year's deadline proved he was worthless.    Also, there are currently 13 forwards ahead of Frattin, Carrick, and Leivo. They should be trying to open up spots for these guys, not add to the excess."
leafs,3dlbth,AvecFromage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:06:00 2015 UTC,I forgot about him tbh. oh well. too bad he became noticeable at the end. ruined his chances of an nhl contract. maybe he'll play in Europe.
leafs,3dlbth,sadleafsfan16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:04:49 2015 UTC,He finished well...has good pedigree. But management has a specific plan and they may think his upside is lower than his downside.
leafs,3dlbth,Chinawall,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"He's got great off-ice training routines. As a player though, he isn't much and doesn't really add any value. If he wants to join the team as a waterboy/trainer that would be cool."

leafs,3djxbs,lmHuge,6,Fri Jul 17 00:04:48 2015 UTC,"Compared to Kessel and Bozak, he should end up being better defensively. A couple scouts noted that he works hard on defence despite his size, obviously not as prolific as Marner is defensively."

leafs,3diwf3,mlhs_aaron,2,Sat Jul 18 13:06:15 2015 UTC,Oh. They probably wrote it as /hour instead of /60 because the usual sportsnet readers don't follow advanced stats.

leafs,3dim77,Wellhowboutdat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"Well a) maybe they see potential in him to be more than just a goalie expert and b) this is not a traditional the buck stops here GM position, he will be just one voice in the decision making process. They may also be looking for someone who has the potential to be a standalone GM someday that they can let go for draft pick compensation. They could be not only in the business of developing coaches, but GMs too. All the while seeding the league with leafs friendly GMs.  edit Also I believe Burke has said he is not willing to go somewhere to just be the goalie guy, maybe they want him and the GM title is the only way to lure him here."
leafs,3dim77,darrell25,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:04 2015 UTC,Thats what I mean though if its ginna be GM by committee why guve him the title since hes gonna be the face if they differentiate him from the others.  Im just curious if hes done anything of note to attract that kind of attention from teams.
leafs,3dim77,Wellhowboutdat,25,Fri Jul 17 02:40:34 2015 UTC,We don't need a GM!
leafs,3dim77,Seacord,9,Thu Jul 16 16:45:22 2015 UTC,I was thinking that what we have right now is good as well.
leafs,3dim77,dudleyjack,6,Thu Jul 16 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"One more good hockey mind couldn't hurt though, right? If he's hired here that means he's probably willing to work by committee."
leafs,3dim77,isotope123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:09 2015 UTC,Very true
leafs,3dim77,dudleyjack,5,Mon Jul 20 14:05:56 2015 UTC,"Having someone whose outgoing, a good salesman and personable dealing with other GM's and the media could be useful. Plus it frees up time for Dubas and Hunter to do what they do best."
leafs,3dim77,ahal,10,Fri Jul 17 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"Can anyone give me a run down why Burke is coveted?  I know he has experience with Arizona, but what are the bonafides that make him rank up there with other GM candidates we pursued months ago?"
leafs,3dim77,-Casson-,4,Thu Jul 16 21:53:00 2015 UTC,I don't know about his qualification for GM but he did coach up some average goaltenders into elite goalies at one time or another.  Ilya Brygalov was a monster in Arizona.  So was Mike Smith at one time.  He also had a hand in the rise of Dubnyk.  Sounds like a good guy to have a round.
leafs,3dim77,tilac,7,Fri Jul 17 08:44:27 2015 UTC,Another Burke as GM...
leafs,3dim77,brokenshoelaces,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:55 2015 UTC,He even has a son named Brendan...
leafs,3dim77,pacman2697,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think in the case Burke accepts the job, it would likely be as assistant GM and then we would see one of Dubas or Hunter promoted to the role of GM.  That's just my opinion though"
leafs,3dim77,Vilheim,8,Thu Jul 16 16:02:55 2015 UTC,I am all for Dubas becoming the guy now or a bit later. Just surround him with some hockey minds that have the connections for him to exploit.
leafs,3dim77,pacman2697,8,Thu Jul 16 16:04:28 2015 UTC,Yah I would rather leave Hunter in a position where he is free to scout as many draft eligible as possible and not have to worry about the day to day running of the club as much
leafs,3dim77,lmHuge,7,Thu Jul 16 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah you 100% want Hunter scouting, way more valuable than being the GM."
leafs,3dim77,AmmarH,4,Thu Jul 16 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"yeah Hunter for scouting, and then let Dubas work on developing AHL, ECHL, and hire someone like Burke to run everyday job"
leafs,3dim77,pacman2697,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:21:18 2015 UTC,If McRimmon had accepted the leafs offer I could see them promoting Hunter but as it is they don't have anyone to replace him
leafs,3dim77,milkplantation,5,Thu Jul 16 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"My dad plays men's league with Hunter. Said he was offered the job of GM and didn't want it. Apparently, though he's intelligent and a great hockey mind, he doesn't speak very articulately and knows it. Didn't want to have to answer to the media and be one of the voices and faces of the team. Take it for what it's worth!"
leafs,3dim77,pacman2697,5,Thu Jul 16 20:52:32 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, on an unrelated note the way Dubas handles the media is amazing for his age and experience"

leafs,3dhte4,Tyoung1110,34,Thu Jul 16 11:40:25 2015 UTC,"It's a bit ridiculous how excited I am for this season to start. Which is weird, because I fully expect us to be terrible, but seeing Babs behind the bench and finding out who wants to be a part of our core moving forward is going to be awesome."
leafs,3dhte4,Workywork15,14,Thu Jul 16 13:39:06 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I've said it a few times here but there's just no pressure next year. If we do terribly welp, we just get better draft picks. Manage to do well it's just a bonus. In reality I just can't wait to see Babs behind the blue. First two games of the season Wed, Oct 7  Canadiens         Fri, Oct 9 Red Wings !!!!!!!!!!"
leafs,3dhte4,mzebone,13,Thu Jul 16 13:55:48 2015 UTC,I'm super excited to go watch the Marlies play this year too.
leafs,3dhte4,lmHuge,7,Thu Jul 16 14:18:04 2015 UTC,Really sucks that Marner isn't Marlies eligible. That would have been awesome to see him and Nylander rip up the AHL.
leafs,3dhte4,Workywork15,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:31 2015 UTC,Nylander and Brown will lead the AHL in scoring if both stay down. Have a feeling one makes the team though
leafs,3dhte4,Stillboutdatlyfe,3,Thu Jul 16 19:06:22 2015 UTC,I wasn't even considering a subscription this year for Gamecenter/Hockeystreams but now I'm having second thoughts.
leafs,3dhte4,adc39,6,Thu Jul 16 15:32:44 2015 UTC,AHL Games! And they got Knights games. Worth it
leafs,3dhte4,lmHuge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, once the Leafs are confirmed to be as terrible as I expect, I'll be scouting the 2016 draft as much as possible through Hockeystreams."

leafs,3dhte4,riversfan17,3,Fri Jul 17 01:00:23 2015 UTC,It's even more worth it to get hockey streams with AHL and CHL games.

I was roasting marshmallows over the dumpster fire, wanting the team to fail historically. Not for McDavid, but because I was so jaded and just wanted to watch it burn.  Now I feel this strange excitement. Even if the team does poorly in October, it will feel oddly encouraging in a way. I'm looking forward to it."
leafs,3dhte4,HeyCarpy,2,Sat Jul 18 11:00:11 2015 UTC,The whole team is pretty much in a contract year by design. There are going to be some surprises coming for sure in terms of talent.
leafs,3dhte4,HandsomeHarry,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:03 2015 UTC,I'm going to have to disagree with this sentiment. As a player Kadri has IMO proven himself as at least a second line player with potential for more. What he's getting paid now is a reasonable to good price for him that I would prefer to locked up for longer rather than risk him maybe getting overpaid if he has an amazing overachieving season.  That said I would hazard a guess that management still isn't sure about Kadri and his future with the Leafs and probably want to get rid of some of their current long term contracts before committing to another one.
leafs,3dhte4,Dr_Dippy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"So we're supposed to be excited for this year like we were supposed to be last year? He's just going to keep demanding 1 year contracts until he finally has a good season then will try to get the biggest deal he can.   Get rid of him for picks or prospects, he's not a #1 C on a Stanley Cup team and that's what he want to be paid. For that he can leave."
leafs,3dhte4,OMO3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why, as a fan, I should be excited about someone's contract. If he plays like he can, gets points and gas an edge, then that will be exciting. I'm a NHL consumer - I'm not paying for his contract.  Sure, we can comment and chime in on this stuff but I don't see why I would be excited about it."
leafs,3dhte4,Bobs_Your_Zio,-5,Sat Jul 18 17:09:57 2015 UTC,they're bulking kadri up to trade him for maximum value when stamkos comes home. our future centers:  stamkos marner nylander
leafs,3dhte4,sharkbabysitter,11,Thu Jul 16 14:47:30 2015 UTC,Even in this hypothetical dream world you describe...you really think that Nylander is going to be our third line centre?
leafs,3dhte4,loco_canadian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:45 2015 UTC,strength down the middle is never a bad thing. I don't think Stamkos is coming here for starters but a center group of Marner-Nylander-Kadri would be a nightmare to match up against since all 3 have the ability to put up points. This team's gonna be fun to watch 3-5 years down the road.
leafs,3dhte4,hushoo,2,Thu Jul 16 21:54:52 2015 UTC,Or Kadri can play 3rd C and move Willy or Marner to the wing. Sick C depth

leafs,3dhte4,drStark,-42,Thu Jul 16 18:40:37 2015 UTC,Maple Leafs fans have been trying to get excited about something to do with Kadri since he joined us.  We haven't found a reason yet.
leafs,3dhte4,Squadz,16,Thu Jul 16 12:06:50 2015 UTC,"You are completely right, I almost forgot how terrible of a player he was until you pointed this out. And to think I watched all those games and formulated my own opinion of a player for nothing."

leafs,3dhte4,lmHuge,7,Thu Jul 16 13:05:46 2015 UTC,"I mean, the lockout season was pretty fun to watch. Kadri being second in points and all"
leafs,3dj7rq,Tyoung1110,3,Thu Jul 16 18:31:55 2015 UTC,Leafs could see upwards of 7% improvement in possession going from Carlyle to Babcock. Don't really have the shooting talent to turn it into wins.
leafs,3dj7rq,InternationalCow,5,Thu Jul 16 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"Unless Kadri, Rielly, and Gardiner improve offensively, which is a possibility. Could also improve enough defensively so they won't need to score as much."
leafs,3dj7rq,dogfb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"They're going to be so much better defensively, especially if Bozak is traded or ice time is taken away."
leafs,3dj7rq,NathookGD,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:56:07 2015 UTC,I still hope somehow we send bozak to the caps for a ton of draft picks or even some 22-24 year old prospects
leafs,3djnn4,hatcherhullmodano,19,Thu Jul 16 20:27:36 2015 UTC,They should wear the green St Pat's jerseys every once and awhile

leafs,3djnn4,KingInTheWest,3,Thu Jul 16 20:57:35 2015 UTC,Best jersey ever I think
leafs,3djnn4,rodimus117,13,Fri Jul 17 06:19:09 2015 UTC,It's not the oldest but I really liked and miss the winter classic jersey. Would have liked to have seen it used more. Had a good record with it too!
leafs,3djnn4,turdex,5,Thu Jul 16 21:26:39 2015 UTC,0 losses while wearing winter classic jerseys!
leafs,3djnn4,POPS_GHOSTLY,10,Fri Jul 17 13:13:33 2015 UTC,"I like the 80's version as a throwback, maybe not as an alternate. But I'd pick one up now if I could find one. Not an era that the leafs would care to acknowledge so can't imagine it happening but if they re-released them I could finally forgive my mom for throwing mine out."
leafs,3djnn4,orionbuster,2,Thu Jul 16 23:12:08 2015 UTC,They get posted all the time on eBay.  Sizing can be an issue though with vintage sizes fitting much smaller than modern.
leafs,3djnn4,POPS_GHOSTLY,2,Fri Jul 17 01:38:23 2015 UTC,"Good point about the sizing, I think that is what would make me hesitant about ordering one on ebay. I need to eye a jersey in person to make a call on it. The Marlies third jersey is a similar style, wouldn't mind one of those either."
leafs,3djnn4,madseverest,2,Fri Jul 17 03:03:52 2015 UTC,"fucking clarky eh, what a beauty"
leafs,3djnn4,jrojason,2,Fri Jul 17 04:53:36 2015 UTC,I second this.  I love the look of those jerseys.  Would definitely work well as a 3rd.
leafs,3djnn4,raptosaurus,2,Fri Jul 17 08:47:10 2015 UTC,"I like the bold colour patterns, but I'm not a fan of that Leaf. I think it would look good with the Leaf on our current thirds.   The Marlies use the same colour pattern, and they look pretty good."

leafs,3djnn4,MrWizard87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly these. Our current thirds are the nicest jerseys we have, and one of the best in the league. They should be the primary and then have a similar white one."

leafs,3djnn4,ersal,2,Fri Jul 17 01:05:12 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority here, but I really don't like these jerseys, like at all. I don't know if it's the lowercase 'n' or the way the leaf is designed but it just irks me."

leafs,3djnn4,cloud_28,9,Fri Jul 17 15:34:29 2015 UTC,The second one you posted should be the only jersey we wear
leafs,3djnn4,GreatName,8,Thu Jul 16 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"100% agree. The current Leafs logo was created by Harold Ballard, and the team hasn't won a thing in them. Going back to our original logo would be a nice way to signal another era of success."
leafs,3djnn4,cloud_28,6,Thu Jul 16 21:17:15 2015 UTC,Not to mention how much more awesome it looks
leafs,3djnn4,sillywalkr,2,Thu Jul 16 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"Actually that is not true. The current logo was created in a somewhat smaller version prior to the 1970-71 season when Stafford Smythe was running the hockey side and owned the team and the Gardens along with Ballard. Smythe died in Octoeber 1971. I agree though, the current 3rd Jersey should be the primary home and the previous 3rd whites should be primary aways."
leafs,3djnn4,Leujo,5,Fri Jul 17 02:35:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely. This with those blue shoulder lines, with the laces in front are a thing of beauty. These really should have been untouchable and never changed, like the Red Wings jerseys"

leafs,3djnn4,tak3883,5,Fri Jul 17 19:30:11 2015 UTC,Here is what we wear in our men's league. We love the classic look. BB stands for Bleed Blue. I would like the Leafs to have something simple like ours.   caption
leafs,3djnn4,Apologies_Eh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:12:42 2015 UTC,i also like that look and would like to see the leafs have a jersey with this leaf style. i have a coffee mug with that style logo and i've always been fond of it.   and i have to admit i'm a little bit jelly of your team name and jersey.
leafs,3djnn4,walrus527,3,Fri Jul 17 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"I've always been a fan of this style personally, however the OCD in me doesn't like that Toronto is arched and that the leaf isn't symmetrical. I'd be for bringing back the shoulder yoke though."
leafs,3djnn4,micatola,2,Thu Jul 16 20:34:05 2015 UTC,Yeah that logo needs to be reworked badly. I might have to take a crack at it in Illustrator.
leafs,3djnn4,Cavemandrew,2,Thu Jul 16 21:36:29 2015 UTC,Do you really have OCD?
leafs,3djnn4,walrus527,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"Not clinically but I've developed some tendencies shall we say from my mother. It's not so much debilitating so much as it's frustrating. Things need to be lined up biggest to smallest by height or size, have to put the same number strokes of deodorant under each arm, brush each side of my mouth the same amount of times both top and bottom, that kind of thing. I prefer things to be symmetrical if possible. Mum used to wipe my mouth after every bite when she fed me as a babe, bleached all my toys every night. I could go on but I think you get the point. She hates that it's called ""OCD"" because it isn't alphabetical... she refers to it as CDO."
leafs,3djnn4,sillywalkr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:23:12 2015 UTC,Actually 'Toronto' was always arced until 1970-71. Lot of success in those years. Your OCD should see that as a reason to arc it again.

leafs,3djnn4,NHLBeLeafer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"You are completely right. This time span reflects Pat Quinn's teenier with the leafs and the last time the franchise was respectable.. It would be a good starting point to pick up, symbolically, where that team left off."
leafs,3djnn4,Cavemandrew,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"I think we should just have a completely different alternate jersey. Colorado has the words COLORADO slanted in their alternate jersey, but a big foot in the middle on their home and away jersey. For the Leafs, it's always just been a blue and white jersey with the logo in the middle a bit edited. Why not bring out new colors / designs?"
leafs,3did0t,AmmarH,22,Thu Jul 16 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"I would be disappointed if the Leafs didn't at least host the draft and all star game. Look at Montreal's centennial year, they got both of those things and even wore heritage jerseys throughout the year and had an all-time team included on that years NHL game.  I would think that the Leafs should get at least that. The other thing is that the 100th leafs season is also the 100th NHL season IIRC, so that might have an effect on what the Leafs can do."

leafs,3dmdzf,jonoc4,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:11:05 2015 UTC,I'd say so. It's not like he won 100 percent of the faceoffs anyways and Steckel was one of the worst non goons we've had on the Leafs in forever so yea I'd rather Clarkson
leafs,3dmdzf,leafsbroncos18,10,Sat Jul 18 02:23:45 2015 UTC,This is the only answer. You don't just keep a player because he wins faceoffs a little more than he loses. What happens after the faceoff is more important.
leafs,3dmdzf,ersal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:25:32 2015 UTC,"And if I remember correctly, that was what Steckel was brought in to do - win faceoffs then get off the ice. This was also still back when Toronto was effectively going with three lines and the fourth line was basically Steckel and whichever facepunchers were being dressed that night. Now that being said, I believe he was also brought in specifically to help the other centers with their faceoffs (and I think that's how Bozak got better), but I could be remembering things wrong."

leafs,3dmdzf,Dougie_till_death,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:05:00 2015 UTC,Defensive zone face offs can be a difference maker.
leafs,3dmdzf,derkerbal,13,Fri Jul 17 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"All other things being equal, sure, but it takes on average about 76 [1] faceoff wins to equal one goal differential either way.  Tyler Bozak won faceoffs 7% more often than Kadri last year, but that means he has to take 1085 faceoffs before his advantage amounts to one goal.  If player A is 1% better than player B defensively excluding faceoffs, but has a 10% lower faceoff percentage ... you're still better off putting player A out there for the draw overall.  For penalty kills starting in the defensive zone, it takes 35 faceoff wins to save a goal, so that is whare faceoffs are most important.  Say there are 3.5 faceoffs per PK (makes the numbers nice, and probably isn't far off).  Then, after 100 PKs, player B will have saved a goal assuming he plays the full PP.  On the other hand, assuming an 85% PK, player A would only save 1% * 15 or 0.15 goals.  So on the PK you need player A to be 1/0.15 or ~7% better defensively to make up for their lack of faceoff ability.  We probably have centers, whether they're Kadri or someone else, who are at least 7% better than Bozak both defensively and offensively.  Therefore, I don't think it ever made sense to have Bozak taking critical faceoffs, even on special teams where they're most important.  TL;DR - The importance of faceoffs is hugely overrated by a lot of people in hockey.  This is not surprising, because they appeal extremely well to the eye test - highly visible events where there's an immediately observable outcome that is easily interpreted and for the most part can be attributed to a single player on each team.  IMHO, faceoffs, along with stats like hits, are the poster child for the cognitive biases that the ""eye test"" introduces, and why it's useful to dig deeper into ""advanced"" stats.

It's something like that. I can't remember the actual ages, hopefully someone can pickup on that.   Traditional mainstream analysts love placing great importance on faceoffs. They really are a small part of the game.   It is nice having a go to guy late in the game for key draws, however; in the bigger picture they aren't as important as made out to be."

Sure, there are times when you need a big defensive zone faceoff win, and also sometimes on the PP. However, the question is, do teams really need a faceoff specialist? For example, you talk about Steckel, is it worth having a roster spot for a guy who isn't very good on the offensive end, and isn't particularly good defensively over a guy like Komorov who does so much more for a team off the puck?   Someone like Rod Brind'Amour, however is a different story. A skilled two way player who was also good at faceoffs. Its an added bonus, but not something I think you should sign someone for if there are glaring holes in their game."

Along with being the most efficient face-off man in the NHL at the time, Perreault put up 52 points in 76 games before they let him walk.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.   Hopefully things have changed now, but at the time ownership was just happy to have the Leafs be a playoff team and making headlines in the Toronto media. Still also relevant a couple of years ago as the only explanation as to why Clarkson was signed."
leafs,3dmdzf,Snizzin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:55 2015 UTC,There's other aspects to the game other than just faceoffs?
leafs,3dmdzf,Jwhits22,3,Fri Jul 17 13:23:28 2015 UTC,"The theme here seems to be face off wins are unimportant relative to other characteristics required in a Center..  For someone who hasn't bothered to read analytics supporting such a claim.. my question is..  There is such a deep emphasis placed on puck possession supported by analytics, rather than the older school dump and chase theory or the like..  So why would face offs be deemed unimportant if puck possession is largely determined by a face off? Especially since they made the hash marks further separate players off the draw.  And yes I understand the importance of other qualities in a Center, however, it seems this specific quality is what most here are arguing to be pointless to even look at..  Lost face off =/= puck possession  If you lose 60+% of face offs, that means you are starting 60+% of plays without the puck..   What am I missing here?"
leafs,3dmdzf,NathookGD,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:07 2015 UTC,Difference between good faceoff player and average faceoff player is small 2. Faceoffs make up a very small fraction of possession exchanges 3.

leafs,3dmdzf,Jwhits22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"I just find it hard to buy that a team like Toronto who struggles defensively, can say that starting without the puck is meaningless.. I would need more stats like goals against after a lost face off.. stats I don't have the time to see if it supports my theory or not. I realize there are more variables that make a difference as well.  I get average versus stellar.. but I still don't buy a 60% face off guy would not be seen considerably more valuable than 40%.. all other things being equal."

leafs,3dikma,WillMountain,3,Fri Jul 17 12:22:22 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how I posted earlier that I would respond to questions, I figure I'll try to answer yours. People who are interested in the Leafs are probably only interested in seeing Dangle's podcast here, and anyone else who attempts to provide competition or supplant what they're doing over there with something different is seen as ""jumping on the bandwagon"" or ""just trying to be like Steve Dangle"" or ""spamming"". Those people are entitled to their own opinion, and while the thread is sitting at 0 overall but also having a large number of votes cast overall, it's seemingly divided 50/50. We're okay with that. We just want people to listen and judge for themselves. If we're terrible, we want to know so that we can improve. We know we have to improve on a number of things moving forward, but there's a plan in place to improve the quality of this podcast. I've done radio interviews before and used to have a podcast in 2012, so I'm more well-versed in this than Steve, but we both have to build up our chops. If people don't like it right now, that's fine, downvote away, but we're still going to be posting and doing this weekly, and it won't get any worse.  I believe we offer something unique from the Dangle podcast that could be a nice complement to what they do. I have great respect for Dangle and I've been following him since he started making videos back when I was in 1st year university. To see him do what he's done and how is really inspiring and awesome, so yes, he's a large influence on us, but that doesn't mean we're out of line in attempting to do something on our own.   We're glad you think it's great :) It means a lot in the early stages to hear that. Steve and I have known each other for years now, but we've never done this kind of thing together, so if the chemistry isn't quite there yet, it will get there. We can be long-winded at times, but it is very difficult not to do so when talking about complex issues such as professional sports, statistics and business management. We're trying to cut down on what we're saying, and to poorly paraphrase what Justin Bourne said on the last Danglecast: ""Nobody cares about the first four lines of your articles. You can usually just delete them."" The same can probably be said about speaking. We're consciously trying to trim the fat and make this better and better every week. while avoiding being formulaic. Like I said earlier, there is a short term plan to make what we do really great, and there's a longer-term plan to increase the production quality of the show and eventually get video going and set up to Youtube. Might even dip our toes into livestreaming, but that's way down the line and we would need funding and time to do that effectively.   Here I am giving a long winded response that's trying to explain our podcast's purpose!   The point is, thank you for the support. Don't worry about the downvotes. There appears to be plenty of folks upvoting and enjoying what we're doing, but there seem to be just as many who see us as ""Bizarro Dangle"" as soon as they see the word podcast here. That's cool too, and if they listen to us and genuinely still believe that, I hope they say so and why such that we can further differentiate ourselves, but so far all our feedback has been either positive or very constructive.

I suppose it's possible to increase your squat by 100lb in a month but that's huge and I've never known anyone to do it unless maybe they're a dedicated beginner. I mean barring PEDs, you'd probably have to be pretty bad and then completely commit for a month to increase that much.  So I guess I'd be curious if 250lb was his personal best up to training here, which I sorta doubt but who knows, trainers nowadays are always PhD kinesiologists or some other type of doctor and they're magicians with committed individuals.

More strength should also help him on the draw where if he can't win it cleanly he should be at least able to tie the other guy up and let his wingers help out.

London is small enough that if he ended up there someone would talk about it the next day, so I guess I'm saying Kadri never frequented the place.  There's a lot of hockey players that come to London in the off-season. Doughty, Prust, Schremp, Perry, Bolland etc. but they're all smart enough to behave themselves in public by now. Prust is the man though a buddy introduced me to him and the guy is so down to earth I didn't think it was him."

But definelty possible in someone who has gym experience but didn't work on form and progressive workouts etc at all.
leafs,3dg52k,SMORKIN_LABBIT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:01 2015 UTC,So he increased his squat by close to 100 lbs in a month and a half?    Right...

leafs,3dg52k,Polarsight,6,Thu Jul 16 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"Meh, if you're constantly training you can easily increase your squat by 10-20 pounds a week. I myself, doing a 5x5 SL program increased my squat from 95lbs-195lbs in 8 weeks. And I was only training 3 times a week.   The only thing I took was protein shakes and vitamins. The rule of SL is to increase your squat by 5kg every time you train. The goal is to do 5 sets of 5 reps at that weight. If you fail to do that, you stick to that same weight for the next workout. You only do 3 exercises per day but you do the 5x5 for each. The only thing is, you squat EVERY single time. The other two workouts change every day but the squat is regular. You will be amazed by what your body can achieve."

leafs,3dg52k,Polarsight,8,Thu Jul 16 02:32:51 2015 UTC,"We’re talking about someone who was squatting maybe a little more than 250 pounds before and he’s already squatting about 345 pounds at this point   I know what you're saying, it gets more difficult as you up the weight.   But I'm very sure they downplayed his previous weight he squatted. 250lbs for a professional athlete in his position is really not impressive.  He prob squatted at least 300lbs before, so 345lbs is a bit more believable in that perspective. Don't forget, professional athletes have some of the very best and latest diets. They also have access to the best personal trainers.  We'd probably be pretty jacked if we got paid to work out every day."
leafs,3dg52k,Letsbebff,3,Thu Jul 16 03:31:42 2015 UTC,"The trainer never said, ""one max rep"" or gave any inclination of how he was squatting the 250lbs. Maybe his previous trainer told him to just bang out consistent reps of 250lbs and that he'd be in good shape and his new one is actually pushing him to improve his squats. Who knows?"

leafs,3dg52k,SMORKIN_LABBIT,9,Thu Jul 16 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"oh, I wasn't trying to come off as knowing... just saying as someone who isn't exactly an athlete, I was able to add 100lbs to my squat in 8 weeks going 3 times a week.   Kadri is working out 5-6 times a week and is an athlete. He is also working out with a personal trainer who will focus his workouts to ensure he is stretching correctly and eating properly. One of the most important things with working out, that I found was flexibility is SO important.   Anyway, the point is, I doubt the guy is taking PED's. He's very likely taking creatine or some other pretty normal over the counter 'drugs'."
leafs,3dg52k,theboyblue,5,Thu Jul 16 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"Ya but you're starting from way below your body weight (i'm assuming you hadn't squatted before and started at 95 to get the form down?). As your numbers go up into double or triple body weight you start to plateau big time and given Kadri's size, squatting more than two plates then adding an extra 100 in six weeks would be very impressive. Not saying impossible but it does raise suspicion."
leafs,3dg52k,petey92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:11 2015 UTC,Yeah you're probably right. I did hit a plateau and it was much tougher to get past. I broke a leg and since then haven't been able to get back in the gym the same way. (Broke it playing pick up soccer :( )

My squat isn't that high (270x5) but it's a struggle to add weight like I used to and that's squatting ~3 times a week. If I heard he added 50lbs that would make a little more sense.

Iginla took a few years and Calgary developed him amazingly, he was able to impact them 3 years into his tenure.   I think Kadri does get a lot of shit though especially because of rumours (false?) about his use of drugs and overall character off the ice.

Apparently Toronto is known around the league as being pretty bad in terms of its players' drug habits.  Like, in the same company as LA bad.

All I am aware of is his diving and the silly juvenile things he does on the ice. People gush about his off-ice stuff though.  All the major sports are very good about systemic racism, and really, it's in the nature of sport.  Yeah you still have idiots who did that stuff to Simmons, and that's not to be understated.

leafs,3dg0fd,BlueNWhite1,2,Thu Jul 16 04:35:45 2015 UTC,The problem with your strategy is that he may pull what other college players have done and become a free agent at the end of his 3 years.
leafs,3dg0fd,justinv62,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:44:31 2015 UTC,"Think he'd need 4 years for that, and if the Leafs are still bad then, which is a possibility, and treat him well, then he'd have no problem signing I'd think. Also, prefer him in OHL for development reasons, just wouldn't blame him for going college route."
leafs,3dg0fd,the_goldenpony,9,Thu Jul 16 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"I think Bracco on the Kitchener Rangers (2013 OHL Priority Selection) would be more beneficial for his development. He'll have the chance to play up to 68 games rather than 42. Plus, it's a league for his size and a better chance to showcase his talent."
leafs,3dg0fd,dogfb,18,Thu Jul 16 00:28:15 2015 UTC,And I'm from kitchener so I could go see him play. He should really think about that when making his decision.

leafs,3dg0fd,loltdubs,2,Thu Jul 16 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"I think he could develop into a beast in both leagues. College helps his physical game, and the OHL would let his technical ability shine.

Finn's been getting heat because of his performance last year, however Dubas stated that he sees him rebounding well.   Heres what my thoughts are in order of category:  1) Percy, Harrington, Finn  2) Percy as of now, but Finn could really up his game.  3) Percy - No.4  Harrington - No.5/6 Finn (if all pans out) - No.4 with PP potential"

leafs,3dfs1t,MoreHtsThnSadaharuOh,2,Thu Jul 16 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"I thought this recent interview with Matt Finn was really interesting. He fully owns the fact that he didn't train hard enough last year, and as a result, his season suffered. Having seen him play in the OHL, and hearing how he understands the level of fitness he needs to have to success in the NHL, I think he may possess the highest upside.

I have never been one of the Klein believers when he was in Nashville who thought he was a top 4 guy, but as a bottom pairing guy, he's compotent who can play as a #4 on small stretches. I think Harrington is a safe bet to reach at least 100 NHL games and if he sticks Klein is the type of outlook I'd say he has."
leafs,3dfs1t,justinv62,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:49:30 2015 UTC,"Harrington will play a far larger part for the Leafs than the other two in the long run, and if he plays more physical he can easily be a 3/4 shut down d-man for us. Really don't understand why he's so looked over, not every player on our roster needs to get 100 points a game and this guy can log big minutes and is great defensively."

leafs,3dd6z4,CatalystCoin,7,Wed Jul 15 13:16:18 2015 UTC,"Percy played a few games in the NHL last year and showed that he was already very close to being ready. I was actually very surprised when they sent him back down, it might have been the smart move. He did get injured after and that could have hampered his development, who knows."
leafs,3dd6z4,theboyblue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:42 2015 UTC,"I think injuries are a real concern for Percy at this point. Earlier I might've said he has real top 4 potential, but at this point I'm really not sure. Either way, I agree with OP that Connor Brown is a far better prospect than Leipsic or Percy - with no offense intended to those two, who are still good prospects."
leafs,3dd6z4,psychicoctopusSP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know because I don't watch Marlies games. I guess I base most of my thoughts on scouting reports. Either way, this is a wicked problem to have! I don't think any of the three will be star top 6 forwards/top 2 defenceman but I can easily see at least 1/3 becoming a very big contributor in the future."
leafs,3dd6z4,theboyblue,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:23:15 2015 UTC,Leipsic hasn't played in the NHL either.
leafs,3dd6z4,jonoc4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:26 2015 UTC,I mean. It's not like Leipsic is anymore safe. He's not bigger. He's not faster.
leafs,3dd6z4,Aintboutdatlyfe,2,Wed Jul 15 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sure how Leipsic is above him. They're the same age and Brown had a better rookie year in the AHL."
leafs,3dd6z4,drspg99,4,Wed Jul 15 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"I think the top 3 are unanimous, but in the 4 and 5 slot you couldn't go wrong with any of: Brown, Goat, Leipsic, Percy, Johnson"
leafs,3dd6z4,Tubby_McFatFuuk,4,Wed Jul 15 15:54:33 2015 UTC,"Don't like this article. Marner is perceived as gritty and two way for some reason. And Nylander is ""small"" despite being bigger than Marner.   Everything else other than claiming Marner will be better than Kessel is ok."
leafs,3dd6z4,Jad94,4,Thu Jul 16 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly kind of a garbage list in my opinion. Marner and Nylander at 1 and 2 is obvious, but why does the writer bash Nylanders size for a center but not Marner (who is smaller)? Seems like not very objective thinking. Also, Connor Brown not being in the top 5 is quite silly, this is a guy who's won the OHL scoring title, and the AHL rookie scoring title. He's improved every year but it looks like he's being overlooked because he wasn't drafted in the first 2 rounds."
leafs,3dd6z4,jrojason,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:27 2015 UTC,I would put brown and johnson above leipsic
leafs,3dd6z4,cloud_28,2,Wed Jul 15 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sincerely concerned with Johnson's transition to North America. His greatest offensive ability comes from finding open space and there's going to be significantly less of that in NA. Brown I would definitely put over Leipsic, but I think Johnson and Leipsic are very similar in overall chance of making an impact in the NHL."
leafs,3dd6z4,riversfan17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"I 100 percent agree with you. Thats been my concern for a while. But hes fast, skates well and has a nice shot. It could work out well. I wish the leafs would bring him over to north america to let him start to adapt.  I also agree with your last statement. My key difference is that Johnsons cieling is much higher imo. He could evolve into a second line winger, which is why i put him above leip"
leafs,3dd6z4,cloud_28,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree Johnson has a higher ceiling and a lower floor. The question is what are we defining as the ""best prospect"". I'm guessing you're going on ""most upside"" and I'm going on ""most likely to make an impact in the NHL"". Simple issue of defining the terms of a debate, and I think if we did that we'd be in total agreement.   Since the article put Leipsic and Percy in over Brown and Johnson, I'm guessing they were going on my definition but who knows.."
leafs,3dd6z4,riversfan17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:34:08 2015 UTC,Have you seen Johnson play at all? His numbers are impressive and he looks like a freaking tank from the pictures taken at prospect camp but apart from a few youtube clips I have never seen him play.

leafs,3dd6z4,cloud_28,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"Numbers are enough to make a judgement, IIRC he was top 5 in shots in the entire SHL. Very impressive at his age. I'd put him ahead of both Brown and Leipsic, just behind Kapanen."
leafs,3dd6z4,NathookGD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:15:24 2015 UTC,"I've watched him play maybe 8-10 games, so SSS but he really has a wicked shot. He's a finisher, but perhaps paired up with Brown or another playmaker he could really thrive. He's got the wheels and the skills to be an NHLer, quite frankly. It's just a matter of how he adjusts to the smaller ice. His points and domination of the SHL as a young kid suggests he has really high potential."
leafs,3dd6z4,psychicoctopusSP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:54:48 2015 UTC,I am so excited for him to make the jump over to NA. When he won SHL rookie of the year the same year as Conner Brown winning OHL player of the year it was the first time ever I have gotten legitimately excited about our prospect pool!
leafs,3dd6z4,canadian_bakin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:56:28 2015 UTC,"If Leipsic is younger than Johnson I get it, he has had a good year in North America so, slightly more proven."

leafs,3dd6z4,Wellhowboutdat,14,Wed Jul 15 13:53:28 2015 UTC,Marner is known to be a very physical player who is constantly working hard to get the puck
leafs,3dd6z4,cloud_28,2,Wed Jul 15 14:23:24 2015 UTC,TIL. Thanks for clarifying. Didnt get the chance to watch him much.
leafs,3dd6z4,Wellhowboutdat,2,Wed Jul 15 14:39:21 2015 UTC,Anytime. He's a pretty complete player. His weakest points would be his weight and his shot (which isnt terrible).
leafs,3dd6z4,cloud_28,2,Wed Jul 15 14:52:24 2015 UTC,I may have just assumed that light weight = not gritty.  Thx again.
leafs,3dd6z4,Wellhowboutdat,4,Wed Jul 15 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"Common mistake. Marner is much more physical then strome, for example."

leafs,3dd6z4,NocturnalWiji,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:18:48 2015 UTC,Marner is projected to be a center? I thought he was more of a winger.

leafs,3dd6z4,jonoc4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"No idea. I think Brown should be ahead of him. Same age, better development the last 2 years."
leafs,3dgq5f,InternationalCow,11,Thu Jul 16 03:27:51 2015 UTC,"Not to sound pessimistic, but I wasn't even really able to tell what part of the play they were talking about. There wasn't anything particularly impressive in the clip."
leafs,3dgq5f,Xer0day,2,Thu Jul 16 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"Wheeled around the net with ease without any bulky strides, dished to the the late guy coming in. He did the little things pretty smooth, nothing flashy. Showed good vision to get that pass off, that would be the most ""impressive"" part.   Assuming that's him, right? I'm tipsy tbh I'm not sure"
leafs,3dgq5f,lmHuge,8,Thu Jul 16 04:34:18 2015 UTC,I guess. Still a very typical play.
leafs,3dgq5f,Xer0day,6,Thu Jul 16 04:35:17 2015 UTC,Might be but you'll be surprised how many prospects in a camp like that wouldn't be able to do that as easy as it looks.
leafs,3dgq5f,lmHuge,2,Thu Jul 16 04:46:03 2015 UTC,"I would hope every prospect would be able to make that play, it's a standard play. Especially once you get into junior and the pros. the pass was alright though, but the play was supposed to highlight his skating"
leafs,3dgq5f,Xer0day,2,Thu Jul 16 11:02:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I meant the pass
leafs,3dgq5f,lmHuge,2,Thu Jul 16 12:01:34 2015 UTC,"Same. He protected the puck and skated around the net; a very basic play that most beer leaguers could make. The pass was pretty nifty, though."

leafs,3ddf6p,AutoModerator,18,Wed Jul 15 12:02:33 2015 UTC,Anyone else think we are keeping lupes bozak and all these one year deals to let our guys mature then bring up like 6-7 guys next year who already have chemistry together and know the systems?
leafs,3ddf6p,malabericus,14,Wed Jul 15 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"It's not outside of the realm of possibility.  I think Lupul may be ours for the duration of his contract.   He usually plays hard and can show some really nice flashes of talent.  I don't think the leafs are going to want to eat any more salary so he may be sticking around.   I am hoping for Bozak to get traded, I think he does have value but he might be making too much money for a 2B/3A center in the league."
leafs,3ddf6p,Dubscityg,2,Wed Jul 15 12:31:56 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I can see bozak going at the deadline or next draft. He's good in the short term to let guys get settled in but he does make a bit too long and isn't really in our long term plans.   Lupes is tough. Awesome guy. Has a lot of talent puts in hard minutes. But it seems like he's hurt so often and when he's healthy he's pretty streaky. I do think we will end up riding it out with him
leafs,3ddf6p,malabericus,5,Wed Jul 15 12:39:35 2015 UTC,I can't see how you can trade Lupul. And I don't think packaging him with picks or prospects is a smart move if we don't need the cap space. I think we're stuck with him because he's untradeable.
leafs,3ddf6p,Bobs_Your_Zio,4,Wed Jul 15 12:41:08 2015 UTC,I think we're stuck with him because he's untradeable.   We thought the same thing about David Clarkson and yet here we are.

leafs,3ddf6p,malabericus,3,Wed Jul 15 12:40:40 2015 UTC,"Its a good plan, at least to me. Theres no need to rush people out for less than their worth, and no need to hang our prospects out to dry if the team is getting bullied.   Give lupul time to shine, and if he does well, flip him at the deadline. If not, the Marlies will dominate and hopefully those guys develop nicely"
leafs,3ddf6p,bringmethefunk,4,Wed Jul 15 12:44:36 2015 UTC,Added bonus to having those guys get playoff experience. Let them have a deep run. Then we can flip guys for picks/just let their contracts expire.  Then next year we bring up nylander/kapenan/marner/brown/loov/Percy/Finn? etc etc. Or whoever stands out by years end a entire group of guys.  They would all(minus marner) have people they know in the locker room. And all know how to share the ice and have a feeling how a third of the team plays already.  Think about it. Half the struggle to new players is finding chemistry/comradely and learning how the team wants you to play.  Bam now all our high upside guys have a much better chance for success. Which in a long term rebuild should be the goal. Set your young guys up with the best possible chance to grow and succeed. Playing/transition/culture wise. It's all important to do it all at once.   But what do I know. I'm just the dude on Reddit ;)
leafs,3ddf6p,malabericus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:04:42 2015 UTC,What makes you think Finn would get promoted as early as next year? He was in the ECHL for a lot of last year and was injured. I think it'll take longer than that

Edit: it amazes me and saddens me to think there are so many Leafs fans who haven't been around a winning team, to see why Phil WAS a problem. He is who he is, that's not his fault... But that doesn't void him of any blame in the shitty culture and work ethics that rub off on the rest of the team."

leafs,3dc6x9,Spwud,2,Thu Jul 16 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a bit of a difference between the two. The Leafs of the 90s and 2000s made the playoffs, but they didn't win anything.  I'm also old enough to remember the teams of the late 90s and early 2000s but I'm not going to bring it up like they were amazing teams that won anything. They were decent teams carried on playoff runs by Sundin and Joseph/Belfour."

leafs,3dc6x9,Spwud,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:31 2015 UTC,"""it amazes me and saddens me to think there are so many Leafs fans who haven't been around a winning team.""  Yes, they completed and played hard but they didn't win anything. You have never seen, and there's not a single person in this sub who has seen, a winning team. The teams of Gilmour and Sundin were good teams, they weren't winning teams.  The team not winning is not all on Kessel. It's on the rest of the team and management too. Everyone always seems to try and blame one player like they did with Sundin. The guys like Kessel and Sundin held up their part of the deal. Kessel scored goals and was an amazing playmaker, Sundin was the best player on and off the ice night in and night out. Management should get the most blame for never putting a winning team together."

He doesn't go down on one knee though.  EDIT: HERE'S an example of him doing the one knee shot.
leafs,3dc6x9,PassTheSyrup,3,Wed Jul 15 05:49:49 2015 UTC,"I love that first goal, that and his game 6 goal against the Bruins are my most memorable goals during his time here"

leafs,3dc6x9,TheKert,5,Wed Jul 15 22:27:40 2015 UTC,How often had Phil had a center who can set him up to take a one timer?
leafs,3dc6x9,AvecFromage,10,Wed Jul 15 12:52:49 2015 UTC,It's his flex that prevents it though. He's flubbed on the few one-timers he's taken because of it.
leafs,3dc6x9,Truxa,3,Wed Jul 15 14:13:16 2015 UTC,He got a new stick near the end of the season and he actually started trying one timers.
leafs,3dc6x9,TheKert,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah true, and not just one timers, you don't see him taking slap shots in general very often. I recall one standout slap shot (goal I believe) from last season, but half the reason it stood out was how infrequently you see him take a shot like that. He's all about the wrister, and he may well be the best in the league at it, so stick to what works.  I do wonder though what sort of things we'll see more of from Phil in Pittsburgh as a result of playing with Sid or Gino though. Certainly that should give him more scoring options and it will be interesting to see what elements he can add to his game with that."

Funny how it's done against Pittsburgh too.  Edit: And this one as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2sfoc4y2-0  It's cool how when you try to remember very specific plays that date back a few years your mind can come up with it.

He went from self centered wannabe sniper to 2 way all around team player, gaining the size he needed to gain (and more) in two seasons to make the roster.

leafs,3daznp,darkkness,5,Wed Jul 15 02:35:32 2015 UTC,Maybe he was also doing deadlifts and didn't want to scrape the shit out of his shins? What does it even matter anyways?
leafs,3daznp,theboyblue,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:40:00 2015 UTC,Have you ever actually done HIIT training or muscle mass training? If you aren't wearing long socks to the gym you look like an idiot doing those exercises.

leafs,3daznp,theboyblue,0,Wed Jul 15 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it is still preference when doing HIIT, however, when you see people weightlifting huge weights they are most likely wearing long socks or track pants. The bars can hurt a lot, and like someone said earlier when deadlifting you really don't want to pull that bar up against your skin.   There are also a lot of other workouts like the snatch, clean and jerk, lunges (to an extent) that you want to wear long socks.   Also, most if not all hockey players/soccer players wear long socks as habit."
leafs,3daznp,commander2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"Cool. I was mostly asking because I wondered how long socks would do anything in HIIT. I get it though, I only wear track pants on deadlift days."

leafs,3d9dh0,thedrivingcat,38,Tue Jul 14 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"He's really determined to make the jump to the NHL, which is only good news for us. I hope that kind of attitude spreads to our other prospects.  EDIT: He's going to make it really hard for management to keep him in the AHL this year. He knew what the knock against him was (his size), worked his ass off to bulk up, and by his comments/attitude seems determined to make the jump sooner rather than later. While the smart play would probably be to keep him in the AHL for this season, I think he could make the case that he's ready after his 9 game regular season stint."
leafs,3d9dh0,loco_canadian,28,Tue Jul 14 15:04:49 2015 UTC,I think we can see him in the NHL after we ship people off for picks at the trade deadline.

leafs,3d9dh0,marksk88,4,Tue Jul 14 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"Why bring him up if we're doing shitty and he's having a great year in the AHL?  If the Marlies are poised for a playoff run I think it's best we leave him down there for the entire year.  Even if he gets the most points in the AHL, leave him down there still.  Make it known to him that NO MATTER WHAT he plays the whole year there, so he doesn't have to worry about anything else but his game.  I really don't see the benefit in getting games at the end of the season.  It will be a literal shit show with the media if he gets called up.  Let him start the season with the team and earn a spot right out of camp (next season).  My two cents."
leafs,3d9dh0,poppinmollies,4,Tue Jul 14 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"At the same time, it's a HUGE incentive to other prospects if management rewards his commitment.

leafs,3d9dh0,thismadhatter,17,Tue Jul 14 15:10:22 2015 UTC,"Yah, but if he makes the team he needs to be in the top six.  I'd rather see him playing first line minutes for the Marlies than in a 3rd or 4th line roll with the Leafs.    But either way, what a dream boat."
leafs,3d9dh0,Dubscityg,10,Tue Jul 14 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the best thing we could do is for Nylander to be 1C for the Marlies next year. I'm very interested to see what he and Marner can do playing a full year of top centre. Nylander is still a prospect so a full year in the AHL would be great for his development. He's very likely to make the jump to the NHL in the 16-17 season"

leafs,3d9dh0,walrus527,5,Tue Jul 14 15:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see him win in the AHL then lose in the NHL. The Leafs are not going to be a good team next year, but the Marlies will be. I'd much rather him be down there in that enviroment.  Additionally, I'd rather give one of these new guys a chance to play top 6 minute so that we can swap them at deadline for picks. Generally speakinh more min=more points=higher trade value at the deadline.   I don't think theres enough benifit for him playing in the NHL to outweight the negative."

Management is preaching to be patient, and the smart thing to do is to keep him in the AHL for a year, but I think he's going to be ready a lot sooner than people think."
leafs,3d9dh0,loco_canadian,2,Tue Jul 14 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"I think he quite possibly makes the jump but I kind of want to keep him down purely to help the Leafs tank, shelter him from the media a bit longer until he can hit the league and pull a Nyquist.  Rather him be over ripe than come up prematurely as well.  Would be fun to see him and Kapanan, others light up the AHL as well.  We need to let our 1-2 year contracts shine this season as well so we can flip them for a bunch of picks again at the deadline.  Hopefully Lupul can be health going into the deadline and getting fulltime first line minutes he can bring in a decent return as well."

I just hope he can stay healthy enough for us to move him for a first.  He used to be one of my favorite leafs too until he disappeared and was injured the last two seasons. Edit: I failed at clarifying why I brought Lupul up, I figure Nylander will take time from him especially on the PP which would likely hurt his #s and trade value."

Let him play 20 - 25 minutes a night, playing top PP minutes, give him a chance on the PK, let him take important faceoffs, and play 5 of the last 8 minutes of every important game.    If that takes 3 months, so be it, bring him in and gdddy-up, but if that takes 12 months, that's fine too.  I'd rather have a big-game ready centreman than a winger learning the ropes on the fly on a mediocre to bad team.    Having said all that, give him the 9 games and if he shows he's ready, then he's ready.  Give him a jersey and a seat on the plane and let him go."

Only reason to keep him down at this point would be to work on his defensive game. I just hope leafs management won't keep down players that are ready to make the jump just because they are afraid of ""rushing"" them. Some players need the next level of competition to improve, some need to get confidence and dominate the AHL for a while.

leafs,3d9dh0,jrojason,4,Tue Jul 14 17:43:14 2015 UTC,I find a hard time believing that you can keep a player in the AHL too long and damage their development. Far more often players are called up too soon.

leafs,3daeqk,I-Argue-With-Myself,7,Tue Jul 14 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"I was sure he was going to make the team, but with all these FA signings, I'm not sure there's a spot for him, unless management has no qualms about sending a more ""established"" player down if they get ouplayed."

With his work ethic he's gonna force a lot of other prospects to work harder than him to make the lineup.  I think he's the perfect player to have sitting on the bubble
leafs,3daeqk,mlhs_aaron,3,Tue Jul 14 23:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think the fight for 12th and 13th forward will be between Leivo, Frattin, Carrick and one of Hyman or Bailey as a dark horse."
leafs,3daeqk,GunzComeOut13,4,Tue Jul 14 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, has it been confirmed that he is the Marlies Captain next season. Or is it just speculation on their part?"
leafs,3d9yu1,Seacord,6,Tue Jul 14 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"The only thing I have to disagree with is looking at any of the players we're picking up in FA now as important pieces in our team 4-5 years from now.   Not saying they won't be, but I wouldn't view them under that light, at least until the end of next season."
leafs,3d9yu1,MoBizziness,3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:56 2015 UTC,Where I thought he was going with that was that If you trade every player you sign at the deadline you gain a reputation and perhaps damage your chances of getting players on short term deals in the future.  He didn't though. Instead he did what we're often guilty of as leafs fans and started over-valuing our own guys just because they happen to wear blue and white. They haven't played a game yet and he's getting attached.
leafs,3d9yu1,TheJulian,11,Tue Jul 14 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think what he means is that we shouldn't label our FA signings as deadline flips. Technically Kadri is also on one year (same position as our 1-year signings) but nobody sees him as deadline flip if he plays well. It is a bit out of context since Kadri probably has higher ceiling than any of our FA signings and younger than most.   But I definitely agree with this notion of the leafs fans attempting to label anything in order to feel more secured about our future. (i.e. how long our rebuild will be, we need to tank hard next year, must flip as many players for picks, lupul/ph9/bozak will never have their careers revived and therefore dead-weights) We shouldn't think this way and everything should be case by case."
leafs,3d9yu1,tkang1234567,10,Tue Jul 14 19:26:21 2015 UTC,"You're right. People are misinterpreting this, dangle's point is we shouldn't accept these players being flipped for picks as a forgone conclusion, as it isn't the best case scenario. Keeping quality players is."
leafs,3d9yu1,look_closer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"Keeping quality players is, as long as they aren't taking a significant cap hit, especially since most of the pickups are depth players at best.  If any of these guys have a good season, they are going to want to get paid. The reason  most of these pickups are favorable is because they are all willing to take cheap contracts in hopes of raising their own value for their next contract, thing is most of these guys are close to 30, and I wouldn't expect the Leafs to invest too much into these types of players unless they are REALLY outstanding, even then I'd be surprised because of age. Exploiting the market at trade deadline in the second half of the season is the best way for us to stock up for futures, especially this early on in the rebuild.   I could see them looking to keep more players if we were 2-3 years down the road in our rebuild already, but I doubt they would start hanging on to the older FA pick ups this early in the rebuild."

Lupul has no value. He can't play a full season. If he somehow stays healthy and puts up good numbers this year I could see him move at the deadline though.  I'm guessing that Bozak has already been shopped but there are no serious buyers. I could only see him moving at the deadline, like Lupul."

Where he plays in the lineup is kind of irrelevant right now.  Realistically they are probably going to keep playing Phaneuf for top line minutes. Our team is going to suck next year regardless. Phaneuf can provide value to us by eating up minutes so we don't need to run our young defensemen into the ground.

leafs,3d9ueh,InternationalCow,6,Tue Jul 14 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, when the best player on a team is traded, the real value is not in the return. It is in clearing the deck and allowing for a new identity to take shape.   This. When you stand in someone's shadow, it's easier to escape the heat of responsibility. As good as Kessel is, his departure will force our youngsters to step up and mature quicker in order to fill the void he left behind. This alone makes the trade worthwhile."
leafs,3d9ueh,ahal,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that Kessel didn't have a good enough supporting cast is true but not necessarily managements fault in the grand scheme of things. Going back to when Wilson was here he had very strong opinions on what Kessel's shortcomings were. I think they realized quite quickly that Kessel needed some serious help to be both productive offensively and covered for defensively. They needed players around Phil that would have to be Selke candidates every year. To get that they would have had to trade assets or spend like drunken sailors during free-agency. Even when you get the player(s) you think will help there's no guarantee that there will be any chemistry or that defensive problems will disappear.  I think this rebuild unofficially started back when they decided not to take this chance and I don't blame them. They went with what they had and basically just let it all play out. Had Kessel been the type of player that took charge at both ends of the ice, played with some tenacity and made other around him better instead of wanting for better linemates, I think it's possible this plays out differently. Maybe the trade and rebuild still happens and the return is more significant but the net result might have been a lot worse in regards to long term success had we given up picks and/or prospects trying to insulate Kessel. Imagine if we had given up more 1st or 2nd round picks and/or good prospects trying to insulate Kessel only to have the rebuild happen anyway?"
leafs,3d9ueh,micatola,3,Tue Jul 14 19:27:11 2015 UTC,"I think they realized quite quickly that Kessel needed some serious help to be both productive offensively and covered for defensively.    This would actually make their decision to play him with the likes of Lupul, Bozak, JVR and Phaneuf, often at the same time, even more confusing. If you know a guy's bad at defense, why do you put him with players that are every bit as bad defensively as he is?  That's the biggest argument against management IMO, and it persists from Burke to Nonis. If they recognized Kessel's defensive inadequacies, it's on them to try to mitigate them, and instead they magnified them by keeping him on the ice with 3-4 guys who were as bad as he was as any given time."
leafs,3d9ueh,McArthurParka,2,Tue Jul 14 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah they really didn't have anyone better for the most part. Kadri was probably one of the few guys who could have worked but for some reason they kept him and Kessel apart. (Maybe they didn't want Kadri to develop bad habits?) Still, they really shouldn't have to insulate him from anything. He should be even somewhat defensively responsible or he's only half a player."
leafs,3d9ueh,micatola,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"I think given extended time and a well structured game could have turned a Winnik-Kadri-Kessel line into something at least passable as a first line. Kadri is developing his game and is becoming a pretty good player, and Winnik and Kessel could do a fine balancing act on the wings (as far as distributing offensive and defensive responsibilities goes).  Not to mention Winnik is skilled enough to at least get open and contribute a bit offensively."

leafs,3d90kk,optimal_optimist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:46:35 2015 UTC,"It does, because a young team isn't going to develop properly without experienced guys in each position."
leafs,3d90kk,mattattaxx,5,Wed Jul 15 20:02:12 2015 UTC,7) Nobody wants him.
leafs,3d90kk,178239104511126,0,Tue Jul 14 15:36:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm gonna say the more likely reason is the market for Phaneuf is weak right now and the Leafs aren't willing to take garbage back (which they shouldn't).
leafs,3d90kk,newbo750,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"Cap space isn't garbage. It is way more valuable going forward than an overpaid, miscast 2nd pairing d-man."
leafs,3d90kk,178239104511126,2,Tue Jul 14 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Gardiner and Rielly are both better than Phaneuf, Marincin probably will be soon too"
leafs,3d90kk,NathookGD,8,Tue Jul 14 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of s stretch don't you think? I'd say Rielly is better than Gardiner. But I don't think either of them could pull off the minutes/skill that Phaneuf could, and I'm not even a fan of Phaneuf. But I still give credit where it's needed."
leafs,3d90kk,booomdynamite,5,Tue Jul 14 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"IMO, Rielly will be better, but Gardiner is still better now especially defensively. And yeah I think they could pull it off, Phaneuf hasn't done well with those minutes so I don't understand the notion that he is the only leaf that can handle his minutes. (Rielly and Gardiner actually played more 5v5/game than Phaneuf last season) Phaneuf has been used completely wrong in his time here, his assets are offensive and he's been given the hardest minutes and he can't handle them at all. Gardiner would fare much better, maybe Rielly as well."
leafs,3d90kk,NathookGD,-7,Tue Jul 14 17:28:27 2015 UTC,His assets are offensive but he can't hit the broadside of a barn with his clapper. That's how you know he's bad.
leafs,3d90kk,nomorelulu,3,Tue Jul 14 17:52:02 2015 UTC,I know sometimes he has a spectacular miss but IIRC his shots on target % is about average.
leafs,3d90kk,NathookGD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"That's a tough call. I mean, they all have different positives. Don't know much about Marincin.  I still think Phaneuf is better, maybe he plays too many minutes, but he's still a much more complete player. He may not have a great CF%, but his GF% is better by a mile over both Rielly and Gardener in 5v5 Even Strength."
leafs,3d90kk,theboyblue,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"You're right about the GF%, but IIRC GF% is less repeatable & predictable of future GF% than CF%. For example, Phaneuf went from -6.9 GF% Rel to +6.4% from 12/13 to 13/14. Marincin hasn't played many games yet but according to dCorsi he has outperformed his (very difficult) minutes and made a defensive and offensive impact on possession. If you use that same metric, Gardiner really shines especially defensively, Rielly made a significant impact offensively and a marginal impact defensively, Phaneuf made a moderate impact offensively but a negative impact defensively.  dCorsi is not perfect ofc, but it does provide some insight into how a player handles the minutes he's given and whether he exceeds or fails to meet expectations from a possession standpoint."
leafs,3d90kk,NathookGD,0,Wed Jul 15 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah,   I was just saying that because his GF% is consistently the best on the team. That could obviously be because he is also consistently paired with the top line. I hope Babcock figures him out and puts some structure into our defense so that we don't have to talk about how bad Phaneuf is, instead, how great Rielly and Gardiner are. I just want Phaneuf to be a leader on the ice in terms of making sure our guys don't lose confidence in themselves."
leafs,3d90kk,theboyblue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"He's been the leader for only the past two seasons. I'm not saying Phaneuf is horrible, he's not. He's a decent 2nd pairing guy on most NHL teams. Issue is that he's played how he shouldn't be played and makes $7 mil for the next 6 years."
leafs,3d90kk,NathookGD,11,Wed Jul 15 17:45:05 2015 UTC,Whatever...keep him...but unload Bozak and Lupul as a peace offering to the fans.
leafs,3d90kk,thismadhatter,2,Tue Jul 14 13:48:43 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to see how he can perform under the new coaching staff. My only beef is that he wears the C. I know it's pretty much impossible to strip a C without losing the player but I just feel that for a culture change and rebuild to truly begin, the C needs to be vacant until someone who is truly deserving earns the role."
leafs,3d90kk,TheRealWedgeAntilles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"San Jose did it (twice?). Marleau was captain and they took it and gave it to Thornton, and I'm pretty sure they took it from Thornton. Granted, that's a smaller market, so it probably wouldn't be as big a deal."
leafs,3d90kk,Swa9Dra9on,-6,Wed Jul 15 21:05:45 2015 UTC,With Phaneuf wearing the C it basically is vacant. Hi-Oh!
leafs,3d90kk,RobotOrgy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"TLDR - the contract is too much for any team looking for a decent 2nd or 3rd line Dman, Nonis fucked us."
leafs,3d90kk,goodguydudeman,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:18 2015 UTC,Phaneuf is clearly not a 3rd line Dman. There is no team in the league he wouldn't be top 4 on.
leafs,3d90kk,optimal_optimist,0,Tue Jul 14 23:47:05 2015 UTC,"On teams with a strong backend (Blues, Flames, etc) he's a #4. On others a #3."
leafs,3d90kk,LinLeaf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:15 2015 UTC,His contract needs to be reduced to 4.5-5m to move him. Either by taking on a contract to make up the difference or by retaining salary.
leafs,3d90kk,LinLeaf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:57 2015 UTC,There is no excuse for not seeing that coming either. At no time during his TML tenure has Phaneuf been worth anywhere close to 7 million per year.
leafs,3d90kk,178239104511126,4,Tue Jul 14 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with this article. For decades this organization has treated its captains like garbage. The ballard years (intentional lower case B) are enough to make any Leafs fan's blood boil when the names Sittler and Keon come to mind. Sundin was asked to reduce himself to a rental player rather than finish his career where he belonged... I think it's great that when Phaneuf ends his tenure with the Leafs, we'll have at least TRIED to reinvigorate his career and let him leave with some dignity. A huge step in the right direction for this franchise if you ask me! EDIT: Not saying that Phaneuf is close to the calibre of Sittler, Keon, or Sundin... just saying it's nice to see the Leafs organization treating its captains like PEOPLE and not like assets or toys."
leafs,3d90kk,joem13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:47:44 2015 UTC,Everyone loved Clark and Gilmour though.
leafs,3d90kk,RobotOrgy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree, but they were still traded while wearing the C. The way I see it, your captain is your team's finest specimen. The Leafs have routinely shown its finest the door or shipped them off for spare parts... or in the case of Dave Keon, shipped off for shits and giggles just so he couldn't retire as a Leaf. I think we're due for a change in the way we send off our captains. Maybe even have one actually retire with that title sometime lol"
leafs,3d90kk,joem13,3,Tue Jul 14 21:37:03 2015 UTC,His contract keeps him safe. Nothing else.
leafs,3d90kk,LinLeaf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Do you guys think Babcock is going to use Phaneuf a lot differently than other coaches have? (ie. less ice time, worse competition, better zone starts, etc.) It'll certainly be interesting to see if Babcock can turn Phaneuf's game around."
leafs,3d90kk,nomorelulu,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:04 2015 UTC,Like previous coaches he may not have a choice but to put him on the top pairing. Hopefully he's taken off the top PP unit with Rielly and Gardiner leading the charge.
leafs,3d90kk,LinLeaf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:25:59 2015 UTC,"I'd keep Gardiner and Rielly separate. They're both good at zone entrances, and Phaneuf is not. Having one on either unit seems the most beneficial to me.   Didn't Carlyle keep those two together? I thought I remembered being annoyed by that."
leafs,3d90kk,Swa9Dra9on,2,Wed Jul 15 21:03:38 2015 UTC,Having both run the entire two minutes is the optimal option. McCabe and Kaberle would often run the entire PP.
leafs,3d90kk,LinLeaf,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:02:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will face 'worse competition'. He's still our best dman, regardless of what everyone thinks. Everything else, yeah. Most likely he will be played based on how he is performing, instead of being forced to play big minutes when he is underperforming."
leafs,3d90kk,theboyblue,0,Wed Jul 15 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Great. Play him as the 2nd pairing d-man his skill set allows him to be. Will that change the fact he is paid like a #1?   We may not need it now, but cap space could be getting tight by the last few years of his deal, and I doubt he'll be movable at all by then."
leafs,3d90kk,178239104511126,2,Tue Jul 14 14:45:59 2015 UTC,I'm hoping he will have a good season under Babcock so the Leafs can find someone willing to take on his contract. Obviously they wouldn't get much (if any) return but the Cap space is valuable enough to justify basically giving him away.
leafs,3d621u,MrSpaceBaby,18,Mon Jul 13 20:23:42 2015 UTC,Did I miss something?  Why would Nashville not sign him to less than 1 million? I'm guessing agent asked for more while in Nashville but then took a discount to be in TO?
leafs,3d621u,err1234,18,Mon Jul 13 20:56:02 2015 UTC,Nashville wanted his roster spot for one of their younger forwards like Fiala. Devane was just an AHL warm body to take whatever prospect gets promoted's place.
leafs,3d621u,McArthurParka,3,Mon Jul 13 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. The hockey news says this about Devane:  ""Assets:    Is a big, tough hombre. Can be a real force in the hitting department...""   Perhaps they also liked his forecheck and thought it could help their AHL club. Toronto likely wasn't going to trade away picks or skill."
leafs,3d621u,err1234,3,Mon Jul 13 21:36:33 2015 UTC,"If Fiala passes Beck on the depth chart, why not just play him instead of Beck? No need to trade one, just send one down, before the season there's no waiver wire."
leafs,3d621u,Xer0day,4,Mon Jul 13 23:37:15 2015 UTC,He was a RFA who could see the writing on the wall in Nashville (being passed by Fiala etc). I'd bet his demands were higher to stay there than they were to play here.
leafs,3d621u,McArthurParka,5,Mon Jul 13 23:50:17 2015 UTC,I'm left wondering the same thing... unless they've got a glut of talented players that play Beck's position and wanted to give him a shot somewhere else.  But then why pick up Devane?
leafs,3d621u,palmerry,5,Mon Jul 13 21:11:37 2015 UTC,Devane? Are you kidding me? He's got truculence coming out the wazoo!
leafs,3d621u,Seacord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:21:00 2015 UTC,But then why pick up Devane?   Younger Clune? (ironically also with toronto)
leafs,3d621u,err1234,3,Tue Jul 14 00:50:48 2015 UTC,Poile probably wanted the two way contract for the AHL rate when Beck was sent down. Beck wasn't interested.  Preds care about real dollars. Leafs only care about cap space.

leafs,3d621u,ergography,7,Tue Jul 14 13:37:19 2015 UTC,Aren't the Leafs at the max amount of contracts? Will they be able to sign Bernier without making any moves?
leafs,3d621u,RicoPapaya,12,Mon Jul 13 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"We are actually at 49. 50 when Bernier signs.   Kapanen and Nylander should slide at the start of the year bring us back down to 48.   Edit: Donaghey should also slide, bringing it to 47.  Source"
leafs,3d621u,lmHuge,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:42 2015 UTC,I thought we were at 49 without Bernier?
leafs,3d621u,InternationalCow,2,Mon Jul 13 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely 49, I recounted. Also generalfanager has the full list. We got 3 ELCs that should slide next year too.  Err, Beck wasn't added. 49."
leafs,3d621u,lmHuge,2,Mon Jul 13 20:48:02 2015 UTC,Don't contracts count regardless of sliding?
leafs,3d621u,MacerV,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:10 2015 UTC,"If they slide they won't count against the limit but I could be wrong. I'm not confident right now in anything I say, had a really long and rough day at work and posting off my phone haha.   You very well could be right. Ignoring the slides, there's still a single contract spot for Bernier."
leafs,3d621u,lmHuge,3,Mon Jul 13 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"Looked it up in the CBA and found it under the definition of the Reserve list.    (a) Not more than 50 Players signed to an SPC.... Age 18 and age 19 Players who were returned to Juniors, and who have not played 11 NHL Games in one season, shall be exempt from inclusion in the 50 Player limit.    So I think 4 players don't count as contracts, Nylander, Kapanen, Verhaeghe, and Donaghey"
leafs,3d621u,MacerV,5,Mon Jul 13 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"Verhaeghe will be 20 at the start of the season, so he will count against the contract limit."

leafs,3d621u,idislikesandwiches,2,Mon Jul 13 21:16:30 2015 UTC,I think it still counts if the player was drafted from Europe like Nylander.
leafs,3d621u,MacerV,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"Only if they're playing in Europe, unlike Nylander."
leafs,3d621u,idislikesandwiches,2,Mon Jul 13 22:44:48 2015 UTC,If know which section of the CBA states the specifics by all means share.
leafs,3d621u,MacerV,2,Mon Jul 13 22:47:13 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter where said European player plays. Since they aren't bound to the CHL-AHL agreement they can play in the AHL before 20 and still slide. Players in the CHL don't have the luxury to play in the AHL full time before 20 so there's no possible way for them to have their contracts slid while in the AHL.   This is what I've understood.
leafs,3d621u,lmHuge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, so Kapanen and Nylander's contracts continue to slide even if they play in the AHL this year?"
leafs,3d621u,Hedgery,2,Tue Jul 14 03:40:50 2015 UTC,Yes they'll only be 19 to start the season.
leafs,3d621u,lmHuge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"Nice. I knew that's how it worked if they went back to junior or played in Europe, but thought if they played AHL for the full year they still counted."
leafs,3d621u,Hedgery,2,Mon Jul 13 23:53:33 2015 UTC,"thats 50 including bernier, right? General fanager has the number currently at 48, and once they add Beck they should have 49, maybe?"

Could Crosby and Malkin turn Phil into a decently rounded player?  I mean all Phil needs to do is have two and a half rushes in him right? One to break out, the other one to get back, and the other to get to the bench."

But then he's blown his load and can't get back in time to back check.   I'm just saying he's an improvement-to-his-anaerobic-capacity-away from being a truly scary player.   If Pittsburgh can get him to backcheck efficiently even half the time, kessel would improve as an overall player immensely."
leafs,3d50og,Village_ponce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think having other players of the same skill level will dramatically lighten Kessels load. I don't think any player could play at Kessels speed, every shift every game offensively and still back check hard. Especially when your line is so weak, you have to carry the puck every time."
leafs,3d50og,theboyblue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"Oh totally.   But he also didn't need to stay on the ice that long. I think a big part of kessel hatred was because of his duration.   Even if he's a one rush guy, rush up, rush to the bench and change (best case scenario of course, easier said than done and all that)   Kessel would stay on far too long for his energy to sustain. He's one of the fastest players in the league, but that just means you run out of juice faster. He's actually 28th in the league for avg shift length at 51.5"

leafs,3d50og,EmeraldWill,0,Mon Jul 13 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this makes zero sense at the moment. Kessel has done nothing to stick it to Toronto except get traded, which is hardly ""sticking it"" to anyone. If anything, its what a lot of people wanted and felt was needed for this team to begin its rebuild.  Even then, since when is Sports media not allowed to criticize a professional athlete when they under-perform (as Kessel did last season). Is this pic implying Kessel is butthurt because these media outlets rightfully called him out for his horrendous year?  I dont doubt that Crosy, Malkin and Fleury will take the brunt of the criticism if the Pens perform poorly, but if anyone thinks Kessel is in the clear simply because he's out of Toronto and he has those guys in front of him, they are very sorely mistaken. There are still going to be high expectations set for next season."
leafs,3d50og,arsenefinger,2,Mon Jul 13 17:29:47 2015 UTC,you should look for your sense of humour over the summer.
leafs,3d50og,EmeraldWill,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"It's an obvious spin-off from the commercial which I previously linked. And it's a joke, meaning if he performs well with Pittsburgh and produces more than he did in Toronto (which is highly probable given his probable linemates), then it makes perfect sense.  I don't think you can call it a ""horrendous year"". 25 goals is still pretty respectable for an off-year. And you can criticize an athlete all you want but some of what he got was personal. I mean calling him fat? Come on...  Kessel is classy and would neverrrrr do anything like this...But if he produces like he probably will, he could do exactly this to all the people who called him ""fat"", ""out-of-shape"", etc. And that was the majority of the media. Hence, the joke..."
leafs,3d50og,EmeraldWill,-1,Mon Jul 13 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"25 goals is still pretty respectable for an off-year   By comparison, JVR has an AAV of 4.25m and scored 27 last season, and Bozak has an AAV of 4.2m and scored 23. Kessel's AAV is 8m, and you're telling me 25 is ""respectable""? Not even close, I'm sorry.   This sub has been littered with biased, blind Kessel fanatics who couldn't care less about the Team, but will do anything they can to defend the player, so I'm sure this is going to get buried. They can deny it all they want, but the fact is, Kessel played very poorly last season, even more so in the second half of the season. You pair that with his obvious declining physical fitness level and ridiculous salary and I think the Toronto media had every right to call him out for his lousy performance and lack of dedication to both the season and the team.   No one in the Toronto media has ever denied that Kessel is an extremely skilled forward but at $8million per year, you expect more from a player, a lot more than what Kessel gave us last season."
leafs,3d50og,theboyblue,2,Mon Jul 13 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"obvious declining physical fitness level   Proof?   ridiculous salary   4th most goals in the past 4 seasons (including his ""off-year)"", pretty sure he got what he was worth.   We saw what he was capable on Team USA when he had a real 1st line centre (I think it was Pavelski but not too sure, regardless they're better than Bozak). If he's with Crosby/Malkin this year, I feel bad for that goalie.  Don't be surprised when he gets 40 goals."
leafs,3d50og,newbo750,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"We saw what he was capable on Team USA   To be fair, 4 of his 6 goals were against lower tier teams, in blowout games. Slovenia(5-1)/Slovakia(7-1). Secondly, yes I will admit Pavelski is a much better player compared to Bozak, but he was still paired with JVR (who is often completely undervalued/underestimated by Kessel fans)   4th most goals in the past 4 seasons (including his ""off-year)""   Worth noting that he has only played TWO seasons under his new contract, making the first two of the four season  mentioned  irrelevant. So when we break down the two seasons he's played since getting paid, he's had one great season, and one awful season. That kind of inconsistency is not worth $8 million a year, sorry.    Don't be surprised when he gets 40 goals.   I wont be surprised if he does. I've never doubted  Kessel's  offensive talent, and giving him both a change of scenery and  elite linemates like Crosby or Malkin should definitely improve his production and I'm happy for him.   But none of that  takes away from the fact that he needed to go. He was not in Toronto's rebuild plans, and while we may miss him, his talent and services would have been wasted during this rebuild."

Anyway, you might as well just read this http://www.pensburgh.com/2015/7/13/8925329/phil-kessel-advanced-stats-pittsburgh-penguins   Basically, while Kessel is not good defensively it is most likely a product of who he was lined up with (Bozak/JVR) than him being ""lazy"". Of course, we can only know once we see him in Pitts.  Him needing to go however is most likely and in my opinion true. I don't think we could have gotten much for any other player because most players on the team aren't good enough - other than Phil of course."

leafs,3d4ub5,brokenshoelaces,8,Mon Jul 13 21:39:53 2015 UTC,Bozak would be both an upgrade on Laichs and a cheaper cap hit.  Bozak for Laichs + picks is very plausible.
leafs,3d4ub5,optimal_optimist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"An upgrade?  That's very debatable.  Laich has put up better offensive years  than Bozak with two 50+ point seasons and three 20+ goal seasons.  And that's with less ice time and playing minimally with Ovechkin, unlike Bozak who was stapled to Kessel with top line minutes.  Laich is also better defensively than Bozak (just about anyone would be).  Laich's production has declined since turning 30, but a lot of that is due to diminished ice time the past couple of years.  I frankly don't see why Washington would do this trade straight up let along throw in multiple draft picks."
leafs,3d4ub5,tkang1234567,2,Mon Jul 13 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"It's not at all debatable that Laichs is better than Bozak. Laichs has declined hard. His production isn't dropping because of his lack of play time, his play time is dropping because of his lack of production. Look up some of Laich's advanced stats, they're similar or worse than Bozaks and declining much faster. Or just look at regular stats. Yes, Bozak was stapled to Kessel, but it's not like he would have dropped from 0.7PPG over the last two years to 0.3PPG (Laich's production) if he had weaker linemates/less PP time. Bozak's also way better on faceoffs, which matters if he gets put on the 2nd PP or PK units."
leafs,3d4ub5,isotope123,0,Tue Jul 14 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think Bozak would receive 2nd, but since it didn't happen when Leafs said they are shopping Bozak for 2nd during draft, should we accept:  Bozak <-> Laichs + 2nd + 3rd + (more)? (something like that?)  I don't know much about Laichs, but he seems like a veteran 4th center. 15-20pts for past 2 seasons at age of 32.    EDIT: I feel like this is a shitty return for us the more i look at it..."
leafs,3d4ub5,tkang1234567,0,Mon Jul 13 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"That is not a fair trade for Washington in the slightest, that's not even close... Bozak for a 2nd is acceptable. Taking back just Laich might be all we could potentially swing for him. This way Washington gets their 3C-overpaid but serviceable-in Bozak, and we get another player on a short term deal we can probably flip at the trade deadline/draft."

leafs,3d4ub5,sadleafsfan16,2,Tue Jul 14 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. If Capitals actually offered that, I wouldn't do it. Bozak's contract is only one more year than Laich's contract. With 200K difference and Bozak being a good 3rd C at the very least while Laich being 4th C and older, Bozak has much higher value imo.   If Bozak is moved, it has to involve a draft pick and Laich would just be a cap dump for Capitals but not the valuable part of the return. We probably won't be a cap heavy team in 2017-2018 either (even if we were, 200K is very small), so the extra year doesn't mean that much to us. (we just want to move Bozak to accelerate rebuild, he isn't a cap dump)"

leafs,3d6efp,riversfan17,6,Mon Jul 13 22:36:46 2015 UTC,The picks we'll get from trading our UFAs help long term. The only reason you should be keeping guys on one year deals is if you're going to compete.
leafs,3d6efp,lmHuge,5,Tue Jul 14 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Or if you sincerely believe they're a big part of your future and plan to sign them to a longterm extension. This is, of course, in a general sense. The Leafs' 1-year-to-UFA deals will probably all be shipped out or simply not return. Only one I could see making an impact enough to stay would be Parenteau, but even that is unlikely."
leafs,3d6efp,paperfire,7,Tue Jul 14 11:32:40 2015 UTC,"No, not really. Our future will be in the AHL/OHL/Europe for the most part next season, besides the handful on the Leafs already."
leafs,3d6efp,Marc_the_Ardvark,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:18 2015 UTC,"What if those handful of Leafs, under the guidance of Babcock, are able to preform really well and excel?"
leafs,3d6efp,paperfire,13,Mon Jul 13 22:37:19 2015 UTC,Las Vegas has us tied with Arizona as the worst team in the NHL. Rest assured we will be bad.    http://www.vegasinsider.com/nhl/odds/futures/
leafs,3d6efp,PopsicleJesus,4,Mon Jul 13 22:54:14 2015 UTC,Las Vegas also had the Jays winning the world series after they acquired RA Dickey.
leafs,3d6efp,lmHuge,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:02 2015 UTC,Obviously it's not perfect but the best place to find good predictions is where people are putting money on the line.
leafs,3d6efp,Whiterhino77,0,Tue Jul 14 15:52:22 2015 UTC,Stupid people are going to be stupid whether they have money on the line or not. Same with smart people being smart. Money changes nothing.
leafs,3d6efp,err1234,2,Tue Jul 14 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"They won't go far. It's not beneficial.   Edit: ""They"" as in the team as a whole, there's not enough talent to go deep in the playoffs. The only beneficial thing from this season would be the culture change towards good work ethic."
leafs,3d6efp,TheGursh,6,Mon Jul 13 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"I'd be wary of the rough-and-tumble style you see in the first 2 rounds. Our guys would be so young and that could be incredibly deflating in terms of confidence if they were to be shelled.  Then again I really don't think there's an exact science to development.  Calgary had a fantastic defensive corps, but in large part they echoed the sentiment that Colorado set 2 years ago in that these younger teams can make some serious waves.  So I'll approach absolutely any scenario with an open-mind, including one where we see how a few of our prospects would do in playoff hockey."
leafs,3d6efp,LinLeaf,5,Tue Jul 14 00:56:55 2015 UTC,"They way I see it, if your team can't take a good ass whooping (think 9-2 loss) then dismember that team. You gotta know how to get your ass kicked, whether it be in a long series or a single game, & know how to bounce back from that."
leafs,3d6efp,tarion_914,3,Tue Jul 14 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think of it this way.  The team we are building and trying to strengthen right now is the Marlies.  Best way to do that is miss the playoffs.  Sure, we could test the playoff performance of our current young team, but likely only a handful of them will be around in 5 years."
leafs,3d6efp,paperfire,0,Tue Jul 14 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"And fill the holes with young players. If everything goes right we could see Kapanen, Brown and Nylander for a playoff drive. If they make it that'd be amazing, if not they got the experience and you get a better pick."
leafs,3d6efp,theboyblue,10,Tue Jul 14 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"The plan shouldn't change.  Not to worry, the last two months of season always separates the winners from the losers."
leafs,3d6efp,paperfire,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"As we should know well, being Leafs fans."
leafs,3d6efp,OMO3,9,Tue Jul 14 07:13:19 2015 UTC,"I have a very hard time seeing that happen. We have the worst roster in the Atlantic on paper, probably the entire East actually. We may have Babcock but we have almost no high end talent."
leafs,3d6efp,OneKessticle,3,Mon Jul 13 22:50:26 2015 UTC,I still think Carolina is worse. We may be tied with New Jersey for the 2nd worst in the east.
leafs,3d6efp,death_from-above,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:44:36 2015 UTC,Carolina will have more talent than us. But it's possible we play better if Babcock inspires them to play with heart.
leafs,3d6efp,riversfan17,8,Tue Jul 14 13:50:34 2015 UTC,Is this not posted every week or is it a joke now?
leafs,3d6efp,sillywalkr,2,Tue Jul 14 01:09:24 2015 UTC,Honestly. I mean I know its the off season but asking the same question weekly is a little annoying. Especially cause all the comments pretty much end up being the same. Can we move on from this idea?
leafs,3d6efp,Couchwarmer123,4,Tue Jul 14 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think they will stay the course as Babs said ""pain is coming"" so we need to develop just like everyone else did not throw the future for a WTF season. like /u/ImHuge said trade the ufa's nothing changes"
leafs,3d6efp,Couchwarmer123,4,Mon Jul 13 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"Do exactly what Calgary did when this happened to them this season. Roll with it as long as you can, gain from it, but stick to the plan."
leafs,3d6efp,mck51,7,Tue Jul 14 11:35:20 2015 UTC,"the east is such a crapshoot they might be. they certainly won't be as bad and the goaltending cannot help but be better. but as others have said, no change in the Shanaplan"
leafs,3d6efp,trudenter,10,Mon Jul 13 22:03:51 2015 UTC,The NHL will cease to exist.
leafs,3d6efp,ruebius,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:24:21 2015 UTC,Haha. Is this a hell freezes over kind of thing?
leafs,3d6efp,ross0927,0,Mon Jul 13 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"Just a joke but yeah. It'd be really bizzare if we make it and I don't see how we will unless we PDO really hard again. If we squeak in, I don't want to deviate from the rebuilding plan though"
leafs,3d6efp,Remedios96,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"If we're a fringe playoff team, all the better. Most likely means our one year deal guys are performing well and will yield a good return.  But I also wouldn't be surprised if some of the one year deal guys gets extended if they seem to fit in."
leafs,3d6efp,dswartze,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking. If someway,  somehow the leafs were a playoff team next year, then we probably wouldn't get the high draft pick (our own, still top ten mayby) but we would be able to trade away these players we just signed for a huge return. But realistically, im just hoping a couple of them shine and we can steal another first rounder."
leafs,3d6efp,aGURM12,3,Tue Jul 14 02:07:58 2015 UTC,We'll probably be in the playoff race until the new year. Then fall back to earth in traditional Leafs fashion.
leafs,3d6efp,NO_NAME_BRAN,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"Keep to the plan and trade pending UFAs, if the team then still makes the playoffs, then I would consider the season a big success. I am not looking to tank for #1, I would rather focus on building culture and structure."
leafs,3d6efp,Hock3y,2,Mon Jul 13 23:45:37 2015 UTC,"If we make the playoffs it is due to Bernier, Kadri, JVR, Phaneuf, and Rielly having a career year. I'm ok with that. Trade the spare parts for future assets."
leafs,3d6efp,Snafu93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:27:16 2015 UTC,"They players and coaching staff play hard and try to win games because that's what they do, and the front office looks for good moves to make.  In the end when they fail they can feel good about themselves for doing so well, and look forward to the coming years when they will be even better."
leafs,3d6efp,Ballinagh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:02:23 2015 UTC,"If that happens, is that out core for the next few years?"
leafs,3d6efp,EnergyDrinkerr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:58:37 2015 UTC,I think if the Leafs end up getting a high pick by finishing close to the playoffs or making the first round that just means management has their work cut out for them. I can see them trading up for a higher pick. Maybe packaging our first rounder and Pittsburgh's first rounder to move up. I have faith in management that we will still have a solid draft if we don't finish in the bottom 5.
leafs,3d6efp,AnnalisaPetrucci,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"We'll still collapse at the end. If they play well, then we trade them at the deadline and fall no problem. Even if we were in a playoff spot at the time, I wouldn't mind tanking, we're not gonna win the cup, this isn't the core we want to have playoff experience...etc etc."
leafs,3d6efp,Mapleleaf97,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:21 2015 UTC,I think we sit pat much like the Flames did this year. Getting playoff experience for the young guys is amazing and I feel is more important then netting a couple picks. If were offered something you can't pass up you obviously still take it but unless that happens you hold pat and see where it takes you
leafs,3d6efp,178239104511126,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"It would surprise me considering the teams at the top that would need to drop.  I don't see them beating MTL, TB, NYR, PIT, WAS, NYI and the bubble teams BOS, OTT, FLA, DET, CBJ.  I see them as a 5-10 pick range but hey crazier things have probably happened"
leafs,3d6efp,Juicyb17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:31:59 2015 UTC,Than the endless cycle of mediocrity will continue.
leafs,3d6efp,AnnalisaPetrucci,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:59 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe they could make the playoffs after removing their best player
leafs,3d6efp,theboyblue,-10,Tue Jul 14 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"Then you purge Phaneuf ASAP.  You can't have his cap hit for his lack of capabilities on the blueline. Excellent tank commander, extremely poor player for trying for success."
leafs,3d6efp,AnnalisaPetrucci,7,Mon Jul 13 22:48:00 2015 UTC,You so edgy
leafs,3d6efp,theboyblue,-1,Tue Jul 14 01:14:49 2015 UTC,"/r/leafs love them some Dion.   When they see a real top 2 d-man they'll come around to our thinking. Don't worry. Just take solace in the fact that you're right, since you certainly won't get upvotes for it."
leafs,3d6efp,AnnalisaPetrucci,5,Tue Jul 14 02:02:02 2015 UTC,/r/leafs love them some Dion   We do? I hardly ever see something positive about Dion on this sub.
leafs,3d6efp,theboyblue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:59 2015 UTC,"and when I do, half the time it's downvoted. as he is now, he is our best dman. Gardiner and Rielly will most likely surpass him this season though, but he is a pretty good 3 or 4 dman. he just gets overused"
leafs,3d6efp,covairs,0,Tue Jul 14 08:23:02 2015 UTC,He is not a #3 or #4 defenceman. People are just constantly making excuses for why he's an extremely poor defenceman.
leafs,3d6efp,178239104511126,0,Tue Jul 14 11:15:11 2015 UTC,"As bad as he is, he still has the best gf% of all dmen on the team. I would say that means he's doing his job better than anyone else."
leafs,3d6efp,84awkm,2,Tue Jul 14 12:46:10 2015 UTC,He also is one of the worst defenceman in the NHL defensively. Kind of a deal breaker when you're a defenceman.
leafs,3d6efp,sadleafsfan16,0,Tue Jul 14 13:21:03 2015 UTC,If people aren't scoring on you then I think the payoff is okay.
leafs,3d6efp,canadianguy,2,Tue Jul 14 13:23:47 2015 UTC,"Which they do, a lot."
