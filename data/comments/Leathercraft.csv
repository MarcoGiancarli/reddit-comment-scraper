Leathercraft,3e5by0,othersomethings,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"It's lovely, I think. Would you mind posting a guide or some plans/patterns for it?"
Leathercraft,3e5by0,Calmor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I kind of just winged it after googling ""hip belt waist pouch bag purse"" variations for a week.   I DID kind of look at a few bags I saw on etsy for design ideas. This one - I wanted the zipper/pocket design that this has, and the body of the bag is sort of the same.   I also liked this one and used the ideas for the belt/buckle/rings.   I have an industrial sewing machine so I felt like machine sewing on garment leather was the right way to start, and I will probably do the next one on the machine as well but I'll used waxed thread and I'm going to change the design of the body to be a little bit larger (the front pocket JUST holds my smart phone or wallet) and definitely swap the zipper out for either a nylon zipper or no zipper on the upper pocket because it's practically unusable as is. I mean, if I got pick-pocketed at least I'd know who the culprit was because their hand would be bleeding!  The front pocket turned out to be a nightmare to sew. I'm going to have to rethink that completely. Partly because the leather stretched a lot, and it was also thick even though I skivved the edges (not enough?) and also I've never sewn leather and wow it's different. Maybe I'll do a gusset style, or an enveloped style. Also going to make the top flap cover most of the pocket - as is, if I stick anything bulky in the pocket the flap sticks out at half mast. Not cool.   I made a to scale pattern for the bag in photoshop, if you have photoshop I could upload the PSD with the file that has all the layers for each section. It doesn't include the belt, just the bag part.  If you have any specific questions about construction I can expand on that, but I seriously have NO idea what I'm doing and don't recommend following anything at all that I say."
Leathercraft,3e5by0,PRDU,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"If you aren't gluing any mating surfaces that are to be sewn, than you might want to consider doing so. It'll help keep everything lined up and somewhat help the stretching problem.  Your stitch lines look like they aren't consistently spaced from the edge. Perhaps this was done intentionally, but I personally like to keep all my stitching an even distance from all my edges.  All that being said, it looks really nice for a first project! If you want to expand your leatherworking into thicker and more robust leathers, I'd recommend you explore hand sewing techniques, but all in all I think you have a great start :)"
Leathercraft,3e5by0,PRDU,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment, you helped me the other day in the general questions thread.   My sewing machine is old and needs to be serviced, it has issues with the clutch so sometimes speed and spacing gets ugly. Most of the time it's not a big deal but I realize now leather is a super big deal - I either need to service and fine tune the machine or switch to hand stitching.   I glued the folded edges, and the belt portion. The leather cement I used is from hobby lobby and I feel like it wasn't the best option, I'll be looking into other glues. Also I searched high and low for edge paint or glaze - looks like I'll be making a trip to Tandy no matter what when I start the new one."
Leathercraft,3e5by0,knoticalknovelties,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"If you bought Barge's cement from the store, it's considered by many to be a very high quality glue. I, on the other hand, like to use DAP WeldWood GEL formula from the big box hardware stores. I figure that the glue is only a temporary hold until I can stitch the leather, so it doesn't really matter if it's super strong or not. That being said, I find that it holds plenty strong, it just stinks to high heaven. Use in a well ventilated area if you want to go that route.  And a tip for shopping at Tandy; if you aren't in any hurry to get things from them, wait every month for their rotating sales. Almost everything in the store goes on sale eventually, so if you can wait for it so you don't pay full retail, do so! This month had a few things I wanted, so I grabbed them not too long ago.  Keep up the cool work, I know my first project wasn't nearly as big or complicated as yours, so you're definitely off to a good start :)"
Leathercraft,3e5by0,itssilvernotgray,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:51:40 2015 UTC,I like the versatility of cross body or hip wear. I was wondering why the ring instead of just a straight forward attachment.   It's like one of those travel bags for keeping important things close and/or hidden.
Leathercraft,3e4ro3,DasJuden63,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:15:32 2015 UTC,I like how you tried different stitching.  The triangular weave looks pretty good.  Well made.

Leathercraft,3e5ms2,god12,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:30:40 2015 UTC,My first project! I used some incredibly cheapo veg tan. Never again will I use such terrible quality but I wanted to do some practice projects before I splurged on pricier stuff. My stitching was kinda shit; I have some harness needles on the way that oughta help with that. Being the right size and all. I think with some better leather ill dye it and burnish the edge and a bunch of other stuff next time. I can't wait!
Leathercraft,3e3xoq,Enlighted_Eggplant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"Morning! I'm also in Australia, and shopping can be expensive/fun!  My favourite sources are Goods Japan for leather tools. Free shipping, and a nice group of people. Prices aren't too bad. Birdsall's Leather and Tandy's are two in Sydney that are great for beginners to pick up some basic tools and veg tan. Leffler's is good to walk into, if you're more Eastern, but I've been less than impressed with their service from the desk - the guys out the back who handle the leathers for you are great, though.   AA Crack is good to deal with in the UK. Here are some samples I received from them a little while ago.  Abbey England is great if you are trying to source hardware (something I find difficult) or Tiger thread.  This doesn't really help you with being in London, but just some basic Aussie-info.  Hope this helps, and just drop me a message if you need a hand."
Leathercraft,3e31sh,Hollydaize,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:47 2015 UTC,"I love Maine thread!   If you want the thread to lay flat, just get a hammer and scrap leather to smush it down.   This is an example from my projects what the .2 and .3 look.   Idk if you can really tell, but the .2 is fairly thin. I use it for double layered watch straps. I wouldn't use it wallets, etc. for The .3 I use regularly for my small projects. (I didn't smush the thread down on the wallet pictured on the bottom).  This is a sample card you can get if you ask them. It gives you colors and sizes for the waxed polycord."
Leathercraft,3e31sh,knoticalknovelties,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"Very helpful, thanks!"
Leathercraft,3e31sh,knoticalknovelties,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:28 2015 UTC,"I also have .35, but I switched it out because I thought it was too thick. That's just my preference. I think .3in and .35in are the equivalents of .8mm and 1mm (well close enough if you converted them)."
Leathercraft,3e31sh,ItsToka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:53 2015 UTC,How much thread do you burn through?  I've ordered some .6mm Tiger from ebay and it seems to last me a while.  But I'm not exactly cranking out products.
Leathercraft,3e31sh,ItsToka,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"not much at all, I was just hoping for a lower cost than importing tiger thread or the US distributors."
Leathercraft,3e31sh,thoughtcrimes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:39 2015 UTC,I think the ebay or etsy small batches are pretty cheap.  Under $10  Like so Seller 1 Seller 2
Leathercraft,3e31sh,ItsToka,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"25 meters/yards doesn't seem like a lot for the cost ($6.95). When you get 930 meters/yards of eagle thread for $30.  I think as soon as eagle thread comes out with a size in the 0.6 to 0.8 mm range, I'll buy a couple rolls of it."
Leathercraft,3e31sh,ItsToka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:36 2015 UTC,It's definitely not worth is when you extrapolate it.  But if you want to sew with .6mm tiger thread next week $7 is worth it IMO.  But I thought way back when they were advertising the Eagle thread as .8mm now I can't find any numbers on their site saying what size it is.
Leathercraft,3e31sh,BeastmanCaravan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"You're right, that looks like the best deal for the speed.   As for the size of the TE thread, I remember people throwing around .8 a lot too. I have a suspicion that someone eyeballed it over at leatherworker.net and people took it as fact."
Leathercraft,3e31sh,Calvus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:51:53 2015 UTC,"Look at the picture of all the spools,  the logo when you zoom in says .8mm"
Leathercraft,3e10nr,WeevilKnievel,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Both look pretty good!  The top of your dopp kit looks like it's puckering a bit, and that might be from you putting too much tension on your thread. If it didn't pucker before you stitched it, than you are pulling on your thread too much.  That being said, I need to make a dopp kit for myself soon. I'm slacking on all my personal projects!"
Leathercraft,3e10nr,PRDU,2,Tue Jul 21 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"Oh was wondering about that, I was pulling tgat thread as tight as I could lol. Do I normally not pull tight on soft leather? Or does thst go with all leather? I really only still work with veg tan and saddle stitch."
Leathercraft,3e10nr,PRDU,3,Tue Jul 21 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"You want to be firm without going gorilla crazy. If your fingers hurt from pulling your thread, you're using way too much force.   Firmer leathers are more forgiving when compared to soft leathers, but you never want to pull as hard as you can. Firm, even, and consistent force on every stitch.   It will take practice, but you will get the feel for it as you continue to stitch things."
Leathercraft,3e10nr,Retrospads,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the link! Been looking dor ages to make a dopp kitt! Question, what oz leather is preferable and the corner stitches are just one long stitch each corner yes?   Akso. How large in the end is this? Seems a bit big, and any idea how to lower it? Keep the 2"" difference?  (12x14"") etc?  Thanks so much!"

Leathercraft,3e3d44,Vanillacitron,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"If you're willing, you can cut the threads to either side of the keeper and replace the buckle, then restitch it. It shouldn't be all that difficult."

Leathercraft,3e3d44,wags_01,3,Tue Jul 21 17:35:50 2015 UTC,A couple needles and thread are cheap.
Leathercraft,3e3d44,wags_01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"True! I'll checkout the local store. Stupid question, but can you just use any old nylon thread for something small like that?"
Leathercraft,3e19x3,constantlyhazy,3,Tue Jul 21 04:38:46 2015 UTC,My only suggestion would be to leave it out in a well ventilated area and let it air out for a good long while.  Where did you get the skins?
Leathercraft,3e19x3,PRDU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:50:52 2015 UTC,I'm so disappointed in the smell. I got them from Springfield leather.
Leathercraft,3e19x3,PRDU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"Huh. Did you contact them and ask them if the smell is normal?  While not ideal, fabreze may help. Be sure to test it in an inconspicuous area first in case it discolors or somehow irreversibly damages the leather."
Leathercraft,3e19x3,PRDU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't, but that is a good idea to contact them.  Thank you, I will try that!"
Leathercraft,3e19x3,OleGravyPacket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:03:19 2015 UTC,"Be sure to contact them first before spraying the leather. If it isn't normal and they want you to return it, you don't want to send them back altered goods."

Leathercraft,3dy1d8,Danphillip,3,Mon Jul 20 21:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think so. I had a customer from Singapore that wanted a wallet ""as thick as possible."" It feels like everyone in the states wants it at thin as possible."
Leathercraft,3dy1d8,Calvus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"As always, awesome wallet! At first I wondered why the inside middle seam folded the direction it does, but after working it in my mind it make sense.  What are the dimensions of these midwallets? The more I see them the more I'm intrigued by them. Did you come up with a pattern on your own or is one available somewhere?"
Leathercraft,3dy1d8,Calvus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The middle seam definitely helps for folding it inward.  This particular design is one I came up with in Illustrator. It is roughly 7"" x 5.5""."

Leathercraft,3e0ud5,Hollydaize,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"Remember that you don't need to push the awl all the way through the leather to create a hole, and if your awl blade is tapered, only pushing it in part way will help it keep the hole it leaves smaller.  That being said, I use a Douglas slim awl blade for whatever that's worth. You might want to contact the guys over at LeatherWranglers.com and see if they can help you with your question.

Leathercraft,3dxb2v,ItsToka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely not, just cotton (maybe) fabric from Joann fabric."
Leathercraft,3dxb2v,thoughtcrimes,3,Mon Jul 20 15:48:53 2015 UTC,Maybe spray something like Scotch Guard over the fabric?
Leathercraft,3dxb2v,ItsToka,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:42 2015 UTC,Could be an option.

I'm doing a wallet with the pull-up tab (like Bellroy wallets). I'm stuck on how to finish the cut out and the tab. I know the rest of it isn't done either, but I'm mainly concerned with the area that's a little covered by the white thread.  It's hard to reach and I can't get enough space to really burnish it or even bevel effectively.   Imgur"
Leathercraft,3dxb2v,BeastmanCaravan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:32 2015 UTC,The belt for the contest! And I've been doing lots of wrist cuffs and flasks lately.

From there I'm starting a wallet for another Christmas gift. I have to prototype that one though. Going to take much longer."

Leathercraft,3dxb2v,thoughtcrimes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Finished my second project: a kindle touch cover. Pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/Zjadw  I used 4-5oz veg tan again. I used Fiebings ""Light Brown"" spirit-based dye which is obviously quite dark. I think I'm going to buy the oil-based dye because I don't think the spirit-dye penetrates the leather enough.  The design was a little frustrating. At various times I thought I might be wasting leather because the case would be too small. But it fits and to help coax the case into shape I wet-molded it a bit.  I'm my frustration I forgot to cut out the semi-circle for the home button and the space for the usb cable and power button. So that sucked, but I managed to back track a bit and cut them out. Next time I will slow down."

Leathercraft,3dx9tm,raw_kyle,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:54 2015 UTC,Can I ask where you bought the leather?
Leathercraft,3dwscv,yaygens,6,Mon Jul 20 04:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's called ""quilted."""
Leathercraft,3dwscv,knoticalknovelties,3,Mon Jul 20 04:54:32 2015 UTC,This isnt exactly the same but you get the idea. You sew some batting material on the inside to get that puffed look.
Leathercraft,3dwscv,blk_slp,3,Mon Jul 20 11:42:34 2015 UTC,I think it's called diamond quilting.  My SO says it's tuck and roll diamond.
Leathercraft,3dwscv,whiely,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:19 2015 UTC,Also if anyone can tell me how to achieve that poofy effect I'd be very greatful.
Leathercraft,3dwscv,PRDU,3,Mon Jul 20 04:35:44 2015 UTC,"As /u/knoticalknovelties has suggested, it is indeed a ""quilted"" style. The best way to achieve that poofy effect I think would be to have a layer of of stuffing in between two layers of leather, then stitch that quilting style into the leather."
Leathercraft,3dwscv,ItsToka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, to achieve the super pronounced quilted pattern, you can play with the geometry of the base versus the top quilting material. You're basically forcing the leather to pucker in a controlled manner by making the base stitching shape smaller than the top layer stitching shape."
Leathercraft,3dv70d,PRDU,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:28 2015 UTC,looks good! took you long enough!
Leathercraft,3dv70d,BeastmanCaravan,2,Sun Jul 19 21:57:39 2015 UTC,"You can say that again..I don't even think I have time to start a new project for the belt challenge now :(  I might just submit an older project and hope for the best.

Leathercraft,3dv70d,knoticalknovelties,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:51 2015 UTC,Wow that is really really nice.  Have you done anything to stiffen it? Did you use another tube to pull the leather around to get the shape? Any tips for stitching on the round ends?
Leathercraft,3dv70d,knoticalknovelties,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"The main tube body is two layers of 5-6oz chromexcel with two layers of bag stiffener between them. In reality, the main tube body doesn't need to be especially rigid. The next blueprint carrier I make will only be one layer of a thicker leather, and maybe a very thin lining leather like goat skin.  The tube was made by stretching it around a plastic tube that had an outer diameter that I wanted the finished leather tube to have as an inner diameter. This is the easiest way I found to make tubes so far.  As for the round end caps, I would recommend using your pricking irons/stitching chisels on only the main tube body or the cap, and then use an awl to create the stitching holes on the other part. basically, only mark holes with a chisel/iron on one part, and awl the other part. I marked both the top cap and the main tube with my iron, and I had to skip some holes in order for my stitching to line up correctly."

Leathercraft,3dxwxt,chribull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:07:10 2015 UTC,on rocky mountain leather he says he can get whatever sizes you want. Not sure how long the turnaround time is though.  Or maybe don't get all 3 sizes and start with one size with more teeth?
Leathercraft,3dxwxt,littlewaysny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"thanks! I emailed him already to see what his delivery time would be.  Well I only want two sizes (6 and 2 pricks). But you are right, its an option to go for only one and this big just that I cant do any work with round corners then (cause therefor you do need a 1 or 2 prick iron)."
Leathercraft,3dxwxt,littlewaysny,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:55 2015 UTC,I originally meant just go for the bigger size of 2&9 teeth if you could afford it in one SPI. Instead of buying multiple sets in different sizes starting out.  When I bought my first vergez pricking iron I got a size 9 in 4 teeth to save money and after a month I ended up selling it and upgrading to the larger size. It saves a decent amount of time and its easier to make straight lines with more teeth IMO. You can make them as neat with less teeth but it takes a bit more patience.  Remember that you normally put at least 1 or 2 teeth in the existing prick marks to help keep a straight line. So if you had a pricking iron with 5 teeth and you started 2 back you would be making only 3 marks at a time.   Also let me know what Rmountainleather says about the turnaround time I am interested in maybe placing a special order sometime soon.
Leathercraft,3dxwxt,littlewaysny,2,Mon Jul 20 13:42:34 2015 UTC,ye you got a point! Ill definitely rethink my 6 snd 2 plan :)  Will let you know!!
Leathercraft,3dxwxt,give_me_candy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:40 2015 UTC,just did a quick search. User: Andriypro sells all sizes in 5 teeth. And does sets of 2 & 5 in most sizes
Leathercraft,3dxwxt,littlewaysny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:27:55 2015 UTC,on ebay right? I just thought that 5 then again is so close to 2 already and then you have two almost the same size. normally i would just buy them but when spending so much money i figured i better be damn sure :) i might go for this offer though if there is no 6 ot 7 prick iron. thanks!
Leathercraft,3dxwxt,give_me_candy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:10 2015 UTC,Have you tried contacting Vergez Blanchard directly? The turnaround date of September seems extremely long. I ordered about 8-9 tools from them recently and they had them shipped out the next day and at my door in five days (Washington)

Leathercraft,3dw5h4,littlewaysny,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:20 2015 UTC,Few firsts on this one.  9 stitches per inch. Beige linen thread  First time using Giardini brown edge paint which I just got & first time sewing with the outer shell being the front side of the stitching. Normally sew from the inside out.
Leathercraft,3dw5h4,WyntonMarsalis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, that looks great! I have a few questions...  1) What goat did you use? 2) What edging tool did you use? 3) What was your source for your CXL?"
Leathercraft,3dw5h4,WyntonMarsalis,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:45 2015 UTC,thanks.  -Goat is Alran from France.  -Creaser or edger? The edger was a size 1 from goods japan. The creases were made with a soldering iron and creasing tip from ebay.   -This CXL is from Maverick. Its the 1st grade horsestrips. http://www.maverickleathercompany.com/horween/horse/brown-chromexcel-strips/
Leathercraft,3dw5h4,blk_slp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:52 2015 UTC,"-Creaser... That is what I meant.  -Man, that CXL is a lot lighter than the brown horse strips I got from Maverick."
Leathercraft,3dw5h4,toddmcnabbed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:23 2015 UTC,this is natural. they don't have it very often.  also they have 2 others called brown I believe. One is like more burgundy to my eyes and one is a true brown.
Leathercraft,3dto8m,zazard,3,Sun Jul 19 10:21:34 2015 UTC,woww pretty edges! I'd want one.
Leathercraft,3dto8m,gnoelnahc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:44:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you ! I'm not sure I'm really doing it right tough, because a lot of the edges I see around here are really mirror-y, and those ... well, aren't. I think it is because I don't have a ""rounded"" slicker or anything, I just used a dremel felt wheel, denim, and extra-fine sandpaper I used to polish plastic models."
Leathercraft,3dto8m,gnoelnahc,2,Sun Jul 19 10:48:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not that great at edges myself, I think there are many ways to achieve different types of edges tho! yours look really round, smooth and nice to touch, altho I did see a slight split at the side? not v clear cos the photo was blur.   did you use anything like wax or gum?  I only use fine sandpaper and canvas! I should give denim a try tho. mm!"

Also could you explain what it means by removing the 'shell' of a piece of leather? Is that the grain side or am I missing something?
Leathercraft,3dul7q,Enlighted_Eggplant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:36 2015 UTC,You can order samples online from them but if you want to place a real order you have to call/email.
Leathercraft,3dul7q,blk_slp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"Morning! You need to send them an email. They're pretty good at getting back to you. Seem friendly enough and have an unusual range. The samples I got seemed nice. The ""Bayou"" has a vacuum sealed flesh side, not sure what that is about.   Removing the ""shell"" only refers to horse hides. Refers to ""Shell Cordovan"", Shell Cordovan ""map"" - its a special, expensive cut that is only a few square feet on the horses hindquarter, with exceptional durability, shine and general look properties."

Leathercraft,3dqx5a,knoticalknovelties,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, should have made it a little less wide. I just used the cut outs for the tab. And no it wasn't hard at all. Next time i'd use thicker thread though to fill out the holes with the chisel. I used thinner thread just to use it up as an experiment."
Leathercraft,3dqx5a,knoticalknovelties,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"2-3oz is pretty thin I guess. I just thought it'd be a little stiff.

Leathercraft,3dqx5a,ItsToka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:14:13 2015 UTC,yeah i actually used this leather for the bag because it was really floppy. I originally bought it for wallets.

Leathercraft,3dqx5a,Stevieboy7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Thats an almost perfect thread size for your stitching. Any thicker, and you're just doing over-kill."
Leathercraft,3dqx5a,LeatherJim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The thread looks good, maybe using smaller holes would make them fill better. OP, I would suggest trying to awl punch the holes when using thin thread. Chisels tend to make gaping holes for me, especially since mine are only sharp at the points so the sides push to expand the hole vs. a sharp awl that slices on the sides to make a narrow hole that closes itself."
Leathercraft,3dqx5a,thoughtcrimes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:41:05 2015 UTC,"I don't actually have an awl. I need to purchase one but i'm not sure which size i should be buying. I'm essentially brand new, this is only the second thing i've made.The chisels i have are 6spi. I've looked at stitching awls but i just get semi confused and give up."
Leathercraft,3dqx5a,WeevilKnievel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:19:07 2015 UTC,I was in that stage for a few months. I was recommended http://www.barrykingtools.com/handtools.htm the flat medium awl handle along with http://www.sheridanleather.com/mobile/Product.aspx?id=37836 the slim awl blade   Using this combo has really increased the quality of my work. Expensive but so worth it. I only use chisels for marking hope spacing now. It's much easier to make consistently straight holes and control how big the holes are by the depth of the awl punch. I would recommend sharpening the blade for a while following videos on YouTube and making sure to polish the blade well so it glides smooth. Best of luck!
Leathercraft,3dqx5a,WeevilKnievel,2,Sun Jul 19 06:54:17 2015 UTC,Thanks you very much! I'll have to do an order soon
Leathercraft,3dqx5a,chribull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:19 2015 UTC,"It looks to fill pretty well... for some reason leatherworkers here never seem to hammer their stitches after they're finished, and then complain about thread size.

I've been meaning to try a 1:4 mix of titebond to water instead of beeswax; SCA'ers use the mix to harden leather armor and if that can waterproof the bottle without it starting to melt a bit in direct sunlight that'd get rid of the big disadvantage.  As far as the bladder ones, I'm pretty sure they were cured, and not tanned. Mostly waterproof when wet, but once empty and dry they could crack if unfolded without a little bit of a pre-soak."

Leathercraft,3dlsa0,grigby,3,Fri Jul 17 11:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend treating the leather for water. If water gets deep into leather it will never completely dry out. There will always be a mark there which could ruin the project. While really no product will make it waterproof, many make it more water resistant.  Ian Atkinson has a great video showing off different products and water testing is done.

Leathercraft,3dlsa0,PRDU,2,Sun Jul 19 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the aesthetic that you are trying to achieve. If you want a chunky and robust look, thicker thread and lower SPI are what you want. A finer and more delicate look will require thinner thread and higher SPI.   For me, I use 8 SPI and 0.8mm thread for wallets and pocket stuff. 6 SPI and 1mm thread for large bulky items like gunbelts and outdoor gear. 7 SPI is in between, though I do usually use 0.8mm thread with it."

Leathercraft,3dk47i,ItsToka,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:29 2015 UTC,The amount of force you get from the press is the most important thing. I have a 6 ton shop press from Harbor Freight and it works fine. It could be better -- the cutting area is limited and it could probably benefit from having a plate press welded on in place of the ram -- but it gets the job done. It cuts 12-14 oz leather no problem as well. It really only has issues with large dies on which the force needs to be distributed over a bigger area.
Leathercraft,3dk47i,rev_rend,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:39:48 2015 UTC,"That's a little encouraging, I'm really only talking wallet interior pieces so small area thin weight. What kind of dies do you use with it?"
Leathercraft,3dk47i,rev_rend,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:48:04 2015 UTC,"Here's one of my bigger/complex ones. I usually have to move it around on the cutting area so the ram can apply pressure in different spots.  With a handle and mallet, my only concern would be that if you don't get enough force the first time, your die might jump."
Leathercraft,3dk47i,stay_at_home_daddy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:12:37 2015 UTC,Would you mind showing pics of your setup?  How much did it cost you to get it setup?
Leathercraft,3dk47i,rev_rend,2,Fri Jul 17 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"Here it is from way back when I set it up. With the steel plates, it was probably around $150.  You can see the problems with feeding the work area. If I'm doing a lot of one piece, cutting strips like that is probably the fastest way to do a lot of pieces quickly. Usually, if I'm just doing one piece, I'll have a section of a hide that's sticking out a bit from the rest that can fit in. Shell cordovan, horse strip, and small exotics are all nice to use with this because they tend to fit in fairly nicely."

The problem is that the oils have a tendency to bleed out.   The best thing to do is get a nice old tshirt and buff the thing until it stops leaving marks on the rag.   Also keep it out of the rain. The contents should stay dry but it might bleed again if it gets wet. If that happens just repeat the same procedure."

It is the only thing that has managed to keep my feet dry and my black leather black in the heavily salted Michigan winter streets  To get the most out of your snow-proof sit the leather in front of a space heater or a hair dryer beforehand.

It's an opaque, whitish color. I know for a fact that it does slightly darken the leather (and upon reading about the Snow Proof stuff, I think that probably does that a bit, too. I don't mind, though.). It says it lubricates leather and protects against drying and deterioration. It claims to be natural wax that won't harm the leather. Thoughts? I mean, I can buy the Snow Proof stuff, but I have this on hand and am thinking it might be just as good."

Leathercraft,3dfpjw,unchow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"I do a fair bit of lacing on wallets, so much so that I wish people didn't want so many wallets. But I found the 1/8th in superior or imperial calf lace from tandy fits the bill. I don't burnish the edges or anything like that just a few coats of fiebings leather balm with atom wax pre lacing. I mostly use doubble loop or mexican round lacing a few tips if your not using kit leather with pre punched holes use lacing punches that make little sits it'll give you a better overall appearance. Also be meticulous about direction the lace runs the and tension you pull to every turn. Try very hard to hide the end piece I prefer bottom inside something that doesn't show outside. After all work is done tap down the lacing softly with a mallet not a maul it lasts everything down nice."

Leathercraft,3da7qt,pipsqeek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:51:23 2015 UTC,Definitely. A whole 20mm NATO strap with all the holes punched is around $350.

Leathercraft,3dclw4,OleGravyPacket,3,Wed Jul 15 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"I prefer a diamond stitching chisel over just an awl, though I do use both in my process. The chisel makes perfect uniform holes all in a straight line... The end result just looks much more clean and uniform. I HAVE used just an awl for the whole process, but the end result was very crude and un-sightly. Maybe with a lot of practice and finite measuring / marking you could make your awled holes pretty straight and uniform... But that just seems like too much work for me.  I usually just scratch a line (with my awl) where I want to stitch. I use the chisel and pop the holes in... Then when it comes time to stitch, I run my awl through every hole just to make sure its opened up and ready to go."
Leathercraft,3dclw4,Letric,2,Wed Jul 15 06:42:53 2015 UTC,I think to get that uniform pattern you're missing the use of an overstitch wheel which will give you uniform holes you can work with the awe on after.
Leathercraft,3dclw4,CurlyFatAngry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:30:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. Maybe I've just been picturing how people use them wrong? I thought everyone was punching each hole individually with the awl and I just thought seemed weird.
Leathercraft,3dclw4,FehuLeather,4,Wed Jul 15 06:55:32 2015 UTC,"Awls are indeed used to punch individual holes. You can get much smaller and tighter stitches with an awl. It is also, with practice, much faster. There is deffiently a learning curve to using one however, and I would strongly suggest finding an old harness maker to show you the ropes. The one place I have found chisels to be better than an awl is on thin flimsy things, like watch straps."
Leathercraft,3dclw4,knoticalknovelties,3,Wed Jul 15 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"I use both. I use the diamond chisel to mark my spaces and help get a start on the piercing, then pierce the rest of the way through with an awl.   I find that method helps me line up the stitches straight on the backside better.   With thinner layered projects, I just use he chisel to punch the whole way through."
Leathercraft,3dclw4,JPMoo,2,Wed Jul 15 07:43:05 2015 UTC,All of what ^ just said.
Leathercraft,3dclw4,Hollydaize,3,Wed Jul 15 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Let me begin by saying that using the correct thread size and needle size will make any hole look better than one that doesn't use those. I find that an awl allows me to make neater holes than a chisel, but it is more work, a lot more. You need to sharpen the awl and punch every hole individually, being site to make the hole at the same angles everytime. The problem I've run into with stitching chisels is that in order to keep the prongs from breaking they are fairly wide and instead of making just a diagnal line they make more of a rhombus. They usually doesn't translate over into the finished piece though, especially if you flatten your thread, but it's just a small thing that if you are practiced with an awl can make your work look a tiny bit nicer."
Leathercraft,3dclw4,asdem,2,Wed Jul 15 11:20:23 2015 UTC,"I use diamond chisels exclusively. I never learned how to use an awl. I also primarily use 1mm thread. Using a chisel goes very quickly for me now, and I like the uniform look of it."
Leathercraft,3dclw4,Landholder,2,Wed Jul 15 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"I use a chisel if both pieces are flat.  I use an awl because there are no holsters that are flat.  When you're stitching around a circle, your stitches will be smaller on the inside of the circle than on the outside."
Leathercraft,3dclw4,stay_at_home_daddy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the few that use an awl exclusively.  Their are pros and cons to both, but I believe that in the long run an awl is more cost efficient, quicker and more versatile.  However the awl does have a much higher learning curve.  If you are wanting to just make a few items then chisels will give you good results from the start."

Leathercraft,3dbv0q,FehuLeather,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:18:24 2015 UTC,"In general it is a bad idea to oil leather before using an acrylic. It is okay to do it before dyeing, as the dye dries-out the leather.

Leathercraft,3dbe08,scienceyeaux,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:28:26 2015 UTC,One thing that is troublesome about leatherwork is that there is generally water everywhere. It is easy to set down tools in small puddles without realizing it.   Be sure that they are put away at the end of every session and completely dry. A very humid environment can be just as harmful.  When storing tools for long periods between use it is a good idea to give the tool a light coat of oil to prevent corrosion.

Leathercraft,3d9sop,PoppinPMAGs,4,Tue Jul 14 16:48:16 2015 UTC,You should oil it first. In my experience a light topping of oil (I use olive) makes the dying much more consistent. Don't overdo it though or the leather weakens. Keep it very light
Leathercraft,3d9sop,grigby,2,Tue Jul 14 17:12:00 2015 UTC,Are you using oil-based or spirit-based dye? Do you think that would make a difference?
Leathercraft,3d9sop,thoughtcrimes,4,Tue Jul 14 20:46:38 2015 UTC,My dye is actually water based. I haven't tried the others. However I don't think it would change much. The oil is there essentially to help the leather moisten up so that the dye can spread over it easier instead of one are immediately sucking it up. At least that's my understanding.
Leathercraft,3d9sop,grigby,2,Tue Jul 14 21:52:36 2015 UTC,Oil will generally improve the dye job with any base dye. It is most significant with oil based dyes.  Always test on scrap first anyway though.
Leathercraft,3d9sop,SnidelyMcWhiplash,2,Tue Jul 14 23:31:01 2015 UTC,How's the rancidity of it over time? Or does the dye kill enough of it to prevent that?
Leathercraft,3d9sop,KnightOfAshes,2,Wed Jul 15 01:58:24 2015 UTC,Rancidity? What do you mean?
Leathercraft,3d9sop,SnidelyMcWhiplash,2,Wed Jul 15 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"There's a reason you don't lubricate mechanical components like gearboxes or the bearings on your prosthetic with olive oil (thanks, Almost Human, for spreading that misinformation): it goes rancid.

I have always been taught that oiling is something you do to extend the goods lifespan.   Perhaps it does go rancid eventually but it does more good than harm in the long run, without it your leather would dry out and become brittle, eventually falling apart."

Leathercraft,3d9sop,yaygens,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:22:35 2015 UTC,"Either Feibings Acrylic Antiques or Tandy Eco Flo Antiques will be a pretty failproof option. That also gives the belt a bit more texture. It collects and darkens in any depressions in the leather and will highlight imperfections and scars as well. Both come in a nice medium brown.   If you go the spirit or oil dye rout you will could get a more uniform color if you do it very well, but it could easily come out darker than intended.  Whatever you choose you will want to seal it with something. There are countless products that will work. Tan-cote is a common option, tandy has super shine or satin shine. Just pick one with the amount of gloss/matte that sounds right, outside of that they are pretty much all the same if you're just doing a single project."

Leathercraft,3d878j,god12,2,Tue Jul 14 07:12:07 2015 UTC,"Leather seems to be sold and worked on using various different measurements of thickness (e.g. mm, inches, oz). What exactly should these measurements be used to determine? For example, what does the weight of the leather indicate about it or what it should be used for?   Tandy has a pretty good chart that shows the conversion of OZ to MM for the thickness. All that really matters though, is knowing what thickness you want to use. The higher the oz, the thicker the leather. There are no rules about thickness to use for projects only suggestions based on experience and common sense. You would regret using 8-9oz leather for a wallet.   When you finish all the stitching and go through the last hole, how do you finish off the thread? Should you tie it in a knot? One tutorial I watched mentioned applying heat but didn't show how or even what that means. Any insights?   There are a few techniques for finishing a stitch line. ""Applying Heat"" means melting the end of the stitch so it doesn't come undone. Usually with a regular lighter. Personally, I like getting to the end, then coming back down the stitch line maybe 3-5 stitches, then cutting the thread. No need for a bulky knot at ll. I also like putting rivets at the end of my stitch line for added strength and aesthetics."

Leathercraft,3d878j,grigby,2,Tue Jul 14 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"If using a pricking iron, do you punch both sides to ensure even holes or do you only punch one side? If you do both sides, how do you make sure they match?    I do not use a pricking iron, instead I like to precut my holes using a chisel. I know that marking holes and then using an awl is the ""proper"" way of doing it, but I like my chisel. That being said, when using a pricking iron you only mark on one side. Then as you're using your awl to punch the holes you have to aim the awl so that it goes into the stitch groove on the other side. You should be able to see on the other side where the awl will come through before it actually pierces the surfaces, you use that to make sure you have the aim right.   If not using a pricking iron or an over-stitch wheel or any particular tool, is there a recommended method for keeping track of where to punch holes with the awl? I'd imagine I could just mark the 7 stitches per inch with a pencil or something along a ruler but I haven't seen anything posted with a specific guide to this.   Well like I said, I use a diamond chisel to do holes, this one to be precise. Though that would also work well if I just wanted to mark the holes and then use an awl. Just wouldn't hammer as hard. That tool ensures equal spacing.   I know using glue is a good idea for ensuring that stitching stays lined up, but what sort of glue should be used? I've seen a couple different resources that suggest various sorts of concrete glues but nothing conclusive. What do you guys use?    I use this glue from Tandy I'm pretty sure."
Leathercraft,3d878j,feketenoemi,2,Tue Jul 14 14:11:36 2015 UTC,"The tool guide recommends harness needles but doesn't specify a thickness of needle. Which needle thickness is the best for leatherwork?   It really depends on the weight of leather and the thickness of thread you work with. The sizes you see most often are 00 0 and 1 which are the larger sizes but you can  find them close to the size of a regular needle. (For needle sizes the higher the number the smaller the needle.)  I personally like the smaller harness needles, usually around a size 4 or 5 depending on the thread I'm using.  John James or Osborne needles are the best two brands out there."

Leathercraft,3d7gll,asdem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:57:15 2015 UTC,In my opinion you should use a smaller post rivet. A 9mm post on 4mm of leather is going to bend and not compress straight down easily. A 6mm post would be much better.

Springfield Leather should have it, and they cut down leather for you if you need smaller quantities.   If I were doing it I would either use 2 strips of 2/3 sewn together if I wanted to do a nice job, or a single strip of 4/5 if it needed to be done a little cheaper.   As an added benefit, when you sew down the edge of leather you add to its resistance to stretching without too significantly hampering its flexibility. It would also allow a cleaner look if you sandwiched the main bracer material between the two halves of the strap where they attach."

Leathercraft,3d48ly,squishyburger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:27:52 2015 UTC,Yea the original sheath had slits for the belt which I didn't care for so I decided to make the loop so it would be easier to put on. And I made the sheath snug enough so I wouldn't have to make a strap to keep the knife from moving around. The original sheath also had metal snaps around the edge by the stitching which didn't look good so I decided to keep it simple.

Leathercraft,3d59dg,narin1313,5,Mon Jul 13 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"Short answer,  Yes you can.   Long Answer,  The back should dye just fine, if you are having trouble it is likely because your leather is too fuzzy on the back. If the back is too fuzzy it can be troublesome, there is nothing you can do about that. That fuzzy back will be troublesome for everything you do to the leather. The real solution to this problem and countless others is to buy better leather. Quality Vegtan should have a very tight grain with little to no ""hairs"" on the flesh side, which will dye with no problem at all. Unfortunately that isn't always an option, but it can be cheaper than you might think. (literally nothing Tandy sells qualifies)  When it isn't, there are a few extra considerations that can be helpful   Any type of dye can be used but antiques will be much trickier on a rough back as they cannot flow to fill in the deeper nooks and crannies.   Do not forget to buff the back. Excess pigment left behind will rub off on clothing or skin from the backs of leather much more easily than the front. Because of the more spongy texture of the flesh side it will adsorb, and consequently bleed, more dye.  After buffing, Using Gum Tragacanth, Glycerin Saddle Soap, or a similar product in combination with a slicker can smooth out a rough back and will also prevent pigment transfer.  Edit: Clarity"

Also, at least at the store that I worked at, we sold so little of it that the sides would sit there for as long as a year before they sold so they were always dry and much more difficult to work.

Just make sure the leather is completely dry on the other side, or some might seep through. Also it doesn't work as well on thinner leathers for the same reason.  If the leather you are getting is really rough, upgrade the quality of leather. That rough leather is tougher to sew through, tougher to slick, and doesn't tool/dye as well.

Leathercraft,3d7e6b,sgircys,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:52:28 2015 UTC,What would the wing divider allow me to do? Just mark where the stitch would go?   What do you do about the cut edge? Do you bevel it?

Tools are mostly stored in the shelving I made above my first bench, but things tend to end up living where they get used most (ie knives stay by the cutting mat, maul stays on the bench, edge bevelers and marking awls float around mysteriously)."

Leathercraft,3d4rcm,PoppinPMAGs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:45:51 2015 UTC,Tooling leather and larger hides and sides in a closet in the back either rolled or folded. Originally the smaller garment leather hides were in plastic bins in the closet but they have migrated out to a shelf by the dining room table where I work.  Regular use tools are in a mechanic's tool box and a smaller wood box on the table and I was given a ton of tools so I have a second tool box in the back for them.  I probably need to go through everything and reorganize and maybe destash the stuff I'm not using.

Leathercraft,3d3uds,grigby,2,Mon Jul 13 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"I just bought it from Tandy. I took a wool dauber and made sure it got all over. Then (as per bottle directions) I went across the entire leather in long strokes. I guess so that if if did dry and leave a pattern they would be straight, though there's barely any streaking anyway, not visible until you get really close."
Leathercraft,3d3uds,thoughtcrimes,2,Mon Jul 13 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"I finished my first real project on Sunday. A field notes wallet: http://imgur.com/a/2r3cd  It's 4oz-5oz vegtan. I got a single shoulder at 50% off from Tandy the other week. This project was cut mostly from the odd-shaped edges.  Dyed with tan Fiebing's spirit-based dye. Conditioned with pure neatsfoot oil and a coat of Eco-Flo Carnauba Cream. Every time I buffed it, pigment was still coming off on the cloth. So I applied a layer of Fiebing's Acrylic Resolene to seal it, but I have a hard time applying that evenly (previously used on a belt blank), and there is some streaking on the back :(  For the stitching, I used Kyoshin Elle 3mm diamond chisels, JJ 002 harness needles, and amber glow coloured tiger thread. This is probably the weakest part and I've started looking at the Nigel Armitage videos to see where I went wrong.  To finish the edges I used a Kyoshin Elle #1 edge beveler (probably should have used a #2), and a Hole Master Tip -1/8"",1/16"" burnishing tool from proedgeburnishers.com that attaches to a Dremel (the 1/4"",1/8"" sized one may have been better for leather this thick). I also used Seiwa Tokonole Tragacanth and a piece of canvas to finish off the burnishing.  I mocked up the design for this in SketchUp. I've since gone back and made a couple changes: (1) gave more room in the spine to slide a pencil in there when closed, and (2) extend the pocket leather further toward the center (I messed up my cutting of these pieces and they aren't even as wide as my original design)."

We got a bunch of new leathers in from Horween and from Maverick, and I am pretty pleased with the shipments.  We make these growler caddies and they go over pretty well since we live in an area where there are a lot of craft breweries.  But a few days ago I had a customer inquire about making something similar for her 'meowler'.  It is similar to a growler, but it is a quarter gallon size.  This is the finished project.  Basically just a scaled down version.    Got some color 8 shell cordovan and some dublin from Horween and put together these wallets.  So now our shell cordovan collection is getting pretty big.  Used the last of a hide of natural vintage to make this guy.  I have had a lot of good luck with this leather - it sells very quickly.  It has a nice pull up and feels a lot like cxl.  I picked it up from Maverick quite some time ago.  All out now though.  Picked up some navy cxl from Maverick and made this mid wallet.  I am really happy with it.  I kind of want to keep it because I wouldn't have to worry about indigo rub from my jeans...  Lastly, my wife has been really getting in to making earrings.  Most are made with brass hardware and accents.  Cheers!"

Not sure that I saw your friend though, as no one mentioned anything :)  We set up at local venues pretty regularly from June through December.  We have a pretty big art scene here, so we have good luck generally.  It is quite a bit of work, and sometimes it is hard for us since we have two young children.

The problem that arises is that no matter how well you clean it up afterwords there will be some saddle soap remaining on the edges of the grain side. This prevents the dye from penetrating there and you get a belt with light spots all up and down the edges.
Leathercraft,3cwy6u,SnidelyMcWhiplash,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:39:25 2015 UTC,I was thinking of just doing a light burnish with water and maybe a little glycerin soap. I'll have to do some tests and see what works best though.
Leathercraft,3cwy6u,vimmi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:39:07 2015 UTC,That could work well for you. Edge paints are another. I am not a fan myself but i have friends who quite like them.

Leathercraft,3cwy6u,ElMangosto,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:07:58 2015 UTC,Awesome work !! Keep it up. Nice to see you are getting goo use out of that awesome work bench you made a while back. If you don't mind me asking what size punches are you using for the oval holes and the buckle tong oblong holes?? I need to pick up these and can't decide on a good multi-use size.  Thank you
Leathercraft,3cwy6u,Stevieboy7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's been great having a standing workspace.  The oval punch is a #15 which I believe is 5mmx8mm. The oblong punch is just a 1""."
Leathercraft,3cxet9,Davian45,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:06:41 2015 UTC,Tab pull was a brave first project! Nicely done!
Leathercraft,3cxet9,JPMoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:31:03 2015 UTC,Yeah figured as much but no better way to see what you can do than start with something out of your comfort zone! I have vegtan on it's way that i think will be a lot easier to work with then this stuff.
Leathercraft,3cxet9,ChronicCynic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:39:51 2015 UTC,Aces!

Leathercraft,3cxet9,ChronicCynic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:08:02 2015 UTC,Never seen a wallet like this. How did you design the tab?
Leathercraft,3cwwjh,Hollydaize,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:13:38 2015 UTC,That's holding up great!
Leathercraft,3cwwjh,effdriver,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:34:55 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm happy with it considering it came from an economy side from Springfield.
Leathercraft,3cwwjh,effdriver,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:24:20 2015 UTC,Really love that. Any details on the project?
Leathercraft,3cwwjh,effdriver,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, and sure! It's all 4 oz veg tan. Hand dyed and stitched, using tiger thread.   The buyer said that they wanted a bag that they could carry their paperwork and laptop from their home to their office. I didn't have a whole lot of time to make this, but they liked the simple design."
Leathercraft,3cxfdm,Leatherweld,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:11:18 2015 UTC,I can make these for you if needed.  I'm a blacksmith.
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,justanothermortal,2,Fri Jul 10 17:46:00 2015 UTC,Is that Horween on the field notes cover? Does the stiffness of the leather force the book open?
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,asdem,3,Fri Jul 10 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"It's this leather: http://springfieldleather.com/42087/Side%2COilTan%2CKentuckyDerby4-5oz/  And I don't think its too stiff. I just made it, but I think the more I use it and keep it closed, it'll stay shut. Like, if I don't close it with the  elastic band, it's like this right now: http://i.imgur.com/OwCjikm.jpg"
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,ScottStrittmatter,2,Fri Jul 10 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"Woah, am I reading this right? That leather you linked to on Springfield is only $6.99 total, for 24 square feet?"
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,ScottStrittmatter,2,Fri Jul 10 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Nooooo. Haha. If you want 24, it's 24sq feet x$6.99"
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,Richeh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah that's what I was thinking as I read it a couple more times. Hopeful me got excited for a hot minute though. Great job, btw!"
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,thoughtcrimes,4,Fri Jul 10 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, haha. And yeah, I think I did that the first time I got leather from springfield. They called me and was like, ""All you want is 1 sq foot?"" Hahhaha."
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,BeastmanCaravan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"I made one for a friend; by happy accident I wet the leather to stamp a logo on it, and  I learned a) wetting leather's a good way to encourage a fold in the finished article and b) if you're wetting it, soak the whole thing, not just the part you're moulding or you get tidemarks.  Fortunately it didn't look too bad."
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,ImherefortheH1Z1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:56:39 2015 UTC,Nice photos.  What are you doing for stitching?

Leathercraft,3ctkx7,josermj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:40 2015 UTC,That white lacing was bold.  I like the brown on brown a little better.  The lacing looks tighter on the notebook cover.  Was it perhaps done second/later?
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,josermj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any black thread, so I had to do white. I didn't think brown would go. I actually did the cover first, but I think the wallet I had a bit more trouble. D:"
Leathercraft,3ctkx7,thoughtcrimes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:43:33 2015 UTC,Nice work on the Midori-style notebook cover!
Leathercraft,3cvj6x,Lucky_20,3,Sat Jul 11 03:12:52 2015 UTC,"When you dye you should always wipe off the excess as you apply.  Don't just let big globs stay on the leather, it will make that area darker than the rest.  When I dye, I use those wool dappers and go in a circular motion, then use a cloth to wipe off the excess.  I take it in sections."
Leathercraft,3cvj6x,reddeathfrog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:26:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! The instructions are miss leading. I'll start doing that from now on.
Leathercraft,3cvj6x,tossik,2,Sat Jul 11 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"You should oils your leather first, and then I also apply some water on the surface right before dying. This prevents streaking as leather is now moist and applications of dye will be even. Don't apply dye on dry piece or it will streak."
Leathercraft,3cvj6x,Sentinel_Triton,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:43:15 2015 UTC,First things first. What product are you using?
Leathercraft,3cvj6x,Sentinel_Triton,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:47:59 2015 UTC,I've used Eco Flo Professional Waterstain and also Fiebings leather color
Leathercraft,3ctqsd,stigsd,3,Fri Jul 10 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"Damn, this is a really nice design, thanks for sharing!  Especially the measurements page :)  Trying to get a sense for how thick it is when rolled up, would it be possible to post a side pic, please?"

Leathercraft,3ctqsd,YoloCowboy,2,Sat Jul 11 02:36:30 2015 UTC,This is amazing.   I think I'm going to have to get myself one of those circle cutters.

Leathercraft,3ctqsd,changlorious_basterd,2,Sat Jul 11 02:36:46 2015 UTC,"Wow I love this. I see on your sketch it says 4-5oz, what weight did you wind up using?"
Leathercraft,3ctqsd,GodKingThoth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:18:41 2015 UTC,Those estimates were what I ended up using.
Leathercraft,3ctt3q,patrifecta,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Nice stitching! I made a trial minimal wallet for myself a few months back. I've had issues with the cutouts stretching, and now my cards fall out of the pockets. Do you have the same issue? Also, more pics please!"
Leathercraft,3ctt3q,diddy403,3,Sat Jul 11 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"I had problems with stretching early on, too.  Here are a couple things I've found to help:   Use better leather.  Loose grain can cause it to stretch while cutting. Use a cork-backed ruler to guid your blade, and press firmly on it to keep the leather in place. Make sure your cutting tool is sharp. Cut on a surface that grips the bottom side of the leather (same idea as cork-backed ruler, but on the bottom). If your leather is thin, look into a rotary cutter.  This cuts downward instead of pulling to the side.   Let us know if these tips help you!"
Leathercraft,3ctt3q,Dannihilation,2,Sat Jul 11 03:39:19 2015 UTC,Really clean design all around. I'm just trying to figure out how the top pocket prevents a card from going too far in. And also what the purpose of the stitching in the middle is for. More pictures would be great as well!
Leathercraft,3cv5q5,RYAN_THE_KING,2,Sat Jul 11 01:07:37 2015 UTC,"I have set A and set B and a dremel, with the ""Workstation"" attachment that makes it a drill press for lack of a better word.  The Dremel is cool, I recently picked up an actual drill press, and will likely be switching to drill-press only parts rather than dremel in the future. Its a little wonky with the speed selector, its either too fast or too slow most of the time. For the price though, I couldn't beat it.  Set A is what I'm currently using right now to burnish edges, it took 2 weeks to come here from China, and boy is it tiny. That is a crazy zoomed in picture on the amazon site, so just note, they're small. It does work well though, at first the wood finish from the cocobolo did transfer to my leather so I ran it on high against some oil rags and it seems to have stopped the transferring from happening now.   Set B is much like A, I imagine they have the same issue of transfer. Other than that its the same as A except a flat bottom instead of a tapered.   Hope that helps! If you can find better ones that are from a drill press and made in the USA as well as pick up a press at a garage sale, that might be a better option."
Leathercraft,3cv5q5,diddy403,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"I cannot say how good the items you listed are, but I purchased a set from LEATHERBURNISHERS and they are amazing!  Fit the Dremel perfectly, and do an absolutely stunning job burnishing edges.  The crafter makes them by hand, at home I think, and is a real craftsman.  Anyway, just in the event you may want to try something made here in America, I can give my endorsement.  Have a great day!"

Leathercraft,3crv0p,JPMoo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:59:35 2015 UTC,2oz and pretty easy to work with. The only thing I had to keep in mind was not to use to much tesion or it would bunch together; but I think that was more thickness than animal
Leathercraft,3crv0p,BeastmanCaravan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:20:08 2015 UTC,tell us about the coconut oil/beeswax finish!
Leathercraft,3crv0p,BeastmanCaravan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:03:44 2015 UTC,I used equal parts wax and oil melted together. It turns pretty solid but I scraped it out and it turns to a thick paste. I just worked it in with a cloth and polished it. It worked well.
