EndlessWar,3e41so,notcorey,3,Tue Jul 21 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"""Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron."""

The courts have already declared this constitutional, the military is free to require male-only registration because it is what they deem appropriate. It is a separation of powers argument that the Judicial branch will not overturn."

EndlessWar,3e0q6g,avengingturnip,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"This article is premised on the absurd notion that there is a concrete difference in foreign policy between Republicans and Democrats and that the US is a democracy and not some sort of plutocratic corporate oligarchy.  I mean, is this really surprising? The US has long viewed the UN as either an obstacle or a propaganda tool. Kings never want parliament involved in their wars. The War Powers Act is so 1960s -- it's been ignored from almost as soon as it was passed.  The Pentagon/president's desire to wage unpopular wars is why we abandoned the draft -- to create a ""professional army"" of indoctrinated ""volunteers"" so our militarists could wage unpopular wars without the mass resistance of both civilians and soldiers that we saw in our immoral war on Vietnam. From the point of view of American imperialists, the strategy has worked brilliantly."
EndlessWar,3e0q6g,plutonicraven,2,Tue Jul 21 12:48:17 2015 UTC,"When Leon Panetta was secretary of defense he told congress to their face, if we (the military) want to go to war, we will seek international approval and then inform you. He went on to state, if America was attacked the military would be obligated to defend it.  Basicly saying, the military does not work for America, but lives off the tab, so they will do their job only IF it comes to that. This is the definition of a rogue military, and federal government."

EndlessWar,3dxqtx,caferrell,2,Mon Jul 20 14:47:23 2015 UTC,I don't know how the US government can make any claim to the contrary that its policy towards the Middle East is just one of destabilization.  I also don't understand how the US voter either doesn't see this or doesn't care.
