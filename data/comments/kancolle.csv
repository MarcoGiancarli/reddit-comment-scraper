Beside, that stat is way too OP. It's a little over kill on Yamato-class so I think it was an effort to buff the Nagato-class (Like the 51cm gun)"
kancolle,3e1p0y,Moesugi,4,Tue Jul 21 07:40:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think so...for now AP is still better than RADAR in most circumstances .   Even compare to other RADAR, it doesn't have significant difference with FUMO(-2 firepower, +1 armor, +1 evasion, -2 AA, -2 Los)"
kancolle,3e1p0y,StoneFlame,3,Tue Jul 21 07:51:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it OP though, since in most cases you'd still use an improved AP shell over this.  That's not to say this radar isn't useful, just that it has its niche uses, such as LOS heavy requirements or AA CI on a BB."

kancolle,3e29uu,gililore1234,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:48 2015 UTC,your setup looks fine to me. I think you just need to level your ise class ships up some more and you should be good. that or get lucky.

kancolle,3e29uu,AlmaElma,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"Well you don't need 3BB3CV, use 4BB2CV. Aside from that just modernize your ships.   I won't advise leveling Ise class over Fusou girls unless you really like them since they have no Kai2 so it's kind of a dead end. They appear at so many merchandize items (face of arcade game, for example) that it baffles me that they still don't have a second remodel."

I haven't found any use for these, and they're all pretty easy to come by.  And yeah, get more CA.  Don't worry about the event and just pray to RNGesus.  If you find yourself having nothing to do in this game, maybe look to ring someone."
kancolle,3e1c99,thats_no_fluke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:27:45 2015 UTC,"Those extra planes and guns are generally from equipment crafting, haven't gone on a scrapping spree on a while, but I will remove them tomorrow! extra space is always nice. I also need to clean out my other ships since being at 95/100 after scrapping slows down progress a lot.  CA lvling has sped up a lot with haguro reaching kai. More MVPs and a few extra levels. Hopefully it wont take more than a few days of grinding 3-2A to get her to Kai Ni. After that I plan to do Ashigara and Myoukou, then I should probably switch to another ship type?  Marrying a ship is a way long term goal lol. Too many levels for now. I'll have a ton of ships to level in the meantime though!"
kancolle,3e1c99,Leverno,2,Tue Jul 21 07:03:19 2015 UTC,"The amount of fuel you have seems to be stagnating because you are doing very little expeditions that give you fuel. Of the expeditions you are currently doing, only 5 and 36 give you a significant amount of fuel, while 2, 5, 37, 12 and 14 all give you a lot of ammo.  As there is no point in having twice as much ammo as fuel because the event will be over for you if you have no fuel, you might want to do more fuel expeditions. Instead of doing 12 and 14 overnight, you should try doing 9 and 24 which give you 350 and 500 fuel in one run, respectively.  If you manage to craft 4 more drums (e.g. by spamming the 10-10-10-10 recipe with a destroyer), you can also do 38 instead of 37 during the day."
kancolle,3e1c99,Leverno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"Quick last minute response to this before bed.  I'm doing exped 2 primarily for the buckets, so I don't plan to stop that. Would you think it would be better to stop exped 37 for now and switch it to exped 21 for the extra fuel (until i get more drums for 38 of course)? I'd be losing out on the steel, but for now I don't seem to be using much of that.  In the future, I will switch those overnight expeditions. I've been in the habit of doing 12 and 14 since I needed the steel prior and they gave a decent income of it overnight."
kancolle,3e1c99,Admiral_Mikan,2,Tue Jul 21 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worth giving expedition 21 a try. Running a sortie requires fuel and ammo, and repairing a ship requires fuel and steel, so fuel is very important.   As long as you are only doing 3-2A, the amount of steel you are using will be very low."
kancolle,3e1c99,Whistend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:53 2015 UTC,"I actually managed to get 3 more drums today from the default crafting, so I'm currently doing 2, 5, and 38! Looking to try to get some more Drums so I can attempt to do 2, 21, 38. But that will be a worry for later"
kancolle,3e1c99,madharuhi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:58:31 2015 UTC,Fuel is the most important resource in event. Its amount should be higher than ammo.
kancolle,3e1c99,Noperative,2,Tue Jul 21 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"-You'll definitely need to level some CAs. I suggest leveling Haguro, Maya, and Ashigara up to Kai2 if possible. By using 3-2 with CA as flagship, you'll also be leveling up your BB & CV(L) while doing so). Switching out Hibiki for another CA might also be more efficient. I usually use [CA (Flagship) / BB / CV(L) / CV(L) / CA / SS] setup for 3-2, as 2 CAs could be leveled up at the same time.  Link to a guide for reference: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Shinhwalee/Guide_to_Power_Leveling_Heavy_Cruiser_(CA)_in_World_3-2A  -Might need to level up more ships if you plan to take on medium (due to fleet locking), but you could do medium on other maps and just switch to easy on maps with fleet lock.  -If you have some times left after getting you CAs up, leveling Makigumo, Nowaki, and Urakaze to Kai will net you some more sonars, just in case there's a submarine map in the event (e.g. E-1 of last event). You might need to unlock 4-3 to do so, as doing 1-5 at HQ lv 80 might not be very efficient due to the troll sub on 1st node."
kancolle,3e3h7e,Phantasima,11,Tue Jul 21 17:48:24 2015 UTC,Whoever you like and enjoy using are the best ships.
kancolle,3e3h7e,acidtreat101,4,Tue Jul 21 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"At your level, it doesn't matter so much right now. Focus on unlocking quests and completing them and unlock maps to 2-4 or to 3-2. Save Mutsuki class destroyers for expeditions since they don't hog as much resources as rest of DDs, the difference isn't really big but definetely worth it for beginners who might struggle with lack of resources.  KanColle Wikia has good resources on nearly everything, including chart comparing ships stats.  Here is a list of ships sorted by their class and their maxed stats."

kancolle,3e3h7e,firstgunman,5,Tue Jul 21 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"As a general rule of thumb, higher stats are better and ships that have a 'kai ni' version will have higher stat caps than their peers.  The 'kai ni' rule is often violated, but it's a good starting point if you're completely clueless about who to get/level.  In actuality, it's best to think of each ship as tools in a toolbox - from which you'll choose the best combination based on the problem (read:map) you're trying to overcome. Sometimes, those puny destroyers will rock your world.  This is all building up, of course, to the undisputed 'best ship' in KanColle. Who is 'best ship'? You'll know it when you see her, hear her, experience her. She'll be the one you want to lvl 99 quickest, and then put a ring on. That is the only way to determine who 'best ship' is. Anything else is just tossing numbers."

kancolle,3e193v,SLICESLICE,3,Tue Jul 21 04:31:05 2015 UTC,"To be brutally honest,  you can do the event at medium at best with the early maps (E1,2,3) at hard.   I say this because once ship locking and combined fleet comes into play,  quite a bit of your ships are underlevelled and will most likely get one shotted by the BB and Aircraft princess.   Secondly,  your buckets are lacking quite a bit,  I find 400 to be ok with ~600 to be safe."
kancolle,3e193v,MasterMirage,3,Tue Jul 21 06:00:59 2015 UTC,I think you are both under levelled and not diverse enough for hard. Hard needs some pretty high levels (80+ is recommended) and also you need to have a lot of ships at that level. A single map on hard can lock out 12 ships in a combined fleet and from the looks of your level spread you'll run out of options to beat the next maps on hard and definitely need to drop down to medium if not easy (depending on the severity of the maps). You can probably pull off a solid medium but I'm not sure you can still reach hard at this point because you won't have the resources to train and still do hard.
kancolle,3e193v,Noperative,2,Tue Jul 21 06:31:09 2015 UTC,"Too less ships that have enough level for hard, not enough buckets for hard either. BTW you have so less DD Kai Ni... consider going to 1-5? powerlevel at 3-2now sems impossible with the amount of CA and BB you lack...."
kancolle,3e193v,--Jin--,0,Tue Jul 21 06:44:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies guys.  Sounds like it may be a medium event for me, but I guess we will see.  I mean, there isn't much reward for clearing on Hard compared to medium, so that's not so bad.  Working on getting my BP for Fusou KN in the meantime.    At least I can still farm for some ships I want from the event.  Holding my breath Unryuu and U-511 are in it."
kancolle,3dyz71,Ladycardboard,5,Mon Jul 20 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"I would wait until the event starts to decide who to use it on, that is what I am doing atleast"

kancolle,3dyz71,Atear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:25 2015 UTC,Chikuma would be better. CAVs are useful all around and not just for events.
kancolle,3dyz71,ekinetikz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"If you have decently levelled CAVs like Suzuya,  Kumano and Mogami,  I recommend Fusou.   Reason being is that the prototype 41 cm gun she comes with is really damn core when combined fleet is used (due to accuracy penalty)  and her Zuiun is a damn good observer plane."
kancolle,3dyz71,MasterMirage,0,Tue Jul 21 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"If you're aiming for medium/hard+, I'd say chikuma. Littorio is not worth it for you at this point. Also, fusou at 69 is around 2/3 of the way to k2 for experience."
kancolle,3dyz71,kingofquackz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:46 2015 UTC,"Fusou at 69 is still closer to Kai Ni than Chikuma at 38. To get from 38 to 70 you'll need around 195k exp, while to get from 69 to 80 you'll need around 128k exp."
kancolle,3dyz71,Leverno,0,Mon Jul 20 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"Yea, I know she is. Was just pointing out that fusou is not THAT close to k2. I still think chikuma k2 is worth the grind."
kancolle,3dyz71,kingofquackz,0,Mon Jul 20 19:03:51 2015 UTC,My plan is Abukuma for spatz :D or Littorio -> Italia for her summer art (or wait for event to end and you'll have enough medals again for another blueprint)
kancolle,3dyz71,_tickles,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:49:12 2015 UTC,Either Chikuma or Abukuma. I'd choose ABKM at your place but you might want to wait till event starts to decide who'd be more useful for you. You'll need both anyway and Choukai next. Fusou/Yamashiro and especially Littorio are low on the priority list.
kancolle,3dyz71,AlmaElma,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say Choukai is lower on the priority list than Fusou class. While her stats may be very good, there's other CAs and CAVs that do the job just fine and she's not that much better."
kancolle,3dyz71,ThePham,0,Mon Jul 20 21:41:03 2015 UTC,Well CA generally see more use than BBV. And she brings skilled lookouts with her which are also good.
kancolle,3dx1xr,Jifaru,6,Mon Jul 20 06:24:01 2015 UTC,"I did some basic math today and put this together. The accuracy of this data depends on a few assumptions:    Data from JP indicates that small/medium-caliber guns and AP shells contribute to FP a ratio of √✭ and Accuracy at a rate of √4✭, and large-caliber guns contribute to FP at a ratio of √2✭ and Accuracy at a rate of √4✭.  Stats gained from ✭'s are continuous and floored during damage calculation. In other words, fractional values from different pieces of equipment can result in additional FP/ACC gains. This data is relevant in Parallel (doukousen) engagement. Other engagement multipliers as well as daytime capping will affect the actual gain per ✭, but is also exceedingly difficult to account.   I will be updating data here: http://www.himeuta.net/f5-kancolle-discussion/akashi-depth-upgrade-theorycraft-6976.html at least until I am satisfied with the quality of my Google Docs spreadsheet. In the meantime, this will serve as a hub for ongoing theorycrafting projects including radar LoS/Acc spading. If any of you are willing to help me out with this project, I would be very grateful, as the methodology is fairly time consuming for one person to carry out.  Conflicting data from JP sources is welcome, as I want to make this as accurate as possible. Asking me to prove the validity of the JP test data is, unfortunately, beyond the scope of what I can.  CORRECTIONS: -381mm on Bismarck may be a ∆ since the guns come with -ACC."

kancolle,3dx1xr,cleeezzz,3,Mon Jul 20 07:37:41 2015 UTC,"Probably an accuracy penalty between fit (O) and unfit (X), so a slight acc penalty. That's what it means on the jp wiki."

kancolle,3dx1xr,Admiral_Mikan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:01 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, so I guess Yamato-class should use 51cm proto + 41cm proto than 2x 46cm?"
kancolle,3dx1xr,HiroariStrangebird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:30:34 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit strange that Yamato's historical 46cms give a slight penalty, but that's how it is right now. Also, 51cms actually do not overload Nagatos either, and if that is an oversight by the developers, it might get changed out of the blue. In my opinion, accuracy especially is a premium on Yamatos since you already go over the FP softcap by so much."
kancolle,3dx1xr,Admiral_Mikan,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:33 2015 UTC,"51cms actually do not overload Nagatos either, and if that is an oversight by the developers, it might get changed out of the blue.   It might not be an oversight. The 46cm is a triple gun mount, which would likely be overall bulkier and heavier than the 51cm twin gun mount due to the extra gun."
kancolle,3dx1xr,CruzSchiffer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"So, based on the report, what's the best combination for Yamato-class then?  I have both of them, and already prepare them to be ready for E-6"
kancolle,3dx1xr,Blasterion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"I want to avoid drawing too many conclusions for other people, especially because single-fleet, surface combined fleet, and kidou butai all have different mechanics, but I personally prefer 51cm + upgraded 41cm in single-fleet maps, and two upgraded 41cms in surface combined fleet. Prototype 41/46s should be used on support fleets since Akashi upgrades do not work for support, and overload penalties also do not seem to apply.  Overall, I want this resource to help people decide whether or not they should pursue a certain upgrade due to the steep resources, rather than to come out with a ""best setup."" The answer usually isn't straightforward because it depends on the situation and what the player has."
kancolle,3dx1xr,madharuhi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"Welp I accidentally upgraded my 35.6cm from +9 to max few weeks ago (I usually just use +9 as a general guideline). I guess with a +6 AP shell, the extra screws aren't wasted."
kancolle,3e1j9a,marijanna,14,Tue Jul 21 06:19:16 2015 UTC,Treat your girls with respect! Sink the enemy! Don't sortie with a ship in red!
kancolle,3e1j9a,TheWala,7,Tue Jul 21 07:05:07 2015 UTC,"Do your quests as much as possible early on, frees up ship slots asap and nets you lots of extra resource Crafting is a bit of a trap, usually the farther your progress in the maps the better ships you can get. Crafting gets you to those maps faster but then you waste the better drops since you have the ships already. Day Battle and Night Battle are the same battle. When a shipgirl is heavily damaged in a day battle you can safely proceed to night battle without danger of sinking. Going to the next 'node' will sink her though. It is not a proper set-up to put main guns and torpedoes together, it is a huge noobtrap because a lot of ships come with a torpedo and a gun equipped. Look up Artillery Spotting, Air Superiority and Night Battle set-ups because they are all ways to get more damage. You don't need to know them now, but by the time you get an aircraft carrier you will need to know these concepts.   Himeuta and Kancolle wiki both have beginner guides and supplements that will teach you all the basics.  Often the wiki or past threads (here or himeuta) have all the answers to your questions. If you ask questions that are too common you're just going to get short direct answers that solve that problem but won't help you deal with the next. A ttk can't just take orders, he needs to do his own thinking to manage his girls.  Speaking of which, you should make sure you are thinking properly about your own problems because we're not going to be able to play this game for you. You're free to post questions (the stickied discussion thread is recommended because these are usually going to be one-off questions) but often if you don't put your own thinking into it then you'll get like one or two acceptable answers and everyone else will go like 'yeah that answer is good enough I'm not gonna post lol'. Usually this is because people will ask general questions like 'how do I get x shipgirl' or 'what should I do now?'(my personal favourite). Personally I think a good question motivates me to write good answers because you know they're already thinking hard but they want your opinion not just the boring exact answer that everyone agrees with ('I came up with 3 plans to accomplish my goal, what are your thoughts on the best option for me?').  Good luck!"

Seems like such a lofty goal I know, but I won't give up!  Seriously though, don't push them too hard. When you see that their morale is pretty bad(red smiley faces), let them rest for a while.  Also, as you start getting more resources, try to get battleships and carriers as they will help you quite a bit in the early maps(and through the next worlds as well)  Also, keep in mind that your secretary ship will get the majority of the EXP, so spread it around your girls otherwise you will end up with lots of underleved girls.  Oh, and make sure to take advantage of the PvP as it's a great way to get EXP and make your girls sparkle!"

I'm jealous of my former squaddie who plays too who got freakin' Kaga on his first try at construction and I always keep getting light carriers whenever I try for her!  I just need a hundred dev mats and a lot more baux and I will try again!  Hell, I'd be happy even getting Musashi, Mutsu, or Nagato as well.  My secretary ship for the longest while until I got Kongou was Atago.  Such a little flirt!  I-18 is much more flirty, but I need to keep running 1-5 and get to the boss node until I get her.

kancolle,3dzpli,AdmiralScooter,3,Mon Jul 20 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"To get to the point, based on what you listed, the most feasible difficulty you can attempt would be Easy-Medium, especially if there's fleet locking involved.   For starters, your ship levels are rather disproportionate. You have a high-leveled CLT (Kiso) and a single high-leveled ship from each class: Maya (CA), Mogami (CAV), Hiei (BB) and Zuikaku (CV). It's almost as though you have exclusively used these ships for sorties. Unfortunately, a single high-leveled ship won't take you far, not even on Medium. You need a diverse fleet with around 4-6 from each class with balanced levels. For Medium, it would be good if your ships are around Level 50-60. Apart from Samidare, your DD levels are slightly low for Medium. Yuudachi and Ushio are not far from their Kai Ni. It's worth, especially the former, to level them to that for Medium. Your CL levels are Easy at best. Noshiro is a decent CL, you can afford to level her further. Yuubari is also a good investment with her 4 slots but note that she cannot equip a recon plane.  CAs might struggle a bit on Medium. Thanks to Mogami, your CAVs are decent for Medium. BBs are good for Medium.  One leveled CVL is not sufficient. At least two would be good. CVs are fine for Medium. Equipment-wise, you have a good Reppuu and Shiden Kai 2 count, well plane count in general for Medium. AP Shell count is decent for Medium. Sonars (what about Depth Charges) are insufficient, even for Easy. You should have at least 4 sets.  Resources are sufficient for Medium."
kancolle,3dzpli,Tomaranai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:27 2015 UTC,"Looking at the list I forgot to list my 2 Type 94 Sonars, 2 Type 3 DCs, and 10 Type 93 DCs.

kancolle,3dzpli,MasterMirage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:13 2015 UTC,Do 3-2a farming with Yuudachi as your FS and you should be fine in all honesty.  Your resources are more than enough to compensate grinding it out before the event.

As for actually making the purchases, you should log into the DMM site via region cookie (this method can be found on the Wikia).

It's technically Flash's memory leak, but KCV exacerbates it with how it interacts with the game window. Don't leave it running for extended periods of time.  You don't need a VPN to use KCV, as it edits the region code in your cookie to ""trick"" the browser into thinking you're accessing from Japan.  You can't use KCV to purchase. That has to be done directly in browser. Though, good thing about that is that you can use IE without any extra effort, as KCV will have already modified the cookie to accept your traffic.

kancolle,3dz94f,Fuuko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:07 2015 UTC,thanks!
kancolle,3dz94f,konbe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:57 2015 UTC,Development. Check your HQ first before you craft.
kancolle,3dz94f,Tomaranai,0,Mon Jul 20 19:38:55 2015 UTC,what do you mean?
kancolle,3dz94f,Lenfried,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"Your HQ level affects the success rate of equipment crafting. For example, when crafting planes, it's best if your HQ level is 30 and above. Another factor to take note of is your flagship. Make sure you have a CV(L) as flagship when crafting planes.  The best recipe to use is 20/60/10/110 until you get a Saiun (helps to prevent T-Cross disadvantage) and then swap to 20/60/10/100 to get Fighters/Dive Bombers/Torpedo Bombers."

kancolle,3dwa0f,Sarge166,3,Mon Jul 20 03:20:22 2015 UTC,"According to his latest update, he lost Souryuu.  Well at least fate has managed to bring her back to OP once again as consolation, though running 2-4 with 1 CV is really kuso when you can hardly get AS in certain maps.  And to my fellow TTK /u/ZeonTwoSix:   Patience, my friend. There's no point taking chances that may ultimately lead to regret. Just patch 'em up, and try again another time.   Also, just my humble advice for ye - don't use only 1 CV for 2-4. Not only you lose the ability for artillery spotting due to not obtaining Air Superiority (AS), the chances of your fleet getting heavily damaged from Air Denial (AD) is higher, if your equipment loadout for your CV is poorly done.  A minimum 133 AA is required for Air Superiority (AS), and minimum of 65 AA is required for Air Parity (AP), with at least 10 AA buffer loss.  Anyways, 3-2 awaits you to get your CV back to level.  Regards,  From a fellow TTK who cleared 2-4 the first time with 4 x BB and 2 x CV while rushing his damned assignments at the same time."

kancolle,3duk6b,boreslayer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:29 2015 UTC,You could probably do hard for a couple maps then drop to medium. I would probably just stick with medium though. You need a very diverse fleet for hard.  Before the event you should probably level more CAs since you only have three that are decently leveled. I would also get a few more levels on the Yuudachi and Fubuki. If you have Shimakaze and Yukikaze then you should also level them to 60-70. Kai Ni your Souryuu and get the Suisei Egusa.  Your fighters are fine but how are your bombers? You should try to get a few more AP shells so you have enough to use on 4 or 5 BB at a time. I would also get a few more Sanshiki just to be safe.
kancolle,3duk6b,HydraGoliath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Medium-Hard seems plausible. While your CVs and BBs are decently leveled for Hard, your DDs, CA(V)s and CLTs at their present state are slightly under-leveled, Medium at best. If there's fleet locking, you might be stretched with your current line up and Medium is probably what you're best suited for at the moment.   Should you want to attempt Hard or simply looking for further preparation suggestions, it would be good to...    Get at least 5-6 DDs to level 70. From your list, work on Fubuki, Shigure and Yuudachi. They're not too far from 70. Getting Fubuki to Kai Ni will be very useful for AACI purposes, especially if you have Akashi. Get another CAV. It's great that you have Tone Kai Ni, but 2 CAVs would be good to have. Mogami would be a good choice, since she's readily available and remodels early. or Suzuya and Kumano if you have them. Train more CAs, preferable another 2-3 more. CAs are essential in events. At the moment, you only have Haguro and Choukai (not counting Tone), and the latter is under-leveled, even for Medium. The Myoukou sisters are good choices. Time is limited but you should be able to get them to a decent level. Note that you can still level ships during the event. That was something I actually did in the last event, as I wanted to take the easier Suzuya + Kumano route for E-5 then. Your CL (Sendai) and CLTs are good for Medium. Hard would require them to be at a higher level. Get another CVL and Kai Ni Junýou if possible. At least 2 CVLs, even for Medium, would be good to have should there combined fleet. Get more Type 3 Shells and AP Shells. The former is incredibly important for installation bosses and the latter for high armoured enemies.  Other important equipment to take note of: ASW (Sonar + Depth Charge), Dive Bombers and Torpedo Bombers. You'll need at least 4 ASW sets and Suisei, Ryuusei for Medium and above.  There's also the issue of resources. Different difficulties will require different quantities and should you want to farm maps for drops, you'll need a healthy amount of resources. Even if your ships are prepared, if you have insufficient resources to support and sortie your ships, the question of difficulty goes out of the window."

kancolle,3dsu78,Miickohira,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:39 2015 UTC,In terms of ships everything but carriers looks great. With only 5 CV and 4CVL if there is fleeting locking on multiple combined fleet maps then it might become an issue. The lack of a second pair of CAV might get you into trouble with fleet locking but it will probably just be a pathing advantage. Resources looks ok for medium i would get more bauxite just in case. Equipment also looks good.   Since you don't have that much of a selection of CV and CAV i would say you should wait for a few days for data on fleet locking maps before trying to clear them. You might even be able to clear hard if you had more resources.
kancolle,3dsu78,nekonight,2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say that 5 CV is already a pretty good number. The game only has 10 CV in total, with 3 of them being event ships and 1 being LSC. The amount of CVLs could be a bit higher though. Ryuujou, Houshou and Shouhou are fairly common drops, as far as I can tell."
kancolle,3dsu78,Leverno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:00 2015 UTC,that is also my problem.. dont have enough cv/l and cav. yeah.. ill wait for the data before clearing a map. the locking maps will be tough for me. but.. the struggle and effort will make the event more fun! lol  I still have 2 weeks of farming before aug.. so ill farm until the event starts. ill sparkle all of my expedition babes today.
kancolle,3dsu78,chasieubau,3,Sun Jul 19 04:00:03 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you seem fine, while you're not completely out of the woods in terms of getting shiplocked for carriers, I think that's a reasonable number of CV(L)s. One pair of CAV is the bare minimum but I don't have to tell you that.  I think if you get your resources up to 40k - 50k you'll be pretty good for clearing on medium (bauxite excluded, maybe around 25k depending on how carrier-heavy this event is), if you wanna go hard I keep hearing that you should have upwards of 80k or 100k in everything (except bauxite, again depending on carrier involvement).  Also, because of how difficulties get locked when you clear a map completely, you won't be able to farm on hard if you beat that map on medium/easy (unless you change the difficulty before the clear to reset the bar), so waiting a few days for drop data might help you plan your approach."
kancolle,3dsu78,HydraGoliath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:08:57 2015 UTC,I'd say go with medium for the first few maps and possibly drop to easy for if they start to get too difficult.
kancolle,3dsu78,kingofquackz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:50:06 2015 UTC,"Without ship locking, you should barely be able to clear on hard, though trying to farm may be hard because of the state of your resources. If there's ship locking you'll have to do medium"
kancolle,3dsu78,senaya,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"Strange question, considering we don't even know which enemies we are going to meet there. In general, just wait a few days after the start of event until wiki gets filled with information and best compositions for each map and then try the hardest diff possible, only downgrade it if you are sure it's not doable for you."
kancolle,3dsu78,itsrandomusername,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"You should be able to do Medium for the first few maps.  If it's getting too hard, switch to easy. No shame in doing that.  If shiplocking becomes a thing, you'll probably have to switch to easy either way seeing how you don't have many good CAs / CV(L)s.   Go for medium this time, level them up a bit afterwards and move on to hard in the next event."
kancolle,3dsu78,Leverno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"In what way does Miickohira not have many good CV(L)s? In terms of CV, the list of ships is only missing Shoukaku and Taihou, who would be certainly be good additions, but the other 3 missing CVs are event ships which you cannot aquire at the moment and require a blueprint to be considered ""good"".  In terms of CVL, the amount of ships could definitely be higher, but the CVLs that Miickohira already has are already the best ones in terms of stats and plane count. Ryuujou, Houshou and Shouhou are fairly common drops and could certainly boost the number of available CVLs, but they are rather average stats-wise.  (I suppose you could try to grind up additional copies of existing ships to get around the issue that there aren't that many different good CV/CVLs)"
kancolle,3dsu78,itsrandomusername,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"3-4 event ready CVs aren't really enough if shiplocking happens again.  Unless you go full surface task force, that is."
kancolle,3dsu78,Leverno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"That is true, though you can try to pad it out with a couple of CVLs.  5 CV + 4 CVL might just be enough for running 2 carrier task forces and one regular map with one CV."

It's simple math.  5-5 require good ships, very high level, good equipment (11 reppuu good luck crafting) and luck whenever you see the torp from Re. That's the maximum requirement for this game.   Tbh I don't even want to think about 6-5, given 5-5 could already rekt LSC fleet.  That said, there were this dude that did 5-5 S rank with 1CL 5DD lol"
kancolle,3dsx9d,Moesugi,-6,Sun Jul 19 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"6-5: Requires taigei, 2 Av, akitsumaru, 1 dd, 1 ss to get to boss. Boss has 2 re elite escort and aimbot princess as boss."
kancolle,3dsx9d,kingofquackz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:48:44 2015 UTC,"They are roughly in ascending order. Uo to 4-5 is doable with event-level fleets, 5-5 is pretty impossible until like level 90+ ships."
kancolle,3dsx9d,Noperative,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:47:23 2015 UTC,5-5 is pretty impossible until like level 90+ ships.   It might need more attempts if the level of your ships isn't high. But it's definitely not impossible. http://i.imgur.com/ylUZnZA.png
kancolle,3dsx9d,StoneFlame,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:59:00 2015 UTC,How many tries it took you to clear it?
kancolle,3dsx9d,senaya,2,Sun Jul 19 12:47:45 2015 UTC,14 tries with 18 sparkled ships.
kancolle,3dsx9d,StoneFlame,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"Personally for me, 5>>4=3>>2>1  3-5's and 4-5's positions depend on my luck for the month. Probably straight up 4>3 now with Abukuma but I'll only be able to test out next month (not intending to throw away resources for nothing lol)."
kancolle,3dsx9d,madharuhi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:07:55 2015 UTC,3-5 is good because it requires a light fleet so even with a lot of unsuccesful runs it's barely noticeable. And with ABKM it's now miles easier if you are lucky. 4-5 on the other hand made an event-like dent in my resources last time I cleared it.
kancolle,3dsx9d,AlmaElma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:03:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about the 4 main resources, but it irks me whenever I have to use buckets on DDs or CLs (the main reason why E-1 farming last season annoyed me so much even though it wasn't hard).   Personally I haven't had problems with 4-5 yet (around 4k to 5k fuel/ammo spent for each month), but I wouldn't know until I run into the problems with it and see it for myself since it could be plain dumb luck."

kancolle,3drvff,xHaruNatsu,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"Just skimming your link, you could probably clear the event on medium/easy, probably the first one or two maps on hard.  I don't really know what to say other than that. You're a little weak on the CA side (not to mention the CAVs) but I'm sure you realize that, and if there is ship-locking you might find yourself in a pickle.  Equipment-wise, more Reppuu, more Shiden Kai Ni, maybe a couple of more offensive (red/blue) planes. A few depth charges and a few SONARs. I assume from your Night Scout recon plane that you have a searchlight and a star shell, and AP shells and Type 3 shells for installation bosses."
kancolle,3drvff,chasieubau,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'm working on leveling up some CAs right now and as for CAVs, I don't have blueprints for the Tone-class right now, so do you have any suggestion on which Mogami-class ship I should focus on?  As for my equipments, I think I only got lucky with the Reppuu drops, but I think I can spare some resources on some more. I do have searchlights and some star shells, but I don't have any AP shless and only 1 Type 3 shell."
kancolle,3drvff,chasieubau,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"After reading what the others have said, I pretty much agree. I believe it might be a bit too late to get more than one or two CAs to Kai Ni.  What I might suggest is leveling up Haguro (since you've already decided on her) to Kai at the very least, and then immediately swap to Mogami and Kumano to get them to CAV for the bare minimum of branching purposes. Then using whatever time you have left to push all of your CA's (other than Maya's) levels further. You should be fine on destroyers, light cruisers you might want to push Ooi to 50 for Kai Ni and Jintsuu to 60 for her Kai Ni. Carrier-wise, Kaga as high as possible, and IF there's time, Ryuujou as far as possible. You look good in terms of battleships but consider modernizing Haruna and Hyuuga to max, maybe put some levels into Hyuuga a bit.  Shiden Kai Ni's are perfectly fine if you can't consistently get Reppuu, and you only need enough for 2 carriers since you can just move equipment around onto different ships. You should try getting more AP/Type 3's though, since installation bosses are a huge pain without them.  I forgot to mention resources but if everything else is ignored, you could probably clear the event with that amount of resources but you should try to aim for a number above 50k in each resource except bauxite if you wish to farm for ships after. I do expeditions 5/9/21 for fuel and ammo, 2 for buckets (it also comes with some ammo and steel), 3 for steel, and 6 for bauxite. Orel cruising is obviously also a viable option as is 3-2 sub farming for steel."
kancolle,3drvff,chasieubau,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:03:07 2015 UTC,"The event will start early August, right? I think I got more than enough time to level up Haguro and I'm bringing along Mogami and Kaga on my runs so they can gain some levels. Once Haruna gets to Kai Ni(pretty soon, probably tomorrow if I don't get lazy) I'll replace her with Hyuuga so I can still get the 2nd shelling phase.  How many Reppuus should I try and craft? Seeing as you've said ""enough for 2 carriers"", around 3 or 4 more should be enough? I'll definitely try and get more AP/Type 3 shells.  Getting above 50k wouldn't be a problem for me if the event is still 2-3 weeks away. I'll just spend a week doing nothing but orel and spamming expeditions. Is 290 buckets enough or should I get more?  Sorry for bombarding you again with more question, but your last comment has helped me quite a lot(along with the others who commented). Thank you very much for all the help!"
kancolle,3drvff,chasieubau,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"I believe it is early August, yeah. If you think you can get the levels by then, go ahead, I was just assuming potential life stuff like a full time job or maybe even kids or volunteering etc.  Well the Reppuu/Shiden Kai Ni thing is just an approximation since USUALLY only 2 carriers are required at a time, 3 or 4 is probably fine.  More resources the better, especially if you plan to farm maps. People say you should have 75k or more if you want to really farm for event-only drops. Buckets-wise 290 is probably fine for clearing and probably farming, but again, more the better, I can't really give you a number for this but I aim for about 500 buckets for events since I don't really use too many when leveling at 3-2 or 4-1.  No problem, I wouldn't have posted if I didn't want to help. :P"
kancolle,3drvff,Asagizuki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"I've got a lot of free time and studying for midterms is the only thing hindering me from playing all day.  I think steel is the only resource that I'll be able to get to 75k, but I'll try to get as much resources as possible. I do hope 290 is a safe amount, but if it isn't, I'll just use them wisely.  Thank you for all the help! This will be enough, I think. I've got all the info I needed to prepare for the upcoming event. Again, thank you very much!"
kancolle,3drvff,Asagizuki,2,Mon Jul 20 09:21:08 2015 UTC,"Good luck on those midterms then!  If it helps at all, when I'm awake I tend to do expeditions 2/3/6 for buckets, steel, and bauxite to complete my daily expedition quests, then 2/3/21 for buckets, steel, and fuel+ammo. When going to sleep or doing something else for presumably more than 4 hours I do expeditions 5/9/21 which will net you almost 700-800 fuel after refueling, and about 400-500 ammo."
kancolle,3drvff,Ryuuaza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:57:35 2015 UTC,I'll make a note out of your expedition schedule then :)  And thanks for the kind words!
kancolle,3drvff,Sapaa,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:10 2015 UTC,"You can probably clear easy, but lack of level would be a bit problematic. Example is your CA (specially CAV), you shouldn't focus on only one ship, at least try to level up other even on decent level without Kai ni'ing them yet. Having no CAV would be a problem too, since some of the event maps requires them.  On the other hand, I'd recommend you to level up Kaga at least. She's gonna help you so much on high AS battles, and the Reppuus you got is quite handy for her.  Try to level up other ship type you are lacking and you are ready to face Easy, or challenge Medium too!"
kancolle,3drvff,Sapaa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"Which Mogami-class CAV would you recommend?

kancolle,3dratr,TriDarkSouls,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"well it really depends on how hard the event is...  Last event was really easy, but lets assume the next one is really hard, like midway hard, you could need anywhere between a 100k and 200k resources, especially since you dont really have that many high level ships and that ship locks might really screw you over."
kancolle,3dratr,Adatia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:55:38 2015 UTC,I had to level ships during last event to get through Ship locking but I've vastly expanded my roster since then so unless they make another ridiculous shiplock like AL/MI I think I should be ok?
kancolle,3dratr,Adatia,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"you ships will be fine (proberbly), but you will spend more resources when you are forced to use the lower level ones.  but theres also the off chance that it will be harder than midway.  in all fairness if the event is god awful ""you will die"" extreme mode you should proberbly tier down on the EO's and if thats the case you should be fine with 70-80k and the 20k you will get from regen during the week you have and finish with plenty to spare."
kancolle,3dratr,Asagizuki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Actually your ship girls can already face Hard diff, but still lacking of levels on CA (specially CAV) though. About the resources, its always be depends on how hard the event is and how RNG is gonna troll you. Last event wasnt relatively hard, but I got a feeling that this upcoming Event will be different and harder. Since you're gonna rush the event, lets say around 100-150k would be enough for clearing, but hunting ship after would be needing more resources. If you only focusing on stockpiling right now, probably 2-3 weeks would be enough to reach that ideal resources in no time!"
kancolle,3dratr,GoldenCrater,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:10 2015 UTC,More than anything else you should put effort into getting Akashi. Upgraded guns make a world of difference and you'll want as many +6 BB guns as you can get.

On vacation from 5th August for 3 weeks, if I'm lucky I'll get to do the event for the first few days and if I'm not, I'll probably miss out the event entirely."

kancolle,3dox4d,duki512,2,Sat Jul 18 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"The idea is to have the flagship always get mvp so it wont get fatigued. As for CV, they are not affected much as opeming airstrike is not affect by morale but dont equip them with your best equipment as you dont want them dealing too much dmg and your flagship becomes unable to get mvp. On average the airstrike should take down 2-3 ships, your flagship will take down 2 95% of the time, leaving with 0-1 depending on enemy formation to deal with. To miss all 10 shots at it is kind of abyssmal but if that happens just go night battle. Equiping ships you are not focusing on with equips which give accuracy would help with this, even cv can equip yellow 15.5 guns. If you still need help you can search for 'Death Usagi' on youtube and the channel has a bunch of useful resources on leveling ships"
kancolle,3dox4d,KongouHaruna,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I actually have all ships that i kind of level so its not bad. Taihou as flagship at 44, since I really want her higher, chikuma and tone at lvl 10, who are my 2nd priority, decchi whos my tank 53, and soryuu and hiryuu both at 65 who im trying to kai 2.  If decchi is red and takes damage, as long as shes not mid damage, she wont sink right?"
kancolle,3dox4d,LacusClyne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"If decchi is red and takes damage, as long as shes not mid damage, she wont sink right?   what do you mean? If red damage is critical damage and will sink if you start another sortie without repairing, anything else and it's fine. It's ok mid sortie to get to red and go night battle but not to start another sortie.  Red damage is worse than 'Mid' damage."
kancolle,3dox4d,happyh0rse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:46 2015 UTC,Right I was wondering if there was chance for her sinking if shes red fatigued with 小破(light damage)
kancolle,3dox4d,LacusClyne,2,Sat Jul 18 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"No. Please don't get mixed up with 0 fatigue (red emote) and taiha (大破 red text).  Only major damaged (大破) shippus will have a chance to sink if you start a brand new sortie. Shippus with red fatigue (but not taiha'd) will not sink, though they will suffer from fatigue penalities.  Check the wiki if you're unsure. Thanks."
kancolle,3dox4d,Dizzyworld2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"ah fatigued. No there is no chance, the only thing that matters with sinking is if she's red damage and you start another sortie."
kancolle,3dox4d,Dizzyworld2,2,Sat Jul 18 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Shinhwalee/Guide_to_Power_Leveling_Heavy_Cruiser_%28CA%29_in_World_3-2A explains it quite well.  I personally use FS/BB or CA/3 CV(L)/SS with this setup: https://imgur.com/a/wl1Uh  The FS is typically a CA. You want to have at least 1 BB in your fleet for the 2nd shelling phase.  You can easily ignore morale with this method. I can run this 5-6 times in a row before I need to switch subs. If you find your non-FS ships stealing MVP, replace the FS with a spare ship and do a few runs until their morale's red. Replace spare ship with the ship you want to level."
kancolle,3dox4d,Noperative,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! This shud help greatly. Except for cv's, why do you use dive bombers on the lowest plane slots? are preemptive strikes not affected by my slot of planes? Also is a BB needed? And for my submarine, shes kai so she has 2 slots, should i use 2 mini subs, or 1 mini sub and an engine, or 2 engine?"
kancolle,3dox4d,yamfun,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"No problem, anything to help a fellow TTK!  I put them at the lowest slots since the CV(L)s tend to easily steal MVP. I'm not sure if it's dependent on slot though.  BB is a must to have the second shelling phase.  For your SS, I suggest engines since the extra evasion helps them last a few battles longer before getting red. If you don't have them, it's perfectly fine to use mini sub/torpedoes."
kancolle,3dox4d,yamfun,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:59:27 2015 UTC,"You want to do enough damage with the CV to take out ships with the bare minimum damage. Dive bombers have the most consistent damage for the opening phase and it only takes the lowest slots to deal just enough damage to kill off a few CL and DD. If you out them in the higher slots they would deal too much damage.   BB are required because the prime levelling target is CA which don't always get enough damage for MVP in just one shelling phase, getting 2 shelling phases increase the chance that the CA can get MVP. If your only sub is a kai'd sub then grinding at 3-2 is actually quite a bother, most of the time I do rotations of fresh <20 subs and just grind out like 100 runs in a day to powerlevel something."
kancolle,3dox4d,nekonight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:09:11 2015 UTC,"The whole point of 3-2-1 is that the accompanying ships can be totally fatigued.  The easiest setup is to spam CV/CVL but If you have enough +accuracy items, even something like CA BB CVL CA CL SS would work."
kancolle,3dox4d,nekonight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I have a lot of cvs i can use, but I kind of want to save time and level 2 ca's at the same time. I posted on my op my current fleet. Do I really need a bb?"
kancolle,3dox4d,nekonight,2,Sat Jul 18 02:52:54 2015 UTC,"People put 1 BB in there to get the 2nd shelling phase. The 2nd shelling phase is important to some formations because fatigued ships miss a lot in non-airstrike phase and you need the 2nd phase so as to clear every enemy ships in time, otherwise, you reach the torpedo phase, which is deadly for your fatigued ships. Being able to save on bucket is one of the advantage of 3-2, so getting damaged in the torpedo phase would make the whole thing meaningless.  If you are spamming CVs, you might be able to clear them pretty early because of the air strike phase, so you might not need the insurance of the 2nd shelling phase.  Sooooo it depends on what you are training along and you need to observe how early can you clear the enemies to decide whether you need it."
kancolle,3dox4d,nekonight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:02:47 2015 UTC,Usually i use 1CV 1BB 2CA 1sub and the ship i want to level in flagship position (usually another CA). I usually keep another CV and 2CA ready to switch in when the ones in the fleet drop to 30ish fatigued but before the fatigued face shows up. I also strip all the equipment off of the BB and try to run her down to red fatigued otherwise she will tend to steal MVP all the time. And i take off the seaplane off everyone but the flagship so they cant double attack.
kancolle,3dox4d,brianjgines,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:51:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for your suggestion. What exactly is the point of the bb?
kancolle,3dox4d,wiltheavatar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:38 2015 UTC,With that setup i use i am trying to have the flagship CA get MVP every sortie. However it means i am crippling the initial air strike and the other ships. To make sure it doesn't get to the torpedo phase I take the BB to get the second shelling phase.
kancolle,3dox4d,madharuhi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:06:59 2015 UTC,What's like the best equipment to put on a bb? I saw some images of people putting all radars on one.
kancolle,3dox4d,Spheroidal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:36 2015 UTC,For 3-2 i strip everything off since i don't want the BB to steal mvp. She sorties with no equipment of any kind. Because even then a BB usually have equal firepower to a CA with guns. I also run down the BB's morale into red so she misses her shots.
kancolle,3dox4d,Spheroidal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"Isn't that bad if she misses her shot? I was trying it out with a bb with just radars on, but I didnt really notice like a preemptive strike or not that she does. But if she is red, is there a higher chance that she can miss something?"

And you probably have enough time to finish leveling up hibiki. I am going to assume that your DD dont usually sortie with drums like that. CL: CLT equipment is usually 2 guns instead of 2 torpedo since their luck stat isn't great. 2 Sendai class kai ni is probably enough. Try to rush ooyodo to her remodel because the fleet command equipment will save you a lot of retreats during combined fleet. CA: everything looks good. BB: if you have the extra BP remodel the Fusou sisters. Having just the kongo sisters is probably not be enough. The other possibility level Nagato. You probably dont want to level Yamato this close to the event. CV: level up for Taihou to her remodel at least. CVL looks good but you are lacking a wide selection of leveled CVs. level up Akashi to her remodel her fixing ability works wonders during the event with saving buckets and such.   Resources:   everything but bauxite looks good. If you cant get AS during the event (which you might not with your current pick of planes) you could run out of bauxite before completing it.  more buckets   I also have some concerns about the way some of them are equipped during those screenshots. You might want to read this if you are unsure how to equip them."

I should have no problem getting that equipment built and I have plenty of screws to upgrade things.  I just need to run different ships through 4-3 and 3-2a to level them.  And yeah I just have the DDs running tokyo express right now.
kancolle,3dp0qf,nekonight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"If you have to prioritize leveling I would say go with first Ooyodo, then Taihou or Yamshiro, then another BB or CV."
kancolle,3dnwxw,kingofquackz,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Well IRL the F1M2 was quite a good plane and had some aerial victories against Wildcats I think, the Ar 196 on the other hand had problems with the cylinders cracking after landing in water because of water entering the engine compartment and causing temperature differences, this is where the F1M2s single main float shone. I think you should use the Ar 196 if you want somewhat of a historical accuracy and the F1M2 if you want the better plane. Also I have only heard of overweight maulus on turrets, nothing regarding maulus or bonus for certain equipment on certain ships."
kancolle,3dnwxw,FirstDagger,2,Fri Jul 17 22:43:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was just meant as an alternative to the Type 0 Obs.

kancolle,3dojgv,F1r3br4nd22,3,Fri Jul 17 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"She's okay. You can think of Nagato-class as slightly bulkier Kongou-class BBs with a slow speed. There's not a lot of scenarios where having Nagato would give you an advantage over people who can only resort to Kongou-class, but more BBs never hurt since they're probably the most often-used class and gives you more options for fleet locking situations."
kancolle,3dojgv,madharuhi,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah she's quite rare outside of LSC. Nagato and Mutsu are very good options if you need a slow BB (maybe due to branching rules or whatever). Some K2 FBB's have better FP (like Kirishima K2) and also better resource consumption, but the Nagato class is tankier as they have more HP as well as armor (outside of the LSC ships).  The other choices for slow BB's would be BBV's, which have pretty bad FP outside of the Fusou class at K2, but they need a blueprint, and the Yamato class, which is LSC only."
kancolle,3dojgv,hyroglyphixs,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"She is a solid BB that will stay with you for long and won't ever lose relevance. All BB are good girls, so love your Nagamon.   Crafting her with a regular recipe is pretty lucky, she is mainly a byproduct of failed LSC attempts."

She also has lower consumption than Chito/Chiyo/Akitsu and can be used as a daihatsu carrier in expeditions compared to those 3.  One of the best and most versatile Kai2 we have imo."

Her firepower's pretty low anyway, giving her artillery spotting is like making a Poi/Ayanami do DAs at best.  That said, the CLTs do make the distinct difference of being to chuuha/taiha enemy battleships so there's that. I think her main charm is in the fact that you have to sortie a CL in combined fleet no matter what, and I would probably take her over other CLs in most cases unless I need the extra slot."

kancolle,3dn6uk,Atear,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:41 2015 UTC,"Few thing   Try to aim for 4 best planes in each category (Reppuu/Ryuusei Kai etc). Their weaker version work too (Shiden K2/Ryuusei), anything below will hinder your progress (Greatly, as their stat got reduced by half). This is excluding non-crafted plane 30k resources is enough for easy, 50k for medium (Just to be safe). You won't survive in hard  Get rid of those 14/7.7/12.7 gun... Do the same for those red 15.5 too.  More CV, CVL simply doesn't have enough plane slot. And you need both of them for support exp.   tbh you barely pass my ideal benchmark for medium, you might have trouble clearing med. If they have a lot of shiplocking map in this event then rip medium"
kancolle,3dn6uk,Moesugi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"First, is there a particular difficulty you are aiming towards? Although it's difficult to gauge how challenging the upcoming event is going to be, based on what you have, I would say you're good for Medium if you work on your equipment.  Ships    You have 5 decently leveled DDs, all of which are top tier DDs, which is good. They'll fare well for Medium, unless you push those DDs in the 60s up to 70-80 and then they'll be good for Hard. Your two CLTs are high-leveled and Sendai is a reasonable level for Medium-Hard. CA(V)s can be prepared further and your 2nd CAV, Mogami, needs a lot more work unless you are going to blueprint Tone. For Medium, they'll be okay but Hard might be a little challenging (in terms of levels and number of available CAs), especially if there's fleet locking. CVLs look fine with Jun'you and Hiyou but you might want to pull up the Chitose pair a bit more just in case. CVs need work. If the upcoming event is going to be carrier heavy, Hiryuu and Akagi as they are now might not be able to carry your carrier fleet. Level Kaga to match them. As for your BB(V)s, the BBs need to be leveled more evenly, especially Kongou and Mutsu. Don't neglect your BBVs. Should the event have branching rules requiring BBVs or slow BBs, you'll be in trouble. Have you been Orel Cruising a lot?   Equipment  Your current inventory is going to pose some issues.    Your Fighter department needs some resource investment. 1x Reppuu is going to restrict you, even on Medium. Try to get at least another 4x Reppuu or Shiden Kai 2 with 20/20/10/90. Oh but... Your Dive Bomber and Torpedo Bomber Squadron in particular needs help. Try to get some Suisei M12A and Ryuusei/Ryuusei Kai. Use 20/60/10/100. I would recommend better radars but right now you need to focus on getting those planes. More Depth Charges needed. At least 2 more. Use 10/30/10/10. More AP Shells needed. At least 2 more. Since you have Akashi, you can consider improving your equipment, but once again, it's best to spend your resources and dev mats on getting better planes. You have quite a bit of not so useful equipment. 12cm, 14cm, non-O2 torpedoes, Type 96, Type 21, Type 99, Type 97 (wait until you get better torp bombers for this one), AA guns should just shoo."
kancolle,3dn6uk,Tomaranai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I will have just enough medals for a bp at the start of the month after killing off 1-5 and 2-5. Enough to take care of Tone.   As for difficulty, I was planning on letting a few days go by in the event so that adequate knowledge can be gained so that I can make my difficulty choices appropriately. In other words I will most likely be attempting a mixture of hard and medium attempts, depending on what stage clear rewards end up looking like in the end.   Yeah I know my planes leave a lot to be desired. Ive been so busy since the last event with trying to get bismark and power leveling, I started Kancolle a few days before the Spring event, so havent been wanting to devote much time to crafting ships or really any other weapons.   And I not only Orel cruise non-stop, but I 3-2 Steel grind with my subs all day every day. Also, dont know if it matters, I have been running Expeditions 2, 6, and 48 for the past week or so, as I am in front of my computer at all times of the day currently.

kancolle,3dluvp,5paz,9,Fri Jul 17 09:11:50 2015 UTC,"Just copy & pasting this quote here (not from me)...   I swung from thinking ""what? she's this weak?"" to ""crap she's actually OP"". But now to ""yea....she's ok"".  Its like you say. In terms of usefulness she's basically on par with Jintsuu. Initially I thought she wasn't good until I considered the opening torpedo for maps that require a CL, like 3-5. But now I also think she's really just decent. The reason is the BP. From some point of view, it just means one month more of farming, but there's really enough ships out there needing a BP that spending a BP in order to get a new CL that will replace Jintsuu, not complement her (there's no maps that need 2 CLs)....is pretty expensive.  Sounds nice on paper basically, but in practical terms, better experience for admirals on some maps, but not by that much. We only need 1 good CL, partially because all the maps and combined fleet have been setup that way to counteract the fact that we don't have a lot of good CL options. Abukuma can be that one CL, for some admirals, on some maps, for a price of a BP. Otherwise Ooyodo has her utility and Jintsuu is still a better all-rounder, both for no blueprints though Ooyodo is rare.  And that's really on the back of that opening torpedo. With those stats alone, she's not worth a BP at all when Sendai, Naka, Nagara and Kuma are still arguably better than her in both surface day combat and night battle.   Discuss!"
kancolle,3dluvp,H8Blood,2,Fri Jul 17 09:49:26 2015 UTC,"TBH it feels like she's a luxury to have. Her K2 is very good, but better than Jintsuu maybe in only 3-5 and 6-3. It looks OP in combined fleet but tbh with her 94 torp stat (106 with Ko-hyoteki), her opening torp Light-medium damages Tsu-class and light damages enemy CA and above ourside of green T and crits. It's simply insufficient as a CLT Imo. Sure, if you hit a DD, your ships will fire at the more important targets, but most of the time the DD(s) are already dead due to support expedition. Since most of the time the boss escorts are Wo/Wa/Floating or Escort Fortress/BBs, the opening torps are pretty much scratch damage most of the time.  Maaybe she will be worth it if you modernise her luck and equip her with torp cut-in setup to make her opening salvo effective against more abyssals but tbh if you haven't remodelled, say Fusou-class, Tone-class, Choukai or Bismarck, I doubt a blueprint on her will be more worth it than a blueprint on those above ships.  On the bright side, she can be another strong CL in case of fleet locking, I guess.  TL;DR, her opening torps are too weak most of the time, and her stats are underwhelming as a normal CL. This makes her only better than Jintsuu in a very small number of maps."
kancolle,3dluvp,dasaher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:21:25 2015 UTC,I think Abukuma is worth the blueprint and she also proberbly one of the better choices for upgrading atm.  But yea shes only really stronger than Jintsu on maps where you dont have a bb and AS and dont need night battle.  She is completely broken for expeditions with daihatsu's though.
kancolle,3dluvp,Adatia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"I would put her on 3rd or 4th priority BP.(outside love>stats) 1st and 2nd still goes to Tone-class and Fusou-class as:  1. Mogami-class and Ise-class are considered ""weak"" compare to the BP ships(at least relatively) 2. There's sendai-class and other plenty of CL to cover up for the lack of CLs  On against other BP's such as choukai, unryuu-class, bismarck, it really depends on the niche but I would put her above them(or if you have 2 BP, I'd choose Bismarck).  On against the other CL's(notably jintsuu). How would opening torp + daihatsu'd CL + slight evasion (exp'd 21, 37 anyone?) would be against no BP +  good daytime shelling + slightly good HP + slight NB power(abukuma got +12 torp stats from miget). I don't have ooyodo so I can't make a comparison.  But as for me, I would use her over jintsuu as jintsuu's a huge crit magnet because of how strong opening torp is. I've seen the Chitose sunk an enemy CLT on 6-3."

Abukuma can be that one CL, for some admirals, on some maps, for a price of a BP.    Well they can always implement new mechanic for CL (Which has been neglected for more than 1 year). So saying she's expensive is really short sighted, I wouldn't be surprise if they actually do so now.  You could also say all BP ships is expensive, as they only were a ""little more"" effective than the normal ship."
kancolle,3dluvp,Moesugi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:01:42 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly waiting for Tenryuu and Tatsuta Kai Ni able to substitute a DD whenever one is required, as their intended role was to be the flagship for destroyer divisions."
kancolle,3dluvp,WeissRaben,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"She is not the first priority of BP remodel for newer admirals but definitely pretty high. Of course she is not better at regular maps where you can use regular CL with better stats, but on some hard maps (3-5, etc) she is going to make a lot of difference if she kills a ship before the fight even starts. And during events branching rules with CLT may be stricter with more difficult enemies so you can use her to cheat out of that restriction. Also combined fleet. Ability to equip 3 landing crafts is important too. You don't remodel her for stats, you remodel her for unique features that would be invaluable on specific maps.   I'm definitely spending my BP next month on her and I somehow regret that I've already used the one from this month on Choukai."

kancolle,3dluvp,AlmaElma,2,Fri Jul 17 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"Abukuma is extremely good. Ability to shoot an opening torpedo while staying a CL for branching purposes will make, for example, 3-5 and event maps a lot easier.   It's a shame I won't get a BP for her till next month."
kancolle,3dluvp,AlmaElma,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:20:35 2015 UTC,"I have to choose between Yamashiro/Fusou or her. Might wait till the event comes out to choose which I kai ni.  Edit: Forgot to say, but since she is half landing carrier it takes away from her power as a CLT(I assume). So how strong will her damage with opening torpedo strike be I wonder."
kancolle,3dluvp,SomniareSolace,2,Fri Jul 17 09:24:38 2015 UTC,"I'd choose Abukuma with little thinking, she is that good. And you don't really need BBV unless there are special branching rules for them. Last two events I used them twice and only in support expeditions on later maps. I still don't have Yamashiro Kai2 and if cranes upcoming Kai2 will require two blueprints her remodel won't happen in the nearest future."
kancolle,3dluvp,GoldenCrater,2,Fri Jul 17 09:30:02 2015 UTC,That makes one hell of a CL for combined fleet ....

Now with a CL (especially AbukumaK2) it's a lot easier. Generally any light fleet map is easier now. I'm looking forward for my september 3-5 clearing. Maybe even august if the event gives enough medals."

kancolle,3dlgfs,GoldenCrater,2,Fri Jul 17 09:53:10 2015 UTC,Well from what I've seen standard KCV is fine. The alterations seem to be:   Removal of enemy composition on map screen (fleet prediction I think it's called) Adjustment of battle API (so battle predictors are broken currently)

If you work on that I think you can  Clear + farm for a decent amount of time on easy  OR  Clear on medium   If you have a lot of resources saved up you can farm on medium too I guess  I don't recommend hard
kancolle,3dlyqs,nerfkagaplz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:34:53 2015 UTC,"So I should work on getting my CA(V)s up, and get some Type 3/ AP Shells, okay. How many CA(V)s would you recommend?

kancolle,3dlyqs,GoldenCrater,2,Fri Jul 17 10:40:31 2015 UTC,"If you want to be extra prepared ideally you would want 3 CA and 2 CAV (for branching).  Honestly I think Mogami is a higher priority than Myoukou, since you don't seem to have any other aviation cruisers, and since you mention 1-5, you probably don't have many blueprints. Getting all four Myoukou class ships is enough for most situations  Also another point I should mention is that Maya (at level 75) is one of the most important CA to have because of AACI"

kancolle,3dgvhf,wiltheavatar,3,Thu Jul 16 04:16:47 2015 UTC,"Severely lacking in CAs, followed by CVs and BBs. Number of leveled DDs is also a little on the low side but it's not a pressing issue compared to the aforementioned classes.  Level some CAs at 3-2A (Myoukou-class, Myoukou and Haguro in particular), your CV(L)s should level alongside pretty easily (together with one accompanying BB). CVs don't need that much leveling to perform but try to get Souryuu to Kai Ni since she's halfway there.  It's hard to give an estimation of how prepared you are since the difference in difficulties can range pretty awkwardly from one event to another, but if we use last event as a comparison I'd say you could probably do the first map on Hard, then Easy for the rest (or E2 on Medium, E3 on Hard, then Easy for the rest if you force your way through E2, but not advisable). I doubt the upcoming event would be as simple but it's just a hunch.  It would help if you have a list of your equipment as well, since they are equally as important."
kancolle,3dgvhf,madharuhi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:48:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i think u can tackle medium with the ships you have, you just need to level some more ships, to 50-65+ especially your kaga and akagi and plus, your other CV(L)s. Oh i forgot kai ni Souryuu.  Also, get kiso and kitikami to kai ni because theyll help a lot.  Level 2-3 more DDs to 50-60.   Plus, should level 2-3 more CA(V)s.   BBs seems good but would recommend level them a bit higher  Overall, i think you are fine for easy or medium :P"

kancolle,3dgvhf,madharuhi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"The other Myoukou-class ships are good too, Haguro in particular. There are cases where branching rules treat CA and CAVs separately so it's better to level a couple more CAs.  If you don't have an Akashi yet, consider leveling Yukikaze over Fubuki. Their offensive stats are almost identical but Yukikaze is slightly bulkier and has the aptitude for torpedo CIs, and will perform better in most cases.  Equipment priority: Type 3 Shell > fighters > AP shell > radars  If you're doing the lower difficulties about 8 Reppuu+Shiden Kai Ni should be good enough (eg. 4 of each).  Definitely want to craft more Type 3 shells, another two or three more. AP shells will be useful too (10/90/90/30 for both AP and Type 3 shells).  Surface radars are nice to have to give extra accuracy and a bit of ELoS but they're probably the least important of the four (you can make up for ELoS if needed by equipping an extra seaplane)."

Should be able to level pretty fast while giving supporting EXP to the other DDs to Kai.  If your HQ level is below 40 it should be pretty easy to clear 3 nodes, while 41 to 80 may require some decent ASW, above HQ levels 80 may not be feasible to exp grinding due to stronger enemy subs with pre-emptive strikes on the first node."

If you were looking for something like grinding Unryuu in Spring E-2, then I'm sad to say there isn't one. IIRC 2-5 boss and one other map had reasonable Taigei drop rates.    4BB 2CV is reliable for boss clear, but will get directed away from the boss route about 50% of the time when spinning the compass after finishing the first node. It's up to the amount of resources you're willing to sacrifice at this point. The wiki also says to use the lighter 3-node fleet, which is also reliable when your girls are 60+."

kancolle,3dd8rt,Aussiroth,4,Wed Jul 15 10:50:35 2015 UTC,"iirc,  - 35.6cm for kongou classes - 41cm for nagato class, ise class and fusou class - 46cm for yamato class - 381mm for vittorio veneto class"
kancolle,3dd8rt,Cyanide3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:50:50 2015 UTC,"Further detail: fit guns give +1 accuracy, most non-fit ones give large penalties around -6. Fusou and Ise classes actually have 35.6 fit, but get +0 from 41cm so they're effectively fit. Both 46cm triple and 51cm are actually -1 on the Yamato class. Source: wikia had a sandbox page with values derived from some Japanese tests.  It also said that fit modifiers are apllied AFTER morale, which multiplies other accuracy bonuses and penalties by 0.5 - 1.5 iirc. That means sparkling is especially helpful when using overweight guns.  Also note that +9 stars on heavy guns give +6 acc (sqrt 4 × stars), so a +9 46cm effectively has no penalty on a Kongou class.  Further baseless speculation. I don't think anybody has seriously tested the 46cm twin proto, but I would bet that it has different fit properties than the 46cm triple based on the description."
kancolle,3dd8rt,MaSaHoMaKyo,2,Wed Jul 15 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"https://i.imgur.com/h1UPw9C.png  Proto 51cm is more or less -1, but the +1 accuracy on the gun helps bring it to pretty much ±0.  46cm Triple was removed from the Yamato tests because they did it some time ago, but IIRC the penalty's larger than Proto 51cm (36%~ versus 40++%). There's simply no ship that gets accuracy bonuses from 46cm Triple, not even Yamato-class (despite the class gets significantly lesser penalty compared to other classes).  Proto 46cm gives slightly larger penalty compared to Proto 51cm, but the difference is negligible.  Fit modifiers don't seem to receive the modifiers from morale either. Regardless, it doesn't really matter that much outside combined fleet or maps with high-evasion enemies since you'd get very near the 98% cap most of the time."
kancolle,3dd8rt,madharuhi,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:13:58 2015 UTC,kai and kai2 of kongou class have stock eqpt of 41 cm so I think you can use 41 cm in FBB without accuracy penalty
kancolle,3dd8rt,Jikkir_Skix,5,Wed Jul 15 11:06:03 2015 UTC,"Nope. They still suffer from using 41cm. That because in the early time, there were no Over Weight Penalty at all. That's why remodeled Kongou-class would give you 41cm. But everything changed when OWP kicked in.  But in single fleet, Kongou-class still doing fine by using 41cm + 35.6cm"
kancolle,3dd8rt,Admiral_Mikan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:47:54 2015 UTC,So if you put 2 or 3 of 41 cm guns the over weight penalty will kick in? I guess a better set up for FBB will be 41 cm 35.6 cm and 15.5 cm or change the 15.5 cm to radar then seaplane.
kancolle,3dd8rt,Jikkir_Skix,3,Wed Jul 15 13:46:42 2015 UTC,"Secondary guns are terrible on BBs and should never be used or mentioned unless you're intentionally lowering your damage (eg. 3-2A leveling).  Just stick with 2 main guns, seaplane and radar/shell.  Overweight penalty doesn't kick in with more guns, it kicks in the moment you place one gun that's heavier than the fit caliber a ship should be equipped with.  The penalty graph's pretty weird though, since accuracy actually goes up with 4 guns. Not that it matters since you should be using only 2 guns in most cases."
kancolle,3dd8rt,madharuhi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:04:25 2015 UTC,It was my understanding that putting a 3rd main gun on an FBB incurs a large penalty irrespective of the fit on the equipment.
kancolle,3dd8rt,MaSaHoMaKyo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"There's the penalty of not being able to double-attack and being forced to rely on luck for cut-ins, if that's what you mean. But that's true for two main guns and a secondary, too."
kancolle,3dd8rt,HiroariStrangebird,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"No, I meant an accuracy penalty. The side effect being that if you wanted to do 3-gun cut-in, then Haruna and Italia would have to do the 2 main + secondary version to avoid the penalty.  Obviously pretty cornercase, but I did hear about a guy using 3-gun on Nagato in the 5-5 sub route for this reason."
kancolle,3dd8rt,MaSaHoMaKyo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:08:19 2015 UTC,There is no accuracy penalty for using 3 guns. Each gun provides a further fit bonus. The misconception that using more than 2 guns gave a penalty was due to a translation error that has long been debunked.
kancolle,3dd8rt,Jifaru,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which was why I said the penalty graph's pretty weird. It goes down when you use 3 guns but it goes up again if you use 4, presumably a hidden bonus from using 4 guns but no one in the right mind would do that.  The penalty's negligible if you use fit guns (accuracy went down by just 1% on an Ise Kai when she changed from 2x 35.6cm to 3x 35.6cm guns), so you don't have to opt for 2x main guns and 1x secondary gun. Not that I would ever recommend for it though, not even on BBs with high luck."
kancolle,3dd8rt,madharuhi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:47:40 2015 UTC,everything changed   Accuracy penalty is not that big of a deal that people make out of it. Outside of combined fleet it's barely noticeable.

Do you not have a Radar for Yuudachi or is the boiler to increase her evasion? If you sparkle her, you can swap the boiler for a radar. You might want to consider using another CL from the Sendai or Agano-class. They'll provide more HP, armour and evasion as compared to Yuubari.   In any case, the 1CL 5DD route is subjected to much RNG, so it's a matter of persistence. Otherwise, you can try going with a heavier fleet."

Saying you get 270 resources total per hour that's a mix of fuel/ammo/steel/bauxite doesn't help that much compared to the exact values from the wiki.

The good thing about 37 and 38 is that if a sufficient number of your ships are sparkled, you'll be getting Great Successes 99% of the time, netting you more resources (Fuel, Ammo and Steel in particular). Also, you don't have to keep checking back every 15-30 minutes to send your ships off for expeditions since they have a 2 hours plus timer.    For bauxite, 6 is a stupidly good way to get it. Cut down on CV sortie-ing if you want to conserve bauxite.   Ultimately, how much resources to stockpile is dependent on what difficulty you plan to do the event on and whether you want to farm maps. Light grinding shouldn't be that much of an impact on resources."

With that, I've been getting Great Successes 100% of the time.   21 definitely gives more Fuel and possibly Ammo compared to 5, especially when you get a Great Success (99% of the time if you sparkle 3 ships and equip 5 drums). 5 does give Steel and Bauxite but if you run 37 & 38, Steel is already covered and you can always do 6 to obtain Bauxite, so I personally find 21 better."

kancolle,3dbwf4,rinisthebest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"Expedition 5 is noticeably higher for ammo, and only very slightly falls behind fuel compared to exp 21, after considering sparkling costs, and the resupply costs (assuming you sparkle and use 2 Mutsuki dd, Yuubari, 2 SS for exp 5)."
kancolle,3dbwf4,kingofquackz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:39:21 2015 UTC,Only stockpile if you're 100% confident that your fleet can perform at the lvl you need them to for the event. You'll end up wasting more resources with underlvled ships then needed if you spend time properly prepping your fleet for the challenge.
kancolle,3dbwf4,Ladycardboard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:51 2015 UTC,nah that I dont have an issue with I cleared the last event with all except E1 on hard because I didnt feel like wasting time for the reward it gave
kancolle,3d9mme,Kyoeishinkirou,11,Tue Jul 14 16:05:49 2015 UTC,RIP but you deserved that.
kancolle,3d9mme,lazinase,9,Wed Jul 15 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"It's a little strange to read the comments for this post with the Kuma! at the end, as though Kuma is the one who was banned.  Anyway OP, I'm sorry to hear about your loss. I'm not sure how invested you are in the game but it's definitely terrible to see that single line of black. Although the event is drawing close, it's still not too late to pick it up again. As we all know, events are great for getting rare ships and that will help to get you back into things. Of course, it's up to you on whether you want to play again.  As everyone else has mentioned, please do share what might have led to your ban if you don't mind.  Hopefully the rest of the day will brighten up for you."
kancolle,3d9mme,Tomaranai,3,Tue Jul 14 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"I started the game back in January when the Anime started. Although I had the game do pretty much all the grunt work for me, I would say I was still pretty invested. I farmed and crafted all the non-LSC rare ships did all of the item quests. Only ships I was missing are the LSC ships (never had any luck other than Bismark), Prinz Eugen and Akizuki."

kancolle,3d9mme,Admiral_Mikan,3,Tue Jul 14 16:26:39 2015 UTC,Well at least you were honest about it. Many other claims about getting banned while doing nothing wrong but honestly I don't buy any of that.
kancolle,3d9mme,AlmaElma,3,Wed Jul 15 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"Well done OP. Sorry to say, but at least for me, you don't deserve a pity at all. But thanks for sharing this hilarious story. Now I believe that devs do justice with their player.  Well, ofc it just unbelievable. Only 5 months and you already reached lv 105? And here I am, 1 year 4 months, and just reach lv 106 with normal playing. Well whatever, goodluck, and if you want to come back to Kancolle again, I just hope that you never cheating again."
kancolle,3d9mme,Primnu,6,Wed Jul 15 11:39:51 2015 UTC,Now you should tell us what did you do to get banned.
kancolle,3d9mme,chronomeister,7,Tue Jul 14 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"Update: Hi everyone in the subreddit. I lost a level 105 account with all the recent event items/ships and a Bismark to the account banning.   I started automating with game with an auto clicker  a while back and had it do my expeditions and 3-2-A farming runs for me. I would run it on a spare laptop and gotten away with running it 24/7 for the past 5 months.  Not sure what changed but last night I was hit with a ban screen after a series of unusual disconnects. It is most likely the automation or the web money sites I used. Either way, what is done is done and I sure will miss my entire fleet. I don't expect any sympathy but I can assure you the feels are still real."
kancolle,3d9mme,VoidNoodle,9,Tue Jul 14 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"5 months of non-stop auto-clicking? That's asking for a ban, especially if whatever you used doesn't apply randomness to the clicks/sequences. Easy to auto-detect when patterns can be found (no idea if dmm does that though, they probably just noticed that you were playing 24/7 lol).  I do have sympathy for you because I do think the game should have a built-in function for repeating expeditions a number of times. Some people already use methods to ensure they don't miss expedition timing for when they're away from their computer (like remote desktop) so I don't see a problem with just ensuring you always have expeditions running through other means."
kancolle,3d9mme,GoldenCrater,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:13 2015 UTC,Haha yeah I thought the same that after weeks of being online constantly they would surely ban me. I thought about adding a random delay to each sequence like I did with other games but after letting it run and nothing happened to it I just figured that they didn't check for it.   They waited till I was actually invested.
kancolle,3d9mme,Admiral_Mikan,3,Tue Jul 14 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Most game companies will not issue an immediate ban once they discover someone is subverting their game. Unless it comes right out into the open what they are using, they do this to ensure it's not a false positive and to catch any others who might be using a similar tool. Proly they use the same type of practice. Boss at one of my old jobs told me that if I look over my shoulder to see if anyone is watching then I already know what I'm going to do is wrong. If you were surprised that you weren't caught after a couple of days, that is acknowledgement that you knew that maybe you shouldn't be doing it but did it anyway. Not going to chastise any more than this; I'm sure you know better now. (Just do a better job not to get caught next time of course)"

kancolle,3d9mme,Blasterion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:20:37 2015 UTC,If there were issues with the web money sites that you used then it would have been a DMM account ban rather than just a kancolle one.

Nope. The only way to sink a ship is if you get heavily damaged in node X and you proceed onto node Y.

kancolle,3d9tq1,Tomaranai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"Ships   DDs: Looks good. You can consider leveling Ayanami to Kai Ni since she has the 2nd highest firepower of the DDs. Are you using Z1 and Z3 for expeditions? They're not resource efficient as they consume more resources.  CL(T)s: CLTs are great while your CLs (Sendai and Jintsuu) can be leveled a bit more to 70. You might want to consider investing in either Ooyodo or Yuubari for their 4 slots utility. CA(V)s: Looks fine. Either blueprint Chikuma into a CAV if you can spare one or level Suzuya or Kumano to match Tone. Having 2 decently leveled CAVs would serve you well.  CV(L)s: Looks fine. Maybe push up the Chitose pair levels a bit more, since carriers are apparently important for the upcoming event. BB(V)s: Looks good. If you don't want to blueprint Chikuma, you can consider giving it to either one of the Fusou pair.   Equipment   Looks fine. Since you have Akashi, you might want to improve some of your other equipment apart from the ASW ones . Notable ones are the 10cm HA+FD for AACI purposes and excellent DD gun, 20.3cm No.2/3, 35.6cm, AP Shells to name a few. You can consider developing better radars (Type 32 and 33). Scrap equipment like 14cm guns, AA guns, basic planes if you are strapped for space.    You should be fine for Hard with those ships and equipment. Just prep your resources and you'll be good to go.   Oh and consider moving on to 4-3 for DD and CL leveling."

kancolle,3d8wla,Tomaranai,2,Tue Jul 14 13:27:59 2015 UTC,"Your fleet looks fine for Hard. Along with Suzuya and Kumano, you can level your CAs (Ashigara and Haguro) a bit more to around Level 70. Although you have Fusou and Yamashiro, you can consider leveling Mutsu in case slow BBs are needed for branching. She'll add more firepower and armour as well, as compared to the FBBs. Another 2 Reppuu would be good, prep your resources and you should be alright. The rest is up to the devs.  As for your question on AV leveling, since your main fleet is more or less prepared, there's no harm power leveling an AV just in case there's some weird branching rule. It'll be useful for 6-3 as well if you've not completed it yet."
kancolle,3d8wla,Tomaranai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:41:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I plan. Thinking of giving Yamashiro the BP that I can get this month and hopefully be able to get 3 medals from EO next month for Chikuma.  For AVs, is Akitsushima fine or should I level one of the Chitose sisters instead?  Resource-wise, 70k fuel, 52k bullets, 77k steel and 30k baux. Planning on stockpiling on baux a few days before the event until it's at 40k or 50k. 400-500 buckets should be fine right? Don't really plan on charging ahead."
kancolle,3d8wla,madharuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid no matter how cute Akitsushima is, the Chitose sisters are much better AVs since they can equip a Midget Sub for pre-emptive torpedo strikes.  Those resources and bucket count should be fine. Probably more bauxite and ammo. I found ammo to be my limiting factor the last event."

Last event my limiting factor was fuel, I ended up at like 2k fuel and no Unryuu by the time the event ended :c  Thanks for the help!"
kancolle,3d8wla,kingofquackz,2,Tue Jul 14 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"Since level itself doesn't affect evasion directly (it does give you some evasion stats though), having a high level Akitsushima in the case of a map with an easier route wouldn't make much of a difference since she's simply not battle-material; you just need her to survive until you hit the boss node."

kancolle,3d6kaw,Spheroidal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, troll AACI setups are incredibly rare. You can almost always spot an AACI setup from the ships and fleet composition. Generally Maya and Akizuki are guaranteed to be AACI equipped, with the occasional high AA DD like Fubuki also having AACI. Over the last couple months I've only been bit by an unexpected AACI twice, which is a pretty good track record. I've definitely lost more bauxite to sending CVs to 3-2/5-4."

It's probably best to just not bring large amounts of bombers into PVP, for the sake of one's bauxite. You can still win easily without them."

kancolle,3d6kaw,madharuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:07:30 2015 UTC,I have enough steel really about to cross 100k. So the more fuel and ammo the better. Since exp 2 brings back 100 ammo every 30mins.  Multiple to clear quest faster
kancolle,3d6kaw,madharuhi,2,Tue Jul 14 00:12:38 2015 UTC,"2/38/21 when the week starts, and back to 2/5/21 when I finish with the weekly 37/38 runs. When I'm outside or going to sleep I just run 11/24/21 instead (latter is simply because I'm too lazy to change the comp). I'm not particularly concerned about bauxite since it's the least-used resource and I already have Taihou.  I do as many daily sortie quests as I can if I have the time, but most of the time I go to sleep before I finish with the 5 World 2 boss kills. I do all my weeklies and monthlies, except the 6-1 and 4DD1CL1CA comp for 2-5 (if I happen to get the medal before I succeed with that comp). Many of the weeklies and monthlies actually make you lose resources instead but I don't particularly mind since screws are the far harder-to-obtain resources.  PVP is just a fleet made up of the ships I want to level, and that's about it. Night battle is as usual, done if it secures me an S rank. I avoid using my level 99 ships as much as possible (including my CLTs) and I don't want to ring them yet.  Daily construction is done using minimum (or LSC if I'm in the mood for one), daily development is done using either AP shell or large torp bulge recipe."
kancolle,3d6kaw,kingofquackz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:13 2015 UTC,Do you sparkle your expedition 5? Why do you choose 5 over 21?
kancolle,3d6kaw,madharuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, I only sparkle if I'm doing the drum expeditions to guarantee the great successes.  Expedition 5 gives one of the more impressive hourly gains in the entire game, perhaps losing only to the drum expeditions on great success. I run both 5 and 21 most of the time until I need the steel, which I would then run 21/37/38 at the same time."
kancolle,3d6kaw,kingofquackz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:15:23 2015 UTC,"5 has a greater hourly rate for ammo than 21, while the fuel difference is negligible, simply because 21 uses up ammo while 5 does not."
kancolle,3d6kaw,kingofquackz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:07:02 2015 UTC,"Not if you get great success on 21. If I run 2/5/21, I can sparkle the backup Mutsuki-class ships while 21 is running, so there's essentially no downtime and that makes 21 one of the best expeditions, if not the best.  What 5 does have over 21 is that it gives steel and bauxite. The steel is negligible, but +13 bauxite/hour isn't too bad for a side gain."

kancolle,3d85ep,RegulusZwei,3,Tue Jul 14 06:49:45 2015 UTC,"Stick with medium, unless the event is really really easy, or there is some equipment you really want on hard.  Interesting how you have two Kitakami and Ooi to level 70. Any reason why?  CA: The only one you have ready for hard (maybe) now is Tone, but you need a lot more, even for medium (they also help for cheaper 2-5 extra operation monthly clear). I think you should get around 2/3 CAV and 2/3 (maybe more) CA to their second remodels if you can, or in the case of mogami class, just to level 70 (hard) or 55-60(medium).  CV: why do you level two kaga's? Your levels are way too low to be farming for equipment, and iirc kaga doesn't even give good equipment. Try to focus on the higher levelled one   It should be fine for Medium, really depends on event difficulty  DD: Try to get 6 DD's to a decent level, I think level 50-60 is good enough for medium  CL: Should be fine  BB: All way too low for hard (except haruna) Try to get Hiei to level 60 or second remodel, then change Kongou as 3-2 support.  (WHY DON'T YOU REMODEL FUSOU WHAT ARE THESE CHOICES IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME)  Equipment: More AP/T3 shells (definitely)   More Reppuu's (?)  More depth charge (?)  You didn't post a photo for subs, but I'll assume you have them, as you say you're doing 3-2 grinding"
kancolle,3d85ep,Ryuuaza,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:15:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips!  Ended up with two sets of CLT because of all the grinding I did at 4-3 More quints is always a good thing anyway right?   That's probably why my CVLs are all higher leveled than my CVs too.  I kept Fusou unremodelled because of the drop in firepower, though I'll remodel her once I get her BP  How many Reppus do I actually need? I was under the impression that there wasn't much difference between them and Shinden Kais anyway.  And yeah, I've got I-19, I-8, I-168 & I-58. at level 70. Unremodelled though."
kancolle,3d85ep,madharuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:43:30 2015 UTC,"How many Reppus do I actually need? I was under the impression that there wasn't much difference between them and Shinden Kais anyway.   6 to 8, some players even get 10 or so.  It may be just 1 AA stat worth of difference, but when converted into fighter power, it can often mean:   Hitting AS(+) with less CVs Having more bombers (or being able to carry a bomber instead of using a Reppuu mule) Being able to switch bombers to larger slots for higher damage Being able to use the other 'weaker' fighters like the Type 21 Zero Fighter (Skilled), which gives a very useful +2 accuracy.   More quint torps are good but it's more of an 'end-game' kind of thing players do, considering some of them are hardcore players aiming to make +10 Type 1 AP shells and quint torps. But having two sets of CLTs isn't necessarily a bad thing considering there's fleet-locking.  You can just remodel your I-168 since she stays as an SS instead of becoming an SSV."
kancolle,3d85ep,MasterMirage,2,Tue Jul 14 12:37:56 2015 UTC,"You can probably scrape by doing Hard on maybe E1-E3 at best but I wouldn't bother from there on.  You're also missing quite a bit of Type 91 AP Shells (try to have one equipped on EVERY BB)  I also don't recommend levelling Ise/Hyuuga over Fusou/Yamashiro considering they're just a worst BBV in every single way and the lack of rare equipment/Kai ni don't make them a worthy choice at all.  Other than that, /u/Ryuuaza has you covered quite well."

kancolle,3d4oob,HygenicToothbrush,2,Mon Jul 13 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"I feel my prep for my first LSC is pretty standard:   Draw pentagram with blood on wooden floor (preferably in an attic or basement if you have one of those). Goat blood is the best. Go the local K-Mart or Target. Pick up a set of grey stockings, grey top, and a grey skirt. Your Bismarck cosplay doesn't need to be perfect, but you need to subtly show RNG-sama what you're after. Don't quote me on this, but I think that Bismarck loves baumkuchen. Buy a couple of them from your closest German bakery. I believe those chunky sausages might also suffice.  Light some candles, and burn some incense. Then place your laptop in the middle of the blood, embraced by a gentle ring of baumkuchen and sausage.  Bring up the LSC page. Gently bend over and place a soft kiss on Akashi's small face. She will blush and say some Japanese. Here is where you glide your mouse over her body and click the ""I'm ready to be buttfucked"" button.   A complex series of dials and dealies will appear. Don't use a recipe, but put in the digits which you feel are right for Bismarck. What numbers will your future Bismarck like? Slowly imput them in. No, not too fast. You'll scare her away. You know it to be true. You stare in the white abyss, fixing your stockings waiting for her appearance. Beautiful. Perfect. Sit back and stare at your prize. No words leave your mouth.

With reference to /u/Noperative's event preparation guide:   Resources  There is a big difference between getting the resources to clear the event vs getting the resources to clear the event in a few days and then going back and relentlessly farming for rare ships. For most people, a modest stockpile of 30k resources and 200-300 buckets will let you clear the event comfortably before the last day but not rushing it. 40-50k resources with 300-500 buckets will likely enable you to clear the event early on and farm your heart out. If you save up a week or so before the event you can reach the easy stockpile, it will take about 2-3 weeks for a thorough stockpiling. Anything more and this is probably the hardcore territory."

kancolle,3d4oob,arinano,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"Didn't particularly prepare for it, just thought I hit the regen cap at that time so I might as well do an LSC. Can't remember what I got but I assure you it's worse than getting Maruyu's.  Have never done a minimum LSC to date yet because I'm still busy with trying to get the other LSC-only ships. Currently have Taihou after 15~20 attempts, while the BBs aren't appearing at all after 30+. Not particularly interested in Yamato-class but I was kinda expecting Bismarck to appear within 10 tries, which I was obviously wrong about."
kancolle,3d4oob,fujum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"My tactic with LSC is not to think at all after i go to push the button.  Just let your mind go blank until the timer pops up.  Works surprisingly well.  Got Agano my first try and have gotten 3 Maruyu and 2 Akitsumaru out of like, 12-15 LSC that way.  Also, I convince myself I won't get what I want.

kancolle,3d6t5e,deadbmafia,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"Your CAs, with the exception of Maya, can afford to be leveled a bit more to around Level 70-80. You might want to have a spare CA at hand. Unless you plan to remodel Chikuma into a CAV before the event, you might want to level either Suzuya or Kumano or both to match Tone's level.  Chitose and Chiyoda can be leveled further. Having another 1-2 more CVLs on standby might be good idea. Level Mutsu more to match Kirishima and Kongou in case slow BBs are needed. No harm prepping more FBBs as well in case.   Apart from ships, there's also the matter of equipment, which is as important as levels."

kancolle,3d5224,Noperative,3,Tue Jul 14 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"1) No way lol  2) Nothing really changed. They added Combined Fleet for event maps and new ways to path with LoS checks and active branching (you choose your path, no RNG needed). Some ships with the right equipment set-up can do something called AACI(Anti-Air Cut-In) which makes them shoot down enemy planes in a very stylish fashion. Other than that, much of the base game is the same. Any new mechanics you'll literally encounter one-by-one as you play because the maps never got changed, only the new maps added would use any of the new systems."

I think the only difference I've noticed so far is the addition of 'Food Supply' ships that you can find information on here.  Those are just rewards you can get for doing quests (and maybe other things, not sure) that make it easier keep your ship girls happy.  Otherthan that, I'm not sure what else is new because I didn't really get far when I took a break (I was stuck on 2-3 back then at around HQ lv30, and now I'm on 3-2 at HQ lv40 - I'm not even sure if I'm progressing very well ; w ; ).

kancolle,3d3phb,MrFisk02,2,Mon Jul 13 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yes 2x46cm is fine on Yamato class. For events you should use 35.6cm guns (dazzle or triple prototype if you have them) on Kongou class, especially in combined fleets, but if it's not combined fleet and you are having trouble killing the enemy then consider 41cm guns."
kancolle,3d3phb,madharuhi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:05:09 2015 UTC,Has there been any information on the effect of the 51cm supercannons on Yamato-class? What about Nagato-class?
kancolle,3d3phb,CruzSchiffer,3,Mon Jul 13 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"Proto 51cm has less penalty than 46cm on both classes. In fact, it's almost as good as neutral (±0) so there's no reason to not use it at all despite the fact that you go way overkill with the firepower (the accuracy alone is worth it).   The theoretical turret weight for Proto 51cm is just slightly heavier than 46cm's, so the less severe penalty could possibly be a reflection of its superior performance."
kancolle,3d3phb,royalscion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:04:44 2015 UTC,You can't get the hidden accuracy bonus from upgrading standard guns though which is honestly worth more especially in events.
kancolle,3d3phb,CruzSchiffer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what you were referring to by ""hidden accuracy bonus"" here. Mind expanding on it?"
kancolle,3d3phb,royalscion,2,Sat Jul 18 01:18:40 2015 UTC,"Lighter guns will always be more accurate and anything more than 182.5 firepower will be wasted because of the day-time cap, so 1 x 46cm + 1 x 41cm is better for Yamato-class imo. The extra firepower from a second 46cm will be wasted.  I personally go for 1 x 46cm + 1 x 35.6cm for Kongou-class, since the accuracy from the 35.6cm can alleviate the overweight penalty, especially when you get it to +9 with Akashi. 41cms are also overweight for Kongou-class, so 2 x 41cm pretty much means you've got a double penalty."
kancolle,3d3phb,kingofquackz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:27:56 2015 UTC,"While somewhat correct, you're also missing that having additional firepower lets you meet firepower cap not just during red T, but during other situations as well, such as 80% ammo penalty or combinations of those. And as usual, the night battle cap is 300 so the extra fp is definitely not wasted. There's no reason to put 41cm on Yamato class unless it's proto; while daytime fp cap is softcapped, that doesn't mean that additional firepower doesn't help, albeit small.   EDIT: also forgot to mention it makes up firepower when moderately damaged (orange)"
kancolle,3d3phb,WeissRaben,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:51:15 2015 UTC,"182.5 is assuming you have Saiun which you'll definitely use in situations where you really don't want red-T.   such as 80% ammo penalty or combinations of those   Ammo modifier is applied after the cap. Additional FP won't help in this case.   There's no reason to put 41cm on Yamato class unless it's proto;   41cm cannons actually increase accuracy for Yamato-class even without +accuracy stats. Also, a +9 41cm is in every way better than a proto 41cm, which cannot be upgraded. Same goes for other cannons   EDIT: also forgot to mention it makes up firepower when moderately damaged (orange)   True, but it's Yamato and the difference between a missed hit and +~5 extra damage is a lot. It's up to you to decide whether a few more points in FP is better than accuracy bonuses, which scale way better."
kancolle,3d3phb,howdoyouplaythisgaem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:10:02 2015 UTC,"You won't always want a Saiun though, examples are 5-5 where green T on pre-boss is death and getting to the boss node is more a struggle than actually finishing it off.   Thanks for the correction on the ammo multiplier though, guess I was a bit fuzzy there and misremembered. It's a lot more likely to have a proto 41cm instead of a 41cm +9 for most admirals though since it is a lot cheaper.   Accuracy is personal preference, but ultimately to me since accuracy can be improved with ship level but firepower cannot I prefer more firepower."
kancolle,3d3phb,Tomaranai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"You're only considering daytime caps. Night time cap is 300, so it's worth putting the 46/51 cm on yamato class if you're up against a tanky ish boss node."

If you want to be over-prepared, probably 5 more Reppuu to ensure that you have 2 CVs worth of Reppuu. However, if you start stockpiling now and discover you're short of Reppuu during the event, you can always use your resource stockpile to do some quick crafts. Maybe 1-2 more Suisei M12A (not that important since you have Suisei Egusa). You can scrap some Suisei if you're out of space; you don't need that many. Your torpedo bombers are fine."

BB(V)s: Screwed for Hard, possibly screwed for Medium. Your BBs should be ~Level 70 and Kai Ni for Hard, ~50-60 for Medium. Yamato is 8 levels from Kai, might as well work on her. Get the remaining Kongou sisters to match Kongou. Your BBVs are screwed if they're needed for branching purposes. Consider working on them to at least level 40-50. CV(L)s: Screwed for Hard and possibly screwed for Medium. The dev said the upcoming event would be around carriers. You have a good number of CVs, get them up to level 50-60 at least for Medium. Your CVLs are lacking with only Jun'you at a decent level. Work on Ryuujou and Shouhou at least.  CA(V)s: Screwed for all difficulties. Having only 3 CA(V)s is insufficient. You need at least 4 CAs and 2 CAVs. Level another 2 more CAs (Maya and probably Kinugasa since she's your next highest) and level Mogami since she remodels into a CAV at Level 10. CL(T)s: Not screwed I suppose. Level one more CL (Kuma or Naka) and you'll be good... for Medium. Yuubari is a good investment for her 4 slots but you have more important ships to level. DDs: Screwed for Hard, okay for Medium. Get Shigure to Kai Ni and level Shimakaze, Yukikaze and Fubuki more to around Level 60, preferably 70 for Fubuki for Kai Ni.   Equipment  Not that screwed since you have time to work on it. You definitely need:    Some Type 3 Shells for Installation Bosses - around 4-5 Another 3 more AP Shells Type 32 Radars (Least important. Focus on the shells first) Reppuu count is okay for Medium, possibly Hard 2 more Suisei M12A would be good 2 more Ryuusei Kai would be good   Overall, at your current condition, you're screwed for Hard and you'll struggle on Medium. Easy would be alright. There's still time, so if you want to challenge the event on higher difficulties, consider working on those pointed out. Don't forget to prepare your resources too."

You can craft them with 10/10/10/20 (Sonar) and 10/30/10/10 (Depth Charge). Ideally each ship should be equipped with a pair of Sonar and Depth Charge, as there's a 1.15 modifier as opposed to only Sonar or only Depth Charge."

kancolle,3d3phb,Tomaranai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"Your carriers need some love. Level Hiryuu and Souryuu to Kai Ni if possible for their excellent planes. Jun'you would be good but I'm not sure if you have enough time. Give Akagi some love too. Give 3 more DDs some love. Murakamo, Akatsuki, Fubuki, Yukikaze, Yuudachi are some choices, especially the last 3. Definitely give Kitakami and Ooi a lot more love. This is priority in fact. Maya, Mogami and Kumano. Your CA(V)s are obviously out of love and this might be an issue during events.  BBs are fine, BBVs need more love. Love them more by removing those secondary guns on Kongou and Haruna and replacing them with either a radar or AP Shell."
kancolle,3d3phb,Admiral_Mikan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'll defintely try to get Hiryuu and Souryuu, but I definitely don't think I can get Jun'you in time. I'll see if I can get Fubuki, yuudachi, and yukikaze to higher levels. Seeing as I have more radars than ap shells I'll definitely give em the radars. I was thinking of getting Nachi and myouko if not atleast nachi to her kai ni so I have enough strong CAs but now that I think about it I won't have enough time. I'll definitely be sure to get my CAVs and the other Myouko sisters, the Destroyers, the CLTs, and my Carriers the love they need. Thanks for the help. Hopefully I get the other girls I've been hoping to get during the event."
kancolle,3d3phb,kingofquackz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Time is certainly a limiting factor but there's still 2 weeks, so there's still time to quickly power-level what's necessary. If the event is a long one, you can even level ships during the event should you find you're short on something. At the most it's alright to leave your ships at Kai but ensure they're fully modernised.  All the best leveling your ships and for the event."

kancolle,3d3phb,kingofquackz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:01:02 2015 UTC,"Hey guys fairly new player here been only playing for a month and a half but i'm having a tough time clearing 2-4,   http://imgur.com/pE8Lo97 this is my fleet im using and i pretty much always tend to go to a-b route 80% of the time.   the times i don't go though i get fleets that have 3 or more flagships and its pretty much wrecking me pre boss node :( been running this for a 2 weeks or so. i feel like i did a bad job in leveling other ships and my hq level is 55 while my highest level ship is only my 38 kirishima ;_; maybe i should just level her up instead but my ocd just likes to kick in for small things"
kancolle,3d3phb,konbe,2,Tue Jul 14 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"With those ships and levels (except for Souryuu), you shouldn't be having any difficulties.    First, the compass on 2-4 can be really annoying. It's been a while since I did 2-4 but I don't recall there being any branching rules in particular. I think if you had a CVL there's a higher chance of going one particular route, but even so, branching is really very RNG-reliant foe this map. Second, are your ships fully modernised? Having modernised ships makes quite a bit of difference. How are you equipping your ships? To maximise damage, you have to equip them properly. Do you have enough fighters on your carriers to achieve Air Superiority? Third, if you have a sub, you can consider using it to tank hits. Fourth, try not to focus leveling only one ship."
kancolle,3d3phb,Tomaranai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically the fairies really don't want me to go to the boss.  as for modernization since i do 2-3 for dailies i get lots of CAs and feed them to my ships. i am missing some though which i should probably focus on but i usually try to max armor and FP.  As for equips my bbs i use the one 41 and 35.6 15.5 and seaplane (this is for my kongou classes so they dont go overweight)  Nagato uses 2 41s, 15.5 and plane   And for Fusou i use two 35.6s 15.5s and plane  MY CVs i gave Akagi Reppuus are her biggest slot, ryuusei, suisei and recon plane Souryuu i gave her 2 type 52 zero fighters, suisei and 97 torpedo bomber   i really dont focus on one ship i give equal attention to most which is why nagato and kirishima are so close together i stopped leveling them to kai most of the kongou sisters (missing kongou as shes my last one i need) i think i just need modernization on my ships"
kancolle,3d3phb,Admiral_Mikan,2,Wed Jul 15 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"New player and you have a Reppuu? Nice. Well, with those equipment, you definitely shouldn't be having any problems at all. That means it's just RNG messing with you. Just keep trying that's all.   Maxing armour, FP and torpedoes is indeed a priority.  15.5cm secondaries are okay for now but it'll be best if you can get some radars or AP Shell. Those perform much better. 15.5cm gives a 110% damage modifier on cut-in, while radars allow for double attacks (2x 120%) and AP Shell provides 150% on cut-in. Radars can be obtained cheaply from Isuzu and AP Shells from 10/90/90/30.  You have a recon plane on Akagi? Do you mean a Saiun? So long as your fighter power adds up to 133 thereabouts, it should be fine.   Yeah, equal attention is best. Some people end up with really skewed ship levels, which isn't very good for events.   Good luck for 2-4 then."
kancolle,3d3phb,Skittles96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"thanks for the heads up ill probably try it again when souryuu gets kai'd. i really need a saiun though but im using a type 2 recon plane on akagi  I think i might switch akagi with kaga and use kaga instead but not sure i have some CVs that i can replace akagi or souryuu examples are Kaga, Shoukaku and Hiryuu.   Thanks for the tips :D i wont be let down not clearing 2-4 soon ill just keep trying"
kancolle,3d3phb,konbe,2,Wed Jul 15 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly quite amazed by your repertoire of ships for someone who has only played for a month and a half. Kaga is an excellent CV thanks to her 46 plane slot. Souryuu and Hiryuu are good investments because of the rare planes they get at Kai Ni. Shoukaku might be getting a Kai Ni upgrade, so she's also worth investing. Anyway, using Kaga now would be good.   For Saiun, try 20/60/10/110 with a CV flag. There's no need to use a Type 2 Recon at such an early stage. It's usually used when you need LoS, have more than 2 CVs or nothing better to put on your CVs, which is rare. Akagi might be better off with a Torpedo Bomber in place of that Recon Plane.  Yup, just keep trying."

kancolle,3d3phb,Noperative,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"No, they are not consumable and to my knowledge they do not boost non-drum required expeditions.  I wouldn't bother sparkling for expedition 5 unless I'm really low on Fuel and Ammo and/or have plenty of free time, as it's quite a short expedition. If you max sparkle all four ships to 85, that would take you at least 16 sorties and there's a chance you might get scratch damage, which would take a few minutes to repair. Of course, being max sparkled means you're good for at least 12 runs (morale drops by 3 per expedition and note that you don't always get a Great Success). To put it into numbers, in 12 runs:    Non-sparkled: 2,400 Fuel and Ammo, 240 Steel and Bauxite Sparkled: 3,600 Fuel and Ammo, 360 Steel and Bauxite   1.2k difference for Fuel and Ammo (forget about that paltry 120 for Steel and Bauxite) which is okay I guess. Up to you to decide if it's worth the time."

kancolle,3d3phb,Uthred,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:47:08 2015 UTC,All ships participating in the expedition must have at least 50 morale ('sparkling') for a chance at Great Success. The chance for Great Success increases approximately 19% per sparkling ship.   From wiki.

Dupe ships that get useful equipment at their first remodel can be kept (scrap them after getting their equipment): Yuugumo class (Yuugumo, Makigumo, Naganami, Hayashimo, Kiyoshimo, Takanami, Asashimo) some of the Kagerou class (mainly Isokaze) Akizuki (not currently available) Akitsumaru Akashi    Some ships get useful equipment at their second remodel, this is usually only for advanced players who have a large fleet of level 80+ ships: Hiryuu Souryuu Kitakami Ooi Fubuki Ashigara    Most of the first list is rare enough that you don't need to worry about dupes early on.

No matter what I do I just can't seem to get past the boss node (assuming I reach it since 90% of the time RNG hates me and makes me go to a dead end). When I do make it there, I get completely destroyed (managed to get a C one time but mostly Ds). I've heard of using subs but I only have one, and I've farmed 1-5 a million times and they're just not dropping. I am using 4BBs, 1 CV, 1 CA. This is my fleet right now.  From what I've read online my levels should be ok I think, everybody's kai'd, I've basically modernized all my BB's for max or almost max armor and firepower (running out of fodder ships). In terms of equipment I have two red guns, a plane, and a radar on Kongou on the BB's. What should I do to beat it? Thanks in advance!"
kancolle,3d3phb,Felendis,2,Fri Jul 17 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"As someone who's on the same boat as you, the compass fairies are trolls 90% of the time.   if you go from node a to node b end the sortie you won't make it to the boss and if you do your ammo/fuel will be gone.   max modernize some of your ships, and try to have enough fighters on your CV to get Air Superiority. If you have another CV i would replace your CA with it but if you don't, a CA will still suffice. for kongou you can use a type 3 shell instead of the radar but radars work well too. if you want some fodder ships i would do 2-3 just to get tone/chikuma since they give some good stats.   other than that keep trying and good luck :D"
kancolle,3d3phb,StoneFlame,2,Fri Jul 17 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"Just keep trying until it passes through, or construct for another CV.

There's 2 paths, the bottom one with no AS required where I stacked all bombers and hoped to path to the boss with healthy ships. That is extremely RNG heavy, I was stuck for 2 weeks because I didn't think I could reach the AS needed for the top route. In the end, it is better to fish for the top route while stacking the 128(123+5) AS needed to beat the preboss carriers. Get another carrier and craft some fighter planes to reach it and you should do better."

kancolle,3d54qd,mithikx,2,Mon Jul 13 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"Consider power-leveling the following:   Level Yukikaze, Ikazuchi and Inazuma to match your top 3 DDs. Kiso to Level 65 and remodel her into a CLT. CLTs are immensely helpful in events and it wouldn't hurt to have 3 available.  Level Ooi further to around level 60. Level Kumano to match Suzuya. CAVs are important for branching purposes. Level your CAs to around level 60.  Souryuu and Hiryuu make for a good investment because of the rare planes they get at Kai Ni. Chitose and Chiyoda are also good investments as CVLs. Boost the levels of Nagato, Mutsu, Yamashiro and Fusou a bit more to match your FBBs.   If there's no fleet locking, you should be good with these ships. If there is, Medium might be challenging and you might have to go on Easy to avoid fleet locking, assuming it follows the last event where there was no fleet-locking on Easy."
kancolle,3d54qd,Tomaranai,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:00:47 2015 UTC,Level up a few more CA and a lot more DD is my recommendation.
kancolle,3d54qd,Noperative,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"You could use some more high leveled CA(V)'s for sure, as it seems to be your weakest class and ship locking during the event will require more. Other then that your BBs and CVs could use more levels."
kancolle,3d54qd,Jaynight,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:36:57 2015 UTC,You should level a few more DD's. Having only 6 might be a problem if there is ship locking. If you don't have any AAFD I would suggest leveling Fubuki for her FD. Hatsushimo is another great DD with high AA and luck. Level Kiso to Kai Ni for the same reason and also having 3 CLT in the same fleet is just evil. Having half the enemy fleet gone before shelling starts is a beautiful feeling. If you can get Hiryuu and Souryuu to Kai Ni for their planes. Good luck in the event.

kancolle,3d3v0k,happyh0rse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:00:26 2015 UTC,wow 300 attempts? I think I gave up crafting CVs after 50 attempts straight w/o a CV in sight.   I admire your dedication for that.

Throughout March I did LSCs for Taihou; I got 2 Shoukaku and a Zuikaku within my first 5 crafts, and Taihou on my 11th (with 2 BB crafts in between for Musashi during her increased chance event and I got her!). I got Kasturagi as expected from Spring E-2 and farmed for Unryuu (who dropped after 4 runs!). I have to say, my luck this game has been pretty superb for only playing not even half a year.

I knew nothing and was content in it during that time. I'd just gotten back into the game around the time Spring 2015 started,and havent played much since then as well. I was doing equipment dailies for equiment dailies, then for sanshikidans and ap shells during the event.   I only recently started planes due to necessity, but I'd been using the wrong recipe (20/10/60/100 instead of 20/60/10/100) for quite a while, hence the lack of planes.  As for levels, I was stuck on 2-4 for the longest time, so I hadn't been able to grind like crazy. That and I was REALLY casual playing."

Also I would suggest Souryuu to kai2  Assuming there are no equipment lock, you should be fine for Medium... You're definitely in better shape than I was last event when I tried to medium the whole events, only to finish the EOs on easy...  Also if you have the BP, try to get one of fusou/yamashiro to kai2... the model 12 will helps with extra air power in case of combined fleets."

kancolle,3d1mk1,OnlyLikesKancolle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:14 2015 UTC,I don't see any reppus there. I recommend you craft some since this event is hinted to be carrier focused. Also maybe use Akashi's improvement arsenal to upgrade some of your guns if you have her.   Edit: You might want to level up some destroyers to at least level 70 (8 of them at the least)
kancolle,3d1mk1,Seelegewehr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"You might be okay for medium depending on the general difficulty of the event. If you have Akashi I would recommend on improving the Type 94 AAFD into a 10cm HA Mount + AAFD. Upgrading AP Shells is a good idea too (to at least +4) as it is very inexpensive but effective. It also wouldn't hurt to acquire a couple more Reppuu (like, 2-3 more) but Shinden Kai 2 will still work if you really don't wanna develop more fighters.  Shimakaze and Yukikaze should get some levels; they are among the strongest destroyers. Ooyodo too - while her stats  (particularly her torpedo stat) aren't as good as the Kai Ni CLs she has 4 equipment slots.  Kai Ni Maya if you can - she has the best anti-air cut in in the game but also has decent stats if you decide to use her as a standard heavy cruiser."

Though ""event"" is a ~2 week thing so should be enough with income from expeditions and stuff.  Yes, you can switch difficulties, the map will reset after that so you'll need to clear it from the scratch. Also, once cleared the map will lock on the appropriate difficulty so you can't clear it on easy and then return and farm on hard. And last event you couldn't straight up change from easy to hard, you had to go easy-medium-hard. Lowering was fine though as far as I know.  Fleet locking last event worked as you described, your ships got marked but easy difficulty just ignored the mark. If you switch to medium it will kick in, making your girls locked from the map unless you switch back. It is currently not known if there will be any fleet locking at the upcoming event but the probability is quite high.  Please group your girls by ship type."

kancolle,3cysj0,rinisthebest,4,Sun Jul 12 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"The reason the submarine on the first node is so deadly is because it's in the line ahead formation.  The other submarines are in either echelon or line abreast.  Those formations have significantly lower hit rates and damage modifiers than line ahead.  The other EO maps are probably a better use of your time and resources.  I've gotten quite a few submarines to drop from 2-5 and 3-5 while also going for other rare drops (Akashi, Taigei, a bunch of rare destroyers).  Once you pass HQ level 80 it's generally not worth it to go to 1-5 for anything other than quests.  If you want to keep trying though, your equipment setup looks good so all I can suggest is to sparkle and pray.  You can try the rare destroyer recipe (either 250-30-200-30 or 250-130-200-30), but the drop rate is so low I find it generally not worth it unless you also need some of the rare drops it gives like Shimakaze or Yukikaze.  Doing it just for submarines usually ends in bitter disappointment.  If all else fails, events are a great place to get rare drops.  Despite several dozen 1-5 runs myself I never got I-19 or I-8 until they dropped for me during the last event.  I eventually got three copies of each throughout the course of farming the event maps.  I know it's painful having to wait, but if you can stomach waiting for the event in a few weeks you're almost certain to find some maps that will answer your prayers."

If that doesnt do the trick and you really want to farm 1-5 then try getting some Akitsumaru gear with a full set of that and lvl 80+ ships I usually only abort about 1 out of 5 or 6 sorties and consistently S rank the boss.

Your setup looks good, but if you're looking to farm hachi/iku, you can put a fleet of 6 instead a fleet of 4, since you're probably stopping at 3rd node anyway...  Having 2 subs is not that bad, unless you plan to do 2-3 all the time, rotating 2 subs for 3-2A is not that bad, provided you havent turn your goya/imuya into SSV.   Also when you have enough medals for blueprints, consider giving one to Fusou/Yamashiro for zuiun model 12."
kancolle,3cysj0,kingofquackz,2,Sun Jul 12 02:01:55 2015 UTC,Ah if all else fails i guess the upcoming event will be my last hope lol. and yep planning on giving BP to fusou :)
kancolle,3cysj0,Minhtyfresh00,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:29:54 2015 UTC,Most people drop farming 1-5 after lvl 80 because of troll sub and only do it for monthly. Well at least as far as i know.   You could spam 250/30/250/30 for dailies and hope you get Hachi. (if your farming for subs)

kancolle,3cze9f,xeddda,2,Sun Jul 12 04:12:15 2015 UTC,"yes the difference between 65 and 90 matters, but its not an insurmountable wall.  if you go for hard mode you might be looking at about 2-3 times more sorties for the EO maps (this is still way doable) and 30-50% more sorties for the normal maps than you would have with higher level ships, taking all 65 vs 90 as a baseline.  ofc this is heavily depended on the actual difficulty of the event, and that theres no telling until it actually starts, but from the ships I can see levels on I wouldnt be too worried."
kancolle,3cze9f,Adatia,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:20:08 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer. I'll eventually get them to around average level 80 but I was just aiming to get as many Kai Ni as possible between the events.
kancolle,3cze9f,Atear,2,Sun Jul 12 05:43:24 2015 UTC,"What about your CV's? As a rule of thumb it's best to have at LEAST 5 kai ni and/or high leveled ships of any particular class of ship. Your CAV's look good, maybe level a few more. CA's are in good condition, Destroyers are also looking good, same with CL's (maybe level them up a little more, especially Naka). Would also be helpful to know what the state of your BB's is currently in. As it stands now, you should do fine on Medium, and struggle a little on Hard. It also depends on what your resources are at, but I'm sure you know that."
kancolle,3cze9f,Atear,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:04:24 2015 UTC,"My CVs and BBs are doing better than the ships I posted here, so I didn't mention them because I wasn't worried about them being underleveled as much.   Here are my CVs and BBs and resources at the moment  Battleships+BBV  CVs  Resources"

kancolle,3cze9f,funicode,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, the difference between 65 and 90 matters for accuracy, and more importantly avoidability (along with LoS and ASW but they don't matter as much). I would try to get at least 5 ships of each class (except CL, which can be done with 3) to 70 or higher, and you should be fine assuming no insane ship locking. Your CVLs are looking weak though. Should level at least 3 or 4 of them 70+."
kancolle,3cze9f,madharuhi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:00:48 2015 UTC,"It depends on your opponent.  A level 50 ship has 115% accuracy and 57% dodging, level 70 has 118%/65%, level 90 has 122%/70%. (numbers only estimates)  Suppose your target has accuracy/dodging of 100%/50%, a level 70 ship will have 115-50=65% chance of hitting and 100-(100-53)=53% chance of dodging. A level 90 ship will have 122-50=72% hit and 100-(100-70)=70% dodge, this is a 10% increase in hitting and 32% increase in dodging relatively compared to the level 70 ship.  For a tougher opponent of 120%/70%, the level 70 has 100-70=30% hit and 100-(120-53)=33% dodge and the level 90 has 122-70=52% hit and 100-(120-70)=50%. This is a relative increase of 73% and 51% in accuracy and dodging.  In conclusion, the tougher the enemy is, the more important are levels. If you're going to clear the event on Normal, then you won't see much difference between high/low level ships. If you're going to do it on Hard, your lower level ships will perform much worse."

kancolle,3cu8kg,TomVP46,2,Sat Jul 11 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you like to play and what ships you get.  I personally like waiting for the timer because I enjoy the added suspense (for that same reason I keep the ship name hidden on KCV).  Some ships from LSC have pretty short timers too so there's no real need to instant build them if they're 90 minutes or less.  If you get a 4+ hour timer though and don't want to wait then feel free to instant build it.  One thing to keep in mind is instant building an LSC ship requires 10 flamethowers instead of just one, so if you do a lot of LSC and instant build all of them you can actually run out.  Realistically though, unless you're spam building several ships a day you should never run out of flamethrowers, so don't feel like you have to save them."

kancolle,3cvj7l,Radmiral,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:01:23 2015 UTC,The worst outcome is that you don't get Kongou but end up with a bunch of leveled up cruisers and CVLs.
kancolle,3cvj7l,Akane_Tsunemori,3,Sat Jul 11 19:24:03 2015 UTC,Cry KONGOU DESS everytime that drop notification appears.

kancolle,3cvj7l,Zeen172,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"honestly, you would have better luck getting a kongou class using the minimum lsc recipe. 400/400/600/30 should be renamed to the CA recipe."
kancolle,3cvj7l,etaribi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:42:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I just threw out a random recipe that would possibly craft Kongou lol.

Its fine to keep farming 3-2a for attempts for Kongou, while leveling ships. Its just RNG-Sama doesnt want you to have her at the moment. Try sacrificing some Naka's to RNG-Sama. Other then 3-2a i would say maybe 4-3 would be a fine place to get some Kongou class while leveling DDs and CLs there."

kancolle,3cvj7l,Gurutsu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:24:09 2015 UTC,"I got Kongou from 4-3 grinding which I feel has overall better drop rates than 3-2. If you absolutely cannot find her, the first few maps of the event are usually littered with semi-rare drops like Kongou class."

kancolle,3cu4fb,Gurutsu,2,Fri Jul 10 20:09:35 2015 UTC,It's normal just means you dont have loaded the assets for that girl yet. next time you make the same ship there will be art. Also tend to reset after patch so dont freak out when you get invisi ships after one xd

kancolle,3cu4fb,funicode,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:52:53 2015 UTC,The game loads images only when you encounter the ship for the first time (since you last cleared cache).  This loading may timeout and leave you with that empty space. It's frustrating when you want to take a screenshot but otherwise harmless.
kancolle,3cu4fb,Dr__Horrible,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"Happens to me a lot, no real issue. It has to do with loading the particular image and timing out I believe."

kancolle,3cs4hk,solruki,5,Fri Jul 10 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"Having read this series though whatever the directors can think of will probably pale in comparison.  Let's just get a non-rushed, non-ass pulled Deus Ex Machina story first. Or scrap that altogether and just make it SoL. Baby steps."

kancolle,3cs4hk,Enjoyer_of_Cake,4,Fri Jul 10 13:26:17 2015 UTC,"All of th Fate animu is based on different routes of one visual novel, iirc.  Not the case with kancolle because kancolle has no plot at all."
kancolle,3cs4hk,senaya,5,Fri Jul 10 09:58:04 2015 UTC,"Fate/Zero is its own work that happens prior to Fate/Stay Night. Fate/Stay Night branches into 3 different routes, though would most likely follow the same prologue.  For KanColle's case, what's there to really prologue aside from more battles. If kanmusu can show visible aging (not through remodels), then that could work."
kancolle,3cs4hk,Tsukuruya,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:25:57 2015 UTC,I still don't quite understand how shipgirls work. Some of them are old enough to drink alcohol (same as humans) yet they eat ammo (Yuudachi's line about full belly after restock)
kancolle,3cs4hk,senaya,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:47:12 2015 UTC,"They're girls, man, but they've got the souls of ships, maaaan. Ship souls. That's how it is.  What the hell is a ship's soul, you ask, and how did the girls come to have them? The anime doesn't bother to even try to think about it, so it's probably best just written off imo."
kancolle,3cs4hk,HiroariStrangebird,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really care about animu, tryin to figure stuff out of the game."
kancolle,3cs4hk,senaya,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:38:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. In that case, the game doesn't really touch on it either, but it's more clear that really they're just actual ships - you build them with steel, resupply them with fuel, repair them in a dry dock rather than a bathtub (I mean really that's just silly). The girl part is just that they're anthropomorphized; I'm not sure it's worth thinking too much about that either, but I'm amused by the thought that the admiral is actually hallucinating the whole girl thing due to overwork and the stress of constant combat. Not sure how the alcohol ties into that, though. Maybe part of the refueling process?"
kancolle,3cs4hk,HiroariStrangebird,2,Sun Jul 12 02:14:47 2015 UTC,Idk which one first came out first (kancolle or arpeggio) but I think it would be more or less same as arpeggio if it had serious story line. so I think I would stick to the slice of life...and pls no more of those destiny stuff..
kancolle,3cs4hk,tjdqhr1225,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:47:35 2015 UTC,"Arpeggio predates Kancolle by three years, but I agree. The two series are only similar in girls are ships, but why make that line blurry at all?"

The battle info before the battle even starts, letting me know how many planes each of my carriers have mid sortie, how many planes are lost and everything else it lets me know, incredibly useful."

KCV didn't provide me with that level of info during a sortie, along with individual quest/mission component progress. If KCV has been updated to provide all that info then I may switch back, but given how I can customize EO and the info it provides, KCV needs to add a lot from when I last used it."
kancolle,3cr4qa,NicolaosGreene,2,Fri Jul 10 10:20:40 2015 UTC,"So EO individually tracks things like BW1? Also a few quick questions on the UI you have there. In the bottom left section: I assume the numbers next to the slots to be the plane counts since I think those line up for Abukuma, Fusuo, Junyou, and Isuzu respectively. I would guess that the green plane would be fighter power and the yellow plane would be LoS then? What does it say it next to the green ship up there (if you know)? Also what do the yellow X shaped things next to the ships names mean?  As a side note do you know if EO is open sourced? Sorry for all the questions and thanks for your time!"

The Green plane is indeed fighterpower and the yellow is LoS currently on 2-5 setting. I believe it just says on sortie next to the green ship, i'm not the best at reading kanji. Yellow X is if it's sparkled or not. The morale number is next to it before the health. Yes it is open sourced, on git. https://github.com/andanteyk/ElectronicObserver"

kancolle,3cr4qa,WinnieY,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:49:12 2015 UTC,Well naturally actually getting said boss kills is subject to RNG but being able to check without having to enter the map can be a handy feature and one that I had enjoyed in the yuyuvn fork of KCV. That is why I was curious if EO had also implemented the same functionality.
kancolle,3cr4qa,LacusClyne,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:38:50 2015 UTC,I just checked this one out and it's quite amazing how it works with all those features! However do you need to log in everytime on DMM when you open EO? Or maybe using API link? I tried earlier on and it asked me to log in on DMM whenever i closed the program and get back in.

You'll definitely want more Type 3 shells though, another 2~3 more (10/90/90/30 with BB secretary).  Not exactly related to 4-5 in particular but do yourself a favor and start crafting AP shells if you don't have a single one; they will come in handy. Since you already have Saiun, cut your recipe down to 20/20/10/90 or 20/60/10/100 instead. The former is a Reppuu-focus, while the latter gives you Ryuusei Kai and Suisei 12A as well (neither will give you Saiun as you need 110 bauxite for it).  Level all four Kongou-class ships to Kai Ni, it never hurts to have them ready to sortie any time considering fleet locking's a thing. Having them at Kai Ni gives you some goodies through quests as well.  Since you have both Nagato and Mutsu, you should do the quest chain which gives you two Type 1 AP shells.  Level both CLTs more since they're just fantastic whenever the map allows for them (as long as the boss isn't a land installation type).  ※typo on recipe"
kancolle,3cp8f2,madharuhi,2,Fri Jul 10 02:29:32 2015 UTC,"you should change your recipe for the reppuus/other planes to, 20/20/10/60, or 20/60/10/110. Also, idk if imgur is down or something but i cant view your pictures atm. so, i will come back later. :P"

You might want to craft some more Type 3 and Type 91 AP shells, maybe 2-3 of each.  As for 4-5 you could complete it with the ships you have but it can  be prone to RNG.  For pre-boss BB/CA(V)/CA(V)/CA(V)/CV/CV is fairly effective while not being too heavy on resources, however you need to equip the BB and CA's with Type 3 shells to do significant damage to the boss.

CLTs and BB help alleviate part of the pain but sometimes RNG can still do you in. There's still some time and is definitely enough to patch up the light ship situation, DDs in particular.  CV and CVLs could need some leveling. CVLs aren't as important but it's almost as though you don't have a single usable CVL.  Equipment looks fine, maybe an extra Reppuu or two if you want to. Improve more main guns (20.3cm no.2/3, 35.6cm, 41cm, 381mm/50 Kai) moderately. Would be nice to have a 10cm HA+FD around but you'll need some leveling on Fubuki for that."

kancolle,3cnrj9,senaya,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:45:33 2015 UTC,"3-5 is really dependent on your luck with RNG. At HQ level 65 I was able to full clear 3-5 with Yuudachi, Shigure, Jintsuu at Kai Ni and 3 other DDs, each around level 50. Each DD had two normal guns and as many radars as I currently had. I think 2 or 3? And I didn't use any boilers.  So it's definitely possible for your current ships to do 3-5 but you will still be reliant on good RNG. Higher level ships and more Kai Nis will reduce the chances of getting screwed by RNG. So it is probably recommended to level some ships a bit more unless you want to gamble a bit."
kancolle,3cnrj9,neraigo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:06:25 2015 UTC,"I'd also say grind your DDs so that they're kai ni and stats maxed out.  Also add Jintsu to the kai ni list, since she has one of the best fire power of all CLs."
kancolle,3cnrj9,Jnglmpera,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:11:49 2015 UTC,"The most difficult part of 3-5 with a 1CL 5DD composition in my opinion is getting to the boss node in one piece. More often than not, it's the pre-boss nodes that send you home with the closing torps. To mitigate this, higher ship levels and sparkling would be help. That said, your ship levels are fine. Perhaps level some of your top DDs (Hibiki, Ayanami and Fubuki) to Kai Ni to improve your odds. Modernise Sendai fully too.   As for equipment, boilers aren't really needed for 3-5. Your lack of radars might make it slightly challenging, as giving your DDs torpedoes would set them up for cut-in during night battle, of which only Shigure (thanks to her high luck) would benefit from. I suppose if one of your DDs can snipe the boss that would be good."

This operations are reset each month, so you have plenty of time to clean at least 3-4. With you levels you should be able to clean 4-3 and 4-4 without much of the problem, just check wiki for fleet composition and branching rules. Yes you can do LSC resource wise. The best approach for LSC is go for Bismark first as it usually harder to craft, you will get Yamatos and other girls in process as byproduct of Bismark attempts. You can craft Bismark only with Z1 as flagman. Z1 is a quest reward for D8 quest completion, I recommend to start working on this quest chain (see on wiki). Fleet composition:   Level Kitakami to level 50 and remodel here. Farm subs, you need at least 3  for efficient 2-3 clean and Z1 quests. Level more CAs, Maya and Tone class, Tone class is good as they remodels into best CAV in game. Level more CLs: Kiso, Sendai + other Sendai sisters. Kiso is remodels into CLT which is super value."

Set some goals first.   The summer event won't be until early August so you will have plenty of time to stockpile before then. Taking a shot at LSC isn't a bad idea. And resources are one thing, but you'll also need a highly leveled and diverse fleet to do well in the event. Check out this event preparation guide for detailed info about it.

I recommend at least 5-6 reliable DDs. Fubuki, Ayanami, Yukikaze are all great in my opinion.   Gaining AS on most maps could be difficult, so i would recommend getting more Reppus or Shiden Kai's if you can. 2/2/1/9 is a good recipe.   I guess you dont have Yamato or Musashi, which isnt a big deal. But mostly having FBBs might limit you a bit. (but its still not a big deal)  You have Taihou (i hate you) and Kaga so your find for most maps that have high AS requirements (But i would still recommend more Reppuus) But you seem to lack on CVLs so that MIGHT/MAYBE/ITS POSSIBLE problem for branching. Junyou kai ni is nice, but stuff like Ryuujou kai ni can help with their irregular plane slots (IE making it easier to meet AS requirements)  Overall your fleet isnt bad and probably could do hard modes if you really wanted.

kancolle,3cjr6d,Lord_Blaze,3,Wed Jul 8 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"Don't used mixed cut-in. Use either 2x gun + radar/engine or 3x torps/2x torp+skilled lookout. (only for high luck). Since 3-5 doesn't have highly armored boss, 3x torp cut-in isn't really recommended as nighttime DA does the job and activates all the time.  Just switch the torps on fubuki, mutsuki and yuudachi with radars or engines. Also if u have excess radars, equip Sendai with a radar instead of the plane since he can't artillery spot with no AS, and radars give more accuracy. Night scout is also not needed as ur ships shld be able to 1 shot enemies in NB, crit or not.  Edit: also DDs getting torped to red/orange at node 1/2 is normal. Just pray RNG is in your favor and you dodge them or disable at least the CLTs. The only thing u can do is equip engines, or level them up for the slight evasion bonuses, or use akashi to upgrade guns for +FP so you chuuha enemy ships for often. Sparkling your DDs may also help."
kancolle,3cjr6d,dasaher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:43:49 2015 UTC,"Cut in/double attack only applies to the night battle though, right? I end up dying at the first node during the day, thats why I threw in the torps (more defense)  Also I'm out of baux to craft more radars, I blew like 25k trying to get small radars so that one is all I have. I have plenty of large sized ones though, so I'll swap out Sendai's gear."
kancolle,3cjr6d,dasaher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, so your main issues is getting torped to red, i guess? If so there's little you can do. It's 100% RNG tbh. Some months I clear it in 6 runs, some months I clear the map in over 15 runs because Yuudachi likes getting hit by a 25 damage torp. Are you using Line Ahead formation? It gives 100% shelling damage so you have a higher chance to Chuuha the enemy ships so they don't get to torp you."
kancolle,3cjr6d,madharuhi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, line ahead. Thats why I've been trying to craft boilers, but at this point I want to start stockpiling for the event so I dont know how worth it it is."
kancolle,3cjr6d,AlmaElma,2,Wed Jul 8 14:03:17 2015 UTC,Not really worth it since you get diminished returns for evasion above 38. Boilers are by far one of the worse equipment in the game because of how evasion works.

kancolle,3cjr6d,senaya,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:09:04 2015 UTC,DD's be 2x10cm HA + radar or 2 red guns + radar. type 22 or 33 best choice.  Unless they are a high luck DD which you would do a CI setup 3x torps or 2 torps + star shell. None of those 5 are an option for this.  CL is ok with 2 red guns (20.3cm no.2 preferably) + night plane.  The ending torpedo phase is all luck. sometimes you go through with no damage or  multiple will go red.
kancolle,3cjr6d,hk_th,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:48:11 2015 UTC,"What formation are you using on the in route nodes? if you arent using line ahead try switching to that it should help you eat less torpedoes in the end phase.

kancolle,3cjr6d,LeginFS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:10:06 2015 UTC,Just stick to DA. There isn't any reason to use CI in 3-5 at all since you can punch through the boss flagship's armor with even DA while moderately damaged. The radars will also help you hit more often so that you can lower the number of torpedo shots through damaging enemy ships.  Higher-leveled and better DDs would help with accuracy and firepower too. Ships like Mutsuki... just don't really cut it since you need a good deal more luck to reach the boss.  15.2cm on CL's good enough for that map too.
kancolle,3cjr6d,mumei-chan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"Give 2CL 4DD a go. My go-to fleet for 3-5 is Yuudachi, Shigure, Yukikaze, Fubuki, Sendai, Jintsuu and it works out very well."
kancolle,3cjjtx,BW_Yodo,4,Wed Jul 8 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"You should generally use line ahead 95% of the time since offence is the best defence. Double line is mainly a placebo, I'd use it only when my fleet has no reasonable chance to sink a fleet during day battle even with line ahead. E.g. 3-2 preboss node with BBs.   Diamond formation is useful only in the nodes where there is no shelling phase. Right now there is only one such node in the game at 1-6. They might come back during events though. AS and AACI are the best methods to protect vs. air attacks.  You should use line abreast when dealing with subs. Echelon is supposed to be a defensive position for subs but the only time I remember using it is while clearing 5-3 with subs. I later switched to line ahead and cleared it with a non-sub fleet anyway.  Getting AS is the main purpose of the carriers, opening strike and shelling damage are a bonus. Getting AS is very important and should be a priority. AS+ is most of the time tricky to get without sacrificing too much and it doesn't really provide that much of a bonus."
kancolle,3cjjtx,AlmaElma,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:36:11 2015 UTC,Thank you
kancolle,3cjjtx,Adatia,3,Wed Jul 8 12:48:26 2015 UTC,"Use line ahead all the time unless you are dealing with subs. no dont use it. Anti air isnt very good, the only exception might be air battle nodes. yes you want AS or you cant get artillery spotting for your other ships, it will heavily out damage what the carriers would with more attack planes."
kancolle,3cjjtx,kyuurin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:32:46 2015 UTC,"Thx, I used double line in 50% of battles =("
kancolle,3cjjtx,Arkeyy,2,Wed Jul 8 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"Line ahead is mostly the safe choice even against carriers because of the higher damage which helps hitting them to medium damage. Double line is mostly useful against fleets that have surface ships and submarines because it still deals good enough damage while allowing your girls to hit subs harder. Some other reasons for double line are higher accuracy (when you don't need the added damage) and higher flapship protection (when you need a squishier ship for branching). Unless it's a pure air battle node (e.g. on 1-6 or event maps) there's not much reason to use diamond. You may have higher AA but you're crippling your fleets damage output.  It depends. For the most cases, AS is the better choice because of artillery spotting. However sometimes you just have one node with one formation with stupidly high fighter power, so settling for parity on that node to preserve damage on the other nodes is an option too."

Stockpiling is a phase where you're done your training and crafting for the event and only do your quests and PvP. The only sortie you'd run are sparkling for expeditions and sub runs through 2-3 to minimize the resources spent on the daily sortie quests. Since you're still a new player you wouldn't really have more than a week's worth of stockpiling because you need to train and craft a lot more than the older players."

Though AL/MI brutal difficulty was from E6, which needs 10 clean kills to complete plus evil kaga + 2 dysons (which is pretty much Spring E6, also very brutally trollish even without the 10 clean kills mind you).

kancolle,3ch85f,senaya,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:48 2015 UTC,Can reddit automatically add [Misc] to threads without tags instead of deleting them?
kancolle,3ch85f,senaya,7,Tue Jul 7 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but by automatically removing untagged posts, it informs the reader to correctly tag it.    Going directly to Misc or Not Tagged leaves no repercussion to not tagging. Removal puts responsibility on the user to go back and correctly tag to help organize the sub and give it pretty colours.    In addition, the Miscellaneous tag is already used for miscellaneous content."
kancolle,3ch85f,Ladycardboard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:14:15 2015 UTC,Got it.
kancolle,3ch85f,AlmaElma,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for understanding.
kancolle,3ch85f,DrNagatocchi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Do we tag it in the title of the thread or somewhere in the post itself? I'm assuming title.
kancolle,3ch85f,papperation,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:42:38 2015 UTC,In the title. I've added a small help text under the submission text box that shows the tags and an example.
kancolle,3ch85f,papperation,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably not working the way you want it to work. Right now it's doubling so we have (Tag) then the same tag in post title in brackets. Discussion [Discussion], I'm sure you'll understand what I'm talking about if you look on the front page. That honestly doesn't look that good."
kancolle,3ch85f,Deculsion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:03:51 2015 UTC,"That's intentional. The way the Automoderator works is by looking for the specific tag name, then assigning the link flair to it. In the next few days, I'll look into moving the flair to the rightmost side (at the edge of the post, not just the right of the text) to make it look cleaner."
kancolle,3ch85f,papperation,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"Can we do something to cut down on the amount of ""hey I kai ni'd this ship"" or ""hey look at what ship I got"" they're very spammy. Also marriage."
kancolle,3ch85f,DrNagatocchi,7,Wed Jul 8 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with your statement to some extent, you do kind of have to look at the state of the subreddit as a whole when addressing this. Compared to other subreddits which can be really cluttered with achievement or RNG posts like /r/PuzzleAndDragons or any app/game that has some amount of RNG, our community here is rather quite small and really does not get that many submissions as a whole. There really isn't that much activity overall in terms of posts/discussions and doesn't imo, need the curbing of achievement screenshots. Maybe when we grow as a subreddit in the future, but right now I don't really feel like there's a big problem."
kancolle,3ch85f,papperation,5,Wed Jul 8 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"This is why I wanted to keep the status quo. A consolidated thread would make the subreddit look barren, which will hurt growth of subscribers."
kancolle,3ch85f,Deculsion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. As of right now, all these posts aren't really hurting anything but show activity on the subreddit. The most easiest fix would probably to make the current sort button to filter out certain types of submissions."
kancolle,3ch85f,_tickles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:53:21 2015 UTC,"I second this notion. As of now, it's is not necessary as it isn't causing any detrimental effect. At most, for now, I'd say to create a function which allows any [Achievement] posts to be hidden if it was possible. Otherwise, I see no reason to take any action as of yet."
kancolle,3ch85f,DrNagatocchi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:09:14 2015 UTC,"This would probably be the best solution as of now. I do believe that we have an ability to sort posts right now, but not exclude them."
kancolle,3ch85f,_tickles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"4 of the posts on the front page right now are posts like the ones I wouldn't like, they don't contriubute anything, it's not like they introduce any discussion at all."
kancolle,3ch85f,DrNagatocchi,3,Wed Jul 8 02:25:08 2015 UTC,"Even so, I would rather there be SOMETHING on the front page than having no new posts at all. From what I've seen with other smaller subreddits, if there is at least some sort of recent activity, new people are more inclined to try and join the community rather than just lurking around. The option that /u/Deculsion suggested in his other post would probably fix your issue with the front page submissions."
kancolle,3ch85f,labmember_001,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"But neither does it take away from anything. Why take action against something that does no harm to the majority?

People get excited and post after they achieve something and to hamper that wouldn't be very rule 5. On the other hand, yes they are very spammy and should be dealt with. Maybe I'll make a vote on how to deal with this. Currently, I have three solutions:      Outright remove them Consolidated Achievement thread Keep status quo   All the choices have their ups and downs, so I'd like some community feedback on this."
kancolle,3civut,Federer343,2,Wed Jul 8 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"The 90mm works just like a 12.7cm Twin High-angle Mount + Anti-Aircraft Fire Director.  So for any AACI setup that requires that 12.7cm, the 90mm can replace it and proc AACI."
kancolle,3civut,CruzSchiffer,2,Wed Jul 8 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"90mm HA works the same like 12.7cm HA Fire-Director. Not to mention, it's upgradable with Akashi Improvement Arsenal. The best HA gun for non-DD ships  But it will be much better if you also grind Maya K2  http://puu.sh/iRkrF/0257fee58b.jpg"
kancolle,3civut,Admiral_Mikan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:30:08 2015 UTC,"I'm grinding her right now and I should maybe get her to kai ni before the event, hard to tell atm.  But you still think even with having the stock AACI on Maya that it's worth the blueprint to get the 90mm as well?"
kancolle,3civut,nekonight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:36:46 2015 UTC,You could always use the 25mm concentrated you get from her kai ni. When you use that on Maya Kai Ni she can do AACI with only another HA mount. That means you still have 2 slots open for a gun and seaplane.
kancolle,3civut,nekonight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:53:02 2015 UTC,"Isn't the advantage of Maya her ability to still use a seaplane while doing AACI? I thought the setup for her is 20.3cm gun, 9cm HA, reconplane, air radar or 20.3cm gun, HA gun, reconplane, 25mm concentrated."
kancolle,3civut,CruzSchiffer,3,Wed Jul 8 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"The former setup shoots down 4 planes per slot, while the latter shoots down 6 planes per slot.  20.3cm + 9cm HA + 25mm Concentrated + Air Radar shoots down 8 planes per slot, so there are downsides to using recon planes."
kancolle,3civut,madharuhi,2,Wed Jul 8 08:00:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you value the unique AACI calls, which are better than the standard AACI setups.  I prefer dropping her artillery spotted attacks if I'm using her in an escort fleet, since escort fleet only gets one shelling round in the day and she still gets to keep double attack at night that way.  Technically speaking, you don't actually need a HA+FD since any secondary HA would work for her unique AACIs. I like 90mm because it can be improved."
kancolle,3civut,Arkeyy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:09:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't used 90mm except for leveling CV in PVP (The Katsuragi role). I would just get bucky and maya to k2 if you want stronger AACI. You would only us 90mm for maya anyway.  As for dealing with enemy CV, I would just secure AS or AS+ if possible and let the DD(Fubuki, or akizuki IF I HAVE HER) handle AACI.  If you plan to use your BP on Littorio/Italia, it would be for: Stronger FBB, OTO for CLT, Pasta gun(only good on Italian IMO)  If you want to use BP for dealing with enemy CV's on the upcoming event, I would just focus on Tone-Class and Fusou-Class."
kancolle,3civut,Seelegewehr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:24:16 2015 UTC,"Get Maya, if you can. She has the best AACI in the game, or so I have been told. Shoots down the most planes per slot."

kancolle,3civut,yamfun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:43:59 2015 UTC,"NO.  IF you have the gun, of course it is good to use it, but if you don't it's not worth a blueprint. Just use Maya's gun, or some 12.7 with FD.  Also, your blueprint will not expire, don't use it because you guess something will happen, you can always wait til the event to do it."
kancolle,3cirty,-Byakushiki-,5,Wed Jul 8 06:03:04 2015 UTC,I found this extremely helpful.
kancolle,3cirty,xeddda,2,Wed Jul 8 06:16:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely not type 91 or 20.3. Type 94 and 20.3 no.2 are the far superior upgrade targets to those equipment. Stick with 35.6 and +6 AP shells, very value and also efficient because the daily pays for the screw."
kancolle,3cirty,Noperative,2,Wed Jul 8 06:18:17 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of useful information I found in other threads that I have bookmarked.  I think they're critical to making informed decisions if you haven't seen them already.  This thread has great information on what exactly the upgrades do.  Tomaranai and HydraGoliath explain how much firepower and accuracy the upgrades add.  This post on Himeuta is very helpful and informative on what is both worthwhile to upgrade and cheap to upgrade.  I'm quite new to Akashi upgrades as well as I only got her about a week ago.  From what I've gathered in no particular order:   10cm HA+AAFD is pretty much the go-to as far first recommendations go.  Don't start from the Type 91 FD though as that's just obscenely expensive.  Get a Type 94 FD from either Maya Kai2 or Fubuki Kai2 and upgrade that. 12.7cm to +4 for your DDs.  It's a very cheap and fairly effective gun as the +4 upgrade gives +2 to firepower and +4 to accuracy. 20.3cm(no.2 and no.3) to +4 for you CA(V)s.  I would stick to these rarer versions instead of the stock 20.3cm guns.  If you don't have any of these and have an excess of screws, I suppose you could maybe upgrade of a couple of the stock versions.  I'd personally rather invest those screws elsewhere though. 35.6cm to +5 for your FBBs.  A cheap and effective way to give them some punch while letting them still use their proper fit guns. Type 91 AP shells to +6.  I'm unclear as to what exactly upgrading the shells does, but I assume it adds firepower and accuracy?  Either way, upgrading to +6 is only 6 screws so it's very cheap.   After those upgrades I'm unsure.  Those are some pretty cheap ways to add some nice punch to your fleets.  I'm aiming to get those done first and then think about what I'll do afterwards.  I'll leave it to those more experienced than me to recommend more luxury upgrades."
kancolle,3cirty,TomVP46,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:30:34 2015 UTC,"Taking your suggestion, as well as the link you and /u/xeddda provided, I upgraded six 12.7cm's to +4 and four Type 91 AP shells to +6. Will be working on the 35.6cms next as the fitment will really help in combined fleet. Many thanks to you guys that replied!"
kancolle,3cirty,madharuhi,2,Wed Jul 8 07:21:15 2015 UTC,"BB: 35.6cm, 41cm, 38cm Kai, 381mm/50 Kai, AP shells All the abovementioned are great to improve on.  CA: 20.3cm (both no.2 and no.3 are great) Firepower is harder to come by, but no.3 is much more scarce compared to no.2. Getting all of them to ★+1 or ★+4 will be a good start.  DD: both 12.7cm and Type B, 10cm HA+FD You already have the 10cm HA+FD from Akizuki so don't bother about the Type 91/94 AAFDs. 10cm HA+FD is the best gun for DDs (and you have Akizuki so you can improve on them), but it takes a lot of screws to make dupes so I consider them low priorities.  CL: Won't know until the event comes, but if I were to make a guess, I would say don't even bother. CLs are pretty much used only if the map actually requires for them (combined fleet in particular) and you mainly need them to just survive.    As for improvement levels, I personally follow what wikiwiki mentions, so a summary from whatever was there:  ★+4 is a great point to aim for since you get +4 accuracy and +2 firepower (+3 for large-caliber guns in the day) from there.  ★+8~9 is the next point to aim for on large-caliber guns (+1 accuracy from ★+8 to ★+9), ★+9 for small/medium guns and AP shells since the 1.0x multiplier means the firepower stays at +2 from ★+4 all the way to ★+8."

kancolle,3cewnz,Atear,4,Tue Jul 7 11:14:23 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I completed 4-4 but the hard part to me was getting to the boss node; I kept getting diverted to the bottom node. The boss node itself was manageable. If you're playing the event on Easy and this is an event map, I'll put it as Easy-Medium, probably the third map from the last event."
kancolle,3cewnz,Tomaranai,2,Tue Jul 7 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"4-4 would be pretty easy, if it wasn't for the lolsorandum fork after the preboss node."
kancolle,3cewnz,WeissRaben,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:33:08 2015 UTC,The thing with events is their difficulty tend to vary a whole lot.  I suppose 4-4 might be about the midrange map like e3 or e4 on medium or easy.
kancolle,3cewnz,Adatia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:28:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it's very hard to compare normal maps to event maps. There's no artillery spotting when 4-4 was added into the game. And the event maps are usually design by the mechanism now, and sometimes some new mechanism will first appear in the event maps. And there's some mechanism that only appears in the normal maps(for example, sub tank in the boss node).  Also the difficulty between event maps is different.  Anyway I think if you have AS, 4-4 should be quite easy, if you ignore the pre-boss node's random compass...."
kancolle,3cewnz,StoneFlame,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:38:15 2015 UTC,"If you dont mind me asking, how exactly did you get all the way to the boss node with just subs? is it random if you dont have the cav/ca with you?"
kancolle,3cewnz,m11220025,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:40:53 2015 UTC,Easy. Even Ru class BB flagship kai is more powerful than her.  Any BB with ap shell can finish her in 1-2shots.
kancolle,3cewnz,madharuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"Medium at best, and that's only because of the deadend.  Pre-boss Ru's can drive you back at times if they target the lighter ships but that's about it; with the appropriate comp there's just one compass spin to win and you'd hit the boss node (which isn't even a challenge by itself, considering people eat that thing for breakfast at 5-4 runs)."
kancolle,3cewnz,kingofquackz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:14:00 2015 UTC,Event maps will not have random deadend compass rolls if you have the right composition so idk if it's comparable.
kancolle,3cewnz,cptdolphin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:34:38 2015 UTC,4-4 would be easy just have to not got trolled by compass which isn't really that bad
kancolle,3cewnz,ryanxwonbin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:23:17 2015 UTC,It would be the equivalent of a Medium E3.
kancolle,3cewnz,Admiral_Mikan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard, actually. It's just compass that always try to troll you"
kancolle,3cewnz,yamfun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:26:51 2015 UTC,It is easy because any maps that can be solved by SSs are easy.

kancolle,3cfghz,Adatia,2,Tue Jul 7 14:37:34 2015 UTC,Akitsumaru have been quite easily farm able in the last few events.  So with any luck you should be able to pick one up on the cheap next month.

kancolle,3camvh,ZeonTwoSix,18,Mon Jul 6 12:25:55 2015 UTC,Would be pretty awkward sortieing Akagi and Enterprise together. They might just stab each other in the back.
kancolle,3camvh,BrokenMn,9,Mon Jul 6 12:36:44 2015 UTC,"Or the Yamato sisters getting pissed at Archerfish for sinking their half-sister, aka /u/Daishomaru's Shipfu... XD"
kancolle,3camvh,Daishomaru,8,Mon Jul 6 12:40:45 2015 UTC,"Enterprise VS Shinano, the epic love triangle for /u/Daishomaru's heart."
kancolle,3camvh,PhaetonsFolly,8,Mon Jul 6 12:44:28 2015 UTC,"With that logic most of the IJN girls would have a problem with Enterprise. Becoming one of the deadliest ships in history is bound to make some enemies.  The only ship that I would feel would have any rivalry with Enterprise would be Zuikaku. Zuikaku took part in Pearl Harbor, sunk Lexington (CV-2), damaged Enterprise in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, damaged Enterprise again in the Battle of Santa Cruz Island, they squared of at the Battle of the Philippine Sea where Zuikaku was damaged, and they fought one last time at the Battle of Leyte Gulf were Zuikaku was sunk (not by Enterprise though)."
kancolle,3camvh,HiroariStrangebird,2,Mon Jul 6 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"For sure. Really, there's just an issue in general with having Allied ships in the fleet. It's kinda hard to envision missions like ""Deploy HMS Hood, Prinz Eugen, and Bismarck, and watch them try to sink each other!"" Much awkwardness ensues."
kancolle,3camvh,Daishomaru,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:09:58 2015 UTC,I would ship them so hard

kancolle,3camvh,Pacoeltaco,4,Mon Jul 6 20:43:51 2015 UTC,You can literally see Hornet's nips on her art.
kancolle,3camvh,Canadian_Bacon1994,7,Mon Jul 6 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"Assuming that Kancolle follows an alternative timeline/universe, what would happen if an IJN and an USN ship are sortied together? From their lines ingame they seem to aware their past life as a real ship, wouldn't that make the USN ships their sworn enemy - even in the kanmusu form?"
kancolle,3camvh,Pacoeltaco,15,Mon Jul 6 13:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think they could play it along like how the world is today. The war is long over and Japan and USA are pretty much on friendly terms. Plus, the game is set in the future where the Abyssals are threatening mankind altogether. They could just wing it like a shounen battle manga/anime on how ""yesterday's enemies are today's friends"".  Well, I'm just saying this because I want to see USN carriers with bald eagles. And Yorktown getting along with Hiryuu."
kancolle,3camvh,Canadian_Bacon1994,7,Mon Jul 6 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"This seems like a perfect narrative to me. Depending on how you perceive this universe(there are a lot of interpretations) there is no reason to say that ship girls from around the world wouldn't get along.   I think it would be more interesting to see some development along those lines. Have Bismarck and Hood meet; Enterprise and the other Midway carriers with Akagi etc. Hey, they don't need to get along, but they don't have to be enemies either.   If we assume the abyssals are a global phenomenon, then if Germany and Italy have gained ship girls, there is no reason other countries wouldn't either.   Well thats my take. I agree with ya Fluke. :D"

kancolle,3camvh,Abedeus,2,Tue Jul 7 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"Probably make some sorties in a mirror location in which they fight new abyssals of japanese ships, as if to say that everyone has a negative counterpart attacking humanity."

kancolle,3camvh,Banshy52,5,Tue Jul 7 19:49:18 2015 UTC,They'll probably treat each other as rivals. It would be fun to see them go at each other in a non-hostile manner. Imagine the fanbooks and doujins. ;)
kancolle,3camvh,BloodySteel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Remember that some of the IJN ships either collided with others and sank them (as 4koma makes fun of it very often), have been sunk by submarines and therefore hate/distrust them or were attacked accidentally by friendlies (one of the Kongou sisters I think)."
kancolle,3camvh,Banshy52,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:03:45 2015 UTC,This. Literally KC's biggest problem with USN ships.
kancolle,3camvh,PhaetonsFolly,2,Mon Jul 6 14:11:01 2015 UTC,All allied ships really. The new Italian ships would hate British and U.S. ships. Honestly any allied nation who was a big contender in the battles of the Atlantic/Pacific would be tricky.
kancolle,3camvh,tistorm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:30:09 2015 UTC,Especially since Kadokawa is making all the recent events basing on some real events like AL/MI. What's next if there is gonna be allied ships in the game? USN only fleet attack on Pearl Harbor? HMS ships invading their own prison Australia?
kancolle,3camvh,PhaetonsFolly,2,Mon Jul 6 15:14:07 2015 UTC,Oh god a Pearl Harbor based mission wouldn't go over too well.
kancolle,3camvh,tistorm,0,Mon Jul 6 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind if they also included the Allied naval bombardment of mainland Japan.  Edit: My original comment looks to be much more salty then I was originally intending. KanColle has already included many operations which were clearly inspired from the IJN's offensives throughout WW2. It doesn't seem too much of a stretch to include operations from the Allied perspective. Hell, they can even use operations that occurred in Europe if they really wanted to. The idea that any video game is attached to some country's perceived nationalism is absurd, nor does it seem to me to be a good reason to limit the scope the game could reach."
kancolle,3camvh,PhaetonsFolly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"I'd have no problem with this. The question is, would the Japanese players be cool with that?"
kancolle,3camvh,GraveRobberJ,2,Tue Jul 7 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"I find it ridiculous at how prevalent the belief is that Japanese players would be so thin skinned. I've killed more than my fair share of Americans playing video games over the years, and that hasn't been a problem. The game will be fine as long as they don't try to put any nationality over the other.  The geographic problems within the world itself would make any attack on the mainland problematic, but I think they could easily pull off another campaign from the Allied perspective. I know I'll bombard Pearl Harbor if the becomes an event."
kancolle,3camvh,PhaetonsFolly,2,Tue Jul 7 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"To be very blunt, Japanese anime/video game/etc fans seem to lose their shit over all sorts of stuff. I think the reason that more of us aren't pissed about playing an event last year where we essentially reversed the result of our greatest naval battle ever is that the people who are obsessed enough with cute girls to play KanColle in the first place aren't going to be turned off by this. I've talked to a few laypeople who thought the very idea of KanColle was problematic. Those people have already self-selected themselves out of the pool of KanColle players, so they'll never be around to even notice that AL/MI is a thing.  On the other hand, the Japanese players signed up for cute girls and naval battle simulations. As of now, there is no expectation that they will simulate a (historically accurate) Okinawa/Iwo Jima/whatever. I think many of the level headed people will be fine with that, but plenty of them might lose their shit, since frankly, 2D fans aren't exactly known for our levelheadedness, stability, and intelligence."
kancolle,3camvh,JudgeRicand,2,Tue Jul 7 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"Japan is in a very precarious situation. China is rising in power and appears to be attempting to gain control of the region. Japan would most likely suffer under a Chinese hegemony so there is a push in the country to increase the power of its military and to release the self-defense restrictions their constitution imposes. This position also appeals to nationalist who would like to see Japan hold a more prominent position in the Pacific and recognize a strong military is key to achieve that goal.  The Empire of Japan treated its citizens horribly, and militarization and ultranationalism are key reasons the lead to WW2 and caused Japan to waste so many lives and resources when it was clear nothing good would come of it. It is in reaction to this that people such as Hayao Miyazaki are such pacifist and appose anything that could be seen a militaristic or nationalistic.  KanColle has to tow the line of avoiding providing praise or ridicule for Imperial Japan to avoid making a controversy from either side. It also has to avoid appearing to promote nationalism or militarism. The game can't avoid history seeping in, so it is obvious that the Abyssals are Americans. The IJN fought the USN so it only make sense. A focus on history without casting judgement will not produce any real controversy.  KanColle's biggest problem is that they are too successful for their own good. The game is a runaway hit and is surprisingly well known even outside of Japan. The developers were only focused on making the game successful, but it doesn't look like they have a plan to capitalize on how crazy of a success they have. Anybody who's played World of Warships has heard of Kantai Collection, and I imagine some of them would give the game a try if it was easy to get outside Japan.  Japan will always be the base group for KanColle, just like how Russia is the base group for World of Tanks. However, KanColle could find even more success if they expand into other countries and entice foreign players by adding foreign ships. KanColle has run through most of IJN's ships so new content will need to come from elsewhere.  USN shipgirls would only be a problem if the developers make it a problem. They just need to give the American ship girls' focus destroy the Abyssals and only have them make minor references to their historic exploits, just like they did for the Japanese shipgirls."
kancolle,3camvh,tistorm,0,Tue Jul 7 07:05:22 2015 UTC,Rather than being bitter over a past conflict wouldn't a more productive narrative be working together to protect the existing world?
kancolle,3camvh,theLogicality,-1,Mon Jul 6 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"The Chinese knockoff of KanColle has Japanese, American, British, French, German, Italian, Chinese and Russian ships so I don't see why the original game can't.  Being enemies doesn't mean you automatically hate the other person. Erwin Rommel earned the respect of the Allies through his chivalrous conduct throughout WW2. KanColle could also push the message that past grievances doesn't mean you can't be friends today.  Edit: I would like to point out that I don't condone the use of the Chinese Knockoff, I will say that it does some things better than KanColle. The inclusion of ships from all around the world is one of them."
kancolle,3camvh,Dunk-Master-Flex,6,Mon Jul 6 18:51:59 2015 UTC,Only if the Battleships talk in their regional dialects. USS Tennessee/Alabama? Better have some twang. USS New Jersey? Fuhgeddabahdit. You get the idea.

kancolle,3camvh,okizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly this is an idea I've been kicking around in the back of my head for a while. I want to see if there's any interest in /r/kancolle to build a team to make it. I personally don't have the technical chops to do it, but I can certainly carve out some free time to get this project started."
kancolle,3camvh,ByronicAsian,6,Thu Jul 9 00:34:42 2015 UTC,"I have to say while I would love to see the U.S.N in the game I don't like the design for the USS-New Jersey. She is the most decorated battleship in our entire fleet, albeit that many of those decorations came after WWII. She was always the flagship during WWII so I expected more of a commander look."
kancolle,3camvh,ByronicAsian,2,Mon Jul 6 14:43:33 2015 UTC,I would have North Carolina be the commander for the USN girls. She had the most battle starts of any American battleship in WW2. She took part in every offensive campaign in the Pacific (excluding the Alaskan one).

kancolle,3camvh,Lenfried,3,Mon Jul 6 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"The only legitimate complaint I see against including USN shipgirls would be game balance. American ships tended to outclass their Japanese peers at almost ever point, especially when the USN got ships that were built during the war. The quick fix would be to nerf USN girls to the levels of the IJN girls."
kancolle,3camvh,k9catforce,2,Mon Jul 6 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"While USN BBs/CVs are probably a no-go for that reason, I could see a few situations being balanced while still maintaining some semblance of historical accuracy:  USN CAs: because they never carried torpedo tubes, even if they were given a higher firepower, they would still be sidegrades to IJN CAs due to Kancolle mechanics. Des Moines class in particular would be an awesome addition as another AA-focused CA (bonus: they never actually fought against the Japanese).  USN DDs: with their vastly inferior torpedo armament and focus on ASW, they could be useful without out-shining IJN DDs in straight-up combat.  EDIT: USN Frigates (FF/PF) would also be great ""trophy"" type ships; they'd only be useful in ASW, but as an event-only rare ship, they'd slot in pretty well imo."
kancolle,3camvh,Jaynight,3,Mon Jul 6 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"I feel BBs would be the easiest to integrate because there really weren't that many differences between American and Japanese BBs. It would only be unbalanced if the Iowa-class was able to get Thomahawk Missiles.  CVs would be the challenge to integrate. Enterprise would get the ability to attack at night (either at kai or kai ni) so she doesn't need any other bonuses. It's the airplane count that is the problem. Enterprise carried as many planes as Kaga, and the Essex-class carried even more (Lexington [CV-16] carried 110). I love the Essex-class, but I would understand if only prewar USN shipgirls were included.  Frigates was a Royal Navy ship classification, the United States referred to them as Destroyer Escorts. They're the same thing but I'm not an American if I don't say they're not. I would love for those ships to be included, especially USS Artherton. She destroyed one U-boat off the cost of Rhode Island, helped stand up Japan's Maritime Self Defense force as JDS Hatsuhi, and now serves in the Philippine Navy as BRP Rajah Humabon. The only combat ship in WW2 to still serve in a combat capacity now."

Outside of all that a lot of Japanese Kancolle players seem content with how things are now, partly considering Kancolle when you look at all the old events is just a retelling of WW2 where the Japanese navy does not get completely destroyed. It's a shame as I'd like to see ships from all sides but this is the way they want to do it..."

kancolle,3ca37h,EasyToGuess,2,Mon Jul 6 08:02:13 2015 UTC,BBVs more important IMO.  Bismarck's torps will rarely ever do anything so it just makes her a bit stronger during the night.  The BBV k2s are useful because of that high plane slot that can let you get AS if carriers are restricted or unwanted for more firepower. (Maps that come to mind are the 5-1 slow BB monthly and 4-5.)
kancolle,3ca37h,GoldenCrater,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:11:05 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Guess I'll just kai her and wait until after the event.
kancolle,3ca37h,Jaynight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:17:20 2015 UTC,"Bismarck is completely useless without using 2 BPs on her, where she then turns into a guaranteed spot in almost every fleet. There's a good reason you see her in a lot of escort fleets on combined fleet maps (BB damage during the day, CA damage during the night).  I would recommend you don't spend any BPs until after the event has started, as the event will give out some medals which could give you enough for a 3rd BP before the end of it. It may be the case that a BBV is important early on, or the second and third maps could be combined fleet where Bismarck really shines."

kancolle,3ca37h,Noperative,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:00:31 2015 UTC,One thing I dont understand is why Fubuki is considered a good AA-cutin ship at her kai ni considering her luck is low and that would reduce the chances of AA-cutin from happening. Am I just missing some information on why she a vital AA-cutin girl other than the fact she brings rare equips? Is it better to just slap the gear on a high luck dd like Yukikaze?
kancolle,3ca37h,Jaynight,4,Mon Jul 6 19:13:29 2015 UTC,Luck doesn't affect AA cut-in. The AA stat affects the chance it activates.  Fubuki isn't the best for AACI but she comes with a type 94 FD and is also required to upgrade to 10cm+FD via Akashi for those that don't have Akizuki. Therefore you could say she is fairly vital to AACI properly.
kancolle,3ca37h,AlmaElma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:34 2015 UTC,Not sure how much luck increases the chance to cause AACI's but AA stat is important causing a stronger blast with a higher chance to destroy all incoming bombers. Hence why Fubuki is a good choice. Also why Shigure is a good choice I guess with a good AA stat and good luck.
kancolle,3ca37h,HITKAZE,2,Mon Jul 6 19:47:58 2015 UTC,higher chance to destroy all incoming bombers.   AACI doesn't work like that. It destroys the fixed number of planes per slot depending on the ship that triggers it (and it's equipment) with Maya being at the top alongside Akizuki. Ship's AA stat doesn't matter during AACI per se (though it matters during regular anti-air phases).  You can refer to this thread for further discussions and formulas.

kancolle,3ca37h,HITKAZE,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:57:08 2015 UTC,"Why not just hold onto the blueprint for now and see which one you need once the event begins? It also depends on your fleet. Do you have other CAVs available? Are your BBs leveled well? If you already have a decent fleet of BBs, Yamashiro might not be necessary. That said, her Kai Ni equipment is useful and her stats become much better. Personally, I would go Tone as she has more utility on a ""regular"" basis - clearing 2-5 North route, branching and so on."

In terms of levels, that's leveling 4.5 ships from lvl1 to lvl70 in a month. With stronger PvP opponents and a few sorties per day, you can easily average 80k xp per day."

Anyway, you can hunt for the Whale at 2-5, 3-4 or 5-2 if you really want her. I got her from 2-5 while hunting for Akashi. You could get her from 2-4 and 4-4 too but the compass is annoying. For Hamawaifu, the event is probably best to get her."

kancolle,3ca37h,queendaryl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:29:24 2015 UTC,Yahagi can drop fairly well on the base LSC recipe. Once you build those Maruyu luck fodder/3-2A meatshields you'll get her eventually.

kancolle,3ca37h,queendaryl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:23:59 2015 UTC,"I would say your focus should probably be on Tone and either give her your next blueprint to get a great CAV or keep that blueprint and see if anything new (and better) needs it. Aside from that, you could level Fubuki to Kai Ni and Shimakaze to around level 60. Having 6 core DDs is important. Yes, level Nachi to Kai Ni. Level your Kongou-class to Kai Ni and level Chiyoda to Kai Ni."

kancolle,3ca37h,Mechyoshi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:51:43 2015 UTC,"From what I see, I think you stand a chance at Hard if you continue to level your ships and those I pointed out in the previous comment.  One thing, you don't have to complete all maps on Hard, as it depends on the sort of rewards you'll get. Sometimes, the Medium reward might be better than Hard. It also depends on enemy composition and what the devs will be throwing at us.  As for equipment, definitely keep trying to get about 2 more Reppuu (20/20/10/90). The other plane types are sufficient. Try crafting better radars - Type 33 and Type 32 - as well. Another 3x Depth Charges will be good, as well as 1-2 more Type 3 Shells. The last is really important."

kancolle,3ca37h,Mechyoshi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:55:03 2015 UTC,"It's not so much your HQ Level but the level of your ships. For World 2, you should be striving towards getting your ships to their first remodel level, which is around level 20-25, and then modernise them. You can level your DDs and CLs at 1-5. As you experienced in 1-4, you'll face enemy BBs and CV(L)s, so it's best if you start adding a CV(L) or even a BB (they drop in World 2) to your lineup. You should be able to access the Akagi quest by now to obtain her. She'll be invaluable in most sorties."

kancolle,3ca37h,Zeen172,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:00:21 2015 UTC,"You could. CV(L)s can conduct opening airstrikes (when equipped with Dive Bombers and Torpedo Bombers) that might take out the enemy before day battle begins, which makes them useful. However, the main purpose of adding CV(L)s is to help you attain AS (Air Superiority), so that you can trigger Artillery Spotting - double attacks and cut-ins from your ships. Look at the wiki to see how much AS you need and equip your planes accordingly. It'll make battles much easier."

kancolle,3ca37h,AlmaElma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:11:58 2015 UTC,It uses more resources but the point of it is to powerlevel; MVP and flagship EXP stack multiplicatively so leeching is always much slower over all. 3-2A leeching is nice if you have a bunch of ships you're not in a rush to level but 4-3 is probably multiple times faster.
kancolle,3ca37h,para29,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:33:49 2015 UTC,With a strong fleet node J is in most cases just a bonus exp node. You'll use buckets while leveling in 4-3 anyway. And you can't level DD\CL in 3-2 fast so comparison is not valid.

If you cleared 1-4 then you can try for 2-1.     Yes, this is a Japanese game, so of course levelling is slow. It only gets harder as your girls get higher levels; just look at levelling Pokemon beyond 70. For now just use whatever you have at your disposal and level them as much as you can as you do the quests and clearing World 2.     I would suggest doing some research for your early to mid game, such as looking for which ships to level, to make the best use of your time transitioning to mid game. For example, ships able to Kai Ni are worth levelling (e.g. Shigure and Yuudachi are worth levelling instead of Murasame and Shiratsuyu). With time and lots of reading and research on the wiki and Himeuta, you'll gain enough experience to intuitively make decisions.

kancolle,3cagt7,glennnntgx,4,Mon Jul 6 11:11:06 2015 UTC,"General Advice   Level who you like. For general purposes, it's fine to go with your favourites. If you are concerned about stats, level ships with a second remodel stage as they're more powerful overall and come with good equipment. Level a variety of ships. Don't just stick to BBs. You need at least 6 from each class to perform well in events. Later Worlds will require you to have a diverse fleet. Fleet 2,3 and 4 should be expedition fleets. I'm not sure what your Fleet 2 is for, unless you're just showing what you have. Your Fleet 2 ships should be trained as part of your main fleet - Jintsuu is arguably the best CL. Naka has an early Kai Ni level (Level 48). Kitakami is a goddess. Jun'you is arguable the best CVL and comes with Reppuu at Kai Ni. Souryuu is a decent CV with rare planes at Kai Ni and through some quests. Shimakaze is a great DD despite not having a Kai Ni. Equip your ships appropriately. This is very important. 4 main guns on BBs is a big NO NO. For BBs, the proper load out is 2x Main Guns, Recon Plane, Radar/AP Shell in general. CLs should have 2x Main guns and a recon plane. DDs should have double guns and a radar preferably. AA guns are awful.  For ships with plane slots, pay attention to which slot has the largest capacity. Mogami-class 2nd slot is the largest, so put that plane in the 2nd slot for Kumano. That Saiun should not be in Ryuujou's 1st slot. Put it in the 3rd or 4th slot.   Event Prep  As mentioned earlier, train up at least 6 from each class. From your list, I would say you can tackle Medium thereabouts. It really depends on what the devs have in store for us and from the updates, it looks like it's going to be challenging.     BB(V)s: Even out the levels of your Kongou-class. Consider leveling BBVs - Fusou, Yamashiro, Ise, Hyuuga. You might need them for branching. BBVs in general can be useful in helping to contribute to AS. CA(V)s: Sorely lacking. You need at least 4-6 CAs and 2CAVs. Consider leveling the Myoukou-class for CAs and Tone-class for eventual CAV (blueprint required and high remodel level). See if you can get another CAV like Mogami, who drops plenty at 3-2. Mogami and Kumano should suffice for your CAV needs. CL(T)s: Jintsuu and Kitakami to Kai Ni. Find Ooi if you can or you'll have to train Kiso who remodels into a CLT at Level 65. DDs: Need to be leveled more. Yuudachi, Shimakaze, Akatsuki, Shigure, Fubuki, Hibiki are good investments. Ushio has a low Kai Ni level, worth considering.  CV(L)s: Akagi and Kaga are fine. Level your CVLs more."

I'll definitely be doing what you've suggested.  Yeah I have been leveling who I like, Haruna, Kaga, Sendai etc. I use my 2nd fleet for sorties when my main fleet isn't up and running, didn't know all 3 of the sub-fleets should be used for running expeditions. I'll take note of that!  Thanks for the lengthy reply, it really helped a lot."
kancolle,3cagt7,BrokenMn,2,Mon Jul 6 14:29:30 2015 UTC,Why are you equipping so many main guns on your battleships?? oO A more optimal setup for BBs would be main/main/seaplane/wildcard as this enables your BBs to double attack/cutin when you have air superiority. Also do train your DDs. They are cute. First priority though would be to get your kitakami to kaini and do daily crafts for reppu/AP/type3 if you do not have them yet.
kancolle,3cagt7,BrokenMn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"Haha idk, a friend told me that was what he did and he has a few weeks more of experience than me so I just copied it. Thanks for the advice, so do I place that setup on all of my BBs?   Yeah I don't have any of that, I've been trying to craft stuff but don't usually get what I want unfortunately."
kancolle,3cagt7,etaribi,2,Mon Jul 6 12:15:57 2015 UTC,Do refer to the wiki for how different equipment setups work and also for equipment recipes. My preferred setup for BB would be main/main/AP/seaplane. AP could be changed depending on the map.

kancolle,3caycc,tjdqhr1225,4,Mon Jul 6 14:17:58 2015 UTC,Your equipment setup is weird. Just equip double guns + radar on all DD. Other than that it's probably just RNG.  Update: Eh. I'm somehow having troubles this month too with 90+ girls. Must be payment for last month 4\4 clear. Or they stealthbuffed first node torpedo accuracy but that is unlikely.

kancolle,3caycc,kingofquackz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:02:30 2015 UTC,This might be a total placebo but I run line abreast when I do 3-5 and it does seem to help. Last month only took me 8 attempts while this month I tried with line ahead and it took 15 so I feel it might be useful to try.
kancolle,3caycc,Noperative,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:53:06 2015 UTC,"Your fleet should be able to clear it. I am HQ 97 and cleared it this month in 5 attempts with ships equal and lower level then yours. Sparkle your fleet so you can dodge more torps on pre-boss nodes. Also take a night scout on Sendai, it helps if you have to night battle the boss.   Fleet I used to clear 3-5 this month"
kancolle,3caycc,Jaynight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:17:01 2015 UTC,Sparkle and pray
kancolle,3caycc,Exordium8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:45:32 2015 UTC,"Your fleet is perfectly capable of winning.  My fleet is similar in level and I've cleared it the past two months.  The nice thing about 3-5 is it's so cheap to run you don't have to be in any rush to beat it.  Even if you start stockpiling and lose natural regen you can afford to run 3-5 over and over with almost no cost to your resources.  I usually end up running it 1-2 times per day.  I'll run it once, repair my girls throughout the day, then run it a second time before I go to bed, then have my girls repair over night.  Rinse and repeat.  No need to waste time sparkling or waste buckets trying to complete it in one day.  The only reason you would need to rush it is if it was the end of the month.  Otherwise it's just being impatient.  My advice is don't worry about having to finish 3-5 before you start stockpiling.  Just take your time, do 1-2 runs per day, and you'll finish it eventually.  Definitely don't use any buckets on it."

kancolle,3c900o,Noperative,3,Mon Jul 6 01:40:25 2015 UTC,Sendai or Jintsuu are recommended. Yuubari doesn't have much application outside of drums branching or ASW situations because she has super weak defenses and no plane slots for artillery spotting.
kancolle,3c900o,Adatia,0,Mon Jul 6 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"Jintsuu kai ni is the best choice. Statwise Kuma and Nagara are better than Sendai kai ni. But mostly people would level Sendai for the night battle equipment, so it could save some time by using Sendai and no need to level other CLs."
kancolle,3c900o,Faerieduster,2,Mon Jul 6 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"She will sorta, but her armor is very low and id recommend getting a standard one over her.  In essences you run the risk of a fair few additional retreats using her and she cant run a scout plane either, in some cases it might be worth the extra slot, but in most it likely wont.  if you have a few CL shes not bad to have as an option though."
kancolle,3c900o,nekonight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:45:17 2015 UTC,You only need one CL. I have level 150 Naka and I haven't needed another CL for event in last 3 events... ;P
kancolle,3c900o,nekonight,2,Mon Jul 6 16:05:44 2015 UTC,I guess we should also prepare AACI equipment and ships. I guess i will need to get Hastushimo to kai ni and another 10cm+fd.
kancolle,3c900o,Adatia,5,Mon Jul 6 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think that matters unless they change the AACI system.  What AACI does is when it triggered, it will shot down a regular number planes of all enemies' bomber slots. And even with the most strongest AACI, this number is still very small. Akitsuki with 2 HA and RADAR, 7 planes per slot. Maya kai ni with HA, concentrated autocannon and RADAR , 8 planes per slot. And normal DDs with 10cm+fd and RADAR can only shot down 4 planes per slot. The anti-air defense phase is what really shoot down most of enemy planes.   What I want to said is, don't believe AACI too much. It's actually not that powerful."
kancolle,3c900o,peevedlatios,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:30:29 2015 UTC,While that is true if you couple AACI and AS+ together it is entirely possible for a carrier to run out of planes therefore they no longer shell. Which usually means 2 less chances of rng knocking someone into red before you get to the boss.
kancolle,3c900o,AlmaElma,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"In most cases you would be better off running more torpedo bombers instead of going for AS+ in order to minimize risk though.  Its a decent bonus to have the AACI on dd's, but mostly because there isnt really anything else useful to put on them."
kancolle,3c900o,SBelmont,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:55:07 2015 UTC,"AS+ also reduces your cost of running carriers since less of your planes are shot down. Very useful when achieving it is realistic with, say, one or two reppuus out of 2-4 CVs."
kancolle,3c900o,Adatia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"Getting to AS+ without sacrificing too much is not very realistic, especially during events, so it's generally not worth it."
kancolle,3c900o,Admiral_Mikan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:22:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree, though it depends on what you can run and what enemy fleets have. With Kidou Butai it's possible realistically run 400+ Air Power and still have strong carrier shelling, provided you have strong Fighters (Reppu+601/Kai variations)"
kancolle,3c900o,Daishomaru,2,Mon Jul 6 06:46:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like you really would want as strong an initial air strike as possible on Kidou butai since your comparatively weak escort fleet will take enemy fire to their face first.  If its all air battles again like midway then maybe, but midway also had maps with 800+ requirement for AS+."

kancolle,3c900o,Berw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:19:01 2015 UTC,It's just shot down by Akitsuki's high AA stats. The AACI might has a little effort but what truly shot down the planes are the fighters and the AA stat of the ship.
kancolle,3c900o,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jul 8 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I went back to E1 easy (First event) to get an Ooyodo instead of continuing to E3 after getting Katsuragi.

kancolle,3c6t1e,piedro101,5,Sun Jul 5 11:37:50 2015 UTC,"Composition seems fine in general, but I'd suggest the following.   Put your CVs at the last 2 slots, you want your CA(V)s to attack first in yasen before they have a chance to get rekt. (not like the CVs do much more than your CA(V)s in second shelling phase anw, especially with that many fighters) No need for SCAMP on Tone imo, use a sanshiki on her instead. Another option would be to use AP shell on mutsu so she can reliably clear the Ru-class or other trash if you don't have spare sanshikis. You could replace Mutsu with a FBB to achieve fast fleet evasion bonus, but I'm not very sure how much of an impact this would have Not confirmed that fast fleets gain evasion bonus, but feel free to experiment. (tbh I'd still use a FBB for the higher innate evasion) Move Zuiun on Kumano to second slot (second slot is 6 planes, third is 5 planes) Honestly this doesnt matter much kappa. Pray to RNG."

kancolle,3c6t1e,wafuuuu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"Barely noticeable to the point most people wouldn't care about it. Fleet evasion bonus was something that surfaced back in the early days of the game, when someone asked the developers about ship speed and they replied ""there are cases where a fast fleet is unable to make use of its speeds when a slow ship is thrown into the mix"".  Tests later led people to conclude that the evasion stats and the number of ships in a fleet are the bigger factors (you've probably noticed at times, when an enemy fleet with just a single high level ship in PVP dodging like on crack)."

I have a level 84 kongou so i will try her next time i have gathered enough resources. I also have a Myoukou kai ni, is her high damage worth more than the Zuiun 634?

All in all, 4-5 is a surprisingly flexible map. Meaning to say, it's actually a map where various methods could work out. Some would say try an AP shell or 2, some would say use a CLT, some would say sub-tank through the south route, others would say fk it and go full brute force (4BB 2CV) through yasen node.

kancolle,3c6t1e,robbielj,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely change your fleet order to BB -> CA/CAV -> CV, and trade SCAMP for a Type 3 on Tone Consider trading a CAV for a CLT with Type A + 2 red or yellow guns so she can pop one squishy ship in opening salvo and still do damage at night After runs check your fleet details to see how many Zuiuns your CAVs have left. If there's 0, consider changing them to normal planes (Type 0 Recon, Type 0 Obs, Sendai's night plane). The enemies on this map, like the Elite Tsu-class CLs, actually have considerable anti-air so it's likely that the dinky 6-9 planes on your CAVs got shot down, so they can't double attack during day battle at the boss. The Zuiuns only contribute a little air superiority and damage so it's not that big of a deal to have them IMO Likewise the 12 attacking planes on Shoukaku might get shot down along the way or at the boss so she can't attack during day, but I think that plane configuration is actually optimal (at least according to Aircalc), so there's nothing you can actually do about that other than to put her last in case she really can't attack People consider this map to be nearly as frustrating as 5-5, so you might need to do the same thing people do for 5-5: sparkle your ships. Notice how the only ships who didn't get rekt on your side were the only ones who were sparkled before entering this battle. I know it's tedious but it'll save resources and sanity"
kancolle,3c6t1e,madharuhi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:09:43 2015 UTC,"Consider investing a blueprint on Fusou/Yamashiro. Seaplane bombers might not add much, but that +14 air power (with her stock Zuiun 12 in her 23-plane slot) can mean the difference between reaching AS with just one CV or having to resort to 2CVs.  For instance, Fusou Kai Ni + Kaga Kai + Tone Kai Ni allows you to hit AS on pre-final kills (+9 surplus with 3 Reppuu and 1 Reppuu 601, adding Kumano will give you slightly more); pre-final form's not that difficult so it's worth trading Kaga's capability to attack for an extra BB(V) especially when CVs can't attack at night.  Other than that, the stuff what others have already mentioned: levels, ship order, removing SCAMP for Sanshiki, sparkling to make up for the low levels. And remember, final form's multiple times scarier with her evolved form and the Ru Kai."

kancolle,3c6727,papperation,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"I used the 2DD 2CA/CAV 1CLT 1CVL fleet to clear it. It's less demanding on resources and only has two battle nodes before the boss node, but that set up can be rough since they'll have to go against decently tough enemies. Just pray to RNG that you can get though those nodes without anyone getting taiha'd. As for loadout, since I'm on my phone right now, it's difficult to type it all out so I'll get on my computer and edit this comment with it ASAP.   Loadout (Feel free to critique. I wasn't really using any guides for my loadout):  Fubuki Kai Ni: 10cm Twin High-angle Mount, Type 94 Anti-Aircraft Fire Director, Type 13 AIR RADAR Kai (I had her set up for AACI in case I ran into the Light Carrier Nu-Class Flagship at node B).  Yuudachi Kai Ni: 10cm Twin High-angle Mount x2, Type 22 Surface Radar  Kitakami Kai Ni: Type A Ko-hyoteki, 15.5cm Triple Gun Mount (Secondary) x2   Tone Kai: 15.5cm Triple Gun Mount (Main) x2, Type 0 Recon Seaplane, Type 22 Surface Radar  Kumano Kai: 15.5cm Triple Gun Mount (Main) x2, Zuiun, Searchlight (I knew I was probably going to need to go into night battle against the boss.)  Hiyou Kai: Reppuu x2 (OR it was one Shiden Kai 2 instead of the Reppuu. Can't remember), Ryuusei x2"
kancolle,3c6727,papperation,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your clear, but I do have to say that your loadout for your ships is suboptimal.   For your DDs, 2xred and a wildcard is fine. The Nu Class rarely deals damage or even lands a hit at all.  For your CAs, use 20.3 reds instead of 15.5s, they get a fit bonus from using them.   Loadout on Hiyou is fine, but instead of 2 red planes, use a blue one in the larger slot or a saiun in the smaller. One gives a better preshelling damage and the other gets rid of red T at boss node. Reds are just there to gaurentee shelling damage."
kancolle,3c6727,derika22,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"I did use Saiun before, but I actually don't mind getting the red T before the boss since it gives me a better chance of surviving encounters. That said, yea, it was risky considering I could've easily gotten red T at the boss. I was using Ryuusei which is the torpedo bomber and not Suisei which is the dive bomber. As for the 20.3, I should look into that more since I've always valued accuracy over firepower."

kancolle,3c5o3e,TomVP46,4,Sun Jul 5 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and results and for provoking a discussion on the relatively new 4-5.  I won't or more like can't comment on the B-E-H-M route as I prefer not to night battle and to stay far away from those Ru-class Kai and Wo-class flagship II; I'll take the ammo penalty anytime.   On the contrary, B-C-F-J-M is my preferred route for 4-5 for three reasons.    It's probably the most resource-friendly route. A single run including night battle at the boss node costs 316 Fuel and 479 Ammo, with Steel repair costs under a 1000 and at most 4 buckets used if I'm impatient. Relatively manageable pre-boss nodes. The main threats are Ta-class and Ne-class but when juxtaposed to Ru-class Kai and Wo-class flag, they don't seem that threatening, at least to me. Node F is a freebie so long as you aren't unlucky and get crit by the opening or closing torp. Plus, the AS required for pre-boss nodes are low, which means I can load up my carriers with more attack planes. Since the AS requirement is much lower on the final run, I can swap a CV for a BB(V) to bring in more firepower. The two times I've attempted 4-5, I've not had any problems with the final kill. Perhaps I'm just lucky.   Granted, the B-C-F-J-M route has the least firepower and armour (let's put aside the North route option), since you can only bring 1 BB with you, and in a sense, you are reliant on night battle to finish off the enemy. Should a number of your ships get hit to red during day battle, your chance of sinking the boss is low. That said, this has not been a problem for me and there has been a few occasions when I was able to clear the enemy fleet during the day (less resource consumption, wonderful).  Now, what composition did I use?  Pre-Final Form:   Haruna Kai Ni: 2x 41cm, AP Shell, Recon Plane Chikuma Kai Ni: 2x 20.3cm (No.3), Type 3 Shell, Zuiun 634 Myoukou Kai Ni: 2x 20.3cm (No.2), Type 3 Shell, Recon Plane Haguro Kai Ni: Same as Myoukou Akagi Kai: Ryuusei 601, 2x Reppuu, Saiun (I could probably do without this) Kaga Kai: Tenzan M12, 2x Reppuu, Suisei Egusa   Final Form:   Akagi swapped for Fusou Kai Ni: 2x 41cm, Type 3 Shell, Zuiun Model 12 Kaga Kai: 3x Reppuu, Suisei Egusa The rest remained the same   Line Ahead on all nodes. The best defense is a good offense. Intentional sparkling? No.    Why did I choose this composition?   The choice of Chikuma was simply so that I could do some damage on the sub node. Fusou was used for the final form to contribute some AS through her Zuiuns, but it's not imperative. I've tried using another BB in her place and it works fine.  How did I perform?  Probably the most important question. Last month, it took me 10 attempts to clear 4-5, including experimentation - testing BCFHM and the viability of equipping an AP Shell. Of the 5 failures, 4 were retreats and 1 was failure to sink the boss. Based on the few observations I made, having an AP Shell really helped against the Ru-class Kai Flagship, which is probably the most problematic of the 6 ships, at least to me.   This month, it took me 7 attempts. The first failure was because I sortied a Chikuma with nothing equipped on her and the second was from an unlucky closing torpedo on Node F. Otherwise, it was very smooth sailing and I will continue to use this route. Of course, I acknowledge that not everyone will experience the same results as me (RNG is RNG), as well as the fact that B-C-F-J-M may not guarantee a boss kill compared to a heavier fleet, especially if your Type 3 holders get shot to red."
kancolle,3c5o3e,Tomaranai,2,Sun Jul 5 02:40:50 2015 UTC,"You're not the first person I've encountered who has seemed to have an easy time with this map.  Your two months combined were less than what I encountered last month alone, not even counting the pain I went through experimenting this month.  Perhaps I'm simply cursed.  The fun thing about 4-5 is I believe it has several viable methods of conquering it.  I don't believe a true max efficiency method has been decided on yet, so I'm very happy to be able to experiment for myself.  Unfortunately, last month I did not have anywhere near as much success as you did going B-C-F-J-M.  I tried that route with many different compositions:    1 BB, 3 CA(V), 2 CV   2 BB, 3CA(V), 1 CV   2 BB, 2 CA(V), 1 CLT, 1 CV   and   2 BB, 1 CA(V), 2 CLT, 1 CV  None of them managed to work out for me, but I've seen photo evidence that they've worked for other people.  The one thing I've yet to try that I was supposed to try this month was the submarine tanking method.  That's something I have to make sure I look into next month.  What levels are your ships if you don't mind sharing?  I know my ships aren't all 90+ like some people have, but I figured being 70+ should be sufficient for this map.  Yet I've struggled so much, perhaps I'm simply underleveled."
kancolle,3c5o3e,Tomaranai,2,Sun Jul 5 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"I might have lucked out on this map but I'm cursed elsewhere (looking at you B45). Indeed, there's several viable methods to conquering 4-5 and a mix of routes might even be the key to efficiency. If not for the upcoming event and the fact that I need to marry Haruna pronto, I would experiment further and even try B-E-H-M.  Depending on your equipment, it might be difficult to attain AS if you use 1 CV for the pre-final runs. While CLTs can be useful, their squishy factor can be an impediment. Bringing in a CLT also means reducing your Type 3 Shell power and I'm not sure if that's worth sacrificing. That said, they might be useful in getting rid of escorts at the boss node since their torpedoes would target everything else but the installation boss. Something to test out next time.  Submarine tanking is certainly an interesting method but I'm not sure if it's worth sacrificing firepower. I suppose it'll be good for those who are having trouble maintaining the health of their fleet. Another method to test out in the future.  The ships I used were all mainly in their 70s, except for Haruna since she's my lucky charm.   Haruna - Level 98 Fusou - Level 82 Chikuma - Level 74 Myoukou and Haguro - Level 79 Akagi - Level 72 Kaga - Level 79   I doubt it's a question of being underleveled. An average level of 70 should be more than sufficient. Having sparkled ships might improve success rates since my ships are constantly sparkled from PVP matches."

kancolle,3c5o3e,Kyoeishinkirou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:01:27 2015 UTC,I hope as much.  Small sample size is small after all.  I plan on testing things further next month.  Are your ships significantly higher level than mine?  Were you sparkled at all?  Or is it simply a case of RNG being RNG?
kancolle,3c5o3e,Noperative,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Slightly not by much, 2 ships in the 70s rest in the 90s. No sparkling."
kancolle,3c5o3e,Jaynight,2,Mon Jul 6 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I managed to clear 4-5 extremely cleanly this month by running 1CLT1FBB1CAV1CA2CV down the middle for the first 4 and then the 4BB1BBV1CV through the night battle route for the last fight.  Only took a miraculous 8 attempts with 5 clean kills, the final fight took a single attempt which is like the best thing ever. The real takeaway here is that your forgo artillery spotting in favour of properly loading up on all the night battle gear which saves your on both the night battle node and doesn't really affect the day battle as much as I thought because 5 BB can just punch through all the escorts regardless. Final fight only the boss was left in the night battle and I had 2 attacks left in me after I sunk her. Seems very reliable I would recommend it."
kancolle,3c5o3e,Adatia,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:22:18 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed write up. Looking to clear 4-5 myself this month for the extra medal before the event. Would you say Bismarck Drei is required for this route due to the night battle? or could you substitute another BB.
kancolle,3c5o3e,papperation,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:56:07 2015 UTC,"I don't believe she's necessary at all.  I used her because she's a fairly new addition to my fleet and this was her first real action.  She has undeniable night battle power, but in hindsight having her positioned as the flagship really limited her ability to do anything special.  On all but one occasion she used her night battle attack to clear out some trash to allow another BB to attack the boss.  The one time she did attack the boss her damage trumped anything my other ships could do, but overall she didn't do anything that a Kongou-class BB couldn't have done.  The increased damage thanks to the higher ammo modifier provided all the bonus damage I needed.  If I use her next month I should probably move her lower in the order so she targets the boss more frequently."
kancolle,3c5o3e,CruzSchiffer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:07:26 2015 UTC,Its worth remembering that the boss is an installation type and that she doesn't take damage from torpedoes. So Bismarck doesnt actually have any night battle benefit over Kongous if she targets the boss.
kancolle,3c5o3e,liltopjohn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:49:14 2015 UTC,"Really?  I knew that torpedoes couldn't target the boss, but I was unaware it also removed the night battle bonus from your torpedo stat.  I suppose the massive damage she did was probably a lucky crit then.  Her slightly higher firepower may also have contributed."
kancolle,3c5o3e,madharuhi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah if the torpedo damage would still take effect in night battle, we'd be using CLTs instead of CAs with sanshikis to kill the boss in 1 shot."
kancolle,3c5o3e,wafuuuu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"One thing I like about the NB route is that the NB node comes first. A 5BB 1CV is almost guaranteed to secure the kill at the boss, and H node rarely sends you back.  So even with a heavy fleet like that, getting sent back at the NB node will only cost you ~200 fuel and ammo excluding repairs. I think it's cheaper overall than going the longer route only to fail at the boss node.  That said, I think BEHM is probably only worth it for the final kill.  Anyway, I remember reading somewhere that the daytime accuracy modifiers will apply for night battle nodes, so I use double line for such cases."
kancolle,3c5o3e,mintywhiterice,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"In terms of failure I agree it's definitely cheaper.  If I don't have to repair one or two BBs every failed night battle it would be even better for resource consumption.  If I can get away with some CAs instead it could be relatively efficient.  It has to be said it's pretty sanity draining though.  Getting sent back at the first node over and over again is not good for morale (in game and in real life).  As of now, I'm in agreement that B-E-H-M is best for the final kill only.  I plan on testing it more next month to see if I just had a really bad string of RNG, but the pre-final form boss is easy enough to where you can take the long route and have little to no difficulty sinking her."
kancolle,3c5o3e,andysun25,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:24:45 2015 UTC,Having one or two ships (preferably flag and 2nd) with AP shell will help you to remove trash on the boss node.
kancolle,3c5o3e,_tickles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's great advice for anyone struggling to clear the escort fleet during the day battle.  I used some AP shells last month when I was taking the longer route.  I found with this route and composition it was completely unnecessary.  My largest difficulty going B-E-H-M was simply getting to the boss node.  Once there my ships easily dispatched the enemies.  Even on the boss's final form all that was left come night battle was the boss and her pet Ru-class Kai.  Using AP shells is definitely something to consider if you're using a lighter fleet though.  With the power of 5 BB is really doesn't matter.  If you are using 2-3 CAs you might need AP shells on your BBs to compensate for the CAs lower day time damage.  It's something I'll be looking into when I experiment with more compositions next month."
kancolle,3c5o3e,Jifaru,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:47:13 2015 UTC,"You could probably swap the seaplane and starshell on Maya and Haruna; artillery-spotted attacks are better appreciated on the BB.  I'm working on upgrading a searchlight into a large searchlight, wanted it for the pokedex entry but I figured it would be nice to give it a test next month since I'm already using the searchlight on a BB anyway (will be doing 1BBV 4CA(V) 1CV next month for pre-final kills). The reason I really wanted to get an 'optimal' setup for BEHM was because of node C and J being jackasses; the Ta-class easily gets my CAs or Kaga to taiha with or without sparkling. It's largely RNG but my luck hasn't been great with BCFJM so I want to avoid it as much as possible (heck, my Taihou with full health got taiha'd by the sub node once).  5BB is pretty overkill but I like that for the final kill because they tend to get through node H more easily (minus the green-T's which anything besides Yamato-class melts anyway).  I read some comments about 2CVs for their fleets and opening airstrike helping a lot, but it failed quite spectacularly in my attempts to field both Kaga and Taihou. Eventually gave up and used Kaga as a Reppuu mule and the fleet fared much better from there. Probably won't use 2CVs for 4-5 ever again.  I'm interested in using an SS decoy, though I'll be testing it out only for the final kill. General opinions are that the drop in firepower isn't worth the usage of a tank but given the Seiki's ridiculous accuracy in the day I think it's worth a try at the very least.  Might try out the much-dreaded North route some time. Might. I can't see the value in it yet but there's gotta be something about it, perhaps something that no one found out about yet.   Regarding fleet speed and formations   AFAIK fleet speed doesn't affect evasion in any way despite some people saying a fast fleet increases evasion.  Formation affecting evasion has been known for quite some time (back in late 2014), but has only gotten attention recently because someone on the English side brought it up again with larger sample sizes. It has been speculated among the testers that evasion/accuracy in night battle are based on torpedo accuracy/evasion in the day. I still stick to line ahead for night battles because I prefer the much higher accuracy and they helped me a lot more than the slight evasion bonuses from double line. Echelon should never be used (nothing remarkable about it in any tests so far)."
kancolle,3c6n5u,subhunt,3,Sun Jul 5 09:49:35 2015 UTC,"For Medium, an average level of 50-60 should be sufficient. Your equipment need not be the best but one thing you can't skimp on is your ship diversity. Before working on your fleet, here are some things you should consider:   Unlock that 4th fleet. It will make your resource life much easier. Don't bother spending resources crafting Kirishima. You should be able to get her from map drops in World 2 and 3-2. I get quite a few of her when I power-level at the latter. If you're low on dev mats, make sure you do quests that reward you them and try not to spam development for Saiun and Reppuu. Yes, those two are important, but Shiden Kai 2 is very viable for Medium and even your Type 52s. Just develop enough for dailies, using 20/60/10/110 to try for a Saiun and then swap to 20/20/10/90 for Fighters.   Back to your fleet:   BBs: Continue leveling them to the 50s via 3-2 or PVP. As mentioned earlier, leveling at 3-2 will give you the chance of getting Kirishima. Get Kongou to Kai and level her to match the rest. DDs: For those who have early Kai Ni (Yuudachi, Shigure), get them there. Their battle performance increases much more. Try to get 6DDs to around level 50-60 and be sure to modernise them. From your list, Yuudachi, Shimakaze, Shigure, Fubuki, Hibiki and Hatsushimo are good choices. CL(T)s: Good that you have Kitakami Kai Ni. If possible, train up another CLT like Kiso or Ooi (I don't see her on your list). Definitely Kai Ni Sendai for her invaluable night equipment. Train 1 more CL as well. I'll go with Naka since she's your next highest and she does have an early Kai Ni. Yuubari and Jintsuu are good investments but focus on those mentioned for now. CA(V)s: Need more work here. A lot of work. Get 4 CAs to level 50 and 2 CAVs. For CAs, you already have Maya at Level 35, so keep leveling her and then level Atago and choose from the Myoukou sisters or Furutaka/Kako. For CAVs, you only have Suzuya and Mogami. While the Tone-class is best for CAV, you'll need to dedicate much time to level them and use blueprints, so it's probably not a good idea for now. CV(L)s: Your best five looks fine, so just keep leveling them further. They should level by themselves when you power-level the other ships. Another CV would be good but there's no need to go crazy looking for one or building one.   As for equipment, see if you can get:    1-2 more Reppuu/Shiden Kai 2  2-3 more Ryuusei/Ryuusei Kai Saiun 2 more Type 3 Shells and AP Shells (10/90/90/30) 3 sets of Sonars (10/10/10/20) and Depth Charges (10/30/10/10)   As long as your ships are modernised and equipped appropriately, you should be fine on Medium. Do try getting your 4th fleet unlocked. That in my opinion should be the priority. Don't forget to get your resources ready nearer to the date as well.  Good luck."

kancolle,3c6e01,resurrexia,3,Sun Jul 5 07:04:40 2015 UTC,"Edit: formatting is shit, gonna see if I can make it visually better.    Ok, let's see:  If you havn't cleared it yet clear 1-5 for the medal. If you havn't reached 3-2 yet see if you can do that. You can use 401 as sub tank there to level your big girls.  Use the first node of 1-5 to level up destroyers and light cruisers (you can also let other ships leech xp there if you want to).  Use any doubles and unwanted ships you got as modernisation fodder for the ships that you managed to bring to kai.    __  My recommendation for leveling:  Light Cruisers:  to kai: Sendai Jintsuu Naka  If you find the time Naka and Sendai to kai ni. I am recommending naka because of her low level and Sendai for her night fighting equipment.  Joker: Isuzu to level 12 kai for radar if needed.    __  Destroyers:  to kai ni: Yuudachi Shigure  if you find the time to do so due to their low level and good stats.  to kai: Any of the 15hp destroyers that you like, but at least 4. Do not stop leveling them once you bring them to kai though and also modernise them.  Considering that you will be playing on easy fleetlocking should not effect you (going by last event).    __  Heavy Cruisers:  CA(V) Suzuya to Kai and Mogami to the same level. cruisers with carrier capability are always good to have and two should be enough. Suzuya will not be that easy due to her required level being 35.  Heavy cruisers: The takao class and myoukou class are good ships on Kai, I would concentrate on one set of four and level them to kai. Make sure you can equip up to six cruisers with 20.3cm guns.    __  Battleships: Bringing all your FBB's to kai would be a good idea because they are not too high with level requirements and give 41cm guns  Your BB(V)s look pretty good.  Mutsu might be worth it as a joker due to good stats and having 41cms as fit guns. Though she will guzzle more resources.    Carriers: Souryuu to kai. What happened to your akagi? Or didn't you finish the quests to get her?  Hiyou, Junyou, Chitose and CHiyoda as cvl's are good investments. Chitose and Chiryoda also give the mini sub that will allow kitakami and ooi to do an opening torpedo strike.    Special purpose: Kitakami to Kai ni (lvl 50) if you can. Also Ooi should she drop in.  Expeditions: seeing as you do not have kongou exp. 5/6 spam would be a good idea to gain resources and lots of bauxite because you will want to try and craft a few reppus in my opinion.  If you can unlock 3-2 and use the submarine tanking guide for easy xp gain for your big girls and with some luck kongou will drop in to unlock your 4th fleet.    Equipment:  You will want to try to craft some reppus. I would recommend to use a more costly recipe that also gives you the chance for higher quality dive and torpedo bombers as well as a Saiun or two (carrier scout plane, yellow). The ammount of 35.6 and 41cm guns that you get threw upgrading your battleships should be enough to properly outfit 4 of them without issues. You might want to try to craft ap and type 3 shells as well (3-4 of each).  Think you will have enough guns for your cruisers and destroyers."
kancolle,3c6e01,2xSixpack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:34:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for your help!  I've unlocked 3-2. I've also got Akagi.
kancolle,3c6e01,2xSixpack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:42:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, I simply overlooked her, somehow. So I would say to bring Souryuu and Akagi to Kai. That will give you a good core of 4 carriers to use for combined fleets.  Hiyou, Junyou, Chitose and Chiyoda as CVL should also do good, but concentrate more on Junyou and Hiyou. They might be slow but their plane carrying capacity is good. I personally prefer Chitose and Chioyda because they are fast, but they need to be at a good level and require multiple remodels.    As long as you subtank 3-2-a and use 1-5-a for your smaller girls you should only require little steel so your main efforts would be ammo, fuel and bauxite for keeping the leveling rolling and being able to craft expensive planes."
kancolle,3c6e01,2xSixpack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:49:29 2015 UTC,Should I also get a few SONAR and RADAR?
kancolle,3c6e01,2xSixpack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:47:19 2015 UTC,"You will get some (big) radars from Isuzu and Suzuya. The problem with them is that they are rather expensive in bauxite to get while planes also require a lot of bauxite. So if you got a good set of planes you can switch over to crafting radars. Otherwise I would not recommend it.  As for Sonar and Depth charges: cheap to craft so go ahead and get some, you can then use them on your shipgirls to clear 1-5 this month. Might want to do it before you hit HQ level 40. And do use the world 1-5 guide from the wiki to get 100% guarantee to hit the boss node ;) Remember that a combination of Sonar + Depth Charge gives a BONUS against submarines."

kancolle,3c4i7s,Exordium8,6,Sat Jul 4 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"CV in general are known for their accuracy issue for several reasons:   No fit bonus, because they don't use guns or anything they don't have a fit gun bonus to improve their accuracy Unable to use artillery spotting or accuracy bonus wildcards. Because they use planes, they can't get the bonuses like DA/CI/AP shell/radar that help a lot of ships land hits. They can use saiun/type2/SCAMP at most, which is still very small compared to a single radar. Planes with accuracy are rare. Most low level planes don't give accuracy as a bonus, to get an accuracy bonus you usually need to have some very rare planes like Tenzan M12 (Tomonaga)'s + 3 accuracy or Suisei (Egusa)'s +4 accuracy.   These are some of the reasons that carriers in general aren't considered damage dealers even though they easily hit daytime damage caps."
kancolle,3c4i7s,Noperative,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"Just a note, carriers can equip yellow guns and radars, though it's not worth it usually.   When deploying carriers with very small slots (Ryuujou, Hiryuu) and already have a Saiun (or don't want it), it may be useful to equip a gun or a radar, as the planes in the slot would be emptied quite easily anyway."
kancolle,3c4i7s,blindjoker,3,Sat Jul 4 22:46:19 2015 UTC,CV(L)s have notoriously low accuracy.  Planes that give accuracy bonuses are highly coveted as a result.  There's not much you can do other than get your carriers to a higher level and try to stack as many accuracy bonuses as you can afford.  If you sortie with a carrier heavy fleet you can consider using the double line formation for a much needed accuracy boost at the cost of some damage.  As you continue to play and collect equipment you'll eventually come across bombers that give accuracy bonuses.  Souryuu Kai2's Egusa Squadron dive bombers (+4 accuracy) and Hiryuu Kai2's Tomonaga Squadron torpedo bombers (+3 accuracy) are two such planes that are relatively easy to acquire.
kancolle,3c4i7s,TomVP46,2,Sat Jul 4 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"Their main purpose is to achieve AS, damage is just a bonus. Also you are probably losing a lot of bauxite with this setup in PvP."

They won't do crazy damage, but won't be dead weight or a bauxite drain either."
kancolle,3c4i7s,Eternith,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really bother leveling CVs in PVP (but to each his own) since I prefer to reserve the PVP fleet for ships that are harder to level on their own.

If you want to level CV(L)s you can just bring them to 3-2A/5-4A with your best bombers + a SCAMP or a 15.5cm secondary gun on the flagship, 1 bomber on 3 other CV(L)s (plus a Saiun), a BB with the weakest guns possible setup for CI and a SS decoy; they'll almost never miss their MVP that way, even as level 1 ships."

You need double the air power the enemy has and if he is running carriers without a sub tank (indicating 3-2) then he is going to have like 150+ AS for his own map clears. Reaching 300+ AS and still beating the enemy's comp is nearly impossible.  If I'm levelling a CV I just put it in flag with an AACI comp and give it a saiun for the last slot. Then just 5 BB with 2 main + 2radar or an AP shell and just rely on them one-hitting everything without artillery spotting.
kancolle,3c4i7s,rain4kamikaze,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"Just like every other ship except the auxiliary ships and maruyu, they are supposed to.  You need a good dive bomber or two for shelling damage. Torpedo bombers are mainly for opening airstrike. Dive bomber helps a lot for shelling phase.  The innate firepower of most CVs are very low, making it difficult to deal damage during shelling against enemy fleets with decent armor."
kancolle,3c4i7s,Jifaru,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"Carriers actually don't have lower accuracy per se, but there are a variety of reasons why your ships might not be performing at the level you want them to. First, keep in mind that most surface ships can be equipped to DA, so they just get that many more chances to hit. Also, most standard setups involve a radar and a seaplane, both which contribute ACC, and as already been stated, correctly-fit guns. With some adjustment, if you just want to grind your CVs, you should similarly equip them to deal damage instead of being your anti-air mules by equipping radars and other accuracy-supporting items.  Do remember that your opponents in PvP generally have higher evasion, so you're less likely to hit consistently. If you want to grind CVLs effectively, you can take them to 3-2 where enemies have low native AA and evasion. I personally don't use carriers in PvP because high ship AA tends to penalize you heavily and leave you with a high baux bill even if you don't face much fighter power. They're also easier to level elsewhere.  In terms of actual damage output, CVLs have lower slot sizes than CVs, so their opening strikes are generally less powerful, but their actual shelling isn't much worse than CVs as long as that slot is kept alive. My preferred setup is to use T32 radars in the large slots to conserve baux, and then a SCAMP or 15.5 auxiliary yellow to increase their range so that they fire before other ships."
kancolle,3c5eop,usmin,5,Sat Jul 4 23:34:55 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what the devs said you should always focus on having a wide variety of ships.  DD's are usually important as is having at least a few CA and CL.  having something along the line of 4DD, 2CL, 4CA, 2CAV, 2CVL, 4CV and 4-6BB decently leveled and geared should be a good place to aim for."
kancolle,3c5eop,Adatia,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:42:20 2015 UTC,"definitely this, try to get a BB(V) too just in case of branching rules, although its unlikely its within the realm of possibility"
kancolle,3c5eop,genericusername348,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:52:53 2015 UTC,Your CA(V)'s are probably your weakest class and if locking is a thing this event it will hurt you more then your CV(L)'s.
kancolle,3c5eop,Jaynight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:17:33 2015 UTC,"You'll want to work on CA(V)s a lot, and there's nothing to worry about CV(L)s since they level up naturally as you level your CAs at 3-2A.  And work on a Fubuki since you have Akashi; a 10cm HA+FD will help a lot, even better if you have two."
kancolle,3c5eop,madharuhi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:21:28 2015 UTC,I actually grind on 4-1 most of the time since I can run 2 nodes instead of just one and better drops. but ya i've been thinking about the CAs
kancolle,3c5eop,madharuhi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:29:18 2015 UTC,"3-2A actually gives slightly more EXP per node compared to 4-1, and there's virtually no repair cost since the sub's the only thing that takes damage (and you don't need to wait for morale). If repair costs aren't a concern, 5-4A's the go-to in terms of EXP:consumption."

kancolle,3c3i1a,Jikkir_Skix,4,Sat Jul 4 12:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, you should participate in the event and do the best you can.  The reason why is because events provide the opportunity to obtain rare ships that are otherwise impossible or hard to get normally. For example, the first map of the last event had a chance of dropping Ooyodo, Amatsukaze at the boss node.  Another reason is because events may reward you with unique equipment and event-only ships, along with medals which are otherwise limited.     Since you still have another 4 weeks, I would say that you have sufficient time to prepare and have a good chance at clearing the event on Easy or even Medium. Read the event guides available, level your ships, use daily equipment development to try getting better equipment and you should be fine. If you need specific advice about your fleet, you can always post it and people will comment on it accordingly.  All the best for event preparation."
kancolle,3c3i1a,Tomaranai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:06:13 2015 UTC,"Do events reward good equipment when I finished the whole event or by node? I think equipments are rewarded upon completing a certain map. Idk, not sure myself."
kancolle,3c3i1a,Tomaranai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:14:52 2015 UTC,"The rewards are given when you complete a map. However, some if not all event maps have a boss gauge and you need to deplete that (inflicting damage/defeating the boss multiple times) before it can be considered complete."
kancolle,3c3i1a,brianjgines,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"Adding from what he was saying, this will give you a good experience of what event is like. After my first event, spring 2015, that i sadly didnt finished, ( only did E-1 through E-4) it gave me a good idea of what to do/plan before the next one. So, yeah just participate for the experience, also, i dont think you should worry about stockpiling atm because its your first event, you should start power leveling your ships, at least to 50-60+ levels. and i see you are hq 50, you should spam 1-5 power leveling your DD/CL there until you pass hq 80, then move to power leveling to 4-3. Then, power level your BBs/CAs/CVs in 3-2A, if u have it. also, heard that this event is ""carrier"" heavy, so level your CV(L)s, you can let them leach levels during 3-2A. also, run exped, 2/3/5/6/21, good to get rsc also if you exped 37/38, spam those too. Also, crafting good equipment for the event is also important, like reppuus and radars and type 3 shells and ap shells. Oh and one important thing to note is to have various type of ships to use. it is important to have, if there is fleet locking in this event, surely they do. but you do not need to worry about that because you are doing it on easy. So, yeah hope this helps, didnt mean to type this long >.>"
kancolle,3c3i1a,Radmiral,3,Sat Jul 4 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yes with 2 months play time you should be clearing the event on easy.  Time to level ships you've been avoiding and craft yourself some good fighters/AA ammo.  I would suggest you don't stockpile, but take advantage of natural regen up to the start of the event, start stockpiling when the event begins and clear in the final few days. This gives you almost an extra month to prepare yourself!"
kancolle,3c3i1a,Codmater779,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"So before the event begins, I will just craft equipment and level ships not minding the resources that I will use then when the event begins I will stock on resources? is that right?"
kancolle,3c3i1a,kyuurin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:11:00 2015 UTC,Put your Resources around 25-30k then thats where u lvl ur ships. That is what I did when I first played my first event last time.
kancolle,3c3i1a,Adatia,2,Sat Jul 4 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"It's worth doing the first maps, those aren't too difficult and can be cleared even if you're new to the game. Do some leveling, start stockpiling ~2 weeks before event and see how far you can get. Just wait a bit until things like branching has been figured out.  I started somewhere before Fall 2013 event and cleared E-2, took a break for leveling ships I needed for branching and then finished off E-3."
kancolle,3c3i1a,kyuurin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:29:48 2015 UTC,There is still a chance of getting rare drops when I do the first maps of event right? If that's so I might do some then test my ships if they can handle the boss.

kancolle,3c24vl,Adatia,2,Sat Jul 4 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"There was no easy mode in AL/MI. Instead, they just changed enemy compositions to your HQ level accordingly.  Also there was a really harder fleet locking compared to those recent events, where ships are locked with AL or MI and they are all banned from E6 and all support fleets duties. So at least 36 ships were needed. (AL, MI, MI escort, E6, support 1 and support 2)  This locking system had caused huge backlash, so devs made rather easy current ship locking system. So, I believe, this won't come again."
kancolle,3c24vl,liltopjohn,2,Sat Jul 4 05:07:54 2015 UTC,"It's a thing Dwarf Fortress, Dark Souls and few other series had. To show how ridiculously hard it gets at times, they break the rules of graphs in favor of visual humor."
kancolle,3c24vl,Abedeus,5,Sat Jul 4 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"Pretty much as the graph shows.   Background: This is last summer's event, AL/MI. The devs hinted at fleet locking and that ships used for the first part can't be used for the second. They hinted that the first part will be easy compared to the second part. In addition, they said prepare your baux. And all this was before choose your own difficulty.  Now event. Turns out that first two maps were the tough one's. You're trying to save the best for later so you try to sortie those ships that are a bit dusty for these maps. First map has a NB node on the way to the boss to RNG you back to the base. Second, map either you go light fleet (again with seldom used ships) or you go heavy and have fun with Block Wock Shooter. And then you hit the HP wall of hoppou (did I mention you needed a type 3 shell? Cause the devs sure didn't; may need to craft one. Bye resources).   So after you get past that you get to the combined fleet section thinking the worst is yet to come. But you put in your best ships and go in anyway. Turns out these air nodes are easy peasy. In E-3 I had one instance where I got to the boss with all 12 ships taking 0 total damage. And another instance where they combined took only 1. E-4 was a bit tricky as the one sub node was the ender of many runs, but otherwise again mostly easy. In E-5 if you RNG'd the south route it again was easy battles to the boss.  Now remember how you just used your best ships for the last three easy maps? You can't use them for E-6. And unless you really stalled and didn't touch E-1 for a day or two, those tier two ships for the first two levels are also unavailable for E-6. Did the devs make any mention of this beforehand? Nope. All you know was the two fleet locked areas and had no idea about this third fleet locked area. So now you're left with your third string ships to try to take out what could arguably be called the hardest boss ever. It would have been close/tough if you could have used combined fleets with your best ships but nope, you get one fleet. And take your pick: either carrier princess and BWS on the north route or yasen nodes that your carriers in your fleet just love. And while the HP wall of Hoppou was bad, some type 3s could solve the problem. E-6 boss was straight up armor and HP; no easy way to cheese this. You had to bring power and a lot of it. I got to the boss about 5 times (out of 50+ or so tries) and never once got a clean kill on her. Seeing that and knowing the final form had even more HP+armor, I tapped out and just left Isokaze there.   On the plus side though. farming was relatively easy cause most could be gotten from those E-3,4,5 maps and E-5 is by far the best level grinding map ever. Subs that had terrible accuracy while you could sortie 12 ships and 300 exp. And did I mention you didn't consume ammo on that node?  Well that was quite the storytime."
kancolle,3c24vl,chronomeister,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:41:46 2015 UTC,wow jeez!  Events sounds like some serious business...

kancolle,3c24vl,dearmusic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:25:10 2015 UTC,"If some of your ships are locked, that means you won't even be able to send them out on a sortie on maps that do not allow locked ships.

kancolle,3c24vl,funicode,6,Sat Jul 4 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"In that case you are not prepared.  Prepare 6 DDs, 2-3 CLs, 4-6 BBs and 6 CA's. At a minimum, more BB's recommended. Also get good equipment if you can."
kancolle,3c24vl,ryanxwonbin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:15:49 2015 UTC,"Take last event for example, the devs said CVs were important just like this time. And it turned out the CVs were not even absolutely necessary.  If you didn't have good CVs, you could still use Surface Fleet to clear the map (with somewhat higher difficulty) but if you didn't have good CA/BB/DD etc you would not be able to kill the bosses.  CVs in this game are mostly used to gain air superiority. In terms of damage output they suck compared to pretty much everything else."
kancolle,3c2mi0,duki512,5,Sat Jul 4 04:35:14 2015 UTC,"Now you have someone to do night battle with. ;)  I mean, congratulations and go get her sisters to Kai Ni as well."

kancolle,3c2mi0,subhunt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:22:17 2015 UTC,This is my first light cruiser that I leveled. Who is a good light cruiser that I should have leveled as well?
kancolle,3c3z84,Failnaught,5,Sat Jul 4 15:29:54 2015 UTC,Well without knowing your fleets levels Equipment ETC its really hard to tell if you can clear on hard or not HQ lvl no longer means much for events due to the Difficulty system that was implemented for them.  General idea for hard through is usually lvl 80+ ships for whole fleet maxed modernized apart from luck. Equipment is a bit harder to generalize due to not know what will be in each map. I cant really help you out more than that without knowing your fleet and equipment through.
kancolle,3c3z84,deadbmafia,2,Sat Jul 4 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"Well,you can read these guides: http://kancolle.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Shinhwalee/Major_Event_Preparation_Guide_for_Admirals https://www.reddit.com/r/kancolle/comments/3bjz8p/event_preparations_guide/  Also,post your ship list/equipment"

kancolle,3c3z84,Tomaranai,5,Sat Jul 4 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"In general the equipment you usually need are:   AP shells for those high armour enemies Type 3 shells (If we look at last event, which they also said was CV focused, then Type 3 shells may come in as a necessity if land based bosses are also present) Reppuus  (Very important. If not reppuus, then Shiden K2 is the bare minimum for hard if you want to get AS.) Saiun A few Sonar/Depth charge sets (Some tend to be SS based, usually the first ones). Fire directors (Not necessary, but helps on some maps) High quality dive bombers/torpedo bombers. That means at least Suisei and Tenzan. Search lights and star shell. These are basically what gets you the clutch victories in E-6, as you'll likely be entering night battle most of the time at boss node for the kills. Midget subs for your CLTs Appropriate sized guns for your ships. Means enough 35.6 guns to go around for your FBBs etc. Bonus if improved. Radars. Doesn't matter what kind. You will need them to stick on your DDs for support expeditions, or for night battle double attacks."

kancolle,3c3a3n,gililore1234,2,Sat Jul 4 10:10:00 2015 UTC,"The 1-5 quests are more reliant on having ASW gear than the level of the ships. When I did the quests my ships were under level 10 and I was in the HQ 80+ version of the run and I still got at least C on it. There was also a version later on that needed the super weak Mutsuki-class with Uzuki for the HQ personnel and I just did it with like level 5 ships anyway.

I know this was all pure luck, but I think it's kinda funny that someone else's superstition benefited me in some weird way.

kancolle,3c1hry,phoenixfudge,2,Sat Jul 4 00:54:33 2015 UTC,I concur with pasta setup.
kancolle,3c1hry,_tickles,2,Sat Jul 4 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"I think you mean 'cm' and not 'mm'.  To answer your question, I am a sucker for accuracy so I always go for the ""fit"" guns even at the cost of firepower.  For Bismarck I keep her equipped with two 38cm guns at all times.  The Kongou-class gets stuck with their 35.6cm guns.  I've heard people say the accuracy penalty is minimal outside of combined fleets, but I've never bothered to experiment first hand.  For me being able to hit more reliably is more important than hitting for a few extra points of damage at the risk of missing more frequently.  A miss does zero damage.  A hit with less firepower might not one-shot kill (although it usually does), but at least it'll be helping.  I haven't experienced any accuracy problems with any of my level 70+ ships when I use guns fit for their class."

kancolle,3bzklf,Jaynight,4,Fri Jul 3 12:43:09 2015 UTC,"For someone who started in the middle of the last event, you've certainly come a long way. I'll work based on what you shared.  Ships   SS(V)s: Modernise torpedo stat. Collect two more Maruyu and use her to luck modernise another ship like Kitakami or whoever you like. BB(V)s: Apart from leveling Fusou and Bismarck, there's no harm leveling another BBV. Their ability to contribute ever so slightly to AS should not be discounted, especially should something like E-6 in the last event occur again. Find a Mutsu if you can to accompany Nagato.  CV(L)s: Apart from leveling Chiyoda, you can level Chitose a bit more as well. Akagi too, to match Kaga. CA(V)s: The class that requires attention. Apart from Myoukou and Kako, level at least another 2 more CAs (Choukai, Nachi). As you probably know Choukai is a fantastic CA but needs a blueprint to unlock her potential, while it's quite worth to invest in Nachi since she's needed for a few quests. You have an excellent CAV in Tone, but level another one. Chikuma is a good long term investment but Suzuya and Kumano are decent CAVs if you don't have enough time. They're cute as well. CL(T)s: Yeah, level Kiso to get another CLT. Yuubari is also a good investment for her 4 slot utility. DDs: Level Yuudachi, Yukikaze and Shimakaze to Fubuki's level. If you're looking for two more DDs, I would recommend Shigure and Akatsuki. Shigure has decent luck, good stats, and can be used for AACI purposes. Akatsuki has decent stats and good LoS stat. She's also needed for quests, so she's a good investment. People will recommend Ayanami (she has the second highest firepower and comes with a star shell at Kai Ni) and you can consider her but I don't see her on your list.   Equipment  Develop more (rough estimate):    4x AP Shells (See if you can get the Type 1 from quests)  2x Type 3 Shell, Type 3 Sonar (You can also steal this from some trophy DDs)  Type 32 and 33 Radars (Try using 10/11/251/250, 20/20/250/250 or 100/10/250/250) Planes: 2x Ryuusei Kai, Reppuu/Shiden Kai 2 count looks fine but no harm have 1 or 2 more. You can 20/60/10/100 for a chance at both types.   Since you have Akashi, apart from getting the 10cm HA+FD, consider improving:   20.3cm (no.2/3) - Arguably the best CL and CA guns. Continue improving that 7* 35.6cm gun - Boost in Accuracy and Firepower is much needed ASW equipment AP Shells Quad/Quint Torpedoes   You have some redundant equipment that you can scrap if you're running out of space: 12cm, 50% of 12.7cm, 14cm, 8x 20.3cm, all non O2 Torpedoes, Type 96, Type 21, Type 99, Type 97, 50% of Saiun, 50% of Recon Planes, Terrible AA guns below +6 AA.    Keep up the good work."
kancolle,3bzklf,Tomaranai,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"Very Detailed, thank you very much.   As for my DD, after I get Shigure to Kai2 would you recommend I level my current destroyers up to 70 or should my primary focus still be getting more Kai2 destroyers. I do have Ayanami but she is only level 1. Not a huge fan of her art so I focused other ships. I was considering Akatsuki next actually so I think I will probably go ahead and do that.   For a second BBV should I level another Fusou class or is Ise class good as well.   For my CAV I will probably level my current ones rather then go after Chikuma as I really want Bismarck Drei. I feel Tone can support me for now with Mogami class backup. Are 3 CAV's sufficient?   Kitakami will be fed my first 5 Maruyu just waiting on more good failed LSC attempts. I have been trying for Taihou with my current LSC attempts. Is that a good choice or should I be aiming for Yamato class?   Currently holding off on improving 20.3cm guns as there are many CA's I can level to get some No 2/3's. Will move back to improving 35.6 and shells once I get my 10cm+AAFD. Really want to have at least 1 ready to go for event."
kancolle,3bzklf,Tomaranai,3,Fri Jul 3 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"Once you get Shigure to Kai Ni, that would put you at 5 DDs right? If that's the case, I would prioritise leveling them to 70. It shouldn't take that long with 4-3 leveling/PVP. They can benefit from the increased stats with leveling. The Fusou-class is the best BBV but only at Kai Ni. Eventually, you'll have gathered enough blueprints to Kai Ni the other Fusou-class. That alone makes it worthwhile to level Yamashiro. However, if you don't intend to Kai Ni Yamashiro, then the Ise-class is actually better stat-wise to the Kai Fusou-class. They have a 14 plane slot, while Fusou-class only has 11 at Kai. Honestly, I would just go with who you like here. Likewise, I prioritised Bismarck over getting another Tone-class CAV. Bismarck Drei is simply too awesome to pass up. Having Tone should be sufficient and the Mogami-class are definitely serviceable. 3 CAVs should be fine. Even if you find yourself short, you can always quickly power-level one during the event. LSC ships are certainly a bonus - Taihou and her ability to launch planes at medium damage, Yamasushi with their firepower and armour - but you really don't need LSC ships to do well for the events. That said, if you want to continue trying, between Taihou and the Yamato-class, I would go for Taihou because of her plane slots and utility. Your Kongou-class, incoming Bismarck Drei and Nagato should be more than sufficient. Yamato-class as you know can be expensive to sortie and repair and might put a strain on your resources during events. Yes, the 10cm HA+FD is definitely a priority. If you don't have enough time/materials to improve, you can actually just improve to 1* to take advantage of the extra Firepower and Accuracy."

One of those 6 is Yuugumo however, she is proving really useful so far helping me clear 3-5 and the like, but it seems she is only a middle tier destroyer.    you can actually just improve to 1* to take advantage of the extra Firepower and Accuracy   So would it be more beneficial to make multiple guns 1 star instead of a few guns 2-5 star? In terms of improvements I am only doing 1 a day so this area has the least amount of play. I am only looking at 30 or less improvements before the event if my mats even hold up, which this 10cm+AAFD is going to break them. Getting multiple guns to 1 star sounds more affordable."
kancolle,3bzklf,Adatia,2,Fri Jul 3 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"No problem. In general, you can pretty much use who you like and it'll be fine. I'm quite fond of some of the trophy DDs and will use them for EO clearing until I get annoyed by RNG and call in the big guns. Even then, it's not guaranteed they'll perform better.  Whether it's beneficial or not is more of a personal preference and more importantly the question of ""what do you use most?"". Do you want to have a single souped-up equipment and equip it to your best/favourite ship, or do you prefer to spread the love and allow each equipment used to have the +1 FP/TP/ASW and +1 Accuracy?   One thing to note is that equipment improvement can be considered late-game activity, as it can be resource intensive and takes up limited improvement mats. That said, improvement mats can be obtained through quests. The consideration now is to think how best to make use of your improvement mats for the upcoming event. If you simply do the dailies, you have about 30 more improvements you can make. Look at your equipment and allocate this accordingly, taking into consideration that reaching certain ★ levels will add additional FP/TP/ASW and accuracy. In my opinion, spreading the love seems better and then you can continue working on them after the event. It's more progressive."
kancolle,3bzklf,TomVP46,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yamato vs Taiho:  Taihou is really just a great carrier she doesnt really do much you wouldnt get from the other carriers.  Where Yamato and Musashi are really expensive trump cards you will use only once all other options have been exhausted, they might save you time but they certainly wont save you resources. Yamato and Musashi is a bit easier to craft since they dont require as much bauxite, but they are also much more expensive to get up to a usable level.   so who should you chose? well do you want a general use carrier? or the if all else fails trump card?   That said now might not be the time to run LSC."
kancolle,3bzklf,TomVP46,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"Would probably prefer another general use carrier over all else fails trump card because fir this event if I have trouble I will likely just drop the difficulty. Depending on the event difficulty I would like to clear hard, but I think I am in a decent spot that medium should be completely doable. I think I might keep trying LSC until mid July as I usually near the softcap 1-2 per week since I am mostly just 3-2A grinding. I will see how my bauxite holds out."
kancolle,3bzklf,Adatia,2,Fri Jul 3 14:48:01 2015 UTC,"I think I'll be mostly reiterating what has been said already, but I felt like sharing anyways.   I would recommend leveling at least one more CAV to at least 50-60 range (higher if you have time, but not mandatory).  In a situation where you require two CAVs you wouldn't want to be forced to sortie a level ~35 Suzuya or Kumano on a hard difficulty map. Keep prioritizing your CAs.  It's really nice (perhaps even mandatory?) to have 5-6 reliable CAs as they're just so generally useful. Definitely follow through on your plan to level Jintsuu up to her Kai2.  CLs are so underutilized by the devs that you can probably get away with just Sendai and in a pinch Naka, but I would feel safer having a second really good CL in Jintsuu.  Fleet locking or potential routing/map requirements needing two CLs are always possibilities. Leveling Kiso to 65 and making her a CLT is more of a luxury than a necessity.  Ooi and Kitakami are all you really need.  If you have time though then CLTs are god-tier and having more never hurts. Keep up your daily crafting for shells.  A couple more Type 3 shells will be nice, but you could also benefit from several more AP shells.  Look into seeing if you can complete quests B31 and B32 for the Type 1 AP shells they give.  If not, crafting 4-5 more Type 91 AP shells should be a top priority.   All in all you're in a strong position and should be fine for the next event.  You have the levels and most of the equipment.  You obviously have done your research and know what you are doing. The only thing you are lacking is some depth in certain spots, but you have a month+ to rectify that.  I hesitate to say ""you'll be able to clear hard no problem"" because we don't know how hard or easy the event will be, but realistically, I think you shouldn't have any issues with aiming for an all hard mode clear."

kancolle,3byc4m,-Byakushiki-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:44:30 2015 UTC,Isn't this bad?   It means the amount of new players has become so low that they don't need to lottery anymore? The game has entered its decline stage?  Oh god please don't decline yet.
kancolle,3byc4m,yamfun,3,Fri Jul 3 09:00:38 2015 UTC,"I think that you're overthinking.  There's no game can always be in the growing stage. If there's no something special (such as the""pixiv flooding"" or that tragic anime) happened, the player number of Kancolle won't increase fast. Does that mean the game is declining? I don't think so."
kancolle,3byc4m,JustiniZHere,2,Fri Jul 3 09:54:44 2015 UTC,"Every game at some point hits a peak or plateau in players, just because Kancolle no longer needs to lotto servers anymore does not mean the playerbase is growing smaller but that the influx if new players is no longer to the point it's needed.  The Kancolle playerbase is still huge, who knows the non lotto server might flood so fast they have to turn the lotto back on for it."

kancolle,3bxv19,nothinfollowsme,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, getting subs is pretty RNG. I got I-8 from construction after 4 tries and I got I-168 from a 1-5 drop. A good way to increase your chances is to do like the wiki says and not use multiple construction docks at once as it slightly boosts your chances of getting what you want with the recipe you are using."
kancolle,3bxv19,nothinfollowsme,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:45:00 2015 UTC,"wait using multiple construction docks at once potentially boosts chances? read through the wiki and never heard of this, interesting. good to know :)"
kancolle,3bxv19,EasyToGuess,3,Fri Jul 3 02:01:59 2015 UTC,"The wiki mentions it, but it's a small bullet point that is easy to miss. Bear in mind, doing this does not dramatically increase your chances, but apparently boosts it ever so slightly. But every little bit helps.  The aforementioned text from the wiki:  ""According to the official Twitter, having more empty construction docks very slightly increases the chances of better ships appearing.""  Bear in mind that it is referencing Large Ship Construction, but we can logically assume that according to the official tweet from the devs, that this applies to standard ship construction as well. It is mentioned in the tweet, but google translate tends to jumble the words and phrasing around of other languages.  To re-iterate: Use only one dock at a time rather than using all of them at once. I think that's how I got I-8 as apparently she is considered ""rare"", even for constructing and acquisition.  So if you have all four construction docks unlocked, you have a much better chance than having just the two.  Regardless, if you don't get what you want, don't let it discourage you. Every girl has potential and you may even get ones you might not think you need yet. Like carriers, heavy cruisers, and battleships."

It's not that hard, it's just the first map that provides some form of resistance and requires some effort from an admiral.  You don't need so many duplicates of subs so you can use all of them as a modernization fodder. Well, you can keep doubles of SSV ones as SS for some hardcore Oreling but I wouldn't reccomend that.  And yes, subs are supposed to be rare. While Imuya, Goya and Maruyu are common, you'd have to grind a lot to see Hachi, Iku and Shioi. That's okay.

kancolle,3bu4ec,iDuane,2,Thu Jul 2 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"Resource raep I'm okay with, but killing a Kanmusu....  : _ :> RIP Akagi..."
kancolle,3bu4ec,ByronicAsian,3,Thu Jul 2 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, that guy made a dumb mistrake, but the extent that people will go to screw him up (to ""teach"" him apparently) is just sad. I guess that 4chan for you.  On other note, how does his browser display his API link like that? Mine only displays the normal app_id link."
kancolle,3bu4ec,hhyloc,2,Thu Jul 2 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"Guy's probably still using the old method of getting into the game. Which is a bit obsolete now with the cookie editing method. (Works fine for me, who plays more on a public cafe)  And FEI, Haven't lost my dignity yet (if I had any in the first place) as everyone else in the shop is too busy playing LoL and DOTA 2. Probably the reason why I can get away with playing this and WoT in the same PC..."
kancolle,3bu4ec,ZeonTwoSix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:46:04 2015 UTC,"Look at the dates in the picture again. He was using API, since the only alternative at the time was a VPN."
kancolle,3bu4ec,v3n0m3k,5,Thu Jul 2 09:33:00 2015 UTC,"It's sad how you are ignoring the people who told him to delete the post immediately and the people who just did nothing with it and focus on a couple of vocal ones to judge about the whole community. And even then they didn't do much harm. I've expected scrapping of all ships when I started reading. And he got himself a Kongou!  And he copypasted this link from F12 in browser, what's the problem with that? My api link in KCV looks the same."
kancolle,3bu4ec,AlmaElma,2,Thu Jul 2 09:24:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying man, it's understandable that it's ""4chan"" but you can clearly see people trying to help the guy out.   In fact someone on this subreddit had accidentally posted their api link instead of what they had intended and I messaged the mods immediately, apparently someone other than me and the owner accessed it and rolled him a Taihou, it's nice knowing that anybody else who opens your api link up is another kancolle player and at the very least have some sort of understanding how much work goes into an account.   I honestly believe this is a lesson learned for that guy, it's not like he lost every single ship or something, I've definitely seen worse cases in the kancolle threads."
kancolle,3bu4ec,vSwifty,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:43:14 2015 UTC,Whoever rolled him a Taihou obviously did not think the risk of getting someone else's whole account banned was much of an issue.
kancolle,3bu4ec,funicode,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you interpret my post as a judgement for the whole 4chan community, sure not everyone there is a troll. But people have known for years that you don't go to 4chan with naivety and expect most people will be nice to you in return.  You even said it yourself:   I've expected scrapping of all ships when I started reading   Say you come to a gang meeting hoping for a tea party, sure maybe there will be a guy who like tea but there're much better places for a tea party.  The same applies to 4chan, if you go there frequently I assume that you already know the risk/grief that may involved when in such a place. But others may not know such risk. Every groups have asshole, but some groups have more asshole than others.   And he copypasted this link from F12 in browser, what's the problem with that?   Not a problem per se, but that can lead to situation like this."
kancolle,3bu4ec,hhyloc,3,Thu Jul 2 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"you don't go to internet with naivety and expect most people will be nice to you in return.   Here, I've fixed you."
kancolle,3bu4ec,AlmaElma,2,Thu Jul 2 11:07:40 2015 UTC,Basically. It's funny how some people think 4chan is 100% evil entirely yet reddit has not a single flaw.
kancolle,3bu4ec,Dopebear,2,Thu Jul 2 12:21:43 2015 UTC,God this was so entertaining LMAO

kancolle,3bu4ec,shiki88,3,Thu Jul 2 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"Wow people are DICKS!  They don't even gain anything from doing this...  If they can use the resource to craft a ship then to trade the ship to their main account, then sure, this makes perfect sense...  But no, all they gain is the feel of pride that they probably made a man cry."

kancolle,3bxbcq,-Byakushiki-,2,Fri Jul 3 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"Afaik, Kanoya server was the previous having disconnect issues. Also maintenance in 5 hours so they can reinforce servers, so hopefully your disconnections will stop."

Hopefully you and your sisters will appear some day... I want you in the anime too!   edit: btw, the sidebar art that makes her look slightly younger or cuter, I like it, but her CGs are spot on for me and I like them a bit more."

kancolle,3by8h4,_tickles,6,Fri Jul 3 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"How do you not know if you played for a while now O-o?    When you sink a ship, that's all that happens. You lose that one copy. It's not gonna remove I-19 or Hibiki completely from your game if that's what you're trying to say. They will still drop from wherever they drop from.    In other news, welcome to the kuso TTK club."
kancolle,3by8h4,senaya,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:44:22 2015 UTC,"oh thanks, thats good. My friend got me into the game a year ago, but we mainly talk about our drops, doujins, and figurines. Somehow i never asked him if ships could be lost forever."
kancolle,3by8h4,nothinfollowsme,3,Fri Jul 3 03:50:50 2015 UTC,"Well, you can get them again, but the New Iku and Верный will have different ids so even though they are the same copies, they are kiiiinda not the same same ships you've lost. It might be a problem if you get emotionally attached to binary code combinations."
