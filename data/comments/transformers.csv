transformers,3dwr9w,NoxPrime,2,Mon Jul 20 12:35:45 2015 UTC,I started this Saturday and for some reason I couldn't get the waist part with the grill and the chest part to line up. I had to cheat and fold over one of the tabs without it being in the slot.  I also had issues folding down the chest windows. They really need to be folded against a hard surface instead of using a tool.

I'm not complaining or criticizing, just to be clear. Rather, I'm merely observing the differences between his style then and now. I feel that his tone now carries more weight, more gravity, and more power whereas the G1 series feels like what it was: a +-23 minute commercial for toys.   He's really matured into the character and it shows with all of the power that he now brings to the voice.  What's REALLY striking the difference between OP and Cullen's normal speaking voice. 0_o"

It's really weird it does that, but oh well, now my Prime's only issue is the weapon storage doesn't stay flush against his back when the ion blaster is actually inside it.

transformers,3dn9ng,blownhemi,4,Fri Jul 17 17:31:01 2015 UTC,"Package was big, a lot bigger than I expected. There's a real nice metallic red on the slipcover and the packaging is something I'm going to keep, which I really didn't expect.  The piece itself isn't bad. The plastic is kind of weak and when it's all untransformed the heights of the individual parts don't quite match but all in all it's pretty slick. The sound effects are a nice tough. I will be hanging this.  The book has nice illustrations and is pretty hefty. Honestly, I don't care too much about the contents, meaning I'll read it once and that's it, but it's a nice conversation piece and part of the collection.  EDIT: I thought I'd use YotH Prime for scale since he doesn't get much attention after I got my MP-10."

transformers,3dojkq,HighDecepticon,3,Sat Jul 18 05:21:12 2015 UTC,Great pictures and nice collection! So those are the Masterpiece toys in the first pic (with Grimlock)?   Is that MP-10 or one of the MP-01 versions?  How do you feel the Masterpiece car robots compare to the Alternator line?
transformers,3dojkq,HighDecepticon,3,Sat Jul 18 06:22:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Yes, those are the MP cars Wheeljack, Sideswipe and Prowl.  That's MP-1 in the background there. I think the MP cars have a bit more engineering than the Alternators, and the limbs look better on the MPs than the Alternators."

transformers,3dojkq,HighDecepticon,2,Mon Jul 20 12:53:59 2015 UTC,Haha.  It was one that I picked up on eBay. It doesn't transform though.
transformers,3dojkq,Two-Man-War,5,Mon Jul 20 15:48:31 2015 UTC,I believe this may be the comparison you are looking for.  Alternators Smokescreen MP Smokescreen MP Prowl MP Sideswipe MP Wheeljack MP Bumblebee MP-01 Optimus Prime (20th Anniversary Edition) caption
transformers,3dojkq,IOnlyLiftSammiches,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:14 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!  Looks like they are similar in size?  Do you feel like it's worth getting the Masterpiece version if you already have the Alternator?
transformers,3dojkq,IOnlyLiftSammiches,3,Sat Jul 18 17:44:12 2015 UTC,"They're very different for the most part aesthetically... MP aims for a cartoon accurate robot form, while Alternators were more about the realistic model car forms transforming into a decent robot form. By modern standards, Alternators are exceedingly kibble-y."
transformers,3dojkq,Two-Man-War,2,Sat Jul 18 22:45:55 2015 UTC,"Are the MPs more ""pose-able"" than the Alternators?"
transformers,3dojkq,blazemongr,3,Sun Jul 19 01:00:23 2015 UTC,"For the most part, yes. Because of various kibble and balance concerns you're pretty much locked into an upright pose. They're generally back-heavy and imo the legs aren't designed to today's standard... they're large below the thigh limiting articulation and the feet aren't designed with action poses in mind.  I think they can look pretty impressive in their own display, but they really don't mix well with MP even if their scale is similar."
transformers,3dojkq,blazemongr,3,Sun Jul 19 17:18:10 2015 UTC,"The Alternator Smokescreen is about 6.5” from head to toe, while the MP version is about 6.” The Alternator is bulkier and more “kibbly” with a few protruding parts, while MP is more streamlined and athletic-looking.  Is it worth it to go MP? As with all things TF, it depends on personal taste. Alternators were a great line for their time. They were inspired by G1 and were an evolutionary step toward the MP-era. It was a bonus if you happened to be a fan of the automobiles of the early/mid 2000s (I was kind of into the Subaru Impreza at the time!)  But at heart, I’m a G1 cartoon guy. I wouldn’t have bought any Alternators if we had a robust line of MP figures at the time.  If size and scale is your biggest hang-up to getting MP figures, we’re both screwed. MP-01 towers over everything and is taller than CW’s Superion and Menasor. I’ve been considering getting MP-10 for a while, but have been too focused on increasing my character roster (mostly with 3rd party figures: Quakewave, Eligos, Andras, and Warbotron) to merit getting a new Prime."
transformers,3dojkq,blazemongr,2,Sat Jul 18 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough reply. I will probably have to invest in some of the Masterpiece cars.   It's too bad they ""adjusted"" the scale after MP-01. I'm with you - I feel like that was a pretty perfect figure and I will have a hard time justifying the purchase of MP-10 when there's other things I want to buy."

The build quality is nice, and all the joints and pegs are tight.  Where it really falls apart is in the paint application.  The lines are not crisp at all, and there is a blob of white paint on Wheeljacks left hand knuckles.  It's pretty easy to overlook from a foot or so away through.  His shoulder cannon snaps in just fine, but is too loose to sit up at an angle.  In summary, it is a quality build overall with some minor QC issues.  At half the cost of the actual figure, I'm not complaining though.  I've got a legit MP Bluestreak coming in the next couple of days, and I'm eager to compare paint apps and other minor details between the two."

The fact that you actually think you are getting a deal on this?  Man are you deluded.  the only thing disappointing is the cheerleading to validate your own purchase.

transformers,3dm6bq,Beatleman65,0,Sat Jul 18 00:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my opinion there's really only $40 worth of toy there. Which isn't too far off what they cost in Japan.

transformers,3dm6bq,trashk,2,Sat Jul 18 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Equal rights for knock offs? No offense but this is a very poor stance.  So a KO is what? $20 to $30? The reason it's that cheap is because they don't have to pay for the mold (I.e. They're not paying takara) and they are not paying the licensing to the car companies.  You would be surprised as to how hard it was to get an MP bumblebee because of VW's attempt to distance itself from war like machines (the company was founded by Hitler if you didn't know). If VW says to Takara ""hey, you said you were making 20,000 Bumblebees and there are 25,000 on the market"" and takara comes back and says the other 5,000 are KO, this could be the motivation VW needs to never license to takara again. So no more variants of BB and since VW owns porche, no MP Jazz. Replace ""VW"" with any other car company and the same result is possible.  I'm not trying to make you feel bad by any means, but I'm sure you along with many others want to see more Masterpiece figures and we won't get them if KO's keep getting bought"

I'd gladly spend $60 for a domestic version, as I already have with Bluestreak (who should be delivered today)."
transformers,3dm6bq,Beatleman65,2,Fri Jul 17 15:42:19 2015 UTC,"I got mine a few days ago and they are magnificent.  A little light for the size (and definitely light compared to the G1 toy) but they are very well done.  $60 is the upper end for something I would pay for this.  If they were $40-$50 or so I would have had all the Fairlady based guys by now.  Of course I grew up with KO transformers, Voltrons, Macross fighters, etc so for me it's not a big deal at all."
transformers,3dm6bq,Beatleman65,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"Bluestreak is lower because r is being distributed and sold to the American market.

transformers,3dikb0,printerx,5,Thu Jul 16 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"There are many many many more paint apps on the SDCC version.  I am very happy to own it and the visorless head sculpt is very cool and works really well with the uniform silver on black head from some episodes in G1.  The visor is also a nice touch, but I might have to touch up the head with some additional paint to make it look more accurate.  To be fair I like the SDCC version better due to just having better QC/paint apps.  It's much more clean looking to my picky side."
transformers,3dikb0,LuvBigHardBlackLotus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"now for those that can only obtain it by shelling out $300, is it 2x the cost of regular devy better"
transformers,3dikb0,printerx,4,Thu Jul 16 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"The figure cost $194 (tax was included in the price) at SDCC.  If the regular figure is $140-$150ish that's exactly 2x devastator cost for one figure @aftermarket $299.99.... The packaging would be really hard to throw away.  The paint apps are awesome but you could probably DIY if you had the paints and if not it would only cost $25.  IMO the 3P upgrades would make a regular devastator pretty badass and it would only cost about $190-230.  Pick your poison man, it is a great figure but I hate markups as much as the next guy.  Had to find the right people to get this thing at cost.  Wouldn't have done it otherwise, but it would have eaten at me because I do like the paint apps and I want to have one in combined mode and then each of the members in bot mode."

transformers,3diodw,cynic79,2,Thu Jul 16 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"I knowww. I loved that miniseries, but I mean Autobots and Decepticons vs all of Marvel or something like that. All out brawl, no morality limiting them"
transformers,3diodw,BrainWav,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"TF universe vs. all comes in Marvel or DC?  Certainly not.  Both Marvel and DC have cosmic-level beings and reality warpers who are only held back by morality or disinterest.  Think of it this way, Unicron was only defeated in the movie because of the Matrix.  That's not going to work on Galactus, Thanos, Odin, or the Phoenix Force.  Those aren't even the heaviest hitters in the Marvel Universe, and any of them could go beat the snot out of any Transformer.  The problem is, few Transformers have any real trick beyond physical attacks or energy weapons.  When you work in what amounts to magic, that's a whole other level."
transformers,3diodw,G0DL1K3D3V1L,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. That's why I made sure to say most of the universes. The Transformers could most likely wipe out the Shi'ar (without Gladiator) and the Kree and a lot of those types of races and maybe even quite a few earthbound heroes. I also like to think that they are quite advanced technologically, so that wouldn't make them too limited, but it may just be my TF bias coming out. But yeah, once they reached the really heavy hitters, tech or not, they'd be no match"
transformers,3diodw,insane66666,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"Speaking of magic... Do Cybertronians have or practice some form of it? I remember in one of the free CW comics that came with the toys, Galvatron warns Nova (IIRC) about meddling with magic by seeking out the power of combination. It seemed like an odd line, but the image of a Transformer Wizard or Sorcerer now seems etched in my mind as something way too awesome to contemplate."
transformers,3diodw,Cincinnativiabelfast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:45:16 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Spider-Man vs Megatron!  Oh wait...
transformers,3diodw,vdubtdi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"I think Iron Man would give them a good battle.  I think Thor or Hulk would kick their asses (Metroplex, Omega Supreme and Unicron aside) Speaking of which, Galactus could probably take care of."
transformers,3diodw,vdubtdi,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Galactus vs Unicron would be pretty epic.
transformers,3diodw,olympic1935,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:51 2015 UTC,I guess there's the problem of how strength scales. Like how tough are Cybertronian metals compared to stuff like vibranium or adamantium? How powerful are Autobot guns compared to similar DC/Marvel weapons? I'd say Optimus prime could probably take on a pile of Sentinels.
transformers,3diodw,InclementBias,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. The strength scaling is what makes me like to think that the Transformers wouldn't be pushovers. They're aliens, their metals and strength and weaponry isn't like earth made robots. For all we know, it could be the same, or it could be a whole different league. (And watching Optimus destroy a bunch of Sentinels would be really cool)"

transformers,3dib80,Piemantwo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:31:27 2015 UTC,I've seen them in my local TRU...in Nova Scotia.
transformers,3dgedw,mushedroom,6,Thu Jul 16 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but we saw all of these a while back at Botcon. Outside of 'that's cooool' are your thoughts on them now that you have seen prototypes in the flesh?"
transformers,3dgedw,TheDesuComplex_413,3,Thu Jul 16 02:55:51 2015 UTC,"The G2 stuff was a new reveal for San Diego. And while we had an idea of how Victorion would look, SDCC was the first time seeing it. It's kind of annoying how SDCC gets a lot of reveals that in the past would have gone to Botcon but that's just the changing industry."
transformers,3dgedw,zodberg,3,Thu Jul 16 04:31:35 2015 UTC,"Considering that they are only a couple of weeks apart, it isn't that big of a deal. SDCC, of course, means that they have a greater presence at the biggest convention in North America. What they showed off sort of makes sense too: all of them are exclusive sets for the future, the G2 stuff no doubt came somewhat into the public eye because of the thousand dollar auctions recently, and Victorion is the result of the huge public poll; all things that strike the public more than the hardcore Transformers fan who knows what the hell a 'Chop Shop' is and why they should be excited for it, for example."
transformers,3dgedw,TheDesuComplex_413,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:41:01 2015 UTC,Goddamn it would be so cool to get a new Chop Shop.
transformers,3dgedw,zodberg,2,Thu Jul 16 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"We are though. Be warned, it is a repaint of the new Shrapnel mold."
transformers,3dgedw,TheDesuComplex_413,2,Thu Jul 16 04:58:02 2015 UTC,"i will say this though... even though SDCC gets a bigger/wider showing of releases, BOTCON has the BEST exclusives hands down. i mean i do like the devastator sdcc release but C'MON the only differences are metallic accents and packaging? ugh. and they only released one more small 3 pack... i think part of it was that last year's ""rocker"" exclusive pack FAILED SO MISERABLY and probably cost hasbro a lot of transformers-cred."
transformers,3dgedw,TheDesuComplex_413,3,Thu Jul 16 19:23:06 2015 UTC,"The 'Knights of Unicron' pack was pretty well done IMO. I also liked this year's exclusives, as they gave us the three fembots released last year and another version the new Devastator.  Comparing the two conventions in terms of exclusives is also not fair. Botcon is made for Transformers fans by Transformers fans and they pull in all kinds of fun references and good repaints, whereas SDCC is as I have said in the public eye. Keep that in mind."
transformers,3dgedw,TheDesuComplex_413,2,Thu Jul 16 19:47:14 2015 UTC,yes! good points. KOU was done well but not well received. i remember the hasbro booth still had that one ready for sale on the last day and then later online. can't win em all i guess lol
transformers,3dgedw,Free_Spy_Check,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:36:16 2015 UTC,your wealth of knowledge is awesome!
transformers,3dgedw,ironmagnus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:07 2015 UTC,"i'm pretty sure SDCC gets the most reveals because of how much more greater the traffic is there versus botcon. botcon is more dedicated hard core true-collectors... versus comic con where everyone just herds through all of the major booths. way more exposure, but i agree, i wish the smaller cons with real fans got more love :("
transformers,3dgedw,vdubtdi,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"honestly i loved the prototypes.  i'm glad there seemed to be a bigger push towards combiners. there were some pieces that were a bit too ""beginner"" but overall i was happy with what i saw for hopefully the future. what did you think about the ones that you saw at botcon?"
transformers,3dgedw,vdubtdi,2,Thu Jul 16 08:49:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like all the product announcements! I don't hate any of them, as I realize that if I do not like them I can just not get them. I think it is a nice idea to repaint some molds as classic Autobot characters and I will be getting a couple of those figures myself, and I knew from the start that I was going to get Bruticus, who looks better than I expected.  The only real disappointment from the reveals is Scattorshot- I do wish they could have put more new tooling into his combined mode and actually made the other Technobots, but as I do not have an attachment to those characters I don't give it much thought. Heck, I even like the Blast Off that they announced at Botcon; not only does the mold look gorgeous in those colors, but I think a fighter jet fits in with the team far better than a space shuttle."
transformers,3dgedw,vdubtdi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:12:31 2015 UTC,honestly that sky reign combiner has me pretty excited... i really liked the proto they  had on display. in my vid i kind of have to keep moving to the next display (partly because tons of people are kind enough to wait for me to finish my vid and also because there's so much to see)...

transformers,3ddt2e,Theroonco,6,Wed Jul 15 14:15:23 2015 UTC,This just underscores why TV writers should ALWAYS treat each season as its own complete story. Don't leave major plot lines hanging for next season unless you have a backup plan to wrap them up quickly in the last 2-4 episodes.
transformers,3ddt2e,blazemongr,3,Wed Jul 15 16:03:19 2015 UTC,agreed. Animated was hit hard by this at the end. They wanted to keep going but CN forced a massive change when they canned S3.  Sadly not a new problem as we all know G1 season 4 suffered huge budget problems for the 3 episodes it got when that story arc alone was supposed to be a 5 parter.

transformers,3ddt2e,mechawreckah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"I liked the multi-episode stories and arcs though. It made the series much less formulaic and helped it tell a larger story you could invest in, along with enabling richer and deeper character development."
transformers,3ddt2e,MiCK_GaSM,3,Sun Jul 19 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"Very cool post!  Wouldn't mind seeing/watching some of the referenced interviews and such, would be cool to know more.    My personal unpopular opinion (I think, at least it used to be): I thought the show was super boring until they started wrapping up plots in fewer episodes and moved things along much quicker in the very late portions of S2 and into S3.  After reading your post, I've got to wonder if the pace would have ever picked up without the more direct Hasbro involvement.    One thing that did bug me with the Predacon stuff on the show is that it ignored the events of the Prime and Beast Hunters comics entirely, even though those exact comics explain why Ultra Magnus heads to Earth to meet up with Team Prime to begin with.  I'm sure the answer is also ""cost"", but it was a shame to not get additional intersect there.  Maybe it was intended when Grimlock was in the plans but then got shelved?    Anyway, again, really cool stuff, and thanks for sharing."

transformers,3dcn6w,iamtheowlman,10,Wed Jul 15 05:50:39 2015 UTC,"For Optimus, go for Takara's MP10 reissue.  It jut came out a few weeks ago so you should be able to find it for 150-180.    For the seekers, MP11 molds are the best so far.  The MP11 molds have the tail stabilizers on the legs instead of hip kibble like the MP6 molds, and also have a heel spur so the figure can stand without a stand.   The MP11 Coronation for Starscream is awesome, but still pricy(150-200). If you don't care for the crown and cape, wait for Hasbro to release MP11 in October to save a  bit of case (the Hasbro one is expected to retail for 100). The only MP11 for Thundercracker is a Hasbro one that came out a few years ago.  Some folks don't like it because the colors don't really match his colors on screen.  He's usually about 100-125 MISB though. Skywarp came out early this year as a limited Hasbro Asia MP-11SW.  His limited availability and Asia issue usually makes him the priciest, at around 200+.   For Megatron, stay away from the Takara's MP.  It's bad, and out of scale now.  Check out the Third Party Apolloyn.  The quality is so-so, but the figure looks great over all.  He runs about 165 new, but if you want to get him, look over the one you pick out at the con CAREFULLY.  Try to ask for a v2 package (better packaging to prevent scratches) and check the helmet, barrel, and chest for scratches before you buy.   Avoid MP Rodimus.  He has a tendency to break, and is kinda a mess.  MP Ultra Magnus is great figure overall.  Some people prefer the aesthetic of KFC Citizen Stack with the add on head, but they're both pretty solid.  The KFC one does tower over everything though.    Soundwave is awesome.  Grab him if you can.  The Takara one is pretty easy to find, but the Hasbro one runs a pretty penny because he has all the tapes.  Only difference aside for the tapes is that Takara's has red eyes and Hasbro has the yellow eyes.    For the autobot cars (Sideswipe, Red Alert, Prowl, Smokescreen, Wheeljack, etc.), most everyone says wait till the last day to pick them up.  A lot of vendors will mark them down to 50 each to avoid having to take them back, and you can probably score a lot of them cheaper than from anywhere else.    Star saber seems alright if you are into the Japanese TFs, but I haven't really examined mine that closely.    There also a lot of unofficial third party toys going to be around that are masterpiece quality you may want to consider.  They would take a bit too,long to cover.  Any specific bot you are interested in?  Edit:  Typos! Typos everywhere!"
transformers,3dcn6w,slideshot,5,Wed Jul 15 06:40:52 2015 UTC,"Some folks don't like it because the colors don't really Mach his colors on screen.   Hahahahaha.  But yes, I'm looking for Optimus definitely, so I'll go the MP10 route. I didn't know about Rodimus and Megatron, and I want Wheeljack - the rest are on my list, but they're not immediately essential (but one day, they will be mine. Oh yes."
transformers,3dcn6w,InclementBias,3,Wed Jul 15 06:55:59 2015 UTC,"what's your opinion on the hasbro mp-10? I  I'm glad you mentioned starscream will be reissued for October, I didn't know that. Acid storm is another mp11 mold if I recall.   Ft just released news on a Quakewave reissue which is known as one of the best 3P masterpiece style figures, and TT/Hasbro haven't really been committed to the decepticons. I just preordered mine."
transformers,3dcn6w,slideshot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:40:43 2015 UTC,"Between Hasbro and Takara's MP10, it's really a personal preference.  Takara's Mp10 is painted and has a slightly darker tint to it, and Hasbro's is lighter tinted.  This gives the Hasbro version a brother palette, making it look more ""animated"" than the Takara's one.  Takara also used a somewhat darker paint on the eyes that made MP10 look""dead"" because the eyes were not reflecting light.  This is supposed to be resolved in the reissue.   Since you will likely see both in person, and they should be at about the same price point, you can likely judge for yourself.  I wouldn't fault you for choosing one or the other based on your personal preferences."
transformers,3dcn6w,whitehusky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"Great post - agree completely.  You didn’t mention MP Grimlock, who’s pretty good, too, but a little small in scale, and if you’re going to end up getting the rest of the dino’s from FT or others, might want to consider a whole 3rd party team.  But in general if all you want is Grimlock, he’s decent if you don’t mind him a tiny bit short.  Soundwave is AWESOME, and MP10 is really great.  I also love the cars, particularly Prowl, Bumblebee & Wheeljack, though Sideswipe/Red Alert is also good.  Ultra Magnus is also very good, and has a very different transsformation than I expected."
transformers,3dcn6w,slideshot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was typing this half asleep, and knew I forgot someone.  MP Grimlock is pretty nice, but has gimmicks that makes the toy suffer a bit.  The light up feature in the arm pretty much kills the articulation of one arm. I'm glad that they got rid of the whole electronics things after MP10, as they tended to compromise molds to run wires."

transformers,3dcn6w,AlphaTyrant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, the reissue has no significant change but please take note that the box does say improved version. It is becos the gas tanks at his hip in vehicle mode is able to tighten better. Chest portion seems better abit in robot mode as well. Other than that everything is identical.   I prefer takara becos of the Cartoon accuracy in terms of the colour(except that the eyes are too dark, but afraidnot i am get getting LED upgrade kit to improve that you could do the same). Roller is in silver paint which is cartoon accurate while the Hasbro gives you blue roller which i dislike it very much and also the takara version comes with kickass box while hasbro gives you some junk box.

transformers,3d6x3l,Cheesenium,2,Tue Jul 14 06:46:13 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I have always been more of a comic guy rather than the toys.  I had a bunch of gen 1 when I was a kid but those didn't survive the yearly yard sales my mother hosted once I went to college. The MPs and quality of the current figures is what reignited my interest in the toys. Who are your big 3?
transformers,3d6x3l,Cheesenium,2,Tue Jul 14 10:49:25 2015 UTC,"I have a Masterpiece Starscream, a Generations Brainstorm and a MMC Hexatron. I am currently thinking of either getting a Toyworld Hardbone, Perfect Effect Warden or Generations Springer/Whirl.  MP is what brought me back to the hobby but third parties made me stay, which I used to have quite a few G1s and Beast Wars. They also did not survive when I went to university."
transformers,3d6x3l,monstrinhotron,2,Tue Jul 14 11:05:56 2015 UTC,"Oh man! Hexatron is definitely on my want-to-get list. Such a badass character and of the reviews I saw, most were super positive. How do you like him?"
transformers,3d6x3l,Cheesenium,2,Tue Jul 14 11:11:06 2015 UTC,"Hexatron is my favorite so far, out of 3 transformers I have and I had played with my brother's numerous MPs. The one I have is the Continuum version that doesnt come with the katana and has painted body. I like the paint job, Hexatron does have a little shine on his body that made it felt more premium than other MMCs, compared to my brother's MMC Azalea/IDW Arcee that has minimum paint apps. Excellent built quality with tough high quality plastic and strong joints which you cant see or feel it in videos or photos.   The transformation is generally quite intuitive and easy, except the part you need to fold the legs in to form the front part of space ship's that had been quite difficult so far. I quite like most of the alt modes, except the gun mode because the handle felt a bit filmsy when you hold it due to the hefty weight of the transformer. My personal favourite is the artillery tank mode, which I find it looked the best among all modes.  Posability wise, I think it is a bit better with what Hasbro or Takara had made so far, especially the legs with articulated foot which can be rotated to fix any pose you like. I didnt like the hands articulation as much as the legs due to his bulky wrist and biseps that sort of limits the articulation but it should be enough for most poses. Note that MMC had improved their products posability after Hexatron. My brother's Azalea posability beats almost every 3rd party and official by miles.  Do get Hexatron if you have the chance and money for one. He is well worth the money while he scales well with MPs and Generations. There is a reason why some people called it the crowd jewel of 3rd party, he is indeed an impressive well engineered third party.  Here is a picture of the trio: http://imgur.com/ZWdOCbN  Since you own a MP Thundercracker, I hope the picture will give you a good sense of scale of Hexatron to your collection. Also, you had ordered Quakewave, Hexatron is definitely a good match for your collection."
transformers,3d6x3l,Cheesenium,2,Wed Jul 15 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"Great breakdown!  Thanks for that.  You definitely convinced me that my life is lacking in the Hexatron department.  He, and your whole trio look great. I will definitely be watching eBay for a good deal."

transformers,3d6x3l,vojelly,2,Wed Jul 15 11:03:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, and Springer is one of the most impressive figures I have run across. You expect them to be that good when they're MPs, but his transformations and pose ability are both top notch."
transformers,3d6x3l,ordith,2,Tue Jul 14 11:13:56 2015 UTC,agreed. i bought Blitzwing when he came out and was disappointed. Found Springer for £12 (about $19.) in a cheap and cheerful tat shop in Hounslow. He's amazing. The only thing i don't like is that there are no springs in Springer. His guns are friction fire.
transformers,3d6x3l,doxydejour,2,Tue Jul 14 12:20:44 2015 UTC,"What do you think of your Springer compared to your Road Buster?  I had been considering Springer, because I am planning to get MMC Spartan so Springer and also Whirl is a good match since they are all from the Wreckers.   Also, I need some color diversification due to all my transformers has white bits on them."
transformers,3d6x3l,GuestCartographer,2,Wed Jul 15 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"Springer is far and away the best figure on that shelf. I was a bit let down with roadbuster.  After getting Springer the bar was set too high for the rest of the generation voyagers, honestly. None of them come close to his plastic quality, paint, transformation satisfaction, quality accessories, and articulation.  Roadbuster has a nice vehicle mode, a large assortment of weapons (but only one good one), and great colors, but he feels light, is back heavy, so there's issues getting him to stand, and his shoulder are weak. If he gets bumped they'll drop from the raised position.   Whirl comes close to Springer in every area except accessories and vehicle mode. His weapons are just bad and his helicopter mode is janky.  It is almost there, but there are huge holes right under the cockpit.  The whole lower section of the helicopter is not great honestly. Whirl also has a glossy finish to his paint that looks really nice."
transformers,3d6x3l,GuestCartographer,2,Wed Jul 15 10:54:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you.  What do you think about Brainstorm? Is he as good as Springer?"
transformers,3d6x3l,Griever114,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:03:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. He does live up to the bar set by Springer. Great paint, great weight, the same posability as Springer. His transformation is good, though removing and adding his head makes me nervous. I'm always worried I'll break it. His weapons are great looking, if a little barebones."
transformers,3d6x3l,SMB73,2,Wed Jul 15 11:14:23 2015 UTC,Very nice! I especially love the artwork and comics.  If I were to ever get a display case it would be one like that. Where did you get it?

I've never had a problem with his limbs coming off, but I've read that it can happen if you try to move his parts the wrong way or in the wrong order when transforming. He seems like he has really limited articulation, but if you don't lock his turret shoulder in you can give him pretty good range of motion.

These little extras don't make it worth it to spend $80 more and wait an additional 5 months for it's release.. Especially considering that if you buy the Hasbro version with ALL of the Perfect Effect upgrade kits getting released in September, you will only be out $10 more than a stock Takara Devastator and still have it in hand 3 months before Takara's is released in December.."

I personally still prefer Hasbro's version- all the additions Takara's has I feel are unnecessary. While some individual elbows are janky or non-existant, I am okay with them because they work out to benefit Devastator as a whole.

Though not a 'main' cast member, the toy is so obvious should just be here  Springer - I would say FP Warbot Defender as he scales better than the voyager one and looks right at home  Magnus - Combiner Wars Magnus. He is a good replacement for City Commander  Wheelie - Legends Wheelie, I think he was a Generations but may have been a Classics. The smaller scale works there for him  Blurr - this is interesting as Generations Blurr just seems so bulky and un-Blurr that I would have to say SXS Overclocking is the best option, even though I am not a fan of how the toy looks overall. An alternative is Animated Blurr, even though he seems out of place, he can fit because he 'looks' fast, whatever that means  Galvatron - UT Manaking was made for this job and he does it quite well  Cyclonus - Generations Cyclonus from the Battle in Space 2 pack is still the best mold in the perfect colors  Scourge - Generations Scourge. Anticlimactic but still appropriate."

But I know you meant within the toyline.  In any case, while I'm not totally happy with some of the directions they've been taking in the last year, I like the notion of Combiner Wars, and to be honest a space shuttle makes no slaggin' sense as part of the Combaticons. And there are some good points: Sky Lynx, for one, and the first actual gun-mode Shockwave in a long time. Even if it is scaled to fit as a combiner weapon rather than in a CHUG display. Or the fact that Megatron could, if you squint a little, be used as a Masterpiece stand-in.  Anyhow, the fact that prices are climbing and they're still trying to get, like, three or more uses out of every mold (they're up to five on the Alpha Bravo mold, counting Victorion and Vortex, which is frankly unacceptable) kind of makes me wonder what's going on in HasTak-land."

transformers,3cz8s1,vdubtdi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. G1 used the Fairlady mold 3x, the Seeker mold 6x, all the minibots from 84 got retools, Inferno/Grapple, Hoist/Trailbreaker, Rumble/Frenzy, Sideswipe/Red Alert, Ironhide/Ratchet... A considerable chunk of the first two years of the line were repaints, but nobody complains when we get Prowl three or four times in a row, because that's ""supposed"" to happen.   In this particular case, it's a sin of necessity. Remember, the Energon combiners were just as bad.  And honestly, some of the reshells are so dramatic as to make no difference. Put Swindle and Rook side by side and the only parts in common are the internal mechanisms. You might as well be mad that Cliffjumper and Bumblebee are ""the same toy"".   Also, I'm not really mad about the waves of '84-'85 guys. I already have reasonable quality modern versions of all of them, but it's been almost 10 years since Classics Mirage came out, and over five since Prowl, Hound, etc.  Those toys are pretty expensive on the aftermarket now, so putting versions of them back out on shelves is a chance for folks who weren't collecting five years ago to add some very popular characters to their collections (plus, they combine!)  I don't need a new Prowl, but I also don't begrudge fans who have been reading the IDW books and want toys of the dudes from the books - we got a new Swerve, Tailgate, etc. pretty much on the popularity of MTMTE, you know?"
transformers,3cz8s1,underscorex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:45:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there have never been any reuses before.. but in CW, 3 Voyager molds account for 13 figures and 9 deluxe figures account for 41 figures - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qmp1Eactd69Wrmnv6mdqO6OHmV_Ok4UZnVOXso51OhI/edit?usp=sharing  This is just out of 2 years worth of figures, and the deluxe numbers could certainly grow if they finish up Computron."
transformers,3cz8s1,ironmagnus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but I find including the G2 repaints, Victorion, and the Collectors Club set to be kind of disingenuous here - what else are they going to make G2 Menasor out of?  We were told from the jump off that Victorion was going to be repaints.  TFCC is always gonna be repaints.  None of those should shock you.   So if you drop those sets, you're down to 9 voyager figures from 3 base molds, with each base mold having at least one major retooling (and one mold getting two serious retools) and around 26-ish Deluxes from the nine base Deluxes, again, with about half of those being serious retools on the level of Off Road-First Aid, and two whole waves at LEAST getting head swaps (almost, if not all the Autobot car guys).  So 26 Deluxes over a year-and-a-half of the line. How does that track with a traditional, less retool-heavy, line?    In a year where there isn't a push like CW, how many Deluxes do we get, and what's the ratio of total new tooling to retool/repaint?  In 2015, we will get by my best guess between 16 and 20 Deluxes. Eight or nine base molds, the rest retools of varying intensity.   In 2014 at retail we got 15 Generations-branded Deluxes, of which Skywarp, Jhiaxus, Crosscut, Nightbeat, and Chromia were repaints/retools.  So we're getting as much, if not more stuff, with combination, and with the kind of heavy retooling we usually only see in 1-2 figures a year.   We're only getting this volume of stuff because of the retoolings. This is how they pay for the things in the first place. Integrating the combination sockets is part of the design budget, too. That's money that could go to accessories, or paint, or a new tooling entirely.   We've been getting at least one pre-tool per mold for what, four-five years now?  Whenever Tracks/Wheeljack dropped, certainly.    Overall, I take the exact opposite approach - I'm impressed with how far they've stretched the budget. It's not lazy, it's actually quite clever."

transformers,3cxzwt,vdubtdi,6,Mon Jul 13 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Not liking the fact that the helicopters are pretty much indistinguishable. Or that HasTak's going all out with the mold reuse. I'm pretty sure that the next molds that aren't a retool are Shockwave and Sky Lynx, and possibly Brawl, and those won't be here for a while.  I mean, good on HasTak for finding a way to cut costs while still hiking prices, but I want a Bruticus that isn't >80% repaints, and Computron's prospects are not looking great either. I wouldn't mind so much if they'd do some more extensive retooling than new heads. Ideally, some distinctive transformation would be nice. There's not a lot to separate Silverbolt, Cyclonus, and Scattershot in robot mode, and they sort of look pretty similar in vehicle mode too. And in torso mode, they're functionally identical. It's a great torso, but I just wish they'd offer more mold variety. I'm sure there are (or will be) third-party offerings, but I only have the budget for Hasbro's offerings.  Such is life."
transformers,3cxzwt,kjata,5,Sun Jul 12 00:06:23 2015 UTC,I think when they're all combined into Victorion it doesn't look bad. They just need to workon the color scheme and the individual bots themselves.

I can't really say why, I just don't like this one that much.  Honestly though, this is definitely on my to-buy list. I haven't bought any Transformers this year.

transformers,3cqhu6,Omegatron9,5,Fri Jul 10 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"My only problem with Victorion is that she needs more silver to break up the colors and could benefit from new molds or more extensive retools to make the bots look more female.

transformers,3cpr7j,TheDesuComplex_413,3,Fri Jul 10 04:24:12 2015 UTC,It wouldn't surprise me if Hasbro decides to show off the deluxe limbs of Computron at a later date.

transformers,3cpr7j,BedDover,2,Sat Jul 11 01:38:59 2015 UTC,Their track record with Combiner Wars has so far been pretty good with putting more effort into figures based off of previous offerings than just slapping a new paint job on them.

transformers,3cpr7j,Free_Spy_Check,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"At BotCon we were teased a shadow of a figure that looked like Computron, so I still have hope.   I'm actually pleased with Scattershot, and I didn't expect to be; they did a decent amount of remolding of the vehicle mold."
transformers,3cpr7j,blazemongr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:59:05 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity I looked it up earlier today: 3/5 of the Technobots (Nosecone, Lightspeed, and Afterburner) were killed in the IDW G1 comics.   I figure that's part of the reason why they haven't released official limbs. Hasbro marketing wants to tie the toyline with the comic line before releasing cartoon homage molds."
transformers,3cor9s,GuestCartographer,10,Thu Jul 9 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"I think everyone here needs to take a deep breath. First, we knew from the start that Combiner Wars would be loaded with retools/redecos. It's almost a necessity to keep all the limb bots the same size. Second, these are likely just mockups, and not indicative of the final colors. Victorion could very well be less blinding in person. Strange how everyone is going crazy for the neon of G2 Superion, but the neon of Victorion is somehow a problem. Third, these are the arms Blades should have had. Come on, a rescue chopper with missiles? Puh-lease."
transformers,3cor9s,The_Flying_Lunchbox,4,Thu Jul 9 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"Breathing just fine here.  The colors are still atrocious.  Really hoping Takara might be convinced to use this mold for their blades/defensor release...  Edit: I think one problem with the colors is that, when voted for, it was presented as a teal main color with highlights of red and silver.  That might have worked, instead the almost equal use of teal and red with almost no silver just looks awful."
transformers,3cor9s,ironmagnus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"I like the colors. And Im not losing any sleep over the design or anything lol, I just kinda dont like that its supposed to be female and it looks male?  Small complaint. I still dont have a single combiner completed anyways"
transformers,3cor9s,mechawreckah,6,Fri Jul 10 01:13:54 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who doesn't hate Victorion? The paint could use some work and the colors could be less vibrant. But it's not awful. What did you expect, new molds that don't just have female heads? This is Hasbro we're talking about."
transformers,3cor9s,Free_Spy_Check,2,Thu Jul 9 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like is the color scheme.  The weapon looks really great, the hands and feet are a huge improvements (and look like they have ankle movement), and the - technically - it is a brand new team.    I'm not going to run out and buy the set, but I don't hate it."
transformers,3cor9s,Free_Spy_Check,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"The feet are confirmed to have Ankle tilts. And the color could REALLY be toned down but the general scheme is not bad. With the hands and feet, they'll probably be a box set (scramble city, play pattern, blah blah) or they will come with the leader."
transformers,3cor9s,KardinBreadfiend,2,Thu Jul 9 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't really like is the color scheme. It's not so much the vibrancy (they're painted, and the painted Botcon figures were similarly vibrant and shiny) but the color scheme. It's just TOO unified for me. They're just an endless sea of teal and red. The new hands/feet (ankle tiiiiilts), the combining weapons, that's all really cool, though."
transformers,3cor9s,Free_Spy_Check,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:19:29 2015 UTC,I totally agree with the colors being too unified. They could really use some silver to break it up.

transformers,3cor9s,trashk,3,Thu Jul 9 22:58:12 2015 UTC,I think Victorion is mis-transformed: her arms are supposed to be the choppers.  I think if you keep the bulk on the legs and the arms nice and thin this looks a lot better.    Since I am balls deep into CW combinerpalooza I am going to get her ... but I may try to do something about the G2-eye melting paint.
transformers,3cor9s,ironmagnus,5,Thu Jul 9 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"Its been advertised that Victorion gains different abilities when the Choppers or Cars are the arms.

But to have two of them on one figure makes me want to scream. And retools and redecos are fine, I'm completely fine with that, but at least make the female characters look like females."

Comixology has all of the current IDW comics. IDW also has their own app, but I prefer Comixology's interface.

This was the one that originally had Starscream in charge of Cybertron. He's still in charge, but post-combiner wars I think this will split time between Cybertron and Earth. Windblade: This will also be partially based on Cybertron as Windblade and Starscream try and connect with * Cybertron's lost colonies and get them to join their new council of worlds.   There's also the new Robots in Disguise series based on the current animated show and Transformers vs. G.I. Joe which is a trippy re-imagining of everything related to both franchises.

transformers,3cmqev,KurtisKiesel,4,Thu Jul 9 02:48:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just wanted to voice some support, since no one participated this week. I really like these weekly poser contests, and I've even submitted photos myself some weeks.  I think part of the problem this week is that there was a lot of SDCC news that probably had people distracted. Another factor may be that a theme like ""Coronation"" when it comes to Transformers immediately brings to mind Starscream, whose new figure is set to be released this month. The problem is that nobody has that figure yet, so a lot of people who might have otherwise participated didn't.  And to be fair, the same might go for next week's Devastator theme. It looks like a few people have found the new CW Devastator in the wild, but I feel like you'd get a lot more participation in a Devastator poser contest a month or so from now.  Anyway, that's just my two cents. Like I said, I really enjoy these, so the last thing I want is for you quit running the contest because you think no one cared this week."

A coronation is a ""crowning"" of someone, so unless someone has made a crown, about the only thing I think you could do would be to pass someone a different head?  I think that Screamer that comes with a crown is the only one I have seen with a crown.    I just wasn't sure how to go about this...  but, I definitely like the ideas you come up with. :)"

transformers,3cmpal,Free_Spy_Check,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:41:04 2015 UTC,Depends on how much you want to pay really. I think Takara magnus is more comic accurate colorwise and has Alpha Trion instead of minimus ambus (which is why I went hasbro instead)
transformers,3cmpal,MalenkoMC,2,Thu Jul 9 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would recommend Predaking.  But only cause he was my favorite combiner back in the day.

The MP-12 mold has a slight issue where the chest hole is too small when you transform him but if you get a ln exactly knife its an easy fix.  Soundwave's cassettes are all pretty good from what Ive heard. The MP-17 mold is pretty much perfect so any variation of it you will be good with. The MP-20 mold is perfect except his gun/tailpipe has an issue pegging in too but it sounds like an easy fix too.  They're all like $30 or so on ebay, so they are a great deal."

transformers,3cmn4h,vinneymack731,3,Thu Jul 9 02:20:44 2015 UTC,"Probably not, since there's no way they can recolour any of the existing combiner wars figures, thus a whole new set of molds would need to be designed.

There's a chance we may get one but i'd expect him to be much more 'Scramble City' styled than G1 authentic, it'd be the only way to make the molds viable - so they'd be retooled into other combiners."

transformers,3cmb2q,GL0314,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:43:46 2015 UTC,"That's actually something that happens the very first time you transform them.  Pop the hands off the wrists so you don't break them, then apply pressure on both sides of the wrist to pop them into place for bot mode.  To get the wrist areas to pop back out for alt mode, slide the arms up and they'll naturally get pushed out.  After you do that once, maybe a few times at most, they should be just fine for regular transformations with the hands attached. They're just really tight to get in place at first, and you have to know where to apply pressure. I hope that helps!"

transformers,3ckufk,photographiks,5,Wed Jul 8 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"It comes down to volume for the most part. Every product has to be designed, prototyped, redone, and finally manufactured. Packaging also has to be made. For larger companies they have the facilities to do all that and will produce enough cheap enough to sell to the masses.   The cost of injection moulding is high.  Exclusivity can be part of it as well and covering the cost of fixing mistakes. Pretty much every third party piece I have bought came with extra pieces to fix issues that were discovered after the piece was sold."
transformers,3ckufk,Buzzsaw_Eject,2,Wed Jul 8 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"Because quantity. For example: If it costs $4000 to make a mold, and you want to make a 100% profit, you can either produce 1000 figures for $8 or 100 figures for $80. This is an extremely rough comparison, but the idea is that HasTak are able to run so many figurss that it keeps the per unit cost down, whereas 3P is a very niche market and they sell far less units. The extra money that you pay does go into the figures though- 3P traditionally has high complexity, tons of paint applications, and has really stepped up in terms of plastic quality."
transformers,3ckufk,TheDesuComplex_413,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"makes sense, but damn they are so awesome. I wish they were a bit cheaper."
transformers,3ckufk,ironmagnus,3,Thu Jul 9 15:15:14 2015 UTC,The people who make KOs don't need to create a new figure from scratch.  3P have a lot more going on with design and engineering. Just one additional factor.
transformers,3ckufk,JaquesNoir,3,Wed Jul 8 19:33:43 2015 UTC,Good point...
transformers,3ckufk,JaquesNoir,-9,Wed Jul 8 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"I just said this in another thread.... Why spend so much money on a 3P product, it's akin to buying a KO Masterpiece. People don't spend the same on a KO as they do the real thing. My logic is that the 3P isn't much different than a KO due to the fact they are both unlicensed products. Both 3P's and KO's are produced in a relatively same manner from the same materials, unless anyone here has done a biopsy comparison of the plastics and paints or has been on the production floors.  Long story short, why are the third party figures so damn expensive, I dunno, they're made the same way the Masterpieces are, but they aren't paying the licensing fees that Takara/Hasbro do. I think they are expensive because people have been paying what they're charging... As soon as people stop preordering and buying the 3P's, they will come down in price.  Supply and demand.  EDIT: To clarify that 3P's and KO's are the same thing, but similar in that they are unlicensed products.  EDIT 2: To clarify that 3P's and KO's ARE NOT the same thing, but similar in that they are unlicensed products. .... Sweet Matrix, I'm an idiot..."
transformers,3ckufk,Buzzsaw_Eject,7,Wed Jul 8 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"I disagree with it being a knockoff MP, the quality can be considerably better than the MP figures in quality of materials and care in manufacturing."
transformers,3ckufk,JaquesNoir,0,Wed Jul 8 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"To clarify I'm not calling 3P's knockoffs... I'm making a comparison.  3P is as unlicensed as the KO's... Quality is suspect on each. Badcube's Huffer had issues from many people, even some of Takara's own MP's had QC issues (looking at you Rodimus Prime). For the most part the KO's are made from the same materials as the legitimate MP's, it's hard to tell them apart.  My theory is : why pay a high price for an unlicensed product like a 3P, but not for the KO's?  ... It feels like a ""6 of one, half dozen of another"" comparison...   I'm not judging people for buying the 3P's, the fact of the matter is: If people keep paying the high price for unlicensed 3P's products those 3P's will keep charging the high price.  Imo, the 3P's price should be lower to reflect the ""unlicensed"" aspect of their industry."
transformers,3ckufk,Buzzsaw_Eject,4,Wed Jul 8 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"I understood that and was saying that I have found the quality of the 3P products I have bought to be superior to the stuff Hasbro and Takara have been putting out mainly in the quality of materials. The legitimate MP's have gone downhill in what they are made of, Wheeljack being one of the cheapest plastics yet on an MP.   When it comes to 3P you are paying for design and manufacturing more than anything else. The knockoffs use existing moulds which they don't pay for, the factory runs during the day to make the legitimate products and at night making the knockoffs. The 3P companies don't have that luxury.   I'm not sure how much licensing contributes to the overall cost of the product so I cannot comment there."
transformers,3ckufk,JaquesNoir,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:39 2015 UTC,"I understood that and was saying that I have found the quality of the 3P products I have bought to be superior to the stuff Hasbro and Takara have been putting out mainly in the quality of materials.   My apologies, then I did not understand you. Sorry.   I'm not sure how much licensing contributes to the overall cost of the product so I cannot comment there.    Licensing can be very expensive, pending the deal... When a company takes on a property like Frozen by Disney and puts them on their juiceboxes, they loose out on chunk of that profit... The licensing has to be done in a way that the Takara makes a profit but makes it worthwhile to Nissan, Ferrari etc to use that likeness. It's gotta be 10% to 20%, pending the company.   When it comes to 3P you are paying for design and manufacturing more than anything else.   In my mind I would think that the Takara/Hasbro toys are manufactured and designed in the same way as 3Ps? How many different ways are there to do this?  I wouldn't think that the manufacturing process was able to differ much, it's still injection molding, it still has to be a certain blend of plastic to hold up to transformation, heat, cold etc... Someone is hand painting or applying decals, shaving off burr's...   Design and Engineering is still the smartest guy in the room, hammering it out on a computer, building maquettes...   Packaging... Packaging I do know and it typically costs between 10% to 40% of the final product. I'd say Hasbro closer to 40% and Takara closer to 20%.  I don't think I understand the difference you're making between 3P and Takara... I would think Takara's products should cost more than the 3P's, the biggest impediment to Takara would be the overhead (staff, marketing and licensing), I don't see the 3P's doing this as much ... Heck BadeCube doesn't even have their own website and they use a Gmail account for communication, seems like a pretty low overhead for a company charging the same price or more for transformers that are economically inline with MP's (Sunsurge the Ferrari brother is $120) with much less overhead.  I guess the biggest difference could be the production run itself... but again, from what I know about production, there is a bare minimum required to get the injection machines up and running and from there the price on that product only drops incrementally by the 10's of thousands, rather than thousands..."
transformers,3ckufk,Buzzsaw_Eject,3,Wed Jul 8 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"No problem, the conversation proceeds from clarifying things and asking questions. Just for the record I'm not the one downvoting your comments, I'm upvoting you.  Takara/Hasbro do pay for design and manufacturing but they have a set process, set people, and their own facilities. They are established companies that know what they are doing and how to minimize costs. Small companies that have 1 to 10 people or however many are in the 3P companies don't have that advantage or those connections. I know one mould can cost from $10,000 to over ten times that.   Takara and Hasbro are combined so the majority of the work is done for two companies and they have volume which allows a lower cost and increased profit. 3P companies don't do that volume, not yet.   Getting the production run going is the major cost, once it is going then the materials and labour are the main costs. That is why I still get ticked when I see how much Hasbro and Takara have cheapened out on their materials."
transformers,3ckufk,JaquesNoir,3,Wed Jul 8 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"Whoa... Takara has their own injection moulding facility?  I understand the cost of die making, even in the Far East. It is pricey. I come from a production background myself, print and design.  I would think Takara's overhead would be comparable to the 3Ps lack of facilities and outsourcing, or would you disagree?"
transformers,3ckufk,Buzzsaw_Eject,3,Wed Jul 8 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"I would assume so, they both produce way more than Transformers so having a facility instead of outsourcing it would make sense. Other big ones like Lego do.   Cool, I'm going by what I read so you would know more than me on that.   I think Takara would have a greater overhead for staff, insurance, buildings, and all that but those are established costs and are spread over multiple products, every product they manufacture. 3P's make one to a few products at a time and that has to cover everything."

This is why I thought Takara should be more expensive than 3P, so in my mind I can't justify the 3P prices.. Typically when a business is operating with a leaner staff, smaller offices, and less marketing they can shelf a less expensive product.  But perhaps Takara is holding their profits low to drive sales overtop of their competition, knowing that they (3P's) can't get into that sort of price war... The earlybird at RobotKingdom on MP-21G is $38 USD, that's a pretty solid price tag, in anyones book, their COGs have to be about $10 on that... maybe $15... That's my theory and I'm sticking to it, Takara is keeping their prices low to undermine the competition."
transformers,3ckufk,Buzzsaw_Eject,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that 3P companies have to rely on other companies to manufacture their product drives up the cost, they are at the mercy of what others charge them."

G2 Stunticons, unreleased G2 GoBots, ATB Megatron, a bunch of other stuff from other lines as well. Seller lists this Menasor as ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" - it is almost complete (missing Menasor's head), in shipping polybags, etc. Dude pays $27k for it. Seller hand-delivers the set, takes the buyer and his wife out to lunch, everything is cool. A month or so later, other fans (including Pete Sinclair of TF Collector's Club and Paul Hitchens of The Spacebridge) go in on the seller's ""once in a lifetime"" claim - there are actually 7-8 complete Stunticon sets known to exist, some with the Menasor head, etc., it's only ""really"" worth about 9-10k, The guy from ""The Toy Hunter"" allegedly has five, the original seller may BE the guy from Toy Hunter under a pseudonym, etc.  Baseless allegations and speculation begin here. The original seller turns out to have (at least) two more sets and the whole thread goes apeshit. The guy who bought them ends up liquidating a ton of his collection because his wife, understandably, is kind of put out (apparently they had just bought a house, too?)

I like the color, but he definitely needs some accents to brake up all that grey.  I'm sure this is in their plans and the picture that we have is just a ""beta"" version.   But in Quakewave's version, I think they should have gone with a darker shade, he looks too bright.  When I think of Shockwave, I think of the guy who was left on a barren planet, so I think dark and disturbed.  But, that's just my opinion.

I ran it through the parts identifier at Transformerland, but didn't see it after looking through several hundred black guns. It is possible that I missed it though.  How big is it? If we had a sense of scale it may be easier to narrow down what class/line it belongs to. The rectangular peg is interesting as well. I know they exist in certain TF lines, but not many. Is it possible that this isn't TF, maybe GI Joe?"

transformers,3cb67f,outsidah,3,Mon Jul 6 16:07:43 2015 UTC,I think they're both kinda fugly but I would pick them up if they were cheaper. I have the feeling this will be one of those we can pickup cheap if we are just patient enough.   For example the clear MP Soundwave which you can now import for about $110 I believe compared to the $190 asking price. I'm still waiting for that one to go cheaper.

transformers,3c8ef6,turbobluestreak,2,Sun Jul 5 21:39:57 2015 UTC,Takara is still a better deal - SDCC Devastator is starting at 299 up to 499.

transformers,3c8ef6,dajoeker,2,Sun Jul 5 21:54:55 2015 UTC,It's a good thing that Takara already announced theirs because its collector-oriented changes will be keeping the price down on this collector-oriented piece.

transformers,3c74yd,megamartron,2,Sun Jul 5 14:49:03 2015 UTC,get it. Way better than hasbro's year of the horse mp-10. Takara mp-10 is one of the best mp's to have. Best price is @ hlj and one of the only places you can get it at that good price. Link http://www.hlj.com/product/TKT39840/Sci  edit.. Takara mp10 won't be around long vs devestator and prices for mp10 are gonna go higher than devestator as well. Start with mp10. In my opinion of course.
transformers,3c74yd,nwong695,2,Sun Jul 5 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"I think the combiner wars devastator looks great, but if I were you, I would not get it, mainly because it does not scale well with the mp collection.

transformers,3c74yd,nwong695,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"Scale is pretty important to me, I think I could pull it off though if I didn't have MP1 which towers over everything and put devastator by himself (I have the classic glass ikea display).  Thanks for the input."

At this point importing the Takara one from HLJ will save you like $10.  I'd rather spend a few more bucks and have good customer service to back it up.  If you go with the Hasbro one, it should come with a little additional accessory vector sigma.  Takara has a little darker paint, Hasbro's looks lighter like the cartoon, but it isn't painted, just molded plastic if that matters to you.  Hasbro's is $30 cheaper.  You should definitely get him.  You'll probably be able to get Devastator easily for the next 6 months until like Christmas time I bet, and will probably find deals on him since everyone has him and not just TRU."

transformers,3c5zxc,OtherDimensions,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:26:30 2015 UTC,Any of these stop motions blow my mind.  The biggest thing is how they transform them in place and take each shot.  Do these guys use green stands and chromakey them out or something?

The combiners do add a goal to the game, but are too weak against higher level noncombiners.  You will play against bots more often than not.  I also suggest the other two games, but as a person who gets nausea or motion sickness easily, I can only put in 15 minutes at a time.

A few reasons I've heard -   it's been quoted as a Takara mall exclusive, not available anywhere else it has clear plastic in the windshield and lights - this usually means that a extra set of parts apart from the main mold were pressed at extra cost, which Hasbro would likely not want to do. it has two hand guns in addition to the hand/foot thing, which is another extra part cost for making the mold. there is already a motorcycle groove for hasbro' defensor.   I would really like it if deluxe groove came to hasbro or even if Takara sold him separately, but it doesn't look like it's happening.  I think the first we will see if his mold is a heavy remold for Computron.  SDCC is this coming week though, so maybe Hasbro will surprise us with it hopefully."

transformers,3c111v,puppyaddict,5,Fri Jul 3 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"i grew up with G1 and sold all of my childhood collection back in 1999 to buind an instant comic book collection. i since then have obtained a lot of transformers from beast wars up to energon, and generations, a few from the movies but never liked their look.. then i descovered MP TF's.. being im a truck driver and have been for some 5 years now i was in a vaccume not knowing about them aside from the orrigional MP optimous prime i picked up thinking it would be a 1 of.. once i descovered they turned MP in to a steady line i began my MP collection.. currently have starscream, thundercracker, soundwave and all his cassets, silverstreak, red alert, wheeljack, prowl, bumblebee (with spike), sideswipe, smokescrean, grimlock, star saber, ultramagnus, and both MP optimous primes, also have the giant metroplex. not really a MP but i consider it worthy because of it's awsumness and size... then after over a year of debating with my self i decided to start getting some of the 3rd party pieces if the quality was as described.. i had large reservations dew to the notion they would just be cheap but over priced KO's so i went in small at first.. i got the 3rd party hands with fully articulated fingers for prime, the nicer looking version of the shoulder weapons for prowl (along with the officialy released decals to bring his detail quality up to snuff), and the 3rd party head for metroplex.. and the 3rd party head was just as amasing as the official factory head was dissapointing if not more so.. thorualy happy i decided to go in hard and deep and for the first full 3rd party got the cheaper but better looking version of devistator.. and while it wouldent pass for a twin from a better mold it is a lot better, and  more complex than i expected.. even has well desighned and thought out mechanisims for mantaining limb and body assembly in combined mode... and as of now my most recent purchase the 3rd party megatron that is G1 megatron in all but name... also got the officialy lisanced decepticon emblem decals takara/tommy so conveniently released for it and any future purchases.. was a bit dissapointed with this one tho because the arms are on ball joints that pop off easy and the weight of his shoulder cannon +the less than tight ball joint make it impossible to fully extend the arm with gun on w/o it slowly pivoting down, but considering he is literally facing off with energon mace in hand against prime with energon axe in hand right in front of my keyboard it's a minor issue.. think i may get the best looking (most expensive and MP prime size) 3rd party astrotrain next."

So if you ordered from either of these places or another specialty store I'm relatively sure they will send you a replacement with little hassle (you'll probably need to provide pictures) if you bought it at a store then your mileage may vary. You could try to return it for a refund or you can contact Hasbro, but they don't always replace same for same, sometimes they send items of ""equivalent value"".  But no, you are not alone, I'm pretty sure the foot thing on Magnus is a somewhat common issue as I've seen other comments here and elsewhere saying they had it as well, because of this maybe you could get some more traction out of Hasbro for a replacement.

That's been my barrier, too, so I can't say if it fits scale-wise, assuming you care.  Fall of Cybertron Shockwave is pretty close to CHUG style as well, and you can manipulate him into an oddly-proportioned gun mode if that floats your boat.  Masterpiece is generally somewhat too big for proper CHUG display. The Seeker mold is roughly Leader-class. Can't talk about any others outright, though.  The rest of Fall of Cybertron is a pretty good source of Cybertronian bodies in a CHUG style, if you don't mind a mix of Earth bodies and Cybertronian.  Reveal the Shield matches CHUG looks as well, although I believe it's commonly considered to fall under that heading anyway, so this may be something you already know. The ""Battle in Space"" set Cyclonus is the most cartoon-accurate version of the mold, by the way.  You could look into 3rd-party stuff, but they mostly have a Masterpiece boner at the moment. Can't really blame 'em, seeing as their target market is adults who prefer poseability over not having to pay $400 for a combiner.

transformers,3bv5s6,GuestCartographer,2,Thu Jul 2 13:40:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly.  The bot modes are nice, but I'm buying the set to be Devastator.  The individual guns would just sit in the box, the elbows are a non issue, and the paint apps can be pretty easily replicated."
transformers,3bv5s6,NotAFgt,6,Thu Jul 2 18:01:02 2015 UTC,Honestly at that price I'll just save and get green giant.
transformers,3bv5s6,NotAFgt,3,Thu Jul 2 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that extra cash pays for better paint apps, more articulation, more involved transformations, better proportions, better individual bots, etc. The size of GG I actually prefer so that it scales better with other combiners from both 3P and official and doesn't tower over everything else.   This is all my opinion though."
transformers,3bv5s6,kracov,2,Thu Jul 2 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm, but this is Takara though.  It's the most cartoon-accurate version. MP Optimus is 10 inches, so GG would not look right being only a few inches taller.  In real life, construction vehicles are as large as a semi truck and in the cartoon, Dev does tower over everything else.  Articulation, as most people said matter little because Devastator is in combined mode 99% of the time."
transformers,3bv5s6,NotAFgt,2,Thu Jul 2 18:41:28 2015 UTC,"And if he's a good fit with your collection all the power to you. Personally I'm more of a CHUG collector so Green Giant is a good fit and in my opinion scales very well with the rest of my figures.   If articulation of individual modes doesn't matter to most people that's great! But personally, for me, the extra $100 is worth it because I like transforming and posing my figures in a variety of ways very regularly. I just don't see myself getting as much value out of the CW devs.   I also don't really care about MP figures that much so it scaling or not with Mp10 is irrelevant to me.   Again, just my opinion."
transformers,3bv5s6,LuvBigHardBlackLotus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"i believe most people are aware of Giant's strengths and short comings. but many people are on the CW train cause this has been best MP-scaled combiner to date, and it's definitely something many of us are waiting for. even Warbotron's size is still too small for a proper scale  also i believe Feral Rex, Ordin, and Warbo have better CHUG-scale than GG  a nice voyager sized CHUG optimus would scale very nicely to this guy  here's a scale chart  Giant compared to Rex and Herc"

transformers,3bviit,Windtalk3r,2,Thu Jul 2 14:43:49 2015 UTC,You may find them cheaper at TFsource or BBTS. Amazon prices on Transformers tend to be over-priced.

He's a hell of a lot more stable too - much easier to pose, none of the floppiness and joint issues Menasor has.  Definitely my favorite combiner so far."

Can't wait to have the two of them to face off against each other."

This lead to the /r/IAmA sub to go private while they figure out how their AMA's that have been derailed are going to work.  Several other of the default subs opt'd to go private in protest, not solely because of her firing, but also because of the lack of communication that it happened, and many subs have had issues with communicating with admin and get issues resolved.

transformers,3brsxa,Ratamakafon,7,Wed Jul 1 17:04:51 2015 UTC,I'd go g1 but I actually remember watching them as a kid so I've got some nostalgia for it. Overall it holds up decently you just have to remember it's basically a 20+ minute toy commercial. I did also enjoy animated for the story but I felt like there were a few nods to g1 that you will miss if you start there
transformers,3brsxa,alongside84,2,Wed Jul 1 17:18:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, thought I'd start with G1 anyway, I can stand the cheesiness.   It continues into Beast Wars, right? The concept of animal-Transformers and that early 3D animation kinda puts me off from watching it. Is it recommended?"
transformers,3brsxa,ToaChronix,4,Wed Jul 1 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"Beast Wars is good. Beast Machines not so much, you could probably skip that."
transformers,3brsxa,MisterValiant,4,Wed Jul 1 17:34:33 2015 UTC,I actually watched the first four episodes of Beast Machines when I was a kid. I remember having no idea why Transformers were animals all of a sudden. What's the story behind that anyway?
transformers,3brsxa,Jonathan_Freeloader,11,Wed Jul 1 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"They were trying something new with Beast Wars, to keep the franchise fresh. The plot explanation is that they land on a planet with (a) only organic life, no machines, and (b) too much energon. Overexposure to all that energon would cause their bodies to go into ""stasis lock,"" and so they make bio-mechanical alt modes to cover their metal bodies to go out safely.  Personally I'd start with G1, but don't feel bad about skipping episodes. Some of them are really good, and some of them are absolutely terrible, so if you're not really feeling a particular one, move on, you won't miss much. It's goofy action and there's not a ton of overarching plot. After the first two seasons, watch Transformers: The Movie, which is incredible in its own right and sets up the third season, which deals a little bit more with the origin and history of Cybertronians as a species.   After that, yeah, I'd go to Beast Wars. It also has some goofy moments, but there's a deep, complex story there that takes a while to uncover, and it's worth it. I'd skip Beast Machines entirely. On paper it's a decent idea (balancing their machine and beast halves), but it's a terribly-written show full of plot holes and nonsensical plotlines that lead nowhere. It was a big letdown for me.  If you're only going to watch one series, I'd pick Animated. I didn't get along with the visuals at first, but they grew on me over time. That said, it's got some of the best character development and overarching plots the entire franchise has to offer. You'll get more out of it if you see at least some G1 first, but it's not essential.  And if you're still hungry for more, I'd say watch the first five episodes of Transformers: Prime, but watch them back-to-back, like a movie. I feel like they stand up okay on their own. The rest of the series goes from okay to pretty weird in pretty short order, and I lost interest the further it went on.  Oh, and if you've got younguns and/or don't mind shows aimed more at children, Rescue Bots is actually very, very good. It has practically nothing to do with the Autobot/Decepticon war, and focuses more on integrating disguised alien robots into a human society. It's a different focus, but it's endearing, charming, and genuinely funny."
transformers,3brsxa,starsaber,3,Wed Jul 1 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks for the advice!   Any thoughts about the Armada series?"
transformers,3brsxa,Jonathan_Freeloader,5,Wed Jul 1 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Armada despite its flaws, it actually starts off kind of bad but if you give it a chance it gets way better. The same cannot be said for Emerging Energon though.   Edit: autocorrect."
transformers,3brsxa,starsaber,5,Wed Jul 1 20:16:48 2015 UTC,what are your thoughts on cybertron? I thought the way it looked was a bit distracting (CG transformers and more of a hand drawn look to earth and the humans) but the story was ok and humans were only a bit annoying.
transformers,3brsxa,pulley999,3,Thu Jul 2 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"I feel about the same, I always like the more cartoon look of Armada and G1 so the cgi of Cybertron didn't sit that well with me. It was better in the technical area but it had a lot of plot inconsicites with the other two shows so I always considered it the odd one out. I will say I loved  Cybertrons toy line though."
transformers,3brsxa,Gib_Rock,2,Thu Jul 2 01:09:43 2015 UTC,cybertrons toy line is either my favorite or second favorite toy line.  (it has my favorite megatron mold)
transformers,3brsxa,MisterValiant,2,Thu Jul 2 01:15:41 2015 UTC,IIRC in Japan Galaxy Force was a different plot entirely but Hasbro wanted a trilogy so they stapled it onto Armada/Energon the best they could.

transformers,3brsxa,chronoserge456,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:59:31 2015 UTC,"Beast Machines is set after Beast Wars by the way. So basically, the Predacons (decepticon decendants) stole a golden disk thingy and are looking for energon, and them and the Maximals (autobot decendants) end up crashing on prehistoric Earth (cause time-warp drives or whatever). So Earth is full of raw energon, which causes both sides to overload due to energon buildup, so they scan local wildlife and assume beast forms which protect them from energon buildup. Then fights happen and stuff."

transformers,3bngvw,ironmagnus,2,Wed Jul 1 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"Airwolf:       Airwolf is an American television series that ran from 1984 until 1987. The program centers on a high-tech military helicopter, code named Airwolf, and its crew as they undertake various missions, many involving espionage, with a Cold War theme.  The show was created by Donald P. Bellisario. The first three seasons star Jan-Michael Vincent, Ernest Borgnine, Alex Cord, and (from the second season onwards) Jean Bruce Scott. After the original series was cancelled, a fourth season, with an entirely new cast and on a much smaller budget, was filmed in Canada for the USA Network.  The show's distinctive musical score, which was originally orchestral but shifted to more synthesizer-based arrangements early in the second season, was composed and mainly conducted by Sylvester Levay. Udi Harpaz conducted the scores for many later second and third season episodes.    Image i     Relevant: Airwolf (NES video game) | Airwolf (helicopter) | Jan-Michael Vincent | Donald P.

transformers,3biw4d,GuestCartographer,6,Thu Jul 2 23:52:34 2015 UTC,I... suddenly regret not buying the Aerialbots...
transformers,3biw4d,danweber,5,Mon Jun 29 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"I always thought they were lame figure.  Each a box with a plane chassis glued on, with pegs to combine.  The Combaticons had more diversity with their two fliers."
transformers,3biw4d,Omegatron9,3,Mon Jun 29 18:05:50 2015 UTC,I found the CW Aerialbots to be surprisingly diverse and their plane modes are actually pretty good.

transformers,3biw4d,Tformers82,3,Mon Jun 29 22:46:41 2015 UTC,You hit the nail on the head.  Starscream and Co convert from robot to plane.  The Aerialbots have always just looked like a bunch of guys with planes on their backs.

transformers,3bi57i,dukefett,3,Mon Jun 29 13:23:13 2015 UTC,They do it because of the perception among retailers that high-priced toys need to be big and impressive on the shelf. It's very annoying if you're the type who likes to hold on to boxes.
transformers,3bi57i,TrandaBear,2,Mon Jun 29 16:32:53 2015 UTC,He's in car mode in the Takara. I'd be curious to see how much packing material there is. The Hasbro boxes for Grimlock and Soundwave are huge too but at least with SW it's because of the 5 tapes and Rumble/Frenzie's accessories.
transformers,3bi57i,dukefett,2,Mon Jun 29 14:02:59 2015 UTC,I know right? The money they save on modest packaging could be put into making more figures. I want one... just never seem to be in stock at my local TRU
transformers,3bi57i,TrandaBear,3,Mon Jun 29 16:37:50 2015 UTC,The money they save on modest packaging could be put into making more figures.   The cardboard box is not a large cost factor.
transformers,3bi57i,dukefett,3,Mon Jun 29 18:03:04 2015 UTC,"True, but in mass production, a 50% reduction in any material is going to save money. This industry lives on small percentages to optimize profits and cut costs."
transformers,3bi57i,primeleo,2,Mon Jun 29 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"I get that, but either way, them saving money on the production won't necessarily translate into them producing more figures.  If more people bought them, then they'd make them.  Prowl shelfwarmed, I expect Bluestreak to do the same unless they downsized the production because Prowl didn't sell well."
transformers,3bi57i,gabe2068,3,Mon Jun 29 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"Prowl shelfwarmed?!? That was the one I wanted the most. I think my personal experience has varied because my TRU is always out.

transformers,3bjfx8,vdubtdi,2,Tue Jun 30 01:04:16 2015 UTC,I bought a TF from a guy in China and the cost of the toy was the same as TFS or BBTS but the shipping was an absurdly low $5. I'm guessing that in my case he gets them for cost and part of the markup goes to shipping. Is this guy selling them closer to cost with an honest shippin rate or trying to profit on shipping?
transformers,3bjfx8,dukefett,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:37:41 2015 UTC,"You actually can't profit from shipping on eBay.  eBay takes 10% of BOTH the final price and the shipping cost.  So you can't make extra money on shipping since it's the same % taken.  One thing I have heard of though, with high shipping prices, if there are problems, the seller might only have to refund you the purchase price.  So if you have a $100 item that has one auction with free shipping and one that's $10 for the item and $90 shipping, go with the free shipping one.  If there's a problem, you might be out $90."
transformers,3bjfx8,vdubtdi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't know they took a cut from shipping. They could still be charging more for shipping than they need though, right? Or is that pretty close to how much shipping from China is?"
transformers,3bjfx8,dukefett,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're definitely charging more for shipping.  Like I said in my last post; if there's a problem, you might only get refunded item cost or something.  Shipping from China isn't that expensive actually; unless you're sending it fast.  Like to get it in a few days it would be like $20-30 maybe.  But they're sending it the slow method that takes like 10-14 days at least, depending on where you are."
transformers,3bjfx8,vdubtdi,2,Wed Jul 1 20:37:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I was surprised that the shipping for mine was only $5 and it came in about 2 weeks.

I was under the impression that the Platinum release included no die cast, but I was very mistaken. I'm not crazy about the robot modes individually, but combined he's goddamn sweet.

transformers,3bjk8z,SMB73,2,Tue Jun 30 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"WARNING - it's true, the diecast is there, the colors are very nice, stickers are reliable. BUT as an arm, Divebomb is a really poor connection, dangling a bit at best or falling right out at worst. From what I've read this is consistent across the release, the peg mold is either too small or the clasping mechanism is too weak. But I got them for animal modes to display with Feral Rex anyway."

They did something similar with Starscream a few years ago and made the Skystriker have his markings and resemblance. Also, I believe they did one of the Jeeps as Hound, and I believe these were ComicCon exclusives  http://news.tfw2005.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2011/07/GIJOE_Skystriker_SDCC_1309982310.jpg  http://static.seibertron.com/images/toys/files/190/r_sdcc-2013-blaster-073.jpg  THE Hiss tank is Shockwave and the green VAMP is Hound.

transformers,3bibcy,MalenkoMC,6,Mon Jun 29 13:32:51 2015 UTC,"The only advice I can give if you are going to collect these as an investment is: Don't.  You will lose money.  If you bought them 10 years ago cheap, before the reissues then you are sitting in a good spot but from now on, you will never get a return on any investment in Transformers without a whole lot of work and spent time; invest in gold.    Now, if you are looking for a collection that will give you the maximum bang for the buck, you have to decide what you want.  Original G1?  G1 Reissues?  Are KO's ok or not?  Is it more important to have a good looking shelf full of boxes or bots?  Are you ok with spending $100 on a great Autobot car instead of $20? (Because there is a huge difference in quality and condition for the money)     Basically, it comes down to one thing; if you see it and like it, get it.  If you look at a price and feel like it's worth it, it's worth it.  You WILL overpay for a few Transformer, you will also get great deals on others-you try your best to justify your spending with rules.  Make those rules and stick to them; if you decide to change the rules, that's fine-but after you change them, stick to those rules you decide on.    Everyone collects something different and we all have different goals, make sure your short and long term goals are easily outlined for you.    Look at other collections; get some ideas from specific collectors, ask them what they paid for it; in 1984 the toy line was kind of small and now there's so much that falls into G1, you really have to do your research to know where your boundaries are.    And remember, display is important; sometimes it's a $5 shelf and sometimes it's a lighted display case-it's a cost you will incur that you will not get any return on but it's important to plan for it and the space you will need to keep everything in.  Many of a collector here have been victims of downsizing due to overgrown collections.    I hope I helped a little and you are always welcome to ask any questions you like but please...not for the money because you will have a bad time.  It might look good short term here and there but you will never get the $$$ back for the time and money you spend on this hobby-eventually the kids that grew up on Beast Wars will be the collecting majority and the G1 bots won't be quite as sought after as they are now."
transformers,3bibcy,canuslide,2,Mon Jun 29 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"Money making isn't the reason by any means.  I know toys are not a good investment.  For me it is nostalgia and getting that kid feeling when I get a new toy.    As I have said for others, i want to replace some of the ones I had when I was a kid, get a few others that I never got to get, and pick up some for me and my son to play with (reissues will probably be good for this).  I want to get something that I can pass onto my son.  Something that he will appreciate and pass onto his son.  Transformers were a big thing for me when I was his age and I want him to have something like that too.  Something outside of video games.  Thankfully, he is very active outdoors, so TF playtime will be for rainy days mostly. :)"
transformers,3bibcy,canuslide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"Coll, all good reasons to get them; reissues are pretty inexpensive, maybe-the $25 and under mark in resale/retail locations like disk replays or other places that sell toys.  Ebay is a decent gauge for prices but they are usually the high water mark for things.  Also, replacing stickers from reprolables.com is always a safe bet.     If it's not 100% original, it doesn't matter what you do with it.  If it comes 100% original, it's good to keep it looking and working original-otherwise, it won't come close to fetching the same collector.  Be weary of G1 cars that look too-good out of box; there are KO's of everything and if you get a KO that's been beat up a bit it means you paid too much, no matter what you paid.    To get an idea of G1 KO's, reissues, originals and whatnot; take a look at Transformerland.com and TF-Direct.com and as always, the resources in the sidebar to the right.  Good luck-and remember to show off those pictures when you get them."
transformers,3bibcy,canuslide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"Biggest issue I have is figuring out if it is a KO reissue or not.  Is there anyway to tell by looking at the box?  I keep reading that KOs are not good quality (cheap plastic), so I am trying to stay away from them.  I noticed one person showed a KO as Takasa Tony where the legit is Takara Tomy.  But not all of the boxes have that branding.  That's a good point about the 100% original.  So I guess that replacing the stickers to make it look better, but be more for the looks.  It's probably not something I would do right away anyway.    I've been all over transformerland.com, but haven't checked out TF-Direct.com yet.    Looking online, I don't really see many reissues going for $25.   But it is nice to know that that is the pricepoint I should be looking for when it comes to some of those.  A lot of the pieces I want have redesigns, so eventually, I'd like to get the redesigns as well.  Once of the biggest ones I had as a kid was Predaking and with Beast Hunters, he is no longer a combiner, but still amazing.  I'm hoping that they do a Metal version of his BH dragon look.  Would be a great piece :)  Anyway, thanks a lot for the help.  I'll definitely read up on the sidebar stuff too!"
transformers,3bibcy,canuslide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, there is a lot more that you are going to be excited about later then; you haven't scratched the surface yet-    Ok, the KO's you are looking at with the box variation are Masterpieces; they are KO'd to death but the good news is there are TONS of comparison videos of Masterpice originals VS KO's.  MP's go for $75-$150 and UP depending on the character.  KO's go for $35-??? depending on the character (about half the market retail price) but original G1 toys that have been KO'd are pretty close in plastic and everything.  The MP's are easy to tell KO's from simple markings but the quality is exceptional and they usually let you know if it's a KO or not.  The original G1 toys are not so easy and you should make sure you do some youtube research.  The original simple toy reissues are inexpensive but those MP's you see on here that are cartoon accurate are pricey and your wallet might hate you for a while.    Predacons/predaking/beast hunters are much different from each other.  The newer TF: Prime cartoon is a good watch to find out what that's all about.  A 3rd party Predaking is the best you will find currently-but he is pretty expensive-around $100 per figure."
transformers,3bibcy,Antnommer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know the original Predaking was built around Animals (Lion, Eagle, Bull, Rhino, Jaguar).  So when I watched the Prime Beast Hunters series and the redo of Predaking, I was like WHAT?!?!  But he was awesome in that toon.  So I decided that I would eventually get him.  I'm looking forward to some of the newer stuff as well.  The fact that they are pose-able and stuff like that is awesome!  During my ebay searches, I've come across many add-ons and upgrade kits.  It's pretty crazy.  Just found out today that there is a collectors club and botcon!  HOLY CRAP!  Sad that it was in Chicago this year and I didn't know about it, lol.  Maybe next year! :D  Research is always a big part of any purchase I make.  Which is why ebay is bad for me, LOL.  Time crunches get me in trouble and I often end up buying something that I really didn't want or pay a bit too much for it.  Glad you said something about the MPs being copied.  I found a guy selling some that say Takara Tomy on them for $40.  I thought that was a good sign, but maybe I'm wrong.  Will do another search on Masterpiece Transformers and see if I can see the difference there. :)"
transformers,3bibcy,Antnommer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:35:03 2015 UTC,cool.  I know you'll get everything sorted out; just knowing what direction you want to go in is the main thing to get down-and set those limits/rules.
transformers,3bibcy,dukefett,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"Probably the most common G1 figures I see are the Insecticons. Not sure why. That and Inferno, though he's usually missing everything. Micromasters are also fairly common.  You can absolutely build a figure, and that's how most people get their older figures completed. You can check out Reprolabels for reprints of sticker sheets.  If you just want the nostalgia and don't mind a figure that's a bit worn or not complete, you should have a relatively easy time of collecting. Go to flea markets, yard sales, and keep an eye on CraigsList. Also check out comic and toy conventions if any are in your area. You might even post to your favorite social media platforms and ask friends and family if they have any old Transformer toys laying around they can part with."

Obviously wanted to start with Prime, but had chances at Magnus and few others too, just usually end when I am asleep or otherwise busy and can't get to it.  Guess it is time to put the ebay app on my phone! lol  Thanks for the help.  Any ideas on good things to use for sticker removal?  I was thinking goo gone, or something like that, but was afraid that it might hurt the plastic?  I've never done anything like this and didn't want to kill a purchase by using the wrong stuff. :)"
transformers,3bibcy,dukefett,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"Isopropyl alcohol is the standard for removing stickers, I believe. I think you want something around 70%. Use a q-tip to apply directly to the sticker. I could be wrong about this, though, so you might want to do some research, as some kinds of plastic may become more brittle."

The gap in Starscream's groin plate fits perfectly around Megatron's groin (giggity...) and his upper legs rest on top of Megatron's to support some of the weight.  His arms then fit around Megatron's neck, though it does take some fiddling with the angles of the various joints, but once you have it just right, it really locks in around Megatron's horns.  Megatron's main gun still faces forward on the side, you can lift up Starscream's missile launchers, and his combined sword weapon scales great in Megatron's hand.  Edit: Sorry bout the dust on Megs... don't play with him much."

An Inferno or Grapple may sound fun to me now that I'm still waiting on my Hot Spot to arrive, but once I enjoy him, then the similar Onslaught, then the Victorion torso, I may feel a bit different.  Add to that the retail Onslaught variant and the possibility of gift sets featuring Bruticus and Defensor done up as repaints their original toys had from different eras, like the G2 Superion set we know is coming.  Same goes for some of the limbs that will have seen a lot of use once all of the revealed waves are out.  Victorion's got 2 helicopters to add to the pile of 3 I'll have by the time she's out.  I'm still down for her and interested to see what they come up with for any new combiners, though.

It lets them focus on better paint and appearances for the characters, and keeps costs down. Plus, the stability of a figure is especially important when it forms part of a bigger combiner; by using engineering that they know works well, it means we have less of a chance of getting a combiner with a messed up limb.  The only issue I have seen is that QC-related issues have popped up a time or two. This isn't super good, but thankfully most of the issues are easily remedied."

transformers,3b2r20,SMB73,2,Thu Jun 25 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man, see I also kind of want to get Carry too except he seems huge in bot mode and small in alt mode. I like that MP figures have the nice clean lines that balance the G1 toy/cartoon aesthetics (and I think the new MP style 3P Blurr fits that bill a little better), but I don't own any MP. (Yet)  My collection is about 50/50 G1 and CHUGs. Most of the old toys I have are very paneled and greebled and so are a lot of the CHUGs (Classics Jetfire being a great example.) I got where they were going with Generations Blurr, but I decided this one fit in a little better. For me he's not really supposed to be a replacement for an MP Blurr, and he fits the role of filling out my 86 movie cast CHUG lineup just fine.   Edit: also where did you get those white autobot symbols you put on Whirl? I think they'd look good on OC"
transformers,3b2r20,canuslide,2,Thu Jun 25 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, he looks great...is he chug sized or MP sized?"
transformers,3b2r20,canuslide,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"Good question! He is the same height as MP Sideswipe from what I've seen, and he is about a head shorter than TFG Springer, whom he looks really good beside. He is definitely Voyager sized, so significantly taller than Deluxes, but shorter than Whirl and Classics Jerfire, and way shorter than Brainstorm."
transformers,3b2r20,dr_spider,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Well, he looks great, scale would be the reason I buy this one or more and I think if he's just shorter than Springer then he's a hands down buy for me."
transformers,3b2r20,ballistic90,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:57:33 2015 UTC,Basically CHUG. He's like a short Voyager or a tall Deluxe. I like it because he adds some range to my collection that isn't a side effect of Hasbro's cost-cutting ;)
transformers,3b2r20,dr_spider,2,Fri Jun 26 05:34:45 2015 UTC,I've been happy with the animated and generations version of him. This one's doesn't seem as... aerodynamic as the character should be.
transformers,3b2r20,dr_spider,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'd chalk part of that up to my pose and the angle. He's got these sweet quad thrusters in the back that I had down for some reason. There are some ""running"" shots of him that make him look a lot faster, and his alt mode looks straight out of wipeout. I like all Blurrs except for maybe Energon(?) that one makes Overclocking look like a sleek fish.   I'd love to have animated and Generations Blurr but they are hard to find at a good price."
transformers,3b2r20,Gib_Rock,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"Seeing his vehicle mode in person might change your opinion. It's sleek-yet-jacked-up, like a reinforced rocket car."
transformers,3b2r20,LuvBigHardBlackLotus,2,Fri Jun 26 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this figure. He is a head shorter than Voyager Springer, but slightly larger than the average Deluxe. He has a challenging transformation but he's no ROTF Prime or Apollyon.   Great articulation, tons of personality, hidden weapons caches, and an insanely-dynamic vehicle mode. Do yourself a favor and don't fret over every new 3P toy needing to fit into MP scale. If you're a CHUG collector, this guy is a million times better than the official Blurr."
transformers,3b2r20,Gib_Rock,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:32:23 2015 UTC,"Just got him yesterday and I've been too busy to take a nice picture, so here. Have a crappy phone picture with a terrible pose and bad angle.  My first 3P figure and he's pretty great. There's some minor parts where excess mold flash needs to be scraped off, but the quality is way up there.  There is one problem with mine. He's missing a screw for his upper arm right above the elbow. He still holds together fine and it doesn't make him loose because the elbow is also screwed in, but I need a replacement for it. Any ideas where I could get a match?"
transformers,3b2r20,Gib_Rock,2,Thu Jun 25 14:32:40 2015 UTC,Enjoy it :) he looks fantastic.  Considered getting him but too bulky for my idea of Blurr.   Why not email them asking what type of screw they used? They might even send a replacement.

transformers,3b1l5f,DarthCunnilingus9,7,Thu Jun 25 05:56:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, people hated Generations Warpath?! Dude was awesome.  As for mine...probably Prime Bumblebee? Everyone had such a downer on him because his First Edition toy was much more amazing (which was the point of the FE releases...) but I really like him. I'm a simple transformations kinda girl though, so that might be why."
transformers,3b1l5f,doxydejour,3,Thu Jun 25 10:02:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was also my reaction. I could have sworn the general consensus on him was positive.  Even though I don't own the actual Bumblebee, I did get the Hot Shot repaint. My only issue with it is that the automorph feature was a bit too complex in that it created stability issues in robot mode, along with the known problem that the head will not go down all the way. If it wasn't for that I would like the figure as a whole lot more."
transformers,3b1l5f,TheDesuComplex_413,2,Thu Jun 25 10:33:17 2015 UTC,I just tended to not like the overall look of the Prime figures. Im trying to think if I even got any figures from prime...  Starscream and Soundwave?  But that's because I have to own every starscream. He's my spirit animal

transformers,3b1l5f,TJBacon,5,Thu Jun 25 10:04:57 2015 UTC,"The Action Masters.  Yeah, they were crappy excuses for Transformers, but as far as action figures go, they were quite decent. They were also the figures currently available when my allowance was raised but I hadn't yet felt the social pressure to ""grow out"" of TFs, so I ended up owning a good number of them. Their ability to share weapons and vehicles also lent itself to a lot of play value. And I had fond memories of the G1 cartoons and comic but had never gotten my hands on much of the toys of the characters, so the Action Masters were the first chance I got to own my favourite iconic Autobots and Decepticons.  Transformers that don't transform will forever remain the red-headed stepchild of G1, but they came at just the right time for me to treasure the experience of owning and playing with them more than any other figures."

transformers,3b09lc,Buzzsaw_Eject,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:51:13 2015 UTC,I'm really not sure.  They are labeled legend class on the shelf  for what that's worth.   And they are smaller than the CW Legends. I thought they'd look good in a combiner display.  I had Bruticus in mind when I picked up Starscream.   There was also a g2 style Megatron with them but Im just not fond of that style
transformers,3b09lc,jrgolden42,2,Thu Jun 25 00:02:37 2015 UTC,The reason that they are smaller than CW legends is because they are the old legends size. After Fall of Cybertron they made the legends scale roughly the size of the old Scout class.
transformers,3b09lc,blazemongr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:43:41 2015 UTC,Good to Know.  I've missed a lot in the last decade or so
transformers,3b09lc,jrgolden42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:50:32 2015 UTC,"Possibly because, the first year of Legends figures after that were packaged with tiny Targetmasters, which needed a slightly larger figure to hold them.  Also, the current Legends size figures are actually remarkably posable, where these older ones were rigid and less desirable to adult collectors.  Still, I really liked the old price point."

G1 has a lot of 'colorful' aspects, but it doesn't skimp on the characterization. In the Japanese version, especially in the successor series that originate on the Japanese end (Headmasters, etc), all this characterization kind of... disappears. Characters end up sounding flat, stripped of a lot of their verbal tics that make them memorable in the English version. I don't like the Japanese performances for the most part because I don't think of Transformers as having a species-wide 'flat affect'; I was drawn to the show because the variety of voices, tones, character behaviors, audio processing quirks, etc.   Just my .02"

I also got a Bruticus torso, Barricade I think? and the blue A10 Warthog for SM.  IIRC there was a bit of a snafu with the limb bots because they used two and two per team, but only had one set of molds per limb. This meant that all of two limbs had to have their entire production run, then the line retooled and the other two limbs have their total run.  There was only budget for 10 molds max, which meant 2 full teams or 3 teams of 3 with two repaints plus a wildcard.  Likely the same mold budget restrictions for CW, but they've learned from their Energon experience not to put repaints on the same team, and apparently a way to retool without massively impacting budget. I wonder if the retooled parts are also on the sprews and just whatever isn't needed for that character is thrown back in to be recycled."

I imagine that the majority of the molds, which feature massive overhauls of the design of parts, are just engineered as a new figure from the CAD files of another one.

transformers,3ay52e,Veeshan28,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"I have bought a few of the lambo KOs, but am slowly replacing them with official pieces and selling the KOs on ebay. They are decent quality. All of mine have/had some quirks. Slightly loose, or bits not quite fitting where they should, and having to get an exacto knife and shave it down. But they looked good, which was most important.   I would recommend getting the official pieces, as they are definitely tighter and better put together. But the KOs aren't bad, and can help fill in a collection."

I think I've got the chest clipping together  alright now, but have you ever had an issue with his head staying shut? I can't seem to get mine to stay closed in Robot mode, but can't tell what's causing the problem."

Little bit of clear nail Polish, and problem solved..   Seeing as you can get most of them for around $30 USD with free shipping on eBay, I highly recommend."
transformers,3ay52e,q8p,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"I have a KO Sideswipe, Wheeljack and Bluestreak, only issue I had was with sideswipe, his tab in the centre to connect his waist and hood was too small so i had to cut it open. other than that they're great, and the Wheeljack is incredible quality!"
transformers,3ay52e,ra1nb0w_da5h,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:05:45 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for letting me know!
transformers,3ay52e,ra1nb0w_da5h,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"It's a little hit or miss, but they're overall a great alternative. My KO Sideswipe actually holds together and looks a little nicer than my official one. KO Tigertracks is basically the same. And my KO Red Alert has just a few thin places of paint. Well, worth the price drop from the official ones which are not at all worth the going price. I also have KO Prowl, but don't have an official one; I have exactly zero problems with him, too."

Honestly it's very nice. I put mine side by side to my friend's legit sideswipe and couldn't tell the difference when handling it. I have the KO wheeljack on order so I'm waiting on that one. Also I have the KO Soundwave tapes and those are nice as well, save for some paint mistakes. Nothing really noticeable tho."

Sadly I paid just about full price thinking it was an official and I honestly didn't even notice it was a KO a few days later when I really took a close look at it, the quality was that good. The only thing that gave it away was a printing error on the front bumper. Other than that one of the hip joints is lose and the gun's handle doesn't tab in place when folded but other than that its fine."

transformers,3ay52e,dukefett,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:12 2015 UTC,How good is shopping at aliexpress?
transformers,3ay52e,pokemanz43,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"I have ordered 2 knock offs from there so far. Ordering out of europe. Bought from 2 different sellers(Just to see if I got lucky of if theyre all decent) Make sure to buy from a seller with good rep(Its kinda like ebay in that regard).  The shipping , to europe at least, is free but non trackable. takes about 2-3 weeks to get here ,so pretty fast considering its coming from china. Have not had issues with import tax(as we often do here in europe) they either marked the package as low value or a gift.  There are some very minor mold defects on some, but not all. Both my casettes and the MP12G have a little trouble with 5mm port accesories, but this is easily fixed(yet seems a recurring theme with KOs). Also much less of an issue with the mp12 since it has the clasping hands, its sword and weapon fit very well. The mp12G I had to file a single port(the one on the lower side of the front bumper which locks in the best in robot mode) but this was obviously an erroneous drop, and im sure this isnt the case with every copy. In any case after filing it off you cant tell it was there to begin with.   Sadly they only seem to have the soundwave casettes, autobot cars(quite a few variations though) and the mp10. The mp10 is 100$+ish and more then I would like to spend on a KO, but the other autobots are in the 35$ish range and WELL worth the money, make sure you get a free shipping one though.  All in all I've had a much better experience there then i've had at ebay or our local craigslist clone"

My primary issue, is looseness. He tabs together in car mode fine, but his joints and even should cannons are just floppy now. Fine if you want to just pose him, but not if you play with your Transformers like me. Oh and his pistol grip is molded weird so he can't hold it in his hand like he's supposed to."

transformers,3ay52e,tombstone23,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:16:51 2015 UTC,"EDIT #2: It seems the ebay KO's and TF Direct are all epacket delivery from China. Anyone know if there are faster shipping methods?   The reason is they're so cheap and with free shipping is b/c that's how they keep the prices down.  Usually a package gets to me in like 10 days after the auction; I'm in NJ if that makes any difference.  ebay will be the cheapest to buy them, some are down to $20 shipped."

transformers,3ayyaj,canuslide,2,Wed Jun 24 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I've just started to think about collecting again, but I'm not really sure which way I want to go (get the old toys or the new toys).    My first original thought was to go with the old toys and just buy some in decent condition.  Then I thought I could probably start with a newer set. LOL  I don't know which way to go, just wishing my stuff hadn't been stolen during shipping overseas when I was younger! haha"
transformers,3ayyaj,canuslide,3,Wed Jun 24 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"NP.  You are coming into it at a good time; most of the older 1904-86 toys are being redone or have already been redone (some a few times) and reimagined using updated designs and technology.  The Classics, Henkei, Universe, Generations (CHUG) lines gets you really close to what G1 likenesses would be in today's day and age.  You can't go wrong with anything, find something you like and start there, do a little research and branch out where you like but be careful, set limits; things can get out of hand quick if you don't have guidelines."
transformers,3ayyaj,canuslide,2,Wed Jun 24 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"LOL, my biggest problem is do I want to play with them.  I saw a few on transformerland.com that were Original G1s SEALED?!?!?!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!!?  The price was very realistic for an untouched toy still in the sealed package.  But the prices were insane for my budget lol.    I just wonder if the newer style toys will have the same kind of value in 20 years.  That said, there are definitely some that I want to buy ""used"" versions of for sure because I want to play the crap out of them with my son (6 years old).  The website seemed like a good source for older bots for sure.  Just stinks that I'd have to shell out a min of $100 for a complete Devastator (none of the singles have the armor parts for him with them).    My thought was just to find some that we could learn/relearn together on before buying some of the higher priced ones. It's crazy how many different ""Bumblebees"" there were in G1.  Didn't know Cliffjumper was originally yellow??  So I thought about going that route and checking out the local ""old school"" toy shops in the state.  I get the feeling that brick and mortar stores are going to be higher than some of the online stores.  Are there any other good online stores like tfland?  Maybe one that I can go to to search for the missing Devastator pieces when it comes time? :)"
transformers,3ayyaj,canuslide,2,Wed Jun 24 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, gotcha.  Well, if it's specifically play you are after but want brand spanking new G1 toys, you might want to look into knock-offs.  They will not be valuable or expensive but they will be just right to play with and display open.  Now, all those recent (2008-present) Transformers in the chug lines, some might be worth up to double their retail price but most will be much cheaper.  See, people speculated that they might be worth money (something that very, very few people did in the 80's) so there will be much more supply available plus the production for Hasbro/Takara toys right now is much higher than it was in the 80's because of the movies, collectors buying multiple copies and their world-wide reach and the internet.  Right now, is good to love the transformers as long as you don't do it because you want to invest in something; you WILL lose.    Invest in gold; land ownership or agriculture, not plastic toys that everyone thinks they can get a return on eventually; it will never happen.  Even the high end stuff in lower quantities; Has/Tak sees the demand real time on ebay and elsewhere, they keep releasing more runs of figures when demand is high.  The most popular MP-10 mold has had releases every 3 years (with more slight variations in between) you can't win on a toy investment because when you are old and grey, and you're getting ready to sell those G1 inspired bots, there won't be anyone left out there who grew up on them-just those RID, Car Robots and Beast Wars-oh and probably Bayverse fans-G1 stuff won't be forgotten but there will surely be a lot of stuff on the market that people who are dying off (or their kids) want to get rid of.    I collect CHUGS because they are cool.  I open them all, pose them as I see fit, lightly play with them with my kid and nephews and keep them on display.  My collection is pretty big but I would be lucky to conservatively get 50% back out of them.    Take a look in the sidebar for this subreddit; there are lots of places to buy from, resources to find information and things to help you start your collection.    Hope this helps!"
