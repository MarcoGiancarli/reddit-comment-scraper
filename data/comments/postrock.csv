The part where he lists all of his guns is in a sense hilarious, if it weren't for the music.  But when one looks at Godspeed as a group, reads their booklets/inserts, looks at lyrics of ASMZ, interviews etc. you realise they have a lot in common with BBF. BBF is conservative, GYBE is lefty anarchist, but their conclusions are the same - the world and political system is fucked up beyond repair (yeah, there are elements of hope in their work but nearly not enough). I once read a theory that they put the guys rant in as a joke because the kind of straightforward and heavyhanded critique is something people expected of them after the dramatic recordings in their debut. While this may be a very self-conscious inside joke for them and their fans, I don't believe they put it there just for fun, that would be detrimental to their art. Godspeed is a deeply political and serious band (when they function as a band, individually its a bit different story) and they have no problems declaring that, so I doubt they would put stuff like this in a song just as a joke or a parody. Its just not their thing. Thus I believe they put it here because they found something interesting in what the guy was saying, the joke part maybe came second in their thought process."

His crazy off-key nonsense kind of evokes an image of a guy losing his mind, and even the lyrics sort of work with it.  But yeah, he can't sing. His Québécois accent doesn't help either.  There's other good vocal post rock, though, where singing is a thing that the vocalist does. Long Distance Calling managed it pretty well that one time, as did Blueneck. I think Sigur Ros does pretty well too."
postrock,3dhy0o,FireworksNtsunderes,4,Thu Jul 16 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"Sigur Ros wouldn't be the same without Jonsi's vocals. There is a major difference between his singing and the singing in this video, with Jonsi having a voice that simply acts as another instrument to the music. It fits perfectly, and is one of the reasons why I think Sigur Ros is one of the best Post-Rock bands out there.  The Japanese Post-Rock band MONO recently made their first song with vocals (albeit it was screaming) and I feel that worked decently well. At least it sounded interesting. I'd actually like to hear more Post-Rock bands toy with vocals in their music; I know guitars are generally front and center for Post-Rock, but with all the different kinds of instrumentation we see in the genre, I think vocals can find their home here as well."

I feel like Pretend is fairly well known in post-rock and math rock circles but the first band probably not so much.  Souls Vibrating Through The Universe - All These Worlds Are Yours  I would consider Pretend fairly post-rock (and fairly mathy) as well  Pretend - Bones In The Soil, Rust In The Oil"

postrock,3dhy0o,Clunkbot,2,Fri Jul 17 00:53:38 2015 UTC,"Heysátan?   In an interview, Kjartan said that after writing the song, they discussed what they though it meant, and all came to the same conclusion. Coming from the band it's basically the story of an old man looking contentedly out over his fields and land, knowing he's going to die soon. He knows he will die, but accepts it's inevitability and has no fear or regret.   As the last line says, he lolls his head, content. Such a fitting ending to an album, the calm death of an old man who is happy with the long life he has lived."

I've seen a handful of post-rock bands live: Mono, Caspian, Junius, Russian Circles. Expect lots of white dudes swaying while deep into the music, occasionally headbanging when there's some riffs. Not too much stage banter. But the music makes a lot of the atmosphere.   GY!BE are pretty intense and have cool visuals from what I've seen. Personally, I'd go and get up to dance to Mladic if I had the chance.  tldr Immerse yourself, enjoy yourself, wear earplugs."

postrock,3ctwpb,afterosmosis,8,Mon Jul 13 13:17:47 2015 UTC,I really don't think there's many bands that are underrated in this genre because it's largely a niche genre to begin with. No one is listening to an album and not liking it that much because you're likely not casually coming across it in the first place.  Now overrated on the other hand... there's plenty of misplaced hype in this genre.
postrock,3ctwpb,WhiskyTech,-3,Sat Jul 11 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"Clueless. How underrated or overrated a band is is a function of the distance between the fans' expertise, knowledge and awareness, and the band's actual quality.   Though in a niche genre fans wouldn't lack for awareness, easily satisfying one criteria, a niche genre by definition is harder for bands to differentiate from other bands; therefore, the threshold for one criteria lowers, and in compensation, for the other two raises (it would take a lot more expertise and knowledge). Considering it is the internet age where awareness isn't a big problem, because it's a niche genre, it would create a lot more volatile appraisals of bands, not the reverse as you have suggested.    Tip: you can't overrate a band without underrating at least one band."

postrock,3ctwpb,DanaosC,3,Sat Jul 11 03:39:26 2015 UTC,"Underrated are bands that are critiquely given lower scores than what people think they deserve. They can be overlooked for a variety of reasons. A band can be popular and underrated if no one appreciates them. A common example of that is Brand New's latter career. Everyone knows who Brand New is but for a while it took them to win over people as a serious band. So as you can see popularity is a different concept. Since post-rock isn't a well known genre outside of a few bands it's more so stuff just isn't noticed as much more so than it's underrated. When people find stuff, since they're looking at a specific genre, they tend to get rated properly. There's other examples of this in the thread like The Evpatoria Report. Search for them. People gush over them in every single thread.  You could argue that outside of the big names that every single post-rock band is underrated just by nature of it being a genre that isn't that popular. I don't find that to be very useful."

How do we know what kind of fandom each band has and if they like it, and in the end they could not like it but we would. I am sure OP meant us to post some less-known bands and that's what everyone's doing. No need to be so picky and enjoy the thread. Have a good day mate~"

postrock,3cqiaf,WhiskyTech,0,Thu Jul 9 23:35:09 2015 UTC,Amazing group that it seems not many have heard of.   They're fairly well known in the drone scene. They're not known in the post-rock scene because they're not a post-rock band.   They mainly have a drone and psychedelic/free folk thing going on. Post-rock with a drone element here.   The first sentence is correct. I have no idea how you think that leads into the second sentence.
postrock,3cqiaf,WhiskyTech,2,Fri Jul 10 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry if that was poorly worded. My point being that NSB aren't a post-rock group, but that this one is a post-rock track."

I'm working on getting the full interview uploaded, but bottom-line is:  MONO will release a split album with The Ocean after they are done touring with them in Europe later this year.  Regarding their future release, they will likely make it as much if not more metal than Rays of Darkness, but also keep it ""fucking emotional"" of course haha.  I wouldn't be concerned with them losing their romantic, cinematic side. Trust in MONO!"

But I did get to see Mono a couple years back when they played at Lee's Place (with Maserati as the opener) and that show was fantastic. 65daysofstatic and Caspian (also at Lee's Palace) was also amazing.

postrock,3c8pmc,fradleybox,2,Tue Jul 7 05:04:51 2015 UTC,I suppose Fuck Buttons comes to mind first (for drum machines but no guitars)  maybe Jim O'Rourke & Loren Connors (for guitars but no drums)  Wires Under Tension is a drummer and a violinist/drummer  Wye Oak is a guitarist and a drummer but isn't post-rock  etc
postrock,3c8pmc,Phreakhead,2,Sun Jul 5 23:24:49 2015 UTC,Arab Strap was only two guys but one of them played both instruments (and used samples). probably the closest I'm going to get.
