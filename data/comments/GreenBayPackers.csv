GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,wrath4771,4,Tue Jul 21 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"You're not being snarky, that's exactly the reason why the NFL wants to play this game in Jacksonville."
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,prezuiwf,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:39 2015 UTC,I read a quote from Mark Murphy yesterday or the day before that said he talked to the Jaguars owner who said pretty much the same thing.  The Packers fans travel to away games to consistently that he would prefer to have a different game move to London.
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,talkincat,12,Tue Jul 21 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"This is slightly disappointing. I'm a Green Bay fan from the UK and for the past few years, I've hoped that this year would be the year that the Packers finally come to the UK. Don't get me wrong, I would never want to sacrifice a home game; but an away game with one of the ""smaller"" teams would be great just so that I could watch them live as I wouldn't be able to otherwise for many years to come. But I do understand that we are a big team and there's no reason for these teams to come to the UK when the Packers will sell out/be close to selling out regardless."
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,Negredo,6,Tue Jul 21 19:23:22 2015 UTC,I feel for you on that one. You should have chosen a crappier team if you wanted to see them play in the UK. :P

GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,packfanmoore,18,Tue Jul 21 22:07:37 2015 UTC,Love packer nation... Our home games are too important to lose money to away fans
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,evandena,25,Tue Jul 21 17:14:25 2015 UTC,For sure. We've already said we won't give up a home game for London. This article is saying that the visiting teams also don't want to give up the revenue we generate when we visit.
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,DrSandbags,11,Tue Jul 21 17:27:10 2015 UTC,That's not at stake. Opposing team owners want to play the Packers in their stadium as opposed to London because Packer fans travel well.
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,DogFartsSmellGood,4,Tue Jul 21 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"As a Panhandle resident, I'd be thrilled if they played in JAX like I had previously anticipated, but I'm starting to feel bad for my Packer brethren across the pond."
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,Talking_Monkey93,4,Tue Jul 21 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"Im right on the fence on this one. I think its awesome that our fans travel so well that even a non-contender like Jacksonville is worried about the revenue drop if we don't visit them at their rightful home. I also am open to a road game in London. Green Bay has such a following and that can only grow and help this league. If a team like the Cowboys can cross the pond for one of their away games, then I see no strikingly valid reason why we cannot. I will add as well, even if it meant having a SuperBowl in Green Bay, I would never vote for giving up a home game for one in London."
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,coast2coaster,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Did they ever think that maybe our fans would travel to London to see the Packers? or that there already is a good amount of Packers fans already living in UK and elsewhere in Europe that desperately want to see the team play and this would be their chance? I truely hope we get to see the Packers play in London as an away game, but thats just me."
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,Heisenberg2308,7,Tue Jul 21 19:24:24 2015 UTC,I think the point is that the teams hosting Packers games stand to make more money from selling more seats in their stadiums. They might be willing to send a game to London that wouldn't sell out because the NFL would give them some money to do so. But sending a sellout game to London would cost them money on things like concessions.
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,zttvista,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I'm sure the income generated from a game in London is almost exactly the same every game, no matter which teams are playing. To Londoners, it's the only chance they'll get in a year to see an NFL game, and pretty much all the fans in the country of either team will probably show up.  In this case, the Jags don't care who they play in London as much as they care about how many tickets they can sell at home."

GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,intersectv3,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"If the NFL is actually serious about marketing the league overseas then they need those games to have better matchups, involving more marketable teams. This shouldn't just be about selling tickets."
GreenBayPackers,3e2zjg,AbeRego,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but it seems like the league doesn't have absolute power over the teams, and the successful ones aren't interested in losing a home game. It'd have to be a competent team that has trouble selling out, or is in a stadium transition.   Honestly, I think it'd be cool to have a Packers-Vikings game in London. Division rivalry, Vikings' stadium isn't done yet.. it'd be a better show than what London has been getting so far."

GreenBayPackers,3e2b5z,skatterbug,3,Tue Jul 21 12:20:52 2015 UTC,"Jim Ringo  The Packers drafted Ringo out of Syracuse in the seventh round in 1953, and he became one of the league's best centers despite being undersized at just over 200 pounds.  Between being lonesome and all ""the bigger players competing for the center job,‚Äù Ringo quit camp believing he didn't have a chance to make the team. In addition, Jim didn't like the militaristic camp rules. Ringo wasn't welcome at home and, as he put it, ""They didn't want a quitter. They said you should at least try."" Despite his 211 pounds as a pro freshman, Ringo found his way back to Grand Rapids and the team ... and, of course, the rest is history.  He made All-League seven times and played in 10 Pro Bowls. Never weighing more than 235 pounds, he utilized his speed and football intelligence to dominate his opponents. When coach Vince Lombardi took over the Packers in 1959, Jim was the only already-established All-Pro on the roster. Lombardi built his offense around Ringo.  Lombardi was thankful for Jim's speed; ""A bigger man might not be able to make the cut-off blocks on our sweeps the way Jim does. The reason Ringo‚Äôs the best in the league is because he's quick and he's smart. He runs the offensive line, calls the blocks and he knows what every lineman does on every play."" Lombardi had developed a play while the offensive coordinator for the New York Giants called the ""power sweep."" Essentially, the guards (and the fullback) would create a blocking convoy for the halfback to run behind (or if the fullback got the ball, then the halfback would take the fullback‚Äôs blocking role). They would seal off the defenders so that the halfback could run without having to worry about the defensive tackles - they would theoretically create lanes for the halfback to run through.   According to Packers legend:   Ringo, went into negotiations with Lombardi when he was the Packers' head coach. He brought his agent to the meeting. Lombardi said, ""I don't negotiate with agents. Hold on, let me make a phone call."" He turned away, picked up the phone, and the moment he hung up he said, ""I told you I don't negotiate with agents. You've just been traded to Philadelphia."" Ringo was one of his best players and all-pro for several years, but Lombardi chose to trade him rather than deal with his agent. It was sort of an unwritten rule at that time not to bring others into negotiations because nobody had agents or other people speaking for them.   In reality, by 1963 Ringo was now 32 years old and clearly losing a little of his great quickness. In addition, with his career winding down, Ringo was interested in playing closer to his home near Philadelphia. He was not necessarily looking for a trade, but he did want a raise on his salary, and if the Packers were not interested in giving him more money, he would not mind being dealt to a team closer to home. In the negotiations, Ringo dealt only with Pat Peppler, the Packers director of player personnel, not Lombardi himself. Lombardi, for his part, contemplated the situation for weeks before determining that the best cause of action would be to give Ringo what he wanted and also to get the Packers younger. Ringo was eventually traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, along with Fullback Earl Gros, for a first round draft pick (became Donny Anderson), and linebacker Lee Roy Caffey.  It's estimated that Ringo handled the ball (only the quarterback can match him) more than 12,000 times in his career, including around 1,000 snapbacks for punts or placekicks.   After retiring Ringo went on to be the Offensive Line coach for the Bears, Bills, Patriots, Rams, and Jets. He was also Offensive Coordinator for the Patriots and Bills, as well as Head Coach of the Bills in the 1976 and 1977 seasons.  Ringo died in 2007, at the age of 75.  Source 1  Source 2  Source 3"

The Packers obviously don't want to play in London compare to Florida because fewer of their fans who do travel well will get to see a game  If they were only selling 90% of their tickets it might be a different story, but their attendence is pretty good for a terrible team."

GreenBayPackers,3e073y,basshound3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:50 2015 UTC,"You aren't wrong, but again the thing is the Packers-Jags game is a guaranteed sellout at whichever field the game is played at.  A game like the Raiders is not a guaranteed sellout in Jacksonville, but would be in London.  Both games will be marked up.  If the Jags keep the Packers game at home but move the Raiders to London, that's revenue from two sold out games.  Getting 100% from the London game is obviously big though.  We'd have to see the exact math to determine which way makes more financial sense."

GreenBayPackers,3dxrnt,skatterbug,2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"Fred Carr  Although Vince Lombardi was still the general manager, 1968 began the short Phil Bengston era in Green Bay as Lombardi‚Äôs long-time loyal assistant became head coach of the team. Fred Carr was his first draft choice and Phil felt, ‚ÄúCarr had the potential to play defensive end, linebacker, tight end, or safety. Getting him was like drawing the wild card in poker.‚Äù  And he was right: Carr had an amazing amount of talent and was a very good player for 10 years in Green Bay. The sad thing was he could have been even better and played even longer if the team had not deteriorated around him.  At the University of Texas-El Paso, he was an All-American linebacker and a member of the UTEP basketball team. He came to the Packers just as they were coming off their third consecutive world championship year; some players just have miserable timing. Ten years earlier, linebacker Wayne Walker joined the World Champion Lions in 1958 and he would make All Pro and Pro Bowl teams during his career, but would never play in a Super Bowl. Likewise, future All Pro Carr was coming in just as the 1960s dynasty was ending. If the team had had a few more replacements like Fred, perhaps things would have been different for Phil Bengston and the Packers in the 1970s.  The 1970 season truly spelled the end of the dynasty. The year was bookended by shut-out losses to the Lions ‚Äì 40-0 at home and 20-0 on the road. Willie Davis and Henry Jordan retired and were replaced by Clarence Williams and number-one pick Mike McCoy.  Lee Roy Caffey and Herb Adderley were traded and effectively replaced by Carr and rookie Ken Ellis. Dave Robinson suffered an injury and was replaced by rookie Jim Carter. The defense dropped to 19th of 26 teams in points allowed. Offensively, things continued to deteriorate as the team fell to 24th in points scored. Marv Fleming left for Miami and was replaced by has-been John Hilton and never-was Rich McGeorge. Likewise, Boyd Dowler retired to be replaced by has-been Jack Clancy and never-was John Spilis. The effects of age severely hampered the play of Bart Starr, Forrest Gregg, Ray Nitschke, Willie Wood, and Bob Jeter. It was all too much change at once; time had caught up to the Packers.  The 6-5, 235-pound Carr didn't break into the starting line-up immediately because linebacker was one position that was well-stocked. The Packers experimented with him at defensive end and tight end, but found him best suited to play linebacker with skills similar to All Pro Dave Robinson. Fred was big, strong, and fast, and had a penchant for making big plays. He was All Pro in 1975 and made second team All Pro in four other seasons. He played in three Pro Bowls and was Most Valuable Line-man for the game played in 1971.  Carr‚Äôs career ended as suddenly and as badly as the team‚Äôs glory years. Carr hurt his knee and told trainer Dom Gentile that he thought he was finished. Gentile claimed that it was only a cyst that needed draining and perhaps minor surgery. Much acrimony between Carr and the team followed. Eventually he was cut and then hired an attorney to file a grievance, saying that he was injured and was owed money. Ultimately there was a settlement for an undisclosed amount that Gentile later reported as being $10,000, and Fred never played again in the NFL.  He was inducted into the Packer Hall of Fame in 1983.  Source 1: John Maxymuk, ‚ÄúPackers by the Numbers: Jersey Numbers and the Players Who Wore them"""

I understand they're both very unlikely to join the team, however these reports partially stem from the red zone struggles last year. Get some shifty guys who can score from short range and you partially make up for the lack of TE threats."

Watching his ceremony was such an incredibly joyous moment, and I was on the verge of tears for most of it. Stafford's play style and attitude towards the game (him going back in after dislocating his shoulder to throw the game winning touchdown was absolutely incredibly) reminds me a lot of Favre.    Getting to grow up only knowing Brett Favre as our quarterback for the first ~13 years as a Packer fan is truly an amazing feeling. Seeing him take the field week after week, having the most fun in the world is everything I could have asked for as a Packers fan."

Also before that there was a rain delay and he took it as a privilege to take over the sport medicines van and lock them out while he sat in it with his friends
GreenBayPackers,3dsi94,dschaefer,9,Sun Jul 19 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah going to have to agree. Visited Japan with some classmates in the summer of 98 (I think). We were between 13 and 16 years old from sheboygan. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe in Tokyo and a bunch of the packers were there, he was a dick, extremely annoyed that 10 kids from his teams' home state accidentally stumbled upon him half way around the world. He did take a picture with us but he didn't smile or interact with anyone and was pretty cold in general. Meanwhile the KCC o-line happily chatted me up for like 15 minutes and thought it was pretty neat that we stumbled on them. Any way I always felt like he was sort of an ungrateful dick. Sports fame is like any fame you don't make money without your fans. I didn't expect him to take personal interest in our lives or sign a million autographs but don't act like we just ruined your whole time in Japan cause we asked for 30 seconds and snapped one pic on one camera."

GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,Agreenbay33,9,Sun Jul 19 15:24:21 2015 UTC,My first memories of Brett Favre all involve my maternal grandmother.  I remember her getting very angry at the news we traded away a first round pick for some qb she'd never heard of burried on a depth chart in Atlanta.  And then the first couple of years of watching him play so recklessly (which she hated) causing her to throw her foam brick at the TV every time there was a Turnover.
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,silentjay01,5,Sun Jul 19 16:00:33 2015 UTC,causing her to throw her foam brick at the TV every time there was a Turnover   I believe that's called a cheesehead.

GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,kintops,6,Mon Jul 20 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"My dad was always extremely..uh..vocal..while watching packer games.  I grew up in the 80's...not good years for the Pack.  He is a Marine, so it was pretty colorful at times too.  But when ever the game was on we stopped what we were doing and headed to the bar to watch.  My favorite memory is when Majik Man, got hurt and Brett came in...my dad's words I'll never forget.  ""Well I'll be fucked, now we have this no nothing wild ass mother fucker from somewhere down in the arm pit of the world.  Don was our only chance in hell of making it.""  Then when Brett threw that first pass...to himself...my dad lost it.  ""Well son, now we are back to the bottom of the shit pile...you know what's at the bottom of the shit pile son?  Shit.""  He has kinda warmed up to him a little bit now tho.  Also...if we are at my dad's house having a few beers, for the love of all that is holy if the words McMahon, Ditka, or any reference to the Bears come out your mouth you are on your own.  Tl;Dr My Dad hates the Bears, loves Don  Majkowski.  Kinda ok with ol Brett now."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,mrme17k,3,Sun Jul 19 22:00:04 2015 UTC,No one should ever talk about the bears or any bear in any household unless it's how great Ditka looked in a packers Jersey.
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,kaleblast,6,Mon Jul 20 00:59:05 2015 UTC,"Just before SB XXXII.  I was maybe 9 or 10 at the time. Our family went to San Diego to stay in the same hotel they were at to catch all the pre-SB activities and whatnot. I had brought my NFL QB Club '98 game cartridge with me, geared up in my #4 jersey, in hopes that I'd get an autograph from the guy. My mom told me I should just leave it in the car, because I probably wouldn't get to meet him.   Ten minutes into checking in, we hear through the grapevine (a bellhop) that Favre was doing an interview in the hotel's restaurant downstairs. We quickly put our bags away and went down to find a huge empty room, with Eugene Robinson sitting at the bar chatting with the bartender. We went and sat down to talk with him, he was incredibly friendly and asked all about us, where we're from and all that.   Few minutes later, lo and behold, #4 is walking around the corner, casually dressed, with an interviewer, no one else around in sight. My mom started shaking and fumbled a sharpie to me over to me while she grabbed our camera, nudging me over to him.   He sees me coming over and stops talking for a minute, while I timidly ask, ""Can I have your autograph, Mr. Favre,"" holding up the sharpie. He replied, ""Sure, bend over kid."" Put his shoulder on me and autographed the back number of my jersey. I thanked him and we all scurried off, not wanting to interrupt his business, and completely in disbelief of what just happened.     On a side note, my other favorite memory from then was a meet & greet the next day. The players were walking down a tented aisle outside, doing autographs and shaking hands as they passed. Eugene Robinson spotted me from a few heads back and raised his hand up, ""Hey! kaleblast, my man! How's it going buddy?"" I felt like the coolest kid in the world."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,MIAMarc,3,Mon Jul 20 01:26:17 2015 UTC,You were the coolest kid in the world. What I woke give to have the chance to meet a Packer.
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,MushroomCloudMoFo,5,Mon Jul 20 02:38:51 2015 UTC,Mine is the game after his father died he absolutely tore up the Oakland Raiders with one long bomb into double coverage after another. I doubt I'll witness anything that awesome ever again!
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,osc630,5,Sun Jul 19 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"I was 9 years old when he took over. I remember crying my eyes out because the Majic Man was injured, which meant our season was over AGAIN. One 35 yd TD pass to Kitrick Taylor later and I was sold that this new guy was going to be the best ever."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,wrath4771,3,Sun Jul 19 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"I was 6 when that happened, but my reaction was a bit different - I had such a huge crush on the Majik Man that I was pissed (well, angry, I was only 6...) that this idiot took his place."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,Wolf482,4,Sun Jul 19 23:22:38 2015 UTC,"I remember the day he got traded and my best friend and I were really excited about it because even though he was buried in Atlanta, we knew he had a cannon for an arm."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,outontheborder,4,Sun Jul 19 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"My first Favre memory, sparked my interest in football. I remember I was eight years old at my grandmother's house in December 1996. I remembered watching a green and gold team slogging it out in a muddy field against a red and gold team. This number 4 player still managed to absolutely huck a football in such adverse conditions. Of course, this player was Brett Favre playing San Francisco in the 1996 NFC Division Game. His arm strength was magical to watch, and it made this small kid from Michigan into a bit of an outcast among friends and family."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,ImaginarySpider,4,Sun Jul 19 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"Not really a specific memory, but I remember watching Packer games with my parents when I was about five or six years old. Every time I'd see #4 on the TV, I'd point to him and say, ""That's Brett Favre!"" because his was the only name and number combination I knew at the time. I instantly fell in love with the way he played, and I considered him my favorite Packer for all of my childhood."
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,JasonYaya,4,Sun Jul 19 18:01:46 2015 UTC,My first memory was similar but a few years earlier. I remember seeing Favre tuck the ball away and take off running. He dove at the end zone and barely caught the pylon for a TD. I didn't even know he could do that. I was hooked from that point on.
GreenBayPackers,3duaq6,ZeusAlansDog,4,Sun Jul 19 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"My first memory was listening to Bob and Brian, morning radio guys in Milwaukee who had a hilarious soap opera spoof called ""All My Packers"" in the late 80's-early 90's. I want to make it clear that they were and are big Packer fans but could not ignore the long period of ineptness that was still going on at that time. Anyway, I remember driving around and hearing, ""This just in, the Packers have traded a first round draft pick for a third string quarterback, and despite all of the big talk it looks like nothing is going to change in Green Bay."""

Even at my age I understood that there was a chance he'd never even see it, much less send anything back; but the card came back a couple weeks later with his autograph on it.  I'll never forget the feeling I had opening that envelope and how excited I was to show everyone at school the next day.

I was just flipping through channels and I stopped on a Packers game, at this point I knew nothing about football since I grew up with soccer. Who they were playing I don't really remember to be honest, but it was my first time watching American Football. I was just mesmerized by it. From that second on I was a Packers fan.

GreenBayPackers,3dud5o,nickfinity,2,Sun Jul 19 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"It's probably dependent on a lot of different factors, the primary one being how much stuff they're getting asked to sign. I could see the possibility of there being a stack of stuff to sign that is so big that he would literally injure his hand actually signing each thing. When it's like that, he probably has his assistants send the polite refusal so he can sign the things that are more beneficial (things for charity and stuff)."
GreenBayPackers,3dud5o,analogWeapon,3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:19 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to send it to the team's address under ""Attn: Aaron Rodgers"", and make sure you include return postage that's self-addressed, payed and all ready to go.  Send a typed out letter that's short and to the point.  I believe these guys have people who go through the fan mail for them, so there's a chance he won't even see it, but I'm sure the team will still send you the jersey back (eventually).  I don't know if it would be better to wait until the season so you'll know he's around, or to do it now when there's less going on and less fan mail coming in..."
GreenBayPackers,3dud5o,right_behindyou,2,Sun Jul 19 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"I think it would be better to do it now rather than during the season. Once the season is rolling, their schedule is probably pretty full."

GreenBayPackers,3dwdv5,caramount,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:40:50 2015 UTC,Games are simply a reflection of the work put in the off-season/practice week. No one gets better by playing in a game. It can help with the mental aspect I suppose but it never actually improves the player.
GreenBayPackers,3dwdv5,chasingstatus,4,Mon Jul 20 04:21:04 2015 UTC,"If you aren't the starter, however, you get more limited reps in practice. That game time earned Barrington more practice time with the starters."

But that feels better to me than knowing that we are going to be worse off.  Barrington isn't an elite ILB, and he's not going to turn into Patrick Willis this year, we all know this. But I think he has an excellent chance at being decent and a puncher's chance of being good.  Clay is going to spend time at ILB, and I love that we have that flexibility with him now. I would hate to have to game plan against him as an offense, as if it weren't a big enough problem to have to find which side he's rushing from, now he could be anywhere on the field. I would take Clay part time at ILB over many, many other ILBs in the league that have been playing the position for years.  We don't know what we have in Jake Ryan yet, but he may have been a steal. I don't think he starts this year but he will get a lot of playing time. He could be a tackling machine.  As for the guys we don't have anymore, Brad Jones and AJ...I never felt great about having either on the field. AJ was sufficient, but I don't think he was someone that put fear into anybody on the other side, even at his peak. Brad Jones was Brad Jones, and I always knew what to expect from him.  So in short, I don't feel that we're worse off than we were this time last year."
GreenBayPackers,3dwdv5,lilfouse,2,Mon Jul 20 02:53:27 2015 UTC,"If AJ was sufficient he'd still be a Packer. He only stayed a starter as long as he did because the coaching staff clearly doesn't value the ILB position like other teams do so they we're okay with having an average on his best day player there. Last year he stopped being even that, hence Barrington and moving our best defensive player out of his natural position was considered a more viable option.  Edit: I know you weren't being supportive of Hawk with your comments, but a lot of people were for whatever reason. He always benefited from the fact that by design players in the middle get more numbers. Our secondary having high tackle numbers like they have had do a much better job illustrating his (lack of) worth."
GreenBayPackers,3dwdv5,atheist4thecause,3,Mon Jul 20 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"I feel‚Ä¶ok about our ILB. In my head, I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôll be Barrington and Matthews for the first few games, while getting Jake Ryan in there. Hopefully before September‚Äôs over, we can have Ryan in there the majority of the time, much like they did with HHCD at Safety last year."

GreenBayPackers,3ds8ow,Sartigy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"I was born in 1997. I also was put into a Favre jersey when I was young, and loved it. Although I didn't start watching until last year, I knew who Favre was and knew he was a great QB.  I was 9 months old when my parents took me to Walmart. They had my picture taken while I had a Packer's jersey on. I don't know where the photo is, but if I did I'd post it here."

Now they're freshmen, while I'm a senior. Where does the time go?  Back to the Pack, yeah, I wish I got into it earlier, so that I could have experienced the experiences one can only get by watching football. Hopefully Rodgers and the gang can give me plenty of stories I'll be telling my kids as my father has told me."

GreenBayPackers,3dqimu,skatterbug,4,Sat Jul 18 13:55:23 2015 UTC,"Larry McCarren  The Packers have had a long tradition of solid centers: Jug Earp, Nate Barrager, Geore Svendsen, Chrley Brock Jim Ringo, Ken Bowman, Larry McCarren and Frank Winters.  However, Larry McCarren started more games at center for the Packers than anyone else on that illustrious list, more than 150.  In his 12-yer career, he played in 162 consecutive games and that is second only to Hall of Fame tackle Forrest Gregg‚Äòs record for offensive linemen: 187.  McCarren was known as ‚ÄúRock,‚Äù as in ‚Äúrock steady,‚Äù and that sums him up perfectly. In 1980 he had a hernia operation during training camp, but was ready for opening day against the Bears less than four weeks later.  Coach Bart Starr intended that Larry only take the first snap to keep his streak alive, but when he sent out a substitute for the second play McCarren waved him off and played the whole game. In that same year, he broke his hand, but had trainer Dom Gentile rig up a special apparatus so he could keep playing. Then in 1983, Larry spent Sunday morning in the hospital after he and his family suffered carbon monoxide poisoning Saturday night, but again started that afternoon.  He was a 240-pound 12th-round draft pick out of Illinois given little chance to make the squad in 1973, but through hard work and perseverance he fashioned a solid career. He built himself up to 270 pounds in the weight room, and rumors circulated about possible steroid use on his part, but he refuses to comment on that even today.  There is no disagreement about the result, though. He won the starting job in his second year and set his goal on being one of the best centers in the league.  Twice he made All Pro teams, two other times he was a second-team selection, and twice he played in the Pro Bowl.  Quarterback Lynn Dickey called him, ‚ÄúThe toughest guy I ever played with. Anybody who‚Äôd ever questioned his heart was nuts.‚Äù  He was added to the Packer Hall of Fame in 1982.  After his playing career ended, McCarren became a sportscaster in 1988 and again struggled at first. He looked at broadcasting as just another challenge to be overcome by hard work and dedication. By 1995 he was named Wisconsin Sportscaster of the Year and began doing Packers radio broadcasts with veteran announcers Jim Irwin and Max McGee. When those two retired in 1998, McCarren was joined by new play-by-play man Wayne Larivee to take Packers broadcasts in a new direction.

But in the end, Brett was always looking out for himself first, and anyone, his kids, his wife, his team, his fans, were always a distant second.  Great player who deserves his accolades. But you don't heal the fact that Favre is who he is."

Although as a Packers fan in Minnesota, had he won them a Super Bowl in 2009 I'm not sure I could have ever let that go."
GreenBayPackers,3dtt63,kidwithhelmet,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, it's pretty well known how good Favre's 2009 was with the Vikes, but few appreciate how bad his 2010 was. Statistically, its arguably his worst season. His games against us were pretty awful, and we ended up needing the sweep. Obviously it wasn't intentional, but it's interesting."

You typically do not want to come to a raider game wearing another team's gear. Don't believe everything that you've heard about Raider fan but believe that. I wore my Favre jersey that night and Raider fans could not have been better hosts. I will never forget that game.
GreenBayPackers,3dqr4i,jjarco,4,Sat Jul 18 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"This game goes down as Favre's greatest, but it never ceases to amaze me just how much the receivers did for him that night.  Man, they caught everything..."

GreenBayPackers,3duupn,atheist4thecause,10,Sun Jul 19 18:21:56 2015 UTC,I like the Packers using literate players.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,richardleosimones,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Crockett or Neal fight for that spot and/or the 3rd spot. They are both 23 years old apposed to Chris being 29. We all know what happens to RB's around 29/30. We also don't have to spend any money, save that for locking up Daniels and Hayward."
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,Basaraski,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Well, we could cut James Starks, which would save us money, and then give that money to Chris Johnson. Starks and Johnson are the same age."
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,Basaraski,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:44:21 2015 UTC,"Well for one thing he can for sure catch better than Starks, that's a given... If CJ was cheap, I wouldn't mind it, we've never had a true speed back in recent time. Only one I could think of is Johnathan Franklin, and his career was ended. He was a great 1-2 with Lacy at the time (Bengals game)."
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,swiftwings88,4,Sun Jul 19 19:07:47 2015 UTC,No. Old washed up injured running backs aren't worth much more than the veterans minimum. He won't take that.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,et5291,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:08:34 2015 UTC,He won't take that.   How do you know? Would you want him for a veteran's minimum?
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,MountainTimePunch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:14:58 2015 UTC,No
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,flamingguts,4,Sun Jul 19 19:19:29 2015 UTC,CJ is a notoriously selfish player that we would be sticking behind a bellcow back... He'd be bitching to the media by mid season about his carries and jettisoned shortly thereafter. What speed he has left isn't anywhere close to beneficial enough to outweigh the attitude.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,Kobe_AYEEEEE,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"I'd down with CJ2K, but isn't he still under some absurd contract?"
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,Kobe_AYEEEEE,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:57 2015 UTC,My understanding is he's an undrafted free agent. His $5+M option was declined.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,orange_lazarus1,4,Sun Jul 19 19:04:31 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he wasn't undrafted.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,orange_lazarus1,0,Sun Jul 19 19:43:51 2015 UTC,I meant unrestricted...

GreenBayPackers,3duupn,bujweiser,2,Sun Jul 19 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"My question is what does he bring that Starks doesnt.  Starks knows the playbook well, has playoff and superbowl experience and has been solid when he comes in and he has no baggage.  I would say the baggage thing is the biggest factor when putting them side by side.  Thanks but no thanks."
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,Basaraski,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:33 2015 UTC,Speed is an easy one.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,peenrun303,3,Sun Jul 19 19:21:19 2015 UTC,I feel like Starks speed is just fine and CJ no longer has the jets he use to with Ten.
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,cloutissimo,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"He may no longer have 4.2-4.3 speed, but he's still one of the faster RB's in the NFL. He's definitely faster than Starks, which means he is a true compliment when we want take out Lacy and put in speed. Also, Starks has never really proven to be that great. All of a sudden he's 29 and the most yards he has ever had in a season is 578."
GreenBayPackers,3duupn,lessthan3beebs,3,Sun Jul 19 19:38:00 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with James Starks he's a excellent number 2 RB.

GreenBayPackers,3dqjv6,giganslayer,2,Sat Jul 18 17:41:52 2015 UTC,Both Rodgers and fun are extremely fun to watch. I'm honestly just glad we got them both one after the other.
GreenBayPackers,3dqjv6,Mr-J4kk,3,Sat Jul 18 17:49:37 2015 UTC,He's kinda like that ex-girlfriend you had when you were in your younger crazy phase.  You'd go out and have crazy fun adventures. You'd do spontaneous things and live freely gaining valuable life experiences. You'd have huge fights with both parties screaming and the laundry would end up on the front lawn but the make-up sex made up for it all.  Eventually you grew apart and it just didn't work out. You had a tough break up because you were both passionate people but have since become good friends and can look back on those crazy times fondly.  Luckily you found The One. Not as wild but is the one you want to rule your kingdom and win multiple championships with.
GreenBayPackers,3dqjv6,Odbdb,2,Sat Jul 18 19:41:09 2015 UTC,Except Favre is still the only player to ever win three straight MVP awards.

GreenBayPackers,3dsau2,logani54,5,Sat Jul 18 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone. Maybe Starr once he dies but I'm not so sure.  You can't do Starr without Favre, and you can't do Favre without Rodgers.  I don't see them wanting 5+ statues."
