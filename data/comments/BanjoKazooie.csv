The carrot character is known as ""Quick Carrot"", and along with Rapid Robot and Steady Celery were representatives in the Kinect Sports series."
BanjoKazooie,3dmjuj,OMGshNicholas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:18 2015 UTC,The cube guy is CubeMan from Cubeman: the game.  The carrot guy is Carrot from Carrot-tay: The Carrot Karate game.   I'm so sorry I really have no idea. I thought the carrot guy was a lego guy so I'm just as lost.

BanjoKazooie,3dlhwq,cslayer23,3,Fri Jul 17 06:14:50 2015 UTC,"That is only the stop n swop dialogue. But since nuts and bolts is on replay they will probably keep the changed dialogue. To the original question, not much is different in the xbla versions other than better visuals and controls. Either is great though. I have and play both."
BanjoKazooie,3dlhwq,Flab149,3,Fri Jul 17 07:31:13 2015 UTC,"There's some audio bugs in BK, both games fix some physics bugs, there's no frame drops (mostly was an issue with Tooie), what was done of Stop N Swop is restored, there's some bonuses you can unlock in N&B, there's a filter to make the model's edges less blurry, the 2D artwork has been redone, and there's achievements and leaderboards. The only gameplay that's different is that BK's note and Jinjo systems are more forgiving and that BT has seven components of SNS II that were never used."

Maybe they had it in development for a while, but the popularity of Yooka Laylee and the fact that Rare and Playtonic want to avoid competition kills any chance of a homemade Banjo. Microsoft will most likely get a third party to do the work, since Rare's creative director Simon Woodroffe stated that they're all about making new things and Microsoft themselves said that they'll revive the old Rare IPs back from the dead. In short, a new Banjo game is possible, but it most likely will be made by a third party."

BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,Terryanny,12,Tue Jul 7 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard this argument in the past, and I simply don't agree. Banjo Kazooie was a lot smaller yes, which gives it the advantage over Tooie because in its simplicity and straight forwardness, it can focus more on 'getting to the point', so to speak. But Tooie was much more of a bold and ambitious installment, because in its ever expanding fields of land, the world the player inhabits is more immersive and alive in every sense of the definition. Comparatively speaking, when I look at Banjo Kazooie, I see a series of levels with recognizable themes to them that one would play in succession as they progress through via ascending up the hub world. When I look at Banjo Tooie, I see this fable-like terrain, The Isle 'O Hags, that has a variety of life and characters within it that all subliminally connect in their own unique ways, with 'levels' that are only defined by what region of this hypothetical map you're in. Banjo started out as an RPG on SNES, and in Tooie it feels like they finally got that initial ambience of an RPG down pat, especially with the intertwining story elements arcing over pre established platforming mechanics. This theme of 'Connection' played a huge part in how you traversed across the world and found your way to jiggies and collectables what not. Sometimes it resorted to tedious back tracking, but those examples are far and few in between. And I think the BK team did a fine job at spacing out and adjusting the items and NPCs you interact with in this huge scope of an adventure. Though in terms of scope, what Tooie excelled at, Nuts & Bolts failed. Reason being is that vehicle based challenges don't need as big of an environment as a platforming adventure game, because every pre determined challenge has its own linear route confined to a very small space on the map ahead of time. But an upgraded set of moves for Banjo blended together with an open-world environment of an impressive scale would make a perfect next-gen experience! (cough-Banjo 3-cough-damnyourare-cough). Putting Yooka Laylee back to the scale of Banjo 1 would be a step backward in my opinion.     Also, Tooie had much more heart and character to it. Most everyone in the first game is a caricature that says a line or two just to establish something is happening or to get the action going. That, and humorous quips from the bad guys (where did you get those shorts?). Almost every NPC in Tooie has a story of their own to share, and the main characters, both returning and those making their first appearances, seem to grasp a lot more wit and charm in their dialogue. Through cutscenes or during gameplay, it gets much more attention drawn to it this time around, and rightfully so."
BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,BanjoKazooieManiac,2,Tue Jul 7 23:38:53 2015 UTC,Damn that was a fine argument! But thanks for at least giving your feedback! :) The video was made to promote discussion and just voice my opinion!
BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,BanjoKazooieManiac,2,Wed Jul 8 05:58:24 2015 UTC,Oh don't get me wrong it was a great video! Sometimes I just find myself writing walls of text for fun when it comes to these sorts of topics
BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,cjgerik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:19:31 2015 UTC,"Since we are chatting! I seem to have raggled on some people because I said Banjo Tooie was overshadowed! I must of missed something because from everyone I've talked to, Banjo Tooie WAS overshadowed! Is it the popular opinion that it's not?"
BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,cjgerik,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:05:27 2015 UTC,"I may be misunderstanding you, but you are talking about the brightness (or lack thereof) of certain rooms, correct?    I don't think it was a problem in Banjo-Tooie, with one exception - inside the train, when you enter it to travel somewhere, it's almost impossible for me to see the opening to exit the train.    But besides that, no, it wasn't overshadowed :p"
BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,assholeinhisbathrobe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:30:46 2015 UTC,"Haha noo! I'm talking about whether or not people remember/praise the Banjo Kazooie more than Tooie? My experience is that Tooie just didn't live up to the original, despite all of it's improvements, and most other people I've talked to had the same sentiments.  But looking at the feedback of my video, people thought that idea was really weird, and I just pulled it out of nowhere! They were saying it was commonly accepted that Banjo Tooie was better or on par!"
BanjoKazooie,3cfd89,dhuck20,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:05:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see what you're saying.    Sorry to say, but everyone I've talked to has said Tooie was as good/better than Banjo-Kazooie!  I haven't heard anyone say that Kazooie ""overshadowed"" Tooie, or that Tooie didn't get the attention it deserved!    I still play BK every year, and BT about once every two years, as it is just a longer game to play through, but every bit as fun!"
BanjoKazooie,3c9cgv,FireFoxMcCloud,2,Mon Jul 6 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know how keen you are on constructive criticism, but if I may, I have two recommendations. I would try slowing the tempo a bit, just to enunciate the notes a little more. And I wouldn't use that back beat, it's seems to be too distracting from the instruments in the forefront. Maybe a lower key, like the beat to Clankers Cavern? Either way, it sounds like a promising ominous B-K song. I like it!"
BanjoKazooie,3c0dj8,AngryAncestor,7,Fri Jul 3 16:56:10 2015 UTC,Very neat shirt indeed... But $35.99 and $14.99 shipping to US is a no go for me.
BanjoKazooie,3bz066,ConvenientTowel,3,Fri Jul 3 08:23:31 2015 UTC,"Can't believe I've never noticed this, and I'm fairly antiquated with both versions. That could so easily be fixed I'm certain, It's possible some of the in-game soundfonts got messed up when ported from N64 to Xbox hardware. I don't know.  Send it to Grant maybe, see what he thinks"
BanjoKazooie,3bz066,BanjoKazooieManiac,2,Fri Jul 3 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"The sounds are fine. There's two problems:  1) certain octaves are cut off. So a note played in a cut-off octave defaults to a lower octave.  2) Any sample that uses LFO-bending, like the theremin, simply doesn't have that effect applied.   The instrument samples used in these games are available online (they were hacked out). Most of them are only one .wav file that gets pitched up and down as needed, and other such effects (like the LFO warbling on the theremin, etc.) are applied dynamically.  That's why the theremin comes out sounding flat. That's how the actual .wav for that instrument sounds, and it needs that effect applied dynamically.... something 4J Studios didn't implement or fix in their port."

BanjoKazooie,3bz066,CharlestonChewbacca,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, the missing vibrato effect (the wobblyness of the notes) significantly changes the feel of that Witchyworld track.  Spiral Mountain's first clip is missing vibrato on the background organ-like notes. The second clip has two string notes that are a lower octave than they should be - I trimmed it for time, but the whole strings part is like that. The same octave bug is in Mr. Patch."
BanjoKazooie,3bz066,Vegito2468,2,Fri Jul 3 22:21:55 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Rare Replay version will just be a direct port of the XBLA version without any modifications....  I still think the best way to play Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie is to invest in a N64 and the original games. It's not that expensive and hard to find....     I never played the games on Xbox but I imagine just playing with the Xbox controller is pretty bad, the layout is different, the lack of C Buttons, etc..."

BanjoKazooie,3bvzhd,pappy511,11,Thu Jul 2 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"Originally, the intention was for players to go to the Stop-N-Swop screen in Banjo-Kazooie, turn the game off, and then quickly swap in the Banjo-Tooie cartridge.  On older N64 hardware, the memory would last for around 10 seconds, making this swap possible, but later hardware revisions (I believe it was the revision that came with all the colorful transparent versions) reduced that time to only 1 second, so the feature was abandoned.  What exactly each Stop-N-Swop collectible did is not known."

I belonged to a forum where we would just spend all our time searching for clues of Stop N Swap.  On Mumbo's mountain in Tooie there are weird hieroglyphic designs in the sky, in a circular shape. We spent days trying to decipher what was probably just pixels.  Years were spent not believing that Rare canceled SNS.. Years were spent doing repetitive things to find SNS..  It was our Mew under the truck."

BanjoKazooie,3b90o5,WhoahCanada,4,Fri Jun 26 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression the game was worth 10k based on what was said around E3. 150 achievements for 2780 points. Only 1 Banjo related achievement too, which in itself is just for starting each game once.  Very disappointing. I'm hoping this is a provisional list and more will be updated. Either that or the games will use the 360 version achievements and jus show as a separate game."
BanjoKazooie,3b90o5,infinitelives,2,Sat Jun 27 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine they would say ""10,000 Gamerscore"" and not mean it.  This has to be an incomplete list."
BanjoKazooie,3b90o5,DaveKinetic,2,Sat Jun 27 01:55:59 2015 UTC,"The games that were originally on the 360 are backward compatible, so they have their own achievement lists already. Adding those to the new list puts us just over 1,000GS short.   They could be for the Killer Instinct Classic that is already on the Xbox One, but as it stands now this is 100% the current list that is available."

The games may not have been what we wanted, but they were good. The only reason we didn't like Nuts & Bolts was because it had Banjo in it. Kameo was a fun game, the Viva Pinata games were fun.  Gregg Mayles is the guy who was most responsible for how the Banjo games turned out, after all. And he clearly cares about Banjo, Conker, etc. If he didn't, he would be making Yooka-Laylee right now.   Like, I know people say MS isn't to blame, but if Rare really had a choice about what games they were making, would the veterans have left? No. We would be playing a new Banjo right now or even a new IP.   All Microsoft really cares about is money. They haven't seen a lot of platformers sell well since 2001. When they think they can make money from a Banjo game, we'll get a Banjo game. Luckily, Yooka-Laylee made a huge splash, so now they know people still love platformers.  Mark my words, we will have Banjo-Threeie in about 2-3 years."

BanjoKazooie,3ahk14,Gokee,2,Sun Jun 21 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"Trust me, man, I'm fucking pumped for Yooka-Laylee. But the thing is, no matter how good it is, it's not Banjo.  By the looks of it, it may be better than Banjo, but I just want one more platformer in the Banjo-Kazooie universe. Whether it's good or bad, I just want them to try."
BanjoKazooie,3ahk14,sapi3nce,2,Sun Jun 21 04:49:26 2015 UTC,"""it may be better than banjo""--you lost me there."
BanjoKazooie,3ahnwa,PlayerTP,5,Sat Jun 20 07:12:13 2015 UTC,"Personal Opinion Time: I love Banjo-Tooie, but I don't think I'd put it above the original. The content was all well and good, and the characters were very charming, I just didn't really care for many of the new abilites (aside from the grip-grab, split-up abilities and new boots, loved those).   It didn't really have the flow that BK had, with a lot of odd segments breaking up the action, with the mini-games and the FPS segments. They weren't necessarily bad, but they did disrupt the flow of the game, especially when you had to spend multiple times trying to do them (specifically the Grunty Industries and Glitter Gulch Mine FPS puzzles... sheesh).   I loved most of the characters and worlds, but I have some issues on both matters. With the characters, I felt like there were far too many. It seemed that almost every jiggy had a character associated with it, so instead of encouraging more exploration, it felt like I was just hunting for more NPCs to give me quests. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but not what I'd prefer in a platforming game that excels at letting the player explore.   As for the worlds... did anyone else think they were being too ambitious? Seriously, some of the worlds felt larger than 2 Banjo Kazooie levels COMBINED. The fact that the game suffered from hideous frame-lag issues might have amplified that by making it take longer to navigate the worlds, but they're still crazy huge for having very few flight pads. I wanna say there are maybe... 3 worlds that use Flight Pads? Cloud Cuckoo Land, maybe HFP... and then Witchyworld? I think that's correct.   Overall it's a good game, but I think I prefer the original."
BanjoKazooie,3ahnwa,sylfire,3,Sat Jun 20 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"While I agree that some worlds were too big, I thought that when they were done right, they were better than B-K worlds.   The only level I truly didn't like was Cloud Cuckooland. I though it was way too complicated and I never actually finished it until years later when I used a guide. And the Canary Mary race was complete BS.  You make some good points. Thanks for the feedback."
BanjoKazooie,3ahnwa,sylfire,2,Sat Jun 20 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my favorite worlds from Tooie are really good levels in general, but nothing beats the glory of Click Clock Wood!  The Canary Mary races were pure torture in Cuckooland. I liked a lot of the worlds in Tooie, but the ones I despised (Grunty Industries and Glitter Gulch Mine) were really off-putting to me, so much so that it tarnishes the rest of the game. The only level I have any gripes with in the original is Mad Monster Mansion (I actually liked Rusty Bucket Bay, sue me!), the rest were super fun.  I will say that Banjo-Tooie had some really solid tracks, but the sound design in Kazooie was superior to me."
BanjoKazooie,3ahnwa,LarchMate,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"More than 3 worlds use the flight pads, I'm not 100% sure so I wont throw out a number but Mayahem Temple, Grunty Industries definitely do, and I believe Terrydactyland does too, which is most of the worlds so that points invalid. I personally prefer tooie over kazooie, not in every way though. I think kazooie has more classic / simpler themed levels, and arguable more classic music. It's more relaxed, but in terms of gameplay I much prefer tooie. I think it has the strongest platforming in any game to date, introduces much harder puzzles, lots of new moves and bigger worlds with more to explore."
BanjoKazooie,3ahnwa,sylfire,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"I might be misremembering the lack of flight pads then, it's been a few years since I've played Tooie (I own Kazooie, I borrow Tooie when I feel like playing it)."
BanjoKazooie,3ahnwa,piexil,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:41:32 2015 UTC,See I'm the exact opposite. I like tooie more. I like the abilities. I love the world's (grubtt industries being my favorite). I liked how much exploration was in the game compared to the original.

Kampfheld also claimed to be an anonymous insider who once worked for Rare, and allegedly maintained many connections with people at the company. He dismissed my story, claiming that there were elements of it that were untrue, and insinuating that the parts I was correct about were merely due to random guessing. Kampfheld was respected in that online community for a long time, and was considered a trustworthy source of information. However, at a later date, another anonymous source came forward claiming to be the CEO of the company that Kampfheld currently worked for, and stated that Kampfheld was a liar, which led to him being banned on NeoGaf.

Me and my brother automatically thought ""Man, this game looks REALLY pretty."" So, even though I had just started my banjo experience with B-K N&B, I didn't know what to expect. When I heard there were more B-K games, I was astonished. Not seeing one this year, but seeing such a beautiful game from Rare, gave me hope, got me thinking, What if B-K Grunty-Land is a thing? Or just B-K 3? Rare is heading in the right direction, and bringing its fans with it."

I agree, I feel it is inevitable that Rare will produce another Banjo-Kazooie game in the style/format of the originals.  They wouldn't hold on to it with the intention of doing nothing.  Plus, with the rebranding they are doing, it seems like there's a good chance they are working towards one.    Do I think they've done any work on it yet?  No, probably not.  But even if it'll be another five years, I believe they will.    I just wish someone could ask Phil, ""Hey Phil, will there be another Banjo game, and if so when?"" and that he would reply, ""Yes, there will be, and in three years.  We'll keep you updated.""

I mean, honestly there haven't been that many decent pirate games over the years. Some might argue ACIV and Sid Meier's Pirates, but Assassin's Creed IV didn't have that much depth and Sid Meier's Pirates' aesthetic just put me off. The last pirate game I really enjoyed was from 2003. People are looking at this from the wrong angle. Us Banjo fans are getting Yooka-Laylee, with most of the original developers and Grant FUCKING Kirkhope. Pirate fans get a break from the drought. I don't see anything to get angry about.

I was incredibly disappointed that a new Banjo-Kazooie game wasn't announced. Like probably many people here, it's my favorite game series of all time. It seemed like there were a lot of hints pointing towards a new game, but that have may have been mostly fan interpretation. I wouldn't be surprised; people get passionate about Banjo.  Having taken some time to process my disappointment, I watched the trailer for Sea of Thieves earlier today with fresh eyes. It looks fun. A multiplayer pirate game could be cool, and it does still have that Rare feel to it. I don't know if or when I'll play it though. I was willing to buy an Xbox One for Banjo-Kazooie.

BanjoKazooie,3a75ji,KurapikaKurta,2,Thu Jun 18 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"it could be worse, you could be a Metroid fan...  but in all serious, im actually quite happy, i was never really anticipating banjo threeie in the first place, there wasnt really any hard factual evidence leading towards it.  Im glad that they are working on an actual game.  I mean, Sea of Thieves hasnt really captured me yet, but im happy its not another retarded Kinect game.  If MS keeps Rare busy making real games, then sooner or later, Threeie will come in an inevitable fashion.  So what, we wait a little more, just know that Rare's headed for a bright future.  Hell, who knows, maybe we get an actual Conker sequel, a Perfect Dark with controls that are actually fun to play with, or maybe even we get to see more new IPs that we will love and cherish, as we do to Banjo.  In conclusion: instead of saying ""ugh not this year"", take the glass half full, and look forward to the nex, because it only gets better from here"
BanjoKazooie,3a75ji,KurapikaKurta,2,Thu Jun 18 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly, at least they're off Kinect games."

However, that was not the case.  They alluded heavily to a new Banjo game, and teased even more so during the final week.  You're damn right I'm pissed."
BanjoKazooie,3a3ukj,Rdy4Frdy,3,Wed Jun 17 00:43:28 2015 UTC,I thought it was Project Dream at first . . .

I thought I would find out that I was gonna end up treating myself to my first next gen console. I guess not.   Not angry at Rare for the pirates, because I'm sure it'll be great and I don't want them to fail. But I'm furious at the empty hints they dropped.

BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,_KanyeWest_,10,Mon Jun 15 19:14:47 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Rare is leaving Banjo behind because the heart and soul of it left to build Playtonic. The Rareware we all know and love might be dead, but at least it's spirit is alive and well in Yooka Laylee."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,SooperBread,2,Mon Jun 15 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"No, most if not all the Playtonic team (including Steve Mayles and  Gavin Price) were involved in the early phases of this project before leaving and eventually doing YL with their own team."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,pmeledeo,-5,Mon Jun 15 18:09:44 2015 UTC,Yooka Laylee.   What looks good about this game other than the fact its made by a few ex Rare guys? It looks so boring to me.
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,brainfreeze91,3,Mon Jun 15 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"Well that's because all you have seen so far is a ""demo"" showing off the graphics and very basic character control"

BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,SooperBread,9,Tue Jun 16 16:08:15 2015 UTC,I see the potential for a new Jontron video here
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,IAssassinII,8,Mon Jun 15 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"About the collection, why didn't they make it on Windows as well? Most Rare fans are Nintendo fans, and probably don't own a Xbox One, and won't buy an Xbox one just for that.    If it was on Windows I would buy it eyes closed."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,IAssassinII,2,Tue Jun 16 02:57:43 2015 UTC,Why would you buy it? It's easy to play these games on Windows.
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,IAssassinII,6,Mon Jun 15 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"There's some games only available on Xbox 360 that I want to play. And, hopefully, the emulation of the N64 games is better than what we can get with Project64."

BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,6,Mon Jun 15 18:04:38 2015 UTC,It just stings a little bit because of how long I wanted Threeie is all.
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,6,Mon Jun 15 21:38:44 2015 UTC,I at least hope their new game does well because otherwise rare will be stuck in kinect hell forever.
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,bedabup,8,Mon Jun 15 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"This new game not doing well might actually put Rare into ""dissolved studio"" status, not Kinect game maker."

BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,bedabup,3,Mon Jun 15 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"Then again, there is GamesCom, and Craig Duncan stated that they would announce more stuff this year. Also, the 343 rumor didn't specifically mention E3 if I remember correctly. And 4chan is a crappy source for leaks. In other words, don't give up just yet. BK3 may still be coming, but later than we think."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,3,Mon Jun 15 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"At least it's not Metroid Prime Federation Force. That's going to be the Nuts and Bolts of Metroid (not sure what Other M is, Grunty's Revenge?). The Metroid Prime logo showed up and I was stoked. And then....not. Whether or not it's a good game, I don't really care, it's not Metroid. And now the rumors are that there's no real Prime game in development right now (although we still don't know what Retro is working on currently) and any Prime game would be on NX and not Wii U."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,bedabup,2,Tue Jun 16 14:51:50 2015 UTC,I missed something big didn't I? Going to watch the Microsoft event now.  Edit: well that was awfully disappointing :/ wtf rare?
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,-2,Thu Jun 18 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"Wooowwww. I don't understand this hate on the game. It looks good. Sure it isn't Banjo-kazooie, but don't hate on it. It's not some boring MMO. It's a decent looking pirate exploration game that you've only seen about 5 minutes of gameplay of. They've come a long way from kinect sports and the fact they are making something new is a huge leap forward. This entire sub-reddit has been irrational and i'm ashamed to have thought you guys were good fans."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,bedabup,17,Tue Jun 16 15:41:21 2015 UTC,Hey man all I said was fuck
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the comments were the bad part. The reply was to the general subreddit. I understand being upset but most people are being childish."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,2,Mon Jun 15 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"Guns of Icarus type games aren't exactly something that appeals to platformer fans. For me personally, manning one cannon while 12 year olds blather on about ""booty"" jokes doesn't really sound like a game I would enjoy.   It was also a pretty awful trailer to be honest. I got to see that there's pirates, boats, and islands. What's the combat look like? Where do I get on a boat? Do I own a boat?   I know it's an early announcement trailer, but it didn't hype you up to find out those questions, it just left you going, why is this a thing? Either hype people up, or give them a reason to give a shit. That trailer did neither."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,idkartist3D,-1,Mon Jun 15 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it. From what I gathered you could explore islands and form a crew to man your ship. You of course play as a pirate and are on the hunt for treasure with your crew.   You assume the worst by stating something about 12 year olds. The combat was sword fighting and using guns and stuff. After you damage a ship enough to board it you get to fight directly.  This game is deeper than you give credit because you don't care to give credit, you care to find flaws. This trailer hyped everybody up except banjo fans. It looked good but some people just went blind because it didn't have banjo."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,sargentsuicide,4,Mon Jun 15 18:56:02 2015 UTC,"You're making a lot of assumptions off a fairly short and nondescript trailer. Maybe you're new to E3, but that's a really good way to  wind up disappointed and with a game full of empty promises. If it's not explicitly stated to be in the game then it's better to just assume it's not even in it."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,STierGamefreak,-4,Mon Jun 15 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not new to E3, but being a pessimist about everything is awful. Maybe I shouldn't have gone to the hive of disgruntled fans but this level of hate is absurd and childish. I DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT FLAVOR OF ICECREAM SO I DON'T WANT IT AT ALL."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,IAssassinII,0,Mon Jun 15 19:13:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, well you go have fun and play The Last Guardian, Agent, and any of the other amazing games that have been shown off at E3 and never even saw the light of day while I stay here and be pessimistic because I understand what marketing is."
BanjoKazooie,39xs2e,lumpybread,-5,Mon Jun 15 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know what those games are and I don't care. And I think i'll go play my backwards compatible games instead, or perhaps the rare collection that nobody wants to like. Maybe i'll take a shot at playing fallout 4 or something. This subreddit is full of children. I can't stand people that believe everything is inherently evil. I'm unsubbing because of this heinous reaction to the game. No wonder the game has a cult fanbase, it's because it's filled with children that normal people won't be associated with. It's probably why rare doesn't cater to this fanbase. Have fun hoping for a new Banjo game while I play this game that rare is taking a shot with. You'll always be disappointed because you wanna live in the past. They even gave you the past and you threw it out the window. You know what false marketing is and believe that is everything. Nuts and bolts was an okay game, peace out."

BanjoKazooie,39xs3b,Wazzok1,20,Mon Jun 15 17:45:10 2015 UTC,That pirate MMO looked HORRIBLE. And since they didn't say a single word about it after that trailer I guess Microsoft felt the same way about it.   Just let Rare go if you don't want to use any of their existing IPs.

Yooka-Laylee is coming, and Rare is making games outside of what seems like Kinect Sports. Also, they're acknowledging their past games, so that's something. It's like:  ""Hey, we know what we've done before, and we haven't forgotten.""  That's what I'm taking out of it. Besides, there are a lot of other neat games going on, so no worries y'all. I'm sure we'll get our Banjo fix sometime in the near future."

If the old Rare team was working on this, I'd bet my money that this MMO would revolutionize the genre and set the bar. I would be excited as all hell about a Rare MMO.  But this isn't old Rare. This is slightly post-kinect Rare. This is the rare that teases B-K and all they have to show is a collection of old games, 2 of which are B-K.   I've been burned/mislead/lied to for the last time. Fuck Rare. Fuck Microsoft. And all fucking hail Playtonic Games!  Disclaimer: I have no actual opinion on Sea of Thieves. I don't care if it succeeds or fails."

BanjoKazooie,39y79s,Beareh,0,Tue Jun 16 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"I think it looks pretty bad. When I heard about it I was optimistic, but after looking at the trailer I'm not excited at all. I loved the Pirates section in Disney Infinity and I thought Black Flag was pretty good, but this just isn't doing it for me.   I would have preferred a platformer or something. MMOs just don't really do it for me in general. The closest thing to an MMO that I like is Destiny, and that's only got MMO elements."
BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,ilovegoogleglass,13,Mon Jun 15 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"SO LET'S RECAP:   Phil Spencer, Phil Harrison, and Playtonic stressed that the game was something to look forward to, and that they would try to avoid rivalry Phil Spencer specifically mentioning Greg Mayles as the director of the game Robin Beanland's tease about 'fixing his Banjo' and his later tease with the top of that music sheet A 'leak' about Banjo at E3 on NeoGAF in October 2014 A 'leak' about Banjo at E3 in April of 2015, with a made up story about 343 employees being tasked to collaborate A 'leak' about Banjo in April that correlated with the previous one The BanjoThreeie.com domain being renewed by MS Rare hyping up the reveal on twitter   AND THEN YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED DURING THE CONFERENCE:   Banjo Kazooie, Banjo Tooie, and N&B swirling around in the background during the backwards compatibility segment The Rare Replay trailer glorifying Rare's past games Phil Spencer hiding the Rare emblem on his shirt UNTIL the very end, implying there was more to come, only to have the stream abrubtly end   Yes, I'm pissed it wasn't Banjo 3. Who the fuck wouldn't be after all that build up?"
BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,BanjoKazooieManiac,2,Mon Jun 15 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Phil Spencer hiding the Rare emblem on his shirt UNTIL the very end, implying there was more to come, only to have the stream abrubtly end   This actually has me wondering...

BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,darkforce547,5,Mon Jun 15 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"But why would they wait? Why not show it off at the main event with all the other big new games? I mean, part of me wants to believe him coming out with the shirt on is him trying to say ""Don't worry Rare fans, there's still more to come"", but I honestly doubt there will be anything. Doesn't mean I'm not hoping for Banjo-Threeie to still be revealed, it's just that in all reality the chances are really, reeeeally slim."
BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,idkartist3D,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"The way that I'm looking at it is this.   A quite a few anticipated games were not announced (Banjo Threeie and Joe Montana Football being the biggest two) This year's conference had a good number of not so subtle jabs at Sony Microsoft's marketshare has diminished with this current system generation, in large part because of game exclusivity quality. The key franchise for Microsoft was the Halo franchise, but that clearly could not sustain XBONE sales like it did the 360. Despite this, the vast majority of titles were retreads (Backwards compatibility, Halo, Fallout 4, Dark Souls, Rare's 30th Anniversary Collection, Forza (Seriously, who the fuck was asking for another Forza?))   This all leads me to a few conclusions.   The big non-retread ideas will be later in E3 if they want to be emphasized They very well may link these with the Sony press conference in order to upstage the competition Today was an emphasis on making the old new again, so if that is to follow, then we may just see just that with some more retreads (a la Banjo).   Do I think it's likely? No. I honestly didn't believe the rumors even way back in October. But I'm not ruling it out from today's conference."

BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,idkartist3D,6,Mon Jun 15 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"What the hell happened in this subreddit? They announced backwards compat for Kazooie, Tooie and Nuts, a collection including all 3 for a dollar each and a brand new game that's Captain Blackeye's new vehicle making it a Banjo Spinoff. This is the best E3 in ten years for Rare fans."
BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,TheMasterDS,2,Tue Jun 16 05:49:47 2015 UTC,I just realized Sea  of Thieves is indeed a banjo spin off with Blackeye being involved.
BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,Legionaryprime,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:55:27 2015 UTC,Wasn't Blackeye originally supposed to be the main villain of Dream? I guess that would make Sea of Thieves a spin-off of a cameo from a game that never came to be.

BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,TheMasterDS,0,Tue Jun 16 12:03:46 2015 UTC,That is not a reasonable response. I wanted a new main series Banjo game (like we were hinted). Another re-release of the first games on a console I don't own is nothing for me to get excited about.

BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,TheMasterDS,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm delighted by Yooka-Laylee. I backed it and am eagerly awaiting the next update from the devs. I just got my hopes up for a new title starring my childhood friends once again. I would buy an Xbone to play a new Banjo in a second. I bought the 360 solely for Nuts & Bolts and I'd do it again.   Sea of Thieves looks great. I just watched IGN's analysis of the trailer. However, at risk of sounding like a child: this is not Banjo. The hints, the clues...everything screamed new Banjo! But we did not receive new Banjo. I can't stop myself from being utterly disappointed.   Btw, recognize you from DK Vine. Haha."

BanjoKazooie,39y1fj,BanjoKazooieManiac,2,Mon Jun 15 23:16:39 2015 UTC,"This game seems like a budget title, so I wouldn't rule out this is their main game.    As shitty as the situation is, this is absolutely their main game. Simon Woodroffe said that the world will know of Rare's next tile come E3, and also said later that Rare are about doing new things. Greg Mayles and Robin Beanland both have screen names in the trailer's footage. Craig Duncan said it was the most ambitious thing they had done yet, Phil Harrison's exact words when discussing the main game a few month's prior.   Having Banjo 3 be of a smaller priority, and to have it be the game it's former director isn't working on is ridiculous. Then again, with all the shit we've seen so far anything is possible."

I hate to say it, but so was BK: N&B as well, despite the unwanted game mechanics, it was a beautifully designed game.    I am very excited to see this year's Microsoft press conference, as well as Nintendo Direct tomorrow, there's a lot of rumors and I just personally can't wait to see what's true and what isn't   I would be happy with any BK collectathon platformer at this point.  I've seen some comments from other posts about not believing Rare has the expertise and experience to make a proper BK game, however Playtonic openly admitted to wanting to help Rare with certain projects, so don't give up hope just yet :)"

(Without hating on the game itself, never played it, can't say.)  It surprisingly works on some characters but Banjo and especially Kazooie are ugly (based on what I saw).    3- PC version, please! If the game is actually good, I don't want to have to buy a Xbox One just for this game... (But if the game ends up being good I will... Oh yes I will...)    4- Nothing about Kinect in the game, not a line of code referencing Kinect.    5- Grant Kirkhope. A Banjo game is not a Banjo game without Grant's music."

The main team is probably working on the new IP that people have been talking about.  2: It could be called Banjo threeie, or they renewed it for to be as a redirect link to the true url/name of the game.  3: That's highly plausible, they've even alluded to it.  4: Definitely, I think making it look pixar like should be their end goal.  5: All of them, I think ignored. It could start off as Banjo having a bad dream of being in Nuts & bolts and waking up.  6: Pixar like is a good bet.  7: Driving could be a mini game and for transportation. With FPS sections I think they'll cut them out to be used at anytime during gameplay.  8: Yeah, Gregg Mayles is still there (brother of Steve Mayles.)  9: Xbox One only, Phil knows this will sell consoles.  10: Current gen only.  11: Summer of next year.  12: Doubt it."

I guess we'll see.  2.) I'm not too sure about it being called Banjo Threeie, that might be a bit too obscure for people who aren't hardcore into the series. The URL thing might be so going to ""Banjothreeie.com"" goes to the website of the new game.  3.) Possibly, would be a fun cameo. Especially if we get to see a reverse cameo in the X1 version of Yooka.  4.) I don't know shit about resolution, would the game being cartoony have any effect on it?  5.) Googly eyes will remain. Nuts & Bolts will be canon, but also be made fun of.  6.) They'll go back to more classic designs, not 100% the originals.  7.) Not too sure about MP. The new Tomb Raider won't have it even though the first did; maybe MS has realized no one likes tacked on MP & people will play Halo/Gears/Forza/third party games (& Smash/Mario Kart on Wii U) for their MP needs.  8.) We don't know if the ""new blood"" of Rare is shit or not. We can't really judge them on Kinect Sports.  9.) Xbox One at launch, MAYBE a PC version down the line if it doesn't sell alot.  10.) Next-gen only. MS is done with first party games on 360.  11.) It'll come out next year. MS is pretty set on Halo/Tomb Raider/Forza being their retail releases for this year (Battletoads could come out this year digitally though). I think next fall will be Gears of War/Banjo/Crackdown.  12.) No because those were crappy versions of the N&B designs."

It was one of those things where I had the idea to start it one day, did a little bit of work on it, and then put it off until I picked it up again and finished it.  I already have a library of Banjo-Kazooie/Tooie samples set up, so it was just a matter of transcribing the main theme by ear using my preexisting musical knowledge.  This track in particular actually has a lot of repeating themes and ideas, so I didn't necessarily have to transcribe every single note manually."

BanjoKazooie,393zwo,Alfarin,3,Tue Jun 9 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"It has been years since I've played these titles!   Something you didn't talk about that I find interesting: Rare was working on a handheld Diddy Kong Racer when they were bought by Microsoft. No longer having access to the IP necessary, they slapped Banjo characters in the place of Diddy Kong cast. I don't know why it was so bad. You could argue that the GBA held it back, but for me, the races were necessary evils to unlock things  (I like unlocking things). When the core mechanic of your game is a chore to be able to get to the neat music and character unlocks, you've dropped the ball.   And something I thought I'd mention about Grunty's Revenge: It came out soon after the release of the GBA. For the time, I quite enjoyed it. I'll admit, Spyro did a better job in the handheld department, but for a GBA game, it pulled its weight in my opinion. The characters were neat, the platforming was okay, the Rare ""feel"" was there. I'd say it's worth the 6 bucks you'd pay for it nowadays."
BanjoKazooie,393zwo,Chruxl,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"I also picked up both these titles recently; they're easy to try at less than 10$ apiece! While I do agree with most of your points on Pilot, I thoroughly enjoyed Grunty's Revenge. The platforming and collecting elements are quite similar to the N64 titles and it truly brought back that classic Banjo-feel for me. Also, the Mumbo transformations are top-notch! I needed Octopus and Candle-Banjo in my life."
BanjoKazooie,393zwo,Wonderbolt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:39:23 2015 UTC,I enjoyed both when I played them ~10 years ago. I probably played through GR again a couple times. Banjo Pilot was okay... I don't think I disliked it as much as OP but if I was playing it for the first time in 2015 I probably would feel the same way... it just looks bad.

So he can, you know, see and stuff. We did decide that we are going to use fully animated eyes with eyelids, rather than using animated textures to make them blink like they did in the original game.

Instead of showing just one character here and there, it'll be whole areas. The next thing I'm working on is Mumbo's mountain, so the updates you can look forward to are things like ticker's tower, Conga's area, Mumbo's skull inside and out, etc.  I'm setting up a blog too, where I'll be posting little bits like this one too, if anyone is interested in the step by step updates, but I won't be posting those here."

BanjoKazooie,37pqqu,Sephonik,3,Fri May 29 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"So, there's Yooka, Hat in Time, and possible Banjo Threeie, his chance in smash, and the possibility for Nintendo to make a Mario 64 successor. Indeed Golden Age."
BanjoKazooie,37pqqu,Wazzok1,2,Fri May 29 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"This year is the first with the highest chance that a new Banjo will be announced since 2008.  Never before has there been a whole bunch of rumours spanning 7 months. Sure, there's been rumours just in time for E3, but they were from a week before it statrted.

BanjoKazooie,378ibk,IAssassinII,3,Mon May 25 20:43:18 2015 UTC,No. Just an alternate way of doing it.
BanjoKazooie,378ibk,Hedrigall,3,Mon May 25 21:52:26 2015 UTC,...How exactly did you beat the world if Clanker is still underwater?
BanjoKazooie,378ibk,jdmoser,0,Tue May 26 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't. I went back to the level after beating it to demonstrate this as Banjo-Kazooie is my ""internet is down"" game.  I was just curious about the platform physics and why you can sometimes jump higher than you should."
BanjoKazooie,378ibk,Bobbeyjazz,2,Tue May 26 05:00:29 2015 UTC,Collision detection is never really perfect. Sometimes you can just glitch up onto things. It doesn't really mean anything :) More of an exploit than a bug.
BanjoKazooie,374jfx,IAssassinII,9,Sun May 24 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I find Yooka-Laylee to be really bright and colorful :)  But I guess showing off a green character in a green environment is not the best of ideas? Not as much contrast. Maybe you'll enjoy the vibrant colors more as we see less-green worlds!  In my opinion, specially compared to Banjo-Tooie, Yooka-Laylee is really really colorful - it reminds me more of a Mario game at times. And that, to me, is great!"
BanjoKazooie,374jfx,shyPiano,4,Mon May 25 00:45:09 2015 UTC,"I thought Banjo-Tooie was fairly colorful (though the content was pretty dark). Anyway, I hope it's like /u/Hwantaw said, that Yooka is able to change colors at various times somehow because he's a chameleon. I'm honestly just so excited to see some cool new worlds with more Grant Kirkhope masterpieces. A new tropical location similar (but different obviously) to Treasure Trove Cove would be awesome. It could expand with more islands, ships, shipwrecks, etc. to explore."
BanjoKazooie,374jfx,Hwantaw,4,Mon May 25 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"It's definitely different, but that might work out for the best.  Also, plenty of room to have fun with the colours of a chameleon in the game mechanics."
BanjoKazooie,374jfx,WhoahCanada,2,Sun May 24 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"Very true, and I'm sure they will implement that further along in development."
BanjoKazooie,374jfx,stormandbliss,2,Sun May 24 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"In one of the many interviews with Playtonic, I remember them saying that they already have this idea in mind, that Yooka will be able to change colour/appearance in some way."
BanjoKazooie,374jfx,SpookersTheSpoo,4,Mon May 25 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty, but isn't as genius as BK's.  Banjo's three main colors were Red, Blue, and Yellow...  three primary colors.  This made sure the character would ""pop out"" no matter where they were.  Though, that was on the N64.  Graphics are sharper nowadays and the color palette may not be as important."

I just think Yooka and Laylee might be a little bit bare right now, which is totally fine and the game is only 3 months in, so anything is subject to change. But if Playtonic want to go this route and stick with the current character design, I'm totally fine with that."

To figure out which version of the game you have, look at the back and shine the game in a light. You can see two numbers imprinted on the back and possibly a letter after the two numbers. If there is not a letter than you have version 1.0 which means you can do the glitch. If you have a letter after the numbers then you cannot do the glitch because you have version 1.1."

The theremin isn't properly modulated (sounds flat rather than wobbly), and some instruments like the strings don't have the full range that they should... so certain higher notes end up being an octave lower.  Go load up your copy of Banjo-Tooie on XBLA and listen to Spiral Mountain, and then go on YouTube and listen to it. That's probably the best example :)"

(Search for custom plush or see if popular plush makers take requests). I've paid folks on there before for custom plushies, and while a BK one might be a little complex/on the more expensive side, it's always an option so keep it in mind.  Best of luck in your quest!

BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,Underwhere_Overthere,21,Thu May 14 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"I managed to finally beat her this year. If I gave you advice it'd probably be everything you've already read. Her difficulty is ""rubber-banded"" so she'll always be ahead of you. Now I've bet you've read that you gotta stay just behind her til the very end of the race. The. Very. End. Not at the top of that mountain. Not going down the hill. Stay behind her right until you can see Wumbas wigwam then mash A like hell. Good luck friend."
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,TheFeb29thInflux,5,Thu May 14 21:07:30 2015 UTC,This needs to be up-voted for visibility.  I thought it was impossible to beat her without a turbo controller as a kid.  Nowhere in the game does it indicate that you have to stay behind her the entire time in order to be reasonably expected to win.  The moment you pull ahead of her she goes tryhard and becomes nearly impossible to beat with human hands.  I didn't learn this myself until just last year when playing the game for the first time in years.  I thought I would have to bust out a turbo controller but I found out about her bulshit rubber band AI.  Once you know what to do it's not that hard at all it's just that there was never any indication of what you're supposed to do.
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,mistermoogle,14,Thu May 14 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"Back when the 360 version of BT came out, my friends and I (all massive fans) had a race to 100%, knowing full well that the last Cheato page would be near impossible.  One of these friends was a drummer, and just plugged his Rock Band drum kit into the Xbox and ripped a mad drum roll and kicked Mary's butt!  So you could try that I guess?"
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,theironwaffles,6,Fri May 15 01:16:49 2015 UTC,"I have your solution, look no further, as that bitch caused me plenty of pain in my childhood.   Go to your kitchen, take out a large kitchen spoon.    Plug in Banjo-Tooie, load that baby up, get to the canary race.   When it starts, you want to hold the spoon with the curvy part on top of the A/B buttons (I forget which one you have to press currently, probably A).   Move the spoon left to right, back and forth, as quickly as you can. It's a LOT easier to shake your whole hand side-to-side than push one finger up and down.  It helps to put your thumb in the spoon to apply pressure downward.   Go grab a beer, sit back and watch that fucker's tears stream down her stupid canary face.    Enjoy!"
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,cjgerik,4,Thu May 14 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"My go to trick is to practically vibrate my finger on the button or just use both pointer fingers and alternate them quickly on the button. Then, when my arms or fingers get tired I pause the game, wait a bit and then unpause and keep it going. It seemed to work the last few times I played through the game."
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,yonkomother,1 point,Thu May 14 21:35:20 2015 UTC,This is what I always did. Screw rubber band strategies! I beat her with brute force and I my friends were astounded.

I don't like to hate any characters, (not that there are many you can hate to begin with), but good lord do I utterly loathe that cheap bird.   I say keep trying, but feel free to call it a day anytime. I managed to beat her (eventually).   If Yooka-Laylee has its own Canary Mary... I may ask for a refund"
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,AtrumDelorox,-3,Thu May 14 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"If it bothers you that much, why wouldn't you find out first if it has a Canary Mary and THEN decide if you want to get it?"
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,Shirubaa,4,Thu May 14 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"It was mostly sarcasm. To really push how much I hate that bird.   Even if there was one, I could tolerate it. I wouldn't be happy, but not to the point where I'd regret disliking the rest of the game."
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,AtrumDelorox,-4,Thu May 14 21:13:45 2015 UTC,I was hoping it was sarcasm. I was ready to fist bump your face if it wasn't.   There's such a weird culture of people who just buy things blindly without knowing anything about them and when they find something that upsets them they automatically expect the person who sold it to them to compensate them for it. Nerds.
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,Shirubaa,2,Thu May 14 22:06:04 2015 UTC,"I've gotten her jiggy, I don't remember if I got her Cheato page (I think the answer is yes?). Basically, the easiest strategy is to mash as fast as you possibly can, and whenever you feel yourself slowing down, pause, take a small break, then get back to it. There's no need to rush your pause breaks: if you need to take 15 minutes resting your hands, go for it. Just come back prepared to mash again. It's painful, tiring work, but you will succeed almost every time."
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,sylfire,2,Thu May 14 21:41:01 2015 UTC,I got the jiggy last week with the help of 2 friends. We paused and passed the controller between us whenever we got tierd.

BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,UnorthaParaDox17,2,Fri May 15 05:39:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know how this happened, but I beat Canary Mary for her jiggy on all three of my current save files! I just mashed the A button with my index finger, and once I had the momentum going, I went way ahead of her. Before I was never able to even keep up with her enough for her to continue on with the race. She always ended it early because of how slow I was. Never even came close to keeping up with her.  I still haven't gotten the Cheato Page on any of my files, but I have come close. She always catches up with me about halfway. And then I have to rest my hand for a bit so it doesn't tire out before I even get going. At least it feels like I have a shot now.  I went from never being able to beat Canary Mary for 14.5 years to doing so three times in one day. Not bad. It just sucks that after you beat her, you don't feel as accomplished because you realize you just have to do it again. But hey, at least I've 99.87% completed the game now instead of 99.74%."
BanjoKazooie,35zjoq,monkey_swagger,1 point,Fri May 15 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"I was in your exact same spot - had never beat Canary Mary in Cloud CuckooLand and had read dozens of tips that didn't work - until I read these two tips:   1) most importantly, do NOT look at the screen during the race. Somehow looking at the screen slows you down.   2) Pause the race whenever you can't mash at top speed. That is, when you feel yourself pushing the buttons slower than your max, pause the game and take as long as you need until you feel recovered and can mash again at top speed. During the winning race I probably paused at least 4 times and waited about a solid minute each time before I resumed."

The key to almost every BK/BT challenge is to sandbag. Seriously, the AI is programmed to try to be slightly better than you. If you go full throttle in any of the challenges (Mr. Vile, Boggy, Canary Mary, etc.) than the AI will also go full throttle and you will have a terribly hard time beating them, but if you hold back and play poorly the AI will also hold back, then sometime between halfway to two-thirds of the way to the finish you can put your all into it and pull ahead of the AI and usually finish in 1st before the AI can rubber band back to you. It actually makes a lot of the challenges super easy."

BanjoKazooie,357kqw,smoqueed42,4,Thu May 7 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"IIRC There isn't too much of a difference between them. The 360 version has updated graphics and leaderboards. Its also a bit easier to 100 percent because the collectible notes in the game dont reset if you leave the current world so if you want to collect them all you dont have to get them all in one shot. But thats not a problem in the originals. If you all ready had a 360 i would go for those over the originals just because the n64 looks pretty shitty on widescreens, but i wouldn't buy a 360 specifically to play them. I would suggest picking up the originals if you can find them for a good price"
BanjoKazooie,357kqw,sylfire,3,Thu May 7 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"Banjo-Tooie has terrible framerate issues on the N64. If this is your first time playing the games, the Xbox 360 version might be better for you. The Carts together are around $60, without a guarantee of functionality (sadly), while a refurbished 360 could probably be picked up for less than $100, and functions as a mediocre streaming box/DVD player. Not to mention you could buy Nuts and Bolts for dirt (let me finish before you assault me!) so you can experience why people were upset about the game.  There are some other pretty good games you could pick up, but I'll leave that to your discretion.  DISCLAIMER: I have not played the 360 versions, but I know that the framerate problems don't exist in the 360 version of Tooie, and IT IS A VERY AWFUL PROBLEM. Seriously, in N64 version of Tooie, you can noticeably watch the frames die if too much ends up showing up on your screen. If you really want the smoothest experience, get the Xbox version. If you want the (more difficult, more frustrating) classic experience, try to go for the cartridges. Just be wary of scummy dealers (one reason why the Xbox version might be better: don't have to worry about faulty/fake carts!)."
BanjoKazooie,357kqw,sylfire,2,Wed May 13 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"fake/faulty   If you don't mind me asking all this time later, what do you mean?  I found quite a few 'refurbished' carts for fairly cheap ($20), meaning they've put new 'stickers' on them. Could they simply be carts that previously held 'cheap' games and BK was placed on it?"
BanjoKazooie,357kqw,assadsm,2,Sun May 17 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"Not at all!  Refurbished could mean many things. It could be replacing the innards with a copy of BK, the outer shell of a BK game that got mangled so it was replaces, a new sticker printed and placed onto the original game, etc.  When I say fake/faulty, I mean ones that are falsely advertised as BK, and then shipped as something else. For example, getting sent a Gex cart instead of a BK cart. Or even a cart that has a BK sticker on it, but is some other game instead. It's not a common practice, but still a possibility. I would venture a guess and say you are not likely to encounter this, but it's still possible."

BanjoKazooie,357kqw,Underwhere_Overthere,1 point,Thu May 7 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"If you have an N64 and not an Xbox 360, then I'd say just buy the carts. The original games still hold up pretty well... unlike most everything else from the time.  The only catch is the framerates might be way more noticeable these days, if that's the kind of thing that might bother you. Especially in Banjo-Tooie. Rare really pushed the N64 with it.  The benefit of the 360 versions is that they run completely smooth. They're otherwise exactly the same except for a higher resolution and updated HUD graphics (everything else was left lo-res)."
BanjoKazooie,357kqw,theballaam96,1 point,Mon May 11 15:26:17 2015 UTC,"The XBox 360 version has leaderboards, better graphics, better draw distance (so you can see items from further away, which is very helpful), and a stable frame-rate. The XBox 360 versions are definitely superior and only cost $15 total for both of them. Buying an XBox 360 plus the downloadable games is probably cheaper than buying the original Nintendo 64 cartridges honestly."

However, I can understand people's issues with frame rate on Tooie and graphics. However, cost shouldn't factor in. If you're going to buy a 360 just for B-K and B-T, it's not financially viable. You can get Banjo Kazooie for £12 on eBay (£14 on Amazon) and Tooie for ~£18 on eBay.  Look at what you want and what you'll use the 360 for, then make your decision."
BanjoKazooie,357kqw,WhoahCanada,1 point,Tue May 19 16:00:51 2015 UTC,The N64 controller is better and the in-game colors are more saturated. Those are my reasons for you to play the originals.

B-T though...  360 is the way to go.  I loved the game back in the day, but replaying it today is unbearable in certain areas because of the frame rate drop.  I would buy both on the 360 for Stop N Swop implementation."

My plan actually was to reach out to Microsoft near the end of this project once it's all fine-tuned and perfect and see if we can't make it commerically available through licensing. Of course they can say no (which I sure hope they don't), but I can always pull the student card and say I was making this for educational purposes and distribute it for free, especially considering I'm making EVERYTHING from scratch. I'll talk to a lawyer before I do anything, but copyright law is a bit more lenient when you create everything yourself; case in point: mobile game clones.  If need be, I can always change a few major things here and there, give characters different names, and make different music, then rebrand it as a different game and I wouldn't be infrigning upon their IP, but I would much rather release it as the official HD remake.

I get that you're doing this yourself, but you must understand IP and the fact that your using intellectual property of Microsoft.   You will get shut down. Microsoft will not allow distribution of the product, even IF you get to pull a student card.   Mario 64 HD got shut down, and that was a really small production.  If you get ANY following at all via here or YouTube and Microsoft catches wind, you're done. That's how this works.   I want this remake, and I want it to be successful.

If Rare reveals a Banjo game, I will need to see a lot of gameplay and reviews before even considering buying it (and buying an Xbox One....)

I'm already in love with Yooka and Laylee, and I can't wait to see all the great ideas Playtonic have in the future, but I wouldn't mind seeing Rare's IPs coming back to life too!"
BanjoKazooie,350td5,nonAMfootball,14,Wed May 6 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"obviously there will be a rivalry, but there is still so much uncertainty. Right now YL has the upper hand because they have already generated so many good feelings and the fact that it's being developed by many original banjo developers is huge. All these years later, these people have left what they were working on or whatever they were doing in life and came together to make this game. That demonstrates some serious heart and belief, not to mention massive balls. So props right now to Playtonic for taking a risk.   On the other hand, lets just go ahead and assume Microsoft is developing banjo 3. They have the assets, but do they have what it takes to make a banjo game? To many people, banjo is about more than just collecting shit. The characters and humor are all so integral to the series. Do not underestimate Microsoft just because they have neglected this series in the past. If they are making this game, give it a fair look.   Personally, I am very interested to see how these platformer games will be received all these years later. This is a plunge back into a type of game that was seemingly abandoned all those years ago. Of course there will be innovations, but i'm excited to see if these games live up to my memory of them."
BanjoKazooie,350td5,chimairacle,1 point,Wed May 6 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"This is so true. I'm not sold on the characters of Yooka Laylee yet, but I honestly think it has the best chance of success, even if Microsoft wants to bring Banjo back.  The way I look at it, it could go either of two ways. If Microsoft is making another Banjo game, they're either going to:  a) Crush it completely and blow Playtonic out of the water while conveniently taking a dump on their love child, which - let's face it - is probably VERY unwanted by the Microsoft camp right now. I'm guessing Playtonic had been getting a lot of legal advice prior to Yooka Laylee's announcement because if they hadn't, Microsoft would probably be suing them right now for trying to make money off the back of an IP they own. I'm no lawyer, but big companies like Microsoft have huge legal power and if they got mad over this, it would likely be lights out for Playtonic real fast.  b) Fail. Either by bringing back the Nuts 'n Bolts style characters, making a generally poor game with no nostalgia factor and little to tie it to the first games, or rushing the development and release in order to put pressure on Playtonic.  Option B definitely seems to be the most likely. Playtonic has the creative power to pull this off, but relies on the public a lot to get the word out and to have faith in a new, small studio. Microsoft has the marketing power to put ads anywhere and everywhere to advertise the great and long-awaited return of our favourite bear and bird duo. The timing of Rare bringing out a new game definitely gives the impression that pressure tactics might be what's happening here, but that doesn't seem like the wisest business decision.  Plus, the bottom line is this - If Playtonic brings out the best game in years, the Threeie we never had... we could be looking at sequels, at expansion, at more and better games, and maybe even a revival of the platformer. If Microsoft brings out the perfect game, it'll be super popular for a short while, it'll get good reviews...but it's still only gonna be on Xbox. And that in itself is one of Microsoft's greatest problems. I honestly just don't see how they can win (in a way that lets them keep their fanbase)."
BanjoKazooie,350td5,IAssassinII,5,Wed May 6 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"yeah to be honest, I've accepted the end of Banjo years ago and I see a new Banjo in Yooka and it looks really cool and its made by the same guys of Banjo so for now, I'm with Yooka."
BanjoKazooie,350td5,aerandir92,1 point,Wed May 6 12:21:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. For me, a Banjo-Threeie made by what is left of Rare would just be a soulless husk. As much as I love Banjo, Yooka gets my vote of confidence because it seems like it contains more of the soul of Banjo than a new game by Rare would. The guys making Yooka probably play a large role in that."

I'm really excited for E3 and when there is the chance to pre-order Yooka Laylee, It'll be in my shopping cart because A: I love platforming games B: I love Grant Kirkhope's music.

BanjoKazooie,350td5,InMyRestlessDreams,3,Wed May 6 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"Banjo is dead to me.. Even if a new game was announced, I don't think I would buy it. There's also the fact that I don't own an Xbox One (And most likely never will). Yooka Layee is the new Banjo and that's something I've come to accept."

BanjoKazooie,350td5,AtrumDelorox,2,Wed May 6 12:22:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't get your hopes up for anything. Last few times people got hype for something new that rare was announcing it turned out to be something really disappointing.

BanjoKazooie,350td5,Supernintendolover,2,Wed May 6 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"I want to say Yooka-Laylee (I know I'll be playing both). But, I was foolish enough to buy a 360 just for Nuts and Bolts and history is likely to repeat itself. YL will be the better game, but they will probably coexist in a noncompetitive matter, sharing many of the same players. Maybe even referencing each other?"
BanjoKazooie,350td5,GuyOutsideYourWindow,1 point,Wed May 6 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"Why does there have to be a rivalry?  If it is Banjo Threeie we should be rejoicing!  TWO collect-a-thon platformers after the genre practically being dead for a decade!? And being made by people who know what they're doing!?  People seem to think that no one from old Rare is left but there are. There was a list on Neogaf but I can't find it. Still, the game is being headed by Greg Mayles who was the lead designer of Kazooie, Tooie and Nuts and Bolts. Also it will most likely will be composed by Robin Beanland who composed Conker's Bad Fur Day and did some of the songs for Nuts and Bolts.   If the rumors are true, I'm psyched."
BanjoKazooie,34zsj9,OjJaz,5,Tue May 5 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"I severely doubt a Banjo Threeie was made as competition against Yooka - Laylee, keep in mind it only got successful less than a week ago. Rare's new project was already well in development early last year, Banjo or not."

BanjoKazooie,34pa2i,STierGamefreak,8,Sun May 3 08:27:32 2015 UTC,"I always found that opening section of Nuts & Bolts weird. I can't tell if it's the result of members of the Banjo team being subtly bitter for having to go the route they did or not. Like if L.O.G. was some kind of personification of the pressures they had to turn Banjo into what he was in Nuts & Bolts, it's just weird how his dialogue specifically seemed to be designed to anger off old fans.  But, it's also very Rare kind of humor to poke fun at themselves, their choices, and the players all at the same time. Something just seemed so particularly bitter about it to me. ""You want your moves? HAH. OK. You want to collect things? Eeeeeh kinda."""

BanjoKazooie,34pa2i,redpenquin,2,Sun May 3 12:24:09 2015 UTC,"The people who fund kickstarter aren't always a very good indication of the actual market.   Let's look at another niche, specific game as an example: Shovel Knight. A very retro, kinda hard side-scrolling platformer game very similar to the classic Mega Man games. While the kickstarter had 14,749 backers who raised a little over $311k, it went on to sell over 300,000 copies across all systems by the end of 2014. Assuming each of those sales were unique to a single person, that's over 20 times the people who bothered with the kickstarter.  Now, will Yooka-Laylee turn around and be in a similar situation and have 20x the original investors (which at this rate, would probably end up being a little over 700,000 people) buy into the finished product? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. In the end, what I do know is there is a sizable market for this-- a lot more than just ""~100,000"" as you put it."
BanjoKazooie,34pa2i,PlayerTP,3,Sun May 3 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"Platformers are a staple in the food pyramid of gaming. If only a few people still loved playing platformers, Nintendo would've died a long time ago.   People never stopped buying them, developers just stopped making them. Look at Naughty Dog. Jak and Daxter/ Crash Bandicoot is what made people pay attention to their games. As technology crossed into the HD generation, devs wanted to explore powerful software, making games as realistic as possible. Unfortunately for platformers, they don't work well with a realistic human beings in a detailed realistic environment.   But realism is nearly as far as it can go, so I think platformers like this will come back eventually in full force."

On a different tract has been pointed out Nintendo has been one of the few companies to continue making this kind of game in recent years, and still make profit, so there is some opportunity to open the market up a bit.   Really it depends on if they can maintain the level of hype they have at the moment, which they probably can't unless the game improves in all areas beyond what we have seen thusfar.

I also like how Laylee rolls Yooka to traverse the environment faster. The dry British humor also seems to be in tact, which is great to see.  Somehow I doubt this will make it in time for October 2016 though. I feel like a lot of people on Kickstarter promise early release dates so people feel compelled to fund it. I wouldn't be surprised if it took a year longer than they say. Regardless though, I'm just happy something's finally being worked on by the old team."

Meanwhile we have Project Ukulele to fill that void :) With amazing Grant Kirkhope and Chris Sullivan and the rest of the team.

I'm in the process of starting up my own YouTube channel and this is something I'm thinking about all the time :P"
BanjoKazooie,3441s8,Deadpoolbub,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:25:42 2015 UTC,"I can't watch the video yet (@work), but here's my opinion. I'm different from much of the Rare fan base as I found Rare through Xbox (& Jontron). I didn't really play games much until I was 13 and got my Xbox 360, so I missed out on the N64 (I had a GBA/PS2 but only used them for licensed games). So I don't harbor the Xbox hate a lot of you guys do.  But I do have to admit the MS/Rare team-up has been less than satisfactory. I think they did alright before Kinect showed up, but Kinect sort of fucked up all of the 360. Pre-360 you had tons of cool exclusives like Crackdown, Viva Piñata, Alan Wake & then after it all the 360 was was Halo/Gears/Forza or Kinect shovel ware.  Now that the people behind Kinect are out (& so is the Kinect for the most part), I think things are gonna turn up for Rare. Especially with Phil Spencer in power, he's said a couple times recently that he's very fond of Nintendo & their use of IPs. He seems to be trying to finally give Xbox a large library of exclusive regularly appearing IPs; it only makes sense that'd they look to the Rare franchises they own to help with this, especially since they were once apart of The company Phil respects. We've already seen Killer Instinct become a hit & it appears that Battletoads in on the way too. I think MS is finally going to make good use of the Rare purchase.   TLDR; Phil Spencer will save Rare/Xbox."
BanjoKazooie,3441s8,jdmoser,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:31:52 2015 UTC,In the video I mention Phil Spencer and how I feel he has turned things around for the better. I feel he is truly a gamer at heart and wants what's best for gamers.

BanjoKazooie,3441s8,tiptuppington,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with mostly everything. Great video, thanks for sharing your thoughts :D  What I'd point out is that I'm not necessarily sure Rare has to leave Microsoft. They just need to be allowed the freedom they used to have. The reason being, the alternative of them leaving to become either independent (which is what I would like) or to rejoin Nintendo, is under the assumption that they get to keep their IPs, or some of their IPs. And I'm not sure that would happen. I suspect it would go down like the Bungie situation: Bungie got to divorce Microsoft, but they didn't get to keep Halo.  And like you said, there's very little remaining of the actual Rare staff that brought us those golden era games.... so at this point I'm not sure what we're left with given an independent or Nintendo-partnered Rare. Although if I had to counterpoint that, Gregg Mayles is still there and has risen in the ranks since Tim and Chris left. I would most certainly have faith in his ability to make some amazing shit ;D I think we all obviously love him forever for designing Banjo-Kazooie (Gregg, if you're snooping, we still love you).  Secondly, on the part of Microsoft, I'm feeling a LOT better since Don Mattrick left and Phil Spencer took over. This guy seems to get it. Most importantly, he seems to get what Rare is capable of. And I think he's clearly on the side of gamers with his recent tweet about allowing Banjo and Kazooie in the next Smash Bros.  I would wholeheartedly agree that Microsoft has abused/neglected Rare. But Phil's promotion is still relatively recent, and our still-current shaky relationship with Rare is a result of old management. I say let's give this some time :)  For the first time in years I'm actually feeling quite hopeful for the Rare/Microsoft partnership."
BanjoKazooie,343cdn,TFresh1499,7,Mon Apr 27 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"Minimalist run? Try and complete the game with only the bare minimum notes/jiggies, as well as not increasing your health pool. This includes the bonus note doors/bonus puzzle at the very end shortly before Grunty's boss fight area. I don't know how possible Gruntilda is to beat with next to no health, but I'm sure you'll find out for us ;)"

BanjoKazooie,33ymvc,BanjoKazooieManiac,19,Sun Apr 26 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"This is the least believable rumour out of them all since the bandwagon started in October 2014.

I kinda have reason to believe Rare actually is working on something Banjo related.  From Phil Spencer wanting to see Rare return to the glory days, to the Playtonic guys claiming they know what Rare's up to and we'll be pleased with it...  I dunno. Again, remain cautious, but optimistic :)"
BanjoKazooie,33ymvc,Wazzok1,2,Mon Apr 27 05:25:46 2015 UTC,"I still believe that there'll be something at E3, the amount of rumours has risen; we didn't get this much last year, or in 2013, etc. I believe in either one of these all we got was a fake picture of a logo."
BanjoKazooie,33ymvc,jdmoser,5,Mon Apr 27 05:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah... there's an unusual surge in Banjo rumors. Could all be because of Playtonic and the unexpected hype that blew up around Ukulele, of course :D  At the very least, Ukulele is an absolute. So we really don't have anything to lose, haha."

BanjoKazooie,33ymvc,Deadpoolbub,2,Mon Apr 27 00:33:39 2015 UTC,"This would've been believable if it was set for release in 2016. I still think Banjo 3 is being announced at E3, but not for a 2015 release date.  MS seems to have found a nice thing going where they have an exclusive shooter, racer & adventure game each fall. Last year was Halo: MCC, Forza Horizon 2 & Sunset Overdive; while this year's is Halo 5, Forza 6 & Tomb Raider. 2016 could have Gears of War (either a remake of 1 or Gears 4), Banjo 3 & either a Forza or Project Gotham Racing.  I know MS has said this will be a special year for Rare, but I'm thinking that's for the announcement of Banjo & announcements/releases of KI season 3/Battletoads."
BanjoKazooie,33ymvc,Deadpoolbub,3,Mon Apr 27 00:48:34 2015 UTC,That wasn't actually Gears 4.

BanjoKazooie,32beuu,AtrumDelorox,-1,Mon Apr 13 02:53:21 2015 UTC,a fad that just started a couple days ago about litterally having a chicken on your shoulder when taking a selfie. that's it lol
BanjoKazooie,328wh1,UnknownJ25,4,Sat Apr 11 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is my least favourite artwork Omni has done- it doesn't look like it would fool everyone including Nintendo as the Rayman art and Shovel Knight art did. Granted, it's experimental, but Sean Hicks' render was much better in my opinion. I still love the artwork, it gives me hope for a Banjo-Kazooie appearance on Smash, or a new game, or anything, really. (Except Nuts & Bolts 2)"
BanjoKazooie,328wh1,Wazzok1,3,Sat Apr 11 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"And the tuft of hair, and the bag wasn't done in detail- Omni went as far as putting textures on Rayman's shoelaces, but doesn't do the same for Banjo's backpack, nose, claws, and didn't put minute details on his shark tooth necklace, as I would have expected from watching his other videos. Of course, he didn't need to, but he has done in the past, so why not do it now?"
BanjoKazooie,328wh1,Wazzok1,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they are slightly crossed. With the hand on the forehead, he implies that he's looking a far away place, but the direction of his eyes makes it seem like he's looking at a near point, like his own nose. So it  may seem uncanny."

BanjoKazooie,324auw,Vok250,-5,Fri Apr 10 17:09:54 2015 UTC,they would have to buy back the rights. I highly doubt Micro$oft is going to let that happen for a reasonable price.
BanjoKazooie,324auw,Vok250,18,Fri Apr 10 14:32:11 2015 UTC,Phil Spencer himself said he is interested in Banjo being in Smash.
BanjoKazooie,324auw,Vok250,3,Fri Apr 10 14:40:40 2015 UTC,source? It would certainly help MS revive the brand image. This would be good news all around.

BanjoKazooie,32076i,ilovegoogleglass,9,Thu Apr 9 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"Haha man that final smash is great, if banjo kazooie gets into smash 4 I don't know what I will do, my body is not ready."
BanjoKazooie,32076i,DuncanDonuts32,7,Thu Apr 9 18:07:55 2015 UTC,I feel like Banjo has too many good potential final smashes to make his what looks like a clone of Yoshi's final smash.
BanjoKazooie,32076i,BagOfShenanigans,6,Thu Apr 9 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that was really my only gripe. I think the general consensus is that Jinjonator would be the best Final Smash."
BanjoKazooie,32076i,gordonabishop,11,Fri Apr 10 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"The taunts are all fantastic, especially the one with Mumbo. Part of me thinks it would cool if they were like Sheik and Zelda where you could switch between them but it wouldn't be the same."
BanjoKazooie,32076i,BanjoismyHomeboy,5,Thu Apr 9 18:05:55 2015 UTC,They have removed that ability in smash4 mostly due to 3ds hardware limitations.
BanjoKazooie,32076i,stormandbliss,4,Thu Apr 9 22:35:32 2015 UTC,Thats news to me. Of course I haven't played a smash game since brawl so I'm not really up to speed on that.
BanjoKazooie,32076i,BanjoismyHomeboy,3,Thu Apr 9 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"Yup, sadly it also resulted in the loss of the Ice Climbers :(  But it allowed for 8 player smash on the wiiu which is pretty cool."
BanjoKazooie,32076i,stormandbliss,2,Thu Apr 9 22:59:19 2015 UTC,lol I have rather mixed feelings about the ice climbers haha. 8 person smash sounds ridiculous though. I guess I need to make seven friends and buy a 3ds.
BanjoKazooie,32076i,BanjoismyHomeboy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"8 Player only works on the WiiU though, 3DS is still 1-4 player, the processing power isn't there.  It is ridiculous though :p"
BanjoKazooie,32076i,stormandbliss,4,Fri Apr 10 04:09:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly disappointed that none of the taunts involve Banjo playing the banjo.  Other than that, it's great."

BanjoKazooie,32076i,stormandbliss,2,Thu Apr 9 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"Up Pose: Banjo-Playin' Banjo with Kazooie sticking out of his bag, waving her wings back and forth.  Right Pose: Banjo gives a thumbs-up with Kazooie pecking at Banjo's head and laughing every few seconds.  Down Pose: As the announcer exclaims ""THE WINNER IS..."" Banjo runs around with Kazooie flying in the air. Kazooie does a flip in the air and lands in Banjo's bag. Kazooie then pops out, then just as the announcer says ""BANJO AND KAZOOIE"" they pose together."

BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,sunderstormer,4,Tue Apr 7 14:13:26 2015 UTC,No I'm with you. An animated film would do nothing but damage the franchise.
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,AwesomePossum5,5,Tue Apr 7 14:24:25 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Though I do think if Banjo ever made it to the big screen, the team behind Wreck-it Ralph would probably be the best fit."
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,a-martini,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"Well, unless I'm very mistaken, that was Disney. So I assume the same animation studio would be in charge of this potential film."
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,ME_REDDITOR,5,Wed Apr 8 21:28:07 2015 UTC,Banjo returning on Xbox  Banjo for Super Smash Bros  and now THIS???!  Too good to be true...
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,Darth_Dio,4,Tue Apr 7 12:39:45 2015 UTC,"Unless the dialogue does as:   ""guh-huh, huh, guh-huh, huh, huh, guh-huh?""   ""Blat-lal-lat-lal-lat-lat""   ""Re-ha, re re re ha, ha re, re ha... NYEE-HAHAHAHHA""   along with subtitles, then that movie is just gonna suck cock"
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,rs71,3,Wed Apr 8 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no. This isn't happening. Why would they make a movie about Banjo-Kazooie, a series with 5 games, and hasn't been seen since 2008?  I'm all for a new game, or Smash Bros. DLC, but a movie just sounds terrible. There's not enough story for 2 hours."
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,Wazzok1,2,Tue Apr 7 17:42:23 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I think this is just another rumor that was sent out due to all the recent Banjo-Kazooie news (Microsoft demo, Project Ukelele, Supposed Microsoft member saying there will be a new Banjo game, Smash DLC, etc). I don't think this is true. Why would a huge company like Disney make a movie about such a small video game like Banjo-Kazooie? Don't get me wrong, millions of people know B-K, but the majority of the Disney audience won't know."
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,KnucklesCR,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:30:33 2015 UTC,I wonder where they would go with this. Maybe an origin story? I think a film surrounding the first game would be ideal. Surely Gruntilda would be the antagonist.
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,SilverxPacker,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:16:10 2015 UTC,They are making a Ratchet and Clank film like that so why not?
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,Legionaryprime,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:26:44 2015 UTC,Yeah but the newer Ratchet and Clank games looked and felt like movies anyway (not a bad thing);
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,SpecialU,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:55:12 2015 UTC,"Depending on the success of the Ratchet and Clank movie, I could see this as becoming a possibility."
BanjoKazooie,31pcpl,brainfreeze91,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:38:52 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that would really like this? A movie based on my favorite childhood game done by the Wreck It Ralph team could be fantastic. I think the game has enough wit for a 2 hour movie and the story can be easily fleshed out. Plus all the memorable characters could easily make an entertaining movie. I'd watch it.

BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,gsmumbo,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:39:38 2015 UTC,First thing I thought of was the Jinjonator too lol
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,MrBoobieBuyer,11,Mon Apr 6 03:06:32 2015 UTC,Pretty good list except the Final Smash. Donkey Kong's is the absolute worst and the rhythm based mechanic doesn't make sense for the bear and bird. I think a better Final Smash would be either the Jinjonator or Mumbo turning them into the giant T-Rex.
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,MrBoobieBuyer,4,Tue Apr 7 09:51:01 2015 UTC,Well I figured it would be musical but not in the way that you'd have to hit notes or anything it'd just be really a radius attack. The T-Rex would be awesome too :)
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,pyarsa1,3,Mon Apr 6 04:59:57 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see what you meant now. That actually would be a pretty sweet Final Smash. The dragonfly and the bull would have to make an appearance though!"
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,Wazzok1,2,Mon Apr 6 05:08:36 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely! They could run across the screen and do damage even!
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,sargentsuicide,6,Mon Apr 6 06:07:22 2015 UTC,"Dude! I can almost see this become real, I hope they get BK for the game."

BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,sargentsuicide,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's not on votes, but whether or not the developers think the character is a good idea/eligible for the game; which is why Goku, as many votes as he'll get, will not be in the game."
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,sargentsuicide,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:05:46 2015 UTC,No I know that but it'll help with Banjo getting noticed by the devs at least :)
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,agentx221,4,Mon Apr 6 19:12:23 2015 UTC,I love this and the idea of banjo being in smash. The only way it could get better is if they also released an amiibo with him.
BanjoKazooie,31ku7q,thestinkyrat1,5,Mon Apr 6 19:56:34 2015 UTC,Oh man I would love an amiibo like this: http://i.imgur.com/pFqu0AZ.jpg

I selected ""Overlay"" on the paintbrush settings, and the image editing software I use is GIMP 2."
BanjoKazooie,31i9fn,Wazzok1,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:43:38 2015 UTC,How did you make it look HD like?

BanjoKazooie,314lp1,Wizaldo,14,Wed Apr 1 23:28:08 2015 UTC,I came to the sub as soon as I knew about the voting. We NEED to make noise. We need to cause an impression and wake those guys at Nintendo. Show them how expressive is this fanbase. If we could call their attention it would be enought for me but maybe we could get something more and thats enough for making it worth a try.
BanjoKazooie,314lp1,Feamsu,5,Thu Apr 2 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, chances probably aren't great, but I'm willing to risk my vote for it to happen."
BanjoKazooie,314lp1,Feamsu,8,Thu Apr 2 00:05:09 2015 UTC,"However, it seems like it would be a good move to do so IF Rare is planning on releasing a new Banjo-Kazooie. It's more publicity for them and a good demographic target as well."
BanjoKazooie,314lp1,Feamsu,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"Tons of moves, loyal fanbase since Nintendo 64. Every fan of the franchise would buy the game and the console. Solid Snake and Sonic didn't belong to Nintendo and were in the game, Banjo is not impossible. Let's try at least."

Microsoft completely owns the rights to all Rare properties. Even if they had a good reason to lend Nintendo the rights for them, Nintendo has no interest in using one of it's strongest IPs to market one of their main competitor's franchises."
BanjoKazooie,314lp1,joebillybob,3,Fri Apr 3 22:24:12 2015 UTC,Sigh... Can't Nintendo just purchase Rareware's IPs?

He bought it for me and I played that game on and off until my mom sold my n64 when i was about 14. A few years later I bought an N64, B-K, and B-T at my local flea market for about $10. So I have been playing Banjo almost my whole life.  I can't remember how old I was when I saw the 'bear and bird are back' Nuts and Bolts commercial. I bought a 360 for that game.

I was 8 and I was in a gamestore (in 2008) and I saw N&B on the shelf, I bought it and I liked it, then my friend told me about some sort of DLC, so I went looking for it on the Xbox Live Arcade, and I found Banjo Kazooie, so I installed the demo, and realized how shit N&B was in comparison, and then I got Banjo Tooie after beating (AKA getting stumped in Bubblegloop Swamp) Banjo Kazooie, the zombie king jinjo guy freaked my sister out so I had to uninstall it, a few years later I saw it at a retro game store with an N64 for 50 euro, I had my birthday money and bought it again after my sister got over her fear of king jingo-guy"

Known theme for each one you've seen?  Interconnected worlds(tooie) or separated(kazooie)?  Known mumbo transformation?  Type and number of collectables encountered in each world?

There was a desert-themed level, forest-themed, a western-themed level (I'm talking John Wayne western.), a world that is hard to explain, it was really colorful. I would describe it as cloud cuckoo land on acid, and there was a very open winter-themed world.  3.) The inter connectivity is very interesting. There are no loading 'entrances'. You just walk up to a world now. (I guess they aren't even separate worlds now, just one large world.) It is completely open like the first Jak game.   4.) Humba does those.

I still take these rumours with a pinch of salt, and with the hint from a credible leaker on NeoGaf last year, PlaytonicGames hinting at their knowledge of something, a member of staff in a high position hinting at an old classic returning, I'm open more than ever to a real, tangible leak.  Please provide a screenshot of any of the levels you have described or a quick picture of the new Banjo design. Blurry potato quality or fully HD Nikon SLR camera quality. We don't care.

BanjoKazooie,30h5j7,ToonElectrocrash,4,Fri Mar 27 15:18:57 2015 UTC,I would definitely buy an Xbox One if it was the only means to playing the new (if there will be one) Banjo game.    Just like I'm waiting for a new Paper Mario game before I buy the Wii-U.  Hopefully they'll announce something soon!

As for the Conker game, there's project.   I wouldn't even be mad if there was a second nuts n bolts, I 100%d it and found it fun.   Playtonic is also in collaboration with Rare, they had good things to say about their upcoming projects as well. Perhaps this post does check out, but there's no solid evidence. And it would be pretty obvious that you would be caught because how many employees on 343 finished their part in the game and flew back to Washington state?"

And it totally fits Microsoft's methods to assign people or teams to something they are not use to. But then again maybe he is working at Rare and just wants to divert suspicion....  -People from Playtonic also said that Banjo fans would be happy with what Rare are mking right now.  -He mentions both good things and thing that could be seen as a step back instead of describing the game as too perfect....  I just hope that if its true, Microsoft will have one of their random PC-supportive mood swings at the time of the release....."

Our generation of Banjo-loving gamers has been jerked around enough, right? Please give us more credibility, or don't share at all. :("
BanjoKazooie,30h5j7,HaikusfromBuddha,2,Wed Apr 1 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"This was more of a fan made project, so it wouldn't necessarily reflect how Banjo may or may not be looking these days. And even if it was a Microsoft lead project, they probably wouldn't be using brand new assets for a tiny little one off thing like that. It would instantly tip everyone off to a new Banjo game :P"
BanjoKazooie,30cxzn,GuyOutsideYourWindow,9,Thu Mar 26 10:36:45 2015 UTC,If your playing the original thats just how it goes you have to collect them all in one run otherwise it only saves your highest amount collected
BanjoKazooie,30cxzn,zacman2244,8,Thu Mar 26 11:02:47 2015 UTC,"The original N64 version only saves the Highest Note Score - if you leave the world or die, only the highest number of notes is saved. So if you want to open more Note Doors, you'll have to revisit old worlds, collect more notes than before, and then leave. Collecting all 100 notes in a world as soon as you can is always a good idea. Happy hunting!"
BanjoKazooie,30cxzn,GildasMagnus,2,Thu Mar 26 12:21:50 2015 UTC,thank you

BanjoKazooie,301r1a,Wazzok1,3,Mon Mar 23 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"Or a Banjo Kazooie ""remix"" game with a different universe and setting, sorta like how Nintendo did Super Mario Sunshine with different gameplay and abilities. I'm pretty positive it might be something like this. Banjo has the potentiality to be Mario. The question is what's the universe? :)   My take is, the core collecting aspect of Banjo Kazooie will be in there but it will turn into an actual gameplay mechanic where you beat enemies. How does this sound?"
BanjoKazooie,301r1a,mrbstro,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:54:42 2015 UTC,different gameplay and abilities   But Rare already did that.

BanjoKazooie,301r1a,lud1120,4,Tue Mar 24 07:22:30 2015 UTC,"On the subject of old Rare, the popular story is that when Microsoft took control of the studio, it restricted the team’s creativity, and insisted on a more corporate approach, killing the unique atmosphere. Playtonic denies this.  “For me, it was more about [Rare founders] Tim and Chris Stamper leaving,” says Playtonic technical director Jens Restemeier,    They even denied the popular claims saying that Microsoft murdered Rare. I think its safe to say that Microsoft gave them the freedom and creativity they wanted."

The TLDR version is that collaboration may include cameos of a certain bear and bird in Playtonic games, and vice versa. Even that is very early to speculate on.

BanjoKazooie,2zfw7t,Banjo1812,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"I was super hyped for this game before it came out. I remember going into a Hollywood Video Game Crazy in 2007 and asked the guy there if ""Banjo-Threeie"" was out. He had no idea what I was talking about and I left a bit disappointed. When the demo for N&B was released on the xbox like arcade I was off the wall happy. I remember playing the demo and glitching out of the boundaries to see the whole overworld. When I finally got the game I played it to completion and as a fan of the originals, N&B left a bad taste in my mouth. I felt betrayed almost. The potential for a beautiful Banjo Kazooie game was sitting right in front of me, but it just wasn't what I had wanted. I resented the game for a while, but I now realize what N&B actually is. My theory is that some BK fanboy game developers were tasked with creating Banjo Threeie for the xbox 360 and when they just about had the game completed some Microsoft dev's threatened to pull the plug on the whole project because, ""kids these days just want to shoot things"". So these game dev's who wanted to see Banjo and Kazooie have a shot at being part of a new generation of games found a way to get the Microsoft cronies interested in the BK IP. They expanded the levels and incorporated lego cars with the havoc engine. Afterall, the first game Banjo was in was Diddy Kong racing, so it sort of held some of Banjo's grassroots along with a dash of 3d platforming. It feels like L.O.G is Rare's way of passive aggressively adding microsoft to the game. Resenting them for putting them in the position that they did but also trying really hard to stay true to Banjo. This is all just my speculation, but it is my way of coping with what could have been. I would love to see a dev team come together and mod N&B to be Banjo Threeie. I'm sure microsoft wouldn't be as lenient as nintendo has been about Project M, but it is worth a shot. Please, someone, redeem this game. Modify it so that it can be what we all wanted, what we all want, what we all crave. Project Banjo Threeie."

I've always loved the soundtrack, though. LOGBox 720 was really damn fun to listen to.  Banjoland takes the cake though. You can imagine this being played live at a videogame concert and having everyone lose their mind at how perfect it is."

BanjoKazooie,2z8z06,Nickthegreat,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"Probably just a few more hours, so jump on this."
BanjoKazooie,2z6w5q,KnucklesCR,5,Mon Mar 16 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"Try messaging the mods, even though I'm sure they'll see this."
BanjoKazooie,2z6w5q,SilverxPacker,3,Mon Mar 16 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"Somebody made some a while back, and a mod said they'd implement them, but never did. Weird."
BanjoKazooie,2z6w5q,The_Homestarmy,2,Mon Mar 16 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"Mod here. I meant to implement flair a while back but got busy and honestly just forgot. :( I may have time this week to work on it, but if you're interested in helping us out just shoot us a message and I'll see what we can do!"
BanjoKazooie,2z6w5q,a-martini,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:50:19 2015 UTC,I messaged.  :)
BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,korrt106,10,Mon Mar 16 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"We have a concrete history we can see with Microsoft. They did not do service to Banjo in his recent iteration of Nuts & Bolts. And now there is footage... of a Kinect minigame. They did say it was a tech demo, but it doesn't exactly give the impression that they have yet figured out how to properly handle their IP. So it is understandable that there is absolutely ZERO hype surrounding it, as we already have skepticism that Microsoft will do anything noteworthy at all.  Project Ukulele, however, has a LOT more hope surrounding it. The original Rare developers are involved, and they do NOT have a history of disservice to Banjo, but rather they created him. So it makes sense that Banjo fans would be more excited about their offering than Microsoft's.  I suppose Banjo fans are more attached to the experience it provides rather than the Banjo IP itself. I'm seeing a similar parallel with Mega Man and Mighty No 9."
BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,brainfreeze91,2,Mon Mar 16 18:21:59 2015 UTC,Very well said.
BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,MrBoobieBuyer,13,Tue Mar 17 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"If Microsoft would quit dancing around and announce an actual Banjo game, there might be more discussion. I think I speak for everyone when I say no one wants a Kinect enabled Banjo game. The devs of Project Ukulele are members of the old Banjo team, so we know they're capable of making a great fucking game and are keen on reviving that experience.   Would I prefer an actual Banjo game to Project Ukulele? Of course I would, but I just don't see that happening."
BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,wrewlf,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:30:45 2015 UTC,Well said
BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,RenobMan,2,Mon Mar 23 10:23:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. I am surprised there is so much about project urkle... Its a ""spiritual"" successor which really isnt related to banjo kazooie.  I come to this thread to find news about a next banjo or posts about the games not to read about a game that isnt at all banjo kazooie but is just sort of like it"
BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,ToonElectrocrash,2,Tue Mar 17 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"IMO, I wish Nintendo still had Rareware. Maybe Nintendo can purchase Rareware?  I'm a fan of Banjo-Kazooie and Nintendo. I am definitely not a fan of Xbox. I hate Xbox.  Project Ukulele is being made by Playtonic, which is made up of ex-Rare employees and they really want Ukulele to be on Wii U. I hope PU'll be a Wii U exclusive as well as an awesome game, and I also wish Microsoft never meddled with Rareware and Nintendo."

BanjoKazooie,2z6ynb,SM64Guy,8,Mon Mar 16 06:03:11 2015 UTC,Kinda like this?
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,ilovegoogleglass,15,Sun Mar 15 01:00:06 2015 UTC,We deserve better than this...right?
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,SilverxPacker,11,Sun Mar 15 01:01:42 2015 UTC,Absolutely. That's why Project Ukulele exists.
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,JustaPumpkin,8,Sun Mar 15 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"Holy christ, let's keep this concept as a fan creation only. I'll be significantly miffed if the next Banjo title is some Kinect horse shit."
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,Man_Of_Spiders,7,Sun Mar 15 01:57:14 2015 UTC,OOOOOH NOOOOOOOOOOO
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,Saeka,3,Sun Mar 15 05:13:39 2015 UTC,I really hope this isn't going to be the next banjo game.
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,lizardman301,3,Sun Mar 15 15:03:08 2015 UTC,Just sell Banjo to playtonic games and keep making stupid kinect games
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,sapi3nce,2,Mon Mar 16 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"for the love of all things holy, Microsoft please keep this as a tech demo"
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,rs71,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:08:12 2015 UTC,I got to play this at the awards. Glitchy as fuck (or everyone in the audience sucks at moving their arms).
BanjoKazooie,2z2sa1,Eversist,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope Microsoft and Rare aren't hopping on the Kinect-style Banjo train, because no one really wants that... (not trying to complain, but it's pretty obvious. Why do they like Kinect so much anyways? lol).  It seems like Banjo fans are more excited for Project Ukulele than this!"
BanjoKazooie,2z1bkg,ilovegoogleglass,6,Sat Mar 14 17:29:54 2015 UTC,If you look on the left of the bushes you can see the main protagonist.
BanjoKazooie,2z1bkg,GruberHof,2,Sat Mar 14 20:51:00 2015 UTC,Am I looking at a different picture? It's not there for me :/
BanjoKazooie,2z1bkg,korrt106,-1,Tue Mar 17 07:44:54 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that's not the main protagonist(s).
BanjoKazooie,2z1bkg,Ergonomic_Prosterior,2,Sun Mar 15 17:22:13 2015 UTC,That's literally the same shape of the protagonist. Did you look at the increased brightness photo?
BanjoKazooie,2z1bkg,GruberHof,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:10:44 2015 UTC,Looks great
BanjoKazooie,2z1eke,ilovegoogleglass,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:54:39 2015 UTC,um I think whoever wrote that article photoshopped that in because I don't see it in the original.  A chameleon would be cool though!
BanjoKazooie,2z1eke,sapi3nce,5,Sat Mar 14 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"No, he didn't. At around 34 minutes into the stream of the presentation, the characters were in it. In the higher res version they uploaded later, the characters were taken out."
BanjoKazooie,2z1eke,chrislenz,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:01:24 2015 UTC,^ This.  I wish my Photoshop skills were that good though!
BanjoKazooie,2z1eke,mathewd3,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"awesome, I didn't know where the stream was so thanks!!  hehe."
BanjoKazooie,2z1eke,sapi3nce,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:24:23 2015 UTC,I know they don't want to reveal the characters yet... But the 2 pictures we've seen of the characters has them hiding. My guess is this game will be called metal gear banjo

BanjoKazooie,2z2qse,nottheboynextdoor,5,Sun Mar 15 00:50:34 2015 UTC,I don't understand why Microsoft would let this demo thing ever be seen by the public. It's pretty much guaranteed to provoke a negative reaction from most people. You don't bring a beloved character out of retirement for something like this.
