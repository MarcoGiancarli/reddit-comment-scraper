ComicWalls,3dzr48,nerfAvari,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"healing brush tool actually  I selected the left border cloud part as the source, then gradually filled in the top section.

ComicWalls,3dzr48,OperationQuip,2,Mon Jul 20 23:34:50 2015 UTC,Oh nice. Healing tool I rarely used before. Guess I'll be testing it out in the future
ComicWalls,3dzr48,nerfAvari,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"Its perfect for the kind of big areas that would otherwise be difficult to replicate by hand  it works similarly to the clone stamp, as it will transfer subtle textures. it doesn't work so well with solid looking objects, or near a sudden change in color - like a border (it blends)  its weird getting used to all its quirks, but once you do it makes lots of things so much easier"

I know it isn't necessarily aimed at kids, but kids will still be reading it and seeing this (awesome) image. It's one thing for Hellblazer to be smoking on the cover of his book. In no way has he ever been a role model for children. Batman is. And of course the cigarette is kind of Jim Gordon's thing, and it looks totally bad-ass drawn by Capullo. It's just (and I'm sure they touch on it in the book itself), even if it isn't Bruce, it's still Batman smoking."

ComicWalls,3ckpj7,OperationQuip,2,Thu Jul 9 06:10:11 2015 UTC,"Well I meant it in the sense that the comics would take place in the era where the characters were created.   For Spidey it'd be 1962, for Fantastic Four it'd be 1961, and so on and so forth.   Not necessarily the artwork."

ComicWalls,3cgxtu,TNT91ca,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:06:54 2015 UTC,This is a different book than the one you are thinking of. JLA is a separate story line from Geoff Johns and Jason Fabok's 'Justice League'. You can catch more of Fabok's art in the current Darkseid War arc starting with issue 41.
ComicWalls,3cgxtu,Vanish_7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"Oh...wow.  Thank god.    I guess I don't understand the reason for this JLA book then -- Superman and WW aren't in their current outfits and I'm still immensely confused by Hal's return to earth as a Green Lantern.  He's on the run from the corps right now, right?"
ComicWalls,3cgxtu,TNT91ca,2,Wed Jul 8 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah things are pretty mixed up in the solo books right now, but DC said they were focusing less on continuity and more on story going forward. So you will see a familiar Superman in JL because I think they are taking place before the new character changes.   Here is an interview where Jim Lee and Dan DiDio talk about the new books and continuity: http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/lee-didio-call-june-launches-first-of-many-steps-in-building-the-new-dc-comics"
ComicWalls,3cgxtu,Vanish_7,3,Wed Jul 8 15:31:02 2015 UTC,Hmm...that was an interesting read.  Seems to me that they got tired of everything being so deeply connected with the other titles.

ComicWalls,3bpawe,TheAnig,8,Wed Jul 1 07:09:03 2015 UTC,I never understood why Spiderman was so critical to that story.
ComicWalls,3bpawe,FriendsCallMeBatman,11,Wed Jul 1 09:13:47 2015 UTC,"ero ""on the fence"" between the sides whichever aide he chooses will inspire a lot of more minor heroes either way too.   It's worth noting that in the Comic, Spider-man values his secret identity more than most. Even among X-Men, Fantastic Four, Avengers -- he'd retain his secret except for the selected few (by choice or not). On top of valuing his secret identity, he is also one of the most ""misunderstood"" heroes in public eyes -- many other superheroes recognize this and respect him wholly (as long as they can overlook his mouth)  So for him to be on the fence over the Superheroes registration act is titular. However, how will this story be translated into the movie -- not sure because there was no indication of government issues toward Avengers or even a fact that there is a culture of superheroes around other than the Avengers...(didn't watch Shield or Agent Carter so my point could get refuted..)  I'm thinking the core of Civil War will center around the ethic of protecting the people and how far one would/should/could go. Whether the protection should be government-led (Iron Man) or independently-run (Captain America)  Then throw in Spider-Man who has been a lone hero desperate for recognition and appreciation (siding with Iron Man) but still understand and values and the responsibility laid before him (siding with Captain America).  Should be a good movie..."
ComicWalls,3bpawe,TmoodReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:01:18 2015 UTC,Amazing. Thank you. I don't read a lot of the ol' Wall Crawler. I was more focused on the Thor Story.
ComicWalls,3bpawe,FriendsCallMeBatman,12,Thu Jul 2 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"Well, for a start he was one of the first heroes to reveal themselves publically."
ComicWalls,3bpawe,Frisbeeman,5,Wed Jul 1 09:33:48 2015 UTC,Any idea about the context of the picture?
ComicWalls,3bpawe,Cpt_Waffle,6,Wed Jul 1 09:54:20 2015 UTC,Iron man and Cap fighting over him to get him on their side as Peter is pretty much sat on the fence for quite a bit of Civil War. Plus he does end up going through a whole lot of shit later on. Not sure if it'll all happen in the movie though such as the encounter with Green Goblin
ComicWalls,3bpawe,Antlered_Ostrich,9,Wed Jul 1 10:18:29 2015 UTC,"Also because he's such a high-profile hero ""on the fence"" between the sides whichever aide he chooses will inspire a lot of more minor heroes either way too."
ComicWalls,3bpawe,slaya45,3,Wed Jul 1 12:09:24 2015 UTC,This is a fan made wallpaper. It's not official.
ComicWalls,3bpawe,urhero,3,Wed Jul 1 17:10:04 2015 UTC,Way to ruin the dream..
ComicWalls,3bpawe,dct2209,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:09:24 2015 UTC,Yep fan made. Good but not official marvel
ComicWalls,3bpawe,nerfAvari,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:54:08 2015 UTC,This has been selected for Wall of the Week!
ComicWalls,3bpj92,rajnshelat,6,Wed Jul 1 02:56:28 2015 UTC,bang bang  made more sense to just get rid of the blue rock things then to try and reconstruct them
ComicWalls,3bpj92,OperationQuip,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:55:08 2015 UTC,thanks a lot!!!
ComicWalls,3bpj92,OperationQuip,2,Wed Jul 1 04:02:12 2015 UTC,sure thing!
ComicWalls,3bkir6,Hooker_DeWitt,20,Mon Jun 29 23:39:06 2015 UTC,That's Ikari for the curious.
ComicWalls,3bkir6,Stygian_Omada,6,Tue Jun 30 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, he's back?!? Hell yeah! I haven't read the last 8 or so issues of Daredevil but I think I will today."
ComicWalls,3bkir6,jedispyder,4,Tue Jun 30 14:15:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
ComicWalls,3bkir6,thatreallyaznguy,9,Tue Jun 30 09:58:26 2015 UTC,His introduction in Daredevil #25 was amazing. Definitely check it out.
ComicWalls,3bkir6,HowieGaming,3,Tue Jun 30 06:49:17 2015 UTC,OP said Daredevil #16. Did you type wrong or is OP wrong?
ComicWalls,3bkir6,Bedpans,7,Tue Jun 30 11:05:47 2015 UTC,I think they rebooted back in 2014? So his first appearance could've been before then.
ComicWalls,3biz93,vaderdarthvader,2,Mon Jun 29 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"As a dieheard Wolverine fan, this is freakin' amazing."
ComicWalls,3biz93,nickferatu,3,Mon Jun 29 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"As a not do diehard fan, what happened to his left hand here and what's up with the Old Man Logan love recently - I've been seeing a lot more of him on subs."
ComicWalls,3biz93,KYL0C0,3,Mon Jun 29 23:16:44 2015 UTC,I think it's Age of Apocalypse 'War'. Wolverine is one of his horsemen in that alternate universe.
ComicWalls,3biz93,DNA_Saurus,2,Tue Jun 30 00:40:02 2015 UTC,"The one handed Wolverine is from the Age of Apocalypse storyline. He and Cyclops had a bit of a scuffle, hence the missing hand.   Old Man Logan was an excellent graphic novel set in a desolate future (lots of that in the X-Men mythos, eh?). It's super bloody and violent. Perfectly captures the raw, killer aspects of Wolverine's character. It's been rebooted as a new miniseries for Marvel's current Secret War storyline and its picked right up where the previous graphic novel left off. Blood and guts galore. It's fun."

ComicWalls,3bebpu,permanent__guest,7,Sun Jun 28 22:47:06 2015 UTC,This is issue 19 of the Edmondson run with art by Mitch Gerads that is ending from Secret Wars. I really hope this team continues after Secret Wars.
