CryptoCurrency,3e14jx,ThePiachu,7,Tue Jul 21 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, problems with database replication, and dealing with what happens after a hack attempt would be easier on a private blockchain.  Streaming replication among distributed servers with automatic failover is fairly difficult to do, but a blockchain does indeed seem to solve this problem.  If someone gets into your database you can no longer trust it... you have to go to backups... with a private blockchain, a hacker would have to try to re-write history to mess with it.  My answer is that, Yes, a private blockchain could have some advantages over a regular database."
CryptoCurrency,3e14jx,Pontifier,5,Tue Jul 21 06:55:22 2015 UTC,"Been talking to people about this a lot, and the general conclusion is that the blockchain isn't that magic/special, so much as a visible example of defensive architecture. It's likely there are easier ways of having multiple independent systems checkpoint your data (which is basically what companies want to use a blockchain for), one suggestion having been to replicate, timestamp and sign the database transaction logs across multiple systems.  Mostly the whole thing feels like banking waking up to the importance of having your code fail safely (i.e. proactively search for inconsistencies, and fail dramatically if anything goes wrong)."

The intent being that at every time interval (hour, day, minute, whatever suits) you replicate the last interval's worth of transaction logs onto multiple machines, and create a cryptographic signature around those logs.  If a single copy is edited/tampered with, the signature is invalidated, and you can recover another copy. Obviously this does rely on the replication nodes being isolated from each other and ideally hard to identify (so an attacker can't easily find all of them)."

First of all, cryptoassets are not contracts by any legal sense.  If a judiciary enforces one, it will be trail-blazing precedent.  Of course the contracts are sold.  They are sold first by the issuer into circulation, and then they are sold by the asker in the market.  The sales by the issuer on a public market makes them illegal in all jurisdictions.  The United States has the freest public derivatives market, and they do not allow public marketing except through regulated exchanges.  In the case of derivatives, which are glorified liabilities, anonymity breaks them down.  In a private derivative trade, the seller is the one who sells its obligation to the buyer.  The buyer and seller predetermine margin maintenance so that neither gets screwed for a large amount.  If the trade goes against the seller, the seller has to fork over collateral to the buyer, and if the trade goes with the seller, the buyer has to return the collateral.  The complexity only increases from there.  If there's no way to know who the seller is and if its absconded with the margin, there is little to no market."

If the previous block (as Dogecoin did), what you find is miners ""look ahead"" to figure out the next block's value and switch to another coin if it's a low reward. If you use the next block, miners can find it's more profitable to abandon discovered blocks and try to find one with a better reward.  You also don't want to use an algorithm any other coins are using, because you're instantly competing with them for security. Bitcoin's miners have petahashes per second of mining power, and any sizable pool could decide your coin is becoming a pest and 51% (well really more 99.99%) your coin until it implodes. You're also going to constantly be competing with other SHA256 coins for resources, so you're essentially in a constant state of conflict. Consider Keccak or SIMD as ASIC-friendly and unfriendly alternatives perhaps.  Generally, launching a coin is harder than it looks, keeping a coin up to date is much harder than that, I'd advise against it. Also mining trends towards near perfect market efficiency, and I think we're now past the point where anyone who isn't on an industrial scale is making money."

CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,CryptoJunky,2,Sat Jul 18 15:16:05 2015 UTC,Could anyone give a quick tl;dr explanation of Dash and Monero for those of us that haven't been following them?
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,Basilpop,5,Sat Jul 18 20:58:13 2015 UTC,Monero uses ring signitures. Dash uses a coinjoin that is masternode dependent.
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,ChicagoSchooler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:15:19 2015 UTC,"Dash does not have the original flawed CoinJoin implementation. Mixing takes place before time rather than in-time which among other fixed things was the main flaw. You have a seperate wallet with an anonymized amount of coins you mix before you use them. Calling it ""dependent"" on masternodes is like trying to make bitcoin look bad because it's dependent on full nodes. Masternodes are exactly that: full nodes."
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,CaptainEntropy,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:07:47 2015 UTC,Pot calling the kettle black.
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,MoneroRacingTeam,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:14:26 2015 UTC,"not surprising considering dash offers direct competition to btc, though this comment may hinder his credibility; unless of course he has managed to successfully trace funds that have gone through 8 iterations of mixing...  outside of the anonymity, the masternode backbone has resulted in instant transactions, increased demand while generating passive income, and has yielded an innovative approach to development funding ensuring long term sustainability.  what innovation has btc produced in the last year?"
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,CaptainEntropy,4,Sat Jul 18 21:10:09 2015 UTC,8 itterations of mixing is easily broken by the fact that most masternodes are on corporate hosting sites within a few countries that are allies and would most likely hand over data to prevent or prosecute illicit data. Masternodes require humans to use best practices (they don't) and governments to not work together to stop crime or protect their interest (they do).   This is why Peter's calling it snake oil--the masternode system presumes its best interest are being maintained by humans instead of guaranteeing it with math at the protocol level.
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,MoneroRacingTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:10:51 2015 UTC,"The easier attack is buy masternodes and ddos attack competing nodes until you own the traffic. Evan claims it's financially implausible, but ignores that nodes are most profitable when there about a 1,000 masternodes (he has a ROI  graphic on the dash BCT thread that underscores this). He also ignores that the attacker would be pulling incomes from these masternodes--given that most are held on corporate servers underlies that no one knows who owns them outside of the host and the owner. He also ignores how motivated an attacker may be, that he or another masternode operator might comply given the right circumstances (threat or lawful compliance) and how deep LE's pockets are--silly, dangerous, stupid."
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,CaptainEntropy,0,Sun Jul 19 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"while unlikely, this is certainly theoretically possible and therefore it would be unreasonable to conclude the anonymity of dash is on par with cryptonote coins.  Though it would be a false assumption to say that with this increased anonymity, cryptonote coins have greater intrinsic value- due to the elimination of value derived from the public ledger, over saturation of cryptonote coins within the market, and a lack of the numerous attributes provided by the secondary network of masternodes.  any perceived threat to the anonymity of dash is unlikely to impact its fungibility; an issue btc is currently faced with and why I find peter todd's comments ridiculous as I doubt he would call btc snake oil, yet isn't this essentially what he's doing?"
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,MoneroRacingTeam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:39:07 2015 UTC,"No, he's not. Dash advertises itself as anonymous, and therefore, the claim makes it snake oil as it would lull people into a false sense of security and put them in danger. If Bitcoin claimed to be anything other than pseudonymous, you'd have a point. But since no Bitcoin Dev has ever made that claim, Peter's reputation is fine. Yours on the other hand is now of someone who makes false comparisons to insinuate that a Bitcoin Dev is as rotten as the product he's critiquing."
CryptoCurrency,3dpmah,Thefriendlyfaceplant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:56:46 2015 UTC,calling a product snake oil insinuates no verifiable benefit can be attributed to it.  If Dash marketed itself as 100% NSA-level anonymity and not as digital cash with a multitude of innovations/improvements to the digital currency model I would agree with you.

I know POS coins like Peercoin and others seek to solve this in different ways but I've yet to see a solution that I really felt addressed the problem sufficiently.

CryptoCurrency,3dogmz,changetip,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"I feel as though, for a lot of cryptocurrency users, it has become somewhat more difficult to participate in the cryptoconomy.  Let's take typical (but made up) bitcoin user Bob for instance.  Bob got into Bitcoin a couple of years ago by mining with his home gaming PC. It used to be that Bob would regularly convert his mining power and some electricity into Bitcoin.  Once stores like BitcoinStore or Bitcoinin started popping up Bob would spend some bitcoin that he earned mining at them.  However, years have passed and now Bob does not have a regular stream of Bitcoin coming in as he no longer mines. If Bob wants to buy something in Bitcoin he now has to convert his fiat currency, we'll say USD, into Bitcoin and then use the Bitcoin to buy something.  So even though Bob can now use his Bitcoin at a huge number of retailers, especially big ones like Overstock and Newegg, he no longer regularly receives Bitcoin to do it.  While it is possible to make the conversions, they require some time and effort and it is usually just easier to order something on Amazon with one click than to convert to Bitcoin and order on a Bitcoin supporting retailer.  What's more is that Bob is mostly non-technical. Sure he can setup a gaming computer but we'll say Bob isn't an accomplished developer, more of a tech enthusiast.   So what is left for Bob to do in the new cryptoconomy? He doesn't have the technical skills to develop cutting edge tech, mining is out the window as it isn't profitable, using Bitcoin while easier than it used to be is still much more difficult than fiat, and even running a full node requires him to run is power sucking gaming PC 24/7.  Bob has essentially been pushed out of the cryptocurrency market by a number of different trends and forces. If cryptocurrency is going to gain more users we need to find a way to bring Bob back into the fold."
CryptoCurrency,3dogmz,worldlybedouin,3,Sat Jul 18 20:34:08 2015 UTC,"This goes back to the price stability problem.  The only Bob who sees any currency value in cryptocurrency uses it in the black markets.  The rest see investment value in cryptocurrency.  This is also generally correct despite the technological stagnation in the industry.  It is necessary to have people take on the volatility risk.  Once price stability is finally produced, Bob will find more currency value."

CryptoCurrency,3dogmz,worldlybedouin,3,Sat Jul 18 19:24:39 2015 UTC,"The price volatility is an issue that hinders adoption. It just doesn't feel good to buy a crypto currency one day and until it gets spent the rate has dropped by x%. I don't know how many purchases are done with BTC (I'm going to say BTC, but the same applies for almost all else) that have just been bought recently in order to spend them soon and how many BTC are spent from long-time holders who have then anyway. As most cryptocurrencies have no way to control supply in order to adjust it to demand, there is no feedback loop possible that keeps the price at a constant level. I tend to call them assets or commodities. They are great for speculating on the price development, but no, they are no currency and I doubt that they can ever be. The current inflation of BTC due to mining (approximately 3500 new BTC per day) can't be raised at will. If you put more hashing power to the network, the difficulty adjusts. Only if you continuously add more hash rate to the network you can incease the amount of newly generated BTC per time frame. If the demand for BTC increases big time, so does the BTC price. The only way to keep the price stable would be to increase supply, which is - as we know - not possible. And if the demand for BTC drops, the price follows, because you can't decrease BTC supply. Ok, you could burn BTC, but honestly - would anyone do that just to keep the price up? The volatility is the reason why so many transactions at shops are processed by payment providers. They handle the technical stuff, but more importantly, they exchange the BTC in the background and pay the shop with USD (or whatever). Most shops don't want ti keep BTC. They can't pay their employees or suppliers with BTC. And if they keep them until they need to pay bills, who knows what's the exchange rate by then? Fortunately there are solutions to the volatility problem. The list may not be complete, but I know of bitUSD, NuBits and Tether. They offer crypro currencies that are pegged to USD. So they evade the need for quick conversion. The drawback of that is that you need to rely on their proper function and their stability. But hey, if BTC should blow up, the money is gone as well ;-) I'm not very familiar with Tether, but to the best of my knowledge bitUSD and NuBits have kept the peg ever since their creation! I consider that impressive. And for NuBits there's a mobile wallet for Android devices available that is in the current release able to convert NBT instantly using shapeshift. So you can pay with every crypto commodity that is supported by shapeshift by proxying NBT. You can store NBT in your wallet. They keep their value and you still can pay in BTC, LTC, whatever. As more and more point of sale terminals have trendy tablets (speaking of trendy small shops - the usual suspects when thinking about trendy payment methods ;-) ) I hope it's only a matter of time until you find more and more places where you can pay with crypto commodities or crypto currencies!"
CryptoCurrency,3dogmz,ChicagoSchooler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"bitUSD depends upon shorting with large amounts of collateral.  it's too expensive.  This is the worst way to go despite the fact that it's the only one of these three that tries to maintain a stable general price level.  NuBits requires that the equity be sufficient to cover an inflationary decrease in demand.  This is not guaranteed.  It's worse than central banks because it uses equity instead of credit.  Also, NuBits is pegged to the USD, nominally, making it redundant.  Tether is also another peg, making it redundant.  All three are impossibly slow to be used as banknote and/or bank reserve substitutes."

The assets will pay dividends and should raise in price, while Nxt will be used to pay transaction fees so it will raise too (and btw there are many other projects being build over the Nxt blockchain, beside supernet). Also Btcd has currently a small marketcap and should give excellent returns since so much depends on it.

CryptoCurrency,3dk95i,ChicagoSchooler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"This article sums it up nicely:   Actually, bank-credit expansion creates its mischievous effects by distorting price relations and by raising and altering prices compared to what they would have been without the expansion. Statistically, therefore, we can only identify the increase in money supply, a simple fact. We cannot prove inflation by pointing to price increases. We can only approximate explanations of complex price movements by engaging in a comprehensive economic history of an era — a task which is beyond the scope of this study. Suffice it to say here that the stability of wholesale prices in the 1920s was the result of monetary inflation offset by increased productivity, which lowered costs of production and increased the supply of goods.  But this ""offset"" was only statistical. It did not eliminate the boom-bust cycle; it only obscured it. The economists who emphasized the importance of a stable price level were thus especially deceived, for they should have concentrated on what was happening to the supply of money. Consequently, the economists who raised an alarm over inflation in the 1920s were largely the qualitativists. They were written off as hopelessly old-fashioned by the ""newer"" economists who realized the overriding importance of the quantitative in monetary affairs. The trouble did not lie with particular credit on particular markets (such as stock or real estate); the boom in the stock and real-estate markets reflected Mises's trade cycle: a disproportionate boom in the prices of titles to capital goods, caused by the increase in money supply attendant upon bank credit expansion.   This is a perfect illustration of Mises-Austrian monetary thinking.  Their hearts are in the right place, but the models and conclusions on this particular subject they've drawn up are lunacy.  No one can blame them.  Even Milton Friedman didn't come to the conclusion that total price stability is optimal despite him being the best monetary economist in history.  And this is not to say that the Mises-Austrians have not contributed anything of value to economics.  It's just this gold fetish that's harmful.  In that passage, Rothbard simultaneously uses the quantity theory of money and then disavows it.  He can't have it both ways.  Either supply stability is optimal and provable by some means, or it isn't.  One can't say ""qtm shows that increased production soaked up the increased money supply to produce relatively stable prices"" and then turn around in almost the same breath come back with ""the removal of the boom bust cycle is bad because money wasn't stable for some mysterious reason that I cannot prove"".  Either production increased at a smooth rate, or it didn't.  Either it's good to not have recession and grow at a large rate or it isn't.  Monetary economics isn't Schrodinger's Cat.  With my objectivist hat, I say ""infinite wealth & income is ideal"".  Both potential growth in wealth & income are maximized under price stability.  Therefore, I conclude that price stability is ideal.    For more evidence of the optimality of price stability, the best US decades of the 20th century were the most price stable: 20s, 60s, and 90s.  It should be no wonder that the stock market was in a ""bubble"" for each one.  The data shows that our natural potential state is growth at break-neck speeds; unfortunately, we're not using a device necessary to achieve it."

They have constructed three blockchains and a test currency to run across them.  Moore said: ""We have up and running three separate systems within Citi now that actually deploy blockchain distributed ledger technologies.   They are all within the labs just now so there is no real money passing through these systems yet, they are at a pre-production level to be clear.  ""We also have an equivalent to bitcoin up and running, again within the labs, so we can mine what we call a 'Citicoin', for want of a better term.   It's in the labs, but it's to make sure we are at the leading edge of this technology and that we can exploit the opportunities within it."" – International Business Times UK, July 1, 2015  A few months ago we looked at Citigroup's apparent desire to abolish cash altogether.    Now we learn they are actively working in that direction, using bitcoin's blockchain technology as a model.  More shocking, however, is the news that Citigroup has an ""Innovation Labs"" unit. If you had asked us last week to name some words describing Citigroup, ""innovative"" would not have made the list.   Citigroup and its fellow too-big-to-fail banks seem the opposite of innovative.  Nevertheless, Citi seems to have impressed the IBTimes reporter, who describes the bank's ""seasoned"" innovation culture.   ""Like many big banks, [Citi] is now operating more like a venture capital funder in the fintech space,"" the story says.  Join the club if you find this hard to believe. There must be a missing piece, right? Indeed, there is.   Citi's idea of innovation involves ""talking to governments and regulators"" and seizing ""the opportunity to create a state-backed digital currency in a number of different countries.""  So, the Citi stereotype holds.   Their first instinct is still to line up alongside Caesar and help drive the chariot of state.   They seem especially interested in serving Africa's vast ""unbanked"" population.  There was a time centuries ago when many banks issued their own currencies.   Conceivably, it could happen again.   An open Citicoin blockchain might give users at least the same confidence they have in greenbacks or euros, if not more.  Citi's innovation department will draw the line at innovating the bank out of existence, though.   Non-aligned cryptocurrencies should still have a cost advantage.   Bitcoin has nothing to fear.

Set a monthly fund for it and have at it. I bought a Rockminer R-Box just for fun on eBay for dirt cheap and I am mining Peercoin, at a measly rate. I do it for fun, realizing I can afford to dump upward of 10 times that same amount every month just buying the coin. Which I do, occasionally. That's how I keep myself from spending money on mining hardware. I am not sure if you were planning to mine only while you were using your computer, but letting that thing run only for the purpose of mining is by far the most inefficient use of resources even if electricity was free.

Or some way to use peercoin consensus as a settlement network for a company to give customers rewards.  We could make like a dumbed down version of the blockchain where the only Tx are from the company to the consumer, Tx are verified by the consumers, and dividends are paid in peercoins to the minting consumers.  Then, the consumers could vote and hold the company accountable (to a limited degree) for poor customer service.  It would be like yelp but like 20 billion times better.  Anyway, I dunno, I'm just spit balling.  I'm sure people from the community have thought about this more than I."
CryptoCurrency,3dbn4c,nagalim,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, I see. What you're mainly talking about is Peershares DAOs which could distribute Peercoin as dividends. The problem with this as I see it is that there is nothing in the protocol enforcing Peercoin as the dividend coin, which is how it should continue to be as free choice is important. As in the case with B&C, Bitcoin was chosen as the dividend coin instead to help attract more investors. In the future once Nu has expanded more, NuBits could be the preferable dividend currency for Peershares DAOs because of its stable value.  I guess I was wondering if you meant that lots of projects could be built around a price volatile digital commodity that discourages high transaction volume. Because that's what Peercoin is. The backbone currency idea from Sunny King I believe refers to the fact that Peercoin's main focus is on maintaining the highest degree of decentralization and security possible compared to other cryptos, but sacrificing high transaction volume in the process. Here is Sunny's quote on that. Check the link for the full quote...  https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3ckdt3/sunny_king_it_appears_that_bitcoin_developers_are/cswbkgl   ""From my point of view, I think the cryptocurrency movement needs at least one 'backbone' currency, or more, that maintains high degree of decentralization, maintains high level of security, but not necessarily providing high volume of transactions. Thinking of savings accounts and gold coins, you don't transact them at high velocity but they form the backbone of the monetary systems.""   From what I've read, Sunny modeled Peercoin to simulate gold, so it seems that Peercoin's primary purpose is to serve as a secure store of value. I'm not referring to storing value in a price stable way as in NuBits, rather just the ability to store value safely in a crypto network that maintains decentralization and security as its primary goals. Bitcoin seems to have abandoned these important goals.  This would make Peercoin the digital equivalent of gold (gold 2.0), except that it's superior because it's both digital and decentralized where gold is not. Sunny's mandatory 0.01 PPC/kb minimum fee protects that decentralization and security by keeping the blockchain as small as possible, but sacrificing high transaction volume in the process. It probably would have made more sense for Sunny to call Peercoin a backbone commodity, rather than a backbone currency.  I've been wondering if there are any use cases for a crypto like Peercoin that simulates gold. Is secure storage of value by regular people the only use case, or are there other use cases that we haven't thought about yet? What else could digital gold be useful for? This is mainly why I asked the previous question. I thought maybe you knew of something outside the realm of Peershares dividends.  I guess I also shouldn't forget to mention that users of Peercoin could potentially use it as a currency, but only if off-chain networks came to fruition. As mentioned in the linked thread, off-chain networks would allow high volume and microtransactions by allowing users to avoid the 0.01 PPC/kb fee, instead using Peercoin solely as a settlement network with most transactions taking place off-chain."
CryptoCurrency,3dbn4c,Sentinelrv,2,Thu Jul 16 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said.  The only thing I want to reiterate is the bit about the peercoin network being highly decentralized.  A company that is interested in a crypto reward system for its flexibility that is also intregued by 'going green' would not want to figure out PoS distribution.  That is what peercoin has that nothing else in the world does: its organically distributed consensus process.  A peershares implementation can be highly centralized in its consensus, but issue peercoins to give it value outside itself.  For that purpose, why would the peershare choose anything other than peercoin, which it itself forked from?  Peercoin just feels like the perfect dividend coin, except for bitcoin which is further up the crypto fork tree.  But if your company is interested in associating with the 'green' branding and protocol, ppc is the dividend coin for you.  We shouldn't need to enforce it, it should prove itself to be the best option."

Rang telcom again:  'Oh! You're in the penalty box! Used your entire month's allowance on the first day of your billing period!'  In conversations with potential adopters (IndiaMikeZulu was trialing 'on-da-street'-crypto-adoption projects in late 2013), it is common to be asked how much data messin' with cryptos takes -- certainly here in the Australian countryside, and if we are serious about 'taking cryptos to the unbanked,' then the Australian countryside is an appropriate study.  Overall, C., crypto adoption -- by 'The 99%' -- is being slowed horribly by TotalNetLife Guy's assumption that everyone is him. (No girls in this world. All hims!)

Then, last I've checked, and I hope I will be corrected if I am wrong, it has the ability to saturate a 10mbps connection. So if you really wanted to run it, you would have to cap both bandwidth and volume. If you'd like, look me up on Twitter @fishbone_ I recently posted the kind of traffic a Peercoin node generates.

Ever since the Fed went off the gold standard, it's been able to print more money to control inflation. That's not true supply and demand, that's manipulating the supply. Cryptos that are finite will truly be decided by supply and demand.  That M0 currency is artificially influenced as well. It's just trying to offset the inflation of the USD, but it's still being controlled to be stable. What happens to the M0 when the USD goes hyper-inflation? Is the M0 supposed to become infinitely valuable? It seems like it's trying to get away with something unnatural.  Give me my crypto and let the market truly decide."

Are you saying that only in the world of currencies should the issuer not respond to shifts in demand just like a producer does in every single market?  By what I already linked, people don't like that for currency.  They like price stability.  This is the reason why the world doesn't care and never will about all the popular cryptocurrencies right now.  What's ""artificial"" in this case?  The Ideal Reserve, including its price stability, is controlled by its accountholders.  That's about as organic as it can get.  No, it started trading against USD.  A currency can start with any exchange rate the issuer chooses.  Whether or not it remains is dependent upon the relative demand of the currency and the other issue.  It can't control actual inflation of the USD, but it does control its own inflation, so they are slowly deviating, about a 2.5% on average appreciation of MØ to the USD per year.  If the USD hyperinflates, MØ's price relative to USD skyrockets.  The market capitalization of any currency is the production of the users * a price stability factor, what I included in my previous comment.  The Ideal Reserve is a cryptocurrency."

To me this seems unlikely, because each miner has an incentive to use whatever price index information is most popular.   Let's say the most popular exchange says a TargetCoin is worth $0.90 July 2015 U.S dollars. The target value is $1.00, so everybody knows the miner is supposed to decrease the reward for the next miner. A miner has nothing to gain by incorrectly increasing the reward for the next miner.   If the market price of a coin is $0.99 July 2015 U.S dollars, then there could be disagreements about whether to increase or decrease the next reward. But there is a margin of error, so miners in this case would build off any valid block, regardless of how it changed the reward for the next miner. The margin of error could be set to whatever level is necessary to prevent forks. If that means that the  value of a coin needs to float between +-5% of the target value, that would still be a huge improvement over bitcoin's volatility."

These latter city-comps are the 'big players', though their machinations (and often, their existence) are usually invisible to the surviving humans.

One problem: it looks like communications is almost hopeless, and cryptoassets are fully dependent upon secure communications.  Cryptoassets could also be used to help uphold a resistance government: legislation, executive appointments, etc.  I wouldn't get too hung up on an algorithm.

CryptoCurrency,3d2gjm,coinaday,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"the only economic value provided by cryptocurrencies   I'm currently positing that, as of the time of the story, each city-computer has a population of AIs, competing with each other for relatively scarce CPU cycles to run more copies of themselves. In addition, said AIs are running in something of a sandboxed virtual machine, prevented from being able to hack their own OS, as those city-computers without said safeguards had their AIs 'evolve to extinction'. Thus, the internal economy of each city-computer is based on the scheduling parameters programmed in by the people who set up the system - and that system was, most likely, based on TVA's blockchains. (I'm tempted to say that the virtual machines are run as homomorphic encrypted systems, as well, as an additional security measure against hostile city-computers' hacking attempts.)  There may not even have been any particular attempts to create such an economy; but as long as, say, it's possible for an AI to make a contract, offering some of its own future CPU cycles in exchange for additional CPU cycles in the present, then that should be enough to create an economy with incentives for the AIs to compete with each other at the accuracy of their predictions.   what kinds of characteristics you'd like it to have   For TVA, the basic bookkeeping entry that I'd like to build the rest from is along the lines of, ""I, OnlineHandle42, announce that I have 20 decibans of confidence (=99% surety) that the issuer of EncryptionCertificateX and OnlineHandle127 are the same entity."" Throw in a bit of Bayesian updating, and that seems to be enough to have TVA replace present-day certificate authorities and key signing parties. Add ID terms for offline identities (Social Insurance numbers, fingerprint hashes), with appropriate hashing and salting to avoid being able to make rubber fingerprints, and everything from driver's licenses to debit cards gets sucked into the growing behemoth. If some clever people create a UUID scheme to point to entries in a knowledge engine ala Cyc, and some other people use whatever TAV's internal scripting engine is to work on computing problems, and it may be possible for every computer's TAV software module to constantly be double-checking every piece of data on their computer for accuracy. The more paranoid the user, the more CPU cycles they could devote to such TAV checking.  What I'm hoping for, in this thread, is to learn what sort of blockchain mechanisms could be built to support the above - and then, more importantly, any further implications that those mechanisms may have, such as useful ideas I haven't thought of, and most especially what such mechanisms /can't/ do.

Events happened fast enough that by the time building an underwater data center was a possibility, each city's AIs were already comfortably ensconced in their own city-computer, and operated at fast enough speeds that no particular AI had any incentive to use the limited production capability to build new hardware very far from the existing CPUs."

That just doesn't really make sense on any level. Even if there's some really awesome computing system, it would suck up the efficient / high-powered CPUs. There'd still be plenty of computing power which wouldn't make sense to put in there, imo. I mean, maybe, at a stretch, everything is a bit useful in it because it's so expensive. But the idea this creates a scarcity just seems silly to me.   Given finite storage space... should I start considering when some of the many blockchains, or portions thereof, should be deleted?   Storage is generally growing at an exponential rate and with the world you describe, I wouldn't expect storage to be particularly limited. Quite the contrary, you should be looking up terms for things far beyond petabytes. In that sort of a context, I don't think focusing on limited storage makes a lot of sense.  With that said, of course, even today we're looking at pruning blockchains, and some chains die off. But I just don't think it's a primary constraint."

On a related note I might be interested in hacking on NXT for a bit. Some many hackathons are overly commercialized these days. This could be fun!
CryptoCurrency,3d094b,CryptoJunky,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:19 2015 UTC,"It worked one hour ago, now it seems down"
CryptoCurrency,3d094b,barbierir,2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, down for me too now - I'll tell the organizer. The video lists most details for now I think.  Great to hear you're up for it. If you know other devs, please spread the word. BTW: NXT also has bounties for finding bugs in the core, if you ever feel like hacking on your own schedule ;)."
CryptoCurrency,3d01ha,MaxKK,6,Sun Jul 12 09:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's THE reason I don't use cryptsy anymore.  I hold some coins that I consider a loss because they are only traded on cryptsy, and I won't sell them unless they get on a different exchange.  Anyway, I had some btc (i think?) held hostage by them earlier this year and after a week of waiting, I went onto their chat box and  politely complained (a lot).  an admin in the chat asked for my support ticket #, and within a few minutes they pushed the transfer through.  For some reason they try to act really helpful in front of the other chatters.  You'll need to basically spam your question, but only every few minutes so they don't ban you from the chat.  And be polite to them!!!  Then once the transfer goes through, then you can tear them a new asshole if you feel the need."
CryptoCurrency,3d01ha,omni_whore,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a stuck withdraw, and then after I complained to their support vocally enough, they pushed it through. With the twist that they overcredited me and I now have a significant negative balance in that coin, so they won't let me do other withdraws until I resolve that..."
CryptoCurrency,3d01ha,coinaday,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:23 2015 UTC,lol
CryptoCurrency,3d01ha,omni_whore,2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:49 2015 UTC,instead of email and twitter you should maybe try opening a regular support ticket with them? -> https://cryptsy.freshdesk.com/support/home  whenever I had any issues with cryptsy their support was able to solve it in a day or two.

CryptoCurrency,3d01ha,coinaday,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:08:52 2015 UTC,We are a cryptocurrency. They can sell their tokens on Cryptsy and then withdraw the BTC. But we are trying everything since a long time..

CryptoCurrency,3czkxe,CryptoJunky,2,Sun Jul 12 05:28:04 2015 UTC,Interesting idea.  I knew I had heard that name before. http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/2uadvd/the_real_reason_ryan_charles_was_fired_from_reddit_he_spent_the_entire_duration_of_his_employment_working_on_a_port_of_bitcoin_core_to_javascript/co6r4q9  As far as I can tell from the article the idea is that you replace the advert revenue model with a satoshi payment for what you view. With the additional change that moderators get paid.  So kind of like a magazine subscription where you only pay the creator of the articles you read.  I don't think it's a silly idea. I'm a sucker for the freemium model and often end up buying the 'pro' paid version.  Financial incentives are tricky and karma does seem to have worked so far.

CryptoCurrency,3cuq77,TorrentialTech,5,Fri Jul 10 22:54:13 2015 UTC,Litecoin pumped and dumped. Bitcoin rose a bit because of this. So did many other alts like PPC.
CryptoCurrency,3cuq77,filmassholesreturn,3,Fri Jul 10 23:44:28 2015 UTC,"I read in someone else's comments in another thread that the LTC pump-n-dump couldn't explain more than around 3% of a price rise, from 250 to around 258.  This was based on volume of various LTC and BTC exchanges and the prices recently, but I didn't double check that user's numbers.  On the other hand, I find Greek economic problems and the recent crash in the Chinese stock market to be more plausible explanations; a far smaller share of either of those economies is necesaary to explain growth from 240 to 300+ in the bitcoin economy.  Also, the spread between American and Chinese exchanges right now is insane, close to 20% at times, and I think that is probably more exemplary of ""what's going on"" than some altcoin pump-n-dump.  Of course, we are all hoping China is getting back into the bitcoin fever..."

CryptoCurrency,3ckdt3,Sentinelrv,14,Wed Jul 8 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"To further expand on Sunny's thoughts in this weekly update, here is a quote of his from an interview in 2013...   ""Both PPC and XPM are designed to last. PPC is designed with energy efficiency, XPM is designed with energy multiuse. Bitcoin has a long term uncertainty as to whether transaction fees can sustain good enough level of security. Before that the main concern is how to balance transaction volume and transaction fee levels. Currently I get the feeling that bitcoin developers favor very low transaction fees and very high transaction volume, to be competitive against centralized systems (paypal, visa, mastercard etc) in terms of transaction volume, to the point of sacrificing decentralization. This also brings major uncertainties to bitcoin's future.  From my point of view, I think the cryptocurrency movement needs at least one 'backbone' currency, or more, that maintains high degree of decentralization, maintains high level of security, but not necessarily providing high volume of transactions. Thinking of savings accounts and gold coins, you don't transact them at high velocity but they form the backbone of the monetary systems.  Pure proof-of-work systems such as bitcoin is not 100% suitable for this task. This is because transaction fee is not a reliable incentive to sustain network security. If the mining generation amount is kept constant (there have been several such attempts in altcoins) it would work better security-wise but then it would also significantly weaken the scarcity property of the currency. XPM's inflation model is designed in such a way that it could serve as backbone currency better than bitcoin if needed, because it could maintain high security reliably for longer, with reasonably good scarcity property as well. Of course that's only from architect's point of view, whether or not it would be chosen by the market is a whole different matter.  PPC is designed to serve even better as a backbone currency. The proof-of-stake technology in PPC is not only energy efficient; it also maintains high level of security without relying on transaction fee. Thus PPC could be safely designed with strong scarcity property yet serving well as backbone currency. Both PPC and XPM use protocol enforced transaction fees, which reflects my preference that high transaction volume is discouraged in favor of serving as backbone currencies.  Right now if we are talking about micropayments in the US$1 range, both PPC and XPM still handle them with much lower overhead than credit card network. In the long term micropayments should be provided by centralized providers, or a less decentralized network optimized for high capacity transaction processing.  On the other hand there is no promise that minimum transaction fee wouldn't be adjusted. If processing capacity of personal computers continues to advance at the current pace, both max block size and minimum transaction fee could very well be adjusted at some point. However I do take a very cautious approach to adjusting transaction fees, as opposed to bitcoin devs. The impact to the fitness of the currency as a backbone currency is of great concerns to me.""   Sunny King had a lot of foresight into the future of Bitcoin and designed Peercoin accordingly. The 0.01 PPC/kb fee in Peercoin is intended to discourage transaction spam. This fee protects the decentralization of the network, but it also means that the Peercoin network itself will never be able to compete with centralized solutions like Visa and Mastercard on-chain.  In this quote, Sunny predicts the rise of off-chain networks that would allow the majority of Peercoin transactions to take place off-chain, while Peercoin itself is used more as a backbone settlement network, a mechanism for transacting larger sums of money and a secure, censorship resistant, decentralized store of value. As an example of Sunny's intended design, compared to other cryptos Peercoin's blockchain size is still extremely tiny even after almost 3 years of operation."
CryptoCurrency,3ckdt3,peerpillow,12,Wed Jul 8 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed Sunny King had incredible foresight into issues that ""back then"" didn't feel that imminent. With the latest flood of tx span on Bitcoin network along with the in my mind very promising Lightning network, its becoming clear that Bitcoin wrestles with issues already solved in Peercoin.   Funny thing, if Peercoin was flooded with transactions, since the fee would be destroyed (in Peercoin fee doesn't go to minters) and the remaining coins would be worth more, making the attack more expensive to pull off. Much more could be said about this, and I feel I'm only scratching the surface. EDIT: I might be somewhat biased though,  since I own peercoins. But I own more bitcoins so well..."
CryptoCurrency,3ckdt3,TotalB00n,12,Wed Jul 8 18:28:36 2015 UTC,"The same attack that is currently hamstringing the Bitcoin network can be done at Peercoin as well. The mandatory fee protects the Peercoin network from dust transactions by making them expensive. But it doesn't protect from transactions for which the fee is paid.    You need to pay 0.01 PPC/kB for transactions. 10 PPC can buy you 1 MB transaction size. 100 PPC and you can afford 10 MB transactions. 4000 PPC and you can double Peercoin's blockchain size in less than 3 days. Doubling the blockchain size in less than 3 days sounds crazy - it took more than 2 and a half years to grow to that size! This is not what I'd call strong protection.    Those 4000 PPC when paid for transactions are destroyed, that's true. I doubt that the effect of such an action would be positive on the price.    You don't need to destroy more PPC with fees to put transactions in the blockchain than are mined+minted per day to add over 100 MB to the blockchain - daily."
CryptoCurrency,3ckdt3,peerpillow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"No doubt the fee will be destroyed, reduce the floating supply and all things else being equal increase the cost of a spam attack. Basically It's a question about the cost of the fee in terms of USD. When ppc was trading for >$6 the attack would have been several times more costlier. Peercointalk community members are week aware of this and one proposal is to mitigate these kinds of risk using a voting mechanism similar to that which was introduced in Nubits: https://www.peercointalk.org/index.php?topic=1539.15"

The same topic was discussed at Nubits with the result that the tx fee should be decided by the minters: https://bitbucket.org/JordanLeePeershares/nubit/issues/165/dynamic-fee The thing is: that approach is not feasible for the Peercoin network.

Then use that same crypto as karma between users.

Is that not a ledger?   There is no standard way to respond to such conflicting messages, but currency users would be wise to avoid transacting with parties with a history of conflicting transactions.  If a party tracks what messages they have signed(ie using a client) and keeps their private key secure, there is no reason they would legitimately sign conflicting transaction messages.   The reason someone would publish a conflicting transaction is to cancel a past transaction. I'm really bothered by ""There is no standard way to respond to such conflicting messages"" because this is the most important attack vector, and any disagreements (such as resulting from purposely undefined behavior) is how you get network forks.  Are cancellations over 24 hours ago ignored? Exactly 24 hours? Who is keeping track of the exact time? The main innovation of Bitcoin is that it uses its proof-of-work system to implement a decentralized timestamping system. If you don't have this, then people can disagree on the time that the conflicting transaction was published. If half the network thinks the conflicting transaction was published a few seconds below 24 hours, and half the network thinks it was a few seconds after 24 hours, then the network has just forked!"
CryptoCurrency,3c083o,AgentME,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"You highlighted some of the biggest weaknesses of my scheme, and if my answer is long, it's because I don't have good answers at this point.  These kind of critiques are what I came here hoping to hear.  It is clear you understand this, but I'll define the bitcoin ledger to help highlight differences.  The bitcoin ledger is document that orders individual transaction entries and is extended by publishing new blocks that are accepted and prioritized according to its proof of work scheme.  In my scheme, there is no ordering, only individual messages that are shared throughout the network, and signed individually by key holders.  Newcomers to the network would have no way to determine priority between conflicting messages.  But interested parties would be able to track when messages first appear.  By interested parties, I mostly mean merchants who accept a particular currency.  24 hours is arbitrary, but I chose it to allow any client that updated at least once a day to be able to positively assert message ordering in the case of conflict.  Markets could help standardize resolution of conflicting messages.  If important merchants would accept a coin with a certain history, other individuals would likely follow.  I don’t specify anyway for the “markets” to communicate these results.  This is probably a severe oversight.  In the case of such conflicts, peers could perhaps publish which message they received first and cryptographically sign that assertion. In a sense this would be voting, which has all sorts of problems, most of which I haven’t really thought about.  Bitcoin did well to avoid voting. (Which branch of blockchain you work on is the closest thing to voting in bitcoin).  I think I would allow parties to publish these “votes” but avoid any strict specification for determining vote outcomes.  Individuals would need to evaluate all messages relevant to a coin’s history and come to their own conclusions (though a client algorithm might handle this, or at least condense important information to present to users)  Without an ordering established by a ledger, any standard voting algorithm for prioritizing conflicting transaction messages would be challenging to design and it would establish clear points of weakness for attack.  Such an algorithm would either have to assign reputation to peers or otherwise give peers authority in pronouncing the valid version of conflicting transaction messages.  By not requiring a specific algorithm for these things I think I hope to gain ""Security through behavioral diversity"", ""Security through obscurity""(individuals need not publish their accepalgorithm), and ""Security through dynamic democratic/market algorithmic updates""(people choose what algorithm they use and what developer updates it)  That sounds so convoluted it's probably bad.  There’s a good chance these weaknesses make my scheme categorically worse than bitcoin.  Oh well.  To me it seems like bitcoin puts an inordinate amount of work into the seemingly simple problem of ordering/prioritizing transactions.  But perhaps the recognition that this is not a simple problem is the true genius of bitcoin.  Thanks again for your feedback and taking the time to look at my idea."
CryptoCurrency,3c083o,AgentME,3,Fri Jul 3 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"Security through behavioral diversity   If different participants come to different decisions about what transactions are valid, then you have network forks. These are fatal if they're not resolved quickly to nearly everyone's agreement because otherwise each one splits the user base into using practically different currencies. There must be a clearly defined way to determine what transactions are valid.   ""Security through obscurity""(individuals need not publish their accepalgorithm)   The phrase ""security through obscurity"" is generally intended as an oxymoron and an example of what not to do.   I think I would allow parties to publish these “votes”   As you allude to, Bitcoin has this. The voting is done by miners through the proof-of-work system.   any standard voting algorithm for prioritizing conflicting transaction messages would be challenging to design   The double-spend problem is probably 95% of the difficulty of designing decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was revolutionary because it finally came up with a solution to this. If you don't have a specific solution to this, then you don't have much of an idea to be honest. Everything else is trivial with signing algorithms."
CryptoCurrency,3c083o,AgentME,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:46:53 2015 UTC,"First thing, I got rid of cancellations. Coins not accepted or rejected by recipient are lost.  As for forks, the responsibility of the network is to store and replicate messages.  Individuals decide whether to accept or reject particular coins.  Network consensus is merely everyone having the same complete set of messages.  I imagine you could query peers for all the messages in the history of a particular coin.  The network doesn't make decisions about the validity of coin ownership claims, it only shares all relevant messages.  All messages are signed cryptographically and it would be hard to suppress messages as the party with an interest in preserving it can store it and produce it when needed.  I was alluding to the common use of ""Security through obscurity"" being bad as you point out.  It was a self critique.  My solution to double spending basically hinges on reputation and trust.  You trust the network to provide complete information, and then you make decisions in your own self interest.  You use the history of everything in the network to make those decisions, and ideally you participate in the network daily so you can independently confirm temporal order of messages.  Temporal ordering of messages is the one problem bitcoin solves cleverly, but if participants can independently verify there's no need to cryptographically verify.  We trust banks and government on a lot less cryptographic security, it's more like bureaucratic security through vigorous accounting and enforcement practices.  I'm trying to do that.  Merchants and important players in the community would be leaders and authorities that the rest of the community would look to, but everyone is capable of tracking the network themselves if they want.  People would hold merchants and important network players responsible for preserving their reputations.  In my scheme, even the issuing of currency is done by individual entities and their individual reputation is the foundation of the value for that currency.  The attractiveness of my scheme hinges completely on its particular balance of cryptographic an bureaucratic security.  If you want to completely trust cryptographic security, bitcoin is your man, I'm not arguing with that.  I just think there's some market space for a middle ground option that uses both cryptographic and bureaucratic security.  My design is more ambiguous to allow more flexibility because the entities with authority and reputation have an important say in the details.  I understand that most of the bitcoin community hates words like ""Authority"" and ""Reputation"".  The name I chose highlights the fact that I embrace these principles, even while recognizing the importance of independent verification and democratic processes for holding entities with authority accountable in each particular community.  Every assertion can be independently verified by anyone participating in the network on a daily basis.  In my opinion that solves the double spending problem, even if I may not have explained all details adequately.  Sorry if I am animated or argumentative. I just want to make it clear what I am trying to do so that others can provide feedback if I am doing it in the most effective way.  Edits: some spelling and grammar"
CryptoCurrency,3c083o,MathAndFerrets,2,Sat Jul 4 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"Individuals decide whether to accept or reject particular coins.   Say every individual picks a different 1% of transactions to not honor. Then they won't honor any of the transactions that are based on those, and so on. If you try to pay someone, then if they haven't made all of the exact decisions about what to honor as you in the past, then it's ridiculously likely they're not going to find any of your money as valid. You're not able to decide that the merchant seems honorable and switch to accepting the same transactions as they did, because then you find yourself with no money. The merchant could decide to switch to honoring the same set as you, but then they'll have the same charade when they try to use the money. And then the network will be forking even more continuously. Even if it were all efficiently computable and people played along, each fork doubles the money supply so the consequences seem ridiculous.   We trust banks and government on a lot less cryptographic security, it's more like bureaucratic security through vigorous accounting and enforcement practices. I'm trying to do that.   If you're designing a system that depends on trusted authorities, then it's weird to use Bitcoin as a design inspiration. Having to broadcast all transactions to everyone in order to function is a price Bitcoin pays in order to get decentralization; it's unnecessary if you're not aiming for a trust-less system. With an authority, you can also use things like blind signing which can be used to implement stronger anonymity than Bitcoin does. See systems based on David Chaum's ideas. A public cryptographically auditable log could probably be bolted onto those I guess."

CryptoCurrency,3c083o,zeemanzee,3,Sat Jul 4 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"I seriously enjoy seeing dedicated contributions to the cryptocurrency space, so please take the following as constructive criticism rather than a troll or a slam.  Bitcoin uses a decentralized ledger, but that ledger isn't a ledger in a traditional accounting sense; people aren't tracking amounts in columns with account numbers. They are only tracking ""outputs,"" little bits of data they receive or try to send, and the validity of these outputs are guaranteed by digital signatures and the whole public/private key setup.   That is to say, nowhere in the bitcoin code will you see a verification that my wallet has 1.663 bitcoin in it before I send 1.663 bitcoin. You will, instead, see my wallet assemble enough ""outputs"" to exceed the transaction amount (whatever that is), sign all those outputs over to a new user, and then sign any leftover change outputs over to myself. If my outputs do not exceed the transaction amount, an error is spit out. Instead of thinking of it as a ledger, it may be more valuable to think of the system as shuffling around little atomic pieces of money, and whoever's signatures are on those atoms constitute ownership. The ledger consists of validating all those signatures.  So, in a way, we already do this.  On the other hand, there are other ways of doing it (you may have discovered a new way). Look at, for example, the CryptoNote method used by Monero. In that system, one-time signatures are used and tracked; if someone tries to double-spend, they will end up generating a signature a second time. Anyone scanning through recent transactions will cross-reference those transactions against the history of ""already generated signatures"" and any double-occurrences count as double-spends.  My point is that there are a variety of ways of accomplishing the same task already; before dumping a lot of effort into a new method, I would look around at the different schemes. Monero seems neat, but it ends up being a huge system, in terms of data storage."

Please don't use this on mainnet yet, but you can check it out on testnet  Permit NuShare custodians - The custodian system now permits NuShare custodians. This process is exactly the same as with NuBits, except NuShares are granted to an NSR address.  Protocol voting - Clients now vote for their protocol version. Each version of the reference client has a protocol version number hard coded in it. This number is placed on the blockchain in the coinstake transaction when a block is minted, similar to how other votes are cast. This vote is not user configurable, so it has no user interface components. When 90% of the last 2000 blocks have voted to increment the protocol version AND any applicable date criteria for the protocol change is met, the protocol will change. If the percentage of the last 2000 blocks voting for a protocol version falls back below 90% threshold, no action will be taken. The protocol version in effect cannot be decremented.  Change maximum interest rate increase/decrease – This enhancement changes the maximum interest rate rise from 1% per 1440 blocks to a per block rise of 0.002% and  enforces a maximum per block interest rate decrease of 0.004%. Also, durations below 32 blocks can no longer have park rates.  Propagate the liquidity identifier through the network – This enhancement changes the 'getliquidityinfo' RPC to now contain a liquidity tier breakdown and also a custodian breakdown. In addition, a new RPC ('getliquiditydetails') will return liquidity info of all the identifiers of each custodian.  Make park rates effective 60 blocks after the actual vote – As originally designed, parking rates are determined based on the rates published for the block that contains a parking transaction. This change uses the rate from 60 blocks in the past. This will permit the parking rates to be known 60 blocks into the future.  Dynamic fee – This enhancement permits shareholders to vote to set transaction fees. The median vote is the fee. Transaction fees are also set using the fee from 60 blocks in the past. The client uses the highest fee to be charged in the next 10 blocks. Default transaction fees equal to the current transaction fees are applied if there is no transaction fee vote for a particular currency in the majority of share days for the voting period of 2000 blocks."

It must:   Depend on the current block's data, so that the work cannot apply to any other block. Depend on the previous block's data, so that it's strictly ordered after the previous block. Typically this is managed by including a hash of the previous block in the current block. Provide a chance of a match being found in proportion to processor power available. Put another way, it must not be a case that the person with the most processing power wins, but instead that the person with the most processing power has the greatest chance of finding a block. Otherwise the person with the most processing power will always find each block. Have their difficulty scalable to adapt to changes in processing power.   That makes it much harder to find algorithms that do something positive and can depend on arbitrary additional data as an input that alters the output."

CryptoCurrency,3bohi2,sexystick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"bitcointalk is a huge content generator, home to hours of entertainment. Boasting plenty of bickering, it falls short on substantial content.   reddit is ""the frontpage of the internet"". A massive content aggregator, its best attribute is collecting the best stories happening around the world in one place.   While both have more positives than negatives and aren't going away, they combine to be sub-par destinations for having serious, drawn-out discussions.   Mad Crypto gets away from massaging egos (profiles) and incentivising short, whitty posts (points) in favour of discourse and simplicity.  How Mad Crypto differs from other forums:   No database   Threads are just RSS feeds. When a reply is added, a new item is added to the feed.   No hoops to jump through   No registration, no e-mail confirmation, no CAPTCHA. Just type your message, give a name and password you want to use and your post is made. Use the same name / password pair in the future to keep the same name, it’s that simple.   No clutter   No user profiles. No ""status updates"". No signatures. No user ranks.   Just pure discussion with none of the cruft."

CryptoCurrency,3bozxj,rnicoll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:43:25 2015 UTC,"For example, if you have 100coins in your digital wallet, and each week 1% of this (1 coin) was digitally taken out and distributed to all other wallets.   So who's the winner, and who's the loser?  If everyone loses 1%, everyone gains 1%, and nothing happened except total supply dropped, so for constant demand, the price would rise.   The fact that the currency ""decays"" over time would also encourage actual use, rather than just speculative hoarding like we see with Bitcoin.    Nah, I'll stick to paying all users a pro rata return on the increase in production less velocity.   n terms of closing the gap between the poorest, and richest, and improving economic disparity... this would make it vastly superior to all fiat currency and even gold, which can be (and is) hoarded by the elite.   Again, I'll stick to doing that with price stability.  Though an economy does demand a higher percentage of cash & bank reserves to satisfy the greater ability to take on more debt with price stability.  I can live with that."

I'd suggest looking at the libraries (bitcoin-ruby, bitcoinj, python-bitcoinlib, BitcoinJS) unless you work with C++ day to day, as they're generally a lot easier to get to grips with. A good first project might be to write a light application to create an address, send funds to it from an existing Bitcoin wallet (via the RPC interface) and then compose and relay a transaction to send them back. That should give you fairly broad introduction to a lot of the technology.  Keep an eye on /r/dogecoindev as well, I'm slowly publishing introductory guides on a lot of the technology, which pulls in information from a number of sources and tries to present it as a somewhat more coherent whole."

CryptoCurrency,3bmpnw,tipnyan,2,Tue Jun 30 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, please do! We would really appreciate it! Right now, I'm working on trying to do the Litecoin gitian build to gain experience for the future ""Nyancoins 2.0"" release. I could definitely use another pair of eyes on that, and that first step will help you for basically any of the Bitcoin-family of coins (that is, anything using the same codebase, which is a lot of them).  You can start here to read the Litecoin dev post about it, which leads to a link which leads to instructions. One note: they don't explicitly tell you that you need to create the virtual machine first, but you do. I found the command for that in a post about the Bitcoin gitian build process. If you are interested in working on this and get stuck with finding that command, let me know and I'll pull it up (I've got my notes on the other laptop, but I can find it one way or another; not sure if I made a post about it).  It sounds like you've got a great background. For a brief introduction, Nyancoins were going to be my example of a ""deadcoin"" in a series on altcoins I was writing at the beginning of the year. Only, when I looked into it, I found it ""wasn't quite dead yet"", and got curious about what it would take to rehab a coin. Six months in, the revival is going pretty well. We've got a lot of work to do in the future, and thus a lot of growth potential, but the community is starting to be active again (like KojoSlayer's comment here!) and the price is up 10x from the start of the year (initially pushed up in large part from my buying, but sustained from general community interest).  I could gladly go on at even more length (and regularly do so in /r/nyancoins) but I think that's enough for an intro. :-)  I'm glad you're interested in altcoin development! I think it's a great way to get started learning about the bitcoin code and do something useful, without having to jump right into the deep end to start with. Good luck to you wherever you end up, but here's hoping you end up with us!  +/u/tipnyan 10000 nyan"

Do you have any hard drives laying around? then free BURST for you! You just need to generate some plots with your cpu/gpu once and leave your mining software running.  This is a promising coin if you look at it this way, Back when mining went obsolete for new comers and the only way you can get bitcoin is to Buy it, Litecoin came along and people were able to get into what powers crypto currencies with their own hardware. This contributed to the success of Litecoin (along with some major PR work ufcourse).  Burstcoin has a lot of potential, we haven't seen it on cryptsy or shapeshift yet. Who knows what will happen when it goes mainstream? Litecoin jumped from 0.07 cents to 1$ in a matter of weeks. and NXT , the coin that Burst is a FORK of is currently sitting at ~5000 satoshi while BURST is at 73 with different features to NXT.

I suggest you start off with the lurking about in the forum if ever you are still interested during your free time. Past couple of weeks have been more quiet than usual but judging by the Bitcointalk responses and volume on exchanges, this coin is showing increasing long term support.

CryptoCurrency,3b3xdi,SweetLou33,3,Thu Jun 25 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"I usually look at the average volume on exchanges throughout the past couple of weeks.   Also take into account the mining profitability of the coin compared to others with the same hashing cryptography. If the profitability remains higher than the others on average of x hours/days/weeks this means the buy support is higher than the supply support.  Another thing to take into account is how active the developer is on Bitcointalk, Github and/or Reddit. Could see the devotion and skills this way. Also get to pull out early before the coin becomes abandoned."

We aren't a coin, but we have a blockchain and blockchain maintainers who have all of their work pooled with a peer to peer mining pool.  Edit for clarity: this means that block rewards are not based on hashing power, but rather on the basis of whether you contributed at all or not."
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,CryptAxe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:27:43 2015 UTC,How do you avoid the problem of botnets or people faking being multiple nodes (using VPN or otherwise)?
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,rnicoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:47:29 2015 UTC,"There's nothing we can do, just like there is nothing bitcoin can do, to prevent people using botnets to mine. As far as faking multiple nodes, you can't because the nodes have to actually submit work for the entire time that the current block is being mined, and if you could find a way to fake a sha256 POW you'd have much better things to do than attack us :)"
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,CryptAxe,2,Fri Jun 26 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"Proof of stake does not exactly ""mine"" per se, but you can process transaction with the cheapest computer. It's quite fun to find blocks every day or two. You just buy some proof of stake coin, and let it minting, or staking, on average mine a certain percentage a year. Peercoin and blackcoin are 1%."
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,olivermasiosare,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:52:52 2015 UTC,i would like to know too
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,exorbitantwealth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Litecoin/Vertcoin was supposed to be until scrypt asic miners were developed. I don't know much about the technical aspect but as long as it will be profitable someone will develop a faster method of mining eventually. So while it may be just for home users at first, eventually it will become mined by farms using specialized equipmen/asics."
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,fiatpete,2,Thu Jun 25 16:37:14 2015 UTC,Vertcoin was scrypt-N which increased the memory requirements to mine at set intervals to try and mimic the increase in GPU memory. They hard forked to another algo once the scrypt asic miners were announced just in case. If you're looking at proof of work the best you can hope for is that someone spending 10 times the amount to buy mining equipment only gets 10 times the hashing power unlike asics which need large capital investments now. If there was a system which favoured small mining setups over large then anyone with a large setup could just split it up.
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,rnicoll,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:59:33 2015 UTC,"Also, even if ASICs weren't feasible, it's difficult to (i.e. I can't) see how home mining (small scale, expensive hardware and power) could compete long term with major mining installations (very cheap power, and I'm fairly certain many of them get hardware a long way below list price by bulk-buying)."
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,ItsAConspiracy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:50:23 2015 UTC,"Ethereum is attempting to do that with a mining algorithm that depends heavily on GPU bandwidth. Since GPU companies are already heavily optimizing GPU bandwidth, it's not likely that some little ASIC company would do a better job of it.  A farm might be a bit more cost-effective with a bunch of rackmount servers, compared to setting up a home machine from scratch. On the other hand, if you already have a home computer and the only money you spend is to upgrade your GPU, you have the advantage...and if you're a gamer with a hot GPU already, and just mine when you're not gaming, your only expense is electricity."

CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,sos755,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:14:00 2015 UTC,I don't think a cryptocurrency that favors small home mining is necessarily a good idea. Economies-of-scale are generally more efficient.
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,MaxDZ8,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"Probably not in practice.  To avoid big farms, the coin must be profitable enough to be in the black for small initiatives and ""not worth enough"" for big investments.  Because of economies of scale and residential electricity being generally more expensive, the margin to make this happen is extremely tight.  As it stands now, CPUs and HDDs are most easily centralized. GPUs not much so even though you can still get large savings in buying bulk.  The problem isn't technical. It isn't about cryptocurrency either. There's a reason if you buy most things in shops, assembled in factory."
CryptoCurrency,3b35iq,rel-oad,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:57:39 2015 UTC,"Hyperstake is the only currency I know of that has truly decentralised (PoS) mining. Anyone can mine with as little as $1-2 worth of the currency.   With 90-second block times - there are 960 blocks per day - at current exchange rates, each block pays approximately $1 USD.  You just need a CPU and some coins."

CryptoCurrency,3ax68j,tmtwd,2,Wed Jun 24 05:35:24 2015 UTC,"Happy cake day!  A settlement network basically means a way of settling accounts between two parties (in this case sidechains, off-chain transaction processors, etc.) This is easier to explain with a bank-based example. Imagine two banks, whose customers regularly send money to each other. Rather than sending money between the banks for every single transaction, which is fiddly and expensive, they might track transactions throughout a day and work out a total to be sent in one single settlement transaction.  Essentially it's a warning that if fees get too high, the only ones who will be able to afford them will be very large institutions."
CryptoCurrency,3ax68j,rnicoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally, they're the same thing.  Because currency issuers are all central banks, until the invention of the cryptocurrency, theoretical development has been retarded.  Clearing, settling, and reconciling are bank functions.  It's simply the process of recognizing that ownership of a non-bearer bank liability has changed hands.  It doesn't matter if it's stocks or bank reserves, fundamentally, the process is the same.  Not only will bitcoin not be a settlement network for some of the same reasons it won't be a currency, it also won't be a settlement network because it issues nothing but bitcoins."

Unfortunately I don't like the tech or devs, or scam premine, and some of the community, but the simple fact that DASH is so popular really helps it regardless of its rocky past.

How often do you have to send amounts to many people all in 1 tx? Somewhat raises cost for exchanges/services but they just charge  NXT tx fee on user as they do with Bitcoin tx fees.

CryptoCurrency,39yr6f,rnicoll,3,Mon Jun 15 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Great paper. Part of the fear in the Bitcoin block size debate is the forking process.  Dogecoin's fork to support AuxPoW was managed very professionally (some new details of which I was unaware until I read the paper) and it's a credit to the devs and volunteers that everything worked smoothly. I upgraded my wallet ahead of time and wasn't even aware the critical block had been and gone.  A Bitcoin fork can also go this smoothly.  A fork carries some risk, obviously. The thing is though, it is far worse to see a problem coming and do nothing about it. The risk of inaction is higher than the risk of action. Proper management of the upgrade mitigates the risks and ensures a successful outcome."

What's more useful is looking at how this changes - obviously everyone champions PoS for this, but ignores that PoS has two huge drawbacks. Firstly, your mining security changes from physical hardware that is difficult to relocate, to cryptocurrency that is readily and anonymously movable. That means if an exchange is hacked and significant funds stolen, you have a potential disaster on your hands (see Vericoin as an example of this: http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-protected-vericoin-stolen-mintpal-wallet-breach/ )  Secondly, it directly contributes to the richer becoming richer simply for having money, which I think for many involved in cryptocurrency is the exact opposite of what they're wanting to see (i.e. people should be rewarded for effort, not simply for being rich).  I would definitely like to have a better solution than PoW, but PoS isn't it. Also, as mining rewards drop, I would expect we'll see power consumed drop down (there is absolutely no requirement for the amount of power used to mine Bitcoin, for the network to function, it is simply how many miners are out there already)."
CryptoCurrency,39pa68,Trstovall,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Your point about many coins being located on exchanges is a valid one, though arguably it is only a short to medium term problem.  It's difficult to see what the future holds, if decentralized exchanges will gain traction, the ratio and split of coins between different exchanges and users as the market evolves, and the security practices that will be standard.  I really don't agree with your second point though.  Most respectable proof of stake coins offer only modest interest rates in exchange for staking. I know Blackcoin is 1% interest/inflation, but that's only on coins that are actually staked, so real inflation is less.  Peercoin I think is also supposed to eventually be 1% when the hybrid PoW/PoS phase concludes.  Additionally, at this point in time, anyone who invests a reasonable amount of money ($100 or so) will probably have enough coins that they can find a staking block with enough patience, so everyone can receive their interest if they so choose.  So really it's ""anyone who stakes gets slightly richer relative to those who don't bother.""  This could change in the distant future, but in that case, there would probably be better investments for rich people than 1% annual interest anyway.  I think ""rich get richer"" is one of the weakest arguments against proof of stake.  Of course, proof of work has its own problems to worry about, so it would be unfair to look for problems with one system and not the other.  There are certainly more technical arguments to wade through between PoS and PoW, but if the arguments you presented here were the strongest available against proof of stake, I would be supremely confident in its future and superiority to proof of work."

CryptoCurrency,39h4qb,BitShareshooray,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"Here is a quick overview of BitShares 2.0, with links to the discussion on Bitsharestalk.  Dynamic Account Permissions Permission handling for the corporate environment. BitShares designs permissions around people rather than around cryptography which means that it is both easier to use and to understand. Every account can be controlled by any weighted combination of other accounts and private keys. This creates a hierarchical structure that reflects how permissions are organized in real life and makes multi-user control over funds easier than ever. Multi-user control is the single biggest contributor to security and when used properly it can virtually eliminate the risk of theft due to hacking.  High Performance and Scalability Over 100,000 transactions per second. High performance blockchain technology is necessary if crypto-currencies and smart contract platforms wish to provide a viable alternative to existing financial platforms. BitShares is designed from the ground up to process more transactions every second than VISA and MasterCard combined. With Delegated Proof of Stake, the BitShares network can confirm transactions in average of just 1 second and limited only by the speed of light.  Referral Rewards Program Rapidly grow network effect by incentivizing mass adoption. BitShares has an advanced referral program built into the software. Financial networks derive their value mostly from their network effect. The more people that use the same network the more value that network has to the users. BitShares rewards those who sign up new users that actually use the network and does so in a fully transparent and automated way.  Decentralized Asset Exchange As fast and flexible as any traditional centralized exchange. BitShares provides the highest performance decentralized exchange available that has all of the features you would expect in a trading platform. It can handle all of the trading volume of the NASDAQ while settling orders the second you submit them. With this kind of performance on a decentralized exchange, who needs risky centralized exchanges?   Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus A robust and flexible consensus protocol. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters from fee schedules, to block intervals and transaction sizes can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.  Price Stable Cryptocurrencies The freedom of cryptocurrency with the stability of the dollar. A BitAsset is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to that of another asset such as the US Dollar or Gold. BitAssets have over 100% of their value backed by the BitShares currency, BTS, and can be converted to BTS at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price feed. In all but the most extreme market conditions, BitAssets are assured to be worth at least their face value and perhaps more in some circumstances. Like any other cryptocurrency, BitAssets are fungible, divisible, and free from any restrictions.   Recurring and Scheduled Payments Give direct debit authority or limited withdraw permissions to anyone. BitShares is the first smart contract platform with built in support for recurring payments and subscription payments. This feature allows users to authorize 3rd parties to make withdraws from their accounts within certain limits. This is convenient for anyone who likes to “set it and forget it” when it comes to their monthly bills and subscriptions.  User Issued Assets Issue stocks, bonds, or other tokens while being compatible with KYC and AML regulations. The BitShares platform provides a feature known as ""user-issued assets"", designed to help facilitate profitable business models for certain types of services that integrate with the platform. The term user-issued asset refers to a type of custom token registered on the platform, and which users can hold and trade while obeying certain specified restrictions. The creator of such an asset gets to publically name, describe, and distribute its tokens as desired. In addition, the issuer can specify certain custom requirements for the asset: such as allowing only an approved whitelist of user accounts to hold the tokens, or requiring users to pay certain fees when transferring or trading the tokens.   Transferable Named Accounts Easy and secure transactions. Named accounts enable users to easily remember and communicate their account information. We don't use IP addresses to browse the internet or numbers to identify our email, so why shouldn't we have human-friendly account names for our financial transactions?  Stakeholder Approved Project Funding A self-sustaining funding model. BitShares is designed to be self funding and self-sustaining by giving the stakeholders the power to direct where blockchain reserves are spent. BitShares has a reserve pool of 1.2 billion BTS (about $8 million dollars) that automatically grows as transaction fees are collected and the share price rises. Each day the blockchain is authorized to spend up to 432,000 BTS (about $77,000 per month); enough to hire a small team to maintain the network for years even with no price appreciation.  Collateralized Bond Market Lend or borrow anything on your terms. The BitShares bond market is an investment marketplace accessible to anyone with an internet connection. With the bond market you can earn interest on anything while allowing others to short any asset backed by any other asset."
CryptoCurrency,39h4qb,thieflar,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"To be completely fair, this should be possible for most centralized technologies like BitShares. The article makes it sound like BitShares can process more than VISA+Mastercard... but either VISA or Mastercard could process higher volumes than they currently do, should the need arise, because they, too, are centralized payment processors.  The difficulty is not in processing a huge amount of transactions per second, it's in doing so with a massively decentralized network."

As for Bitcoin pools being assessed as one entity (or as you put it, ""block producer"") I've always found that to be a laughably weak appraisal of the system. A pool operator does not control the hashing power of the pool, really, and any given participant can point their miner to a competing pool without any real friction or switching costs. Practically speaking, pools don't have real say-so like individual miners do. A ""rogue pool"" would not be rogue for long... unless they physically control the devices that point to their pool, of course.  That's why the GHash fiasco was kind of bad, about a year ago; it was unclear how many of their miners they had physical control over. Apparently not much, though, since they're basically dead now."
CryptoCurrency,39h4qb,VoR0220,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"Actually you have stated the key way to look at it.  A pool operator and a BitShares witness are both trusted signers who get their authority to sign by continuing to be trusted.  The real decentralization comes in all those people who delegate their hash or stake power to nodes they trust.  The real difference is between fireable (pool operators or witnesses) and non-fireable (owners of large hardware farms).  BitShares block signers are 100% fireable and once they lose their reputation must start over.  Bitcoins large hardware owners don't have to start over and will always remain beyond the control of bitcoin holders.  BitShares holders can decide what the maximum percent of blocks a witness can sign by selecting the required number of witnesses.

The internet has no shortage of places. There are many threads on bitcointalk and multiple subreddits, and many contributors are on both sites. When people demand things, but don't want to learn or test, that is a cultural issue. When people are ok to lose 10BTC in some ponzi or lottery (or non-multisig exchange) over and over, yet are averse to donating 1BTC to the people who maintain or improve BTC, it is a cultural issue. When people follow-the-leader, and value a statement mainly by its source, that is politics not technology. Because we're inventing new forms of money, it is difficult to filter out vested interest.  I believe Monero was originally based on the CryptoNote whitepaper, and was also influenced by Bytecoin. Without going into detail (tldr), I believe Monero to have some good anonymity properties. If you want to achieve anonymity, there's presently no getting away from studying technical details, and a tldr won't do."

CryptoCurrency,392w4e,PumpkinFeet,2,Mon Jun 8 21:28:10 2015 UTC,"As others mentioned, what you want to look for is a totally different codebase. A different hashing function (like litecoin) still leaves a massive overlap of code; it's still essentially bitcoin in my opinion.  Monero is consistently one of the more common answers (disclaimer: I hold some, if I ever remember to log back into the exchange I have it on). When I looked into it before, I recall being impressed but I don't remember all of the details of its design.  Bitshares as mentioned is a very interesting one. It has some very different features. NXT and NuShares also have some similar ""next generation"" types of features (derived assets and so forth). So you get cool features to checkout, and independent code.  I'm sure there are others out there, but I agree with the top comments here that those are probably the best options. Oh, there's also Ripple, which gets a lot of legitimate criticism, but it is a different codebase. I never looked into it, but I think Stellar is supposed to be a similar one to that which addresses some of those concerns.  Arguably some of the other PoS coins might be different enough, but I don't know enough of their codebase to be able to say. I'm thinking in particular here of Peercoins. I think they have the same original base, but to make it PoS a lot of the core would have had to have been swapped out.  Another way to think about it might be to expect that a flaw would be found in a change to the code, in which case the clonecoins would work as they lag further. The argument I could make for this is that if there were major exploits in the older parts of the code, they would be more likely to have been found. The counter to that would be to say that there simply hadn't been the incentive to attack the older code once Bitcoin moves on, although that could also imply the clones to be a bit independent.  But in general, I definitely agree with your thought process here: if you want to hedge against a critical bug in Bitcoin, you need a separate codebase.  Of course, I'm not particularly concerned about a flaw in Bitcoin, so I personally haven't done significant diversification in those regards. But it's certainly a reasonable consideration."
CryptoCurrency,392w4e,coinaday,2,Tue Jun 9 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"thanks buddy that's a great reply. Very helpful.  Why are you not particularly concerned about a flaw in bitcoin? Thing is, it seems to me that a flaw is the ONLY thing standing between bitcoin and the absolute best-case-scenario moon."
CryptoCurrency,392w4e,coinaday,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"You're quite welcome! I'm glad you found it useful.   Why are you not particularly concerned about a flaw in bitcoin?   I used to see it as a leading concern. It's not that I've done code review (I haven't). Granted, it's a bunch of code and code does tend to have bugs (I'm a novice software engineer by background). But I have faith in the development team, and the software has proven itself through its operation. I believe that if there were some flaw, it would likely have already come out.  It's just a hunch, and quite an optimistic one.  But I think, even presuming the software works precisely as we think and expect that it's supposed to, there are a lot of other possible roadblocks on the way to absolute best-case-scenario moon. I'll try to think of my top ones here quickly: (a) hostile legislation (already been a fair amount of this; question is how much it gets entrenched and enforced. I believe this is already a drag on BTC), (b) misinformed public opinion (already a factor), (c) competition from other cryptocurrencies (much to my regret, this sort of thought was one of the main things that kept me from buying in back around $5-$10; I was worried Bitcoin might become the MySpace of this field), (d) division in the bitcoin community (this is appearing like it might happen if things go badly during the current 1Mb debate; if the developers split, I think that'll be a very bad thing).  I could probably come up with more, but that's a little sampling. I think there are a lot of risks from here to moon, and that's why the price is where it is."

CryptoCurrency,391hfw,arnili,2,Mon Jun 8 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"Glad you asked! Storj, if you look at their github repo, is mostly pdfs. They've been great about getting exposure and funding and are beating us out in that game no question. Without smack-talking them too much, we believe (and have been told by many) that we're the most practical implementation of this idea that's a logical leap from the cryptocurrency concept.  And we work :D  Currently single files are restricted to 500 MB, thus you should be fine doing many terabytes of data in total. Mining is a strong apriori front that we're working on improving more and more, but it currently is pretty well done and handles the network well."
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,super3,0,Mon Jun 8 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"Sia is a cool experiment, but this is something similar to what we ran last year. So you can say hey we work, but Merkle proof algorithms for audits don't scale.   In other words your files may be lost on the Sia network. Any the network could support at most a few terabytes with lots of mining overhead.   Our new algorithms will support the size of the Sia network on the hardware of a Rasberry Pi."
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,Taek42,2,Mon Jun 8 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand Sia very well. Merkle proofs scale in size on O(log(n)). The merkle proof for a 1TB file is only 2kb.  ""Your files may be lost on the Sia network"" -> Sia is an experimental network, though running out of space on the blockchain is not what would cause files to be lost. If you can create the storage contract in the first place, your files are protected by storage contracts.  Can you give figures? What math are you using that made you conclude Sia could support ""at most a few terabytes with lots of mining overhead"".  Additionally, how does that result in mining overhead? Large transactions will not affect hashrate at all. Sia is the same as Bitcoin in this regard."
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,super3,2,Mon Jun 8 18:53:28 2015 UTC,Well most files won't be 1 TB. They will be a few KB. Doing a standard PC amount of files would be around 400 MB of overhead per farmer per complete audit correct?  Need more information. How big are blocks? Is the merkle proof stored in the blockchain?
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,Taek42,2,Mon Jun 8 19:09:00 2015 UTC,"Each user only needs 1 set of file contracts to cover all of their files. A set, in the network at scale, will be somewhere between 50 and 200 file contracts. This will fit as many files as they need, 100,000,000 2kb files can fit inside of a single set of 200 file contracts.  This works because of the file contract channels (which work very similarly to Bitcoin's payment channels).  Blocks are 2mb each. Merkle proofs are stored on the blockchain. But not one per file per  host: one per user per host. (users will typically pick 50-200 hosts and use erasure coding).  edit: Sia will scale to somewhere between 50,000 and 1,000,000 regular users, users can store any amount of files because they all aggregate into the same file set. Beyond that we'll have to come up with new innovations, but we're comfortable with 1,000,000 users for the immediate future."
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,super3,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:16:18 2015 UTC,"So about 1,000 audits per block?"
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,Taek42,2,Mon Jun 8 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"Between 500 and 2000 audits per block, 144 blocks per day => 70k - 280k audits per day.  Audits happen every 2 weeks - 6 months -> 1m - 50m ongoing audits.  Each user needs to fit 50-200 hosts in the audits: 5,000 - 240,000 users. This assumes that every single user will need to put their audits on the blockchain, it's likely that they won't. This also leaves out a handful of other optimizations that we've made.  The vast majority of users aren't going to need every host to get audited every 2 weeks. When you have 50-200 hosts, each supporting files from many users, the hosts are getting audited all the time. Any hosts that tries cheating is competing against losing odds - cheating by 10% means a 10% chance of getting caught per audit, but a much greater than 10% penalty to their profit when they do get caught. If a host is getting audited several times per day (because they are being used by many users, not just one), the likelihood of getting caught cheating is very high.  Sia's biggest optimizations rely on having many users and many hosts. But, scaling is only going to be a problem if you do have many users and many hosts."
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,super3,2,Mon Jun 8 19:49:36 2015 UTC,But your audit scale is 2 weeks to 6 months. Which means I can cheat for up to 6 months with only a 10% chance of getting caught.
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,Taek42,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"Only for that single file. You're storing lots of files, you can't cheat on all of them.  If you're cheating on a single file, that's a very small fraction of the network total. Why did you choose to cheat on that file? Especially if it's such a low percentage of the total. Maybe you have a vendetta against me as a user?  It's not a very broad attack model, and it does not profit you. Your expected income is much lower, and you will only be able to cheat on a very tiny percentage of your total contracts before your risk of getting caught goes through the roof."
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,super3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:07:35 2015 UTC,"[citation need]  Jokes aside, cut the condescension and attacks if you could because storj is 'a cool experiment' as well.

CryptoCurrency,391hfw,timepad,-1,Mon Jun 8 18:38:50 2015 UTC,No attacks. Just technical concern. Taek told me that merkle audits are done every two weeks.   Test Group A stats (happy to pass over our data for you to look at) show that you need 2x order of magnitude speed up to fend off attacks. Is anyone collecting data on the Sia network. Could be very useful.
CryptoCurrency,391hfw,Taek42,3,Mon Jun 8 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"A tough problem to solve with decentralized storage is ensuring data redundancy: ensuring that a file that is supposedly stored with multiple peers is actually stored in multiple distinct locations.  For example, if I wanted to make extra money storing files, I could create a number of peers that claim to store a certain file. However, I would only store that file once, and all the peers would share information so any of them could ""prove"" they are storing it. So, whoever is storing that file would think they have the file stored redundantly across multiple different peers, however in reality, the file is only stored in a single location, and has no redundancy, and therefore is at a higher risk of being lost than a typical cloud storage provider.  How does Siacoin address this issue?"

CryptoCurrency,38tm7l,thotpolice84,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:53:48 2015 UTC,"Fiat money:       Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law. The term derives from the Latin fiat (""let it be done"", ""it shall be"").  It differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is based on a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange, while representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good.     The first use of fiat money was recorded in China around 1000 AD. Since then, it has been used continuously by various countries, concurrently with commodity currencies.

CryptoCurrency,38tm7l,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:54:16 2015 UTC,"It is defined that way because the ""let it be done"" or ""it is so"" property of fiat money has only been possible until recently to achieve via government declaration. Digital currencies before bitcoin were fiat as well though; the issuer of the currency would have been the ""government"". Bitcoin is the fiat of the bitcoin protocol and blockchain. The currency exists because the protocol and blockchain declare, by fiat, that it does. This is using the word fiat in its normal usage sense, not the highly technicalized sense that obfuscation economists use."

CryptoCurrency,38tok7,Etang600,2,Sat Jun 6 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"Since most forked bitcoin's code, I would guess most use the same 1 megabyte block size limit that Bitcoin uses.  I responded to a similar question about Blackcoin here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/blackcoin/comments/387kmj/rbitcoin_is_currently_anxious_about_their_block/crt104h  The answer is, well, yes and no.  Some issues will be the same, others will be different.  All proof of work based coins will face the issue of incentivization that Bitcoin will face, but proof of stake coins probably will not.  This problem is that, several years from now, block rewards will be very small, so transaction fees must make up the difference.  Keeping a small block size limit is one suggestion for a way to force people to pay competitive transaction fees, and clearly, the idea is somewhat controversial.  Some altcoins may reach this point before Bitcoin and serve as a test bed, but to my knowledge, no big name coins have reached the point of minimal reward (Dogecoin now has a fairly low block reward, but is merge-mined with Litecoin last I heard.)  ""Altcoins"" may also face the problem of bandwidth and memory that an unlimited block size could bring in the future.  But, if Bitcoin remains the most popular coin, it will likely have the most transactions, and be hit by this the hardest.  Small/less popular coins may have little problem with this, but more popular coins with many transactions could face the same potential issues as Bitcoin.  (Dogecoin perhaps, or if another coin is used for many small transactions.)  There's also apparently a denial of service attack possibility that a smaller block size is supposed to help fight, but I'm not familiar with it, if someone else knows more.  I didn't see it on the list of common objections Gavin Andresen wrote about, so perhaps people aren't worried about it?  http://gavinandresen.ninja/time-to-roll-out-bigger-blocks  Personally I'm undecided on some parts of the issue, but larger blocks would certainly be preferable if feasible."

AFAIK, it's just the concept of spam in general. The sort of crusade lukedashjr is always on about. Just the idea that if you allow unlimited size, and people do a lot of ""worthless"" transactions or throw a lot of data in there, then it's bloating the blockchain for all time. Arguably less relevant with block pruning, but that doesn't change that someone's got to have the whole chain."
CryptoCurrency,38tok7,coinaday,2,Sun Jun 7 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, guess that makes sense, ""DOS"" within the blocks themselves.  Seems easier to solve with a trivially small mandatory fee or something of the sort (or miners only accepting transactions with a fee of their own volition).  I was overcomplicating it, thinking it meant something like, ""Larger blocks would propogate comparatively slowly, making it easier to drown them out by broadcasting fake blocks"" or ""Larger blocks mean fewer people running full nodes, resulting in fewer targets to DOS if someone aimed at the nodes themselves.""  Though I guess that second idea could potentially make some sense, but tough to read the future."

First off, if you look at the source code that handles TX fees for both dge and bitcoin, you'll see they are the exact same! The only difference is that doge has less traffic, so you can get away with using a very small fee. Bitcoin has more traffic, so the network is less forgiving to TXs with low fees. If doge were to explode in activity, the fee will have to rise as well.  It is wrong to claim that any one cryptocurrency has less fees than bitcoin. For all cryptocurrencies, the fee system is exactly the same."

It certainly doesn't have to be that way, but there's a very good reason to disallow sending a millionth of a bitcoin for free: It would allow users to try to harm the network by spamming countless transactions of ""dust"" (amounts so small to be practically worthless.)  But regarding the article, less than 40 cents of fees to send what amounts to 70 different transactions is by far and away better than what any financial service would charge - you'd probably end up paying literally the whole amount as a fee if you did that with something like Paypal.  The real question is what kind of fees we'll be seeing in 10+ years, when block rewards decrease, but that's too far away for more people to care about, despite it being a fundamentally important question for the Bitcoin system."

You're not asking for advice, you have this glorious vision of mining coins on your unused phone and experienced miners are telling you it's so massively beyond pointless it's not even worth looking into.   By all means, look for a basic miner on the play store. They're probably scrypt, which is well saturated with ASICS. Mining is like an arms race. Before ASICS even your phone would mine worse than a netbook from 2008. With ASICS driving up the difficulty and lowering the value of most if not all scrypt coins by orders of magnitude, you'd now wish for that 2008 netbook status, which was still beyond terrible. The SHA algorithm of BTC is the same scenario but even worse for you as well. I'm fairly certain you can't even mine other algorithms and I doubt there is any serious development in mobile mining at all because it's simply too far beyond useless.   tl;dr, advice has been given to you, multiple times, you disregard it in favor of this glorious vision in your mind."

Uno at 1:1 with Btc? Probably six or eight weeks though.    xD  Heh, yeah, I bought in at a bad time, and kept buying as it climbed. But I agree about its long-term potential, which is why I've held onto it rather than cashing out.  Honestly, the three things that got me into it were: (a) the badass name, (b) the very limited supply, and (c) Un-Ex. I felt like the latter was a unique value proposition for it. I definitely wish you guys well, since I'm betting on it beating BTC over time."

If I were you, I think I might test it further and contact the mods and go from there.

They justify this by pointing out that there is less security in, say, a Dogecoin block than in a bitcoin block, and so for equivalent security, one would need to wait as long or longer. Which is to so completely miss the point as to be trolling: not every transaction needs bitcoin-level security. Sometimes you just want it on the blockchain now.   Not only that, but 20 minutes worth of Litecoin confirmations is more secure than 20 minutes worth of Bitcoin confirmations (or it would be if they had the same hashrate).  I don't have links to hand, but I think the basic idea is, the Litecoin confs should have come from 4x more different miners."

So for 100w you need a controller, WiFi, and to do the initial install/setup.  Or you could buy a 500w miner that plugs into an outlet. It's also got a controller, similar difficulty of install/setup, but can rely on ethernet or WiFi.   Same overhead costs but 5x the number of mining chips."

CryptoCurrency,383jh5,Lawsky,2,Tue Jun 2 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"/u/mthompson362 is right that people will be biased. But I think it's an asinine attitude to say that because people have biases, you should never ask their opinion. If you went online and asked for stock tips, I think you could expect that the people responding would probably have their money where their mouth is.  A lot of people have a pretty nasty attitude that if anyone is invested in something, then obviously everything they say is a lie and it's all a scam to rob you and you should always be paranoid and on and on and on. But it's a catch-22: mthompson claims you should ignore everyone here and go research. Well how are you supposed to research if you're also supposed to ignore anyone who is invested in any cryptocurrency? Are you supposed to only invest in those coins which your government-certified financial planner assures you are a good investment?  No, I believe that what you should do is consider what people have to say, and then do your research on whatever you find interesting.  Or not. Maybe you should ignore everything everyone says and just throw a dart because no one can be trusted.    One good place to start in any case is to go to coinmarketcap.com. They have an incredible depth of coins there. If you can't find it on there, it's almost certainly not worth investing in.  Now beyond there, it's a question of what you're looking for. What does ""best"" mean to you? Are you looking for unique technical merits? Are you looking for a stable value? Are you looking for something like a lotto ticket, where the odds might be long, but the potential payoff is as high as possible?  Basically, what is your motivation for getting into altcoins? There's no way to select a ""best bet"" without that.  But let's say your goal is price appreciation over the long-term, because that's a natural goal and it's the point I want to address. Dogecoin and litecoin are the obvious choices because they've already proven themselves. They're like the blue-chip stocks of cryptocurrency in my opinion: you can expect them to be relatively stable (so compared to other cryptocurrencies; compared to anything else they still look crazy volatile), but I also expect that they have less growth potential than selecting some much lower market cap. But that low market cap coin is akin to a penny stock: far more likely to go completely belly-up. So, as always, it's a risk-reward trade-off.    I do want to second Monero as being a good one to look at. It's been a long time since I looked at it, but I remember being impressed. I think I hold some somewhere, but it's honestly not enough for me to be biased on this part (although I'm sure the screaming hordes of the paranoid led by mt would claim that's nonsense; clearly if you have a few dollars of financial interest, it will turn you into a sociopath who would do anything to gain another %).    But I'll tell you what I'm doing. I've put a significant amount of money into Nyancoins (/r/nyancoins) and am working on rebuilding the community. I've gone beyond just speculating and am truly working to invest in building up the community, technical, and financial aspects of the coin. Why that? Well, frankly, because it's really hard. There are a lot of challenges. It's not something anyone else will recommend to you. I don't recommend putting in anything you can't afford to lose.  But I also believe that because it started at such a rock bottom valuation, it has tremendous room to appreciate as we start to develop further. We've gotten active community members who contribute, and we have various projects going to work on building value in different ways. I've gotten a tipbot running. I'm going to work on updating the client soon.   There's a lot more to say about what's been done, and what remains to be done, but I have written much of it before and I'll be writing a lot more soon, so I won't try to cover everything here. I'll link you to the major risk factors. You shouldn't buy unless you read and understand those.  Every coin is going to have trade-offs. If its value is relatively well recognized, like BTC, then it's going to have less upside potential. At the other end of the spectrum, if it's a niche community like Nyancoins, then there's far less demand for it and it's far less liquid, for one thing. Like if I wanted to try to sell my Nyancoins (I own about 60 million, which is a bit over 25%), it would crash the market. So I'm basically locked in until I can build up the demand enough.  And so, yes, I have an obvious and significant conflict of interest. But I also have a very strong motivation to build value, and I've been working to do so. It's been an incredible experience for me so far to have this outlet to challenge myself with. And it's a really cool problem-solving experience sometimes. For instance, the Nyanchain had gotten stuck for more than a day after a hit-and-run and I couldn't figure out what to do, and I needed to try to get a block moved to be able to make some tips (by the way, that reminds me, go to /r/GetFairShare to get some free coins and at least start getting some altcoin exposure that way). And then I realized that if I added a transaction fee to the block, it could make it worthwhile for someone to break the logjam. And it worked even faster than I could've hoped. Now I've felt pretty stoked for having figured out how to solve that.  So for me, it's far more than just my personal project to try to build wealth. It's also a way for me to play around and learn.    Anyhow, I don't know that this rambling essay will be of use to anyone, but I think it's a good question to ask and a good discussion to have. And I think it's bullshit those people who go around insulting everyone else and acting like they're being helpful. It's as asinine as all of the bitcoiners who constantly scream about how every altcoin is a worthless pump-and-dump.  I'm working hard to build something of value. I respect those who are doing the same. I have nothing but contempt for the peanut gallery who thinks they're clever for pointing out the trivial fact that people have biases.    Go find something you like and believe in and do more than buy it. Be a part of the community. Learn about the flaws. Learn about the strengths.  And most importantly, have fun fighting for what you believe in!    +/u/tipnyan 10000 nyan"

I have a computer, and in exchange for letting the blackcoin wallet program on my computer use up my cpu cycles when I'm on the internet, I earn 1% yearly interest on the value of blackcoins in my wallet, for the duration that I let it do that?   This would kinda hurt people with low values of coin in their wallet, because they're using up tons of electricity just to have the coins and have the wallet open. There's a certain threshold of coins that you would need to have in your wallet before the interest earned would be worth it to even have the coins.   I'm probably misunderstanding though."
CryptoCurrency,3841dd,thewilloftheuniverse,2,Tue Jun 2 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, that may be the case. The idea is that not only is it simpler for people to contribute computation, but it also acts as an incentive to buy and hold more blackcoin (or whichever PoS coin), thereby reducing the amount in circulation and acting as a positive drive on the price."
CryptoCurrency,3841dd,grimeandreason,2,Tue Jun 2 02:57:34 2015 UTC,"in exchange for letting the blackcoin wallet program on my computer use up my cpu cycles when I'm on the internet   The staking process itself is extremely minimal, it's something like 1 hash per 16 seconds.  Though there will be some resource usage from just being an active node on the network and having to leave a computer on.  It's true that there will be a fraction of single percent of annual inflation in exchange for securing the network.  But that's still far, far less than the cost of proof of work coins being mined and instantly dumped on the market.  The important question is which is more secure.  If they were exactly equal with regard to security, proof of stake would clearly be more efficient than proof of work."

As the software currently works, you gain the accrued interest when you create a staking block (meaning you only need to do that once to get your interest up to that point.

CryptoCurrency,3823rn,GRCtip,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"Well, when I was originally doing this, it was whatever whim took me next. I sort of had two dominant themes: looking for an interesting representative of something I hadn't looked at yet (like here, looking at a PoS coin because I'd done two PoW previously), and looking for something that makes for an interesting comparison (like looking to do NuShares as a contrast to Bitshares).  At the moment, what I'm doing is actually very slowly republishing my archives of my original series, which I'd deleted in a fit of pique. I'm doing a very minimal updating on the posts to show changes but mostly I'm just coasting right now. It was taking a lot of time and I'd gotten annoyed at criticism because I had too thin of skin.  Anyhow, so right now I'm not really doing new ones actively, although if I somehow got settled down comfortably again and caught up on stuff it would be fun to get back to doing new posts. I'd been doing one a day, which was rather intense, but it was a great experience.  I'm very amenable to bribes. If anyone wants to provide room-and-board in CO (or just a place I can park my car and sleep and access to a shower), then they'll likely be able to request coins to be covered (although I'd still say what I think about them) and I'd be writing more prolifically. ;-)"

CryptoCurrency,37vh4e,feklo3,2,Sat May 30 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"From a summary of that article, ""ShadowCash uses technological features to provide untraceable transactions"" is false.  It uses certain tricks to convert usual digital signature tokens (typical cryptocurrency tokens) into a cryptonote/monero-style ring signature based token. Ring signature transactions are (weakly) untraceable. And the conversion process between these two token types uses zero knowledge proofs, which are nice.  However, there are certain ring signature block chain traceability issues pointed out by the Monero Research Lab, and there are ways in which a spoiler party who receives some allegedly anonymous SDC tokens can immediately turn around and foil the anonymity of the previous user.  To put it shortly, shadowcash sure does look shiny."
CryptoCurrency,37vh4e,MathAndFerrets,1 point,Sun May 31 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"You started out by saying ""phonies"" followed by ""neat super awesome tech I don't understand"" then ended it with a misunderstanding about the usage of sdt and the already addressed issues with the initial cryptonote weaknesses.   Dig the username though. Check out their slack channel if you have questions. Smart asses are usually on to answer questions. A good amount of the cryptonote strateegeriZiNg was rewritten afaik but the github would be where you would want to check since sdc is open source."

CryptoCurrency,37vh4e,MathAndFerrets,1 point,Sun May 31 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"ShadowCash system is not cryptonote/Monero.  They do share some similarities with the implementation of ring signatures, but they are completely different systems.    Therefore all of weaknesses in Monero are not the same as weaknesses in ShadowCash.  Ring signatures are also just a temporary solution for ShadowCash with future plans to increase the anonymity.  The Shadow Project is constantly evolving.  By using anonymous tokens they allow the possibility to slot in SNARKS in the future once they are ready for primetime and fully trustless.  There is still some crypto work to do before SNARKS are ready.  Shadow Project is an entire suite of privacy centered projects including anonymous currency, encrypted chat, and decentralized anonymous marketplace.  They actually have a good working GUI wallet unlike Monero.  They have a lot more devs than Monero, including 2 full time devs, one of which is a cryptographer.  Its shiny because they have put a lot of work into it writing their own code, and actually have a plan and roadmap that they are following.  Monero does not have any such plan to improve their system with SNARKS.  Also Shadow Project has written their own code and implementation, and it is not simply forking bytecoin/cryptonote like Monero did, and then fudding other projects to gain an edge."
CryptoCurrency,37vh4e,MathAndFerrets,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"I love how making an observation about a coin and noting the similarities and differences between coins inevitably leads to pissing contests between altcoins and accusations of FUD.  First. I never said SDC was cryptonote, I said they use a cryptonote-like system for their shadow tokens. Which is true. Some other post accused me of calling the SDC team phonies, and accused me of hand waving through some vague technological criticisms. But I didn't do or say that either. I think there is a quote out there about protesting too much.  Second. I have no idea how many people are working on Monero, or cryptonote, or bytecoin, or shadow. I don't particularly care, either. If SDC is working on a marketplace, chat, AND a currency, it sounds to me like they would need three times the number of developers to make decent progress. One thing I do care about? I care whether a team is ensuring the underlying technology is stable before slapping a pretty GUI on it.   Three. My understanding of the SDC approach - and this is a criticism that applies to many coins - is that they seem to be gluing various cryptographic techniques together with little concern for how that glue holds up under a stress. The bricks they are using are strong (ring sigs, snarks, etc) but I have a major concern for the mortar. And I am not going to put my money into a brick bank with no mortar. Look at bitcoin, which is insanely complicated as it is, but is built from only a few very solid but very simple independent pieces. It works well, and while many improvements can be made, it is rare that you can stick a complicated band-aid on a complicated problem and walk away with an improved product. Snarks aren't fully good to go yet? OK, let's use ring sigs too! Etc.  Four. This point is a personal opinion that maybe not everyone will share, but I think it should be put out there. If the SDC team has a decent ""cryptographer"" on their team, they should be putting out research notes on the computational security of this tangled web of crypto they are weaving. Maybe its a culture-of-open-source thing, or maybe its a culture-of-science/math thing that i think this way.  People do not understand that assembling cryptography schemes is like engineering, and requires analysis of stability as a consequence. If they are performing these analyses, they should publish their results, and if they are not performing these analyses, they should be. It seems like a lot of people in the cryptocurrency space just want to rush a shiny product out the door that does ALL THE THINGS, from chat to smart securities, but they skip out on making sure they understand what is going on with their tech, and assessing security and stability. It's hubris and it will bite anyone who invests in such a model. Like I said, this is a general criticism of many coins, not just SDC."

CryptoCurrency,37bmtp,Flailing_Junk,2,Tue May 26 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"I think there is a couple of things going on here. For PoW currencies, a lot of them just kind of follow in Bitcoin's footsteps, and implement some kind of halving or other decrease in reward schedule. Why do they do this, and why did the original crypto, BTC, setup their reward system this way?    New coins really only get one (or at most maybe two or three) chances to get it right. If one wants to be taken seriously as a currency, the dev or community can't go around hard forking all the time to change the total money supply, or even the scheduled emission of that money supply. People will, rightfully, just not have any faith that it won't be changed again in the future. So why frontload emission of the money supply?    I think the answer is that you have to entice early miners to keep the network secure. If/when the coin becomes more valuable, then people will still fight to mine for smaller rewards, but in the beginning you need to try and attract lots of miners to support and protect the network from attack, and I guess conventionally this is done by offering the highest rewards for early adopters."
CryptoCurrency,37bmtp,jwinterm,2,Tue May 26 13:31:11 2015 UTC,That makes sense from a perspective of mined currencies. The bigger the reward initially the more early adopters to the currency and the greater chance of success.  Overtime I would assume there will be more alt-coins released that are still cryptocurrencies but use alternative means and methods of coin distribution where less coins initially would make sense but in the case of mined currencies less is not more.

CryptoCurrency,37bmtp,MaxDZ8,1 point,Tue May 26 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"The idea with the initial high rewards is that each unit of crypto is initially of no value.  Value is obtained by having demand, which is supposed to go up over time. Thus block rewards are always ""more or less"" the same real world value. Is this what you're saying?  The idea of regulating emission rate based on demand has some quirks. Technicalities aside, cryptos should get used. It is not something you can give up. If they don't get adopted they don't get to the point so I find it acceptable they go down."

CryptoCurrency,376z82,thieflar,5,Mon May 25 16:41:16 2015 UTC,"Well, a chart says a thousand words. The ""market peg"" which, in theory, should keep BitBTC valued at ~1BTC, actually allows a regular 40-50% deviation from the real asset value.  The most common rebuttal that I've encountered, when I observe this, is ""Oh, well when the volume increases then the pegging mechanism will really start to work!"" which ignores the fact that there is no reason why volume should increase, because Bitassets don't actually present a value proposition besides the illusory market peg itself  The claim is basically, ""Well the market peg doesn't work perfectly right now, but if everyone starts using it, then it might work better"" and if you ask why people should start using it, the answer is ""For the market peg!""  I've concluded that unfortunately Bitshares is basically a convoluted snake-oil pitch. I am certainly willing to be persuaded otherwise, if anyone cares to properly address my concerns, but thus far I've found the community to be irrational and grossly defensive when it comes to serious questions. Which, of course, just reinforces my conclusion."
CryptoCurrency,376z82,thieflar,3,Mon May 25 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. This is pretty much my problem with BitShares assets as well - they claim to be pegged, but there is little to back that claim.  I guess the problem could be solved with more exhange trading the assets for the currency they represent. This could create money loops and smooth out the inefficiencies: buy Bitbtc,  sell it for BTC value +20% in BitShares, sell BTS for BTC at an exchange. Maybe it will work, maybe there is a bootstrapping issue there.  I certainly enjoy the concept behind it, however. If the system was operating as designed, it could be very useful.

You couldn't actually be serious, right??  ...what is a 'video game' without the VIDEO? As implied by the name, not much. As with everything however which has a GUI, there is of course a lot of code in the background for that GUI to control. On the flip side, what's a video game without the game?  Obviously there's far more to a game than a GUI, but games are designed for consumers. Therefore games need to look pretty and be easy to command. Bitcoin mining is no longer aimed for consumers, there is no longer a complaining user base that can't work out how to use it. It doesn't need a GUI.  I still don't know what point you're trying to make by bringing up video games. They have no correlation to the command/GUI comparison being made previously.

This discussion is/was about technical applications for technical users not requiring an interface to operate the application as these users often desire (or require) a more advanced interface which allows for optimisation rather than 'plug-n-play' operation - a mode of operation which a GUI cannot always cater for.  We're not talking about general GPU-using applications requiring a GUI (or not). The GPU side of the discussion is irrelevant beyond the fact we want to optimise shaders etc (the constant being that we want to optimise something, not just gpu-centric factors). On that note, I personally use plenty of applications which use my GPU to process tasks which do use my GPU and dont have (or need) a GUI."

CryptoCurrency,371nzu,WorthGodwin,1 point,Mon May 25 03:26:10 2015 UTC,'holy crap'?
CryptoCurrency,371nzu,WorthGodwin,1 point,Mon May 25 04:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Here's a little on how sidechains work (not an expert, BTW, but have been reading a lot about it).    Basically as I understand it, a sidechain market cap is pegged to the market cap of the parent chain 1-1. This allows for the exact transfer of value from the parent to the side chain and then back again while always maintaining the same value.   So a sidechain currency with 10x the number of coins would end up 1/10th the price per coin compared to the price of BTC, while a coin with 1/10th the number of coins would be 10x the price.    So checking http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/views/all/ for the market cap of Bitcoin and the current number of UNO in existence we get   $ 3,414,572,060 / 195,005 UNO = $17,510 per UNO (!)  Note: the actual price will be set by the market, but the assumption (by Blockstream and others) is that arbitrage will drive the market price up to close to the above once the sidechains are implemented."

CryptoCurrency,371nzu,WorthGodwin,1 point,Mon May 25 05:32:20 2015 UTC,"At this point of my reading:  I don't see how a market cap can be 'pegged' in this way. Market caps are decided by markets -- but that's exactly what you say:  'Note: the actual price will be set by the market . . . '  Isn't that the same as: 'an amount of coins is created (and remains connected in some way to the parent blockchain), then the market decides the value of those new coins. Pegging doesn't enter into it.'"
CryptoCurrency,371nzu,WorthGodwin,1 point,Mon May 25 05:40:24 2015 UTC,"I meant to say ""effectively pegged.""  The way it's explained by Blockstream is that there is a transfer of value that has to be 1 - 1 so the value is always the same on either side of the transfer from parent to sidechain.    The Blockstream guys talk about calculating it in terms of price of bitcoin x total coins / number of sidechain coins, but the math is simpler if you just take the BTC market cap and divide by sidechain coins since you get the same number.    There is a mechanism I don't fully understand yet which allows for the direct transfer outside of a normal exchange (not sure if this will be some kind of decentralized exchange or what), and the rate is determined by the above math and not by the market.   This effectively creates a set price for the sidechain coin and the assumption expressed by the Blockstream guys is that this will cause the market to close the gap in price through arbitrage.   Everything I'm saying is based on reading exhaustively through their IAMA  http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/2k3u97/we_are_bitcoin_sidechain_paper_authors_adam_back/ and watching a couple of interviews with them.

That doesn't mean it will earn you the most profit though, probably the opposite which is why less people are mining it.   Zetacoin for example usually has a total network hash under 5TH/s, so if you had 1TH/s of mining power to yourself you would average finding 1 block every 2-3 minutes or so, but it wouldn't be nearly as profitable as mining bitcoin directly even though with BTC you'd need to join a pool and would only average fractions of a full  reward."

The current statement of Ronny from CCEDK towards Nu is:   We are expecting to be fully up and running with all the features, additional crypto currencies added etc., by the end of June.  Once we are fully done with these tasks we are able to start the return of the outstanding, as we need a fully functional exchange in order to be able to generate income, and it is from this income we will then settle the outstanding. I would like for you all to know that we at CCEDK wish to have this amount settled asap, the circumstances however, allow us now only to do it based on the success we will have introducing new currencies, new features and programs and if you will allow it! - the return of Nubits as an active player on CCEDK once more.

CryptoCurrency,36ei5r,feared_rear_admiral,2,Mon May 18 19:39:48 2015 UTC,What I wanna know is what protections are there to prevent people from just running away with your money? I would offer BTC funds for lending but really don't want to be in the position of having to chase after some anonymous scumbag for my money back and Poloniex just shrug its shoulders.
CryptoCurrency,36ei5r,feared_rear_admiral,3,Tue May 19 07:23:37 2015 UTC,"You lend it to them in them to use in the margin trading platform.  They can't withdraw it.  They'd use it to buy alts.  To borrow 1.5 BTC they need 1 BTC in collateral.  They use it to buy alts.  They might sell if for more and give you your interest.  Or price goes down, they close position and you get your btc back with interest, they lose coins.  That's their risk for borrowing.  If the price drops a lot their position will be force liquidated.  They are required to have 20% maintenance margin.  If they don't have enough they get force liquidated and you get your money plus interest.  They should get a bit of money back.  Basically you have two risks as a lender.  You have to trust poloniex won't close down.    You also have to trust their won't be a sudden drop in the alt.  They get force liquidated after a 20% drop. But they lose all their money after a 40% drop.  You have that cushion.  So your second risk is if the alt suddenly dropped from 20% all the way to past 40% and even then you won't lose everything.  Any questions?"
CryptoCurrency,36ei5r,feared_rear_admiral,1 point,Tue May 19 07:35:07 2015 UTC,"So how much do you think someone can lose when lending BTC, like in the worst case scenario?"
CryptoCurrency,36ei5r,feared_rear_admiral,2,Tue May 19 07:45:40 2015 UTC,how much do you think the alt will drop?  It would have to drop almost 20% first.  And then it'll have to drop another 20%+ instantly.  So how far do you think it could possibly drop instantly?  Based on that I can get you a worst case scenario.
CryptoCurrency,36ei5r,boredtech2014,1 point,Tue May 19 07:54:33 2015 UTC,"No, what I mean is even if it does drop by 40%, what happens to me in that situation? Also, do you lend specifically to be used to buy a certain alt or can you just lend BTC without specifying that? Like it's not really my problem what the borrower does with it as long as they return it with interest."
CryptoCurrency,36ei5r,warproxxx,1 point,Tue May 19 09:21:47 2015 UTC,"nope you don't specify an alt.  See you have to realize its about instantly dropping.  Without any trades in between.  Poloniex is using more developed coins so I don't think this is a big worry.  So once it starts dropping after the -20% from when the person bought the alt, poloniex will try to close the position to get BTC back.  If they're able to close before -40% then you'll be able to get your BTC back.  Otherwise there you'll have a loss.  If it drops another 20% after -40% you get a 20% loss.  Basically you should be getting your interest."

CryptoCurrency,36bao4,rnicoll,3,Tue May 19 11:17:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't, which is kind of why it's gone nowhere in about 5 months. It's good enough for transactions between reasonably trusted individuals, and given the difficulty in actually modifying TXes it's probably good enough for low value transactions generally, but personally I think waiting for a full TX malleability fix on Bitcoin and then on other blockchains is the best solution.  I know others are looking at having each side put up collateral, so both parties lose money if the TXes are modified, but that gives you a bootstrapping issue (both sides need both coins to put up collateral with)."

Bitcoin payment processors, most of whom do automated settlement to fiat ARE money transmitters, as are exchanges.  Most of these American companies are already registered and licensed as money transmitters.  Putting some rules and regulations around them helps protect the consumer AND merchant.  As an owner of a crypto related business myself, I welcome any kind of clear direction that doesn't prohibit or stifle the use of cryptocurrencies because it allows us to know where we stand and what we need to do obey by the laws instead of paying lawyers hour after hour to pontificate on whether some activity is illegal or not.  Did you really think cryptocurrencies were doing to rise to mass acceptance without any regulation?"
CryptoCurrency,35wbbb,02bluesuperroo,2,Thu May 14 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"With crypto's being only six years old, startups are, at the margin, not well capitalized.  Provisions in House Bill 289 require crypto processors to have a net worth of at least $250,000, among other provisions that are not conducive to the promulgation of a six-year-old industry. Without meeting these onerous requirements, a company will not be considered for a license, let alone be approved in North Carolina.  H289 stifles innovation by regulating crypto companies as money transmitters. Barriers to entry re: business capital in North Carolina would go from $0 to $250,000.   There are other ways to regulate crypto. H289 is the wrong way."
CryptoCurrency,35wbbb,02bluesuperroo,1 point,Thu May 14 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"You're over-generalizing saying this stifles ""crypto companies"" when the bill clearly targets payment processors specifically (and presumably exchanges).  We're starting to get to the point where there is enough maturity in the industry to say that as a merchant and consumer, I wouldn't trust exchanging funds or processing payments through a company that didn't have a ""net worth"" of $250k.  For instance, Bitstamp would be long gone if they didn't have a net worth of $250k when they were hacked back in January and yet another major exchange would have been in the news having lost $5m of their customer's money (mine and yours).  I understand where you're coming from and I also fear that this could stifle a small time, bootstrapped startup altcoin payment processor or exchange.  Unfortunately I feel that this is one of those ""growing pains"" and is going to be an essential step, and an inevitable one, in moving Bitcoin into the mainstream in the US and western Europe.  This will provide the Bitcoin network with the kind of financial investment that will give it the liquidity backbone and subsequently price stability that is needed for it to support ""the unbanked"" effectively.    I know the purists will probably never agree with me on this and I can certainly respect that position and sometimes I even second guess it but it's the eventual conclusion I keep coming to."

It will be developed by the same established team that has directed Peercoin and NuBits development, a group that includes well-known cryptocurrency experts such as Jordan Lee and sigmike. The experienced team of over ten contributors has successfully led three prior projects (Peercoin, NuBits, NuShares) into the top twenty-five assets by market cap on coinmarketcap.com.   This will be the first decentralized exchange that can be owned by its traders, with Bitcoin dividends distributed from transaction fees paid on the exchange. I'm very much looking forward to seeing this project succeed."
CryptoCurrency,35lh1s,NuTomJoad,3,Mon May 11 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"B&C has the potential of a game changer. Centralized exchanges are often opaquely owned by anonymous people, have all users' fund stored in stealable places, and could disappear or be shutdown overnight. MtGox-type of event could happen to any of existing exchanges and there is little the users could do about it.  All those who don't trust their money to centralized exchanges will love to have almost automated exchanges. B&C with Nubits liquidity operation will offer decentralized , almost trustless, and liquid service on many pairs of cryptocurrencies.  A baseline volume is almost guaranteed given how much the crypto community like to trade and how often it is burned by centralized exchange accidents. Blockshares have reasonablly good earning prospect."
CryptoCurrency,35lh1s,mhps,4,Mon May 11 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"My vision for b&c is that if it is successful, b&c will become the first decentralized stocks market place in the world. Imagine the revolution. On b&c not only btc and other crypto-currencies will be traded but also any crypto-assets that are ""Satoshi-based."" I have of course in mind all the crypto-shares that are based on peershares' blueprint. Not only we can imagine that nushares will be traded on b&c, but also its own shares, b&c shares, and any shares that belong to any DAOs. The consequence of that is that b&c could spark a revolution in the IPO funding of any business. A business that needs to raise funds will create its own peershares blockchain and then go IPO from day one and float its shares on b&c. Also, as jordan lee envisions it, it seems natural that nubits will be used to get in and out of the market...as a synthetic dollar as you use dollars to buy google stocks and sell them for dollars...

Unfortunately, there are also plenty of thieves, con artists, and dreamers distracting from the true advances in Bitcoin’s evolution.  At this point, anyone with financial skin in the game should be leery of investing in undelivered promises.  The Peercoin track of development stands out in my mind as a veritable leader in innovation, foresight, and meticulous deployment.  Jordan Lee, sigmike, and erasmospunk have proven talent in advancing the ground-breaking work of Sunny King.  If you haven’t taken the time to evaluate the opportunities in Peershares and NuBits you haven’t performed due diligence in the industry and shouldn’t be investing in cryptocurrencies.  Jordan Lee has demonstrated himself capable not only of professional development but of true commitment to solving the fundamental roadblocks in world-wide adoption of decentralized finance.  Instead of pumping a trend for a quick buck, Jordan has joined Sunny King in constructing a legacy for our children that is both fair and resilient.  What other examples in history do we have of true intellectual treasure being openly distributed into the hands of the community?  Having solved volatility and liquidity in NuBits, Jordan and his team are moving ahead to cure the other black eye of Bitcoin - centralized exchanges.  As one of many who have suffered great losses through exchange collapse, I cannot be more certain that this is the vital next advance the democratization of money.  Personally, my cryptocurrency assets are out of the economy until something like B&C exchange is up and running.  In my mind, the tradition of security and fairness that lives on with Peercoin carries through to this auction.  It’s hard to imagine a less risky investment in the cryptocurrency space simply because one has here the opportunity to bid on a proven asset at possibly below market value.  Although I have no doubt about the capacity of Jordan, Sigmike, and erasmospunk to deliver on their promises, a winning bid in this auction immediately conveys value through the direct ownership of the NuShares.  Aquiring NuShares though this bid may be your last opportunity to build a sizable stake in the Nu network irrespective of the eventual success of B&C.   If, for some reason, you maintain no interest in a long-term investment in NuShares you should at least take heed of the success of NuBits over the past 9 months in upholding 1:1 USD parity against extremely deep volume through periods of extremely rapid BTC/USD volatility.  Jordan Lee promised a stable cryptocurrency, and he delivered on schedule.  Furthermore, he continues to demonstrate his perseverance in accepting criticism, learning from mistakes, and building the future as a full team effort with some of the leading innovators in cryptocurrency.  Bidding on NuShares through this auction is your opportunity to enable the freedom of us all -for the first time in modern history- to store wealth and engage in commerce liberated from centralized power.  If you own Bitcoin, you should be bidding on this proposal."""

So, if a miner crams a bunch of transactions into a block to reap tx fees, they can end up costing themselves some block reward (I think).

If anything it will serve as a roadmap for SDC and other teams because there was no comparison done. They have publically announced the marketplace but not features however we know it uses bitmessage so in reality it has to be something like openbazaar.. Most or the stuff in the article is valid about sdc except the features.. I'm sure they are either working on trustless escrow and now probably know where to focus their efforts next.

CryptoCurrency,354d6q,marior012,1 point,Fri May 8 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"The Mercury thread is from February this year and B&C is even younger. So they are both quite young and I don't wonder that you haven't heard of them. Both are based on very promising technologyies, though, which should be considered in an article titled ""today's decentralized marketplace technology"" ;)    Very briefly my take is:    While Mercury is a free software that allows atomic cross-chain transactions it currently requires a central orderbook and suffers from transaction malleability (which can be handled once OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is implemented). It's an impressive approach for providing an elegant (mostly) decentralized marketplace.    B&C Exchange is designed as a DAC that operates completely decentralized. There's no central orderbook. There are no central ressources. Even the orderbook is provided by the B&C block chain.  Transaction malleability is no problem, because there are no cross-chain transactions.    Before I go into too much detail or interpret parts of the two concepts wrongly, I recommend to have a look at these two yourself. Both are very promising!    The funding for B&C is going on for 5 more days. After those 5 days we'll know whether there's enough money to fund the development for that DAC ($200,000 required for that)."

To give the currency value the thought is to arrange a payment method  using said alt coin for the retailers to purchase (Sell in the future) said E-Juice. This is a rough thought, however what gives worthless money value is a mutual agreement it is valuable, and he has good Relationships with all shops his Juice is sold in. As far as credentials and the actual programming of said coin, that is why I have yet to release it. This is a rough business idea to make an Altcoin actually based on a commodity.

CryptoCurrency,35294b,Anouther,9,Wed May 6 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"Dude, I was in the same boat.  Bitcoin has helped me so much in getting back on my feet and avoiding the bank overdraft charges that got me into the homeless situation in the first place.  Another advantage is that Bitcoin also allowed me to save because the coins were not easily exchanged to fiat.  It made small purchases(cigarettes, something cold/hot to drink) non-existent, and it is amazing how much little items like that add up.    But, like others have recommended.  An android device(craigslist $30) will be your best bet.  Install Mycellium and you can begin storing your coins there.  Mycellium also has a ""local trader"" feature where you can trade your fiat you have accumulated into Bitcoin.  And, vice versa.  Hope that helps."

You get behind a little, then a little more, then slammed with charges you didn't expect, then they compound, then you're back even further, then you spend all your money trying to catch back up, then you lose your job, then you miss rent, then you bow out of your lease, then your sleeping on your friend's sofa, then you care too much not to ruin your relationship with your friend, then you hit the road.  So, maybe not overdraft charges exclusively, but definitely did not make the situation any easier."

That's not digital currency; that's bullshit.  Digital currencies replace cash.  They want to know how I ""invest"" my coin.  I do not.  I exchange Bitcoins for goods or services based, not on the current value of the Bitcoin in US or Canadian dollars, but on the value of that good or service in BTC that I, and the buyer/seller, agree upon.  If anything, this is money as it was originally used; it is business as it was originally done.  It is a social interaction; and it is one of those crucial social interactions that link us, that bind us, we are in a business relationship.  And that's why I think Grantcoin's mission statement is enthralling.  It is the social implications of digital currency that are real and lasting; not the potential for ""investment returns."""

It's straight-forward (in as much as it's a recipe-following process, but still long and fiddly to do the first time) to copy an existing currency and modify it. If you want to write a new currency, it's considered a research area - you should be comfortable with PhD-level work (this does not in any way mean having a PhD, which is training for a specific career path, but you should be capable of doing one).  If you just want to copy Bitcoin, a good book on C++ would be your starting point, and likely then learning Python instead as it's a less painful introduction to coding."

CryptoCurrency,346o95,02bluesuperroo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"Check here for how your hashing power stacks up with other scrypt hardware.  You might have to look up any available scrypt asics separately (if there are any out yet, I haven't been following closely enough for the last 6 months or so).  https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison  As far as mining, the best pool to use (IMO) is one that mines multiple coins depending on what is most profitable.  They call these multipools but I am in no position to suggest or recommend one so hopefully someone else will chime in.  I have used several in the past but I don't want to put myself out there in case any of them have been corrupted or are otherwise unfavorable to use. You should do some separate research on that.   The main advantage of a multipool is you don't have to worry about what coin to mine, you just worry about keeping your miner running :P  You can also set yourself up with certain altcoin exchanges where they will auto-exchange the altcoins to BTC for you but, again, I'm not going to mention any names."

CryptoCurrency,33yu76,obavijest,3,Sun Apr 26 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"For CPU only: cpucoinlist I think monero is usually the most profitable to mine. You really need a CPU that has AES-NI for it to be worth mining anything tho (newer i3s and i7s should all have support for it, check intel/amd's specs on their website to see if your CPU supports it). You can still mine without AES-NI, but it will be A LOT slower.  For GPUs whattomine.com is my go to site.    I usually stick with DGB and MYR, both are multi algorithm coins, you might be able to CPU mine them using the groestl algorithm too. X11 (ie dashcoin) is another one that can sort of still be CPU mined, although you'll need to use a pool with a low minimum payout to actually make anything.  Another good option if you only have a lower end gpu or cpu is staking. Reddcoin, blackcoin, and ultracoin, to name a few off the top of my head, all have proof of stake mining."

CryptoCurrency,33ohjx,SMACz42,2,Fri Apr 24 05:16:52 2015 UTC,"Comparative advantage:       The theory of comparative advantage is an economic theory about the potential gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations that arise from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress.  In an economic model, an agent has a comparative advantage over another in producing a particular good if he can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade.  One does not compare the monetary costs of production or even the resource costs (labor needed per unit of output) of production. Instead, one must compare the opportunity costs of producing goods across countries.  The closely related law or principle of comparative advantage holds that under free trade, an agent will produce more of and consume less of a good for which he has a comparative advantage.

Unfortunately most if not all cloud mining companies have turned out to be scams, they use whois guarded websites hiding their identity from you, they have no telephone number, No address, using referral bonuses to attract new people daily so they can pass generated bitcoins around from one person to another until they have made enough money to run away with yours and others investments. Yet, these places make thousands of hard earned BTC from people like you. People looking for the answer as to how they can make a recurring income of Bitcoins and know their investment is safe and secure.  I have watched many forums and other communities, and I have built EXACTLY what everyone wanted, I built the first of it's kind cloud mining solution based upon YOUR needs, and I have corrected ALL the problems you have with all other cloud mining companies.  www.stakeminers.com, is a business that a group of coin miners has been testing, and putting together for months, to bring you a perfect solution to all the things you hate most about other mining sites, and your solution to all the lies from cloud mining services we have today, A way you can finally say goodbye to the 60% to 80% maintenance fees cloud mining services charge you, a way you can finally know you will be able to make profit from your bitcoin investment. And not just a profit, but increased profits over time rather than decreased profits with rises in electric costs and rises in coin difficulty.  No more excuses, no more lies, no more crap and run around, why pay someone to try and earn Bitcoins when they are just going to take the biggest share of your profit and earnings in fees, we have eliminated all of these out of our program.  We are not Whois Guarded, Our address is on the website, and our telephone number is available, we have direct emails to contact us thru, and for investors who provide substantial investments I have no problem providing other contact details, as with any real investment it would be required anyways. We have no reason to hide, we built a very strong, highly profitable business where we don't have to offer a referral reward because the referral bonuses are already hard coded into the structure of the business. We do not have 1 way you can earn higher profits, we don't have 2 ways, we have many ways your investment is backed up, and is able to bring you in higher profits without the need to reinvest.  HOW DOES THIS BENEFIT YOU  At https://stakeminers.com What we do is a lot like all other mining pools, you are buying Staking power. Once you have made your payment we then trade whatever coin you used to invest with us and we buy coins we can stake on. As with most Mining pools or Cloud Mining services your investment represents a percentage of mining power. At Stakeminers.com however, you will never have maintenance fees, you will not have payout fees lowering your returns, in fact the difficulty will not even decrease your investment like other mining pools and cloud mining services. You will literally be able to increase your income without investing more ever. By combining coins into one wallet, we enable investors the ability to stake more frequently at a higher rate of return on each stake. Like regular mining, Stake Mining has blocks that give rewards, the more blocks you find the more rewards you receive, the difference tho is in Stake Mining your rewards are larger and more frequent than like regular mining. By holding a large volume of coins in one wallet you stake more frequently and you stake much higher amounts, giving you returns that sometimes are bigger than hardware mining and certainly larger than any other Cloud Mining service out there.  For a full run down on how the system works we have a complete HOW IT WORKS page you can see how it is we can continue to earn you increased profits over time. You can see how it was all put together in our ABOUT Page We even protected your investment from those nasty little DDOS attack excuses. We dont need to worry about a DDOS attack as the wallets involved are not on the website servers, they are on a connection safely away from your common hacker threats. SO even if our site comes under a DDOS attack your investment is secure and protected away from their greedy little programming fingers. Everything we do is all Manual for your protection, this is why accounts are updated at least once every 24 hours. But your investment is time stamped and you get credit for your earning form the time you have made your investment.  You wanted it and now it is here, everything you desire, all your needs, everything you wanted from a Cloud Mining Service and more all in one single little website."

CryptoCurrency,33dnrz,dogtkd520,9,Tue Apr 21 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"You like to start with easy questions don't you...  Okay, I'm going to focus on Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies, for the sake of my sanity. Others can hopefully provide good references on Counterparty, Maidsafe, Monero and others.  At the core of a cryptocurrency is the blockchain, which is a huge ledger of all transactions which have taken place, and how the funds from the transaction can be unlocked. Each full node (as opposed to lite or ""SPV"" nodes) keeps a copy of this ledger. So, when I say ""I want to send 50,000 DOGE to <address>"", my client creates a transaction specifying the transaction it takes those Dogecoins from, that the funds are to be locked by the keys matching the address I've given, and that any remainder goes to an address I own (referred to as a ""change address""). My client then cryptographically signs the transactions with the key or keys matching the input transactions, and sends the signed transaction to the network for relaying.  The network then confirms the keys match the input transactions, and relays the transaction onwards. So far, so good.  What if I try sending two transactions at the same time, paying the same coins to different people? How does the network know which happened first, and therefore who gets the coins and which transaction is rejected? This is where blocks come in - each block is sequential (they happen one after another, in order), and that sequence is the block chain. By attaching transactions to a block (which is ordered), an ordering is inferred onto the transactions. However, to ensure that blocks are not created at-will, but at a relatively steady pace, and that no single entity controls creation of blocks, there needs to be something to limit the block rate.  For Bitcoin-like proof of work coins, this involves trying to find a value which when inserted into the block header, results in an SHA256 hash of the block header below a target value (the difficulty). This process is mathematically hard, and essentially if you think of the nonce value as a lottery ticket, you get the idea of any single value being correct. However, modern hardware can try millions or more of these values every second, so the chances of any single value being a match has to be very low (and so the difficulty target is low). This difficulty value is recalculated on the fly (varying from every minute for coins using Digishield, to weeks for Bitcoin) based on how quickly blocks are being found.  This way, the chances of any entity finding the next block is directly proportionate to the mining power they have (i.e. if you have 10% of the power, you will typically find 10% of the blocks).  That good enough for a start?"

CryptoCurrency,33dnrz,MathAndFerrets,2,Wed Apr 22 02:39:35 2015 UTC,If you want to get more into details you could check out the paper Bitcoin was based on: Bitcoin PDF
CryptoCurrency,33dnrz,stampmate,2,Wed Apr 22 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"Something really important to understand about bitcoin is a 'Hash value'.   A Hash value is a string of seemingly random numbers and letters, which you get by performing an algorithm on a set of information. The really clever thing about hashes, is that you can input any amount of information, and always get the same number of digits in you hash value (there are different algorithms which give different length hash values, different coins use different algorithms.). This means you can hash a single letter, or a 10,000 word thesis, or an image, or any set of data at all, and get a hash value of the same length. The same input information will always give the same output hash value. There is no way to predict what the hash value will be based on the input, nor to reverse the algorithm to find the original input from the hash value.  Hashes are useful for a lot of reasons, including obscuring information, and making it easily verifiable. Eg if I write a Will, and hash it, no one can tamper with or change the will, not even an extra space or punctuation correction, because the hash of the new one will be completely and unpredictably different from the original. That makes it very easy to verify later that this is the exact same document, to the letter.  So how does bitcoin use Hashes  I'll try to use broad strokes, because bitcoin is extremely complex:  Bitcoin code looks at a set of transactions, verify that they are legitimate (private and public keys match, as explain in another comment, and that there is enough bitcoin recorded at that address to be transfered to another), and package them into a 'Block'. They then add the Hash value of the previous block, and an arbitrary number called a nonce which I'll explain later. They then hash this information to get a new hash value.   That hash value is then included in the next Block, the next set of transactions, creating a chain of Blocks, hence 'The Blockchain'. There is no way to alter any previous transactions in previous blocks, because that would change the hash value of that block, which is used in the next and the next and the next, and would completely change the hash value of the latest block, easily alerting anyone that something was wrong.  Each block is supposed to represent the transactions that occurred over a certain amount of time. In bitcoin that time is 10 minutes, other coins have different 'Block Times'.  Because the calculation is actually really easy for a computer, there needs to be a way to regulate that timing. This is where the Nonce comes in (which I mentioned earlier).  The Nonce is a random number added to the transactions and previous blocks hash, which will completely change the resulting Hash value when hashed. The Bitcoin code requires that a Block hash begin and end with a certain number of zeros. By altering the nonce, you get a new hash, and through trying many thousands of nonces, eventually you find one that has the correct number of zeros. When you find it, you broadcast the nonce to the rest of the network also looking for the right nonce, who can easily check if it is correct. The network takes a vote to say if it is correct, if 51% of the miners agree it is correct, whoever found it receives a 'Block Reward' and the process begins again, with that hash as the new starting input. This means that if you control 51% of the mining power, you can win the vote with fraudulent information, this is called a 51% Attack, and it has occurred on many coins.  The people doing this are called Miners. They have special computer equipment running the bitcoin mining code, in a race to find the correct hash first. As equipment gets faster, and more people start mining, the speed at which they find the right nonce and hash increases, so to maintain the 10 minute block time, the Difficulty, the number of zeros required, increases automatically. The Miners do all this in the hopes of winning the Block Reward, which comes in the form of a set bounty of bitcoins, and an optional tax that people add to their transactions. As time goes on, the bounty decreases, eventually being eliminated, which means no more coins will be created. This is why people call it a deflationary currency; eventually there will be no new supply of coins. When that happens the only income for miners will be the tax from transactions. We just have to hope that that tax still provides enough incentive for miners to continue their work.  In this way transactions are recorded and verified, and locked into the block chain by massive amounts of computational power. To alter a transaction, you would need to redo all the work of the whole network. Because it is all run through code, is almost impossible to defraud, relies on distributed communal agreement, and has no middle man, it creates a very interesting base for a currency, although it is as yet far from perfect.  TL;DR Miners take the previous block hash, add transactions occurring since the last block, and a random number called a nonce, then hash it all to try to get a hash value that fits certain rules. If it doesnt, they change the nonce and try again, over and over until someone finds a nonce that produces a hash value that fits the rules. If 51% of the network agrees, they get a reward, and the process begins again.  EDIT Jesus thats a giant wall of text"

CryptoCurrency,33by3h,mrjoef,3,Tue Apr 21 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"It still BLOWS MY MIND that some jerk off with a highschool diploma and virtually no marketable skills can still join the police force, do a horrible job serving the public & still net $70-90K- Which is considerably more than many college graduates & average to upper level private jobs that require actual skills. The equilibrium of compensation in the private sector vs public jobs must be more out of whack now than it has ever been before. Seriously this schmuck would probably be making $12-15 an hour in the private sector yet as a douche bag cop, $30-45 an hour no problem. And most of them still treat their tax-paying employers like scum. I bet most are just too dumb to realize the people whom they fear, resent and harass on a daily basis are the ones who pay their salary. If we are paying so much we should at least expect higher standards and accountability. How often do cops do some dumb shit that costs tax payers hundreds of thousands of dollars and still return to work. That type of nonsense just does not exist in the private sector because it is irrational and unsustainable. Hell even our soldiers who spend months in war zones risking their lives for our national security still only make like $15-35K!.. For $70-90K we should have officers who are nice, helpful and who can act intelligently in stressful situations. What we mostly have now is a bunch of asshole egomaniacs, some of whom just looking for an opportunity to shoot someone. Then they will high five each other and joke around while your bleed out, handcuffed on the ground & waiting for the ambulance to show up."
CryptoCurrency,33by3h,Clint_Beastwood_,5,Tue Apr 21 19:48:52 2015 UTC,Every police officer job posting ive seen you need at least a 2 year degree so idk what your talking about. You need a 4 year to be state police where im from. From the local cops I know most have psychology degrees and had to become police officers because that was the only job around that they could get.
CryptoCurrency,33by3h,SirNLeo,0,Tue Apr 21 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"Well that would be a positive direction but I know that it hasn't been the norm. Most do not have degrees. In fact there are even some departments that have purposefully hired low IQ candidates only. Not sure if this is still their SOP but it has happened & was in the news. My main point this is a traditionally low-skill requirement job and all of a sudden the compensation is better than most private sector jobs that require a college degree. At the same time there are virtually no performance metrics for being a ""good cop"" outside of revue generation and there is also little to no accountability for abuse or poor performance. So on that hand their standards are abysmally low. But their compensation, benefits and retirement pensions? Those have eclipsed most of whats available in the private sector."

Unlike your backwoods neighborhood, $90K is basically ""average"". What's wrong with making a decent living wage? He puts his life on the line every day. What do you do, push a few buttons in an air-conditioned office? He's still innocent until proven guilty. It's completely possible that he's the ""fall guy"" for the real thief. I mean, it's New Jersey.   But this takes the cake:   That type of nonsense just does not exist in the private sector because it is irrational and unsustainable.   Do you know how much private security personnel demand in wages? No, you probably don't, because you think they're all rent-a-cops working in strip malls or guarding residential storage lockers. The real private cops are the ones who carry real guns and are trained just like public police officers.

CryptoCurrency,33by3h,theirmoss,0,Tue Apr 21 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"1- He was caught in a sting, I highly doubt he is innocent. Btw I live in Boston, one of the highest avg incomes in the country. And yeah I am familar with Jersey I have been through many parts, not just the turnpike. There are some nice ones but most of it is a steaming shitpile..  2nd- I am a sys admin for a financial institution, so yeah I ""push a few buttons"", also do advanced troubleshooting, development, testing & some client management stuff.. I should be making a lot more than I am but since I was hired like 3 years ago they have been on a perpetual rebound from '09 and no one in the company has experienced job growth since, no raises, bonuses, promotions, nothing.. So as a recent grad who struggled for months to find work I just kind of stuck with it for the experience & I also happen to highly dislike the fruitless grind of the job search so perhaps its my own fault I don't make more. But just as relevant are the environmental conditions of the job market. And btw the sentence you referenced was in relation to officers causing millions of dollars in legal fees to the state & then staying on the job. That is fucking retarded. If I lost my company $1,000,000 I would be fire in a heartbeat. They would say get the fuck out of here and never come back. Bad cops routinely cost taxpays millions of dollars for their personal misconduct while on the job and they usually stay on the job. THAT is what would never exist in the private sector. For the record I fully believe in paying living wages & just compensation but I think in comparison to the private sector & even the military our police officers are compensated so highly that they should all walk around with a giant fucking smile on their face and a firm sense of duty to their taxpayers."

They have the thin blue line where they look out for eachother- from little stuff like driving each other home if they get caught drunk driving(yeah I have some cop friends I know this is routine), to potentially more serious shit like helping your partner plant a weapon after you shoot someone in the back unjustly. Sound familiar? yeah it just happened. But Hell I'd say for $70-90k cops should have a permanent smile fixed to their fucking faces and act happy to run into you. That should be a job requirement for that level compensation. Or they could just make $15k and get shipped off the Afghanistan or some other war-zone for a year. I'm sure it's safer for them over there. Actually they might be dissatisfied once they learn there are more conditional restrictions for  shooting at terrorist than there are for shooting at unarmed American citizens."

CryptoCurrency,32wwqq,frankenmint,7,Fri Apr 17 11:53:06 2015 UTC,"Edit: somehow i got the impression that this was an image post, hadnt read it writing the below.   Sidechains: Basically lightweight-clients on a blockchain. They do not provide secure decentralized scalability, as each chain still needs to be secure individually, and merged mining would only make knowing all chains the economic and decentralized for mines.  As i understand it, if a side-chain is compromised, Bitcoin doesnt care, and just hums along, coins involved in side-chain could end up anywhere. Colored coins: In bitcoin, each transaction specifies input older blockchain entries with solutions to the  and specifies ""a puzzle"" for outputs.  Following a sequence of puzzles ""follows coin"". Now, you could say ""lets agree these coins are special now"", and behave that way. It is overly complex if you ask me. Ethereum: Improves on bitcoin in a bunch of ways. It does not have the inputs and outputs system, instead if keeps a state. Each person simply has a balance.  This also allows it to have contracts, which are basically little programs that run when you send messages to them, and that can then send messages in turn.(messages can have ethers) Another innovation is the ""gas"" which makes sure the programs dont use too much CPU/memory.  Counterparty used the pyethereum to have the same contract thingy in there. Eris also uses the technology. It is likely that these contracts might be portable between different kinds of blockchain, where different blockchains may have different strengths and weaknesses. IMO it is wise to make sure that new blockchains can use these contracts, because then anything made on Ethereum may apply to you, and vice-versa.  Another important thing Ethereum did is that it is very much a platform. Anyone can make contracts, and they have a browser with JS bindings so you can make good interfaces too.   The other ones i cant explain properly enough. Believe stuff like Mastercoin/counterparty works ontop using data on the blocks, and having logic about validity. However, unlike whole-blockchain solutions, invalidity does not keep things off blocks that way. (not that this is particularly harmful) (I like Ethereum)   Shameless plug, Hanging blocks.. Basically ""a light clients brings in the bits that are wrong in a block to disqualify it."" It has the ""data availability"" weakness, if you dont have the bits, you cannot prove the bits are in a block, and prove that a block is invalid, and should be disqualified. Only the ""root"", counter-proofs, whatever protects data availability, and some data managing the thing has to be on Ethereum.  It is probably possible to make Hanging blocks that can mostly use plain Ethereum contracts ontop.   Hmm ""light client"" here means that a Merkle-proof-like thing is used."
CryptoCurrency,32wwqq,Jasper1984,2,Fri Apr 17 14:57:02 2015 UTC,you may want to seperate these into individual posts. lol.
CryptoCurrency,32wwqq,target0,2,Fri Apr 17 12:32:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, here is my take:  Sidechains is a protocol to move Bitcoin value onto and back out of what would otherwise be an Altcoin.  The Bitcoin value can then be exchanged using different rules, like faster block times, different cryptography, different privacy, etc.  Heck, someone could even build in AML and KYC.  The real trick is the Bitcoin value can move back out of a sidechain back into Bitcoin.  Colored Coins  are about how you can trade assets other than Bitcoin using Bitcoin.  With the right protocol, you can track Bitcoin from a ""Genesis Transaction"" then through many Bitcoin transactions.  Since every transaction mixes all its inputs, you have to have rules about how Bitcoin goes into and out again.  Factom is about creating a data layer over the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Users can create their own chains, and place entries into these chains which are just data.  Factom collects all the data submitted, creates a Merkle root, and stores this into Bitcoin (as an anchor) every 10 minutes.   Thus over time, users can put data into Factom, and can prove all that data is properly stored with proofs that run to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Factoids align the incentives within the network, but are an Appcoin which enables the application.  Ethereum is a cryptocurrency with a Turing Complete scripting engine, very fast block times, and many other innovations.  It targets smart contracts, smart properties, distributed trading, and more.  Generally applications that need very smart validation.  Omni is a protocol that is very much like Colored Coins.  Mastercoin was the first meta protocol allowing all sorts of different financial transactions than Bitcoin supports all on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Mastercoin later rebranded to Omni.  Synero is a distributed social network where you get rewarded tokens for contributions.  They have a token that aligns incentives and allows the network to be completely decentralized and autonomous.  Bonus:  Counterparty is a fork of the Mastercoin/Omni protocol.  They have had a great deal of success through more aggressive development and deployment for a number of applications."

However, you are entirely correct that it is not a permanent long-term solution, as inflation would cripple the currency.
