AdvancedRunning,3e4idx,eiqht,4,Tue Jul 21 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"My PT always said that tightness in one part of your leg can create problems in a totally different part. I had hamstring problems when I was seeing him and he had me roll out every part of my legs. (Especially the calves.) That wasn't preventative, though--I already had the injuries. I know that I've read that foam rolling might not be the best idea for an entire training cycle, but is more for the end of a cycle when you're working up to a goal race. I'm not sure how that would apply to an XC season--maybe use it lightly during the summer when you're building your base but use it more aggressively in season?  I personally think that if you diligently use your foam roller once or twice a week on key parts of your legs like calves, quads, and IT bands, you'll save yourself a lot of headaches down the road, but I do think you can overuse it. The definition of overuse probably differs between people but I find that if I use it three days in a row on a certain spot, even one that's injured, the pain turns from ""good"" to bad."
AdvancedRunning,3e4idx,ForwardBound,3,Tue Jul 21 23:24:53 2015 UTC,"Also how ""soft"" should foam rollers be?  I have one fairly soft one, and one pretty hard one, and I don't know which one to use."
AdvancedRunning,3e4idx,zororod123,2,Tue Jul 21 23:27:59 2015 UTC,"I use different rollers depending on how my body feels and what I'm rolling out. If it hurts too much I'll switch to the softer roller, if I want to dig in deep and work out some issue I use my nobbly hard roller."

I've been more consistent with stretching, getting the calves, hamstrings, hip flexors, and quads before bed most nights.  Last week I got a Roll Recovery R8 which is pricey but really helps get the hamstrings and quads. I've been pretty happy with it so far, using it multiple times a day. Somehow it just seems easier or more convenient to use than the big foam roller. Also, it came with a piece of paper with a little blurb about the employee who packaged it up - he's a 2:14 marathoner. Wow!"
AdvancedRunning,3e4idx,runwithpugs,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:27:44 2015 UTC,"I use it once a week, usually when my legs feel super tired. For me, more than once or twice a week feels unnecessary. I agree with more use during the season.   Personally, I don't have any links for technique, I use a soft roller and a pvc pipe  when I want a deeper massage (works surprisingly great if you're on a budget).  Also, rolling the night before important races helps me sleep better and takes away the fear of a potential injury during the race. I used to have a lot of IT band issues before I started using one, it definetely help mitigate injuries all over my legs."

AdvancedRunning,3e2i7c,kevinmnola,5,Tue Jul 21 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"My first thought was that if you got up to 45 mpw, you could probably do more mileage during your HM training. Maybe add in a few miles a week and peak around 55 mpw.  It also seems weird to do a 5k time trial and your longest long run just three days apart. Most plans usually have a weekend tune-up race a few weeks out, even if it means dropping or shortening a weekend long run. Also, a 5k might be a little too short to give you a good gauge of your HM fitness. I think a 10k time trial would be more useful."
AdvancedRunning,3e2i7c,kevinmnola,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that's fair. I could probably bump it up a bit in the couple of weeks prior. Good shout with the TT too.

I might move the TT forward a week and make it a bit longer and then keep that last long run as it is.

AdvancedRunning,3dzfzl,JoshBlatchford,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:46 2015 UTC,I'm considering wearing this for my marathon this fall. I've done a few workouts in it and love the cushion over the longer distances.   One thing I think that Adidas did well is the colorways. In the store I work at I've sold three or four pairs as casual walking around shoes to people just looking for something stylish.
AdvancedRunning,3dzfzl,CatzerzMcGee,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about the Adios Boost. It doesn't look all that different from my current Energy Boost ESM's. Is is really that much more of a race shoe? My current race shoe is a Mizuno Wave Hitogami, which is fine for half marathons, but I'd be reluctant to go any further in it.  Funny you mention colors. I'm addicted to the Energy Boost, but the colors at my local running store are always hideous. I have several worn-out pairs in my closet that I can't bring myself to wear casually."
AdvancedRunning,3dzfzl,White_Lobster,4,Tue Jul 21 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"For having gone through two pairs of each, the Adios boost 2 is definitely the better shoe. It's lighter, has a much better formed heel (at least for me) and fits better overall.  I ran all my road races up to marathon distance in the Adios boost 2 for the past year, including two sub-3 marathons at Chicago and Boston. Definitely a great fast shoe for people who like the fit of the Adidas."

Ended up doing 10.05 miles (16.2K) in 55:20 for 5:29/mile average. I like using kilometers instead of miles during longer workouts because I get more feedback during the session. I took a GU at 11k in just to practice getting nutrition down while running race pace. All in all, a good confidence booster!

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,3,Mon Jul 20 18:20:38 2015 UTC,Did you have a waterstop or anything to help get the GU down?  I feel like once I get that far into a run things are starting to get a little dry and thicker GU is tough to get down.  For that reason I started experimenting with power gel since it is a little more 'liquidy.'
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CatzerzMcGee,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:32 2015 UTC,Nope I just carried it in my shorts pocket until 11K then took it over the remaining 5k. Instead of taking it all in one go I did small portions each 1k. Have you tried Honey Stinger? Their stuff is a bit more smooth and liquid like compared to GU.
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,callthebluff,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"I use PowerGels. They are definitely more liquidy, but I still prefer to take them with water as they still have that gel-like texture that lingers in the mouth."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"I can't take a whole gu either.  I take about 1/3, wash it down with water, take another 1/3 to swish with water and spit, and toss the rest.

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CatzerzMcGee,4,Mon Jul 20 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I like to make the workout days a bit more heavy in volume and recovery days a bit less. The total volume for the day was 20 miles with the structure:  6:00AM - 2 miles shakeout   8:30AM - 2 miles warm up, 10 miles at 5:29, 2 miles cool down  6:00PM - 4 miles easy."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,kevinmnola,3,Mon Jul 20 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent. How often do you anticipate doing large blocks of pace work? The Pfitz plan I'm doing doesn't have very much of it, which I found interesting. Where would you rank the importance of actually running at marathon pace?"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CatzerzMcGee,3,Mon Jul 20 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Well the basic program where I'm drawing a lot of inspiration from is Canova. In his program Marathon Pace is by far the most important focus of training. Every other pace is derived as a percentage based off goal race pace, but specificity is the key thing. I really agree with that mindset because come race day you had better be prepared to run 26.2 miles at race pace and if you can run a large amount of volume in training (while staying healthy) you will be prepared for the race much better than just getting the volume in.   In terms of the frequency, I have my plan set out already where I just made it through the first ""block"" of 4 x 9 day cycles. Now I'm going to repeat another 4 x 9 days with a bit more distance added on to each session. In terms of specific race pace work coming up I have planned:   5k race + medium distance run of 85-90% MP 1k-2k reps at 105-110% MP Special block of AM: 7k@85-90%, 7k@MP then PM: 7k@85-90% + 7x 1k @ 102-105% 13.1 miles at MP"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CookingWine,3,Mon Jul 20 19:49:55 2015 UTC,I was about to ask if you were doing something Canova-inspired. (I happened to be looking through some stuff about Canova earlier today and saw a lot of stuff phrased in terms of percentages of race pace. I've also read about Kenyans who will triple with a short early morning run.)  Do you already have plans sketched out for other special blocks later in your training? Any days of crazy high mileage?
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CatzerzMcGee,3,Mon Jul 20 20:38:55 2015 UTC,"I've been tripling for a few months now on workout days and I really think it works well for me.   I'm going to do two more special blocks in training. I've already done AM 6k@90%, 6k@100% then PM 6k@90% + 6 x 1k @ 102-105%. That day was 24 miles total. The special blocks going forward are planned to be:   7k/7k then 7k+7x1k  8k/8k then 8k+8x1k   A pretty simple and straightforward progression, but I think that sort of session is the best bang for the buck. I guess those blocks will come out to 27-30 miles for the day if I run everything right. But, the way I have it set up is 4 days of recovery afterwards to make sure I absorb the workload."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CookingWine,3,Mon Jul 20 21:06:56 2015 UTC,"Have you listened to the episode of Jay Johnson's Run Faster Podcast when he talks to Nate Jenkins? He did some Canova training, and he was talking about some of those crazy days with high mileage at high intensity."

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,3,Tue Jul 21 01:21:11 2015 UTC,"That's great. Do you have much experience training based on marathon pace? I imagine not--has it been a challenge to re-focus your training, or have you found that it's not too different than half marathon blocks?"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,JerMenKoO,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"Nope, not a lot of previous experience with it, but I have used ""steady"" runs at around the same pace in the past. It is quite a bit different focusing so much on one pace and basing the workloads around it. In HM training a lot of my focus was on race pace and training the lactate threshold system.  Just this morning I did a track workout at 5k->3k pace and it felt decently challenging because of the volume and focus I'm doing for longer runs recently. It is definitely a different type of stress on the body training for the marathon compared to things I've done in the past."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,CatzerzMcGee,3,Mon Jul 20 21:02:10 2015 UTC,I hope shaking things up like this pays dividends even after the race is over. At the very least it sounds like you're entering into yet another realm of racing.

The workout called for 2x (600m, 400m, 600m), 200m recovery between repeats and 400m in between sets, at 5k goal pace, which is 8:00min/mi for me. Went 2:55, 1:59, 3:00 for the first set. Great, felt solid, but was starting to get hot and tired as the sun got stronger. Second set... hit the first 600m in 2:59, and the 400m in 1:59. Again, great. Hit the manual lap button and started the last 600m, but realized I hadn't checked my watch to see my start time, so I didn't know where I needed to be to hit my splits, and I could feel that the start was far too slow. Ended up checking the time around 2-300m, and running at least the last half or so of the 600m on pace, and finished with a frustration-inducing 3:12. Whomp.  Wednesday night I redeemed myself by PRing the mile at an open track meet - friend paced me aiming to break 7:30, finished in 7:26, over my PR from 4 weeks ago where I ran 7:48 for the first timed mile I've done since an embarrassing middle school gym class performance. Hoping that upping mileage with the Pfitz 12/55 plan, coupled with cooler weather, will lead to a magical time-drop when I eventually give it another go in the fall.

He kinda paced me a few weeks ago at the previous one, too - he let me get into a rhythm since we had no idea what my pace would be, and then hung in front of me and then held the pace steady, then told me when to kick.

So I hopped on my work treadmill, turned up the fan and the a/c, and did 18 miles with the last 7 quick, a bit under 6:30.

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,dinosaurdinosrawr,4,Mon Jul 20 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Treadmill 18 miler?!? WOOF. That sounds absolutely killer mentally - did you have a tv or music or anything to keep you distracted? How did you feel (physically) afterwards, compared to 18 on roads?"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,4,Mon Jul 20 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"Let's see. I did have music that I was playing through my phone's little speaker, and there was a TV in the room but I didn't turn it on. I felt about the same as after a road 18 miler, though not as hot and sweaty. My marathon is flat/downhill and is point to point with only a few turns, so I think a treadmill run simulates the course better than it would something like the Boston Marathon, or really any marathon with significant elevation gains. I'm hoping to get out on a few paths that I've picked out to simulate the course better in the coming months, but if I'm going to be slogging through them at 90 - 120 seconds above my marathon pace because of extreme heat on the weeks I'm supposed to be incorporating pace work, I'll choose the treadmill again. I don't mind it that much!"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,RunnerEh,3,Mon Jul 20 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Cool, that's awesome that it didn't feel any different, and super awesome that it simulates the course. Which race is it? That's smart - I hadn't thought about how it would be advantageous to opt for the treadmill for those long runs that include pace work, rather than dealing with the slower pace in the heat. Definitely worth it if you don't mind the treadmill! Not to mention that it would mean you don't necessarily have to get up and moving at ridiculous hours to avoid the peak heat, if you want that extra sleep time... I might have to take your lead and opt for the treadmill at some point in the coming weeks.   Oh, and for fueling - do you just fuel as you normally would outside?"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,3,Mon Jul 20 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly! It's the Wineglass Marathon in New York on October 4th. I'm really looking forward to it. Still not exactly sure about my goal time, which is why I wanted to start in on the marathon pace work.  I did take a Gu because on a normal 18 miler with a fast finish I would take one Gu. As I get up into 20 miles or 22 miles I'll probably bring 2 Gu packets along. I really like to eat clementines while on the treadmill but unfortunately I didn't have any . . ."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"Clementines on the treadmill in the summer heat (even with the AC cranked) would be lovely - too bad they're more of a christmas-time food. I wonder if grapes, or anything with that kinda burst of juice when you first bite into it, would be as good. The trick to grapes though would be not chocking..."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"Anything juicy is good. So, so, so much better than Gu."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:01 2015 UTC,"AHh, gotcha.   Oooh, clementines mid-run sound delicious and amazingly refreshing! Then again, any real food tends to beat gels or chews. I've been taking fig newtons with me instead of gels (or in addition to one gel on those super long runs, rather than multiple gels) and have really been digging them... not to mention that a whole package is cheaper than buying like, five gels."

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,3,Tue Jul 21 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"Plastic ziploc baggie, which then goes in the pocket of my handheld or hydration pack! I try to stack them or align them side by side and nicely fold over all the extra plastic of the baggie so that it fits better in the pocket, but as I go and pull them out and put the bag back while moving, it's not as nice haha"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,3,Tue Jul 21 02:14:47 2015 UTC,18 miles on a treadmill?  My mind would quit on me first.  You would find me crying in the corner sucking my thumb with the treadmill still running.  Props for closing up hard towards the end!
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! It really wasn't that bad at all. My work is very close to  where I live and there's a small gym on the first floor. No one's there on Sunday so I just enjoyed the solitude. I know some people like /u/qwikben and a few others in our club braved the weather but for a pace run like I had planned it was a no-brainer to step onto Old Reliable.
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,6,Mon Jul 20 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"Since last week was all mileage for me I don't have any fun workouts to report on.  I can, however mention how I had to sacrifice my sanity to hit my totals for the week.  Had car issues on Tuesday which forced me to miss my lunch break run.  Decided to run long in the evening but didn't get started until closer to 8pm. Completely forgot I had promised a friend I would meet them for a 5:30am run.  I had just finished my 12 miler and it was 9:30pm.  I ate a snack, drank some water, showered off, went to bed.  Woke up what felt like a few hours later, put my shoes back on and right back out the door for a seven miler.  Even though I probably still got like 7 hours of sleep that night, I felt like I was some sort of badass ultra runner. ""Quick, get in a few hours of sleep and then we gotta get going again!"""
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ForwardBound,7,Mon Jul 20 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"How did the seven miler in the morning feel, Mr. Jurek?"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,4,Mon Jul 20 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"a little stiff at first but then fine.  I was pretty wiped out the rest of the day, though, needed an energy drink at work.  Did another 7 with them in the evening and my legs felt pretty dead."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,5,Mon Jul 20 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"Went to the track on Saturday for an attempt at a sandwich workout. It was supposed to be 2mi tempo + 6x1:00 hard + 2mi tempo. It unfortunately did not go as planned, but I did salvage it as much as possible.   Initially, I wanted to get up super early and run but I stayed out late playing board games the night before. I actually wanted to leave earlier but the final game lasted forever. So I went later in the day...at around 4pm...when it was about as hot as it got that day. I got about 5 minutes into my first tempo when I took a look at my watch and tried to switch the display. Unfortunately I accidentally hit the ""lap"" button instead, which meant that it ended the tempo portion of my workout. I made a quick decision and ran through the 3:00 rest (and then took the rest without logging it). The 6x1:00 afterwards went very well...maybe too well. Because by the time I did my second tempo I was done. I wanted to stop after 400m, but managed to force myself to do a mile. Somewhat salvaged.  Paces: 8:00 @ 5:57/mi; 6x1:00 hard (paces were 5:18,5:22,5:20,5:23,5:24,5:13); 6:00 @ 5:53/mi  Strava activity."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,3,Mon Jul 20 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Man that sounds like such a tough workout even the way you ended up doing it.
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BilldozerVT,3,Mon Jul 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I got mad at what happened with my watch, then did my 1:00's too hard, which cost me my final tempo. It's such a fine balance.  I need a win in my workouts this week, so it looks like the Moneghetti is in my future."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,FattMattSplatt,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:03 2015 UTC,Are you able to run right onto that track near you?  The closest one to me is 4 miles away and I am pretty sure I might have to hop a fence if I want to use it.
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,duhrandomkid,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"Nope. Mine is about 3 hilly miles away and I have to check online if it is available (there are open hours but they are pretty inconvenient - for example at the hottest times of day). Even then, sometimes I get there and it looks like a team is using it so I cannot."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ottersalad,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"Well that sucks, but at least you have some idea of when it is open.  The one by me is at a highschool and I emailed the coach.  He hasn't responded, probably doesn't check his work email over the summer.  I am thinking the first time I might bike over to scope it out and warm up once I get there. That way it's not like I am 4 miles into a run and have to decide what to do if it is closed or I just can't get in."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ottersalad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:26 2015 UTC,Is it a public high school? That should be open to the public outside of school hours (and since it is summer that is all hours).

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,duhrandomkid,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"I had a pretty good hill tempo last thursday.  My friend was still injured, so I ran it alone (pretty much). It was 8.72 @ 6:18 min/mil, which I am really happy with. This past january I ran the course at 7:20 pace, so I improved a lot.   The run is really intense, and has an elevation gain of 1034 ft. Is that a lot? There are 3 pretty huge hills, so I'm guessing so."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,chickenwithcheez,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"Did 4x1 mile repeats with 3:00 active recovery between each Thursday on a bike path. I was running with my training group who were hoping to drop 5 seconds per repeat beginning at 5:45ish. I went out in 5:46. We cut the recover short by 10-15 seconds which I am not used to and then went 5:31. I then went 5:32 and 5:31 the last two repeats. I was on pace to run 5:20 the last mile but a slight incline in the 800 cramped me up and I slowed down a ton. It was really humid and I had been sick the few days before.   My reason for posting though is that I have been struggling to start workouts strong. I did a 1.5 mile warmup at 7:00 pace and then ran each repeat at the same effort level. So why do I drop 15 seconds from repeat to repeat when I run the same effort? Do I need more of a warmup? I'm not sure what my issue is. When I do track repeats I drop each repeat. My last track workout was 8x400 and I started at 75 and ended at 65 and each repeat I dropped a second or two. But the last repeat felt like it was the same effort level and the 1st or 2nd. Not sure what my issue is!   I am happy though my workouts are improving. I ran a 28:46 on July 4th in a 5 miler.. which was my first race since January so I am trying to get a good 5k in soon, but I want to have a killer workout before I commit to a local 5k."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ottersalad,3,Mon Jul 20 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely need a couple reps to really get into the groove during interval sessions. It's almost as though my legs need to bust off the rust and get used to a faster speed. I think most people experience this. If you really don't like it at all, maybe do some strides before the workout."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,chickenwithcheez,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always feel a little rusty! Yeah with the group I train with they are a bit older than me, and then are very impatient. They go straight from warmup into the workout.. its crazy. No time to do dynamics/strides. I run by myself on the warmups to give myself a little more time to do some dynamics. I'm glad I'm not the only one with this issue."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,ottersalad,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"What about track workouts where you are able to tell exactly what pace you are on?  I have a feeling that you just don't quite have the blood flowing yet and if you don't have any landmarks to know what pace you are on then there is a good chance you will be off for that first one.  If you are on a track or somewhere that allows you to dial in the pace exactly, do you still feel terrible during the first repeat? Or just rusty and not loosened up yet?"
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,chickenwithcheez,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:05 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's the lack of landmarks and 1/4 mile marks on my bike path! I usually just feel rusty on a track but I'm still off by a few seconds. I almost always negative split workouts.. But I always start too slow
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,TheEcstatic,4,Mon Jul 20 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"Did 7k E + 5k T + 3k E for a threshold run. I got the general workout out of Jack Daniels Running Formula from his Half Marathon training chapter (he tells me to do 60 min E + 20 min T + cooldown), but decided to cut it back a bit because I was aiming to do a bit less mileage this week.  The workout felt awful this time. I couldn't hold on to the pace for the last 2 km. That 7km leading in shouldn't be enough to wear me down. I blame the difficulty on having just completed a big ""up"" week in my mileage the previous week. Or maybe I'm just not back in shape from my break a few months ago?  This workout was one of my favourites last spring when I was training for my first half marathon. I remember doing one especially nice 12km E + 5km T + cooldown, and feeling very easy on the T pace. Gave me a huge confidence boost knowing I could hold that pace so late in a run and that HM pace would be a bit slower.  I figure I get the best of a threshold run and a progression run all in one go from such a workout. Do you think that's a good thing to be after? Now that I'm focusing on 5k/10k for a while, is there still any use to such a workout?"

And a few weeks before that I did just over 10 miles in Forest Park in Portland, OR. In both cases the weather was warm, but without the sort of oppressive humidity I'm used to. I'm planning on another 10-miler on Friday. The forecast says high of 97. Hopefully I can drag myself out of bed as early as possible."
AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,Butter-Finger,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"I had a good track workout on Tuesday last week. 2x800 at 2 mile pace + 2x400 at mile pace + 2x200 just plain fast. On the first 800 I went on pace for about 2:45 the first lap and then for some reason me and all my teammates relaxed without even realizing it. We slowed down to hit 2:55 accidentally, but that was the pace were supposed to hit. 400s felt really good.   Question regarding tempo runs: Have any of you experienced getting faster in races and interval workouts, yet your tempos (at the same effort level) don't get any faster? I have improved my fitness from the beginning of summer by a good amount, but my tempo runs all summer have been the same pace."

AdvancedRunning,3dyek2,BAM225,3,Mon Jul 20 17:01:35 2015 UTC,What have your tempos been like? Flat route and even split paces? Do you go for time or mileage?  You could consider adding a minute or two if you go for time on your tempos.. if you have been doing 20 minute tempos at 6:00 pace all summer.. run 6:00 for 21 or 22 minutes. If you are training for XC don't overcook it this summer. Don't kill the pace.

AdvancedRunning,3dyoiy,a_not_clever_name,11,Mon Jul 20 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"If it's Lehigh Valley then you can just take a car to the finish, right?   Seriously though, for your first marathon, find one of the programs here and stick with it. Next time you can change things up, but there's no reason to come up with your own plan at this point, or even to think about changing the workouts.  If your goal is to break 3 hours and you currently can run a 79 minute half, don't worry about doing 100 miles a week. I would be surprised if you couldn't break 3 now, and you definitely should be able to on 60 miles a week (assuming that the race itself goes ok, you don't make any huge mistakes, and you don't lose fitness training 60mpw). If, however, you follow the plans with a 6:50 goal pace (and adjust the workout paces accordingly), I suspect you will get in worse shape.  I would work out as if you were going to break 2:50, 45, or whatever you think a good hard-ish but realistic goal is, then race conservatively: slow first half, push in the second if you feel good. Unexpected things happen at your first marathon. It's a tough distance, and it's really different from other races. Focus on running a fast race at Boston after you've already done one.  If your shoes work, stick with them.   In my experience, getting to the start line without injury and then finishing the marathon is much harder than with other distances. You need to really focus on your pacing and fueling strategies. Yes, you can rabbit a 5k and screw it up terribly, but if you do that in a marathon you may have 10+ slow miles of hell. It is also very hard to run out of fuel at shorter distances, but long runs teach you how to avoid this."

Ive gotten small advice from my former coach but nothing substantial and my problem is that i look at all of these guides and don't see something that works extremely well for me because many have really short runs during the week like 3-6 mile run days and for some reason i cant force my self to go that short (this is one of my downfalls, taking easy days easy and hard days hard. i tend to do take my easy days easy till about 2 or 3 miles left and just do a progression run XD )   When you say fueling strategies do you mean when to eat during the marathon? this is a BIG problem for me currently I cant complete a long run without eating a nature valley bar or like half of one and this means someone bikes with me. normally one of my friends that just bike and smoke while I run but i am concerned about my eating during the race."
AdvancedRunning,3dyoiy,callthebluff,2,Mon Jul 20 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you really do have to do the easy days easy, and the hard days hard. The training will wear you down otherwise (assuming you are training for what you can do, and not just a sub-3 run). It is tough doing that though. Until midway through when you're super tired and thankful to have a short easy run. If you'd rather have off days, check out Run Faster by Hudson and Fitzgerald. They get into how to adapt programs to individual needs in greater detail than Daniels or Pfitzinger.  Fueling strategies involve how to eat during the marathon, how to eat the night before. One important adaptation from marathon training is getting your liver to store more glycogen (this is what the long runs do). Running first thing in the morning (ie after a fast) and long runs both deplete glycogen stores, so they make your liver store more. The Science of Running by Magness has a lot of detail about the science behind glycogen storage and improving it, as well as little things you can do with your workouts to improve storage.   If that's all too complicated, just do the long runs, and find a food you can tolerate while running. Try carrying your own too :) Anything else is gravy."
AdvancedRunning,3dyoiy,McBeers,5,Tue Jul 21 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"Your workouts and workload say closer to 250 than 300 to me, at least physically.   I would look at how Pfitzinger's structures his long runs. He generally has the back half slightly faster than the start, something like 120% marathon pace than 110%.  Then, every so often a long run that finished at goal pace. Those are going to be the best to get you adjusted to marathon pace and running on tired legs."

AdvancedRunning,3dy5ie,JimmyN72,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:43 2015 UTC,Just formerly D1 runner here- I was in your shoes my sophomore summer of high school... One thing that helped me a lot is throwing in a second run of just 2 or 3 miles maybe 2-4 times a week or whatever your feeling. This lets you up your mileage and make it so your not doing 9 miles alone almost every day or like 4 days a week  Also what kind of long run are you doing? What's your weekly mileage total for like last week?
AdvancedRunning,3dy5ie,a_not_clever_name,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"Um, it shouldn't really peak. I'd say you should maintain a comfortable volume with 1-2 workouts and a long run (which, depending on the intensity of some of your workouts, can count as a workout in and of itself)."
AdvancedRunning,3dyrhe,Runhersey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"It may be a mix of shoes/your anatomy/muscle imbalances etc.  Sure, the shoes are approaching their last leg.  I usually give shoes that I do tempo/speedwork in a shorter life expectancy because of the forces involved with faster running, so depending on what type of miles you've been logging they the 18s could be due for a switch. Strengthen the muscles in and around your foot Keep rolling, stretching, etc. This assumes the pain disappears when wearing other shoes.  Obviously, if the pain continues or worsens you should at least reduce volume and/or intensity.

AdvancedRunning,3dveov,mnncn,4,Sun Jul 19 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"As a former 400 meter and 800 meter runner, you are probably in the same boat as I was when I trained for my first half-marathon in that you have plenty of speed but need to work on your endurance.  Endurance comes from high volume, much of which is at an easy pace.  I think you are actually capable of handling higher mileage, provided you build up to it properly.  Aggressively ramping up the mileage often does cause injury.  Did you build up to your 12-mile run or did you just jump into that?  If the latter, try working your way up from 6-8 miles this time around.    Your injuries may also very well have been a result of too many tempo runs.  When you're training for a half-marathon or longer, more than half of your miles should be easy (you should be able to speak in sentences when you run at your easy pace).  Slow speeds may feel unnatural at first, but they will help you maximize your mileage and improve your performance.  By the way, 15 kilometers/hour is not particularly ""slow"" by any means.  To summarize: the way I recommend training for a half-marathon is to increase your mileage carefully (by no more than about 8-10% each week), keeping most of it easy, and including one or two days a week of faster running.  Long runs should be at an easy pace also.  Trust me; my performance in the half-marathon (and marathon for that matter) really improved when I trained this way."
AdvancedRunning,3dveov,EricfromDC,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:32 2015 UTC,"When you were running slow speeds, what technique did you use?  Did you keep the ""sprint form"" and slowed down your cadence, or did you sacrifice form to keep up cadence?"
AdvancedRunning,3dveov,EricfromDC,2,Mon Jul 20 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't think about form too much when I started running at slower speeds.  I just relaxed and let my body move the way it wanted to move.  That's really the best way I can explain it.  I did, and still do, try to keep my cadence at 180 steps per minute during my easy runs."
AdvancedRunning,3dveov,gato_meow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:46:49 2015 UTC,"I never ran track, but I'm a former football player and my 40 yard dash was consistently in that 4.4 - 4.5 range. I think I had the same broad jump as you too, somewhere in that 10'4"" - 10'6"" range can't remember. I consider myself a sprinter and have recently picked up distance running to train for my first marathon. I'll throw in my 2 cents since we're in a similar situation.  The difference that I've noticed from distance running to sprinting is the ""exaggeration"" of form while sprinting. While sprinting you have higher knees, longer stride, higher vertical when you push off your foot, more time spent in air and less on ground, more aggressive arm swing etc. I've been focusing on getting my cadence to 180/minute and over time my form has turned from that powerful (yet exhausting) sprinting form to the more efficient distance running form. I think it'll come with time naturally if you focus on cadence and ""toning down your form"" for lack of a witty term. Shorter arm swing, shorter strides, and lower knees/less hip extension (compared to your sprinting form) and get that 180 cadence. After that's down you'll run fast without overexerting your body."
AdvancedRunning,3dveov,BruceWinchell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:33 2015 UTC,"I'm with you dude, I also am a sprinter but I'm slowly building up my endurance with some long runs once a weekish. Today I just completed my furthest run to date, a little over 10 miles, and probably gonna go for 13 next time. I agree that the key is to slowly build up to it, especially if you have gotten injured from jumping into running too many miles too soon."
AdvancedRunning,3dveov,Butter-Finger,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:05:53 2015 UTC,Im the same way as you in that I can't comfortably run at slower speeds my form breaks down. My tips are try and add cross training to your routine like swimming and biking and try and run on dirt/grass/trails as much as possible to reduce the pounding. Im assuming you're a bigger guy as a jumper so you have to respect your body and not destroy your joints on roads.

Still training for a fall marathon, but after that, who knows? Maybe I can be competitive in the occasional 5K, but I think I'm going to have to scale everything waaay back for a couple of years.

Then I head out and get back by 6:30 to shower and can help everyone get out the door by 7.  I'm often home before the baby wakes up.  On Sundays I run long and promise to be back by 8, but I don't have to wake my wife up so I can leave even earlier.  I don't miss out on much (except sleep) and can still maintain 50-70 mpw.  Twins will be a bit harder, especially at first, but you won't have to stop training for a few years I you don't want to..."

Sorry /u/teuker, did not make pancakes... yet!  Did anyone else go see the Amy Winehouse movie (""Amy"")? I caught it on Tuesday and it was really interesting. It showed the trajectory of her life, relationships, and fame. Revisited her music, haven't been able to stop listening since then.  Also, does anyone know of any awesome summer marathons anywhere in the world?

To be honest, I at first thought it was supposed to be a comedy since it has Paul Rudd and ""Ant-Man"" doesn't really sound like a superhero-y name. I haven't seen much of the trailer other than a glimpse that I wasn't paying much attention to, so maybe I should rewatch and see if I should reassess and go check it out!"

Look at Makhloufi and then look at him. I wonder if he gets much done in the weight room. Farah is also talking about not running the 5k at Worlds. I wonder why he isn't feeling as confident. The 1500 in Monaco makes it look like he is following the same pattern as 2013."

AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,JewishIGuess,8,Mon Jul 20 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"It's been an exhausting week. Since last Sunday, I've done 102 miles, which is my first time over 100 for any 7 day stretch. Now by normal counting weeks, it'll end up being 92 after tomorrow (also a record, just less sexy).  I also won a race. Flew up here to MN because some of my teammates for Hood to Coast were doing a rinky dink local 5 miler in one of their hometowns, so I flew in unannounced, shocked the hell out of them, and then kicked ass. Wire-to-wire lead, leaned at the tape and beat the second place guy by 2:13. Didn't hit my goals or set a PR, but that's mostly because I didn't feel much of a need to crank up the speed in the last two miles (and I was running blind; my GPS decided not to link up to the satellite). Afterward, I think I was recovered and ready to start a warmdown by 2 or 3 minutes after the race. Marathon training is awesome.  I also flew up here for non-running related reasons; the Eaux Claires festival is going on right now and my absolute favorite band, Spoon, played yesterday. So I got to hang out in the sun, drink beer, and catch some awesome shows. Spoon killed it, as always (but, for what it's worth, it was their best festival show since adding a fifth member last year). And now I'm chilling in my hometown, which is just as pleasant and uneventful as ever."
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,teuker,3,Sat Jul 18 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"Oh man, eaux claires sounds great. My friends are all in Minneapolis, and for some reason they choose to go Pitchfork in Chicago over eaux claires...I was angry at them. But pitchforks live stream is pretty tight."
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,CookingWine,2,Sat Jul 18 20:28:27 2015 UTC,Chicago is a bit more of an exotic destination...and I could see an argument for the Pitchfork lineup. But there was something a lot more refreshing in the Wisconsin woods with Eaux Claires.
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,teuker,3,Sat Jul 18 21:46:47 2015 UTC,Jealous of the Eaux Claires trip. What other bands did you see? So many good ones at that festival.
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,CookingWine,2,Sat Jul 18 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"Let's see, I parked myself between the main stage and the secondary stage, so I caught a good number of shows. Standouts were Hiss Golden Messenger and the Lone Bellow. I also caught the National's show, which was good but yet again, they suffered because they followed Spoon. I've seen the National at three different festivals and I really do like their music but they have always been an hour or two after Spoon, so they are comparatively marked down."
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,teuker,5,Sat Jul 18 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"I've never seen Spoon. I'll have to make a point to do so the next time they come through my neck of the woods. On the subject of the The National, I think we're going to have to disagree. Some people on this board were talking about them last week, and they were saying how their live show lacked energy. I've seen them a few times, and I've always felt like they had a very high-energy show.    Did you feel like Eaux Claires was a different sort of music festival in any way? I remember reading interviews with Justin Vernon where he was talking about how this wasn't going to be your ordinary music festival, and how he was going to try to create informal opportunities for artists to collaborate. Did you see any evidence of that, or do you think it was just a way to hype his event?"
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,kkruns,4,Sat Jul 18 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"I've done 2 dozen Spoon shows at this point. It's a good choice. I think I was a part of that conversation about the National--I think that I just need to stop seeing them at these festivals and go to a more intimate venue for them. And make sure Spoon isn't opening.  Eaux Claires did feel different from the other festivals I've been to; there was a number of guests showing up for other acts (i.e Blind Boys of Alabama coming over to help the Lone Bellow or Sufjan and Justin Vernon showing up for the National's set). It also felt less-corporate; there was more freedom to roam around and they really did away with that whole VIPs-being-gods thing, which was awesome."
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,teuker,2,Sat Jul 18 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"It might be the festival thing. I saw The National at the House of Blues in Boston and it was a fantastic show, but I've never seen them in a festival environment."
AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,ForwardBound,3,Mon Jul 20 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"That's the rough thing about living in Austin; our music scene is great but most of the non-local bands will come for the ACL festival in the fall or SXSW in the spring, making other stops a bit less frequently. I'll definitely catch the National live in a single show whenever they have another one here, just to give them a fair shot."

AdvancedRunning,3dr5ct,ForwardBound,3,Sun Jul 19 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"It went pretty well! I decided to do this route which is incredibly stupid (the middle: 1400 ft or something of up in 4 not steep but unrelenting miles of rutted up fire road through an area I think of as the meadow of despair) but fun, especially in that I haven't run it in a while.  I was hoping to do 15 in 3 hours even with the climbing, to convince myself that I am really capable of doing 50k in 6:30 (on a flat course), and instead did 16 in 2:50 or so.  So I'm happy, if I can manage to not quit (boring looped 2 mi course, SO many chances to quit) I should do fine.  As an aside, you might wonder why 6:30-- that's what I was predicted to finish Gorge Waterfalls in.  You know, the one where I almost fell off a cliff and spent eight and a half hours running.  This is my stupid revenge race, improving by 2 hrs seems like a good goal.  Re: cycling, mostly roads! A bunch of my coworkers are into cycling, they are getting me back into it.  One of them is actually going to bike to this 50k with me!  Because it's out in the middle of nowhere and it starts at 6 a.m. (ha ha what) so I decided to just camp over the night before.  This is reaching race report length so I'll end it here :P just so happy to have one run actually worth writing about!"

Got vicious DOMS after the first squat session even though the weight was not challenging, glad I'm getting that unpleasant back-in-the-weight-room phase out of the way before I get back to running again.  Emotionally I'm somewhat back to normal, trying to clean up my diet a bit for the next few weeks - gained a couple pounds thanks to frequent pity parties with my good pals Ben and Jerry.

Some short hills on one or two of the days. Honestly feeling pretty worn out from this week. I really want to keep training cuz I'm in such a groove right now, but I know that rest has the very real potential to be the more productive, fitness-enhancing choice. I think I may take tomorrow completely off, and then do a short run or maybe two on Tuesday and hop back into a 100 mi/7 day schedule starting Tuesday or Wednesday.

Regular deadlifts and single-legged deadlifts have really helped me strengthen my hams, glutes, and hips.  You don't need to go crazy heavy on the deadlifts, but you want it to be hard.  I'd certainly run it over with your coach, because he might have some go-to strength training recommendations, but I truly believe distance runners should be dedicating a couple of hours a week to the weightroom.  It helped me tremendously."

I didn't like him at all. I'm happy to have watched him mature into one of the greatest 1500m runners of all time. I'll probably be pulling for him in Rio if it's not an American winning it."

What a story.   When's the last time you ran a 1500/1600/mile? Ever think about going back and focusing on those shorter distances instead of longer stuff?"
AdvancedRunning,3dmrz0,ForwardBound,4,Fri Jul 17 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I decided to spike up and run a 1600m with no training.  I hadn't run in about 3 years.  Managed to run a 4:49.  Felt really really hard.  My brother keeps telling me to try and compete in local track circuits but I don't think I would ever get near those times again.  Probably for that reason is why I have been going longer, it's an unknown distance so no expectations.  Treating it like a separate running career."

Really, in the long run I just think this cheapens what it means to be a BQ for a lot of people. For a lot of runners, Boston is their dream, and for a schmuck like this to have cheated his way in makes a mockery of the process.  Personally, I think that for a marathon course to be USATF-certified it should have a few more timing mats down with cameras at each station. Then say that if you hit a time without hitting a majority of the mats you're disqualified. I say a majority only because I've occasionally (very rarely) heard of miscues with runners crossing them (ie someone going over the wrong mat, etc)."
AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,bxctrack09,3,Fri Jul 17 02:47:04 2015 UTC,The good thing coming out of this is that this year the race where he qualified will have multiple timing mats on the course.

AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,ForwardBound,9,Thu Jul 16 22:47:13 2015 UTC,"Haha, the Brojos can be a bit intense when they sink their teeth into something. But you know when it comes from them that they've done their research and aren't messing around."
AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,bxctrack09,7,Fri Jul 17 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"I suppose. I don't think they're really doing the running community or anyone a service by writing this article. No argument that they do their research and are really passionate about their chosen subject of running but I'm not personally a fan of what I see as the immature side of journalism that they can exhibit.  In the end, though, the positive things they contribute to the competitive side of running outweigh what I see as their flaws, and I'm very willing to admit that just because they don't really fall in line with my personal taste doesn't mean they don't have a lot of value."
AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,ForwardBound,2,Fri Jul 17 03:52:44 2015 UTC,"They definitely can be a little immature or juvenile when it comes to certain topics, and their writing reflects that. I think (not to speak for them, but just inferring from their tone and the general debate) that they got a tad irritated with this guy's lame showboating, and once they saw some smoke, got a little overboard chasing that fire. Of course, one could also argue that Rossi brought this all on himself by continuing to engage well after people blew him right out of the water, and engaged in an even more rude and juvenile way. So, I'm not too unhappy that the Brojos did their ridiculously thorough expose.  Now, if this guy had just run Boston and kept his mouth shut, no one would know or care that he was a fraud, and we'd all go home happy. For one day, at least."

AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,ForwardBound,3,Fri Jul 17 11:34:47 2015 UTC,"I have a theory.    Rossi was fairly active on social media and was in some running groups.  He probably runs his mouth a fair bit (nothing wrong there, look at my flair).  He annoys someone (X) that is in that circle.  X knows he has Lehigh coming up.  It comes and goes, but Rossi says nothing about it.  X thinks ""I bet he bombed"", and grudge-stalks the results.  Sees that time.  ""WTF, why has he not said anything about this?"".  But they let it go.  Then Rossi starts to run his social media mouth a little bit, posting about mediocre 5ks while wearing Boston gear.  They get a little confused, why no Lehigh pictures?  Maybe they are bad photos, I want to see them.  What?  No photos?  Now maybe X starts questioning the Lehigh results, but keeps it to themselves.  Then Boston happens and the douchebag letter goes viral.  ""Ok, Fuck this"" says X.  They post to Letsrun and runnersworld.com and the thing takes off.   X is the hero we need."

AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,Phaxda,6,Fri Jul 17 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand how tough it is to just drop 2' in a short race in a short timeframe like that.

I don't know what your PRs are, but I know that I'd be stunned if I could drop 2' in my 5k in a year, even with optimal conditions - like quitting my job to train full-time, finding a coach for one on one workouts and training, a similarly motivated training partner, etc. It may not be impossible, but I don't think its very likely."
AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,bxctrack09,3,Fri Jul 17 03:45:29 2015 UTC,"Athlinks says my recent best is 19:41. For 10 grand I would quit drinking beer, do track (I hate the track), hill workouts, weight room, and shoot for sub-18. I danced it around it a bit and don't want to be rude, but as someone who has packed on pounds... I'm looking at this guy's pictures and wondering if some weight loss alone would help shave a minute or so?  22 down to sub-20 also seems a lot easier than 20 to sub-18 but maybe that's just me making excuses for my own laziness? I do think it would be really, really hard--didn't mean to come across as flippant."

AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,duckered,5,Mon Jul 20 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"I think that if he perhaps did a track workout once a week, and a tempo run, shaving two minutes off a 22 minute 5k shouldn't be that hard.   That said, I'd like to see him do the right thing and just admit it already. Such a shitty example to set for your kids."
AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,donmega187,2,Fri Jul 17 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"Without knowing his training history, it's pretty tough to see what exactly he can do to improve. All I'm going to say is that a 22' 5k is about 7 minute pace, and a 20' 5k is about 6:20 pace. That's a hell of an improvement in one year. Unless he was new to the sport (which he isn't) or a high schooler still growing (also a big nope), I really really can't see it happening.  Either way, I wholeheartedly agree with your second point. Just admit you're a phony, and move on."
AdvancedRunning,3djwe9,bxctrack09,3,Fri Jul 17 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"From what I could put together, his training wasn't all that great.  Very inconsistent, not very high mileage.  Plus, he clearly could drop some pounds.  That is some very low hanging training fruit.  And he has completed a marathon (just not Lehigh), so there is some mental toughness there.  If I were him, I'd say ""give me 15 months"", get consistent, drop some weight, and race some cooler weather 5ks.    The main point is, that 5k time they set is far more reachable than the other times."

If he trains hard he can definitely hit the 3:25, and if he does everything right, I think the 3:11 is in reach!  $100,000 is a pretty big incentive...

AdvancedRunning,3djf5z,Tweeeked,5,Thu Jul 16 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"My go to for knee twinges is lunges.  10 when I get up, 10 before the run, 10 after, 10 before bed.  Maybe a couple sets randomly through the day.    My theory is that some small muscle imbalance has started and is pulling your tendons strangely.  Working the knee like this can help strengthen up all the muscles involved in the joint and get it back in line.  I am not an expert."
AdvancedRunning,3djf5z,callthebluff,3,Thu Jul 16 20:04:53 2015 UTC,"The muscle imbalance you refer to is exactly what causes most cases of what we call ""runner's knee""; one of the quads is stronger than the others, which pulls the patella out of the tidy groove it normally rides in and crashes it into the end of the femur.  My knees don't like lunges, but I have found success in doing slow, deliberate step-ups as part of my daily routine.   That said, it's impossible to know if what OP describes is actually runner's knee. Checking in with a doctor or PT is the best bet to diagnose the injury and subsequently fix it."

AdvancedRunning,3djf5z,cursivical,2,Fri Jul 17 03:52:34 2015 UTC,"While things like icing are a good short-term strategy, strengthening the muscles around your knee is the best long-term strategy and will help prevent future flare-ups, as /u/callthebluff suggested.  I has an annoying bout of runner's knee earlier this summer and this is what I did: leg extensions (using a machine), clam shells, and single leg squats. The leg extensions strengthen the big muscle above your knee, the squats strengthen your quads in general. The clam shells hit your hip muscles, and are good for injury prevention.  I would watch some youtube tutorials to make sure you're doing these exercises correctly, since  strength training with poor form could result in an entirely different injury. Also, check the mileage on your shoes, try to run on soft surfaces + avoid steep downhills until this clears up. Good luck!"

So, I'd advise not trying to push it.  To combat that, what I did (and still do) are monster walks with a theraband, and a hip strength circuit. My issue was that I had extremely weak (and strangely unbalanced) hips muscles, and I was using the wrong muscles to flex and extend my knees, causing all sorts of issues. For a while in college I also did a handful of other hip strength exercises, but these are the ones I've found that work.

AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,RunningJay,10,Wed Jul 15 21:48:08 2015 UTC,"You absolutely need to do high weight/low reps if you want strength. It's fine to mix in high reps too, but doing that exclusively will get you nowhere. Honestly if you want to do that, you're better off getting a pull up bar in your house and just doing that, incline/decline/triangle push ups, and core work."

AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,TheHiddenYolo,7,Thu Jul 16 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"You should do legs on the same days as your workouts(Tempos and such). Keep hard days hard and easy days easy. But if you don't want to do this (it'll be grueling and painful so I could understand why you wouldn't want to pair the two), at least don't do leg day the day before a hard workout. It'll compromise the running workout. However if getting swole is your main priority then by all means keep it as is :)"
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,TheHiddenYolo,2,Wed Jul 15 23:02:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks.... that makes complete sense so as not to compromise the quality of the tempo (I read in Advanced Marathoning that ALL other training e.g. strength, cross, etc. should be done in addition to and should not detrimentally effect your running training.  I.e don't substitute a long run for a ride).  You mention doing leg workouts on same day as tempo - but I assume you mean AFTER and not before right?  Before might compromise the run still"
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,bxctrack09,3,Thu Jul 16 16:20:59 2015 UTC,Precisely. That is if your legs can still handle it afterwards. Ive tried doing the same but its too difficult to lift heavy (any muscle groups really) after doing a workout. Also if you can do a bit of a cooldown after your leg workout then it would help with soreness later in the day. A mile or a half cooldown afterwards should suffice.
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,running_writings,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"To each their own, but I've found doing leg strength on the same day as a workout leaves my legs too dead for the workout. Personally, I find that lifting on my easy days doesn't kill me too much, and leaves me fresh enough for my workouts. But you'll find what works for you (as u/Yolo has) and go from there.   Also, focus on the warmup rather than the cooldown. You'll be a lot stiffer the next day without a solid warmup (breaking a sweat) than you would if you warmed up but skipped the cooldown. I forgot where I read it, but I've also found that out in my own running."
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,bxctrack09,7,Fri Jul 17 02:14:11 2015 UTC,"Actually current research indicates you SHOULD be doing stuff heavy! Lower reps, maybe 2-3 sets of 5 reps, at a heavy weight.  Here's a study that showed that 4 sets of 4 squats done 3x/week led to a 5% increase in running economy.  There is a lot of physiology behind why heavy weight is better than low weight/high rep, far more than I'd care to get into right now.  From what I recall, Steve Magness' book (The Science of Running) discusses the topic at length.  The long and short is that you should do a small number of compound exercises (lots of muscles involved, like squats or deadlift) for high weight, low rep.    Core and stretching and all that is fine though."
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,Paully2796,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:09:30 2015 UTC,Interesting... glad I asked the question as I had it all wrong.  Also recommendations to do legs on same day as tempo (although I suspect AFTER tempo not before).  5%.... fuck I'd love 5%!!! :)

We predominately use our slow twitch muscles to run, and low weight/high rep would just reinforce that. Doing high weight/low rep emphasizes your fast twitch."
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,NORMAL_LOOKING_VAGIN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:16:31 2015 UTC,"I have a similar training approach to yours along with what I do in the gym. However I also include a bit of upper body work, nothing intense though. Pushups, pullups, bicep curls, tricep pulls, etc. There has been articles that explain a strong upper body can help your form stay fluid when you start getting fatigued. I can say that it has helped myself, maybe it's something you could benefit from too."
AdvancedRunning,3dfkm1,NORMAL_LOOKING_VAGIN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"I forgot about this post, you never replied to my comment or messaged me, but I'll throw some advice in anyway. As others have said, high weight, low rep is good. It's the majority of what I do when I lift. I make sure I lift twice a week, and maybe do some bodyweight work once a week. Most professional runners probably do something similar, I know some lift three times a week, and I know there's some Kenyans who will never touch a weight in their life.  Anyway, I focus my day in the gym around one lift. I go in and roll everything out, take a baseball to my glutes and hamstrings, stretch very well, and do some mobility drills. My mobility drills change on what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm trying to get a larger range of motion in my shoulders right now, so I do more shoulder work than usual. I also do a bit of bodyweight work/resistance band work to get the muscles firing up, band walks, leg raises, etc...  To keep is simple, let's pretend there's only two main lifts that you do, deadlifts and squats. One could do one on A day and the other on B day, following some sort of high weight, low rep scheme. I make that my first lift. I make sure I get a full recovery between sets, I sit down or walk around staring at my phone while avoiding eye contact from other gym patrons, usually 3 or so minutes. Typically I increase weight with each set.  After the big lift is over, I go through whatever auxiliary work I have planned out. Usually stuff for upper body and core (L-sit pullups, kill two birds with one stone) as well as balance (maybe SL RDL). In total I usually do 3-4 lifts in the gym, along with a few resistance band exercises and body weight movements. The auxiliary stuff is usually done with higher reps, 8-10.  With all that said, it's time to talk about the big lifts. As an athlete, you're not interested in ""working out your glutes"" as much as you are concerned about effectively carrying out the motion of a proper, heavy squat (or deadlift, or clean, or whatever you're doing). These big lifts are useful because they create functionality over a certain range of motion. A full, deep, heavy squat will challenge everything from your ankle flexibility to abdominal strength. I suggest you really read into how to do these and work on maximizing your gains from a few big lifts. I'm a proponent of front squats over back squats for runners, this is purely based on anecdotal evidence, but the mobility required to go deep into a front squat has proved beneficial for me and those that I've helped. If you find you can't quite do a perfect squat yet, that's okay, back off and do some lifts that will prepare you for it, maybe goblet squats. While doing that, of course learn what you can to increase your mobility and strength so that you'll be more prepared next time you try.  I also suggest watching some videos and reading some stuff about the overhead squat assessment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vmnmm7otao . The gym is there to help you gain strength, sure, but injury prevention is the first priority.   Last point, look into some plyometric training. You've probably done box jumps and stuff before. At least once a week I do something that involves explosion. I cycle four big lifts actually, so I have an A, B, C, and D day, and my C day the big lift is a hang squat clean, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oH-_vOCEU . When the weight gets heavier, you'll find your feet will actually leave the ground. I've seen huge improvements in my power since starting these.  ONE MORE POINT, last thing, I promise. I suggest people lift in some form of minimalist shoe, something with zero heel to toe drop. I lift in a pair of Inov8 shoes, big among crossfitters, or you can just get a pair of Chuck's, just don't do your lifts with a big heel. If you were a powerlifter, going for max weight, then it's a different story, but we're in the weight room to create functionality through mobility and strength.  Holla at me with some questions or something."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,CatzerzMcGee,10,Wed Jul 15 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Last week was a 55 mile week for me.  No real workouts other than a 10 miler moderate run at about 6:30 pace.  Currently on another building week as I plan on doing 60 miles, then having a recovery week.  After that it's time to get serious and start knocking out some workouts again!   I am all for daily threads.  Even if they are all general discussion. Often I have funny stories from my days run or some other minor thing that doesn't warrant a new thread and I would love a place to put them. I find happiness in the middle ground.  I don't know how my body would handle tons and tons of mileage but I do know that I found most of my success in college at about 60 miles a week with a mix of super intense workouts and super easy days. My brother in law recently completed the full AT.  He 'only' averaged 20 miles a day and talked about how tough it was. Can't imagine 50 miles a day. Have to run with my smartphone.  Not just because of GPS for tracking my runs, but so my wife knows where I am.  Sometimes I'll explore new routes on my runs and go into unfamiliar places.  Go to know someone has their eye on me and that I also have a GPS to guide me if I ever got lost.  Also music is a must. I have friends I run with, but honestly, I have found that I prefer running by myself more and more.  I think it is because I like to have 100% control when it comes to pace, route and whatnot.  I also don't have to do any planning when it comes to meeting up with someone.  When I run with other people, I talk, get distracted, and often run too fast."

The only thing I would change is I would have adopted this plan earlier.  My freshman and sophomore years were plagued by a few stress fractures.  It wasn't until my junior year that I finally had a full injury free season and things really started to click.  I am probably getting in about 45 min to 1 hr of biking a week these days but it's just fun rides with my wife and nothing I bother to actually log or keep track of."

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,FlyingFartlek,6,Wed Jul 15 19:39:07 2015 UTC,"We were free to choose our routes and paces for our easy runs.  You always had a few workout warriors who would take off and roll on their easy runs.  They wondered why they were never getting faster and I always believed it was because they never truly recovered from the workouts. Then you had me.  I would be going along at a nice and enjoyable 8-8:30 pace.  I started to collect a following, mostly the freshman and mid distance guys would tag along with me.  Our coach would tell us to do an XX Minute easy run so I never had to worry about hitting a certain number of miles, just got to stay relaxed and recover.

You throw in a bunch of competitive high school standouts on the same team and no one wants to be last.  I was guilty of this, at least as a freshman.  Every run was basically max effort.  I remember it was like day 2 in college and our coach took us to a state park and had us do a run up to the top of one of the mountains.  It was the most painful thing ever as we pretty much raced to the top.  No one wanted to be the first guy to drop.  We got to the top and everyone was bent over with their hands on their knees and we were only like 4 miles into the run...on a recovery day.  I haven't been doing as many workouts since I am still building my base but I am sure once I do I'll be going easy on my off days.

One long run of 18 miles in 2:00:56, a track fartlek of 8 x (400@70, 200 jog, 200@34, 200 jog) + 4x200 @ 33. Another slightly shorter long run of 14 miles with the last 10 at 5:59 average pace.    I like the regularity. The weekly interview thread is fun to participate in, the General Discussion thread is entertaining to read through, and I'm all for new content.  I think you have to pay attention to both so you can't just choose one and neglect the other. Focusing on super low mileage with nothing but intensity might get you fit super quick for a certain race, but your durability and ability to last during hard training is compromised. On the opposite side, plodding around without any sort of quality and just easy running can get you fit enough to a point but good luck with jumping into hard race specific work without touching on anything fast for a long period. I would say that building up your mileage and quantity is a good step to being able to handle future workloads of more quality later on.   It blows my mind about the nearly 50 miles a day figure. Though, I suppose if it were the only thing to focus on and you had a resume like Jurek it could be done. I read that it is supposed to be his last competitive endurance effort before he retires? Interesting.  My iPod nano. I try and run with others as much as I can because when I run solo I tend to overthink training and other things in life. When I am running solo a good cure is putting my iPod in and just listening to podcasts so I don't really have to think about anything.    An altitude tent. If I could spring the money for it I would at least like to try it out to see if I would be a responder. I know more than a few people that do own them and the benefits seem mixed and come down to an individual level whether or not you can handle the impact on recovery.  Track spikes. I use them rarely since I don't really race on the track too often and I prefer to do track workouts in flats. For the number I have in my collection I use them quite rarely. Although, I do think it is more of a hobby to collect unique/rare ones rather than use them now.  I used to not see the point of sunglasses thinking that they were just something to spend money on if you could afford them, but boy oh boy was I wrong. I finally got a pair last summer and use them when it's sunny, but also during the winter to shield my eyes from the cold wind.    Five. Some days I really appreciate having a GPS so I can dial into certain paces, other days I don't bother and just focus on effort (especially recovery runs). I used to let my pride get in the way and want to never run slower than 7:00/mile on easy runs, now I have no problem running 8:30-9:00 pace if my body feels like that is necessary to recover."

I've not been contributing too much lately because I was sidelined with injury. I'm not ready to say I'm 100% back but I've been running two days with no pain, including a strong 5-mile tempo last night @ 5:59 (on the treadmill). I guess if I weren't able to do that, I would have been extremely concerned, but I was surprised that it was as doable as it was. My 13-mile mid long tonight is going to be the final test. If my new CEP calf sleeves and I can get through that, I'll declare my calf healed.   I love regularity but maybe I look forward to the threads we do have because they aren't every day. We could end up just repeating ourselves a ton if we have some permutation of a workout/discussion thread every day. I do like the Monday thread, though, especially as the Weekly Training Thread in /r/running is a bit overwhelming now with people I don't know. Everyone else so far has pretty much nailed it. It's not really an either/or situation. I used to think I responded better to quality than quantity but as I improve after increasing mileage and mostly keeping my workouts the same distances, I'm starting to think that I've just begun to find the right balance. It's an impressive feat. I don't have a ton of context for it and I don't know how much actual running he did (running as I think of it), so I don't sit back and marvel at how amazing it is, but I'd never say it's not a large achievement. I really do like my watch. I don't like running without it. I've never really had the problem of forcing myself to go faster than I should just because I see a number on my watch during a random aerobic run. I'd like to have spikes for the track, and I'd be interested to have a 225 that could read my HR without a strap, but I can live without it. I actually don't see the point of headphones and podcasts and music, but I think that's easily chalked up to the fact that different people have different preferences.

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,ForwardBound,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"That all sounds great. Enjoying your job is a rare thing. You don't seem to be that far away from podium position to me in 5ks, unless all the 5ks around you are crazy competitive."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,Jaime_Manger,2,Wed Jul 15 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"You can occasionally find a really small 5k in southern Brooklyn with a winner around 18:00, but most have a few guys in the 16:00-17:00 range. My recent 19:03, for example, was good for 24th place, with the top 3 finishing below 17. And that was for a weekday after-work 5k."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"That's impressive. I guess with so many people in the city it's not amazing that there are a lot of fast ones. I always think of Boston as such a running hub, but it's easy to find a race in the surrounding suburbs where it would be very possible to steal a win running above 18 minutes."

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to see Minions...so that's close enough to Ant-Man, right?   Are you going to be running outside for the 13 miles? It seems that 13 miles on the treadmill would suck..."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"I don't have a leg to stand on as far as criticizing someone else's movie taste, so go see Minions and have a great time.  Definitely going outside. I don't really mind the treadmill but I can't hide in the gym all summer so I'm going to see what I can do outside. I still have to decide on my route, though."

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 15 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"I actually don't see the point of headphones and podcasts and music   I love to have music on my run, but I love it in general.  Always have headphones in at work, I like to put on music while I have dinner with my family.  For running it just helps me zone out and enjoy myself.  My favorite thing is when a new album from one of my favorite bands comes out.  I get so excited, I load it on my phone and head out for a run as soon as I can to listen to it."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,Tweeeked,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's probably a difference. When I really want to annoy someone I call myself ""post music"" because it's a really obnoxious way of telling people I'm not exactly an audiophile. What do you listen to?"

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,qwikben,2,Wed Jul 15 19:42:06 2015 UTC,Man - I thought I was the only one! People always give me such a weird blank stare when I say I'm not that into music.

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,Jaime_Manger,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"Zero interest in Ant-Man... I did just see Amy, the Amy Winehouse movie/documentary yesterday, though. It was good.   I don't know how people get through long runs without music, but I guess it all just comes down to personal preference! I like having the noise in the background to distract me at times if I need it, but I've actually started preferring to run without music during shorter races and tempo runs."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,White_Lobster,2,Wed Jul 15 21:37:16 2015 UTC,I used to do all runs with music but I was afraid it was damaging my ears and now I can't imagine the opposite. Except when I'm on the treadmill. I like to listen through my phone's speaker. It sounds like we have a lot of opposite preferences--one of the things I like about running as opposed to other athletic pursuits is that there's still so much common ground among very dissimilar people.
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,teuker,2,Wed Jul 15 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"Oh man, potential ear damage is a valid concern... never even thought about that. I always wear one earbud in and one out so I can hear things and it's always the same ear just out of habit, so now I wonder what sort of implications that might have down the road.  Yeah, it's always interesting to learn about people's preferences and how they can so wildly differ... that's definitely one of the coolest things about running - it leaves a ton of room for individual preferences, but we still have that common ground, for sure."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,White_Lobster,7,Thu Jul 16 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"New here. Not sure if I qualify as advanced, but this seems like a good place.  I had a mixed week. Was on vacation in Durango where I ran a 4th of July 5k. I'm coming back from a long injury time out, so I wasn't expecting much, but hoped I could run in the low 20's. Finished fourth behind some college kids (that was the good news), but ran in the high 21's. The course was long, but not that long. On the upside, I did a 12 miler a couple of days later and hit my Pfitz goal paces easily. So not sure what the takeaway is from that.   I always look forward to reading these ""summer of"" discussions since they seem to draw out more people. Structure is good, I think. When I started running seriously again last year, I used the FIRST method, which is all about quality. I'm not convinced that doing all hard miles is safe unless you already have a huge base. I'm doing Pfitz now and I think I prefer more slow mileage and more total days.  As I'm getting older, I notice more of my friends doing ultra endurance events. Huge respect, but not for me. Ever since my bike racing days in college, I've had a strict ""one meal"" rule: I'll do just about anything as long as I only have to skip one meal to do it.  I hate to say it, but I'm a slave to my GPS watch. I'd love to be able to pay for more frequent massage. I won a fancy running water bottle last summer that I used once and swore I'd never use again.  Anybody have experience training at altitude and racing at sea level? Sure, you can go faster, but were your joints ready for it?"
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,FlyingFartlek,2,Wed Jul 15 18:08:09 2015 UTC,Advanced running isn't about time! It's about whether or not you love the sport!  What type of fancy water bottle is it? I've tried carrying a regular water bottle with me and it's a pain to hold.
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"It was this one: http://www.rei.com/product/846179/salomon-sense-hydro-s-lab-handheld-hydration-set  Not sure if I would just hate running with anything in my hand, or just this one. Now that my runs are getting longer and it's still hot, I may have to experiment."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,Tweeeked,6,Wed Jul 15 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're advanced. Welcome to the club.  I agree with /u/ForwardBound --the one meal rule is spot-on. Hell, even skipping one meal is too much"
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,White_Lobster,3,Wed Jul 15 18:37:10 2015 UTC,"I also have a (possibly temporary) ""no missed sleep"" rule. My 2-year-old has only recently started sleeping through the night reliably. After that first year, getting up every couple of hours, the idea of voluntarily being sleep deprived again seems insane to me. I never realized how awesome sleep truly is."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,TRAVxxTAZ,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"5 - I have a little bit of experience with that.  I've only lived at altitude for a year, but I've raced at sea level four times in that period.  As long as you're doing some work at 100-110% of your goal sea level race pace (regardless of distance), you should be fine.  This could be 400-500m repeats at goal sea level 5k pace with short rest, mile repeats at sea level 10k pace, or shorter intervals with long rest to focus on speed (just a few examples).  Strides after your easy runs also help your body's efficiency at faster paces."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,BilldozerVT,2,Wed Jul 15 18:55:55 2015 UTC,I like your one meal rule.
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,TRAVxxTAZ,2,Wed Jul 15 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"were your joints ready for it?   I didn't even know this was a thing! But come to think of it I do get minor joint pain in my right hip. Anyway, I think /u/FlyingFartlek's advice is spot on. Get comfortable at altitude and you will kill your sea level races.  What is your 5k PR? With an 87 half I feel like you should be sub-20."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,BilldozerVT,2,Wed Jul 15 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"My 5k PR (last summer) is in the mid-18's. I'm not in that kind of shape right now, but not even breaking 21 was a shock. I have my work cut out for me, I guess.  I've heard from cyclists here in town that racing at sea level after a long winter of training in the mountains can be hard because they lack power. Makes sense in a bike race, but I'm not sure how much that applies to running. My plan is to run a marathon in Denver in October. If that goes poorly, I'll fly to Santa Barbara and chew the air in November."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,TRAVxxTAZ,5,Wed Jul 15 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"55 miles last week. Still building up to 65 for XC. Shooting for 60 this week. Having some weird chest pains every time I run which started this past Sunday on my LR. Odd. Getting it checked out tomorrow at the doc. Safety first right?   ""Shoe Review of the Week""? or ""Shoe of the week?"" type of thing Well, currently I am running mostly easy base building miles but eventually Ill be throwing in more structured workouts here soon. So both? I can't even imagine 50 miles a day. Not sure I have the 'ultra runner gene' in me I love my Garmin 220. I think it would be cool to get the HR monitor that is compatible with it."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Wed Jul 15 18:51:30 2015 UTC,You seem to be on a very similar running plan as me!  60 this week and then eventually adding in workouts.  What are your goals this upcoming season?

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,FlyingFartlek,2,Wed Jul 15 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"Also, I really enjoy your throwback race reports!   Thanks, they are a ton of fun to do!  I honestly don't know what my goals are at the moment.  I am just kind of letting my body talk to me as I build up mileage.

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,chickenwithcheez,2,Thu Jul 16 01:36:21 2015 UTC,Just found one on Amazon for 39.99 + free shipping so I jumped on it!
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,teuker,7,Thu Jul 16 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"/u/cookingwine, that's pretty cool that running was so huge in your mom's life but she never made you get into it and just let you discover running on your own! Wow, sounds like your work gives you a lot of very interesting things to do - never a dull moment in that job, it sounds like!  Ended last week with about 36 miles and still felt pretty strong, despite it being the highest mileage week I've had in a non-peak week ever... hoping to keep that feeling going when I start Pfitz 12/55 in a few weeks. Recovery week this week, should be around 31ish miles.   I really like that new weekly thread, and I love structure and routine, so I'm all for it. I can see the value of both, though I've really liked incorporating quality runs into my training. My ""quantity"" is really not that much, so I'm not sure which has worked better for me. I just can't fathom averaging 50 miles a day for a month and a half. I haven't ever averaged 50 miles a WEEK for that long.  I love my Garmin watch. I forgot it the other week when I went to a group run, and I felt so weird. I'd love to own a better watch (see #5), since I'm using the Forerunner 10, which I got around Christmas 2012. I have compression socks (does that count as tech?) but I don't think I've ever worn them during a long run because I get too hot... I've put them on later in the day just for walking around my apartment - does that have any benefit whatsoever, or am I better off just not bothering?  Decided that my reward to myself for studying for (and passing. I hope.) my massive exam in mid-August will be a Garmin 225. I've been putting off studying and I need to pass it to stay in the program, so I figured that this will motivate me to stop procrastinating and get started with some review. I really want a shiny new 225 to play with... NEED MORE DATA."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,Tweeeked,4,Wed Jul 15 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"Good week so far.   Awesome 8ish mile tempo on monday. To be specific, it was 7.73 @ 5:46 min/mile. My friend was plagued with achilles pain, so I had to run this one on my own pacing. I started off pretty fast (but I always do ;)), and then, for once, kept up the pace the whole time. I slowed down a bit in the middle, but I ran the 2.7 mile slight-downhill @ 5:03 pace. It felt like I was completely hammering it and going at interval pace, so I am pleased with that. At this exact time last year, I was running the same 7.73 @ 7:02 pace.   On tuesday, I ran a pretty moderate effort 8.9 @ 6:40 min/mile (I think I should've gone slower) and then an easy double in the afternoon.  I chilled today and ran an easy 5.24 @ 8:11 min/mile, and I plan to do a similar paced double tonight. Tomorrow I've got a vicious 9-10 mile hill run awaiting me, so I am anxious for that!   I am fine with the structure right now, but I wouldn't mind more weekly threads (I don't have any ideas, though). I try to mix both in my training, but right now I am definitely focusing more on quality. My original plan for this summer was to be at 60 mpw by now, but I am barely scraping up to 50 and running harder workouts then I thought I would. That is a lot of miles! My shoes. I can run without a watch (although I definitely prefer having a watch). I just really don't like barefoot running, it hurts my feet a lot."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,teuker,3,Wed Jul 15 16:51:40 2015 UTC,Heck of a tempo!  Looks like you're hitting the strength work pretty hard!  Nice job.
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,BilldozerVT,5,Wed Jul 15 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"So what made your Pfirst Pfitz into the leg-breaking disaster it was? Low base or something else? You've gone for a lower plan this time around--how do you feel in comparison?    Personally, I've kinda been on a run-crushing streak. I'm headed up to the Homeland (MN) tomorrow to do a 5-miler race with some Hood to Coast teammates--I'm curious about how I stack up against them. I never beat any of them in college 8k races...but that was a decade ago and I'm in better shape now, I think (which has me going ""whoa"" and slightly kick myself for missed opportunities back then. But because of travel and such, I have two long runs (20/22) in a 7-day span, which has spurred my wild hair to try for 100 miles in that timeframe. I'm at 56 from Sunday, leaving three days to get the last 44. This'll be fun.  1) I'm generally a fan of looser structure; these discussion threads are the reddit highlights of my week. I'd rather have less ""official"" threads and more anarchous content.  2) gosh, I think I use both. I'm doing mileage but I think that all those are focused in some way--very few miles done just to run (well, I'm doing some filler this week to hit triple digits, but generally...)  3) good for scott. That's nuts.  4) I love my swift wick socks. Especially in Texas summers. My feet would be wrecked otherwise. I generally don't want anything too fancy. Maybe some heart rate stuff would be cool, but I'm indifferent.  5) Racing the Rain is out! The story of young Quentin Cassidy. I'm about 20% into it and I will say it's MUCH more cohesive than Again to Carthage. Also, Parker definitely throws back to the Walton race early on. Any other early thoughts?"

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,CookingWine,6,Wed Jul 15 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"Cooking Wine is such a great song.  I was (am) also a huge Alk3 fan, one of my favorite concerts was them and Saves the Day up at the Rave.  They had the lead singer from Saves the Day come out to do part of Radio, his voice was perfect for it.  Dashboard was also there, but he sucks.  This is what happens when you live in Illinois in the late 90s early 00s.    The Seattle/Chicago bike ride also sounds amazing.  My week:  I did a cutback/taper/whatever excuse you want, 45 miles.  I did a 10 miler over the weekend, first half was a shit show, 2nd half was actually well raced.      I approve.  I think the structure works with the fairly specific WooW, then this thread being more guided but big picture stuff, and the Saturday thread being a free for all.  Not sure if there is enough room for any other weekly threads.  I think you need to build quantity and then add in quality.  Take a step back from quality to build more quantity.  Repeat.  It comes down to cycling the training properly.  And by ""properly"", I mean what works for you.  The record that he beat, where the lady didn't run, just walked was perhaps more impressive.  I think there is also an ""unsupported"" record.  The act itself is clearly impressive, but I don't know if enough honest attempts at it have been made for me to be impressed by the record.  I should use my heart rate monitor more.  Decided to go with Pfitz 18/70 for Nashville.  Bombed out the first run, so we are off to a good start.  I decided to go with it because I think the volume is appropriate for me and should allow me to mix in more cross training without breaking myself.  That's right, I'm hitting the gym.  After beach week next week."

Punishment for the lack of quality.   Oh wow, what a great thread. Whoever came up with that one sure is smart. Both. I think I'm getting to the point where just adding quantity won't do it anymore, so I really need to get on my quality sessions and nail them. Sounded like he had an injury early on, so good for him for finishing. Only by 3 hours though, so it is still breakable. Gotta be my watch. When I didn't have a watch it wasn't too bad, but now that I'm used to it things are just that much easier. No need to plot out routes and calculate pace. I would like to own an AlterG treadmill. You didn't say it had to be realistic. I never used my chest strap HR monitor, so it is great that the 225 has an optical one. Annnnd I don't see the point in water belts on city paths. There's water fountains everywhere! Going to do the Ice Cream Sandwich workout on Saturday, except up it a bit. 12:00 tempo + 6x1:00 hard + 12:00 tempo. 3:00 rest after tempo, 1:00 rests after hard. It's a lot of fun."

I can't think of anything to have as another weekly thread but I don't see why we shouldn't have one.  •I think I lean a bit more toward quantity in my training. I just love getting the miles in. A lot of times I'll put in a lot of quality though. In track towards the middle-end of the season we had almost nothing but tough workouts the whole time.   •It's pretty amazing. I'm not sure how I feel about ultra running. On one hand the sheer distance amazes me, but I can't imagine how slogging out 15 minute miles is fun.   •My Garmin Forerunner 110 is my lifeline. I love that thing to death. If there was one thing I wish I had it would probably a nicer GPS watch that measures cadence and stuff like that. Also wish I had a treadmill for the winter months.  •I've noticed my fitness getting better in workouts and in races/time trials, yet my tempo pace hasn't gotten any faster. It doesn't really bother me but I found it weird.  Edit: At the doctors office for a physical for school and they took a reading on the amount of oxygen going through my blood. I forgot what the reading was called but she said whatever it is 98, and the best is 100. I don't know what any of that means. Also, apparently I'm 5'9, not the almost 5'11 I've been telling people.

My BF from back in the day in HS has biked from Chicago to Seattle, and also lived in Africa after graduating college. But it was East Africa, and not Peace Corp, and his mom wasn't the XC coach. Phew. Anyway, I'll try to up my activity in /r/NYCruns.  I'm in my last week of base building before launching into fall training. To spice things up this week, for the first time ever on Monday I went out of my way to steal the CR on a Strava segment. It was fun! I found another where I'm only 4 sec away from the CR so that is next on my list.    I liked reading the WoW thread. I think we should definitely keep it up. It's a great way to find some new workouts to try out.  My HS coach was all about Quality (which, when capitalized, always makes me think of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance), so I stuck with that approach for years. But now I'm really seeing the benefit of Quantity, as well, so I'm working on building that up as well. I hope to one day find a good balance. A very impressive feat. 50 mi/day for 46 days is mind boggling. My watch. Definitely my watch (FR 220). I've had a near meltdown before when my watch failed to acquire satellites after 15 minutes, thus making it so I didn't have time to get in my tempo run before work. I can't function without it."

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,duhrandomkid,5,Wed Jul 15 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"64 miles last week for me.  Finally hit the 1,000 mile mark for the year, a bit behind schedule.  Doing the Rock'n'Roll HM this Sunday in Chicago.  I'm in the middle of Pfitz 18/70 for a fall marathon, so I'm treating this as a tune-up race.  Not expecting a PR, but it'll be nice to get out there and race.  Weather report is predicting high humidity levels, thunderstorms with strong winds, chance of hail, and a high of 92.  Between the weather and the fact that my legs have felt heavy lately, this should be awesome.   I love the regularity of the weekly threads.  As corny as it sounds, I look forward to them. I agree with everyone else that a balance has to be struck.  All quantity is boring.  All quality is unsustainable.   I like that it's based on an honor system.  I met Jurek at a marathon expo a few years ago.  He was signing autographs outside of the Brooks booth.  I talked to him briefly and he seems like a genuinely nice dude.  His stats speak for themselves, but it's always nice when they turn out to be a good person on top of all that. Man, I guess my foam roller.  It hurts so good.  I even pack it when I travel.  I could get by without my GPS watch.  I know all the mile markers on my route. I try not to look at my watch unless I'm doing a workout.  My easy pace can vary by up to 20 seconds/mile from day to day depending on how I feel, so I try not to let the watch dictate my speed.  Otherwise ego will cloud judgement and the next thing you know, you're wasting your time. I wish I had easy access to a pool to do pool running for cross-training.  I can't justify getting a gym membership for it.  As for things I don't use, I bought a pair of calf sleeves two years ago, and I never use them.  I've tried them all kinds of way: therapeutically for sore calves, post-run for recovery, and during runs.  Anecdotally, I've never noticed a difference.  Related to question #4, the thing I really would like is not gear at all, but a real-life coach.  I was a better soccer player than runner in high school, so I never had the luxury of having a running coach tell me what to do.  Reading Pftiz or Daniels is great, but it would be nice to have someone look at me run for a few weeks and give me constructive criticism.  Am I going too fast?  Not pushing hard enough?  What are my weaknesses?  I could always use a bigger base, so I don't feel I need a coach to improve.  But it would be nice to get some feedback sometimes."
AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,FlyingFartlek,5,Thu Jul 16 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"Last week was a recovery week in the 18/55 plan but this week starts off in full force. Just ran 10 miles w/5@ HM paced - taking in account as much as possible the humidity.  1) I really like the Workout of the Week thread, Summer of X thread, and also the General Discussion thread that u/AlwaysInjured posts at random times (aka like 3AM). I think another thread could be good to have on Thursday or Friday just not sure what..  2) I think that any mileage should be quality, based on the purpose of your workout - this might mean you need large quanities of miles. One thing that has really stuck with me is that I recall u/dtrunsthis mentioning how you should know the purpose of the workout. Why are you running certain mileage and what is your end purpose.   3) It's nuts to think how much he ran per day. 50 miles is basically my weekly total right now...  4) Love my GPS watch! But I have too much technology on me really anyways...   Though I'd love to get an altimeter watch just to see elevation accuracy  5) Really liked this interview. Looks like you ( u/cookingwine ) made some nice improvements in time! I'd love to get sub 1:30 in a half down the road.

I went 16:26 in the race, which is a road PR, but not what I was looking for.  I wasn't super fresh for the race, though, because I flew across the country with an hour layover and got five hours of sleep the night before (due to flight delays...).      I think the structure is what keeps people coming back to AR, so I'm all for it.  I go for a good mix of both, especially when I don't have any immediate races.  When the workouts get really tough, though, I find myself skimping a bit on quantity because of overtraining issues I've had in the past.  I'd rather hit the workouts as hard as I can than run a few more miles and feel completely spent.  Such a crazy effort!  Some people are ripping on him for ""only"" being a few hours ahead of the previous record holder, Jennifer Pharr Davis, but those claims are bogus because the current trail is a bit longer than the previous record and he did it in the tougher direction.  Like everyone else is saying, I can't live without my GPS watch.  I don't have black/white original Matumbo track spikes, but would love to own some as a collector's item.  One thing I own but never use is my ipod while running.  Also, I never really saw the point of running-specific hydration backpacks **for runs shorter than 2 hours in desolate areas.

One staple workout we have done quite a bit in the last few months is 10x500m with 1:00 rest.  I live at 5300 feet, and at that altitude it simulates what you could probably do in a sea level 5k on the track when you add up all the splits (meaning, if you do it at sea level, you could probably run the cumulative time plus 20-30 seconds).  We also do a 3-5 mile tempo and sessions of 5-7x2:30 hill repeats every couple of weeks.  Basically, we will do one strength workout and one speed workout each week to keep in touch with both systems.  My 10x500m splits usually add up to about 15:50 and my tempos are usually in the 5:35-5:50 pace range.  Hope that helps!"

My 15 miles, split between a 7 mile day and an 8 mile day, was the lowest since Jan 24th. I'm eliminating all ""non essential"" runs to try to get back on track to hit a solid time at Marine Corps in October.   All for the idea.

Included a beer mile (8:20, 4th out of 20+ people) and an unplanned 7-mile trail run after my bike got its 4th flat tire in 4 rides (was supposed to be a rest/cross-training day). Pretty sure the tire needs replacing, as it keeps killing tubes.  Right hamstring tendonitis is feeling good, but after this morning's run, the left hamstring/knee feels exactly like the right one did when the whole saga started months ago. Nooooo! Need to be really careful and make sure this one doesn't drag on. Hopefully some good rest and rolling nips it in the bud.   +1 on the weekly threads. Enjoyed the workout thread, though I had nothing really to add this week. I've been going more for quantity at easy pace in an attempt to stave off the seemingly never-ending injuries. But I've definitely seen in the last few weeks that a few quality/harder workouts have really helped push my progress as I was starting to plateau on the easy stuff. Maybe a little too much ""quality"" (trail run last night, went hard) got to the other knee this time. Amazing. No way my body could ever endure that! Can't go without GPS. If it isn't logged, it didn't happen! Can't think of any running stuff I really want, but for general athletic gear, I'd eventually like to eventually get a real bike (probably a tri bike). Currently have a 15+ year old mountain bike, using road tires for the occasional sprint triathlon. Although it's always fun to pass people on their $5,000 bikes. I probably have stuff I never use or wouldn't buy, but I can't think of it because I don't use it! To keep things interesting while running easy miles, I've started occasionally drawing things with my GPS tracklogs. So far I've done Darth Vader (on Star Wars day), a turtle, a horse head (went through an equestrian center), and an American flag (on Flag Day). I have a dog route planned, but it goes through a trail that's currently closed for repair."

Crazy to think at the start of June I was running 30 miles a week and my max was 55. Looking forward to XC camp next week, lots of great runs and good food ahead.   1) I'm all for more discussion, and obviously so is this subreddit. All the General Discussion threads and Summer of threads always have  huge comment sections. We're a talkative bunch.  2) I'm a quanity guy myself. My greatest improvements have always been after I increased the mileage. When I increased my base just ten miles in the spring, I improved a whole 30 seconds in the 3200 in just two months. Last summer, I went from 25mpw-45mpw and my 3 mile time went from 19 minutes-17 minutes. Of course, quality runs in the form of workouts are important for sharpening your race pace and building confidence, but I've read  and belief that the base period in training results in the biggest changes. Hence why I'm running 80mpw.   3) Mind blowing. I have a lot of respect for trail runners, it's a very different kind of running. I'd even call it riskier; today I went for just a short loop around a local trail and had to watch my footing, my surroundings, and let the pace come naturally. Relaxing and not relaxing at the same time.  4) Ever since I got my GPS watch last year, we've been like Run Gum and Nick Symmonds. Inseparable. I just love having that sense of accomplishment when you see your culmination of weekly runs on strava and are able to track your progress so easily. Really changed the sport for me."

Then jogged back about 6.5 to a track, then I did 2 x 2 miles with a 400m jog rest at slightly faster than marathon pace (about 13:50 for each 2 mile).

AdvancedRunning,3de6jp,thebulljames,3,Thu Jul 16 01:27:20 2015 UTC,"72.5 miles this week with a 5k on Thursday night and Long 14 on Sunday. 4th week in a row above 70! 5k time was the same as last month. The dew point at the time of the race was 76 and it was tough to get a lot of good oxygen. Long 14 on Sunday felt terrible, like I was constantly out of breath. I had blood work done after a recent sinus infection-like issue, and everything came back normal. I have focused on eating a lot more this week, and actually have been feeling much better. I try to watch what I eat, but running a decent amount of mileage and riding ~9 miles a day commuting to work, maybe I just wasn't getting enough food.   Love daily threads, they give the community something to look forward to. I would say I started with more quality, but have been trying to find the middle ground by bumping up mileage. I think I handle higher mileage pretty well, and being a bigger guy, my body is slowly transitioning to be more efficient over the years. Jurek is incredible. I saw him speak a few years ago and was so impressed. I was a vegetarian for 4 years+ and he was someone I looked up to a lot.  I love podcasts when I run, and I purchased some bluetooth headphones earlier this year. They're one of those things you don't realize how much you really love them until you use them. Chicago half this weekend, hoping I recover well going into the race and am able to put something decent together."

Also, it would be awesome to see what everyone else is doing to try to get a little bit of competitiveness going. Our coach currently has us track mileage on paper in order to make sure we do it, and so he can easily access this.   Some ideas:   On the coaches side, allow him to group runners (ie a fast group, middle group, and whatnot), so that he doesn't have to individualize each person unless necessary. Make sure that there are weekly summaries for each runner as well, so that the coach wouldnt have to look at each individual day unless he thinks something is wrong. It would be good to allow a coach to comment on each run, like maybe commenting to say they should slow down on their easy day or something."

Keep your biking/swimming to about the same time as you would run (so if you would normally run for 40 minutes, bike for 40 minutes) and you should be able to handle the first couple weeks of mileage. You may be a little sore at first, but your body can semi-quickly adapt to running after biking for about a month. So long as you train adequately offland, you will be A-OK.

AdvancedRunning,3dadqy,kkruns,2,Wed Jul 15 03:40:10 2015 UTC,I would start with trying to identify any potential causes just to be sure you are doing everything you can as the mileage ramps up.  It may very well be due to the sudden increase but I would still go through some of the basics.  I am no doctor but from my person experience any time I have had a running issue it could be traced back to one of the following:   Are you shoes old? Are you doubling and if so are you making sure to rotate shoes so you don't wear the same pair twice in a day? How is your calcium intake? How is your core strength/ form (as you near the end of the run do you find yourself 'dragging' and possibly altering form to cause pressure on parts of your body that aren't used to it?)? Are you allowing enough recovery time in between runs and are you properly recovering during that time?   Hope some of this helps.

This official description spiked my interest:  ""We measure Ground-contact time, heel-contact time, strike pattern, and symmetry. We complement this with cadence, step length, speed, trajectory, and all other GPS based data. Heel-contact time and symmetry are very important parameters to measure if you want to maximise your performance. This data is combined into your personal running profile, through which you can see your evolution over time. The data is then used to determine which exercises you should do to further improve your technique. For this we use an extensive database in which we exactly match specific exercises with your technique parameters, your goals, and your personal information.""

It's very hard to change your existing form even after getting the stats on ground contact time, strike pattern, symmetry,etc...

AdvancedRunning,3d7581,chill1995,6,Tue Jul 14 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend when getting to the startline talking to the pacer and asking what their strategy will be, some pacers might like to have a few minutes in the bank if they know the course will have hills and such.  There is normally one guy who is running for guntime (when the gun goes off) and one guy running for net time (from when you cross the startline) so the front and back guy can have a bit of space between them, this is known as 'the bus.'    When I ran my only half the 4:30(per km) pacer was still right on my side at 3km in when I was running at around 4:00(per km) which was super weird considering it was a mainly flat course, luckily right after they dropped off but it can play mindgames with you.  It's important not to get discouraged by the pacers either going too fast or too slow as it's a long race and things can change rapidly for the worse or the better.     I've paced 5km runs before at parkrun and it's bloody hard work, make sure you give them a handshake at the end and thank them for volunteering to help."
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,esjay_,6,Tue Jul 14 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"My take is that pacers are a tool.  You are free to use them, and if they help you to a good race - that's great.  But if you run a bad race and try to complain that the pacer was an idiot; well, you're the idiot who kept with the pacer.  It is your race, you are responsible.  But yeah, try to touch base with the pacer at the expo or in the start corral to get an idea of what they are aiming to do.  Specifically the first part."
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,callthebluff,3,Tue Jul 14 14:22:32 2015 UTC,"Use the pacer to keep yourself from going out too fast.   Don't run right on top of the poor guy, just keep him within 10m or so.  I'd say over the last 5km if you feel good then start putting distance between you and the group."
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,spartygw,3,Tue Jul 14 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"This is the best advice. I've paced a decent number of halfs and fulls and all you'll really get from the pacer (if they're any good, imo) is avoiding going out too fast. Endorphins are high and the whole field will go out way too fast for the first mile and the pacer should help you contain that enthusiasm.  Otherwise, most pacers tend to try to run pretty even splits (that's almost always been my strategy and what I encouraged the pacers I organized to do) and that's just about the only sane way to pace, but it's often not the best tactical approach you can take on the course. For instance, I've paced the Seattle Marathon a bunch of times and the first half is basically flat and there are a couple climbs in the last 4 miles. There are three strategies you could try for this (or any race):  1) go out faster (in the first half, not the first mile which I believe is always a bad idea) and put some time in the bank to lose a little time on the late hills. Personally, I don't like this idea. It's pragmatic, but for me it reflects the expectation you're going to fade and slow down. While that may be realistic, I just don't like the idea of expecting to start to give in during the race.  2) even splits. This is a great idea, but my experience pacing is that just about the only one who does this is the pacer. By about mile 10/20 - nobody I started with is with me. They've either pushed ahead or fallen back and I spend most of the last 3/6 miles trying to discourage the people I'm passing from dying.  3) try to negative split. Pretty hard in a half, IMO, particularly on a full course with a tough second half.  You'll know what's best for you (hopefully) - I would definitely encourage you to talk with the pacer and try to get a sense of the strategy and also whether they know the course or not. I had a pacer in Eugene who didn't know the course and at a poorly marked section of the course actually took us on a wrong turn briefly.  Good luck!"
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,slipperyp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:58:21 2015 UTC,Thank you for pacing. I always run with pacers if available. They provide a great service to us.
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,spartygw,3,Tue Jul 14 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"All pacers are different, and all pacers are potentially faster than the sign they are holding.  If they realize that they are 3 minutes behind at the 12 mile mark, get ready for a ride, because they can and will do it.  I would get a watch and train/practice with it and follow the watch along with keeping an eye on the pacer.  It is always good to run with a group because people tend to speed up and slow down when they are by themselves.  With a group they all counter act each other which gives for a better stable pace."
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,SanDiegoMitch,3,Tue Jul 14 05:15:20 2015 UTC,"I've only used pacers for marathons, but generally I'll stick towards the front of the pace group and banter with people just as a distraction and to make sure I don't lose track of them.   Somewhere around mile 20~22, I'll start gradually pulling ahead and pick up the pace a little each mile to make sure I have a decent margin to go under my goal time. For a half I guess I'd break off around mile 10~11."
AdvancedRunning,3d7581,unthused,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"I ran with the 4:30/km pacer in my last HM (I was shooting for exactly that pace, ended up running slightly faster finishing in 1:34).   I was very grateful that I did.  I didn't know there was going to be a pacer for that time so it was a pleasant surprise when I saw him in the start area.  I decided on the spot to go with him.  We were a group of around 15-20 people (in a race of about 3000).    I moved up and down on the group, sometimes being 5m from the pacer, sometimes 10m back, but never broke contact with the group.  He was great and ran perfectly even splits, all kms splits between 4:2x and 4:3x.  He pushed a little on the uphills but it was mostly a flat course.    I left the pacer behind after the only significant hill (a highway overpass) with about 5km because I was feeling great and I went on to finish almost a minute ahead of him in the end, but it was great having him there to pace me for the first 16km.  This was my third HM in two years and the first one I did with a pacer.  I would reccommend it.  I also have an upcoming HM in a couple of months and I wish I could have a pacer for my target time but I don't think I'll be that lucky this time..."

AdvancedRunning,3d7lsa,hipporun,3,Tue Jul 14 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're asking about whether or not we ascribe to philosophy of running a lot no matter how slowly or maintain a good pace at whatever mileage we can.   I ascribe to the latter. I have always coached by coaches who wanted quality miles - no junk miles. Recovery runs in season are still pretty quick. No run is done at a stupid slow pace just for the sake of logging miles. I like this philosophy, because you're more likely to reach full potential for any given mileage if you're running the miles really fast. Also if you can handle mileage build up this way, you can become an aerobic beast. Currently trying that."

Theoretically you may be able to come in at 16:10-15 but I think running the first one conservatively is a good idea.  Running the perfect 5k is just not something that you can get in one shot, I don't think.  Not sure what to tell you as far as the 10k, I think your training mileage will have a bigger negative effect there.  Plus heat will make a bigger impact.

AdvancedRunning,3d68my,BilldozerVT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:40:27 2015 UTC,"Don't shoot for a time.  If you have been doing your summer training right and loading up mileage, race pace is going to feel pretty uncomfortable.  Just get out at a decent pace (whatever feels 'decent' on that day) and don't kill yourself.  Try to have fun, it's summer and you have a whole season ahead of you."
AdvancedRunning,3d68my,little_runner_boy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"I was never really focused on the 5k, but my fastest was 16:50.  I haven't run a competitive mile in two years, but during marathon training I would do mile repeats and the fastest I got was like a 4:55.  So you could definitely shoot for around a 16:30-ish."
AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,ngagraves,5,Sun Jul 12 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to put this in perspective, maybe someone can help. 46 days 8 hours is the new record, 1,112 hours. Old record was 1,115. So less than 1%? .5%? How would that translate to the marathon? I'm assuming it has to be a few seconds"
AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,x_country813,7,Mon Jul 13 01:38:03 2015 UTC,This kind of feat cannot be scaled in the way you are thinking.

AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,niborg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"Not just somewhere along the way, within the first 250 miles. Rough start."
AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,AddingMachine,2,Mon Jul 13 11:28:11 2015 UTC,"50 miles a day means a good amount of this must have been actual running, right?"
AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,ForwardBound,9,Sun Jul 12 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, he ran a good chunk, yes. However, he only beat the previous record by three hours, and the previous record-holder (Jennifer Pharr Davis) speed-hiked the whole thing. Didn't run at all, apparently."
AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,CookingWine,7,Mon Jul 13 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting that there are different ways of approaching it. I guess that makes sense, given how gigantic the whole thing is."
AdvancedRunning,3d29gu,ForwardBound,7,Mon Jul 13 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"I think he was originally shooting for 42 days and change, but had some injuries limit his early mileage. The man slept 10 hours total in the past 5 days to get it done, including 1 hour the night before the final push."
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,Devmurph18,7,Sun Jul 12 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"I ran. It was hot, but no worse than previous years. 1:07. Golf course, as always, is tough. But the hill that killed me was the one between mile 6-7."
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,qwikben,5,Sun Jul 12 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"I ran it. It was hot, but I ran about where I thought I would, given my fitness (which is pretty bad right now). I feel like I ran pretty smart though, not wasting energy weaving at the beginning, grinding through miles 4 and 7, picking up time in 5 and 8, and spending whatever was left at the end.   Good compared to last year, when I overestimated my fitness, went out too hard, and refused to acknowledge my inability to hold goal pace, crashing and burning hard."
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,Fran,6,Sun Jul 12 17:13:54 2015 UTC,"Yep. I've done it 15 years in a row (I grew up around there) and this was my 10th sub-60 clocking. It wasn't too terribly hot this year which helped quite a bit. My hamstring tendon is still a bit fucky so I was glad that it held up for the race, although it's very cranky now. I do love that race though; it's one of my favorite days of the year."
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,xcgeorge,2,Sun Jul 12 18:36:54 2015 UTC,One of my favorites too. Live in CA and always sad to miss it. Congrats on sub-60!
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,Phaxda,4,Sun Jul 12 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yup. I decided to run this race on a whim and didn't really have any goals or expectations coming in. I was a bit sluggish in the first couple miles, but then started to find my groove. That hill near the golf course got to me a bit, but that huge downhill afterwards saved me. All in all I had a good race and came in at 56:35! The post race party was awesome too. Definitely plan on running this one again next year."
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,SuperSonic315,4,Mon Jul 13 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy to see my hometown race being discussed here. I don't live in NY anymore, but I may just have to drive back to run it next year. Glad to hear the course is still kicking people's butts. :)"
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,Erdrick,3,Mon Jul 13 11:06:05 2015 UTC,"My third year running it;   77:59 this year.  Improved my time by 6 minutes each year, so I'm learning..."
AdvancedRunning,3d0ztu,mikethescott,2,Mon Jul 13 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"My second year running it. 1:15 for me, which is not even close to my normal pace. My girlfriend registered me and I somehow ended up with an orange bib in the back of the pack. I couldn't get through the pack until after the golf course and was running 1-2 min/mile slower than I wanted to. By then I just gave up and embraced the awesome crowd.  The after party is amazing. One of the best around.   Edit: grammar"

AdvancedRunning,3cxirz,Enkaybee,2,Sun Jul 12 17:28:02 2015 UTC,Ran it twice in High School! I remember watching Hassan Mead dominate in both high school and college on that course.
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,AlwaysInjured,25,Sat Jul 11 16:33:53 2015 UTC,Guys I am feeling so euphoric right now. I just crushed a 4.25 mile tempo @ 5:33 pace. The split for 3 miles alone would break my 3 mile pr from last year of 17:05! I am feeling more and more confident about breaking 15:30 in late September. All I need to do now is keep training consistently and hard and not get injured =D
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,duhrandomkid,9,Sat Jul 11 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"If you don't get injured, and can get even a half decent day, you'll crush 4:41 and 15:30. Do you live in Illinois by chance?"

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,duhrandomkid,3,Sat Jul 11 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is so great. I think the moment after a good run or race is one of my favorite things about running. Self-satisfaction."
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,LetGroove,5,Sat Jul 11 19:09:29 2015 UTC,Incredible! You and I have the exact same goal and PR in the three Mile! I wish you the best of luck!

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,LetGroove,3,Sat Jul 11 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm only just getting back into sped work. I've been building up to 80 mpw and that was my main focus, even if it meant a lot of easy mileage. However, this week I got in a Tempo run of 6:10 pace for four miles. Not what I was hoping for, but this week I'll get in a session before the temperature rises and hopefully on flat road so I can really put more effort into the tempos."

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,Tweeeked,11,Mon Jul 13 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"I should hit 67 miles this week, all in singles. That might be a record for singles, I don't really know. Been walking a lot though so my legs are tired. Just did an easy today instead of a tempo. My interval/fartlek workout earlier in the week didn't go too well either. I guess this week will be considered a down week workout-wise.  But I've been walking lots cuz it's the Calgary Stampede! Wooo. Watched the rodeo yesterday and going back again today to see it again for Wildcard Saturday. So much fun. Anyway, next week I'll buckle down on the workouts."
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,Xenuz,7,Sat Jul 11 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"Woah, I'm building up my mileage right now and 45+ is starting to feel like a lot in only singles. If you don't mind me asking, what does your week look like with that many miles in all singles?"

I'm finally able to do some faster pace stuff without feeling like death after a few minutes. My mileage is still rising but not too fast.

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,Tweeeked,3,Sat Jul 11 18:48:10 2015 UTC,Fully out for about 6 months. I've been running for about a month now.
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,dinosaurdinosrawr,10,Sat Jul 11 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"Woohoo, 20 mile run done. Got out there a little later than I would've liked, the heat was a struggle. And to top it off, when I finished and was walking up the hill home, this dude who I frequently see while running (to the point where we recognize each other and wave hey and verbally acknowledge each other and how miserable it is out when we cross paths, but I don't think we've ever officially met) thought it was a good idea to say ""you look hot"" ... not in the ""yeah girl, you look hot!"" way, it was definitely in the ""you look like shit, should I call you an ambulance"" way. Yeah buddy, it's 85 degrees and I just finished a four hour run, yes I am drenched in sweat and not looking incredible, thanks for pointing that out.   Sorry for being cranky and whiny, I haven't eaten real food yet post-run because all I have in my fridge is eggs, condiments, and 3lbs of blueberries that I picked yesterday. Speaking of, does anyone have ideas that'll use up 3lbs of blueberries?   Hope you're all having a great weekend!!"
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,Tweeeked,4,Sat Jul 11 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"JAM! I love blueberry jam! Alternatively, you can freeze them and then use them in smoothies or make them into a syrup for pancakes as needed."
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,Jaime_Manger,2,Sat Jul 11 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Some are already in the freezer!!! I might have to add more, though. Need to start googling how to make jam or syrup or some sort of blueberry type of sauce."
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Sat Jul 11 19:36:03 2015 UTC,Sauce is pretty simple: just put some in a pot with some sugar and boil it down a bit. Delicious.
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,duhrandomkid,3,Sun Jul 12 01:49:55 2015 UTC,I feel like I could eat those 3lbs in one or two sittings. Blueberries are delicious!
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Sat Jul 11 18:08:37 2015 UTC,They are SO good. I think we were eating about as much as we were picking. I'm just worried I'm gonna get blueberry'd out!
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,teuker,3,Sat Jul 11 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"You could make blueberry tarts or muffins. Not sure if that would use up much of the 3 lbs, but they are really delicious!"

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,xfkirsten,3,Sat Jul 11 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Because you, like me at the age of 25, had only used mixes in the past?  This was my first homemade pancake recipe; I've deviated since then to do fancier things, but try this as a starter. It's better this way."

Last week actually.  Over a year with no days missed, 18 or 19 months with only one day missed in May '14.  Feels weird frankly.  My legs feel so fresh and happy though, and I am itching to run again.  Tomorrow I'm going to go on a silly long run and I am looking forward to it so much.  While not running, I've been biking with some work friends.  That has been super fun too!  Feels a bit like cheating though.  Crazy how easy cycling feels now.  Also re work friends, a bunch came to race with me on the 4th of July, which was awesome, and I've been running with one of them at work a couple days a week too.  My overall running performance may be going down the tubes but hey, at least the social aspect is finally there.  The 5k on the 4th was dreadful-- I was on target to come close to my time from last year (my standing 5k PR) and then had a massive asthma attack going into the second mile.  Struggled through that mile but at 2.0 actually stopped and walked for sixty seconds.  Just in the middle of a 5k.  That is apparently a thing that I have now done. So yeah.  My time was correspondingly bad, worse even than my December 5ks."

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,JoshBlatchford,5,Sat Jul 11 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"I love racing when I do well, but it can also be a confidence killer.  Leading up to my last marathon, it was really hard to race with the volume of training I was doing, and I got really down about my chances to do well in my goal marathon.

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Sun Jul 12 01:54:08 2015 UTC,Yup I hate not racing regularly it makes pacing so difficult. It also makes it hard to do interval training at the correct paces if you do not truly know your current fitness level.

Just 3 miles at a time, no more often than every other day until I can see how my leg holds up. Leg is doing fairly well, and I'm slowly getting my cardio back. (Went from 34 minutes and wanting to die to 28 minutes and feeling okay in a week, so there's that.) It was pretty achy yesterday, but seems good this morning.   Down in San Diego for Comic Con festivities (no badge, just outside events)... gonna try to get a run in along the waterfront tomorrow morning, though!

My goal was to get in the top 10, I was 11th by two seconds (passed by my run club's president in the final stretch).  The humidity was a killer, and the course is pretty hilly, so I don't feel bad about 34:01 today.  The course also measured as 6.32 miles on my GPS, which normally measures 5-10ks short or right on the money.  It's a certified course, but I would put money down that it was long.  Really, it's just about where I would expect to be this far into my training, so I'm not going to get discouraged about my marathon goals just yet.  Twenty miles tomorrow with a high of 92.

AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,teuker,6,Sat Jul 11 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"Man, things are clicking now. I had a 30 minute tempo run scheduled on Thursday so I went to do it on the indoor track (it's rather warm here). 7 laps to the mile. I was thinking 55/56 second laps would put me at 6:30 pace, which is my tempo range. Well, I slipped into doing 53 second laps, like clockwork. Mile 1 6:10, mile 2 6:11, mile 3, 6:10, mile 4 6:11. At this point, I just decided to do 5 miles at tempo, 5th mile came in at 6:09. Wasn't feeling all that tired toward the end, so I made it a 10k. And I dropped it a gear. Last 1.2 miles in 6:54. End time, a 37:44 for a PR. A soft one, since I had tons in the tank, but it was pretty rewarding. I'll hit 72 miles this week (one rest day).   I'm also heading up to Minnesota next week for a 5 mile race with a bunch of my old college teammates/future teammates for Hood to Coast. Found a cheap flight and saw that Spoon will be playing the Eaux Claires festival on Friday--everything lined up. Maybe I'll add a third PR next week. That'd be a damn good month."

My long run today was super smooth, i think my last two miles of the eleven mile run were about 6:45 pace, but I'm not too sure. And I did strides in flats on Thursday, which felt amaaaaaaaaazing"

My teammates haven't run all summer but are in pretty good shape, so that's promising. We had two interval workouts this week. 5x400 with 200 walk rest and then a workout where we broke up into relay teams and did 6x200, rest was the time it took for two teammates to run a 200. Got tricked into going all out on the first two 200s so the rest of the workout was not fun. I don't think we should be doing intervals so early in the season, but there isn't anything I can do.   On my long run tomorrow if my legs feel as if they've recovered enough from doing leg day for the first time in the weight room, I'm going to go for the half marathon distance. Not race it or anything, just run the distance to say I have. Should be fun."
AdvancedRunning,3cxb2c,chickenwithcheez,4,Sat Jul 11 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think doing speed intervals for one week  is a big deal, but if you keep doing that all summer that might be a bit weird. Is your coach experienced?"

After tomorrow's workout I'll be somewhere around 9 hours 15 minutes of volume for the week - still not discounting the marathon this fall, and may even still have a shot at my time goal if I can keep that level of work every week until I'm back to running full-time."

AdvancedRunning,3cx1yd,FinallyNotGawking,6,Sat Jul 11 15:09:50 2015 UTC,This is pretty interesting. Would you be able to do the reverse?

AdvancedRunning,3cx1yd,JoshBlatchford,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:14:09 2015 UTC,Yup I believe part of this is simply your body upping the red blood cell count after the first run or two - your body suddenly has a demand to produce more.

I'm 125 days into my recovery after taking 93 days off due to injury (with very limited cross training -- I was on crutches for part of my recovery and the doc said to avoid biking as I was walking too much in my day-to-day life). I would say I only started feeling like I was back to my old running self about a month ago...so basically when I had been back running again as long as I wasn't running. Mind you, I wasn't back at peak fitness then, but just back at my average fitness before starting a training program."
AdvancedRunning,3cx1yd,energyturtle_ak,2,Mon Jul 13 15:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think some of this also depends on how long you've been running. If you've been running for just a year, days off tend to put you back in terms of aerobic fitness more so than if you've been running for many years. I think this is why you see cases like Kennedy (and even Ritz), i.e. high mileage for years and then a number of great performances after dropping down to slightly lower mileage (but still having that monster aerobic base)."

AdvancedRunning,3cx1yd,JewishIGuess,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, the chart says ""72 days or more.""  I guess that's how long it takes you to return to your baseline fitness, as dictated by your genetic ability, training history, and daily activities, according to Daniels."

The middle distance guys had different training than the long guys during XC, but I trained with the long guys.  My only modifications to the training were on easy/recovery days I would cut the run time in and half and spend the other half spinning on a stationary bike.  As for the uniforms they were definitely a step up from what we had to wear when I first started.  I like the uniforms they have now.

AdvancedRunning,3ctd35,chickenwithcheez,3,Fri Jul 10 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Their workouts were very much slimmed down.  For instance we had common workout where we did 3x (2 miles hard 1 mile moderate), whereas the MD guys did the first (2 miles hard, 1 mile moderate) but then just 2 x (1 mile hard, 1 mile moderate).  It always seemed like they started each workout without, but then would be doing shorter reps towards the end.  Their total weekly mileage was obviously less as well."
AdvancedRunning,3ctd35,ForwardBound,2,Fri Jul 10 20:10:28 2015 UTC,Interesting. What kind of mileage did you put up during XC as opposed to during track?
AdvancedRunning,3ctd35,Mickothy,3,Fri Jul 10 20:39:54 2015 UTC,I would have to go back and look at my logs but I would have to say around 60-70 in cross and 50-60 in track.

AdvancedRunning,3ctd35,Franklins_ghost,4,Fri Jul 10 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the course was hard packed dirt for the most part.  The soccer field was short dead grass since it was the fall.  Like I mentioned in the report the course had a lot of steep hills.  Not really tall/long hills, but lots of short steep ones that would kill your momentum but then you could sprint down the other side.  Definitely a slow course since the top 10-15 are usually under 24 minutes.  The winner was 24:27 this year."

AdvancedRunning,3cukc9,chrispyb,3,Sat Jul 11 03:05:38 2015 UTC,Here's my biggest question: for those like us here on AR (with the exception of the sub elites and elites here) would we benefit more from more focused and refined training diet and recovery than from PEDs?   My answer is: the benefit I personally would have would be far greater than the 3% from a drug.
AdvancedRunning,3cukc9,rennuR_liarT,9,Fri Jul 10 23:10:05 2015 UTC,My impression is that part of the benefit of PEDs is precisely that they let you train more / harder (by accelerating recovery or extending how long you can comfortably run in a single session). So it may be hard to separate the two effects...
AdvancedRunning,3cukc9,pand4duck,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:03:58 2015 UTC,"So for most people who have day jobs and are time limited for training, they probably won't see the gains that a full time athlete, or people getting paid to be in a study full time, might see?"

AdvancedRunning,3cukc9,rennuR_liarT,3,Sat Jul 11 00:54:55 2015 UTC,It's funny that you mention that because another reason why I've been thinking about PEDs a lot lately is because I am currently on prednisone this week for the same reason and feel like superman right now (and wonder what serious drugs would do if the prednisone has had such a noticeable impact). 5 minute miles went from difficult tempo pace to comfortable running since I've started haha.

I figure if I'm more than .2 into the lap that the number is good.  During races, I set the pace buddy thing to my target pace (with a 3-second buffer for GPS/tangent/course errors) and watch that. That way I always know overall where I'm at (1:00 ahead, 2:31 behind, whatever) right then and there. No real math needed, especially late in a marathon when I can't always remember which mile I'm on let alone calculate how many extra seconds I have/need to reach my goal in the next four miles (or is it five miles?)."
AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,mjern,5,Fri Jul 10 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"To take some of the variation out of the pace, you should look at pace/lap, which converges on your time/mile as the mile goes on."

If you have a specific goal time, you should know your pace per mile. Every time you cross a mile marker on the course, manually lap your watch. Your GPS watch is never going to be spot on, and the slight variations can be frustrating and add up over time. The actual mile splits on the course matter far more than the mile splits your watch is giving you. Pace per lap is a good guide to get you pretty close to your goal pace. If you watch and pro race, you will see all high end runners manually lapping at the mile or km markers.  Here is a good article outlining basically the same strategy I mentioned.   These seem a little corny, but they can also be helpful to see where you stand overall if shooting for a BQ. Races in which I used them, I also added overall time to my watch."
AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,BlueTilt,3,Fri Jul 10 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"The one item I don't see mentioned here which has me second guessing myself now even though I find it invaluable is cadence.  When I see lap time I sometimes panic and will myself forward faster, but when I see my cadence below the norm I usually concentrate on better form which really rewards me in the long run.  Concentrating on good form and turnover increases my pace in a more sustainable way.  I also keep pace and total distance on my watch face but it's cadence I tend to look at the most."

AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,unthused,2,Wed Jul 15 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"I don't have my watch handy, but I believe I have the exact same race setup you mentioned. Elapsed time, Distance, Average Pace, and a lap time notice every mile. I may have a field for Last Lap also. It served me well for my first BQ race this past November.   Though I stuck with the 3:05 pace group until mile 22-ish then pulled ahead, so I probably would have been fine regardless, it was just nice have the info and reassurance."
AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,SanDiegoMitch,2,Fri Jul 10 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"I basically only use Distance, lap/pace, and ave/pace, in 1 mile increments.  Current pace really does not matter, as you will get into a groove.  For the start of the race, the lap/pace will work just fine, since it is starting at a new lap.  If you go out too fast or slow, you can see it with that one."
AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,mtortilla62,2,Fri Jul 10 16:18:33 2015 UTC,I auto lap every mile and target 5s per mile faster than goal pace for margin. I also write the splits on my arm that correspond to the markers on course to make sure I am really on pace.

AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,a-german-muffin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried it in a full yet, but if your watch has a virtual training partner, you effectively have a pace buddy on your wrist. I've set my virtual partner to a (conservative) goal pace, which ends up being a pretty good way to mark yourself along the course (if not perfect—as others mentioned, tangents and GPS errors can play with pace somewhat)."
AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,bqb445,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:36:58 2015 UTC,"I've tried using the virtual partner a couple times and I find it much harder to read at a glance than just displaying average pace.

AdvancedRunning,3ct06e,yourfavorite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"I setup my garmin with: total distance, elapsed time, average pace, auto-lap every mile. This is the setup I use during training and races. When pacing and running marathons, I also wear a pace band. My garmin almost always reads long, but by how much depends on the course. In any case, I typically need to run a couple seconds faster than the average pace shown on my Garmin. I use the pace band to verify as I go by each course marker.  Some folks like to turn off auto-lap and manually punch their Garmin as they pass each course marker, but I prefer to just let it auto-lap... it's typically close enough, and it reminds me to look for the course mile markers which I might otherwise miss. (I've never had my Garmin read short, so it always bleeps either at or before the course markers.)  Here's a good pace band generator you can use - http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Marathon_Pace_Band  I've been known to run with a Timex stop watch on the wrist opposite my Garmin and use that to manually record splits."
AdvancedRunning,3ctpp2,Mister_Clutch,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"A) I'd go see someone before thinking about getting back, if that's at all a possibility. If the tenderness feels like a potential a stress fracture (you can google symptoms and tests), you're only digging deeper by trying to come back instead of getting booted and recovering.  B) Are you cross-training at all?  C) Once you get back to running, my advice would be to first get your feet back under you with some easy base mileage before getting into some light workouts. You won't be where you were pre--injury, and while its easier to rebuild fitness than gain it in the first place, you'll still need some time to recover from what happened."
AdvancedRunning,3ctpp2,bxctrack09,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"I am going to see someone (today, my Aunt is a physical therapist). The reason I think it is a tendon and not a stress fracture is because it is a delayed pain. I didn't feel anything during my test run on Thursday but about an hour or so after I got home the same pain came back.  I don't cross train much, but will be getting on a bike when I can during my down time. I might think about hopping on a bike instead of the recovery runs that are in the plan."
AdvancedRunning,3ctpp2,running_writings,2,Sat Jul 11 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"If it's pain on the top of your foot, and it's tender to the touch (i.e. hurts to push on), there's a ~95% chance it's at least a stress reaction.  There's really only two things on top of your midfoot and forefoot; a bone (the metatarsal) and a tendon.  Unfortunately not too many people injure that tendon.  It's probably a bone stress injury, but it sounds like you caught it early.  The old logic of ""you must take 6-8 weeks totally off"" is outdated.  Check out this article for info on how to approach recovery (if it turns out it really is a bone stress injury).    There is also a handy flowchart that you can use to guide your recovery."

Another problem is that lots of runners also do other things, so you have to factor them into the workload.  Etc.

AdvancedRunning,3cm9k2,Butter-Finger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"There will definitely be a post in the future when it goes public and ready for contribution. My only question would be what sort of training program you've used before. It is easier to work with your strengths while focusing on one or two weaknesses per training cycle rather than trying a whole new system and new workouts.   One very general training system that tends to work is a 5 paced system. So if your main goal was racing a 5k you would focus on two races distance below, and two distances above. So ""speed"" would be 1mi and 3k race paces, while more endurance would be 10k and HM race paces. This is a very basic system where race pace work takes precedent with support from speed and endurance."
AdvancedRunning,3cm9k2,generic_name,2,Thu Jul 9 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"Right, I understand you don't want contributions from just anyone; just offering to help.  I'm not 100% aware of my coaches' influences and I've only read a few books on training, so it would definitely be best if I did some more studying first.  I've been reading Renato Canova's training, and that sounds similar to his concept of modulation--running workouts below and above race pace during his Special Period--before focusing on race pace during the final Specific Period.  I was planning on going a similar route, so maybe starting with that 5 paced system might be a good idea."

AdvancedRunning,3cm9k2,bxctrack09,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"We were at the whims of our school's strength and conditioning coaches, who didn't know much about running, which translated to a lot of supersetted isolated muscle lifts at high reps low weight, which goes completely against what I think would work better for more strength, full body, low-rep, high-weight, high rest.  We lifted twice a week and that was all that was required.  My first coach also had us do some plyos twice a week and biking twice a week.  I don't have any specific workouts unfortunately though."
AdvancedRunning,3cm9k2,Distance_Runner,2,Fri Jul 10 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"I'm new here, but I can offer up what I've done. In college (on a NIRCA club, so not exactly high level stuff) the first three years we did mostly just light bodyweight upper body and core work, with little attention paid to lower body strength. Senior year, when I had a good friend of mine who's working on his PhD in exercise phys draw up my strength plan, I started using weight and resistance bands 3x a week. Nothing super crazy, but enough to build some much-needed strength and allow me to run a bit more (moving up to ~70 mpw).  After graduating, I kept doing that work under him. We changed it to 2x a week and dropped some exercises after finding 3x a week was hurting my running. Well, it was more like it gave me more chances to go overboard and get too aggressive with my lifting, but same difference.  I switched coaches recently, and still lift, 2x a week. Kept the hip mobility stuff, do some plyos (high knee hangs, split leg lunge jumps, and standing long jumps), and now do just planks for core. Lifting is 3x5 of incline bench, deadlift and squat."

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"I live in Clintonville but I'm only a few minutes away from the SN. There isn't too much to do in Clintonville so I consider Gallery Hop the ""fun"" thing do to close to me."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,chickenwithcheez,2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:44 2015 UTC,"Nice, I really like the Clintonville area.  Good location to just about everywhere in town.   I used to live in a neighborhood off 161 and did most of my runs over at Antrim and the bike path."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:06:50 2015 UTC,I'm up at Antrim a few times a week now. I love running around the lake and the mulch path that's out there! It fulfills my soft surface cravings haha.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,chickenwithcheez,7,Thu Jul 9 20:04:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for interviewing me this week, and I love the links you added :D  Last week's training was great - had some solid runs and ended up with 35 miles for the week. Happy with how my 4 mile race on the 4th went - treated it as a marathon pace run and felt good throughout, which was surprising given the week's tough training efforts and the volume being heavier than where I typically sit around, since I'm getting used to a 30-35mpw base before starting Pfitz 12/55. Thinking I need to get more sleep, though... and more restful sleep, at that. So many post-work naps lately. Whomp whomppp.   I've really been enjoying sitting outside everywhere - bars, restaurants, ice cream places, coffee shops. Most places have outdoor seating, which is pretty neat. I like the warm feeling that the sun has!  I usually eat nuts and seeds for breakfast - lately, it's been a mix of almonds, cashews, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds. There were pistachios added to the mix for a while, but I ran out and haven't gotten a new bag yet.  Increasing mileage (increasing the peak from 37mpw last cycle to 55mpw this cycle) has me apprehensive, but I'm going for it. I'm worried about the extra time it'll take since I'm a slower runner, especially since the semester will start when mileage really starts building. And I'm worried about my body rebelling and ending up with an injury or something. Workouts. I can already feel that adding intervals and tempo runs back into my weeks and doing them regularly is helping me get faster, despite the heat. SO EXCITED FOR FALL AND COOLER WEATHER. Except it won't be arriving for another few months, so I really need to stop thinking about it. Anyone else overexcited for fall?"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,FlyingFartlek,3,Wed Jul 8 15:11:21 2015 UTC,5 - yes oh god yes oh my god please make the 90 degree sun go away
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,chickenwithcheez,3,Wed Jul 8 15:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, give me fall. Texas summer is brutal for training."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Wed Jul 8 16:22:27 2015 UTC,Come on guys! A few months ago we were dying for summer!
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,chickenwithcheez,3,Wed Jul 8 17:39:48 2015 UTC,I wasn't! I was quite happy over the winter
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,RunnerEh,2,Wed Jul 8 17:44:06 2015 UTC,I hate winter. I think I have developed a fear of being cold.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, fall is awesome but I don't want to wish away the summer!  It's those runs in 90+ degree heat that we need to think about suffering in the freezing temperatures not too long ago."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,BilldozerVT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:44:50 2015 UTC,Yeah. I love summer because I'm up early anyway so I get to run in the beautiful sunshine of 70 degree weather and it's perfect. Humidity is the only thing that bothers me.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,ForwardBound,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Humidity makes me cry. Oh wait, nope, that's just sweat pouring from my eyeballs."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,jaylapeche,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:09:58 2015 UTC,I hate when it feels like I dunked my hands in a warm pool of sticky water.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,BilldozerVT,2,Wed Jul 8 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome to see someone with times closer to my own interviewed! Love it. Although I've yet to do an ultra... Not sure I feel the pull in that direction yet either...   I'm with you on getting more restful rest/sleep. Lately I've been falling asleep for 40 mins or so just before making dinner (because I'll sit down and try to read...) but then I'm ""rested"" and will find myself still awake at 1 am. Then it all happens the next day too. Post work naps are a nasty cycle.   re: #5 - yes! Oh my god yes. But I'm trying to remember a) not to wish the time away, and b) that I need to do my time in the heat to fully reap the benefits of the cooler fall weather."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"Woohoo, yay for having similar times! Just wait, you'll feel the pull eventually :)   It really is a bad cycle, but breaking it is going to be rough!   Agreed! That's the only thing keeping me going... knowing that it'll be worth it when it gets cool!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,6,Wed Jul 8 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"That 50k you described sounds awesome.  I think if I was ever to attempt anything really long like that, I would want it to be more of an adventure with friends like you described instead of a battle with myself.  Any part of you planning to go longer at some point?  Last week for me was an unexpectedly crazy one.  It was a down week for me while building mileage.  I just wanted to break out and run fast and got a wild idea to do my own half marathon for fun...yeah...so anyways I did it and debuted in the HM with a time of 1:20:42!  Very happy with that.  Now it's time to get back to miles, 55 this week, 60 next. Slowly getting there.   I love going to the lake.  There is a lake near me that has a large fully maintained sandy beach, splash zone with water jets for kids, concessions, large playground, and gazebo/grilling area.  Best part is it's only 3 miles from my house so my wife and I bike over every weekend.  I've found some trails during my runs that takes us directly to a BBQ joint on the way home.  Perfect days, doing my long run in the morning, then later biking over to the beach to hang out, then stopping for some beer and BBQ on the way home. I am not a big breakfast person, I have to split it up into smaller meals.  My go-to is a yogurt + bannana and then about an hour later a PB&J.  It just kinda works for me. Just adding more mileage.  I was a bit injury prone in college so my mileage never got crazy high.  Especially during track, I always mixed in a lot of cross training to replace some of the easy runs.  I am always cautious and monitoring my body as I slowly build up. I guess increasing the mileage has so far been paying off great.  That half marathon I mentioned felt very easy and relaxed until the last 3 or so miles.  Back in March I did 8 miles at 6:30 pace and felt like I was red-lining the whole way.  Last weekend I went through 10 miles at 6:10 pace feeling great! /u/ForwardBound, according to strava my HM time was actually one second faster than I thought. I am sorry."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,thebulljames,3,Wed Jul 8 15:14:15 2015 UTC,That's fine. It's hard to find the motivation to improve if you're always on top. Now I have something to fight for.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,3,Wed Jul 8 15:26:07 2015 UTC,Re: #4:  That's awesome.  How much of a mileage bump did it take to see that improvement?
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,RunnerEh,4,Wed Jul 8 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"I have gone from about 30 miles a week now up to 50+.  The plan is to get to 60 and then start adding more workouts in and stay 5k focused but, the HM is a fun distance."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Jaime_Manger,3,Wed Jul 8 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was definitely a blast! Trail 50k's are actually not that bad to do solo because you spend a ton of time thinking about where to put your feet so you don't go flying... not to mention they tend to have THE BEST aid stations, so that's motivation enough to keep going. I'd love to go longer - 50M or 12 hour is definitely on my mind, but I'm intimidated by such a big jump up from 50K! I just found a trail 40M in February, so I'm thinking that will be perfect timing to train for the fall marathon, recover, and build back up!  1 - seems like a lot of us here live near lakes... that sounds like an absolutely amazing way to spend your weekends!  4 - solid!!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,8,Wed Jul 8 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"Nice! It's nice to have folks who found running later in life. Sometimes it seems like everyone else has been running since they were toddlers!     I live in NYC, and I love riding my bike around the city, just killing time exploring new places. Also, I love chillin on a blanket in Prospect Park listening to free concerts and drinking bourbon. I have a smoothie every morning. Pretty much the same thing every day. It's a lot, so brace yourself: Kefir, chia, flax seed, protein powder, banana, kale, beets, beet greens, frozen mangoes, frozen strawberries. Never gets old. Not really. I feel like I don't have a solid enough base (only been running a couple years) to start thinking about different training approaches. For now, it's all about getting in the miles and working my way up to 50-ish mpw for a year or so. Then I'll feel like I've earned the right to play around a little. Last fall I decided to pile on the miles like crazy. Went from 25mpw to 70mpw in two months. Boom, stress fracture. Stupid. I'm thinking of taking a long weekend later this month and heading to upstate NY for a few days of running on the AT. I'd like to camp. The logistics are a little tricky. I guess I'll rent a car, camp one night, do an out and back on the trail, drive to a different campsite, repeat. Anyone done something similar?"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,i_spit_hot_fire,2,Wed Jul 8 15:16:16 2015 UTC,5 - I've run at campsites in the past a bit. It's generally a good idea to plan out a route or get familiar with the area you're going to run at just in case you get lost. You can find some great running routes with a quick scan of google maps.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Wed Jul 8 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"In regards to this, I've found the strava activity search to be so clutch when finding routes in places I am unfamiliar with."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,i_spit_hot_fire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Strava is great for travel. Whenever I'm in a new place, I use the heat map to see the most popular running routes in the area."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Wed Jul 8 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"re: #5 - Yup! It's a lot of fun. I've never done it moving campsites every night though. Mostly just choose a camping ground in Algonquin park and spent the long weekend by the lake and then running, then repeating. I like doing it this way because then I get to choose a new trail every run coming back to the same place each night, I get to know the camp ground and it's trails really well - your logistics are really tricky... You'd almost want to go with someone so you could plot out campgrounds before hand, and run to and from camp grounds with the other person driving the car - otherwise yeah, it's a lot of back and forth..."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,pand4duck,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:03:01 2015 UTC,I find it really hard to ride in the city - but mainly cause I'm impatient and like to bike fast and too many people get in my way (especially now) - actually I feel that way when running too...
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely glad to have picked it up, even if it was later than the majority!  1 - it must be great living in the city in the summer (or any time, really). So much access to interesting things outdoors just by wandering around!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,7,Wed Jul 8 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Good progress dino! Just keep running, you will get those goals eventually.  Training is getting better. Feeling okay about my running. Really loving the trails more than ever now that it's so hot outside all the time. 1 week until I am running in Ireland!   My favorite thing to do in summer is sit inside and complain about how hot it is. Otherwise, I like swimming in lakes on mountains. Go to breakfast: French Toast, 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, and Orange juice. I only eat that after long runs usually, but I love it all. I'm switching to shorter and faster track workouts, but it has taken me a while because I have no one to do them with and I am still working my milage back up from my injury. just adding more miles was the greatest benefit."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,FlyingFartlek,2,Wed Jul 8 16:27:54 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's the plan :)   Trails in the summer are awesome! Except for the spider webs that tend to form between trees and inevitably get on your face if nobody else has gone through that spot on the trail yet...   Take photos running in Ireland!!!!
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Mr_New_Booty,2,Wed Jul 8 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"There will be so many photos. No worries on that.  And this may seem weird, but spider webs don't bother me. I usually take the lead on trail runs with friends because I don't freak out when I hit one surprisingly, haha."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Mickothy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"Saweeeet. Can't wait!  For real?! Ugh, they gross me out, mostly because they just stick to my sweaty face and I'm afraid I'm gonna eat the spider or something. Good for you for taking the hits for the team when you guys go out! Haha"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,whatshisface9,6,Wed Jul 8 22:27:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome interview! Isn't it great how we remember the cheat codes and buttons? Ha   I definitely think you have those goals in your sights. Which is the highest priority for you?  1) honestly. Right now. Run. There's not much else to do. Although the canoe trip I went on last week with my lady friend was unbelievable.   2) so it used to be a big bowl of yogurt with 2 types of berries and chia seeds. But now I've been making smoothies with mango, berries, spinach, kale, OJ and yogurt and I'm totally digging it.   3) I've been thinking about upping mileage for a while. I've definitely been working towards it. Had multiple weeks of >50mi for the first time ever. I'm hesitant to keep going up but I'm not sure why. I guess I'm just trying to do it slowly.   4) same as 3. Started running with the lady friend and she does 70-80s so that's prolly why I've had more miles recently. But I will admit the increase in miles, even just being in the mid 50s consistently has been fantastic. I feel like such a stronger runner. It's amazing how just 10 more miles per week really makes you feel good. The only other thing I would add would be slowing down. Since starting recovery miles, I've felt so much better and like my paces have been quicker in races   5) how many of you take ""down weeks?"" What is a down week to you? Is it decreased mileage? Or just a week without a workout??"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,pand4duck,5,Wed Jul 8 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"I am a believer in down weeks. My training has usually had similar numbers of workouts, but less overall volume (generally applied across the board to all runs)."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,4,Wed Jul 8 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's absolutely crazy - crucial information for classes and work slips through, but we hang on to those cheats for years. Highest priority is breaking 4:00, for sure.   4 - that's really awesome to hear, because I'm in that same boat of upping mileage from what I'm used to. It's definitely good to hear you say that you feel stronger with increased mileage.  5 - my down weeks are generally decreased mileage, with mileage usually dropped from the long run."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,BilldozerVT,3,Wed Jul 8 15:19:21 2015 UTC,"I usually take a down week once every 3-4 weeks depending on how I'm feeling.  For me, a down week means similar hard workouts to a normal week but decreased volume on all the other days.  I also cut out doubles if I'm feeling particularly run down."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 8 16:34:05 2015 UTC,WRT down weeks: I take them at the end of training cycles. Both decreased mileage and no workouts. In cycle I just chop off 10 miles every few weeks but still do workouts.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Every fourth week is down for me. I started at something low and have progressed it like the rest of my mileage, but obviously more spread out (45, 47, 50, ... up to this week at 57). When I was doing three workouts a week, I would cut it to two. When I start doing workouts again, it will either be none or one light one (prog or something)."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:20:41 2015 UTC,2) Whats your smoothie recipe? It sounds like it could be pretty good.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,callthebluff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:40 2015 UTC,So I get all my frozen fruit from Costco. And I use the ninja blender serving cup things. But. I throw in mango and then a few handfuls of the natures three berries (blue/black/rasp) plus a little spinach then OJ chia and yogurt!
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,ForwardBound,4,Thu Jul 9 12:58:30 2015 UTC,"/u/dinosaurdinosrawr we started running at the exact same time and for the same reasons!   I like going to lakes. Well that's a lie. I like being at lakes. I hate going to them. It just seems like a whole ordeal to pack, drive, find parking, walk to the lake. Once I'm there though it's awesome. Now though, I sit at the lake and look into the forest and go ""damn that'd be fun to run through"". Would really like a GPS feature that is 'return to start' so you can just get lost and then pointed back in the right direction. Cereal. Usually something sugary like Sugar Crisp or Frosted Flakes. Not really. I think for the most part I have the basics in my training. The one thing I thought about was switching to a 10-day cycle, but I'm an office, M-F, 8-4 person, so the 7-day cycle works really well. Blasting my mileage up was great for pounding my body into submission and preparing myself for the marathon. But it was also bad because I didn't get much speedwork in. I really need to remember that my body needs to readapt every time I leave altitude for a weekend and then come back. I end up planning a workout two days after I get back at altitude and then end up wondering why it is destroying me."

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,4,Wed Jul 8 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"Cool!! Yeah, I remember seeing you around on some of the other subs I frequent!  1 - the travel part of going anywhere is usually the most annoying. Teleportation as a form of public transit really needs to happen soon. It would make life so easy. That GPS feature would be so awesome!!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Wed Jul 8 15:24:16 2015 UTC,"Teleportation though...there's two options. Clones, in which case we'd have to find a way to merge the mind of the original body into the new one at a new location and then also dispose of the old body. Or, wormholes. I don't think either are coming to us anytime soon :("
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,3,Wed Jul 8 18:27:12 2015 UTC,"also dispose of the old body.   Wouldn't we recycle?  I mean, it would be pretty basic to require you to sign the organ donor line of your teleportation license.  That just seems earth friendly."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:17 2015 UTC,What about in cases where a body is so beautiful that it's a crime to dispose of it at all? I'm going to be preserved like Lenin.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,3,Thu Jul 9 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"What if teleportation just moves mind + body at the same time to the new location? Kinda like apparating in Harry Potter, minus the part where limbs can get left behind.   I still have my hopes. I've thought through the potential repercussions of widespread availability of teleportation and regulations that would need to be put in place to make sure crime didn't spike... long runs give me time to think about the important questions..."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,3,Wed Jul 8 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"Would really like a GPS feature that is 'return to start' so you can just get lost and then pointed back in the right direction.   The Fenix 2 has this, though I've never tried it. I think it technically tries to have you retrace your steps exactly."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,5,Wed Jul 8 19:57:41 2015 UTC,"You sound interesting, dinosaur. Though grad school...yikes. Good luck surviving that :)  Also, that 50k sounds like a fantastic memory--any plans to go back and do another race of that distance or greater?  1) Two things. I first love my group's summer long runs; we meet at a natural spring pool in town, do our long run, and then hit the pool afterward to recover in the 68 degree water. And then we get drunk at brunch (but that happens in the winter too). Second thing would be the clothing optional beach just outside of town. Yep.  2) I'm a cereal guy, most days...though if I have time and supplies, I'll happily whip up some from-scratch waffles.  3)There's nothing that I'm really thinking about adding to my training; I have mileage, I have speed/tempo work, I have low rest. Perhaps I could stand to add more strength/core to my training, but I've been held back by time/energy constraints. I've just been so tired lately that anything exercise-related outside of running has been a lowered priority.  4) Currently in the process of switching to a 10 day training cycle. I'm not sure how it's working yet (this is only the second cycle). I'm running more but man, I've been just feeling exhausted and not entirely recovered. I'm suspecting, though, it's a feature and not a bug.  5) Now that I'm getting into the real bulk of my marathon training, I'm starting to wonder about how I'll train specifically for the hill portion of my race; the first 16 miles are at a steady downhill gradient of 5%--how would you train for this?"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,3,Wed Jul 8 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, it's rough, but it's been interesting... definitely learning a lot... thanks for the survival wishes :D   Yep, it was so fantastic that I decided to celebrate my second semester of grad school with another 50k :P I've been toying around with the idea of a 50M or a 12 hour race but have had trouble finding one where the timing works (not to mention that 50K to 50M seems like a massive jump!), but there's a 40M trail race around here in February that is very appealing!!  1 - Run-Pool-Brunch-Drunkbrunch sounds like a fantastic summer tradition!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,teuker,3,Wed Jul 8 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"40 miles sounds like a good compromise. Madness, but a compromise."

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,duhrandomkid,3,Wed Jul 8 16:48:16 2015 UTC,"That's crazy to me. Not to take anything away from fast finishers -- it's really impressive to withstand the pounding of 5% downhill for 16 miles. That said, it seems weird that the BAA would accept times from a race that is over 5,000ft net downhill."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,lofflecake,3,Wed Jul 8 16:51:12 2015 UTC,I think that all the BAA cares about is that the course is a legit 26.2 miles. This course is not eligible for any US Olympic qualifiers or things like that (properly so)
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,callthebluff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:52:50 2015 UTC,"This is true. BAA doesn't care about net downhill just the official distance. In fact, the Boston course itself is net downhill and not eligible for any records and such"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 8 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"5 - At least a few runs incorporating some downhills at the beginning to simulate a bit of fatigue, with marathon paced work afterwards so you don't freak out during your race with a new stimulus."

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,4,Wed Jul 8 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"This past week has been really fantastic training-wise. I think the running gods are going soft on me!  Overall 46 mpw and 2 main workouts. The first one was a 7.5 mile hill run (massive, massive, nightmare hills) and I managed to get a huge workout PR. Last summer at this time I was throwing out 59s or 60s on this course, but now I managed to run a 46:55. The second workout was a 6.45 mile tempo (with one 3 min big hill). Last week I posted about how euphoric I felt after completing it at 5:56 pace, but this week I managed to lower that down to a 5:47 pace. I am still waiting for my first bad workout of the summer.. :S  1) My favorite thing to do in the summer is relax. In the past, I didn't have to worry about school and could forget everything in the summer. Unfortunately, now I have summer classes and AP homework to do. :(  2) If I can get it, I really love a massive stack of pancakes. Usually though (after my long runs on saturday), I sneak over to the supermarket and pick up 2 sesame bagels + chocolate milk.  3) I've been thinking a lot about speed, and how many workouts I should have a week and how fast etc. Last summer, I would go really hard on 4/6 runs I ran a week, and I'm not sure if that positively affected the big drops I got in the fall or if they burned me out and I could've down better... I need to do some experimenting.   4) I've only been running for a couple seasons, and the school XC schedule is pretty rigid so I haven't been able to change much. However, I did add doubles a while back, but I'm not sure if they are helping me run faster...  5) How much sleep do you guys get? I normally get 7-8 hours (I can't get anymore because my sister goes to bed at 9pm and I have to wake up at 5am), but I have been SO TIRED recently. I think this might be attributed to my 6 hour summer class (.. graphic design ..) that follows practice and then my late afternoon double (which I run easy). Hopefully I will adapt soon, or I may have to tone down my doubling (currently I have built up to 3 a week)."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,kkruns,2,Wed Jul 8 15:20:32 2015 UTC,5 - i get 10 hours of sleep a night and constantly am tired... i am trying to get a blood panel scheduled to see if i'm anemic (or missing some other nutrients) because that's absolutely ridiculous.

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,kkruns,6,Wed Jul 8 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"1 - drinking on a patio and attending music festivals in ironic tanktops. and sweating a lot.  2 - i've recently gotten into scrambled eggs in a microwave with cheese and pepperoni, but i generally don't eat breakfast. my favorite meal is a burrito, and anyone who says they don't love burritos is wrong.  3/4 - i've recently switched to running by time instead of distance. this has been more of an offshoot from switching my easy runs to MAF and all of a sudden spending 10-20% more time on my feet per run. no idea if this is actually beneficial. my goal of staying healthy and consistently running has not been met so far. i'm going to (yet another) PT tomorrow who is focused on dynamic movement and all that stuff. we'll see.  5 - the scariest part about injuries is that the first month back you have absolutely no confidence in the bodypart, and that is not a good way to run"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,FlyingFartlek,5,Wed Jul 8 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"3/4 - I'm a big fan of running for time. It's good to bring the GPS along to track distance but effort should dictate pace on easy/recovery runs, not the other way around."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,catalano98,5,Wed Jul 8 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"As a late life running bloomer I definitely sympathize with you. I hated running in High school when I felt I was forced to do it. It was mostly seen as a punishment and I never gave it much thought until 2 years ago. Running on your own terms makes it so much more enjoyable.   Finally got a decent week in. I think 40mpw last week. I have the Boilermaker 15k this Sunday, which I am pretty excited about. It's been a long standing bet with a friend that I will break 1:05:59, and this year I seem to finally have a chance. After that I plan on taking an easy week before starting up a pfitz plan.   I'm getting too old for this, but it's lazy river tubing with friends. Nothing more fun than sitting in an inner tube going down a lazy river (with some rapids!) while enjoying a can of beer (and food if you can manage to keep it dry!).  A smoothie that I mix up before heading out the door in the AM. I buy different frozen fruits from trader joes, and just usually blend up a quick mix and drink it on the way to work.  I've been thinking of doing this workout, but haven't yet. Nothing to do with being apprehensive, just haven't gotten a chance to actually do it. It is hill repeats of a certain amount of length, say 3 miles, on a 5-6% grade hill near me followed by a jog to a track that is also close by. Once on the track I would do a 4-5 mile tempo run. Read it in running times, sounded intriguing so I may just incorporate it into the pfitz plan. Anyone see any negatives to this type of run? Adding speedwork! I've come to love it. My track club holds workouts every tuesday night, and usually the stuff performed is interval/repeat pace runs. Didn't think I would like it as much as I have."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,elzorrodorito,3,Wed Jul 8 16:53:40 2015 UTC,1 - I love doing that. Unfortunately the cops in Canada are cracking down on drinking while tubing. The drunks and litterers spoil it for everyone :(
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Wed Jul 8 18:54:42 2015 UTC,"I've never done the lazy river thing, but it seems so fun. I'll definitely have to give it a try, even if I'm it means I'm too old for it."

Glad you're enjoying it now, too!  1 - that sounds so fun!  4 - I'm with you on coming to love speedwork!! Sometimes I still hate it while it's happening, but the second the workout is done, I'm giddy."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,elzorrodorito,5,Wed Jul 8 19:31:27 2015 UTC,"Nice interview!   My favorite thing to do in the summer, other than running, is playing basketball with my friends, which can lead to sore legs the next day.  My go-to breakfast would have to be a toasted bagel with peanut butter; however, on the occasion that I do not have bagels, I have toast with peanut butter. I am apprehensive about making a switch to getting 60+ MPW without running any doubles. I am nervous because I need to set myself up for a great cross country season while remaining healthy. It is probably necessary though. I made my coach switch our training program during this past spring (junior year) because I did not get any PBs during my sophomore year and junior winter season. It worked and I improved a decent amount. I just I was not sick when I set my 1600m PB, I probably could have ran 6 seconds faster.  I had to start a new sleep schedule this week and for the rest of summer because of driver's education. I have lecture at 7:15 AM and on the alternating day I have driving at 6:30 AM. I have to try to get 8-9 hours of shut-eye still."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,ForwardBound,3,Wed Jul 8 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  2 - PB on warm things is great... like /u/kkruns said, when it gets melty, it's so awesome!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 8 19:32:29 2015 UTC,"Mmm, I LOVE toast/toasted bagels with PB. It's so good when the PB gets all melty."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 8 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"3 - If running doubles at 60 mpw seems to be working for you, why change to doing it all in singles?  As long as you're doing long runs and at least one longer effort during the week (at least 7-8 miles), you should be fine.  The only reason I would personally see for stopping doubles is if you were splitting easy days into two short runs of 4 miles or less."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,The_Noodle_Incident,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Well it is actually a change from last year. I did not have that stellar of a season last year, but I definitely see your point, thanks."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,rnr_,4,Wed Jul 8 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't start running until I was your age, and I didn't really start training seriously until almost last year.  I would really like to do ultras and crazy trail marathons, but I have been so close to my marathon goal recently that I really don't feel like I can switch focuses right now.  The Marine Corps marathon is probably my favorite marathon course, I love that it goes all around DC and you get to see all the sights.  There's some hills in the beginning, but the rest of the course is pretty flat.  The bridge is super boring and running on the freeway north from Crystal City is also super boring, but those are really the only low points for me.  Spectator support is awesome in populated areas, and even though the hill leading to the finish is tough it was a lot of fun.  I would love to run it again.  I'm a student right now as well.  I love video games too, but having two kids means my TV is just a Nick Jr machine.  My wife also watches tons of ridiculous reality TV shows that make me want to throw myself off our balcony, and I never really get a chance to play.  I have had Mario Kart 8 for over a year and it's still in the plastic.  Most of the gaming I do is with my PC and my PS4 (which is hooked up to me PC monitor).   My favorite summer thing to do is go to water parks.  I usually only go once or twice but it's a blast.  It's tough with small kids though, because they can't really do most of the fun stuff.  Other than that, just running. I eat granola and yogurt mostly.  I love breakfast foods like eggs and bacon and pancakes but I usually eat those at dinner time. I lost tons of weight last summer when I was cross training for most of my activity (over 10 lbs), and I have considered replacing recovery doubles with swims.  When I did it last summer I was way lower in mileage (like 50 mpw compared to 100 for this training plan), had never run doubles before, and I quit cross training as soon as I started my marathon training plan.  I always wondered how it would affect my training to do it during a training cycle. Last summer when I cut the intensity of my runs so I could increase mileage it made a huge difference, I dropped almost 10 minutes in my marathon time. It's been rainy and cool and it has felt like Spring recently.  I love training in this weather and I hate that it's going to be 90 again for my long run on Sunday (and 85 for my race on Saturday).  I'm excited for Fall."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,whatshisface9,2,Wed Jul 8 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not wanting to switch focus is definitely understandable, especially if you've been making awesome progress since taking training seriously (which it sounds like you have!). I ended up doing my first 50k because it was 6 weeks after my second marathon and I figured I might as well go for it, since I was all trained up for the distance and had no other races in mind for after it. It was more of an afterthought than a primary focus. That's awesome that it's your favorite course!!! I'm so excited for it, and have heard great things from everyone who has mentioned doing it. I'm a bit nervous about the hills since my last marathon (and PR) was totally flat... are they something I should worry about, or are they not too bad?  Oh man, I don't know how you fit in so much mileage with being a student AND having a family!!! On the plus side, I'm sure you're more likely to go out and get your mileage in if your wife has reality shows on!! Hopefully you can squeeze in some Mario Kart time soon. Are your kids going to be old enough to play videogames any time soon?   5 - WOOF that sounds terrible. Fingers crossed that the forecast is wildly wrong."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,whatshisface9,2,Wed Jul 8 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"4: When you say you cut the intensity, are you referring to your easy days? What pace were you running those days before/after you changed the intensity?"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 8 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't have easy days.  I ran all days like they were a tempo, usually 6:05-6:30 pace.  I took a lot of days off because it was too hard to maintain."

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Tue Jul 14 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"Right now, I really enjoy the 4th.  It starts off with my annual half marathon and then I host a BBQ at my house.  Overall, a lot of fun. Nothing really, usually just have some cereal or a bagel and then a piece of fruit when I get into the office. I'm pretty happy with my training right now.  I'm seeing progress that is much more significant than I've seen in the past. Consistency. I picked up a new GPS watch.  Picked up the Fenix2 and have been having some fun playing with the different features."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,callthebluff,3,Thu Jul 9 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"Last week I managed to log my 42 miles even though 4th of July weekend made it a little tricky :D. This week the goal is 45 miles, and  it should be made easier because I am running all 7 days rather than 6 (I have a race on Sunday that our coach wants us to do to check our progress). Today, we did 4x1 mile, and it was awesome! The goal was to hit 6:20s (based off what we think we can do right right now, which is a 19:40 for me), and I ended up running a 6:10, 6:00, 6:10, 6:10! It was a bit rough, but I think it was meant to be, so I have high hopes for my 5k on Sunday.   I love to go to the pool and hang out with friends. I also enjoy the cool morning runs, but summer running is gonna start to suck soon when we have to start running in the afternoon again :(. I usually have a couple bowls of berry colossal crunch (so healthy!) just because it is so convenient, but I love having omelets when I can. I've thought about permanently adding in the 7th day of running, but our coach seems to push having a day off. Additionally, I would then have to convince everyone else to run on Sunday, otherwise I would be running less than them on the other 6 days. I added in lifting, and, while it was rough at first, I feel like I notice the difference it makes. Just makes me feel stronger overall. I can't think of anything I tried to change that went awry, I must not have experimented enough. Should I join in an 8k or 4k in a few weeks? I am a high school senior, and our coach wants us to do 3 races over the summer. I have already done a 5k, and I have a 5k on Sunday."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,FlyingFartlek,2,Wed Jul 8 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"5 - I think either would be beneficial. 8k is quite a bit longer race than 5k, but the 4k could be fun to get moving a bit quicker than the 5k distance like you're used to. Whatever you feel like your strength is, do the opposite!"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,2,Wed Jul 8 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"I think I'll go with the 8k, then. I seem to be significantly better at shorter distances (2:12 800, 5:09 1600, 11:38 3200, 20:04 5k), so it should be a fun experience. I have also never raced farther than 5k. Thanks for the tip!"

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,FlyingFartlek,3,Wed Jul 8 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Sub4 sounds like a really solid goal - always good to get those round number monkeys off your back.  My week - I ran.  Kind of losing focus on training a bit, but focused on hitting 70 and did that.  So yeah.    Street fests in Chicago are pretty awesome.  I rotate between scrambled eggs/steel cut oats/smoothies.  Sometimes on the weekend I will go bigger with waffles or whatnot.  Lifting for me.  I have been focusing on increasing mileage this year, so I want to be more comfortable with that stimulus before I add in weights.  Midweek mid-long runs (the 13-15 milers) were a marathon game changer for me; just so much stronger.  Eating all the food did not work out as well as I hoped...  Next week will be 18 to Nashville, so I have to decide how to train.  Do I want an 18 week plan?  Never really completed one that long.  Should I jump on a Pfitz plan (either the 18/70 now or 12 later) or stick with a self made plan?  If selfie, try to stick with my current 10 day cycle or go back to the week cycle similar to what I did for Boston?"
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,ForwardBound,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"5 - That's a tough call. I did the 18 week plan with Pfitz, but next time I think I'll only do 12. 18 weeks is a really long time to stick to a plan. I found myself just getting tired of being tied to a very specific schedule."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,FlyingFartlek,2,Wed Jul 8 18:58:57 2015 UTC,There is also the incredibly stupid idea: build a little more base and go fro 12/85.  That would be the worst idea I've done in awhile.
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,dinosaurdinosrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, seems like the next logical aim!!   1 - I miss living in a city, they always have so many fun summer options. Never been to Chicago, but it seems pretty awesome!  3 - I added in lifting a few weeks ago. It definitely is tiring my legs, but I think I've gotten used to it and am not (at least, not yet... we'll see what happens when mileage increases a lot more) experiencing any big negative impacts in my running performance. I feel a little slow and tired, but I've also been sleeping horribly and the heat/humidity is doing a number on me, too. If anything, I feel a bit stronger and more confident - knowing that squats are tiring my legs out but still being able to hit most of my repeats and tempo or pace runs has me feeling hopeful that when I increase mileage and decrease the lifting (and probably drop it during the taper completely), I'll feel even stronger on race day...  well, that's the hope, at least.   4 - I'm gonna be introducing midweek mid-long runs (more like 11-12, though, I think) so hearing that they were a game changer makes me pretty happy!!"

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,kkruns,3,Wed Jul 8 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"SSX Tricky!  Game brings back lots of memories.  I would always play as the British guy with dreads named Moby.  53 miles for me last week last week (plus a 6 mile hike).  Started to come down in mileage to begin a taper and sharpening period for a goal 5k this Saturday.  Since last week's thread, I raced the Avery Brewing/Boulder 4k on the Fourth and did 10x200m on/200m off yesterday.  The 4k was a lot of fun, as it was on a 1 mile loop course with great competition.  I finished 18th in 13:40, but I measured the course nearly a tenth of a mile long on my Garmin.  Regardless of the time, I was able to maintain 5:20 pace on the watch (split 4k on it right at 13:20), which is a great confidence booster for trying to run 5:10 pace near sea level for this 5k coming up.    Summer in Colorado = hiking.  I was also going to do an alpine slide last weekend, but it closed due to the stormy weather :(  Most mornings, I have some cereal (something like Kashi or Nature's Path, the more cardboard-esque the better) with almond milk and either a banana or a Clif bar.  Usually sits pretty well for running.  After my race this weekend and another on the 18th, I am planning on ramping up mileage to start training for the Columbus Half.  I'd like to get to the point where I'm doubling at least 4 times per week and hitting 80+ miles weekly, but I'm also apprehensive about digging myself into a hole I can't get out of recovery-wise because of my history of overtraining.  I'll talk with my coach about it and might end up capping myself around 80mpw because he is starting to think I respond better to less volume.  Easy runs super easy!  In college, I wouldn't have even dreamed of doing easy runs near 8:00 pace, but now I it's rare for me to have easy runs averaging under 7:40.  In Ryan Hall's Resurrection series on Flotrack, he made a comment about how it doesn't really matter what goes on between workouts and races as long as you're ready to roll on the fast days.  For me, this means throwing pace out the window on the easy days and just getting the volume in.  I run with my girlfriend a few times a week as well, and those runs are usually in the 8:20-8:40 pace range.  I just accepted an offer to transition from contract work to full time at my company, so now I'll have benefits!  I'm already planning on getting my blood tested just to see where my ferritin and hemoglobin levels are."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,3,Wed Jul 8 15:35:14 2015 UTC,How do you go about getting those levels tested? Are you just going to go to your general practitioner and ask? Or is there a sports med clinic nearby that does this?

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,MrSomebody,3,Wed Jul 8 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"1)During the summer, I love just chilling with my friends. We have an ultimate Frisbee team, and we spend hours playing games and joking around. Best cross training ever. However, sometimes our hangouts get in the way of my mileage goals, but I try to avoid putting running above my friends.   2)Go to breakfast would have to be eggs. Scrambled or in omelette form with cheese and ham. Goes great with some toaster waffles and OJ.  3)I've really been neglecting my strength work, and my upper body is suffering a result. I used to spend a lot of time working my abs and arms, but when I upped my mileage I started to get really lazy on the front. Does anyone have a good routine they use for their upper body and core that only takes 30 minutes or so that I can do at the end of a run?  4) Well, I finally started doing high mileage at about 76 miles last week, so I'm hoping that will be of great benefit, but will have to just wait and see."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,MrSomebody,3,Wed Jul 8 15:57:20 2015 UTC,"My training isn't interesting right now. Just easy miles to maintain my base before fall marathon training starts on July 20. It feels weird to start training so late. I'm joining a friend for 10 miles of her long run this weekend. She is doing 18 because she is running Berlin, which is 11 weeks away? By the time she is done with her race, I'll still be 8 weeks out from mine! Crazy.   Grilling on the roof! We have pretty sweet views of Manhattan and get some great sunsets. Our view will soon be ruined by the 18-story hotel they are building between us and the East River, so we have to enjoy it while it lasts.  Greek yogurt + a hard boiled egg. Protein, FTW. I'm planning to change my training by actually doing all the workouts I schedule. Crazy, right? I've long had a hard workout scheduled for both Tuesday and Thursday, but rarely ended up doing both. This season, I'm going to stick to it. What's been holding me back? Laziness? Fear of injury?  Nothing comes to mind right now.  I've been focusing on reaching my goal racing weight before training begins, and running on a calorie deficit sucks. It feels like running through molasses."

I am the pancake master.  3) I'm base building right now and am planning on incorporating a significant number of doubles later in the summer. I've normally preferred longer singles, but I'm pushing up to 85 MPW in this training cycle and that's not a reasonable amount to do on singles alone.  4) Strides. I never really rated them until I tried them.. They have been super useful in maintaining some leg speed and improving form."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,3,Wed Jul 8 16:08:07 2015 UTC,4 - Damn. I have to get back into doing strides regularly. It's just so hot that after my main run is done I want to immediately go and sit in front of a fan with cold water.

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Jaime_Manger,6,Wed Jul 8 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"I am usually a big fan of mix ins (though I won't say no to a plain pancake!). I've recently gotten really into whole grain pancakes with blueberries. I like to mix in tons of oats, corn meal, various flours (buckwheat and the like), wheat germ, etc. It makes for a really tasty and hearty pancake.   I also like to go over the top with mix ins on occasion. I've had good success with a Mexican hot chocolate pancake:   base pancake recipe (my ratios are per 1.5 c of flour) 1 t vanilla .5 t cinnamon 2 dashes cayenne  .5 t nutmeg handful of semisweet chocolate chips top with whipped cream.    I really like pancakes."

So many fun options and explorations while wandering, especially in the summer time."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Jaime_Manger,3,Wed Jul 8 19:41:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like a record on repeat here...Last week nothing - because as I said last week of course I get sick right as my knees are feeling up to starting up again. But 21km so far this week! I'm slow, and my throat still feels like it's on fire (or like I just sprinted a half marathon) from all the coughing, and the constant 96% humidity has been killer (just thunderstorm already!!), but so happy to be back and actually be able to have a couple KM's under my belt to throw in the discussion here.    My favourite thing to do in the summer is take the dog to the dog park. She's getting on in age so it's no longer about going to play with the other pups but it makes her so happy to romp around the woods sniffing absolutely everything. Taking her to the field is also very akin to the peacefulness I find running, but it feels like a slightly less selfish way to get some me time as it makes her so happy.  I waver between eating breakfast or not (although I looove breakfast foods for lunch and especially dinner). But overall coffee is my biggest mainstay. After that it's normally plain greek yogurt, fruits and oats for my first food of the day. Not apprehensive per se - just worrying that I'll end up applying all I learnt from Daniel's running formula wrong... Trying not to worry about it to much yet since the next two weeks I'm just planning on running easy for as long/as little as my legs feel like. The biggest benefit I've had in my running was last summer when I committed to running 6 times a week through the summer heat. The increased milage (and I think the benefits of training in the heat) helped me to a few Fall PRs. Hoping that this July and August is enough times and filled with enough good training to see those kinda jumps again."
AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,CookingWine,3,Wed Jul 8 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"We joined our local gym a few months ago, and they have a big family pool.  We've been taking our kids there and they're loving it.  It's fun watching them learn to swim. I literally eat Canadian bacon and eggs with coffee every morning, along with either an English muffin or a bagel.   I started following Jack Daniels' half marathon plan about 3 weeks ago.  It was a pretty big jump in mileage for me, going from 14 to 24, but I seem to be holding on.  I'm worried about jumping up again to 30 miles a week after next week.   I started doing a plyometrics program at the same time I started the Jack Daniels plan in an attempt to strengthen my calves, improve my running economy, and reduce injuries.  The last time I tried to follow his plan I had constant posterior shin splints that put me out of commission.  I seem to be doing a lot better this time, so I think they're helping.  I have calf pain in the mornings, but after my morning runs, and especially on my plyo days, the pain is gone after I work out.  It's kind of refreshing to be honest.   Running makes me crave sweets like no other."

I'd love to add some speed work, but I'm just building base right now.  I'm doing strides 2-3 times a week though, so that's keeping my turnover quick. I'm really buckling down and getting some serious miles in this summer.  In previous years I only ever hit 40 mpw or so in the summer, but I'm slowly working my way up to 75, possibly going to hit 80-85 by the end of the summer."

AdvancedRunning,3cjyqk,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 8 19:43:09 2015 UTC,"I find the backstory behind songs fascinating. I like trying to figure out how they must have felt/thought about when they wrote the song.  Last week hit 50 miles! Felt good, and now I have started practicing with my XC team. That's fun, except for the fact that we are doing intervals already. I'm a bit worried about peaking too early and by the time state rolls around being flat. This week is either going to be another 50 or a bit less, might take an off day this week.   1-Swimming is awesome. I've gone to summer camp for 3 years now but now I exceed the age limit, so I don't get to do that anymore. My family always takes a trip over the summer. This year we are going to the Dominican Republic! My mom says we should go to Greece next year. She thinks it'll be great because everything will be ""cheap.""  2-I eat it pre-race or on off days because I love it so much. Instant oatmeal with peanut butter, blueberries or strawberries, always a banana, and milk if it's not pre-race.   3-Been thinking about adding in doubles. Did it before, had success, this summer haven't done it and not sure how it's worked out so far. I am going to add them in but less frequently.   4-For me, more easy miles did it. My first year running cross country we always did 2-3 miles in the morning really fast, as in, one kid set his 3 mile PR in a morning practice, and then either more of that in the afternoon or a track workout. After XC I 86'ed that and started doing long slow runs, and added in a long run, and it worked great for me. I added in hills this summer and I feel a bit more powerful on flat ground. My leg muscles seem to hold up a bit better when I do speed work.   5-The Tour de France is confusing. The heck is a pelaton? Also, it's July and it's 65 degrees outside. I feel violated."

AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,chickenwithcheez,6,Tue Jul 7 14:32:05 2015 UTC,It depends on what you're looking for in training. Increase in training volume while staying healthy generally leads to improvement because you're doing more of that specific activity. On the aerobic level more running leads to more mitochondria development (the powerhouse of the cell!) and on the neuromuscular level more repetitive motions make you better at that activity. I'm a big fan of doubles since they allow you to increase training volume overall and lead to more running in general compared to the volume you can handle in singles. I'd say try it and see if it works for you. You'll never know unless you do it.
AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,CatzerzMcGee,3,Tue Jul 7 14:40:35 2015 UTC,I'll probably give it a go. If I did increase volume it would be very slight. 5 miles a week at most. I just hate being done with a workout and knowing that I have another 3.5+ miles to go that day. I don't think it'd be as bad if I got a break.
AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,TheHiddenYolo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Regardless, you should be doing a cooldown run post workout to drain waste material from the leg. Distance really depends on you. One of my teammates gets away with a 400-800m cooldown and is completely fine the next day, but i prefer longer cooldowns. (His body probably is more efficient at dealing with waste, but whatever. More mileage for me.)"
AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,landrybennett,2,Tue Jul 7 20:13:46 2015 UTC,"I usually like at least an 800 cooldown, but after longer efforts I generally like 1.5-2 miles.

AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,ForwardBound,3,Tue Jul 7 20:21:49 2015 UTC,Long cool downs are going to be better for you than doubling. It will help flush things out.
AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,pand4duck,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"The cooldown seems better to me done right after the workout. I've never had good experiences with just stopping after a tough workout. I tend to think of doubles as best for increasing volume on easy days--4 easy in the AM and 4 easy in the PM, which will leave you fresher for a tempo or track workout or long run the next day than a single 8 miler. For a high schooler presumably with a lot of time on his hands running 40 - 50 mpw, I might say that it's not necessary to double.  However, I'd say this is a great time to experiment with doubles and see how you handle them."
AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,pand4duck,3,Tue Jul 7 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"I would still get a cooldown of like 0.5-1.5 miles, and a good stretch and walk home. Even though I told Caterz in my comment I didn't plan on increasing number volume I decided just now while showering I might bump up to 60 in a few weeks. I had success with doubles during track so I'll probably give it a go. It's only twice a week, anyway."
AdvancedRunning,3cfgn3,potatorunner,2,Tue Jul 7 15:59:56 2015 UTC,Why not try it for a few weeks and report back and let us know how it felt? It also might be something to consider if you want to bump mileage. Just add in a PM run of 4-5 suuuuuuuuper easy.

I try not to display my heart rate during my runs because I find it way too distracting. I'd keep looking at my watch to see where my HR was every minute.  I track all my training as far as what's reported in strava or Garmin connect, but that's it. I don't track sleep or actively keep track of calories."
AdvancedRunning,3cdfqv,qwikben,2,Tue Jul 7 02:27:56 2015 UTC,A large chunk of our users are tracking HRV to enhance endurance performance.

AdvancedRunning,3cdfqv,txjason,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"I creeped through your post history and found that you're with elite HRV - are you guys tracking training data vs HRV data for the athletes who use your program? Your site says that you all use your own product, what is your sport? Do you personally do HR-zone based training?"
AdvancedRunning,3cdfqv,txjason,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:43:23 2015 UTC,"You can definitely track exercise, sleep and other data alongside HRV.  I use it every day. Right now I'm on a bodybuilding routine under coach Menno over at BayesianBodybuilding.com (he's also familiar with HRV).  I'm new to bodybuilding specifically, but I find that the combo of sleep and diet hugely affects my HRV and ability to perform well for my training sessions.  I have training sessions that I want to hit and don't really want to reduce or miss, so HRV helps me know when I need to really prioritize rest so I can hit my planned training sessions.  Also, I'm naturally a binge and slack type exerciser (workout too much for a while then not enough for a while). So HRV helps keep me much more consistent. I can see when I'm going too far with it or when I haven't been pushing it hard enough.  I don't currently do HR-zone training personally. But I have talked to coaches who use our platform and also do HR-zone training with their clients. They use HRV to help tweak the duration of time spent in a certain zone according to the training plan and the person's readiness to perform that day.  I am a big fan of HR-zone training as well. Many people push too hard in their endurance training and miss out on the underlying aerobic benefits of maintaining a certain heart rate for a period of time."

AdvancedRunning,3cawvu,The_Noodle_Incident,7,Mon Jul 6 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"Personally I prefer the 12 week plans with a heathly base.  Ive never had much luck maintaining Pfitz's rather intense workouts for a full 18 weeks.  However, the 12 week plans are a more aggrssive ramp-up, so base is critical.  Since you're in week 4 already, I'm not seeing too much of an advantage in switching, other than it's going to temporarily cut your mileage a bit.  The 12 week plan would start in 2 weeks, right?  I think just keeping on with 18/55 and taking 3 days off or so, then seeing where you're at, might be a good idea?  Maybe skip some of the vo2 stuff (replacing with GA runs) for the next couple weeks (dont have the plan in front of me now).  If you intervene now with a solid amount of rest (3 days off, next 3 days easy is my standard), you have the best chance of it not having a big impact on training."
AdvancedRunning,3cawvu,HDRgument,2,Mon Jul 6 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"This is my first time using a Pfitz plan so this whole thing has me asking ""is it me? or is it the plan"" so it's good to know that an 18 week cycle has proven to be a bit much for some.

AdvancedRunning,3cawvu,rnr_,5,Mon Jul 6 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"I pretty much had this exact issue.  I was doing the 18/70 plan and felt some pain in the shin.  I finally stopped after one run where the pain never went away.  I took a week off and cycled instead.  When I returned to running, I shifted to the 18/55 plan and the shin pain hasn't returned.    You might consider dropping a recovery day from the plan and replace with supplementary cross training (cycling, swimming, water running, etc) just to be safe since you won't really be reducing mileage / intensity using the 12/55 plan."
AdvancedRunning,3cawvu,callthebluff,4,Mon Jul 6 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"I think you would be fine switching to 12/55.  Though looking at weeks 4-6, I would strongly consider just staying put but subbing out the LT and Marathon pace runs of week 5 with same length but easy.  If you feel good then, continue on with the 18/55 plan, if not, bounce down."
AdvancedRunning,3cawvu,CookingWine,3,Mon Jul 6 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"If you're in week 4, that means you have a recovery week coming up, right? Perhaps you should double down on the recovery that week? If the plan calls for 35 miles that week, only do 20 with some cross-training thrown in for good measure.    I occasionally get shin splints, and they even turned into a full blown stress fracture at one point. Since then, I've been much more liberal with the recovery and taken a lot of ""down weeks."" I always seem to come out feeling fresh without any shin pain. YMMV."
AdvancedRunning,3cawvu,Gymrat777,3,Mon Jul 6 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"I've had something that sounds like this before. Turns out it was a combination of the muscle adhering to the shin and overall muscle tightness. Hot baths, foam rolling and tiger tail (this) on the front of the shin and all over the calves/achilles helped it go away in a 2-3 weeks. I noticed an immedaite symptom reduction, too.  Or it could be shin splints... I hope it's not."

I have a bit of a nagging pain in my right ankle which I think might be Peroneal Tendinosis.  It doesn't hurt really when I run unless I turn my foot wrong.  I was debating whether to push through it to October and then take a 4-6 week break and just swim or if I should break now.  I think if I'm going to break and still have a decent marathon it needs to be now not during the LT mesocycle.  After reading some responses I might take off a recovery run and swim instead.

I have had similar pain that you describe, to the point where I've looked up stress fractures.  I experience a ton of pain when I'm sitting down cross legged and my kids come sit down on my legs.    Here's a great article that's helped me out: http://www.athletestreatingathletes.com/self-muscle-massage/self-muscle-massage-pt-1-the-calf/  Pay particular attention to the part about the posterior tibialis!  I use a lot of coconut oil on my leg to lubricate my thumb while I work out the knots along the bone.  It hurts like hell!  Doing that massage routine for the past few weeks the nights after my quality days has kept me running even when I was hobbling around thinking I wouldn't run anymore.  It might be that some trigger point work would keep you on track with your current training instead of having to recalibrate.    One other thing I've been doing that I think has helped with my calf pain is this plyometrics routine:  http://www.runningwritings.com/2014/11/building-plyometrics-program-for.html  I'm only on week 3 of the 12 week routine, but I've been doing it 3x a week on my easy days and I think it's helping to strengthen my calves.

Sure it may help you, but so does actually taking EPO... It still isn't right in my eyes  I'm not against taking multivitamins, iron, etc., as these are merely a way to remain healthy, not a way to gain a competitive advantage. But things like Testoboost/Alpha Male/etc. claim to ""naturally boost"" testosterone levels within the constraints of what your body is naturally capable of...

At the beginning of my runs after getting warmed up I've been forefoot striking without trying. It just feels more natural. Then I get tired and start landing farther back on my foot. Anyone else experienced this before? I kinda hope eventually my legs will strengthen up and I'll always forefoot strike. On a related note, what do you guys think of Kinvaras? I kinda want to try a pair soon but I feel like even though it's a cushioned shoe if I didn't transition carefully to a shoe with a low-drop like that I'd probably get injured or something.   I highly suggest checking out FirstToTheFinish today. They are having an awesome sale and I was able to pick up a pair of Saucony Endorphin LD4s for about 18 dollars plus shipping.   I ran a time trial yesterday. 2 miles on the road in 11:44. I'm pretty happy with that. In the middle of the highest mileage week of my life and with no taper before. I had pretty good pacing, which is what I'm most pleased about. I've been working on that a bit this summer. I had a quick start in about 84 then slowed to 92 but after that my slowest quarter was like 88, and managed to close it out with back to back 85s. I still have no kick, but I'm happy with a negative split.   About to hit up some Twilight Zone, coleslaw, and pulled pork. I love Fourth of July. Happy Freedom Day, my fellow patriots!"

I've been able to stretch about 200-300 miles on the two pairs I've had.   FTTF - I picked up a cheap pair of Nike Frees a bit ago as well as a super cheap pair of NB5000 spikes. I've been shopping online for closeout stuff on FTTF since 8th grade! They're great.   TT - Congrats on the time trial.

I probably wouldn't go much more minimal than Kinvaras. I'm most excited about the time trial because, using Daniels Calculator, it predicts about an 18:50 5k, which would be about the third fastest on my XC team."

AdvancedRunning,3c4009,xfkirsten,11,Sat Jul 4 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"5k this morning. Ran it last year at the start of a marathon training cycle and did an 18:44.  Came back this year with significantly more base under my belt, so I was hoping to do better.  I took out the race quite hard at the start--I looked down at the .3 mile mark and saw a 5:00 pace. That's a bit fast. Throttled it back a bit, not wanting to totally expend everything at the start. Hit the first mile at 5:18. Second mile was the hilly one on this out-and-back course (a pair of 40' elevation gain hills; nothing too horrible). My legs were tightening up some at this point and my turnover was lacking. I hit the two mile mark at 11:30 (6:12), which was okay, but I knew I had to buckle down a bit. So I did. I started to push my tempo down just a bit in the last mile, fighting a bit of a headwind coming in. A guy started creeping up on my shoulder so I started kicking at about 300 meters out. Kept accelerating until I hit the line at apparently a 4:18 pace to run a 17:27 (5:57 split).   Now when I look at the watch distance, the race measures out closer to 3 miles than 3.1, but they called it a certified course, so I'll take that. Incidentally, that's a PR (beating a 5k split that I had in an 8k cross country race in November 2005). I'm pretty damn happy with that race, especially coming off of no speedwork and lots of marathon training. Added 7 miles before and after the race to get me to 10 on the day.  Now I'm going to drink beer and BBQ. Long run of 19 mile tomorrow."
AdvancedRunning,3c4009,dinosaurdinosrawr,5,Sat Jul 4 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"Nice! Was the time you ran it last year your 5k PR?   My 5k Canada day race was also on a certified course, but was also .1 short by my watch. Granted, I didn't PR but had I, I definitely would've taken it!"
AdvancedRunning,3c4009,Tweeeked,5,Sat Jul 4 17:39:52 2015 UTC,Nah. My previous 5k PR was a 17:36 split for the first 5k of an 8k back in 2005. It's been a while to sit on that (there was also a 17:02 in 2006 but that course was undoubtedly short to the point that I won't accept the purported distance).

I finished in 26:37, almost a minute faster than last year and 8 seconds slower than my 8k PR.  I ended up first in my age group and 19th overall.  The winner finished in about 23:30 which blows my mind.  Next week will be about the same mileage, maybe a little more because I am doing a 10k.  I'm feeling a little better about it today than I was yesterday, so we will see how it goes."

Not too sure how to feel about it, especially since a lot of the same people who ran it last year were about 30-40 seconds slower than last year and I finished only 8 seconds behind the guy who was 9th in state for crosscountry, who ran 16:45 at this race last year, but you never know if they're going as hard as they can or what kind of shape they're in.  At least I got a trophy this time with 2nd in age group and 4th overall. The first time I ran the race I got 4th in my age group with a 20:40, so the next year when I was much faster I figured I could easily place and get an AG trophy, but a local high school team showed up and kicked my ass and I ended up getting 9th AG.

He says in his book that long runs should be done at 20% slower than MP for the early part, and 10% slower than MP for the latter part.

This is my second time racing in them and I have 3 PRs from those races, so I'm inclined to say I like them. They're surprisingly fast. They're heavier than a traditional flat, but not so much that it's like running with bricks on your feet. They're also more comfortable than any pair of flats I've ever worn, and actually more comfortable than most running shoes I've had as well. But, since I don't own and never have owned flats, I don't have a lot to compare them to beyond stuff I've borrowed. I also do my daily runs in them, so maybe I'm just used to the weight."

AdvancedRunning,3buaic,xcrunner108,17,Thu Jul 2 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"I have devoted the better part of the last year experimenting with different weight loss behaviors, all more or less from Fitzgerald's Racing Weight and the Racing Weight Quick Start books. I will outline some of my learning below.  To begin with, I am far from what a distance runner should look like. I was a football and baseball player all of my life and have a genetic predisposition that makes it easy to put on muscle quickly, but much harder to run marathons. I was a pretty lean 235 pounds and 6 foot 3 inches tall my senior year in high school, a nice build for a fullback/linebacker, but not for any kind of a runner.   I started running in college (5ks and the such) and ran a marathon about a year into running. During the time I dropped to about 205 pounds, losing a lot of my muscle mass. For the past 6 years, I have stayed in a 4 pound range, usually somewhere between 202-206, weighing myself daily. During the time, my training was as low as 20 miles a week and as high as 75, but I decided after after an early fall marathon in 2014, I was going to try to lean down as much as possible. I got an initial body fat measurement at 11% body fat at 199.2 pounds via BodPod.   In the fall, I was running an average of 55 miles a week focusing on a 10 mile race, a 5k, and a 5 mile race. I was focusing on some speed work to improve my marathon running efficiency. From the end of September through December, I was ridiculously strict about what I ate. I counted calories, weighed my food, did it all. With cutting calories, I also tried to really cut down on carbs as well. By the beginning of December, I dropped to 7% body fat at 197 pounds. Even though I dropped 4%, I only lost ~2 pounds.   This was a lot of work and I deprived myself of a lot. As Fitzgerald mentions as a key theme in his books, you should never focus on performance and weight loss at the same time. I was sort of working on both with a heavier focus on weight loss, but it was a tough experience. I ran some of my best times, but I was wiped out at the end of every day. My muscles were constantly sore and I suffered from low energy. I even was intermittent fasting to an extent, usually not eating until noon, just experimenting to see what worked. I continued through the end of December and lost a pound or two more, probably putting me at about 196 pounds at ~6% body fat. I was super lean, but also wiped.   I took a week off of running after a New Year's Eve Race and then focused on a segment leading up to Boston. I always have considered myself a very healthy eater, really focusing on whole foods. Through the fall dieting experiment, if nothing else, I learned a lot about decision making. During my Boston segment, I was going to enter new territory with mileage, etc., so I decided I would stop counting calories and eat by feel. I peaked at about 81 miles during the segment and was averaging 70-75 through most of the block. During this time, I slowly worked my way back up about 204-205 pounds. I was hitting all of my workouts and feeling better than ever, so despite being a bit bummed about it, the results were there. Going into the weeks before Boston, it was the heaviest I had been in a few years, pushing near the 206 mark consistently. Boston came, and I ran a 7 minute PR.   I took two weeks off after Boston and now am working on some speed work during this summer leading into a fall marathon block. I am running more mileage than ever, even with shorter long runs. I am not counting calories, but found myself making decisions to try and get the weight back down again. However, with pushing 80ish miles a week, I started to feel myself wiped out again. Since then, I have started eating more carbs and just more in general. If I am hungry, I eat. I have been doing a few doubles a week and ride my bike ~4-5 miles each way to work daily. My weight currently sits about 197 and I would say I am probably as lean as I can be without sacrificing performance.   My Takeaways    So much of this varies from individual to individual, you do need to experiment a bit to see what works for you During my Boston segment, I was hungry all the time. My snack of choice was fruit, and I ate a lot of it. Something I found that worked for me and I think helps me lean up long term is reaching for something higher in protein as a snack vs. straight carbs. I usually make some scrambled eggs with fresh salsa instead of an apple or two. It is more filling, and I know personally it has produced better results.  With that being said, carbs are very important. The times I have felt the most wiped out have been when cutting carbs big time. If you're running a lot, you need them. Fitzgerald emphasizes this big time and has some guidelines depending on how much you are exercising per week. I have bread and fruit, but it is not my go-to, and that has been a good place for me to land. I use things like yogurt and cottage cheese in their place which is higher in protein and less carbohydrate dense.  I think when you really push the limits of your body to lose a few pounds, it just isn't sustainable and you are going to gain that weight back if you focus on performance and not on diet. I think dieting or working some initial weight off is important, but if you are running a lot your body is going to find its racing weight. Some people are going to be naturally leaner and some are not. I feel I am pretty lean now, but my legs are very muscular and they are changing slowly, but that is going to take time. I wish that weren't the case, but I think many of these adaptions may take a long time, even with good habits.  Eat whole foods, and just be mindful of the carbs. You have to eat them, but when you do try to make them from the best sources possible.  I run my easy days fasted most of the time. It has a lot of benefits from a metabolic side for marathon running, but the lower heart rate accompanied with glycogen depletion accelerates fat loss.  I have found what works for me is making really good decisions, most of time, very consistently has produced the best results. You start to learn when your body is telling you something, and for long term results, you have to feed your body in those states. Eat when you're body really is telling you it needs food, not just out of boredom.    Sorry to the long, long response. I just have focused my attention on it in big ways and have learned a ton. I have several excerpts from books and web pages clipped into Evernote and would be happy to share. Hopefully this is somewhat helpful!."
AdvancedRunning,3buaic,thebulljames,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""easy days fasted""? No eating at all before or after the run?"
AdvancedRunning,3buaic,JewishIGuess,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"Just before. I'll have a cup of coffee, and I will eat after, but no food before.   On days where I am working out, I will usually have something before hand. Long runs I alternate between fasted and not fasted, but that is more for trying to make my body more efficient at using fat as a fuel source than it is losing weight."
AdvancedRunning,3buaic,thebulljames,2,Thu Jul 2 15:56:56 2015 UTC,"Do you know your body fat percentage? That's really the important issue....   However, At 5'5 and 130, that does sound a tad heavy for a distance runner, especially at 80 mpw. I'm 6'1 and in the process of getting back to my competitive level again getting up to only 60 mpw, and I've dropped from 160 to 155 in 6-8 weeks with no effort at a all. I eat healthy, lots of fruits, vegetables, lean meats... But I don't count calories or moderate... I eat when I'm hungry and drink lots of water.   Are you sure you're eating only the number of calories you think you're eating? What kind of calories are you taking in? 100 calories of fruit is not the same as 100 calories of chocolate..."
AdvancedRunning,3buaic,Distance_Runner,4,Thu Jul 2 12:23:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, in terms of weight loss alone, those 100 calories are absolutely identical.   But I agree with you in a sense because the fiber in the fruit will make you feel more full, thus less likely to eat more calories. And of course for athletes like you guys, the macros and nutrients are very important--but in a strict CICO sense, no difference."
AdvancedRunning,3buaic,Some_Other_Sherman,6,Thu Jul 2 13:05:27 2015 UTC,"In terms of energy, yes, but you're body processes them differently in the presence of fiber... which was the point. So technically, yes they are the same, but not everyone is a scientist/nutritionist; it's easier to state it in simpler terms for people to understand, 100 calories of fruit is not the same as 100 calories of processed sugars."

I've been high teens before. When I was that low, I was running very well (locally competitive). I then got injured and have been struggling to get back to where I once was with my speed. I'm getting closer, paying very close attention to what I'm consuming; I follow a vegetarian (but mostly vegan diet) and eat/drink virtually no junk and make nearly all my own meals. I try not to count calories but have been known to skip meals.   Last night I ran like shit, but this past Sunday, I PR'd half-marathon distance by 7 minutes on a training run.  For what it's worth I ate incredibly healthy last week; but on Wednesday, I ate like crap and barely ate on Thursday to make up for it.   It is a very fine line to walk (well run) between what is healthy and what is not. I've crossed that line far too often. Be careful."

Average of 5:30/mile for ""on"" and 6:14/mile for ""off."" Another session of 4x1mi with 70-90s jog between in 5:04, 5:08, 5:05, 5:06 + 4x.5mi with 60s jog in 2:34, 2:31, 2:34, 2:33.   2,628 miles though halfway. Well over pace to my goal of 4,800 which is what I ran in 2014. I've PRd at 10k and HM. I'll at least be doing a mile on the track, mile on the road, and a few road 5ks so I'm hoping a few more PRs are in store.  I've incorporated a lot of the suggestions from the thread, but more input is helpful! Hopefully we'll be ready to publish it soon for community editing.  Both the W800 and W3kSC are extremely deep in talent. New faces in the W1500, can Kerri Gallagher or Lauren Johnson get the standard? An older face of Amy Acuff placed 3rd in the WHJ. She's been jumping competitively since 1992!!! M800 was entertaining to watch, but painful to watch Solomon get deep in the hurt zone. Centrowitz can close like a freight train in the M1500, but Robby Andrews can close like a jet breaking the sound barrier. Top 3 M3kSC broke the meet record.  I watched a documentary on Netflix called ""Tiny House"" and now I want to build one.  Columbus has a pretty large firework show on the 3rd but I'm working that night so I will probably not go. The morning of the 4th I'll be running a 4 miler, then listening to patriotic music the rest of the day and counting everything in freedom units.  More on the specifics later, but I did my first ""Special Block"" on Monday. Workouts in the AM and PM both focusing on Marathon Pace. Covered 24.5 miles during the day which is my highest ever."

Is the special block a marathon only thing or do you think it'd have benefits at all distances if you made it event-specific?   I actually laughed at Solomon when I saw the final. I applaud him for having the guts but he shouldn't have announced his strategy to the world and if you're going to go that hard make sure you know you aren't gonna die that badly.

One example of a shorter distance runner using a block would be Caleb Nkidu. His day was AM: 10k@30:00 on rolling dirt roads PM: 2x10x300.   Mine was:  AM - 6k @ 3:39/k (5:52/mile), 60s jog, 6k @ 3:19/k (5:20/mile).  PM - 6k @ 3:39/k (5:52/mile), 90s jog rest, 6 x 1k with 90s jog between in 3:15/k (5:13/mile).

Did a bib transfer yesterday and will hopefully drop 7 minutes from March's marathon PR to break 4 hours at the Marine Corp Marathon in the fall :) Year so far has been good, reflecting on June in yesterday's monthly thread was really helpful. Around 690 for the year, was around 730 at this point last year but should surpass that since I'm about to increase my weekly mileage on the current plan for MCM, more than what I was doing last year.   4 - Going out dancing with some girlfriends on Friday. 4 mile race Saturday morning, and something involving food and friends later. So I have plans, but not definitive ones yet!  5 - Just wrote up a long paragraph to ask for everyone's opinion on some Feb/March races I'm considering, but as I was writing, I convinced myself of a decision. Well, partially, at least. Now I just have to decide whether I want to do the 20M, which is tough (estimated finish time = your full PR + half an hour), or the 40M, which is tough and then tough in reverse!!

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Mickothy,3,Wed Jul 1 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"4 - It's not any legitimate kind of dancing like to a salsa place or anything like that, we're just planning to go out to one of the bars around us and will probably dance like goofballs to whatever generic amped-up pop music the DJ plays! We don't take our dancing very seriously, just wanna have fun and be silly... not to mention people-watch, which is fabulously (and hysterically) entertaining on the dance floor!   5 - Should be a fun one! ""Fun"" being used loosely, here..."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,whatshisface9,4,Wed Jul 1 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"I guess sophomore year of high school when I started getting a lot better. Running under 5 gave me a lot of confidence going forward that I wish I had capitalized more on.   This will be my third time running Philly (2012, 2013). Looking for some redemption after miles 8 and onward wrecked me in 2013."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"Very cool. Gotcha, so you're no stranger to the route. Ugh yeah, that part around the zoo through the Fairmount is a bit brutal."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,durunnerafc,3,Wed Jul 1 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I go to Drexel, so those ending miles are on my runs almost every day. I'll be doing workouts on that Lansdowne hill at least once a month in the build up."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,teuker,2,Wed Jul 1 22:03:13 2015 UTC,Nice - gonna have friends come cheer you on while you run up 33rd?! That stupid hill. Did you ever do the ODDyssey half? That hill is around mile 12 of the race... who came up with that brilliant idea?
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,durunnerafc,2,Thu Jul 2 01:18:52 2015 UTC,"No, but I had friends run ODDyssey, it was hot this year. June is not an ideal time to run a half."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,durunnerafc,9,Thu Jul 2 03:35:49 2015 UTC,"I am on track to hit 42 mpw again this week, then I think I am going to climb up to 45 mpw next week. I had a rough 10 miles today due to having to swap some runs around for 4th of July, and I think my legs hadn't quite recovered from Saturdays 10 (hilly) miles and Mondays 1000s. I think the increase of mileage is also starting to get to me, though, so I might have to dip down in mileage for a week shortly, which will be glorious.   Year has been going pretty well so far, but I'm a little behind on the mileage goals. My average mileage took a hit in track season because my coach doesn't think we need that much mileage for track :(. I managed to hit my 800 and 1600 goal (Hurrah! (2:12 w/ a 2:15 goal on the 800 and a 5:09 on the 1600 with a 5:10 goal)), but I was a few seconds shy on the 3200 (11:38 with an 11:30 goal). My PR in the 3200 came early on in the season, and my legs just never felt as good in following 3200 races :(.  I love all of the ideas in that post, and I can't wait for the wiki to be finished! It will be a great collection of info when it is over, no doubt. I have continued quietly cheering for Rupp (cuz innocent until proven guilty, right?), and watching him pull away in the 10k was fun. I was expecting him to claim the 5k title as well, but I'm also glad that it was a tight race, albeit slow. I was also surprised that Fisher didn't claim the 1500 title, but sit and kick races can get interesting very very quickly. In the 800, I feel for Soloman, but I guess that's what you get for trying to do something you're not ready for. I did not watch anything else, unfortunately. I didn't notice that WS100 was this week until after the fact :(. Does anyone know what the next significant race is? I think I'm going to head over to my dads for the 4th and hang out. That plan is upsetting the running schedule (had to do my long run today instead of Saturday, wasn't fun), but oh well. The weather in Iowa has been great for running in the morning thus far, so lets hope that it stays that way!"

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,8,Wed Jul 1 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you've got a half goal in there Mickey, your marathon PR laughs at your half PR!  Feeling a bit rough this week, I've decided to have some down time and give my body a rest this week. In reality, this is my first year of consistent running, and an injury is probably around the corner otherwise. Hit 18:00 dead on in a 5k a the weekend which was good enough for second place but not really near where I thought I should be at.   My main goal this year was consistency, and I feel like I've managed that so far! A solid block between now and October should see me hit all of my time goals, judging from my progress in the first half of the year. Already contributed on this one, the ideas in that thread sounded really good. Pass. Where to start? England women's football team progressed to the World Cup semi final on Saturday. You Yanks are already in the final and we will meet you there if we can beat Japan tomorrow night! Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club (my home team) are currently languishing bottom of the County Championship, but a strong batting display today has put us in a good position to beat Worcestersire tomorrow. Wimbledon has begun, with Andy Murray beating Mikhail Kukushkin in his first round match. In other news, le Tour de France starts on Saturday, get hyped people! Sorry, I forgot this was a running forum... I'm visiting Manchester to see some friends, not looking forward to the 4/5 hour train journey in this heat!"

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,durunnerafc,4,Wed Jul 1 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Contador is still around. Never have liked the guy, so hopefully he doesn't come away with the win.

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,teuker,7,Wed Jul 1 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm back from Scandinavia.  I totally recommend checking out that part of the world if you've never been.  I was able to run in Denmark, Norway, and Finland.  Due to time contraints I wasn't able to run outdoors in Sweden, Germany, or Estonia.  Due to very strict visa issues, I couldn't run in Russia.  Putin says no to running.  Here are some photos I took while running if you'd like to check them out.  The amount of daylight they get up there this time of year is crazy.   June was a good month.  285 miles.  My yearly totals will lag behind because I was out of commission for 8 weeks earlier this year, but I should be able to hit about 2k total for the year.  No regrets yet about my marathon plan selection.  Hoping to stay healthy. I think all the suggestions for the wiki are great, and I appreciate your work putting it together, Catzerz. Jenny Simpson is amazing. Not sure if anyone here is a fan of the band The National, but I watched a documentary by them while on vacation called Mistaken For Strangers. It was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be a typical rock documentary with some excerpt of concerts and backstage banter, but it was much more interesting.   My kids want to see the new Terminator movie.  Reviews are so-so, and I'd rather rewatch Terminator 2 at home and have a beer.  I still remember that movie coming out like it was yesterday, but I'm also old as shit. Happy Canada Day!  Also, congrats to the US Women's team for beating Germany!"

I haven't been to Estonia, Sweden or Russia, but absolutely loved Denmark and Norway when I went last year (post-Berlin Marathon touring). I'm curious -- how much did the amount of sunlight mess with your sleeping?  Also, I'm a fan of The National, so I'll have to check out that documentary!"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,teuker,4,Wed Jul 1 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"The tough part was telling yourself it was time to get ready for bed.  You'd look out the window at 10pm and it looked like was the afternoon.  So that signal that it was time to wind it down for the evening never came.  In Russia, they call it the 'white nights', because it never got dark.  It was twilight from 1am-4am, and then it was bright again.  Once we got ready for bed and pulled the blinds it was easy (the bottle of wine with dinner helped too).    I disliked the documentary for the first 30 minutes, but then I got into it once I realized where it was going.  It's less about the band, and more about the lead singer's relationship with his family."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,ForwardBound,4,Wed Jul 1 16:47:16 2015 UTC,Great photos! That's absolute insane with the amount of daylight.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,JewishIGuess,4,Wed Jul 1 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Catzerz.  The thing I'll remember most about the trip was the crazy amount of daylight.  The second most memorable thing is how bicycle and runner friendly these cities are.  If cities dating back to the 12th century with cobblestone streets can be retrofitted with bike and pedestrian lanes, there's no reason why it can't be widespread in the states."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,ForwardBound,3,Wed Jul 1 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"Urban planner here! It actually is really difficult, but not because of the shitty design of our North American cities. It is the shitty culture that we have attached to the shitty design. Our cities were designed around car culture, around escaping the city, and that is still a very hard thing to change. We urban planners are really really trying, but come up against so much resistance."

I don't work on weekends, so I try to make time for them on weekends to make up for it.    Independence day would be a good one to watch.  My kids are pre-adolescents, and I'm trying to introduce them to some of the cult classic movies from my era.  We watched Aliens a few weeks ago, which they liked.  It's great seeing these old movies again through fresh eyes."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,ForwardBound,4,Wed Jul 1 19:05:13 2015 UTC,Great photos--and I'm envious of that trip (Putin or no Putin). And that's a fantastic documentary--I love The National (though they are one of the few bands I've never found to be more compelling live versus on an album)
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,chickenwithcheez,4,Wed Jul 1 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"Completely agree about the National.  Given their genre of music, you'd think they'd have more energy on stage.  The only other band that was disappointing live was the xx."

I've seen them three times live (two festivals, one solo show) and while good, they just didn't really connect like I'd hope they would.

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,chickenwithcheez,6,Thu Jul 2 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"I'm having an okay week. I don't feel as good as I usually do. I started lifting on Monday so that may have an effect and my long run took a lot more out of me than I originally thought. I had a tempo today that I wanted to be 3.5-4 miles at 6:35-6:40 pace but ended up as 3 miles at 6:45. It happens. I'm not too bothered because the last few miles of my long run were almost tempo pace, like 6:50. I do hope I can nail it next week. I'm doing a time trial this week but I have no idea what it will be. My teammate wants to do a mile on the track, but I kind of want to do a 3k/2 mile on the roads, as that'd be a better benchmark for XC fitness. Anyone got any advice there?   •Mileage is okay so far. It wasn't very high at the beginning of the year but really except for rest weeks this year I don't see a week going under 30-35. Might dip that low only in championship season for cross and track.   •I think the shoe review threads should be in a category on the wiki. If we get a lot of reviews it'd be nice to have a library to read when considering new shoes. Also, surprised we haven't seen reviews for the Vomero 10 yet. I've heard the shoe is godly.  •USAs was incredible. I'm glad Emily Infeld made the team. Wish she was in the 5k. I don't think Rupp and True are going to let Ryan Hill beat them again. Robby Andrews has the nastiest kick in the country, but I think at Worlds he won't get a chance to use it. Our whole 1500 team is kickers, and I think someone is gonna recognize it and take the race out harder. I don't think that takes Centro out of it though.   •I watched True Detective and Ballers this week. Haven't seen all of True Detective yet, but it's awesome so far. Ballers is pretty good and if you've got HBO and like football at all I suggest you check it out.  •I'm gonna eat a lot of pulled pork. That's all I got.  •I got to try out the Lord and Savior of TrackTalk.net, Nike Zoom Victories today. Pretty good spike but I was on a rock hard, 20 year old track so I can't tell all that well. My school is getting a new track this month so I'm hype."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 15:58:50 2015 UTC,2 - Will add that section. Maybe a sort of archive where people can put their reviews in.   6 - I remember when I got my first pair of vics. Bright lime green colorway looked so fast!
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of the TrackTalk master review threads. One of the best resources on the internet for a runner, IMO, and we could build something similar. I've got the black/volt sponsored athlete colorway. I picked them up super cheap on eBay and I love them. I was looking at the spike collection thread on here from a few months ago and saw your collection and got jealous. I need to get a job so I can feed my spike addiction."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,chickenwithcheez,2,Wed Jul 1 17:12:34 2015 UTC,"Haha I think half of my collection is filled with Streaks, Matumbos, and Victories. I think I have a problem. I'll add a page to the Wiki for shoe related things in general with more specific sub pages."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,2,Wed Jul 1 17:49:09 2015 UTC,How many spikes are you up to Cheezer?
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,chickenwithcheez,3,Wed Jul 1 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"A pair of black/volt Vic 2s, blue/orange Shay XC4s, and a pair of black/red Kilkenny XC5s, which are pretty crappy. They are basically road flats with spike receptacles. I might actually use them on the road since they have an all rubber outsole. I'll ask you since instead of making a new thread, but do you using XC spikes with no spikes would work on the road?"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,duhrandomkid,2,Wed Jul 1 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm. It'd be possible. But. I would honestly say once you did it the spike would be 100% toast because you'd rock up the spike holes. I dont think it'd be a problem. Unless, does your spike have plastic plates throughout the outsole? If so, it might slip and slide a bit. Rubber > Plastic.   Saucony just made the endorphin racer which is the same upper as the endorphin spike but with an outsole that is a road flat. It is INSANE how light it is.   Anyway, long story short, yeah you could do it. But dont ever plan on using them with spikes again."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Mickothy,2,Wed Jul 1 18:42:38 2015 UTC,I didn't plan on using them again. They are super heavy for a spike. Outsole is all rubber. I'll probably use them because IDGAF if I can't put spikes in the hole.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 1 18:48:22 2015 UTC,Go out for a few strides in them tonight and report back. I am curious. I remember the killkenny. It isnt my favorite. Itd probably be fine.

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 1 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"3 miles at 6:45 pace is still a solid tempo considering your PR. A 2 mile would probably be a better indication of xc fitness, imo. I have friends who are great at the 2 mile and 5k, but can't pull the speed for a mile.  I really loved the first season of True Detective, but I'm having trouble getting into the second season. Ballers so far is pretty meh imo, but I plan on sticking it out to see if it gets better."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,teuker,2,Wed Jul 1 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"After thinking a bit more about the tempo I'm pretty pleased. I have to remember that it's still early summer and I'm in no sort of shape to be putting up godly tempos. I think I am leaning towards the 3k/2 mile time trial. Mile is about the bottom end of my range for events that I'm good at and I haven't worked speed at all this summer, so I don't think it'd be very indicative of my fitness. I've got a route in my neighborhood that is exactly 3k so that looks to be the plan."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,jaylapeche,2,Wed Jul 1 17:09:20 2015 UTC,I think the best part about these tempos is that they will teach you some strength and mental toughness to be in the hurt for an extended period of time.

Training has been going so well (I got some hamstring pain recently, but it seems to be better). I don't have any mileage goals, and I tend to always set my goals impossibly high so that I can't hit them... but in the fall I will! sub 15:30 here I come!! I don't know I only watched the mens 5k, but that was a pretty interesting race! No I usually go and see fireworks, but I think this year I'm going to see a baseball game for the first time ever (I don't like watching baseball games).

There was actually a ton of interesting stuff, most of which we already talked about in the live thread(s?). The only other thing I've been watching is True Detective. What does everyone else think? I'm enjoying it so far but I looked back on the last season just via some Youtube clips and it was soooo good. I'm going to a wedding on Cape Cod, a popular summer vacation destination in Massachusetts. I'm nervous about the traffic but I'm sure the wedding itself will be enjoyable.

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,teuker,3,Wed Jul 1 16:17:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd say only certain seasons of The Wire are up there with the first season of True Detective. I want to know more about Bird Face!
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 17:45:27 2015 UTC,6 - Have you thought about getting a pair of compression socks? I know the science behind them is mixed but I've found that they've helped whenever I have a strain.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Wed Jul 1 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"No, that never occurred to me. If it ever flairs up again I'll get some."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:24 2015 UTC,Highly recommend the CEP brand. I believe catzerz will agree.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Wed Jul 1 18:12:46 2015 UTC,Best in the game by far.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've got a bit of a calf strain right now too.  Do you wear them during runs or after?"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,dinosaurdinosrawr,2,Wed Jul 1 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"I wear the full compression socks whenever I'm at work, so 30-40 hours a week. If it's particularly bad I'll wear them to sleep in. I have the Dynamic Short Sock from CEP that I wear during 90% of runs and it has a bit of Achilles support."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,durunnerafc,3,Wed Jul 1 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's kind of what I figured.  I've got a pair of the CEP full compression socks so I'll wear those when I'm not running."

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,7,Thu Jul 2 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"50 for the week, joint highest mileage week with last week. Two track workouts, the first being 8x400m @75s each with a 400m jog and the second being 4x1mile @5:52/mile with 60s rest and then 4x200m at the end to remind myself how to run fast. Training's going well and hoping to hit my goals on Saturday.   Spent most of the year and all of track season injured so the year's not been too kind to me, but I'm starting to get serious about my running for the first time so I guess it's not too bad. Only on track to hit 1200 as a result but I assure you that it'll be much higher than that. Mainly just some simple training ideas and short explanations of the various types of training, links to training books such as Daniel's and Advanced Marathoning, and something about how to find the right shoes for oneself. Almost all of the races (men's at least, women's were much faster) were just very slow sit and kick races, especially the Junior Men's 1500m (3:58!!!). It did make for some exciting finishes and upsets though. Solomon in the 800 was just sad. Nope 5k race in the morning then just regular 4th of July stuff. Houston weather is unforgiving."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,callthebluff,4,Wed Jul 1 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"2 - I would honestly say the best resource is to just go to the running store and try them on. Internet searches arent going to do you any good unless you know what shoes feel like prior. Sure, the searches will be great to teach you the intricacies of the shoes themselves. But, nothing can beat trying them on. I definitely enjoy a customer who comes in wanting to try on a bunch of shoes and asks questions about themselves / shoe technology."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,durunnerafc,2,Wed Jul 1 18:11:34 2015 UTC,3 - That last lap in the JR 1500 was insane. 52.xx for Hunter as a high school is bonkers.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Mickothy,2,Wed Jul 1 17:06:43 2015 UTC,6 - Summer running in Texas is just the worst thing ever. Austin's bad and I can imagine Houston is another brand of hellishness.
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,callthebluff,6,Wed Jul 1 18:32:42 2015 UTC,"Mickey Mick. Nice interview. Definitely can concur with the first time under 5 and the tears after a full. I cant really tell if me crying during Boston was because of pain or because of the overwhelming joy of seeing the Citgo Sign.    Year has gone great. I am really enjoying running. i think the biggest thing that I have learned / biggest change in my running since 2015 started is that 1 hr of running is now a daily occurrence. 8 mi has become the new 4. and 12-14 has become the new 8. I feel like a better runner. Other goals, some race goals but its still a little early to say times.  Nope. Just maybe some tips from /u/forwardbound about how to excel as a SOTTC member and/or how to deal with the anxiety of not being a member. I am super stoked for Erik. He seemed a little nervous talking to him in the store. But, to see him show up so hard that day was incredible. I loved watching the womens 10k. For the first time in a while it felt like an honest / productive race rather than this sit and kick garbage that has been going on. Seeing Molly, Shalane, Infeld, and even Sisson for a while, battling it out was fantastic. Speaking of Infeld, SUPER stoked for her. Finally, I've said this but I am heartbroken for Leah. Darn that last water jump. Hmm. I didnt see much else. My parents watched Ridiculousness a lot. That was interesting. My mom got a hole in one on Tiger Woods 2007 on the wii.  Friday, I am going on a canoe trip. Saturday running a race and doing some America things. But, avoiding all fireworks. Havent quite been able to go to fireworks since 2013. Sunday, long run. Going to do it with someone who has never broken the 2 hrs barrier. So thatll be fun to be the pace car. (coincidentally its the same person who I wrote about in my mini race report yesterday). My parents got me a ninja blender. It really has upped my GI game. My body is lovin it."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,4,Wed Jul 1 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"1 - Isn't it really a weird feeling when longer distances feel shorter?!? It's cool, though. I forget - what are you training for?  5 - this weekend sounds like it'll be a really fun one!! What do you mean the ""2 hrs barrier"" - she hasn't run for more than two hours at a go before? Or is there some certain distance she's trying to break 2 hours for?  6 - Nice - time for smoothie experiments galore!"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,callthebluff,3,Wed Jul 1 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"1 - I'm currently in the ring for RnR chi with the ultimate goal of MKE in October!   2 - she's never run > 2 hrs. It'll be fun to see what she thinks. When I did big sur, it was the first time I had run for that long (3:59). Man. I can't even fathom being like a 5+ hr marathoner. It took so much mental strength to be out there for almost 4 hrs."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,3,Wed Jul 1 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"1 - oh wow, RnR is soon! That's exciting!  2 - Gotcha, that'll definitely be an interesting experience for her, then!! Hopefully she enjoys it! I'm on the slower side, so 2 hours is the norm for the shorter of my long runs haha. The hours and hours out there definitely take a mental toll, but we (or I, at least... I can only speak for myself) get used to it eventually - I can imagine that it was completely exhausting your first time out for so long at Big Sur!!"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,callthebluff,3,Wed Jul 1 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly have so much respect for you since you can stay focused for that long.   It was exhausting more because it was 6 days after Boston. But, man, those last 20 miles I was hurting."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 1 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks. WHAT?!? A 6 day turnaround time?!? Whew. I wouldn't blame you if you changed that to ""those last 26 miles""..."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,callthebluff,3,Wed Jul 1 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"1 - that kind of progress is so fulfilling. Of course, our goals are about getting faster, but being able to handle so much more running is a huge incentive to keep the work up"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"1 - That's a great feeling; easy runs of an hour? Yeah, no problem there. It's good to be (more) badass."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,ForwardBound,2,Wed Jul 1 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it was. So much emotion after those races. I think it must just be first time elation, like ""yeah, you can run those races, and you killed them!"""
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,6,Wed Jul 1 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"That 10 mile time sticks a little bit... feeling good that day?  Just focusing on base at the moment.  Between that and a busy stretch at work, things have been a little scattered training wise - losing some focus on the ""why"" of each run.  Oh well, base training can survive that as long as the miles get in, 70+ last week.    So far so good.  Should there be something on goal setting?  Process or product goals?  I'm making stuff up here.  I think overall the US got a strong team out there.  Some things I would change (m800, m10k), but I think this overall a strong team.  The sprinters looked pretty good too, and I think Jamaica is having an off year.  Be nice to see some domination there.  I've been watching a bad zombie TV show - Z Nation.  I play it while I work.  Calling it a poor man's Walking Dead would insult the poor.  I'm going to be free."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,3,Wed Jul 1 16:53:07 2015 UTC,What would you change in the 800 and 10k?
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,pand4duck,3,Wed Jul 1 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"Boris, Solomon, and Symmonds for the 800 - they are the ones with the speed to be relevant.  Sub in Derrick for Mead for the 10k.  I think he'd be recovered more for worlds and has a better chance of being relevant in the race.  That said, you have run the races and qualify.  The guys who did earned their spots and their shots."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,Tweeeked,2,Wed Jul 1 17:48:54 2015 UTC,2 - Goal setting could be legit. Would be interesting to have a database

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,flocculus,2,Thu Jul 2 16:39:29 2015 UTC,2 - That would be a good discussion thread to have at some point
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,flocculus,2,Wed Jul 1 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"Guess so. Ran it again this year 5 seconds slower. You would think all these miles would have made my time drop hard by now, right?"
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,dinosaurdinosrawr,3,Wed Jul 1 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can complain too much, that thing is an outlier and by far your best result, IMO.  Something about that distance apparently works for you."
AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,flocculus,5,Wed Jul 1 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"Year is good so far! I survived the winter and BQ'd because of it, which was one of my bigger goals this season! I am also on track for my 3000 mile goal.  Nope. Coburn dominated. Rupp's wins from now on will always be questioned. Nah. Tour de France starts soon and so do the Pan Am Games. It's Canada Day!

AdvancedRunning,3brb6c,The_Horse_sized_Duck,2,Thu Jul 2 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"I think I am similar to Watson. I think it is really something simple she should have done, because then the organizers don't have to scour for athletes...but at the same time she is one of our best hurdlers so come on. Come on.  Are you saying eating poutine and saying sorry is not a normal day? I actually had poutine last night so I guess I'm living the stereotype."

I predict the cutoff will be somewhere between BQ-1:10 and BQ-1:25. I was going to say that the qualifying standards for 2017 will remain the same, but now I'm not so sure.  They didn't explicitly say that the standards will remain the same for 2017 like they did for the 2016 race during last year's Boston registration announcement press release (http://www.baa.org/news-and-press/news-listing/2014/june/baa-announces-2015-boston-marathon-registration-dates.aspx).  However, I doubt it's going to be a uniform tightening of the qualifying standards by five minutes across all genders and age groups a la 2013, given that they not once came close to filling the field with just the BQ-5:00 and better runners."
