tampa,3e2dov,anuhn,7,Tue Jul 21 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"Most electric utilities are required to have an energy audit program and/or maintain a list of qualified contractors. Check the utility website or ads for more info.      If you haven't already done so, ask your HVAC contractor check out your unit. Often just cleaning the coils of the A frame and outside unit makes a big difference. They can also advise you on the size/age of the unit and if replacement with a more efficient unit is cost effective.  You may also want to have an electrician check your panel, check appliance operations.  Often an HVAC contractor can do both upon request."
tampa,3e2dov,ispland,6,Tue Jul 21 13:03:26 2015 UTC,"I gained no value from the Teco Audit. Their techs look for smoking guns; they don't actually perform a real energy audit. Things I would have expected: - Seals around windows and doors - Ductwork, returns, seals for HVAC - Temperature differences between rooms, attic, exterior colors, etc.  What they did do was read the amperage usage on various home electronics and create a shitty spreadsheet to explain obvious things. They recommended turning fans OFF.  OP, chances are we're all experiencing a wet-hot summer with increased rates. Your HVAC may be aging a bit and using more energy to maintain temperature. Sadly, your cost to replace the unit prematurely will never be made up via energy savings."

I have a newer home with upgraded windows and insulation and all that, so I figured savings wouldn't be much for me and didn't read much into it."
tampa,3e2dov,airtower,4,Tue Jul 21 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"http://www.tampaelectric.com/residential/saveenergy/energyaudit/  Little bits I have learned being a cheap SOB over the years.  Good ceiling fans.  Any room you spend time in should have as large as possible fan that can really move air.  I have a 60inc in my bedroom.  Moving air at 78 feels fine.  Set that ac to 78.  Wear really light weight clothing.   In my condo my electric bill is way less than 100 a month in summer while my neighbors who keep the ac set at 72 or less get 150-200 dollar bills (bonus, my ac will last 50% longer than theirs saving me money on replacement also)  I know 78 sounds warm but with moving air and getting used to it it is fine.  Been doing it for many years.  It is florida after all.  Now if I am forced to be in a place that is set to 72 I am looking to put on jeans and a light jacket.   Timed thermostat helps.  Set it to be 80-81 for those working hours and drop back to 78 an hour or so before you get home,  I do it also for night time,  I dont get hot in bed,  I got a giant fan keeping my bedroom feeling good.  I switched all my recessed can lights from halogen to LED. They use less power and generate almost no heat saving me AC run time.  When I owned an older house I had the attic insulated, and the duct work for the ac resealed and cleaned out.  I installed solar vent fans when I had to have a new roof installed.  Down side.  Once you get used to 78 and going around the house naked or close to it a cold snap in winter really sucks.   Good news is that there are few of those here and many more hot hot hot  days."
tampa,3e2dov,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"We actually have our a/c set to 77 or 78. 77 is really cold compared to 78. Which is why I am a bit confused. If we start putting it to 79, its just unbearable. During the winter, we barely even use 10 kwh a day. Max is 16 that I've seen. Mostly cause the A/C is off."

tampa,3e2dov,jesseaknight,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:54 2015 UTC,"you can start by changing some things to see what helps.   use a programmable thermostat and let the temperature rise when you know you'll be away for a while (at work). slowly raise the temp in your house. in 3 weeks, try to change the ""comfortable"" temperature of your body by 4 degrees change the filter on your AC make sure the fins are clean on your AC unit outside (some people pressure wash them, but they can be delicate) close blinds to block direct sun (light colored is better) use caulk, expanding foam, and weather stripping to stop airflow through your house (check exterior openings first, then all penetrations in your ceiling, then possibly the floor) seal up ductwork so you're not spilling cold turn your hot water heater down a few degrees generally do anything you can to use less energy (bake less, etc).   Most of those are DIY for a typical family, but do whatever you can and see how it affects your bill."
tampa,3e2dov,tinybubbles1234,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:47 2015 UTC,Good stuff. Yes slowly increasing the inside temp is the way to go.  Trying to go from 72 to 77-78 overnight will not be fun.  Note on the ac filter.  It is better to use the cheapest thin filters and replace them regularly.  The more expensive/thicker ones restrict to much air flow and make the ac work harder to move air.   Just get the cheap blue ones and replace them every 3 weeks to a month in the months the ac is running.
tampa,3e2dov,imforserious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"It's set at 78 24/7, we sometimes set it to 81 when we arent home. We do see that 77 is totally freezing at the house compared to 78. Not sure why."
tampa,3e2dov,jesseaknight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:30 2015 UTC,"You need to use fans. Have the fans on high in the areas that you are in. Also wear light clothing it's Florida. When you leave the house turn the A/C off(or up really high). It gets hot but it's better for the a/c to run for a while when you get home than turning on and off all day when you aren't home. Fans, put them on high! Make sure they are spinning in the right direction. You should feel air coming straight down underneath it. Close/restrict the vents in areas that are naturally cooler. Most of the time it will be a downstairs or tile floor where its coolest. Also keep good insulated blinds and shades on sunny windows. This will keep out some heat. Keep those door closed(were you raised in a barn!?) and don't leave the oven door open for a long time. That can heat up a room quick. Also like everyone else said insulation on your doors and windows. Where is the cool air escaping and the hot air coming in?"

If the thermostat is bad/failing or if it is positioned near an AC vent/intake, it can affect how often your AC kicks on. It may read 78, when, in reality, most of the house is 75 or lower.  Your remark that 77 is cold makes me think that this is the case. A new thermostat is fairly cheap, and they sell plastic covers that can help if the AC blows directly on it."

tampa,3e0h2h,2step2dmb,3,Tue Jul 21 00:31:41 2015 UTC,I literally just went there on the 19th (yesterday).  You absolutely can have coolers. Make sure they are not those disposable coolers though (like the Styrofoam ones.) Make sure you don't bring alcoholic beverages. Even if you hid it in a container they check everything (they have a device that detects alcohol in drinks). Also make sure EVERYTHING you bring is NOT disposable. No plastic water bottles etc... But you can use Tupper ware stuff and its all good.   Have fun :)

tampa,3e0h2h,mblitch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:11 2015 UTC,That is the thing. I don't buy the 'only if you have something to hide'. So I will refuse searches on principal. Ever allow a cop to search and never answer cop questions. It will never help you if they wanted to push something into court.

You can have coolers and alcohol on the river.  It's a pretty chill place to go have a great day on the river and no hassles like Rainbow River.

tampa,3dz60r,the_dude_imbibes,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"Sure, why not.   If you want a taste of something that's a bit of a local 'staple', ie a good Cuban sandwich, I recommend swinging by La Ideal. Cuban or Large Cuban, depending if you're hungry or really hungry, all the way. I would NOT recommend getting them for later, as they get soggy after a while and then not the greatest, it's best to eat them very soon after you get them. Interesting place too, it's a converted house.   A somewhat distant second for a good Cuban sandwich is the West Tampa Sandwich Shop.   Both of these places have been around for a long time, for a reason.     Getting away from 'Tampa staples', if you want to try other things, I'm one of those people who go with friends and try out new food places all over the area. I've been told I should blog my adventures, but eh, it's just food. Some really good, some not so good, and a few places I won't ever return to.    If you want the best Japanese place I've yet found in central FL, it happens to be I ai Sushi. It isn't a local staple, but it's rare to find a great Japanese diner. Think something akin to a ""Mom's Burger's"" serving American staples, this just happens to be Japanese staples, and they make good use of the fish markets in the area. It isn't all sushi, there's a large assortment of cooked foods. Their takoyaki is excellent.   Unfortunately, my favorite Chinese placed burned down a month ago. Haven't found a good replacement yet.   For Italian, there's a great hole in the wall that serves great food. La Casa della Pasta way off the main thoroughfares. The owner is actually Italian, and it shows in the food.   Something quite unusual to find in the area is good British food. There's this tiny little place out in the boonies that tops ANYTHING that the city has to offer. Not a far drive, but well worth it. The Red Rover has a quaint little bar, and a GREAT fish'n'chips, and wonderful bacon and brie sandwich. On my list for next time I go is banger's n mash. The kitchen is located just outside the place, in a converted double decker bus. It's unconventional, but definitely fun and unique. If you like ciders, I prefer the Excalibur there. HUGE selection of stuff they brew themselves. The milk stout is amazing.   If you'd like to try something in German, then at the other end of the county, you have The Taste of Berlin which is a great place to find German staples. There used to be a better place, but unfortunately, that was years ago and the place is no more.   If you want a great American style breakfast, a little place that is very easy to miss is the Riveria family restaurant. It's tucked back in the tiny corner of the buildings. It's cash only, but have an ATM there. Careful on hours here. not open past lunch.  If you want Mexican, many will say TacoBus, but I've had issues with their food. I'd really recommend TacoSon over them. It's a great little place, and the burritos are HUGE.   Best seafood place is probably Ocean Prime but it's on the more expensive side. GREAT food though. If you want almost as good food on a MUCH smaller budget, then there's a little place on the east side of the county called Willie's    A GREAT local place to check out for alcohol is Gaspar's Grotto. It isn't some mega chain like World of Beer, but they have quite a selection and an excellent atmosphere. Small family owned place that has been around a long time.   Another excellent place is if you can find parking, a pub crawl around the SoHo district provides excellent drinks with some amazing scenery. My friends and I usually start at The Backyard (bottom in the map) and walk our way around to all the places, as it's usually easiest to find parking at. Map MacDinton's is probably the liveliest. Hit it on a Friday or Saturday starting around 8pm and drinking hours close at 3am, if you're still standing. If you had to much then yellow cab is (813) 253-0121 and United is 813-777-7777. Sometimes United will give you a free lift home if you show keys and are drunk. Also, there's always Uber, but some of the Uber drivers won't touch the severely intoxicated around here.   Hopefully that gives you (and maybe some others around here) a few places to try for some great grub.     Addendum, since you asked for areas to avoid..   If you drive a nice car (or rental) or are 'tan or less', you'll probably do best to generally avoid the College Hill area, and not hit many side streets in the Sulfur Springs area. Expand the box for College Hill to just generally encompass the general area between I4 and MLK from 275 to 41. There's other shady areas, but when I used to work for the Medical Examiner, those were the only two places we ALWAYS took police escorts with us. There's some other less than pleasant areas, to downright urban ghettos, but generally, if you mind your own business then you don't get bothered in most of them.   To backup the reasoning behind those two areas specifically... Crime Map, just zoom out so you can see all of the tampa area, hit select all for crimes, then open the density map, enable it, then click calculate.   On the flipside, a 'great' neighborhood to be VERY careful in is Temple Terrace. Gaspar's listed above is in Temple Terrace, and TacoSon is on the edges of it. The main thoroughfares drop from the usual 45mph to 35 and 30mph in some places, and the cops there WILL pull people over for 1mph over the speed limit, AND ticket you. ESPECIALLY if you have out of state plates. Consider it one GIANT speed trap. The ticket's are their primary source of revenue for the city, which technically is entirely separate from Tampa."

If it is happening to you it has prolly happened to them.   In my old neighbor hood I was one of the last to get re-piped.

tampa,3dw7be,djgizmo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:02 2015 UTC,If it is not near an outside wall then the problem is probably a bad seal in the copper hot water piping going to one of your bathrooms.  I had it at my rental place.  I had to have them drill through the concrete to fix it.

If I ever have an issue, they resolve it in no time flat.   As for business banking, I've heard good things about SunTrust from both here now, but also my cousin, too. As for Bank of Tampa, unfortunately their closest branch is in Town 'n' Country, and the business is located in Palm Harbor. I would prefer something a little closer to the business. I'll keep it in mind, though!"

You may certainly bring your own modem however it must be listed on this approved modems list for your tier of service see: http://support.brighthouse.com/article/use-own-modem-with-hsi-service-9109/   - Also if you have our phone service you must provide a modem that is also an MTA otherwise you would still require one from us and thus still have the modem charge apply.   One thing I want you to seriously consider is not purchase on the cheap.   Right now the best overall modem that also keeps you future proof is the Motorola 6183 then couple that with your own HIGH quality router (Asus, Netgear).  If you have any questions by all means reach out to me at BHNtechXpert@mybrighthouse.com or here via the site."

However, I'm not sure about their ability to pick up from the airport, so I'd probably go with hotel shuttle option. The cab company has a flat rate of $25 from the airport to downtown."
tampa,3dmifr,MiaYYZ,2,Fri Jul 17 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"I used Uber at TPA a couple weeks ago and as soon as I got in the car the driver was pulled over. He admitted to being an Uber driver and the cop gave him four tickets, gave me a lecture about safety, and made us wait twenty minutes.   Every other time I've been picked up by Uber at TPA the driver requested that I meet him on the fourth floor of the parking lot, and it's never been a problem."

tampa,3dmifr,elecguts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:53:12 2015 UTC,I think they may be able to drop off at the airport.
tampa,3dmifr,careago_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"The driver I talked to said they pick up and drop off from the airport, but it's also the only place they'll be ticketed for being an uber driver. They try to stay as inconspicuous as possible, hiding the phone running uber, acting like a first name friend and other things."
tampa,3dmifr,rayogata,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"I've done uber to TPA several times, they drop off and pick up. It isn't like LA. Where they're blocked."
tampa,3dmifr,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"I also recommend Uber. I don't know if they're technically supposed to do airport pickups but some drivers do anyway. You should be able to use the company card no problem since you save the payment info in the app, just make sure if you ever use it for personal use to select the correct card."
tampa,3dmifr,chandleya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:42 2015 UTC,I'll be sure to use Uber if I go out on my own at night or the afternoons. Good call since Uber must use credit cards.
tampa,3dmifr,tinybubbles1234,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"I take caps to and from downtown to the airport 4-6 times a month.  25 dollars flat rate, I always tip them 5 bucks, (it is company money anyway) any less would be cheap,  to much more gets red flag by the accountants.  Onoy once did i have a guy who had a hard time with the credit card but he got it done,  He had to use his phone to call the office and have them do it.  I do not worry a lot about different people having my travel credit card information.  It is pretty easy to spot bs charges and get a new card issued fast  (overnighted to the hotel even once in a bind)  I do not know how uber and other gypsy cabs give recipts but for work travel I have to be sure i have the proper paper to get my cash back and OP prolly has the same issues with a company card.  The fact that almost every trip I take is from home downtown to the airport and back might have something to do with my results.  I would think drivers whose credit card stuff does not work right avoid airport fares knowing they are supposed have working stuff and the odds of getting checked or reported are much greater when shuttuling fares back in forth to the airport than they are doing 3 dollar per person flat rate hauls of drunks around soho and ybor and downtown.  Edit to add.  I wrote all that at an airport waiting for my flight home.  I arrived home and hopped in a cab as i do many times.  Wouldnt ya know it.  His credit card stuff failed him.  I tossed my bussiness card and told him to come back some other time when his machine works to collect if he wanted paid.  wohooooo free cab ride!   saved me nothing,  saved the company 30 bucks"

tampa,3dmifr,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:54:43 2015 UTC,"I am just giving the facts as I know them about cabs in tampa from the perspective of someone who uses them a fair bit.  I am sure many sensitive people  (reddit seems to be full of them,  It is is not their fault, I blame their baby boomer/me generation/everyone gets a trophy/helicopter parents) are upset at my use of the term gypsy cab but that is pretty much what uber and others like it are.    Illegal taxicabs, sometimes known as gypsy cabs, are taxicabs and other for-hire vehicles that are not duly licensed or permitted by the jurisdiction in which they operate. Most major cities of the United States and worldwide require taxicab operators to be licensed. However, many unlicensed cabs are in operation"

tampa,3dlvy8,Gandalv,4,Fri Jul 17 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Budget issues constrain many districts in FL, seems to be worse in Pinellas. I'm told Pasco has positions open, it's one of the fastest growing counties in the state.  My niece subbed in Pinellas and private elemantary schools in the area after graduating from BW a while back. She ended up getting full time offers from Hillsborough and Pasco districts after a couple of lean years subbing, is now teaching full time for Hillsborough district in Westchase and has no complaints."

tampa,3diex8,fawker,9,Thu Jul 16 17:34:56 2015 UTC,"I like cons that are fan focused. The whole point of cons initially was going and hanging out with people that had similar interests. The new commercialization of the cons was inevitable since the popularity grew so much, but makes the fan experience kind of shitty. You're there to see stars of your favorite shows or get memorabilia or even dress up as your favorite character. But cons like this overlook that and go for the 'buy stuff' mentality. I know that they need to make money on the convention, but when you compare TBCC to fan focused cons like Metro, there's a HUGE difference in how it's run which translates into how it feels. It seems like people aren't there to celebrate their fandom, they're more there for shopping."
tampa,3diex8,The-Rev,5,Thu Jul 16 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"Last year was the first comic con I have ever been to. Yeah, now that you mention it, it was mainly people with stuff for sale. Didn't seem to be that much ""community events"" going on, at least when I was there.  Props for the dude with 80's vintage gi joes, the tarzan clan twins that color shift in the sun. Wasn't even that much, but that was more or less the extent of my interest in the ""wares""."
tampa,3diex8,fawker,4,Thu Jul 16 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"If you're not too into cons it's not too bad. There's cool stuff but some of the vendors seemed more flea market style than anything else. Of the local cons I really like Metro, that one is run really well and it's more pay one cover and see tons of stuff for a few days where TBCC is pay one cover just to get in and anything else costs extra. MegaCon isn't too bad, it's a decent mix between the commercialism and things for the fans (although they screwed me last year since I was an advertiser for the con so I'm still kind of bitter). There's a bunch of other little cons in the area that are a lot of fun too."

This way, the traffic patterns aren't wholly unfamiliar to you and you've got good ideas of where to park when(not if, WHEN) the convention center usual parking spots are full.   Check the schedules, and know where what you want to do is going on. As mentioned in another post, there's stuff going after the dealer's room/convention floor closes.   Cosplay is totally unnecessary.  Having fun should be your main goal.  Getting lost? The TBCC folks usually have well marked(special t-shirts and lanyards) staff that should be able to help you.  And if you're in line, you're standing next to a slew of people who have a thing they like in common with you, say hi and meet new faces.  I've gone to this con since it was a tiny thing in the Doubletree, and it's usually fairly well run. I've not been to a convention yet that doesn't have some snafus, but the ones for this one have been usually out of their control(parking downtown blows, having people stand outside in August for too long is sucky, fire marshals, etc). The staff, from my POV, have always been friendly.   I can say it has gotten a bit more commercialized over the last couple years.   And that's why I'm going to Fan Boy the week before TBCC."
tampa,3diex8,The-Rev,2,Thu Jul 16 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"That's fair. We're getting dropped off, as it were, so parking isn't too big of an issue and we have a general plan on getting autographs and pictures. Everything else we're sort of going to wing as best we can."
tampa,3diex8,ediblepolygon,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, and I forgot to mention-- last year, the convention staff were rather brusque about food.  My understanding is that this was on the convention center, and not TBCC, but who knows for sure.  The Center staff were not nice about outside food and drink being bought into the center, plus ran out of food on Saturday.  And $10 for a precooked, dry, gross burger is not my idea of good sustenance. They were even a bit rude about us bringing in water for our group, but I think that got resolved."

tampa,3dkeit,tewas,2,Fri Jul 17 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"Er... so I'm not personally against it, but I'm not sure of the legalities.  That would be creating our OWN lottery.  What I mean by a lottery pool would be, say, 10 of us Tampa redditors each throwing $10 into a pool each week and I would go buy X number of Powerball tickets with the cash.  If we won, we'd all split the prize.  Of course, the odds aren't that great, but the more we have in the pool the greater the odds.  And let's be honest, a one hundred million dollar jackpot split ten ways (hell, even a hundred ways) would be WAY more than I'd need to retire."
tampa,3dkeit,tewas,2,Fri Jul 17 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"Let's go back to earth, how do we split that $1 dollar winning that is much more likely? Are you going to post tickets bought so we know how many there are, what numbers are on them? Who's going to do accounting that shows people that $100 been all spent on tickets rather than $90? And last question, let's say we win $10,000 what prevents you from saying ""i don't know those people, why are they bugging me?"" or flat out disappearing forever with the winnings? So we all sign contract that is legally binding so later on we can sue each other in court when that $100M price is won by us?"

tampa,3dkl8t,Cromulus,4,Fri Jul 17 00:54:01 2015 UTC,"We literally did that with those threads in the sidebar. I believe they can still be added to. I think u/mandyleigh was looking into a wiki (don't hold her to that).   People who ask specific questions get answers, normally quite well.  People who ask generic questions also get answers, but the mods helpfully put those answers in one place. The sidebar is a little crowded, so I assume some folks don't see them or maybe they are on mobile. Then some people direct them or link them over.   Seems as efficient as it could be, save having a bot that auto posts a response any time ""moving"" ""move to"" or ""visiting"" are in the post name. (Hey, /u/bigblades - my birthday is coming up. Can I have a bot?)"

The sidebar only helps so much and I completely get if people might wonder what the community has to say. They don't know who wrote the sidebar posts. I visited anchorage last year (look at their sidebar, what the fuck!?) and I felt like an idiot asking if there was a pub run in town ( after googling of course). Of course the community there were super nice and welcoming and answered my questions, and I wondered why r/Tampa is so hostile to visitors and newbies. If you don't feel like answering a moving or visiting question just don't."
tampa,3dkl8t,their_early_work,4,Fri Jul 17 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"Here's the distinction: you asked a specific question. I've never seen r/Tampa be curt, let alone rude, when people ask for distinct pieces of information. ""We are in town for a bachelor party, like the outdoors, dislike strip clubs"" - gets a dozen responses about places to fish and hunt boar and skeet shooting, even though it gets posted six times a year. They participated. They put some basic thought into it.  ""In town for a few days. What do I do with my free time?"" - yeah, you are being too lazy to  Google and asking other people to do that for you.   The compromise: a list of entries, made by the same people who you are asking your questions to, but only made once and hopefully being updated (maybe mods could do a quarterly check for new stuff? Idk?). It's efficient (which redditors seem to love) and its helpfully already created for people putting in the least bit of effort."

I agree some questions are pretty bland, and for that, those users should either be downvoted or ignored. But it's not like the sub is getting clogged up by content. There's like 5 new posts a day, maybe 10 on a busy day. Personally, I'd be skeptical of a sidebar post as an outsider. First, they're not typically up-to-date. Tampa's is right now, and I do think it is currently very useful. But for how long? Second, a visitor doesn't really know any context to those recommendations. Who is posting and who is upvoting certain options? We love our Seminole Heights hipster joints in r/tampa, but how would a visitor have any clue what sort places they are being recommended? The sidebar is super useful, and the mods (or whoever) did a great job, but I can completely understand someone wanting to engage the community for their opinion.    TL;DR - The sidebar is useful and should be kept updated, but I wish the community would represent ourselves with a little less condescension."

tampa,3ddswd,Knox-Overstreet,7,Thu Jul 16 21:42:07 2015 UTC,I had this issue before and I stopped attending after the church sent a notice they wanted ten percent of the household income on a yearly basis. This was a Roman Catholic church too. I am now agnostic due to this and other conflicting doctrine. Giving money should be on a voluntary basis.
tampa,3ddswd,weath1860,2,Wed Jul 15 21:27:21 2015 UTC,"It's tacky to send that out, but 10% is considered a standard tithe to the church.

tampa,3ddswd,Slickrick1688,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"Even without the organization and the monetary scam, established religions are a scam of the mind. If you want to find God, do so through personal endeavors into spirituality. When you get your beliefs from other people's words, you are NOT being a free-willed individual.   The Bible and every other religious text, you must remember, were compiled and edited by humans, not gods. Don't listen to the Bible, listen to the messages it has. It is not a story, it's a lesson. (The same goes for other texts.)  And something else I want to make note of: That 'Christian' church would be damned by Jesus for using the name of God to profit. I'm tired of the habits of American Christians who beleive that going to church and 'converting' people is enough to get you to heaven.  Jesus didn't go around telling people to worship him so that they would be 'saved.' He didn't go around telling people to worship God or that they would burn in Hell. (He did state these things, but my point is that Jesus never went around 'saving' people from their lack of belief.) When Jesus helped people, he did so by actually HELPING THEM. By showing these people the kindness in his heart, he also affected them spiritually. It's a shame more people do not understand this.  Jesus was a good man that people should strive to be like. Unfortunately many of the Christians in America (That I've met, anyways) are hypocritical sheep. They drive luxury cars that cost enough insurance to feed a hungry family, they live in 200k houses that have enough extra room to fit many of the homeless people they drive by daily.... These Christians go home each day and eat as much fatty foods as they want, forgetting about the troubles of the world and everyone else, while they sit and tell themselves they are 'poor' for not being able to afford an even more luxurious life.   The Christian population of America is overly greedy, sloth-like, gluttonous, judgemental and hateful. When they ask themselves 'What Would Jesus Do?' they don't answer 'Spend his entire adult life helping others without the need for payment or worship.'  I'm very much considering starting a church in the New Tampa area. I'd love to take a full congregation out regularly and teach them what Jesus actually did, and that it IS a good idea to follow in his footsteps. Every moment you spend telling people to be afraid of Hell and to change their ways is another moment you waste not being like Him.   Jesus didn't condemn or convert people. Jesus saved people from reality, not Hell.  Just as every Christian who is simply afraid to go to Hell will still end up there for living a selfish and greedy life, any nonbeliever who spends their life doing selfless deeds for others has a place in God's kingdom."

Seriously, though... There is a LOT in my comment that I can understand people disagreeing with. Please explain why you disliked that statement.  I could have worded it in a more clear way, but it should be easy enough to understand: If you don't have the capacity to learn things for yourself, and instead you blindly follow others, you are not being anything other than a mental sheep. If this is true, then the extent of your free-will was to willingly let others dictate your mindset and beliefs. (This is an example. I'm not talking about anyone in particular.)"

Furthermore, I have no real understanding of why or how we know the earth is 4.54 million words, but I blindly follow the people who say it is, because quite frankly, I don't have the time to figure it out. Does that make me a mental sheep?"
tampa,3ddswd,gloystertheoyster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:46:43 2015 UTC,"I think you meant to say that you don't understand why the Earth is 4.54 million years old. That should be billions.  You are not a mental sheep for assuming that the vast majority of the scientific community would be right about something like the age of the earth. There are complicated processes which go into determining that. Spirituality is something entirely different. There's no evidence to determine if your god exists instead of someone else's, or that your notions of good and bad are right.   If the scientific community of the world says the earth is billions of years old, you are not being a mental sheep for taking that as truth without testing it yourself.  If someone comes up to you and tells you that a magical unicorn made the world, and you believe it, THEN you'd be something of a mental sheep. There's a complete difference between putting faith in the general consensus of the world's scientists, and putting faith in unscientific claims that there is zero evidence to support.  Spirituality is a personal experience that you share with god. When you get your spiritual beliefs from another human, you are doing it wrong."

tampa,3ddswd,The-Rev,2,Wed Jul 15 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - The Bible is a compilation of stories edited by man, not God. The Bible serves not as documented history, but rather it's intended purpose of an ethics lesson.  Jesus was a good man. He spent his adult life selflessly helping the poor, sick and hungry. He didn't go around 'converting' or 'saving' people from Hell. Jesus taught by example.  I believe that no matter how Christian someone thinks they are, if they don't regularly and selflessly help others in need then they are going to Hell.   There's more to it, of course. Either read my entire original comment or read through the Bible."

tampa,3de5c1,Red5446,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:09:59 2015 UTC,"Are you looking specifically for D&D, or just Fantasy Roleplaying?   The reason I ask, is because D&D on it's own is kind of generic and broad in scope, so a lot of times you have to get specific with it. There are different campaign settings Forgotten Realms (being the most common), Dragonlance, Ravenloft, Eberron, etc... Many in the wiki just simply aren't up to date or played anymore.   When people typically say ""I play D&D"", the inevitable question to come up based on the age of the person in question is ""What edition?"" There are still groups out there still playing Advanced D&D 2nd Edition which was first published back in 1989.  Don't let any of this bog you down.  What I'd suggest is look for a Pathfinder Society group. Pathfinder is based off of the 3.5 Edition of D&D and Society play is basically a little more structured. It's designed in a way that's sort of like playing an Action RPG computer game. You can bring your character from session to session and generally play with different groups. The people that run these games are very often energetic and welcoming to new players of all types and experiences.   Basically, it's a great way to meet other gamers and get your feet wet, while still playing a Fantasy setting. A lot of times, many of these gamers are also into more broad scope games and self contained campaigns instead of canned adventures."

Israel might be more important to me if I cared enough about the spiritual aspects. I look at Israel was one might look at Africa: Hey, I probably originated from there at some point in time. I was born and raised in the U.S., so that is my nationality.  I am not religious. I don't believe in a god and I don't believe in anything spiritual. I got my (non)beliefs in order when I was around 11 or 12.

If you're just looking for someone to ask a lot of questions to about Judaism, I would suggest visiting one of the few Chabad centers around Tampa. Chabad Rabbis are well known for being some of the friendliest people out there. The Chabad Rabbi and his family at Texas A&M helped me through a lot of things and even helped me get on a trip to Israel. You can usually just walk right in to most Chabad centers and just start chatting folks up. I do believe there are 3 or 4 different Chabads around Tampa and one in Brandon (I think).   I wouldn't go to the USF Hillel first, not because it's bad or anything, but from my experience, a Hillel is a place more devoted to worship than casual conversation and people there might not be quite as receptive. However, if you're looking for a more serious Jewish person to ask about things, a Hillel would probably be a good place to find someone. The Chabad environment is usually lighter and I swear every Chabad Rabbi has a million jokes and tells them every chance they get. That must be one of the courses in Yeshiva or something."

tampa,3ddz2c,the_dude_imbibes,5,Wed Jul 15 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"Please please please do not do something like this. I ask for animal welfare reasons.  In places that call themselves ""sanctuaries"" they have a near constant cycle of breeding in order to make sure there are plenty of babies for photo ops and play time. This means the brood females get little to no break in between litters. They also take them away from their mothers in order to hand rear them so that they are photo op ready as quickly as possible.  They then are exposed to numerous people over the course of the day. This exposes them to a host of possible germs and parasites over the course of the day. They are still young, still susceptible to infections. They are often not even old enough for the vaccines to protect them against the very same diseases a common housecat can get.  Big Cat Sanctuary here in Tampa actually is a pretty good sanctuary. They do not have a focus on breeding but on education and giving the cats the best lives they can have. And yes, that means without human interaction because these are predatory animals that should be treated with respect."

They advertise cheetah cubs but they didn't have any at the time which leads me to believe they were not just breeding them.

tampa,3d9vs1,tiggrr2001,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:31:53 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned trying an independent agent. Definitely do that. We have more options  (typically) than exclusive agents, and can rate you through multiple carriers.   The Florida homoeowners insurance market is unlike just about every other state's market. There's not really a ""best"" carrier. There's the carrier that will offer the best rate for the coverage provided. What carrier will be available will be dependent upon the age and location of the home (amongst other factors, but these two are pretty big determining factors). You're in Brandon, so you're not in a ""high risk"" area. That will help. But if the home is older and hasn't had it's major systems updated (roof, heating and A/C, electrical, and plumbing) then your options are going to be limited.   Simply put, there really isn't any one carrier to go with. USAA, Allstate, State Farm, Nationwide, etc, are all almost certainly not an option. Try an independent agent. Olympus, Universal P&C, Prepared, Security First, American Strategic, and Florida Peninsula are all standard and reputable carriers. Tower Hill is as well, but I've heard they can be hard to qualify for. I would personally avoid PeoplesTrust unless their rate is absolutely outstanding, but be cautious of a low rate because it may be at the sacrifice of adequate coverage. Citizens is........fine of you HAVE to be insured by them for whatever reason, but just know your policy will be subject to a take-out by another carrier for as long as you're with Citizens, and the carrier that takes out your policy can very likely have higher rates than Citizens."

If you live off of Bearss, you are better off hopping over to Fletcher to get on the highway, bearrs gets backed up very bad at the south bound exit of 275 thanks to all the people from 41.

Early 20s shouldn't be an issue since most of the older folks are immature AF (myself included). It's still a fun way to meet new people, have good conversation, and make fun of bad cover bands ;)"

There is a great Yelp community here in Tampa with a couple of events every month, so you end up getting to try new places for free and meet new people.

tampa,3d6jy3,varukasalt,0,Tue Jul 14 09:34:29 2015 UTC,"I'm with you and it's ridiculous to be down voted for expressing an opinion like that.  It's your choice what you put in your body and what does it matter as long as you aren't being preachy about it.

Or are you, for some strange reason, under the impression that all grains are genetically modified?   EDIT* I really am confused. If you didn't know, grains are one of the easiest and cheapest things to find that haven't been modified."
tampa,3d6jy3,IAmSecretCow,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:35 2015 UTC,"Corn and wheat, for a simple example, are not naturally occurring grains."
tampa,3d6jy3,Endless_Summer,3,Tue Jul 14 20:36:08 2015 UTC,"Selective breeding and genetic engineering are two completely different things. GMOs are not created through breeding, they are created through introduction of foreign elements to the existing DNA of a living organism.  With selective breeding you are mixing and maxing, attempting to push evolution in one way or the other. With genetic engineering you are adding to and attempting to re-purpose the basic structure of DNA.  It's simple if it's corn. (By the way, non-GMO grains of all types are available everywhere.) Imagine if livestock was genetically modified to the same extent as plants. (Not just fat/growth/milk/etc) We could have cows that would be able to breath and bathe in poison 24/7 without looking sick or dying. Would you want to eat them?  I won't get anymore preachy than I already am to the others reading this comment. This was only meant as a reply to you, Endless_Summer.   tl;dr - GMOs and 'Selectively Bred' species are different (Look these terms up if you need to.) GMOs are bad, blah blah blah"

The meat is frozen, but still good quality.  The ground beef its meh though.    I haven't worked at Moes for 6 years though so stuff could have changed i guess but from what I have seen, the quality actually looks better.  I'm a T Flats and Taco bus fan myself though."

tampa,3d6jy3,NatasEvoli,0,Tue Jul 14 09:25:32 2015 UTC,What you need is some Qdoba. Free everything on your burrito and better ingredients than Moes and Chipotle

Otherwise I'd say Lettuce Lake Park is always fun to shoot at, it's a long boardwalk over a river with plenty of wildlife and scenery out of True Detective season 1. It also has a 30ish foot tall tower to look over the water which is great for getting the wildlife if you have a telephoto lens."

tampa,3d6rst,droidpoo,5,Tue Jul 14 11:30:24 2015 UTC,A service animal doesn't even need a vest to be legally permitted into an establishment. And in training animals have the exact same rights in FL as fully trained service animals. The vest is a courtesy an helps the trainer keep people from approaching their dog. That's all. I'm not intentionally perpetuating a fraudulence problem.
tampa,3d6rst,droidpoo,-5,Tue Jul 14 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"Sure.... Cause I bet you had it for the same reason. If you truly had a service dog, you would not be selling a vest to anyone on moral grounds."

tampa,3d256o,IndubitablySarah,6,Mon Jul 13 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"I would take with a grain of salt all the recommendations that you receive here btw. My wife is a surgeon and almost all the time what patients think of her, or her fellow surgeons, has nothing to do with their skills as a surgeons. It is nearly all about how they treat you as a patient, not about their outcomes - which with a surgeon should generally be the only thing you are interested in. There are some terrible surgeons, with far worse than average outcomes, that patients love, or that even OTHER surgeons would recommend, working at top institutions - it is truly a strange field.  What you want to do is to find the surgeon that does more of these operations than anyone else, and does them regularly. Unfortunately this data is hard to come by, ask your surgeon (believe it or not some surgeons will exaggerate their numbers, not always intentionally), but also check against the medicare claims data that was released in 2014 and 2015, it is currently the most objective way to figure this out. Figure out what the billing codes are for your operation (harder said than done sometimes) and look for the surgeons that do the most of them, maybe here, or directly look up the name of your surgeon and see how many operations they are billing here https://data.cms.gov/use-agreement/data-limitations/provider-explorer. This doesn't take into account private insurance, but medicare is a large chunk of billing for almost all doctors so it is usually a good measure."
tampa,3d256o,conorh,2,Mon Jul 13 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this post. I had a major surgery recently... I HATE my surgeon. He doesnt tell me anything unless i ask, and he doesnt sugar coat anything. Talking to him isnt the most pleasant thing.  But his patient outcomes are the best out of anyone. He performs the same surgery hundreds of times every year. He performs something like 1500 surgeries a year.   If i had to trust anyone it would be that doctor. I just have to remember all the things i want to ask him about and let him do his work.  I may not like him, but hes the best surgeon for my injury and i trust him more than anyone.  My friend had a similar surgery with the same doctor and he hates him too, but he doesnt think about outcomes. He just thought he was a bad doctor and tried telling me to pick a different surgeon.  Im glad i picked him. I recovered very quickly and started feeling back to normal within 2 or 3 months following the surgery."

I read online to just start with little drones to get the feel for it. I've done that and now I think I'm ready to get a larger drone with a camera on. What's a good entry level camera drone?
tampa,3cyuh7,thethinktank,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:57:58 2015 UTC,Welcome to the club. The advice on starting small is good advice. The good news is even with a small budget you can obtain some pretty nice hardware.    At $300-$600 I would start with a phantom 2. If you watch craigslist you can pick  one up for cheap from time to time.   If you're willing to spend a grand the Phantom 3 is a great way to go as well. But... The new 3DR Solo drone is coming out soon and it has a ton of tools for video and film. You’re limited to using go-pro with the 3DR but the Hero4 takes video slightly better than the drone I shot this with. Don’t forget to tack on another $300-$500 for the GoPro itself.   The biggest issue by far is the “Crash-and-Fix” factor. You’re going to crash. It's just part of learning. Making sure you don’t hurt people (or property) is big but so is knowing how to fix your own stuff. Don’t run out and spend 2 or 3 thousand until you’ve broke a $400 drone and fixed it.   I’m looking at putting on a free workshop in the next few weeks. Check out the website in the video from time to time once we find a venue to host it at.

Simply a bill stating that MJ be regulated in the same manner as tobacco and alcohol, hell why not like aspirin or any other OTC drugs?    Medical is still on the table along with full legal, just like alcohol.  We use alcohol for both medical and recreational purposes, right?  Marijuana should be treated the same.       The reason ANY state shouldn't have to go through the same process as those that have fully legalized is because the after effects are plainly obvious-more money in taxes and little to no effect on crime.  Like I said, medical still gives the justice system a reason to lock people up, and that's the main issue, to me.    ""Crime"" being the number one argument from anti-pot people as why not to legalize.  Portugal legalized over 10-12 years ago, so I'd image statistics regarding MJ would be more accurate indicators as what effect it has on a wider level."

tampa,3cxmbx,pelvisresley,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:05:06 2015 UTC,"Most ""plans"" to change laws in America are slight variations on ""knock on doors, get the vote out, and contact representatives"".  Asking what the plan is is fairly useless since most plans involve a legislative body and referendums.  You can go ahead and give me millions of dollars and I'll enact my plans to the best of my ability, but otherwise it's a question with an obvious answer.  3/5ths of the state already voted for MM.  Most debates are centered around regulation nonsense fears about adolescent use.  And yes, anyone can write a law and have it passed through a legislative body-the Senate I believe."
tampa,3cxmbx,nrjk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"3/5ths of the state already voted for MM.   False. If this were true, then we would have medical cannabis already. A 60% vote is required for a ballot measure to pass in Florida.  Your pipe dream sounds great and all, but it's quite clear by now that you haven't really thought this through. If you haven't realized this yet, then I'm sorry, there is nothing else I can do. In the meantime, let's just try not to call medical cannabis ""nonsense"" and cast it in a negative light. It's not nonsense. Medical cannabis makes complete sense. It is a real medicine that helps real people with real illnesses. Thank you."
tampa,3cxmbx,pelvisresley,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"57% voted for it.  My bad, bro.  Medical cannabis only solves one tiny facet of a much broader problem.  Guess what, there already IS medical cannabis, like, everywhere.  It's called ""texting my guy and meeting somewhere"".  The problem is not access to marijuana-the problem is the negative social impacts and money wasted prosecuting otherwise innocent people. Medical cannabis (the movement), in this regard, is short sighted-it's like having four bad tires but only replacing two at a time-taking two trips to the tire place is a waste of time. It's just like having two separate movements (med. vs. leg.) is self-defeating and slows progress overall.        I don't think medical cannabis in itself is nonsense, but rather the rhetoric being used to push medical only.  It's like we have to lie to ourselves and pretend it's NOT a stepping stone to legalization.  All people in favor of full legalization, whether they like it or not, support medical.  The fact that the converse is not true shows it is a smaller, more inferior, idea.  Tl;dr: fuck baby steps."

They used to (and I assume still do) have a few trails for bikes only but if you go on weekday you can walk them because almost nobody is using them,   they have lots of walking or horse trails that you can walk that bikes are not supposed to use.  Hillsbourogh river state park has quite a few trails to walk also and one for bikes that even when the park is crowded not many people venture down the trails, they tend to stay in the picnic area or the pool area.  You can also rent kayaks there or a place or two near there for a trip down the river.   If you take the trail towards the suspension bridge.......go across.....there is a nice loop trail that i recall is about 3-4 miles that loops out to the primitive camp sites and back,   I think it intersects the florida trail also.  Ed medard park is not as large but there is enough room to spread out.

tampa,3csky1,demcatsdoe,2,Sat Jul 11 12:59:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for the kind words!!  This was shot from a full frame Canon 6D on a 17-40mm wide angle lens. To be able to produce images like this is more about the computer then the camera. Its a powerful balance between photographer the camera and the computer. This would be very difficult to produce with a point and shoot due to the extended exposure times.   This is a 3 shot composite that was chosen from a 7 shot bracket at 1 ev apart. I used the +3 for the buildings street and most of the foreground. I used the -3 & -1 to tame the glow down on all the street lights and building signs. I also used the -1 to darken the sky a bit. I have been trying to get away from using merge software like photomatix as I have found digital blending produces a much more pleasing result. All images were shot a 100 ISO at f/11 the exposure times for the bracket were 1.3s 2.5s 5.0s 10s 20s 40s 80s
tampa,3csky1,MRRoberts,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:06:47 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to the view about 50 feet to the right.

tampa,3csky1,MRRoberts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I never understood why photographers choose TGH over that garage, as the skyline opens up in the perfect way to that spot.

tampa,3cuk7x,BHNtechXpert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"Well biggest issue I had to deal with was digital signal issues.  Between aging copper,  amount of houses on nodes causing unstable bandwidth. Basically outside of customer caused problems majority of calls were digital service issues from weak signal from coax issues and Internet bandwidth changing due to number of subscribers on a node.  With my fios I 100% of the time get exactly what I pay for but I hate their customer service. Where with a copper based service (bright house)  I'll be paying for speeds ""up to""  and that's the main part that makes me hesitate. I really hate the fios support but I have never had to call in due to slow speeds or outage.    Tldr -  what as changed about the digital infrastructure side of the network in the last decade to deal with fluctuating bandwidth and digital signal."
tampa,3cuk7x,morebacons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna answer as best I can but first I want to frame your perspective as a support rep for another MSO.   Remember, as a support rep your job was to address customer problems.  All day all you see are problems,  you don't hear from the customers without an issue because they don't call to say how wonderful you are...most people are just too busy for that.  That limits your perspective on the issues greatly.  More than likely you were not in a position to know the real data from the standpoint of issues to customers.   The failure rate considering the complexity of the technology is generally amazingly low.   It doesn't feel like that however when you are on the phones getting hammered by issue after issue.  You think Fios support reps don't feel the same pain and come to the same conclusions at times?   Don't bet on it because they do, just in a slightly different way because of the technology differences and trust me they also have the same opinion of the product by the end of the day.  Unless you have the other part of the equation it's only natural to make that assumption.  Most cable plants are fiber to the last mile or less which greatly reduces the concerns you are talking about.   In a properly maintained plant these are not big problems,  the majority of issues are at the premise as you already know.  As your provider we are respsonsible for those as well and repair them at no cost even if we have to rewire a house or pull a new drop so that's not really an issue.  As for the long spewed telco spin on ""congestion and shared network"" garbage let me enlighten you a bit... all networks are shared lol...even Fios I don't care what they claim.  As for the ""Up to"" language in the agreement that is in every agreement for every MSO on the planet because it has to be and that includes Fios. It doesn't mean that your service is gonna suck, it just keeps the legal guys happy.   In a properly maintained network service groups are constantly monitored to ensure the shared environment you are concerned about never reaches a level of utilzation where there is customer impact.  Eventually utilization does reach a level where we may need to do some housekeeping and split a particular group obviously the purpose being to ensure that the speeds you subscribe to are indeed what you get.  This is done automatically,  you don't need to do anything nor do you need to worry about it.  Look... my suggestion is you give it a try,  there is no obligation, we have no contracts nor does Fios unless you want their teaser rate.  This means you can go back no harm, no foul if you hate it.  Hell run them side by side for a month.  Obviously there are some differences in our speed tiers so before you make the switch make sure we can meet your expectations in advance."
tampa,3cuk7x,BHNtechXpert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:48:18 2015 UTC,Does bright house offer any incentive to switch from fios such as assisting with fios etf? This is true about being on the support end only seeing the bad.  When I was a cable customer back home I did see speeds fluctuate quite frequently but that was about 6 years ago.  Fiber to the house does atleast remove the copper being a possible bottle neck and I can 100% say other than Verizon being dicks and throttling Netflix cpl years back to get them to pay it is consistent.  I hate their reps tho (very poorly trained)  and just was curious what has changed in the recent years to address the ever growing speeds and the infrastructure.  But seriously considering switching and my fios contract is really the only thing holding me back.  When I had to tell my fios rep to check provisioning on my router and she didn't know what that was I decided time to split
tampa,3cuk7x,BHNtechXpert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:46:31 2015 UTC,Long ago we would buy folks out of their contracts however that has been gone for quite some time.   There are certainly new customer promotions however they apply to anyone new not just Fios customers.
tampa,3cuk7x,BHNtechXpert,0,Mon Jul 20 13:11:07 2015 UTC,Dave I have never received an email request from you and you had other options for contact including here which as you can see I respond to fairly quickly.   You also had our direct forums which receive 100% responses in 40 minutes or less every day of the year which you did not use.  Out of concern that your email somehow was caught by spam filter I modified the above post because I definitely don't want that happening.
tampa,3cuk7x,quantumized,0,Sat Jul 11 11:31:22 2015 UTC,"LOL - Dave nobody is doubting that you sent it... I didn't get it based on what I have which is your name.  I keep all customer emails and I searched all the way back to Jan 1 looking for your name and could not find it.  There is no ""burn"" I was simply stating the facts as I know them.  I even checked my gmail for BHNtechXpert thinking it might have went there instead...but nothing.  I'm truly sorry I missed your email if that was the case....certainly a rare moment.   Not quite sure why you're pressing here...nobody said you did anything wrong...in fact I took the extra step by amending my original reply to this OP to ensure it doesn't happen again...whatever it is that happened."
tampa,3cuk7x,Kujataa,2,Sat Jul 11 14:07:34 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm in the Clearwater/Largo area and am not experiencing any issues. I see a lot of posts about crappy service and support but I just wanted to chime in the I have not experienced any problems with them (other than perhaps being priced high).   I did have some problems a while ago but they sent techs out the next day and actually put in a new line from my modem/router to the drop and also replaced my router. No problems since. In fact, I always show more on both my d/l and u/l speeds than what my service states."
tampa,3cuk7x,Ejb813,2,Sat Jul 11 19:16:57 2015 UTC,How come so many people have problems with Brighthouse?  I haven't had any problems with them since I finally got a decent modem from them.  Customer service has always been great and never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for them to answer.  Only complaint I have for them is to stop raising the prices but every company does I guess.
tampa,3cuk7x,droidpoo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"IMO Bright House is one of the best. I've lived in 3 states and now Japan.

tampa,3cuk7x,BHNtechXpert,0,Sat Jul 11 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"Just do a search on this subreddit for brighthouse, you will see a trend and it's not hard to see that the service always sucks/not works, then some tool from the company that is spying on reddit users chimes in and claims they can solve the unsolvable problems. Then 3 weeks later another person posts about it again."
tampa,3cuk7x,droidpoo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"Really poo?   Again?  First you post about an issue as if it were yours on someone elses thread, when I reached out genuinely trying to help you that morphed into it was your parents not you that you were posting about,  when I said look give them my contact information I truly want to help them you declined again letting them fend for themselves. Someone with a real service issue posting here or in other forums (yes reddit is a form of forums) normally wants to get it fixed above all else, not bash the guy who's making the effort to reach out and resolve the concern in the first place."

I'm still leaving bright house soon anyway. $150 for what I get is laughable to be honest, and I just got a notice that it's going to increase as my promo offer is over (mind you i've been a customer for 20+ years) so i'm not sure what promo i got automatically signed up for.   I appreciate you trying to help, but it seems like I called BH almost every month to complain about something as it's always going out. It's time to try something new."

Edit because i forgot something.............pro tip at the airport,  on the roof you can see the gates where the planes are loaded and unloaded.  If you see people moving around and loading and unloading and driving the little cars you can assume all is somewhat safe.  If you look around and they are all gone it is a safe assumption they shut down the flight line because the risk of lightning strike is high and you may want to use that as hint it is time to be in your car."

If you are near something that is struck it CAN jump to you.   Be careful out there if you are watching a storm. It's beautiful but also deadly.  If you feel static/tingly or smell something ""off"" at ANY time - hit the fucking deck. Might be too late, but it's your best chance.  Also, you're much less likely to be struck inside a car if you do venture to a garage roof.  Source: half-ass remembering a class on storm-chasing taught by a TV meteorologist in college.

tampa,3cpf88,gaarasgourd,6,Thu Jul 9 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yep I've been several times.  During the day it's mostly just nudists and swingers, limited sexual activity (they frown upon it during the day) but you will see people getting rowdy. Good age range of people depending on the party that is happening that weekend.  Some weekends it'll mostly be the older residents hanging out and some weekends you'll see a ton of people in their 20's and 30's.  (I recommend going to the upcoming Tattoo Fest at the end of the month, should be a great turnout.) The fees vary every weekend and are also based on the time you show up.   The entrance fee gives you access to the resort for the day. They have several heated pools and a hot tub area.  You don't really get any perks other than access to the afterparty if you have a wristband from the host of whoever is hosting the swinger party that night (the afterparty house usually opens up at midnight or 1AM.... I honestly wouldn't recommend going to it. Seems to be the older crowd at those.) It feels like a nice resort outside. Everyone is really friendly and respectful.   When the sun goes down the swingers come out and there is a lot of sexual activity going on in the conversation pool area. Most of the regular nudists pack up and leave after the sun sets. Saturday night is their busiest night of the week.   Bring your own towels, sunscreen, hats, and a thermos or something (they do have an ice/water machine out by the tiki hut so you can serve yourself during the day). Most pools you're required to be naked in but some weekends they have swimsuit optional parties where you can leave it on if you want.   Happy to answer more questions if you have any."
tampa,3cpf88,magnoliafly,2,Thu Jul 9 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"Is the resort gay friendly? If so, are there gay people there often?  I plan on going with my friend and we're both gay, but were also both single, so it'd be nice if we could both find someone to talk to."
tampa,3cpf88,magnoliafly,3,Thu Jul 9 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely gay/bi friendly. Obviously won't be as common as the straight folks but there are LOTS of bi guys and girls there (I'm a bi girl, often go with bi couples and singles to hang out during the day). Everyone is pretty friendly and open to chatting with new people and definitely get chattier as the day goes on. I've met some fun people there and they come from all over."

tampa,3cr3rb,Dogmom22,7,Fri Jul 10 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I really hate to say this, but I think you should prepare for the worst. There's really only one place that can offer any help in this situation, and that's Hillsborough Animal Services. By that, I mean euthanasia is something you should seriously consider.  Shelters, rescue groups and foster families are always at or near capacity, and they don't make room for dogs with bite histories and increasing aggression issues. There are so many dogs without these issues that don't get help because of the sheer number of unclaimed animals.  Exhaust every resource you can, but you may want to consider that the most humane option is euthanasia. Not just for the dog, but for those who might be harmed by it.  I'm so sorry for your situation, hopefully something works itself out. If not, you may want to consider this option: http://www.hillsboroughcounty.org/index.aspx?NID=3526"
tampa,3cr3rb,thethinktank,2,Fri Jul 10 04:43:17 2015 UTC,The dog shouldn't be put down because he bit someone while the person  was kicking them. What OP thinks is an aggression issue may just be a people selective or health problem. Dogs can be rehabilitated and it sounds like this dog needs to be put in a boarding training position. Euthanasia and animal services is never the best option.
tampa,3cr3rb,Dogmom22,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:31:27 2015 UTC,Who is going to pay for boarding and/or training? Note the context of OP's employment.
tampa,3cr3rb,thethinktank,-1,Sat Jul 11 07:22:20 2015 UTC,"It's easy to ask rescues to help out, go fund me and some trainers will volunteer their time. A 5 day board and package through courteous canine is $420, 7 days is $550, private (non boarding lessons) are $60. You can also take private training lessons for a week at canine cabana are about $250.it's not hard to scrounge up money if you really care about your dog like op seems too. OP if you read this I'll personally donate $100 if you can guarantee it goes to the dogs training."

tampa,3cr3rb,Dogmom22,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"You came here to start an argument, completely ignoring the context of OP's problem. I'm suggesting the owner prepare for precisely what the HSCPA would suggest provided no other options arise. There's not a single thing wrong with that.  The issue has never been just about the dog, it's about available resources -- which OP is severely lacking. So yes, you've put yourself on a high horse talking about principles and euthanasia, which has added absolutely nothing to this thread but an argument."

There are currently 49 people on the list and the next person that will be able to rent their condo was put on the list on 12/29/2011.  Don't expect to be able to rent it anytime soon!

tampa,3cmvev,LHHFMF,3,Thu Jul 9 15:36:24 2015 UTC,"It's not worth the risk to chance it.  If they do find out you'll get fined then have a tenant to deal with who will need to move out. They could sue you, refuse to leave...who knows.  Change of cars on the parking forms, signing the elevator for move in/moves out, concierge getting packages under a new name or a resident who is trying to lease their place out properly finds out could report it out of spite.  There are numerous ways it could get flagged."

tampa,3cmvev,tinybubbles1234,2,Thu Jul 9 19:45:49 2015 UTC,"If you own the condo you prolly also know that a building that restricts the number of rental units helps keep the property values up.  I would bet the rules are wrote so that most anyone who reads them and knows what the consequences of getting caught are would not try it.  I like the idea of a list to wait to rent,  I would hope there is some limit to the amount of years one person can rent a unit out so the list is not basicly frozen.  Say two years and back to the bottom the list?   It seems that list has not moved since 2011 so i assume they do not do something like that."
tampa,3cmvev,mandyleigh,3,Thu Jul 9 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"The train still goes through downtown, it's supposed to be a quiet zone 'soon'. It really depends on the side of the building you're on, and how high up you are. If you're on the side facing Zack St (south?) and above the 10th floor, it won't be a big issue. I rarely notice it, and it doesn't wake me up at night."

tampa,3cmvev,mr_rob_oto,2,Thu Jul 9 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"Internet at Element was upgraded significantly well over a year ago. Now getting solid 80-90mbps off-peak hours and a bit less in the evenings. Don't know about Skypoint but they use the same provider and IT company so it's very likely the speeds are similar there now.  Yes, the train still comes through all night blasting the horn but the plan to install the gates downtown and make it a ""quiet zone"" has been approved and will happen eventually, but at the speed of government.  You can rent out your condo, but there are limits on how many units in total can be rented at any time. IIRC right now there is a waiting list to be able to rent."
tampa,3cmvev,mr_rob_oto,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"I have owned in Skypoint since 2007.  Most people have answered your questions, but I would like to add:     My internet is blazing fast most of the time http://www.speedtest.net/result/4495779869.png  You have the ability to install Fios as well if you want it.  However your condo association fees include the DirecPath internet so you would basically be paying for 2 internets.  The train is still loud.  Every once and a while its annoying but it doesn't effect quality of life.  Long term they are turning downtown tampa into a quiet zone and there will be no more horns but that could take a year or two.   Its near impossible to rent out your condo.  I'm not sure the penalties if they catch you for renting illegally, but at least one would be denying the renter access to the club room/ pool / amenities and I'm sure that would be grounds for breaking the lease.   Don't live below the weight rooms.  Be wary of the 8th floor basically. I had someone I knew who lived low to the ground on Ashley and said the ambulances drove him crazy.   Water is included in the HOA fee so flush to your hearts content.       EDIT:  When looking at a unit also ask these questions a.  When was the last time the PRV (pressure relief valve) was replaced?  We are required to replace these every 4 years or something.  Only a few hundred dollars.    b.  What year was the water heater installed?  The condo was built in 2007 so many of the original water heaters are nearing end of life and need to be replaced."

Up by the pavilions on the dog park side of Picnic Island has a large open field.  Although its kinda close to MacDill and Davis Island Airport but nothing I have copter wise can go that far."

tampa,3ci9dw,bencalpink,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:00:24 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion but if I were you I would be overly cautious and not actually go into the river. I too see gators in there at least once a week and have seen enough big ones to be wary. Picking up floating driftwood in a canoe would be fine though, obviously. Have you looked up fish tank driftwood online? You pay a premium but there are a lot of pretty pieces you can have shipped to you already soaked and boiled. While boiling them makes it safe for the fish, soaking the pieces (some people do it for months) also gets rid of the tannins that can discolor your tank."

There was one float that was dedicated, according to the flyer that was handed out (a religious group), to making boys and girls dress more appropriately. The float had a bunch of bows and girls square dancing. In the blistering heat.  There were politician after politician handing out flyers. It was essentially a parade of Republican city council hopefuls. One elderly man came up to us and said ""vote for my daughter! She's going to be a judge some day. You know, I was a state judge, you may remember me! Nope, never run off the bench for corruption. though they should have a few times!"" Big, shit eating grin on his face the whole time.

And also because I don't really like parades in general! I'm not the target audience.  Regardless, to me, a parade that is heavy on politicians handing out stuff feels like pandering grift, particularly when the messaging was very much not in my general political persuasion. Give me social drinking clubs and shiners in go karts, leave the messaging behind.   Of course, last year (my most recent trip, and thus the freshest memory) as also probably particularly bad. It was an election year, with several controversial issues at play including pot. But I did find it troublesome when ""No2Pot"" voting signs and buttons were on virtually every float, including the children's theater and the judges' cars. Pandering I get, but that sweeping conformist message felt beyond slimy, and certainly wasn't necessary or relevant to every participant.  I think that's why I appreciate this float so much- the context feels much less tolerant to me, and therefore more thrilling.  FWIW,"

tampa,3cgm2m,droidpoo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:38:45 2015 UTC,Personally I think Florida should legalize marijuana. Why do people have a problem with this? Florida should model after Colorado and make it legal to use marijuana but you must do it in private so that people who don't want to be around it will not have to be around the smoke.  It will boost the state's budget by millions from tax revenue.

How did you get started?"
tampa,3chyzt,Rellikx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it super nice but it gets the job done well.   Here's a pic I snapped yesterday the desk is a mess but you get the idea.  http://i.imgur.com/a8ECudL.jpg  1 of the displays is a 27 inch, the display to the left is a 24 inch rotated vertically to make readings easier on certain things.   The docking station is a Dell ultra book.  All gear that you see there is company provided with the exception of the keyboard and mice combo.    I have a usb switch so i switch between my home PC( to the right) in fact the cable you see dangling was me using that usb camera on the personal pc temporarily, but typically I keep the usb camera plugged in the docking station for work meetings and such.  As far as how did I get started, man its a long story.  But the tl;dr is it all depends on your employer and of course the type of work you do.  Technically if you do not need to have physical access to the devices and 100% of the work you perform is over ssh/rdp, there is no reason why you should not perform the job remotely, but you know how some employers are, it's all about the appearances and the impression that there are bodies in the office even though noone talks to another all day except in meetings which is what I find silly.    The long story is  that's how I ended up in Texas to begin with.  I was newly into the field with around 2 years of experience so I didn't have the option to land a long term gig so I submitted my resume and a company from Texas interviewed me and offered me to relocate that's how I ended up in TX in 2007.   That company has grown significantly in size since I've started, and with this growth so is the need for qualified candidates, problem is that not a lot of people are willing to move to South TX, so in the past 2 years they have beefed up their corporate infrastructure to allow for a more robust/reliable network to support a remote workforce and that's how I ended up.  That being said I wasn't always remote but I guess with the experience I have in hand now it allows for that flexibility.     Which field in IT are you on now ? Systems/Network ? Ops ? Eng/Dev ?"

I will admit I enjoy it now and again but they are on my personal boycott/sold out list because they stopped serving menudo.

Ft.Desoto 5.00 entry fee per car check online for the ferry as different times (wk days vs wkends) show up early.  On the return spend the remainder of the day visiting the area just north and south of the fort on foot and you will find/see great things.   Great park rangers patrol that property and will offer many educational tips and info if you just strike up a convo with them.  As for seeing dolphins, you will see them on the south side of the fort btwn there and Egmont.  They come very close to the shore in that shipping channel.  No need to spend the extra on the marked up tradewinds trip unless you don't have transportation to the fort.  Edit: as msghoulie says ft desoto is fine.  Unless you really want a short boat ride you will see the same wildlife and shells etc on just plain ol Ft.Desoto and save the 65.00 or 200.00 on the boat trip for 5."

For the convenience of having it delivered to your door it's pretty cool. That said, be careful what you order. Some of the items are high in sodium so keep an eye if you are watching what you eat. Also, some of the single meal kits can get kind of pricey. Overall though, it can be slightly more than McDonald's price, for close to Boston Market/Olive Garden quality.

tampa,3c93sk,Ryguy8954,3,Mon Jul 6 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"learn a skill and find a job... without addressing the reason they're out on the street.   There are very few homeless charities that deal with mental illness. Unfortunately that and substance abuse are the two most common reasons for homelessness. It's admirable that you want to help, with that said Metropolitan Ministries is pretty good (although a lot of scum bags take advantage of the help). If you want to branch out a bit from homeless the main ones in the area I work with are Crisis Center of Tampa (helping women in need), Tampa Humane Society, The USO, and National MS Society mid Florida region. Good luck dude."
tampa,3c93sk,The-Rev,3,Mon Jul 6 10:54:21 2015 UTC,"I'd also chime in in support specifically of The Crisis Center - Great people, hard work, and direct impact on people's lives in this area."
tampa,3c93sk,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,2,Mon Jul 6 12:45:40 2015 UTC,"Consider reaching out to one of the food banks. Cash, and particularly regular or semi-regular cash is extraordinarily helpful.  Honestly, if you want direct investment and direct connection to the needy communities, the food bank is where it's at. And, most people give random allotments of extraneous food, leaving crucial stocks and stores under stocked. By giving the bank the ability to purchase what they need to provide to their charges, you're actually giving them slightly more than just giving a can of food.   Plus, there's nothing more profound than saying you helped provide meals for people- actual, direct, hand to mouth meals."

tampa,3c77x3,imforserious,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"It is unjust because it is installed not for safety but for revenue.

The whole thing is a big money making ploy that only increases traffic accidents."
tampa,3c77x3,AltoidStrong,2,Tue Jul 14 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"The third notice it becomes a moving violation and therefore you CAN fight it.  However - the the cost to fight it is usually the same or more as the ticket plus the chance to lose. In which case you then incur both the cost of the ticket, court, and points on your license.   A simple risk analysis would conclude just pay it...  realize it is a racket set up as a collaboration by your state / local government and some private company as a for profit system. Fight it on that basis in court with a large group of your community.  Those are the cities / counties / state that have won and had these systems completely removed."

tampa,3c444j,1LuckySOB,3,Mon Jul 6 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"Urban pioneers is a term used to describe those working class people that are migrating back to the urban core of large cities, trying to ""take it back"" from the low income residents. Neighborhoods work in a cycle. Picture any large city as a bullseye. The center is the downtown/business district. As you move further out from center, quality of life and quality of neighborhoods improves. Those that can afford to, move further away from the central core, where residences are more spread out. As the lower income population pushes outward, middle and upper class do the same, to get away.  Eventually you'll get a resurgence of ""urban pioneers"" that come back to those central districts to revamp the neighborhoods, and take them back from the element that is there.   Tampa is going through that process now. The new buildings on the north side of downtown, used to be gov't housing. N Blvd homes (north of 275 along the river) is going to be demolished to make room and entice millennials back into the area.  There is a growing movement to ""take back the city"", get middle class families living in the urban core, and push the low/no income population out into Hillsborough County.  It just amazes me when people move into an area like Nebraska / Osborne, and expect it to be as civil, safe, and quiet as Wesley Chapel. That's impossible"

Also, do not shy away from significant editing. Drunk History uses interviews that span anywhere from 45 mins to 2 hrs in some cases, edited down to the spine of the story and the few really great drunk gags (often literal gags), cut down into a 10-12 minute segment. It works because it is ""clean,"" not only just because it is purely drunkards."

My co-host has a recording industry degree and we have decent selection of pro-audio gear at our disposal between us, including a new Shure SM7B that I'm excited to hear in production.   You're totally right that 15 minutes of awesome can take a couple hours of ""m'eh"" to extract from... That's truly the hard part of making something listenable and enjoyable.

tampa,3c0p0i,GarageBattle,12,Fri Jul 3 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion (and why I voted for temporarily making r/Tampa private) is that it serves as a reminder that reddit is only as strong as it's userbase. Reddit, and especially r/Tampa is not made of articles, links, and countless ""moving to Tampa"" posts, it's because of our community and the people behind the comments that this website is successful. It seems like the admins have forgotten that 'little' fact, and we wanted to state publicly that we did not."
tampa,3c0p0i,utumno86,6,Fri Jul 3 18:55:22 2015 UTC,agreed 100%
tampa,3c0p0i,Aspencer8111,4,Fri Jul 3 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"As a fairly casual reddit user (with, granted, a great deal of investment in the the /r/Tampa community) I was blissfully unaware of all the problems mods have been having with Admins. That said, I have no trouble believing that the people at the top of reddit are massive assholes that needed to be sent a message. I'm sure our mods made  the correct choice."
tampa,3c0p0i,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,3,Fri Jul 3 21:15:30 2015 UTC,Perfectly stated. Reddit needed that warning and really need to understand that if they keep this shit up we will take our business (traffic) elsewhere.
tampa,3c0p0i,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,6,Fri Jul 3 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Cheers. Thank for the comment. I, too, in general support meaningful protest in solidarity, but it is complex. I actually think any sub has a meaningful voice, but deeply community-oriented subs are among the most important facets of Reddit. Meetup days and in-person events as well as trades or gift exchanges, etc, are what transform Reddit from an aggregation site into an actual community.   So when even smaller subs like /r/Tampa voice solidarity, it can be very important. I hope there's some kind of central message you all sent up the chain to that effect.  Quick question about transparency, though- I wasn't here in the hours before /r/tampa went dark. I'm interested to know if there was a discussion, or vote, or mod-vote, etc?"
tampa,3c0p0i,TheCenterOfEnnui,3,Fri Jul 3 19:56:51 2015 UTC,The mods discussed and decided on this on our own last night.
tampa,3c0p0i,Rearviewmirror,5,Fri Jul 3 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Fwiw, I do support it."
tampa,3c0p0i,md28usmc,5,Fri Jul 3 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"So you take the sub down? You even said the mods here weren't affected, but you take it down, and leave the users here in the dark. Sure, you punished Reddit, but you know who else you also punished? Everyone who subscribes to this sub.  I am very disappointed, but not in Reddit...more at the mods. Yeah, I know you're volunteers, but no one forced you to mod a sub. If you don't like what Reddit does, just step down. Don't make those of who don't care about this drama have to wait until you deem it's ok to reopen it.  I am considering unsubscribing from this sub for this."
tampa,3c0p0i,StrikingEarth,8,Sat Jul 4 02:36:14 2015 UTC,"So I'm going to get downvoted for this, but it's not ""our"" website.  It belongs to Reddit.  They pay all of the bills.  The staffing, the hosting.  They're allowed to fire whomever they want.  All the mods who are complaining that the Admins don't help or listen to them don't realize that they aren't equal to the Admins.  They are volunteer babysitters.  This whole thing has really soured me on the Reddit community."
tampa,3c0p0i,Gamerchris360,4,Fri Jul 3 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Without the users there is no reddit, the site will end up like digg and admins looking for other jobs. As a whole the users and mods hold power."
tampa,3c0p0i,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,10,Sat Jul 4 00:08:25 2015 UTC,"The reddit staff makes a living on the backs of thousands of unpaid volunteer moderators. The very least they can do is respect the volunteers who keep this site alive. Reddit's admins would be looking for a new job if it weren't for the mods.  That said, they probably will be out of work when voat gets its servers up again."
tampa,3c0p0i,Gamerchris360,2,Fri Jul 3 19:25:44 2015 UTC,"The staff makes their living from advertisers. The advertisers need to see this place a certain way or they won't spend the money needed to pay everyone. Some decisions were made that improved the admin/advertiser relationship and made the whole community stop working. People are still talking about it days later.  One of two things happens now: 1) The likely scenario: it blows over. Everything goes back to normal. Why do you think they did it before a holiday weekend? 2) the unlikely scenario: LOTS of traffic goes away, the advertisers lose interest, reddit becomes digg."
tampa,3c0p0i,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,3,Sat Jul 4 11:31:11 2015 UTC,"When you say that ""everything returns to normal,"" you do miss out on some form of a third option: the return to status quo, where we currently are, is clearly insufficient for business itself.  We're not there yet. But this is the most likely outcome in which the blackout protests prove somewhat viable. Admin does realize the gravity of the protests and frustrations, and they do actually begin to follow through with some of their promises.  I should point out that Reddit has now been covered in top-tier international press (NYTIMES, BBC, Forbes, etc) twice in the past 60 days, and both times for massive community rebellion. For a community-based site, that's not a good thing."
tampa,3c0p0i,StrikingEarth,2,Sat Jul 4 12:06:31 2015 UTC,"The thing is, unless the admins have started, there is very little they can do in a short time to improve things. Development takes time, and it seems that starting now would just feel like more empty promises until the product is delivered."
tampa,3c0p0i,Gamerchris360,2,Sat Jul 4 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're definitely right. Plus, admin has only said ""we hear you. Our mistake is that we haven't communicated much,"" which is such an underwhelming answer, it betrays a sense that they really simply do not understand the grievances of the community.  But your point is spot on- not only will it take time, admin hasn't even said what the hell they're planning to do about it in a discrete achievable manner. They've said they ""will fix it."""
tampa,3c0p0i,rhayward,0,Sat Jul 4 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"Holy lol wow. Are you trying to discount my point about the mods being pivotal to the functioning of reddit? Do you think that reddit's success has to do with advertisers, Pao, admins or the massive user base?  I suppose Pao can make reddit another bastion of political correctness, but the users won't stay for it, the average redditor is not a politically correct person. I have literally know idea why you think this is such an unlikely scenario, we're watching it happen with our own eyes right now. To drive that point home, you are part of a minority thinking that reddit isn't going the way of Digg. Most people can see the writing on the walls, major media and experts included."
tampa,3c0p0i,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,0,Sat Jul 4 13:50:11 2015 UTC,"Mods are important yes, but there are a lot of people in the community that would likely step up if needed.  I don't mean to say that they wouldn't burn out quickly or discount what the current mods do, but I've been around enough to see some mods leave and life continue.  If there were a mass exodus, then that would spell trouble of course. Right now to the uneducated user this looks very similar to Facebook turning all rainbows and confederate flags for a few days."
tampa,3c0p0i,tinybubbles1234,8,Sat Jul 4 15:59:27 2015 UTC,We pay the bills too. Reddit would be nothing without the user-generated content. See Digg 4.0
tampa,3c0p0i,petzebra,6,Fri Jul 3 19:33:31 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you.  However, I disagree. I don't believe the mods think of themselves as equivalent to the admin in general. I think the majority of the mods are aware of the structure and hierarchy.  I also think that /u/chooter's firing is more telling not of a misunderstanding of roles, duties, and power structures on the mods' behalf, but rather a misunderstanding of the lay of the land on the admins' behalf.   Consider that IAMA is one of the highest draws and most significant subreddits for the outside world, as far as Reddit corporate is concerned. It makes the news far more often than any other sub, and it makes for positive stories about Reddit more often. Now: the admin obviously wants to harness that, but they misunderstood their own power structures. The apparently believed they could remove the point-admin, /u/chooter, and the mods would take the reins. They offered no explanation and gave no indication this would occur prior to the event.  The admin believed the mods were more capable; the mods themselves revolted, feeling that the single most significant contributor to a well-running sub had been removed. Victoria apparently worked 50 hour weeks almost exclusively in that sub; the mods worked ""a few hours here or there when we can"" on the sub. It wasn't the mods who overvalued their work and worth.  Ironically, of course, now /r/iama has declared independence from admin. So, all this for them to stake their claim on power. It's almost as though the admin has now created that condition that you say was always there.  (Edits: correcting the autocorrect)"
tampa,3c0p0i,elkanor,8,Fri Jul 3 20:47:04 2015 UTC,"You are correct, they do pay the bills. And they do that by selling ads (which require users to visit the site) and by reddit gold (which require users to buy it.) The admins are free to do whatever they want, and as users we are free to visit or not visit this website."

tampa,3c0p0i,nefariousfoo,3,Fri Jul 3 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"If this were a walkout or strike, it would be a disaster. Potentially up to ten thousand members of our subreddit were disadvantaged by the hastily performed actions of a few. The blackout was done in a show of solidarity with a body lacking a clear and formal set of demands and quick to retreat under pressure to restore service their own users without any immediate gains.   But this isn't the turn of the century and reddit isn't a steel corporation or a railroad car company. It’s 2015 and the infrastructure and means of production in this situation are not tightly controlled and easily defended, but are loosely held and easily shifted. If we're unhappy, we can leave, and at incredible speed and volume.  I came to reddit from Digg. The leadership at Digg failed to listen to power users / moderators and - for that reason among others - it cost them over 20 million users in the process.   That sharp reduction happened in little over a year.  I'm happy that our small subreddit was part of a loud and clear message to the administration that while many of us are lazy and unfocused (and possibly high some of the time) for better or for worse we’re in control, and we’re very much awake.   This wasn't a poorly executed walkout, it was a collective warning shot across a company threatening to mark its apogee. If you make us mad we’ll go to whatever is the next reddit. If it doesn’t already exist we’ll build it."
tampa,3c0p0i,mnseats,7,Fri Jul 3 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"I still want to know what changed. The admins promised to be more reactive and to help coordinate amas yesterday . But the blackout continued and there is no actual accountability or demands here. Just ""we're angry, listen to us"" and ""okay, we promise we listened"". No one won here and r/tampa, unlike the majority of location based subs, joined.   There are no wins in the long or short term for mods on this, no guarantees. Physical or digital, this isn't how negotiating power works. If you don't get the promise of change in writing and a clear list of the changes, you got shit. I'd expect our mods to think of this community before joining up on a halfcocked snowball, especially since i talked to one literally last night and they said this wasnt going to happen. (Remember, no one planned a blackout. Iama did one to get their house in order. R/science threw a hissyfit and jumped on. Then we were off to the races.)"

tampa,3bw14r,carlosthecat,6,Thu Jul 2 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"Not a nurse, but:  There are a lot of hospitals in the area to choose from. Just a couple off the top of my head would be University Community (Temple Terrace), the various Morton Plant / Mease hospitals (Clearwater, just outside of Safety Harbor, and St. Petersburg), All Children's (St. Pete), Brandon Regional (Brandon).  I think the main problem you might face is competition for jobs (we have several nursing schools here) and hospital's desire for experienced nurses. You might have to settle for something like a nursing home / rehab center for a year or two in order to get that experience. We have lots of those too, if that's what you have to do."

tampa,3bw14r,djgizmo,2,Fri Jul 3 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"Nurse here.  There are several hospitals. But as a new-grad you'll need to learn to be flexible with first the hospital you work at (assuming you have your heart set on working in the hospital). After gaining some experience, you will always have the opportunity to move in the direction you want to move, especially if you start in a hospital. You can stay determined to start in GYN specialty, but it may be a difficult and long time before you find something you're willing to settle for-- given you've eliminated two of the largest competing hospitals in Tampa from your scope.  Consider: Memorial Hospital, Brandon Hospital, Shriner's, Veteran's Hospital, All Children's Hospital, Largo Medical, Kindred. I know you said you are not interested in Florida Hospital Tampa, but you should consider their other campuses. Just like St. Joseph's has many campuses, so does Florida Hospital. You can choose from Carollwood, Zephyrhills, Wesley Chapel, Pepin...   I work at Florida Hospital Zephyrhills. I can say from experience that being a student there and being employed there is completely different. I enjoy my employer very much, and since it is a smaller campus than Tampa, I really enjoy the atmosphere and the people that work there at well. Just continue to do your research and apply anywhere and everywhere."
tampa,3bw14r,foofdawg,2,Thu Jul 2 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"my problem with florida hospital tampa was religion everywhere. I mean, bible quotes as screensavers, morning prayer during group huddle, phrases about jesus in every bulletin or poster... is it like that in their other hospitals? I try to be very open, but that was too overwhelming.  Memorial was one I was hoping to hear about, so I'll most likely apply there. I've heard not so nice things about Brandon (for example, their L&D dept is 'get that baby out of there by any means before my shift ends'). I haven't heard of some of the others you've mentioned, so thank you for the info! I'll look into them."
tampa,3bw14r,truthcanbequestioned,2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"I will agree with you on the overwhelming workplace presence of Christ. But this is their mission, you can either make peace with that fact or not. However, as someone who does not practice the Adventist religion, I personally have no problem working there. In the work place, cultural and religious diversity is respected; you are not obligated to do things that outside your comfort zone, such as praying with a patient or praying together with staff. But I practice courtesy and respect for those that wish to do those things. No one will ever ask you to to those things or force you into an uncomfortable situation.  Yes, there might be screen savers, posters in the halls, or bibles in the bedside table of every room. Yes, you will be an important facilitator of getting the chaplain to provide spiritual support to patients and families when you are not comfortable providing that support yourself (I'm not great at providing spiritual support so I love getting the chaplain involved!) As far at morning prayers, not every unit everywhere does this; I think it is more of a director discretion thing...  I will admit I had the same concerns when I was seeking out a job 3 years ago as well... and I thought the same things: ""Do I really want to feel pressured by their mission to extend the healing ministry of Christ? Is that enough to convince me that I will not be able to deliver effective nursing care?"" Ultimately, I decided to leap in. I continue to be agnostic in my beliefs, but I support the work and the work of others in what I do... and that's all that matters, isn't it? :) I hope this sheds some light on what it's like to work at a Florida Hospital. I think with consideration, you may warm up to the idea."
tampa,3bw14r,Repa,2,Thu Jul 2 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"that was an excellent reply, thank you for the insight! one of the things my professor told us about finding a job is to look at the hospital's mission, and if you don't agree with it, that's most likely not a good choice for you. Since I'm an atheist, it's really difficult for me to embrace theirs, haha. it's good info to know that not all floors are that devout though, so it'll remain an option for me. thanks again!"

Driving more than an hour away to and from work sucks. B)  Morton Plant - Mease (Collectively known as Baycare) is a decent hospital system.   Pay is above average, benefits are good, but health insurance is limited to 'in network' only for most things as they're force you to go to Baycare specific doctors/hospitals etc.  C)  If you're a new grad, get in on ANY floor asap.  Women's Health (Mom & Baby or Delivery) is hard to get into as very very very few nurses ever quit or change floors from that.

tampa,3bsm8m,The-Rev,13,Wed Jul 1 22:17:22 2015 UTC,"The two biggest reasons for me is that 64 is a much more convenient amount to fill, carry and drink than 32 and 128. 32 is only two beers and a gallon is too much to drink before it loses carbonation. The other is that it repeals a law that the lobbyists for the huge beer brands pushed for to discourage competition from smaller breweries. It's a win for small businesses over big businesses."

tampa,3bsm8m,posam,16,Thu Jul 2 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"This is the standard amount with brewers. Like, if you went to any other state and went to a taproom, this is what you could take home. Florida was kinda forcing brewers to go outside of an industry standard. If you had a growler from somewhere else, you couldn't fill it up here. And it was done basically entirely at the behest of the alcohol distributors lobby, iirc.   Now you can! Plus 64 = 2x32 which is more beer."
tampa,3bsm8m,elkanor,3,Wed Jul 1 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"It's very strange. It actually shouldn't be a big deal, and really isn't, except for the very strange laws of Florida.   The reason anybody cares about it is because it has been an absurd and ridiculous political battle over the last 3 years to get these things. That battle, to get these things, has actually threatened to destroy the craft beer industry in Florida at least three separate times. So that's the emotion.  Briefly: Florida had banned this one size because it was ""too big"" and would be dangerous. People would fill their jug then drink it all and die, or something. Florida's law did allow 32oz growlers, and 1 gallon growlers. No other alcohol of any other type faced similar restrictions, so it was targeted at beer. For the rest of the country, 64oz is the standard size. So those of us who came down here from other areas were puzzled, and perhaps annoyed.   Then we learned how the law actually worked: the law had a restriction on the container sizes, but that's it. All that had to be done was to add the number ""64"" to the law to allow it. Not a big concern to bring Florida's craft beer scene up to the rest of the country. As Florida's craft scene has exploded, we joined the Brewers in asking for that change.  Boy did we screw up. When we asked our legislators to propose the change to the law, we learned a lot. Primarily that any easy fix like this will turn into a battle to the death.   The legislators who are heavily financed by big corporate beer interests, primarily the hugely powerful alcohol distribution companies in Florida, turned his request into opportunities to cripple craft beer - potentially destroy it in Florida by so severely constraining how small breweries could distribute beer and how large they could get under that licensing structure. It wasn't a joke. The law was revised to allow growlers, but also entirely rewritten to force breweries into strict and unbreakable bonds to distribution companies.  There have been, over the past 3 years, at least 3-4 laws proposed to address the one-line amendment allowing for 64 oz growlers while leading to such significant restrictions on brewers. Those proposals nearly came to a vote, so we were on the brink each time. There also was a major lawsuit by the distributors claiming breweries did not have the right to sell any beer at all directly and asking for the law to be revised to cripple this.  Finally, this past year, a ""clean"" bill was proposed and barely passed. There are some restrictions, but they are reasonable.  So, that's why people are happy over such a remarkably stupid thing. If craft beer is your scene, these dumb 64oz growlers - a dumb restriction in the first place - represent these battles as well."

tampa,3bvdfw,windsyofwesleychapel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:56:35 2015 UTC,"Most boxes can probably be discarded.  When it comes to moving, a lot of things, like the coffee maker, can be packed in a larger box with some wadded newspaper for padding.  I would recommend holding on to the box and packing materials for the television and anything else that is large, oddly-shaped, and fragile.  When it does come time to move, these are the ones that will come in handy.  I would recommend storing the boxes in the attic, assuming that is an option.  If you do, get some plastic shrink-wrap and wrap the boxes so that bugs and rodents do not make it their new home.  If you have absolutely nowhere that it can fit without being in the way, get rid of it.  Just know that if the items do need to be moved in the future, they will require special care and probably a separate trip in the back seat of your personal car rather than a moving truck."

tampa,3bvdfw,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"Having just gone through this, here's my personal take on the question.   Boxes are only worth keeping if you are going to move relatively soon and the item requires that specific box for its safe journey.   The vast majority of our stuff does not require this. Including TVs, though it may make the TV easier to cart around.   Some items require the box for warranty concerns - or at least we presume they do. Most don't, actually. All you really need is the proof of purchase and a receipt if you ever need to deal with warranties.  tl;dr - get rid of em. (recycle!) You really only need a handful of specific boxes, and the cardboard is easy and relatively cheap to replace when you do move."
tampa,3bvdfw,rhayward,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"I flatten the boxes. If I don't have room for them then I would just toss them. You can always store them under the bed or something like that, just make sure you do cover them, because like others have said, roaches like the cardboard."
tampa,3bvdfw,elkanor,2,Thu Jul 2 14:18:26 2015 UTC,As someone who used to move a lot - under the bed is the best place. It's space you weren't using before and it prevents stuff from rolling under there

tampa,3bssrx,GulfLife,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:34:51 2015 UTC,Yes! They were called lecterns. They sat on a stand above the cigar rollers and read the newspaper out loud in the morning. They could also read anything else after the news.

You'll have to call for availability, and it's around $150 a night, and you'll certainly want to inquire if they or their other guests that night plan on shooting off fireworks.   If that place doesn't work, I would just do a nearby search for hotels and scan the map for any hotel located outside of a town or city. A remote beach on the West Coast may also work, but may also be more than an hour away from you, and beach towns tend to have fireworks celebrations.  Good luck to you sir."

tampa,3btp00,nefariousfoo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:43:11 2015 UTC,I went fishing at the Skyway pier on the 4th years ago and I remember it being quiet. We could see the fireworks over the horizon and maybe hear some very distant rumbling. I don't recall anyone playing with fireworks on the pier itself.  The fishing pier isn't free. There are areas on each side of the skyway pier that are free to use except for the toll road cost. There's no guarantee that there won't be fireworks people around though.
tampa,3btp00,Tawtwo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"Go to a gun shop and pick up a pair of these. Peal back the cushioning and slip ear buds through, snap cushions back in place. Listen to music with all other noise blocked out. I wedge the ear buds behind the foam on the inside to keep them from rubbing against my ear. If you need a little extra you can put a foam insert in your ear as well. You'll still be able to hear the music, but pretty much not anything else.  The only other place I can think of would be to hang out somewhere where it would be really illegal to set of fireworks. I'd probably go hang out at TIA. Sometimes I like to go there, have a drink, and watch people greet their loved ones arriving."
tampa,3btp00,mattyparanoid,0,Sat Jul 4 10:34:00 2015 UTC,This is a tough one. I will say that a good hotel with an inside room is your best bet. I have been in some hotels where once you shut the door it is like a tomb.  Typically the higher end ones with more than 7 floors are going to be pretty quiet inside the rooms. You will have to part with some cash to get this. Wish I could help with a recommendation but I live here so I have not stayed in many hotels.

We'll have to make a trip down there in the coming years and check it out. When we're on vacation we're usually out and about during the day and home base is just a place to sleep and get fed ;)"
tampa,3bt4om,sabr0sa,3,Thu Jul 2 14:12:55 2015 UTC,"I live fairly close to that area and can maybe offer some insight.  Most of that area is heavily wooded. The roads back there used to be limestone, but may have been paved since I've been there last. There is a strange mix of houses out there, one lot may have a beautiful home while next has a trailer. Taxes are very reasonable. Crime rates are low. Schools are mostly very good. The people are friendly. You're close by to lots of things to do.  If you like boating and nature this is a great area to be. If you like night life then it's probably not for you.   There's the Weeki Wachee river near by. Weeki Wachee is the ""city of mermaids."" The spring fed river is crystal clear and 72 degrees year round. It's great to kayak or tube down. You'll almost always see a manatee. There's some good cave diving here too, if you're into that. Bayport is a small community near by. At one time it was the county seat, though it's mostly a boat launch now. Easy Gulf access for boating and great fishing. Pine Island is the local beach. Based on the location in your map you're about 10 minutes away. It's a nice clean beach with a great play area for kids. It's very shallow.  Spring Hill is the largest community near by (and technically where your lot is located). It's got around 100,000 people spread in typically sprawl fashion. There's all of your standard chain restaurants and stores near by. Most everything you need in the way of stores or restaurants can be found on highway 50 or US 19. Crystal River and Homosassa Rivers are up north a bit. Great area for boating and diving. Just north of you to the west side of US 19 is mostly the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge. It's old Florida at its finest. You can hike, kayak, boat, fish, and explore thousands of acres of pristine wilderness. You're also close to Tampa and Orlando, which give you lots of fun vacation opportunities within an hour or two driving distance.   Hope that helps! Let me know if you've got more questions."
tampa,3bt4om,sabr0sa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:32:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, it sounds like a place we would probably enjoy. We have kids, nightlife is not really what we're interested in. My husband and I both grew up on the US East Coast fishing and boating so we all enjoy that. We're in CO now and love camping and hiking. My son desperately wants to learn to Kayak and all the kids love fishing. My in-laws already have a place on the East Coast of Florida (Boynton Beach) and that part of FL is kind of 'meh' to us. We don't go there often because it's mostly old people and stores. This area seems quite different and more what we're into, it might be worth it to build a bungalow for vacation and retirement."
tampa,3bt4om,el_americano,2,Thu Jul 2 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of old people and stores around here too. It IS Florida after all!  This area is known as ""The Nature Coast."" Much of the coast here is undeveloped preserve area. We have more than our share of subdivision sprawl though. It's quite different than the Boynton area.  I'd suggest a trip down before you make any long term decisions. Let me know if you'd like a list of things to do/see. Good luck!"

Don't drive during 7-8:30am or 4:45-6pm. Otherwise, /u/brendantheraven was on point. Ybor during the day has some smaller galleries that might interest you. If you want to hear live music, go to Crowbar or New World Brewery.   This is a good weekend because: The gentrifying neighborhood, Seminole Heights, has First Friday of art stuff on Friday night. Grab dinner at one of the restaurants near by, then go to a couple galleries, then grab a beer at Independent or Mermaid or something harder at Red Star."
tampa,3bu2nh,elkanor,2,Thu Jul 2 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"Adding votes to much of the advice here... Especially these points: sunscreen Not a joke or to be taken lightly. You will burn way faster here. It doesn't matter if you never burn north of the Georgia line. You will get a sunburn here. Use 30 SPF at least if you will be outside for anything more than 15 minutes. Don't muck up the rest of your trip with a nasty burn.  weather How can a place be both so sunny and so rainy? It's a modern mystery. You're going to sweat. A lot. Make sure to reapply the aforementioned sunscreen :) the rain usually stops shortly after it starts this time of year, unless it's a night storm. If it does storm at night, you'll see lightning unlike anything you've likely seen before. That's normal. No worries.  traffic Honestly, it's not that bad outside of typical rush hour.  That being said, freeway lane changes can be a competitive sport for some, so keep your eyes open.  things to do Please visit our beautiful beaches and have at least one decent Cuban meal- the Columbia in Ybor is easy to find and has great food.  For beaches, I personally prefer the St. Pete beaches, but you can't go wrong on the Gulf coast (don't swim in the Bay, you'll miss the whole experience)  Hope you have a great trip and enjoy your short stay here!!"

tampa,3bn8im,2015RaysTime,8,Tue Jun 30 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty much just 100% WUSF and WMNF (mostly for NPR & BBC segments).   Up 'til a few years ago, I used to listen to The Bone and various music stations, but ... It all got so repetitive. And I don't really care to hear about pop culture factoids, sports, or the opinions of people who're uneducated about the things they're trying to talk about. I'd rather learn about something than hear Welcome to the Jungle for the 10,000th time or listen to an overpaid fat guy make fun of callers.  When there aren't any good segments on though I just switch to Spotify. Podcasts and audiobooks for long drives."
tampa,3bn8im,VenetiaMacGyver,5,Tue Jun 30 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry OP but I find Schnitt to be insufferable and an all around obnoxious dude. I cannot listen to him for more than 15 minutes, and that's an aside to his limited understanding / interpretation of current events. I'd once listened to a lot of 970 though now it seems the only thing I follow on the station are Ground Zero and Coast to Coast AM (11pm-5am). Awhile back I'd listened to 1010 for the Don and Mike Show as well as Michael Savage and Dennis Miller. If Miller and Savage are still on 1010, they're entertaining.  These days I listen to our local NPR affiliate, WUSF. When I'd finally ""converted"" over, it was nice to hear a discussion of the news without the yelling or hyperbole."

tampa,3bn8im,slowtreme,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:00:18 2015 UTC,It is even more depressing when you consider how smart he is to play as dumb as he does on radio to listeners. He likely has no respect for his listeners given how much he bull-baits them.  At least Sean Hannity and Bill Cunningham (GREAT AMERICANS) have the pretense of nationalism rather than unabashed jingoism.

On the way home I will usually listen to whatever podcast I was in the middle of when I left work. If I am not in the middle of one, I will either listen to my top rated music on shuffle or pick an older podcast I don't really keep up on. It all depends on what I am in the mood for at the time.

tampa,3bj131,jgriff23,3,Mon Jun 29 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"Howdy!  Property Manager here! We have a few properties in Seminole Heights (all rented, sorry!) but I wanted to offer some advice that may assist you.  Zillow/Postlets/Trulia/Hotpads are a great way to see a bunch of homes at once. The challenge is, everyone else can see them as well.  We put our newest Seminole Heights home up on Postlets and spits it out to all of the sites and had over 40 repsonses within two days. The second person who came to see the house took it...and it was off the market that quick.  My suggestion is to drive around some of the neighborhoods you are interested in. If you see a neighbor out in a yard ask if they know of anyone renting a place. There are a lot of homes for rent that aren't owned by professional investors...just an extra home that someone has. Many of these owners are older and not tech savvy so just stick signs in the yard as opposed to posting online.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL There are a ton of scams running, mainly off Craigslist, by people who get your SSN and other info for a ""background check"" then they steal your identity. Just happened to a young lady we met.  A great way to avoid this is to use a system such as My Smart Move by Transunion which allows the Landlord to get all of your info with requiring access to your SSN#.  Good luck!"

tampa,3bj131,md28usmc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"My suggestion?  1) Stick it up on Postlets.  2) Make certain you include in your ad: We cannot rent to anyone with a prior eviction, no arrests or convictions for felonies, major drug offenses, violent crimes or sex offenses, must have income at least 3x the monthly rent amount, must have last 2 pay stubs, must be with current employer for a minimum of 6 months, must have 3 non-family references.  That will weed out a lot of the BS. Every now and then someone will still try and apply with an eviction or felony on their record.

tampa,3bgmoj,The-Rev,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:08:04 2015 UTC,"No, use your blinker, but make sure it's the opposite of the direction you're turning, so if you're in the right lane and you want to cross 4 lanes to the left, put your right blinker on. This warns people behind you that you have priority over the whole road."
tampa,3bgmoj,rhayward,2,Mon Jun 29 14:17:40 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but that is incorrect and not what the Tampa driving manual states. You're supposed to use your alternate directional indicator only AFTER you've completed the 4 lane cross.

tampa,3bgmoj,rhayward,2,Mon Jun 29 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"I lived off memorial for 4 years starting back in 2k, and lived through the construction and implementation.  Before construction was completed, traffic would slow down to a crawl when trying to enter Veterans that way during rush hour.  It was also a problem with trying to cross over 60 to get onto the causeway, cause you know people coming up 60 are going fast as fuck and you only got like 1/4 mile to speed up and cross over 4 lanes or you'd run into a people riding each other asses and preventing you from getting over.  I think it's better, especially how you come over 60 going south and you can see the bay's water.  Really glad someone had the idea to make it where you can see that beautiful scenery."

You know what else Florida has a heritage of? A thriving gay population. Yet if you were to put up a gigantic rainbow flag around the same area all the Southern conservatives would bitch and moan.  My ancestors were Confederate officers--I have the medals and regalia and all that jazz-- and yet somehow, some way, I'm still capable of not getting butt-hurt about taking this flag down...this tangible symbol of repression that is truly hurtful to many people who have to drive by it everyday while rednecks disingenuously justify it with vague, nebulous idylls about  ""liberty"", ""heritage"", and ""culture"".   It doesn't matter how much you slice-and-dice the multiple reasons that lead to the South rebelling. And it doesn't matter to what extent slavery was one of those reasons. It unquestionably was a key factor, and this flag is a symbol that cannot be extricated or compartmentalized from this ugly truth.  Yes, it's on private property and you have a right to fly it. Just as everyone else has a right to call you a dick and browbeat you for it. Yes the flag may mean something to you that most likely has nothing to do with slavery, but not everyone can put on rose-tinted glasses, ignore the underlying relation to slavery this flag carries, and bask in the happy memories of their pappy sipping mint juleps and going'-a-fishin' at the ol' fishin' hole with a straw hanging out his mouth. Be the bigger person and realize you have the ability to remove this symbol of hurt from others' lives.  I have no doubt that this flag will eventually come down against a tide of unpopularity with reasonable, level-headed human beings."

And the flag has been taken down before. For a few months in 2007. It's back after some legal hassle. It's not going anywhere. Tampa is extremely progressive, and have opened our arms wide open to gays, but to erase everything from the past just means you're doomed to repeat it. This is a memorial on private property.

tampa,3bbnv3,ltg313,10,Sun Jun 28 03:46:51 2015 UTC,Ceasing to celebrate treason in the name of racism isn't erasing it from history. We don't need rednecks to proudly wear symbols of anti-civil rights protesters to continue teaching our kids about the civil war.
tampa,3bbnv3,Gr8UncleRuckus,-1,Sun Jun 28 11:20:06 2015 UTC,You are trying hard to rustle the jimmies of others.
tampa,3bbnv3,ltg313,3,Sun Jun 28 14:37:46 2015 UTC,It's kinda hard to take you seriously in a discussion about civil rights with that username.
tampa,3bbnv3,Gr8UncleRuckus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:41:34 2015 UTC,I guess the founding fathers were treasonous too. We should just say yes to whatever the government says. Our children will look back and respect us for our complacency and submissive ways.

tampa,3bbnv3,Ctrl--Alt--Del,3,Wed Jul 1 03:05:33 2015 UTC,There was a long article in the LA Times published today about this flag and he memorial as well.
tampa,3bbnv3,AweBeyCon,4,Sat Jun 27 18:01:41 2015 UTC,Here's the Link
tampa,3bbnv3,peg_leg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:44:56 2015 UTC,Probably cause it's the largest confederate flag in the world.
tampa,3bbnv3,aryndelvyst,3,Sun Jun 28 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"That's not flying above a capital of a US State.  Rule is: You lose, you don't get to fly your flag."
tampa,3bbnv3,Box-of-Sunshine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:01:00 2015 UTC,They should have to fly a white flag.
tampa,3bbnv3,TheAsgards,3,Sun Jun 28 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that they could just fly a bigger Union flag over it, since it would basically say the Union was better."
tampa,3bbnv3,Slickrick1688,3,Mon Jun 29 12:41:09 2015 UTC,"If its on private property then why would I care? If its a museum type deal then it should be okay but if its just the government wanting to have the confederate battle flag, then screw that."
tampa,3bbnv3,coolman1581,8,Sun Jun 28 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"I drive by this thing several times a week. Yes it's ridiculous. The south lost the war, move on. You don't need to fly a huge flag above the interstate to show your deep love for your southern heritage. A lot of people don't want to look at this eye sore as they are driving down the interstate."
tampa,3bbnv3,Slickrick1688,0,Mon Jun 29 05:02:55 2015 UTC,"On the other side, why should YOU care. It's a personal symbol for people's ancestry. If it has nothing to do with you, why care? In fact, can we go back to the point where you didn't even give two shits this thing was flying like the other 90% of this movement?"
tampa,3bbnv3,AweBeyCon,3,Sun Jun 28 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn't offend me or anything, it's just kind of annoying how it's being blatantly put in people's faces. Kind of like those annoying anti abortion billboards I see littered across the state. It's fine to be proud of your ancestry, but does it really need to be a huge ass flag on a huge ass flag pole? I don't think it does."
tampa,3bbnv3,Slickrick1688,-6,Tue Jun 30 22:58:15 2015 UTC,No worse that half the billboards along I75 around there.
tampa,3bbnv3,AweBeyCon,8,Wed Jul 1 00:58:08 2015 UTC,Except most billboards don't have incredibly negative things associated with them.
tampa,3bbnv3,arriflex,-6,Sun Jun 28 05:38:45 2015 UTC,I guess that depends on who's looking at it
tampa,3bbnv3,AweBeyCon,2,Sun Jun 28 05:54:59 2015 UTC,"Find me a billboard that says ""Just wanted to remind you we did our best to make it so you could own the people in the car next to you."""
tampa,3bbnv3,StrikingEarth,-1,Sun Jun 28 06:09:10 2015 UTC,"How it makes you feel is irrelevant. The message you see in it is irrelevant. It's a privately owned piece of property. It's the rights of the owner to fly it.  Do I agree with the flag? No, but then again, whenever I see it I think of the dukes of hazard."
tampa,3bbnv3,hillmon,2,Sun Jun 28 15:18:04 2015 UTC,Yeah nobody can do anything about this flag that hasn't already been done.
tampa,3bbnv3,170lbsApe,2,Sun Jun 28 15:29:54 2015 UTC,"Its a war memorial from the Sons of the Confederacy. . . I'm not from the South and I don't care about the flag issue, but they have a right to honor their ancestors that fought in the war."
tampa,3bbnv3,tinybubbles1234,6,Sun Jun 28 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly I get why they want to bring it down, but thats a memorial for the soldiers right? I thin it should get a pass or at the most change to the actual battle flag they had originally."
tampa,3bbnv3,SnakeOilGhost,11,Sun Jun 28 15:44:06 2015 UTC,A memorial for soldiers is fine.  I would also say why not fly any of the other flags the confederates used other than the one flag that was hijacked and made a symbol that so many find to be a symbol of hate? Confederate's were enemies of the USA. They lost.  They should be grateful they have full states rights and all the benifits of all other USA citizens.
tampa,3bbnv3,tewas,6,Sat Jun 27 20:17:21 2015 UTC,They do. Regularly actually. I've seen at least 5 different flags on that pole. I believe it's usually changed in correlation with anniversaries of battles.
tampa,3bbnv3,gloystertheoyster,-4,Sat Jun 27 21:23:39 2015 UTC,Maybe we should also fly nazi flag to commemorate another enemy of the USA that lost in ww2
tampa,3bbnv3,OperationJack,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:37:41 2015 UTC,we could at least name out military helicopters after the victims of genocide
tampa,3bbnv3,Bman74,0,Sat Jun 27 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"No actual German Nazis are noted to have died and be buried on US soil. If so, they would probably have done that, or flown one of the flags from before the Third Reich."
tampa,3bbnv3,OperationJack,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:07:26 2015 UTC,Actually they were a few German POW camps here in Florida. Not sure if any died but it could've been.
tampa,3bbnv3,Bman74,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:57:19 2015 UTC,The remains were sent back to Germany if they did.
tampa,3bbnv3,OperationJack,3,Sun Jun 28 12:33:57 2015 UTC,Looks like some are still buried here.
tampa,3bbnv3,tewas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:26:49 2015 UTC,I had not seen that article. Thanks. They probably don't have Nazi Swastikas or flags on the graves regardless.
tampa,3bbnv3,sveitthrone,-2,Sun Jun 28 13:41:23 2015 UTC,And you think it wouldn't make people associate that person with anti Jewish sentiment?
tampa,3bbnv3,ColossalExodus,3,Sun Jun 28 13:57:23 2015 UTC,It's a false equivalency and doesn't help the argument.
tampa,3bbnv3,ColossalExodus,-1,Sat Jun 27 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"The issue though, is that during the Civil War many families had sons who fought on different sides. No matter your take on it, this war was between Americans, and the dead on both sides deserve respect. That flag is, and should not be, representative of the hateful government, but it is and should be a symbol for those who fought for the south."
tampa,3bbnv3,Gr8UncleRuckus,-2,Sun Jun 28 01:27:42 2015 UTC,"Also can we talk about the Germany argument. Slavery was still a common practice around the world during the mid 1800s, yes it was dying off, but it still was prevalent.  Mass genocide however, was not a common occurrence during the early 1900s, save for what the Brits were doing. There was most certainly some plausible deniability for the south, still wrong and horrible, but it was there. Germans were clearly evil in what they were doing."
tampa,3bbnv3,tinybubbles1234,-1,Sun Jun 28 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"What you are doing is dividing America. You are mocking the dead. Real men and real family members had to pick a side and kill their fellow countrymen to stand up for their chosen ideals. The south is not an enemy of the USA, it is still part of it. It is a huge logical red flag when anything is compared to the nazis."
tampa,3bbnv3,Gr8UncleRuckus,3,Sun Jun 28 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"The southern states that seceded were very much and an enemy of the USA.  620,000 people died. The south states are part of the USA and not subjects due to the grace of the north.     I do not see the confed flag as a slave thing,   I see it as the flag of a sworn enemy of the USA."
tampa,3bbnv3,mattyparanoid,0,Sun Jun 28 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"Key word here is ""WERE"". As in past tense. The president of the USA, ordered the welcome of his countrymen back, as brothers."
tampa,3bbnv3,Slickrick1688,2,Sun Jun 28 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"When I saw this flag shortly after moving to Tampa I just shook my head and said, ""Flori-duh"" There is just so much stupid here it hurts sometimes."
tampa,3bbnv3,ChucktheYoungBuck,2,Mon Jun 29 08:12:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. I've lived here for 10 years and think it on almost a daily basis.
tampa,3bbnv3,jojochan,0,Sun Jun 28 12:53:35 2015 UTC,everyone is so offended these days. I honestly can't believe a flag has drawn so much attention.
tampa,3bbnv3,Dirtydirtdirtt,2,Sun Jun 28 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"Realistically though, if it was a huge swastika flying, the Jewish community would fight it as well. It would be a constant reminder and it would piss them off. And rightfully so. It is something that the person is willfully flying, knowing good and well what it represents. Also, knowing the controversy it will cause. It is his/her private property and right, but still an asshole thing to do."
tampa,3bbnv3,queenjesus,-8,Sun Jun 28 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, you know what other flag that was flown by slave owners, as well as  by a country that treated African Americans, women, homosexuals and many other ethnicities like second class citizens. Ill give you a hint, it has 50 stars and 13 stripes.   If the American  flag can change what it stands for over the years, why can't another.  Seriously, does this flag have any real affect on you or your life?    I hope this flag stays because its a reminder of the troubled times this country went through. I also hope it stays because its owners have the right to fly it.  They're more injustices going on in the world than a flag flying people."
tampa,3bbnv3,buffalo_x,6,Sun Jun 28 05:24:24 2015 UTC,"The Confederate flag was solely created for the civil war. The American flag represents all the good and bad in our country, but mainly freedom. I don't see anyone saying ""bring back the swastika to honor WWII veterans!"" The meaning of the Confederate flag will never change."
tampa,3bbnv3,GrimWeepa,-2,Sun Jun 28 06:12:15 2015 UTC,So you wouldn't have an issue if an Al Qaeda flag flew overhead on I-75?
tampa,3bbnv3,buffalo_x,3,Sun Jun 28 10:25:37 2015 UTC,You can't be this stupid. Did you just compare modern day Al-Qaeda to the Confederate flag? Your thinking is the fucking issue in this world.
tampa,3bbnv3,GrimWeepa,3,Sun Jun 28 11:11:23 2015 UTC,"Actual no. When you think that both parties enslaved people under religious motivation, and killed Americans, they are the same damn thing, An enemy of the State. Quit trying to romanticize some BS nonsense that doesn't stick for anything American.   tmyk"
tampa,3bbnv3,buffalo_x,0,Sun Jun 28 11:22:19 2015 UTC,You may want to watch a Civil war documentary or something. Maybe learn a bit more before you start making comparisons about shit you obviously don't understand.
tampa,3bbnv3,AweBeyCon,-1,Sun Jun 28 11:43:19 2015 UTC,Actually I do understand.
tampa,3bbnv3,ChucktheYoungBuck,5,Sun Jun 28 12:22:57 2015 UTC,Well that settles that
tampa,3baxa2,Redrum777,7,Sat Jun 27 13:46:58 2015 UTC,Wondered what had happened. Drove by around 12:15am and there were ~8 cop cars outside. When I first saw it I was worried another drunk driver had driven inside again.
tampa,3baxa2,foofdawg,6,Sat Jun 27 17:29:46 2015 UTC,That would have been during pretty busy hours... that place isn't dead  at 11:30 on a Friday night by any means. That's scary levels of balls-iness on the perps side of things.
tampa,3baxa2,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"What angers me most about this, if you have a ccw you can't carry as this is a bar.  You have no defense and the perps may realize this and use this to their advantage.  So glad it was just the cash register."
tampa,3baxa2,BigBadBored,3,Sat Jun 27 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about this. It is actually illegal to drink and have a loaded firearm. Since there isn't any specific ""drunken while carrying"" law, they treat it similarly to DUIs. I just don't want to be in a bar with some hothead who has one too many beers and gets into an altercation. The law is clear and it makes sense, but most of the people I know who have CCWs wouldn't go out and get hammered while carrying."
tampa,3baxa2,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,3,Mon Jun 29 12:15:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not on the fence at all. CCWs have no place in any establishment that's primary business is serving intoxicants. It's not even personal with me, though I personally don't believe nor wish for them to be present.  The odds that a weapon will be used correctly and in the proper circumstances, ie, to  stop the armed robbery, versus the likelihood of a CCW discharging inappropriately, escalating an argument, or having severe and significant unintended consequences are just far too severe."
tampa,3baxa2,BigBadBored,2,Mon Jun 29 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"And I agree with that completely. However, I do believe you can be a responsible adult and enjoy a beer or glass of wine and still carry your firearm. I can certainly go to a restaurant and be served alcohol and legally carry my firearm as long as I'm not intoxicated. Why should going to a bar be any different? After all, we do let people drive to and from bars and there are a lot more people killed by drunk drivers than stray bullets."
tampa,3baxa2,Aspencer8111,-2,Mon Jun 29 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"You'll get down voted for this, bc...reddit. But the sad thing is that you aren't wrong at all."
tampa,3baxa2,mvmntsofthemind,21,Sat Jun 27 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I support and exercise the right to ccw but if I'm having a beer at the Indy, and some idiot comes in to rob the place, the last thing I want is anyone playing hero and trying to take a shot in that place. What are the chances of them not hitting an innocent? Pretty fucking small in that joint.   And yes, I'm comin' in hot on this one, because I'm very passionate about not getting gut shot over a craft beer. :)"
tampa,3baxa2,Aspencer8111,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:41:07 2015 UTC,Well...that escalated quickly...No worries on coming in hot on this issue man. I can see where you are coming from (even if I don't agree). I'm sure we can debate this over drinks sometime in the near future.
tampa,3baxa2,Lyxh,0,Mon Jun 29 15:49:04 2015 UTC,CCW holders aren't there to play hero and protect others. They carry to protect themselves first and foremost.
tampa,3baxa2,mvmntsofthemind,7,Sun Jun 28 12:47:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but in some cases you just have to realize there is no good shot and you just can't do it. Here's the thing, it doesn't matter what you meant to do or for what cause or reason, if you shoot, and you hurt/kill someone, that is 100% on you. And there are plenty of places I've carried where I realized it was pointless to, because there was absolutely no way I could safely defend myself or anyone else. Perfect example of this is 3 coins diner. I think the indy is a really close second (as far as layout goes, I never carried to a bar).  My main point of contention is that /u/Redrum777 is taking some wild guesses and using them to soapbox about an issue that is fairly unrelated imo. Yes, it's true theoretically, gun-free zones may attract criminals, but we have no actual basis to determine if that was the case in this situation. But I left that issue aside entirely, because at the end of the day, you can't action with a ccw inside an establishment like the indy. Nor have I even addressed the issue of people drinking and shooting, because I don't even feel like I need to.  His argument is wrong-headed and makes a really weak/poor case for ccw. I am mostly happy with how gun rights have been preserved so far, but in order to keep them that way, we're going to have to do a whole hell of a lot better than what he just presented. So I always jump in on discussions like this and encourage folks to try a little harder."
tampa,3baxa2,BigBadBored,-3,Sun Jun 28 16:25:15 2015 UTC,"Just saying personal protection not to be a hero.  There is never a clear shot in public, I never implied we need to wild wild west this situation.  I don't drink at the bar everytime I go, most times it is to socialize.  Of course if one plans to drink you leave it at home.  Seems like someone else brought the soapbox.  So glad everyone chose to put words in my mouth."
tampa,3baxa2,TheAsgards,-6,Sun Jun 28 19:56:51 2015 UTC,Someone is mature and gets it.  The ones on the soapboxes are the types to play hero.  What end does the bullet thingies go into.  They missed the training and understanding of personal protection.  Not even wasting my time to elaborate on the types of situations I am speaking of in a robbery.  Waste of my time.
tampa,3baxa2,elecguts,0,Sun Jun 28 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"Very small. The chance of getting his by a stray bullet is about 1 in a million. I used to be all into this argument since anti-gun rhetoric tries to play it up. In 2012 there were just over 300 stray bullet injuries across the US. Of those, 60ish resulted in fatalities."

Shired Beach in Dixie county is even more remote than anything in Hernando. It was rated one of the most polluted beaches in the country due to bacteria a few years ago, although its seemed to improved more recently. Chemical runoffs from inland farms and septic tanks have been blamed for it."

All of us water-people have dubbed that place Pine Puddle, since half the time the water is way out past the no-swimming sign, and only comes in during higher tides.  It's not a great place to go for any swimming activities, and we only stay in the Weeki Wachee river for good water. The water can get warm at Pine Island since it's so shallow, and it is always strangely crowded there... Clearwater is definitely worth the drive whenever we want to go to the beach."

tampa,3b6kib,tewas,3,Fri Jun 26 12:40:25 2015 UTC,"Vibrio is not all that rare, it is more of an underreported infection. It kills at least half a dozen people  every summer in the Gulf coast and infects more than 50.  It is known as the ""flesh eating bacteria "", a very  media friendly name even though it does not do that. It does cause skin lesions which people perceive as ""flesh eating"". It is a very virulent bacterium and disease progresses rapidly. I've seen a girl who died 3 days after acquiring the infection. Prognosis is almost directly related to how soon treatment is started.   Any normal person should have no problem fighting off this bacteria and should feel no clinical symptoms. However, if you are sick or have recent open sores/cuts do not go to any open water, that means the beaches, lakes or rivers."

Most beaches in Tampa Bay have closures time to time - Picnic Island, Cypress Point, Ben T Davis, Davis Island, etc. Look for closure signs at Bay beaches."
tampa,3b6kib,mekanikal_injun,5,Fri Jun 26 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"From CDC   Persons who are immunocompromised, especially those with chronic liver disease, are at risk for V. vulnificus when they eat raw seafood, particularly oysters. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop V. vulnificus bloodstream infections than were healthy people. The bacterium is frequently isolated from oysters and other shellfish in warm coastal waters during the summer months. Since it is naturally found in warm marine waters, people with open wounds can be exposed to V. vulnificus through direct contact with seawater. There is no evidence for person-to-person transmission of V. vulnificus.   TL:DR; Don't go swimming with open wounds (never a good idea), if you have weak immune system, don't eat raw fish/oysters or drink sea water. There been 900 reported cases between 1988 and 2006 and 4 this year in florida. In short, don't sweat about it"

You'll see some lights on in the house and some off, the ones that are on are just half way- like they are on a dimmer on low.  In this situation you should turn your AC off until it passes, as it could damage your AC to run underpowered."

There's a few Indian restaurants on Fowler, Tamarind has the best overall reviews online.   For the future, if you haven't been already (not tonight, it's only open Sundays) definitely check out Thai food at the Buddhist Temple Market (wattampainenglish.com) on Sundays.   Boizao Brazilian Steakhouse is also very good when I've been. Be VERY hungry when you go, it isn't cheap, but the main entrees and sides are all you can eat (be careful, coca colas are charged each, a buddy rang up over $25 in soda)  That takes care of T, B, G, and I.   My favorite French restaurant closed years ago, never found another I liked.   I'm trying to think of other countries that have good restaurants here besides the obvious (C for Chinese? boring, but Yummy House is amazingly good)"

We've been going since around 2011 and actually got to hit both the Wat Mongkolratanaram here on Palm River and the one in Berkeley CA which we're pretty proud of. lol  If you ever want a french suggestion. Piquant in Hyde Park is awesome.  We drew an S and we really didn't want to exhaust yet another Spanish restaurant which we've overdone and for sure not Swedish at Ikea.

The flag has been around since the late 1800s and has not sparked this much controversy until it's recent media attention. It's really just the flavor of the month until someone complains about a mother breastfeeding. Honestly, if we all view this as a symbol of ignorant rednecks who oppose our progress as a society and push to make them the minority, things like this will go away. Let's not forget that the KKK marches with 'Ol Glory and you don't see anyone complaining to remove it from anywhere..."

tampa,3b3pgj,BigBadBored,-5,Thu Jun 25 19:19:26 2015 UTC,"There will be hype and there will be people who are butthurt looking to voice their opinion about how it's racist (it isn't btw) and how it's offensive (it isn't btw). Even speaking out in opposition to things like this gives it more power to the negative connotations you believe it to have. Just ignore it, don't be a racist asshole and move on with your life. It will go away eventually, but societal progress is a slow and painful one. Giving race issues continued media attention when it isn't warranted only continues to aide racial separation in our society that our media thrives on. Let's not perpetuate the problem."

tampa,3b2rug,yttlebarr,2,Thu Jun 25 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Get vintage cast iron - Griswold and Wagner are generally good pieces. I used modern cast iron for years (Lodge) and would never go back after using vintage iron. Do some research on company logos and dating iron as ""newer"" Griswold and Wagner are not well regarded.  Finding usable vintage iron is not easy. You will generally have to comb the antique malls/shops for a decent piece. Good cast iron is rare in thrift stores. A decent 8 inch brand skillet can be $30-45+. Buying from ebay is risky - pics don't show the whole story.   Some of the better antique shops in St Pete/Pinellas:   Patty and Friends antique mall Andrea and Friends antique mall Janet's Antiques (and a few nearby places) Antique Galleries of St Petersburg Park Street Antique center   Tarpon Springs   Court of Two Sisters and two nearby shops   In Plant city, there is a nice cluster of antique shops/malls:   Collins Street Junction Antiques and Treasures Rocking Horse Antiques Antique Junction   Palmetto - a little south of the Skyway bridge:   Emiline's Antique Mall Magnolia Antique Mall Feed Store Antique Mall   It's not uncommon for the skillets to be warped. An easy way to test cast iron for warping is to place the piece on a flat surface and if it rocks, then it's warped. I have a slightly warped skillet that is still usable. The degree of warping makes a difference. Old iron can get rusted badly and/or have a lot of baked on build-up too. Don't try to start with a piece that will need a lot of rehab.   I don't recommend using the oven cleaning cycle to clean old iron. High heat can result in warping. I also recommend against using flax oil to create seasoning. It stinks and leaves a reddish hue. There is a blog out there that makes a good argument for flax oil, but I find flax oil to be inferior after trying with with 6-7 pieces. I get good results with plain vegetable oil."

tampa,3b16v9,suckseggs,3,Thu Jun 25 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"Another bad one. The swastika is a VERY old character (Goes as far back as the Neolithic age.) But that's the thing, it's a single character of written language. It has been used by nazi's symbolically, but it's also been used MUCH MORE by Buddhists and Hindus for thousands of years longer.   The confederate battle flag isn't an ancient character of written language. The battle flag was created specifically for symbolism.  According to your logic, the letter A would be an issue because of it's use in anarchy symbolism, etc.  The swastika is something that Western society has been taught to look at with disdain. If you go around Asia, you might be surprised to find the swastika in use for many reasons no having anything to do with Nazis."

The confederate battle flag has been used as a symbol for pro-segregation organizations since it's intended use during the civil war. It is a symbol which promotes racism, pure and simple.  Just because someone has the freedom to display, does not mean by doing so they are 'promoting freedom.' They are still promoting racism, it's just that they are exercising their freedoms to do so.  Fuck it, maybe they ARE promoting freedom. They are also equally promoting a symbol of segregation and racism."

It's on private property and it's no one's business but their own. We may not like the underlying message or intent but, again, it's none of your fuckin' business. People do and say shit all the time that pisses me off but they have the right to do it as long it is not infringing on my rights. It's up to me to not make a big deal about it. By being up in arms about the message that the confederate flag may symbolize you are likely playing right into their hands. It's like the Westboro Baptist Church. Giving it no attention is the best way to defeat it.  tl;dr - Take a look at the first amendment. They are exercising that right.

Now people are trying to pretend that it has nothing to with race issues, and that's just a willfully ignorant thing to do.   About 'heritage' - I'm a Florida born Southern boy and I will be for life. I've worn more mud, caught more fish and shot more guns than most rednecks. I wouldn't call myself a redneck, but plenty of other people have.  I wasn't in the civil war and I have no reason to show support for the non-existing confederacy. The confederate battle flag shouldn't be used a symbol of the south. It's been used for a LONG time as a symbol of racist hatred, why should we use it for some mythical southern heritage that doesn't exist?  That's what I'm upset about. I want everyone to enjoy all the freedoms we have (While we still do, anyways.) I don't want to share the world with bigoted racist fucks, though.

Change lives/opinions when you can but you cannot force it. Forcing it is an infringement on freedom and the 1st amendment.   By everyone being up in arms and telling them to take it down, you're giving them the attention they want. It's empowering them.

The Confederate flag was not a symbol of slave owners, it was a battle flag of some, not all, of the Confederate troops.  And just to be clear, I am a northerner that has never and will never fly a confederate flag, but as a veteran, I wholeheartedly support their RIGHT to fly it, whether I, or anyone else, agrees with it or not!

tampa,3b16v9,QuietFlight86,0,Sat Jun 27 11:57:10 2015 UTC,"Nah man, I'm not the one who could potentially be preaching wrong information. We learned about citation in English in high school to try and prevent us from saying nonsense."
tampa,3b16v9,Dirty_Rapscallion,-1,Sat Jun 27 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the history of the flag.  Point is, flags are...well they're just cloth and I think the hubbub over all of it is a little extreme.  Having said that, I support freedom of expression and belief (provided we aren't killing or hurting others), so I support people hanging whatever flag they want.  That isn't ignorance."
tampa,3b16v9,LC_Music,2,Thu Jun 25 19:28:07 2015 UTC,well how about the fact that it is a symbol of Treason...
tampa,3b16v9,QuietFlight86,-2,Thu Jun 25 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"Well, hanging a flag is not a treasonous act  Secondly, treason is a manufactured and arbitrary crime, not a real one. Real crimes are ones that hurt people or affect others adversely, like a murder or theft...fighting against and speaking out against your oppressive government is not a crime.  I think it's appropriate to note that the United States flag itself is a symbol of treason"
tampa,3b16v9,LC_Music,2,Thu Jun 25 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"recognized world wide and created with the purpose of representing the entire union...i agree with the anti govt stuff, but the confederate jack is symbolic of an era of oppression...there may be valid reasons to support the confederate flag but it isn't even the right one. This flag was only made popular by the KKK when they wanted something representing the confederacy they could wave. If others have adopted this emblem they are identifying with something that represents hate.   The United States Union Jack is not treasonous, though declared so by the crown, since it was legitimized when other nations began to recognize it as the symbol of a sovereign nation...  I like your zeal but that specific symbol is not worth defending imo..."
tampa,3b023g,NPTampa,2,Wed Jun 24 21:52:44 2015 UTC,Just purchased a home last month and we used Mario Larrea at Home 1st Lending. He was very prompt with communications via phone and email. He even responded to emails I sent over the weekend and at night. He also was very good with explaining things to us in layman's terms so we understood what was going on. He made the process very smooth and less head-achy. My sister is a realtor and uses him all the time. http://home1stbanker.com/Tampa

tampa,3aza0d,fmunkey,3,Wed Jun 24 20:10:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about OP, but I personally am far too shy to talk to people I don't know lol"
tampa,3aza0d,NuclearSky,3,Thu Jun 25 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"I feel you on that. I really do. You know that saying ""Punk saved my life"" ? That's sort of how I see the last year of me being in the local music scene.   I was not outgoing and I was afraid of talking to people. I didn't have many friends, and definitely none who were in to music. When I started getting serious about wanting to being in the music industry I decided that I'd attempt to talk to one new person each time I went out to a show. This could be anyone, a member of the band, someone in the crowd, or the person working the merch table. After a few months of going to an average of one show each week I started seeing people I spoke with at previous shows. I started out knowing absolutely no one and in less than a year I had multiple friends at every single show I went to. I still try to speak to at least one new person each time I go to a show.   Now, I know jack shit about music. I'm a photographer. It would have been so much easier if I knew anything about music. ""Hey I see you are using X Pedal, how do you like it?"" or, ""That part in the third song where you did X was rad."" or even something as simple as, ""This was a sick show! When is the next time you're playing?"" And then just attempt to keep the conversation going.  The majority of local bands LOVE meeting new people and talking about music, whether it's theirs or someone else's. No one who matters will judge you for going to a show alone or being ""weird"" I don't think I know a single person in the music scene who thinks they are ""normal""  And this goes for any genre of music, not just punk. There are guaranteed to be local shows you can go to and meet people. I implore you to give it a chance!  The first band I fell in love with was Modest Mouse, and through the numerous friends, acquaintances and connections I've made by going to shows, I had the opportunity to meet Isaac Brock. It has, and always will be a defining moment in my life. A single, less than one minute conversation means more to me than almost anything else. In fact, I'm smiling and almost tearing up just thinking about how amazing that whole weekend was.   I don't know if any of this means anything to you or not, but I hope that if you enjoy music you'll make an attempt to get out there! If you tell me what type of music you like I'd even be up to going out to some shows with you and OP!"
tampa,3aza0d,fmunkey,2,Thu Jun 25 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"This does mean a lot. I really want to get to know people who appreciate music in general and are up for listening or playing. Like I said, I am really shy, so I am unsure how well I would even be able to play any instrument (much less sing) in front of anyone, and I thought a group of some sort might be the way to at least get more comfortable and try.  I have not really gone to any local shows, though I would love to come out to a few and hear what the local bands sound like. I'd be up for going someplace and doing just that, though like I said, my shyness gets the better of me, but there's a first time for everything.   I personally like alternative, metal, and some pop-sounding stuff, but I appreciate most types of music. Some of my favourite bands are Hands Like Houses, Modest Mouse, 10 Years... Moving to the heavier side: Metallica, Tool, Deftones, Bayside... Outside from that genre cluster to other genres: Streetlight Manifesto, Ed Sheeran, Flogging Molly... Can't think of any more than that at the moment."

tampa,3aza0d,fmunkey,2,Thu Jun 25 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"With very few exceptions, the fans and musicians and bartenders in the local music scene are very very nice people. I tend more to the Americana and rock set, but after a couple years of going to shows in this city, it's hard to be completely anonymous. People remember faces well here and at least say hi. I've had Wednesday nights where I meant to go to New World and read to acoustic music pleasantly ruined by running into casual friends.   People may seem standoffish at first, but you can strike up casual conversations with most folks a couple times and everyone gets along.   Tl;dr: I know social situations are scary. Show up, be around, cool people are inevitable in the local scene.  (Also: This city has some amazing and kind bartenders. Tip them well and they take care of you very well.)  (Edit for a second also for OP: go to Rock the Park every month. If you want someone to sit with, even quietly while the bands play, PM me. I bring my knitting so I can be shushed easy.)"
tampa,3az7ya,SkyLineF,2,Wed Jun 24 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   I've been to a few of the events in Tampa and I've had a good time. It's a decent place to meet deaf people and socialize, but keep in mind that there are many students who are there for the same reason. I haven't been in a while since I recently moved to Brandon. Speaking of which, they have ""silent dinners"" at the Brandon Mall every Thursday. Anyway, if it's at a mall, you can usually find everyone in the food court. I usually liked to go a little later than the start time so I wasn't the awkward one trying to figure out where the deaf people might be. :)  Additionally, a friend of mine created a facebook group for that same webpage of info that you found.

I really wanted to buy another Ubiquiti UniFi access point from them, but their ""everything is 20% off"" price was still $124. It's $70-ish on AZ. I called a few times as their sale progressed, the price never changed.

Also, their application sucks, you should get seven years of your life story together before getting too excited. In fact, make a second copy of every thing they ask you for in a doc or something and you'll never have a problem with any application again, ever.   Really it's about networking though. They, and many other companies, rely on outside recruiting for X amount of their positions. It's much easier to get noticed by one recruiter looking to fill 5 positions with different companies than an HR rep beating her head on the table trying to read the job description. Also, if you apply to a company and are later referred by a recruiter, they will toss out your app if they see you've applied previously.

tampa,3autus,XanderCE,2,Tue Jun 23 22:47:14 2015 UTC,They have been doing a groupon over the last few months.  Apparently it's become super annoying because it's filled with hood people with tons of kids.

tampa,3autus,Yaranna,4,Wed Jun 24 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"So this is a project here in Tampa that I have been interested in for a while. There's been very little information about what changes exactly are coming to University Mall.  I found some renderings and a press release from the developer, RD Management. It looks like they are planning of an outdoor mall with the addition of a health club. Looks very reminiscent of the Shops at Wiregrass in Wesley Chapel.  http://rdmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/seminole_center_sanford_brochure.pdf  This would be a great addition to the USF area. Many people in this area find themselves having to travel to South Tampa for good restaurants and shopping. It would be fantastic to have some good places close by in this area."
tampa,3autus,salamandr_,6,Tue Jun 23 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"I live in Pasco and honestly hate Wiregrass mall. It rains way too much in FL to enjoy an outdoor mall. It's also way too hot in FL. Maybe i'm just reminiscing of my mall rat days back at Tampa Bay Mall. I still think Tampa Bay Mall was the best in the area. Simple design, plenty of shops."
tampa,3autus,sushitampa,3,Tue Jun 23 19:30:01 2015 UTC,This! The whole reason indoor malls were invented was because it sucks to go to an outdoor mall in Florida. Why don't companies remember this?
tampa,3autus,The-Rev,2,Tue Jun 23 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, they know, but it's much cheaper to run an outdoor mall because you don't have to air condition nearly as much square footage. Plus I think they think it's hip and trendy.  I think it's hot and sweaty. I enjoy shopping when I'm soaked in sweat."
tampa,3autus,MentalStampede,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:36:35 2015 UTC,They should come up with an indoor food court at the Wiregrass Mall. Maybe enclose an area near that central part of it where they put up the Christmas trees.   A big shade over the road would help too.

tampa,3avud9,Cromulus,3,Tue Jun 23 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"House of Meats on Sligh and Central in Tampa is great.  Shop there regularly.  My gf (who is a manager at Publix) even likes them.  Crazy cheap and high quality produce and the meat is decent and cheap too.    Avoid ""discount grocery"" places.  If their primary thing is meat, shop around and go for it.  Great, high quality stuff, far cheaper than grocery stores.    It's a hike, but worth the trip, go to Felton's in Plant City.  Just as good quality as Land and Sea market (expensive, higher end meat market) but crazy cheap.  You can fill a medium sized deep freezer there for about $150.  Also, spices are like $1 compared to $3-$4 for the same brand at Publix or Winn-Dixie."

tampa,3avjrr,FutureFloridian,8,Tue Jun 23 21:08:30 2015 UTC,I think you're doing this backward.  Find a job then start looking for a place to live.  If you end up living here before you find a job look for a short term rental where you can stay for a few months until you find a job.  March is when the blue hairs start their migration back north so there will be more seasonal stuff available.
tampa,3avjrr,imprl59,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:36:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll go in order.  First of all, Tampa refers to the area east of Tampa Bay, that city there. The Tampa Bay area includes St Pete, Lakeland, Sarasota, and the like.  Commuting is fine. Rush hour traffic might be an hour-ish to downtown, it's relatively bad but not the worst ever. If you're commuting from Tampa to St Pete or vice versa, though, the bridge is pretty damn bad, that is going to screw you. So basically, if you move to St Pete, get a job in St Pete, and if you move to Tampa, get a job in Tampa.  St Pete is not awful. It's a little boring, but it's not a terrible place, it's just not as interesting.  Neighborhoods in Tampa proper are decent. 1k is high, I live in a 2-bedroom right now and the rent is ~$820 before pet fees. Seminole Heights is ok, I used to live and go to school there; it's a little lower class, the area in the square between bearss/busch/US 41/ 40th st is what my dad used to call Cracktown. South of that it's better, though. I live just north of that area, on the edge of Tampa.  Brandon isn't a suburb, Brandon is its own city. And yeah, those are generally the more middle-class neighborhoods, Westchase and Citrus being the higher-up of the four.  If you're looking for cheap, I would go with somewhere just slightly out of town like I did with my roommates; we live just north of Tampa, but still easy access to the interstate. One roommate works just before downtown and it takes 25 minutes to get to his work; but taking the interstate from where I live to downtown is ~12 miles, so it's not exactly a long drive.  If you aren't worried about going down to Channelside (the bayside district) and going to a lot of parties and clubbing and the like, then yeah, find a place that's slightly out of the way, it will be a lot cheaper. I would say you could even try New Tampa, it's a lot nicer, but that puts you almost in Pasco County so you'd be too far from your own family"
tampa,3avjrr,sinascendant,3,Tue Jun 23 22:46:27 2015 UTC,"Brando is not a city.  Plant city is a city,  Brandon is what what we used to call a bedroom community or commuter town. Brandon does not have its own goverment (they do have an honorary mayor that is named every year on the 4 of july based on amount of many raised for some charity or whatever)  If by city we mean it has everything any city does except it own police, fire and goverment then yes it would be a city because they have everything needed there to never have to leave except a lot of jobs.  That is why most there have at least one that commutes into tampa or westshore for work."
tampa,3avjrr,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"I mean in terms of it not being part of Tampa.  Tampa PD doesn't answer calls to Brandon, neither does Tampa FD.

tampa,3avjrr,LogicBelongsToThem,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that you should find a job before deciding on a place to live. You should either live and work in Tampa, or live in and work in St. Pete. In my experience the difference between the Tampa and St. Pete scene is that St. Pete has a bit of a different crowd. The bars there are a bit more upscale, aimed towards the upper middle class 30's crowd, while Tampa's bars are more diverse. You have the younger and crazier scene in Ybor, and then the 20's wealthier scene in Soho (downtown Tampa).  Citrus Park is an okay place to raise kids, if a little boring. New Tampa is good, there's things to do and it's not too far to downtown. It's also not as seedy as Seminole Heights. As far as St. Pete, I've noticed that rent there is higher for the same or less than you get in Tampa.  Check out Carrollwood, it's a pretty nice area that's close to the interstate and Dale Mabry, which is a good alternate route to downtown Tampa when there's accidents on 275."

Now, in Brandon, I practically live at the end of the crosstown express lanes, and in St Pete I work just across the HFB, so my commute is not bad at all, in the mornings at least. I just hop on crosstown, connect over to I-4 and take it/I-275 all the way over in about 25 minutes in the mornings."
tampa,3avjrr,DutchPirate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:03:10 2015 UTC,"I love St. Pete. I've lived here for three years and I'm impressed at how fast this city is changing. 10 years ago this city was a bit more rough but it's getting so much better. I think we have the most parks out of any city in Florida.  Someone posted an article on here about tampa being one of the five most expensive cities in the nation. I would look for it but I'm on mobile. The city's streets are rough due to constant construction and high volume traffic coupled with a lack of public transit making an expensive commute. Crime seems more prevalent there but it's a bigger city.  This is not to say that I don't like Tampa, but St. Petersburg is way better and more of a family town. The commute can be rough but it's not nearly as bad as the beltway. People will hire you as far as land o lakes if you live in st pete. Tampa traffic is generally frustrating because of terrible drivers and the heat.  Edit: did you say bars? St. Pete has a huge craft scene. Check out Cycle Brewing and Green Bench. Also St Pete Brewing and Three Daughters are breweries worth checking out. If you're into quiet leisurely drinking, check out the shuffleboard club with a six pack or wine. Shuffleboard is kind of a big deal here. Check out the beaches too, there are some decent bars and the beaches themselves are world famous."
tampa,3avjrr,tinybubbles1234,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"Brandon. Parents love the brandon area for their kids.  Decent schools and housing prices that cover all ranges,  a back yards, parks, soccer moms everywhere.  built for parents and kids. Easy drive from there down I75 to sarasota bradenton.  40 min maybe depending on how far off the interstate you or them live. Commuting to tampa from there every day is a pain in the ass because so many do it and the roads get a little crowded.  Just like living in say Sugar Hill and commuting to norcross.  Every one does it because they want to live away from the city for the kids but the jobs are in norcross or south."

tampa,3at4iw,foofdawg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"Thirded downtown St Pete. Check out The Canopy at the Birchwood. It's a rooftop place overlooking the St Pete Pier, great views as the sun sets, good food and drinks.   If you are looking for more casual, try something like the Hut Tiki Bar at John's Pass Village in Madeira Beach. They have seating on the water, and live music at night/weekends. You can walk across Gulf Blvd to the beach for an unencumbered sunset."

tampa,3at4iw,Ghs724823,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:07:31 2015 UTC,"Depends which beach, really....They are all different municipalities and have different rules for public/private parking. Some are hourly, some are free, some have daily fees. For instance, there's a small boardwalk park just North of the Park Blvd bridge on Gulf Blvd that is across the street from the beach, and doesn't charge parking. There's no gate, and I don't remember there being a sign for closing times, but look around for posted hours just in case.   At the place I mentioned, there's all day parking across the street from the Hut Tiki Bar in John's Pass for $10, and it comes with a buy-one-get-one drink ticket (worth up to $8.95) so it's basically $1 to park."

tampa,3aroq9,ScruffMcgruff60692,2,Tue Jun 23 22:50:02 2015 UTC,"Longtime New Port Richey resident here. Other than public park beaches there really are not a lot of places like what you describe without access to a boat. There are some sandy areas on Durney key (with a boat) and Cow Key but unless you go on a week night (but even if you do) it will be filled with rednecks and their dogs.   There is Green Key Park as well but that is also a public park and is frequented by the... less fortunate (and thereby the police). You could check out the new Sunwest Park in Hudson but I've heard bad things.   Honestly the Courtney Campbell (a good drive away) or the Dunedin causeway are about your best bets. Everything else closes at dusk and are generally patrolled by deputies.   Not a lot of beaches on the mangrove coast. :-)   There are some more ""residential"" private beaches that are not public parks in Palm Harbor. Try along alternate 19 north of Dunedin and Crystal Beach in Palm Harbor.   Another spot would be Key Vista Park or Eagle Point park in Pasco. Both have the potential for a Sheriff's visit, but if you park and ride your bikes into the park I don't see how they'd know."

That's all changed.  My friend is a music teacher and just ordered like 5 guitars for his school- all were like $80 or so.  I picked one up and it plays as well as my $500 Gibson.  Low action, no buzzing on the strings, etc.  I was amazed.  Quality has really improved over the last 10-15 years of what's being made.  That being said, the most important thing for an acoustic is that it's properly set up.  I would avoid going to a pawn shop or Craigslist.  Go to a music store and have a pro in the shop look at it.  They should do a ""set up"" for free if they are selling you a new guitar.  A properly set up $80 guitar will play better than a $500 one where the action is too high or too low, etc."

It's hard to find a solid spruce top guitar that produces as good quality in the beginner price range!  edit I would also recommend taking a look into r/acousticguitar although their taste and bias may be a bit rich for a first time player

I have Florida Peninsula now. Never had a claim. I had American Integrity before, but also never made a claim...the agent I was dealing with was just borderline stupid, so I didn't feel comfortable dealing with them anymore in event something DID happen.  The only company I would stear clear of is the one, I can't remember the name now, that sends literature in the mail and offers REALLY low rates that should throw up a red flag.

I used USAA (for all my insurance, In a condo now so homeowners insurance is next to nothing, hoa fees on the other hand........) for many years and still do.  If you qualify they are great.  Priced mid to range on avg and no BS when it is time to file a claim.   I filed two claims in 15 years and it was painless.  I keep a high deductible ($2500 on a 150k house) and only made a claim if it was really needed.  Tree fell on roof during a tropical storm,  main water pipe burst in the house and ran for 24 hours while out of town.   I did not file claims for things that i could have fixed that cost say 50% over my deductible.  Yes i got increases in rates over the years but about the same % on avg as every other homeowner in the state and never have they hinted they would cancel me. In 2004/2005 i watched many friends have homeowners insurance cancelled for pretty much no reason other than the increases in rates the state limited the insurance to was not enough to make the insurance company want to keep them on the books.  Bad credit, Low deductible, history of claims and of course the location of the house are among some of the factors they look at when pricing or if they are even willing to issue a policy   Wait till we have busy hurricane season and watch how the rates climb and how many get dropped by cut rate insurers and how many have complaints about the insurance company not paying as much as the homeowner thinks they should get.  Oh and waiting days if not weeks to speak to someone who can do anything at one of those lower cost companies."

They were, at one point, using GMAC to service their loans with a clause in their contract that the loan could not be sold without going back to USAA. When GMAC filed for bankruptcy the bankruptcy courts required them to sell off the loans, over riding any existing agreements. Due to this the loans with GMAC went to greentree mtg and OCWEN. The terrible reviews come mainly from dealing with these two services. USAA still maintains that they WI act as an advocate on your behalf in the event of a dispute but the relationship between businesses was poor.   Now USAA keeps 90% of their loans and the other 10% go to PHH or USBANK for servicing.   Additionally, in terms of originations and processing loans, USAA used a proprietary software program before all of the Dodd-Frank legislation went into place. It was not built to handle the requirements that dodd-frank created and recently went through a complete software change.  I would have no worries about USAA doing a loan for me at this point."
tampa,3apodv,SofaKing_Dope,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:34:57 2015 UTC,We actually got our mortgage through USAA and it's been great. Although I've heard people who have had bad experiences with their mortgage offices. We've been here 3 years and haven't had a single problem.
tampa,3apodv,BigBadBored,2,Mon Jun 22 21:38:53 2015 UTC,In 2010 is was a mess.  I got many emails 3-6 months later saying sorry and they were working to fix it.   As a usaa member since 1986 I have faith they did and was amazed it was such a mess then.  I am pretty sure i got in on it as they were testing on outsourcing things and thought better of it shortly after.
tampa,3apodv,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"Do you remember who they outsourced to? As far as I can tell, it's all handled by USAA now."
tampa,3apodv,BigBadBored,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:49:40 2015 UTC,I do not recall.  I do recall about 6 months or so after we got a letter from USAA that pretty much said they screwed up letting an outside source do mortages and made efforts to fix the problems.  I think the way they fixed the problem was to just go back to doing it themselves.  I have not bought a house since then so I can not say how it is now.  Just how it was about 5 years ago.  Like I said I use them for many things and have always been beyond satisfied so I was really shocked when it was such a mess getting my mortage done.
tampa,3apodv,tinybubbles1234,2,Tue Jun 23 15:46:37 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well, that sucks, but at least it was sorted out. The only issue we had was with our loan officer. She was scatter brain Jane and we ended up closing later than intended which was a bit of a pain. That's the only complaint I have. We also use USAA for just about everything and love them."
tampa,3apodv,BigBadBored,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:43 2015 UTC,"Our closing was also not on time,  week late and 100% our loan officers fault but she would never own that it was her fault and blame everyone else for problems when we knew 100% it was her.    I lost a week vacation because of that woman.  Had a week off to move, can not move in because closing pushed back.  Not pushed back a week at the start,  It was 24 hours,  then 18 hours later it was pushed 24 more hours because something we had sent her three time already vanished? hen again 24 hours for something else.  this went on 4 days till I i told her to move it 3 days from now and if it is not ready to close I am walking away and not closing at all.  Had to take one more week off to move."
tampa,3apodv,tinybubbles1234,2,Tue Jun 23 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"That sounds almost exactly like our situation. She kept asking for documents that we knew we sent her. She would say we didn't send her the documents and we would just forward her what we had previously sent. My wife now works at USAA and knows some people that worked with our loan officer, they all said she was horrible at her job."

Not all agents will write with every carrier.  There is very little direct business in FL for some reason.    I work for a P&C carrier in FL and have done a good amount of product development in the past year and a half or so.  There is a lot of regulation preventing you from straying from that pack, both with rates and forms.  Most of the coverage forms that you will be getting are all standardized across the state as everything has to be approved by the OIR.  They don't like you saying you are not going to cover something.   You will see claims complaints for every company without fail, that is the nature of claims across the board.

My grandmother is on blood thinners and can't risk getting scratched even by accident. She doesn't want to declaw a cat but would take one in that already is.

I called the cops once because of all the drama, and because her ex boyfriend pointed a gun at me, and the police told me they had been out there 4 or 5 times in the last week.  Imagine living life without being able to hear.  You'd miss out on tons of shit that you consider to be non-WTF.  In other words, missed learning opportunities. Deaf people have a different culture than hearing people.  Many are on SSDI.  I know the deaf girl I dated had lots of female friends that were prostitutes, as their employment options were limited.  Anyway, I'm sure this could stir up a hornets nest of controversy, but there is a different culture and prospective here for so many reasons.

Do not rent a place sight unseen, know exactly who you deal with, and scope out the neighborhood at least three times (morning, evening, weekend if possible) to get a feel for it.

tampa,3ak3r8,Khue,4,Mon Jun 22 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm in the same field! Tell him to try and use a contracting company (like Apex solutions) - some places like Raymond James only hire through those types of places and he could be making pretty great money. I sent out my resume to over fifty places before suddenly one day I got six calls back. Try indeed.com, that's my favorite."
tampa,3ak3r8,Drixislove,3,Sun Jun 21 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"If he has that kind of experience, and hasn't outgrown help desk by now, most companies will not be willing to pay him for that experience in that position. To clarify - helpdesk here is true tier 1 support with largely mediocre pay.  I'm hoping that the use of ""helpdesk"" understated his responsibilities.  In 3 years I moved from helpdesk, to lead, to manager, to sysadmin. Very good, demonstrable progression there on my resume.  That said, if he has not done so already, I would highly recommend having someone like Resumes 2 Interviews professionally rewrite his resume. Doesn't matter how much expertise you have if it isn't properly articulated. And, given his career experience, he needs to get very granular on his accomplishments and accolades if he's still working desktop / helpdesk support.  Boyfriends name isn't Rob by chance, is it?"
tampa,3ak3r8,sluzi26,2,Sun Jun 21 02:37:04 2015 UTC,There needs to be a term for this. Like the Helpdesk Kiss Of Death... Lots of qualified people can't get hired because they stay too long.

tampa,3akevv,yttlebarr,2,Sun Jun 21 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know about expired stuff, but we have a couple food banks in town that do food packs; there's also meat markets that have cheap meat as well.   Winndixie actually used to sell all their last-day meat for massive discounts (like 6 pounds of chicken thighs for $5) but it looks like corporate has been getting on them about that. Some of them may not have changed over yet tho  And barring everything else there's always Aldi"
tampa,3akevv,sinascendant,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:59:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! Definitely have enough money to not take from a food bank when there are others who need it; just looking to save some money on a tight budget :)  One of my friends mentioned Aldi!  I thought they were just a cheaper grocery store... What kinds of stuff do they carry?
tampa,3akevv,sinascendant,2,Sun Jun 21 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"Aldi basically carries generic brands of everything. Basically what they do is save money on everything and drop prices. Stuff like you basically 'rent' a cart for .25 and get your quarter back when you put the cart back with the others so they dont have to send people out to collect carts, they don't provide bags, everything just goes on the shelves still in the cases, etc etc. I wouldn't buy meat there, it's about the same price as walmart, but their canned goods and so on are pretty good.  As for the food banks, they're more like goodwill than anything else TBH. I believe the one my dad used to go to was Suncoast Harvest up in Land O Lakes? But they have canned food etc and they have assorted other goodwill type stuff there as well, it's not like a food kitchen  But yeah, I'm on food stamps myself and for us we usually just buy the sale meat at winndixie and canned food from Aldi or sale stuff elsewhere. If you have a decent sized freezer I'd go down to the meat markets though, they're great deals in bulk.  http://meatdepottampa.com/coupons  for example"
tampa,3akevv,gronten,2,Sun Jun 21 04:16:17 2015 UTC,"Packers plus. Hugely discounted food, and sometimes they get some really awesome fast food items. It's hard to find though because it's hidden away in an industrial park."

I went with someone who was kind of an alcoholic, so we hung out in the bar side until that closed, and went to the nude side after that.  I noticed a distinct difference in the... size... of the girls between the two sides.  I personally would theorize that their thought process was ""everybody on this side's gonna be drunk anyway, so what does it matter what the girls look like?""  But, if that's what you're into, you might actually prefer the bar side.  (Disclaimer: I was only there once, over a year ago.)"

It's 5 bucks per ticket and they give you a pint glass (and beer in it) to keep with their logo on it - a nice souvenir. They had several times available last time I did it.

I am not sure how well the race did financially, but there was a lot of controversy over the noise, before anybody ever thought about the Amphitheater. The track mainly ran around around the perimeter of the primary fairground area. There is a crude track outline graphic in the video. These races were the glory days of GTP sportscar racing, Florida was huge in these races back in those days, they also ran at Daytona, Sebring, Miami, and West Palm Beach.

Have her get in contact with a social worker who works with the homeless population,  from my experience they sometimes have contacts with landlords who rent out to individuals with credit/criminal history. If she gets told no ask to speak with another; sometimes they don't share information. If that agency can't provide information move onto another and ask the same.  If she is homeless and not working, have her also do the 211 survey; she needs to be honest with it is scored for services.  She might of also received paperwork during her reentry process on who to contact, have her look through that if she still has it."

Also, be aware that if it IS pawned, and you get it back, you may be liable for any amount that the pawnbroker lost to the thief."
tampa,3acsye,Loueloui,2,Fri Jun 19 06:01:58 2015 UTC,Thanks...good to know about the pawn shops. We did file a police report. Insurance will cover things. I'd pay whatever I needed to to get that ring back though.
tampa,3acsye,thedaj,2,Fri Jun 19 09:46:17 2015 UTC,"Worth noting, if you provided the serial numbers for the XBoxes in your report, those are tracked via the state's pawn form, assuming they went that route.  Any retailer that purchases systems from the public is supposed to fill them out.  I hope you get your stuff back, and the thieves get punched in the face."
tampa,3acsye,varukasalt,-1,Fri Jun 19 11:31:27 2015 UTC,Your first part is correct but I don't think your second part is correct. how could you possibly owe money to the pawn shop for your own items? They purchase stolen merchandise. That puts the loss on them.
tampa,3acsye,imprl59,6,Fri Jun 19 11:03:47 2015 UTC,Doesn't work that way in FL.  They can't make money off the item but they can make you pay them back what they paid for it.  Some won't and there are other ways it can be dealt with.  If it's a subject of interest to you google FL statue 539 (Florida Pawnbroking Act)

If you want to chance it you'd probably be better off on a Friday than a Saturday as a lot of the happy hour crowd might be moving out by then. They also have a little bar area that you can get full service at as well which are first come first serve.  I ate there about 2 weeks back and it was pretty average. I had a tuna steak that was a pretty good cut of fish, but there wasn't much to it. I get the principal behind making fish be the feature, but the other flavors on the plate kind of over powered it to where the tuna steak was little more than just that with a bit of sesame crust on the outside. The atmosphere is really nice and I would like to go back and try a bigger sample of their beer that they have. I had a good date which made things much more enjoyable. I am hoping that I just ordered incorrectly and that they have better things."

The snake blended very well in the scrub brush too. Take care when walking around out there."

But yeah, the whole area between BBD & 75, north of Wharton, was lousy with rattlers when I lived there 7-ish years ago. Bats, gigantic wolf spiders, and tiny scorpions, too. It was like a nexus of peoples' small critter fears.  You don't have to really fear rattlers ... They're not really aggressive. I mean, if you're provoking them, they will strike, but if you just stop and back up, they'll retreat without a fight.  Water moccasins, on the other hand, will actively pursue your ass if you look at it sideways.  (If you're really scared, check this out. It's so fucking rare to die to a snake here, and you have to either be a baby or just forgo treatment.)"

It would be like setting your legs on fire and then just standing there, waiting for the flames to die down.  It could be that the guy was diabetic or somehow otherwise couldn't feel his tissue melting from the inside but the pain would definitely spread, and he would have had to have just tolerated it for hours to reach a point of no return where he'd succumb to it.

I used to live in Jupiter (east coast, near West Palm) and as a kid had a job on a farm. I used to ride my bike to get there, and this place was in the middle of woods/Florida scrub. One time I was on the road to get there and I saw what looked like a scraggly branch in the middle of the old asphalt up ahead.  Got about 10 feet from it when I realized it was a diamondback.

tampa,3aanpa,VenetiaMacGyver,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"Stopping and not approaching is the right way to do it. The only snakes you should actually fear are water moccasins (cottonmouths).   Their color varies as they age (they are splotchy when young but dark when old, they can even look solid dark brown or semi-black-ish), so depend more on the head shape.   If a snake's head looks like a fat, rounded triangle, it's got those big cottonmouth jaws. Example.. They will not tolerate your presence, at all. To get it to go away, stand far back (15-20'+) and make a ton of noise. Or leave it alone and wait for it to go.  All other Florida snakes aren't aggressive, and only want to get away from you. So long as you give them a berth, they won't ruin your day. I literally just used to sweep rattlers out of my garage with a long-handled broom. They were always like ""eh fine"" and slithered off. You just gotta act calm; being nervous and making sudden motions makes snakes nervous. But oh man, if I saw a moccasin in there, I would have just taken a vacation. Those fuckers are like the snake version of wasps. They just like to fuck shit up."
tampa,3aanpa,Crotalus,2,Thu Jun 18 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"The cottonmouth is also non-aggressive and just wants to get away from you. Sometimes people encounter them in a boat and think that a snake coming towards them is aggression, but in reality, the snake is just trying to make it to the next bit of floating debris. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation about this animal that provides context to sightings that further perpetuate the myth.   The bit about making the noise is BS. Just go around the thing or let it slide off the trail. They're not going to come chase you down."

NO ONE wanted to fix it - it was my job apparently to build drainage.  Asked the local Tampa water meter reader if anyone would care if I pumped the water into the stormwater drain in the alley - Boom  bought a $50 pump from harbor freight.  http://www.harborfreight.com/35-hp-submersible-dirty-water-pump-with-tethered-float-2110-gph-69298.html  no issues since.

It is a problem in many areas of the county 3-5 times a year and if we get a tropical system move through.  Most are willing to live with it in exchange for no tax increases.  some want it fixed but forget how that is paid for.   Good luck convincing your neighbors to pay increased taxes to get it fixed.  Edit to add.  if there are clogged stormwater ditches or drains the county will send out maintance crews to clear out the overgrowth.   Assuming it was reported to them.   They can not possibly know if nobody tells them.   if it was my yard i would be looking for the drainage area and clear it then notify the county they need to get on the ball.

We do not have pricing for larger homes or commercial buildings, yet, because we are focusing on making an easy and simple product to help young professionals free their time.  I'm a developer (software) here in Tampa. I was working a full-time job, here in Tampa, and I was so busy during the week that when the weekend had arrived, I had accumulated this big list of stuff that I needed to do around the house (the usual chores everybody has to do -- vacuuming, dusting, cleaning, etc).   I really hated spending half of my weekend at the grocery store and doing these housechores. I kept wishing I had more time to take my boston terrier to the park, build more quadcopters, program fun side projects, or read one of the books from my reading list. I believed that there must be a way I could help free up my time and the time of others for $2 cheaper than my monthly internet bill.

How is that price point going to be profitable? If you pay them $10 an hour you make $4 a week per person. Do you expect volume to be high enough that those margins will be acceptable? Hell at minimum wage those margins aren't great.  EDIT: Sorry for being rude, just interested in this kind of stuff."

We're actually not profitable with the subscription side, the Home Managers make more than double minimum wage.   The $24/week is the starting price for Apts/Small Houses, up to 3 beds/2ba, and the reason we went with this model is to focus on making the service affordable, safe, and really help take back time for early-career professionals.   A la carte service, lawn maintenance, painting/handyperson gigs, and car detailing matching are services that will keep us sustainable.  I hope that answers your question!"

To be fair i have never been in them and do not know how well they are taken care of.  Those prices for slade may have been 2 or three years at least ago.  Someone posted the current rates.  Property values in that area are climbing at about 15-25% per year the last 4-5 years in that area.

The average person might not notice this, but I've moved a lot the past 5 years and I know how long it takes. Also, they broke my couch and tried to give me some BS sob sorry about how it comes out of their pay if I report it. Umm, no it doesn't, that's what insurance is for.  I will never use or recommend the Tampa office again.    The move I did late last year I used [http://www.rocksmoving.com](Rocks Moving) based on a friend's recommendation who had used them.  They were AWESOME.  It literally took less than half the time of the schmucks from Two Men, making it cheaper, and the people doing the moving were some of the most professional movers I've ever dealt with (and I've dealt with a lot of movers).   Anyways, good luck with the move!"
tampa,3a5rdk,rawditor,7,Wed Jun 17 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"Oh man Two Men and a Truck is TERRIBLE. They hosed me as well.   The guys who came were 3 hours late, and were rude as fuck. They scuffed nearly every long edge of every piece of furniture and broke a corner off of a shelf (didn't see that until a few days later). I asked them not to move a large mirror, but they did anyway while I was busy in another part of the house, and charged me an extra $150 to wrap it in bubble wrap. Plus, one couch apparently had a part that needed to be disassembled (I hadn't known), and they didn't have a single screwdriver. I had already packed all my tools and they were at the new house, so that was a fun trip to drive there, try to find one, and drive back.  I wouldn't even have been mad about the damage, as my furniture wasn't terribly nice, but the fact that they were total assholes to me the entire time, and then charged so much, chapped my ass.  Quoted me $350 for a 2-bedroom apartment moving into a larger townhouse, then gouged me for nearly $600 with shitloads of ""add-ons"" that I specifically declined. Managed to complain them down to $500.   Never again."
tampa,3a5rdk,VenetiaMacGyver,3,Wed Jun 17 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"In another city, Two men & Truck also scuffed my furniture. They didn't protect the items with moving blankets in the home and left several marks on everything from hitting the door frames, walls, and whatever else.   The movers should always wrap the furniture with blankets in the home before moving and unwrap in the home after delivery. If they refuse to use moving blankets, tell them no deal. Furniture WILL get scuffed without protection."

The one shining light in what was a scary and awful situation. But I'm sure it's different people at different locations, with different outcomes.  Not only did they move almost every single piece of my 2-br apartment's furniture without scratch or issue (save for one cheap lamp which was loaded on the truck ok, but fell over during travel and broke - the guys were very apologetic and gave me the form to claim the value and get it reimbursed from the company, but I didn't need to do that, it was no big deal) - they also wrapped everything up extremely well with moving blankets, which they actually ended up leaving with my stuff since it was going into storage! So I had like 10 of their moving blankets wrapped around my stuff, and have now used them for all my subsequent moves :)"

I used them again for a full move from my place in Clearwater to Tampa.  They arrived at 8am sharp, had the entire truck loaded within 1-1.5 hours.  Unloaded a short while later.  All in all, probably done by 11:30ish? I think.  The second time around:  They moved a piano, two couches, king sized bed, three bookshelves, lots of boxes, tv, queen sized bed, chest of drawers, dinner table.  They provided me with boxes for ward drobe and I provided my own boxes.  They convinced me to go with 3 people.  I thought it would cost more and was unnecessary but I was completely wrong. While the two guys were moving heavy items, the third was moving boxes.  I will never use a different company.  I think I spent about 150-200ish to move the first time, then 400ish to move the 2nd time."

tampa,3a5rdk,seriallainx,3,Wed Jun 17 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"I've been using Expedient Movers for years. This year will mark the 4th time I've used them and I'm never dissatisfied. They are professional and insured. I made the mistake of using AAA All Professional movers once to help move a single item that Expedient had helped move in the past, and I ended up regretting it! You really do get what you pay for... For having 'professional' in the name, my experience was unexpected.   The item in question that needed to be moved was an a dance arcade machine known as PopN Stage. Assembled, it weighs in roughly around 900 lbs, or close to what a DDR machine weighs. AAA movers showed up with 1 adult and 1 (what appeared to be an 18 or 19 year old) teenager. They were well-informed about the item in question to be moved and how much it weighed, but it was quickly figured out they were not prepared for the challenge of this move. They were not able to lift the machine, nor did they have the equipment to move it properly. Their upright dolly had flat wheels and they failed to bring a flat dolly as requested. Actually , the arcade machine did not fit inside the truck as anticipated, even after we enlisted the help of a family member to help push the machine into the truck... The movers ended up breaking the back door of the machine after mishandling it and laying it on its side... once inside the truck, the top of the machine was being scraped along the roof. I'd say it took them an hour just to figure out how to get this single item into their truck. It was cringeworthy, and overall, a waste of my time and money.   Expedient Movers is always professional (brings 3 adult movers, not dressed in dirty rags like the people from AAA), prepared (brings functional equipment, utilizes a truck with a lift gate for heavy items, brings a flat dolly), and reliable (arrives on time and finishes on time)! They even moved an arcade machine from a 2nd story apartment for us. The movers are friendly and funny, which is a bonus. They disassemble and reassemble all the furniture for me. Getting ready to move into a 3 story 3000 sq foot home with 100 pieces (including boxes) that need to be moved; also moving the PopN Stage again and an DDR arcade machine. Paying $500 (3 hours) for the most professional service I have ever had the pleasure of using. I refuse to use any other company after how smoothly and easily they've been able to move our arcade machines. Never broke a single item, knowledgeable about securing items into their truck so that things don't move around, and are capable of moving heavy pieces safely. For professional,  affordable, and efficient movers, I'd always recommend Expedient Movers."

tampa,3a5rdk,tewas,2,Wed Jun 17 13:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure, though all I can give you now is an estimate. We're moving from one single family home to another in the same neighborhood (still hanging out in /r/SeminoleHeights!), and we don't have a tremendous amount of furniture. Beds, dressers, etc. A few chairs, a sofa, some bookcases.   They estimated it would take 8 hrs, and would be $1000. Worth it to save my back, but not the cheapest I've ever heard.  I honestly expect it will be cheaper when they actually charge. I'll report back."

They came slightly after their window in the morning, but cleaned up in the move itself. Granted, as I'd told them in the estimate, much of the move was managed, we just needed furniture and the big push. They came in well under the estimate. In fact, estimate was for $1000, they wrapped near $400. Frankly, the estimate was way too high.  If there was a complaint, it is very very minor. They did damage a glass lamp shade on a crappy Home Depot light. One of the guys offered me to either file the claim and he'd walk me through it, or he'd go up to purchase the replacement at the end of the shift. Considering he light was $20 or so, we told him we'd do neither- not to worry about it. He was very professional and gracious.  Haven't seen any other issues. But again: we were a pretty direct, light move, with almost no precious cargo.  That said, if all sounds reasonable to anybody, I'd be happy to send you their recommendations. I'm quite confident it all does depend on who shows up to your shift."

However in another city my exgirlfriend used them and they moved her 1 bedroom apartment in a huge box truck completely oversized for the job.  They didn't do anything to secure her stuff and basically every piece of furniture that could break, broke.  Desk legs, chair legs, etc all snapped.

There is this amazing place called CheeburgerCheeburger with like 97 different milkchake flavors you can mix up and great burgers.   Overall it is great. My friends and I would go there for weekends throughout the year and stay in a little rented condo. Those were nice because you could bring groceries and cook food instead of going out and the condo's were right on the beach (We counted 32 steps till the beach) And when its night time, we would just go and lie out on the beach (That could be romantic) and look up at the stars. When we went last time there was a meteor shower going on, and we just stayed out there for hours undisturbed.  Well I just highly recommend Sanibel <333"

There are occasional service interruptions, though they are rare and typically very short in duration. I've dealt with customer support and have been very disappointed by that aspect of their service.   I recently looked at the difference between Fios and Brighthouse.

I've had some slow connections fixed by setting my DNS to the google servers. VOIP phone service has been rock solid.   There are occasional outages, but nothing major.

The BH supplied router is very solid, works perfectly, but the range of the wifi is not great (the wifi is very reliable, just not a good range).

My parents use Verizon from Internet and Phone but Brighthouse for TV since they only need basic cable and in Temple Terrace the infrastructure is still 1990s when Paragon cable sold out to Time Warner. Their house has all new coax and most channels still look like crap.

BH can't get within 70 miles of that deal. IMHO as a prior Comcast sub/sympathizer, BH makes Comcast look great. Their $/mbit and poor down/up ratio is a total deal breaker for me. I work from home too, but I honestly wouldn't notice if I had 10/5. But for all my other shenanigans, Big Red has been rock solid."

Looks like some fans of his were trying to buy it and turn it into the museum. I'm not sure how that went. The address is in the story if you wanted to swing by. There's a bar in St. Pete, The Flamingo Sports Bar that likes to bill itself as Kerouac's favorite bar. (News story with more info)    I can't say I am aware of any local men's clothing shops, just chains like J Crew or Brooks Brothers. But if anyone else here has a rec I'd like to see it too!    My personal recommendation for an afternoon in Tampa is to go to Ybor. Just park in a garage or lot and wander around 7th Ave. Find a place for lunch (get a cuban sandwich), have a cafe con leche, do some shopping, grab some beers, smoke a cigar, drink a mojito, do some people watching, etc. Great way to kill an afternoon."
tampa,3a2b5q,their_early_work,2,Tue Jun 16 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"In Ybor: check out the new Ybor Daily Market. Its on 7th, around 19th street. Lots of mini-stores in there.  And have a cider at Cigar City or a beer at New World Brewery. New World's patio is kinda perfection."

The sidebar isn't really going to help you find independent bookstores or men's clothing shops. Unfortunately, the timing isn't so awesome because traffic getting to the airport is a bear around 4:00. Keep that in mind. Not wanting to get a little sweaty makes this tough, but:  Cultural Stuff: http://plantmuseum.com/ is close enough to downtown that you could probably walk. It's a nice walk too, beautiful campus. Book Store: http://oldtampabookcompany.com/ is downtown. They have some interesting stuff. Men's clothing: International Plaza is right next to the airport and has some pretty nice men's clothing stores.  You should be able to do all of those things in one afternoon.  Edit: If I could only go to one beach I would go to Pass a Grille, go to Paradise Grill, and have a beer on the beach."
tampa,3a2b5q,Tawtwo,2,Wed Jun 17 00:29:21 2015 UTC,I  think he may be looking for something like Greiner's as far as a men's store. It's walking distance from the Old Tampa Book Company.

My gf is in her 3rd year at USF right now and they do their clerkships mostly at tgh so there's an abundance of teaching happening there. high level of elderly patients and spanish speaking pts so brush up or learn basic spanish. i'd speak to a case worker when you get here to get the low down on the facilities your hospital uses."

New Tampa and Westchase are probably the closest thing to St Lucie West communities with Westchase having some of the more expensive properties and New Tampa/Tampa Palms area being a little more reasonable (although a little farther away from things IMO).  Carrolwood does have some similar communities.  I don't think they are as new as the other areas, but it's closer to some things than New Tampa.  South Tampa is nice too, but there aren't any gated communities like you see in those other areas AFAIK.  I would live in any of these mentioned areas (except South Tampa) if you're looking for something similar to St Lucie West."

So I've been checking New Tampa/Carrollwood/Westchase and it looks like a rent on a place similar to mine is about $1000-1200 more a month than my current housing payment [mortgage+insurance+taxes+HOA dues+other monthly maintenance]."

tampa,39xogq,1nt1m4t3,0,Mon Jun 15 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"I used to be a member of Planet Fitness and it was decent, when I moved they didn't have a location in the area (which has since been somewhat remedied). Biggest problem with that place is it's too quiet and they have silly rules like no gallon jugs of water. Because apparently people drinking lots of water from big bottles intimidates people.  I want to like Anytime Fitness but the ONE time I've been to check one out I stood there and waited for the trainer to finish talking to someone else and then I watched him pull out his cell phone and mess around rather than addressing me. Still, if you only can work out night hours they are probably your best bet.  If I was to get another gym membership it would DEFINITELY be YouFit. Any county I visit regularly seems to have more of them than any other gym. Their pricing is among the cheapest and my local one had a better free weight selection than the PF I was a member of. It's a noisier gym so you feel less self conscious about what comes out of your mouth but at the same time it's not for people like my mom who dislike a lot of background noise."

It's sad what addiction will do to a person but if someone has help offered and refuses it knowing the help they will be given, I'm not putting myself out to help them homeless or a friend.   I dated an addict offered to help her get help, drive her to meetings and say there to support her  she the next morning it was back to her ways and that's when I said enough is enough your out the door.  Lucky for her, her family supports her habits and thinks it's OK to do drugs.   I may be a bit jaded by it all, but I over came (still struggle but don't give on) my own addictions. I know it's hard work but can be done especially when people want to help you.  If you choose the road refusing help your on your own in my eyes."

We were out of town this weekend, but apparently a neighbor saw a guy trying to get in to our garage at perhaps 1 am, then failing, then going to another neighbor's and jumping the fence. The neighbor watching called the police, and I think the guy scrambled away.   My best guess is that the guy had been on the street in the previous nights and noticed we still didn't have lights on o a car in the driveway. I've caught some people snooping in similar situations in the past here in Tampa and in other cities, casing streets looking for easy hits."

Most of my friends who do the same kind of boating as you like to put in on the Alafia River (either at the Riverview Civic Center or in at Williams Park), or if you're not on the East side of Tampa, putting in at Davis Island is pretty easy as well.

tampa,39wi8z,BruceBDowns30,2,Tue Jun 16 01:08:06 2015 UTC,"I keep my small 16ft v-hull boat in my garage at home, so if you decide to trailer like I do: Lake Thonotosassa (free) is good for tubing/wakeboarding. My kids love it there. The only thing that sucks is the channel is narrow and covered with lily pads so on busy days, it's cumbersome going to/from the ramp. Go check this place out first and see if you are comfortable putting in your boat.   Williams Park ($5 ramp fee) is 24/7, well lit and easy to get to. It is at the mouth of the Alafia river. You can go a decent speed up to the I-75 bridge or so. The drawbacks of this place is that it is BUSY on nice days, especially the weekends. There are two very large ramps which are large enough to comfortably fit two large trucks/boats per ramp. There is also a well marked very deep channel out to the bay due to the large ships using the Mosaic refinery there.  Davis Islands boat ramp (free): This is my personal favorite. I have never faced a crowd issue like I have at Williams Park. There is one large boat ramp, that can get shallow during low tide but otherwise is good. If you put in early Sunday mornings, you'll be good. It's also neat to see the cruise ships going out around 4-5pm on Sundays; my kids enjoy seeing this when we come in to go home for the day."

For a boat that size, I'd really consider sticking to the trailer. The bay area has tons of ramps and wide variety of boating opportunities. I'd recommend you take the time to explore and determine your favorite spots before committing to a marina. Instead I'd be looking for an inland private parking/storage lot near your home."
tampa,39wi8z,nom-cubed,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"You can check out Tampa Harbor Yacht Club & Marina. They are the only real high & dry storage in Tampa. There is also Land's End Marina in Apollo Beach which is about 30 mins south of downtown Tampa. We kept a larger vessel in THYC&M for years and never had any issues. If you aren't completely sold in high & dry, there are some slips w/ lifts available in Channelside on Garrison Channel and some on Harbour Island. They will actually end up costing more than a full service place like THYC&M for your size of vessel, but the location is probably a little better for what you are looking for. Enjoy!"
tampa,39wi8z,TheCenterOfEnnui,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:34:53 2015 UTC,"I'd just put it on a trailer and store it somewhere. There are so many places to take your boat that tying it down to a marina might not be a productive as keeping it flexible.  Some of the better places to boat for what you do in include Lake Tarpon; the Alafia River (easy bay access...you'll discover Beer Can Island and this is the place to put in for it); the Hillsborough River; Davis Islands ramps; over in Pinellas there is a huge boat ramp at Ft DeSoto that gives access to the bay, the gulf, and the ICW, and is the best way to get out to Egmont Key and Passage Key. The ICW in Clearwater is fun, and so is the sand bar north of Clearwater Beach.  If you don't mind going out a little by car, the chain of lakes over in Winter Haven is cool too.  Source-I have an 18 ft Sea Ray   Soooo much good boating in this area."

tampa,39v4h4,angelsil,3,Mon Jun 15 01:39:39 2015 UTC,"There is a city parking garage just south of the ritz.  over 6 hours will top out at 8.00.  http://www.tampagov.net/parking/info/parking-hourly-and-daily-rates  You can take the street car trolly thing from ybor to the Aquarium and back to ybor (or walk it,  15-20 min walk.  not bad.  Channelside plaza located next to the Aquarium has a few places like hooters and a pizza place.  There is a columbia cafe behind the history center near channelside plaza that has a nice outdoor patio and serves pretty much the same menu as the ybor location. Bolts playoff game starts at 8pm, game is in Chicago but they are opening up the arena here for fans to watch so it might be a little crowded around the channelside area after 6pm."

Head up,  eyes looking around, 360 degree checks,  phone put away, small amount of cash easy to get to, wallet or purse out of site.    If you want to see areas you should not walk i can show you some.  Ybor to channelside is like a schoolyard in the suburbs compared to some places i have walked through,  never been robbed or mugged in my 50ish years of life and walked in some pretty shady places all around the world.  never armed.  always alert and if i ever do get mugged i will be ready to cough up enough so they go away and all i have to do is maybe cancel a credit card if I fucked up and gave them active one not the dummy one i also carry."

Park at the garage literally around the block from the Ritz. For dinner try New World Brewery, Ybor Brewing Company or Bricks of Ybor. All three are within a short walk. The History Center is good for a visit but I'd skip Colombia unless it's for lunch. The Ritz itself is an awesome spot, decent bars and clean bathrooms. I saw an amazing show there, Thievery Company a few years back and it was in the top 3 concerts of my life. What show are you going to see?"

tampa,39rva3,lindsarina,12,Sun Jun 14 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"Try SMART recovery. It's the anti-AA, real discussions instead of monologues/readings, no ""higher power"", no forcing yourself into labels, and relapses aren't the end of the world. There's one meeting in the area at Wednesday 11:00 AM 5109 N. Nebraska Avenue, email ggreen""AT""tampacrossroads.com, or call 813-238-8557 ex 202"
tampa,39rva3,TheMagicalDonkey,7,Sun Jun 14 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"I second SMART recovery. It uses emerging psychology such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), both of which focus on how thoughts and beliefs trigger behaviors and consequences. The idea is that being aware of bad thoughts and practicing interdicting them can result in fewer negative behaviors, and therefore consequences.   It is worth mentioning that SMART always has online meetings, and many resources on their website. Because it is principally self-managed, though, I still find value in attending AA meetings even if I don't have a sponsor or buy-in to complete surrender.   As far as good AA meetings for someone your age, I recommend YPG's 7pm group on Saturdays in South Tampa (Episcopal church?). It's a heavily-attended speaker meeting for our age bracket, and it's a good way to get in touch with the recovery community.   3333 Columbus (""The Club"") also has some good meetings, and I would recommend the candlelight meeting on Friday evenings with the beginner group. Stay away from the 5:45pm daily meeting, especially on Tuesday. They aren't welcoming to newcomers and have a very narrow view about recovery, although weekends aren't so bad.   In addition to meetings, there are some detoxes (most notably ACTS detox on Henry St., I think) that really like to have outside speakers. Someone at 3333 hooked me up with a list of all the detoxes and jails that like to have speakers but I've since lost it. If you ask around, you'll find something.   Lastly, I'd like to add there are a lot of veterans recovery groups in Tampa. If you (OP) or anyone else is a veteran and would like more information about these, let me know."

If AA didn't work in the past, it might have been because you were resistant on some level.  While I think AA is kind of a cult, there definitely IS something positive about having a social network that supports you without judgement.    There are a lot of groups in Tampa and you'll definitely be able to find one you click with."

And I'm also sure you'd agree that having a ready-made social support group committed to keep you accountable and keep on track is beneficial.

The whole point is to lose your inhibitions by worrying yourself over whether you look good in a particular outfit, or if you have body issues, etc.  Just take your clothes off, grab a drink, hop in the pool, and meet new people.  It's a very liberating experience.  To me, a few hours at Paradise feels like a week-long tropical vacation."

The rents are some of the most affordable in the city. And if you find a roommate, $1200 between the 2 of you could easily snag a decent place there.

I’m with Tails From The Barkside Pet Rescue, a licensed 501(c)(3) charity based in South Florida, and we need help finding forever homes for two of our rescues.   If you are interested in adopting one of the dogs below you can reach us at tailsfromthebarkside@yahoo.com. You can also follow the dogs on Facebook or visit our webpage (looking for web design help)     Leia:  This sweet 6 month old princess was found roaming the streets of Miami. When Leia was brought in to Miami-Dade Animal (high kill) shelter she was severely emaciated, anemic, full of worms, marked with scars and sick with kennel cough. No one knows exactly what she’s been through or how she survived. Leia weighed only 16 pounds when we rescued her. Nearly all her bones were visible and she was very weak.   For the past month we have been nursing Leia back to health, and we are happy to say she has nearly doubled her body weight!   Leia gets along great with most dogs and prefers a cat-free home.  She loves to sit by your feet, on your lap or anywhere close to you. Consistent meals and toys are new and wonderful to her, and she enjoys laying out in the grass working on her tan. She is learning commands well and is (expectedly) very food driven. Pics (sorry some aren’t great quality):  Leia’s MDAS intake photo (they had her named Stoney)  First meal post-rescue  2 weeks later  Now 1,    2     Pixie:  Forced owner surrender, it is suspected Pixie was used again and again for backyard breeding. She spent much of her life in a makeshift cage with no comforts or protection from the elements. She was heartworm positive and urgently needed veterinary care. Pixie has been given medical treatment and love for four months; she is now ready to be adopted! With your help Pixie will never need to worry about her living conditions again. This 5 year old sweetheart is great with kids and adults. An attention hog, Pixie would do best in a home where she is the only dog. Pixie is a couch potato, she’s low maintenance and easy to please. Good Girl Pixie is ready to be your best friend!  Before Rescue  After 1,   2,   3     If you or someone you know would like to adopt Pixie or Leia please contact us. If you can help network them on social media we would really appreciate you sharing them. We are offering a free Barkside t-shirt (designed by Redditors) to any adopter or referral leading to Leia or Pixie’s adoption.  Thank you!"

I would try getting on Tampa Bay Musicians Network on Facebook and ask if you can come sit in with some bands when they play. If you make some good connections those guys could hook you up with gigs in the future and then you can start building your own client base.  If you have a good promo video you could also contact Jane McKee of Jane's World. She's not the easiest person to work with but she's a great place to start because she'll book unproven artists.

Most hospitals charge the absolute most they can for things since insurance companies like to say ""yeah were not going to pay that"" so the hospital just charges everyone max dollar to recoup some of the money they lose on insurance companies. If you call and explain that you can't afford it they will lower the cost significantly."

I'd argue this is true in every city, and would be disappointed if it were not the case here in Tampa."
tampa,39461o,BigBadBored,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:53:50 2015 UTC,"I think the point was that it is a reflection of the city.  Most times it is all about where i lived before, where my parents are from and tampa is just that place i live now.  A sports team winning big helps turn that to people saying Tampa is their town,  where they are from, the place they love.............and 2 months later most will be back to just living here and when asked where they are from will say whatever city they grew up in not the city they choose to live in and loved so much when the bolts were about to win the cup."
tampa,39461o,tinybubbles1234,6,Tue Jun 9 11:45:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a die hard Seattle everything fan because I'm from there and that is where I will always call home. Unfortunately, they do not have a hockey team and I've followed the Lightning since living here. I've always been a hockey fan but never really had any team allegiances when it comes to hockey. After living here for over 3 years and seeing how most of the fans are, I can say that I'm definitely a Lightning fan. Even my wife has come to love the Bolts despite being a Bruins fan. It's a great community here and everyone gets excited to see their team play for a championship. Who cares if they are bandwagon fans? Just be happy to have some great people rally behind a great team and enjoy the ride.  Go Bolts."
tampa,39461o,BigBadBored,3,Tue Jun 9 12:13:09 2015 UTC,"It is not just bandwagon fans for sports.  It is the same thing you just did.  Always call Seattle home.  Tampa is second even though you live here and work here.   Try this out for a while and see how it fits.  Try something like I am from Tampa now, it is my city, I live here, I work here, I am here on my own free will because it is a better fit than where i grew up.  Take some ownership in the place that is home.  It starts with the mental part of calling it home. My town, My city.   I myself grew up in a different state and city,  relocated here when I was 16.  That town i lived in prior is where I grew up, not my home. I love the sports teams there and a lot of the other things but my home, the place I live, The place I choose to be over all other places is Tampa.  More of that and less my hometown is whatever and it might make the city as a whole feel more connected al the time not just when a team is doing well. Right now you feel it because we have a team doing great pulling everyone to root for the same thing and pull the same direction.  Why can we not have a little more of that all the time, why do we need a sports team doing well to have that connection?  Nobody ask people to give up love for where they came from.  I think people like me are just saying put where you live and work ahead of where your mom happened to be when she gave birth."

If that's the case then good on ya. A lot of people down here claim to be ""die hard"" fans and then their ""home team"" come in to town and they flip flop. I remember being at game 2 of the world series in 2008. There was a group of people with shirts that said ""Rays"" but it was in the Phillies font and colors. I asked them about it, and they gave me the: ""Oh, well I grew up in Pennsylvania, but I have been here for 20 years, so I'm supporting both teams. Who ever wins, I'm happy."" Our teams are young, and in 20 or 30 years, we'll have a better fan base of people who grew up on these teams because their parents were die hards."

tampa,39461o,Devils_-_Advocate,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"Being exceptionally proud of the place that you live largely depends on how that place reflects your values and priorities. I'm not particularly proud of living in Tampa/St. Pete because, frankly, they're both (seemingly irrevocably) stuck in backward-thinking do-as-little-as-possible-for-the-common-good mindsets politically and culturally. I'm politically active, but this place is just stifling. The demographic outlook is bad for anyone under the age of 50, or business owners, and I can't see that changing.    There are, of course, exceptions to this rule of course, and, as always, your mileage may vary, but that's why I'm not all rah-rah tampa bay.  The hockey team though?  I love and play hockey.  It's one of a few bright spots in an otherwise dim picture (I'm only here for the wife and the job), so you'll have to pardon me if I'm excited about them and not about living in tampa."

tampa,398z4n,boyscoutcookees,5,Wed Jun 10 02:59:02 2015 UTC,1st best brewery is definitely Cigar City. No contest. Next best is a toss up best left to other commenters.

tampa,398z4n,Jagorilla,3,Wed Jun 10 11:56:32 2015 UTC,Coppertail has been giving CCB a healthy dose of competition just recently.
tampa,398z4n,anon1984,3,Wed Jun 10 13:00:23 2015 UTC,"Check out r/tampabaybeer for in depth brewery info. Off the top of my head, here are some worth visiting: In the Tampa area, Cigar City (area's flagship, don't miss), Coppertail, Angry Chair, Tampa Bay Brewing Company. In the Pinellas area, closer to where you're staying, I suggest Green Bench, Rapp, Barley Mow, 3 Daughters, and Cycle Brewing. If you go to downtown St. Pete you could hit like 5 or 6 breweries within walking distance. Check out the Brewery Bay for info on all our area's great breweries.  Parking for the game isn't too bad, especially if you're willing to shell out a little cash. But Lyft and Uber are both great options. I've heard from multiple people that they flood the area after the game and it's not too hard to get a ride.    What else should you check out? If you are staying in Madeira Beach, go to the beach! For gameday, I'd suggest heading into Ybor (this is where Coppertail and TBBC are) around or after lunchtime and spend the day meandering around the bars on 7th ave. Head downtown prior to gametime by Uber, bikeshare, or the trolley.    EDIT: Go Bolts!"

tampa,398z4n,dotyertees,2,Wed Jun 10 13:01:00 2015 UTC,"If you only have time for one brewery, go to Cigar City in Tampa. It's about a mile or two away from the airport.   As for parking by Amalie, park in the Fort Brooke Garage. Don't even bother trying to look for street parking after like 6:30 at this juncture in the playoffs. The garage is city run so the parking is still a fair hourly rate."
tampa,398z4n,millionaremattdavis,2,Wed Jun 10 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to drive across the causeway, the best beer in Florida can be found at 7venth Sun and Dunedin Brewery. While in Dunedin, I would check out Caladesi island. If you're staying in Tampa, Cigar City is the one you should definitely check out, but Cold Storage is neat too, quiet and small. Check out Datz for brunch. And for pre- or post-game drinks, in Ybor, there is a quaint cocktail bar called Fuma Bella that I highly recommend, or New World Brewery if you're only looking for beer. Here's hoping for a great game!"
tampa,398z4n,MsGhoulie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"If you can get to Cigar City Brewing, it's the heavy in town, and there are plenty of yummies to be had there. However, you might be able to get to Coppertail, which is near Ybor City, and is a new brewery with good stuff and a great tasting room. Also in Ybor is TBBC, the Tampa Bay Brewing Company, that is a decent brewpub, and nearby.   If you need to stay in/near Tampa but want some deeper cuts brewery-wise, you can head up to Seminole Heights to Angry Chair and Southern (a brewery and home-brewing supply store). Skip Cold Storage if you head to Seminole Heights.  There are tons more, but these are all a very short drive from downtown."

I know that Vology has multiple job openings for sys engineers as do a few other companies (I receive multiple inquiries a week).  Most of the opportunities come from Linkedin, so update your profile and be sure to join some of the specialty discussion groups.  TekSystems is a good tech recruiting firm, so I'd reach out to them also.  But, as with anything, it all depends on your experience and certifications.  Good luck in your search!

The bigger IT companies are obviously more secure to work for and will typically pay better with better benefits but room for growth is much higher with a small company.  In most states without many worker protections like Florida, I probably wouldn't want to work for a smaller company.  That said, it'll be easier to find a job with a smaller company.  That brings me back to my original point, it depends on what you're looking for."

Instead of calling 911, police said the manager of Rat Soap forced Valium into Martinez's mouth, and he and another man wrapped him in Saran Wrap in an effort to stop his convulsions.  Even though Martinez was foaming at the mouth, no one called for help.  They allegedly duct taped Martinez to a chair and drove him to a south Tampa parking lot. They then used Martinez's cell phone to randomly call his friends to come get him.  ""They could have called 911,"" said Nuzzo. ""They could have taken him to the hospital, they could have dropped him off anywhere and just drove away.""  When Nuzzo got that call, she had no idea she was about to find her childhood friend in such a miserable state.  ""It was hot. He was sweating and wrapped in saran wrap and covered with a blanket,"" she said.  It took estimated two hours for Martinez to die. Martinez was wrapped so tightly, he had to be cut out."

That neighborhood is a little rough but I think it will be pretty nice in a few years.  The development itself seems nice and safe although I would guess you would be putting up with construction noise for some time.

tampa,38syeq,tinybubbles1234,3,Sat Jun 6 17:11:20 2015 UTC,Rabbit ears or whatever cheap antenna is for sale at wally world or whatever.  NBC (channel 8 in tampa) has a pretty strong signal.  Should be no problem getting a great picture over the air.
tampa,38syeq,raddits,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:38:37 2015 UTC,That's not what smart tv means. You can't just makeup features you want to exist and get mad they don't when is not even advertised to include it.  That being said all sports and ppv stream at http://ifirstrow.eu/ been using them for years for out of market nfl games. Make sure you have your ad block and pop up block turned on. As it gets closer to game time more and more streams will appear so you might have to reload the game and try a few different streams before you find an HD one. Good luck.  Edit: don't download or install anything from there all streams will play in your browser with no further anything required. There's a few trick banners that play there.

It was very strange to me to hear college educated young women pontificating that abortion rights were only necessary for sluts and that homosexual men were  probably all child molesters.  I'm glad they're in the minority, but I aspire that 20 years in the future we'll see (and shun) these people for the delusional cultists they are.  At least this is only from my personal experiences in Florida, YMMV.

And since this started from Dunderbak's posts and the OP hosts other meetups (see: Memorial Day) - not the owner. (Also, have met him. Not the owner.)  I think the idea of having regular weekly meet-ups in the same place is just that - consistency. People new to the sub or the area consistently have a way to meet new people. There is nothing preventing you or anyone from hosting other meet-ups in other places, even at the same time.  And accusing someone of lying and deceit is rude, btw. Please don't pretend that was kind or open.  (I agree with your description of Brandon as shit town, but that's also rude to people there.)"

But you are right, it it's located in Temple Terrace area. That doesn't  change the address though.  I never accused anyone of lying, i just speculated that he was a Gaspars employee from previous posts, and made a complaint about how THIS SUBREDDIT treats people trying to talk about their small buisness. I just thought it was funny that if he was a gaspars employee, this subreddit doesn't seem to mind participating in plugolla because they get something out of it.  Someone commented that they choose that place because its centralized. To whom exactly is it centralized, everyone that lives east of 275?   I have no interest in hanging out with any of you, but hosting another meet up would be ridiculous idea because this sub already has one. Why would you want two separate competing meet ups? The idea of a meet up is to bring people together, not push then apart. I just feel like that location idea excludes people who live on New Tampa, Carrolwood, Town and Country, The westshore area etc. Some people don't want to drive 10 miles + to drink. Especially with people whom you never met. It would be really off putting to people who may have been interested until they realized where Gaspars was.  I also wished everyone a good time, i don't see how that was rude when i was being serious.  For the record, Temple Terrace is kind of a shitty area too, putting in new sidewalks, round a bouts and stop lights doesn't clean up the area. You know the old saying regarding turd polishing."

tampa,38mgxg,shroomigator,3,Fri Jun 5 05:24:12 2015 UTC,"Okay. You got the three day notice. Once that happens, you can express your intent to fight it, and your landlord will have to set a court date. You cannot legally be evicted until then. There is no set time, however.  If you are only going to be there a few more days, you would be best served making some sort of agreement with him instead of letting it go to court; if you let it go to court you are going to have to pay the court costs and possibly an extra month's rent."
tampa,38mgxg,sinascendant,3,Fri Jun 5 05:16:09 2015 UTC,"An eviction from start to finish typically takes 3 weeks in Hillsborough when done right.  Most leases state a deposit cannot be used in place of rent as the deposit is for damage to the premises.  A judgment against you will be for the past due amount, any damage to the unit and if they really want to go for it lost rent until they rent the unit again.  An eviction will seriously impede your ability to rent, have access to credit and even potentially on job hiring...and they stay in your records for quite some time.  I would strongly suggest you contact your landlord, explain the situation, offer to leave your place immaculate (then do so) and move out within a week. Explain this will save them the time and expense of going through the eviction process and that you would like to keep an eviction off your record...then cross your fingers."

tampa,38mgxg,MyTankHasAFlat,2,Fri Jun 5 04:15:52 2015 UTC,"If you've failed to pay rent there's not much you have in the way of rights really.  You can try to fight the eviction process, but for nonpayment it's not going to go well and you'll have a set date by the court where sheriffs will come in and you will be removed from the residence.  How long that is depends entirely on how backed up the courts are."

The gift card was only valid in store. No where on the gift card did it say it was only valid in store. They had to send me another gift card and then I had to order. Big waste of my time and theirs.

They had just about every damn part you could need, the majority of them in stock. Initially, you went in-shop, used PCs on site to ""place"" your orders, then turned around to the counter and waited for them to bring your stuff. You could also order online and have stuff shipped. They later allowed you to place orders online for local pickup. This seems to be the best representation of their site form the way back machine."

The whole area has been under renovations for the past few years. The building was industrial and spooky and just abandoned, but obviously still owned and leased. There was a lot of cool shit in there. It may have been exactly haunted, but definitely had some eerie characteristics. It's on N. Ola Ave. by Ulele."

I went with an ex years ago and we explored the place around 1am. I'm kind of a buzzkill for that kinda stuff as I don't scare easily and will immediately investigate anything unusual, inevitably finding a mundane source. My ex told me that when he and his friends were there, they were climbing a stairwell and a window nearby spontaneously shattered right in front of all of them. I verified that it was shattered, but couldn't determine the cause one way or the other.  One thing I did find odd was that the pool in the back. When we first got there and were walking around it, we heard lots of chirps of baby alligators (very distinctive and easily recognizable sound) coming from in the pool. When we were walking out later, we actually shined our flashlight into the black pit of the pool and found it was completely dry and littered with junk. There was no way a gator or its babies could have been in there earlier."

It's part of the University of Tampa campus.  There are lots of stories about that place.  It isn't abandoned, but it used to be a stopping place for soldiers during the Spanish-American war, and it did sit abandoned for a short period of time.  I once had to do some printing on the 3rd floor for an early morning class (Alumni now!), and let me tell you, walking through that place at 6am in the pitch black was not fun.... The doors were all open but none of the lights were one.  Creepy as shit.  There are also ghost tours in Ybor that may be worth looking into :)"

Nobody cares at those events.   I can definitely see the point that the security concerns are a bit different as its an internationally broadcast event and there are over 20,000 people there."

There is an inherent risk, and whoever was flying irresponsibly was being self centered and short sighted."
tampa,38hcmj,pwniess,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"There is a risk every fucking time you drive too. If the drone had done anything like crash then that person would have been charged, but just flying over a crowd is not a crime nor does it infringe upon anyone's rights."

People don't generally think far enough past their own little bubble to understand how much time and effort is put in by local and federal government agencies to protect events like this. This is a huge stage with the potential to be a devastating event which would be broadcast on a world wide level. Generally, government agencies like to avoid those types of situations."

tampa,38hcmj,dudevideo,2,Thu Jun 4 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"I would think they did not come out for the drone.  They were on site or staged nearby and so were other law enforcement personal just in case.  It can be interesting at large events to not watch what the event is and look around and see how much and how many are are ""working"" and not there for the event but to make sure the event goes smooth and are prepared to jump into action if shit goes bad.  Watching the watchers they are not in uniforms or even there in person (cameras and other stuff) always.  the ones in uniform are just for show.  The good stuff takes a tad bit more observation skills.  Always interesting."

Tampa has this really unique way of being quiet when you want it to be, loud when you want it to be, placid or wild, quaint, historical, modern, or crappy all at the same damn time.  There is literally something for everyone here. Quiet, beach living is available in parts of the clearwater area. Modern, upscale city life is available in the downtown areas of the bay. Suburban living and even Rural living is available in the towns surrounding tampa to the north south and east.   The city is full of awesome unknown places for eating, scenic viewing, or other activities which are always fun to explore. The warm weather most of the year also lets you stay outdoors for much longer than up north.  There are also 2 major rivers along with the bay which are awesome for canoeing, paddle boarding, etc."

tampa,38d9hd,fizzlefist,2,Wed Jun 3 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you! I'll make a note of them, and I'll definitely take you up on that offer when I get down there (I'm thinking it should be late summer). It's just me and my wife moving, so it'll be fun to meet someone from the area/try new beer."

Lots of stuff!! Tampa bay brewco also brews right there in their restaurant, too, in the open. Their food is phenomenal as is CCB. 😋🍻  Here's a little guide: http://www.beeradvocate.com/place/city/69/"

tampa,38d9hd,magdikarp,5,Wed Jun 3 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"3 pro sports teams and central to all that is Florida. Orlando, Miami, Everglades, Daytona Beach... Everything within a few hours."
tampa,38d9hd,randude,2,Wed Jun 3 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"The location is something new that dawned on me yesterday. It'll be fun to have new locations nearby that make for fun weekend getaways. 3 pro sports teams will make the transition easier too, considering we have 3 here in Saint Louis (or 3 for now, at least). I'm already pulling for the Lightning! Thanks for the input."
tampa,38d9hd,randude,3,Wed Jun 3 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"You're only about an hour away from Orlando and all that touristy stuff.  Close enough to make it a quick trip, without having to actually live among it."
tampa,38d9hd,randude,3,Wed Jun 3 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I lived there for a couple years. Loved the amount of stuff there is to do, but hated the city. I have annual passes to Universal and Disney so it's great to take a trip whenever I have a free day and be able to get the hell out of that city once I've had enough!"
tampa,38d9hd,CRIMPS01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:09:54 2015 UTC,Great point- the benefits of visiting without the chaos (and being closer to the ocean!). Thank you!
tampa,38d9hd,LHHFMF,2,Thu Jun 18 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"Good point! Especially with future kids. I'm not a big fan of Disneyworld, but I've seen the effect its marketing has on my nieces and nephews. It'll be much easier to make a day out of it instead of a week (similar to how we have a Six Flags in the STL area now). Thanks!"
tampa,38d9hd,dotyertees,2,Wed Jun 3 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how much fun Disney is for adults without kids. I love going there, even going by myself if I get an itch to go.  I am looking forward to taking my nephew when he's old enough to really love it, but Disney's got tons of grown up things, too."
tampa,38d9hd,dotyertees,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you! My wife and I were talking about possibly heading over after we move (which is official now). I had a really bad experience as a kid, so maybe it's time to correct that. It'll be nice for when we have kids too!"
tampa,38d9hd,soapstainz,3,Thu Jun 18 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"I've lived here 15 years and I fell in love with the weather, and although I miss home, I couldn't go back to the brutal winters.   Traffic is pretty bad here, but you get used to it. People are friendly and you'll meet a lot of other transplants. And family back home will always want to come and visit because even on a bad day, the weather is still phenomenal."
tampa,38d9hd,satan_titz,2,Wed Jun 3 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"That's how I think it'll be for us. My parents are talking about eventually making the move, which will help, but neither of us can stand the winters anymore. It's hard to remember how awful they are now that it's June, but I kind of slink into a depression during the winter months because we're always stuck indoors, it's cold/gray, and I only leave the house to go to work.   Traffic is something that freaks me out a little, but to be fair, it's awful in St. Louis too. We did notice during our trip last week that everyone was friendly, and most drivers were patient (driving into North Tampa for an interview, the entrance ramp dropped us off on the highway with a quarter mile until our exit and 4 lanes of crawling rush-hour traffic between us...I was shocked at how easy it was to get over in time).   And lastly, great point about the family. Thanks so much, these reminders really help."
tampa,38d9hd,satan_titz,2,Wed Jun 3 15:07:56 2015 UTC,"I'm from WI and the winter before I moved, I came here on vacation and we had 54 inches of snow on the ground. It wasn't a hard decision to move.  As long as you leave extra time for traffic and try not to get impatient, the traffic isn't really that bad."
tampa,38d9hd,vanessss4,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"Holy cow- that's a lot more snow than I've ever seen. I've said for years that I know I'll never miss snow if I moved south and never saw it again. Thanks again for the thoughts, and thanks for the helping to put my mind at ease about traffic. :)"
tampa,38d9hd,JedisMaster,2,Wed Jun 3 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"Traffic can be bad on the interstates at normal rush hours, but there are many different ways to get around, and relatively easily once you get that it's a grid layout. If you are nearer downtown, it's definitely easier."
tampa,38d9hd,RedSnapperVeryTasty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"Great, thank you! That's helpful to know. We have to make the decision today (gulp!), but I guess we're going for it. We've talked about getting an apartment downtown for the first year or so while we look at houses, so that's good to hear. At least it'll be one less stressful thing to worry about at the time."

tampa,38d9hd,vanessss4,3,Wed Jun 3 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"I've just moved back from 6 years touring the world with college and the Army. My first weekend back and I am greeted with the hockey team making it to the Stanley finals. The days last extra long for now and provide plenty of time to accomplish a day of tasks. The night life is certainly booming and hot damn aren't the women just the most beautiful of the ones I have seen over the past few years away.  But do you want to know the best part of Tampa? It's sitting on your porch sweating from the warm sun. It's watching the bolts of lightning that streak through the sky at dusk everyday. The sound of the cicadas settling in for the night chirping from the trees as the sun sets over the water. Tampa: come for the people, stay for the atmosphere."
tampa,38d9hd,satan_titz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"Welcome back! It must be an exciting time (I was cheering for the Lightning last night...both because of what's likely my future home, and because I'm from STL and the hate for the Blackhawks runs deep). That's an awesome and vivid scene you painted of Tampa! Thank you- that really sounds nice."
tampa,38d9hd,vanessss4,3,Thu Jun 4 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"Best thing about the bay area is the weather. Nearly perfect all year round for outdoor activities. Only gets a little uncomfortable from June to September, but even then, way better than northern winters."
tampa,38d9hd,satan_titz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:25:46 2015 UTC,"Ha, you're probably right. I can't ever imagine it being hot enough to make me want to wish for another winter season. Love the idea of beautiful weather year-round. Thank you!"
tampa,38d9hd,Braineater2448,2,Thu Jun 4 13:41:02 2015 UTC,The clear rivers for kayaking. It's so serene to relax on the river!
tampa,38d9hd,hoguenstein,2,Wed Jun 3 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"Coming from an area with rivers and lots of boating/float trip activities, that sounds awesome and like something that will be a little familiar (though I've never gone kayaking yet). Thank you!"

Music is really important to me, and I've been a little nervous that the concert scene doesn't match up to STL. We're already giving up the tickets we bought to Foo Fighters and Incubus with Deftones for this trip. Any preferred venues?"
tampa,38gtjt,Nyx_Nemesis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are just one management company. Their apartments are really nice and they are very involved in the community. They don't often have apartments available, so if you see one that works for you, I would try to scoop it up.   Can't help with a realtor."
tampa,38gtjt,kickaboutheart,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:24:35 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if she does rentals but Susan Smither with Berkshire Hathaway is awesome.  She was our realtor for the place we just bought in V.M. Ybor.    There are lots of good rental options on Craigs List as well.  Lots of my friends rent great old bungalows they found off there.    Good luck!
tampa,38gtjt,itbeats4u,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:36:30 2015 UTC,"OT, but how are you liking VM Ybor? We're likely buying a place in East Ybor soon."
tampa,38gtjt,angelsil,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:48:41 2015 UTC,"Loving it, we're on 19th ave a few blocks east of Nebraska.  It's obviously good to be cautious at night, a big fence, big dog and a security system are great to have anywhere.  We feel very safe though and have never lived anywhere with friendlier neighbors.    Don't know as much about east ybor but I love riding my bike through there."

tampa,38du0k,hipsntits,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:32:46 2015 UTC,Usually for concerts it's free because it's included in the price of your ticket.
tampa,38du0k,dmcmahan10,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"Parking is normally free for concerts. They open up early so you can tailgate. Take a blanket or some low beach chairs to sit in. They have chairs to rent, but why pay for that when you can bring them in for free. Also, check out the website to see what other items you can bring in. I believe they allow water and possibly some snacks. Sitting anywhere in the lawn are good seats, just make sure you aren't sitting directly behind one of the poles. Enjoy the concert!!  (Bring and umbrella. You never know about showers popping up)"

tampa,38d0ye,tewas,3,Wed Jun 3 13:05:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, they are super expensive.  I bought mine during the pre-sale Saturday morning, but yeah, I can at least double my money right now.  I'd rather go instead though.    The single ticket is for a friend who'd like to go."
tampa,38d0ye,tewas,2,Wed Jun 3 14:08:30 2015 UTC,I missed pre-sale due to work shit :( by the time dust settled it was all gone.
tampa,38d0ye,oh_hai_dan,2,Wed Jun 3 14:31:06 2015 UTC,What did the cheapest seats sell for if you don't mind my asking? I'd like to get two tickets but I think the most I'm willing to spend is $200/ticket. If the cheapest tickets were more than that I won't even bother looking.
tampa,38d0ye,oh_hai_dan,3,Wed Jun 3 14:46:33 2015 UTC,For the pre-sale?  I think the cheapest were $180.  I paid $200/each for mine.  I doubt you'd be able to find any for $200/each unless you waited until about an hour before game time and scoured Craigslist for a desperate seller.    Good luck.

Friend of mine tried for pre-sale and couldn't find ANYTHING in her price range ($200) but there were already some on the secondary market marked up to $380. I can't tell if what is happening is regular folks snapping them up and then re-selling for a small profit, or assholes snapping up a bunch for the same reason (except larger profit)."
tampa,38d0ye,The-Rev,2,Wed Jun 3 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"Likely the latter. I had a pre-sale code (full season STM, so the 9am pre-sale) and couldn't find ANYTHING. Nothing at all. They were all sold out within 2 minutes. That smacks more of savvy resellers than average Joes."
tampa,38dfqn,adsocialwork,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:27:25 2015 UTC,Looking for work from another state is job hunting on hard mode. Couple that with being a recent grad is even harder (depending on degree). What is your market angle for your skills? Do you have any work history?  What was your degree? You need to provide these so people can get a better idea on how to help.
tampa,38dfqn,LilCasket,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:51:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty open to a lot of work opportunities in the social welfare field as I'm just trying to get my foot in the door in the area. I will be completing my Master's in Social Work. My studies and internships have focused on mental/behavioral health therapy. I think one of my strongest work experiences is that I am a US Air Force veteran but worked in a career field vastly different from social work! The job hunt is definitely difficult at the present time! I'm moving down to the area regardless at the end of August so if I don't have anything lined up I hope it will be a little easier then. I've been stating in my cover letters that I am willing to travel for any interviews.
tampa,38dfqn,zeuglasi,2,Wed Jun 3 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"You'll fit in at the Baypines VA hospital or Haley VA by USF. Fiscal year starts around October, so that's when they do the bulk of their hiring. I would suggest looking at usajobs.gov or stop by HR. They would happily discuss current and future opportunities."
tampa,38dfqn,BigBadBored,2,Wed Jun 3 19:31:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! I've been watching usajobs regularly for the last few months! I'll have to look into stopping by their HR when I am down again in a couple weeks. I've been hesitant to contact any VA HR departments just due to how much I see online about how the hiring process has to solely go through usajobs.gov but it can't hurt to get more information if they can give it!
tampa,38dfqn,BigBadBored,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"I know that it has nothing to do with your degree path, but USAA is always looking to hire veterans. They love doing it. They offer great benefits too. It's always something to look into if you're having problems getting your foot in the door with social work and need to get a job in the interim. My wife works there and they paid for her masters degree, so that's a plus."

tampa,38aup8,iam2bz2p,4,Wed Jun 3 11:31:30 2015 UTC,"Just because the charge came in from this gas pump doesn't mean that's where the scanner is...it doesn't work like that.  Scanners are placed in pumps and ATM's that steal the cards ID.  The data is retreived at a later time and then used at other places.  So, it's quite possible that your CC info was obtained from another source and then ""used"" at this pump.  Also, depending on your CC company, you may not need a report...My card was used for unauthorized purchases in Virginia a couple of months ago, the fraud department contacted me and were comfortable that the charges were not made by me, so they removed the charges.  I would not have been able to file a report because I do not know where they obtained my CC data.  I just know that it wasn't me who made the purchases in Virginia."
tampa,38b3c2,curiositywon,6,Wed Jun 3 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"If you live in St. Pete, get ready for extensive commute. This is your typical Monday 7:30 AM parkinglot on the bridge. Also if you're in St. Pete you won't go to Ybor, because it's good 45 minute ride not including parking. You will be enjoying native St. Pete scene which is very nice. If traffic is something you rather avoid, look for places in downtown tampa (it's getting nicer by the day and will be even better when Vinik finishes his ideas). Traditional YP area is Hyde park/South Tampa area. Seminole heights is up and coming hip area, more single house type of residential rather than apartments or high rises. Very popular now and going thru gentrification. Town and County is nice suburbish area not too far from work, a lot more quiet in comparison.   Easiest place to recommend would be Rocky Point since it's about 5 minutes to your work on a bad day.   But if you don't mind traffic, St. Pete will be just fine. It's a great city, with lots of things to do and close to the beaches, but honestly, you won't be crossing the bridge to party/hangout in Tampa. It's just a reality, we don't cross bridges much or often."
tampa,38b3c2,tewas,2,Wed Jun 3 02:17:56 2015 UTC,"Gah traffic!!! :D  Thanks, I had heard that the commute can be rough, so I might start looking in South Tampa first. Thanks for the advice!"
tampa,38b3c2,tewas,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:03:50 2015 UTC,"It's just that we have 3 roads between St. Pete and Tampa. As you can imagine large amount of people moving over those 3 areas can cause issues, especially when it rains, when someone get's into accident and there isn't and exit ready for a detour like it's over land highways.   Anecdotal information, but while i have good amount of friends in St. Pete it is an effort to hang out together. I just don't normally consider St. Pete as viable option for go out on nightly base. Once every blue moon, yes, weekly/monthly nope. They have the same position from St. Pete. It's not easy to come up to Tampa either for the same reasons.   Look at Rocky point, learn more about patterns and your lifestyle and where you want to hang out most of the time. If the beach is your calling, don't bother with Tampa and look into St. Pete."
tampa,38b3c2,tewas,2,Wed Jun 3 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Part of me is now screaming to live by the beach and avail of all the beach related activities there, the other is saying don't do the traffic... I suppose I will figure out a lot of it when I get there, have a drive around and get a feel for the place.  Or I could just drive to the beach on weekends without the commuter traffic..."
tampa,38b3c2,Braineater2448,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"Well unless you live on Gulf Blvd or anywhere else withing walking distance (pretty difficult) to the beach you still run into same problems (parking, driving there etc). The only difference that i have to drive 45 minutes to the beach at most twice a week, and 15 minutes to work 5 times a week, versus 45 minutes to work 5 days a week and 15 minutes to the beach twice a week.   On the other hand, you'll be renting for a year, it's not that long time to survive and after that, you will know exactly where you want to live. Get the place in the middle and see what's going on.   Welcome to Tampa!"
tampa,38b3c2,tewas,2,Wed Jun 3 18:33:39 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking on this, I work 45 mins away from where I live and LOVE it.  Sure I could live closer to my work, but I want to live in Downtown St Pete.  Ybor is nice during the day, but as far as nightlight, Ybor at night is either super sketchy or very young.  Most all of the clubs allow 18+, so all of the college kids who can't legally drink yet go to Ybor.  I also wouldn't feel safe walking around Ybor past midnight.  Tampa has a lot of great restaurants, bars, etc, but it is all spread out.  Vinik's plan which was mentioned above wont be complete for years, so I'm not sure moving to Tampa because of it would make any sense. If you liked the walkability of NYC and the street cafes, bars, breweries, art of NYC, Downtown St Pete is where you'll want to spend most of your free time anyway."
tampa,38b3c2,Gandalv,5,Wed Jun 3 12:43:39 2015 UTC,"St. Pete is very nice, unfortunately for me that would make 45 min commute and knowing me, i'd die behind the wheel from rage attack. I loathe traffic and don't want to get up at 6 am just to be at work in reasonable time. Not for me, not ever. That's why i made premise of the traffic. If OP is fine with little driving, more power to her. St. Pete is very nice place to live in."

I HAD to move or I was going to drive my car off the side of the Howard Frankland Bridge. efff that traffic!  Now, I live just north of downtown StPete, and have a seven mile, nine minute commute to work each day."
tampa,38b3c2,domain101,4,Wed Jun 3 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with tewas. st pete to tpa international is a pretty hard commute. Could be a full hour each way depending.  You mentioned ybor for nightlife.  Totally a fun scene for some people. Bit of a rough area, but fun for some. More crazies out that way and a strong lgbt and punk sort of scene. What are you into? If youre looking for yuppie clubbing atmostphere (polos and shorts, state university feel), you want South Howard. Channelside is pretty dead lately, but big renovation coming.  Downtown st pete is awesome to walk by the water and down central for all demographics IMO. Bit on the richer and older side in some places, but plenty of indie hole-in-the-wall there too. Well rounded. Still, very far from tampa. Two separate cities.   I second rocky point as a nice place to set up camp at the start. Central to both big cities and very close to your work. Could also consider South Tampa (south of Kennedy,  north of Gandy). Don't move north of Kennedy unless you're into getting robbed/stabbed/etc. Possible exception for seminole heights, but only some parts. Be wary.  Source: 27, lived in the bay area my whole life.

I can be on the highway in under 5 minutes, a taxi cab from my front door to downtown is less than $10. convenient to everything except a ""mall"" and I'm fine with that.  The only thing I would say is to check the flood zone if you're thinking about buying a house in StPete. You really don't want flood insurance to be mandatory (unless of course you're paying cash for your house)."
tampa,38b3c2,Asmithpoker,3,Wed Jun 3 13:42:15 2015 UTC,I would totally recommend Ybor. It's not as pricey as South Tampa and it's unique. I have lived in the Bay Area my whole life and just moved to Ybor in December (I'm also 23f and I feel totally safe).
tampa,38b3c2,Freedompugs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the Rocky Pointe area too. I live near that and it's been a great neighborhood to be in. Close to everything with easy access to the airport. However to be nearer to nightlife, I'd say Hyde Park or the northside of South Tampa.  Ybor is in a bad part of town and can be rough at times. The Westshore area is a nice mix as well, with more ""happening""."

tampa,38a5qm,princelabia,5,Tue Jun 2 22:47:41 2015 UTC,I vote St. Pete over citrus park. Significantly better night life and restaurants and st. Pete beaches are arguably some of the nicest in the state. I live in south Tampa and it's also a very good spot for younger professionals.
tampa,38a5qm,qqrosaparks,2,Wed Jun 3 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"I moved to Citrus Park about six months ago, and I like it. I'm thirty, married with two kids. Our particular neighborhood is mostly older, but everyone is friendly and there's nowhere near the amount of snootyness (that's totally a word) like when we lived in Riverview, where I got lots of demeaning questions about having tattoos and such. There's lots of young families around, and I definitely feel safe here.  The area is nice, in my opinion. Lots of older trees and such are much more my style than the matching single tiny oak and palm tree like where we used to move. If it's your thing, the Upper Tampa Bay Trail is easy to hop on behind Ballyhoo's and is really nice for walking, running, and cycling.   I'm not sure I would necessarily classify it as ""fun"", but I guess that depends on what you enjoy doing. As already mentioned, if you need a lift to and from Ybor, I'd suggest Uber over a cab."
tampa,38a5qm,moreyarnplz,2,Tue Jun 2 23:15:31 2015 UTC,I'm surprised you think riverview is snooty. I live there now and I like it so far.
tampa,38a5qm,ChiPhiMike,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:30:52 2015 UTC,"It may have just been where I lived. Maybe not snooty so much as super judgy? Our neighbors were all military families, so each year we'd get new ones. And every time, I'd say hello, and I'd get lucky to be acknowledged. The guy who lived next to us for a while asked me if I wasn't embarrassed to be seen outside barefoot one day when I walked to my mailbox. His wife wouldn't even look at me. I had lots of ""aren't you going to regret those tattoos when you're old?"" from a woman across the street. So maybe we were just incredibly unlucky with living near douchebags. That said, everyone was extremely nice to my husband, since he has a ""grown up"" job and had slacks and dress shirts on usually.   I liked how much house we got for the money out there, but that was it."

Between your two job offers, I would choose Bayfront without hesitation due to its location (assuming the salary difference isn't great). You could conceivably live in or near downtown St. Pete and bike to work every day. DT SP is the most walkable part of the Tampa Bay area and the most concentrated in terms of bars, breweries and good restaurants. Tampa has that stuff too, but it's much more spread out. You could save a lot of cab/uber money by living and working in SP. Just my opinion."

That's not to say it is not good. But if I were visiting in Tampa i would look for a Tampa thing to do.  If were were in the mid-west then you can say steak.
tampa,388wdo,TheCenterOfEnnui,6,Thu Jun 4 20:16:04 2015 UTC,I'd say Bern's is about as Tampa as it gets. It's a place that people who aren't from here talk about when you say you're from Tampa.

If i'm not mistaken, the bike racks for cars that have plastic strap ons are out of the question since those straps can easily be cut. I'm guessing the truck bike racks just require a pin that can easily be pulled out....so basically, if I make a stop home after biking with one of these racks, I have to keep an eye out on the bikes while i go inside a convenience store? I really can't go into say...a target store on the way home with any piece of mind whatsoever? in that case, I might as well just remove the front tire and store it inside my car.

And why doesn't it still exist :|  EDIT-- From a comment on another site:  ""Based on modern topography, it's hard to beleive this existed. Most of this is now Picnic Island Park, west of MacDill AFB. The larger building was Port Tampa Hotel, owned by Henry B. Plant. The smaller building was St. Elmo's Hotel. 1938 aerial photography shows the pier footings where the island beach park exists today.

After getting the rebate you have to get an energy audit scheduled and from that point you have 90 to have it installed.  They're not huge jerks and if you're showing good faith then they went cut you off, but not everybody comes through with it, qualifies due to shading, or simply installs the full capacity claimed in the rebate.  There are businesses trying to claim in there too and they might have liquidity problems or simply not use all the capacity they request rebates for as well.  They usually have a second rebate claim process later on in the year, like September or so.  Sounds like you got some of that pool."

If you really can't afford to be late wherever you're going, then I'd recommend just scheduling a cab, it's not worth the risk."

tampa,37wsic,TomTheNurse,-4,Mon Jun 1 12:23:24 2015 UTC,"I am happy for the Lightening fans.  But THIS SUCKS!  I bought tickets and booked a room within walking distance to the arena.  I bought airfare for my mother  to join us in Tampa.  We live in Miami and my girlfriend and I have been planning this concert weekend for over a month.    I am astonished and dumbfounded that a conflict of interest like this could ever occur.  I could see if it was a new act promoting their first single and decided to take a chance on an iffy date at a venue.  I could see if the lightening had zero chance of the playoffs when the arena was booked.  But this is Garth freaking Brooks!  I can’t believe his camp would ever take a chance on allowing something like this to happen.  Conversely, I can’t believe the arena management would book and allow tickets to be sold to an event when there was even a remote chance that they might not be able to provide a venue for it.    Something stinks here.    Regardless.  Looks like it’s going to be an Orlando trip for us."

Edit: Also, you planned your trip a month ago... When the Lightning were already in the playoffs! Like, that seems pretty obvious you might run into a conflict. Granted, things would have to line up perfectly - which they did - so I can't help but feel that you should've been aware of this possibility and risk."

Seems kind of neat if you get lucky that your stuff ships from Polk County.   If not not in a rush I typically just chose the slow shipping option for the $1 MP3 credits.

tampa,37lg0o,edv1,12,Thu May 28 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"Title is a bit misleading. These aren't really limits so much as recommendations. As the article stated: it is really just a way for officers and officials to have a way to tell you to slow it down. If you are doing about 10 mph, you may be warned, then sent on your way.  Just don't try to burn in 25+ mph around slow moving pedestrians or get mouthy with the cop if they try to slow you down, and you'll be fine."
tampa,37lg0o,Aspencer8111,3,Thu May 28 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yea this is my read on it. They are just trying to prevent road bikers from using it for exercise (18-25+ mph). That would be extremely dangerous in an area where pedestrians, kids, and pets are just wandering aimlessly around. 5 mph is very slow for a bike, but it's more to just make a point to bikers to be cautious."
tampa,37lg0o,their_early_work,1 point,Thu May 28 16:03:54 2015 UTC,"Shit 5mph is a slow jog (12 min mile). i run faster on that riverwalk, will they give me ticket for that too?

I understand why they did this, but a) for those of us who are not experienced bikers, how the hell do you know what speed you're going? And b) I find it harder to balance, and therefor ride, when I'm concentrating on ""going slower."""
tampa,37lg0o,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,8,Thu May 28 14:11:13 2015 UTC,"They obviously want Tampa to be bike friendly. Coast bikes, new bike routes and bike lanes and such. Being a pedestrian in a bike friendly city requires people (walking or driving) to be aware of bikers. Don't walk 6 wide. Keep an eye on your kids and dogs. Don't just stand in the middle. But it goes both ways. If there is an event at Curtis Hixon, I wouldn't ride my bike down Riverwalk. It just gets too crowded."
tampa,37lg0o,mvmntsofthemind,7,Thu May 28 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"5mph is not so slow that you'll have trouble balancing, but it IS slow. I have a small computer on my bike so I've just learned a sense of what speeds feel like. I think 10mph would have been more practical, but that's besides the point. This whole speed limit is just giving them a tool to crack down on people zipping through Riverwalk. I like riding on Riverwalk, sorta, but it's a pedestrian space, not a space for cyclists. It's very easy to get moving too quickly, and whenever I ride with others I have to constantly remind people to slow down. You never know when a little child will break away from their parents in front of you or whatever and all of a sudden everyone is having a shitty time because you ran over a 5 year old. Time will tell, but I think using common sense and showing some prudence, and you should be fine. Riverwalk is not a place to let your bike ""stretch its legs"". If you're out for a very leisurely stroll, you'll be fine."

tampa,37lg0o,mvmntsofthemind,3,Thu May 28 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"A slow stroll is 1mph, a brisk walk is about 2-3mph, you'd have to be doing some ridiculous power walking to do 5mph. As a reference..."
tampa,37lg0o,tewas,2,Thu May 28 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"5 mph is 12 minute mile, it's a slow jog, fast pace walk."
tampa,37lg0o,Rellikx,1 point,Thu May 28 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"According to the internet, 3.37mph is the average walking speed of young individuals (3.1mph overall).  A brisk walk is described as 4mph.  Racewalkers can maintain 8.7mph walking speed for 12 miles."

tampa,37lg0o,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Thu May 28 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks! See, I don't even know these rates.   Plus, all that I know is ridiculous power walking."
tampa,37lg0o,CRIMPS01,3,Thu May 28 16:11:20 2015 UTC,The signs have been there for almost a month now.  I try to walk the Riverwalk with my kids once a week.  For the most part bikers are courteous with their speed and ring their bells if they come up behind you but there are always quite a few people on road bikes really hauling.  IMHO the 5mph limit is exactly what should be on the sign because then people might actually ride 5-10mph.  If it was 10mph then 10-15mph would be the norm.
tampa,37lg0o,Redrum777,3,Thu May 28 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"Some signs reminding walkers and runners to stay to the right, be aware that bikes might be passing on the left and for the love of all things great do not walk three and four abreast taking up the whole walkway.      Of course they went after the bikes and not the unaware self absorbed walkers.  I walk it all the time,  I have biked it a few times.  I get tourist out for a stroll looking around and distracted a bit but some are just so unaware that they are not the only people on the planet trying to use the thing."
tampa,37lg0o,elkanor,3,Thu May 28 20:53:54 2015 UTC,Question: Why not just put a bike lane on the route?  Answer:  That would make too much sense.
tampa,37lg0o,Redrum777,5,Thu May 28 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Because this is what every other city does with a structure such as this, and well Tampa won't have that idea until 5-10 years have passed.  But yes, this is exactly what is needed.  Venice Beach/Santa Monica the entire path is about the same width as the RW and the bike lane is enforced by bike cops. example"
tampa,37lg0o,RuskiesInTheWarRoom,2,Thu May 28 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"Again: that's a sidewalk, not a physical structure. That's a different entity than a lot of the river walk in Tampa, which you would have to construct."
tampa,37lg0o,Redrum777,2,Thu May 28 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"Paint is all that is needed and some public education as to how to walk in crowds.  New Yorkers get it, we don't.  Prime example you don't stop to have a conversation or read a map in the middle of sidewalk.  Step to the side.  You also don't give your dog 15 feet of leash to free roam."
tampa,37lg0o,elkanor,3,Thu May 28 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"Last time I was in Berlin, if I so much as stepped in the bike lane, it was like ghost-bikes would materialize, ding their ghost-bike-bells, and shout ""achtung!!""  My point being... You learn quickly to move, stay out of the lane, and be aware of bikes when the culture demands it. We may be closer to that than we believe."
tampa,37lg0o,CRIMPS01,3,Thu May 28 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"Likewise, almost didn't make it home alive from the trenches in Amsterdam.  Those bikes are winning the war against the pedestrians there!  Some chic riding side saddle on a bike in a skirt almost cleaned my clock.  Good point, I think you are right."
tampa,37lg0o,bhaller,2,Fri May 29 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't think the Riverwalk is actually wide enough for that. Its supposed to be there for a stroll, not getting from place to place. Walking two or three people abreast and having kids run around a little should be okay there. Adding on bikelanes to either side of the physical metal structure part seems like it will crowd the middle down a lot.  Appropriate analogy to NYC: Yeah, you don't walk in gaggles going down 15th, but you do and can in Central Park."
tampa,37lg0o,CRIMPS01,2,Thu May 28 17:05:29 2015 UTC,Exactly.
tampa,37lg0o,elkanor,3,Thu May 28 18:41:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they couldn't ""paint"" a lane for bikes on the riverwalk. It's definitely wide enough."
tampa,37lg0o,mvmntsofthemind,1 point,Thu May 28 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking, not that hard to do"
tampa,37lg0o,CRIMPS01,2,Thu May 28 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Because it is a physical structure, not a sidewalk?"
tampa,37lg0o,mvmntsofthemind,0,Thu May 28 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't prevent pedestrians from straying into it, which defeats the purpose. Riverwalk is for cyclists and pedestrians, and cyclists have to yield right of way to pedestrians, which means riding slower. There's nothing to see here, what they're asking for is completely reasonable."
tampa,37lg0o,CRIMPS01,2,Thu May 28 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't prevent but it will definitely help.  May I respectfully say your logic is flawed.  Why do you think streets are painted?  Do lines in the street prevent cars from crossing them, definitely not.  However, people have been trained to stay within the lines and 99% of the time they do.  Seems like an easy fix to pain a bike lane and let all people safely enjoy the space at their own desired speed."
tampa,37lg0o,sushitampa,3,Thu May 28 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"I think we'll have to disagree. Lines or no lines, it's not going to make cycling 10+mph safe on Riverwalk. It's just not a good place for cycling fast. It's the same story on the bayshore blvd sidewalk. It sure seems like a tempting place to cycle, but anyone who has tried it knows that it's fraught with all kinds of risk/tedium if you're moving at any sort of speed. Painting lines would encourage speed, not rein it in."

tampa,37mj1u,stripeslover,11,Thu May 28 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"Depends what airline, what gate, what day, where they sit in the plane, do they have checked back. If you sit in front of the plan with no checked bags, you can be at the curbs site less than 10 minutes after plane lands.   If you sit in the back, hit restroom or have bag checked in and your bag is the first one out of the plane (and last on the belt) it may take 30-40 minutes from landing.   Please don't be the guy who circling around and part of clusterfuck that is arrival area.

Quite often takes 30 min after wheels down before pickup, less if no checked luggage. Of course, sometimes a plane gets in early, just have the traveller text you when they pickup luggage and/or approach the curb. You'll be curbside in three minutes to pick them  up."
tampa,37mj1u,ispland,2,Thu May 28 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"TIA is notoriously slow in getting out checked luggage.   Even without luggage, from the time the plane lands to them getting to the main terminal, it may be up to 20 minutes. (Variables: seat in the plane, if they stop for the restroom, etc.)  For friends with checked luggage, I plan to arrive 15-20 minutes after expected arrival time. After that I hang out in the cell phone lot.  The cell phone lot is actually really nice. There's free wifi, plus there's 2 big screens with the arrival status. If you wanted to wait inside, TIA also have free wifi within the terminal."

I would bet that the New Yorkers will respect that you made the trip.

If I recall correctly, apartments can't prohibit you from having an emotional support animal.

Not only are they clueless on how to fix it, the lack of communication within their company is pathetic. Each tech has no clue of the prior history. They run through the same routine. They try the same things every time. We then tried to get compensation for this, and Brighthouse only has us having 3 visits, and wont give us more than 30 dollars on credit.  The best part? We refused to pay the bill(we switched to Fios) so they came and cut our service. We called them again in the same hour, and said our service wasn't working again. The guy over the phone turned it back on. But don't worry, i'm sure when i get home from work today my internet won't be working again.  TL;DR If you have the option, don't get Brighthouse. If you have to get it, may god have mercy on your soul. I'll make our wifi public when yours goes out."

There are so many scammers in that sector preying on the hopes and dreams of those who honestly believe in cannabis...both medicinal and recreational.  That being said, the biggest suckers are the people who tell people, ""I'm a master grower hurr durr...I've been growing in my closet for 20+ years."" These are the fools who think they are going to make millions without realizing a high end professional grow is going to cost a minimum of three million dollars to implement.  If you haven't been out to Colorado (or similar) and seen a profession cannabis operation, you likely have a very small inkling of how to run a true business in that industry.  There have definitely been a few...mmm...interesting individuals/organizations pop up in Tampa that were promoting highly (pun intended) unlikely scenarios. Some of them are still selling their wares online and in other places.  That being said there are several organizations I'd consider legit as well.  Do your due diligence if you are going to give any person or organization connected with cannabis your hard earned money and caveat emptor."
tampa,37aip5,GringoGrande,3,Tue May 26 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity where are you getting the 3 mil figure from? I have been to several medically legal states and those operations cost no where near that amount to get started. Could you spend that much, certainly. Is that what you need to even begin the business, certainly not.  Colorado is not the comparison for Florida. Other medical only states are. You could easily get a MMTF off the ground for a few hundred thousand plus whatever the licensing costs. Of course there are hidden costs particularly if you have to buy a property and not rent to begin with but 3 mil is a very large number even with those caveats.  Overall I do agree with most of your comment though. This is a true corporate enterprise, not building a grow room and harvesting 3 times a year. This is industrial agriculture and distribution with high end security concerns and very strict regulation. Not something every Tom, Dick and Harry can actually pull off though they will all try."

Is that what you need to even begin the business, certainly not.   I appreciate you asking this question! The only way we learn is by questioning our own knowledge (and the knowledge of others). I've found that most people miss out on ""extra's"" that end up adding up.  For instance if you look at Florida's application to be a dispensary. If selected you have 30 Days to:  1) Pay 150k for a licenses  and  2) Post a 5 million dollar performance bond. Just in case you (or another reader) aren't familiar with a high-risk surety bond (which I'm comfortable assuming a cannabis related business would be considered)  you will typically pay 10%-15% per year on that bond. So there is another $500,000  3) Have you seen the application? They are monstrous. Smart individuals are hiring firms who specialize in filling out these apps to do so. This is another $150,000 - $250,000.  Since the State of Florida was sued for the lottery system...who knows what is the next system will be. That being said, personally knowing someone who met the qualifications for a license under the lottery system (and this is someone with hundreds of acres). His estimated infrastructure costs to meet the grow size required by Florida, employees, etc. was 1.5MM.  Considering most startup business costs end up being twice as expensive and taking twice as long as expected my personal guess is it takes MORE than 3MM to start a legitimate, corporate grow in Florida when it is all said and done.  I may be absolutely incorrect. It is all speculation and conjecture until it happens. =)"
tampa,37aip5,GringoGrande,1 point,Tue May 26 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"There has never been any such paperwork or licensing fees for an MMTF. I don't know where you got this info from but it has no reality behind it. Is this the Charlotte's web paperwork? If so that entire structure is vastly different than what a MMTF will be based on a comparison of the statutes.   There are literally no rules, paperwork or fee structure that has ever been created or discussed for a MMTF. Trying to infer anything about the system that Amendment 2 would have created and then giving a firm cost associated is a pretty far leap. If the legislature tried to impose anything that restrictive it would land them in court for years and the state would probably lose (my opinion).  Some of these assumptions are also way off. Paying $150-200k to fill out a form is ridiculous. That is over 500 hours of a high payed lawyers time. No chance that figure is real. I have lawyers that were all over this and 50 hours would be a stretch for dealing with that paperwork. 1.5 mil for infrastructure is also partly to do with having to create the liquid form of the drug, not grow it. Some of those machines are 400k by themselves, a cost not associated with a MMTF (unless you want to). Just growing and harvesting pot would not take 1.5 mil in infrastructure.  Please don't conflate the Charlotte's web bill that passed with the amendment for medical marijuana. They are not remotely the same nor will the rules guiding them be the same."

If there is one certainty, government will collect all the taxes and fees that the can. =)   Some of these assumptions are also way off. Paying $150-200k to fill out a form is ridiculous.   Ridiculous to who exactly? Value is often perceived but in this instance I'd suggest value is actually provided. Paying experienced individuals to make  certain the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted at a cost of less than 10% of what they will likely spend overall to setup a serious grow operation?  Quite frankly I believe the grows and dispensaries are going to become quickly disrupted and the real value will be in the ancillary businesses.  I'm sorry if you believe I'm attempting to blow up your dream of becoming a marijuana millionaire. I encourage everyone to start their own business, company, etc. I'm certain you are a very important person who has done plenty of due diligence. I wish you the best of luck!  Edit: Just FYI I'm not the person down voting you. I'm completely open to the ideas of others.

tampa,37aip5,GringoGrande,1 point,Tue May 26 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"Government will certainly collect whatever tax they can. There still has never been any government information about MMTF licensing in Florida. The 2 have nothing to do with each other. I would expect the government to take at least 25% off the top and over $100k for the license but that is not pushing anything near 3 mil as you claimed. That doesn't even get us in the 1 mil category unless you have to buy the property yourself.  Ridiculous because of the exact reason I gave you. That is 500+ hours worth of lawyer fees to fill out a form. No matter how you cut it that is a bad business decision. 10% of your startup cost to fill out a form is a terrible business decision when you can have a very good lawyer(s) do it for a tenth of that.  The way the statute reads there is no such thing as an ancillary business. Anyone that has contact with the actual plant in any form must be under someone's license per the Amendment. The license IS the business from growing to sales, edibles to chemicals. If you paid for the license why would you only use it to set up a bakery and not a distribution center (at least for your own goods) or grow operation? Where would you get your MJ? Another license holder? That makes no sense, it just raises your cost in the long run. The easiest and cheapest part of the process is the actual growing particularly if you were just going to cook with it. Could you run a business like that, sure but for all the hassle you would have to go through would it be worth it?  The ""facts"" you keep listing are just plain wrong. You aren't blowing up anyone's dream of anything, you are just spouting misinformation. You don't seem to have studied the amendment that thoroughly either based on your assumptions. No one knows what's going on in Florida because there is nothing going on in Florida, Charlotte's web notwithstanding. Your snide personal attacks should be kept to yourself along with your bad information and poorly researched assumptions. There was no reason to be insulting but I guess when your content gets blown out of the water you have to resort to that sort of thing."
tampa,37aip5,StYti,2,Tue May 26 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, when it was on the ballot, they were considering to whom to grant licenses to grow. What they decided was that there should be a very narrow criteria for granting licenses. So narrow, in fact, that only ~30 already existing operations were in the running for somewhere around five licenses."
tampa,37aip5,CodeOfKonami,2,Tue May 26 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"Correct. IIRC It had to be a nursery that had be in business for 30+ years, the ability to grow 400,000+ plants, etc., etc. The number of ""qualified"" businesses fluctuated...I've heard 30, 41 and 54 or so. It was also divided into sections of the state...so if you were 1 or 2 qualified operations in the North West of Florida...congrats! You had a 50% chance. If you were in North East Florida and 1 of 5...you had a 20% chance (not saying these numbers were accurate...for example purposes only).  That has all been blown out of the water now due to a lawsuit per my understanding.  Some of the people I consider legit in the industry operate out of Common Bond in Ybor City...they could likely tell you everything that is up to date."

Each item I've discussed in this thread I've seen, heard and been party to personally...it isn't 3rd party or hearsay. Does that mean I know what is going to happen? Not at all. Too much uncertainty in so many areas of the sector.  I do find it highly unlikely that dispensaries are going to be popping up on every street corner in the near future and I certainly don't foresee them being an inexpensive venture of a few hundred thousand dollars. Time will tell however but for those who will benefit from the medicinal side of cannabis I genuinely hope that time comes sooner rather than later."
tampa,37aip5,GringoGrande,1 point,Tue May 26 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"None of which has to do with the fact that you have been confusing the ballot amendment with the Charlotte's web bill in every comment you make. Nor does it address the way I have shot down every cost you have associated with starting an MMTF. Of course dispensaries won't be popping up all over Florida because there is no MMJ in Florida. Once the amendment passes we sure as hell will see them pop up everywhere and for way under under 3 mil. P.S. even when the amendment passes there will be no such thing as a dispensary, they are Medical Marijuana Treatment Facilities (MMTF).  Charlotte's web is not medical MJ for Florida. It is a tremendously narrow law that basically tells certain nurseries that they have the option of becoming pharmacists if they want to, at tremendous cost. It is a poorly written piece of crap that the legislature pushed through to look compassionate.  That law has NOTHING in common with the Amendment and what it said. There is no money, well very little money, to be made the way that bill is written and it will all disappear when the amendment is passed. There is no ROI.  Ego has nothing to do with the fact that your don't seem to know what you are talking about. You consistently confuse the state of Florida MMJ and give really poorly thought out numbers and costs for future Florida MMJ. As you keep pushing the equity investor point of view and at ridiculous prices I finally see where your head's at. Pushing an agenda that is clearly only in your interest and not the future business owner's is good for you and bad for everyone else.  As I said before, outside of the licensing, because we have no idea what that will cost regardless of your assertions otherwise, and depending on lease or ownership of real estate, the total cost to get a MMTF running will be no where near 3 mil. 500+ lawyer hours to fill out a form is just plain stupid. 1.5 mil to start a grow is ridiculous and I have stated exactly why. Your numbers have no basis in reality, they are just there to overstate an investor's importance in starting a business.   Did you even read the Forbes article? It says there is more investment money than opportunity. Could that be because investors like you aren't needed the way you seem to think you are? If someone came to me with the numbers you have I would laugh you out of the building. Bet you want a 30% stake for that too.  You are pushing an agenda, badly I must say, that benefits no one but equity investors. I am pushing an agenda that benefits local business owners and entrepreneurs as well as MMJ in general. I want the billion dollar a year industry (my opinion only) in Florida so I can give people jobs and get the economy going. I want to keep that money in the hands of a middle class work force and allow people to live meaningful lives. You want to grab a share of an up and coming company and apparently add little to no actual value based on your knowledge of the topic."
tampa,37aip5,StYti,1 point,Thu May 28 08:46:47 2015 UTC,"There is a saying...do you want to be right or rich?  You know who you remind me of and it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if it is you? The guy who opened Medical Marijuana Tampa. What a character. Telling people he was going to own 20 dispensaries in Tampa before the Amendments were even on the table. Claiming he was raising ten million dollars. What a joke. He claimed he was ""working for the every day person, not the money""...in my opinion he cared about as much as a certain attorney does.  IIRC he was evicted from his building, according to his ex-employees this individual had no real knowledge of the industry and was an overall goof.  Back to the topic at hand. You seem to be fixated on the money topic and have ""shut down"" my comments about costs. Kind of funny since neither of us knows what the real costs will be. As I stated before it is conjecture before it becomes a reality. That being said having first hand interactions with individuals who are really in the game, not pretending to be someone important, I'm confident in my numbers.  You know what? If I'm wrong? Woo-hoo! Doesn't effect me in any way shape or form. You couldn't pay me to invest in a grow or dispensary or whatever acronym you would like to use to describe a place where marijuana is sold. The prices and margins in that sector are going to be so small in the near future and are easily disrupted. Even more important, marijuana isn't the side of cannabis where the real money, innovation and good for the future is going to come from.  So. Since you seem to insist on that you have a magic crystal ball regarding startup costs and your ego has apparently been wounded, I'll do you a kindness. Yes, your numbers are absolutely correct, to the point of winning a showcase on the Price is Right correct. Your prodigious powers of prognostication astound me!  That being said, I'll lob one back at you. From your writing alone I call complete BS that you are the altruistic individual that you claim you are. ""Doing it for the common man."" Sure. I'm certain you honestly believe that you are in the game. I find it highly unlikely.  Regardless, I've enjoyed our time together, if nothing else to remind me of how amusing internet conversations can be."
tampa,37aip5,GringoGrande,1 point,Thu May 28 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"I have no affiliation with anyone in any MJ association. I was not dumb enough to put any actual money toward MMJ before the Amendment failed.  You don't have contact with people in the game because there is no game. I don't think that I am in the game because there is no game. The fact you use that language just proves my point.  I have no magic crystal ball about start up costs, you are the one that claims to. That's where this whole conversation started, with your wildly inaccurate appraisal of startup costs. You specified actual costs so claiming now that you didn't just proves my point that you have no idea what you are talking about. There is no conjecture here, you gave solid figures that are a complete fantasy.  I have addressed every point of your cost analysis and given reasons why all of them are incorrect for various reasons. Your costs are overblown by a factor of 10 in places and I didn't even challenge the assertion that it will actually be twice what your people claimed because: Business. The only one I think you may be correct on is bonding hence why I didn't challenge it.  You conflate the Charlotte's web bill with the amendment. You spread misinformation about what the MMJ industry is, the laws that exist and what is likely to come in the future. You offer no response to any of my challenges to your numbers. You aren't learning, you are denying and trying, poorly, at character assassination because you have no idea what you are talking about. You are also trying desperately to talk down to me but as you have no actual platform of knowledge that simply isn't possible.  You claim that there will be no money in the MJ side which is ridiculous. The MMTF is the business. The only ancillary businesses those that don't in any way have contact with the actual product. Growing, selling, transport, cooking, refining, testing, disposal and any other activity concerning MJ must be done by a license holder according to the amendment. That leaves things like security as ancillary businesses. I seriously doubt those businesses will make more than a MMTF. In every state with MMJ or legal MJ it makes money. Does every facet make lots of money, no but the business as a whole does or it wouldn't exist.  Yes I do have an altruistic streak in me but not because I want to save the world. I want to provide good paying jobs to people that I can trust. I want to make my tiny little corner of Tampa better for those that work hard and help them prosper with me. That is far better than lying to people about costs to make it seem like your services have value when they do not.  Stop talking to the equity guys and start talking to the entrepreneurs, lawyers and doctors. Even the Forbes article you linked said there is more money available than is being used. That's because your equity friends are trying to make everyone think $200,000 for filling out a form has value. Luckily it appears people know better."

I use verizon but it is paid for by work,  coverage way better than sprint (it is why we have verizon at work)   But you are not getting unlimited data and txt for 35 a month on verizon."
tampa,373v8c,LegitZohan,2,Sun May 24 17:05:44 2015 UTC,"Not brandon but not far and pretty good fishing. Saddle creek park also has a shooting range right near it and a campground so you could drive over on a friday afternoon get up fish, Shoot if ya like, bbq/nap in the afternoon and evening fish again sat night.  It has been a long time since i fished tenoroc but i recall it was top notch fishing.  Everything you need should be on the web site or just call them  Saddle Creek Park Lakeland, FL 33801  and  http://myfwc.com/fishing/freshwater/sites-forecast/sw/tenoroc/"
