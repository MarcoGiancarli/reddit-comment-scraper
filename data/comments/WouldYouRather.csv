Unless you're an addict, it's not hard at all to live without the Internet."

World peace instantly disrupts billions of dollars, possibly even trillions, of industrial manufacturing related to wartime costs.  Fighter jets and bombers, firearms and ammunition.  Prisons would be next to empty (actually, that's a goal).  Hundreds of millions of armed service members across the globe would become jobless overnight.  You would indirectly end all illicit narcotics trading (who knows, maybe this means we see progress in the way Portugal has since decriminalization of drugs).  Border security would simply be a formality to keep track of the number of people in each country at any point in time.  Petroleum and oil companies would flounder under reduced crude oil prices due to cooperating nations with public investments in natural resources.    The humanitarian effect, though?  Invaluable.  Priceless.  No more murder.  No more rape.  ""Developing"" nations and communities would begin to flourish under the helping hand of more financially able neighbors.  Schools would be built like Starbucks.  Hospitals like Hardee's.  The entire public interest sector would be flooded in opportunities to improve infrastructure throughout the world.  People could travel freely across borders without fear of racial, religious, or sexual persecution.  No more parents and siblings wondering if their family will die in a war that day or get blown up by a mortar.  We could get rid of every government agency currently taking advantage of *fear** that they've self imposed on their nations.  NSA. Gone. TSA. GONE. FBI, CIA, NCIS, Department of Homeland Security.  ALL GONE.  There would be no need for them.  The half a trillion dollars we budget *per year in the US alone on military spending could be freed up to send more than 500 space probes just like New Horizons to the farthest reaches of our solar system.  Each. Year.   Excessive, right?   So spend it on advancing healthcare, mining the moon and asteroids.  Begin studies on the terraformation of planets.  Gain control of climate change and begin to manipulate the environment to suit our needs as we see fit with crop production, droughts, flooding.  Gain full control of our planet's climate in under a century.  Move on to Mars.  Do the same on a large scale project (by the way, we've been on Mars in vast biospheres for a long time at this point).    Realize that solar, wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear energy will forever be safer alternatives to fossil fuels and natural gas.  Accomplish localized, small scale, contained nuclear fusion as a means of powering vehicles.  All of this without fear of weaponizing our new advancements.

After inheriting my perfect Chess mind, I'd take out a large bank loan and open up a High Stakes Chess Tournament. I'd pay top dollar to begin promoting it and set up an annual tournament where people from all over the world could enter and bet insane amounts of money that they would win and take home the whole pot.  Since I would be creating the arena, I'd also set an admission price that I would take a huge cut from, and an in-house betting system that I would take my cut from as well. The money for me would be coming in from both sides: the Competitors and the Spectators!  Of course, I would always win. I'd make it an annual tournament so that it would take a while for the Chess World to brand me as ""Unbeatable""...and once this happened, I would see a huge decline in both competition and spectators at my event....so I'd change the rules. Now players can create and use Chess Computers to play for them in the tournament. They can only use ones that they themselves created, but given the fact that most of the competition would be rich and that they'd have an entire year to build it, I figure they'd find new heart and re-enter in hopes of beating me. Plus, now I'd have even MORE competitors because not only would Chess players enter my tournament, but engineers, math wizards, hopeful nerds and the like would toss their hat in the ring in an attempt to win the big prize! That and I'm sure inbetween tournaments they would play against eachother in other Chess Leagues that would be sure to crop up in the wake of my tournaments creation...which means that the spectators would have reliable statistics going in to bet at my tournament, making them think they know who will win.  But I'll win. Every time.  Once again, after a couple of years, people will completely lose hope in beating me at Chess...I mean, I'm literally unbeatable! What could they do to win? But then once we've reached this point, what could I do to continue my tournament with no competition??? Easy. Do what no one expects.  Quit.  I'd take myself out of the tournament and allow the players to have a clean competition in which to play and they'd re-enter believing so...but they still wont. Because I'll have a proxy...and now he'll win and I'll take 70% of his winnings...30% is more than enough to keep him/her quiet about my secret and to retire far, far away. Different proxy every year with some off-years to let the other competitors win? I'd say I'd have more than a billion by the time I was dead...or at least enough that I could live a very lavish life-style for the rest of my life."

I'd much rather be Batman for that reason. Everyone knows Batman is human and can't fly to the other side of the world in an instant.

With the ability to deliver a blow of up to 100 tons, the Creusot hammer was the most powerful in the world until 1891, when the Bethlehem Iron Company of the United States purchased patent rights from Schneider and built a steam hammer of almost identical design but capable of delivering a 125 ton blow.  The Creusot hammer still exists, although it is no longer operational, and is a tourist attraction in the town of Le Creusot where it was built. With few remaining rivals, the hammer today is once again the largest of its kind in the world.  The Creusot steam hammer was named a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1981.

WouldYouRather,3cvisb,marioman63,2,Sat Jul 11 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"so for option 2, would our entire population of 7 billion exist, no matter the world? cause i can think of a couple that would cause problems in, and could really fuck up the events in said worlds, although it would be interesting to watch  either way, i think it would be the mushroom world, or mobius (as seen in the comics, pre super genesis wave, cause fuck that shit), but option 1 and 2 would both be interesting decisions.  for option 1, not much would change. at least with the mushroom world, a semblance of modern society would still exist (they have skyscrapers, airplanes, cars, TV, computers, etc, but with a monarchy of the more traditional style). wouldnt need to worry about access to latent powers, as there isnt really any there. there is no indication that the universe is what provides increased athletic abilities seen in most citizens, and anyone can access powerups if they can obtain them. being dropped in with nothing wont be an issue, since money lies around every corner. there is of course the looming danger of bowser, but thats a non-issue. not once has the entire world been close to decimation, so its fairly safe.  option one for mobius would be a bit more dangerous. luckily, as a human, id be welcome in the once safe haven on the planet for the minority race, assuming i can get there. except for that one time, station square is a fairly safe place, and pretty much out of the way of eggman's terror, or the freedom fighters. obviously this would be the more boring option, since adventure would be out of the question, but society for me would be exactly the same as it would be here. however, i guess in that world, having a power would be a good idea. while unlikely to ever be used, being granted the knowledge necessary to control the chaos emeralds would be cool (in the comics at least, only certain people know how to use them, but it would be highly unlikely for me to ever obtain even one). id would say super speed, but its uncertain if thats a common occurance in the comics. only sonic ever really demonstrates it.  so i guess the mushroom kingdom would be the better option  for option 2, having everyone dropped into the mushroom planet might not be a good idea. extra precautions would be needed to keep criminals from obtaining items of power, especially things like starmen, fire flowers or super mushrooms. the sudden increase in population, plus the appearance of ""alien"" species (mushroom planet denizens that are not human) might put the governments of our world on edge. however, given the huge popularity of mario games, the land may not be as strange as one would expect at first. at least bowser would be controlled by our world governments, if given the opportunity. overpopulation might be an issue, but the exact landmass or climates of this world are unknown, so its possible everyone would be fine, but its also possible most people are fucked due to being stuck in a desert, tundra, or lava wasteland. while there are cities, there is plenty of uncharted territory as well.   mobius is a more complicated affair. since mobius is a future earth, the land size, climate, etc would be about the same (however, its far enough in the future that continents have slightly shifted. not a big deal though), so everyone would fit. however, the human race has changed immensely since the 21st century. actual humans are a really small minority, and for mobians and overlanders, are also a bit undocumented. considering how militeristic some of our countries are, im sure they could get along just fine with overlanders, but most likely cause a world war 3 of sorts for control of territory, consisting of outlanders (mainly eggman) vs the newly landed humans. hard to tell where mobians would stand in this, but i guess it depends if we end up being hostile towards them or not. i would say a lot of humans would get wiped out either way, as our technology is vastly inferior to that of the overlanders. plus, if mobians decide to turn on us, they would have many objects of power to use that we would know nothing about. genocide against one race would be committed, and it would most likely be us. station square would possibly be wiped out, as they may be treated the same way when they find out how we react (even though the ancients are considered peaceful, and try to stay out of world affairs iirc).  hard to tell which would be better for option 2, as both consist of ""contaminating"" the new world in one way or another, and not in any minor way. the consequences of merging with the mushroom world seem less severe however.  for fun, ill divulge into OP's examples for option 2 as well:  in the case of pokemon, i doubt much would happen. the world as we know it may not change that much, since modern humans are still the dominant species. religions might clash (arceus vs the christian god for sure), and may have dire consequences, but otherwise people will likely get used to it. it is hard to tell what the landmass of the pokemon world is like, so it is uncertain if overpopulation would be an issue, or if people will be stuck in extreme conditions, such as stranded in the ocean (of which there seems to be a lot of). our ways of dealing with crime might clash with theirs, but it could allow us to take out many of the mafia-like organizations that inhabit their world (i mean, its obvious pokemon battles hardly solve shit).  for middle earth, it would be very different. im thinking something like gate will occur. the one ring might be heading to mordor, but not for long. give us a bit and we will have society up and running again. no idea what the rest of the planet is like though (is that even documented anywhere?). still, our tech would destroy any weapons they have, and i dont think even gandalf would stand a chance. this is of course assuming we dont choose peace, but if 7 billion humans suddenly show up in a world thats dominated by other humanoid creatures, i dont think the natives would be too happy. not to mention the dragons and other monsters that would attack. violence is inevitable."

Think of it more as two separate relaitws or dimensions, grafted together. Like putting a sheet of paper on another sheep of paper. The kinks would sort themselves out as best as logic and physics would allow them. For instance Mordor might just replace Mt. st. Helens, since they could both potentially serve as a great famous volcano. All the details of how the worlds clash are of no real concern unless those details interest you, in which case by all means I would love to read how you think they would overlay.

When he logs into his PC, trigger your power. Now you have the manager's bank login credentials. Or work your way up through Wall Street if you want to stay ""legal"".  It doesn't have to be random thoughts. You can lead a person or persons into thinking something, then pick up those thoughts.

Either way I could set up some kind of transport service where people send me videos of themselves so I can pull them into the place. And what if it's a video of myself?

If fantasy stuff still works, that one. Pull out a magic item to allow shapeshifting.   If fantasy and people work, I'll pull out some characters from some things. They won't even have to resent me for tearing them from their homes, because I'll make a short film about a magic item that can return things pulled from televisions to their home.  If fantasy items do not function, I'll go with the shapeshifting. I will then shapeshift into someone capable of doing the above. I can already think of several examples. This is unlikely to be necessary, however — since shapeshifting is clearly possible in this scenario, there is no reason other magic should not function."

So it would sort of be a physiological (versus physical) addiction, or lifestyle addiction if you want to call it that. I don't know if those kinds of effects are outlawed, but I couldn't image a scenario where they were.  tl;dr To feel and/or enjoy the effects of drugs and alcohol (even if it's physically harmless) you would still have to be fucked up, which could hurt you in other areas."

They're pretty much not a huge deal like your grandma and pastor want you to think. The majority of them can be cured with antibiotics. Even when you do get them, it is rare that they are as severe as the mutilated genital pics that they show. Those are worst case scenario. Herpes for example, doesn't show symptoms in most people who get it. It's very rare for those that do get breakouts to have more than 2 in their lifetime. While they can certainly cause a lot of problems and are also evolving to become worse, they're really not as scary as they're made out to be. It's just important to get checked every now and then to catch them early in the case that you do get one."

I mean even if you dont have symptoms you still carry that shit for LIFE. Like you will always have it, always. That freaks me out soo much.

WouldYouRather,3brci0,MamaTR,4,Wed Jul 1 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"I feel you there. And don't get me wrong, I certainly wouldn't want to get herpes, but it would be the stigma that is more likely to cause you trouble than the actual disease. It is worse for women though, as they also have to worry about spreading it to their future children.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is that it's not really worth worrying over too much so long as you're using protection."
