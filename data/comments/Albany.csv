I used David Phaff, and can't say enough about him. My favorite thing about him is that when he's showing you a house, he will tell you if it's not right for you. I've worked with Realtors who say ""Oh, this is your house!"" at every place we see. It's completely unhelpful. David is not looking to sell you just any house, he's making sure it's exactly what you're looking for. He used to be in the construction/contracting industry, so he knows just by looking at it what kind of condition a house may be in structurally, and he'll tell you."

Albany,3dyp2e,drsfmd,6,Mon Jul 20 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"Algae. Times of high temperatures, flash flooding, high water levels etc all promote growth of algae in reservoirs, water towers etc. While the water is fine to drink once it has been treated, the algae produce some chemicals that produce a dirt taste and smell. These odors are released from the water faster when it is hot. They are easily removed with your standard carbon filter found in water pitchers.   Unless you are seeing sediment in your water you are not getting dirt infiltrating pipes. Water mains are very high pressure.  Water goes out, not in."

Albany,3dyp2e,dericknoetzel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:50 2015 UTC,I wrote a story on Albany's sewer system about a year ago for school. This may not answer your question because I'm not a professional but I learned from the union working on a main break that much of the city hasn't had a new sewer for 200 years. There are wooden/ceramic mains and then lead pipes going to most/all houses.   Bare in mind that my story was on the Pine Hills neighborhood.   Water mains can't stop breaking because they are so old and they are being replaced by PVC (super tough plastic) so my guess would be since the water is passing through a new pipe it just tastes different.   Or there is exposed ground in the pipes and you're getting some tasty dirt.
Albany,3dyp2e,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"It tastes fine, and I should have pointed out that the cold water has no odor that I can detect, but when heated it smells like... dirt."

I've not been nice to my knees before or after the injuries, and being overweight does not help. So, my knees are somewhat … crunchy … due to accumulated cartilage abuse.   BUT, that is despite excellent treatment from Dr. Flik. And the big, whoop-dee-do surgery I had, my ACL reconstruction, has been trouble-free.

You don't have to be a.patient of Ortho NY to use them. But think how many times have you heard of someone going to urgent care or the ER with a sprain or broken what ever only to be told its nothing, then have to go to an Ortho to find out its broken. Those places are a thing of beauty."

Albany,3dxyrk,Loudonville,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"You definitely need their number then with two young children :)  But spread the word because most people are unaware. Nothing against Urgent Cares, they keep you out of the ER and are general docs....   but they just aren't specialists in that area. It makes sense to have Urgent Care for that type of urgent medicine since so many urgent things tend to be sprains, breaks, knee and joint things due to falls,  etc.    I used them for my knee one time when I was on the way into my PT for my knee, fell and wrenched that knee (sadly enough). My PT was the one who told me about them. My PT told me a regular ER would just say, maybe a sprain which was probably right generally.   ORTHO NY did their XRAYS and said I moved my knee cap over when I fell, and something else I can't remember. They did a script for a brace, gave it to me and sent me on my way. They also sent the log notes and X rays on over to the PT so she could see how far my knee cap was out of wack.   I feel like if I had walked in to the ER up the road I would have been given an ice pack and sent on my way; fucked up knee cap and all. lol  TL/DR If you have an Urgent Care fall, sprain, fracture, twisted joint, bruised bone, etc. head to ORTHO NY Urgent care because they have an Ortho on call and that's all they do."

I've not been to all of these cities, and these are not based in research, just gut feel, but these are among the first I'd start to research if I were in your position.

Albany,3dvmip,cjfinn3r,4,Mon Jul 20 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"Hi. I've travelled all across the US.   Austin, Texas is probably your best bet for a 'warm' Albany. Young, liberal population, tons of live music and culture. Like Albany, it's surrounded by 'nothing' (and conservatives) if you travel 10 miles outside of it. Seriously, it's not like the rest of Texas.  Portland, Oregon - mild winters, young and very diverse population, the whole city is a 'Lark Street'. Even the architecture felt similar. It has a huge under-employment problem, but so do many hip-cities.   Sacramento, California. California's Albany. Similar population density, demographics. Kinda boring, though.   Asheville, North Carolina. More like a 'Saratoga' than Albany, but it's a little beacon of liberalism and culture in the middle of -FUCK-NOWHERE-. Surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. Beautiful place.   Just gonna throw this out there: Oxford, Mississippi. Another weird beacon of youthfulness and culture in an otherwise dead-redneck-shithole. It's a really cool place."

Probably the closest bar that will have a similar demographic. Also check out Nanola in Malta, wide tap selection and a decent crowd. Finally, the downtown area of Saratoga Springs has quite a few bars if you're looking to try different places without driving between them. There are of course plenty of bars in Troy, Schenectady and Albany that others can speak more about.    Some others here have already mentioned keepalbanyboring and alloveralbany to keep track of local events. These blogs are great, highly recommend.   As for where to live, that depends. Will you be working, and if so where might that be? Clifton Park is a big box area, lacking in character but it makes up for it in terms of location (it's central to the four major cities nearby). With that in mind, if you end up working near your boyfriend or not at all, then there's some cheaper rent to be had in Scotia, or Glenville if you prefer a more suburban feel.   A note about KAPL, yes they are incredibly focused on process and procedure. This can be a bear to get used to, but there are also significant benefits to working there. Jobs there are incredibly stable, and they are hell bent on paying market rate salaries. Like anything, there's positives and negatives.

Albany,3doe0z,CreamyGoodnss,0,Sat Jul 18 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"... why would that happen?   You'd be limited on how much you can purchase - and illegal grow-op greens are usually cheaper (and in NY, just as good) than dispensary weed.   I imagine, instead, a town like North Adams getting completely rivitalized from tourism. Sure, a few dudes will bring stuff back and share with their friends - but no major smuggling."
Albany,3doe0z,Pinwurm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"It would happen because, I would assume, there would be some efforts from the police to crack down on people trying to bring it in, if only to send a message. Small amounts are only a violation, sure, but they're not going to just let it go if they find it in someone's car.  I can't say anything about price or quality, but if something is being sold by a legally operating business you can generally find it with a simple google search. It would be faster and more reliable than trying to find someone who knows someone who might sell it."

Some here have suggested place like RI, MA, NH, NJ and Long Island, NY. Great suggestions, but all are longer than 3-4 hours, making for a long day in the car for a beach trip. (RI is atleast 3hrs, not 2.5, I've done the trip several times)   Ocean Beach Park in New London, CT is a true 2.5 hr Trip and beach is easy to get to, it is a beautiful beach, it is huge, it is public (a lot of the beaches in CT & RI tend to be private) There are food vendors, a board walk, they even have shows/music some evenings. I have done this trip many times and the 2 1/2 hr. return trip is much easier when you coming home exhausted after a day in the sun!  Good luck and have fun! :)"

Next would be the South Shore of Long Island.  I've only been to Long Beach, but it was a pretty nice beach.  It's probably ~3 hours to get there, but you have to drive through NYC.  Doable for a dy trip, but a lot of driving.  There are tons of very nice beaches along the Jersey Shore.  The more northern beaches are a little over 3 hours away, and the southern points are about 4 and a half hours.  That's probably a little too long for a day trip though, more of a weekend trip.  IMO, any beach trip would be more of a multi day affair in order to fully relax on the beach and not have to worry about 6+ hours of driving."

I'll put together a list for both places from the circulars and then cross references prices to get the best deals at both places. I usually only go to the store twice a month at the most though, if I need to just grab a few things I'll either go to Cardona's on Delaware or a Stewart's depending on what it is. Slingerlands is easy to get to if you're by 85, and since there are two stores, it's pretty rare that I won't find what I'm looking for between them."

Albany,3dfuql,omahoopsfan,2,Wed Jul 15 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"I generally do price chopper for my meats. Sometimes shop rite has a good deal advertised that's worth picking up. I got two London brooks for 1.99/lb a few weeks ago with a coupon, but they tend to be a bit fewer and far between. I think they are usually better for ""holiday"" related meat deals though, I got my St Patrick's corned beef there, Easter ham, etc. Shop Rite is usually my second stop and tends to get the shorter shopping list of just the deals that they beat price chopper on. A lot of times they have better produce variety and prices, but again, it pays to watch the circulars that come in the mail.   Price chopper has a bin near the end of the meat cooler with markdowns. I usually go in a weekday during the late morning and it tends to be pretty good variety with anywhere from $1 to $7 off the top. A lot of times it ends up being around a third to half off the original price. Also PC usually seems better with pork prices, but they fluctuate a lot. If you keep an eye out, pork butts/shoulders and pork country style ribs can be snagged for $1.49 every few weeks."

Shoprite had a pretty good produce selection, but I had already bought that when I went to PC so I didn't really look around much there.  Just out of curiosity (and in relation to the other post), do you know how the selection of Hannaford compares to either Slingerlands Shoprite or PC?"

Albany,3dfuql,above8k,2,Thu Jul 16 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"I usually shop at ShopRite because no one is ever willing to help you at Price Chopper and the cashiers tend to be rude (at least at the one near me). I also think ShopRite has better prices/sales and has better quality produce than Price Chopper, while Price Chopper has a better meat and beer selection.  I usually get my produce at Aldi's since it is typically a lot cheaper there. Other staples like milk, eggs, bread, etc are usually cheaper there too.

Albany,3dfuql,irondevil518,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:27:28 2015 UTC,"Hannaford generally has better produce than PC or Shoprite (I'm not overly familiar with SR, been once or twice, not impressed) and their chicken prices are ALWAYS better (I love drumsticks, usually buy a 10 pack for around $5).   PC is really upping their game though, if you can make it to any of the new ""Market 32"" stores, they are really upgrading. Just for an example, in Clifton Park, where I live (I know you are looking for closer to Alb, but they are changing all PC's to Market 32 from what I've heard) they have a wonderful selection of produce, meats and speciality items. Baked Goods have been upgraded.   I find Steak and Pork are generally on the same price line between Hannaford and Price Chopper, with the edge in variety going to PC.   I know you said you don't like the club card stuff, but PC is super easy to sign up for, you only need your license or PC card when you check out, and you get good deals on cents off of gas (which doesn't seem like much, but the wife an I alternate using ours, and often get up to $0.80 off before we cash in, it helps).   Don't sleep on Aldi's for frozen foods and snacks(owned by the same company as Trader Joe's). Crazy good prices on off brand stuff but tastes similar. I've talked to a distributor that says that they have some of the best produce in town (once again in CP) in quality not quantity, but you have to hit them on the delivery day which I believe is like a Wednesday or something.  Good luck man!"

I know it must be a tough job, but I was surprised at just how uncomfortable and unprepared the girls seemed. I'm not expecting elaborate dance routines...but I am expecting some effort and actual dancing. It got to the point that we had seen the same girls multiple times, preforming the same slow awkward routine, and the guys started to pay more attention to the NCAA Tournament than the dancers. We had a great time, but the girls really did just kind of fade into the background for awhile as the game came down to the wire.   I guess my point is this: They could use some new talent.

I used to live with my wife in a small all-electric apartment (one bedroom) and my bill was up to $400 during the winter ($50-$60 during the summer).  Now, since my landlord replaced the electric heat with a gas one (the stove/oven/hot water are still electric), the total utility bill is around $50-$70 ($50 if I cancel my gas service in order to avoid the minimum fee) during the summer and $130-$140 during the winter."

It's a flawed system, but basically what it amounts to is that all on street parking is 2 hour max until something like 4pm, after which it's unlimited. The resident parking permit allows a resident who lives in the neighborhood to leave their car during the day without fear of the 2 hour parking limit. The thought was that it would limit state workers from commuting into the city and parking in center square and taking up all of the spots."
Albany,3d7822,UpSNYer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:41 2015 UTC,"Phew. Thought it was a citywide thing, but I didn't think that made sense. Thanks."
Albany,3d7822,MikeTheInfidel,-8,Tue Jul 14 16:09:37 2015 UTC,"It's this strange thing where the city thinks it's somehow legal to determine who is allowed to park on public streets. If the state workers come to their senses, they will organize a lawsuit and will surely win... they have just as much right to park on the streets as the residents.   /and what's now happening is that they have simply moved their parking areas uptown, and are parking on the Western and Washington side streets and taking the bus."

It's clean and the staff is great, and they've got a nice patio out front.  Happy hour specials are good too. Two for one beers (not sure how many ounces they are, but the two beers combined is definitely more than a pint). Utica Club is always $2 I think and they always have $5 meal deals.  This place used to be an entirely different type of place once 10:00pm rolled around (more like a college bar), not sure if it's still like that I only go afternoons/early evenings now that I'm out of college."

There's a little area where I kept finding this weird dirty that wasn't really dirt, my dad told me it was clay, I guess the side of the hill that makes up Prospect park is very heavy in clay deposits, so much so that all my friends parents would call it clay mountain. So where Liberty st. and Havermans Ave in Troy meet is where I found clay.

It's a dirty trick to shorten the light...but it's not like you have much of a leg to stand on."

I really do hope someone decides keeps them in check and time the lights.  I don't live in Albany or have a bunch of spare time, but it sounds like it would interesting to do.  Just grab a stop watch, camera, a clip board, and drive out to each one."
Albany,3ctpg4,TheEllimist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:58:07 2015 UTC,"I realize this happens often, but the only reason you should really get caught in an intersection while making a left is if other people aren't following the law by yielding to traffic already using the intersection (ie. you). Of course, this happens to me a few times a month on my drive home, and obviously traffic cams don't really have the judgement to see that's happened."
Albany,3ctpg4,cybermage,3,Fri Jul 10 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"If you're under the light waiting to turn left, as the pamphlet suggests, I don't think the camera will be able to take a picture of you."

Albany,3ctpg4,unclejunk,4,Fri Jul 10 18:33:39 2015 UTC,"I can already tell which camera will have the most tickets - the one at Western Ave/Russell Rd (the intersection by the school and Stewart's).  There's a sign that says ""stop here on red"" with a line that's 100 feet or so behind the light, but plenty of people don't stop there.  And if it goes yellow when you're on that line, there's not nearly enough time to make it all the way through the intersection before it turns red.  Are they going to give tickets for anyone that stops in between the line and the crosswalk under the light?  Because that could be 3-4 tickets per light cycle."
Albany,3ctpg4,mood__ring,3,Fri Jul 10 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"yeah that one has always been that way, it seems like they cheaped out on the lights. Its clearly that far back to accommodate the turning buses."
Albany,3ctpg4,cybermage,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was there because if you don't stop at the bar and go to the light, the people turning left out of the street that is directly in front of the bar can't see oncoming traffic because you are in the way.  But buses makes sense also.. though, I didn't think the intersection was THAT tight for a bus; its 1 lane Russel going to 2 lanes wide on Western."

Albany,3ctpg4,cybermage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"I've heard (not sure if it's true,) that the stop light at this intersection used to be before Oxford rd. which is why the sign is still there and so far away from the light. When they changed the stop light, they never changed the signage. But it does make sense because if you stop after the sign, you're causing a possible accident with the people turning left out of Oxford. If this story is true, I don't know why they would change the light in the first place! It is a wacky intersection and it seems like people are always confused there."

Albany,3ctpg4,wanttoseemycat,0,Fri Jul 10 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"I think the pictures are taken from behind you as you go through an intersection, so I guess it would depend where they put the camera.  If they put it at that ""stop here on red"" line, there's a lot of area between there and getting completely through the intersection.  Hopefully the cops reviewing it would see that you stop before the actual light though."

Albany,3cp9m2,KennyLoginz,-8,Tue Jul 14 09:17:30 2015 UTC,"It will never happen, in a traditional manner. Unless TW wants to offer this via DOCSIS 3+, nobody has the physical infrastructure.    Bringing fiber to the home is outdated.  By the time such build is completed you would not a need for it.   The business is moving away from wireline and into LTE.  In 15 years most homes will think it is odd to have a physical hookup.    Most people can do anything they would like from an LTE barely 4G (not true 4G speed) network.  By 2020 5G networks will be rolling out and every device will be wireless. Wireline networks will be for business and areas of critical infrastructure.   Once capacity planning is worked out, there is no reason for VZ or ATT not to sell home 4G/5G routers and offer all their video services.  VZ has deem FTTH unprofitable, municipal fiber projects have been losing money.   Albany already is a PoP and has plenty of gigabit fiber for government, research, and backbone running through it. However it is not for consumer residential use."
Albany,3cp9m2,ForumLobster,13,Thu Jul 9 18:58:36 2015 UTC,Wireless speeds will never beat the speeds of a physical connection. I transfered a 12gb file over my wifi(have the fastest wifi possible) and it took around 20 min. Then sending this file to my friends pc with both of them hardwired into the router it took 3 mins.
Albany,3cp9m2,SirNLeo,-6,Thu Jul 9 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but 99% of people never do this, which is why commercial applications will stick to fiber and iSCSI.  You sound like the people that use to say a pc wont need more than 640K of ram.   WLANs were never designed to host 12gb file transfers. LANs will be dominant for this sort of application. However lab tests of current top of the line n/ac standards show about 300-500 mbit transfer. With a real world speed of less than half that.   Also your $100 typical router will not have the processing power to transfer at that rate. You will need professional grade equipment.   Again, consumer grade equipment and services are designed for the 95%, not for me and you. Those people do light browsing, stream netflix/pandora/hbo,etc..., and buy shit.  That is all.  Occasionally some do photo and music.   Additionally lets say you have gigabit wireless in your home.  What current service offers gigabit service at a reasonable rate? There will be bottlenecks on top of bottlenecks.   People in the area if lucky will have 100/100 fiber FioS line that shares a GPON connection to backhaul.  This will potentially be connected to a high quality Cisco wlan controller and an Access Point.  Assuming you are using n/ac with MIMO on two sets of antennas, you can actually use the bandwidth you pay for.   Well encoded 4K video stream from a Netflix or competitor will need only 20-50 mbit of bandwith sustained.    So unless you want to download illegally very quickly, which I am not against and love to do, an ISP has no business reason to run wires across your neighborhood to deliver you this.   They can cheaply give you 50/50 via LTE with 40ms latency to NYC servers and almost nobody, but the handful of hardcore games and torrent users will complain."
Albany,3cp9m2,ForumLobster,6,Thu Jul 9 21:55:08 2015 UTC,"How would 50/50 be enough when one 4k netflix stream needs up to 50 sustained alone? We regularly have 2 tvs playing Netflix, plus 3 phones, tablets, htpc doing its thing, ect ect. Its not just about speed its about the fact more and more everything's connected and sharing the same 50/50 or whatever."
Albany,3cp9m2,TweakedNipple,-2,Thu Jul 9 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"I did not say it would be enough.  I said that gigabit connections will come from technologies that push TW DOCSIS 3.0 to 4,5 etc.. and eventually TW and other cable companies will have gigabit offerings.   Additionally gaps will be filled in by wireless LTE.  As backhaul to each tower is increased, real 4G, 5G, will become actual alternatives."
Albany,3cp9m2,ForumLobster,4,Fri Jul 10 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"You contradict yourself.   You sound like the people that use to say a pc wont need more than 640K of ram.    Talking about the need to transfer large files   That may be true, but 99% of people never do this"
Albany,3cp9m2,vitalityy,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.   When Netgear designs a $60 home router with n and ac, they are not making it for sustained transfer for large files over wlan.  Lets say they put 300mbit speeds on the box.  That does not mean you will transfer at 37 megabytes per second.  There is a lot that goes into this, but essentially it may only sustain 10 at best with sharp spikes based on the board design (ram/cache/os/etc..).  Hell mine is high end and can only really do 4-5.  Additionally that device is really designed for browsing, streaming, and some gaming.   Top gamers get pro gear and use wired networks because of the latency. So the person who is complaining about the speed of transfer of wireless, is likely using equipment not meant for it.   Now I have designed and operated large wireless networks that were designed with file transfer in mind. This was a little while ago, but the design called for load balancing the file services, traffic shaping, and the use of very expensive top of the line wlan controllers, access points, and actual design to take advantage of the 100mbit we were offering."
Albany,3cp9m2,ForumLobster,7,Fri Jul 10 01:49:38 2015 UTC,Nothing you said negates my point.  You argued that something isnt needed because 99% of people dont use it for that..yet made an analogy that pokes holes in that theory.

There is no reason why you could not have downloaded 120gb over last mile delivery that is wireless.

Albany,3cp9m2,Sir_Leminid,5,Thu Jul 9 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"I would have that problem also, and hope for some wired solution. But, if somehow things do go wireless, I doubt it would be to your devices, more likely a setup like Dish TV, an outdoor reciever connected to an indoor modem/router, you can be wired or wifi like signal out of that."
Albany,3cp9m2,TweakedNipple,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why I am down-voted for explaining the business plans of internet providers.  Your home could still be wired and you would have a receiver outside.   Just because you want a wired connection doesn't mean that this is the best solution from the business perspective of VZ or ATT.   Very few people require the type of throughput and latency requirements that wired connections can potentially provide.   This is a fact.  Aside from gaming, there are very few commercial applications that require this.    The majority of internet use is light browsing, streaming services, porn, and light gaming.   Now according to your tag you are in Delmar where FTTH is available through FiOS. That is good for you. However Verizon is no longer investing in wire-line technology and scaling back their DSL.   It is costly to maintain and 95% of their users do not utilize even a fraction of FiOS potential. You might sit there and torrent movies all day, but that simply is not what most people do.   Now you can make a case that streaming 4K video will push the bandwidth requirement and gamin will push latency, and I will agree.  Verizon already has markets with 100mbit symmetrical FDD LTE.  Additional 600mhz bandwidth will cover the poor penetration of higher bands.  Also for everyday gaming for the majority of pc, xbox ,and PS gaming only requires ping to the game server under 60ms for seamless experience.  From the tower you are likely on fiber backhaul anyways. So really what you want to expand is the first hop to be under 1ms like with a FTTH or Cable connection.   This is already possible using current TD/FD LTE.  I realize that that stuff is low priority for providers currently, but the technology is there. Once 5G networks are going to be going up, they will be doing so with the idea of replacing wire-line. That is a fact. Wires cost money to maintain to every home.  Companies want out of that business if at all possible.  Your home is already wired, so nobody will care about the thickness or your old home. This is not anecdotal, this is littelarly the future of every major telecom plan from Korean Telecom, to British, to Orange, to TMO Germany to ATT and VZ here. NTT is already doing trials in Japan."

I have Fiber to the home in RAVENA NY from StateTel:   I have 7 hops to the VPN gateway at my job in Albany... ping of 10-15ms - VPN box gets gangbanged like crazy.. I have 8 hops to the DC in Boston for Star Trek Online... ping 7ms I download ISO's from Microsoft... done in 10 minutes. Netflix? Spikes to 50 mbps for a few seconds and then gulps at 15/20 mbps every few seconds to keep the stream buffered.   Sure 5G may be able to push more than 50mbps... but you will have latency and congestion, no doubt.   Also.... take a drive down main st. in Castkill NY, population of 15K or more and watch your Verizon phone drop to 1x, Sprint? Yeah fucking right. ATT? OK it works, but it's not amazing.   Guess what?  It was like that when I was in high school... and I am 33 years old...  15 years and Verizon could give a shit about doing anything about the coverage in Catskill and I am sure they won't do shit about for the next 15 years.   When they built the Wal-mart in town, they couldn't even activate Verizon phones that they sold in Electronics until they put in a local repeater that only works inside the store...  This is just Catskill, NY.   Everywhere outside of Albany/other major metro areas and more than 10 miles inland from the NYS thruway has similar problems scattered around.  Now I'm a Verizon Wireless customer because I can make calls where people can't hear you scream...  Coverage is great... for voice... Not data and surely not a lot of data.  So there it is, companies like Verizon, ATT, and Sprint will need to increase coverage and density by orders of magnitude in order to make fiber obsolete for the masses with wireless technology.   Verizon, specifically, needs to just suck it up at lay fiber.  A little independent telco in Ravena did it...."
Albany,3cp9m2,phantom_eight,-4,Fri Jul 10 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"That is my point. You would never game over it.  Most households do not play anything that requires latency under 40ms.    Real 4G LTE should easily deliver 100mbit throughput, assuming proper channel allotment is made.    When corporations build out, they unfortunately build for the 95% not the 5% that you and I belong to.   Verizon will never lay more fiber because it is very expensive and has a poor return. They dont care about the gamers.  They would rather keep pushing and squeezing what they have."
Albany,3cp9m2,ForumLobster,2,Fri Jul 10 01:34:06 2015 UTC,Over the air bandwidth is finite. It can't replace wires without sacrificing a lot of the speed needed for things like streaming video.
Albany,3cp9m2,joequin,0,Fri Jul 10 12:25:00 2015 UTC,"Sure it can. You are not replacing wires, you are replacing last mile delivery. Towers are connected by fiber or microwave if remote. Every major ISP on the planet is looking to get out of providing and supporting wires to the homes. Only thing you are changing is delivery from the node/tower being wire or wireless. I would advocate FTTH but ROI on such services is low, so ISPs are reluctant to do more of it. Even Uverse ATT is slow because they are milking every drop out of slow crappy DSL.  That tech is supposed to make fiber to the node delivery cheap.  Again, I am not advocating, and as long as people will watch cable TV TW will keep up their network and last mile delivery, but the sad truth is, that with proper tower density and channel allotment you can provide 100mbit symmetrical LTE with latency under 60ms to most game servers using existing technology, never mind the future of wireless.   Future wireless will have high freq 2.6ghz type for line of sight type of delivery, and 600mhz for penetration.  Freq modulation and consolidation, like Sprint tries to sell with their Spark 2.6, 800, 1900 LTE (which is largely marketing but the tech and spectrum do work in their test markets) already works. VZ has deployed 100mbit  FDD LTE with AWS in many markets...so it is a matter of time until you will see consumer grade offerings and people will jump on it."
Albany,3cp9m2,ForumLobster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:26 2015 UTC,You realize that the Fiber will be a backbone right?  Copper connection to clients.
Albany,3cp9m2,wobblymint,-1,Fri Jul 10 08:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, fiber is backbone, but not in a municipal wan that is discussed here. This projects are fiber to the home as last mile delivery. Phone lines are limited in capacity, therefore only time warner can really do high speed last mile delivery over copper. In a municipal solution you have major trunks creating a loop, or a star, across the city and fiber nodes for each neighborhood and than typical multimode from the pole to the home. In the home it uses the home's cable wire or more likely just Ethernet cable to get to a hi home router."

Albany,3cqett,jeffedge,0,Thu Jul 9 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Back home, seems like just about every gym offered passes, from the big chains down to the startups.

Albany,3cqett,jeffedge,0,Thu Jul 9 23:52:18 2015 UTC,I don't get why anyone would be against it. A couple free visits to their gym in exchange for the opportunity to get a new customer.   How much could one person visiting a couple times possibly cost them? Pennies.
Albany,3cqett,jeffedge,4,Fri Jul 10 00:03:46 2015 UTC,"Because most do what you admitted to doing which is just gym hoping and never paying. Using showers/facilities and adding wear on the machines. I see their side and agree with it.   Day passes are super cheap. You get to check everything out and have thousands and thousands of dollars of things at your disposal for nothing close to the cost, and they make money to run their business. Seems fair to me."

Do they actually cook food from scratch, or is it like olive garden where it's basically glorified frozen food and/or flavor packets?

Albany,3cmlxr,sleazepleeze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:22:04 2015 UTC,"Considering the prices, and the fact that there is a named ""executive chef"" on their menu, they had better be cooking from scratch.

Each was met with ""can you be impartial, fair, etc..."" to which I would reluctantly answer ""yes"".   I was chosen along with others based solely on the number assigned, and it was one of the most interesting and enlightening experiences I've ever had. Trying to reach a unanimous decision in a large group of diverse people is unique in my experience.   It was a low level drug offense. The responsibility of presiding over a persons freedom is a weight I was not prepared for. But to be honest, it was the interactions to get 12 or 13 unrelated people from all walks of life to ALL agree on anything was truly enlightening. To think this happens every day floors me.  We tried to be a hung jury multiple times. We reviewed and reviewed evidence. We debated possibilities. We cajoled and convinced. We learned more about our fellow jurors in three days of deliberation than working with someone for years.  TLDR: it's an enlightening life experience, and I would definitely volunteer to do it again. Oh, and free lunch during deliberations."

As is my common law right, both the factual testimony and the justice of the law will be considered when making my decision.'  Really though, just go and answer honestly. Grand jury sucks compared to petit jury. You only work on one case and unless it's a hugely complex case, it'll likely be quite short. You're on the first part... being called to the courthouse. Once you're there, you may not be called into the courtroom at all. If you are, you may not be called up to the jury box at all. If you are, they may decide you're not the right fit anyway and dismiss you. If they do pick you, they might plea out at the last minute. If they don't, the service is either/both pretty interesting or very short.  Realistically, you're most likely going to get a gun posession/drug possession/petty theft case...

The accused was sitting there in the seats with his lawyer listening to the process.  I got up there and told the open court, where the accused drug dealer (who I think was accused of assault as well) that no way was I going to announce my name, address and work place to them because I didn't want him sending someone to hurt my daughter. The one lawyer told me he was in jail. I faced to the judge and said that obviously he talks to people on the outside and there was no way I'd ever say ""guilty"" and take that kind of chance since he now knows everyone's personal information and would know mine if I was on the jury. Accused lawyer spoke up and actually wanted me on the panel.   Judge waved his hand for me to approach the bench and told me to leave now please. I got a lot in before being brought up to the judge.

Truthfully (and purists will scream), if you're on a ridiculously tight budget, you can probably get away with using any old monofilament as backing, rather than buying the specific Dacron backing. I've been fly fishing for 30 years, and I think I've only actually gotten into the backing ONCE in all that time."

I am mostly going to be fishing streams and lake shorlines, so I figured 7wt was too much. I read online that you can go down a weight, but had another friend tell me I am completely wrong. What do you think?"
Albany,3cc1g9,drsfmd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"You'll have some difficulty casting, and 7 weight is pretty heavy, so you might not feel subtle hits with smaller fish, but you certainly aren't going to harm anything.

I find the side arm cast to be far more useful than the overhead cast you see in the movies. Learning to lay a fly down so gently that the leader doesn't disturb the water is the toughest part-- especially when dealing with super spooky trout."

Actually, I'd call or visit one of the better pet stores around, like Benson's, and ask them if they carry/can order live feeder animals, or if they have any resources.

I chose Guilderland because I didn't want to live right next to bars but also still be able to go out on the weekends  plus I enjoy the fact that I'm close to the mall, plazas, restaurants, etc.   If you really wanted to be near everything and meet new people then I would recommend living in Center Square.

I typically get there around 4:00pm, it's crowded, but never too bad. There are plenty of weight and aerobic machines, I don't think I've ever found myself sitting in a line to use any of the equipment. The free weights and the universal machines (I think that's what they're called? The stands that have 8-10 ""stations"" where you can do different exercises) do get pretty busy though.  It's in a plaza with a Price Chopper, tractor supply store, chili's, and a bunch of other shops. There are two entrances and exits to the plaza. It can be a little tricky making a left onto 9W when there is a lot of traffic. I typically go out to Glenmont road and make a left onto 9W at the light.  The staff is usually walking around cleaning stuff, picking stuff up off the floor/machines, so it's normally clean.

They have free bars (free bars meaning, not attached like smith machines) and a decent amount of equipment. The people who work there are better than some of the others in the area as well, they take care of the equipment. Plus they just did away with the hair cutting and got 2 hydro massage beds.  Even during the ""busy hours"" I am still able to get in and get out relatively unscathed. The only thing that I have found with this gym compared to the others is, people are a bit less apt to ask if your done with a machine or certain piece of equipment.

""Fort Orange Funding"" ""...Orange Julius"".  Cradle of the Union: Used to describe Albany by Benjamin Franklin in regards to The Albany Plan. The Albany Plan was a proposal to unite the colonies under one government. Woo!  Usually - people just say ""Smallbany"".  Also, we have tons of nicknames for our metrpoplitan area or geographical region as a whole.   Capitaland, Capital-Saratoga Region, Tech Valley, etc - These are generally used by politicians, news-outlets, etc.   The 518 - Not sure if it's still referenced, but kids in my HS said it.  Other things.....  Troilet - Derogatory name for Troy - or for 'skanky' personality-less loose women that live in Troy.   Cox'ucker - Someone from Coxsackie  'Toga, Spa City, Racing City - Saratoga.  The Electric City - name for Schenectady because General Electric started there.  The Carpet City - Amsterdam. I forget why.   Lake George is the 'Queen of American Lakes'.   Guilderland literally translates to 'Money Land' in Dutch. It used to be a beacon for wealthy families, still is in many respects.   Galbany - The stretch of Western Avenue between SUNY and Crossgates. Is it Albany? Is it Guilderland? We're too lazy to Google it and too busy not-caring.

Albany,3bsrj5,ooooohnoyobogoya,4,Wed Jul 1 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"I live on Jay, 5 houses down from the Knickerbocker.  Parking is generally fine, but like anything, timing is important.  If you get home at 4, you'll find a spot near the apartments.  If you get home at 9, you're parking at the Jay-Hudson Park a block away.  If you get home at midnight, you're parking on State Street. Jay Street is cobblestone and is in rough shape.  It can be an obstacle course driving down it. I never bottered to get a parking permit because I'm not here during the day.  I'd keeps most of the state workers from parking in the neighborhood during the day, but doesn't help at night. Snow emergencies suck, but it's in the northeast during the winter. The Knickerbocker is fine, but you get what you pay for.  It has a bad reputation that it earned years ago, but it has really been cleaned up and has a much better clientele now.  I have several friends who live there.  It's probably the least expensive place in the immediate neighborhood."

You can also go upstairs afterwards for some good beers at City Beer Hall.   http://www.speakeasy518.com/  Also if you love Lobster Mac & Cheese go to Albany Pump Station for a dinner/lunch.

Women should wear either a dress or slacks and a nice blouse. The dress should be longer, below the knee is best.   I would say your best bet is to dress as if you were going to a fancy resturaunt.  Their other rules include no cell phones or cameras. They will ask you to leave if they notice you on your phone. It's honestly great. It started SO & I's pledge to put our cell phones away when out. We're there to enjoy each others company, not our screens.  A reservation gets you a table, which is nice and private.

Anyone who frequents fast food establishments in the area can attest to the lackadaisical, don't give a shit attitude of some of the employees. With an influx of applicants for higher wages we'll see less of these apathetic workers. Also, this will help in lessening the amount of people who are on public assistance in which 44% of restaurant and food service workers are on. Fast food workers make a national average of 8.63 per hour and only 13% of all them receive medical insurance through their jobs. Although it's for fast food workers only, I think this is a positive step in the right direction and could push the minimum wage issue for ALL jobs into the limelight.  Statistic and percentage source"
Albany,3bklsx,sleepyeyed,4,Tue Jun 30 13:27:16 2015 UTC,"The bit about public assistance is what so many people miss when we have this argument. It's a cost that's hidden behind taxes and budgets, but we've been supplementing minimum wage jobs with tax money for a long time now. Just take a look at the numbers for Walmart alone.   Now, of course, the common retort to raising the minimum wage would be the potential job loss. Employers would seek out ways to cut costs, either by reducing head counts/hours or investing in automated solutions. For the latter, I find these arguments to be weak, as we shouldn't be keeping wages down to simply delay the inevitable. As for the concept of job loss, it's a two way street, economically speaking. Employers will absolutely try to do more with less in an effort to normalize their labor budgets, but many won't have an option. Plus, when employees make higher wages, they have more money to spend.  Overall, I see this as a mostly positive step in the right direction. If we do this for fast food employees, it will only be a matter of time before other contingencies step forward and demand the same. Then we can have a true discussion on a minimum, livable wage."
Albany,3bklsx,icedevil6,2,Tue Jun 30 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"It's true that this would cause a slight increase in unemployment, but it would eventually drop because the overall economy would be stimulated by people spending more from their better paying jobs. Over time the strengthened economy would result in business growth and more jobs which would bring those unemployment numbers down."
Albany,3bklsx,sleepyeyed,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"A great example would be a hairdresser I know. She's adamantly against raising the minimum wage, mostly because the idea of 'burger flippers' making as much as she does upsets her. What she doesn't realize is that a substantial portion of her customers make minimum wage. If they received a wage increase, they would be able to seek out haircuts more frequently. She'd probably even see increased tips."
Albany,3bklsx,icedevil6,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"Now, of course, the common retort to raising the minimum wage would be the potential job loss   One problem with that argument is that it only works if you believe that minimum wage employers have excess staff capacity. How many minimum wage employers hire more people than they absolutely need to have?   Typically minimum wage employees already employee as few people as they can.   An issue with a fast food specific law is you'll probably see fast food joints contracting out whatever they can. Why pay your own workers $15 an hour to clean, if you can have a cleaning crew that has to pay workres $8 to do it."

There are better applicants when $15 is the going rate...therefore MORE people will be on welfare. But at least fast food will be better prepared with retirees making it...those will be the main employees.  Well, until the prices have to go up, and no one frequents them anymore and fast food places perfect automation  When I was a kid working fast food, my managers were single, in their 30's with no kids maybe 1 at the most, my coworkers were HS and college kids. Now, it's because welfare MAKES you work that you have the moms with 3 kids...so don't worry about them getting 20 hrs and $9.00. That way the government can have control of them, and they can live less stressful lives than most middle class Americans. Fast Food work gets them a paycheck, plus HEAP, plus SNAP, plus rent subsidy, plus a cell phone. I've lived in that neighborhood...some work hard to make it out, some have to say no because they get to a point where a pay raise will make them lose all of the above benefits. Some are generational welfare abusers, who are not stupid, but also have little morality, they know the loopholes  The sad part is that so many people believe the ""You can't raise a family on these jobs""  No shit!

This makes up the vast majority of IT jobs. Specialsts sedom come out of college, they usually come from job experience and tech schools(I feel is a much more reasonable thing to do than college.) Coders I know aren't regularly making 90k out here(there really isn't too many coding jobs out here) but you can in NYC or any other large and expensive city. Cisco pays out the ass but the jobs are limited and require (again) a specialty which isn't typically offered within college.  My HP job was driving range (no more than 3 hours away)traveling break fix work for machines with contracts. Everything from small company laptops to government facility Superdomes. Perhaps you see this as the same level of thing as setting up monitors. I don't know if 30k was too little or not but I was just happy to get my foot into the door, which took 4 years since I graduated. My story is not atypical.

McDonalds (and many fast food joints) runs on a franchise model. increased employee costs at a store in NY won't be offset by stores throughout the country or by corporate. those increased costs are assumed by the franchisee, who will have no choice but to raise prices."

That's a 1.4% increase in price for a wage over 150% higher than before. Although that's Walmart and not McDonald's, I think we're still in the same wheelhouse."

It's incredibly overpriced and the portions are way too small.

Albany,3bf8nw,memememedia,2,Sun Jun 28 18:16:19 2015 UTC,These all sound amazing!  Looks like Poughkeepsie is worth a short detour!
Albany,3bf8nw,sputn1k,3,Sun Jun 28 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"You are going to be driving by a lot of places that are worth much more of your time than Poughkeepsie. I would definitely stop at new Paltz, Rhinebeck, or even Woodstock or Saugerties before wasting my time in Poughkeepsie just for sushi. I also believe it's actually 9w until you get down near Poughkeepsie, 9 and Poughkeepsie are both on the east side of the Hudson River, no need to go over there."
Albany,3bf8nw,sputn1k,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:27:59 2015 UTC,Great advice!  I'm looking into the places you mentioned.  Any particular place in Paltz or Saugerties?
Albany,3bf8nw,sputn1k,2,Mon Jun 29 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"I would definitely follow the route that /u/mabepossibly listed until you get to Cooperstown/Oneonta. I would then take Route 23 into Hunter, NY. There is a nice ski resort at Hunter that does lift rides, and has an adventure park/zipline if you are into that type of thing. The ride from Oneonta to Hunter is a very nice scenic ride. The Village of Tannersville (just east of Hunter) has a lot of great little shops and restaurants.  I would then take Route 23A down the mountain, this is a very scenic ride as well.  Once you get down to the bottom of the mountain I would either go to Saugerties, then Kingston and onto the thruway, or Woodstock then New Paltz and onto the thruway.  I'm originally from Saugerties, so I've definitely spent more time in Saugerties/Kingston. Saugerties has a great new bbq place that opened up called the smokin pony. It is outside of town, but the food is great (https://www.facebook.com/smokinponybbq). They were only doing dinner when they originally opened, but I think they are going to be open for lunch now that summer is here, but the food is delicious and they've got some good beer. There is another bbq place that is actually located in the village called 'cue. The food here isn't as good, but it's definitely not bad.   When you are done there I would take a ride into the Village for a walk, or some drinks. There are a bunch of nice restaurants and shops in the village. If you are looking for a bit of a nature walk you can take a trail that is about a mile out to the saugerties lighthouse on the hudson river, it's a nice little walk with some great views (http://www.saugertieslighthouse.com/).   Going into Kingston isn't very exciting. Again, there are a bunch of great restaurants scattered throughout the little city. If you are into beer I would make a point to stop over Keegan Ales for a beer or two and maybe some light food. Kingston was the original capital of NY, so there is quite a bit of history there. Not many exciting sites or great views, but a lot of history and very old buildings.  If you want to go the other route, Woodstock and New Paltz are great little towns that are very walkable. Lots of shops and restaurants. There are a couple of parks/hikes you can stop at in those areas also if that's what you're looking for.  I would hop on the thruway for the rest of the drive at that point. If you really want to, you can take Route 32 all the way down to the Newburgh area. I think that would allow you to stop in Saugerties, Kingston, and New Paltz.   I guess it all depends on what you're looking for. Good luck."

Albany,3bf8nw,ayesdeeef,2,Tue Jun 30 03:49:06 2015 UTC,I'd head from Utica to Cooperstown if you want to check out the hall of fame.  Eat at either Brewery Ommegang or Brooks BBQ in Oneonta.  Ommegang is an amazing brewery with a great Belgium inspired pub fare restaurant. Brooks is a locally famous BBQ joint. But if your used to BBQ from down south it is average at best.    Leave Utica on 8 south and go east on RT 20.  Skip Rt 28 and go south on Rt 80 along glimmer glass lake.  Much nicer ride.  Leaving Cooperstown head south on 28 and follow it through the Catskills into Woodstock and grab the thruway in Kingston.   While your in Utica grab dinner at either Venturas or Chesterfields. Order Utica Greens as an app and Chicken Riggies.  Both are a Utica specialty.

Kinda bummed that the Kidney Buster roller coaster wasn't operational, but I figure that will be working very soon.  I understand that the bumper cars may come over to the new place next year."
Albany,3bcb3i,phantom_eight,3,Sun Jun 28 13:59:42 2015 UTC,"We were there friday and we visited a few times prior to their move.   The Good   Most of the classic rides are there, it was good. The pathways are fresh pavement, spacious, with a decorative design painted and pressed into the asphalt.  Really like the walkways and the setup. Open till 9PM I always hated how early Hoffmans closed.  I drove by later and they had all of the lights on rides on. Prices and number of tickets required per ride remain unchanged.   The Bad   The parking lot is way to small.  It didn't seem crowded when we were there, but there was only 5 or so free spaces... So when they are packed.. I have no idea where we would park. There are two rows of spaces and they are too close to each other.  I felt uncomfortable that the other idiots (remember, any driver other yourself is to be considered an idiot by default, it's the safest way) could back out of their space across from my car and not hit my car.  I also was worried about getting to close to the other cars as I backed out, extra care and attention is required. We went about 5/6PM, it was 81F outside, the Sun was getting lower in the sky with a slight breeze and light clouds.  It wasn't bad, but there is no shade. None. At all.  It will likely be awful on a hot day, 85+ F, full sun...ect...  the temperature on the pavement itself will probably be in the 100's.  Their employees are going to roast out there.  When I get hot, I get cranky... so it will probably suck all around.  They've planted a few tree's here and there, but they should consider planting double the amount, they really need to look into possibly planting older taller tree's that would need special transportation.  Something like this http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/landscaping/implement/images/scan024.jpg and this  http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1IV10M1RbEA/maxresdefault.jpg The trees they've planted are decorative."
Albany,3bcb3i,low_altitude_sherpa,2,Sun Jun 28 06:47:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. I didn't even try the lot. We parked on the street. I think they need to designate some spaces in the store lot to be for the store only and let folks park in that lot fur the playland. It's huge and had plenty of space.  The only shade we found was the two pavilions and the train station. Nothing near the rides. Yesterday was mostly cloudy so it wasn't a big deal for us. Late hours may help offset this issue.  Hopefully if it's successful they'll be willing to put in improvements. I like your tree idea.

St. Rose is a mediocre school that gave a former communications student who dropped out his senior year a degree in the TV/Film program. Many schools offer credits for real world experiences or a portfolio of work. Even if you don't like Fallon, there isn't really an argument that his actual experience in TV and Film is probably a shitload more valuable then whatever course St. Rose was offering as a capstone to that program. If you don't think years of experience can be a replacement for 18 credits then you're in for a rude awakening when you figure out that nothing else in the world is a meritocracy."

We watch from the parking lot at SCCC. Less crowded, but it does take a while to get out. This location is so established, there are even food vendors on site.  July 4th: Empire State Plaza. We park at the east garage on either the top or next to top tier. We walk up for the food in late afternoon and then watch from the garage. Pro Tip: In the afternoon, the garage is really quiet. Find the exit you want, and drive the wrong way up to a parking space with good visibility to the plaza and park so that you can drive out of the space.   Thursdays in July and August: Fireworks at Lake George. The fireworks are shot off over the lake. There is tons of visibility and you have a lot of choice over the level of crowd you want to be in. Pro Tip: Do not take a fireworks cruise. They actually park the boat further away from the fireworks then you would be some places on shore."

There are big sloping lawns facing the plaza, and you can get a great view. You won't see some of the ""low"" fireworks going off below the line of sight, but all the big ones look great.

A lot of it hit the earth last night, producing auroras at lower latitudes than normal. More of it might hit the earth Wednesday night, which also happens to be forecasted to be clear!  Last night, I was able to perceive the aurora as a faint glow behind the clouds. My eyes couldn't make out colors, but any camera that can do long exposures (including my smartphone on manual mode) can make out color. I'd say any modern DSLR or fancy camera + tripod can capture it.  Here's a website that gives frequent updates on the intensity and extent of geomagnetic storms, and the probability you can see them where you are.  Here's a light pollution map.

Albany,3au9iz,thestarkbitch,3,Tue Jun 23 17:07:40 2015 UTC,"To the naked eye, it was just like a cloud with a faint, colorless glow, as if a tiny slivered crescent moon was behind it just barely lighting it up.  but, it was very humid, and there was a fair bit of cloud cover. I think that if it had been less humid and clearer, you could have been able to discern the color with the naked eye.  So yes, admittedly long exposures make it look far more impressive than it does in person."
Albany,3au9iz,poopsmith411,2,Tue Jun 23 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"I can almost guarantee that whatever picture you're thinking of, it was a long exposure shot.  I went to school at Oswego and the campus was on the south shore of Lake Ontario.  We used to hang out by the ""beach"" (horrible rocks) and see the northern lights frequently.  I'd describe them as faint cloud-like things that were very wispy.  They'd move at various speeds, usually fairly slow but I remember some that were very rapid and wave-like passing directly overhead.  It's been over a decade since I've seen them and I'd love to see them again."

Albany,3asfdd,WhatinSamHell,5,Tue Jun 23 03:25:40 2015 UTC,Former EMT... Albany med followed by Ellis. St Peters has an ok mini food court but the cafeteria is terrible. You wild be shocked by how unhealthy most options are.
Albany,3asfdd,Mabepossibly,3,Tue Jun 23 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"The pizza at Albany Med is surprisingly edible.  The other food is good too, they make wraps during lunch time and have freshly premade ones left out after... those are good too.  They had your average terrible food like mac and cheese, chicken, ect...  They also have sushi... but I don't eat that non-sense...  Anyway, my wife had complications with the birth of our daughter.  We spent a total of about four weeks at Albany Med spread out across nearly 6 weeks... I had the good fortune of being able to stay with my wife at the hospital and slept in the ""Father chair"", I would only go home to shower and replenish supplies/clothes.  The wifi is so damn good in D6North (The limbo section of maternity, as in not delivery or recovery... but your not going home... your in purgatory...) that I actually VPNed in and worked every day beside my wife while she watched TV and kept herself as relaxed as possible.  I used her food tray as a desk when she wasn't eating.. and I waited on her hand and foot.  So the whole time we pretty much ate at the hospital or I grabbed something on my way back from home. My wife sent me down to the cafeteria frequently because the food they gave you in the room usually sucked.  On top of all of that our Daughter was in the NICU for 11 days and we weren't like the other parents.... We were there every day almost all day (it's our first child... so you know...) and eating Albany Med pizza or whatever all day.  We were shocked to see how infrequently other parents came to see their newborns... but I digress again...  Anyway, we lived off their Pizza for like a month.... The mild chicken pizza is the shit and we have fond memories.    Now on to the important part.... I don't remember seeing a lot of cute nurses or doctors to eye up... Then again I might have just been unlucky...  EDITed to cut down the story."

Albany,3ajkpm,NetFlix_AllDay,2,Sun Jun 21 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"yea. you used to be able to get something like that. now they got all sensitive about dumb crap. i find the 50 bucks well worth it for my plates. i've had personalized ones for about 20 years now.   i had a long story about one of the first sets i got. i was very friendly with the local beer distributor and he provided a much needed distraction to my day. We were both married, so this was just as friends.  this guy and i always joked around and one day he was talking about something that happened in the store he was just in. i told him the manager must have been giving him shit because he was in love with him and my guy wouldn't even give him a rusty trombone.  we had that kind of sideways humor.   well one day, i was talking about needing to renew my reg and it was time for new plates because everyone was calling me ""jules"" which was part of my old plates.  i told my distributor i should get hotrod because be is so hot and it went well with his name. he told me i'd never do it, i said. ""yeah yeah"".  a few weeks later i had hotrodd (not sure how many d's i had to get) plates.   i met up with him at our usual meet up and that guy died. he didn't believe i'd actually do it. i said not to tell me i'd never do something. haha.   it was a little longer after that i accidentally found out his name was ron. i overheard someone in the store call him by name.  i had been calling him rod for about 5 years and he never corrected me. i mean. he was the nicest funniest guy on earth and i found out i sucked.   i kept those plates for many years, many men made really dumb comments which took away from the original intention of my plates but i'll never forget my weekly joking around with rod. i mean ron :("

The one we did hire made a nice sign but totally screwed up the install and wouldn't answer the phone for MONTHS after.

I would never do that in reality, but the guy called me back the next day.  If you could build a nice web presence, have an actual phone system, and probably a CRM to manage everything professionally, I am willing to bet you could stay organized and have a great source of income.

Nice jumbo wings, but nothing I've tried that differentiates them from any other wing place in the area(though some have better or worse sauces).  People rave about mini hotdogs at Gus's Hot Dogs(I LOVE their burgers), Famous Lunch(Troy), Jacks Drive In(Wynatskill/Troy), First Prize(Schenectady) in and others. The hot dogs are just humbolt hot dogs(in my opinion terrible dogs) just smaller. I think most people have childhood memories of eating them and enjoy the feeling of nostalgia when at those joints.  I've tried most of the burger and dog joints that locals rave about.

Albany,39u680,Xandal,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:36:03 2015 UTC,TWC offers competitive pricing in terms of speed.   But they require you a contract to get those speeds.

Albany,39u680,Team_Slacker,4,Mon Jun 15 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"Are you willing to move?  The Village of Ravena has Fiber to the Home courtesy of StateTel (no verizon down here)  Their website is old and straight out of 1994, they only advertise their fiber on their sign outside of their building and by word of mouth.  However, don't let that fool you.  I've only had ""downtime"" once with them and it wasn't really downtime... it would just disconnect for about a second once every couple of days, it did that for about a week or two until they fixed it.   I only noticed it because it would cause my VPN to my office to reset or it would kick me from a game if I happened to be playing then... otherwise you would not really notice if you were just surfing.  Only happened once and it was two years ago just after initial public availability, since then, rock solid.  Base package is 20 down and 2 up for $59 and I doubled to 40 down and 4 up for $79.  Install for me was free, I even had underground install....  I called StateTel up, they came out and had a look, I then called 1800 dig safe NY or whatever... after a week or so all the utilities stopped by my house and spray painted my grass where everything was... Then StateTel came over with a machine and ran it from the poll in my front yard over to the side of my house.  It took 30 minutes, then they setup everything inside.    Fiber comes with a backup battery for the ONT and I put my router on a UPS as well so I can even surf during power outages with a laptop.... for hours... (I have two laptop batteries ;-) )  We don't have a home telephone as there is a Verizon Wireless tower in the Village that gives us perfect signal so I don't know if they give discounts for multiple services like most utilities do.  One would assume so.   You'd also have to get Mid Hudson Cable for TV which is OK, but they probably don't have as many HD channels as TWC.  You always have Dish/DirectTV.  We are about 7-9 miles from shopping in Glenmont and I can leave my driveway and be sitting at my desk in downtown Albany in less than 25 mins, screw northway traffic.  Taxes are way cheaper too..."

I am calling StateTel tomorrow because I am wondering where exactly they have laid down fiber. I had absolutely no idea that StateTel was doing fiber. That is amazing to me in a town like Ravena (no offense).   I currently have MidHudson Cable and it's pretty awful. We get 10M / 1M for $80 / month, and we have to get their basic cable package.   People bitch about TWC, but at least they offer a competitive product."

Albany,39edo2,capt_0bvious,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a whirl then. Three of the four carbs are sucking a lot of air, the fourth pulls some air, but not nearly as much as the others. I bought new fuel lines and a filter today, and I'll install them over the weekend (and properly install the fuel pump, which was just sitting in the bottom of the cavity with the wires exposed... not good). I need a new battery, which I've ordered, and it will probably need a new rear tire-- the existing one has plenty of tread left, but has some cupping.   Bottom line is that this is going to take some time to get sorted out, but it doesn't appear to need anything major, and as I mentioned in the OP, I got a great deal on it since it was a non-runner. With the hour I invested in it, plus the $30 in parts, I think I could already double my money.   Now I just have to figure out why it's stuck in gear. My reading on an FZR forum indicates that this is a common problem in bikes that have been sitting. I'll fool around with that this weekend. Once that's sorted and I get the battery installed, I think it will be ready for inspection. I may also try to track down a set of fairings-- someone tried to make a streetfighter out of it, and it looks cool, but I think I'll probably restore it to original."
Albany,39edo2,Daritlan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"If gas was left in the carbs they could be gummed up.

Albany,39gd4h,njb711,5,Thu Jun 11 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, there's only one side of the story here.  Mr Ruggerio's account is not anywhere in the article. It was either not collected by authorities yet, or omitted by the TU.   Not taking sides here, just noting that all that's being written is one side of the story.   The TU does this from time to time. Once, they ran a story about an Albany DA who was arrested for hitting his ex wife. They printed details from the wife's account when she went to police. But nobody contacted the guy himself to see what his story was. So as far as the average TU reader was concerned, this guy was a super tool.  .... turns out his wife was nuts. She'd regularly threaten to tell the cops that he beats her when he didn't comply with her demands. He'd actually gotten a recording of her threatening to go to the cops and fabricate an abuse story during an argument. But the TU showed no interest in contacting him for his side of the story, or his lawyer. It was more than a month before the prosecutor put out a press release saying he'd dropped charges, and was going to charge the ex-wife with lots of stuff pertaining to filing false charges, perjury, etc. And this wasn't that long ago..... 2012.   Original (and very damning) TU article:  http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Ex-county-prosecutor-accused-of-attacking-his-wife-3428471.php  Not until MONTHS later, the vindicating article finally makes it to the TU, recording included:  http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Assault-case-against-Conboy-dismissed-3617060.php  Not saying the same would apply here, but you really can't come to final judgement based on the TU reporting, especially when there's no effort to get a response from the accused."

Albany,39gd4h,SonicPhoenix,-17,Thu Jun 11 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"The only evidence here is the word of a 13 year old Bethlehem girl. Everyone knows that Bethlehem is filled with rich, over privileged kids who think they deserve the world handed to them and will do anything to get their way. For all we know, Mr. Ruggiero gave the girl a bad grade at the end of the year so she held a grudge and is now trying to ruin him. Mr. Ruggiero was a well-respected art teacher who has been working for the district for a long time, as well as a father of 3 very young kids. So why would a man throw away his life, his career and his family just like that? Who knows, maybe he did do it. If that's the case, he deserves everything coming to him. But on the other hand, what if these accusations are false? An innocent man's life will be over, and until real evidence comes into the picture I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt."
Albany,39gd4h,WintersKing,4,Thu Jun 11 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, one of those ex over privileged kids here. I had Mr. Ruggiero as an art teacher, he was a good teacher, a bit quiet, but really liked showing us how to use different mediums. Girls all had crushes on him. a lot of kids in Patroon used to eat lunch in his classroom/studio while he did some personal project. Overall the paper did its job, even if the girl was making it up, doesn't matter no one will  know until someone looks into it. Father Doyle of Mater Christi was accused of child molestation, he complied in every way with paper/investigators and helped clear it up. False reports happen, but we still need to look into them. For once I'm pleased with BCSD's response, just hope facts prevail, and that emotional responses one way or the other, are kept in check."

I don't like the TU but see nothing wrong with what thy did.   Beyond that a teacher inviting a student alone to his house is dumb dumb dumb for just the reasons you outlined.  Even if he just wanted to show her rabbits and she fabricated the rest, he has already demonstrated terrible judgement.  I have to imagine it is against the policy of just about any school district for personnel to invite students to their residences.  Or if they do they need to have parental consent.  Yes, things were not like this in the 1950s. But this isn't the 1950s."

Albany,39gd4h,sleazepleeze,3,Thu Jun 11 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"No, if the teacher wanted to offer advice/mentoring/tutoring/support/just show some damn rabbits to a 13 year old student, they should probably just check with the parents before inviting them over. I don't think that makes a community less healthy or friendly, but events like this scaring the hell out of parents does. Edit: And if the teacher felt they NEEDED to talk to this student without their parents around, because of issues at school or at home, they should tell a superior or police or someone, so their ass is covered."
Albany,39gd4h,joequin,2,Thu Jun 11 18:09:39 2015 UTC,How could all that paranoia and defensiveness not lead to a less friendly community? This fear of other people and the law is exactly what has caused communities to live in bubbles that end at the edge of their own lawns.

No. Should her parents still be allowed to decide what adults their daughter hangs out with in private? Yes.  Blame the parents who don't let their kids have any freedom, or blame adults who are too afraid of distrust to ever risk being involved in a child's life for the lack of community you see.

Unless they actually get commercial insurance or faithfully state that they are using their car for business, whatever carrier they have will bolt...   Just because Uber and Lyft provide blanket policies to their drivers doesn't mean that settling up in an auto accident will be just the same and it's not easy in the first place unless you like to get or don't even realize that your getting taken advantage of.  I used to date a girl who's father was an insurance adjuster who worked out of their home and then responded to claims each day.  I'd overhear him all the time on the phone with his boss, ""oh once this claim is done we're dropping this asshole/nutcase/whackjob/whatever""  or ""this claim is so getting denied cause they were doing X"" or ""he wants us to do Y, but he's not getting all of that."" or ""We're just going to give him 8 grand and tell him to shut-up""  Most people don't realize... they get NADA on their car.   Progressive isn't replacing your bolted on turbo... or your rims.. or your aftermarket radio or whatever else you do to your car or truck.  It says right on these websites that blanket policies are supplemental which means that if one of these people decides they want to be a cabbie one day and crash into me:   God help me that they called their insurance carrier and said: ""Hey I decided that I'm going to use my car for business now, specifically, I am going to cart humans around.... and I don't mind the increase in premium!"" I'll be sitting around with my thumb up my ass with a broken car and/or in the hospital while their insurance policy and Uber/Lyfts insurance policy duke it out. No thank you.   Now I understand that Uber/Lyft drivers are required to show documentation.... But sadly I trust scummy slimmy asshole-ish cab drivers to keep their paperwork/insurance in order as it's their job/lifeblood over some dude trying to make a few extra bucks on Uber/Lyft."
Albany,398nin,phantom_eight,3,Wed Jun 10 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"The current cab drivers crash all the time run red lights all day every day. Just drive by advantage taxi at 137 Lark Street, there's at least 6 crashed vehicles out FRONT daily, that's not even counting the ones their actually fixing. If an accident happened in a Lyft/uber car I'm sure it would get settled the same way a normal car accident would. I don't see why there would be any difference whatsoever unless perhaps there were bodily injuries."
Albany,398nin,cmaxby,-1,Thu Jun 11 16:39:02 2015 UTC,"Commercial insurance ( what uber and Lyft drivers in NYC are required to carry), livery insurance (cab insurance) and personal insurance (what you and I have on our cars) are very different animals in terms of cost and limits. Commercial and livery have a much higher required BI limit than personal insurance. Most regular people have basic NY limits (25/50) which you want no part of. Add to that that your regular person who would be part time using their car for ride sharing has little to no knowledge of their insurance policy/rates/limits and there's a good chance you get into an underinsured vehicle. Sucks if you get into an accident.  There are only limited insurance carriers that will write a ride share policy and I know of at least one that is stopping as of this year."
Albany,398nin,cmaxby,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"There's not a ""good chance"" I'll get into an uninsured vehicle. In New York you have to have insurance to even get plates. Seeing as how you need a 2011+ car to use uber/Lyft, there's a pretty damn good chance that they WILL have insurance. Driving a car that's worth $20k or so and not having insurance is just dumb and reckless. And even if you got into an accident, if you were hurt you should be a responsible adult and have your own health insurance to cover anything/everything."
Albany,398nin,cmaxby,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"I said underinsured, not uninsured. There's a difference. NY has mandatory $50k PIP and $25/$50k BI for all vehicles with the BI being split between all people in the vehicle. Basic limits with deductible is the standard purchased coverage by most NYers, no matter how much the vehicle costs bc it's the cheapest option and people don't know any better/ only worry about the collision bc they never think they'll get hurt in an accident."

Albany,398nin,phantom_eight,0,Mon Jun 15 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"Because the cost of an accident is not just limited to your medical bills. There's also lost wages, cost of transport to medical facilities, and the less tangible things like inability to lead the life you had prior to the accident.   Your health insurance isn't going to pick up any of the medical bills from the accident once the know you were in a car accident until the PIP policy exhausts because PIP is primary. You wouldn't want them to, anyway, because you'd be handing over a copay out of your own pocket each time you had to visit the doctor."
Albany,398nin,Uniontech,4,Mon Jun 15 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"We have the worst cabs of any place I have ever been, and I travel worldwide.  Our cabs are disgusting, drivers are careless and rude.

I recommend getting new cars, hiring pleasant people, and being in places on time.

Albany,398nin,Uniontech,-1,Thu Jun 11 04:55:49 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not in the cab business, the other guy with the down votes obviously is though.  If the State actually passes a law that has decent provisions regarding insurance I would more favorable of it.  There's already been stories about denied claims for drivers on the clock, but not carrying passengers.    I think any Uber or Lyft driver that is involved in an accident and does not have proper insurance, as in their personal carrier denies a claim based on a ""driving for profit"" clause or something similar, it should be a jail-able offense such as a class C or B misdemeanor.  Cases with personal injury should be upgraded to a class A misdemeanor.  If you get that settled... I'm all for sticking it to the cab companies.   You shouldn't have to call dispatch and fight for them to quote you over the phone... then tell the cabbie dispatch said X and that you wont get in the car unless they agree.... that's if they ever show up..."
Albany,398nin,themadskeptic,2,Thu Jun 11 05:31:37 2015 UTC,"Seriously, why does anyone think I am in the cab business...

The whole ""subcontractor"" but really employee issue is serious and being abused by Uber, Lyft, Fed Ex and others. People really need to look into the issue and then question why Lyft and Uber are astroturfing for this bill. They aren't in existence to do you or their drivers a favor.  I would also like to add that Uber (and I believe Lyft) have both claimed that the ADA didn't apply to them and that their drivers are the ones who have to ensure they can transport people with disabilities. The end result had been people being left at the curb because an Uber driver didn't want to put someone's wheelchair in the trunk or similar blatant ( and illegal) refusals. Uber is currently being sued over this issue.  Yes, the taxis in the Capital District suck - epic-ly - but that is no reason to avoid the real issue of inadequate public transportation by endorsing a system that abuses its employees and claims it had no responsibility to respect the ADA.

Albany,398nin,choochooape,2,Wed Jun 10 03:43:31 2015 UTC,"I hope it's not people flipping on their personal car when they have the time because nys auto insurance is highly regulated and you will be dropped by your insurance carrier when they find out you're using your personal vehicle for livery purposes.   In smaller markets like Albany, it's been found repeatedly that the drivers signing up for Uber and Lyft are existing taxi drivers. You'll have the same problems that you already have just riding in the passenger seat of someone who doesn't need to carry the liability insurance that a taxi driver does."
Albany,398nin,what_comes_after_q,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:18:40 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what this law is doing is changing the ""ride sharing law"" because you currently can't do that. With this, any passenger vehicle will be able to.

It depends really on where you are going in NYC.  My father being a Met fan...... we have pounded it down and up the Taconic, it can be like a race track after the game sometimes.  We've  also gone to Poughkeepsie via 87 and get on the Metro North tons of times if we don't want to drive the whole way.  We get into Grand Central and go where-ever via Subway.  Also, if you head back to western Mass frequently... the Mass Pike is right there...  Ravena doesn't really have a bar/downtown scene, it's a quiet village with basic needs.

I wanted MegaBus to work out SO BADLY, it just kept failing haha.  Conversely, I've never had an issue with some 20-odd greyhound trips.  Of course, Amtrak kicks both of them in the butt. But I digress."
Albany,394bub,xueye,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"I've only had one issue with Megabus where the bus was 90 minutes late, they promptly gave me a full refund without even asking. Every other trip (and there have been dozens) have been flawless.   If Amtrak was $20 a ride I'd exclusively take the train. Alas the hour saved and extra leg room isn't worth a $40 ticket."
Albany,394bub,carpy22,2,Tue Jun 9 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to check Craigslist. There aren't any apartment complex's within walking distance of downtown Albany that I know of. There are apartments right across the street from Albany Memorial, but they don't have a good reputation at the moment. The further from the city you go the nicer the Apartments will be, you could always check out the area of Lark St. They will have nice brownstones and older rehabbed apartments, they are very nice in my opinion."
Albany,394bub,irondevil518,2,Tue Jun 9 10:47:48 2015 UTC,"Center Square is walkable to downtown, and living on the park means quick and easy access to the highways via Henry Johnson Boulevard. There are a few big buildings that average $1,000/month (that's my current price), and many smaller offerings anywhere from $750 to $1200."

Albany,394bub,unicornprincess92,2,Tue Jun 9 06:04:44 2015 UTC,"On the Tri City Rentals idea, Stonehenge Gardens is also very nice.  It's at least within walking distance of some stuff (~1 mile to Juniors/Madison Pour House/The Point) and it's close to the bus routes on Western.  I think it's 3 miles to Lark, but that's not too awful and could be a nice walk in the summer.  It's also right next to 85 which leads directly onto 90.  And it's quite a bit closer to the hospital (still need to drive, but 85 -> 90 -> Exit 5 is 5-10 minutes driving).  Rent runs around 1000 for a 1 bedroom or 1100 for a 2 bedroom, but that at least includes heat/hot water, and there's an option for garage parking if you want."

They have a lot of things included in the rental price as well.  The parking is much better there than what it's like downtown.  If you walk from the apartments to memorial you pass a chinese place a sub place a pizza place a sports bar (ship's pub) and a fancier restaurant (risotto).  The walk to downtown would be a few miles, but in my experience it's better to visit downtown than to actually live there."

For context, we anticipated a burst altitude of 36,000 m, with an ascent rate of just under 7 m/s and a descent rate estimated at an average of 5-6 m/s.  The flight began at approximately 11:40:25 EDT, and our estimated touchdown was between 13:45 and 14:15. Our analysis of what telemetry data we do have indicate that our models may have been slightly off, predicting a landing too far south (by a few to several miles)."

Albany,391bwn,Mabepossibly,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:40:58 2015 UTC,Parking is simple. Just follow signs from I 787 and it will lead you to the parking garage under the plaza. Take an elevator ride up and your on the plaza deck. You never have to cross surface streets to access the garage from the interstate so it fills and empties faster than your typical garage after a concert.    Street parking around the plaza is designed to be nearly impossible.  But 3-4 blocks west of the Plaza is Lark Street. Home to a ton of great restaurants and bars.

The last time I came home for an extended period of time it was hard to adjust to life back in the west. I guess one just gets super used to a certain lifestyle and a major change can be a shock to the system.  I found myself coming to the peace pagoda a lot. It wasn't exactly familiar. But it had a certain calming quality to it that really put me at ease.  The monks are also super nice. The last time I was there I helped them moving some stuff from one of the temples to a storage shed and they let me join in on the afternoon tea service.

There are more options and I think you will be more likely to meet people.  I feel the bars in Troy tend to be groups of students who will stay self-contained rather than bars filled with young professionals. There are some nice apartments on Madison between Lark and the museum that are worth checking out. Off-street parking, ~$800/month  Do check out the Troy Farmer's Market though!"
Albany,38ujd1,angel1023,3,Sun Jun 7 20:03:32 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I think Troy's bar and restaurant scene blows Albany out of the water.

The neighborhood that was once there  was mostly middle-lower class families of Italian descent. Nelson Rockefeller hated having to transverse this poor neighborhood to get from the governor's mansion to the Capitol. Using eminent domain, 8% of Albany's population was forcibly removed from their homes.   Furthermore, the plaza segregates the center square neighborhood from the rest of downtown. With its imposing barricade of a building that lines S Swan Street  To me, the Empire State Plaza represents authoritarian power of the wealthy elite. It represents all that is wrong with Albany."

Rent in Latham is inexpensive from what I hear but there really is not much going on in that area for night life. Its very commercial and overdeveloped IMO. Depends on what you are looking for but I can't say that Albany county is a very bike friendly county overall. It was listed as one of the worst bike friendly cities I remember reading. Not to say you can't but from how I'm interpreting your job school and Latham locations get ready for some long bike rides. Google maps is your friend to plan routes I think to give you a better idea.

SUNY - The main UAlbany Campus/NanoTech are pretty easy to get to.  SUNY students ride the bus on Western ave/Washington ave and maybe Central for free.  At least when I attended they did.  Whole Foods - Thats right where the northway meets all the colonie shopping.  In the morning its pretty dead on Wolf road and Central isn't too bad.  After 5:00 it can be pretty crazy though.  But there are bus stops super close to Whole Foods.  Latham - Pretty easy to get to, there are a million ways to get to Rt 9 which I assume connects to your jiu-jitsu.  To get to Latham from the Schenectady side of 87 usually means going by the Airport and roads near there, which can be pretty busy after 5.  TLDR:  Commute wise I think its easier to live in or around Albany/Colonie, getting to Latham is easy from Albany.  Not sure where the best rent will be though."

Albany,38eub3,jayjaywalker3,9,Wed Jun 3 19:17:55 2015 UTC,A million times yes. The taxi situation in Albany has been nothing but horrible for as long as I can remember. Here's hoping that this encourages cab companies to step up their game.
Albany,38eub3,sleepyeyed,6,Wed Jun 3 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"I'd give a testicle for a reliable cab company in the capital area. I've called for cabs and usually wait at least an hour for them to show up, if they do at all. It's lead to many ruined plans to go out and enjoy the night life responsibly.  It also wouldn't be so bad if they were honest. However most of them lie to you over the phone or give false arrival times. It's one thing if you tell me your cab is going to take an hour to show up. It's another story if you tell me 15 minutes and then every time I call after that 15 minutes to tell me it'll just be another 10 minutes. If it's not coming just tell me man."
Albany,38eub3,Sourowe,5,Thu Jun 4 00:22:27 2015 UTC,"This needs to happen ASAP, I'm tired of being picked up by taxi-drivers that are more hammered than I am, running red lights driving down Washington going 45 in their 20 year old cars with the airbag lights and check engine lights on. Then after all that I gotta cough up $13 to go from fucking lark street to Pearl? Every experience I've ever had with uber has been amazing. The drivers are more than polite, they drive very nice cars and offer to charge your phone and hand you the aux cable the second you get in, it's just all around a great service that's perfect for getting around.

Both of my parents have such fond memories of taking the bus up to thatcher every day during the summer to swim and play sports and go hiking.

Mechanicville/Stillwater has older homes but they are also much cheaper. Unfortunately you would have to live in Mechanicville or Stillwater. Your commute would be very short though. Saratoga can get pretty pricey but you may be able to find something and the school district is pretty good.  You could always just get a place in Malta.

It's a Saturday evening and you want to grab dinner and catch a band with your significant other? Head 20 minutes north and check out Caroline St. in Saratoga. 20 minutes south you have Albany, don't come here though because there really isn't much to offer. Clifton Park is nice because it has pretty much every big name store you can think of (minus Best Buy, the only thing that ever bothered me about CO)."

Albany,3865xc,Giblet15,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:36:41 2015 UTC,In layman's terms it's a microchip factory. They may not tell you what your job will be because they may honestly not know. If you are going for a position that doesn't require a very specific skill set then they may just do a general interview and then decide what the position would be when making an offer. They are growing insanely fast so they will have a massive variety of openings.
Albany,3865xc,maszpiwo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"It depends what your background and experience is.  If you have no education or experience in the semiconductor industry, you would probably be hired as a tool operator.  Essentially you would be responsible for running wafers through a set of tools.  The shifts are 12 hours, but for what you'd be doing the pay isn't super awful, especially when compared to other jobs you could get that require no prior experience in a specific field.  If you do have prior experience/education in the industry, you could be hired as an engineering technician.  You'd be responsible for troubleshooting issues on the tools (mostly software related) and coordinating with engineers.  They also work 12 hour shifts, but the pay is higher and you'd have more/tougher responsibilities.  Unless you have an advanced engineering degree, you probably wouldn't be hired as a full blown engineer.  If you have more questions feel free to send me a PM so we're not hijacking the thread."
Albany,3865xc,jeffedge,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:04:38 2015 UTC,makes sense i guess. they offered me $12 an hour for a 12 1/2 hour shift. most places with heavy shifts like that usually pay way more so that's why i turned them down. last time i worked 12's i made $18 with no experience.
Albany,3865xc,carpy22,2,Wed Jun 3 19:22:57 2015 UTC,Everyone I know working at Global lives in Saratoga.
Albany,3865xc,maszpiwo,2,Tue Jun 2 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"Most people I know that work there also live in Saratoga, but they're pretty much all under 30.  There's a lot to do in terms of bars and the track in the summer, but someone looking to buy a house would probably be better off looking elsewhere.  Not to say there aren't very nice areas away from that, it's just something to consider.  On that note OP, Saratoga has the horse track that attracts many thousands of people on weekends in the late summer.  Certain parts of town get extremely busy/almost impossible to drive in at times.  Just something to consider if you're looking near the track."
Albany,3865xc,adipose_rex1,2,Wed Jun 3 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"So it would definitely be at your 30 minute mark for a commute and it is a suburb, but my family relocated to the region last year and after renting we settled down and bought a house in Delmar. It fits your budget and the schools are great. It is close to Albany but on the southern side of the city from Malta. I find it has easy access to a highway no matter which direction you want to head. If you live in old Delmar it is a walkable place for life (grocery, pharmacy, school, post office, etc) and there is a great farmers market. Feel free to PM me for details."

You can tell them I referred you. Patrick was born and raised in Delmar, and they're both very active in the community. Julie was amazing through out the whole process and we had them show us so many houses. They know the ins and outs of every neighborhood, and sometimes even the stories of individual houses. Since buying our house they've also remained a huge help recommending various contractors or handy men, even dance studios for our children. We also didn't know this until the end of the transaction but they donate a percentage of their fee to a local charity and we got to chose which one. They were really great.

Albany,3865xc,NetFlix_AllDay,3,Mon Jun 8 09:17:50 2015 UTC,"This is always a difficult question to answer, there's just so many variables. Personally, I'm dead set against the suburbs, so I can't recommend them. Places like Clifton Park and Halfmoon are hot beds for new housing construction, but many of those homes are starting at $300k+. Being that you're probably working at Global Foundries it would make sense for you to live in either Saratoga Springs (super nice, but super expensive), the village of Ballston Spa, the village of Round Lake, or the Village of Malta. All are in good school districts, and all will be a short commute (especially Malta).   I would recommend against Waterford, the school district is pretty small and the town is pretty dumpy. It can be pretty to visit, but once you're there for any length of time you discover that it's one of those small towns with a population that never left.   Alternatively, you could go to the north and live in Glens Falls. I've never been, but I hear it's a nice up a coming city."

Albany,3865xc,maszpiwo,2,Wed Jun 3 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"I would rent for two main reasons:  If you don't really know this area you may thing you'd like a certain town but end up hating it for what ever reason. So while renting here you can do a thorough search.  It's been pretty well known that facility isn't booming. The job may be promised to be long term, but the position may disappear. They can't even fill up the fake city of shoppes they built expecting all the extra people to influx there. It's like an odd little ghost town.   I really think it's a bad idea to buy a house."
Albany,3865xc,NetFlix_AllDay,2,Tue Jun 2 23:40:01 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard that. From what I understand they're still under construction and adding additional wings to the facility. Renting is always the safer option, I'm just excited to buy my first home."

Albany,3865xc,maszpiwo,2,Tue Jun 2 12:27:54 2015 UTC,"Malta, or Wilton would fit that build if you went north, Colonie or Halfmoon if you went south.  Taxes are fairly cheap in all of those places which help keep your overall cost down, and could increase your buying power.  As for Schools, Malta, and Most of Halfmoon are Shen, big school, but lots of programs because of it's size Most of Wilton is Saratoga, which is a great school, big, but not as big as Shen.  Colonie has 2 school districts, North and South. North is a better district IMO. You probably would want to be looking in the Latham area for your price range, and to be in this district."

You're not supposed to bike on the sidewalk, you're not supposed to ride over 8mph, and every bike is supposed to have a bell that the operator is supposed to sound within 30 ft of every intersection they cross.  Edit: This kind of applies.. There is a guy in the Melrose neighborhood that rides around on an electric scooter - the style that you stand on - and walks his dog (or rides it, while his dog runs in front of him).

Like, less genetic diversity then a Hapsburg. The family tree isn't a tree, it's a ladder.   There are a couple of different shelters and adoption services in Albany. You might be able to find a golden or a healthy mutt with the main features of a golden. When I got my latest dog, she was from Homeward Bound in Schenectady and they had a lot of different breeds, but it's pretty much whatever dogs get rescued from kill shelters in the south or older dogs from the area who were surrendered for various reasons. You can keep an eye on their Facebook and website to see the available dogs and new arrivals. My other dog is from the Mowhawk Hudson humane society, though she was adopted by my girlfriend before we met each other so I can't really speak for the selection. My understanding is they receive strays from Albany county animal control services.   I hope you will consider not supporting people who are more concerned with a piece of paper stating a  pedigree then the long term health of the puppies they sell. There are plenty of awesome dogs that need homes right now. I recommend you approach it with an open mind. The dog we got at Homeward Bound picked us out as much as we picked her out."

Many proper breeders make you sign a contract and check that you have experience, yard, etc... They will want to meet you.  They should want to meet you.  Most importantly they will want a good home and will always offer to take the puppy in if it is a bad fit.   I have a lot of experience working this sort of stuff via shelters, aspca, and even dog shows.   Ask breeders a lot of questions, if they shy away, stay out.  A good breeder will vary mating geographically as much as possible, will light out / potty train a puppy  (or at least start).  They  will create an environment for puppies that they will be proud for you too see.  They will socialize them, expose to noises and smells and feed high quality puppy food, as well as deworm at least twice and have all shots up to code. You should be able to contact the bredder's vet.  NEVER buy from a store.   If you have questions send PM.  Adopting from a shelter is great, however sometimes you know what you want and for that call many, many breeders, ask many many questions.   I am not pro or anti breeder, but if you will go that route, these are the guidelines you should follow."

If you care more about your dog being a brag-worthy breed than how the animals are treated you are also a bad person. I have faith you as a member of our community will do the right thing, please at least do some research on how breeders operate before giving them money to expand and hurt more animals."

I will recommend the Troy Farmers market for veggies, but for plants, I see them but am not too invested in my observation as I mainly grow wildflowers from seed.  But I do know I pick up some random planted pots a few times during the summer and its all wonderful.  I'm in Albany proper, so my closest choices are Hewitts, Olsens and Krug farms (Everett Road).  I like Hewitts the most, Olsens seems to have the ""we serve rich people"" tax added to everything and I haven't been to Krug in years but my mother swears by it.  There's also Yonder Farms on 155, but I haven't been there in a long time.  I have had some success from Home Depot.  And I get that they're wilted and what not, but most plants wilt in 85+ degrees without water.  My cauliflower looked like shit at about noon today, but by 3 it looked thriving (watered it at 11). I got my cauliflower, peppers (purple, orange, jalapeno, cherry and wax), roma tomatoes, eggplant (typical and japanese), 3 kinds of lettuce, squash and zuccini from Hewitts. I got red and white onions from Lowes (though they're very easy to grow) and some cherry tomatoes and summer squash from the Troy Farmers Market.   Side note: I had 3 yards of soil delivered from Olsens today, it's rich and wonderful and my garden should be producing like crazy this year.  My soil is crap, so I finally bit the bullet and just footed the cost for some good soil."

I buy all my herbs from there, last year I grew habaneros which grew to perfection as well as basil. The basil grew like weeds, and we made fresh, delicious pesto every week.   This year we bought Morning Glories, Basil, Big Bertha Peppers, Dill, Mint, Pansies etc and every single plant is taking off.  Plus the staff there is top notch, they know their shit and they go out of their way to help you. 15/10, would buy flowers from there everytime.

You could tell he was clearly working on the place and I knew of the story in the local paper that he had taken on the place to save the animals... so I was very accepting of the condition the place was in at the time.  You'll have to check out reviews, but I talked with the owner and I can only assume it has gotten better.  He seemed like a really good guy that really does care about the animals.  All in all, we had a good time and we got to see a variety of animals for a low price.   The website says that Adults are $15, kids under 13 are $10, and under 3 are free.

Albany,370ng7,crackhammer,6,Sat May 23 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"I used Dr. Smail in Troy for mine and had a great experience. I had 4 impacted wisdom teeth, but he removed them and I had absolutely no pain or negative side effects. I ate solid food that day and I only took ibproufen the first day. I would very highly recommend his practice."
Albany,370ng7,devvy_downer,4,Sat May 23 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"My daughter went to doctor Smail in Troy. I'd trust him over anyone else. Here is why:  She was in elementary school on the playground in 4th grade and some asshole kid got mad at her. He took his shoe off, threw it at her head and knocked her permanent molar out. We rushed her to the dentist (he sent us to the ortho in the same building as Doctor Smail because her dentist at the time was an idiot unable to re-implant it, but that is a story for another time).  Off we went to the Ortho in Doctor Smail's building who tried to reattach her tooth tooth and wired it into her head. He told us if the original dentist had done this (as he should have been able to) it stood an excellent chance of taking. He said it had been in the glass of milk a little too long, but might work.  My poor kid had a horrible day, smashed face and re-implanted tooth and off we went back home.  After the amount of time we had to wait (month, or 2 months? I don't remember but long enough to see if it would start reattaching) we went back.  Xrays showed it was Anklyose and had to be pulled back the fuck out.  Now my kid was being bullied by the same kid who had hit her in the face with his shoe so all this and the turmoil was not a good time for a 9 year old.   We got the pills that would make her ""relaxed"" before the surgery and made the appointment. That morning we got to the office and my daughter asked me what she was supposed to feel like. I told her woozy. She told me she felt like she always does. So here we are, about to go in for this thing to get prepped for it to get pulled back out again and she is telling me the meds didn't get her relaxed.  I let the woman at the desk know the situation and she asked if my daughter did the proper prep, ect. I confirmed. So they said to go in and talk to doctor Smail and maybe there is something he can do.  We got in the little OR room, and I took my parent seat with my daughter standing in front of me. The nurses were prepping the trays. I could see my kid was a nervous wreck. I told her I was sure he had something besides that pill so she could calm down before her Novocain shots started and if not, we could bail out and find someone else who would make it all right for her.   Well. doctor Smail comes in and from the second he enters the room he put my daughter at ease. He talked to her before he did anything. If I remember right he talked to her about everything that she went through and how it was important that he made her not feel any pain.   The key was he was very gentle talked to her, didn't rush anything. And then he explained that he had a different medicine that would sedate her so she would not feel the tooth coming out. They didn't need the same meds as you do for normal extraction because this thing had only grown into her jaw. But still, she needed many needles of Novocaine. (he didn't tell her about all the needles)  She seemed to understand but what he said last was what did it for us.  Do you trust me to not hurt you?  My daughter told him yes.   They gave her nitros and she never knew she got needles. He was so crafty that he hid the needles from her site. I wish you could see how he did it. That guy was a wizard.   I mean if you asked her for years, she swore she never had a needle. Once she was older and knew things of life she realized she must have had Novocaine that day.  If I ever need to have a tooth pulled I'm going to him. Oh,also, when I had my wisdoms pulled,  I went to the guy he trained under.   No lie, that guy's name is Dr. Ripp.  TL/DR Dr. Smail in Troy. Eased my daughter's nerves after a tragic situation and pre-surgery meds didn't work. He was fantastic with her.   EDIT: I was just talking to my daughter about this and she reminded me it was the molar and not her canine. And she just showed me the tooth she saved in the little plastic tooth they give you. TIL teeth last forever in those plastic cases."

Seeing Bon Iver was like a religious experience. Basically the amphitheater is in a field right next to the brewery. You are surrounded by hills and trees. Its a pretty relaxed environment, there will be enough space to walk around a bit.  Food: There are plenty of food truck vendors that serve plenty of options. Ommegang also has their own Belgian-style food that is delicious. Their meats are marinated in their brew and their fries are pretty fantastic. They also have ATMs set up.  Beer: Its a Brewery, the only beer served is Ommegang but its delicious.  Parking is free just right at the venue. There will be signs.   The concert should be over by about 10ish. I've never been camping before, though there are a lot of people that do it. From Albany its only about a 90 minute drive (straight down 88) so it's easy to come up for the concert and drive back after its over."

I pulled up to a stop light checked my mirrors to see what the cop was doing and and boom... I was hit head on while at the light on madison by the CVS. Some 18 year old who blew through the light coming from the opposite direction, tboned a car, and then smashed into me. Luckily the cop saw everything, and honestly i wouldn't have put my seatbelt on if they didn't start following me in the first place. Probably saved me from serious harm. Airbags deployed, got pretty banged up, but walked away... with my car totalled in a lawn.   They took me to st. Peters, got my wits about me to a degree. i didn't understand NY ""no fault"" and had no emergency insurance so i insisted they release me. They did at 1am. Concussed, i sauntered into the dark outside St. Peters and had no fucking clue where i was. Called a cab, they said it would be an hour, called my friends, they were too drunk. i started walking the wrong direction and came upon a Papa John's. Asked them if i could get a pizza for delivery and if i could ride with it (to my friends), but they were closing and they were not allowed regardless.   I told them what happened (still had my bracelet on) the manager let one of the delivery dudes leave while he finished closing. The employee brought me down to lark so i could meet my friends and i have a beer to mourn my totalled kia... RIP optima prime.

He has been nothing but nice to multicultural people and I would not trust that review based on personal experience.

Albany,36k14h,Mabepossibly,3,Wed May 20 00:05:37 2015 UTC,went to the fuller ave location once and he seemed nice. Prices are high because of the type of meats.  A regular beef burger is average priced. Dave does like to have a conversation with you.   My friends have went to burger centric a couple times and they thought he was a little cooky too and i'm pretty sure he invited them to bring some beers and hang out in the restaurant if they wanted to.  I honestly would'nt be suprised though if the bad reviews are true even though my conversation with him was pleasant and we bonded over being brown and stuff.  You could just tell he could go off on people on yelp if that makes any sense.  Eccentric definitely

If that response he sent to the yelp person is really from him, than that crosses the line into actual racism. Either way, it sounds like he is kinda rude so I'll be avoiding it. I never understood why some folks like restaurants where managers/wait staff are somewhat rude. I thought the soup nazi was a funny episode of Seinfeld but nothing I want to experience in real life.

I would say take it with a grain of salt but we attempted to use an Entertainment book coupon and got the same kind of response at his old place. We were given a different menu with less than half of what they served and were told that coupon people were attempting to put him out of business. Which unless I am wrong you have to agree to be put in the entertainment book. Here is a yelp from his old place. www.yelp.com/biz/burger-centric-albany
Albany,36k14h,bipthefool,0,Wed May 20 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"Dave's exotic burgers is a great place to go eat. You can't really go off of one persons story for a restaurant. I have been there a bunch of times and I am always greeted at the door by Dave, and he comes over and talks to his customers every time. Either Dave was having a bad day, which people have, or these people aren't telling the whole story about their experience. Also the prices are high because where are you going to find the meat he uses like camel, boa, lion or tiger?"
Albany,36k14h,irondevil518,0,Wed Jun 3 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"That's Dave for you.  Whatever you do don't ask him do describe what any of the burgers are like... Yknow... In case you've never eaten kangaroo or lion before...   My experience. ""What's kangaroo like?""  ""Are you gonna order it?""  ""I don't know that's why I'm asking what it's like..""  ""Get out of you're not ordering!""  I got a lion burger.  I like Dave."

I've been a customer of his since Burger Centric and I make sure to swing by his Fuller Road location every time I'm in town. I've eaten burgers across the States, I've eaten burgers around the world - Dave's should be a cherished landmark institution.  Very very very little comes close.   He's a chatty and unique character, and he's been known to say some hilariously challenging things - especially about his own people. Dude has a lot of great stories and he's incredibly politically savvy. But he's certainly not racist or mean.   He's just nice to nice people. And he kicks mean people out. I've seen him reward friendly customers of all ethnic backgrounds (including my Chinese friends). This yelp situation is kinda disappointing and crossing the line, but I think it's misunderstood.

Albany,36i1y7,dangoodspeed,6,Tue May 19 17:41:17 2015 UTC,How do the locals feel about the ESP architecture? My girlfriend is an architect and despises it. I don't mind Brutalism in small doses but ESP is so overwhelming. It makes me feel like I'm behind the Iron Curtain.  Edit: is asking opinions discouraged here?
Albany,36i1y7,cytopathic_effect,6,Tue May 19 15:46:46 2015 UTC,"I love the architecture but hate the urban design. As a symbol of the city, I think it's incredibly unique and powerful. Coming into town on 90 West, I know I'm almost home when the Corning Tower pokes over the hills in East Greenbush for the first time.  In an urban setting, though, having those tall, skinny buildings on a sprawling campus is a spectacular waste of space, particularly when said campus lies empty and unused most of the time (it's closed all winter for christ's sake). It could have been built on a site 1/5 the size and kept most of the surrounding neighborhood intact, presumably to benefit from all that business.  Also, the near-complete lack of pedestrian permeability on Swan Street and Eagle Street has the unfortunate effect of severing Center Square (demand for retail and entertainment) from downtown (in theory, retail and entertainment)."
Albany,36i1y7,albmw114,3,Tue May 19 20:00:19 2015 UTC,"You hit most of the points I was going to make. While the ESP gets a lot of hate it is under-appreciated for creating a skyline for the city. While that may not be the be all end all or make up for the loss of so much housing, it is nice that the State's capital has a presence when you're driving into it. That wasn't by mistake either, Rockefeller and his architects knew what they were doing.   Unfortunately, as you said, they paid no attention to the design at the street level. It's an incredible thing that these designs, wherever they are, were so meticulous, but took no heed of the impacts on the immediate surrounding. Downtown would be much healthier today if there was a stronger connection with Center Square."
Albany,36i1y7,UpSNYer,3,Tue May 19 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, they paid attention, all right. All those highways, the ability to go straight from the interstate to the parking lot without ever interacting with the city, that was all quite intentional. The planners subscribed to the Robert Moses School of Urban Design, which believes that it doesn't matter if there's nowhere to go as long as you can get there quickly."

Albany,36kd2b,omahoopsfan,2,Wed May 20 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"I went to Sage for a little bit,which is right next to the law school, and I stayed in University Heights College Suites. I'm not sure how the law school works, but for sage the rent was rolled into my tuition. You do have suitemates, but it's a really nice place. And everything is included. My favorite part was that every suite had their own thermostats, so if you want it 80 degrees you can, or if you want to run the ac all day you can do that too.  It's basically a dorm, so you do have to sign in guests and everything. But that's also kinda nice because they have security on duty 24/7, so its pretty safe."
Albany,36kd2b,kaileemonster,1 point,Wed May 20 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"+1    I was the first group of students to live in there back in 2003, I went to Sage as well.  I actually got to tour the place when they were still building it.  They had built out one room fully so they could give tours while the rest was all still being framed and filled in.  At the time it was about $5000 or so which would be under OP's $750 a month.  Who knows how much they've jacked the price since then.   Either way the furniture was nice and it has a full kitchen with dish washer.  The place was great!  Lots of fun stories about that place.     It's funny that OP is going to ALS... it was always the Law School or ACP students that would burn food and bring the fire dept.   I don't mean to offend, just don't be one of them.   No common sense for students in the most expensive/demanding educational degrees.....   Back then if you set more than two smoke detectors off in a suite (The common area + a room) it would dump the whole building.   If you set just one off, only the alarms in that suite would go off, but Albany Fire would have to come anyway.   After repeatedly getting calls all year... if just a room was going off.. they'd walk right up, pull the fire alarm handle, and dump the whole building so we all had to deal with it... I also had a problem with some ACP students.   These were clearly stuck up students (rich girls that go bar hoping with white blouses and cowboy hats.....) that I got them to admit finally, neither of them had ever lived in an apartment before.  They always complained to management about the noise we made and we always said we weren't making noise or it was general noise.   For example we'd pull a chair away from the table to sit down and they'd start banging on the ceiling, real physco stuff...  The next year one of my roomates graduated and they paired us with someone who ended up being the best man at my wedding... He was actually a University Heights security guard and with the exception of the new guy, we all got the same rooms again, even the girls below, since we were returning students.   The first time these rich stuck up kids complained...he settled that real quick.   It was fun times.    At the time Albany College of Pharmacy provided the internet for the building.   They used to block torrents and the internet kind of sucked for gaming/Counter Strike/ect...   I went down the management and asked them for the ""service"" address for the building.   I was able to call Time Warner and get a cable modem and it worked up in there...  I told them they give us TV for free, but I want a modem without paying for TV... and I didn't want the extra charge for not having TV.   Sure as shit... they did it....   I heard that one dude going to ALS or ACP was from the EU and managed to get digital cable so he could watch the world cup..."

Albany,36m0ba,spitfingers,11,Wed May 20 11:10:13 2015 UTC,"I used to be kinda in a similar mindset that the people working at mcdonalds didn't really 'deserve' $15 per hour.   However, one of the things that changed my mind was basically the notion that taxpayers are subsidizing food and healthcare for minimum wage employers.   When Walmart pays their full time employees minimum wage, those people clearly can't afford a real health insurance and need to go on government benefits which are paid by the rest of the state. If the the corporations are forced to pay workers a living wage, then it'll be less of a burden on tax payers."
Albany,36m0ba,Klinefelter,7,Wed May 20 13:02:44 2015 UTC,"Historically speaking there has never been a significant rise in inflation with a minimum wage increase. Prices at places who rely upon minimum wage labor may increase, but even then not enough to offset the increase in spending capital now available to millions of previously poverty wage families.  Secondly you're right that it is ridiculous that college grads and professionals barely make the same amount. However, it's wrong to say minimum wage shouldn't be raised simply because ""smarter"" people are being screwed too. Especially if the minimum wage increase to $15 does occur, it is pretty logical to assume that previous jobs paying $15 will likely raise their wages to stay competitive."
Albany,36m0ba,RamblinSean,-1,Wed May 20 12:19:20 2015 UTC,No employer is going to increase your salary or hourly wage by 58%.

Albany,36m0ba,RamblinSean,3,Wed May 20 23:24:10 2015 UTC,"People need to make a minimum amount to survive.  If the companies aren't paying enough to cover their costs, we the taxpayers have to pay their living expenses instead.  As far as people already making $15/hour, chances are they will get pay bumps as well, in addition to having to pay less taxes because there are less people on welfare."

Small businesses that operate on already slim margins will be forced out of business. If you're okay with relying on big box stores and national chains for all of your shopping and dining needs, this is a great plan.  EDIT... To everyone downvoting me, go ask your local mom and pop retailer how they'd fare if they needed to pay high school kids, part timers, and other minimum wagers $15 an hour. Higher wages are great, but you're going to see higher unemployment as small businesses are forced to close."

Albany,36drqr,Vernacularry,4,Mon May 18 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"I saw Joe Smallbany sitting on a Washington Park bench. As usual, he had a sour look on his face. “What’s wrong, Joe?” I asked, sitting down next to him. “You’re not enjoying this beautiful spring weather?” “I just got through reading the paper,” he said. “It’s full of crime and corruption, and I’m more convinced than ever that this area is going to hell in a handbasket.”  This is one of Joe’s familiar themes. In fact, it’s what he likes to talk about most.  “You should go spend the day in Troy,” I told him. “It might cheer you up. Downtown is full of new restaurants, there are crowds of people on the streets, and...”  “Troy?!!” he said, looking aghast. “First, I was raised never to cross the river. Second, if I did go I’d probably get mugged or gunned down in an alley.  “And third, there’s nowhere to park.”  I knew from experience that there was no changing Joe’s mind once he settled on a conclusion. So I shifted the topic of conversation southward.  “I take it you’re more of an Albany guy then,” I said.  “Not really,” Joe replied. “I’ll admit that Albany is better than Schenectady, Watervliet, Cohoes and Troy. But that’s like being the tallest leprechaun on the rainbow. It’s hardly an honor.”  The sun reflected off the windows of a State Street brownstone. A couple walked by holding hands. The sound of happy children wafted over from a distant playground.  “But look at this beautiful park and all these gracious old buildings,” I said. “You don’t find this in all those ugly new Sun Belt cities, where a Taco Bell might qualify as a historic landmark. Albany can’t really be that bad.”  “Albany is the next Detroit,” Joe said. “I know that for a fact, because I heard Fred Dicker say it on the radio. And they should have put a highway through this neighborhood when they had the chance.  “Now,” he said, gesturing toward Madison Avenue, “some of the nut jobs in city government want to narrow that road and put in a bike lane. A bike lane!!”  Joe was really getting worked up. I figured I should proceed cautiously.  “Well, cities are changing,” I said. “More and more, people want to walk, bike and enjoy themselves, rather than rushing through the city on the way to somewhere else. They think cities should be designed for the people who live there, instead of commuters.”  I thought I’d made an intelligent point, but I don’t think Joe heard me.  “What’s next?” he asked. “Fields of marijuana growing at West Capitol Park? Nude sunbathing at Buckingham Pond? Why don’t they just fly the Cuban flag from City Hall?”  Joe paused for a moment, watching as a golden retriever chased a tennis ball across some nearby grass.  “When I was a kid, things were different,” he said. “Everybody shopped on North Pearl Street. You knew everybody on your block. And Corning ruled over it all with an iron fist.  “But it’s been all downhill ever since,” he continued. “Look at all the boarded-over buildings on Clinton Avenue. Look at all the vacant lots in the South End. This city is done. Hello Detroit.”  We sat in silence for a few minutes, before I got up the courage to try again.  “Things might be getting better,” I said. “Just look at downtown. There’s a convention center rising, Wellington Row is finally being rehabbed and hundreds of new apartments are under construction.”  Joe’s face turned red. I knew I’d said the wrong thing.  “Apartments!?” he yelled. “Why in the world would anyone want to live down there? Downtown is for working, and then you’re supposed to drive home and watch TV.”  “Many people don’t feel that way,” I said. “They’re tired of commuting and they want to live near stores and restaurants. There’s even a rumor going around about a grocery store opening downtown soon.”  Joe scoffed.  “Oh yeah? What’s it going to sell? Forty-ounce cans of beer and lottery tickets?

I do always call her and leash her when I see people approach.  In the wintertime, Capitol Hills golf course is 100% off leash and amazing.

So the whole year is a give and take process, so depending on when you get the system installed you may see no savings.  We had ours installed in the middle of winter and without any credits built up from National Grid, we were paying more for energy.  It's a long process.  Between them sending someone out, getting permits, and waiting on National Grid we waited several months before we got the go ahead to actually flip on the system.  Their customer support is lacking - although super friendly - and their teams do not communicate with one another very well, but they will work with you.  There's no maintenance, and SolarCity requires an active internet connection in order to monitor your system and for your to use the app to see how much you are producing/using.  Should anything go wrong with the system, SolarCity will supposedly contact you first.  I was really into Solar City in the beginning, but with a number of problems that came up during installation, I'm on the fence with them.  At the moment I am still waiting on hearing back from the company (over a month of messages and waiting for them to get back to me on an issue of roof repair).  They love to play phone tag, and while they start out with email, they quickly turn to phone calls only once a problem arises.  Since you will like not have panels completely covering your roof, the temperature difference will likely be negligible.   One other perk is that there is an energy credit you can claim up to $1000 for 5 years even through a lease.

Albany,35twpl,taliskan,2,Thu May 14 13:12:32 2015 UTC,Thank you. I didn't know you can get credit even if you're only leasing. Do you have to clear the snow/ice off the panels during winter or do you let them stay covered until it melts?
Albany,35twpl,taliskan,1 point,Thu May 14 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't either until the salesperson emailed me the information - however, they will not help you with these forms.  My system didn't get turned on until December, so I wasn't eligible for any credit this past year.  I asked them about this and they said to leave it since the light will still penetrate to the panels, and I did produce some albeit very little power when there was a foot-plus on the panels.  The snow did melt very quickly off the panels though once the sun was out.  Oh, one other bonus that the salespeople will continually tell you about is that you get a $250 referral bonus for each eligible person you refer and signs up.    If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.  I was on the phone with their support and sales for hours grilling them.  If I am signing a 20-year contract, I want to know what I am in for."
Albany,35twpl,compactawesome,1 point,Thu May 14 15:46:49 2015 UTC,The referral bonus is a perk.
Albany,35twpl,compactawesome,1 point,Sat May 16 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"After the major storms, the snow stays on the panels and there's not much that's produced.  Once the sun comes out (a day or whenever later), the panels warm up enough and the snow slides off.  It's loud, but, this is ideal for the most part--no shoveling/snowraking."
Albany,35twpl,compactawesome,2,Sat May 16 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"TL;DR:  Solar City has the best reviews because they have the best setup.  They make the process easy.  I highly recommend them.  We lease Solar City panels and they made the entire process super easy.  Their rep came out and explained everything to us, breaking down the numbers (our usage, what we pay, etc) and the process.  Then once we signed, they took care of all of the logistics like permits, inspections, and materials.  Then their extremely talented crew came out and installed our panels.  The tubing that they run the wiring through was even painted to match our house.  It doesn't need to cost you anything.  Solar City had 3 different plans when it came to leasing their panels.  We chose the plan that locked in our $/kWh for 20 years for like $1000 upfront.  One of the other plans had it increase by a percent each year.  But SC guarantees a certain number of kWh each month from the panels, and that's what you pay them for (you're really making power for them to sell back to you, usually at a lower cost than other companies).  If you make more, if goes back to the grid, giving you a bank to use later (so many little nuances here).  If you make less, SC gives a credit for what we didn't make (has never happened for us).    Our panels are supposed to offset half of what we used in the past (we have a smallish room).  Last summer, even with our air conditioners running for the majority of the day, we didn't draw from the grid.  This past winter, our electric bill pretty much stayed the same, while everyone else complained about their bills tripling.  There's a free app that lets you see how much power you make each day/week/month.  This made us a little more conscientious of our usage, which I think helped.  The panels are tapped into our internet, and we get notified if something is going on.  So far <knocking on wood>, we haven't had any issues with our panels.    Troubleshooting item:  They will not install panels if your roof isn't up to their standards.  Solar City insures their panels and the home in the event of any unexpected circumstances.  Upon discussion with my husband, we can't decide if our attic is any cooler.  A few years before the panels, we had the entire house insulated.  So there's a cubic buttload of foam insulation up there.  I think it's cooler.    Let me know if you have any other questions.  I'd be glad to answer them for you."

Albany,35tyi4,Contraflow,10,Wed May 13 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"81 is definitely the way I would go. My boyfriend and I go to VA/DC area a few times a year and it's not only a nicer drive, but less traffic. We avoid 95 like the plague, but that could just be us. Some parts in PA are a bit funky (feels like back roads when switching highways,) but as long as you have gps you should be fine."
Albany,35tyi4,whitebridgelost,4,Wed May 13 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed-- avoid NYC and NJ if you can-- 81 is a much more pleasant route, and the extra 15 minutes it takes is worth the lack of stress."

Albany,35tyi4,NetFlix_AllDay,5,Wed May 13 23:31:58 2015 UTC,I would go the google maps way 87 to 287 to 78 to 81 because 88 puts me to sleep.  And you're not allowed to sleep and drive anymore.  Thanks Cuomo.

Albany,35tyi4,maszpiwo,3,Fri May 15 03:54:19 2015 UTC,I'd have to agree with /u/whitebridgelost.  I took 87 during a trip but only because we started at midnight and drove through NYC at very early hours.  I don't drive through NYC often but I'd think that hitting it during morning rush hour-ish times would be bad.
Albany,35tyi4,ForestfortheDraois,3,Wed May 13 15:14:09 2015 UTC,NYC isn't even the worst part there. I went on a road trip to Florida a few years ago and 95 was horrible in NJ with the tolls and pretty much from there south was stop and go because of accidents and construction. Definitely regretted that decision.
Albany,35tyi4,whitebridgelost,3,Wed May 13 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"If you're going a distance and can avoid it, I say avoid the city/tri-state area as much as possible. No need to pay heavy tolls or deal with the traffic and aggressive drivers.   Take 88."
Albany,35tyi4,Beeb294,2,Wed May 13 16:32:16 2015 UTC,"Unless you want to see some cities, definitely avoid the whole Eastern coast drive if you can. You're bound to hit traffic or construction somewhere along the way. 88 to 81 is good, or you can go south on 87, then catch 84 over to 81. Both of these ways add a little extra distance to the drive but much less chance for congestion."
Albany,35tyi4,2ht,2,Wed May 13 16:57:57 2015 UTC,I drive to FL and SC a couple times each year to see family. 87 to 95 is less miles but is only worth it if you can hit the NYC-DC area at night. A lot of times I try to leave Albany at 6pm or so and find a hotel around Richmond VA around 1am.
Albany,35tyi4,Mabepossibly,2,Wed May 13 22:53:24 2015 UTC,I drive to DC every couple of months. I take 87 to GSP to NJTP/95 and regardless of time of day its really not bad. I always make excellent time.
Albany,35tyi4,uno_dos_tres,1 point,Thu May 14 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"The way the map says is fastest by quite a bit. I don't like the 88 to 81 route, because I81 in northern PA can be bad at night. Another route that splits the difference is to take I87 to I84 to I81. It is shorter than taking I88, avoids the worst part of 81 and also avoids NYC. How'd you have a great trip."

I think they still have a floor manager but the cameras are also automated.  as far as your conspiracy theory, you're way off.

Albany,357838,jeffedge,17,Thu May 7 18:04:44 2015 UTC,"I was someone's reference for a pistol permit. They essentially asked me if the person had issues with drug abuse and that was about it. It was really quick, but this will depend on the investigating officer in charge of your application. I understand that there is some form the officer must get from NYS stating that you have never been in a mental health facility or something of that nature. This form may take a few months to arrive and the officer has no control over it. This is just what I have heard, it may not be the case all the time. As far as your references, you could probably discuss that issue with the investigating officer in charge of your application.   Here is a breakdown of the process in Albany County.  Take the required pistol safety course. These are generally offered at sportsmen's clubs in the area periodically throughout the year. Internet will tell you where and when they are offered. It's a 4-5 hour class if I recall, something like that. It's really easy, basic stuff.  Go to you local police station, if you live in the city of Albany, you may need to go to the Albany Sheriff's office. You can make a phone call and check. They will give you the packet of materials you need.   Fill out the packet and get it notarized.  Submit the packet to the police department that you picked it up from.  You will call and make an appointment with an officer at the department handling your application. Go in there and give a little info about yourself. Be friendly.  Make an appointment to get your fingerprints taken. This costs ~$100. The fingerprint people will send your fingerprint scans to the police and into a database your prints go.  You will wait months and months and months.  You will receive a letter notifying you that you are scheduled to meet with a judge who would rather be doing anything else than meeting with you. You answer a few questions. You will say you want it for sporting purposes (hunting / target), and that you will purchase a gun safe for it.  You will wait a few more weeks before you get a letter to come pick up your permit at the county clerk's office. It's a crappy piece of paper that will have misspellings all over it.  Your permit will likely (almost guaranteed) to be restricted to hunting and target shooting. This is at the judge's discretion, but most judges will apply these. So don't get caught with your pistol while your at a restaurant or a bar or someplace like that. Some police will be ok with such violations of your restrictions but other's may notify the judge and you will lose your permit. It's a very strange gray area that exists in NYS. I say better safe than sorry. Now TECHNICALLY the judges don't have legal authority to put them there in the first place, so you have committed what is an ""administrative violation"". You lose your permit, but that's it. No fine or jail time. I'm sure I'll be corrected on that point but the whole scheme is really complex and annoying and just shitty.  So now you can take your permit to a gun shop, pick a gun, buy it. Take a little ticket to the clerk's office again, and apply for an amendment to your permit. What you're doing here is attaching a specific pistol to your permit. Again, you will wait a few more weeks, then get a call to come pick up your amendment. This is your ticket to go and actually walk out of the store with your pocket boom stick.  Now go forth and keep the King of England outta your face.  This isn't the exact process but it's a good approximation. Steps may be a little different depending on which police department you need to go through. Follow the packet they give you word for word. and remember- BLACK INK!!!!"
Albany,357838,APandaHunter,2,Thu May 7 19:12:36 2015 UTC,thanks man. i appreciate this. it's just such a hassle here. i miss my old state when it comes to this stuff and im impatient as fuck haha. im stuck here for at least a year and i love my apartment so...damn.
Albany,357838,APandaHunter,2,Thu May 7 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"It really does suck. I wish Vermont would invade and take over. The process is doable though. In the pistol safety class they said that less than 10% of the people there will actually go on to get their pistol permit. The process is designed to discourage people. Truthfully, the written application materials are the hardest part, once you have that done it's all good. They aren't looking to deny people the permit, the process itself weeds most people out. The police and judge won't give you any trouble, they will just be somewhat impressed you are one of the determined few.  If you are only here for 1 year, I'd say don't bother. Realistically if you don't delay at all on your end, the process will take 6-12 months, most of that time will be spent waiting for an appointment with the judge. The (un)SAFE Act created a mad rush of applications and strain on the whole system. I imagine that has abated somewhat though by now."
Albany,357838,DanTheRepoMan,1 point,Thu May 7 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"I think there are parts of the SAFE act that have merit, but the entire thing thrown together is awful. And this is coming from someone very far left on the political spectrum. I don't believe guns are the issue, I believe mental health is the issue. It's easier to buy a gun in most states than it is to get therapy, and around the same price. Unfortunately, I've worked in the legislature, and that act is not getting repealed any time soon, if ever. The guys coming in with their protest aren't gonna sway the Assembly, especially the NYC members, and the Assembly will probably not turn red in the next 50 years at least."

Albany,357838,APandaHunter,1 point,Fri May 8 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I want to help as many people through the process as possible. In a perfect world, in a perfect state, people wouldn't need such advice."
Albany,357838,LockNLoad518,5,Fri May 8 01:23:03 2015 UTC,"Have to agree with APandaHunter; he was basically spot on. The process is incredibly arduous, mostly by NYS is a May Issue state, and since no (or very few) judges or police officers feel you should have the right to have one, they are loathe to issue you a permit. From what my other friends have gone through the process most Police Agencies will drag their feet as much as they can so you just give up. Mine took 12-18 months to get issued. I disagree with TheBadTouch21 in many ways; it really depends on who your judge and ""Investigator"" are. All of my references were either Police officers, fire Chiefs, doctors or engineers. NONE were called, at all. My investigator went only from my fingerprints and my BI. HOWEVER, you should still find people that know you, and talk to them beforehand. They have both a form to fill out and a possible phone call. Go over the form with them and make sure there aren't any surprises. Make sure they understand that you may be getting an unrestricted permit (chances are 0% that will happen), and make sure they would be fully ok with you getting one. IF they have any reservations or qualms, DON'T use them. Use only people who are fully comfortable with you getting one and have no issues. If you have things in your background, talk to them about them. I got arrested a decade before I applied, and it got dropped, but I made sure my references were aware of this.   I got mine in Albany County, so it is possible. But it's very arbitrary across the county and the state. In Albany it's either Hunting/Target or unrestricted. In Central NY they issue Sportsmans Permits, which allow you to take it camping, ATVing, snowmobiling, etc. the inconsistency is insane. I know a father/son, both of whom have permits. Son got his restricted, and then got them lifted 6 months later with a simple letter. Dad had his for 30 years, no marks on his record and his judge refuses to remove the restrictions. He's now suing the judge.    DONT LIE OR OMIT anything. Even if it was a long time ago. They WILL find it, and they will use said ommitance as a mark against you.  DONT EVER SAY SELF DEFENSE. To anyone. At any time during the process. That's an automatic dismissal essentially.  Kill them with kindness. Go out of your way to be helpful. As PandaHunter said you will wait. And wait. And wait. Months. And months. And months. My application, once complete, sat at my local PD for 9 months, all bc the Officer was too lazy. In addition, unlike judges, which are legally required to act on your application in 6 months of receipt, your local PD has no such requirement. They could take 2 years and you can't say anything about it.  Black ink, LEGIBLE, and fill everything out. If you aren't sure, wait and ask your investigator how to fill it out. Mine, who was a Sergeant, actually told me to lie on mine, which I wasn't comfortable with. Thankfully it wasn't an issue, but be careful. I remind you- these people DONT want you to have a pistol, so they may do what they can to trip you up. And once they say no, that's it. You're done until you move to a different county.    Biggest piece of advice. Be patient, and try not to get frustrated. I haven't heard of anyone taking longer than me, so I feel you. Trust me. But everyone is so afraid to touch this whole issue, so everyone refuses to do anything about it. Just be diligent, nice, helpful, and keep copies of EVERYTHING."
Albany,357838,OC4815162342,2,Thu May 7 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"That process is only for pistols. Long guns are just like any other state.

NY is a may issue state so anything at all can void your application, even down to the judge just not liking the look of you. (you will be interviewed in person by both the sheriff and a judge) and you need to be fingerprinted at your cost. the only tip I can give you is: DO NOT say it is for self defense, you are a target shooter and or hunter. self defense implies you are looking to play hero and they will deny you.

For every dozen or so letters you receive, you'll get 2-3 interviews. They have to interview minimum 3 people for each position, but usually have someone in mind for a promotion, so your chances of getting a job decrease as you advance."
Albany,354g1h,Davidtgnome,2,Thu May 7 10:08:58 2015 UTC,thank you
Albany,354g1h,Davidtgnome,2,Thu May 7 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say I was exaggerating, but I took the test in 2005 for my last position, I did 4 interviews, at 4 different agencies, and was finally hired November of 2007. I took the next exam in 2008, Interviewed 3 times, and was finally hired for the promotion in July of 2013. I took the next promotional exam this past November. The scores haven't been posted, and aren't expected till the end of the summer.   Civil service has been made painstakingly difficult. Periodically SUNY and Tax will go on temp hiring sprees, usually the position is supposed to last less then 6 months, however, if you really shine at your job, and kiss the correct ass, you can edge out somewhat lower scoring people on the exams when a full time position comes around."
Albany,354g1h,Hennepin,1 point,Thu May 7 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Correct. I took a civil service exam in my field in spring of 2010 right after graduating and did not get a canvass letter until spring of 2012 (I scored an 85). Then interviewed in July of 2012 and didn't get offered the job until December of 2012. Interviews can stay valid for 6 months if they liked you but gave priority to someone else at the time.  Once you're in though, there are usually a lot of ways to move up the ladder if you are a good worker."

From what I understand the graduate level internships are very competitive compared to the undergrad level ones. Eventually its going to be all about networking. Volunteer with the local political party office, volunteer on someone’s campaign, depending on your party affiliation you might want to look into the local young republican/democrat organization. I'll warn you though due to my girlfriend being involved in political stuff some time ago I spent some time with the local Young Democrats and hated them all but I don't really care about politics so you might mesh better with an organization like that than I did."

Violence, Street fights, Robberies, all seem to spike hard and fast this time of year. The reasons are pretty obvious, but its just strange to me how punctuated it is here compared to other places.  You'd actually think that city leaders would be more cognizant of this fact and maybe skew efforts to curb violence and criminal activity so that there's more feet on the ground in the spring as opposed to, say, January/February when it's too cold to go walking around beating and shooting people.

Albany,34vrzi,SirNLeo,1 point,Tue May 5 01:40:20 2015 UTC,Tax and Finance doing stuff with databases and javascript programming. My other friends with internships for the state get 10-14.50 a hour so I was surprised to learn im making so much.

You may think that it will be a terrible job, but you'd be wrong. I did it while I was an undergrad and it was easily the greatest summer job a 20something college kid could ask for. If making ~$9 an hour is something that you can survive on then I'd say you should look into it. I recommend it to anyone that I talk to who's looking for summer job when they're in undergrad. I can't say enough for how much I loved that time of my life. I make a lot more money now, but those 4 years will always be the greatest days of my life.   Edit- you are guaranteed to get 37 hours a week, so no worries about not getting enough hours. And you have the option to buy into the retirement system, even as a seasonal employee."

If you can work off of the meager wages and not be a general failure at being a decent human being and employee you'll be fine."

The reason I bring this up, as other said LG islands get booked up fast."
Albany,34t05l,ForumLobster,2,Mon May 4 19:52:53 2015 UTC,There is some wilderness camping down Buttermilk falls Road on the east side of LG.  This is near the Buck mt. hikes.
Albany,34t05l,ForumLobster,2,Mon May 4 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"If you want to do a DEC site try Heartstone in LG. They have beach access to the lake and a trolly to the village for free if you want to walk around and shop or have a drink.  If LG is booked up try Schroon River or Lake. It's gorgeous up there. Great fishing, crystal clear water and easy access for kayaks and fishing. We use to stay on Schroon River and kayak down into the lake, it was fun. You can't beat the water up there, it's so clean and clear, I love it."

Albany,34s13o,Freepi,2,Mon May 4 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"My now wife lived there for about a year before we moved in together. They are quite nice. No pets allowed if that is important to you. Being right on Buckingham Pond is great too. If Noelle is still the property manager there, she is often very hard to get a hold of, and not the most receptive when there are issues.  Personally, I think the parking is not great there. There is not a lot of parking in front of the places, so you will probably end up posting on the street most nights. The only other real negative I can think of is there are not a lot of washers and dryers in the basements. You're best bet would be to go to a laundromat."

The maintenance crew is great and the grounds are well kept.  I only ever need after hours (emergency) work twice and it was on Holidays and they were there within an hour.    As for Noelle, I only had good dealings with her but can totally understand why people are rubbed the wrong way by her."

Albany,34s13o,melatonedeaf,0,Thu May 7 15:50:46 2015 UTC,I lived there for over a year. Quiet and well maintained. I paid for a garage spot which was handy. Also had my bike which was locked up in there stolen. The usual.
Albany,34s13o,mjdonnelly68,0,Mon May 4 21:51:35 2015 UTC,I lived there for a couple of years.  Great neighborhood.  Great apartments.  Kitchens are a little small but the bedrooms are huge.  Grounds are very well kept.  Some of the buildings trend toward the blue haired set - used to get reprimanded for closing my door too loudly.  Other than the youth shaming - I liked living there.
Albany,34s13o,stonehenge1234,0,Mon May 4 23:55:56 2015 UTC,"(throwaway so people don't know where I live)  I actually live in Stonehenge Gardens now (and have since last summer) and I've loved it so far.  The apartments are older, but generally well kept up.  I believe it actually used to be a retirement community, so that's why there are a lot of older residents.  This means it's QUIET.  I've rarely heard anything from any of my neighbors.  It also means if you tend to be a little louder, you may have issues with those same neighbors.  I haven't, but I've seen others that have.  A couple other things:   The area is very quiet and residential.  I honestly forget sometimes that I technically live in Albany.  It feels more like a suburb. There aren't too many washers/dryers (2 each per row of buildings) but I've never once had issues with doing laundry.  I usually do laundry on weekdays though so that may be why. Parking on the street can be an issue at times if you get back late at night.  I pay $30 a month for a garage spot and it is 100% worth it to not deal with outdoor parking.  Especially in the winter.  If there's an option for that, take it. Noelle is no longer working there as of the end of last year.  I haven't had any dealings with the new managers so I can't speak to that. Maintenance has been very good.  I called at 10 o'clock on a Sunday for an issue with my heater and they were there to fix it within an hour. Having heat/hot water included in the rent is great for the winter.  Don't have to worry about watching the temperature for heating.   Now for some negative stuff, which is pretty much all related to the apartments being from the 40s:   Kitchens are pretty cramped and the materials seem cheap.  Gas stoves though which is nice. No central A/C.  Plan on buying at least 1 window unit for the summer.  They install and store units for free though, which again is nice. Heaters in the winter can clang like nothing else.  It gets really annoying at night sometimes.  My temperature regulator also broke and kept the heat on full blast in the bedroom, but they fixed that the same night it happened. The bedrooms are big but the closets are pretty tiny.  I also had an issue with the shelves ripping out of the wall if I put too much weight on them.   Overall, I would definitely say the apartments are worth it.  My issues have been nothing compared to some other horror stories I've heard in the area, especially a couple places down near Lark.  Another place you could check out (owned by the same company, Tri City Rentals) is Woodlake Apts in Guilderland.  I know people that live there that are very happy as well."

There is a huge push from our local Assemblymwmbers, Pat Fahy and John McDonald, along with two prominent business owners in the area, to pass a bill that would alter state auto insurance laws to allow ride hail companies like Uber to come up to upstate cities.  Our cab service is deplorable. No one has card readers -- if they agree to let you pay with a card, they radio your information back to dispatch over the open channel that anyone with a $20 scanner could hear."
Albany,34p45w,Dovahkiin_Vokun,4,Sun May 3 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"Hope that works out. All the cab companies in the capital district are complete and total garbage.

I don't know much about politics but I would sure as hell vote yes in an instant to get Uber in this city. I strongly believe Ittl help Albany tenfold, firstly by putting those absolute and utter shit cab companies out of business. I'm tired of being picked up by a cab driver that's more hammered than I am who's smoking a joint eating a burger (that happened this Friday, called the cab company to complain and they HUNGUP on me). Not only are the prices ridiculous and random but if you actually need one you'll wait forever for them to show up at your house! When I go out I call 3 cab companies, they tell me 15 minutes each, 25 minutes there still not there so I end up hailing one down the block, I'm tired of having to work to give someone my money. In the city all I use is Uber to get around, every driver I've had has been extremely kind, even offering to allow me to plug my phone in to charge/play music! Here in Albany the cab companies are driving around in 15 year old Crown Vic's and Grand Caravans with shit all over the seats, check engine lights that are always on, and of course the lovely crackhead driver that doesn't even know where the hell they are cus their so intoxicated or on some type of drug. Point in case was this past weekend when my driver didn't know how to get to Lark Street from Pearl."

Taxi drivers are complete dicks. To the dispatcher, even the mere act of calling to request a cab is comparable to suggesting they eat their own feces. It's like you're bothering them when you're just trying to give them business. Once you're in the cab, I hope you brought lube, because you're gonna get reamed. It also seems like every driver thinks they're starring in a remake of Speed.  CDTA isn't much better, unless you enjoy sitting next to someone with BO almost as bad as the poop in their pants. I hope you're not too busy, because it takes hours to get somewhere a car could get you in 20 minutes. And I hope you like walking because it seems like the person planning the stops got drunk and threw darts at a map of the region. The bus is simply hopeless."

Check craigslist and /R/Rpi for sublets (or post there also). If that doesn't work, I would recommend emailing frats close to campus directly to see if they are renting out rooms for the summer. Past peoples ave can get sketchy IMO. Downtown (below blitman hall) is fine though more expensive.  If you want to be in albany, I can speak to the area around st. Rose. That is very safe, but not as cheap as Troy. Albany is difficult to find housing for from a different state because one street can be very safe while the next street over is sketch city.  Good luck!

Albany,34gg95,Mograne,0,Thu May 14 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly recommend looking at extended stay hotels if you're only going to be here for 10 weeks. You can usually negotiate a reasonable rate with the manager and you wouldn't have to worry about furniture, utilities, or anything else -- it's all included, of course.  That said, if you have a higher budget (I know you said cheap, but everyone has different definitions), there are some nice furnished corporate apartments (usually for longer stays, but still) in the area -- I'd recommend River's Edge in Green Island (http://www.albanyriversedge.com/execustay/) since it's close to RPI and has some pretty nice amenities.  As far as extended stay hotels go, there's a Residence Inn in East Greenbush, roughly a 15 minute drive from RPI. I stayed at a Residence Inn for a few months once and really liked it, for what it's worth. Residence Inn tends to be on the more expensive side, so you might be able to negotiate a better rate at an Extended Stay America or something similar. Other hotels might be worth a look too, if you don't really need a full kitchen."

Way less invasive than a car inspection.  I just bought my first bike a few months ago after taking the MSF course at HVCC last year.  Key points when checking out a used bike, make sure the frame is solid with no rust. If it's chain driven, makes sure that it's tight and looks pretty solid, and that the tires look pretty decent.

I know this is getting more widespread, but it's just lazy and extremely uncomfortable for me. It's going to take someone as long to watch the video as it would if it had just been a normal interview and they're not going to get to ask any follow up questions.  3) I was told they would like me to come in for a second ""interview"" and told to bring my resume that I already submitted. Basically, I don't think anything I had done to that point was even looked at by a human, and they were just inviting me to an open interview where anyone could show up no prior involvement needed. This was later confirmed.  4) Send them an email saying I had found employment and asking if they could withdraw my name from the application pool.  5) Proceed to get emails ANYWAY inviting me to more ""interviews"".

There are art openings (First Friday is this week!), community classes & events, shows for every type of music, dance parties, poetry readings... You can also peep All Over Albany, Keep Albany Boring and Nippertown for weeknight and weekend activities.   Bowling is cheap - most places have a discount night as well. There are thrift stores to comb, trivia nights (some not at bars), plays being performed. Exploring the Capitol is a nice nighttime walk. You can rent bikes on Dutch Quad (even if you don't live there.) There are community (pay-what-you-can) yoga classes at all of the local studios. There are a few good used bookstores (Mary Jane, Dove & Hudson) to peruse. You can go to the top of Corning Tower and check out the view. There are Open Mic nights at the midtown cafes, $5 movies at the Madison Theater, VHS nights (every Wednesday) at Pauly's Hotel. This is off the top of my head while horizontal & on mobile.

Albany,33pj06,Mabepossibly,2,Fri Apr 24 22:51:18 2015 UTC,TU article says they are working to corral and put them down. They are wild animals and can't be loaded onto trailers like cattle.
Albany,33pj06,thebadtouch21,0,Fri Apr 24 14:08:03 2015 UTC,"how the fuck are they wild animals if they are tagged and escaped from a farm? the bear that wandered into town for the third time is understandable, but still fucked. the american bison was JUST taken off the endangered list in 2011. now lets shoot a fucking herd of them because we are fucking lazy."
Albany,33pj06,Mabepossibly,3,Fri Apr 24 15:12:42 2015 UTC,The risk-benefit to trying to collect them is probably tipped way in the favor of harvesting them now.   The amount of highly specialized people around that you would need to safely rein in a heard of 14 buffalo is both time and cost prohibitive. From the farmers perspective it would cost too much to collect them. From the police side it would take too long to get those people in place to risk injury to the public.   These are buffalo from a buffalo meat farm. Typically they are harvested around  2 years of age. So tour no talking about an animal that would otherwise live for another 15 years on the farm.   Buffalo are wild in the context that they are not a domesticated stock. We have only had penned Buffalo farms for 50 years. Compare that to cows and horses that have been domesticated for thousands of years. You can have 5 generations of lion born in captivity. They will still be wild animals wiling to kill you.

Albany,33pj06,low_altitude_sherpa,2,Fri Apr 24 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"What nonchalance?   The farmer is looking at a loss.  He doesn't want to put them down.    How much time have you spend around bison, cause you seem to know what it would take to move them, and what the liability and how dangerous it would be to both the animal, the people doing the recovery, and the general public.  You know what it would take to keep them contained.    And before you say they animals are already in danger - I mean that tranquilizing them and lifting them onto a flat bed with... A FORK LIFT (?!?!?) could cause serious injuries to the animal so it would have to be put down anyway.    Obviously you have extensive experience with rigging and could lift the animal without injury.   You should go get them.  Sorry - I'll leave it to the experts.  You assume it was a ""bah, just shoot them.""   There is NO evidence that is the case."

Albany,33muep,flatlineskillz,5,Thu Apr 23 21:03:09 2015 UTC,This is what happens when Albany High ends classes for the day. Hundreds of students will leave the high school and start their walk to their home north of Central Ave via Ontario and Quail streets. It becomes quite the spectacle when the crowd gets rowdy and disrupts traffic and local businesses. I've seen McDonalds actually lock the doors to prevent teens from entering the establishment when the crowd becomes too unruly. It doesn't happen all the time but enough so that APD has to be there to keep the peace.

I had just gotten off the 905 after work when I saw a giant crowd in front of the McDonalds on Ontario. Within the course of 5 minutes the crowd (and the mounted police) had moved down Central and onto Quail.  It was quite the sight. Afterwards I got into a conversation with some students in the deli and they said that there was talk about a fight all day.  If the police weren't there, someone would have died. Those fighting started asking their friends if anyone had a gun of a knife on them.  Crazy shit."

Albany,33k8bm,drsfmd,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"They are thinning the trees, and removing pretty much everything that isn't pitch pine.  They have already burned out the undergrowth. This leaves no mast producing trees and no undergrowth food for the deer herd, turkey flocks, and other animals that live there currently, because they want to improve that particular space for a couple of types of uncommon birds, reptiles, and that butterfly.   If you're really interested, you should read up on the conservation overlay district that has become akin to a nightmare home owners association for people who own properties that fall within the district. Including getting the town of Colonie to re-zone hundreds of properties within the overlay to restrict what property owners could do or build and dictated the amount of ""green space"" that landowners had to provide."

You may need to just bite the bullet and get a ride to your closest Ford dealer  Locksmith will more than likely need an existing copy of your PATS key to program the new one  Wal-Marts & Most similar places won't be able to help you because their automated key cutters don't detect the PATS system and they don't carry those keys.   I had a similar problem, here's how I solved it... but it requires you having an existing copys of your PATS key...   buy a blank/uncut PATS key off Ebay bring it to Wal-mart to have it cut (for free! they only charge you for blank keys) program it using using the car's on board computer (It involves using an existing key cycling it in the ignition removing it then cycling the new key in the ignition in a certain pattern which syncs the key with your vehicle) you'll have to look up your pattern online.   Unfortunately if you don't have any existing copy's of your key with PATS the above won't work. You need it to unlock the third step. Hopefully your key turns up and then you can make a back up with the steps above. The above fix is about $20. Going to the dealer they'll probably charged $50+ for the key and another $50+ to re-program. :/"

Albany,336ugt,NetFlix_AllDay,3,Mon Apr 20 20:49:35 2015 UTC,i love how OP runs out the door after them.   What were you going to do if you caught up with them though. lol
Albany,336ugt,Quiggibub,4,Mon Apr 20 21:57:10 2015 UTC,I was gonna' give them the People's Elbow! CAN YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKIN!'

Albany,336ugt,LadyLizardWizard,4,Tue Apr 21 07:51:10 2015 UTC,Why on earth would you not lock your car?  It's literally the least you could do to deter thieves.
Albany,336ugt,capt_0bvious,3,Mon Apr 20 04:10:39 2015 UTC,"I agree but that's not my car! However, the owner was notified and taking steps to remedy the situation . I only wish I had the luxury of parking in the driveway."
Albany,336ugt,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,3,Mon Apr 20 04:14:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't targeted at you specifically, it was more like ""Why wouldn't you (any owner of a car) lock it up""  It's late and my pills are finally kicking in, which means my brain puts minimal effort in communicating."
Albany,336ugt,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,2,Mon Apr 20 04:20:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get what you meant, notice how the motion lights turn on and they still proceed to rummage thru the vehicle, initially the individual on the passenger side was deterred by the motion light but the other person continued on regardless.. even being so cautious not to slam the door to keep quiet."
Albany,336ugt,flatlineskillz,2,Mon Apr 20 04:29:53 2015 UTC,I just saw an apartment on Washington Ave where the landlord suggested that we don't lock the car because they will just break the window to get in anyway. Needless to say I found an apartment in a much better area.
Albany,336ugt,SonicPhoenix,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:53:30 2015 UTC,wouldn't it be better just to let them open the door and take that 2 dollars of quarters you have rather then them breaking the windows?

Albany,3376np,The_Spectacle,2,Mon Apr 20 05:21:58 2015 UTC,Lol well the most recent derailment was just a few cars that fell on their side. As far as all the crude oil trains and such. Can't be too mad at them for things that people allow with their reliance on oil. Preventing oil trains will just move the oil elsewhere. Instead people should be protesting oil use as a whole. Maybe that'll make some change.
Albany,3376np,orange148,2,Mon Apr 20 12:40:26 2015 UTC,Oil is some of the more docile chemicals that pass through that yard on a daily basis.

Albany,3376np,Phreakiture,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find most of the oil trains coming in from the West and bypassing Selkirk Yard entirely -- they're headed to Kenwood Yard, near the Port of Albany."
Albany,3376np,Phreakiture,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:50:16 2015 UTC,That's what I hear on the news.
Albany,3376np,Phreakiture,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I've been paying them some attention because they pass through my neighbourhood on the way there.  I've also noticed that there's usually an oil train parked on the tracks that run along I-90.  There are a number of terminals in and around the port, including one that was built just in the last few years right near the intersection of I-90 and I-787.  Of course, we need to acknowledge that a lot of the infrastructure has always been in the Port of Albany.  I also remember that there used to be a refinery down there (though it was taken out sometime in the 90's, I think).  I remember two very big, nasty fires in the Port in the 80's.  I can only hope that the efforts that they make to transport and process these materials safely have been improved and kept up."
Albany,3354mu,perceptibledesign,4,Sun Apr 19 17:18:57 2015 UTC,So... where is it?
Albany,33307s,blamdin,4,Sun Apr 19 01:04:26 2015 UTC,Cabela's would actually be pretty huge. People will travel hundreds of miles to make a trip to one - we could see a lot of out of area traffic for it.
Albany,33307s,Deynar,3,Sun Apr 19 22:29:38 2015 UTC,"I've heard Costco is pretty good.  I've never heard of Cabella's but apparently people are excited about it.  Of course people are going to complain about the location, because that always happens."
Albany,33307s,Quiggibub,2,Sun Apr 19 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Costco is a competitor to BJ's, but employee salaries are significantly better. Prices are the same.  I live near both now - I prefer BJ's for rather superficial reasons.  Cabela's is a competitor to Bass Pro Shops."
Albany,33307s,Pinwurm,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:32:26 2015 UTC,I've never been to a Cabela's store but I have heard its the go-to place for anyone who likes hunting and fishing.

Albany,33307s,Quiggibub,4,Sun Apr 19 16:08:02 2015 UTC,I guess they're supposed to treat their employees like humans.
Albany,33307s,lazyjeenius,2,Sun Apr 19 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"This.  They're best known, and popularly supported by consumers, for paying a fair wage and offering all of their employees a nice benefits package, the CEO has made wage increases against the direction of their board and won over consumer confidence, from what I've read its a great company."
Albany,33307s,GeneralTso294,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:46:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard it's actually pretty hard to get a cashier  job there since they pay so well. Not sure how true that is.
Albany,33307s,jeffersonbible,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:34:26 2015 UTC,So it's not similar to the Wegmans/Price Chopper comparison?
Albany,33307s,xueye,3,Sun Apr 19 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely more aligned towars BJ's/Sam's. They are wholesale, and you need a membership to shop there."
Albany,33307s,Minky_Momo_,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, I meant it's not better than BJ's/Sams like Wegmans is considered far superior to price chopper."
Albany,33307s,jeffersonbible,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're looking for. In practical terms there isn't a lot that Wegmans has that Price Chopper doesn't. Price Chopper uses more high-low pricing games, which makes things more expensive unless you enjoy using coupons and buying in bulk.   Costco has loss-leader rotisserie chickens and an amazing return policy, and a much wider variety of cheaper house-brand goods than BJ's does. If you have a baby and use disposable diapers and formula, Costco is the place to go. If you like to buy generics, BJ's isn't a place to save money. They are only just now realizing that maybe they should manufacture their own stuff in imitation of Costco.   Wegmans has an amazing food court and superior prepared foods, and innovates a lot more than Price Chopper does. They focused on local produce long before other grocery stores did.  If you work in retail and/or are interested in social justice issues, both Wegmans and Costco pay and treat their employees a lot better than their competitors."
Albany,33307s,Minky_Momo_,4,Fri Apr 24 00:49:23 2015 UTC,"Costco would really be a huge, huge boost; better products than BJs and the service is usually MUCH much better, and their food courts kick BJ's butt!"

According to the SLA:  Serving unlimited drinks to a patron is prohibited under the Alcoholic Beverage Control law, and instances of over serving by our licensees will be investigated and prosecuted. However, there is a limited exception in the statute when the service of alcohol is incidental to the event, such as in the case of certain brunch specials.  Even under these limited exceptions, licensees still have a legal obligation not to over serve patrons.  The SLA will continue to take a balanced regulatory approach by allowing licensees to conduct specials where alcohol is an accompaniment, while simultaneously cracking down on specials that promote excessive drinking.  Basically, bottomless brunches are considered legal but restaurants still have an obligation not to over-serve patrons and are not immune from investigation by the SLA.

Local farms and shops all set up tables and you can get everything from fresh in-season veggies and fruits, eggs, milk, meats, cheeses, breads, cakes, honey, pesto, coffee...really almost anything.  Every Saturday from 9-2. During the winter months it is indoors, but during the summer it moves outside by the water. I'm not sure of the exact date, so I'd keep an eye out for when they switch over.  http://www.troymarket.org/  edit: I would also recommend looking into a CSA. There are a lot of farms in the area that will sell weekly shares of their products. This will be my second year with Dension Farm, and I expect it to be just as amazing as last year. The only downside is that you don't get to pick what veggies you get, so occasionally you'll have to search for an appealing recipe or share with friends."

There is small market downtown during the week (I think Wednesdays) at Broadway/State. As well I think there are a few other small ""pop-up"" markets, I've seen one at Dana park, perhaps other library branches. Delmar also does their own weekend market, which might be closer for you, its at the Bethlehem Central Middle School.  I definitely second the CSA idea, but it is hard to find any that offer eggs, and they don't always give you what you want, if you like to shop for specifics."

Albany,32la76,AlbanySaratoga,16,Tue Apr 14 18:20:36 2015 UTC,The two (major) cab companies we have in this area would lose their business literally overnight if Uber came to this region. I haven't met a single person around here that doesn't hate them with a passion.

Albany,32n2db,mineiromesmo,19,Wed Apr 15 02:36:23 2015 UTC,I've drawn a crude diagram: http://i.imgur.com/rriFaxN.png  The left-most lane after turning onto Everett is a left turn only lane to go back onto route 90 (yellow circle). You should take the right-most lane on Everett if you are turning from the middle left turn lane from the exit (follow the blue arrow). The left-most left turn lane from the exit is for the middle lane on Everett (follow the red arrow).
Albany,32n2db,frickonature,2,Wed Apr 15 03:43:55 2015 UTC,I agree with this
Albany,32n2db,b1llb3rt,0,Wed Apr 15 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for the answers.  I agree that it makes a lot of sense to let the Everett's middle lane to people in the leftmost lane (because otherwise these people would have to go to a turn only lane).  However, I still think that according to the law I should enter in the middle lane (because the law says that we should enter always in the leftmost available lane -- that is, who is in the 1st leftmost lane should enter in the leftmost lane, who is in the 2nd leftmost lane should enter in the 2nd leftmost lane and so on). Of couse, the leftmost lane on Everett is a turn only lane (that is used to return to the 90). However, this information (the arrows saying that this is a turn only lane) is available only after the bridge (that is, a person that is trying to turn to the left will know this only after he/she turn to the left and enter in this lane) and, therefore, I think that a person on the leftmost lane should enter in the leftmost lane and, then, change lanes if he/she wants to go to Albany (what is difficult, since there is little space to do that after the turn).  I think that this left turn should have marks in the lane in order to avoid this problem.... while I agree with you that it makes a lot of sense to let the middle lane to people that is in the leftmost lane, I am afraid of doing that and causing an accident (and be the wrong person according to the law)."
Albany,32n2db,Learned_Response,3,Wed Apr 15 10:54:31 2015 UTC,I can't help as far as the law goes but a counterpoint would be that by going from the middle lane on the ramp to the middle lane on Everett you are changing lanes during a turn which is also illegal.
Albany,32n2db,whitoreo,0,Wed Apr 15 11:53:18 2015 UTC,"But I don't think I am changing lanes. I think that I would change lanes if I went from the middle lane on the ramp to the right lane on Everett.   Again: I think that they should have put marks in the lane in order to avoid this confusion. I agree that it makes a lot of sense to go from the middle lane to the right lane on Everett (but, as I said, I think that this is illegal)"
Albany,32n2db,BMc0828,4,Wed Apr 15 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"They should have dotted lane markers for this exit ramp. Since all traffic is blocked form moving in the direction you wish to travel, it is safe (although confusing) to enter the right most lane."
Albany,32n2db,Learned_Response,2,Wed Apr 15 13:44:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and IF they had the lane markers, that turn would be legal, but the Vehicle and Traffic Law is clear, without those markers, you can't legally make the turn into the right most lane."
Albany,32n2db,c31083,3,Wed Apr 15 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, it could be more clearly marked.   My point is that you may not think you are changing lanes but the traffic police may think that if you get into an accident. Until you find out for sure which is legally correct you have to weigh that risk against the risk that not keeping in the leftmost lane is against the law in case of an accident."
Albany,32n2db,Davidtgnome,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:03:39 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way: the middle lane of that traffic is the right-most lane that can make a left turn onto Everett Road. Thus, you turn into the right-most lane of Everett Road."
Albany,32n2db,Thesadtruthliveson,10,Wed Apr 15 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"There are 2 lanes turning left, to a roadway with 2 lanes going straight. The 3rd lane from your exit goes the wrong way, the third lane at the other side of your turn goes back the way you came.  /u/frickonature has it correct, please stop trying to force me back onto 90 east."

Albany,32n2db,UpSNYer,3,Wed Apr 15 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"That intersection is a tough one, and I agree with the ""crudely drawn"", as the poster put it, diagram that was posted.  However, you really can't trust your fellow driver to have any brains, especially if you have a family to protect in your vehicle.   They should paint a dotted white line through the intersection sort of like they do at Exit 6 on 87.  Honestly the way I deal with these problems is to use the gas pedal purposely and carefully.  I've been through there plenty of times and when I am first in line at that intersection, I stop everything that I am doing/talking and focus on the light change. This involves looking at the lights in the opposing directions and judging yellow's and reds.   Rarely have I not been the first off the line there and I accelerate sharply, not like an asshole or illegally, but I jump off the stop line as the light changes and then maintain regular/correct speed out in front while the idiots that were beside me and behind me are still looking up at the clouds, playing with their radio/cell phone, talking to other car occupants, or pondering their choices in life.   It's harsh, but that's how you handle it defensively.  The idea is that I am taking the turn with noone door to door with me, but perhaps just behind me. I then pick whatever lane I want really... as I am finishing the turn, I look over my shoulder to ensure I am clear for the lane I want.   If I am not first in line, I take the turn following the car in front (if they aren't making a mistake) and then make my lane change on Everett.   In general, too many people solve their problems on the road with the brake pedal, creating way way more danger than they can imagine by creating dangerous differences in speed between traffic already in motion and themselves, a little forward thinking and the gas pedal is all that is needed."
Albany,32n2db,whitoreo,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"You are technically correct, but in this case you are forcing people (locals familiar with the road) into the turn only lane, which they do not want."
Albany,32n2db,BMc0828,8,Wed Apr 15 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"No, that's not correct, Frickonature has it right. If the OP is in the middle lane turning left then they need to stay in their lane, which in this case would be the outside lane (right lane) as they turn. By turning into the middle lane they're not holding their lane. It is a confusing intersection, so I don't blame someone for getting it wrong the first couple of times. It doesn't feel natural when you're in the middle lane to be swinging so far out, but it is the correct driving maneuver."
Albany,32n2db,sputn1k,0,Wed Apr 15 04:40:04 2015 UTC,"From this picture: Turning left, The left most lane should enter the left most lane on Everett rd. The middle lane (when turning left) should enter the middle lane of Everett Rd. Turning right, the right most lane should obviously enter into the right most lane (toward Central avenue)  Omitted from this picture is the fact that the left most lane (turning left) is an exit lane for Everett onto 90 going west. This is confusing even for Albany residents (such as myself) if they don't travel this route frequently. Considering this, The left most lane should either enter the left lane and immediatly signal right and enter the middle lane, or enter the middle lane directly. The Middle lane of the exit ramp (in order to drive defensively) should enter the right most lane. It is a confusing intersection for sure."
Albany,32n2db,BMc0828,-2,Wed Apr 15 13:40:02 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, the RED lines represent the way I think is correct to turn left in these lanes: http://tinypic.com/r/1z6v2v6/8"
Albany,32n2db,sputn1k,-2,Wed Apr 15 02:47:36 2015 UTC,You are correct. If you are in the left most lane you are supposed to turn in the Left most lane. It's in the Driver's Manual.  NY VTL 1160(d-e) is very clear. You must take the left most lane available. The only way you wouldn't would be if they put markings on the road to direct you otherwise (sub e). There are no markings. So you must turn to the left most lane.  This whole intersection area is a problem with this. Similar issues happen all the time on the Watervliet Ave intersection turning right on to Everett.
Albany,32n2db,BMc0828,2,Wed Apr 15 12:42:49 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, the problem is that the left most lane at Everett road is not a through lane.  Traffic traveling on Everett road cannot be in this lane unless they plan on exiting Everett road.  If you want to get technical and point out the NY VTL, I'd look at this portion:  ""after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered.""  The left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving west on Everett road would be the ""middle"" lane, not the far left (turning only) lane."
Albany,32n2db,sputn1k,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:10:39 2015 UTC,Except the traffic is still moving in the northern direction until it turns left. So its still the correct lane.
Albany,32n2db,Freepi,2,Wed Apr 15 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"I said that is isn't a ""through lane"" the traffic in the far left lane is not ""through traffic"" it is traffic that is approaching the intersection and then leaving the roadway they are currently traveling on.    From wikipedia: A through lane or thru lane is a traffic lane for through traffic. At intersections, these may be indicated by arrows on the pavement pointing straight ahead.  An auxiliary lane is a lane other than a through lane, used to separate entering, exiting or turning traffic from the through traffic."
Albany,32n2db,BMc0828,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:32:43 2015 UTC,"But the VTL Doesn't say anything about through lanes or auxiliary lanes. That was my point. To use your quote from the VTL, ""in the left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered"", breaking it down:  left-hand lane lawfully available - The lane is available.  moving in such direction - As I said, it is still moving in the direction (North) until it actually turns (west) on to I-90.  upon the roadway being entered - At the Place where you turn, not 50 yards away."
Albany,32n2db,sputn1k,2,Wed Apr 15 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"Again, I see your point, but you are definitely not correct.  If traffic were to flow the way you are saying it should, during heavy traffic flow you'd end up with an entire lane of traffic that wants to continue down Everett road stuck in a turn lane.  At the same time, the far right through lane would be wide open.  When the light changes, and traffic coming from further east on Everett road gets into the intersection, it would be a mess."

Albany,32jqku,TKDRSWED,2,Tue Apr 14 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"Cost is a function of time multiplied by the hourly rate of the artist (not the shop). You can't get an accurate estimate because there are a lot of factors that affect how long something will take. If you have any last minute changes, or if you don't have a high tolerance for pain and need frequent breaks, those can make a big difference in cost."
Albany,32jqku,nomnomnombagels,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:03:20 2015 UTC,Ah so...the pricing is artist dependent? That I did not know. I've only ever been to a shop that just charged for the tattoo I was getting and not how long it was going to take.
Albany,32jqku,StefonGomez,2,Tue Apr 14 13:41:56 2015 UTC,"The same thing actually happened to me at Lark Tattoo, I understand if they don't have a definite price but at least a range would have been nice. But in the end I decided to stick with them.   I got a fist sized tattoo and was there about 3-4 hours. Had one meeting beforehand and he showed me a couple sketches and was very sweet about adjusting the size to my liking. I think it cost around $250-300. I went with Richie Van who I think may be one of the more expensive ones but definitely great. I would recommend him to anyone."
Albany,32jqku,Myspacecutie69,2,Tue Apr 14 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"Typically about $150 an hour is what you can expect, but as others have said its also based on the artist and the effort. Its not totally consistent."

Albany,32jqku,Somnambulist333,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:43:37 2015 UTC,It's 160 per hour and a 60 dollar minimum. The price is divided my the time though so if it doesn't take an hour it will be less than 160.  All of the artists charge the same rate.

There are a lot of factors but the Cabaret Law passed a few years ago need be mentioned.  It literally was like a 'Footloose' law where you had to get a license to have any kind of license to have live music or even a DJ. This is on top of liquor license and nightclub license. When venues started getting their licenses, they came with individual restrictions about ceasing music well before their closing time and kicking out 18-20 year-olds after midnight.  Way to make a college town hopping. :-P I think Waterworks and some other venues sued the city. Not sure of the outcome.   Jillian's closed amidst this. Whether it was a direct factor for them I dunno. Sneaky Pete's was dissolved by Shoprite. Valentine's was gobbled up by Albany Med expansion.  I think Bogies is still holding on? Other than that, 80s and goth nite at Fuzebox are pretty much it."

Are there not 5 bars within a block radius, what difference would a club make? or is the noise too much for you grandpa? or is it those confounded rowdy youngsters staying up too late on a weeknight? people like that are the reason lark street gets barricaded off during lark fest and tulip fest has a beer corral now."
Albany,32e66l,thebadtouch21,3,Mon Apr 13 19:38:03 2015 UTC,I live in Center Square and would love to see a club nearby provided it doesn't exclusively have douchey clientele. But then again I'm not an old person.

All of the places you listed are pub/taverns or straight up restaurants, and you can't see why they aren't reason enough for a club to be in the same neighborhood?  A club is very different and attracts a different crowd.  You go to one of the places you listed to have a few drinks, eat a burger or a horrible burrito, play trivia, listen to a local band...  Not exactly what was going on at the Armory or Buddha.  Hence the difference in number of stabbings.  You brought race into it, not me."

Albany,32e66l,zyklonbeast,5,Mon Apr 13 20:30:15 2015 UTC,15 years ago pearl street had a night club scene at the big house (think that was the name) and Jillian's. A few of the other places on pearl were more like nightclubs than bars too on Friday and Saturday night.   When I was at UA pine hills was the bar scene. Excluding the Post that was a pretty much a student club. And pearl street was the nightclub scene. Excluding the bayou and Savannah's.  Lark st wasn't super popular but it was an older bar scene.

Albany,32c46j,phantom_eight,3,Sun Apr 12 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"Never been to a Mavis... but TLDR; really pay attention to what's going on and keep your eyes and ears open at places like these.  It helps to learn about how a brake job is done even if you never ever plan to do one in your life time, YouTube is your friend here.  I had to go through hell and now know way too much about how brakes work on a car for a person who works in I.T. and just wants his car to get him from point A to point B.  It's really best to get a trusted local mechanic if your not using/covered by a dealer.  They may cost more, but they'll fix your problem vs trying to push inventory and service you don't need.  If something is not right, they'll usually go out of their way to make it right and in the long run it will cost less.     Now on to the wall of text  Most of these places are pretty scummy, just be careful and look for bait and switches and don't be afraid to hold them accountable.  About 8 years ago, fresh out of college, I had an old 95 Corolla and always had a bad experience with these types of places...especially Monroe in East Greenbush.  I'm not as young and afraid to give these places hell as I am now.  I'm pretty comfortable and knowledgeable about cars and if I wasn't in IT, I'd be fixing cars.  I didn't because my Grandfather worked for Ford most of his career and warned me to do something else.  Anyway, I had a dying Master Cylinder and walked into Monroe and told them it was shot and that I knew a replacement was about 150 bucks and I wanted them to replace it.   They called back saying my rear drum cylinders are leaking and that if they replace them, the pedal will be firm again.  I was pretty sure about the master cylinder, but I am no mechanic, so I stupidly and reluctantly said OK and of course they called back and said they did have to change the master cylinder - see what they did there? A $250 job now a $400, and I had to get them down to $400 as I said I wasn't prepared to pay $500 as I knew the master cylinder job should run about $250 and I pointed out that they diagnosed it wrong.  I should have made them eat more if not all of the rear brake job, but it gets better...  The story goes on... they didn't install the master cylinder properly and my brakes became lightly stuck ON while driving the thruway at 80mph... and again later on 9W after additional repair work. It was just enough to generate heat, but not slow the car down so it was difficult to notice until it was too late.  The story gets quite interesting with a visit with Monroe in Kingston (after I got off the thruway) who tried to screw me again by refusing to acknowledge the master cylinder problem, quoting me $500 for new front calipers. I had a stuck caliper pin on one side and a sticky one on the other, which really weren't the cause, but anything to sell more stuff.  We told them to just get them unstuck with a torch or hammer (common at dealers and local guys) and replace them with new pins and they said ""We don't do that here"".  So I nursed it home and got my local guy to do it.  This eventually culminates in a brake fire in Coxsackie that extinguished itself before burning the car to the ground.  With the front pins unstuck, those brakes grabbed a little harder when the master cylinder wouldn't release, which caused the fire. At this point, we could prove the master cylinder was incorrectly installed and now nail Monroe to the wall.  Incident reports from the Coxsackie Fire Department, a local repair shop (who is now my go to guy for non dealer/warranty work) helping me nail these guys, calls to DMV, and as well as my father and grandfather getting into the mix eventually lead to Monroe paying my tow bill to a body shop in Coxsackie, then towing my car from Coxsackie to East Greenbush, then replacing/redoing everything brake related on my car for free.   This post is way to long and the story is cut down and missing pieces... but... If it wasn't for my father, who can be an overbearing at times, and my Grandfather who's a retired ASE mechanic, and they guy who towed my car from the fire scene (I actually knew him), my now go to guy mechanic who dumpster dived his own dumpster a few days later for evidence to give to a DMV investigator, who knows how it would have turned out."

On the other hand, corporate has shown a great deal of incompetence.  That same day, I was going to come back later with my wife's car to get her some snow tires.

I could tell by driving that it was still way off.  another time I went in for an inspection, they said it would be an hour long wait and I spent the next 5 hours sitting there waiting like an idiot.  the third was when we went to get new tires for my girlfriends car as well as a state inspection, they said they had the tires I ordered, when I got there they didn't have them and sold her some cheap shitty dunlops.  then they began to inspect it, and told me it needed all new pads and rotors, I played along for about 10 minutes of the store managers BS before cluing him into the fact that I just replaced all the rotors, pads, and hardware with napa ultra premium rotors and adaptive one pads.  he was trying to get me to pay them almost 700 bucks for him to replace them with wearever brand junk from advance, so I would avoid mavis at all costs.

We were there during their opening week, and have gone back again to give them another chance. One problem I have is that they tout their product as a ""true NYC Bagel."" That's nonsense. And I don't imagine that the lady who started it has ever had bagels in the city. She moved to Albany from Idaho—not exactly a bagel-centric area.  We're in Troy all the time, and I was excited when I saw a new shop going in with ""NYC bagel"" on their sign out front. Sadly, I found their bagels to be small, bready, and hard to chew. No silkiness, no softness, no ""city"" in the bagel.   Having a ""third generation Jewish recipe"" means absolutely nothing if someone doesn't have experience, background, and understanding of the process of making real bagels. If they'd call them ""Authentic Midwest Hipster Bagels,"" then I think they'd have some truth in advertising.   From their website:   Coming into Psychedelicatessen you will see that my attention to detail approach is in everything from the bagel recipe to the decor.

Best bagels I've had are at Absolute Bagel on the UWS.  Can't be beat!  As for the Capital Region:   Uncommon Grounds are the worst of the bunch if you're looking for a NYC style bagel.  Dense round loaves of bread. I don't think Breugger's are bad if bought fresh.  For whatever reason, people I talk to tend do vehemently disagree with this, but then again, people like Uncommon Grounds bagels.  The one in downtown Troy is the original Breugger's location. Bread and Honey on Madison is the closest you're going to get to a NYC bagel.  Fresh, crusty outside and perfect inside with just the right amount of chew.  $6 for 6 on weekends, too. The everything bagel is pretty perfect.  The downside is that the store doesn't do much walk-in business and so they make bagels in tiny batches.  You have to be there at the right time to get one - or wait for the next batch to come out.  Still, it's well worth it to get them hot.  I've been in there when the next batch, 10+ minutes out, is already 'reserved' by people waiting.  They also sell at some farmers markets during the summer, I think. Also: Lox Of Bagels And Moor in Queensbury is worth a stop if you're in the area.  Bonus points for having egg bagels."

Well, if you've had good bagels then you know that fresh is a huge point with them. If you buy a bag of six, they'll go stale before you eat them. Also, I was reading on the Original Bagel site that they are frozen at the factory and then shipped. They arrive at Stewart's frozen.  So, for my money, get them frozen if you can and then thaw them or heat them up as you want to eat them. The reason I was saying you could ask for frozen at Stewart's, is to avoid getting bagels that have been frozen at the factory and then shipped to Stewart's, and then thawed, and then taken home and refrozen.  I've made homemade breads for years, and freezing is the way to keep bread fresh. Bagels and slices of bread will thaw quickly at room temperature. So, if you want a fresh one in the morning but don't want to phutz with the oven, just put one out in a ziplock bag the night before.  Thanks for the list of your experiences, I'll have to try Bread and Honey."

I'd be fine with the idea of bagels being made by some nice lady from Idaho who opened a shop in Troy. Fair enough. But she makes big claims that she doesn't back up.  Next time you're in there, ask around to the owner and the staff about their experience with making and/or eating bagels in the city. I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that one."

Albany,31vcxm,PATRIOT2121,2,Wed Apr 8 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"As someone from downstate originally, I had the same problem and have been actively looking for good pizza for the last three years. I've found two places that are close. The first is DeFazios in Troy. It is not NY style thin crust but is still excellent wood fired pizza. They also have excellent red sauce for either pizza or pasta. Just recently I've gotten pretty good NY style thin crust pizza from Andriano's in Delmar.  I still don't understand why Albany has such terrible selection of pizza considering its proximity to NYC. I've lived in several other upstate areas that are both further from NYC and only a fraction of Albany's economy/population that had outstanding pizza.  Anyway, check out Andriano's, I think you'll find it satisfactory compared to what your used to and pretty good when compared to the rest of the pizza around here."

Give them a try.  The pizza in this area seems to be more influenced by Chicago pizza—maybe from the whole canal connection. If you go that route, and understand that this area kind of does its own thing with pizza, the pizza at Kay's is good stuff. The first time I went there I wasn't completely sold, but a friend and a hardcore Kay's fan recommended asking for extra crispy. That worked for me."

Albany,31qpon,mood__ring,11,Tue Apr 7 12:39:58 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that the library is basing the contest on the TV show rather then the books.
Albany,31qpon,Thesadtruthliveson,4,Tue Apr 7 13:04:13 2015 UTC,This!   They are a damned library! They take more and more money every year and they cannot even promote literacy in the most obvious way possible?  Who are these clowns!
Albany,31qpon,Willie365,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:45:29 2015 UTC,They take more and more money every year   That money is being used to update their DVD collection
Albany,31qpon,Vernacularry,5,Tue Apr 7 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"Right now the library takes less than $3 per holdhold in the city of Albany. Besides DVDs (which are free of charge except the less than $3/year in taxes if you want to count that - way less than redbox or Netflix) , the library offers employment/resume workshops, extended learning for children, teens and adults. Who wouldn't be able to afford it if it weren't for the library. I'm not sure what your income is and frankly it's none of my business but libraries give access to things a lot of people wouldn't normally be able to get. Computer access is a big one.   So honestly, take my $3 a year APL. I think I can spare it with all the good it does and the help they give. Just because they might not be helping you as much doesn't mean they aren't helping others in your community."
Albany,31qpon,Willie365,2,Tue Apr 7 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"I am sorry mood_ring, that is simply not accurate.  According to the budget proposal released this year, the increase this year is $3.71 for the average household. This is a 1.6% increase, which means the average household pays more than $3 a year currently."
Albany,31qpon,threedice,4,Tue Apr 7 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"still though,$3.71 is not that bad. Compared to Bethlehem, Guilderland, etc."
Albany,31qpon,Willie365,3,Tue Apr 7 18:42:26 2015 UTC,I do agree they shouldn't have focused more on the tv show but it doesn't mean that libraries don't matter.
Albany,31qpon,Willie365,3,Tue Apr 7 18:48:22 2015 UTC,"They probably had to differentiate between the books and the TV show so that people wouldn't be complaining about spoilers between one format to the other, or that some characters exist in one medium that aren't in the other, or have different names in the book versus the TV series."
Albany,31qpon,Ebonystealth,-1,Tue Apr 7 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"I had a long response that I zapped before I sent it, so I will make this a quick summary.  First, I don't want to debate the libraries themselves. I know you work at my local library mood_ring, and I genuinely appreciate the job you do.   My concern with the Albany libraries has always been the way they continue to turn their focus away from what I believe should be their primary focus, promoting literacy. This trivia contest is just a symptom of the underlying problem.  I had all sorts of numbers collected in my previous post that shows the expanding cost of Guilderland and Bethlehem were less than the increase for Albany, and I may get back to that when I have more time. But there is one item in the Albany budget that I want to highlight.  As per the budget proposal currently being presented,  only $650,000 of the $9,539,059 total expenses were on reading materials. That's less than 7%! We spent nearly three times the amount we paid for books to cover  outstanding loans.  To me, this is straying too far from the primary purpose of a library."
Albany,31qpon,Willie365,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:13:28 2015 UTC,I honestly believe that at the rate they are going it would be less expensive to close all the libraries and replace them with a taxpayer paid Redbox service.

Albany,31qpon,Ebonystealth,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"You do not need to have ever read the books to watch the show. That is one of the best things about the show, it is an easy entry point for the story.  The show eliminates a lot of extra characters to streamline the story and make it easier to follow. It does things like renaming some characters to make them less confusing for audiences as well. The ages of the characters are changed to make for better television, makes the aging process less of an issue as the seasons advance. With time, some of the earlier changes have become bigger changes to allow it to fit within the new story.  I am a big fan of both. I've read the books at least three times each and have re-watched the show at least once (my wife didn't want to watch initially, then got into it, so we started from the beginning again). They are different in some ways, and each have their strengths. There are scenes in the show that never appeared in the books which are superb. The books are much more vivid and have so much more you can pull from them if you wish."

Hell, Albany has had 329 years to get one figured out, although to be honest the railroad has only been here since 1831, so that might have confused things.  But, no, can't do it.  Why?  Ask Nala Woodard, the City Clerk, the guy who licenses these felons posing as taxi drivers.  Nala says on the city website to ""please contact us at any time if you have suggestions or want to discuss any of the services or functions provided by the Office of the City Clerk.""

Albany,31ou8f,PullOverNoCardigan,2,Wed Apr 8 13:55:50 2015 UTC,"VZ is DSL only.  They likely wont even bother installing it.    TW entry package will be 34.99 for 15/1   In Albany telecom will only offer aDSL and sDSL meaning the speeds you want will be essentially unattainable without a heft payment.   TW 50/5 service is $65.  TW may have UWB downtown that can give you faster speeds but may not be on their site.  I know they have DOCSIS 3 capable gear all over the place.   Time Warner Service varies by node, however I have lived all over Albany and the suburbs and it has been stable and fast.  Their tech support is lacking but you will likely not call them often.   Albany doesn't have FTTH (fiber to the home) like FiOS in the city and never will. They are the only ones doing high speed upload."

The biggest pronlem you'll have is something you've already identified -- ""right out of undergrad"". You're going to be competing with people who are much older, have much more experience, and many have connections to high level government people. Someone right out of an undergrad experience usually isn't equipped to compete with these folks.   Edit: Of course, it all depends on how competitive a particular cohort is. I don't know how many applications they have been receiving in the past few years, but US News and World Report will have information about  the selectivity of that particular program in recent years."

I took the GRE and poorly just so they could have one on file.  You should meet with chairs and get recommendations from undergrad professors. This should be enough.   Admissions are based on your past accomplishments and desire rather than just scores.  You will need a good GPA if you have a poor GRE.  The MPA program is great and there are some fine teachers, although this is applied research focused group so they are competitive.   Feel free to PM me, I can answer some questions likely. I was last in the program in 2012."

I haven't been in others so I cant compare, but references, research, and hard work will carry you if you want in that program above any GRE.    I wasn't thrilled with the PhD program...but that had nothing to do with the research or classes.    I dont know if their esteem is justified or that the size of government and funding in NY allows them to do rather large projects particularly in system dynamics and info policy.  Having a think tank that caters to that like CTG is certainly an advantage.   They get really good adjuncts and have some great professors on staff that offer a diverse view.    I had already taken graduate level classes as an undergrad and did extremely well, also took a few un-matriculated in between, so I had the work to back up my application.

I've been looking for their Cleveland Steamer legal explanation for years.  I've only heard it once, when it aired while I was on a school bus.  My friend and I couldn't breathe because we were laughing so hard.  They had a lawyer write up, in legalese so they wouldn't get in trouble, what a Cleveland steamer was.  It took a good few minutes to read, and Larry the Cable Guy (before he was famous) just blurted out ""You're talkin' about poopin' on someone's chest!"""

The Grafton Peace Pagoda is a nice quiet place to visit. It's this big Buddhist shrine and the surrounding areas are gorgeous. No pun intended, it's probably the most peaceful place I've ever been in my entire life. http://www.graftonpeacepagoda.org/  As for restaurants, that's one of the few things Albany has in abundance. For sit-down Chinese, I'd suggest Rain on Lark St in downtown Albany or Shining Rainbow on Central Ave. If you want something fresh and tasty, check out New World Bistro on Delaware Ave. Make sure you check out Portelli's Joe and Doe if you're looking for some late night eats downtown.  On the first Friday of every month there's a monthly arts event that takes place along Lark St and the surrounding area, aptly named First Friday. http://www.1stfridayalbany.org/  On the last Friday of every month there's an event known as Troy Night Out where you'll find lots to do and you'll get a nice introduction to that area.

Albany,30yrx9,ForumLobster,2,Thu Apr 2 06:24:57 2015 UTC,"La fiesta in Clifton Park is not bad for a family place that has ok food.  Aside from what has been suggested, I beg for people to not bring their children to nice adult restaurants and bars. These are adult places where adults go to get away from kids and have to pay a sitter.   If you do decide to go to an adult place with children, I hope you don't expect anyone to censor their conversations or act any differently.  It is inconsiderate to inconvenience everyone else paying good money for an adult night out, when you bring your children along.   However if you want a nice adult and children friendly restaurant with fun food, Athos Greek has all the right chairs and accommodates well, and I have seen many families with small children at Sushi Tei in Guildreland."
Albany,30yrx9,TweakedNipple,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:08:12 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the suggestions.   However I think there are a few simple things restaurants can do if they want to keep families with children away. One, don't stock highchairs. Much like World of Beer in Crossgates Mall if a place doesn't have highchairs I won't bring my children. Two, don't have ""kids"" cups. I really don't like spilling large quantities of milk in someone else's nice establishment. Don't have a children's menu, stock crayons in the host desk, or fill the place with games. Even Dave and Busters (which obviously caters to children) has an extensive bar, so we don't go late or on weekends when adults can over indulge and behave inappropriately.   I don't expect people to act different around my children, I expect people to behave with a sense of responsibility. I don't mean avoiding the occasional F-bomb, or even lowering the volume of their voice in a bar when the game is on. That's all normal. But if you spill someone's drink accidentally, apologize maybe even offer to buy them another one. Throwing up in public, driving while intoxicated, demeaning women, fighting, etc all these things are inappropriate. I don't like them when I go out without the children. If you want go to Hooters, you won't see children there."
Albany,30yrx9,plausible-rationale,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:06:46 2015 UTC,"I really just mean upscale intimate places. I wouldn't set foot in the  type of places you mentioned if you paid me. I really was talking about small upscale places.  However you want to take my comments is fine, but if your kids are really not picky and you want to support a neat little local business with a creative menu that has children sized portions and accommodations try Dave's Burgers on Fuller road. He is an interesting character that fled persecution to try to make it.  He makes an amazing burger (has veggie and black bean if you are vegetarian) and is low key to boot.  He also has felafel and some other neat things.  However if you really want to introduce your kids to something like felafel and hummus, Saya at Mamoud's makes some of the finest.   On a side-note I used to work near Hooters, and people bring kids there all the time which is a bit odd since the food is probably not good for anyone, and it is a sick sexist joke of a place."
Albany,30yb8b,MousetheFooDog,5,Tue Mar 31 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"We just got a natural gas furnace put in yesterday. We went with Mohawk heating after getting a quote from Crissafulli because they were almost $1k cheaper. We were able to get the 95% efficient one for the same price Crissafulli quoted us for an 80% efficient. It was about $3200 installed. Our house is around 2,000 sq ft."
Albany,30yb8b,pgm0313,3,Tue Mar 31 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you, super helpful!"
Albany,30yb8b,daedalusesq,2,Tue Mar 31 23:05:30 2015 UTC,I'm actually also interested in this knowledge. My furnace is a boiler for a radiator system from 1980...after my heat bills this winter I'd like to get a higher efficiency one.
Albany,30yb8b,furrygatita,2,Tue Mar 31 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"Paid $6500 with new Lenox Furnace and installation. Crisafulli Brothers. They were professional, fast, and the best price for the type of furnace we got."
Albany,30yb8b,furrygatita,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:23:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! Do you happen to have the breakdown of labor and parts handy?
Albany,30yb8b,hailhalehail,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:06:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have the exact breakdown in front of me (at work), but I think the furnace (with high end HIPPA Filter) was about 4500. This estimate is very high though because we also had a new air conditioner installed included in the price. They give you a very good breakdown estimate though so I would give them a call and have them give you a free consultation."
Albany,30yb8b,Freepi,2,Tue Mar 31 21:00:28 2015 UTC,Had Crisafulli do ours three years ago.  95% efficient Trane forced air unit - was right around $3800 installed if I recall correctly.   House size is 2300 sq. ft.  They didn't really break down parts vs. labor in the final bill.
Albany,30xnbs,DannyBoy7783,2,Tue Mar 31 15:23:49 2015 UTC,Yes.  Yes it was.  And now it seems to have gone away.  It wouldn't surprise me if it was someone in the water since things still look frozen in spots.

Albany,30x6et,NetFlix_AllDay,6,Wed Apr 1 00:25:06 2015 UTC,"I worked for Stewart's Shops about 6 years ago. Not sure if it's the same in all stores, but the few that I would work in in Rensselaer County treated their workers like garbage. On numerous occasions they would switch people hours around without notifying them. I walked in one time and they said ""why are you here?"" I said I am working today, they said ""no, we just changed the schedule around, your not in till tomorrow"". So I took the initiative to take a picture of the schedule every week and I would call my manager out on it if he or anyone else would change the schedule. Then I was fired for using my cell phone to call the police after my store had been robbed of gas, I was able to get the license plate number. They brought me into the back of the store after 2 weeks and said you did a great job reporting the robbery, but since you were seen on your personal phone in front of cameras and customers, they had to let me go.  I know I'm not the only one with a bad Stewart's story around here."

Manager got caught stealing. I thought this was insane because I was the one that brought it to the attention of our district manager. Anyway I scheduled a mini-court kinda thing, saying I was unjustly fired and they had to pay me unemployment for a year and a half. Jokes on them because I had already told my boss I was putting in my two weeks, he just hadn't made it official yet. They fired him too and he had 3 kids. For no reason. Awful, terrible company."
Albany,30x6et,Occamsrazor1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:08:34 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, maybe they thought since the assistant manager was steal, maybe everyone else was too? But that of course wouldn't explain you going to the DM and telling him. At least you were able to get unemployment out of it."
Albany,30x6et,irondevil518,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the biggest thing I learned about Gamestop while working there was just how easy it was to recycle employees. I mean if you think about it, anyone can work there, even if you know nothing about video games. Sure, it's great when you can interact with fellow gamers, but 95% of my customers were buying shit for their kids. Gamestop just needs someone to stand behind a register and annoy the shit out of people with preorders."

I haven't played video games in a long time too, so not much of a reason to go to a GameStop. I've seen that Stewart's has a high turn over rate as well. I have heard about a bunch of instances where if another employee doesn't like you for whatever reason and calls corporate about you, they will find a reason to get rid of you. Most of the things people say are false or made up as well. The managers in the shops practice Nepotism hardcore as well."

Albany,30x6et,b1llb3rt,5,Tue Mar 31 15:44:34 2015 UTC,They left out the part about standing in line being the majority of your time in the store. I avoid my hometown stewarts and many others just because they're always understaffed.

Your mention of GetGo reminds me of the parallels of Giant Eagle and Price Chopper. The unnecessary overpricing, the inconsistent quality of stores, the fuel rewards, the keeping Wegmans out of an area while looking the other way elsewhere, the making a Wegnans ripoff elsewhere..."

Albany,30ungx,-HUSH-,0,Sun Apr 26 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"20% of time doing things like ""rolling silverware"" is their case? Also, it's a class action lawsuit firm. They might have some legitimate gripes but this just smells."
Albany,30ungx,SOABOUTLASTNIGHT,7,Mon Mar 30 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are focused on a rather specific detail and looking at it in a bad light.  First, ""like rolling silverware"" is just one example and could very well be an example provided by the TU in their article. (Although other articles also list it but also provide a much longer list of activities - http://www.cnycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=1184154#.VRnW95-sxhF) Also, 20% is absolutely significant as it's the threshold at which the wage requirement goes from a reduced minimum wage to the full minimum wage under the FLSA. It's also 20% within a single day - if one wage employee winds up spending more than 20% of his/her time on a lot of un-tipped activities within a single day, he or she must be paid full minimum wage for those hours.  Imagine you're a closing shift waiter who has to roll your own napkins. With only 6 tables, a 1 hour turnover, and 1 minute of time to roll those napkins for each table, you're looking at almost 45 minutes of un-tipped time during the first 7 hours of your shift. Then you spend the last hour of your shift cleaning the bathrooms and taking out trash. That's more than 20% of your time doing un-tipped work. For that time, you only made $3.40 instead of $11.60.  It's not difficult for tipped employees to cross that 20% threshold when they are assigned other un-tipped tasks. I suspect that the numbers in my example are generous for Dinosaur, having been there many times watching employees run around like crazy and seeing food can come out 20 minutes from the time it's ordered.  Second, the suit also alleges ""Dinosaur did not pay time-and-a-half for employees working past 40 hours a week"" and ""did not provide required extra pay to employees who worked more than 10 hours in a day"". Time-and-a-half regulations are pretty straight-forward, well understood, and widely know. If either of those two violations are provable then it would not be far-fetched to believe Dinosaur would also require tipped employees to spend excessive time on un-tipped activities without paying them adequately."
Albany,30ungx,doctaweeks,2,Mon Mar 30 23:29:10 2015 UTC,"There is often downtime where these tasks are common, if they are using it as an excuse to pay people next to nothing..different story."

My tacoma just barely fit. I could only get in a little ways. Nice little mud hole in there. I talked to the neighbor and he has seen people use it but he thought a 4 wheeling club owned it or something. I can't really find anything online. Someone at my college told me about it."

I'm told that during the summer they also run a farm where you can volunteer outside planting and harvesting."
Albany,30s5mq,88_mph,3,Mon Mar 30 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"(Probably the only time I'll appreciate being one-upped, well played.)  I was told that the stuff that comes in falls into one of two categories:  items that the store can't sell due to some minor imperfection, or items that have been sold but later returned.  Damaged items are things like:  * Loose cans of soda which probably came free from 6-packs or 12 packs.   Gallon jugs of water that have been dented but are still sealed. Boxes of Ritz or similar crackers which have been smooshed.  Blankets that were returned or had stains.    Opened or slightly damaged makeup. Several times we've gotten an entire pallet of Ahh Bras. Once we got to sort bags of oranges that had one or two moldy oranges in them -- we'd open the bag and remove the moldy oranges, dust off the outside of the good oranges, and re-package them.     Returned items are more fun, because the employee at the Walmart service desk writes out a slip explaining why the item was returned.  As we're going through the items we get to see that people returned Axe body spray because it ""smelled too bad"", or that the clearly used mop ""didn't work"".  All of this stuff gets categorized and then distributed to a bunch of local/regional food banks who handle distributing the items to those who need them.  Go and check it out!"

Albany,30kfhh,Nicod27,17,Sat Mar 28 03:34:39 2015 UTC,Be a big boy and own your mistake. Pay the fine and put it behind you.
Albany,30kfhh,drsfmd,3,Sat Mar 28 11:05:08 2015 UTC,"This is not only good life advice but also the best solution.  I had a problem with ezpass where I tried doing the right thing with a rental car and I put it on my account like they said. I returned on a Sunday, and since the call center was closed I thought ""oh well, I took the tag out so that's fine."" Nope! Ezpass billed me for every trip that car took across the NYC bridges until I caught the mistake... Because the plate was on my account. Ended up being a few hundred bucks. I argued, and they just sent me to collections. Do not pass Go.  In the end I had to swallow that bill. It perma-locked my account, so I had to jump through all sorts of hoops just to put my car back on a new account.   OP, you may have to suck it up and pay for your mistake."
Albany,30kfhh,SixQuidSquid,1 point,Sat Mar 28 11:41:10 2015 UTC,I did not quite understand what you did. They billed you for someone else's trips because you forgot to unregister the car from your account?
Albany,30kfhh,babedul,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:04:53 2015 UTC,Correct.
Albany,30kfhh,SixQuidSquid,-1,Sat Mar 28 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"It's not a fine, they suspended my account. I would rather just pay a fine."
Albany,30kfhh,drsfmd,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:42:08 2015 UTC,Ok. What do you have to do to get your account un-suspended? My advice remains the same...
Albany,30kfhh,Quiggibub,-2,Sat Mar 28 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"That's what I am asking.....  EDIT: There is no fine, it's just suspended for a set of time."
Albany,30kfhh,melatonedeaf,3,Sat Mar 28 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"You might have to just serve the suspension and use cash for 30 or 60 days, depending on how pissed they are.  Sure, it's inconvenient, but I'm sure you'll be fine."
Albany,30kfhh,melatonedeaf,2,Sat Mar 28 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"There should be an option on the letter they sent you explaining a written appeal. If not google it. Don't try to call them.  I have successfully appealed them. It took three letters and many months. Eventually I got the outcome I wanted.  They are aware their equipment sucks, but would rather fine everyone just in case.  Your first mistake is admitting to going too fast. Stop doing that. Was their equipment faulty? Why is this not your fault?   If you accidentally sped through a school zone you still get a ticket, just a thought."
Albany,30kfhh,ColonThe_Barbarian,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"What did you say exactly? What was your excuse/reasoning?   EDIT: And they didn't fine me, they suspended my account because another idiot family member got a warning, but that was before the new year."
Albany,30kfhh,ColonThe_Barbarian,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:41:19 2015 UTC,"My situation was different than yours so my previous solution won't work for you.  If I was you however, I would remove the family member that committed the previous offense. I would then appeal to them saying you believe that speed isn't correct as you are extremely safety conscious and a careful driver.  You should also point out that other person is no longer on your account. That was an oversight on your part which should not cause you to loose privileges in their system.   You are willing to pay a reasonable fine and move forward being a trustworthy user of their system.   They might deny the appeal with a reason if you are lucky so you will appeal again addressing that specific reason. Keep appealing till you reach an outcome you can accept."
Albany,30kfhh,ColonThe_Barbarian,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"What was your reasoning though? I am just curious. PM me if you don't want to writ eit on here, but please tell me.  Removing the person from the account is not an option."
Albany,30kfhh,mimulus_monkey,2,Sat Mar 28 15:11:13 2015 UTC,This happened to a friend of mine. He shares a family account and they have had their account suspended for a month a few times because the mother refuses to slow down through the tolls. You just suck it up and live without the easy pass for a month. Afterwards you drive responsibly through the tolls.
Albany,30kfhh,babedul,-3,Sat Mar 28 15:15:05 2015 UTC,"That's not really an answer to my question. Sucking it up is a last resort. And it is for 60 days, not 30."
Albany,30kfhh,mdj,3,Sat Mar 28 15:17:48 2015 UTC,If you want to know if there is an appeal process contact them and ask. if this was your first offense you may be able to apologize and see if they will waive the suspension. If you have been warned in the past and this isnt your first offence then you may just be up shit creek. I know they send at least 1 warning letter as my wife got one.
Albany,30kfhh,NetFlix_AllDay,-2,Sat Mar 28 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one was sent, but that was for last year (December). There is an appeal process, but I am asking as to what people have said as their reasoning to get it reversed?"
Albany,30kfhh,babedul,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't know of anyone that successfully made an appeal."
Albany,30kfhh,NetFlix_AllDay,7,Sat Mar 28 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"They don't suspend on the first violation. I know this because I got a warning about it once.  I was first annoyed about it and then I thought about the fact that toll collectors have to walk across those lanes to get to their job and was like ""I fucked up"""
Albany,30kfhh,lilianminx,1 point,Sat Mar 28 11:55:01 2015 UTC,"Before they started doing this, a friend of mine did this experiment where he wanted to find out if their system will fail at high speeds, as in not charge you toll. So he kept increasing his speed by 5 mph every time. He chickened out when he still got charged at 55."
Albany,30kfhh,gjallard,2,Sat Mar 28 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who used to work for the company that developed the technology. He said they'd tested it up to 140. If you travel down to NYC, the lanes split at the Harriman barrier and you can go through at 65, no problem."

Albany,30ielk,lfdc,-1,Tue Apr 21 17:35:27 2015 UTC,I can't believe nobody has said this but Coccadots on Central in Albany is AMAZING! I recently moved to Florida and last year I organized a surprise birthday party for my wife back home and I communicated via email with Coccadot's and requested a blending of my wife's Coach bag addiction and eyeglasses. I sent two pictures to them (one of a a coach bag she loved and a pair of eye glasses that she owned and loved). The people there went ABOVE and BEYOND for me with the design of the cake. Having given them NO direction on what to design they did a fantastic job! The price point was right (~$50) and the service was exceptional. They encountered a slight snag on the pickup time for me and the girl that runs the shop drove to their cooler location and got the cake herself and drove it to me since I was waiting there. I'm sorry but that is ABOVE and BEYOND what I would EVER expect any business to do for a customer. They will be pricier than most places but the end product you cannot beat. These guys know their stuff. Please use Coccadot's and share the end result. You will not regret it.

Whoever does their advertising should be fired for producing such a shitty advertisement.  If what they say in the press release is remotely true then the ad wouldn't be the way it was unless they have a shitty designer. Sounds like backpedalling mixed with incompetence.
Albany,30dqh3,_pi,3,Thu Mar 26 15:55:15 2015 UTC,Yea they should definitely be fired for drawing all this attention to the company... Why would they make an ad that does that?
Albany,30dqh3,_pi,-1,Thu Mar 26 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"It's negative attention. If they really wanted that kind of attention maybe they should have done something really racist or sexist as an ""ad"" then called it a joke."

Albany,30dqh3,_pi,-2,Thu Mar 26 19:07:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's bullshit. If you're a multinational or a gigantic national chain with millions of daily customers, prices that don't commit large swaths of savings and you've most likely driven the competition out of town there's no such thing as a bad press because people have very little other places to go to.   For a small business there's definitely such a thing as bad press. 20-50k deals go sour all the time for small things, you're effectively putting those small things up front and making sure that people who may have an issue with them never give you the chance to make a sale.  There are plenty of people who would walk out of a showroom (even if they had cash in hand) for not having a sales rep touch base within 10 minutes of entry, why do you think that this kind of bullshit would attract more people to a show room than the people it repels? I don't think that the ""I like and give money to businesses that offend people to spite the 'PC' people"" crowd has very deep pockets to keep such a bougie kitchen remodeling business afloat.  Nobody chooses their kitchen remodelers based on their ability to crack stupid jokes in their ads."

Albany,30dqh3,thebadtouch21,-1,Thu Mar 26 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"I think the response makes that billboard more offensive. If their market is mostly women, why did they put up an advertisement directed at (presumably) straight men? Is it because they think that men are the main financial decision makers?    sense of humor, a sense of history and healthy self-esteem   I highly doubt anyone really finds this billboard funny. A sense of history? History of women cooking in the kitchen for their husband when he comes home or history of women having to fight for suffrage, rights for body autonomy, and workplace equivalence? Self-esteem... I don't know why this had to be interjected in the response, since the protesters had the self-esteem to stand up for what they think is right. Why would someone with healthy self-esteem be swayed to purchase a kitchen based on an offensive billboard?

Albany,302s1k,mrlint,13,Tue Mar 24 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"I approve of the idea behind the plan, opening Albany to Internet services beyond Time Warner. However, the idea fails to acknowledge the monopoly Time Warner has is sanctioned by a franchise agreement with the City of Albany. An agreement that was renewed as recently as 2011 and will continue until 2021.  Further, the idea for the board as described already exists, and is completely invisible with its addressing of these problems.   http://ecode360.com/14981770  End the franchise agreement and allow FiOS to come into the area to compete for customers and watch the problems with Time Warner disappear."
Albany,302s1k,Willie365,3,Tue Mar 24 12:29:53 2015 UTC,Except that Verizon has specifically stated that they don't plan on expanding FiOS to any new areas and instead want to partner with Time Warner to do bundled cable & cell plans
Albany,302s1k,lorimar,0,Tue Mar 24 20:42:51 2015 UTC,"After 20+ years of Time Warner having a franchise, and no end in site, that is the smart move.    The cost to run fiber is not recovered in a few weeks, it takes years. If   Verizon were told today that the Time Warner franchise agreement would not be renewed, they would still have to wait until 2021 to get started. If it takes three years to get through the regulatory nonsense,  a year to roll out, and five years to recover the investment, you'd be talking 2030 before they could start to earn a profit in Albany. Would you make that a priority?  In all honesty, by 2030 the service that is FiOS today won't be running. They might as well wait for their next generation product. With the recent re-definition of broadband by the FCC, you'd have to purchase the second to highest TW package (Extreme) to qualify as broadband. The lowest tier of FiOS service qualifies with the new definition. If the goal of the franchise agreement was to bring broadband to every household in Albany, and the majority of residents do not have the Extreme tier, then the plan failed.  I am not against building an infrastructure that allows fiber to every home in Albany. Whether Albany builds it or gives away money in tax breaks and regulatory fees for Verizon to build it, makes little difference in the end. But the idea ignores the reality, most of the idea already exists and has been taking advantage of the residents of Albany for quite some time."

Albany,302s1k,pogue23,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:01:29 2015 UTC,I was under the impression all these muni fiber plans used existing but unused fiber infrastructure.
Albany,302s1k,thebadtouch21,0,Tue Mar 24 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"If there was a dark fiber loop around the city that just sat there I would maybe think this was a good idea.  Otherwise this is a terrible idea.  These municipal fiber projects only work in places that were either completely undeserved or had extensive external funding.   If you build it, you will need to support it.  You will need to sell it, and most people will not want it separate from TV.   I am not one of those, but I know the market. Muni will not get the TV contracts and offering it stand alone and making people buy TW TV will make  it a hard sell. Since in every other market TW jacks up unbundled TV price. There is a reason FiOS is so big on marketing TV.  Most people dont care, know, or care to know the difference between 20/5. 20/1, or 100mbit symmetrical. They just want something that will stream netflix, porn, and open up facebook. TW does this fine.   It would have to be very cheap and very fast, something that is difficult to do. Muni fiber in places like Utah has been sold to private companies to manage because it was too costly to operate.   Albany technically has competition. TW, DSL, and LTE from all 4 major providers.    I love fast internet speeds and cool tech, but this is unrealistic.  Businesses in Albany that would need fast enterprise level service have plenty of choice since there is ton and tons of fiber in our area as we are a major US PoP.    Also we will never have FiOS in the city since they are not doing any more new roll-outs anywhere period and were only cherry picking neighborhood to begin with.  Enjoy Albany's virtually unmonitored and uncapped TW RR service until they get bough by comcast or put caps on downloads. Believe it or not, we have it pretty good compared to most of the country. Our shitty service is considered great in a comcast market."
Albany,302s1k,ForumLobster,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:08:32 2015 UTC,DSL and celluar service in no way compare to the throughput available via fiber. But yes its 'technically' competition. But not at equivalent service levels.
Albany,302s1k,ForumLobster,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"No they are not.  However to an ISP last mile delivery is very costly so they will sell people on this idea.  LTE CAT4 which is what we have is basically capable of providing speeds around 20/20mbit (assuming adequate back-haul) on average if you count a 10X10mhz average for deployment. Even on 5x5, you can QoS the hell out of it.   I hate to admit it, but like it is true.  99% of consumers just want to watch movies on demand, porn, and light web browsing.  There is no need for high speed fiber or cable. RR offers 100mbit and nobody buys it.    Good news is there are apps coming (non gaming)  that will be latency dependent.  Once everyone is in the cloud for storage and computing, low latency will be the new drive.  Wireless is the future and they can get it down to under 40ms to the server.   I would love fiber, but I am an engineer that does this for a living.  I abuse my internet line and my phone's LTE.  Most people do not."
Albany,302s1k,BlooregardQKazoo,0,Tue Mar 24 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"Also we will never have FiOS in the city since they are not doing any more new roll-outs anywhere period    i heard this for years and then last year FiOS rolled into my neighborhood in Colonie. they're clearly still expanding, just slowly."
Albany,302s1k,ForumLobster,3,Tue Mar 24 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"That was the completion of the Colonie rollout. I said no new expansion, this is by the way what the official line from Verizon is as well.  Colonie was included in the Albany MSA rollout.   Dont get me wrong, I would love FiOS where I live, but I will never see it. FTTH is just not been very good in terms of ROI short term and VZ shareholders want it short term."
Albany,302s1k,BlooregardQKazoo,0,Tue Mar 24 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"you might very well be right, but 10 years ago we were told that Colonie was never going to be continued. i'd probably assume you're right but hope for the best."
Albany,302s1k,ForumLobster,2,Tue Mar 24 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"They have to honor their commitments, but unfortunately  not going to be rolling anything new. They are also ripping copper little by little.   They want to sell you wireless. The own the spectrum and can do almost what they like with it.  No natural monopoly, no oversight.

Albany,302s1k,cybermage,5,Tue Mar 24 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"My understanding of net neutrality is that any legal content cannot be blocked, degraded, or slowed. So it's not a big deal unless you are worried the city will outlaw porn and e-commerce."

Albany,302s1k,cybermage,2,Tue Mar 24 13:19:24 2015 UTC,Right but local laws in violation of federal laws are invalid or at least can be sued out of enforcement.
Albany,302s1k,Hard_boiled_Badger,2,Tue Mar 24 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"First you'd have to prove that they're even doing it. Who's going to publicly step forward and ask why they cannot download porn anymore?  Anyway, my point is that giving the government the ability to censor will result in censorship. You might have to sue to get it removed, but they can implement it and make you fight to remove it. If a local government asked a privately run ISP to censor the Internet, the local government would end up having to convince a judge to side with them before it gets implemented.  I'm as big a fan as the next guy of the idea of ubiquitous cheap broadband, but not if the reins are given to local government, which, by the way, includes local law enforcement."
Albany,302s1k,daedalusesq,-1,Tue Mar 24 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"Outlaw porn, block access to sites with content deemed as hate speech, more easily monitor browsing data."
Albany,302s1k,Hard_boiled_Badger,2,Tue Mar 24 13:04:21 2015 UTC,And then they get sued under the net neutrality rules because the law is in violation of the FCC.  Or do I not understand the FCC ruling?
Albany,302s1k,Mabepossibly,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:27:07 2015 UTC,Im more concerned about what is considered legal content and what isn't.
Albany,302s1k,thebadtouch21,0,Tue Mar 24 15:57:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. I don't know why some people have the expectation that turning the Internet into a public utility will not lead to its regulation and filtering.    FCC is a prime example. The FCC was created to simply organize radio wave frequencies and keep people from bleeding into other people's feeds. It very quickly grew into a content regulating agency.

Albany,302hdw,fackjoley,2,Mon Mar 23 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"I'm betting that some local city dwelling hipster idiot was lost on a back road one day and saw this persons farm. Stopped because he/she saw the farm animals and thought, ohh geez those animals should be inside in this cold weather, blah blah blah. They then went running back to the police, who really don't know how to interpret the agriculture and markets laws here in New York, which in turn sent them up to the farm which then had him cited. It's all bullshit in my opinion. I know tons of farmers all over this area because I like meat that comes from local farms, and I've seen how they raise their animals. They are all taken care of just like this guy is doing."
Albany,302hdw,irondevil518,3,Tue Mar 24 11:20:17 2015 UTC,"That is probably the most reasonable explanation as to why... what really burns my ass about this is they are coming after this guy for frozen water but its industry standard practice to keep a chicken in a cage for its entire life and cut it beak off so it won't kill the chicken next to her. but god forbid a pig has frostbite on its ear cuz it was outside, they need to be locked in a cage where our food belongs lol"
Albany,302hdw,thebadtouch21,5,Tue Mar 24 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. It's ridiculous that the government is going after this small farmer for letting his animals roam free, without cages. Yeah the water might have been frozen at the particular moment that the law enforcement officer was there, but it was an insanely cold winter this year, and the farmer can't be everywhere at once, that water could have frozen over in less than 10 minutes. I also don't get why they aren't paying attention to the reports from the veterinarian!"
Albany,302hdw,irondevil518,-2,Tue Mar 24 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"Bc if you read the vets actual affidavit, she didn't get to check all of the animals bc they couldn't be handled. Also, it's not like there was just a little ice, the cops affidavits say it was frozen solid mixed with manure.   A cold winter doesn't mean it's ok for livestock to not have access to clean water. This is basic animal husbandry."
Albany,302hdw,cmaxby,-2,Wed Mar 25 01:56:40 2015 UTC,That actually isn't what's going on in this case at all. The horses that were removed needed serious farrier care. They're being cared for at Peaceful Acres and treatment overseen by a local equine vet.

It's a long haul but we'd have been at JFK for 4 or 5 extra hours with the car service since their schedules are so inflexible and our flight was around the same time as yours.   Also it's cheaper this way than the car service or driving and parking, if I remember correctly."
Albany,301sdc,thebootlegsaint,2,Tue Mar 24 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this is what we are leaning toward. It's to the Jamaica station, right?"
Albany,301sdc,cybermage,2,Mon Mar 23 20:24:14 2015 UTC,Yup!  It's not that hard to follow but be careful and leave yourself some leeway on the way back if need be.  We missed our subway train at Jamaica Station on the way back and got lucky at Penn Station as were the last ones on the train back to Albany.  We would have been stranded in NYC for an extra 2 hours if we were another minute late.
Albany,301sdc,Mabepossibly,3,Mon Mar 23 20:26:30 2015 UTC,Luckily we are flying back into Albany. We just got a dirt cheap JetBlue fare (less than $100) one way. The same flight from Albany was like $228.

Take the Airtrain and LIRR. ~20$ depends on peak hours etc.  From the station, if you want something comfortable (especially if you have luggage), take the train. It makes life easier. If you don't care for comfortability, there are a few bus companies to take. Greyhound, 'Chinese' bus, and Megabus. They are all fairly cheap. Just a little cramped."

Probably the closest clubs, Forbes and Watervliet, have a weird relationship with each other.  They share an access road and each club owns different parts of the land; Forbes is more of a high-power club (they have the 1000 yard range and a pistol range with a pavillion), and Watervliet has the rest of the facilities (skeet/trap, the pistol range, archery range, the IPSC course, and the indoor range).  Coxsackie Sportsmen's Club is a bit of a farther drive (S of Albany) but they may have an opening.  Iroquois Rod & Gun's website seems to be down, but I can give you their contact info if you like - they're W of Albany on the Thruway at exit 25A.  Guan Ho Ha Fish & Game is W of Albany in Schenectady County.  Brunswick Sportsman's Club is N of Albany in Rensselaer County.  Troy Pistol League is in North Troy, but they're strictly a pistol club with a 50' indoor range, but they're also OK with smallbore rifles on their range as long as you don't use jacketed bullets."

How the hell am I supposed to practice if I can only use a range after a 20 year membership process once I've prayed to the firearm gods while wearing my ritual coon skin cap that's been blessed by John Browning, spilled the blood of a virgin over a copper bowl, and gotten the written approval of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, at which time I'm limited to firing one shot per week out of a ruger 10/22 that the club found in the woods behind a meth lab 20 years ago that they have deemed ""safe"" for use on their prestigious mansion grounds?  When I was in Florida, I drove to the range, signed in, shot all fucking day for $10, and left, without having to suck the owners dick and beg him to let me into his super secret club.   Why the hell must New York be such a shitbag of a state to gun owners, ESPECIALLY to OTHER GUN OWNERS. Aren't we on the same side here? Have we not determined that practice is pretty much a good thing? Why must we limit it to so few people?"

Albany,2zuphl,jeffedge,2,Sat Mar 21 23:19:07 2015 UTC,Welcome to the city!  Albany is motorcycle friendly.  There are lots of guys that do the Lark street thing and ride there to have beers and talk shop. I have seen people hang out at the Dunkin Donuts there on warm summer nights.  If you are into getting out of the city for longer 3-4 hr rides there are countless great roads (and trails) southwest of the area.
Albany,2zuphl,melatonedeaf,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:58:30 2015 UTC,oh cool. i'll definitely head there and check it out. i'd love to get in touch with some builders around the town so i can get some help doing some aftermarket stuff too.

Albany,2zpu2i,WalterPecky,2,Sun Mar 22 14:33:19 2015 UTC,I think at the very least they need to have the discussion. This ordinance would form a volunteer committee to explore the costs and feasibility associated with the various options. My suspicion is the initial cost would be astronomical ($100 million+ for the build) but if done correctly this could become self sustaining and possibly even a revenue generator for the city.

The closest you'll get to EDM/hip-hop would be Stout on Broadway, it's a large bar with a dance floor and a DJ. Fuze Box is the sketchiest bar I've ever been to, I say bar because it is definitely not a ""night-club"". At Fuze Box you'll pay a $10 cover to hear a local DJ play the beatport top 10 all night. The worst part about Fuze Box is that it's ALWAYS dead. Last time I went I decided to give it one last shot, 98 people confirmed as going on facebook, me and my 5 friends arrive, pay $10 each... The only other people were the bartenders, a 50 year old guy with a trench coat and a laser pointer (this guys always there though.. I think he's badass), and like 2 other people. After 10 minutes we left. If you head up north a little bit you have Saratoga, Caroline street is worth checking out as they have the City Tavern which has a dance floor that plays edm/pop, also checkout the reserve which im assuming will play some EDM as they used to under their old name ""the paddock lounge"", they just changed the name because of the bad rep a bad gets after letting someone get murdered inside their bar. Hope this helped!:)"

Albany,2zpcpu,kaileemonster,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Legends on Pearl has/had the potential to be a nightclub, however, their DJ's are terrible, and mostly... Their drink prices are absolutely fucking insane. $9 for a WELL rum and coke? I'll take my business elsewhere, they promote ""never a cover"" like crazy, well, instead of a cover they charge insane drinks prices for no reason! Plus I've never even been to an Albany bar (besides fuze box) that actually had a cover on a normal night (excluding New Years, st. Pats, etc). Mostly Legends is also always dead, at least every time I've been there."
Albany,2zpcpu,msndlp,4,Sat Mar 21 00:22:21 2015 UTC,"Fuze box is pretty awesome as long as you go on the right night. Tonight happens to be their industrial night, or ""goth night"". Its actually a lot of fun. The people who go are really cool and nice, and sometimes people even bring food. The music's pretty good, and a good amount of people go. I really enjoy fuze box.   But I do see where other other people are coming from. I went to an edm show there once because my brothers friend was playing. Some of the DJs were really good. But others were just awful. One guy didn't realize that playing his shitty music at the loudest possible volume wouldn't make it any less shitty. It just made it worse.   But goth night it a pretty awesome time to go to fuze box. :)"

There's no zoos, no aquarium, all the big nice lakes are 30m-1hr away, camping is that far, there's so little actual things to do IN Albany outside of what I listed in the first paragraph.  The roads in Albany and Colonie are absolutely horrid and almost none of them were repaired last spring/summer. Every time I drive in Albany I feel like I'm putting thousands of miles on a cars suspension.  When I was in high school in Albany all there was to do in Albany is smoke cannabis because nobody knew anything really enjoyable or fun to do under 21.

Albany,2ziga9,Athole,11,Wed Mar 18 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"This is gonna depend on what you and your date are into. Romance is an emotional state brought on by a situation. And while the setting can help, it's really up to the couple. I could also ask about whether this is a first or second date or just a special event for a long term thing.   But here's a neat list from a guy who likes dates.   -Guptills arena in Latham for skating and ice cream. A great first or second date. A fun activity while still being able to talk to your SO and get to know them better.   -NYS museum. Want something a little quieter than a skating rink? The museum. A great cheap date while still providing topics of conversation literally ALL around you.   -River st in Troy. A nice variety of places to go eat and some actually nifty scenery as long as you stick to the NICER areas of downtown troy.   -Spin Jam. Once the weather gets warmer and the fire spinners come out this can be a real fun late night date. music provided by the bongo banging hippies and a pyrotechnics show for free.   -Wine tastings. I know there are a variety of places that do this. These are fun second/third dates. And the light buzz that comes with a tasting can be a great ""social lubricant"".   -Walk through the park on a nice day is good and there are riverside parks in most the three cities. But you REALLY need to be a good conversationalist to pull those off successfully.   -Theatre. There are shows at Proctors, the Linda, and the Russel Sage College (for the three cities respectively). take a look for one playing you like and take your SO.  -Lark street. Not the bars though. Try Ben & Jerry's or Coffee, then the park/museum. The area has a lot of character too. Just avoid the shit spots where you can get beaten up.   -Depending on the day/time of year, I know a few of the ice rinks have free ice skate days. Might be some little shit kids around, but not a bad bet sometimes.   There's also the 1000+ fancy pants restaurants around the area. But the best dates are usually the ones where something spontaneous and interesting can happen. And fancy dinner dates will usually just be boring."

The most fascinating thing to me is that it even survived the American revolution and lasted up until the civil war. This is fascinating but not surprising, since the Dutch New Yorkers were instrumental in starting and influencing the revolution, so it makes sense that the new government would allow the Dutch community to continue this system as thanks for their help even though it was antithetical to revolutionary ideals.  Kill is an old Dutch word for a body of water like a stream. But it's not used anymore in modern Dutch so we also find it strange. My favorite Kills are Fresh Kill and Great Kills in Staten Island, and the Murder Kill in Delaware (I think), which is a kill where someone was murdered."
Albany,2zep3x,mittens4kittens,3,Wed Mar 18 00:34:18 2015 UTC,There is the town of Fishkill that was sued for its name supposedly after the slaughter of fish. The case was thrown out very quickly.
Albany,2zep3x,EndlessIke,3,Wed Mar 18 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"Though I still wonder why they would name it Fishkill, given that all kills contain fish."

Albany,2zep3x,frickonature,4,Thu Mar 19 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think most people in the area are at least somewhat aware of our Dutch heritage. We learned about Henry Hudson and New Netherlands in school when I was a kid. I had some friends who sailed on the Half Moon reproduction from Albany to New York City. Which is on it's way to the Netherlands right now actually, since Albany was too cheap to continue to pay for it's up keep.  The Dutch influence can been seen in many of the place names around Albany too. Obviously places like Rensselaer and Kinderhook are Dutch in origin, but also less obvious things like how many of our creeks are called kills (e.g. the Normans Kill) are leftovers of the Dutch period.  Although the most visible reminder of our dutch history is probably the annual tulip festival. Which admittedly is mostly an excuse to get day drunk and listen to moderately popular bands. But, there are also a metric fuck-ton of tulips to look at and girls in traditional dutch outfits vying for the title of tulip queen.  And since you mentioned the Patroonship system in another post. I just wanted to let you know that we used to have a semi-pro basketball team named the Albany Patroons.  Oh and in case you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend The Island at the Center of the World which is a brief history of New Netherlands based off of the original records from the colony. It's probably not as in depth as what you're used to, but it was a really enjoyable book."

Central Mass is more English with some French, Native American, Irish, and Italian in recent heritage.  There's barely any Dutch roots, so it seems a bit obvious to me around here, as it's a bit unfamiliar.  For my question, how would you pronounce some of the towns in the area? I struggle sometimes with Watervliet (Watervaleet? Watervlee ay? Watervlee? Watervleet?) and my husband laughs at me.  How about Stuyvesant, Rensselaer, or Van Schaick?    I'd also love to hear how the locals pronounce things.  I'd rather not take my husband's word on pronunciation; he still calls it Worchester."
Albany,2zep3x,ForestfortheDraois,5,Wed Mar 18 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm...

In the evening Willem  Tomassen, whose legs were swollen from the march, had a few  cuts made with a knife therein, and after that had them rubbed  with bear grease.

Albany,2za4gr,jayjaywalker3,5,Mon Mar 16 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"Let's do away with the ""custom"" of tipping for all restaurant services altogether. Pay these wait staff a decent hourly wage. Owners can raise prices to make up the difference, and consumers wouldn't feel the pinch, as the overall cost of the meal is the same."
Albany,2za4gr,drsfmd,3,Mon Mar 16 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"Except a lot of people don't tip, and there are several hours in the day where wait staff aren't serving customers. A lot of people eat lunch around noon and dinner around sundown. Between those times, restaurants count on paying sub-minimum wages for the staff to clean and stand around. Eliminating a tip wages would bring these employees up from $2.50/hr to $8.00/hr. Shifting that difference into the food prices probably isn't possible.   I agree with what you're saying in principle, but in practice I feel it would implode many small businesses if it wasn't rolled out slowly."
Albany,2za4gr,cybermage,5,Tue Mar 17 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the south had a rough time without slaves. If your business model depends on seriously underpaying your employees, your business model sucks."
Albany,2za4gr,millej,2,Tue Mar 17 04:07:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not unsympathetic to your sentiment, but here are some points to consider:   the median total compensation for a waiter/waitress is $8.94/hr, which is above the minimum wage.  it is very easy to under-report tips, making the median artificially low. The average, in fact, is $10.04 these are work arrangements entered into voluntarily, typically by unskilled and/or college age people, so it is in no way literal slavery. The compensation is typically below average, but it's also, typically, a first job, not a career. It is also a job uniquely suited to work around the employees other demands (after school for students, during school hours for parents)"
Albany,2za4gr,cybermage,3,Tue Mar 17 07:35:43 2015 UTC,Comparing median to minimum doesn't say much. I would be more interested in a comparison between median total compensation in waitstaff and other unskilled positions.
Albany,2za4gr,embolalia,0,Tue Mar 17 12:08:51 2015 UTC,Lets not. I work part time in the service industry. I make like 150 bucks in like 7 hours.
Albany,2za4gr,capt_0bvious,2,Wed Mar 18 10:55:34 2015 UTC,"I think a better solution would be that restaurants must ensure that their staff's hourly wage meets or exceeds the regular minimum wage, with a minimum employer contribution of 50% of the regular minimum wage.   This solution guarantees a higher compensation for waiters/waitresses, while still incentivizing good service."
Albany,2za4gr,cybermage,2,Tue Mar 17 07:49:04 2015 UTC,"With the exception of the words ""or exceeds"" everything you said up until the comma in your statement is the law.  Your wait staff has to make minimum wage.  You can pay them squat (apparently $2.50) but at the end of the night, they have to bring home enough in tips to add up to minimum wage for the hours worked.  There's some strange rules about short shifts and overly long shifts but that's the basic rule."

They are like $50 cheaper than the competition, so I was skeptical.    They were on-time and very fast.   Most movers you buy in block hours, typically minimally 4.  They try to sometimes stretch time to make a little extra money.  Just two guys moved my whole 2 bedroom apartment in about 4 hours.  They put down rubber mats and everything like you are supposed to.   Maybeys is fine too, but in my experience had been more expensive.  I have heard good and bad things about every moving company.  I think a lot of it depends on how well packed and ready you are for them.   Good luck."

It is in Clifton Park which is a hop on the Northway or route 9 and up about 10-15 miles.   A color with cut is $80. A color without cut would be $65. The lady I had was a master cutter.

The Colonie town park or over near Forts Ferry is probably your closest access, depending on where you're at on Troy-Schenectady.  It's paved, very active, and great for running and biking. If you'd like somewhere a little more 'off-road' then Peebles Island in Cohoes/Waterford is a great route once the snow melts.

Albany,2yzhfs,Super_Frez,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"If you're around the City of Albany on Tuesday evenings at 7:00 theres a hatha vinyasa class at The center for Nia and Yoga at the corner of Lark and Central ave. Its $15. Its not a crowded location so you have some stretching room. Its not hot yoga, and its more on the beginner side. Since most of the clients of the Yogi are also friends and they are all just learning, the Yogi is very helpful and patient. If you're looking to do headstands and fancy advanced poses, this is not the class to take, but if you're more a beginner and enjoy some space, its a nice class. It seems like most of the time, the people that go are not looking to ""workout"" or get their booty in shape. These clients seem to care more about inner peace. If thats what your looking for, I'm sure the Yogi would be very happy to see some newcomers."

After the crazy fridge-out-a-window and car-flipping a few years back, I think the colleges rearranged the schedules so this is a spring break weekend. With fewer college kids around and the possibility of drunken stupidity, maybe bigger bars just aren't opening that early anymore?   All just speculation.

Stuff your face with bass never had a problem, it was an outside show that was hopelessly disorganized that caused the first problem a few years ago.   Any electronic show there are very strict security checks making sure no illicit substances or weapons are brought into the show. Obviously they didn't extend this practice to the rap show or they would have found knives on people.   I understand the hate against allowing people under 18 into shows because they are the idiots getting too wasted before and taking too many drugs. There are just not enough paying patrons in the area to afford to have a profitable show without allowing the kiddies in. In my opinion this means we should not be having the shows at all."

The ladies always recognized me and gave me really strong drinks at the bar. I don't want to reveal who I am but peepthis is SYFWB and I can assure you that they are not scumbags. They pretty much had to stop throwing shows because people kept taking advantage of their hard work (like vivid). Peepthis worked their butt off to throw the best show they could with no budget and no profits. Anyone who knows anything about sound and production can clearly see that any show not run by peepthis has no idea what they're doing.

Everything was fine.   The problem I see with the events that get out of hand is either the lack of security or the utter lack of maturity from the underage crowd.

Albany,2yolg0,WordWriterGuy,2,Thu Mar 12 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"I'll check it out to see what establishments and if they may be new. The corral policy wasn't fixed and documented but the crackdown for this year was publicized immidiately proceding last years St. Patricks shenanigans and corraling was indicated. Pearlpalooza/Larkfest/oktobeirfest were lucky to not be more strictly regulated. I believe they get around OC law because the streets are blocked off making it an ""enclosed area"". Tulipfest is an open park and so they had to create a beer corral (started by jennings). For The parade streets are just shut down, not blocked off and so like Tulipfest corrals were proposed to adhere to the OC regs. Not enforcing OC prior to this year was law enforcement looking the other way."

The Guilderland one is nice too, brand new and recently remodeled. They have a pool, sauna, and rockwall. I think their $30/month membership gives you access to all of it. I prefer Latham because I feel like I can get a better workout there. Haven't been to Albany Strength, I've heard good things but you have to be pretty independent and no your way around the weight room."

I just pay the 10$ a month and don't see any recurring charges, and i think the enrollment fee wasn't that bad.  If I could go anywhere else I definitely would, but its the only 24 hour gym around my work.  The best time to go is between 11pm-4am if you go outside that time its usually packed.  The place is usually dirty with papertowels, waterbottles and weights everywhere."
Albany,2yn4fb,holbermr,0,Wed Mar 11 08:17:43 2015 UTC,there is an annually recurring fee.... but every gym has it
Albany,2yn4fb,capt_0bvious,2,Wed Mar 11 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"As far as fees, especially enrollment fees, don't be afraid to negotiate.  Call up the local gyms ask what their monthly rates are, enrollment fees, yearly fees, ect. If the one you like is more expenisve than other locations, negotiate.  If a gym isn't willing to match their competitors for a reasonabl amount, then they might not be worth going to."
Albany,2yn4fb,Super_Frez,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"I go to Planet Fitness as well, but I've been wanting to upgrade in the recent months. Planet Fitness is good for what it is as long as you don't run into those people who treat it as an advanced gym. I've recently started going to the Glenmont PF, which is better than some of the others in the area, in my opinion. But if you want serious lifting I would try Albany Strength, they have a one time fee for a year membership, which in the long run is cheaper than the $20 from PF.  Also, I know the head trainer at the Vent in Latham, he is the best trainer in the area hands down. If you do end up choosing Vent, ask for Will Barry, you won't be disappointed."
Albany,2yn4fb,irondevil518,1 point,Wed Mar 11 10:44:08 2015 UTC,planet fitness is probably one of the best ones in terms of fees and cancellations. Other ones require you to send in your first born in order to cancel.
Albany,2yn4fb,capt_0bvious,2,Wed Mar 11 13:29:57 2015 UTC,"My experience with Planet fitness has been the opposite. Cancelling Vent was much easier. They had me fill an online form asking just random things about my experiences and why I was canceling. Once they got my form, they e-mailed me the date my cancellation would be effective, and the last time they would charge.   As for planet fitness I couldn't do it over the phone, I had to do it in person, but I had to go back to the gym I originally registered with. It was a pain, I lived 40mins from my original location. When I tried explaining that, they said I still had to come in because I didn't live far enough away to send in a letter. Very frustrating and time consuming."

If a gym is far I simply will lose the motivation to keep up my routine. Having PF less than 5 min from my house makes it worth while. Even during peak time, there are plenty of treadmills and free weights.  I pay the $15 so that I am not in a contract. I run in the summer and can lift at home.  Mostly need a place to do both when it is cold."

Albany,2ylmus,Jedthedog,5,Wed Mar 11 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"Its actually not maintained. The US trustfund for highway improvement is so low that roads that are deemed ""unfixable"" like 85 are ignored. Only absolutely critical things like bridges are to be worked on. So it will probably be the same until it actually must be redone. Shame, because it really needs to be done."
Albany,2ylmus,dropkinn,7,Wed Mar 11 04:51:08 2015 UTC,I believe that the bad part of 85 (from 90 to the Bethlehem town line) is going to be redone either this summer or the next.  I recall reading this in the 'Getting There' blog on the TU.  My vote for worst road in Albany:  got to be Zoar Ave between Central and Lincoln.  Completely unfucking-driveable.
Albany,2ylmus,hailhalehail,4,Wed Mar 11 12:45:32 2015 UTC,"Is this the getting there you're referencing?  If so, the newest updates make it seem like it's much further out.  DOT had public comment on an overhaul project but I don't see anything about it on their site."
Albany,2ylmus,morphis568,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"got to be Zoar Ave between Central and Lincoln   That one is bad in part because it receives far more traffic than it's designed for... there are so few ways to get from Washington to Central in that section of town that the residential streets that cut through get heavily trafficked. Think about it... between Manning Blvd and Fuller Rd. -- a distance of something like 2.5 miles, there are only TWO streets that go through from Washington to Central-- Colvin and Zoar (which feeds a couple of sidestreets)!"
Albany,2ylmus,drsfmd,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and Colvin is actually in not horrible shape for this time of the year.  I-90 does cut a portion of the city off from itself, once it crosses over Central (that along with the RR tracks).  Looking at the map, it seems like it could be possible to link Washington via Railroad Ave to Central with a cunning redesign of Exit 3  - then again, the resulting road would pass through that huge brownfield at the foot of Railroad and opposite Osborne.  So, maybe not..."

However, I have also been able to move things in and out multiple times with no issues by simply planning my move around the work day and traffic.  If you can get time off from work (assuming you have a 9-5 job), there is parking everywhere during business hours because of the permit system. Even if you don't have a permit yet, you can park to drop things off for up to 2 hours at a time.  As for double parking, it depends on the time of day. During business hours and especially during rush hour, this is a huge dick move and people will let you know about it. On nights and weekends, after traffic thins out, it's not an issue at all."

Albany,2yc560,Giblet15,8,Sun Mar 8 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"I'll do it for $500, but I have no idea what I'm doing.  Edit: What about calcium chloride?"
Albany,2yc560,bretstar,4,Sun Mar 8 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"You're going to be looking in the $200-300 range, unfortunately. If they do it properly, they'll have a steamer. Otherwise, they'll whack it with hammers which has the potential for damage. If it helps you, think about a basic rate of $50/hr per person, and they're going to have 2-4 guys doing it for 2-4 hours. It's cold outside work, requiring going on a slippery roof with a ladder. And it's not like they don't have plenty of work offers.  Three things to consider: First, ask if they are willing to install a heating wire. They're available at Lowe's, Home Depot, etc. and you can get about a 35' roofline (about 100-120' of wire) for $100 which will prevent this problem in the future. Second, take a close look at how much water has come in. There can be damage you don't know about - check for soft drywall in the walls and ceiling, look carefully at floors. We had water come in and we thought it was limited to a couple of spots on the first floor ceiling, until the hardwood floor above one of those spots sprung up and revealed that the entire paper liner below the floor was wet and mildewed. Fortunately, homeowner's insurance can cover that - check your deductible and if you're willing to pay it, the repairs are probably more expensive than that. Third, you can get a home energy audit for free, and they can tell you if you need more insulation or other ways to avoid this problem in the future."
Albany,2yc560,buddhafig,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:29:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. It's not my house so I will have to talk to my landlord about if they want the heating wire installed.   The landlord is out of the county for the rest of the month so for a decrease in rent for the month I'm assisting in finding someone to do the removal.  Ultimately they will pay whatever is needed but I just felt 300 an hour seemed like a lot.
Albany,2yc560,buddhafig,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:44:21 2015 UTC,"Installation is only temporary - it's basically a wire and clips that attach to the shingles. But a good landlord would want to be sure it's properly done, following all of the guidelines like a switch with a light, dedicated connection, etc.  It's great that you're trying to save your landlord a buck, but if it's not your money you shouldn't stress it too much. If you're only getting reimbursed the cost of the dam removal and not getting paid for your time to find anything cheaper, you've done a ""good enough"" search, especially since you want this to happen before there's more water damage."
Albany,2yc560,hansn484,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think once that are back we will be putting in some more permanent precautions to prevent this type of thing in the future. Reevaluate the insulation in the crawl space, increase ventilation, etc.   I have someone coming by tomorrow morning to give me an estimate / break the dam. The landlord also one day shipped some ice melt pucks which will be here Tuesday to help ensure we don't have another problem this season.   Landlord will be taking a decent amount off rent and doing some extra improvements around the house as compensation for my time. The arrangement has so far been mutually beneficial."
Albany,2yc560,faildata,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:18:04 2015 UTC,I've read mixed reviews about heating wire. Some websites say they solve the problem - others say they are a last resort.

Keep in mind these don't work literally overnight, depending on the severity of your issues you may still need someone to come do the work, but it may help in the meantime.   Edit: My stepfather just explained they used to use calcium chloride for walkways and put it in women's pantyhose tied off on each end, tossed on the roof. Maybe useful if you can't find the pucks."

Schenectady was perhaps the worst affected, as none of the immigrants would accept the persistent job offers from GE, forcing the GE plant to close due to their inability to staff it.

Albany,2y5ouw,54CymruBeats,13,Fri Mar 6 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"I had a friend that had great success with Labor Ready.  Basically they have a start time. You show up ready and they do a quick interview to make certain you're OK to work and they send people out to do what needs to be done.  This might be ideal for you in your current situation for a few reasons. First, as long as you show up without being intoxicated there's a good chance you'll get something each day. This means you can start bringing in some money tomorrow. This can go a long way to showing the people you owe money to that you are making an effort to pay them, perhaps convincing them to offer you a little extra time.  Second, I know how hard the feeling of rejection can be for people struggling with anxiety and depression. Typically the tasks you'll be assigned will allow you to work alone, so you don't have to struggle with interacting with other people all the time. As long as you're not intoxicated, the chances are you'll get selected to a job. A surprising number of people who wait in line cannot follow this basic rule and the herd tends to thin out quickly. This can really help avoiding the fear of rejection that can come with interviewing for a longer term position.  And lastly, if your anxiety and depression really get the better of you and you cannot work on a particular day, you don't have to show up looking for work. Obviously the more you go out the easier it will be to get longer term work, but if you struggle initially you aren't burning any bridges.  Hope you get things under control and are able to improve your situation."

Albany,2y1qks,lbsubstylee,6,Thu Mar 5 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"Monday night is garbage/recycling night in that area of Albany. Honestly, I would just take them and put them in someone's recycling bin after it's been put out to the curb."
Albany,2y1qks,mickeythesquid,4,Thu Mar 5 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"They're great for washing glass and packing fragile objects.  Maybe bind them back up and dump them on metroland's front steps.  Or better yet, leave 'em right on Steve Leon's doorstep."
Albany,2y1qks,Christian_Kong,2,Thu Mar 5 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"Does your job or house(this is semi legal) get municipal garbage take away? The recycle truck takes paper and will likely take a bundle. I believe you can take it directly to a recycling facility but the albanyny.gov isnt working at the moment. Trees are a renewable resource and the paper industry thrives on that fact, so you should not feel too bad if you just had to dispose of it with the normal trash."
Albany,2y1qks,Christian_Kong,2,Thu Mar 5 18:54:53 2015 UTC,We have County Waste but I have never seen a recycling receptacle.
Albany,2y1qks,Quiggibub,2,Thu Mar 5 19:27:33 2015 UTC,CW is a pay for service(as is expected of businesses and certain residential areas that dont have municipal) so I think if they aren't paying for recycling you wont get it. You can always call them to make sure. Here is CW's recycling truck schedule you need to supply your own recycle bin though.

I'm at a loss to understand how a blockage UNDER THE STREET is supposed to be the responsibility of the homeowners. The media is playing up the story by trying to generate pity for this woman with cancer, and I think that's the wrong tact... it's either the homeowners problem (sorry if you can't afford it... that doesn't make it everyone else's problem) or it's the city's problem (in which case, I don't want to hear that it's a resource issue-- people pay for the service and you're obligated to live up to your obligations!)."
Albany,2y0p15,greentangent,2,Thu Mar 5 13:31:30 2015 UTC,"The administration, which isn't disputing that the problem is under the public roadway, maintains it wouldn't have happened if the homeowners had let their faucets drip, although the McIntyres insist they did just that.   So, run water all night and get charged for it?  This is as bad as my town water.  After asking people to use less water they used the decrease in usage as a reason for an increase in cost."

Albany,2y0p15,jeconti,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:26:49 2015 UTC,"Even when the break or problem is under the street? It takes the city to close the street or sidewalk if the pavement or sidewalks need to be pulled up to facilitate a repair. I can't hire a plumber who is going to show up at my house with a jackhammer or heavy equipment and go tearing into city streets. Are we going to make sidewalk, curb and street replacements the responsibility of the homeowners as well?"
Albany,2y0p15,Vernacularry,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"Ive had a few friends(and friends of friends as well as my neighbor) pay $4000ish for pipe repair for shit under the sidewalk. Typically the job involves a jackhammer and a mini crane. I think you have to pay for the new sidewalk block as well. I assume there is fees/permits and such to go with this so you can tear up the street. I can only assume if there is a problem under the roads the city takes care of it but obviously I wouldn't hear anyone with stories about it cause they aren't directly paying for it.   Are we going to make sidewalk, curb and street replacements the responsibility of the homeowners as well?    Funny enough I(only owning for 3 years) assumed that was the situation(because of the water pipe obligation) and was worried as some of my sidewalks are showing cracks. I later only found out the city still covers sidewalk replacement a few weeks back while telling my worries to someone."
Albany,2y0p15,timmy6591,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. They are. I have clay pipes running to the street. Almost everyone in the neighborhood has paid to have them replaced. If it's a problem on the street it falls to the city/town. If it's once the line services your home and just your home, it's you problem to fix. They have contractors that specialize in those kinds of repairs. City and towns keep a list of reccomended contractors for that reason."
Albany,2y0p15,Phreakiture,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:18:20 2015 UTC,"That's different than what's happening here though. If the news story is correct, the blockage is out under the street, well beyond the shutoff valve. The city is saying that they are only responsible for the main, not the branches."

They have different internet backhauls but for my 15/1 service I've never seen a measurable difference in bandwidth but TW has IPv6."

I had Internet from them because the friend I took over the lease from had it, and then I added TWC cable, so I had separate bills.  The biggest problem I had was that when I called tech support, if I called Earthlink it turned out to be an issue with the wires and they would transfer me to Time Warner, and if I called Time Warner over what I thought was an issue with them, they would transfer me to Earthlink. Often I'd get disconnected during the transfer, of course, and then I would call the company I was being transferred to. Sometimes then they would transfer me back to the company I had called in the first place.   I didn't have problems very often, though."

While Lighthouse is very new and does still have a limited user base, if you created your project on lighthouse and then posted to /r/lighthouseprojects and /r/bitcoin you might have a decent shot at getting it funded. The bright side is that creating a project only takes minutes at most, so if it doesn't work, no harm no foul. If you do give it a try, I'd start with something small.

As it stands now, it's totally borked.  That servers need to rely on customer generosity to make ends meet is nuts.  Tips should go to the makers as much as the deliverers."

Albany,2x4jsi,kaihau,2,Wed Feb 25 21:55:33 2015 UTC,And you still get paid minimum wage in full if you don't make minimum wage in tips that day. $7.50/hr + tips is insulting to other workers in the food industry who do comparable jobs and only make $8.75/hr.  The only reason you'd ever have to complain is if nobody was coming to the resturaunt because the owners suck and aren't able to keep a resturaunt likable enough for people to come in.

As a server: Whatever increase in hourly pay I might expect from the raise, I might see taken away in taxes and tips, with the line of thinking ""you guys don't make minimum wage any more, I'll tip 12%""  This is all to increase payroll tax revenue for the state and its hidden under the guise of worker's rights."
Albany,2x4jsi,vitalityy,7,Thu Feb 26 19:49:37 2015 UTC,I highly doubt people will start cutting their tips by 40% because of this
Albany,2x4jsi,Christmas_Pirate,5,Wed Feb 25 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"I will, I hate tipping and the idea of tipping. You get extra money for being nice or attentive? That's part of the job, any job really. I wish the food was just 20% more expensive or whatever so I didn't have to tip and let the state have their cut. They get their cut of my salary. Why isn't it customary to tip customer service or Walmart workers? Do I tip the guy who does my taxes for doing them well? H and R block would have me think so."
Albany,2x4jsi,vitalityy,6,Wed Feb 25 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"I agree tipping is stupid, I also realize 7.50 is still garbage and servers still rely on tips.  I'm not a douche that takes out my displeasure with the industry standard by fucking over servers"
Albany,2x4jsi,Christmas_Pirate,-1,Wed Feb 25 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"And yet, I bet you have never once thought about tipping the Walmart employee who is only making $1.25 more an hour which is still shit and doesn't have benefits because they are part-time. I don't mean to insult you personally, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of the culture and how service is somehow different from other minimum wage jobs. Do you tip the people at McDonalds? I don't :I"

Albany,2x4jsi,volci,4,Wed Feb 25 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"$7.50 is actually below minimum wage ($8.75).  It does, however, represent a significant spike in the minimum for tipped workers, which may indeed lead to some layoffs.   I have no idea where your $60,000 figure comes from, so it's difficult to respond to. A part time employee, let's say 30 hours, getting a $2.50 jump in base pay means an extra $75/week or $3,900/year.  Is the state doing this to jack income tax? Maybe. However, there are other states already paying higher. Some don't even allow a special minimum wage for tipped employees."
Albany,2x4jsi,Jumpov,5,Wed Feb 25 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"$60,000 a year is likely the cost the manager is seeing for the increase across the whole staff"

Albany,2x66zl,Learned_Response,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:43:26 2015 UTC,"Will this work any differently than the tax auctions? Most of those properties go unsold because the winning bidder has to pay the back taxes to claim the property, and in most cases the amount owed exceeds the value of the property.   If the city would forgo the back taxes, they would be able to move those properties, have new owners to renovate them, and pay property taxes.   Edit: The property list shows $0 owed taxes for all properties, so maybe the city did waive them. Interesting that they'll do that for the land bank, but not for individuals."
Albany,2x66zl,drsfmd,5,Thu Feb 26 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"The primary problem with the auction process was that out of town speculators would buy properties and never attempt to improve them, simply hold on to them in case the rest of the neighborhood improved.   As for taxes, most of the ""back taxes"" are actually owed to the county. At the end of the year the county makes the city whole, and takes on the owed taxes. Both entities have always been willing to work with responsible property owners if it meant the improvement of a property.   Like many of the land banks across the country, one of the Albany County Land Bank's primary missions is to promote local (ie. at least live in the county) ownership of a property. This is a proven method for improving a property. Many times at auction properties were being bid sky high and then never closed on. For anyone who ever went to an auction you would see vacant lots (no structure) being bid upwards of $5,000...$7,000...sometimes $10,000 by out of towners when locals were bidding reasonable rates. A month or so later, when it came time to pay, the winning bidder simply would recant and refuse to pay, and that would be that. The property would go back on the auction block. City after city has had this problem.  The point is that the city and county governments haven't been the primary roadblocks to redevelopment, the auction system was broken.   If you have thoughts the Land Bank's board meetings are open to the public."

Albany,2wzs5u,Bubblilly,3,Tue Feb 24 14:57:03 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of popular bars/restaurants, it all depends what kind of food/crowd/vibe you're looking for. Some of my favs are the Lucas Confectionary/Grocery/Peck's Arcade in Troy (basically 3 businesses with one owner, all pricey but worth it for an occasion), The Merry Monk in Albany for mussels/belgian beer, Pho Yum for...Pho, Olde English Pub for a super cozy pub bar with good if greasy classics. Most of those areas aren't going to have anything bringing you to them in the first place. A lot of the Arbor hill area is rough, but other than going to the Palace and wandering off, or finding Jamaican food on Henry Johnson, you won't be there anyway. The south end is the same deal, swaths of Troy, etc. Probably Verizon around here. Most of them are probably offering the basic ""high-speed"" internet from Time Warner, which is ok but always way slower than they promise. Some of them in certain areas might have Verizon FiOs (their fiber network that they just chose not to bring into Albany proper because fuck them) which is really good in my experience."
Albany,2wzs5u,sleazepleeze,3,Tue Feb 24 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"Every City/Town/Village in the area has some bad part, but in Albany I would avoid Arbor Hill, the south end. In Troy, most but not all of Lansingburg should be avoided..  For cell service, I have Verizon and I have never been without service unless I'm driving to my moms, which is up on Taborton mountain, and even then, it's only the drive it goes out, I have it at her house. All the other companies, it's very spotty.  I'm not huge on bars to be honest, I haven't drank in years. But for restaurants, there's a bunch. I like Famous Lunch, I love NY pizza, Ali Baba, Slidin' Dirty and The Park Pub in Troy. I'm a bit biased since I worked at the Park Pub, plus they have an amazing deck in the summer time. I don't eat the often in Albany, I would rather make my own food for lunch or dinner. But I have heard good things about Jack's Oyster House, but it's expensive. I personally enjoy the smaller family owned restaurants, and I try to avoid the chains, which we have a decent amount of. The Standard in Crossgates mall might seem like a chain restaurant, but it isn't. I like it because it's a 40's 50's themed restaurant.  As for the internet and cable service, I think you might be able to upgrade the service you have through the rental company, but I'm not sure. TimeWarner Cable is decent around here and so is DirecTV."

They've got lots of craft beer on tap, free flatbread cheese pizzas to soak up the beer, and a great brunch on weekends.    Same with the Old English Pub near the Palace. It's got a cool atmosphere, good food, and a selection of interesting beer and cider."
Albany,2wzs5u,serke,2,Tue Feb 24 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"Having lived in this area, and many other areas in the capital district, I can share with you some sweet places that you NEED to check out.  1.) Bars: Wine Bar on Lark St is a quaint little place that serves great wine for reasonable prices. Also check out Justin's for Jazz Night, also on Lark. Food: Gus's Hot Dogs in Watervliet. They are so tasty. Ignore the storefront, it looks run down but that is because the place has been here for decades. The hot dogs are tiny and like 70 cents a piece. You can get 5 dogs, 3 with the works, 2 with mustard and pay around $5. They are so tasty it's absurd. You can't tell anyone you live here unless you go there.  2.) Arbor Hill, Particularly Orange St. - and Lancingburgh/Far North Troy.  3.) AT&T works great for me, and you can't beat the rollover data plans they have now.  4.) Dialup is dead. The apartments here offer high speed through TW or Deep Blue of Verizon. You will get good speeds going out depending on where you are. The closer to a distribution frame you are, the faster the speeds. Some of the complexes offer ADSL. Can't speak for all of them but the service is better than what you might find elsewhere.   Also, If you are an avid hiker, you are pretty close to some good stuff. Thatcher Park, the ADK's, the Catskills. Check out http://bootscape.com"
Albany,2wzs5u,r1ckm4n,2,Wed Feb 25 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"New World Bistro! By far my favorite restaurant in this area. Seasonally changing menu with classics, souced local as possible, phenomenal food. There's a lot of good recommends here already, lot of pretty decent restaurants around. Can't comment on the bar scene as I am far too antisocial for bars. I have Virgin Mobile. It uses Sprint's network and is cheap as fuck. $35/month for unlimited data/text and like 200 talk minutes (there is a cap on data over which they slow you down, but its super high.) Decent coverage all around Albany, lose coverage in Southern Albany county where I work - but if I can get to the top of a hill I can usualy pick it up again. But since I work in bumfucknowhere and  the only phone coverage here is Verizon, that's not really a fair comparison. It's usually Time warner included. Take that as you will."
Albany,2x18zy,Thatotherredhead,4,Tue Feb 24 21:25:53 2015 UTC,"Tbh I could probably help, I am a college student and I am looking for an apartment for next year as well so it'd be good to get around and see places as well."
Albany,2x18zy,J_Cro,2,Wed Feb 25 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"It is a big college town so yes, you will see a lot of competition at that time of the year. Craigslist should be a good place to start.  I'm sure if you ask questions here a good number of us would be willing to answer. It really depends on your budget.   If you are set on working with a realtor, PM Me. My wife does marketing for one of the big ones and knows 100s of realtors."
Albany,2x18zy,albanydigital,2,Tue Feb 24 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"My wife and I moved here from 800 miles away and rented an apartment sight-unseen. It was a huge risk, but worked out wonderfully. We used www.padmapper.com to find our place."
Albany,2x18zy,akdem,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:06:59 2015 UTC,"Did you have anyone local check the place out for you, or just relied on the landlord's pictures?  When we moved here we found that most landlords weren't willing to take additional pictures for us, which is why we had to find someone local to help."
Albany,2x18zy,akdem,2,Tue Feb 24 23:28:17 2015 UTC,Our landlord did a quick facetime tour of the place for us. He was super friendly and we just decided he was trustworthy. It helps that the apartment is in the basement level of the house he lives in. It's a brownstone in Center Square.
Albany,2x18zy,jeffersonbible,2,Tue Feb 24 23:39:03 2015 UTC,That's a neat idea.
Albany,2x18zy,Mabepossibly,2,Wed Feb 25 01:31:08 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a very helpful landlord...and would be enough for me to rent.  Maybe I'll get lucky, too.  :D"
Albany,2x18zy,Mabepossibly,2,Wed Feb 25 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind when looking for flights Albany isn't your only option. Stewart Intl in Newburgh is less than 1:30 away. Syracuse and Hartford are 2 hours, the 3 NYC airports and Boston are under 3 hours. JFK and Laguardia are also easy to points to get to Penn Station and take Amtrak to Albany. Half the time when I travel for work I end up flying out of Newark. Total travel time is often less because you can get direct flights.   August is student rental season. The Pine Hills area aka the student ghetto is where they swarm to. Assuming your boyfriend is headed to AMC or Albany Med I'd look to the area that is SW of the hospital, even into Delmar/Bethlehem which is a nice suburban town on the edge of Albany."
Albany,2x18zy,serke,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:24:53 2015 UTC,"This is all good advice (and I will definitely keep it in mind when we're living there), but unfortunately the flight into Albany is the least of the travel issues.  Its mostly just that getting from here to there is going to take all day, no matter what we do, so it really eats into the time we can spend apartment hunting. We live 4.5 hours from a major city here, and the furthest west we can get on a direct flight from our town is Denver.  So if we wanted a direct flight anywhere near Albany we'd have to drive 4.5 hours to Portland, take a long flight, then drive 3 hours to Albany...and then we'd have to do the whole thing again 2-3 days later.  Basically...we've picked the most inconvenient place possible to move to.  :D  I do like the area southwest of the medical center (which is where he's working), particularly the area along Delaware.  It looks walkable with lots to do and the housing seems a bit less cramped than in the denser areas.  I've read mixed things on this sub about safety vs. neighborhoody, but it seems similar to where we lived in Chicago so I'm not too worried.  I have also looked at Delmar, which I think could work location-wise.  The commute looks easy, as does the ability to get to the good restaurants and bars...but I'd be disappointed to be in another suburban area.  I'm more of a city girl, so I'd love to be able to walk places again...and also not be stuck in the house all day while he has the car (I telecommute)."
Albany,2x18zy,jeffersonbible,2,Wed Feb 25 17:11:32 2015 UTC,"Take some NyQuil and knock yourself out before getting on the plane and time travel. Sleep in flight, you spend 8 hours sleeping everyday may as well overlap your downtime. Plus checking out some of these areas at 9pm on a Friday would give you a good perspective.   Delaware Ave is on the way up and has some great restaurants. It really depends how much of an urban experience your willing to deal with. The good news is that there is plenty of housing near Albany Med that is easily in biking range and accessible on CDTA busses. To be honest employee parking at AMC sucks, he may prefer to bike or bus it. If you look at the map the whole area south of Rt 20, west of Delaware and to the limits of rt 85 and I90 are walkable nice areas. Also center square which is west of the Empire State Plaza and east of Washington park is a great walkable area. Lark Street is the center of it and the hip neighborhood. The houses are almost all historical brownstones. Parking is a bitch but not bad with 1 car and it's half a mile to a mile from AMC.   Between students and people moving in for Tech companies we get these questions on a weekly basis. If you search this sub for moving or apartments you will find a ton of advice other people has solicited."
Albany,2x18zy,jeffersonbible,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I particularly appreciate the heads up on the employee parking situation.    There's definitely a lot of good advice in this sub, and I've been doing lots of reading here and elsewhere.  I tried to keep my questions to things I hadn't already seen answered 20 times so as not to add to the duplicates.  :D  I'm still hoping someone will pop up with an apartment service recommendation, but it doesn't look like they exist in Albany."
Albany,2x18zy,Turrrrrr,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"My experience in renting apartments is exclusively Craigslist, and yes - you'll have some trouble finding something you're looking for amid all the college listings for August. Though it becomes easy to visually weed out the spam mostly by the way they title the listing."
Albany,2x18zy,donamh,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"It seems like there are very few places with two bathrooms on the market right now...is that normal for the area?   Depends on what kind of place you're looking for. If you want an apartment with fewer than four bedrooms and you're looking in student-oriented neighborhoods, yeah, you won't find many places with multiple bathrooms. Some of the newer luxury units might have them. Where do you think you want to live?   It's even common for older houses to only have one bathroom."
Albany,2x18zy,jeffersonbible,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"We're not looking in student-oriented neighborhoods, though one of our priorities is to live somewhere walkable since we only have one car.  So I've been focusing on areas with high walk scores.  The student area is one of those, but its not my first choice because of how we're in our 30s and kind of over all that...but we're not that curmudgeonly about noise so I'd consider it if I found a great place.  I'm mostly looking along Delaware (I know it gets mixed reviews for safety, but it looks and sounds a lot like our neighborhood in Chicago so I think we can handle it), and in the areas south and east of Washington Park (though I worry about parking there).  This sub recommends the area along New Scotland frequently...but from looking at google streetview and walkscore.com, there doesn't actually seem to be much there except housing, which isn't what we want.   I've been a bit thrown off by how most of the housing in the Albany city limits is older...we have a very healthy budget for the area, but it doesn't seem like we could spend enough right now to get what we want.  Even going up to the $1700+ units its still largely one bathroom, tiny rooms and weird cramped kitchens, just with nicer fixtures.  I am living in a small city in Oregon that's basically a big suburb, and I miss actual urban life a lot...so we're hesitant to look in the suburbs.  But it looks like that's the choice we'll have to make: modern housing amenities or city-like living.  I'm hoping maybe there will be more selection in the summer."

Albany,2wnipn,mrlint,16,Sat Feb 21 13:15:23 2015 UTC,"What a shame. Seems like he was an intelligent, interesting and caring person and the world needs more of those."
Albany,2wnipn,Freepi,5,Sat Feb 21 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Draven Rodriguez, a quick-witted senior at Schenectady High School who made national news last fall when a proposed yearbook portrait of him with his cat against a background of laser beams went viral online, died Thursday at home. He was 17. The cause was suicide, his parents said.  Although his humor and intelligence were readily apparent, Rodriguez was more cherished by family and schoolmates for his easy facility for friendship.  ""He made friends wherever he went,"" said Rodriguez's father, Jonathan Stewart. ""He had friends all over the country — people he'd met at youth-leadership conferences, online, just around town.""  Among those was Reza Zand, co-owner of the Schenectady restaurant Persian Bite, which Rodriguez frequented partly for the food and partly to talk to Zand and his brother, Arousol, whose stories as emigres from Iran intrigued him.  In a Facebook post from Jan. 29, Rodriguez quoted Reza Zand as saying, ""We are all people, and we should help each other out,"" then commented, ""It was simple, but really powerful. He's definitely one of my favorite people in all of Schenectady.""  ""He had an empathy for the world and for other people that I think is rare in kids his age,"" said Stewart. ""It was wonderful to see.""  Born Oct. 6, 1997, at Bellevue Hospital in Niskayuna, Rodriguez had his rebellious phase early: At 9, he wanted to dye his hair green, which his parents allowed as long as he brought home excellent grades. He kept his green locks until they no longer appealed to him, and by middle school his dark hair sported a short, preppy cut.  Rodriguez had omnivorous interests — teaching himself guitar, learning words from a Russian-English dictionary, rowing crew, making smoked ribs and other barbecue fare with Stewart, computers — and most were characterized by a single-minded determination to achieve what he set out to do. Which partly explains his briefly famous cat-and-lasers photo.  ""He wasn't trying to stir things up with it,"" said Stewart. ""He honestly just wanted a silly photo because he had a great sense of humor.""  Working with Schenectady-based photographer Vincent Giordano, Rodriguez created an intentionally cheesy, laser-streaked portrait of himself holding Mr. Bigglesworth, a long, bushy stray cat who'd gotten into the family home and never left.  Anticipating resistance from the school to his desire to have it included among the senior class' formal portraits, Rodriguez posted the photo online to garner support. It blazed around the Internet and was mentioned by Jimmy Fallon in a ""Tonight Show"" monologue and by talk-show host Ellen Degeneres.  Citing school policy, Schenectady High's principal, Diane Wilkinson, rejected it for the portraits section but participated in the making of a similar photo in which she posed with her rescue Chihuahua, Rodriguez, and he with Mr. Bigglesworth.  It will get its own page in the yearbook with a message about the importance of adopting pets through shelters and rescue organizations. Stewart said Friday he believed the page still would be in the yearbook.  Rodriguez's Facebook posts ranged from thoughts on world affairs to struggling with the lid on a jar of peanut butter to his latest efforts on guitar, all delivered with proper spelling and punctuation, including a correct deployment of hyphens that was atypical for someone his age.  ""He was a grammar Nazi,"" said Stewart with a laugh. ""He'd always find mistakes on signs, menus — 'Look, they're not using the apostrophe right!' He loved the English language.""  In middle school, Rodriguez so frequently corrected mistakes by an English teacher that, when an observer was coming to the class for the day, she asked him to refrain, at least verbally.  According to Stewart, the teacher told Rodriguez, ""Please don't say anything during class. If you want to, you can write down any mistakes and show it to me afterward."" He did.  Rodriguez is survived by Stewart; his mother, Melissa Petersen-Stewart; his 11-year-old sister, Lily Stewart; his biological father, Erik Rodriguez;  Rodriguez's wife, Amy; and many other family members.  Calling hours are 4 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the New Comer Funeral Home, 343 New Karner Road, Colonie. Funeral services on Friday will be private."

The fare is the total amount that needs to be paid. If the fare was $12 and there were 3 people in the car, each would pay $4.   Here, the cab drivers just come up with some ridiculous  number in their head and demand that each occupant pay it.  I too took the cab from the train station to the UA campus with a couple friends once. The cab driver made us EACH pay $20 for the ride (which I like 10 min max). That is beyond insane. There were four of us in the cab. That lady made $80 fucking dollars for a 10 minute ride! To top it all off, wen she got my suitcase out of the trunk she looked at me like she was expecting a tip. That's insane. The worst part is that we are being blatantly ripped off and there's nothing you can do.  Like all cities.

Basically, the baby was right there and ready to be born. The nurses were asking all these questions when we got to the room like, ""What is your religion?""  My wife was in a bit of pain and was like, ""Jesus Christ...are you serious???""  We had a doula with us who quietly informed the nurses that maybe someone should check my wife and just see how things were going.  One nurse did a quick check and was like, ""WOW! The baby is ready to come out!  Why are we asking all these dumb questions?!?!""  Not a terrible experience, just a bit silly."

I would recommend it, especially since I've repeatedly been back to Albany Med for various procedures/tests and I'm in their system already.   St. Peter's is fine, but since I'm at the age where a lot of my friends are starting to (intentionally) pop out kids, the opinion seems to be of Albany Med. I don't doubt St. Peter's has friendly staff, etc, but Albany Med had the least mistakes and the best medical care. When I've been there for non-maternity things I've loved the staff."

I agree with others that if you are high-risk, AMC is where you want to be, otherwise St. Peters. Have you checked with your Doctor? Generally they will only deliver at one or the other."

I've sent my records to a new practice and will be calling about an appointment this week. I was leaning more towards St. Peter's, and this thread seems to support that. We don't have any risks as of yet."
Albany,2wnjk2,plausible-rationale,2,Sun Feb 22 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"My wife goes to Upstate OB/GYN. They were great there. They have 4 doctors there, and throughout your pregnancy you have an appt with all of them, so you have at least met the doctor delivering your baby. Obviously, I am a guy, so I have a different perspective, but she goes to Dr. Colluccio, and really likes her, but all the other docs there are great too. I wasn't worried if we ended up having one doc vs. the other when she went into labor.  Another good thing with them, and St. Peters, is they are a pretty conservative practice, as in they will not let you do an elective c-section or induction for no good reason. They wouldn't let us schedule an induction until after my wife was at 41 weeks. My wife ended up having a tough childbirth (40 hours), but were very good about discussing options on whether or not to end up having a c-section when it came that time because she had not progressed during labor."
Albany,2wnjk2,pogue23,1 point,Sun Feb 22 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"Myself, my siblings and a long line of relatives were all born at St. Pete's decades ago, but my daughter and nieces (and countless spawn of the above mentioned relatives) were born there too.  I'm not partial to any hospital because of historic value, SPH is where my wife's doctors practiced so it's where we were going ( I also live very close by so the drive at 2 AM was a breeze).  We had no complications with the birth, but there were some breastfeeding issues that the nursing staff was amazing at helping.  The delivery staff was also top notch.  My niece was really premature (over a month) and the staff was amazing to her and my sister.  I also have a friend whose kid was even more premature and he has noting but good things to say about the staff.  The fact that there's two great hospitals in the area makes this a tough decision, but it's one where even if you choose the ""lesser"" you're going to be well off."

Albany,2whq0q,laughlines,3,Fri Feb 20 11:54:02 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic, but I think it's worth discussing; more areas than not are safe in this region. We're fortunate to not have a run away crime problem in the Capital Region, so I'd hate for you to limit yourself because of a fear of crime. Of course feeling safe is vital to a person's happiness, and if that's only going to be achieved in certain areas then obviously you should pursue living there. But from my knowledge of Bethlehem you're going to have a hard time finding something in your price range, so you may need to broaden your search area.  Can you provide more detail on what you're looking for? Complexes are hard to come by in this area, so if that's a ""must have"" then say so. Is being close to work important or are you fine driving to work?  I had a really great landlord and would be happy to PM you his contact info, but I think he predominately has properties in Albany. If that's a nonstarter no worries."

Albany,2waac3,obsolete-logic,7,Wed Feb 18 06:03:04 2015 UTC,"Lots of new law students on this board lately.   The good thing about Albany is that it's not really that big, nothing is really ever ""far"" from where you are.   The 13 and 100 bus routes will hook you directly to Albany Law, but the challenge will be getting to SUNY (And when you say the main campus I assume you mean the ""uptown campus""). If you live further up New Scotland the neighborhoods are nice, but they're less renter friendly and more suburban. From there it will be difficult to get across town, you'll need to transfer and in doing so you'll actually take yourself further away from SUNY.   If you're into the urban environment, and if you don't drive, then Center Square could be a great location. Rent might be a bit pricey for you, but you'll be in the heart of the urban community, a safe historic neighborhood, that will act as a transportation hub to either Albany Law or SUNY Albany. Parking can be tough, sometimes a nightmare, and if you are on a tight budget you'll only be able to get a tiny and/or basement apartment. It can also be a little noisy if you're close to Lark St, which means that you're close to nightlife and all of the things that come with it.  Pine Hills is a very large neighborhood and composes much of mid town Albany. A good portion of that is the College Ghetto, which you will most certainly want to avoid. It's not that it's ""bad"", it just means that it's geared only towards college kids who want to live five people in a two bedroom apartment and pay $200 a month in rent. They get loud, the buildings are run down, it's the kind of place that you'll love when you're 20, and hate when you're 30. In general the College Ghetto can be identified as the area boarded by Madison Ave, Partridge St/Oleary Blvd, Washington Ave, and North/South Lake Ave. That square is ground zero for low rent and college life.  I use to live in the area bounded by North Main, Western Ave/Madison Ave, Manning Blvd, and Washington Ave. That was a nice neighborhood that I never had a problem in. The bus ride to SUNY is easy, but you will probably want a transfer to get to Albany Law (technically it is walkable from the 114, but it's a bit of a hike up New Scotland). Rent was affordable, I lived alone, and never had good access to things in the area. Would recommend it, especially if you have a car.  Last point- you're probably going to want to rule out anything north of Central Ave. There's some real gems up there, but you're getting away from Albany Law, and the neighborhoods are rough...there's no real way around it. If you like the idea of urban pioneering then you should check it out (the Ten Broeck Neighborhood is really nice).  That's a crash course in Albany. I hope it helped."
Albany,2waac3,UpSNYer,5,Wed Feb 18 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"The center square area is really nice. To reach the SUNY Albany campus you have the benefit of being in between the 114 bus or the 12 bus which will take you directly to collins circle on the campus. It also is close to Lark St which has the 734 that goes down new scotland towards the albany law campus. The possible issues with this is it quite lively with college students on the weekend because of the bars and great restaurants in the area. Anything around center square is pretty close to arterial bus routes to get you anywhere in the city. It's considered pretty much the cultural hub of the area or ""the village within the city"". My friend lives in the knickerbocker building which isn't bad. Unfortunately there aren't too many complexes in the area but it's really the only nicer area that will allow you the versatility of going in between the law school and the SUNY campus while being closer to the law school which is within walking distance. It's also very close to washington park which is very nice. It does run a little pricey at some points ($400-$800/month). I'm sorry I can't be of more help with helping provide buildings in particular but I hope that this helps narrow down the areas for you."

I live on Willett and love it, Lark street is a 10 second walk if I wanna go out and grab food or a drink, price choppers only a block away, yet it's far enough to away from lark to not be a total shithole like the actual apartments on lark. I'd check out 75 Willett if you want to live in a very very nice/luxury complex, or The Willett (84-92 Willett) if you'd like a complex that's a bit older but much more affordable."
Albany,2waac3,The_Nox,3,Sat Feb 21 03:05:01 2015 UTC,"My best advice is be willing to look at places that are not apartment complexes. I lived for 3 years in a great house with a yard, driveway, and garage renting for a pretty reasonable price. You guys don't seem like big drivers so a rental house with no off-street parking would be even cheaper.  Albany is a weird market and it seems like all the property is rental due to the student populations.  Avoid pine hills for the most part, it's over priced rentals specifically due to students (called the student ghetto). I lived on the border between the Heldeberg and New Scotland neighborhoods between the two hospitals and it was great! Also seemed like a lot of rentals in that area."

Think about it this way: they say no rain and it rains, you're pissed and wet. They say rain and it doesn't, you're just annoyed you brought your umbrella for nothing, but you're dry anyway. If you're gonna be wrong, be wrong that way.   So they over-predict the worse conditions to over prepare you for possibly nothing to happen. Which isn't a bad thing to be well prepared, but if you want accuracy of what will actually hit us, see weather.gov. Doesn't have the same commercial interest to do that."

Albany,2w2w1p,mood__ring,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:48:44 2015 UTC,Possibly- my friend did the same move on the first of this month but for a one bedroom and it was around $300.  Don't know the company but I can find out if needed.
Albany,2w2w1p,couchisland,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:55:29 2015 UTC,I paid almost $1000 a few years ago to move a flat from Schenectady to two destinations in Troy (apartment and storage.) $600 sounds good.
Albany,2w2w1p,cybermage,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:33:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that's about right. Movers are usually pretty expensive.
Albany,2w2w1p,faildata,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"I used Handle-It movers, (518) 764-3853 to move a 2-bed apartment to a house from Cohoes to Stephentown for about $800. I had some large furniture items like a dining table and china cabinet that added to the cost, and my distance was a bit longer than yours. The staff were very friendly, helpful, and everything arrived in good shape."

Albany,2vzr5q,omahoopsfan,6,Sun Feb 15 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"I am a recent grad (Within last 5 years), Unfortunately, ALS isn't what it used to be. They have been massively cutting staff, and hemorrhaging money. The school has a culture where the professors run the academics, which means they focus on their own research and writing, and not preparing you for the Bar Exam, or being a lawyer. There are a couple great teachers there, but it is a rarity. I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you want to PM me, and we can discuss further, please feel free to."

I'm studying for the bar right now (next Tuesday!!), but I'd be happy to answer your questions if you PM me.   Overall, I had a really good experience but it depends on what you want out of law school. I didn't want big law, so I was happy at a school where I got a great scholarship and where the local job placement is good.   If you want to work in big law, go elsewhere.   Anyway, PM me specific questions and I'll get back to you."

Albany,2vzr5q,EndlessIke,3,Mon Feb 16 13:35:57 2015 UTC,"Current student here. It's very much what you put into it. It's no Harvard, but we're a decent regional school if you want to practice in New York. Don't come here if you're looking to go to California or Texas, but like the other poster said, for state government, it's a no brainer. You can even get jobs in NYC, but you have to bust your ass to make contacts and set yourself apart. The Bar isn't easy for anyone, but if you take all the bar classes and do your prep right, you'll be fine. It's hard. It's the hardest thing I've ever done and some days I regret it, but on others I love what I do.   Bottom line, Albany Law is fine if you want to practice in New York. Study, get decent grades, show initiative, make contacts, be different, do Pro-Bono, do moot court, do a journal, join clubs, meet people, get involved, and study for the bar, and you'll be fine."
Albany,2vzr5q,EndlessIke,3,Sun Feb 15 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"The thing about albany law is that it takes 3 years, costs 150-200k, and MAYBE helps you get job working in state government, where you will make 50k.  Plenty of people will wind up without jobs at all.   Plenty of other people already have jobs that pay around 50k, or will pay around 50k with 3 years more experience.   I would strongly consider all of this thing before enrolling. I'm not sure its a winning proposition for most people unless the scholarship makes it close to free.   Also, is the scholarship contingent on maintaining a certain GPA? Grading in Law School is completely different from undergrad. If its contingent you need to consider the very real possibility that you lose it after the first year."
Albany,2vzr5q,plausible-rationale,2,Mon Feb 16 15:03:20 2015 UTC,scholarship is contingent on staying in top 50%.
Albany,2vzr5q,drsfmd,2,Wed Feb 18 19:50:00 2015 UTC,"Some law schools put all of their scholarship kids in the same section, where a strict curve guarantees some percentage can't make the grades necessary to maintain it.   My strong recommendation is to not to go to law school, but most people don't listen."
Albany,2vzr5q,UpSNYer,2,Thu Feb 19 13:53:46 2015 UTC,"Have you applied to Buffalo?  Also, everything the poster above you said is spot on.  Also, try and get more money from Albany, works especially well if you have other offers at cheaper schools and can say ""I want to pay their tuition at your school.""  That said, I went here and would not recommend going there until they figure out who the hell they are.  There's some great professors (still around) and I had a great time and passed the bar fine, but the debt is atrocious and they lost their identity.  The only thing good about a regional law school is its bar passage rate and the networking (from a cost benefit analysis).  As for the bar passage rate, that comes from a lot of things, which ALS has apparently forgotten.  They went from top 3 in the state to bottom 3 in bar passage rate.  As for the networking, most of the older lawyers went to the school that was in the top 3, hell, even the top 10.  Albany hovers around 12-14 in passage rate (out of 15).  Whatever they used to do, they need to start doing again.  I'll admit they're trying, having gone through 2 deans in 3 or so years, but do you really want to be the person who they test their new strategy on?"
Albany,2vzr5q,yodaboy64,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"thanks for the thoughts. yes, I also applied to Buffalo and Syracuse. my preference is to be in northern NY, or at least north of the city."

It's a mediocre law school at best, with a below average passage rate for the bar exam.   If you can get into a better school and have other options on the table, you should probably take the other options."
Albany,2vzr5q,jeffersonbible,2,Sun Feb 15 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"I have some family and friends currently enrolled, and their opinions are very mixed. The school is in a very challenging phase of its existence and is struggling in many ways. They are accepting more applicants than in previous generations and the quality of the graduating classes has dropped accordingly. On the positive they've told me that you will get out of it what you put into it, and NONE have said that it's an ""easy"" school. To a person they have all said that it's the hardest thing they've ever done, and I think that's an encouraging thing to hear. The BAR requires an insane amount of studying in order to pass, but I'm not sure if that changes if you were to go to Harvard.  The most contentious debate I've heard was whether or not Law School was worth it in the first place. The bills are huge and the number of lawyers greater every year. If you do go you're going to need to find a niche that isn't being swamped with recent grads. I think Albany Law is probably a satisfactory place to go to school if you're the first in your family to go down that road. You could do a lot better, but those schools are simply unaffordable.   If you do decide to go, as was mentioned in another thread, you're probably going to live right in Albany to cut down on the commute."
Albany,2vzr5q,GenuineRisk,2,Sun Feb 15 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"Current student here: there are a lot of reasons, on paper, not to go to Albany Law School, but after three years, I feel ready to practice, it definitely gave me opportunities in this community, and I've got at least a job coming out of it. If you're interested in state government, it's a no-brainer, because there are a ton of opportunities for that, and if you do well, put your head down, the geographic sphere increases. I mean, I don't have a ton of reference, having only gone to one law school, but ALS has done alright by me."

Albany,2vzr5q,h3r4ld,1 point,Tue Feb 17 07:57:38 2015 UTC,"I graduated in 2012 and to be honest I loved it. I loved the culture of the school- the student body was not cut throat and was much more collaborative than I've heard about students at other schools. I made some of my best friends there. I got a good job in Boston (I'm from MA) at graduation and am now moving back to the Albany area for an even better local job.   I'm glad I chose Albany over the other schools I got into (New England School of Law, Suffolk Law School, and a few others in this ""tier""). You need to work hard - you'll only get out of it what you put into it. You need to study your ass off for the bar. You need to do your best from your first year to get good internships to set yourself up for a job when you graduate.   You have to ask yourself if you really want to go to law school? You will graduate in a ton of debt. Will it be worth it? Where do you want to practice? This makes a huge difference. If you want to practice in the Albany area it's the school to go to. If you want to practice in NYC or Boston it may not be.   All that being said, if you get into a law school in a higher tier for a similar price then I would go with the better school. Don't pass up Harvard for Albany ya know? But if your looking at similar schools and want to practice in NY then I'd recommend Albany Law."

There is a company called Palatine Cheese that makes mostly cheddar and cheddar variants, and they are, appropriately enough, in Palatine.  The cheese is sold vacuum sealed, so it should be okay without refrigeration until it is opened.  I mentioned Altamont Vineyards elsewhere in this thread, but I'll mention them again for completeness.  There are a number of local bakeries that make very good bread, including Our Daily Bread in Chatham, and Perecca's in Schenectady, to name two.  RAD Soap Company makes a wide variety of soaps and skin care products, all natural and all made in New York.  Villa Italia Pasticceria in Schenectady makes some fantastic pastries, though you will have to select carefully for ones that do not require refrigeration."

You don't want to commute in from the burbs as a law student.   Really between New Scotland, quail Madison and Manning is all pretty good for a student. It gets nicer closer to St Peter's.

Albany,2vs8fg,UpSNYer,3,Fri Feb 13 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would go with pine hills. you say it's expensive, but it's well within your budget, and has what you're looking for. With 1 roommate, you can get a place for 400 to 500 with off street parking. A lot of places have laundry hook ups, but generally you can buy the machine off the previous resident (and then sell it again when you move).  Remember, you will be a grad student. You will probably be at school early, and stay late. Being close to school will be a real benefit. Plus, you'll be near your classmates. south of new Scotland is generally quieter than north and a little bit older, if that's your scene."
Albany,2vs8fg,what_comes_after_q,2,Fri Feb 13 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"Pine Hills is a very large area for the city, much of which is the traditional college ghetto. As I said before, I think you'd want to avoid the heart of the CG, because it can be pretty rowdy and full of young kids. Parts of Pine Hills are going to be great for you, but whatever you do you'll want to avoid the area boarded by South Lake, Madison, Washington, and Partridge. I can't see a law student being happy down there."
Albany,2vs8fg,fongaboo,5,Fri Feb 13 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed for the most part, but I really hate the term college ghetto. Mostly because 1) it's not a ghetto, and 2) it's street by street. Where I live it's mostly young families and med students. Not rowdy at all. That said, west of quail, south of Madison, yeah, that's a pretty rowdy area. However, st rose kids tend to stay between quail, madison, s allen, and woodlawn. Outside that area, down by new scotland, and it's pretty nice and quiet.

Albany,2vs8fg,Giblet15,3,Sat Feb 14 05:22:17 2015 UTC,"I'm at Albany Law now and I went over to the Troy area. Way cheaper than Albany and if you avoid North Troy and Lansingburgh, your fine."
Albany,2vs8fg,Bubblilly,2,Sun Feb 15 18:28:05 2015 UTC,Cohoes and Waterford are fairly cheep. Cohoes is definitely cheaper but the area isn't as nice. About 30 minutes up 787
Albany,2vs8fg,jeffersonbible,6,Fri Feb 13 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend against this. The trip from Cohoes/Waterford to Albany is pretty straight forward, but your approach to the actual campus will be kinda a pain in the ass because you're going to have to weave your way through the city. I have a cousin who did this commute from Troy and she said that it was absolutely a deal breaker because of traffic and parking. Again, as the crow flies it's a pretty easy and quick drive, but as soon as you get off of 787 your going to be zig-zagging your way through the city.  If I were you I would look into living right in Albany. Assuming you're a little older than a typical college student and that you want to take your work seriously you're going to want to avoid the traditional college ghetto. When I was in grad school I lived in the North Main area between Allen, Washington, and Western and loved it. It's a bit pricey for what you quoted, but you'll live alone, with a good neighborhood. The downside is that you'll be a bit far from campus and will either want to take the bus or drive.  If walking to campus is something you want then you should consider the New Scotland area. It varies wildly from college ghetto to families and homeowners, but it may fit your price range better and puts you closer to campus. I don't have a lot of experience with living in this area, but it would be a good area to check out.  One last thing to keep in mind, the parking pass for Albany Law is expensive. Assuming you are a typical broke law student it's money that will sting to lose. If you can avoid paying it and walk/bus it to campus you will save some money."
Albany,2vs8fg,GenuineRisk,2,Fri Feb 13 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input! I'll be sure to look into it!  About how long of a commute would that be, considering how bad traffic can be past the twin bridges?"
Albany,2vs8fg,Jevanmanny,2,Fri Feb 13 17:57:20 2015 UTC,You don't go by the twins at all. They are 87. The 30 minutes was a guess with traffic. Takes me about 20 to go from Waterford to downtown Albany. If you look at direction on the computer version of Google maps you can have it show you traffic at certain times of day.

Rents will easily be near or above $1000/mo. The Town of New Scotland is more rural and nearby as well and has multiple school districts that are good,Bethlehem and Voorheesville, the Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk district is not as highly rated but still a decent/safe school district.

Albany,2vopt0,Freepi,4,Thu Feb 19 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"Idk I work and went to high school in Delmar and the businesses in Bethlehem are where I go for most necessities since I live in a more rural area. It's extremely safe. The four-corners area has some small-town feel and around there is probably the best place to live. Bethlehem also has a really nice town park with a pool, jungle gym, town sponsored sports teams. It's safe even if it occasionally has a problem or two like every other town on the planet. They have an impressive planning board with regulations on development that try to get new development to have that small town look. From my professional planning perspective, some parts of Bethlehem experience the same car-oriented sprawl that most American towns deal with but they have a committee working to create a walkable and bikeable and safe pedestrian community. It's very rare to hear of major crimes occurring in Delmar or anywhere in Bethlehem. I don't believe I've ever heard of any drive-by shootings, there's very few robberies, and maybe 1-2 murders in the past like 10 years (unless they keep them from hitting the news the ""porco murder"" that was turned into a tv movie is the only one that comes to mind and that was crime committed within one family-not random or aimed at strangers).

Schools here are all excellent compared to most of the country. Albany high, a falling school, sent like 6 kids to ivy league schools last year.  It's the environment you pay for in the burbs, which is fine depending in what you want. All burbs here are safe and easy to get around compared to most cities. Colonie is the most central to the area. It has two school districts. North Colonie is the better district. Also more expensive.  The closer you get to one of the tri cities, the older the neighborhoods and the more ""character"". Clifton Park was all farms 30 years ago so it's the newest and feels that way - lots of cul de sacs and disconnected streets, etc. I know people who are happy over almost every area in the capital district and people who disliked living in the exact same areas.  It comes down to what you want, how much space you need and what you can afford. Get a good realtor. Pick the town that sounds/feels the best to you. Consider renting for a while first.  Good luck.

I would definitely suggest the Bethlehem/Delmar area if it's within your budget and you'll find nice housing/apartment complexes there.  There is plenty of shopping for your average everyday stuff all over this area along with a Lowes and a Super Walmart in Glenmont.  There are two very large malls, Crossgates Mall and Colonie Center that are one exit away (Basically the other side of Albany from Delmar/Bethlehem).     I prefer living south of Albany as the traffic is not as bad and expenses are much less.  Everything is congested at 5PM, for me it's more manageable heading south.  Ravena is even cheaper and easier to get in and out of Albany as I see it, unfortunately the local economy is not bustling and we drive the 8ish miles to Bethlehem to shop.  I like Ravena, but I would seriously consider Bethlehem if I could afford it.  The property taxes as well as property values are what stopped me from looking there.  I was able to get the same in Ravena for nearly half the cost.  The benefits of Ravena I can share are as follows:   It's quiet If you are a techie, all of the Villages of Ravena and Coxsackie are covered with fiber to the home from StateTel... not many people know this and it's hillarious as their website is straight out of 1994 and doesn't even mention it.  They are an independent, but I like them.  It's not Google/FIOS speeds, but I do not get slow downs EVER even during peak times. No Verizon or Timewarner to dick you around.  The cable company south of Bethlehem is Mid-Hudson Cable (everywhere else is Timewarner) and they are pretty straight forward and are not too bad technology wise, you could always get DirectTV or Dish anyway, but for me the fiber is where it's at.... If you ever buy a house...property taxes are quite a bit less than Bethlehem/Delmar, but their school district is ranked quite high though Ravena is not ranked terribly far behind either. I work downtown so on my way in I get on the Thruway (I87) a few miles out of town at exit 22 and ride one exit then get on 787 into downtown.  Including dealing with the parking garage and walking, I can leave my garage and be sitting at my desk in 25 minutes, bypassing Bethlehem completely.  If I need to shop on the way home, I just drive through Bethlehem and it really doesn't add much if you avoid the 5PM rush."
Albany,2vopt0,CaptainRelevant,5,Sat Feb 14 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"Shenendoah and Niskayuna are good school districts. if you move north of the Mohawk River you'll get more square feet per dollar. Clifton Park is growing. Has good shopping, quick access to highways, in the Shen school district, and has some pretty farmy areas too if you like that.   Your questions are pretty broad without knowing which area you'll be working in."
Albany,2vopt0,techie1980,3,Sat Feb 14 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"Only issue with this is having to take the Northway.  If no morons have crashed, it's like a 35 minute drive to where she works.  Unfortunately there's an accident about every other day.  If there's even a hint of congestion, you're talking 45-55 minutes.  Snow regularly bumps that to an hour or more.  It's a great area but I skipped it specifically because I couldn't deal with that big of a time variance for my commute."
Albany,2vopt0,midnyghtchilde,2,Sun Feb 15 09:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'm lucky in that I could easily get on at Crescent Rd, the last exit before the twin bridges, instead of 8a or 9. I have some congestion to the bridges (~10 mins) and then I'm good to go. If I get on north of that it could add 30 mins."
Albany,2vopt0,MyNameIsRobPaulson,3,Fri Feb 13 00:03:03 2015 UTC,"First, you should reclassify your search to be in the Capital District. Albany is a medium sized city, and is surrounded by other medium sized cities: Troy and Schenectady, not to   As many people have said for neighborhoods: It depends. If you choose to live near Saratoga Springs, which is considered a nicer area, you're probably looking at around $350k for a house, and Colonie (another neighborhood with good schools) is averaging around $210k according to zillow.   Guilderland also has high marks for schools, as does Niskayuna.    It's worth noting that NY has a long and proud history of really poor municipal planning - ie: plan on relatively high property taxes and build that into your calculations.     It also depends on what kind of lifestyle you're looking for. If you want to live in a walkable neighborhood, you will pay more for that. If you want to live in the suburbs, the initial costs will be somewhat lower but your overhead will be higher.   As to Corporate Woods, it's a fairly nice area. It has an exit directly off of the highway.    Personally, I'd say you should plan on a combined income of around $80-100k to be able to survive in most of the suburbs, based purely on the numbers. Yes, you can get a nice house and a mortgage around $1000, but you still have to heat the thing and keep the car gassed and insured. And of course feeding and clothing the family, which I'm sure you're familiar with.   For renting a room,  you should avoid anything marketed toward students. There are a lot of colleges in the area, and there's a lot of landlords who aren't very good."

Albany,2vopt0,jeffersonbible,9,Fri Feb 13 05:53:14 2015 UTC,"Don't think of it as ""Albany"" but the ""Capital District"".  Truth is, Albany proper is not where you want to live, although there are some decent suburbs.  Most people commute from the surrounding suburbs that may have a better quality of life.  Clifton Park, Colonie, just sort of get a map, look at all the surrounding towns and do a little googling.  Narrow it down.    Being from Idaho, I'd imagine you like to have some land.    How far are you willing to commute into Albany and what kind of character do you look for in a place to live?    People might try to sell you Albany - but its got a lot of crime, has a mostly transient population and very few families.  Its basically the inconveniences of living in a city, with very few of the conveniences."

I don't worry about her walking to the store at night time.  My daughter is incredibly mature though, and very level headed.  I know I'm biased but she's amazing and doesn't get into any trouble at all.  So I'm not too worried about things.  She's just lived her entire life in an area that's extremely safe and low key, so she's a little afraid to move so far away where she knows nothing and no one."

There is crime in the city just like you would find in any city, but as long as your not walking around visibly drunk at night looking like a target or buying drugs you shouldn't run in to any problems enjoying all that Albany has to offer.  There is so much to do around the area, lots of great hiking, eating, museums, and day trips to take (very close to NYC, Boston, and Montreal).

Albany,2vopt0,TweakedNipple,4,Fri Feb 13 02:13:09 2015 UTC,"Realistic livable salary is hard to answer but I'd say that depending on how much you end up spending on a house $50k would probably suffice.  If you're just looking for a room for the two months before your family gets here, a few hundred for a room would be reasonable.  After they get here, an apartment outside of Albany that would fit a family of four would probably be around $1200.  In the student area of Albany, you could probably find something that won't be as nice for $800-$900.  Best areas to live is entirely subjective.  Guilderland has 3-4 apartment complexes right near the middle school that would probably be pretty good as a landing area for your family.  Your commute from there would be about 15 minutes.  I'd suggest spending some time driving around the various areas to see what you like.  For settling down, you'll probably be fine as long as you don't end up in any of the cities themselves.  Albany, Schenectady, and Troy have their nice areas but also have some not so nice areas and the public schools are not that great.  The school districts in almost all of the surrounding suburbs are varying degrees of good/great.  You can potentially narrow your search further if you have an idea of what size graduating class you'd find ideal.  Stuff about the area- A lot of people here have an unreasonable dislike for the area.  I'm not sure why.  I've always found it to be a great balance between city features and rural areas.  There's enough of a population here to support some really great cultural attractions but at the same time you can drive 20 minutes and enjoy some really great parks in more rural areas.  There's a wide variety of really great food - check out the Table Hopping blog on the Times Union website for some good info on the local food scene.  One exception, for some reason, the pizza here sucks.  I really don't know why given our proximity to NYC but I've yet to find a really good thin crust pizza place.  Libraries are pretty awesome.  Corporate woods is exit 5a right off route 90 so getting there from anywhere is pretty straightforward.  If your building doesn't have a decent cafeteria, most of the nearest food options are 10-15 minutes away so I'd suggest planning on packing your own lunch.  Best bet for fast food from work would be to get on 90 heading west and take exit 5 to Central Ave.  There's a bunch of fast food places there and there's a back way onto 85 right near McDonalds and Taco Bell that will dump you right back onto 90 to get back to work without dealing with Central Ave. traffic.  I can usually get from Corporate Woods to either of those fast food places, get food and get back to my desk within 30 minutes."

Albany,2vkgdw,Koldslaw,2,Thu Feb 12 03:46:45 2015 UTC,Yeah if south main is like that I couldn't imagine trying to get down quail st. That street is practically one way in the best conditions. Madison and Lark st. was also a tight fit this morning .

Albany,2vkist,drsfmd,19,Wed Feb 11 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"Well, it may help to have an explanation from the other side. As someone who plows snow in a local town, here are the difficulties faced. First is the actual number of hours worked. I just woke up from a 5 hour sleep, which is the longest I've slept since Saturday night. I have close to 60 hours working since Sunday when the storm started, a roughly 80 hour period. That's one problem faced, the actual volume of work to be done with the amount of employees working. Secondly, somewhere like Albany is slightly different in a city setting. You can't actually just go down the street plowing the snow, as there is nowhere to end up putting it without affecting someone else, or pushing it up on the sidewalk. You have to end up taking it away, which requires at a minimum a plow truck, front end loader or backhoe, and multiple dump trucks. This process takes time, and you end up needing far more loaders and dump trucks than the highway department has, considering most of their trucks have salters in the back. Now you have to hire out dump trucks and loaders, and with the amount of snow we have gotten in a small period of time most of these contractors are tough to get ahold of as well, from plowing their own contracts and working in various cities or townships. Then you factor in the sheer volume of streets in somewhere like Albany, and you end up with some areas that wait for a week or better to get cleaned up, if that even happens before more snow. I would bet the whole crew and just about every piece of machinery they have down there is in some neighborhood working day and night to make some progress. None of this factors in the fact that they slice budgets every year, making it harder and harder to get this kind of stuff done. In addition, local tow companies have been so overworked with these storms and only have a limited amount of space to keep the cars towed in, they end up full and waiting for people to come retrieve their cars before they can grab more. Hate to play devil's advocate, and I can't speak for Albany personally, but these are the real circumstances we face on the other side of the snow removal battle. Most of us try our best, but it's been very overwhelming recently.  Edit: Just read that they have towed over 200 cars since Tuesday night, so it seems they are trying to get in position to get this stuff cleaned up.  The sheer number of people who don't adhere to the rules is another hindrance."
Albany,2vkist,faildata,2,Wed Feb 11 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for a great reply.   Let me ask you this then... if the city isn't prepared to deal with a snow emergency 2 days after the storm, why bother to declare one? Let the drivers rest up, and declare the snow emergency a couple of days later, when you're actually prepared to deal with it."
Albany,2vkist,faildata,2,Wed Feb 11 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"That's a great question, and I don't have an answer. I bet it lies in the politics side of things, but I really don't have a great answer for you."
Albany,2vkist,slashingpeak,2,Wed Feb 11 20:58:38 2015 UTC,The only comment I can make here is that the one side of the street doesn't need to be completed until 8PM the next day... they still could be plowing the one side of the street.

Albany,2vkist,flatlineskillz,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:01:31 2015 UTC,The side of my street that everyone moved their cars to at 8pm last night saw no improvement in the amount of snow still taking up space in the street. It's been car free since 8pm tuesday night but I dont think they plowed it since then.
Albany,2vjkk8,murphlr,3,Wed Feb 11 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"Thatcher park. 15-20 minutes outside of downtown. There are miles of trails along with occasional outcroppings through which you can see over the entire mohawk valley straight to the southern Adirondacks (on a clear day, which there are a lot of in February))  If you are willing to drive ~an hour... Katterskill fals in the very northern Catskill Mtns is unbeleivable. I was lucky enough to grow up 20 minutes away... if you want to see something spectacular, check this out in the dead of winter. Snowshoes required. crampons, not.  You will find yourself at the base of a 120' frozen waterfall. Occasionally there are ice climbers honing their skills on this class 4 teraine. I can dig up Pics if requested.  Vroomans nose would be ok... nothing spectacular imo. A short trail leading to an outcropping looking over the schoharie valley..   Locally, Peebles island in North troy.  Flat, and mildly uninteresting.  Of course there is the Pine bush, also relatively flat. (yes there are small rolling hills, but nothing more than 20 - 30 feet of elevation change.  I could point you to some more secluded logging trails in Altamont, not frequently used for hiking, but the locals know about it... and will yeild lots of untracked powder. (caution I know someone who was out on these after our last storm and was post-hole-ing w/o their snowshoes on)  There is a lot of soft powder out there.  how far are you willing to drive? What is your radius?  Have fun!"
Albany,2vjkk8,whitoreo,2,Wed Feb 11 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, stranger, for your detailed response. My radius is about an hour from albany. My girlfriend is not an experienced hiker, she's actually from Africa and has very little exposure to cold weather so I don't wanna go anywhere requiring a lot of time outside. Ive been everywhere else you mentioned besides Katterskill falls, which has been on my to do list. I think that might be the perfect place though, a short walk with a huge payoff."

I interviewed with a similar one about a year ago and it was way different from what their site said. Purely sales jobs mostly, and you make money off of those below you IIRC. I went out on a day thing with the guy and he showed me what he did, had a territory where he would go in and pretend to be their Telecom rep and then sell them bundles for verizon. He claimed it saved them money and made him money so it was a win-win, but he had to lie to get in the door. Very suspect."

Snow tires for any vehicle with wheels larger than 16"", or any truck, are big money.  Sort of funny, since very vehicles are sold with 'small' wheel/tire packages these days, but the tire costs of the larger/more popular sizes has not stabilized with the demand yet."
Albany,2v8nju,Golden_Diablo,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, anyone could if they wanted. I bought a set of 4 near brand new snow tires used for one season on CL for $90 a month ago. With a $65 bill to get them mounted and balanced I'm in for $155 and the car handles like a dream in the snow. I'll get probably 4 winter seasons out of these tires.

Albany,2v8nju,joequin,2,Mon Feb 9 00:01:55 2015 UTC,"Completely off topic, but I'm in the market for snow tires. Do you keep them on all season round or switch them out every year?"
Albany,2v8nju,faildata,6,Mon Feb 9 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"It's best to take them off when winter is over. I usually put mine on after Thanksgiving and take them off around April first. The softer material they are made of  wears quickly in warm weather. If you can, the easiest way to do it is to go somewhere like TireRack.com and order a cheap set of wheels for the snow tires. This keeps your summer wheels nice and make it cheaper to have the tires put on and taken off every year, around $20 instead of $65-80."
Albany,2v8nju,mmiller1188,3,Mon Feb 9 02:10:32 2015 UTC,You CAN run them all season but if you already have a set of all season tires I would recommend switching out accordingly just to get the most life out of both sets.

Albany,2v8nju,shea241,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"If you're keeping your car for a couple winters, you'll break even by buying cheap steel wheels and mounting your snow tires to those. That way you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars getting your tires switched twice a year. You'll come out ahead in 2 or three years."
Albany,2v8nju,MadBliss,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"If you keep a car long enough to replace the tires, then the cost of running snow tires is only the cost of mounting and unmounting each season.  In my mind the cost of that is significantly less than the deductible on my insurance."

Central Avenue and Quail Street   However, I think the best part of this, there are intersections getting cameras that can be seen while standing in front of a police station. They are putting these cameras right in front of where you would expect the police to be the most effective! Since we need fewer police out giving tickets, I guess we can cut back on police staffing too!"
Albany,2v3eqf,Willie365,1 point,Sun Feb 8 14:20:20 2015 UTC,They really need one at Central and Everett Road. The left turn signal will be red for 5 seconds in the rush hour before people stop turning on to Everett to get on the interstate.

I agree with the article, though; the Brevator/Western intersection is unexpected. I'd rather they put one at the entrance to Stuyvesant Plaza. But I'm bitter like that after having one too many close calls there."
Albany,2v3eqf,BarRoomHero88,2,Sun Feb 8 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"Look, running red lights is a stupid fucking thing to do, and is a safety hazard. But how about the cops, and not just in Albany, start ticketing assholes for shit that causes accidents? Turning without a signal, cutting across 3 lanes to make a turn, texting while driving, run through a crosswalk with someone in it...I can go on and on. Its like one a week I see some dumb shit do some unbelievably idiotic thing right in front of the police, and they don't do shit. But don't worry everyone, I got nailed for having a license plate light out the other day!"

But at Faddegon's you can get yourself a Meyer lemon, a pitcher plant, any number of succulents, fancier orchids than phalaenopsis, etc. along with all the common houseplants as well.

Hell, when you realize that Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Doug Drabek, Bernie Williams and Deion Sanders were at Heritage Park... man, the mind boggles.  Unfortunately, the reason the AC Yankees left was because Heritage Park was a hastily-constructed dump that was way way below the standard for minor league ballparks.  And when you figure that they had to build Heritage Park because the previous minor league AA team in Albany was playing at Bleecker Stadium, which barely qualifies as a baseball field in general... the first opportunity the Yankees had to move their franchise, they moved it quickly.

The food's great and the beer selection is fantastic. However, it stinks of stale booze, mixer and bad decisions. You don't go to  The Ruck. You end up at The Ruck."
Albany,2uvrqr,Willie_Main,2,Fri Feb 6 09:45:03 2015 UTC,I actually like the stale booze smell. I find the Ruck's dinginess to be rather charming.

Albany,2uvrqr,irondevil518,6,Fri Feb 6 12:14:23 2015 UTC,Juniors has great wings. I like Across the Street Pub too.  I think the Elbo Room has the best wings in Albany.

Indoor laser tag (Zero Gravity, for instance) Indoor trampoline park (Flight, Sky Zone) Indoor roller-skating (Guptill's, Rollarama, High Rollers) The NYS museum is free (and has a free carousel!) Local libraries have other free museum passes Parasailing in Lake George Boating anywhere really, or renting a boat on Lake George or Sacandaga (plus waterskiing, tubing, wake boarding, whatever!) Swimming! (Grafton Lake, Sacandaga, Lake George, etc.) Hiking... (Grafton, Monro, anywhere in the Adirondacks, any town park walking trail)   So many things to do in the nice weather.

Albany,2utz8r,jayjaywalker3,4,Thu Feb 5 03:21:58 2015 UTC,"If there's a way to recycle those old railroad pathways (which at this time aren't even being used by the railroads and have gone into decay and disrepair), then that's fine by me, whether it's a bike path or a walking trail.  The section of the Albany County Rail Trail that goes from Delmar to the Toll Gate in Slingerlands is a nice, comforting walk.  At some point in time, the entire 9-mile stretch from the Port of Albany to Voorheesville (the old Albany and Susquehanna line from the 1850's) will open to the public - as soon as they get that one rail bridge that spans the Normanskill repaired and upgraded."
Albany,2utz8r,threedice,0,Thu Feb 5 14:20:34 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly-- it's a great use of the abandoned railway beds. I don't think that it should be extended into downtown streets though. As someone else already pointed out, there's far too much traffic congestion and serious proximate parking issues already. Taking a lane of traffic (or parking) and making it a bike lane will only exacerbate the problem."
Albany,2utz8r,drsfmd,2,Thu Feb 5 14:32:57 2015 UTC,As opposed to cyclists who think that the sidewalk is their lane?  Dealt with that before.
Albany,2utz8r,threedice,3,Thu Feb 5 15:40:56 2015 UTC,"I don't like that either.   Problem is, when they make bike lanes, people on bicycles don't stay in them, and aren't mindful of automobile traffic behind them-- not looking before they suddenly swing out into traffic or want to make a left turn and cut across traffic, expecting cars to move around them."
Albany,2utz8r,drsfmd,3,Thu Feb 5 15:47:38 2015 UTC,Care to take the over/under on the number of bicyclists killed by cars?
Albany,2utz8r,drsfmd,5,Thu Feb 5 14:45:07 2015 UTC,Dedicated bus rapid transit lanes/lines would do a hell of a lot more good than bike lanes on South Pearl and Madison.  Better transit has a much better chance of attracting employers and people than bike lanes.
Albany,2utz8r,concretebootstraps,3,Thu Feb 5 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"What about the people who like to bike? Especially those living to Guilderland and try to go to downtown on their bikes.

Albany,2urhui,timmy6591,3,Wed Feb 4 16:41:31 2015 UTC,"One of the owners died and the family decided to sell up. Part of the reason it was so successful was the combination of it being a family business (so they really cared) and the crazy good recipes (it was a destination meal).  It's pretty unlikely that a regular diner like Bobs or 76 could survive there because that's just regular diner fare and the family retained the rights to the recipes.   So you'd need a crazy good chef, a staff that cares like it's their own business eventhough it's 5am, and some amazon food to get people continuously coming. That's tough!   It makes me really miss MAD and regret not going there more..."

Albany,2urgco,dsolimeno93,6,Wed Feb 4 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"The samplings are not a full beer at the beer summit, the glass they give is truly a sampling glass, it probably holds around 3oz.  The point is to try as many as you can, if they were pouring full pints everybody would be drunk and full within the hour.  Also last year they gave you ""sampling tickets"" but it is just a formality, the vendors were instructed not to collect them.  Some beer tastings actually collect them... and that is super lame.  This one is cool, we are going back for the 3rd year."

Albany,2urgco,Turrrrrr,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on who's filling it/which event.  Last year I went to some of ADK brewery's events in Saratoga for beer week, and they gave away full pint glasses.  I also went to the gluten-free night at Circus Cafe with my friend who has Celiac's, and there were no free sampling glasses, you just bought beer from the bar, and it was like a guest tap."
Albany,2urgco,yodaboy64,1 point,Wed Feb 4 16:13:28 2015 UTC,I did the beer summit the past two years...yea it's a 3 oz sampling glass but I've never left there not on the verge of a blackout because there are so many beers and so many vendors.
Albany,2urgco,daedalusesq,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"These guys know what they are doing when it comes to beer festivals. I have been to a lot of beer festivals (like 30+) and these are some of my favorites.  You get a nice 3-4oz sampling glass, but the whole event is all you can drink, so it would be stupid to give away full glasses. Plus there aren't really any lines so you can drink as much & as fast as you want. Plus there are so many different beers it would be impossible to try them all."

Albany,2ukruv,mrlint,3,Tue Feb 3 00:00:31 2015 UTC,Mine was 'plowed' once at around noon this morning.   And by plowed I mean they plowed about a single car lane in the middle of the road. The (extremely steep) hill has apparently been considered a lost cause because it's still covered.   I've lived in my apartment for two winters now. I'm used to them not plowing the area around where I live effectively until the parking ban starts. But god damn is it still not stupid as all hell.
Albany,2ukruv,lilypaint,3,Tue Feb 3 01:18:29 2015 UTC,Our neighbor who works for a utility just had a friend of his  plow the rest of our street...I thanked him profusely.
Albany,2ukruv,CertifiableX,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:50:44 2015 UTC,Ours seemed to wait until the snow stopped to clear the equivalent of one lane of the road. The parking lot is still completely covered.

Albany,2ujg00,baloneysandwich,3,Mon Feb 2 21:22:37 2015 UTC,"They have those ridey things in Delmar/ Bethlehem, those things are awesome!"
Albany,2ujg00,irondevil518,6,Tue Feb 3 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"To be fair, today is a pretty bad snow storm. We've had almost 12 straight hours of heavy snow. I'm from Syracuse originally and I'm not sure it, Buffalo, or even Oswego, could do much to keep everything clear in a storm like this. Sometimes it's just going to suck to be out and about."
Albany,2ujg00,UpSNYer,6,Mon Feb 2 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"SUNY Oswego grad here. The city made absolutely zero effort to clear the streets or clean up after a storm. Even worse, the police would still have the nerve to ticket and tow you if you weren't parked just right."
Albany,2ujg00,Willie_Main,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:54:00 2015 UTC,No doubt.
Albany,2ujg00,unclejunk,3,Mon Feb 2 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"I believe the city does have some sidewalk equipment and they use it when we get a lot of snow.  I've seen tracks from small equipment (skidsteer/small tractor size) when they remove huge mounds of snow from the street corners/intersections.   You really have to expect snow on sidewalks when you're walking in the middle of a 12-hour snow storm though.  The city should be ticketing people that don't clear the snow after a reasonable amount of time.  They are heartless with the parking tickets, I don't understand why they are so easy on people who don't follow the rest of the rules."
Albany,2ujg00,KoodooKooskoos,5,Tue Feb 3 13:37:30 2015 UTC,"This is something continually pisses me off. That said, a sidewalk is a very weird legal domain. On the one hand, you can't do anything to it because it's public access, but on the other, you as the owner of the house in front of the sidewalk, have to keep it clear.  Most people's thinking is, ""if I don't own the damn thing, then why do I have to clear it?"" My answer is that it's this simple: You live in a society. It doesn't matter what kind of society live in, only that you do. And a society isn't just an place where you have your stuff and I have my stuff, and as long keep our to ourselves, we can live close to each other and forget about minor civic duties. Paying taxes isn't your only active civic duty. This thing only works because we work together, and part of working together is doing small things like shoveling your sidewalk.  Just be grateful for that you're a member of a species that's socially complex enough to create a civilization in which you can partake in fellow human activities and even buy or rent land property that's protected by the agreed upon laws of your fellow members. Show that gratefulness by getting out and doing the simple things.  I will say that if there are people who through some occupational disability or otherwise, can't shovel for themselves, and have nobody to do it for them, the city should offer a free program to opt into for having your sidewalk shoveled."
Albany,2ujg00,UltimateUltamate,2,Mon Feb 2 23:03:15 2015 UTC,Ronald Reagan is turning over in his grave right now you commie bastard ;-)
Albany,2ujg00,quantum-mechanic,4,Tue Feb 3 13:19:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you say lots of nice things but miss the point.  I can't do shit to the sidewalk (put a sign up, whatever) because its public space.  Even if its directly outside my house and assholes want to stare in my windows there's not a whole lot I can do.   Cities maintain the sidewalks in all other ways:  pick up the trash, fix the concrete, etc.   But in snow, why all the sudden it falls on the adjacent proprety owner?"
Albany,2ujg00,KoodooKooskoos,0,Tue Feb 3 02:30:44 2015 UTC,"Well, to touch on those specific examples:  -Picking up trash is a quick, do-and-go activity, and it's done once a week. Shoveling snow is not quick, and even with machines, not nearly as quick as picking up trash. On a multi-day storm, you'd have to keep paying to send people out. There's probably not much in the way of resources for keeping off to the side to predict those things. The city already takes care of the roads, a spendy bit to begin with. Plus, they can't take responsibility for where the shoveled snow goes.  -Fixing concrete is something that needs to be done and is costly. They shouldn't expect you to pay up for that kind of cost, and it's a project that isn't a regular occurrence or weather-dependent, so they can actually budget to send people to take care of those projects on a ""when-we-can-do-it"" basis. Taking care of snow is not a ""when-we-can-do-it"" basis. It needs to be done essentially the same day, otherwise it's a pedestrian hazard. Now, we could point out that snow is just as random as concrete damage, but the difference is that concrete is a targeted issue. It happens in one small place that requires just a core construction team. When snow happens, it happens everywhere.  So, yeah, there's just little in the way of logistics for managing the manpower to take care of sidewalks."
Albany,2ujg00,drsfmd,6,Tue Feb 3 06:23:30 2015 UTC,On Friday I paid a $3200 property tax bill. I can't afford another penny. Buying new equipment and paying city employees to snow blow private sidewalks would cost an absolute fortune and that cost would have to be absorbed by those who pay property taxes.
Albany,2ujg00,Sir_Leminid,3,Mon Feb 2 19:29:29 2015 UTC,A very fair point.

Albany,2ujg00,Learned_Response,4,Tue Feb 3 05:30:56 2015 UTC,"How many miles of road does the city maintain, and how much does that cost? (To say nothing of thousands of on-street parking spots...) Pedestrians deserve - no, require - a proportionate level of service, and their mobility should not be treated as a luxury.  (FTR, I don't particularly care whether it is the city or property owners who clear the sidewalks, as long as they are consistently passable - which, under the city's current rules and enforcement, they are not.)"
Albany,2ujg00,drsfmd,-1,Tue Feb 3 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know the answer to your question, but considering that almost all streets have sidewalks on both sides of the street, the amount of sidewalk would be slightly less than double the amount of road. No small undertaking."
Albany,2ujg00,Learned_Response,0,Tue Feb 3 14:17:23 2015 UTC,Honestly I would be fine with just Western/Washington/Central.  Side streets doesn't seem necessary.
Albany,2ujg00,drsfmd,3,Tue Feb 3 23:50:33 2015 UTC,"I would at least like to see a proposal. I drive, but the last thing I need is to run someone over who is using the streets on the days with the worst conditions because they're the only thing plowed.   We're talking a couple of machines and labor on maybe 14 days a year. I can't imagine taxes raising up more than a dollar or two per property annually."
Albany,2ujg00,uno_dos_tres,-1,Tue Feb 3 02:28:48 2015 UTC,"We're talking a couple of machines and labor on maybe 14 days a year. I can't imagine taxes raising up more than a dollar or two per property annually.    How many hundreds of miles of sidewalks are there in the city of Albany?   Are you suggesting that only certain sidewalks be snowblown by the city? If so, I object-- why should the owner of that property benefit (in the form of ""free"" snowblowing) for failing to do what they were supposed to do anyway? And how is that fair to the rest of us, who pay exorbitant taxes-- some of the highest in the country-- and don't benefit from ""free"" snowblowing.   How about we use some of our existing overpaid city employees to walk the streets and ticket property owners who have failed to remove snow within 24 hours of the end of a storm?   Moreover, if it's only 14 days a year as you suggest, why on earth would we cow tow to pedestrians who are outnumbered 100:1. Should we also make sure the roads are extra clear for the idiots who want to ride a bicycle on a snowy day?"
Albany,2ujg00,IwishIwasWitty,3,Tue Feb 3 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"I am all for ticketing homeowners who haven't shoveled their walks, but you don't know what you're talking about if you think city workers are overpaid. I used to work for DGS and the payscale isnt that great.   I would go with what they do now and focus on streets where the most pedestrians are, just like the city plows the busiest roads first. I have a city-owned alley way. I have yet to see anyone who uses it get upset that the alley is plowed after Central or Washington Ave. I would have no problem with the city focusing on main roads or streets where there are more pedestrians.   The neighborhood I live in has several buildings that are owned by a non-profit. Their maintenance guy uses a snowblower to clear their sidewalks, and in the process it's just as easy for him to do the entire neighborhood. He doesn't scrape it down to the concrete or add salt, but it makes them passable. He does the whole neighborhood in about an hour. This could be something where the city works with NAs and BIDs to find funding and/or private companies to plow the sidewalks. You don't need every homeowner to buy in to make it work and you could partially fund it with revenue from tickets from property owners who don't shovel. A proposal could discover creative ways to get it done.   As far as any system being unfair, welcome to the reality of living amongst other people."
Albany,2ujg00,Learned_Response,2,Tue Feb 3 14:33:27 2015 UTC,"As far as any system being unfair, welcome to the reality of living amongst other people.   The tax burden-- especially for those living west of Manning-- is crushing the city. We're mere baby steps from being the next Detroit, where all who can afford to do so leave the city for the suburbs because the city has gotten too expensive.   As far as city employee pay... in 2013 there were more than 150 city employees who made more than $100,000.  Moreover, why does a city of 98,000 people need 1,200 city employees? No wonder we're broke!"

Albany,2ujg00,drsfmd,2,Wed Feb 4 14:52:11 2015 UTC,"We are moving in the right direction. Have you read this piece? We need a conversation about how the city is funded and it's good to see these kinds of questions being asked. Hopefully it goes somewhere.   As a resident of the South End, I am constantly hearing complaints about taxes being so high up town. Here, they are low largely due to the fact that we are swamped with shelters and half-way houses no one wants to live near. A more macro-solution would help instead of city residents fighting over a smaller pie."
Albany,2ujg00,Christian_Kong,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"I actually have read that piece. I don't think there's any real solution there.   Albany needs to cut its spending dramatically. We don't need 1200 city employees. Hell, for a city our size, we don't need HALF that number.  As far as ""uptown taxes"", we are dramatically over assessed, and to add insult to injury, the city even acknowledges your ""full market value"" (again, highly inflated) and assesses you at 109% of that amount for tax purposes. How is it possibly legal to base taxes on more than 100% of the property value? Moreover, appealing to the hearing board does no good-- they simply won't lower the assessed value.   In my own case, I make a good living, but I'm literally being taxed out of my home. When I bought my house in 1999, my combined school and property taxes were about $1700 a year. In 15 years, that number has swelled to almost $8000 a year-- that's a not insignificant percentage of my post-tax income.   By the way, though I'm not aware of any homeless shelters, there are at least a few halfway houses in the area."
Albany,2ujg00,ironmanxl1,9,Wed Feb 4 15:12:20 2015 UTC,There is also an app. See-click-fix.  Take s photo and it will report the problem to the city.  Please report them.  Weeks after a snow storm you see people walking in the street because the commercial businesses haven't cleared the sidewalks on central.  This is bullshit.
Albany,2ujg00,Christian_Kong,10,Mon Feb 2 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Property owners have 24 hours from the end of the storm to remove snow. Hell, I had finished snowblowing my own driveway this morning before the city plow came down my street."
Albany,2ujg00,carpy22,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"In situations like this you would be surprised how hard it is to maintain a sidewalk.   I own on a corner of a fairly busy main/side street intersection(ends up being 3 property lengths). I snowblew once early during the storm, then late. I wake up this morning and everyone who has a car wildly throws their snow, much of it going past the grass area into the sidewalk. I shovel again to the concrete(wasnt really possible day of the snow.) I come back from work 10 hours later and once again the sidewalk is filled with dirty street snow. This will go on for days."
Albany,2ujg00,cybermage,3,Mon Feb 2 19:47:25 2015 UTC,Snowy/Icy sidewalks can be reported via seeclickfix to the city. Landlords have 24 hours from the end of the storm to create a walkable path. http://seeclickfix.com/albany_2

Albany,2ujg00,limbsofjesus,6,Mon Feb 2 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"The fact that it's the capital is actually part of the problem. Albany gets $0 in property tax from all those state offices. They get $0 in property tax from the colleges, hospitals  and churches too.   What about sales taxes? Well, all the big retail is in the suburbs.   I read recently that at the rate Albany is maintaining its roads, streets have to last 100 years between repavings."
Albany,2ujg00,h3r4ld,-1,Mon Feb 2 19:52:15 2015 UTC,Albany gets $0 in property tax from all those state offices.   Not true. Check out the citys budget  The city receives a PILOT worth like 20 million dollars annually....   The city also receives 17 million dollars in state aid.
Albany,2ujbrz,couchisland,5,Mon Feb 2 17:42:53 2015 UTC,"Why don't they institute these when they know a storm is coming for the period of the storm?   I live out of the area now and I'm staggered by how much better plowed the streets are- and how much less hassle it is- when snow emergencies/parking are declared during the storm, not after. Plus then they don't have to make additional passes after the storm beyond maybe 1 per road."
Albany,2ujbrz,ErynSMA,4,Mon Feb 2 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"Albany is pretty inept at plowing.  They didn't plow my street till noon today.  When they did they basically made one pass through, just enough to make 1 lane for a car."

If you will be over in Scotia/Glenville/Schenectady at all, it may be a convenient option. If you are staying close to Albany proper,  it's probably a little far out.   I'd definitely recommend them.

Albany,2tytxe,midnyghtchilde,6,Wed Jan 28 15:30:30 2015 UTC,"I can chime in for the vet. I take my hound to Albany County Vet for Dr. Jarvis, and I like her. She also took care of my guinea pig a few years ago. I have friends who also really like Village Vet in Altamont, and i've heard good things about Shaker vet up on Wolf Rd too.  It's a big area though, and these are all in the Colonie/Guilderland/Altamont area so I don't know where you're looking at being.  Can't help with rentals, can say I lived at Regency park apartments in Guilderland and we really like them. Little pricey but nice place (They just updated the buildings after we left too I noticed) and good office and maintenance staff.   There's a bunch of local lost and found pet FB pages - 518Pets and Steve Caporrizzo's Pet connection page come to mind."

Albany,2tytxe,mario_meowingham,9,Wed Jan 28 23:22:29 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest problems with rentals up here is absentee landlords. Make sure you ask them specifically if they are actually near the property at all. If they aren't, be sure they have someone local in case of issues with the property.  My landlord lives in Albany, but I still barely ever see him. He's got a bunch of Section 8 welfare families living in this building. None of them know how to take out trash, not litter, or pick up after themselves at all.   So I guess either way it's a crap shoot."

I'm a landlord and a transplant myself, but I don't have anything available right now. I can try to point you in the right direction. Albany rental is a bit unusual compared to other Northeastern cities, and neighborhoods can vary greatly block by block."
Albany,2tytxe,wolvestooth,3,Wed Jan 28 15:37:56 2015 UTC,"I've tried craigslist a thousand times. Everyone I talk to is either super shady, doesn't get back to me, or it's a scam. I seriously haven't found one person who's been legit. It's insane. I can't count how many missionaries want to rent me their house because they're going to Africa for two years.   I pay $1,350 in rent right now. Obviously cheaper would be better but I understand better neighborhoods and things of that nature would cost more. So I'd like to not go over what I'm paying now unless it was realllly worth it. And as for neighborhoods, no idea. I just don't want to slum it and have to be worried about my property while I'm gone. I just want a safe place to sleep that has heat. Other than that I can make due with whatever."
Albany,2tytxe,Bubblilly,4,Wed Jan 28 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"1350 is enough for a three bedroom in albany in a decent neighborhood. What kind of apartment do you want? Roommates? One bedroom? Will you have a car? The bus service in albany is decent, but it's largely a driving city. Will you need to be in walking distance to anywhere?"
Albany,2tytxe,donamh,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:53:59 2015 UTC,"I just want something quiet. No roommates, haha. Mine is driving me insane right now but I love him.  Good dude. I have a truck and a motorcycle. Walking distance doesn't matter.   My concerns lie mostly with my pets. I just want them to be happy and have a place to play a bit outside. If that means a dog park in the place I live or if I have to walk them, fine. I just want them to be comfortable."
Albany,2tytxe,bigvicproton,2,Wed Jan 28 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"Here is my recommendation for neighborhood, based off your budget, need for parking, and many places are pet friendly. It's also walking distance to Washington Park. You could easily afford a two bedroom, and have a guest bed room or a home office. These are mostly two family frame style houses, and they typically all have the same layout, so you won't see too much diversity, but they do vary in quality. I would recommend staying near New Scotland. I used to live just off of it, and it was easy walking distance to restaurants and bars. If you like beer, definitely check out Beer Belly. You can try going a little north, but the places aren't as well maintained, and the neighborhood becomes a lot more loud college kids. If you do want to check out places near Madison, I would stay east of Ontario or Quail, by South Lake. I wouldn't go north of Madison, however. Typical three bedroom in this area is 1100 to 1150. Try to get a place with off street parking. It's worth it."
Albany,2tytxe,bigvicproton,2,Thu Jan 29 05:28:33 2015 UTC,I just moved to Albany a couple weeks ago and had a terrible time with Craigslist as well. I ended up getting the info on a landlord of a fellow grad student and went with that. His stuff is mostly aimed at people with a limited budget (mostly other grad students in the building) and there is a very strict no pets policy so I can't help you there.  E: I wonder if the CL problems have a lot to do with the time of year it is? Not exactly moving season.

If you were trying to sell something, people could be flaky, but apartment hunting was pretty legit. I found 3 apartments through it. Here, I had people attempt bait and switches, not get back to me, schedule an apt viewing and then not show up, etc. I just chalked it up to the time of year, since usually I was hunting in the summer when a ton of leases start."
Albany,2tytxe,SonicPhoenix,2,Wed Jan 28 23:36:17 2015 UTC,"im pretty close to denver colorado so that probably has a lot to do with it. super cool place but once you get into the weird and bad, it goes to the 10 of those."
Albany,2tytxe,SonicPhoenix,2,Wed Jan 28 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the best non-commercial apartments in Albany don't advertise. They are 2 and 3 unit hinges and many owner occupied. We just put signs out when we have an opening and never have a problem renting to good tenants.   Stonehenge is the best complex on the city. Good location. Nice apartments. Good management. Best places are on either side of New Scotland Ave between Sage College and St Peter's Hospital. But you won't find ads for these places. You have to drive around.  Don't listen to the suburban crowd either. Living in Albany is friendly, fun, safe and interesting. Our suburbs are straight up Generica, just like every place else. You could be 15 minutes out of any city. Traffic is worse in the suburbs too, because there was little to no planning, just growth.

Albany,2tytxe,carpy22,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"For the price there it should probably come with a deadbolt.  This place looks like it has a deadbolt, its probably not much more expensive and you get a whole house.  http://albany.craigslist.org/apa/4865473753.html  I have a dog and it was difficult to find an apartment that allowed him, so I rented a whole house in Troy."
Albany,2tytxe,Super_Frez,2,Fri Jan 30 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"Agree with /u/bigvicproton. I've lived in downtown (the ""bad"" part of) Cohoes my whole life aside from 4 years away at school, and never had problems. The mills are super nice (though expensive), and it can be boring here but the area is nice because it's close to everything. 10-20 mins gets you to Albany, Clifton Park, Troy, Schenectady, all the local malls, and a million other places.  Don't count out places like Troy that people say aren't nice. Downtown Troy has been making a huge resurgence and it's really quite nice now. I prefer it to Albany/Saratoga as far as stuff to do on weekends as a 20-something."

Albany,2tytxe,_vargas_,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:08:01 2015 UTC,Call and ask.  I'm pretty sure there were at least a few people with dogs at Presidential Estates and they have a doggie poop bag dispenser on one of the sidewalks where people walk their dogs all the time.
Albany,2tytxe,agingbythesecond,2,Wed Jan 28 22:31:01 2015 UTC,i've called a ton of places today. half the places listed as dog friendly are saying they don't take dogs and asking me what website is saying that so they can take it down.

They won't be groomed trails, but it is a nice open spot to explore. Also keep in mind that during the off season people walk dogs off leash there, but rarely do they venture off the main cart trails into the woods.  I'm sure Thatcher park gets xc ski traffic as well. I can't say I'm familiar with places actually grooming ski trails around here though."

Albany,2tn5bi,bbev913,2,Sun Jan 25 20:26:40 2015 UTC,"Hello I've studied urban planning a little bit. Albany is based more around driving and public transportation. You can tell this because there a wider roads, low lying buildings not placed well around the sidewalks, and developed traffic systems more so than New York City which is based off of higher developed pedestrian systems. That is why there are less people walking in Albany."
Albany,2tn5bi,cjfinn3r,2,Sun Jan 25 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"That would be an issue for a fixed location establishment. But you perfectly described the fact that food trucks have two clienteles. Yes pedestrian traffic is great, but a food truck can head out to an office park and setup in their lot. Or head to St. Peters or any other area that has even a temporary population bump. Go to the people. Cater. Find the crowds."
Albany,2tn5bi,Mabepossibly,2,Mon Jan 26 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"Another major hold back is how spread the region is.  NYC, Boston, etc all have a big population base under one dept of health authority.  In Albany they have 3-6 different ones to deal with if they want to move between the population centers of Albany, Schenectady, Troy and Saratoga.    Personally I would be a big fan of Albany, Schenectady, Troy and all the smaller towns in between consolidating into one municipality.  If run correctly it would consolidate a lot of redundancy and make regional businesses like food trucks much easier."

Albany,2tnelh,BMc0828,1 point,Sun Jan 25 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"Most dealerships in the area have their own detailing departments so try referring to a car dealership the same make as your automobile.  Dealers will also have the best cleaning products, equipment, touch up paints, interior/carpet paints, steam cleaning, etc. However this will cost you $100+ in most shops.  There is a place on Railroad Ave called Kendall's Auto Detailing that has solid detailing crew. Local dealers and independent sellers also use this shop on a regular basis so it may be worth looking into and may be a few dollars cheaper."

He seems to be hated around the Capital Region but it seems to me that's proof positive that his marketing campaigns do their job. Many people that claim to have gotten ripped off or aren't pleased with the deal they got went about it in the EXACT wrong fashion, by going in and giving out a figure they are comfortable with per month instead of actually having them give you legit numbers for the various parts of the deal.

Shen is a great school system with tons of opportunity for your child to really shine and pick classes that cater to his/her interests once they reach middle/high school. Also ittl knock off at least 10 minutes of commute for both you and your husband each way each day! Clifton Park has everything you could ever want, from a huge Walmart to a newly redesigned mall. Personally I've noticed a lot better people in Clifton Park than with Ballston Spa"
Albany,2th39h,Phreakiture,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:54:06 2015 UTC,"Well, welcome to the area.  A close friend went to BHBL, and speaks very highly of it.  Shen also has a good reputation, but I don't have any first- or second-order knowledge of it.  I went to Doane-Stuart (private school) so I don't know the full score firsthand.  Aside from schools, be aware that both of you are going to be dealing with some of the worst traffic our area has to offer.  I think it will not be as bad as I've experienced in Boston, but from Burnt Hills, one of you will be coming down I-87 or US-9 and the other down NY-50 or NY-146, and these all get super congested southbound in the mornings and northbound in the evenings."
Albany,2th39h,adipose_rex1,-1,Sat Jan 24 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"There is no possible way it's as bad as Boston. My 17 mile commute takes me an hour and a half, minimum. And then $35 a day to park. So I end up taking public transport for $200/month but it takes about the same amount of time.   I'll be taking rt 50 down to Schenectady- I'm not positive which way my husband will be going but probably down 87.   I suppose the alternative would be to live south and commute north? I don't see any way to avoid the traffic.   Where was your school? Did you like the private school? It's another option we've been thinking about..."
Albany,2th39h,zeezl,2,Sat Jan 24 13:09:20 2015 UTC,"Moved here last year from CT, and my job took me all over Mass, RI, CT, and NY. The traffic here is not bad at all, especially compared to Boston and greater New York City. We ended up settling in Delmar because we read so many great things about the Bethlehem schools and there are a lot of young families. It is an easy commute into Albany but maybe a little further into Schenectady. I like it because it is south of the cities and easy access to 87, or 90. Housing prices here are cheaper than Boston too, just be prepared for the higher taxes."

Albany,2th39h,jeffersonbible,1 point,Sat Jan 24 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"I rent in Delmar and I agree with all the points made thus far. I know any number of Albany teachers who moved here with their families. The commute out to Schenectady will suck a bit, but nothing compared to Boston traffic.  And I have family in VT, so when I moved from Cohoes to Delmar, I did regret the few extra minutes added to the trip. However it is more than balanced out by all the time saved commuting every day and if you add 87 into that equation, you'll be saving yourself a world of pain.  PS I also know many Albany teachers who have their kids in great Albany schools, just be aware that many of the best programs are entered through a lottery and there are long waiting lists. PM me if you want more info."
Albany,2th39h,Phreakiture,2,Sun Jan 25 17:09:14 2015 UTC,I'm glad the rental in burnt hills will give us a feel for the traffic going south before we are completely committed do the area.

As for Doane-Stuart, I honestly didn't appreciate the school when I was there as much as I appreciate it after the fact, and I appreciated it more when I took a two-year hiatus attending Ravena.    I should probably mention that this info is going to be kind of old; I graduated from there in 1989.  DS had at the time (and probably still does) a 100% graduation rate and about a 95% rate of students advancing on to college.  Class sizes are very small, especially in advanced subjects, so, for instance, there were 4 students in my Latin class, and 4 students in my Physics class.  I think the largest classes I had in high school had maybe 25 students.  DS is an ecumenical Christian school, because it formed when an Episcopal school merged with a Catholic school.  They don't push doctrine very much, and welcome all faiths and denominations.  When I was there, there were a few students who were not Christians, including some who were not any kind of Abrahamic faith.  Interestingly enough, the school also provides space for a local Buddhist group to meet, so when I say they don't push the doctrine, I mean they don't push the doctrine.    I mentioned a two-year hiatus.  I went to Ravena for 7th and 8th grades, and found that I was studying the same material there as I had been studying at DS in 5th and 6th grades, so yes, the school is academically advanced.  DS has a very minimal focus on sports.  They do not have a football field.  They do, however, have a Soccer pitch, and I played soccer in 9th grade.    I have two co-workers who have kids attending DS, and they rave about it.  I can't really speak to the campus or facilities, because they moved the school about four or five years ago, and I haven't been to the new one."

There is plenty of softball to be had. Im not too sure where to look but people usually put teams together with their jobs, frats, schools, etc. Im not sure exactly sure what the league names are but Im sure a little of googling will get you on your way.  I cant think of any other of the sports you mentioned. Im an ice hockey guy and there is a fair amount of figure skating, speed skating and hockey groups if you are into that."
Albany,2tfk93,Beeb294,1 point,Fri Jan 23 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"Im an ice hockey guy and there is a fair amount of figure skating, speed skating and hockey groups if you are into that.   What kind of open hockey is around here? I'm just getting involved (I've watched hockey ever since I was a kid) and I want to try drop-in somewhere.   I saw that Albany County Hockey Facility has drop-in, but I'm wondering if there are others for better schedule options- I looked online but couldn't really find anything useful. Also how do the players around here take to newbies? I'm working on my skills, but I can't skate well, and I don't want to go in and piss people off when I suck.   Thanks in advance,  I know that's a when lot of questions."
Albany,2tfk93,Christian_Kong,3,Sat Jan 24 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately during hockey season other than ACHF not much drop in goes on. They have a Sunday(8:45-10:15) night pick up that is pretty good. Most of the ice around here is used for mens league, high school and freestyle/figure skating during the hockey season. A lot more ice opens up after the season is over and more pick up is added.  There are 5 rinks I can think of at the moment:ACHF(closed May-June), Knickerbacker Ice Arena, Bethlahem YMCA(ice from Sept-April I think), Schenectady County rink and Clifton Park ice facility. Google them for schedules and keep an eye out for pickup. Bethlahem and Saratoga park have outdoor ice with nets, so you may find people depending on the time/day.  As far as players go I'd say its a mixed bag depending on the game. Some people are dicks, others arent. If you piss people off its likely their problem not yours. There is plenty of stick and puck time to be had in this area if you want to work on your game."
Albany,2tfk93,Beeb294,1 point,Sat Jan 24 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Thanks for the info.   I was hoping for more drop-in because playing that late on a Sunday isn't great (I have to be up early for work, so I'm usually in bed by 10). I hadn't seen anything else, but I didn't know if there was things happening that only people ""in the know"" had access to.   Looks like I'm going to be doing a good bit of stick n puck for a while.    Thanks fir the info!"

I went to First Prize Center after this and shot a full music video there because it was so much more diverse. Graffiti from 1969 I shit you not. There were abandoned apartments, classrooms, factory and office space. Lots of magazines and VHS tapes. Hell, to get in we had to break a garage door and crawl through a hole in the wall that led to a small bathroom - first story in almost complete darkness."

A roommate from years ago recognized the post and was able to provide some pictures of his old roommate who was also named Jason, and the age/time frame matched up.  With these new pictures the case blew up again a little... which led to a woman on facebook recognizing the man in the newest pictures as her son (Jason Callahan) who she hadn't heard from since 95.  Now it has been confirmed that the ""roommate"" Jason, and Jason Callahan are the same person.  Since then, mom has officially listed her son as missing, and the medical examiner is now comparing DNA from the grateful doe to Jason Callahan.  Looks like a really good possibility but we are looking at about 3mos for actual confirmation.  This is the only solid lead in this case in 20 years and it is really exciting for those of us who have been following it for this long."

The only things that thrive are Pawn Shops and Check Cashing /Payday Loan places.   Rotterdam Square is the closest mall to the casino, that's true. But there's nothing in that mall people don't have access to at home.   Now, if they converted it into an outlet mall ... there's some synergy.

Albany,2smpwm,cybermage,3,Fri Jan 16 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"Consider the Apple Store at Crossgates. I can't tell you the number of times I've wished it had an outside entrance. If you go to the mall for one store, it can be a substantial hike from where you get to park.  Clifton Park commons was Clifton Country Mall. They kept the food court and the movie theatre and just under 50% of the original enclosed space and tore down the rest. They then built Strip malls around the outside of their original footprint and put the parking in the center where the torn down section was. It's actually pretty nice. J.C. Penney's was an anchor for the Mall, now it sits by itself as a stand-alone store. Many of the ""inside"" stores now have external entrances as well. Except where the theatre is, you can typically park within a row of the door you want to enter."

Then I get classical with 89.1 and some old 40's-60's with 900am Moon radio.  Would love to have more than Pop and Country  103.9 is the same alternative
Albany,2sksrc,Vernacularry,1 point,Mon Jan 19 16:32:18 2015 UTC,It just switched a couple of days ago.

Albany,2sbnz0,marciepry,5,Tue Jan 13 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"A couple ideas-  SUNY Albany student mass 6:45pm Sunday's in the Campus Center. Lots of students but a community presence too. Parking may be tricky but that would be a matter of looking up visitor parking on albany.edu I attended this mass in college and found it very relevant to college aged people, and a bit more down to earth.  http://www.albanyinterfaithcenter.org/community/ualbany-newman-association-catholic-campus-ministry/  I can't speak from personal experience, but here's a list of masses at the College of Saint Rose. http://www.strose.edu/campuslife/spiritual_life/catholicmasses  Unlike SUNY, parking would be on the street (unless there's a non-student/community church lot, IDK) and therefore a bit simpler than the giant SUNY campus.  Lastly, to second another commenter, I would personally recommend St. Kateri in Schenectady, but more specifically because of the pastor, Fr Bob.  He used be the campus minister at SUNY Albany when I was in school and he is the most wonderful priest I have ever met.  He absolutely has a knack for reaching youth, and I'm sure if you speak with him he can advise on a particular mass/time.  He is so nice and awesome!  Not sure where in the Albany area you're located, but Schenectady is closer than it sounds- a quick hop on the Thruway and you're there.  http://stkateriparish.org/page/pastor"

I made the mistake of going to an event that one of their family's hosted and could not get out of there soon enough.

Albany,2sbnz0,desiktar,1 point,Wed Jan 14 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Somewhat related, what is it about Catholics (like us), that they're always able to sniff out a church service that just doesn't settle quite right (my nice way of calling something cult-ish, I guess).  A couple of my non-catholic religious friends attend praise-y/save-y places like this and are unphased/totally into it/not weirded out by any of it.  Not sayin' it's BAD, just not for me. I guess I'm just conditioned to straight-forward-by-the-book catholic style mass. Anything out side of that (the first time I heard a priest tell a joke at a wedding I was like ""whoa"") I just get weird vibes about.  Circling back to an earlier comment of mine in this thread, Fr. Bob is a bit outside the box for a standard by the book priest, but he still brings it home for me."
Albany,2sbnz0,frickonature,3,Thu Jan 15 04:49:29 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent question, one that I've tried to answer but my vocabulary just comes up short. My fiance was raised in a federal church, that is a church with many different congregations- mostly Presbyterian. She was the one who wanted to try Terra Nova, and initially she thought it was great. I struggled to explain to her why I thought Terra Nova was an awful place to go, what she saw and ""fun"" and ""involved"" I saw as something closer to brainwashing and blindness. Terra Nova is a place full of people who fall to the ground during prayers because they're overcome by the lord (this is not a joke, more than one person described this happening to them). It's also a place full of people who seemingly have weekly challenges to their faith, challenges that make them question everything...which brings us back to the collapsing to the ground when they re-re-reaffirm their connection to God.  How I eventually explained my feelings to my fiance was like this: I'm not a serious Catholic, and most of the Catholics I know are not either. Church, to me, is a traditional/social thing to do, but that most of us are ""in on the joke"", that we don't take anything that happens in church too seriously. Just kinda roll with it, stand, sit, kneel, shake some hands, take Communion, and get out to watch the football games. But, Terra Nova people are not like this, they're not ""in on the joke"". What is being preached is of the utmost importance, Satan IS lurking in the shadows, he is constantly trying to undermine your faith, and your only hope for safety is in the arms of the church and God. To a Catholic who comes from a very moderate background, the techniques of Terra Nova are painted up to be accepting when really they're hiding some old school fire and brimstone philosophies. They've bought into it completely and wear it on their sleeve all week long.   I also want to stress that I'm not trying to insult anyone's faith, or tout Catholicism as the moderate center of the universe. Talking religion on the internet is always a risky thing to do."
Albany,2sbnz0,ob1comeblowme,2,Thu Jan 15 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"I think this hits the nail on the head for trying to explain how I feel too. I totally know what you mean by ""in on the joke"" (with ""joke"" for lack of a better word, of course.) As the moderate/social catholic that I am, I like going to church for the comfort of the tradition, and also for those ~WOW~ moments when something really speaks to me, in a religious sense (I used to get that feeling a LOT with Fr. Bob back in college.) Thanks for your great response!"

I have the capital to risk, but have held back so far because there are significant challenges.  First, you need to be mindful of the expense of a larger space. You need to have a space that is big enough that you can fill with regularity. This is going to be the riskiest part of a new business. Remember, only the first person has to take the risk. Anyone else can follow and come up with numbers with less risk just by watching the first location.  Second, regulatory concerns. The second you offer food you have a whole new set of health regulations that simply don't exist for a game store. For example, I don't know a single game store in the area that has more than a single bathroom, and that's not going to fly for someone selling food. The skills that make for a good cafe employee do not necessarily translate to a good game store employee, and vice versa.  Third, competition.  In order for this idea to be successful, you need to be able to bring in enough people for the cafe side of things to keep the business moving, while at the same time be available enough that a group could reliably find a gaming space. You need to appeal enough for the non-gamer to walk in and feel comfortable enough to eat. On this end you're competing with every other cafe in the market.  You are also competing with game stores. These are spaces where a customer will typically have an experience that's more free some non-gamer judgement. You should expect that a game store will have a larger and broader supply of game merchandise to sell if they are dedicating more space to that endeavor. There is already a tremendous amount of competition in this areas on this front, and there are many customers who are loyal to specific stores. Because of customer loyalty and competition concerns I often consider a partnership with an existing store almost essential to success.  And lastly, you're competing with gaming at someone's home, which is generally free. You have to provide enough value to players that they will come out to game even though the experience will cost them more than what they can expect at home. Custom tables and accessories are nice, but really boost the cost of launch. A space that's open attracts new people, but can be annoying to a group that wants to play without others stopping them to chat.   I have collected ideas on how to make this happen, but for me right now the risk is too great for the amount of time and money I would need to invest to see it happen. I continue to jot down my ideas and discuss it from time to time, but I don't see myself in a position to move forward on my own right now."
Albany,2s6de5,Willie365,5,Mon Jan 12 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with what you are saying and we have had the same exact conversations ourselves. We would ideally like to work with places like Zombie Planet, Flights, and Grimfoe. I don't think we would be in the business of selling the merchandise but would have the rule books for the different games people would play and maybe offer services like tutorials for different miniature gaming or painting figures. We would love to advertise and support the other local gaming stores in the area.  I agree with you that it is a risk and you always open the door for competitors once you get your own business off the ground. It's nice to see that there is an interest in the area for something like this and that there are even like minded individuals that have had similar plans."
Albany,2s6de5,eec003,4,Mon Jan 12 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"I wish you the best if you move forward. If you want to pick my brain further, I'd be happy to help."
Albany,2s6de5,Beeb294,5,Mon Jan 12 18:37:14 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I will keep that in mind.
Albany,2s6de5,BlooregardQKazoo,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:39:03 2015 UTC,Watch twitchtv Wednesday nights. They have a fighting game tournament every wed in the city and one show after that in cali. Lots of players and people. Personally. Indoor paintball field would be sick because you can't play here at Albany in the winter when its the perfect time. Hell I know people that would help you for free
Albany,2s6de5,Willie365,3,Tue Jan 13 00:44:33 2015 UTC,Definitely consider Foam Brain in Troy. They do lots of conventions and know how to run gaming sessions and open gaming.
Albany,2s6de5,18-24-61-B-17-17-4,2,Tue Jan 13 03:02:02 2015 UTC,"i'd also keep in mind that, at least in my opinion, gamers tend to be a pretty poor/cheap market.   for every person who is willing to spend money on their hobby there always seem to be multiple people who just mooch and never spend any money. my wife and i are part of a fairly large group of regular boardgamers and if you count my wife and i separately (so we count as two people who buy things) i'd say 4 of the 12 people spend regular money on the hobby. and we often go out for food/drinks before or after games and that consists of the 4 of us and maybe one or two others joining (and the others who join go cheap).   i've been in a lot of D&D games and i cannot count the number of people who wouldn't just buy a damn core rulebook. they're playing over 100 hours of an RPG over the course of the year (that's a lot of free entertainment) and getting them to buy a $5-$10 set of dice can be a chore.   don't get me started on the people who do finally buy a game and then get it on Amazon after playing in a store just about every week for over a year. lord forbid they pay $10 more while supporting the store that has let them use their space and games library for free.  and on top of all of this, a gaming cafe isn't a very casual thing so you'll 100% rely on the niche market you're targeting. you better like that market. now i might be a cynic, but i'd personally stay far away from targeting the gamer market. you want the people who casually drop $2 on every game they find in an appstore, not poor or tight-fisted people who feel entitled to mooch."
Albany,2s6de5,abadidol,2,Mon Jan 12 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"There are more people playing pen and paper games today than ever before. Some of us have been playing for decades and can now afford to be more than the type of people you're describing. As someone who is a gamer since the early 80s, I make it a point to spend money every time I am in Zombie Planet to play. Might not be a $100 board game, but I make certain there's something to make them know I appreciate the time.  The key here is not trying to pinpoint your market. You don't want to be a game store that also sells coffee and food, you're still just a game store. You don't want to be a coffee shop that allows people to play games, you're still just a coffee shop. The key to making this business idea a success is creating a unique space that has appeal to anyone who might be passing by.  For example, there are some cafes that supplement their model by having private rooms for children's parties. You don't have to worry about whether five people playing Pathfinder using the free web materials is generating money when you are bringing in $25 a head from a couple dozen children for 2.5 hours. But, if you're going to do something like this you really have to be a place that will attract a mini-van mom to come in and not turn away in disgust.  And for the people who are not willing to spend money on dice and stuff, there's ways to monetize their time as well. I have lists of ideas on that, but you have to be willing to potentially turn that person away."

Not every gamer is going to be in the vein of ""I have expendable income and don't mind renting a gaming table or going out to play MtG and have a few drinks"". The mooch is definitely a hindrance and something to take into consideration. Thank you for bringing it up."

Albany,2s6de5,kenster26,7,Mon Jan 12 19:18:35 2015 UTC,Troy might be the area to do this in with RPI nearby.
Albany,2s6de5,abadidol,2,Mon Jan 12 17:20:59 2015 UTC,We were thinking of trying to be close to one of the bigger colleges in the area.
Albany,2s6de5,abadidol,3,Mon Jan 12 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know if RPI would be a good choice. Obviously the students there are the probably the closest to your target audience, but there are plenty of places on campus to game that are around food sources. (Union, McNeil Room, any of the labs with cafe carts, any of the buildings close to one of the dining halls).   It would be tough to bring enough students off campus for a very similar experience to what they can get on campus already."

Albany,2s6de5,Koldslaw,2,Mon Jan 12 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"That would be great! I only know of gaming shops that allow people to play but most arent set up well for gaming groups and don't serve food/drinks. Our gaming group would love to be served drinks and food while we played. (DnD and Shadowrun)  One big issue for our group would be that we remote a player in over hangouts with Roll20 and put him up on a TV. I know many groups do this also, so this kind of functionality would be essential and the lack of it would prevent our group from using a place like this."

Albany,2s6de5,Jgallstar1,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:58:26 2015 UTC,"I think its a neat idea, however as has been mentioned, i'm not sure how well it translates to a successful business model.  Wheres your profit going to come from?  Mainly food and drink?  Then you need to figure out how to run a successful bar/restaurant which is a challenge in and of it self.  Maybe you just go for simple eats and drinks and really try to target gamers.  Do you plan to server alcohol?  If so, that could be a challenge as a lot of your target clientele is under 21.  No alcohol then?  As an adult gamer this would not appeal to me as much.  Would you need to charge for table time since you won't have the merchandising end to help prop you up? I wish you the best if you proceed.  Work out a business model and report back!"
Albany,2s6de5,Darnwell,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:26:28 2015 UTC,This has been a large discussion for us. I wanted to go more bar atmosphere because I would want the older crowd. Nothing against kids or anything but if you wanted a place to come in and play your games with a snack and a soda then you can go to any of the game stores around and do that. I do see the benefits of a cafe as well as alcohol is not for everyone. We were going more for the rental space idea as far as the gaming tables. I was more looking to see how much of an interest there was for something like this as we are still in the planning phases. Thank you for your input.
Albany,2s6de5,jayjaywalker3,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, maybe it could be a time of day thing where throughout the day no alcohol and can be open to families as well. Then at night is more ""adult swim"" crowd with more mature clientele. I have heard of places that set up game days for kids so they get into tabletop etc. or even computer time on games like minecraft and the pay model is walk-in or for the month type deal."
