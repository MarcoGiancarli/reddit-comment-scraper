We have the gist of the movie without knowing too much. Another trailer would just fill in the blanks that the viewing of the movie should.  With that said, I'll probably do what I did with QOS. I'll watch it ONCE. Not one day, but one time. I'll get excited but likely forget the set pieces and locations until the I watch for the first time."

JamesBond,3e2dpa,JamesBondRadio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:02:10 2015 UTC,"Worst. Trailer. Ever.  It's bad enough that they spoiled the John Connor twist, but they didn't even portray it properly. It least in the context of the film it made sense, unlike the trailer where they made it seem like John willingly joined Skynet."
JamesBond,3e2dpa,MrF33n3y,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:33 2015 UTC,"We haven't had a proper trailer yet though. We had a teaser (which was admittedly longer than I expected) and a TV spot. I think the more casual Bond fans want to see a typical Bond trailer with explosions, chase scenes and all that fun stuff. The teaser didn't have any action in it, and not everybody has seen the TV spot, so it makes sense they'd release something more susbtantial."

JamesBond,3e01w3,akanefive,3,Tue Jul 21 09:55:30 2015 UTC,"I go back and forth on Nolan - the man can film the hell out of an action sequence, but I worry that he's too focused on making ""important"" films. He seems to have a singular vision for his movies, and doesn't like a lot of input from the people above him. I don't generally think this is a problem, but I don't think it would work well for Bond.  That said, I haven't seen a Nolan film I haven't loved, so maybe I'm overthinking it. At the very least, he would need a screenwriter able to infuse the right amount of wittiness into the dialogue."
JamesBond,3e01w3,Zentaurion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in seeing it, what that Nolan touch would bring, but not get my hopes up that it will be the best Bond ever. I wouldn't have thought that Sam Mendes would have made such a great Bond movie, and he has, so it seems unpredictable to me.  Better that Christopher Nolan get to make one rather than Quentin Tarantino, who would put too much of his unique touch on it."
JamesBond,3e01w3,eoinster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:00 2015 UTC,"Nolan often has those hamfisted themes and messages in his films   Just curious, but what don't you like about the ""live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" theme? I think it was very fitting of the film and very fitting of the character. As for Interstellar, that is the part I hated the most, but from what I understand his brother Jonathan was the main writer for that one, so not to worry."

JamesBond,3dxvns,Nutty_Nadim,16,Mon Jul 20 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"This is a crappy click-bait headline, but the comments are actually spot on, I think. Mendes was worried that the Bond movies would stick with the Brosnan style. If that were the case, Craig would have absolutely been miscast."
JamesBond,3dxvns,akanefive,6,Mon Jul 20 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"He would have been terrible. But I think the sudden influx of Bourne-esque thrillers very abruptly changed the kind of spy movies the audience wanted, and Craig's Bond capitalized on that in a truly phenomenal way."
JamesBond,3dxvns,Dovahkiin_Vokun,11,Mon Jul 20 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think it had less to do with Bourne and more to do with how ridiculous Die Another Day had been. Michael G.

JamesBond,3dxvns,Jaywearspants,0,Tue Jul 21 00:02:32 2015 UTC,Probably for a skiing scene where they need to use a little CGI.
JamesBond,3dxvns,CelebornX,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:38 2015 UTC,Probably not. I don't think they would need mapping dots for that kind of CGI. This is more of facial editing stuff. Look up pictures of Aaron Eckhart's face while filming for The Dark Knight. Not that Waltz's face will be that drastically enhanced.
JamesBond,3dxvns,notexactlyclever,9,Mon Jul 20 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"Not being familiar with Craig's other work, When I heard the casting announcement for Casino Royale I must admit I was feeling the same way. The last Bond movie I saw with my Grandfather ( Biggest bond fan I knew, saw the Dr. No in theaters and always caught the franchise first week opening) was TWINE. So to have someone who I felt didn't have the chops to be as cool as bond was quite disheartening. I remember almost feeling dread when I bought my ticket to Casino Royale...  And then the opening scene ended and I was convinced this was going to be amazing"

JamesBond,3dxvns,chibuezephoibos,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Regardless of what name his character has, I'm really looking forward to his performance. He's fantastic."
JamesBond,3dxvns,akanefive,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Prior to being cast as Bond, Craig did a decent job establishing himself with his performances in Road to Perdition, Layer Cake, and Munich. While he might not have been everyone's first choice at the time (I think Clive Owen was the favorite at the time because of his work on the BMW short films called The Hire), but I don't think it would necessarily be fair to think that Craig was so unsuited. He's a good actor, he can play tough or refined, controlled or violent, stoic or wounded."
JamesBond,3dxvns,Willravel,0,Mon Jul 20 16:49:57 2015 UTC,He was also awesome in Kid in King Arthur's Court
JamesBond,3dxvns,foxh8er,9,Mon Jul 20 22:51:33 2015 UTC,"Read the article. He's not saying Craig was a bad Bond, he didn't think Craig would have made a good ""wink at the camera jokey Bond"" in the vein of Moore or some Brosnan. He was unaware they were changing the tone with Casino Royale."

Is there any reason, other than legal issues, as to why EA can't release, say, Everything Or Nothing for mobile, same way we have Grand Theft Auto for mobile? Instead we get this cash grab BS."
JamesBond,3dvnq3,akanefive,2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"I kept waiting and waiting for footage and nothing happened and then it dawned on me, ""Oh... this is the whole game."" It felt like one long load screen. I've seen Clue and Monopoly playthroughs more interesting than this. Yeah, I totally agree, I'd love to see something like that over this. I enjoyed seeing Rockstar do that with the GTAs although I'm not much of a mobile gamer in general. I'd prefer an HD collection of sorts for console or PC. Like with Ico and Shadow of the Colossus or Metal Gear Solid. Not like Goldeneye Reloaded, just tweak the graphics and remaster the sound and you're good. Everything or Nothing and From Russia With Love HD Dual Pack or something. If you're gonna go mobile, I feel like a 007-themed baccarat game with online matches would be more appropriate. At least be different. Avatars are of the different characters from the eras. I dunno, maybe some other minigames."
JamesBond,3dvnq3,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"I've really enjoyed GTA on mobile, it's translated really well, and at $10 each, I wonder why more gaming companies haven't jumped on this. The only parallel I've seen is the NBA 2K series, which manages to put the full game (basically) on iPhone with few issues.  So barring old Bond games on mobile, I don't know why there hasn't been a 007 driving missions game or something. Seems like really low hanging fruit."
JamesBond,3dvnq3,akanefive,2,Mon Jul 20 13:32:56 2015 UTC,"I have the originals on Xbox, the Stories games on PSP, and I bought them all again on PSN for PS3. I'm pretty satiated lol. But I can see the appeal. Doctors visit? Why not a little rampage action in the waiting room?   Well unless they're owned by MGM Interactive, that's a thing isn't it? I guess strike that up to disconnected execs? Trying to keep Bond in the 40+ demographic? I have no idea. I get that way about things on Netflix. Like why isn't EVERYTHING just on here? And even the Bond movies they've pulled from it. Why? Why do?"
JamesBond,3dvnq3,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. I was so disappointed when I saw how little effort was put into this ""game."" There's no gameplay at all, the only reason this was even made was because of the 007 license, which, if this game turns out to be a success (knockonwood), it will be because of that alone. Since it was being made by Glu, I was already expecting the worst, and yet they still managed to surprise me... The most cynical attempt at a Bond game I've ever come across.  You're completely right, if some old 007 games ended up ported to mobile, I'd buy those in a heartbeat: obviously GoldenEye 64 would be the holy grail, but Everything Or Nothing or From Russia With Love would be amazing as well! I'm guessing the reason that doesn't happen is due to licensing issues (I don't think any company holds the exclusive rights for 007 games. There's also the actors' likenesses to consider, the rights to which might limit eventual ports), but still, at this point, it would probably be the only way to ensure a faithful 007 experience on mobile."

JamesBond,3dtwg4,cjf4,18,Sun Jul 19 14:58:09 2015 UTC,His friends ridiculed him for directing Bond films? Looks like he needs better friends.
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Kruse,10,Sun Jul 19 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, everyone look at Sammy! He's all successful and taking a franchise in new and exciting directions? What's wrong, Sammy? Unwilling to continue the status quo? Pfff..."
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Willravel,9,Sun Jul 19 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"Considering how much he talks about enjoying theatre, something tells me those are the friends he's talking about and they are probably the types of people who all scoff at the idea of getting involved with big Hollywood franchises."
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Kruse,5,Sun Jul 19 21:03:36 2015 UTC,Makes you wonder how John Glen did 5 of the bloody things in a row. Yikes.
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Clancy_B_Shanty,4,Sun Jul 19 17:33:22 2015 UTC,"They came out every other year at that point, so it wasn't such a drawn out process."
JamesBond,3dtwg4,CelebornX,4,Sun Jul 19 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Things were different back then, now with all of these opportunities Mendes would like to try other stuff"
JamesBond,3dtwg4,dragonsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:50 2015 UTC,That's true. Budgets aren't what they used to be as well...
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Clancy_B_Shanty,4,Mon Jul 20 02:32:09 2015 UTC,"Bad news for the future, IMO. But then that does depends who they get to replace him of course. Anyone got any preferences?"
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Duck-You-Sucker,11,Sun Jul 19 12:38:07 2015 UTC,Campbell should do whoever comes next in Bond 26.
JamesBond,3dtwg4,dragonsky,4,Sun Jul 19 14:01:29 2015 UTC,Not at all bad news. Bond franchise is used to having a lot of different new directors and they were probably ready for Mendes to leave after Skyfall so..I am sure we'll be fine :)
JamesBond,3dtwg4,akanefive,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"I think even without Mendes they're in good shape. The fact that they were willing to pay him to direct two of these tells me they're willing to shell out for a quality director, which wasn't always the case."
JamesBond,3dtwg4,risnuff,4,Mon Jul 20 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"If one good thing comes from this, maybe the next director will bring David Arnold back as composer. Mendes supposedly went with Thomas Newman for his two Bond films because that's his go-to guy."
JamesBond,3dtwg4,x73rmin8r,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:38 2015 UTC,110% agree. I really miss Arnold. Weakest link of Skyfall by far was the lack of a really strong score.

JamesBond,3dtwg4,pickelsurprise,10,Wed Jul 22 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"George Miller is a great director, but I'm not sure if he suits the current style of Bond. Someone a bit more subtle would probably be better suited. If the aesthetics of the Moore era make a resurgence,  Miller could probably make the best Bond film ever."
JamesBond,3dtwg4,eoinster,4,Sun Jul 19 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"Danny Boyle yes and Iñárritu too if he toned back a little bit, but the other two are far too stylistic for Bond IMO."

JamesBond,3dtwg4,dragonsky,2,Mon Jul 20 03:32:50 2015 UTC,Alejandro González Iñárritu   No. I highly doubt he can make a good Bond movie.  I wouldn't go for mainstream directors.  The only person that's more or less mainstream that I'd be fine with him directing is Guy Ritchie but he has UNCLE coming out so..
JamesBond,3dtwg4,Valtheim_,6,Sun Jul 19 23:43:56 2015 UTC,I vote Chris Nolan.

He said he didn't think he would do Spectre but he did... perhaps if Spectre is successful like Skyfall he'll change his mind again.   Also, I'm very pumped for the theme song now. So happy it's done! But why all the mystery?   Lastly, Paul Greengrass seems a good replacement if one is needed (This guy directed Captain Phillips and the Bourne Ultimatum)"
JamesBond,3dtwg4,DasScarecrow,2,Sun Jul 19 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"Not surprising. I remember him being on the fence about returning after Skyfall.

Rumors have persisted since he signed on for Skyfall, that it was part of a Logan scripted trilogy to be helmed by Mendes. Plus, Brocolli and Co actually pushed back SPECTRE to wait for Mendes to finish his theater engagements.   I'm hopeful he'll come back for a third and final go."

JamesBond,3dmcfm,jamedudijench,6,Fri Jul 17 13:02:18 2015 UTC,"That chapter is one of the many reasons Moonraker is my favourite of the novels. I love that sort of ""What Bond is doing when he's not being written about"".   I enjoy the sort of regret he has when he, the most senior member of his section is sitting in a nice office and hitting on his secretary when 008 is in hospital and 0011 is still MIA."
JamesBond,3dmcfm,Clancy_B_Shanty,4,Fri Jul 17 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"Clancy! How you been?   Yes, you said it perfectly. I am so looking forward to the rest. I like to savor these little chunks. Where Bond in the first two books is all about the mission, must focus on the mission, here it's like ""Sigh, I'm not on a mission..."" Like I love the part in Live and Let Die where he immerses himself in Voodoo culture and reads about Baron Semedi and just devotes his off time to prepare how to accomplish this mission.   But like you said, I especially love how we see the first instance of pacing or dividing up the book. It's very plainly put: Part One - Monday. It's quietly genius. Bond has another side to his life."
JamesBond,3dmcfm,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Fri Jul 17 16:20:53 2015 UTC,"I've been okay!   I went on my vacation to Cuba back in May and tried to do as Bond does. Travelled in a Navy Blue suit and a knit tie. Drank them out of their scotch. I got a picture of myself a la Daniel Craig hunched over at the bar. My outfits during the day were akin to Connery in Thunderball. I didn't want to look like a stereotypical tourist.  Back to the topic at hand hahaha. Moonraker is amazing for the first act alone, but the entire book keeps it up. The card game -- my GOD that card game with Drax NEEDS to be in a film."
JamesBond,3dmcfm,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Sat Jul 18 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Wow! That sounds amazing. So you had a good time? Well that's nice :) glad to hear.   Yes! I'm just about to start Chapter 4 actually on my next read. Drax already sounds loads more interesting than Lonsdale in the film (non)adaptation. This may be an unpopular opinion but I feel like this is what they were going for with Greene in Quantum of Solace. He's a critic darling, wealthy, and a man of the people with a questionable affiliation to some dealings that may or may not have ulterior motives. He's not reclusive like Mr. Big and he's not of a position of seniority in an organization like Le Chiffre. He's like this proto Elon Musk (the rocket connection is uncanny) but also a war hero of sorts. Very intriguing. I also like how this is starting out sort of organically; this isn't a mission yet per say, just a personal matter that M. is consulting Bond on."
JamesBond,3dmcfm,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Sat Jul 18 11:29:41 2015 UTC,"If you watch Die Another Day ever again, put the commentary on. Rosamund Pike's character was originally going to be Gala Brand.

JamesBond,3dh6a9,Duck-You-Sucker,3,Thu Jul 16 11:23:42 2015 UTC,"Well the way I see it, there's no old or new canon.  It's a one big non-linear story.  Blofeld was dead in FYEO...but SPECTRE (and any other future movie) happens before the events in FYEO so we can always have Blofeld."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,5,Thu Jul 16 11:35:14 2015 UTC,"This is important. People want to see James Bond like Star Wars. It's not like that. The idea of canon in Bond gives way to the (hopefully expunged) code name theory. So the looser the better if you ask me.   And thank you so much for posting this. I had no context for those steelbooks and now I see what the deal is, so thank you. I'm pretty on board now. Makes me imagine another set of like ""adversary"" themed steelbooks. Dr. No, Goldfinger, TMWTGG, Octopussy. Kinda stupid haha but that's all I got for now."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,akanefive,7,Thu Jul 16 12:07:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't particularly matter, but I don't agree with this. I don't think the Craig films need any explanation beyond ""we're wiping the continuity clean, and starting over."" Because if you try to explain the events of 20 movies happening within the Craig continuity, your head will explode. I mean, how many old movies are about the Cold War? Casino Royale is set specifically in a post-Cold War, post-9/11 world. Connery-Brosnan was Bond Volume 1, Craig is Bond Volume 2."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're right to a point. Volume 1 and 2 is probably the best/easiest way to explain things to people. Because, well, it's factually correct. But in the nitty gritty of things, I find that at a certain point, the movies mirror what had happened in the (later) novels and that is cultural updating. Bond's history had to be continually updated because the Golden Years of the Cold War were getting further and further away. So where as Volume 1 and 2 make for an easy simplification, I kinda think one could make a case for Volumes 1 (1962-85), 2 (1987-2002), and 3 (2006-present). And again, not code name territory, just cultural paralleling. That's my case anyway."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,akanefive,2,Thu Jul 16 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"I actually have a longer explanation that essentially says what you just said. Basically, we got a soft reboot when Moore took on the role, and another when Dalton took over. (Both times, Tracy's death is included in the character's history.) Then we get an official reboot in 2006 for Casino Royale, where Bond isn't a widower."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. There was always that constant of Tracy through the soft reboots which kept the character grounded through the cultural changes. And now, we're essentially starting over back at a starting point like maybe Connery would have if there were films before Dr. No.   Which makes me think of another unrelated point, technically Dr. No (while the first film) could have and probably does take place after novels 1 through 5, well maybe sans FRWL. He had, after all, been using his Beretta for years. But that's neither here nor there."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,akanefive,2,Thu Jul 16 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"Well the whole concept of an ""origin story"" in anything other than a comic book is a new phenomenon. Most action heroes, until recently, didn't get a complicated history or backstory. So Bond, in Dr. No, was an established agent, just because it wasn't done any other way. That said, I think the more layers these characters have, the more interesting the stories become."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,2,Thu Jul 16 15:26:50 2015 UTC,The stakes get higher for sure. The emotional investment alone. Even in the Casino Royale book Bond's background is relatively unexplored. Sure we hear about earning his double 0 status but not much else. He was still an established agent at the time as he was in the Dr. No film. I even think about Star Wars and how Darth Vader's backstory wasn't officially explored until 16 years later. Good points again.
JamesBond,3dh6a9,akanefive,3,Thu Jul 16 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the Star Wars prequels are a good example of how not to do an origin story. As much as I appreciate those movies for the cool lightsabre and space stuff, I think making Vader a whiney, lovesick Jedi with a temper and Mommy-issues was a wasted opportunity."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'm more or less in the same boat. I'm a die hard SW fan outside of JB so I love/hate the prequels. I do of course appreciate them for the reasons you stated and more but Anakin is one of the weaker aspects of them. I have found that The Clone Wars series makes up for a lot of what the PT fell short on and that was, well, time. It's a story not easily told in around 7 hours (this is starting to sound like another subreddit lol)."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,DoubleCop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"I kind of want to see someone try to do a proper chronological order just to see what it'd look like, if only for the '62-'02 films.  The only real structure to be had would be from Tracy references, Leiter/Blofeld appearances, and Goldeneye indicating the end of the Cold War."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"Aren't they kind of already in chronological order? Because I see some issues. There's the problem of the Blofeld continuity between YOLT and OHMSS. We have to take Dr. No through Thunderball as the given, those are all sequential. If you chose to go book order that leaves you with a continuity error, of you go film order, you still have a continuity error. Behind the scenes, obviously we know about not being able to film OHMSS on time with weather situations so YOLT came first and then Peter Hunt opted for the most accurate film to book ratio with OHMSS, thus Bond and Blofeld meet for the first time...again. The only way this can be explained is with a wild facial surgery theory (the original, scrapped idea). And don't go code name on me because our next bit of continuity comes in the form of Tracy's gravestone: 1943 - 1969. Making FYEO 12 years later and the (now official) death of Blofeld. From here you just kinda have to rely on technology and cultural references I guess. So, to me, I feel like the franchise already is in ""chronological"" order.  I'm still an advocate for the ""Volumes Theory"" championed by /u/akanefive"
JamesBond,3dh6a9,DoubleCop,3,Thu Jul 16 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"The only chronological change different from the films release orders would be that the Goldeneye pre-title sequence takes place before TLD and probably LTK, though arguably right before."

JamesBond,3dh6a9,akanefive,3,Thu Jul 16 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is fanwanking, but I think the Bond/Blofeld meeting in OHMSS makes sense in the continuity if you interpret it as the two of them bluffing. I don't think there is anything that disproves that interpretation."
JamesBond,3dh6a9,jamedudijench,2,Thu Jul 16 19:05:53 2015 UTC,Ohhh I've heard that before actually. The thing is I just watched that like 2 days ago. But I was being really objective so I could soak up how good it is. I might have to go back with this idea.
JamesBond,3dh6a9,ReadingScottSteiner,2,Thu Jul 16 19:11:11 2015 UTC,That's the exact way I looked at it while watching the movie the first time. It was kind of odd that Bond and Blofeld wouldn't recognize each other (obvious recasting aside) but you definitely get this vibe that they each know who the other is but they're trying to draw this out as long as possible.

JamesBond,3ddvz0,jamedudijench,2,Wed Jul 15 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, people keep pushing past 4K quickly. So, depending on how you want to look at ""obsolete,"" maybe. But I personally don't think so.  The older Bond films have been mastered in 4K by Lowry way back for the DVD releases. 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays are on their way (2016). So, although I'd like to see the 4K releases in my hands months ago, they are on their way. 4K TVs just started to become readily available (and affordable).  There's only so much visual information on the original camera negatives. If you watch the special feature of Lowry's remastering, they state that 4K is actually a bit overkill, and has slightly more pixels than what is needed to see everything on the negs.  So sure, 6K, 8K, (and beyond) are on their way. But, for older films, it's heading into overkill territory anyways.  People want to think that digital distribution (through the Internet) is the way of the future... and it is—to an extent. The only problem is that the bandwidth just isn't there for most people. The bitrate of 4K on YouTube is absolute dirt, especially compared to what you'll get on a disc. Even now, Blu-ray is far superior to any 1080p streaming in terms of bitrate."
JamesBond,3ddvz0,Duck-You-Sucker,2,Thu Jul 16 04:38:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with everything you said. Like, I look at certain sets I have, and I'll use The Man With No Name trilogy blu ray set from recently as an example, and it really .can't get any better than that. It accomplishes the goal of being a high def transfer of an older film.   For me, I guess it's more about precedent. What is different here compared to everything before? Yes, as a Bond fan these are great. The cases are sexy. But is that it? You know what I'm saying? I guess my point is not so much about 4k as much as it is about uniqueness.   And now I just read what this set is all about. They're all SPECTRE related films. See, I knew there had to be something behind the choices. I didn't catch it. And it appears there will be one or more never before seen featurettes, which is what I was wondering about all along. So that's good.

Right off the bat, with M scolding Bond for being away for too long, the tone of this film just seems off. And while lots of it are fun (I'm in the pro-Wint and Kidd camp), a lot of it just feels like the filmmakers ran out of steam.  I'm not really a fan of Blofeld in this movie, or maybe how he was written. Beyond the scene where he's dressed in drag, the penthouse scene after Bond kills the double, Blofeld dismisses him by saying he wants to go to bed! It's almost as if the screenwriter wasn't sure how to end the scene.  I just think Diamonds was a huge wasted opportunity. Even if they wanted to go lighter, I still think there was a better way to acknowledge the events of the past movies that what we got. Ah well, as it stands, the movie is so campy and strange it's fun to watch from time to time."
JamesBond,3dawiz,akanefive,2,Wed Jul 15 14:06:36 2015 UTC,The tone feels very similar to the Roger Moore films that followed it. It's almost as if the creative team had already moved on from Connery's take on Bond.

JamesBond,3d77kp,ononothimagen,3,Tue Jul 14 04:06:02 2015 UTC,How? Car phones have actually been around since the 40s or so.
JamesBond,3d77kp,dangerousszone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:12:42 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat off-topic, but your comment reminded me of a funny story. My grandfather used to drive along the beach with a phone in his car and pretend like it actually worked. This would've been in the 40's as well. He also served in the Navy, so there's another sort of 007 link."
JamesBond,3d77kp,Dude4001,3,Thu Jul 16 21:26:29 2015 UTC,Connery's Bond never time-travelled as far as I'm aware
JamesBond,3d77kp,Alexedward00,0,Tue Jul 14 12:10:56 2015 UTC,"Great movie, from its theme to amazing boat chase scene and gadgets everything seems just perfect. But I believe that Roger Moore did couple of unnecessary movies that definitely made a bad effect on his Bond journey"
JamesBond,3d3zh3,jamedudijench,8,Mon Jul 13 09:50:27 2015 UTC,"Get Free Cash? Named after your father perhaps.  I would have to say, if you look at it from the perspective of not taking it seriously at all, it is true that it can be quite enjoyable. It's sort of a proto-Moore outing. Rather bland and odd-looking cars, over-the-top henchmen, cringe-worthy moments involving some of the scenes with women, ridiculous moon buggy chase, schlocky mobsters, quite uneasy and aged Bond, all ingredients in a soup of acquired Bond taste.   The James Bond film range is something of a badge of honor, I feel. You have this and then you have Casino Royale and From Russia With Love. So, on its own merits, this film is pretty trashy. But compared with the rest of the film canon, it's something of beauty. Lots to appreciate here but not for the traditional reasons."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,akanefive,3,Mon Jul 13 11:19:21 2015 UTC,"The really interesting thing about this movie is how much further they take the language, nudity, and suggestive language. The line of what they could get away with was in a much different place by 1971, which I think makes it feel that much more different from the earlier Connery movies."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 13 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. This was the dawn of the Kubricks and the Coppolas and Scorseses. These gritty, visceral films that toppled the status quo. All of what you said. I mean, I don't even think the first PG-13 rating was until Temple of Doom, right? Films were mostly General Audience or Not Rated at that time, I believe. I don't know when R was created. Interesting point though."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,akanefive,2,Mon Jul 13 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, PG-13 was created in response to Temple of Doom, which was rated PG, but was clearly not a PG movie. Diamonds, on the other hand, has a similar feel to the 60's Bond film, but uses the language and nudity standards almost like new toys: ""You mean we can say that? And show that?"""
JamesBond,3d3zh3,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 13 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"That's what it was, in response to it. See you're making such a good case (get it?) that i need to rewatch with that in mind."

JamesBond,3d3zh3,akanefive,4,Tue Jul 14 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"There are a few things to like here, though it really loses steam in the final act. I like that Bond is more detective than super hero in Amsterdam and when they first get to Vegas. I like Bond on the exterior elevator, and the way he gets up to the penthouse. I love the music, especially Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd's motif. And I really enjoy their performances.  Otherwise, this is a movie with A LOT of issues. (But that's for another thread.)  EDIT: I got downvoted, and instead of getting cranky about it, I realized that my initial comment comes across as a little harsh, so let me clarify. I actually really like how campy this movie is. I have fun watching it, for entirely different reasons than OHMSS."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,jamedudijench,3,Mon Jul 13 13:25:59 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see how someone could have thought you were being harsh. I understood what you were saying. If you were coming to an appreciation post to bash it using words like ""love"" and ""enjoy"" then you failed horribly. But otherwise, people need to work on their reading comprehension skills. Ironic, being that we're talking about a series borne of literature."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,akanefive,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"It's all good. My main point was that, while it's not the movie I would use to introduce someone to the series, it's a fun watch in spite of it's noticeable flaws."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 13 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"It's a good movie to crack wise at with two robot friends. In fact, I think I might do that in the not too distant future."

JamesBond,3d3zh3,onceamennonite,2,Mon Jul 13 17:38:27 2015 UTC,"Long one of my favorites, mostly because of the humor.  Connery gets to deliver some great compact lines, like ""small world"" (to the ""I got a bruddah"" guy), which just gets me every time.  And I like Jill St. John's unabashed amorality."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,sigersen,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:02 2015 UTC,I love the I got a bruddah line too !
JamesBond,3d3zh3,jwpar1701,2,Mon Jul 13 23:40:32 2015 UTC,"I just rewatched this the other night and found it to be really fun, but also fascinating; it's got such a unique apathy pervading it while at the same time being incredibly weird for a Bond film. It's like they thought, ""Well, fuck it, Sean's sleepwalking through this one, let's throw the weirdest shit we can at the audience and see if we can keep them awake. BOOM--Plastic surgery mud death. BOOM--Globe-hopping gay hitmen. BOOM--Vegas. BOOM--Moon Buggy. Circus Circus? And Blofeld in drag? You bet your ass."""
JamesBond,3d3zh3,akanefive,3,Tue Jul 14 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"That's so well put - it somehow manages to be both apathetic and innovative at the same time. Nobody on screen seems to be working that hard, but the narrative structure is really interesting (especially in the opening act), and there is some really fun camera work - I'm thinking of the shot in Amsterdam where we see Wint and Kidd on the bridge, before zooming past them onto Bond, and the shot of Bond riding outside the elevator on the Whyte House, which zooms out to reveal the entire building.   Also, I'll say it time and again, the music in this one is top 5 in the series. I love the satellite reveal cue, and the Wint and Kidd theme."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,MyNameIsBobH111,2,Tue Jul 14 13:28:48 2015 UTC,This movie is bonkers. God bless it!
JamesBond,3d3zh3,dangerousszone,2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"My favorite part of the movie is undoubtedly the fight between Bond and Peter Franks in the elevator in Amsterdam. It's a really intense, well-shot, planned, and acted scene. You get a sense that these men actually want to kill each other, and the fight doesn't feel like it's completely choreographed.

JamesBond,3d3zh3,Tony_M_Cannoli,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion if you disagree, but this is personally my least favorite film in the series.   Connery was in the worst shape of his life, and gave his most aloof performance. Humor isn't bad, but Connery just doesn't roll along with the humor like Moore does. Bond films often rest on the strength of the female lead, and Tiffany Case was weakest one of the 60's. It damaged the Blofeld Trilogy by following up OHMSS with a parody. The plot isn't really original, and basically just follows the standard formula."
JamesBond,3d3zh3,rersaf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:10:14 2015 UTC,"I feel condemning the film for a campy tone is an insult to impartiality, akin to saying ""Bond films can't be campy!"" That's not ordinary subjectivity, that's bias. The thing we should avoid, however, is cartooniness. Characters squashing and stretching like out of a Chuck Jones picture (or perhaps blowing up like a balloon) It suggests ""Hey, these people can't get hurt,"" dissolving any sense of danger. It works against the stunts; it can even make them feel like they were faked. I think they go as far as playing a cartoon sound effect in one of the later films, a slide whistle or something like that. Fortunately, this film shows more restraint than that. I can't think of any stand-out cartoony moments in this one.  This film's real problem (or the most prominent) is what I like to call ""convenience plotting."" A demonstration: ""My goodness, Bond, it's incredibly fortunate that the smugglers managed to set up the funeral thing when you decided to smuggle the diamonds in a corpse. How helpful it is that Blofeld left the tape deck on that laboratory table for you to discover when he should have it locked up in a vault, because his entire plan hinges on it! It's also really helpful that he didn't immediately confiscate your fake tape deck when you were first searched on your arrival at the oil rig! Instead, he leaves it on a table for you to palm later! And it's a good thing that a weather balloon was available for you to signal to Felix! And that a heavy thing attached to a crane was available for you to smash the control centre with! What would you have done if these contrivances and coincidences hadn't happened?"" Convenience plotting shows up in some later films, but I think this was the first and most pervasive example of it here.  I could talk about other things such as the moon buggy chase where Bond employs uses evasive manoeuvres such as driving in a straight line while enemy cars fall into holes into the ground because they are incapable of driving or Tiffany Case's derailed character, going from evading the CIA at the circus, to falling off oil rigs and throwing cakes at baddies after spending quite a bit of time MIA. There are other things I could talk about, but I'm trying (and possibly failing) to keep this brief.  I think Connery gives a better performance here than YOLT. I think that's because he's got more to say, and better things too. Maibaum really knew how to write a cracking Bond script, as seen in previous entries. Don't know what bits he and Mankiewicz were responsible for though.  So yeah, saying this is a bad film because it's campy comes off as more of a misdiagnosis. There's room for serious Bonds, campy Bonds, Bonds split down the middle. It all comes down to execution.  Post-Note: Why does Bert Saxby try to kill Willard Whyte anyway? Blofeld told Bond pretending to be Saxby to kill him, then he called Metz telling him to advance their operation. Did he call Saxby later? Any theories on that?"

Things have been so wrapped since the Sony leaks anyway I wouldn't think that something as basic as this would be leaked so early anyway."

JamesBond,3d45kr,Kunt-FILM,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:23:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah seems super flimsy, but interesting none the less.  Last I checked, someone interviewed Sam Smith regarding the rumor that he was to sing the theme for ""Spectre"" which he denied, but then claimed he heard that Ellie Goulding was supposed to do it. That interview has since been taken down.  Not sure exactly what this means, but Sam Smith is definately not a reliable source when it comes to who is doing the theme song. Not saying he is wrong, but until we hear it from MGM or a producer on the movie, I'd chock it up to just simple rumors.  I've spent the past few minutes researching the rumor that Ellie was going to do it... two of the articles were taken down, and the third...  It says that on July 9th, Ellie tweeted ""Live and Let Die"", making people assume that it is some kind of cryptic message regarding her involvement. Not exactly sure if I believe that, but it does make you think. Maybe she is just screwing with us, though?"

JamesBond,3d1zz5,Jobbo_Fett,2,Sun Jul 12 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"I heard Grant Kirkhope (composer for the game) say it was actually because it was rather new territory for everyone at the time. The game started as something entirely different. I think it was going to be a rail shooter at some point or something but at any rate the project eventually became something more ambitious. So it basically just took them a long time.   There was also setbacks with the soundtrack because they were not given licensing rights for any music, hence all the music sounding similar to Bond music but not exact. For example, Frigate La Fayette has elements of the themes from License to Kill, View to a Kill, Goldfinger, and a higher tempo version of the percussion from ""We Care A Lot"" by Faith No More.   I believe it also wasn't supposed to have multiplayer at all and it was on a whim IIRC that they decided to go forward with it. Ergo, more setbacks. Can you imagine? Goldeneye without multiplayer. Many would argue that that is what MADE the game. Certainly made it a success. And clearly what made it so influential.   That's all I remember. It was literally just not made in time.   Edit - spelling"
JamesBond,3d1zz5,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 13 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this was a deciding factor at all, but the SNES was near the end of it's product cycle in Fall 1995, and the N64 was still a year away.  Releasing a licensed game for an obsolete system would have hurt Rare's reputation as one of the best developers in the business at the time."

I think the latest novel, Trigger Mortis will release close to Spectre. But if you haven't read the Fleming books, I'd go with those. I read the first two and they're pretty enjoyable.   I'll refer you to this link posted by another user: http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/07/warren-ellis-to-pen-james-bond-007-for-dynamite-entertainment.html  Otherwise I don't think they will connect with anything out right now. They seem to be self-contained. There's six omnibuses of the James Bond comic strip adaptation out now that are really fun if you want something a little classic. I bought them a while ago and I would suggest those if you like to collect or appreciate the literary Bond of old."

JamesBond,3cwzym,waynezii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"On YouTube, there's a user called Bond Audiobooks with previous BBC Radio adaptations - Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with the current cast, and an adaptation of You Only Live Twice from the '90s - and a rather interesting documentary about Ian Fleming and Bond called The Last Englishman, as well as some audiobooks. There are some other ahem alternative means of acquiring them, but those YouTube videos are there if you prefer them!  Those are great adaptations. I was a bit iffy on Stephens' portrayal at first, but I got past it after the first 10-or-so minutes of the first dramatisation I heard (in many ways, his job his harder than portraying Bond in live action, since he has to convey all of Bond's charisma, aggresion, kindness, intelligence and ruthlessness using only his voice. Which is a rather daunting task when you think about it). The only downside is that they don't crank these adaptations out fast enough!"
JamesBond,3ctj5o,akanefive,11,Fri Jul 10 17:33:17 2015 UTC,Nautical Bond! This look is great.  My least favourite is probably Moore's safari suits. Not a fan.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,GetFreeCash,5,Fri Jul 10 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"That's good, but I think Brosnan's best suit is in The World Is Not Enough.  Totally agree on the Moore safari look. That 70's thing where the pants and the shirt were the same color just doesn't age well."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,9,Fri Jul 10 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"I dunno, Dalton sure is a close contender for the best tie-less look."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,6,Fri Jul 10 18:55:13 2015 UTC,That is a good look - Dalton's suits in Licence to Kill are all enormous though.

JamesBond,3ctj5o,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Fri Jul 10 17:52:12 2015 UTC,That cut looks so dated already.

JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,2,Fri Jul 10 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"I pretty much have that exact outfit. Chinos, blue shirt and a thrifted navy double breasted (my crown jewel from Value Village) and it maks me feel badass.  One of the most under-stated outfits is Dalton's grey flannel suit that I think he wears in like, one shot, in Daylights while watching Kara Milovy rehearse."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,MegatronsAbortedBro,18,Sat Jul 11 15:20:15 2015 UTC,This one is dope. Over 50 years old and would still be in style toady.   I can't tell if I love or hate the cream blazer.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,10,Fri Jul 10 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"The tux is a whole new animal. As far as formal Bond goes, it's iconic. Although it's hard to deny the modern cut of Craig in a tux."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,MegatronsAbortedBro,4,Fri Jul 10 18:49:52 2015 UTC,I feel like the first one is a suit but I may be wrong. The second is def a tux tho.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,7,Fri Jul 10 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"The first is a suit, the second is a tuxedo."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,GetFreeCash,5,Fri Jul 10 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"I would call the grey one a three piece suit, no? I mean he's wearing it casually. Vests can be casual."

JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,4,Fri Jul 10 19:46:27 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of both - though I don't think you can really get away with a cream dinner jacket in 2015.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,Alexedward00,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:05:30 2015 UTC,That grey suit is only in style again because mad men brought back early sixties fashion 7 years ago. But I do agree that it is probably the best suit until at least the brosnan years.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,jamedudijench,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:55:51 2015 UTC,Goldfinger is the reason I've always wanted a grey suit.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,MauriceEscargot,6,Sat Jul 11 12:28:04 2015 UTC,"Favorite would be Connery's gray three piece from Goldfinger. Least would be something of Brosnan's, I just don't find the cuts very appealing. He could rock a tuxedo though.  Also, apparently unpopularly, I LOVE most of what Lazenby wears. OHMSS is really the only time we see the insane late sixties aesthetic unbridled in a Bond film and I love every second of it."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,Valorou5,2,Fri Jul 10 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, suits in the late 80s and 90s tended to be big and boxy, which is a shame. Brosnan's suits were mostly ok, but still too big for my tastes.   I'm with you on Lazenby. Mayve the tux shirt is a little too ruffled, but otherwise, there are a lot of looks in that movie that toe the line between mod and classic, and I like it."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,kidneyboy79,5,Fri Jul 10 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"I think my least favorites come from Lazenby. The ruffles especially. Now the kilt is actually fine, I mean it fits his heritage so it's fine by all accords. But that late sixties-early seventies into Moore was just a bad time for formal attire.   Brosnan wore some good stuff and Craig is built to fill out a suit. Connery came from a very classy period. I love him in a hat."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,HaroldPelham,6,Fri Jul 10 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"The ruffles aren't great, but Lazenby has an awesome navy blazer, and one of my favorite three-piece suits."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,danbrag,5,Fri Jul 10 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"Those are both great. He looks like a gangster in that second one.  ""I'm still lookin' fer Blofeld, seee?"" ""That Moneypenny sports a keen pair of gams, seeee?"""
JamesBond,3ctj5o,BladeRunnerOO8,6,Fri Jul 10 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"I think that's half the suit, and half Lazenby's impressive chin."

JamesBond,3ctj5o,Tony_M_Cannoli,5,Fri Jul 10 20:02:38 2015 UTC,"I am a fan of Bond dinner suits particularly Craig era, I really liked Macau Dinner suit from Skyfall, however George Lazenby tuxedo looks just terrible"
JamesBond,3ctj5o,jp23,8,Fri Jul 10 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"That's Lazenby in a kilt, not a tux."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,HaroldPelham,7,Fri Jul 10 19:21:44 2015 UTC,The midnight blue tux is very cool.
JamesBond,3ctj5o,rap31264,5,Fri Jul 10 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"I really like Connery's gray suit from From Russia with Love: http://i.imgur.com/YYbbG8N.jpg http://i.imgur.com/a2DEKwz.jpg  it's pretty similar to the three-piecefrom Goldfinger, but seems lighter and as if it could be easily worn today on a regular basis."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,Dovahkiin_Vokun,4,Fri Jul 10 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, this is my favorite. (Three piece, no surprise.)  And this is my least favorite."

Of course, they ruined it by putting him in a different suit for the opening scenes of Quantum of Solace, which are supposed to take place right after Casino Royale."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,wkfink,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:39:48 2015 UTC,The only thing those two suits have in common is that they are both three piece suits. That's it. Every single Bond actor has worn three piece suits.

It's hard to really say because each actor pulled off a suit differently and usually did a good job of making the most ugly outfits look decent."
JamesBond,3ctj5o,wkfink,3,Sat Jul 11 10:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'll go with pinstripe three-piece suit, certainly one of the best suits Craig attired as 007. Skyfall gray suit looks good too but was unnecessary slim and short."

He's charming and has a bit of swagger, while also portraying some real vulnerability during the escape from Piz Gloria and the final scene. If anything, he was hampered by some really strange directorial decisions by Peter Hunt: overdubbing him when he's undercover, and not using the take where he cried after Tracy's death. (Though my understanding is that Cubby told Hunt that ""James Bond doesn't cry."") He was certainly a diva on set, and I think that fact can color appraisals of his performance."

For example in Dr. No you'll notice that Bond gets a new weapon because of what happened on his last mission.  That mission was in From Russia, With Love.  In Live and Let Die Leiter says the CIA ""thought we did all right together on the Casino job"" referring to Casino Royale.  It's nothing you'll get confused over, especially if you've seen the movies, but a nice touch if you know it.    There are a few more spoilerish ones I won't go into.

JamesBond,3cf5qm,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Tue Jul 7 12:56:09 2015 UTC,"They have been creating new Bond stories since, almost, the beginning really.  The book Bond and the film Bond have always been different in some ways.  It just depends on how the character is created for the screen, how the actor portrays him, the time period in which the movie is made, etc.    I don't think it's a problem, though.  At this point, Bond has become something beyond just the books.  In fact, most people have probably never read one of the books or maybe even know they exist.  As long as it maintains that feeling of making me feel like I'm 12 again, wanting to drive really fast and sneak around corners with a pistol, I think I'll be happy.    Of course they could always make another Moonraker and devastate me haha.  One thing I will add, and something which I think the Craig films attest to, is that Bond is better as a man than as a superman.  Keep him real, able to get hurt, struggling to overcome.  Don't give him Batman's utility belt and Neo's ability to dodge bullets.  I want him to be a flawed character, much like he is in the books."
JamesBond,3cf5qm,Indosay,2,Tue Jul 7 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"I like the 'human' aspect too. He gets cut, burned, shot up and mentally strained. Having that done to him, you can see why he has the....proclivities he has with the multiple women and drinks and gambling."
JamesBond,3cf5qm,usernamenotvalid4565,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:10 2015 UTC,I have just finished reading Moonraker and thought it was fucking great and the most thrilling of the first 3 books.  The films don't always stick to the novels storylines page to page anyway so if the franchise is to continue with truly original storylines and content then it will no doubt continue to be a success as it already is proving to be.
JamesBond,3cf5qm,ColonelDredd,2,Tue Jul 7 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"For the longest time I was convinced we'd more or less run out of Fleming material until I got back into reading all of his OO7 stories a year or so ago.   There are massive portions of many of the original novels that haven't been touched, like TSWLM and MR, even MWTGG and DAF only really used portions of the overall plot and a few characters and locales. YOLT is another example, outside of Blofeld, Tiger and Japan, the film plot is totally original. Short stories too; the entire short story of FAVTAK would make for a pretty badass pretitle sequence.   Outside of LTK, the Craig series' tone has never been closer to the Fleming-penned James Bond stories.   If Babs and Mikey G. had the desire, we could get really interesting updates of lots of original novel material in the films. Imagine Craig's Bond in a film or two manages to track down a reclusive Blofeld to Japan and sets out to finally dispatch him, only to discover he's been operating a suicide forest (or garden among his estate) as a sick hobby. It needn't be a central plot point, but it's definitely something that could be built into the narrative."
JamesBond,3cf5qm,essentialsalts,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:16 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with AVTAK, that would be a bad-ass opening bit."
JamesBond,3cf5qm,007Dossier,2,Wed Jul 8 13:03:36 2015 UTC,"The Bond that's been portrayed on film has basically gotten a soft reboot every time a new actor stepped into his shoes, not to speak of the hard reboot for Casino Royale, or the little revisions in the tone of the films - consider the more light-hearted, flippant tone that Connery films evolved into, and which reached a fever pitch in Diamonds Are Forever (probably so that audiences would forget about the seriousness of OHMSS), or Moore's more serious take on Bond in For Your Eyes Only following the sillier Moonraker.  The character has never been portrayed consistently, which is a something of a feat when you consider that the same people, more of less, have been managing the franchise since day one. At the beginning, the series seemed to be (somewhat faithfully) adapting the Bond of the novels to the screen (Dr. No thru Thunderball), and it has returned to what is at least a similar tone, or similar characterization for Bond, at times (Timothy Dalton's Bond, for instance). But the character of Bond in the Craig-era, while he is perhaps more of a character and a better one at that than Brosnan's, is not really the literary Bond. So really, anything could happen, but the character's never consistently emulated the source material for his portrayal anyway, and he certainly is a far cry from the literary Bond now."
JamesBond,3cf5qm,GetFreeCash,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:37:28 2015 UTC,"With the exception of Casino Royale they ran out of major material years ago. There are still bits and pieces of Fleming, such as used in Skyfall, but there is no real substance unused."

JamesBond,3cbfyh,ColonelBrutus,12,Mon Jul 6 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"Wait, so Die Another Day is more highly rated than TWINE, TMWTGG, Moonraker, Octopussy, and AVTAK? WTF?"
JamesBond,3cbfyh,Indycoone,10,Mon Jul 6 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, TWINE is pure shit, Golden Gun is underrated, Moonraker is a cheese-fest, Octopussy and View to a Kill are just boring as fuck. The first half of Die Another Day (before they get to the ice fortress) is classic Bond and the ridiculous second half is at least enjoyable."
JamesBond,3cbfyh,Swamp85,8,Mon Jul 6 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"My problem with DAD was that when you remove the fun action it's all just ""it would be cool if"" production writing, quality, and direction. In addition to that, the entire movie was just a badly-built reference machine.   Bond has never remembered for being ""realistic,"" but when you just take every memorable thing from every movie and roll it up into one, it's just one big clusterfuck of ridiculousness. Bond movies are about suspending some disbelief - not all of it.  TWINE, on the other hand, I hated the first time watching it. Since then I've seen it a number of times and I've changed my opinion completely. Sure, Denise Richards sucks badly, but beyond her, they had a pretty complex plot and probably the most intelligent, beautiful, and manipulative Bond girl ever. So it's not a perfect Bond movie by any means, but there's elements to definitely appreciate when you notice them (takes a few watches to see it all)."
JamesBond,3cbfyh,Indycoone,3,Mon Jul 6 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"True. I think DAD is a shitty movie, and I may have been more disappointed in TWINE than anything else (fuck all you on here who said it was your second favorite Brosnan movie, that's undoubtedly Tommorow Never Dies)"
JamesBond,3cbfyh,Swamp85,2,Mon Jul 6 22:38:00 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow Never Dies is a lot of fun at times, but the problem for me is the villain and his plan. Anybody hired by a news mogul or news channel likely isn't willing to be a henchman and kill people. It's like if a daycare center had its own mafia - it's just not convincing.  The modernization of Bond versus GoldenEye is more attractive and opens more doors, but I felt as if the director made some mistakes in terms of acting and editing. Two particular (small or large) qualms I have with it are Jonathan Pryce's acting (he's a fantastic actor, but did absolutely terrible in TND) and the choice for the opening song.   KD Lang's ""Surrender"" was going to be the opening song until the last few weeks of editing when the production crew decided on Sheryl Crow's version alternate song instead. Previously deleted videos on YouTube had KD Lang's song edited perfectly into the opening credits and gave new life to the visuals. Crow's song was clearly an afterthought in comparison and a quick addition at the last moment.  I think TND was a lot of fun, but the villain's background and his evil plan just seemed too outlandish for me in a 1990's environment. It could have been improved with an even darker twist on the motivations of the villain, but the ""China denied viewing rights so I'm going to start a war with them"" is rather stupid. At that point it's not scary and just makes the villain look childish as opposed to cunning.  That's my 2 cents. Still a decent watch."
JamesBond,3cbfyh,Indycoone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:26:35 2015 UTC,What do you mean about the henchman part? I can't remember but weren't the henchman just henchman and the journalists just journalists (who were unaware of how they got the news)?
JamesBond,3cbfyh,Swamp85,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:39:48 2015 UTC,I bring it up because clearly Elliot Carver traveled a lot and all the people that followed him were either heads of staff or henchmen. A big name CEO of a global media company can't just have that without everyone noticing. At the beginning we see the screen of his employees all talking about news in the world (presumably things they engineered). To find heads of staff like that 100% ok with journalism through the slaughter of hundreds of people just isn't believable.  Journalists who are part-time mercenaries? I can't buy it.

JamesBond,3cbfyh,GetFreeCash,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:32:57 2015 UTC,"I recall people really loving DAD when it came out. Keep in mind, this  and XXX starring Vin Diesel were really the last of the 90's action movies, which peaked with Face/Off in 1998. Where Face/Off was just in your face with it's complete lack of reality, Die Another Day tried to have it both ways. Couple that with the nostalgia of it being the 20th film, and I think reviewers were in a good mood because of it. Of course, I don't think anyone really realized what a modern Bond film could be until Casino Royale, which skews how we look at Die Another Day now."

JamesBond,3cawul,hitalec,4,Mon Jul 6 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting to look up Ellis' old blog post from 2002  There are very few existing properties that I’d be interested in writing. I like making up my own stories. As far as I’m concerned, that is in fact the job description of “writer”. There aren’t many pre-existing characters that I could be tempted with. I’ve resisted the temptation to do 2000AD properties I remain fond of; I couldn’t do JUDGE DREDD better than John Wagner, and, in fact, neither can anyone else, so I’ve denied myself the pleasure of solving story structures by having a huge bastard in green boots walk in and kill everybody. A JUDGE DREDD/TRANSMETROPOLITAN crossover book was suggested to me by DREDD publishers Fleetway once. I told them that it would be precisely one page long. Spider Jerusalem lights a cigarette. Judge Dredd shoots him. The end.  But if someone asked me to write a James Bond film, you wouldn’t see my arse for dust.  Sad, innit?  I’ve read most of the Ian Fleming novels, seen most of the films once they’ve come to TV. I’m not a fanatic by any means. But James Bond exerts a terrible fascination nonetheless. I even did an interview piece on how I’d write Bond for a Texan newspaper a couple of years ago. So did Bruce Sterling, who offered a disturbing opinion about Bond as a shaven-headed Ibiza DJ. You’re going to hell for that one, Bruce, and you will discover that Satan is English.  The books are notably less spectacular and far more low-key than the films. Dr No was a crazed guano millionaire and had no nuclear missiles, spaceship-eaters or any of the good stuff we associate with Bond Villains. Tiger Tanaka’s great test of Bond was making him compose a naff haiku. It’s often quite bland stuff, great long travelogues and pages describing banquets and furniture. In the guts of it, though, is Bond as a scarred man with clear psychological damage, often on the edge of being removed from service by M on mental health grounds. It’s made stridently obvious that being on the 00 detail of the Secret Service is a job that fucks you up.  Bond is not a superman. He prevails because he is quite simply nastier and more determined to wreak utter bloody havoc than the next guy. In some ways — and I don’t think Fleming was unaware of this — he is what Allen Ginsberg called “bleak male energy,” causing and taking immense damage in single-minded pursuit of what he wants. At the conclusion of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the front end of his personality essentially rubbed out by torture, drugs, multiple trauma and a sequence of horrible mental hammerblows, there is an almost disturbing glimpse of an amnesiac Bond as gentle, open, devoted, and almost sweet. And his lover dreads the day that he recovers.  He is England’s blunt instrument of international assault — the spiteful, vicious bastard of a faded empire that still wants the world to do as it’s bloody well told.  Most importantly; he beats people up and makes stuff explode.  The films try to recoil from Bond the bastard, most obviously in the later, parodic Roger Moore horrors. But in Connery, in Dalton and even in Pierce Brosnan, Bond’s essential ruthlessness comes through. Wolf-eyed Timothy Dalton had the best shot at being truly frightening, but he was hamstrung by some horrible scripts, and I’m surprised he lasted as long as he did. Clive Owen is pretty much the only choice to take over after Brosnan, and I’d assume that a serious overhaul of the franchise would have to accompany that.  I can be contacted via agent Angela Cheng Caplan at The Cheng Caplan Company, if there are any producers on serious medication out there. Because both me and Bruce were right; James Bond needs to reflect his times.  But I wouldn’t make him a DJ.  And stuff would blow up really good.  Yes.  I think maybe I need another drink now."

Supposedly Lazenby himself also wanted to do more ""avant-garde"" films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or Easy Rider (which both came out also in 1969), and thought that his new fame as Bond would help him get those sort of roles.  It is really too bad that we only have OHMSS to show for his work. Would have liked to see other things from Lazenby."

The film features some of the most breathtaking and marvelous views, unlike its preceding films. The action sequences were great, only the ski-chase alone was such an intense scene. We finally got to see the emotional side of Bond. Tracy is my second fave Bond girl. And my god that ending! It took me completely by surprise."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,akanefive,2,Mon Jul 6 10:35:31 2015 UTC,"There's plenty to appreciate. Love the theme song. It's just so Bond in its structure. One of my absolute favorites, if not the favorite. It brought new elements and themes and tones to the character and franchise. It broadened the appeal of Bond as a character with depth and not just a mechanism to advance the plot. It stands as a forerunner and prototype for Casino Royale released decades later. And also a testament to the success that a personal Bond story can have. It took risks and in the end has proven to pay off."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,jamedudijench,2,Mon Jul 6 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"It's really the first movie about James Bond. Perhaps Lazenby couldn't quite do all the heavy lifting that was required, but he came really close."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,akanefive,3,Tue Jul 7 13:29:37 2015 UTC,Agreed. His chops weren't there but to be able to look back at a movie with so much going against it and say that it is actually quite a profound film in the series is a wonderful accomplishment.   It's my Zelda II argument. It was perhaps overly ambitious in trying to outdo it's predecessor and was not so well-received at the time but it contributed much to its franchise and has garnered appreciation and a following in recent years.
JamesBond,3c9rkn,jamedudijench,3,Tue Jul 7 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"The other thing to remember is that replacing the lead actor in any film series was unprecedented back then. Happens all the time now, but nobody really knew how to deal with it in 1969. It's really that much more remarkable that the film works as well as it does. (Which is really well.)"
JamesBond,3c9rkn,akanefive,3,Tue Jul 7 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of that. In fact, come to think of it, I can't think of any/many films at the time that could be considered franchises. Is James Bond the first big time serial franchise? I mean there's Godzilla. That's older and has more films but as far as Western cinema goes, I think James Bond is unprecedented in its sequel format. Could I be wrong? But your point about new actors is spot on. That would be like having Clint Eastwood play The Man With No Name is the two Dollars movies and then replacing him with Charleton Heston or somebody."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,jamedudijench,3,Tue Jul 7 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's the first feature film series. There had been serials before, but those were more like episodes of television shows (before those existed) that aired in movie theatres once per week, rather than two hour films released once every year or two.  So yes, they were really blazing a trail when Connery left."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,broadfuckingcity,3,Tue Jul 7 14:28:35 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. The early, early Batman serials come to mind and Flash Gordon and all that. Back when pocket change could last you a whole day and then some. Yeah I meant those aside because of their otherwise low budget. But in terms of blockbuster type sequel cinema, James Bond definitely has to be the precedent. Because we see it now, with the aforementioned Batman for example, in these long running franchises,New actors must continue the role and it often throws people off. But James Bond did it first. The Simpsons of movies."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,jamedudijench,3,Tue Jul 7 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"Not an English language series but the Zatoichi films were around in 1969. In fact, nearly 20 had been released by then."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,broadfuckingcity,2,Fri Jul 10 10:17:46 2015 UTC,"That's cool. I just checked them out. I've not heard of that franchise before. Like I said, I mentioned Godzilla so that is definitely a valid entry."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,jamedudijench,3,Fri Jul 10 10:38:53 2015 UTC,"Some are better than others but they're solid adventure films. You could do worse in terms of samurai/Westerns.  If you recall that Rutger Hauer vehicle ""Blind Fury"" from the 80s, it was actually a remake of one of the Zatoichi movies."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,pickelsurprise,2,Sat Jul 11 01:08:59 2015 UTC,"Slightly. Yeah, that happened often I think. Like Fistful of Dollars just being a remake of Yojimbo. They seem cool. Stuff that I like to watch."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,Alexedward00,2,Sat Jul 11 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"I saw this one relatively late in the game, not until my dad bought the (at the time) complete Bond collection on DVD. I think it just kind of flew under the radar since it wasn't Connery, Moore or Brosnan. I didn't really know what to make of it at first, but I think it grew to become one of my favorite films in the series. I should probably try to get my hands on it and give it another go, since it's been a while since I last saw it.  One of my favorite things about it is definitely the main theme. I don't mind that it's not lyrical or anything, but it's cool and catchy. I still remember the first time I saw a trailer for The Incredibles, and I instantly recognized they were using the OHMSS theme for whatever reason. Funnily enough, the actual Incredibles theme ended up having some similarities to the OHMSS theme anyway. ""We have all the time in the world"" has become one of the most recognizable lines from the franchise. It's interesting how much influence this film has had despite being so underrated and underwatched."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,MyNameIsBobH111,2,Mon Jul 6 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"I like everything regarding the movie except the chemistry between Bond and Tracy, this movie would be much better if they had a chemistry like Bond and Vesper"
JamesBond,3c9rkn,scozzie,2,Mon Jul 6 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"When I was 14, Casino Royale was released and pretty much was nothing less than life changing. I had been a Bond fan, but that movie blew the doors down. I decided it was time I did my first proper sit through of every Bond movie.  So when I finally got to OHMSS, I entered with some trepidation. I hadn't seen all of them, but I had seen most, and I knew this was the weird one with the weird guy who sucked so bad he only did it ONCE. Naturally, I avoided it for much of my life until this point, but I gave it a spin.  I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. Even though I knew the twist at the end, I fell in love with Tracy and felt utter sorrow when she met her death. Telly was an awesome Blofeld...nothing at all like a cliched Dr. Evil type, but a real menace.   And Lazenby? Pretty solid job. The first half I was pretty darn skeptical, but then again, I had just seen Casino Royale in the theaters with much of the same arm-crossed-stubbornness...only to be blown totally away. It was the same here.   ""I'll see to this appointment, then catch up with you."" ""Story of our life, James?"" ""Just keep my martini cool""   I was totally sold after that. Then the skiing, the fighting, and the plot was just so damn good, too!   A lot of people ask the great What If...what if Connery was present? I'm not so sure it would have been as heartfelt as this film is. His Bond is a bit more blase, cold, and fun, which is good for him, but not for this story. Still, if the new Craig films were to take elements from here and update, it'd be absolutely wonderful...but this film will always remain a classic in action thrillers.  So yeah, it's pretty good!"
JamesBond,3c9rkn,akanefive,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:44 2015 UTC,"Dat score - in my top 3 Bond themes, no question.  Love this movie - it just ""worked"". Has all the Bond elements, and they all come off. it's very much like the book Bonds."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,xjortsu,2,Tue Jul 7 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"I could go on and on about how much I love this movie. The Alps, the action, the music, the editing, the script, yes, even the acting. I think it's a resounding success through and through.  But in watching all the films consecutively (which I've never actually done until now), I was really struck with how this felt like the culmination of each of the films that had come before it. Starting with the title sequence, with the coat of arms, the hourglasses, and the clocks spliced in with the shots from the previous films, I just sensed that the filmmakers were really going for broke on this one in a way that they hadn't yet. We see Bond in real trouble, and Lazenby's inexperience is a virtue here: he's unable to portray those moments of danger with the same coolness that Connery has. The result is that we see Bond sweat for the first time. So by the time he gets his happy ending, we feel like he's earned it. Not just because of the events of this movie, but because of all the events that have come before it. And then when it's taken away, it's really a kick in the stomach. It's a really shocking twist, and it's earned.  A couple other random thoughts:   The moment between Bond and Moneypenny at the wedding is really touching. Lazenby and Lois Maxwell had nice chemistry. The action in this is really exciting: the ski chases, the car chase, and the fighting really stand out. And the final attack on Piz Gloria is really well done. I mentioned the music above, but this is my favorite score. Berry's work on YOLT, OHMSS, and Diamonds Are Forever, is his best. The music while Bond is cracking Gumbold's safe is a standout track.   Seriously, I can't praise this one enough."
JamesBond,3c9rkn,Tony_M_Cannoli,3,Tue Jul 7 13:24:58 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the moment when Bond throws his hat to Moneypenny, agreed. It's very classy, and the look in her eyes - a mixture of happiness and regret - is unforgettable."

I still don't like Lazenby as Bond, but he grew on me by the end of the movie. Connery was a hard act to follow, but he did his best. Outside of him, the movie itself is one of the best Bond movies. Great cast, especially Diana Rigg, Gabriele Ferzetti, and Telly Savalas. The characters they play are also fantastic. It's beautifully shot and the music is some of John Barry's best. And the stunts. They are fantastic, especially all the sky chases. The way those were shot is insane.   The script is also really good, very similar to the book, in tone especially."

Apparently he and Craig Ferguson are friendly, and used to go to each other's houses occasionally. I read that article and saw all the stuff he went through as a child and really admire his ability to carry on in the face of adversity. Although he wasn't given the best movies after Goldeneye, he had some brilliant moments in all of them. I especially appreciated his ability to go deathly cold and ruthless when he needed to. Here's a cool video that showcases that in Brosnan's Bond kills. Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6UZDTpC6fY"

JamesBond,3c7k5r,Alexedward00,3,Sun Jul 5 18:33:17 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say he was unable to meet his own standard. I put that more on the writers than Brosnan. It seemed like the writers started caring less and less with each successive movie.

Nightfire was... okay... Agent Under Fire/GoldenEye 64/GoldenEye: Rogue Agent didn't really have themes. Goldeneye: 007 (2010) used the Tina Turner theme, 007 Legends used an instrumental of the Goldfinger theme.  So all in all, the games have a decent track record if they actually include a theme.  Three great originals, three without any at all, two reworkings of classics, and one meh."

The Aston's engine revving, then quick but easy to follow cuts between Bond cutting through traffic being followed by minions with machine guns. The truck slams into the wall, causing part of the front bumper to catch the Aston's door and Bond spins the car to tear it off. The whole thing is just so exciting and well-shot and gorgeous. And, to top it all off, Mr. White was in the trunk the entire time.   Bond movies have had a lot of famously great openings, but QoS was and remains my favorite. Here it is."

JamesBond,3bzvl2,visualsapling,5,Fri Jul 3 14:30:37 2015 UTC,"Their love montage didnt really seal the deal for me, but after watching it a second time it made me realize this: in all the bond movies he never finds real love or even someone who can operate at his high intensity level, then meets her and he feels like he can be himself around her, shes not too imposing about his dark past, and she loves to adventure with him.   I may have fabricated a little of their emotions, but it totally works for me."
JamesBond,3bzvl2,CashleyPersia,2,Fri Jul 3 15:01:54 2015 UTC,Couldn't disagree more. Michael Reed's photography is stunning as is Armstrong's song; all the elements come together terrifically and it actually makes Bond and Tracy's relationship feel organic and authentic. In particular their final kiss under her dress on the beach really lingers with me. Personally I always have a big grin on my face throughout. I guess I'm a romantic at heart.

Plus that custom Toyota is a real beauty. This might be the second most iconic (not to be confused with best) Bond movie. At least in the Connery era."
JamesBond,3br23e,akanefive,7,Wed Jul 1 14:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are so many things about this movie that people associate with the whole series: Plesance's mincing portrayal of Blofeld, the volcano lair, the Bond girl mysteriously being in a bikini at unnecessary and inconvenient times, the piranhas. That it features all that spectacle and still manages to be coherent is an accomplishment."
JamesBond,3br23e,jamedudijench,8,Wed Jul 1 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think like 80% of Austin Powers comes from this movie alone. But it's true, it's a movie that can with be gotten through without much effort."
JamesBond,3br23e,akanefive,2,Wed Jul 1 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"Especially coming off of Thunderball, which I know is a favorite for a lot of people. But for me it just kind of felt like everyone in the series wanted to take a vacation and occasionally remembered they needed to be making a movie."
JamesBond,3br23e,jamedudijench,4,Wed Jul 1 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"Haha feel free to speak unkindly about Thunderball around me. It's not a favorite of mine. I was going to say the same thing actually, coming from TB, YOLT feels like a movie again. I've been downvoted for talking ill of the beloved Thunderball. Got lumped in as jumping on the Matt and Matt hate train, even though I thought it was paced poorly and underwhelming before even knowing what the hell a podcast even was."
JamesBond,3br23e,akanefive,2,Wed Jul 1 15:22:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, the plot for You Only Live Twice borrows heavily from Dr No, but I like that we don't know right away who's behind the stolen orbiters. I like that Bond has to do some detective work."
JamesBond,3br23e,jamedudijench,3,Wed Jul 1 15:27:09 2015 UTC,Right. And it speaks to the real life tensions being faced at the time between the world powers. Everyone thinks everyone is to blame. Which i think is one of the earliest instances of that in the film series? I can't remember. Anyway it's certainly significant.

Like what was Felix supposed to topple a world terror organization? I don't think so.   I think it was the Live and Let Die novel that really put it more bluntly and cynically that they had to outsource all this international work to British spies because, well, I guess we're just big, dumb, pig-headed Americans pew pew pew. But that's Fleming being Fleming i think lol."
JamesBond,3br23e,akanefive,4,Wed Jul 1 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"They tend to cast the Americans as the ""shoot first - questions later"" types.

I don't remember this being one of my favorites, but I definitely need to reevaluate it. The plot is big and crazy, but is grounded enough that it doesn't ever really get murky. (Aside from the scenes where Bond gets made over by women in their underwear, which... why exactly?) The production design is really above and beyond anything we've seen up to this point, and the action really matches. The battle in the volcano lair is really exciting, and the fight between Bond and the Osato henchmen on the roof is really well shot.   I also really like that this movie takes Bond into a more urban area for the first time. Tokyo really adds to the early scenes, especially compared to the earlier Bond films, which are fairly self contained. All in all, a pleasant surprise."

It has numerous parts that I can't help but laugh at - the part where they try to transform Connery into a Chinese man is just terrific.  It looks like they gave his skin a yelowish tinge and changed his eye shape a bit.  It was as true a transformation I have ever seen an actor undergo in a movie.  Connery is absolutely unrecognizable. /s  And Tiger Tanaka's line about how the Chinese women can't keep their hands off Bond because they have never seen a man with such a hairy chest.  Tanaka makes a remark about how smooth most Chinese men's chests are, to which Bond replies ""Bird not make tree in bare nest.""    And who can forget that Little Nelly scene?!

JamesBond,3bquws,TomJBeasley,2,Wed Jul 1 12:25:55 2015 UTC,"I think other than how blatantly expendable the female characters in this movie are, the script is fairly strong. I like Bond's relationship with Tiger, and the scene with Henderson is so strange that it works. Plus, this is a good example of the audience discovering the villain's plot at the same moment Bond does. I only wish they made more of the moment where Bond meets Blofeld, and his face is revealed."
JamesBond,3bquws,akanefive,2,Wed Jul 1 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"The moment where Bond meets Blofeld is an interesting one. In isolation and with hindsight, it feels enormous, but they make very little of it in the film."
JamesBond,3bquws,akanefive,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"Right? It's very strange. They've been building to it since Dr. No, and it's barely given a thought here.

JamesBond,3bquws,akanefive,2,Wed Jul 1 19:59:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like at least part of that is due to Dahl not being entirely down with how a film works. In a film, much more than a written story, the big moments have to feel big."

JamesBond,3bpen4,Fenderboy771,8,Wed Jul 1 02:15:00 2015 UTC,"I both love and sort of dislike this song. I find myself humming the intro to this song constantly. Ba da da dum, Ba da da DUM, DADA DADA! It drives my wife crazy.   I really like everything but the chorus. When White and Keys start singing together something just sounds... off. I've gotten kind of used to it, but it's still a little jarring.   The rest of the song though, I think is fantastic. I love the lyrics. I love the instrumentation. I would have loved it if parts of the song could have been incorporated into David Arnold's score much like he incorporated ""You know my Name"" throughout Casino Royale.   As far as QoS the movie goes. I hated the movie when I watched it in the theater, but upon repeat viewings it's become one of my favorite Bond films. There are a lot of layers to this movie that I didn't fully appreciate on my first viewing. I personally feel it accomplishes what Skyfall tried to do much more effectively than Skyfall."
JamesBond,3bpen4,Stringfellow__Hawke,5,Wed Jul 1 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"I really just don't like it. The instrumental is cool but their voices just don't mesh. And everyone likes to blame Alicia Keys for it but honestly I think Jack White is the songs main problem. When they sing on the chorus, they both sing the same high octave notes and it sounds like Jack is the one off, not Keys. I could be wrong though.  QOS is like the weird artsy stepchild of the Bond franchise."
JamesBond,3bpen4,Thedudeabides337,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"It feels like a good sequel to Casino Royale, but not so much like a Bond movie. I'm still not sure if that's to the film's detriment. I would agree that White doesn't help the song at all, but when it comes down to it, I'm just not am Alisha Keys fan. I felt like they were trying to recreate ""You Know My Name"" (which I really liked), but it didn't work.   Edit: Forgot to actually address my own topic"
JamesBond,3bpen4,akanefive,5,Wed Jul 1 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"It would have been a much better song if it was sung by Alicia Keys solo. If you're going to do a duet, the additional voice needs to add something to the song. That doesn't happen in Another Way to Die. If anything, Keys and White's voices are just similar enough that they grate against one another. Too bad, because I like the horn line and the distorted guitar."

If you watch Casino Royale there are some elements which, to Bond fans, play on their knowledge and familiarity with the character. It was nice for them to see how this new Bond iteration was going to be. But for a novice, I'd start with the 'real deal', the ones that made history. You can't go wrong with Connery, apart from Diamonds are Forever which is a camp charade in my opinion."

JamesBond,3bhmxm,avoritz,10,Mon Jun 29 08:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yes I do remember them.    They were the ones with standard 1 sheet poster artwork on the boxes, with a thin slight metallic border around them.  You would think that poster artwork would be common on the Bond VHS boxes, but it wasn't.  Previous CBS/Fox releases used some poster artwork, but often it was close-ups of certain elements.  I have no idea why they threw on a cartoon of the Pink Panther, perhaps it was to cross promote another franchise they owned, and to give buyers more content, and a slightly odd reason to get another version if they owned the old ones.  I'm pretty sure the Connerys and Lazenby's OHMSS also had the cartoons."
JamesBond,3bhmxm,thedangerman007,3,Mon Jun 29 11:32:34 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that Thunderball, at least, had one."
JamesBond,3bhmxm,the_masked_redditor,2,Mon Jun 29 19:04:14 2015 UTC,I think it may have had to do with them playing before movies at the theater in the old days.

JamesBond,3bgjzg,jarwlsh,20,Mon Jun 29 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"By accepting the role 007, Lazenby was also being the producers' guinea pig for how to introduce a new Bond."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,SMStanton,3,Mon Jun 29 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're pretty spot on, except for the fact that in OHMSS they go out of their way to show the audience that Lazenby is playing the same guy as Connery, and within the same continuity. All the previous films are shown in the opening credits, and referenced in the scene where Bond cleans out is desk. There's also a mention of Goldfinger toward the end of the film in a converstion between M and Draco.  I think in a lot of ways, the Craig series of films is what the producers have been trying to do since the late 60's, with a major difference being the fact that the (admittedly shaky) continuity in the series had been reset for Casino Royale."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,akanefive,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:26:14 2015 UTC,"hey go out of their way to show the audience that Lazenby is playing the same guy as Connery,   Except for the 4th wall breaking nod to the camera and ""This never happened to the other guy"" line.   OHMSS was weird. Cubby wanted to move away from Connery and show they didn't need him anymore. Yet they keep all the Connery era highlights in the title sequence for some odd reason (perhaps to show he's the same Bond character like you say)."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, they really try to have it both ways. They make a point to say that the series is about James Bond, not about Sean Connery, down to the producer credit they insert into the gun barrel sequence."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,akanefive,3,Tue Jun 30 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"I like the theory.  While the nods to the earlier films are nice, the inescapable continuity hole of Bond and Blofeld failing to instantly recognise each others, gives me the impression that there was a vague intention of aiming for a clean slate.  Not technically a reboot...but a way of mixing things up.  It was certainly less concise, less planned as a shake-up than Casino Royale and the result is neither one thing nor the other.  But ignoring the change of actors, the unusual plot of Bond falling in love...OHMSS ""feels"" different to everything that came before.  I found it quite jarring on first watch, as I later found Casino Royale on first watch. Neither seemed to be obeying the old formula.  Casino Royale is as different from Die Another Day, as OHMSS is as different from You Only Live Twice.  Continuity was certainly less important then (as there was little consideration that these films would be revisited for decades to come).  Peter Hunt even said in the scripting stage that OHMSS was intended to be a prequel to YOLT.  That makes little sense when you think about it, but gives an indication that there was no clear idea on continuity or ""maintaining"" the series."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,Dalton87,6,Mon Jun 29 21:36:31 2015 UTC,"I heard something recently I think is relevant:  When people rank the Bonds, I always tend to see Lazenby and Dalton toward the bottom of the list. I think this is because they never each for to do at least three movies. I think three is the magically number. People really seem to accept a new Bond actor after three films and the third film always seems to solidify them.   I don't think Connery was fully embraced until Goldfinger. Perhaps someone from the 60's and 70's can confirm that though. And Goldfinger is the best of his.   Moore wasn't fully accepted until The Spy Who Loved Me, and that film is, once again, the best of his and the third film he did.   Maybe the same can be said for Craig. I think most people consider Skyfall to be the best. Although personally, Casino Royale is my favorite.   I guess Brosnan doesn't apply. But I really think if Lazenby got to do two more, and if Dalton got to do one more, ranking the Bonds would be a lot more difficult."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,NerdBro1,24,Mon Jun 29 02:38:30 2015 UTC,"I think Dalton is underrated, and his movies are more a product of his era than anything else. I liked Brosnan until Craig showed up. Casino Royale is still my favorite Bond film."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,slapuwithafish,16,Mon Jun 29 05:39:25 2015 UTC,Dalton is Fleming's Bond (in my opinion).
JamesBond,3bgjzg,ManOfLaBook,8,Mon Jun 29 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"IMO Brosnan's best film was his first one, but this is also sort of true because of the loss in popularity of the 007 franchise after the Dalton era, it was the comeback fans had been waiting for"
JamesBond,3bgjzg,Antoniomike7,3,Mon Jun 29 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think Connery was fully embraced until Goldfinger    I talked to folks who were young when Goldfinger came out, they told me that they haven't seen anything like it in the theaters at the time. Much like The Matrix, for example or Avatar - it was something unique and new.    I guess Brosnan doesn't apply    Bond fans have been waiting for Brosnan to take on the role for a decade or so (thanks to NBC), so you're right, it doesn't apply. Personally I think Goldeneye is his finest movie."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,ManOfLaBook,3,Mon Jun 29 11:56:03 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with you my friend, FRWL is the most classic Bond movie of the franchise and certainly the best one for Connery!"
JamesBond,3bgjzg,Alexedward00,2,Mon Jun 29 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think Connery was fully embraced until Goldfinger.   Could also be because Bond movies had only just started in general. They took a big chance doing the first one, since it was unproven."
JamesBond,3bgjzg,shane0mack,2,Mon Jun 29 10:43:04 2015 UTC,"Your theory has merit. I think Lazenby would have clicked with the public had he stayed. I think he would have nailed DAF. I think Craig's best so far is CR far and away. I am flummoxed by all the love for Skyfall. I find it sleep inducing. Moore's third was great and some love Brosnan's third, but I think it's a bit dull. I do feel sorry for Dalton because I liked his Bond a lot but I didn't care for either of his films. As for Connery, I think his peak was Goldfinger. I was not old enough to know how his early films were received by the public but my father always said he was a hit right out of the gate."
JamesBond,3bh243,iamnotparanoid,11,Mon Jun 29 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"Mine was Brosnan in TWINE (the first Bond movie I saw in the cinema). Brosnan also has the honour of starring in the first Bond film I saw that I really liked, which was GoldenEye.  Unsurprisingly, I'm in my early twenties ATM."

JamesBond,3bh243,AirJordanFan93,2,Mon Jun 29 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, guess I'm not alone here. I came of age at Brosnan. TND was being heavily marketed at the time and of course Goldeneye for N64 goes without saying. At the time he defined the image of the super spy. I remember a featurette in this Disney kids magazine that previewed a few things from TND and they showed the cell phone and the BMW and of course from only having really known keepers and landlines, cell phones were a somewhat new concept to me. The fact that it had a screen and you could drive the car with it blew my mind. Good times, for sure."
JamesBond,3bh243,jamedudijench,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:43:39 2015 UTC,"I think it was The Living daylights, my dad rented it for me but I fell asleep after the first 15 mins ...but then I wanna say Goldeneye.   TWINE was my first bond experience in the theater. It was a great experience.I remember waiting so long to see another bond movie on the big screen and by the time die another day came out...I felt so heartbroken. I felt like I was watching a poorly made austin powers film. It took such a drastic twist in tone from the rest of Brosnans films. very disapointing. I do remember enjoying the opening scene. I thought we were in for a good bond film but then when he got captured an we saw him being tortured in the credits I felt something was odd an off about this...an slowly i kept getting more disappointed with this film.   It's weird...my dad introduced me to bond..took me to see TWINE an die another day...by the time Die another day came out, my family started slowly fading into divorce territory...and I believe this was the last time I went to the movies with my family. By the time Casino Royal came out we both were disinterested in the bond films. [ craig films ] so we never bothered an this is when hell really started happening with my family...but now things have cooled down...and Bond seems to be going back to the old formula...maybe this is a slow start to a more happy family along witih a more familiar bond tone.  just funny how things are in life.."
JamesBond,3bh243,avoritz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:23:23 2015 UTC,"My first Bond that I knowingly watch was Brosnan in GoldenEye. However, after getting into the series more I discovered that I recognised many of the scenes from older movies, having watched them with my Dad when I was young.

My big interest in Bond came from the Goldeneye N64 game, to which I then watched the movie and the rest is history. I took my wife (then-girlfriend) to Tomorrow Never Dies in the theater and we've seen every one there minus Casino Royale (scheduling/wasn't thrilled no Pierce).

JamesBond,3bh243,Badmecha007,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Goldeneye was the first Bond I watched in the Theater. I was mildly interested in Bond after watching the movie marathons they used to run on TBS, and while Goldfinger was the first Bond film I watched on TV, I liked the idea of 007 more than any of the actors who played him util I saw Brosnan's first ""Were you expecting someone else?"" trailer. I was immediately smitten. I begged my Mom to take me to see Goldeneye when it came out. And when I finally got to go, I became a full fledged Bond fan. Goldeneye seemed to have the perfect mix of action, suspense, and humor that I was looking for. Most importantly, the tone was consistent throughout the film. I walked out of the theater with a huge man crush on Brosnan that has stuck with me today. As a 14 year old kid, I thought he was coolest guy on the planet.   It's a bummer none of the other Brosnan films lived up to the awesomeness that was Goldeneye. Tomorrow Never Dies wasn't bad, but it just didn't live up to Goldeneye, and TWINE and DAD just got worse from there.   Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond these days, but Pierce Brosnan was my first, and he is still the first person I think of when I hear or read the name James Bond."

JamesBond,3bdkyw,avoritz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"thats so funny that you posted this...I literally was thinking about my old bond vhs collection an noticed i havent seen em since i moved...so i went to my old abandoned apartment an found all my vhs's in the basement...so glad theyre in perfect condition an still there! i would have been so depressed if they were gone...this was my childhood..bond was everything growing up...I'd always get a bond movie every christmas from my parents and I remember growing up my dad always took me to hollywood video/blockbuster where I always rented the bond movies. If anyone remembers, those copies always had the pink panther play before the film and I  would never fast forwarded them. For some reason it enhanced my bond experience.  Not to mention he would buy me kfc. or pizza . I cant think of any better feeling of growing up. I honestly believe I have better memories watching bond for the first time as a innocent child than hanging with fake friends from school. I cannot believe how much time has passed. I still enjoy watching bond but its just not the same as an adult. I miss that feeling so much.   Thanks for posting..between this an finding my old collection, its bringing a lot of great memories...an despite my parents split an bad blood in the family an all this drama from age 14- now [ 24 ] its reminding me for the first time ever in my life how great my childhood really was. Its crazy how once you become an adult you dont have much time to really think about the past and the great memories...For me personally its sad to see where we are in life right now. Not that things are as bad anymore, things are better than the last few years for certain but its scary an sad to think things will never be the way they were when we were kids. Sorry for the rant, a bit emotional at the moment."

JamesBond,3bc1b8,Alexedward00,0,Tue Jun 30 16:37:29 2015 UTC,One difference: Dalton <worked> as an emotional Bond.
JamesBond,3bc1b8,Maximus8910,3,Tue Jun 30 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"It seems that movie makers has already start working in it. The Bond   24 is titled as SPECTRE; an old school brutal and terrorist organization, I am also hoping that the movie will feature Bond's old arch-rival Blofeld too."
JamesBond,3bc1b8,sirgraemecracker,2,Tue Jun 30 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"They're definitely moving in a less realistic, more campy classic Bond direction.  Compare Skyfall to Casino Royale--you'd have never seen the Komodo dragon fight in Casino Royale; and suddenly in Skyfall the DB5 has all its gadgets back, whereas the closest Casino Royale got was having the defibrillator in the glove box.  The latest SPECTRE TV spot showed a flamethrower in the back of the new car.  I doubt they'll go as campy as Moore, but they're definitely going in a more gadget-friendly, Connery-esque direction."

JamesBond,3b9td7,jefftakeover,3,Sat Jun 27 03:59:25 2015 UTC,I do love the novels very much. How would a book club work?
JamesBond,3b9td7,technogeek,2,Sat Jun 27 04:40:31 2015 UTC,I'm thinking we would have a thread for discussing and all begin reading one of the books together. And maybe trade ones back and forth as well. To be honest any kind of interaction with others about the novels as I'm reading them would be amazing.
JamesBond,3b9td7,theholycannoli,3,Sat Jun 27 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"I would love to do that! This summer, I've been reading several of them! I was planning on posting some reviews when I was done! I think the novels (especially the continuation ones) don't get enough discussion here or anywhere else!"

Bond is a classic character at this point, in order to modernize him you need to make sure he's got cutting edge technology. If he's not got a phone that's at least comparable to the normal ones we all carry, can that actually be believable? Authors in the 80s didn't know how easy they had it."

JamesBond,3b9td7,GenTsoChickenX,4,Sat Jun 27 14:29:02 2015 UTC,"it'd be better to start at the beginning, i think. just go chronologically from Casino Royale forward by date of publication. that way things like the Blofeld Trilogy of Thunderball, OHMSS and You Only Live Twice will be in the right order, even if The Spy Who Loved Me is stuck in the middle of it, out of place.   then again, there's some scholar's chronology of Bond (wiki says it's by a guy named Griswold) that actually puts the Fleming writings in order of chronology but does weird things like break apart books into chapters. Not sure that's the best way to go about it for a book club.   Anyway, i've read all the flemings and some of the post-fleming ones too but would happily join a book club like this. they're great re-reads. Get those deets out there, OP."
JamesBond,3b9dc4,visualsapling,33,Sat Jun 27 01:21:20 2015 UTC,Which is part of what makes Skyfall refreshing - Bond is human
JamesBond,3b9dc4,torrunh,2,Sat Jun 27 02:20:58 2015 UTC,"I like the fact that they tried to make him human in Skyfall, but it's the ending that doesn't make sense. He never really redeemed himself. He failed and then kept failing. If you kidnap your boss, and then get her killed, you'd think you'd be fired, but Bond gets reinstated by the guy who doubted him the most in the middle of the movie.   New M: ""I didn't think you were up to that last mission, and I was right. You failed miserably. Are you ready for your next mission?"""
JamesBond,3b9dc4,Stringfellow__Hawke,3,Sun Jun 28 02:49:31 2015 UTC,I'd guess to MI6 successfully assassinating Silva outweighs what happened to Dench when the whole organization is on fire.
JamesBond,3b9dc4,BioSpock,2,Sun Jun 28 22:06:11 2015 UTC,I 100% agree the ending was extremely strange. I still think its the directors way of making him human tho - showing hes not perfect.
JamesBond,3b9dc4,torrunh,2,Sun Jun 28 08:33:19 2015 UTC,"My issues with Skyfall notwithstanding, I really do like how they have made Craig's Bond more vulnerable and emotional. He definitely seems like a fleshed out human being in all three of his films and less like a superhero. I hear a lot of people wanting to go back to the Connery or Moore style of films and I cringe. The Craig films have been the ones I've wanted ever since I started watching 007 films. I like the more serious tone."
JamesBond,3b9dc4,Stringfellow__Hawke,0,Sun Jun 28 18:57:35 2015 UTC,making Bond human is like making Han Solo gentlemanly

JamesBond,3b9dc4,doscomputer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"Which is what all are going to be from now on starting with at least Casino Royale. Quantum totally went 100% in the action side and they leveled it out with Skyfall. It was a great movie, but not a bond movie as we knew them."

JamesBond,3b9dc4,RodKimble_Stuntman,2,Sat Jun 27 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"Isn't that the general problem with 00-missions?   Yes you have to give them an objective to chase after but in the end the situation you send an 00-agent in is so unpredictable, dynamic and ever changing that the original objective  will become obsolete mid-way through the task.  That's why being a 00 is such an elite organisation and that's why they have so much autonomy. They are problem solvers. You send them in to an impossible situation, SHTF and the agents job is to secure UKs best interest in the outcome."

JamesBond,3b9dc4,Alexedward00,-6,Mon Jun 29 19:00:40 2015 UTC,Skyfall was only marginally less crap than Quantum of Solace. Don't try to read too much into a film which runs out of ideas so completely that it turns into Home Alone.

Ever since I could tell time, I've been obsessed with watches. I fell for the Omega product placement in Goldeneye hook, line, and sinker. I've loved Omega watches ever since seeing Brosnan use his Seamaster for the first time back in 1995. Regardless of the relationship to the Bond movies, Omega makes some of the best looking timepieces in my opinion.   Plus, the fact that Omega Speedmasters were the watches the astronauts took to the moon makes the watchmaker pretty badass in my book too.   A little more than a decade after Goldeneye came out, my wife gave me a blue Seamaster 300M as a university graduation gift (A massive surprise) and it really is a fantastic watch.

Plenty O'Toole and Jill Masterson were not at all like Vesper and very different themselves.  The early Bond girl profile was the clever glamorous girl who was attracted to a bad boy's charms - villain or not - and that being her demise.  O'Toole was even more removed from the plot than Masterson, simply mixing up with Bond in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Masterson (we get the feeling) knew what she was getting herself into... tangled between Goldfinger and Bond.  Vesper was a true walking dichotomy.  Clearly it was the writer's attempt to pander to the modern feminist view using a modified form of director Howard Hawks' ""Hawksian Woman"" profile.

JamesBond,3aqeb4,akanefive,0,Mon Jun 22 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"This is a really fair evaluation of the movie I think. I think this film really suffers from the fact that it's a James Bond movie, if that makes sense. They really spend a long time on Bond doing and saying cheeky things that don't really contribute to the story. (The main detractor is Bond tossing the flowers on the Spectre agent he had just killed in the opening-sequence.  Rather than focusing on the cohesion and tension throughout the movie, it almost seems like the filmmakers said ""We can't take that out, it will be such a cool moment,"" a half dozen times. If only 15-20 minutes were trimmed off this one, it would have been a classic."
JamesBond,3aqeb4,akanefive,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:30:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. I don't know what effect the legal wranglings had on the final movie. That could have been an issue?
JamesBond,3aqeb4,Jack_Sandwich,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"That's a really good question - I wonder how much say over the creative stuff Kevin McClory had.  Pure speculation here, but I also think that the filmmakers kind of reverse engineered the movie around the action sequences and cool stuff they could use. It's almost like they knew they wanted to end the movie with Bond and Domino on the SkyHook (which is unbelievably cool), and they went backwards from there."
JamesBond,3aqeb4,akanefive,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to criticize the movie for being too long and the editing is not great either but it's also got a lot to love. The script is much better than this reviewer gives credit for, the three girls are among the best in history, and the scenes between Bond and Largo are really well performed. Goldfinger might be the ""best"" but Thunderball is my favorite.   And the location! Does anything beat the Bahamas?"
JamesBond,3aqeb4,Jack_Sandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:18:58 2015 UTC,"I think Thunderball is a real missed opportunity. The story is good, the actors are well cast, and the location is top notch. But it's failed by the script. I said this in the other discussion, but my main problem with it is the lack of dramatic tension. We know more than Bond knows the entire movie, so when he discovers, for example, that Volpe is working for Spectre, it had been revealed to the audience almost an hour earlier. If they had trimmed some of her scenes, or reordered them, it would have been a much more exciting movie."
JamesBond,3aqeb4,akanefive,2,Tue Jun 23 13:24:12 2015 UTC,You're definitely right about the revealing facts. I think that goes back to editing too. There are continuity problems that clearly come from re-ordering the scenes. Day becomes night becomes day again. And Bond's wardrobe betrays this at times too.  Edit: I still consider it my favorite though. Just preference I suppose.

JamesBond,3apooc,akanefive,8,Mon Jun 22 16:22:57 2015 UTC,I think you can trim about 20 minutes off the movie and it becomes a top 5 entry. It's a really great interesting plot that suffers from a script that needed some editing.
JamesBond,3apooc,MotorcycleCK,5,Mon Jun 22 17:22:32 2015 UTC,"That makes sense about the timing. I also like that the bad guy's plot isn't terribly far-fetched (well, how they got the nukes is far-fetched, but what they did after isn't)."
JamesBond,3apooc,akanefive,9,Mon Jun 22 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"For the most part, I like to find things out as Bond finds them out. In this movie, we're like three steps ahead of Bond the whole time, so the tension is never there. Of course, it works well in From Russia With Love, because even though we know the plot, we're watching Grant watch Bond the whole time, just waiting for the two of them to collide. That element of danger is missing in Thunderball. Not because of the plot, but how the story was told."

The pre-credits scene is one of my favorites, it has two of the best-ever Bond ladies in Domino and Fiona Volpe, that classic ""hand me something to put on"" line and has the last good Connery performance before he started mailing it in in YOLT. The underwater fight/boat chase at the end is admittedly slow, but if you make an effort to follow along with it, there are some good moments. And the skyhook thing at the end is great, too."
JamesBond,3apooc,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:40:39 2015 UTC,I love Thunderball depending on my mood its usually #1 on my list of Bond films rotating with LALD.

Connery is at his best and peak in the role and I still think its his best performance as Bond. This would also be my favourite of the Bond scores all the John Barry work is amazing but this one stands out that little bit more.

Plus there had been a decent layoff time between bond films so it jumps ahead in production value a bit. It also had a lot of crazy action scenes that while not unknown to the bond series, really seemed wild. Driving a tank through Russia, etc. it still felt completely bond like to me though. Cold War implications, some time in the Caribbean, a good Bond girl and a Bond girl villain. Throwbacks to the older bonds. The humor was good while not getting too cheesy like the Moore movies did. It's tough to describe."

JamesBond,3ane6w,Kunt-FILM,2,Thu Jun 25 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"It's a classic. Bond had been off the radar for a while and they pulled out all the stops with Goldeneye and it shows. His popularity is about 50/50 here for some reason , but I think Brosnan was a great Bond and he was just what the doctor ordered. Goldeneye was pretty much pitch perfect."
JamesBond,3ane6w,sigersen,4,Mon Jun 22 11:59:34 2015 UTC,I think a big part may be Russia. It was filmed right after the end of the USSR and was the first bond film to actually film in Russia. Since then Russia hasn't really played a major role in a Bond film.
JamesBond,3ane6w,All_Seven_Samurai,0,Sun Jun 21 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"The Living daylights also had that sort of look as well, just not as grand. They filmed in Russia there ?"
JamesBond,3ane6w,RedditTipiak,2,Sun Jun 21 23:02:06 2015 UTC,"filmed in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia at the time."
JamesBond,3ane6w,All_Seven_Samurai,2,Mon Jun 22 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"I don't believe so. I was reading a book a few weeks ago talking about media in Russia and how it changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. It mentioned that before the fall, no Western film crews were allowed in and so any film set in Russia had to be filmed elsewhere. So Russia was mostly rural and when you saw Moscow or some other major city it was usually inside a building or on a set. So, a lot of movies were set in Russia just not filmed there.   Goldeneye was the first Bond film, not set in Russia, but shot there."
JamesBond,3ane6w,are_you_nucking_futs,2,Sun Jun 21 23:11:28 2015 UTC,Part of Goldeneye is set in St Petersburg.

JamesBond,3ane6w,karatemanchan37,3,Fri Jun 26 09:19:50 2015 UTC,"Everything just fell in place I think.  The cast all hit their marks: Brosnan was a great Bond. Sean Bean played a great villain. Amazing Bond Girl and femme fatale/henchmen by Isabella Scorupco and Famake Janssen.  Then the story was great too. Russians! A legitimate threat to destroy the world. But it also took steps to characterize Bond as well. Bond being double-crossed by his best friend! M calling him out as a relic of the Cold War. All plot points that only returned recently in the Craig era.  But it doesn't stop there. There's all those tiny details that makes the film perfect. Applicable but awesome gadgets. Action that isn't gratuitous. Humor in all the right places. A kickass Bond theme and a memorable score.  Add everything up, and it pretty much answers why Goldeneye was the perfect Bond film for the late 20th century."
JamesBond,3ane6w,Danjaqdvd,2,Mon Jun 22 02:07:41 2015 UTC,I think the Music to Goldeneye really suits its cold warish theme.. Definitely Brosnans finest.. The fight scene proved how tough bond should be and i for one was well impressed.. I never felt he quite hit the mark (or baddie) quite as hard again.

JamesBond,3apffm,JimCalinaya,3,Mon Jun 22 12:50:38 2015 UTC,"Elba is certainly the best contender for black Bond, if he is not then the only Chiwetel Ejiofor can sustain the character of Bond"
JamesBond,3apffm,Alexedward00,0,Mon Jun 22 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"Even leaving aside assessments of Elba's talents as an actor, he's pretty old.  Presuming filming would start in 2018, he would be 46 - just a year younger than Moore, and Moore's aging in the role was often cited as one of his problems as Bond.  Admittedly Elba is fairly young looking, but so was Moore at a similar age."

JamesBond,3apffm,flarkey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:10:18 2015 UTC,"Chiwitel Ejiofor has everything you'd want from a Bond.  He can be cold, he can be suave, and he can handle a challenging script if need be.  He's also able to blend in and let other actors shine, which is helpful if they were to cast a particularly good villain."
JamesBond,3apffm,DoubleCop,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"In no particular order, I'd think of Chiwetel Ejiofor, David Gyasi, John Boyega (maybe a bit young, but we are talking about a 2019 film) and Noel Clarke.  I like Richard Yearwood but he's too low profile.  Colin Salmond has been linked to the role in the past and had a small role in the Brosnan films, but he's probably too old now.  I'm pretty open to the idea of a black Bond, but I'm not a big fan of Idris Elba.  He'd bring the wrong kind of energy to the role.  Although what strikes me is why we so rarely hear about the idea of a Bond who's neither white nor black.  What about an Asian Bond?  There are nearly twice as many Asian British people than there are Black British.  And Raza Jaffrey's available."

JamesBond,3aj739,GetFreeCash,3,Sat Jun 20 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"Adele's ""Skyfall"" is one of the only things I actually like about the movie. I do think it was a bit lazy putting both ""sky fall"" and ""Skyfall"" as lyrics in the same song (it seems a bit too on the nose for me), but it stays true to the film's plot so it gets a pass. It's definitely one of my favorites of the Bond themes.   However, you can't really count my opinion:  ""You Know My Name"" is my favorite Bond theme, and I am one of the few (Or maybe only one) who really likes ""Another Way to Die"". And While I appreciate Bassey's ""Goldfinger"" I don't think it's all that it's cracked up to be."
JamesBond,3aj739,Stringfellow__Hawke,3,Sat Jun 20 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"It's a bit wallowy for my taste, but technically I think it's probably the best, standard Bond theme ever. There are better hooks out there though."

In ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" Bond adopts the undercover role of a genealogist because Ernst Stavro Blofeld (the head of SPECTRE) is researching his family line. Bond does some research on his own family and finds his family crest and motto. Which is 100% real. The filmmakers found a real Bond family line to tie James Bond to actual nobility.  And of course, years later, they released a film that was titled after Bond's family motto as a nod to that little factoid from long ago."

JamesBond,3aaqjp,Alexedward00,3,Thu Jun 18 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"I want an Ian Fleming James Bond. If we are about to reboot spectre, then I want a SMERSH ass kicker/Debonair/man's man who plays it cool all the time. A man who smokes a pack of cigarettes as he plays Goldfinger in a 10,000 pound golf game, and Bond can't lose. A man who can calmly interrogate the bastard who killed his psuedofather for some Nazi gold. A man who enjoys the finer things in life, the langouste, the tagliatelle verdi, the Dom and caviar. A man who would challenge a stocky Korean after he watched him chop threw a six inch stairrail. A tall, dark and handsome. Chizzled features, but a ""boy with age"" 28-34."

I don't care where the actors from. Canada, America, South Africa, I don't care.   An actor acts.   Good actor is number one and only for me. Where he's from or what his skin color is doesn't matter.   Actually, age matters,  a little. Late twenties, early thirties. Cause if they're good they can keep going.

JamesBond,3aaqjp,GetFreeCash,2,Thu Jun 18 17:18:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's important that the actor, if their natural accent isn't a British one, at least be able to affect a convincing British accent.

I'm fine with a non-white actor being cast in the part, though.

With that in mind, I have three criteria: - Born in the 1980s, making him somewhere between 30 and 40 years old. - Masculine features. - Not an A-list actor.  I don't mind so much if the actor himself is not English or even British (after all, there have been two non-British Bonds already), but they'll need to play Bond with an English accent."

The line ""No Mr Bond I expect you to die"" is a great comeback and said with such glee from Goldfinger that you can almost cant believe what Bond would will have to do escape.

Just so great, especially since the blu-ray release. Overall this is a top 5 Bond film."

JamesBond,3a1mo2,Kunt-FILM,22,Tue Jun 16 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"My personal choice would be (top 5 in order):  Michael Fassbender (38) Has the looks, physicality and the acting talent. Henry Caville (32) Possibly too young, also the whole superman thing. Tom Hardy (37) Maybe too big a star to take on the role now, also perhaps too similar to Craig.  Tom Hiddleston (34) Maybe too much associated with being a villain (marvel films) Damien Lewis (44) Can't actually think of a particular reason why not, I'm a big fan of Homeland so maybe I see him as a villain.   With regards to Idris Elba, he is a fantastic actor but for me James Bond is an upper class white man of Scottish heritage (I think his mother may have been Swiss?). Casting Elba I think would be too much of a jump away from Fleming's character. The same goes for casting a women.   cue the 'you're racist/sexist' comments.....  Other names that have been bandied about: Chris Evans, Jason Statham, Clive Owen, Benedict Cumberbatch."
JamesBond,3a1mo2,Seesawkarma,9,Tue Jun 16 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"I like Fassbender (and his younger counter part Richard Madden) for Bond. At any rate I would personally like to see Bond return to the tall, dark and handsome stereotype."

I mean, I'm not the biggest fan of Elba as 007, but I'd go see a movie starring him as 008 in a heartbeat! (Especially if there were to cameo the then-007 in the background of an MI6 scene)."

Cavill- An interesting choice, I wouldn't have considered him myself, but he'll probably be busy with the DC movie-verse (assuming that those actually carry on).  Hardy- I agree, he may be a bit similar to Craig, but he'd be interesting to see in the 007-verse.  Hiddleston- Honestly, the only guy I wouldn't want to see as Bond. I mean, he'd play it slick as hell, don't get me wrong, but he doesn't seem like the right kind of badass. For me, he seems more like a ""domestic Bond"" if that makes sense? Not the globetrotter, more of the ""handle this problem in England, 007"" Bond? Not sure why.  Lewis- I'm honestly unfamiliar with him, but I'll take people's word that he's qualified.  As for your ""wild cards"", I'd still love to see Clive Owen there. Statham, god love him, just wouldn't be convincing cleaned up in a tux, and the opposite is true for Cumberbatch, being a badass combat-trained operative. At least as far as I've seen from them."

Both are superb actors but I can't really picture them as Bond.   I do like Elba, even though I agree with you that it would be too much of a departure from the original Fleming Character.  And I wonder if he wouldn't be too old (just like Damien) when Craig steps down. If Craig has one more movie to go after Spectre Damien would be 47-48 and Elba 45-46.   By that time though, they might decide to shake things up and cast a black actor. I'm happy as long as they keep true to the spirit of Bond. And as long as they don't cast Ben Affleck."

At 1.85m Damien is tallest, but by 5cm, or 2 inches. Which is not a lot really. I did like how tall Bond used to be and would like to return to that without movie magic. But he should be huge if you are going to do that, get someone like Alexander Skarsgård. I mean Bonds mother was supposed to be Swedish right?"
JamesBond,3a1mo2,GetFreeCash,2,Wed Jun 17 00:34:14 2015 UTC,His mother was Swiss. But honestly I don't think anyone other than the most hardcore of purists would care if EON retconned that and made him part-Swedish.

He has a good voice (except compared to Madden), accent and ability to use his voice to swap from nice to mean in the same sentence. Without facial hair he looks quite different. Here is a good shot of his face in a better state (god damn stupid beard tho) http://i.imgur.com/7O13PT8.jpg . The only real out of place things for me are his hair and height.

In this way, it is similar to the xylophone; however, the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone. The glockenspiel, moreover, is usually smaller and higher in pitch.   In German, a carillon is also called a Glockenspiel, while in French, the glockenspiel is often called a carillon. In music scores the glockenspiel is sometimes designated by the Italian term campanelli.

Or what ia the factor to decide whether digital or analog cameras?"
JamesBond,39uwrx,ptr24,2,Mon Jun 15 07:07:00 2015 UTC,"One reason to shoot on film is because it is thought to be future-compatible with higher resolutions down the road. If you shoot in 1080p, there's no way to up-rez to 4k (it looks bad). If you shoot on film, you can scan at whatever resolution you want, including future resolutions.  Another reason DP's might prefer film is because you get less interference from the director looking over your shoulder at the digital monitor. (because with film, there isn't one)  If you are really interested in the topic, there's a great documentary called ""Side by Side"" about digital vs analog filmmaking."
JamesBond,39uwrx,kickstand,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh, I disagree.  With film, you can't really scan at whatever resolution you want. You can't get an 8K image off a 35mm print. More like 4K. Plus, features won't be shooting in 1080p with their cinema cameras like the Red or Alexa.  Also, you can most definitely rig a monitor to a film camera.  A huge factor for a lot of films is their budget, using film will eat up money so going digital might be cost saving. Then there's the look and feel and tone of the film, where shooting film over digital may aid in telling the story. Then it comes down to the DP, and in Spectre's case it's Hoyt Van Hoytema who most recently shot the entirety of Interstellar on film. So that's kinda his thing here recently. Whereas Roger Deakins who shot Skyfall is a big proponent for the Alexa."

JamesBond,39uwrx,kickstand,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:30:49 2015 UTC,"Here are some articles which might interest you.  An opinion piece on Skyfall's cinematography: http://www.katclay.com/why-skyfall-is-a-masterclass-in-cinematography/ - one of many. Googling ""skyfall cinematography"" will probably yield tons of similar results.  The one I really want to highlight is this article from ""American Cinematographer"" magazine about the filming of Die Another Day. Contains LOTS of technical details. https://www.theasc.com/magazine/nov02/die/index.html  They talk about the ice palace scenes here.   But the Icarus lamp was not the production’s most imposing lighting feat. That distinction belonged to the ice-palace set that was built on the 007 stage. Stretching three stories high and 250' long, the soundstage usually houses two or three large action sets, but for a sequence in which a Jaguar tails an Aston Martin up 360-degree ramps through curtains of melting ice water, the Bond crew needed all the space it could get.  Tattersall’s lighting scheme for the monstrous set had to be flexible and simple enough to hand over to Armstrong and Taylor’s action unit, which would spend a month creating the car chase. In designing it, Tattersall utilized an old-school previsualization method: ""The art department made an 8-foot model of the set, and Eddie and I messed around with it with golfball bulbs and a little Dedo kit. We came up with a very simplified system.""  Because the walls of the ice palace were made of translucent plastic, the cinematographer decided to light the whole set from the outside. ""The simple – and expensive – solution was to put two complete rings [of lamps] all the way around the set. One ring pointed in and was gelled with 34 blue, and the other ring pointed out and bounced back and was gelled with Rosco 65. That way, if you were in any part of the set looking to an opposite wall, you’d probably only need one-half to two-thirds of the set lit. And by fading down the lamps behind the camera, you’d get your contrast. We had a ring of Mini- and Maxi-Brutes all sectioned into color-coded quadrants, so anyone on the ground could order the ones behind the camera faded down and the ones behind the actors faded up.""  After several weeks of electrical rigging, Knight and his crew had cabled nearly two megawatts of power into the set. ""It was a massive exercise,"" Tamahori recalls. ""The lighting plan looked like the map of the London Underground."" Both rings were hung from above to minimize safety concerns during the scene’s icewater downpour. The 5K and 10K lamps, all gelled with 3/4 CTB, were aimed at 40'x40' white muslin bounces hung behind the translucent walls. The resultant, double-diffused glow illuminated the set to a T4, virtually eliminated the need for fill, and ensured that the flooding water was always backlit. ""There were open ceiling sections that also had 5Ks and 10Ks rigged around them, so we could backlight the water clean without going through the walls,"" Knight adds."

She sings pretty much exclusively about life as a young girl. I'm not sure where you get Bond from all that. Also, think back to when Sheryl Crow did the theme for Tomorrow Never Dies. That was godawful. Bond themes are best when they come from singers with a more old-fashioned and grandiose sound. Both versions of Taylor Swift that polute the radio today wouldn't fit with Bond very well. If she goes old Taylor with her acoustic pseudo country sound, it won't work  (See Sheryl Crow) and if she goes for new bubblegum pop Taylor, it won't work (See Madonna's Die Another Day theme)."

JamesBond,39kspe,aixbri,39,Mon Jun 15 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"i feel like QoS got a lot of things right but had two major flaws:   1 - Dominic Greene was a terrible villain and Matthieu Amalric was too twerpy an actor to play him.   2 - They had this awesome opera scene where they staged the beginning of a SPECTRE organization and didn't do a goddamn thing with it after the Opera scene or in the entirety of Skyfall.   I do believe that having SPECTRE reemerge is the right call and will absolutely redeem QoS retroactively though. The rest of QoS was really nicely done. Bond's feelings about Vesper carrying over and then his pulling Mathis out of retirement and getting him killed were all insights into Bond's character and how complex he is, especially when compared to other action heroes out there."
JamesBond,39kspe,johnsciarrino,15,Fri Jun 12 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also I feel like it's best to watch it right after Casino Royale, as it's basically a follow through to that film's plot."
JamesBond,39kspe,Nimanzer,15,Fri Jun 12 15:18:40 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed when I first saw it in the theater. About a year after, I watched it again, and began to feel the same way you do.  It is heavy on character development for Bond. You see him put the mission above his personal life, and shows how he deals with the ghosts that haunt him. I feel this plays right into Skyfall, which would not be as impactful were it not for Quantum."
JamesBond,39kspe,telemaphone,8,Fri Jun 12 13:16:44 2015 UTC,"We expected it to be as good as Casino Royale but were disappointed, but in the end, it's still a good adventure. :)  The wait for Spectre is unbearable..."
JamesBond,39kspe,Kippski,5,Fri Jun 12 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"I think that going from Quantum to Skyfall was perfect. You really get to know Bond and then bam, Skyfall story. Can't wait for Spectre. It looks very heavy on the story and drama which is why I think JB is one of the best action movie series."
JamesBond,39kspe,unnatural_rights,12,Fri Jun 12 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet - the direction is just terrible.  The action in Casino Royale was easy to follow, dynamic, fluid, and intense.  The action in Quantum of Solace was filled with poorly-timed editing cuts, multiple angles that break the flow of action, and generally poor scene construction.  A few things were done really well - the intertitle cards, the performances from Dench and Craig, the pathos of Vesper's death from the previous movie - but the action was terribly shot and the stakes (stealing water from South American nations to hold for ransom!) was too abstract for the average moviegoer to make sense of.  It had potential but ultimately fails both as a Bond movie specifically and as a film in general."
JamesBond,39kspe,AnotherPint,5,Fri Jun 12 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"Beyond the uninspiring plot, the things that really sink QoS for me are bewildering direction and editing. The action sequences (chases, fights) are cut in so frenzied a manner, I can't tell what's going on. This is the case in the first two minutes of the movie, where you feel like you have to stop the film and analyze it shot by shot to determine who's chasing who, who's shooting at who, whose door just got torn off, etc. Forster doesn't give you narrative bearings; he just throws the kitchen sink at you. You can call it a deliberately disorienting technique but in fact it's no technique at all. After awhile you just give up trying to follow the story and let this visual avalanche wash over you.   To see a master class in rapid-cut action sequences, watch OHMSS. To see desperate randomnessm watch QoS.  I happen to have just watched the movie again this weekend on an airplane. It was available on the seat-back system and I turned it on thinking it might make more sense on third viewing, years later. It didn't."

You can call it a deliberately disorienting technique but in fact it's no technique at all.   This is becoming a HUGE problem in modern blockbusters. Just look at Bourne, Batman Begins, the new Die Hard, Trans4mers, Man of Steel, Age of Ultron. There are countless others as well. Instead of trying to tell the story in a visually cohesive manor they just film it like they're shooting a documentary. Shakeycam, cameras from odd angles, no real coherence in the action scenes. I think that's why when you get something like Fury Road, John Wick or The Raid everyone fawns over it because seeing an action movie where you can actually follow what's happening on screen has become such a rarity."
JamesBond,39kspe,unnatural_rights,2,Mon Jun 15 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"OHMSS is really a weird little gem in the Bond canon - Connery disappears, then shows up one film later, and in the meantime Lazenby had become a self-important hippie.  But it's a fantastic late-60s romp and a strong film for its direction, its editing, and its personality (Tracy di Vicenzo is one of the strongest Bond Girls in the entire series, as a character and as a foil for Bond).  I'm glad to see it brought up here!  QOS, by contrast, is simply frustrating.  One thing I noticed often is that the camerawork (during chase scenes, in particular) would move in one direction, then in the next shot move in the opposite direction, even while depicting the same subject.  Forster did this constantly, and more than anything else it serves to confuse the viewer about exactly what he or she is looking at in the moment.  It's meant to be exciting, but it ends up simply being bewildering."
JamesBond,39kspe,DXPetti,2,Fri Jun 12 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree, the shoot out in the basement is one of the better action sequences. It paints a picture on how experienced Bond is in the heat of the moment versus Camille"

JamesBond,39kspe,thedeevolution,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:39:38 2015 UTC,The editing is actually amazing IMO. It shows so much detail so quickly. It seems overwhelming at first but re-watching it you see how perfectly timed every shot is and how each one gives you the exact info you need. They were going for an update of the editing style used in a lot of the early Bonds that really shocked people at the time because it was so fast-paced. I think they succeeded.
JamesBond,39kspe,GetFreeCash,0,Fri Jun 12 16:06:49 2015 UTC,"I actually dislike the intertitle cards. They always break immersion for me when I watch QoS, I'd much rather have simple, innocuous lettering announcing the locations like they usually have."

Obviously, we disagree.  Compared to the vaguely-futuristic intertitles in Die Another Day, for example, the ones in Quantum of Solace were comparatively interesting and subtle.  I liked that they tried to capture the culture of the locations in question, if only for a moment.  Of course, it's not enough to save the film."

JamesBond,39kspe,EdwardGlyver,2,Sat Jun 13 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"No clue why.   I mean, just look at the Rotten Tomatoes scores for the three films:   Casino Royale: 95% fresh, top critics 96% fresh. Quantum of Solace: 65% fresh (just barely), top critics 39% rotten.  Skyfall: 92% fresh, top critics 92% fresh.   That's a pretty telling drop in terms of critical praise.   Also, why do you think there was a 4 year gap instead of a 2 year gap between Quantum and Skyfall? I'll tell you. Because the Broccoli family realized they screwed up with Quantum and wanted to take the time to get the next entry right.   Marc Forster was the wrong choice to direct it as well. He frames the action way too tight and the editing in those sequences is sloppy.   Daniel Craig deserved a better second entry in the series. Glad they turned it around with Skyfall. Mendes got it right because he was able to properly balance new Bond and old Bond sensibilities. Whereas Quantum forgot it was a Bond film and tried to do a riff on Bourne. No thanks."

JamesBond,39kspe,HipHopAnonymous23,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"I really like Quantum of Solace, but I don't really think it can stand on it's own. It suffers from poor pacing and a somewhat loose narrative because it was affected by the 07-08 writer's strike.  HOWEVER, when looked at in the context of being a direct continuation to the story started in Casino Royal, the screenplay really works. Quantum literally begins minutes after Casino ends. It continues and concludes Bond's unfinished business with Vesper, and gives Mathis and Felix more to do.   It still suffers from a lack of competent pacing but I can forgive that. I think it was an interesting idea to have two Bond films so intimately connected, but ultimately I don't think it's a format that really works, and the filmmakers learned that after Quantum.  If you're willing to put in the time, I suggest you watch Casino Royal and Quantum back-to-back as one epic 4.5 hour long Bond film - at least once. It really enhances it them both."

JamesBond,39kspe,Willravel,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:10:14 2015 UTC,"The opening scene to the movie is still one of my favorite opening action sequences of any film. The slow music as the camera moves over the water, quick cuts with no sound effects, the music swells, and then the roaring engine. Everything about it worked perfectly. The door getting torn off, the back and forth driving down into the quarry, and pulling gently in to reveal that White had been in the trunk that entire time.   And it made sense! Casino Royale was really serious for Bond and while he did get that beat at the end with the rifle and the John Barry theme, he hadn't really become James Bond yet. He needed closure from Vesper, and he needed to find a way to be a spy who doesn't fall in love anymore, like before.   The only real issues I've ever had with the movie were the theme song (how can a song by Jack White and Alecia Keys not be amazing?! What happened?), and Greene. He was a whiny, petulant man-child. I get that Le Chifre was a difficult act to follow, but they could have gone with someone more mature, intelligent, cunning, and threatening. I get that Matthieu Amalric can look and act quite creepy, but now that we've seen Silva, we know what a creepy more cartoony villain can look like when he's still intelligent, cunning, and a very real threat."
JamesBond,39kspe,currentlydownvoted,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:19:19 2015 UTC,I liked it when it came out despite it's flaws. It's not the best Bond but it's much better than it gets credit for. I think if you watch it back to back with Casino Royale it works much better than on its own.
JamesBond,39kspe,jokelahoma,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:56:42 2015 UTC,"Amazing moments strung together by skeletal exposition and polarizing 'shaky cam' action scenes.

It's probably just too serious and 'real' for a Bond movie."
JamesBond,39kspe,rersaf,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"It's a film with virtues, but you only see them through a hairline crack. You got a new type of villain. Unfortunately Greene isn't given enough time to develop an animosity with Bond. They have two encounters before the final one, and in only one do they have a conversation (that's like a sentence long) hardly enough time to say anything mean and nasty to each other. The final confrontation between Bond and the villain in the film should not simultaneously be the first (YOLT Blofeld, Whitaker)  Also you got a new kind of villain plot going on, but Bond doesn't really care about it (the water rights) He's after Greene cuz he knows stuff about Quantum that he wants. It's like he fixed up the water rights thing by accident in his quest to get info on Quantum and gets told about it in some sort of post-action report. The same applies to Camille, she's trying to get at Medrano. No time to worry about Bolivians."

Wind - Plane chase. Fire - End sequence.  It's a beautifully shot movie but you can tell it's been written during the writer striker. Apparent Craig and (I think Paul Haggis) were writing parts of it after they went.  I think we are going to see Quantum return as part of Spectre and I'm excited to see how they work it. The whole Quantum angle was never really resolved.

JamesBond,39i1ma,the_Ex_Lurker,10,Thu Jun 11 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"In Skyfall Bond didn't fight like a war machine because he was out of shape. They made that pretty clear I think. Bond was never about extended over the top hand to hand combat with crazy stunts, the old school fights were pretty brutal, but never as over the top as in Quantum of Solace.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7v9ClAH1LI this is a fight in classic Bond, I think Skyfall is pretty close to this.   Also the footage in Skyfall isn't sped up"
JamesBond,39i1ma,Kunt-FILM,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"I know the classic Bonds were pretty subdued in terms of stunts and I think the gritty, faster fights in Casino Royale were a good way to energize the movies, but more importantly, it's weird that Skyfall changed the feel so dramatically from what CR's reboot established. And you can't honestly tell me the scene with the CGI dragons was an example of good choreography or filmmaking."
JamesBond,39i1ma,Kunt-FILM,3,Thu Jun 11 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"The movie's entire theme is about Bond being out of shape, MI6 being outdated, M being forced to ""retire"". So it's not a weird change.  And yes I can honestly tell you that the komodo dragon scene is great. It's a fun quick little fight scene that works. It's a minute long scene that delivers everything it needs to deliver. Not every fight scene needs to have character jumping on rooftops, sometimes it doesn't need to be 5 minutes with over the top stunts and free running.   Also the underwater fight in Skyfall is great too"
JamesBond,39i1ma,Kunt-FILM,-1,Thu Jun 11 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"My problem with the casino one was that it felt like it would be in any typical movie. It was Bond ducking under a punch and hitting the other guy... twice in a row... complete with cartoon punch sounds. It was missing the production value and creative flair of the choreography from the other Craig movies.  The hotel fight in QOS is another example of a ""quick little fight"" (which is why I put it right next to the former in my video) that I think works a lot better."
JamesBond,39i1ma,Alexedward00,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"The casino fight has Bond using his suitcase to knock people out, it has a little gag involving a gun not being able to shoot, a guy getting eaten by a wild animal, and Bond using a Komodo to jump himself up a higher level. It's classic Bond.   The Quantum fight may as well be from the Bourne movies"
JamesBond,39i1ma,Kunt-FILM,11,Fri Jun 12 11:23:30 2015 UTC,"Well I personally like Skyfall opening fight, there was nothing wrong with that. It seems that SPECTRE has more action than any other Craig movies including hand to hand combat and breathtaking stunts!"
JamesBond,39i1ma,Alexedward00,4,Thu Jun 11 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest the opening fight was probably the best one, but that entire sequence felt like a weaker remake of the opening chase of Casino Royale.  And re: Spectre, I sure hope so. The only action scene not including a car that I've seen looks to be the one where Bond runs up to a guy and knocks him out in a single shove. I guess we have to wait and see."

JamesBond,39i1ma,ForrestLawrenceton,4,Thu Jun 11 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"This feeds in to why I personally was disappointed by Skyfall. I loved Casino Royale and so it was sad to see the grittiness and violence absent from Skyfall that had been present in the previous two films. I mean, I was so surprised when I first viewed CR, I had never seen such pain in a Bond film before - think of the stairwell fight where Bond gets covered in blood after choking (spoiler) to death. In fact, I felt that Skyfall just wanted to bring back the old silliness, it was much more light-hearted than CR and QOS with jokes and one-liners being far too frequent. But that's just my opinion."
JamesBond,39i1ma,woopigchewie,2,Fri Jun 12 06:07:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. CR opens with a very brutal and realistic killing by Bond of a man by drowning him in a sink, gurgling for breath!

And I'm not anti-Skyfall for no reason. I saw it in IMAX on release date and I've rewatched the movie numerous times to give it second chances. Sadly, in my opinion the just OK action sequences are held together story that sadly falls apart more and more every time I rewatch the movie. I just hope SPECTRE is a return to Casino Royale form is all I'm saying."
JamesBond,39gapq,ZiggyPalffyLA,7,Thu Jun 11 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a dedication as well. I don't think it's appropriate at the beginning of an action film though. Even when they dedicated TND to Cubby, it was at the end, as the credits started to roll.  Of course, as you say ""right before the gun barrel sequence"", that could mean anything with what the last few movies have been doing >:[   But that's another discussion..."

But the idea of dedicating film to each Bond star who recently isn't  good, Lee 7 Richard Kiel performance will always remain memorable!"
JamesBond,39gapq,Alexedward00,4,Fri Jun 12 18:00:44 2015 UTC,No. The Bond universe is huge after 24 films. If we start dedicating films to every notable person who has died recently then we'll extend the credits by an extra minute every movie.
JamesBond,39gapq,JBfan88,5,Fri Jun 12 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"If Gert Frobe, who played the most famous Bond villain of all time, didn't get a dedication, I'm not sure why someone who played a weak villain in a bad Roger Moore film should get one.  And what about Fleming himself?  Shouldn't he have gotten a dedication in Goldfinger since he passed away the month before it opened?  I don't have anything against dedications per se, but it is a slippery slope.  If people like Ian Fleming, Terence Young, Richard Maibaum, John Barry, etc. haven't gotten dedications, I find it hard to justify that anyone else should."
JamesBond,39gapq,thedangerman007,2,Thu Jun 11 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"Well, on the other hand, people like Derek Meddings and John Stears got dedications at the end of GoldenEye and TWINE (IIRC).

He would have been great in that phantom early 90's Dalton film.  Besides, being vaguely gay was once a required characteristic for a Bond villain. (I think they talked about that briefly in an episode of James Bonding.)"
JamesBond,39gqns,akanefive,3,Thu Jun 11 19:51:24 2015 UTC,He would've been amazing opposite Dalton. I wish we could've seen that
JamesBond,39gqns,risico001,2,Fri Jun 12 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"In his prime he would have been great. The thing with Curry is you have to remove the humor element fast, so an introduction scene where he does something ruthless (kills a henchman, etc.) to set the tone. That is really his only issue, the rest is gravy with his excellent acting."
JamesBond,39c8db,GetFreeCash,15,Wed Jun 10 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"This is my favourite of the Connery films, and my second-favourite of all the films (closely following CR). FRWL is just amazing, I can't sing its praises enough.  I love the pre-titles sequence. I can only imagine how audiences in 1963 felt when they saw Robert Shaw strangle Sean Connery to (apparent) death in the first five minutes of the movie. The title sequence itself is often overlooked in favour of its more visually spectacular successor in Goldfinger but I still like the effects of projecting text on the bodies of belly dancers, I think it's cool.  While many of the action scenes are great (namely the Bond vs Red Grant fight on the Orient Express), I actually think the film shines when it's showing Bond and his little interactions with the people around him. Comparably minor moments like Bond preparing to deliver another witty quip to Moneypenny before shutting up when he sees M, Bond and Kerim Bey joking about violent sexual technique, and Bond showing Tatiana a suitcase full of negligees are what stick out in my mind.  10/10 would watch again."
JamesBond,39c8db,MazeppaPZ,8,Wed Jun 10 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"Timeless.  The perfect balance of a pure espionage story, with action, gadgets, exotic locales, beautiful women....  What else does a Bond movie need?"
JamesBond,39c8db,knobthis,2,Wed Jun 10 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"The first Bond film to introduce a gadget - and a plausible one at that.  Also, one of the few Bond films I can watch without scoffing uncontrollably."
JamesBond,39c8db,HipHopAnonymous23,5,Wed Jun 17 03:47:58 2015 UTC,"This is the best of the Connery era. The entire thing is quintessential Bond. It has a great song, the girl is beautiful, the villain is interesting, and Sean is at his peak coolness.   I like it because it feels the most realistic of the movies to me. It's still a little over the top, but it's more like a heightened reality as opposed to a cartoon. I love that there isn't an over use of gadgets, (something I also like about the Craig's Bond). Really the only thing that can be called a gadget is the briefcase, and it seems like a totally realistic thing that a secret agent might have. No dart guns or exploding pens here.   The fight between Bond and Grant also felt really genuine. It's clear both are just human, and are nearly equally matched. You actually fear for Bond a little, which in the rest of the movies hardly ever happens.   Goldfinger might be more iconic, but I think FRWL is a much better film and I believe one of the best of them."

JamesBond,39c8db,Tularemia,3,Wed Jun 10 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"The novel is also excellent (at least as far as pulpy 1960s spy thrillers can be excellent). The conspiracy to kill Bond is a explained in a lot more depth than in the movie, we get to spend a lot of time with Red Grant, and the ending is just fantastic. Fun fact: Wikipedia says Ian Fleming considered making this the final James Bond novel. He obviously changed his mind."

JamesBond,39c8db,sigersen,3,Fri Jun 12 02:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is Connery's best. Goldfinger comes very close, but this film is one of the best Bond films ever made and it's a real Spy Film. In many of the movies, Bond is not really spying. That's okay but I feel this film conveys the atmosphere of the Fleming books better than any other."
JamesBond,39c8db,eoinster,3,Thu Jun 11 11:55:52 2015 UTC,"I make no secret of preferring the newer films to the classics. I know there's nostalgia and respect to be had for the originals, but to me Craig's era is infinitely better than any other in terms of the quality of filmmaking, writing, and acting, but I have to say that From Russia With Love gives Craig a run for his money. Dr. No is great, and I really enjoyed Thunderball and OHMSS, and while I have my personal disdain for Goldfinger, I think From Russia With Love stands out as by far the finest of the Connery era While it still carries some of the clunkiness of the times, scenes like the train fight brings it firmly into the modern era."
JamesBond,39c8db,mcuv,3,Thu Jun 11 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"FRWL borrows from North By Northwest (hitchcock, 1959) quite a bit, regarding the train and the helicopter attack. I guess there are worse films to nick from."
JamesBond,39c8db,dr_hermes,3,Thu Jun 11 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed with everyone here. THE best James Bond film. If it had been the only Bond film ever made, I think it would be remembered today as a fine thriller in its own right."

JamesBond,39c8db,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"This is a movie that actually improved upon the book in a couple areas (despite being arguably Fleming's masterpiece.)  First - The fight with Grant is so god-damn superb its almost ridiculous. It hold up today with how sharp it is. Brutal, Brutal scene.  Second - The fact that Tatianna actually has a lot more to do, especially at the end. In the book we don't really hear anything from her once they get out of the train.  On a different note, the man who played Kerim Bey - Pedro Armendariz learned he was dying of cancer while filming it, but INSISTED on filming his scenes and by god he did a good job. That's real dedication. He sadly never saw the finished work as he succumbed to his illness shortly after wrapping."

JamesBond,39c8db,akanefive,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"This is the best of the Connery films. It does owe a lot to North By Northwest, but I also think it makes those tropes its own. The train sequence is especially great, and sort of the next step after the train scenes in North By Northwest.   I was also struck with how much they got away with, considering the time: the first Tania/Klebb scene, all of the dialogue between Bond and Kerim Bey, and the way Tania is throwing herself at Bond on the train.   And that opening sequence, plus the titles? Iconic."
JamesBond,39c8db,knobthis,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Connery himself said this was the only film he truly liked.  Aside from this being one of the few near-plausible Bond films, all of the scenes around Istanbul were shot by cast and crew on location.  From Connery's entrance at the old Yeşilköy Airport Terminal, to the once famous floating Galata Bridge across the Golden Horn (replaced in the 90s), to the original Serkeci train station and cistern scenes, and to the delightfully humorous ferry boat scene on the Bosphorus as Daniela Bianchi describes the lector in sultry manner as the famed Dolmabahçe Palace passes in the back ground... and all beautifully nostalgic scenes of old Istanbul.    Production began in 1962 on location just as the Cuban Missile Crises was unfolding, and Turkey had suddenly become world news headlines when Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev demanded he would only remove the missiles from Cuba if the US removed theirs from Turkey!  Stunning news that left both Americans and Turks shocked as neither had any idea nuclear missile silos were being constructed as part of a secret NATO agreement.  Real cloak and dagger stories emerged that Istanbul was a hot bed of espionage.  As such, From Russia With Love's true-to-life back story with Istanbul as the center stage added enormous intrigue when released in 1963.  A largely forgotten historical footnote for this great film nowadays, but made for riveting entertainment during the height of the cold war and explains - in part at least - why both film and book were among John F. Kennedy's favorites. *typos"

He was the founder of now-defunct file hosting service Megaupload as well as its successor Mega.   In politics he is the founder, main funder, and ""party visionary"" of New Zealand's Internet Party.  He rose to fame in Germany in the 1990s as a self-proclaimed internet entrepreneur. He received prison time in 1994 for computer fraud and data espionage, and another suspended prison sentence in 2003 for insider trading and embezzlement.   In January 2012, the New Zealand Police placed him in custody in response to US charges of criminal copyright infringement in relation to his Megaupload website. Dotcom was accused of costing the entertainment industry $500 million through pirated content uploaded to his file-sharing site, which had 150 million registered users.  Dotcom has denied the charges, and is fighting the attempt to extradite him to the United States.  Despite legal action still pending over Megaupload, Mega launched in January 2013, opening to the public exactly one year after Megaupload was shut down. It is a cloud storage service that uses encryption to prevent government or third-party ""spies"" from invading users' privacy.

It has plenty of fantastic luxury hotels (Charleston Place would probably be my choice for Bond, the lobby is very cool). Nice beaches, renowned food. Bond always seems to visit places when they have some festival going on, so he could come during the Spoleto Festival, which is an international arts festival. I can certainly see the more sophisticated villains taking it in.  The narrow streets would be perfect for some Ronin type car/foot/motorcycle chases. the only thing it lacks are casinos.

It was founded in 1977 by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who sought to establish a counterpart to the Festival dei Due Mondi (The Festival of Two Worlds) in Spoleto, Italy.  When Italian organizers planned an American festival, they searched for a city that would offer the charm of Spoleto, Italy, and also its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces. Charleston was selected as an ideal location, with Menotti saying of Charleston:   It's intimate, so you can walk from one theatre to the next. It has Old World charm in architecture and gardens.

JamesBond,39666w,GetFreeCash,11,Tue Jun 9 15:18:12 2015 UTC,I will always fight tooth and nail to defend this movie - criminally underrated.
JamesBond,39666w,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Tue Jun 9 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"Watched it for the first time recently, it astounded me how good it was. If it were Connery instead of Lazenby, I think it would be everyone's favourite."
JamesBond,39666w,eoinster,3,Thu Jun 11 14:41:35 2015 UTC,I am convinced it's that good because they didn't have Connery. So they had to try extra hard to make it great
JamesBond,39666w,Kunt-FILM,2,Thu Jun 11 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"See that's the thing, I feel that film NEEDED the fresher face. Connery made no bones about how bored he was with the role and he would've given a poor performance. Where Lazenby did his best with it (some would argue he just didn't have the natural talent, bla bla bla) and I dunno --  They didn't know at the time that Lazenby would become Lazenby so we can never really say."
JamesBond,39666w,Clancy_B_Shanty,0,Fri Jun 12 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"I do feel like it was both a strength and a weakness to have Lazenby. It improved the writing and directing no doubt, because they weren't just banking on Connery's pure charisma, but Lazenby left a lot to be desired. His final scene, with Tracy's death, could have been touching and emotional but instead it was kinda cringe-worthy for me. There were also moments when I felt they were trying too hard to remind us that this was the same man as Connery, what with the scene rolling through all the past themes as he unpacked his drawers, it was eye-rolling. I think a fresh face was needed, but in a film that was a direct continuation, it begged Connery to finish his tenure there rather than in Diamonds are Forever."
JamesBond,39666w,eoinster,2,Fri Jun 12 12:10:21 2015 UTC,I felt his scene at the end with Tracy was especially well done!  And the scene in his office where he's going over all the effects from the previous films was serviceable. We have to keep in mind that such a change in actor has never really happened for this type of movie before. They didn't know people like us would be dissecting these films 50 years after the fact.
JamesBond,39666w,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"True. Editing standards and what we now see as cheesy and clunky might have been elegant and normal back then, so the office can be forgiven, although I did feel like they kept reminding us too often, with the cleaner whistling Goldfinger at some stage too. I think the opening ""This never happened to the other guy"" dialogue and the recap of everything during the opening credits was enough to remind us of the old movies (although now that I think about it the opening dialogue is kind of contradictory to the notion that it's the same man)."

JamesBond,397d8d,Granitsky,3,Tue Jun 9 20:00:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so here's Bond's medal ribbons present in YOLT. Got 'em here.  They kept his medals reflective of WWII from what it seems. He has seven ribbons and in order from top row (left to right) they go...  Companion of St. Michael and George, Distinguished Service Ribbon, Battle of Britain Ribbon.  Atlantic Star with clasp (Air crew for France, Germany or Europe) - EDIT: ITS A PACIFIC STAR!!!! with clasp/emblem.   The bottom row is the Defence Medal and then the War Service Medal."
JamesBond,397d8d,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Wed Jun 10 01:18:07 2015 UTC,"Moneypenny was a 'WREN', but her rank is never specified -- looking at her epaulettes she's possibly a sub-lieutenant (in the Royal Navies its pronounced 'Left tennant'). I got the wikipedia article on it here. The costume designers actually got it right by having the blue shades as well as the diamond shape of the officer's 'curl'.   M I know for sure is an Admiral AND a Knight. Admiral Miles Messervy KCMG - in the novel for 'Golden Gun' its mentioned that the Knighthood is pretty much an inherited title with the job.   Bond, himself we know to be a Commander in the Royal Navy Reserve. He also has a CMG (Companion of the Orders of St. Michael and St. George), which was probably earned for his service in WWII, as the Secret Services try to keep its staff off the public registry. If you squint in this picture, you can see the ribbon for Bond's CMG on the top left of his placket. But when in doubt, you can always just refer back to Fleming and what HIS decorations were. Bond's would undoubtedly be similar. I'm going to fire up YOLT tonight (Blu-ray on a 50 inch screen) and see if I can't get a better screen grab. I'll post it to my IMGUR if I find anything worth a damn.  Further Edit: Moore AND Brosnan both appear in their officer's dress in TSWLM and TND, respectively --- I'll investigate to see if they keep it consistent."

JamesBond,397ebj,Janedeverly,3,Tue Jun 9 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I would love to see a female agent treated quite the same as a male agent, in the sense that she is seen as just as competent as the others in her field. I could imagine her using her 'charms' while on a mission, sure, but she can hold her own in combat and would most likely wear very practical clothing and equipment as well. (No high-heels!) Personally too, I would prefer her to see the same villans and weapons as her male counterparts, makes for a stronger story that way."
JamesBond,397ebj,TalonLardner,2,Wed Jun 10 00:35:05 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I would also have her make a fool of the male characters she seduces (to make up for all the ditzes bond has had) so that they never get to sleep with her (on the job). Like she has lovers when off the job (Like Sean Connery's bond) but on the job she just seduces and abuses.
JamesBond,397ebj,arafinwe,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:26:48 2015 UTC,I personally love this trait. I think it's definitely something that's lacking in heroines in that they still seem to come back to the same old tropes.
JamesBond,397ebj,beingjohnm,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:23:03 2015 UTC,I think I've hit the proverbial nail on the head with my character then :) This almost describes her perfectly.
JamesBond,397ebj,JimCalinaya,2,Thu Jun 11 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"Dana Scully comes to mind regarding her attitude on the job.   I agree with the comment that said no heels (though Scully made it work), but just like James is a paragon of male fashion, she should be extremely elegant in her day to day wear, something you can tell is expensive and tasteful. There is a lot of wiggle room here with work suits. If she has to go to a gala, just as Bond wears a tux, she should wear a fine dress, designer preferably- but at the same time something that allows her to run. I think a cool gadget would be something to transform her heels into something easier to run with. And her purse would, of course, be a gadget in itself, let alone what's inside. I think a lot of fun could be had with ""womanly"" gadgets such as a little mirror, lipstick, blush powder, foundation, mascara etc etc.  Just like James, seduction could be one of her tactics when trying to get to the main villain (seducing little mooks, stroking their ego). For all the hate Die Another Day gets, I really liked Miranda Frost as an MI6 agent and how she made a fool out of Bond after they slept together. Instead of pitching her against a male villain, you could have a lot of fun having her face mostly women villains - provided you stay away from vixen cliches and the like. I would stay away from male villains going automatically ""bah, she's just a woman, let's beat her and rape her mwhahaha"" when they first meet her. It can happen once or twice, but more than that would be cliche and annoying.   ...I think I've just described what I imagine Judi Dench's M would have been when she was younger :)"
JamesBond,397ebj,Kunt-FILM,2,Wed Jun 10 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, I was thinking just that when I was reading this post. It's just how I would have imagined the female M to be. Sort of like an Agent Carter type maybe?"
JamesBond,397ebj,Kunt-FILM,2,Thu Jun 11 22:25:07 2015 UTC,One thing I've found with a lot of great characters is that they have a weakness that is also their strength. The main character in the TV show Monk is my favorite example of that. A Bond type of character probably could not be introverted and I probably would not go too deep into her sexuality as I think it would be hard to do well.  Weapon of choice maybe a knife that she uses as she gets men to let their guard down.  Myrna Loy in The Thin Man and other strong female characters in classic films would be where I would look to for inspiration. The main character in the Dragon Tattoo trilogy might be good as well as a very strong female but with some emotional damage (like they are suggesting with Bond in the trailer for Spectre).  Link to part one of the novel?

JamesBond,38tc0i,SquidishMcpherson,23,Sat Jun 6 20:49:58 2015 UTC,"Very intriguing question actually, it's hard to pick just one. Whenever I hear the word ""chemistry"" I think of Jill St. John for some reason, but that's definitely not the right answer. I would probably say-   Sean Connery/Honor Blackman- Their chemistry is undeniably good, they have great scripting, and they're a perfect match for wit and charisma. The fact that she was older, and subliminally less vulnerable contributed greatly I think. It's something I hope they can recreate with Monica Bellucci in Spectre. Daniel Craig/Eva Green- From their first conversation on the train(which is some of the best writing in the entire series), to the end in Venice, it still baffles me how much character development occured. By the end of the movie you truly know he loved her. George Lazenby/Diana Rigg- I don't think I have to explain this one.   Honorable mention Daniel Craig/Naomi Harris- I thought it was a delightful amount of tension and energy between them. The shaving scene in particular was very well shot and acted. And who can't relate to falling for someone you work with?"

JamesBond,38tc0i,GrinderAK,2,Sun Jun 7 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"True, but I think that has more to do with the background of the character. If you think about it, she's a female doing a(at that time) predominately male's job, in a very male crime organization, and she's probably very used to being charmed, underestimated, and hit on by dashing men. I think the initially frigid act is just a reflection of that."

JamesBond,38jg7r,Bane_Meatball,52,Thu Jun 4 16:59:35 2015 UTC,Most brutal by a WIDE margin is Corinne Dufour from Moonraker.  She's chased through a forest and mauled/eaten by attack dogs.  No other Bond girls death comes even remotely close to this level of violence.
JamesBond,38jg7r,DrinkinMcGee,14,Thu Jun 4 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Helga Brandt, who was fed to piranhas by Blofeld in You Only Live Twice. Also pretty brutal.  Or Solange Dimitrios in Casino Royale. Tortured and suffocated with sand by Le Chiffre's men."
JamesBond,38jg7r,CelebornX,5,Thu Jun 4 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"While admittedly Helga died pretty brutally it was at least pretty abrupt - none of the ""long terror"" Corinne sadly suffered.  I remember Solange being strangled/murdered (which is sadly pretty typical for Bond girls) but I don't remember the sand bit - guess I need to rewatch CR one of these days.  I think what ultimately makes Corinne's death the most brutal for me is that not only did she see it coming, it's almost completely shown on screen.  That's very atypical for a Bond girl death - either they're off screen and Bond finds the body (Plenty O'Toole in the pool, Jill Masterson in the paint, etc) or they die fairly instantly on screen (Oddjob's hat).  That poor girl spent her last few moments in raw, primal terror and then suffered a horrifying, slow death.    Edit:  On further reflection I'd also point out that Helga was a ""bad guy"" and had tried to kill Bond, so she gets less sympathy than most of the women who just happen to get caught in the crossfire."
JamesBond,38jg7r,DrinkinMcGee,3,Thu Jun 4 21:50:57 2015 UTC,She's mauled to beautiful music no less.

JamesBond,38jg7r,Seizure_Salad_,3,Thu Jun 4 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"The Goldfinger one is a bit odd, as the reason given is she couldn't ""breathe"" (as opposed to dancers ""who can survive because they leave a patch of skin unpainted"") . This is complete rubbish. You can't die from a lack of breath from being covered in paint. You breathe through your mouth and your nose - not your skin.    It's possible she died of heat-stroke, but that depends on how long Bond was unconscious for.  More likely she would have to be killed and then painted gold."
JamesBond,38jg7r,Cleanatwork,2,Fri Jun 5 09:08:21 2015 UTC,Yeah in the 60s they actually believed that skin thing. But you could die from overheating if your pores are clogged. They even left a patch on her stomach bare because they were all afraid to paint her whole body

JamesBond,38jg7r,KngHrts2,6,Thu Jun 4 22:23:19 2015 UTC,This is mostly because craig is a better actor than lazenby. He couldnt convince the viewer that he cared about tracy like craig did with vesper

Elba could be great choice he is currently 42, the Bond 25 will release come in at least 2 or 3 yeas later if he is signed for the character after the release of Bond 25 then it would be too late for him, because any new actor will uphold the character for at least two or three movies he will be too old that time, that's why Michael Fassbender is a perfect choice for 007!"

He's in some really fun Bond films, and though not my favorite, I'll always find him entertaining.  And he's right about all the money going back into the films. Something I've always appreciated about the series."
JamesBond,387nks,akanefive,3,Tue Jun 2 15:31:59 2015 UTC,I read every Interview he gives. Over the years I've really come to appreciate his take on Bond and I think his ranking as a Bond will be a lot higher as the years go by. His Bond films are entertaining and incredibly watchable.

I actually re-watched it and kind of found it somewhat cheesy, but it's still one of my favorite Bond films. I could see Scaramanga make an appearance, but I can't see them going off the deep end and bringing back someone like Nick Nack or even Oddjob.  I also don't think they'll touch Red Grant or anyone like that, just because we're so far removed (and yet closer than ever) to the Cold War.  I can't see them going back to Dr. No territory either. It just seems too fantastical for this current incarnation.   I could see them doing Largo, but again, Largo is just too small when compared to Blofeld. When, in the last movie, you have Silva literally blow a chunk out of the MI6 headquarters building and kill the head of the British Secret Service, you have to up the ante in the next movie. You have to make the next villain menacing -- and Largo isn't that menacing when you know who's behind him: Blofeld."

He could even have his own island in that Chinese archipelago again, the geopolitical climate hasn't changed enough to make a difference.  Red Grant was probably my favorite henchman from the books or movies, and I see no reason why he couldn't make an appearance now that we have SPECTRE again. He could be the exact same too, just a hyper effective psychopath killer with a mission to take out Bond."

JamesBond,38bggg,are_you_nucking_futs,2,Thu Jun 4 17:43:05 2015 UTC,Here's pretty much how I see it  Connery-Brosnan Era (1962-2002)  james bond is a secret agent and he goes on missions. Nobody involved in any of these movies gives a fuck about continuity. It's completely unimportant and irrelevant.  It's about a spy who does cool spy stuff in awesome movies.   Craig era (2006-present)  Bond a secret agent who goes on missions. Except this time the creators attempt to include character development and story arcs through multiple movies.
JamesBond,38bggg,Kunt-FILM,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"The Reboot premise totally falls apart because Dame Judy Dench is ""M"" in Brosnan and Craig's films. If someone says ""Code Name"", I will throw up. :)"
JamesBond,38bggg,sigersen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"The writers adressed this issue actually. It's on the Casino Royale extras.   Basically it boils down to this, they rebooted the franchise, but they realized how great M's Judi Dench was and decided to keep her in the new continuity. It's basically Judi Dench playing an ""alternate reality"" version of the same character, she has the exact same characteristics as she did in Goldeneye, but those movies never happened in this canon.   The writers admitted that it was confusing but just went with it because Judy Dench is so great. I am looking up the clip on youtube but I can't find it, when I do I'll let you know"
JamesBond,38dga0,Roger-Moore,3,Wed Jun 3 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"The same way I deal with the ""problem"" of Roger Moore.  Accept that the series needs to change in order to endure, and enjoy the different incarnations of it. The Spy Who Loved me is great, and Casino Royale is great, both in their own way, and they are both equally Bond. Both fit in their time and place/  Also I suggest you pick up one of the books for once, you'll see that these Craig movies are very much Fleming's Bond, unlike Roger Moore's Bond. Hell Craig is probably the second (or third) closest to the character (Dalton being the most accurate)  I don't even know why I bother replying to this shitty Bait-thread though"
JamesBond,38dga0,Kunt-FILM,2,Wed Jun 3 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. Sure there are less over the top gadgets, but I don't recall Sean Connery having anything ostentatious - other than the gadget infused Aston Martin DB5 (which made a spectacular appearance in Skyfall).  Craig's Bond drinks martinis, wears a tux in every film, gambles in two of his three films, his quips are less than Brosnan or Moore but when he does deliver them they are on point. Craig is equally charming as he is deadly - he is the first Bond since at least Dalton  (though I would argue since Connery) who could believably be a government assassin."

The multiplayer (although with bots) was actually pretty fun and I enjoyed running through the levels and using the gadgets.  I've always thought that an open-world James Bond game wouldn't work, but maybe have a game in the style of The Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead -- that sort of linear, multiple choice storyline -- could actually work really well... especially if they set it in the 1950s (novels) or 1960s (Connery era).

I respect Statham but he should not be Bond...maybe villain henchman, why not but Bond ? Nah.  Speaking of new Bond, people should realize that established actors will never be Bond. Statham,Fassbender etc. will never be Bond. If we're looking for new Bond (and it's early thing to do) I'd look at some smaller role actors..for example some of the kids in X-Men movies..part of action movies, some people know them..have experience but they are not stars nor really famous. (I am not alluding towards anyone I am just giving an example, Craige became Bond cause of Layer Cake. So equivalent of that would be that young kid from Kingsman-great movie btw)"

I've heard a lot of complaints that it has issues with pacing and drags a bit but I've always found it to be an interesting little movie.  Specific things I like:   The introduction of Bond. So iconic. Maybe one of the coolest introductions of a character in film history, right up there with Indiana Jones whipping a gun out of somebody's hand. Jack Lord is a great Felix Leiter The killing of Professor Dent   If I think of more, I'll add them later."
JamesBond,383bqy,IamJamesBondAMA,13,Mon Jun 1 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. It does get overlooked a lot.  What I like about Dr. No is the atmosphere. I really love the scenes on Crab Key -- the sand, the water, everything.  The Dent ""you've had your six"" line has got to be one of the coldest scenes in a Bond film and I believe it's one of the things that really separated Bond from other action heroes of the 1960's, his willingness to kill, especially in cold blood. Do I feel as though it's representative of the Bond in the novels? I'm not 100% sure. I know there are times where Bond wants nothing more than to eliminate someone, but at the same time, I keep going back to the ""Reflections in a Double Bourbon"" chapter in Goldfinger where Bond laments the nitty-gritty aspect of being a secret agent after his encounter with the Mexican knife fighter."

It became a Bond staple, and common in other films, but I believe it was not as common to have the enemy invite the hero to a formal dinner, their adversarial nature revealed, when Dr. No was made. It's what differentiated Bond from a Western or Sci-Fi hero, for example. John Wayne did not have a fancy dinner with an elegant black-hatted enemy. Ming the Merciless did not invite Flash Gordon to a banquet. That exterior cool politeness prior to inevitable violence is what makes a Bond film a Bond film."

JamesBond,383bqy,Shanneaux,9,Tue Jun 2 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this is my favorite Bond film. That's not to say that I dislike the others. There's just something about this one.   I feel that in this movie, we see the range of emotions from Bond that people typically associate with Craig. When he's being followed from the airport, you can see real anger towards the driver. When Felix Leiter catches him in that stock room with Quarrel, you can see a bit of fear while he is looking for a way to fight back. Moreover, when Bond is trying to escape from Dr. No's prison, you can see him struggling and failing; for me, that shows the range. That is the low point. When he gets electocuted trying to open the vent. When he has to tear his shirt to save his hands from burning. You don't know how he's going to make it, but you know he will.   Those are the moments that make Bond for me. The times when it seems like there is nothing he can do to save the day. But he always does."
JamesBond,383bqy,malcolio,6,Mon Jun 1 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"I think what I like most about Dr No is how you know as little as James Bond does, it takes a good long while before we even hear of Dr No, let alone meet him. This helps keeps a mysterious and dangerous element to the story, and highlights James' role as a spy as gathering information rather than act as an action hero.

JamesBond,383bqy,journeywestward,4,Mon Jun 1 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"I really love the premise of Dr. No. A quiet, comfortable Caribbean island locale hides something sinister. I liked that they did a sort of call back to it with Silva's island in Skyfall (not that it was a call back to this movie specifically, but just with regards to it feeling very much like classic Bond).  I like how Bond is more of an everyman than a larger than life character. He's more of a handsome detective in over his head than a swashbuckling ladykiller like in some of the other movies. SPECTRE and No are treated with a sort of mysticism--you really get the sense that this organization is not an equal to James Bond's wits, but is actually much, much more sophisticated than not just him, but Mi6 as well. You see James Bond as a strong willed character just doing whatever he can to halt the organization in its tracks. Even though there's monologuing, it actually serves to show how massive and powerful SPECTRE is, rather than just explain the villain's motivations.  Also, I can't help myself not to say that Ursula Andress looked good in this movie. I know acting roles for women were much more limited back then and by modern standards, some of the movie might be seen as not giving the actress/character due credit (she's very ditzy), but it doesn't change the fact: she's very attractive in this movie."
JamesBond,383bqy,Tony_M_Cannoli,2,Tue Jun 2 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"That really struck me when I re-watched, how incredible Ursula Andress looked. Must've been the blu-ray, but for the first time I really understood why she's so revered. But yes, her character (and Quarrell) is definitely a product of the 60's. There's no way a movie could get away with having the leading female think the tank with the flamethrowers was a dragon these days."
JamesBond,383bqy,Peralton,2,Wed Jun 3 13:47:27 2015 UTC,Speaking of Quarrell: I think the weakest part of the movie is missing out how great that character is in the book.
JamesBond,383bqy,IamJamesBondAMA,3,Thu Jun 4 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"I've always really loved the title sequence. Some of the classic Bond formula is already there, some of it hadn't yet been developed, but overall it starts the film with a huge burst of energy and colour."
JamesBond,383bqy,wheniwaswheniwas,4,Thu Jun 4 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite of the Connery films.  It's redolent of a quaint 1950's charm.  In an a maximalist era full of bullet and explosions, it's good to go back to a minimalist film where one bullet carries a lot of weight.   Connery is at his prime, young, healthy and vibrant.  The only thing I don't like is how Honey Ryder has the personality of a 10 year old girl (that's not sexy).  But otherwise, it's a perfect film."
JamesBond,383bqy,akanefive,2,Mon Jun 1 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"I really like the older Bond films, and especially Dr. No. I think it made a great kickoff to the series. Dr No's plan was just over the top and sci-fi enough to make it awesome."
JamesBond,383bqy,broadfuckingcity,5,Mon Jun 1 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree with that assessment that it was sci-fi in its own way. And that's interesting because they took Bond in SUCH a different direction with From Russia With Love. I mean, FRWL could almost be its own film separate of the Bond universe because, while it does have some gadgets, the story is more rooted in Cold War espionage than fantastic adventures in exotic locales. FRWL has always felt a little ""different"" to me than other Bond films -- but not in a bad way."
JamesBond,383bqy,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Mon Jun 1 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"It's important to note how the screenplay differs from the book so much too. Wisely, the filmmakers decided to leave out the cartoonish aspects such as the giant octopus and keep Bond more firmly grounded in reality - setting a tone for the future Bonds to come. Terrance Young et al really set a tasteful precedent that set the stage for both the success of this film and the rest of the franchise to follow."
JamesBond,383bqy,BernoulliEffect,2,Tue Jun 2 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"I tend not to watch Dr. No that often, but I popped it in last night. It's middle of the road for me, but there are definitely things I like about it. As always, Ken Adam hits a home run with the scenic design. The underground room where Dent is given the spider. Are you kidding? That's such an incredible set, and it's only seen once. (Miss Taro's apartment is another set I really love.) Each location has so much depth and character; it really adds to the film. I also love the atmosphere of the movie, especially once Bond arrives in Jamaica. There's a real feeling that everyone on the island is connected to the world of spies and SPECTRE. Really great."
JamesBond,383bqy,Kunt-FILM,2,Tue Jun 2 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"I love the direction, sets, dialogue and performances throughout Dr. No. Terence Young really had a knack at developing atmosphere, and he was one of the most talented directors of his day. I especially love that this film and its direct sequel have a noirish feel and actual spy work and detecting by Bond. That's something from the original novels that is unfortunately missing from many of the silver screen adventures."
JamesBond,383bqy,MrF33n3y,2,Tue Jun 2 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"If you listen to the commentary, they practically had to invent a lot of the cinematographic techniques used in the film. The quick edits, those wide open 'Bondian' sets which got Ken Adam work on Dr. Strangelove."
JamesBond,383bqy,Kunt-FILM,2,Tue Jun 2 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of those underrated Bond movies. It sticks relatively close to the book (especially compared to the others), has a good bad guy (despite the weird claw thing) and Honey is one of the sexiest girls."
JamesBond,383bqy,ricdesi,2,Thu Jun 4 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"I'm glad the Bond marathon has started! A little late to the discussion, but here's my 2¢. Dr. No was a solid start for the Bond franchise. I think it's worth appreciating all the creative people who made their stamp on the entire franchise in this first film. If you watch the special features, a lot of people say that director Terence Young added a lot of the sophisticated touches and style of James Bond that became staples of the series. Individually, they might not seem like big things, but cumulatively he had a big influence on the film persona of James Bond. He was also the one who came up with the iconic introduction of Bond in the casino. In the special features they said that three other directors were offered the film first, so it's not unreasonable to think that the series could have been different if one of them had accepted. Obviously, you also had Ken Adam's intriguing sets, Maurice Binder's iconic gun barrel sequence, and Peter Hunt's new editing techniques. I think they made some great choices in casting, especially some of the recurring characters. Sean Connery was a relative unknown at the time, but he was and forever will be the original James Bond. The last time I went through and ranked the EON Bond movies, this one came in 8th on my list. Not my absolute favorite, but a solid opening and worth appreciating for all the choices the filmmakers made that we take for granted today. It also has two of the most iconic scenes in film history - the introduction of Bond and Honey Ryder coming out of the ocean."

JamesBond,37z09b,yourmansconnect,2,Mon Jun 1 05:41:10 2015 UTC,"Following the release of the previous Bond single, ""The World Is Not Enough"", MGM wanted a high-profile artist for the theme of Die Another Day and Madonna was their choice. She wrote and produced the song with Mirwais Ahmadzaï while French composer Michel Colombier was enlisted as composer.  While developing, the track went through numerous changes. After Madonna saw the initial version of the film she adapted the song to its theme, described as a metaphor for destroying one's ego."
JamesBond,37z09b,joosh82,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:38:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for clarifying.  But yeah, that song was so bad. Maybe they should go back to the other method."

JamesBond,37z09b,megatom0,2,Mon Jun 1 00:10:29 2015 UTC,Kind of hard to rhyme with spectre.
JamesBond,37z09b,cnet14,9,Mon Jun 1 00:54:38 2015 UTC,"I've had thoughts about this and I feel the title track might be more along the lines of what Chris Cornell did for Casino Royale, a stellar tune that sets the pace.  Then again, if there's a modern artist that can find a way to belt the word ""Spectre,"" I'd say it's Adele."
JamesBond,37z09b,megatom0,4,Mon Jun 1 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, see I wasn't a fan of Cornell's song being a Bond theme (I like the song though). The Skyfall theme really captured the essence of the older Bond themes but with a darker tone, which fits the movie so perfectly."
JamesBond,37z09b,joosh82,2,Mon Jun 1 02:58:32 2015 UTC,They can work SPECTRE into the song without it being part of a rhyme. Or we should just pray there's a character who is really pivotal to the plot and named Hector.
JamesBond,37z09b,cnet14,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:30:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Adele's voice really worked wonders for the overall tone of the film.

JamesBond,37j36v,JamesBondRadio,7,Thu May 28 00:15:39 2015 UTC,What do you think guys?   I'm loving that it's set 2 weeks after the events of Goldfinger. Nice to see some 'prequel-ish' action rather than another story set after The Man With The Golden Gun.
JamesBond,37j36v,GetFreeCash,6,Thu May 28 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"It sounds pretty interesting. Jeopardy Lane is a great Bond girl name IMO - unusual but not conspicuously so, and not too obvious with the sexual innuendo (although since Pussy Galore is apparently coming back in this book, whose name can compete with that).  Do you think Jai Seung Sin will be related to Oddjob? For some reason I thought of Die Hard with a Vengeance, where the villain of that movie is the brother of the villain from the first Die Hard movie.  Can't wait to hear you and Chris' thoughts about Trigger Mortis on the next episode :)"
JamesBond,37j36v,jakielim,3,Thu May 28 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"Oddjob's supposed to be Korean, and 신재승 sounds like a plausible Korean name."
JamesBond,37j36v,notexactlyclever,2,Thu May 28 01:37:58 2015 UTC,Well it does say that she is hell bent on vengence so its completely possible that she wants revenge for Oddjob's death.

JamesBond,37l6ds,longlivejamesbond,2,Thu May 28 12:54:30 2015 UTC,I'd encourage you to use a spoiler warning on that last paragraph due to the fact that you mention something from the leaked script.  Its hard to say which had a bigger impact on Bond. Vesper was his first love that he lost and you can tell that he's still damaged goods in QoS. I'd say that Tracy is more of a reminder to him that he is too dangerous to be around anyone he cares about.

JamesBond,377snr,GetFreeCash,14,Mon May 25 16:11:01 2015 UTC,Can anybody tell me how they are going to finish this movie on time when they got only six months and they are still shooting?
JamesBond,377snr,Kunt-FILM,10,Mon May 25 17:41:27 2015 UTC,"Andrew Scott says in this video that there's about a month left of shooting (not sure if he means the entire shoot or just scenes that Denbigh is in). I'm hoping that the reason why they've allocated so little time for post-production is because they won't need to do a lot of effects and whatnot in post, but who knows."
JamesBond,377snr,Kruse,6,Mon May 25 17:57:54 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but some of the post-production work is probably underway on scenes that are already shot/completed."
JamesBond,377snr,Lovable_Fighter,1 point,Tue May 26 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"I watched the hour long Extra Scenes on the 1st Hobbit, and while they were filming some scenes they would already be editing the heck out ones they already shot."
JamesBond,377snr,runnerofshadows,2,Tue May 26 22:11:31 2015 UTC,Yeah hoping it has as little cg as mad max if not less. It just feels more real with practical effects.
JamesBond,377snr,firstcity_thirdcoast,7,Sat May 30 06:48:26 2015 UTC,Very similar timeline to Skyfall's shooting schedule and post production. Definitely not uncommon.
JamesBond,377snr,eoinster,6,Mon May 25 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well unlike something like a Marvel movie the editing and post production won't take months, more than likely only one or two. Ant-Man had a pretty tight schedule which I'd be worried about, as it depends entirely on the detail of its post effects. Star Wars finished a year before release to get the post production perfect, different studios different methods I guess."
JamesBond,377snr,DiscipleOfDrone,3,Mon May 25 23:36:45 2015 UTC,I know nothing about video editing.  But I'm guessing there won't be a lot of post production CGI or parts that are finished filming are already being edited.
JamesBond,377snr,jp23,2,Mon May 25 18:24:12 2015 UTC,Part of me would think they are already doing post-production on the parts they've finished shooting.
JamesBond,377snr,bort_sampson,3,Tue May 26 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"You'd hope so. Even then, if they manage to make the deadline I'd be impressed. Even though there's very little CGI, if any, sound production itself often takes at least 12 months for a feature film. ADR, effects, foley, musical score. It's always a pretty big job for action films such as this."
JamesBond,377snr,QuinineDjinn,1 point,Tue May 26 03:49:01 2015 UTC,"While I don't know how they're doing post on this film, editing is no long a process that starts as shooting wraps.

JamesBond,375soq,CigBookie,33,Fri May 29 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"I fell like the results are slightly skewed as the redditing majority are fans who fell in love with Bond during the Casino Royale revival. I was never a huge fan of that film, but understand why many like it. Craig is a fine Bond but I can't help but think that him and his movies are flavor-of-the-month for many taking this poll."
JamesBond,375soq,KneelYung,5,Mon May 25 08:27:09 2015 UTC,"Skyfall being the number 2 most liked film, but the number 1 most over rated film definitely proves this. While Casino Royal is definitely a great film, QoS and Skyfall were both a step backwards for their own reasons. And this leads to questioning why Craig is thought of as the best Bond, having only one solid film.  The next two films will determine the legacy the Craig leaves."
JamesBond,375soq,pinkpanthers,3,Mon May 25 18:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think people generally like their first Bond more than the rest. And it's save to assume with most people here it was either Craig or Brosnan.  If you were to do the pol ten years from now it would probably be Bond #7 at the first place, connery second place, and Craig third place"
JamesBond,375soq,Kunt-FILM,6,Thu May 28 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"I'm young(er), yes, but I fell in love with Bond in the 90's watching everything my parents loved. Connery from my Dad, Moore from my Mom, and then Brosnan on my own.  I still like Craig the best."

Connery has always been my favorite Bond, but Craig does seem similar to Connery in the role, IMHO. So, I believe that some people could be comparing the type of character each actor played Bond as, and are picking Craig because he's similar to Connery, but in much more updated films."

JamesBond,375soq,panopticonisi,3,Mon May 25 21:49:37 2015 UTC,I think Bond should be slightly more in-touch with reality than the Avengers.

JamesBond,375soq,Kunt-FILM,2,Mon May 25 15:56:36 2015 UTC,It will never happen because Tarantino is still mad at EON for snatching Casino Royale from him and making it much better than he could possibly imagine

Also, the title song by Duran Duran is awesome."
JamesBond,375soq,ImTossible,2,Thu May 28 18:09:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, Walken is great.  One of the best Bond villains, IMO.  View to a Kill could have been passable if someone else was bond."
JamesBond,3760i6,antdude,3,Mon May 25 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"I've always enjoyed AVTAK. It's just so fun. Yeah the acting from the two leading ladies is... different, and Moore is looking rather worse for wear, but I've always felt that it has a good few redeeming qualities.  Christopher Walken is simply amazing, playing Zorin with that slightly insane touch he's known for. He was born to be a Bond villain.  Patrick Macnee was a great addition and his chemistry with Bond was fantastic. I just think it's a shame Tibbett was made into the film's sacrificial lamb when he could have become a good recurring character.  I love the settings. Eiffel Tower, French Chateau, the nighttime chase through San Francisco, the claustrophobic mine and then the spectacular climax atop the Golden Gate Bridge. It's quite a ride.  I feel this film gets a worse rap than it deserves. Sure, it certainly hasn't aged well, but I, for one, am a big fan."

JamesBond,36wbiz,NerdBro1,11,Fri May 22 17:33:28 2015 UTC,Finished Dr NO last weekend. Got a rush when he mentioned SPECTRE to Bond.   The new movie has so much potential. Hoping this one has more acting than CGI effects.

JamesBond,36wbiz,lefthandman,5,Fri May 22 18:16:06 2015 UTC,Wife and I have been watching 1 movie every night for the past couple of weeks. We just finished Moonraker last night.
JamesBond,36wbiz,kaminari1,3,Sat May 23 01:10:31 2015 UTC,What did you guys think? :)
JamesBond,36wbiz,GetFreeCash,4,Sat May 23 01:12:13 2015 UTC,We like it.   She got me the box set on Blu-Ray when it came out so this is about the 4th time we've gone through all the movies.   Only movie we're dreading (mainly me) is Die Another Day.
JamesBond,36wbiz,kaminari1,3,Sat May 23 01:22:09 2015 UTC,Oh shit i've wanted to watch them all in chronological order ever since i fell in love with the franchise. I'll be doing this.  I will also write down stats or highlights such as 'Which hair colour does Bond prefer?' 'How high was his body count?' etc  any more suggestions?
JamesBond,36wbiz,GuitarOtoko,2,Sat May 23 10:46:06 2015 UTC,Appearances by recurring characters like Jaws or Felix Leiter.  Note Felix's ever-changing appearance and race.  Does he visit a casino?  What games does he play? How much does he win?

JamesBond,36wbiz,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Mon May 25 00:14:10 2015 UTC,In Australia we have streaming service called stan (similar to Netflix) one of their biggest draw cards was that they have the entire bond catalogue (including never say never again) so I have a decent head start.
JamesBond,36yuym,iwannagrokwithyou,11,Sat May 23 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"Chronological order, watch all of them - even the ones that may not have aged so well. Think of them almost as time capsules for the era they were made."
JamesBond,36yuym,Clancy_B_Shanty,5,Sat May 23 13:58:22 2015 UTC,Alphabetically is the best.
JamesBond,36yuym,1701ncc,6,Sat May 23 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"I would suggest chronological, but if you're not into that, you could always listen to the James Bonding podcast and follow along with them. They go Dr. No, Skyfall, From Russia With Love, Quantum of Solace, etc. and then meet in the middle.  The downside of this is that they haven't finished yet. Also the podcasts are often longer than the movies themselves.   I did not sell that very well."

JamesBond,36yuym,pick-a-spot,2,Sat May 23 16:51:13 2015 UTC,Ask everyone for their favourite bond flicks and watch those first. I think you should alternate between different actors  too.   Not including Craig ones :  Goldeneye - brosnan  Live and let die -  moore  Goldfinger - connery   A living daylights - Dalton
JamesBond,36yuym,Kunt-FILM,2,Sat May 23 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"In order of release is the best. It's just great to see how times change. see all the fads, fashion of each decade. Don't skip any of them, make up your own mind on which are good or bad"
JamesBond,36yuym,akanefive,2,Mon May 25 00:30:26 2015 UTC,"It might be fun to watch all the Blofeld/SPECTRE movies together - that would be Dr No, FRWL, TB, YOLT, OHMSS, DAF, and FYEO.  Alternatively, watch the first of each actor, followed by the second of each actor, and so on. Only downside, you'll end on A View to A Kill."
JamesBond,36yuym,ErwinsZombieCat,1 point,Tue May 26 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"Unless I went pendulum style and did the first movie of each actor in chronological order (Connery to Craig), then did their second movie in REVERSE order (Craig to Connery)."

JamesBond,36yuym,kiptheenglish,-10,Mon May 25 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"I would watch them chronologically from Dr No and stop before Live and Let Die. Skip all Moore (just a camp farce to me), see if you like Dalton, and resume with Brosnan."
JamesBond,36yuym,MrF33n3y,9,Sat May 23 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"OP, don't listen to this fool. Live and Let Die is amazing, as is The Spy Who Loved Me."
JamesBond,36yuym,AnotherPint,7,Sat May 23 14:25:18 2015 UTC,I don't agree on TSWLM (I know I'm in the extreme minority) but I do agree Moore shouldn't be skipped.
JamesBond,36yuym,happycactus17,3,Sat May 23 15:31:40 2015 UTC,"For Your Eyes Only is one of the 6 or 8 best Bond films, period."
JamesBond,36yuym,wkfink,2,Sat May 23 16:44:25 2015 UTC,Umm Roger Moore is amazing. Skipping him would be like skipping empire when watching star wars.
JamesBond,36yuym,Kunt-FILM,2,Sat May 23 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"Roger Moore is the equivalent of the prequels, if we're talking Star Wars.  Pretty good if you haven't seen the other films, but laughable and made for kids if you have.  Craig is 100% Empire. Dark, gritty, and doesn't always make you feel good at the end.  Let's just hope that whatever comes after Craig won't be a shitload of Ewoks."
JamesBond,36yuym,sebastian-tombs,1 point,Sun May 24 07:14:29 2015 UTC,"No, the prequels are god-awful movies. Moore's Bond movie's are great movies that are just different in tone from the rest.  Casino Royale and The Spy Who Loved me are both (near) perfect in their own way  A View to A Kill and Quantum of Solace are both bad in their own way."
JamesBond,36yuym,Kunt-FILM,0,Mon May 25 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"But if you read Fleming's novels, Moore isn't Bond. He's a camp ""spy"", but he is not James Bond."

JamesBond,36vy9g,Smokinacesfan55,2,Sat May 23 04:01:15 2015 UTC,"I have not seen it for years. Love Walken and Jones, but Sir Roger was too old for this one. From what I have read EON kind of talked Moore into strapping on the Walther one more time. It was at least one time too many."
JamesBond,36vy9g,sigersen,5,Fri May 22 17:52:55 2015 UTC,I heard when Roger Moore realized he was too old was when he met Tanya Robert's mother on set and realized he was same age as her
JamesBond,36vy9g,HipHopAnonymous23,2,Fri May 22 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"What happened to Roger Moore between Octopussy and AVTAK?  Sure, he was starting to show some age around FYEO and Octopussy, but he still looked more or less like he did in LALD. But in AVTAK he looks a good decade or two older. Sean Connery looked less haggard while swashbuckling it up in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and he was 73 when he made that film."
JamesBond,36vy9g,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Sat May 23 00:37:30 2015 UTC,He definitely started getting noticeable by FYEO. By the time Octopussy came out it would've been a decade since LALD.

JamesBond,36xky5,GetFreeCash,1 point,Sat May 23 08:29:33 2015 UTC,"I really liked ""Solo"" by William Boyd. It's set in 1969 and Bond is in his mid-forties, but he is still very much the same character we found in the Fleming novels - you can tell Boyd adhered closely to the original novels. I personally am a huge sucker for old-school spy thrillers and personal dramas set in Africa like Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" and Graham Greene's ""The Heart of the Matter"", and it's kind of in the same vein as those.  ""Devil May Care"" was written by Sebastian Faulks ""as Ian Fleming"" and while I thought Faulks did a pretty good job writing in Fleming's style, I didn't really like the novel that much - but I think I may be in the minority with that opinion since most Bond fans apparently really like that novel. Check it out anyway, it's worth a read.  ""Colonel Sun"" by Robert Markham (who is actually Kingsley Amis) is also pretty good, I would recommend that one too. Mainly I remembered it because the guys over at James Bond Radio (/u/JamesBondRadio) just reviewed it. http://jamesbondradio.com/colonel-sun-book-review-kingsley-amis-podcast-039/  Ninja edit: just remembered James Bond Radio also reviewed ""Solo"" awhile back. http://jamesbondradio.com/book-review-solo-william-boyd/"
JamesBond,36xky5,JamesBondRadio,2,Sat May 23 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Nice one LZ!   I'd highly recommend Colonel Sun (probably my favourite) with Solo a close second...maybe even joint first. I really love them both!  As /u/GetFreeCash mentioned, Devil May Care is also period but for me felt like Faulks had just taken scenes from Fleming's stories, made them slightly different (tennis instead of golf for example) and packaged them together into a new story.   Other than the Young Bonds, I think that's it for old school Bond. Both Gardner and Benson were in a modern setting. There is a brand new Bond book from Anthony Horowitz out later this year that will almost definitely be another one you can add to your reading list :-)"
JamesBond,36xky5,ErwinsZombieCat,1 point,Sat May 23 01:26:12 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the Gardner books even in their modern setting.

JamesBond,36szxi,are_you_nucking_futs,1 point,Sun May 24 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"I think in order to discuss literary qualities one has to have a certain background education on what makes a book great, personal preference aside. The same way not anybody could be a movie critic for instance, I think there are studies and courses that give you the tools to discern quality from poor execution. I for myself am totally uneducated on literal canons of quality, and can't discuss about them in a sort of scholarly way. So I can only say which books I enjoy and why, but from a layman's perspective and with layman's words. I hope you find some contributors who are better read and equipped for this discussion, which could indeed be an interesting one."

I'd still be interested in personal taste in regards to what you might have thought was good/bad writing in structure, story, or the like.    I'm keenly interested in how people enjoyed the novel as far as the visceral opposed to what they thought about the structural.  Maybe I chose words poorly in the original post..."

JamesBond,36mwkv,007Dossier,2,Wed May 20 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"Additional info: Scrambled Eggs were Fleming's favourite too, and the originator of the exact recipe is one May Maxwell, housekeeper of one of Fleming's friends and the inspiration for Bond's May."
JamesBond,36mwkv,IamJamesBondAMA,2,Wed May 20 15:52:13 2015 UTC,"Completely true. A lot of the foods that Fleming listed in the books were, at the time, unavailable as casual foods in post-war Great Britain according to the book License to Cook, which is a James Bond-based cookbook.  I just finished reading the part in Thunderball where Bond returns from a briefing with M and eschews his ""health nut"" diet in exchange for scrambled eggs, bacon, white bread toast, and black coffee."
JamesBond,36mwkv,deowolf,1 point,Wed May 20 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"Did a version of this a few weeks ago, but instead of scrambled, I let the eggs rest and become omelets.  Fluffiest damn things I ever put in my mouth.  Highly recommended to try it both ways."

JamesBond,36jacz,TouchMyTooter,5,Tue May 19 20:17:26 2015 UTC,My brother-in-law was complaining about how Skyfall was too much like The Dark Knight films.  This must have triggered something in my father because swore up and down he remembered having a comic book where Batman and Bond teamed up. I had never heard of this so I went digging.  While hunting the Batman cover down I also came across this and these for anyone interested.  The latter two aren't comics but fun and obscure nonetheless.  I love this type of stuff.
JamesBond,36jacz,dragonsky,4,Tue May 19 20:18:54 2015 UTC,For the record the picture you posted (Batman/Bond) is a fan made picture. :)

JamesBond,36j2hl,sigersen,5,Tue May 19 19:26:21 2015 UTC,"Take a bow !  I like Moonraker and my wife loves it. You did a great job of defending it. I like Drax, too. I never understood why people thought he was dull.  I love the sniper scene and I think it's one of the best kills in the franchise. It's over-the-top but if that were a crime all the Bond actors would be in jail. I always  considered Moonraker a ""comic book come to life"", but I mean that affectionately. But, what do I know ?  I love The Man With The Golden Gun too."
JamesBond,36j2hl,Bond_Bot,4,Tue May 19 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"I think it was seen as a cash grab during its day. It was moved ahead of FYEO entirely to cash in on the Star Wars craze at the time. And it's hard to argue with the results considering the large profit it made at the time. I think of it as a Transformers type movie of the time.   It's so wild it goes into ""so bad it's good"" territory, though."
JamesBond,36j2hl,jazza_hayward,5,Wed May 20 03:55:10 2015 UTC,"For a huge fan of the books, I think I see Moonraker the film as the furthest thing from the books. I loved Moonraker the book because it was a classic detective story that didn't have to rely on actions or Bond girl sidekicks. It was really quite a grounded story that was a refreshing change to the series. So when you compare that sort of sentiment with the film, it's not hard to see why its easily disliked.  Also, personally I see Moonraker as the most ""camp-y"" and ""silly"" of all the Roger Moore films which doesn't necessarily hold up as well compared to some of the other films of that era"
JamesBond,36j2hl,jamedudijench,1 point,Wed May 20 11:45:32 2015 UTC,"Point taken, but the problem with Moonraker (the book) is that it is, aside from TSWLM, probably the least translatable into screen form.  In 1979, it doesn't work at all (an ICBM aimed at London?  Errr... the Russians had a hundred at aimed at London, no need to Trojan Horse one in), and even if it had been made earlier in the film sequence, it's... well, as you put it, it's a detective story.  It'd have been a come down after Dr No, or FRWL, or whatever.  Different audiences.  The cinema audience wanted the glamour and excitement."
JamesBond,36j2hl,akanefive,3,Wed May 20 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"And to speak for some of the disdain for Drax, I think where a number of people drop off is the fact that he's essentially the exact same idealist as Stromberg in the previous movie. Only he's supplanting the aquatic aesthetic for one less wet. He is a, and pardon the pun, very dry villain. Americans in particular probably see that as boring or, in the least, wasted talent; in this film. Dry is not a bad thing, however, perhaps what people may (and especially for a film as over the top as this) have wanted was a villain to match the camp. Drax is... out of character for this movie. From my trivial perspective anyway. But it's not a dig at Michael Lonsdale. He seems more suited for... oh... The Living Daylights maybe?   Anyway, there's no doubt that this is a superbly fun and entertaining film to watch and I think that's what makes it more endearing for a lot of people than the ""good"" films or the ""realistic"" ones. And that's a mentality I can gel with. Call me a blasphemous heathen for such heresy but that's one reason why I admire the Sam Raimi Spiderman trilogy over the new films. They definitely go there to that weird place and I love it.   TL;DR: Michael Lonsdale's dry performance of Drax is ill-suited for this movie."
JamesBond,36j2hl,jamedudijench,2,Wed May 20 13:25:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's essentially the same film as The Spy Who Loved Me, minus any real excitement. TSWLM didn't have a great villain either, but everything else around it made up for that."
JamesBond,36j2hl,akanefive,1 point,Wed May 20 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. We all know TSWLM is revered merely for being Moore's Goldfinger. The term ""iconic"" is used heavily when describing the film. Not much of the plot takeaway or story impact."
JamesBond,36j2hl,jamedudijench,2,Wed May 20 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"It's iconic for a couple of reasons I think: the submarine car, the pre-title sequence, and the song.  And plot similarities to YOLT aside, I think it's the first Moore film that doesn't feel like a poor imitation of a Connery film, I think. It's got it's own sensibilities and style. Moonraker, on the other hand, tried to duplicate The Spy Who Loved Me almost shot-for-shot, and it's a much lesser film because of it."
JamesBond,36j2hl,akanefive,2,Wed May 20 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Oddj- I mean Jaws hahaha.   But I'm with what you're saying. It's different enough and firmly planted Roger Moore as a lot of people's Bond. Moonraker is just like: ""......So that last plot was pretty good, eh?"""
JamesBond,36j2hl,ax_reddit,4,Wed May 20 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"Goodhead as a character is a revelation, unfortunately, Lois Chiles gives one of the five worst performances in a Bond film. There's no chemistry, no energy, no urgency in her performance. It's really bland and flat.  My other problem with the movie is how far it stretches credibility. Drax has built a secret space station and successfully implemented artificial gravity? And the US government as a military shuttle full of space marines ready to launch at a moment's notice? It's just too much, even for a '70s Bond film. And there's very little urgency or tension throughout the whole movie. Bond never has to do any work to figure out who is behind the missing shuttle. Drax basically admits to being the villain in their first conversation.  That said, Bond being pushed out the airplane without a parachute, and the sequence where the shuttle is stolen are excellent. I totally get why you like it, and why a lot of people like it. But I can't take it seriously."
JamesBond,36j2hl,jamedudijench,3,Wed May 20 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"I like to watch the movie, it's nicely directed, a bit thrilling but not too much.

I am also showing my daughter all the Bond movies in order and we just saw Moonraker about two weeks ago and I determined it is one of my least favorite Bond movies.  It really does seem like they wanted to cash in on the Star Wars craze and found the book with the most sci-fi sounding name and totally stripped an interesting plot and replaced it with a much much worse plot."

But I think you did a good job defending the movie. When I watched Moonraker for the first time, I was expecting a horrible movie, based on what I had heard. I found the film to be rather enjoyable. It's very over-the-top, but that was the Roger Moore style. I thought it had a good villain, a decent plot, decent visuals, a pretty good Bond girl, and some great humor. It's definitely not the best Bond movie I've seen, but it falls somewhere in the middle rather than the bottom.  A View to a Kill, on the other hand, was a terrible movie."

I feel asleep all 3 times around the point where he enters the Amazon. I never fall asleep during movies...  The film has some great scenes but drags on more than any other Bond film. Goodhead is by far the most un-captivating actress to play in a Bond film. She absolutely ruins the film for me. I think she's even more mis-casted than Christmas Jones.  And by the way, no boat chase is better than in Live and Let Die."

The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II. Gert Fröbe, who did not speak English, was dubbed by Michael Collins, an English actor. Of his role as Goldfinger, Fröbe later remarked: ""I am a big man, and I have a laugh to match my size. The ridiculous thing is that since I played Goldfinger in the James Bond film there are some people who still insist on seeing me as a cold, ruthless villain - a man without laughs."""

If the follow-up film to Spectre is intended as Craig's last outing as 007 as rumored, I would not be surprised if Spectre ended more on a cliffhanger setting up a knockdown drag-out Bond film finale.   I think that would be a proper send off to Craig's 007. He came in kicking ass, should go out the same way."
JamesBond,36hnxa,cnet14,3,Tue May 19 15:28:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but ever since Craigs reboot, I have imagined that his last James Bond film would end in such a way that the story line continues with Dr. No. In that film Bond comes back to MI6 after being shot in a previous mission. He was on a sick leave for 6 months according to M (?).  Since Craigs films is prequel to Dr. No, it would make sense to end in such a way. If done correctly, I do believe that it would be a worthy end to his Bond-era.  As an example the film could end with Bond being shot, end up in hospital, and then have an after credit scene which begins with M's breefing on Dr. No. (or they could change the villain to someone else, so that they don't have to go on with him as a villain). Now here they could make it really interesting. They could either show the next Bond actor, or they could avoid his face and only give up his voice, or just tease it and not show anything, and just have M talking."

It needs to be spread over two movies though, perhaps him meeting Tracey at the very end of this one, then her death sometime in the next, and all polished off with - as I'd put it - a Holmes vs Moriarity last showdown, a fight to the death with ESB where neither appear to survive and a fade-to-black, no music end credits: the perfect exit for DC, and the door wide open for the next Bond to come in with no previous agenda except very big shoes to fill."

Brosnan always had Moore-esque charm.  Goldfinger would be a far less charming movie. That scene where Bond pretty much straight up rapes Pussy Galore would be hard to watch, it would probably feel more like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.   Casino Royale with one-liners? It would be different, but it would probably work. I'd imagine it would be pretty similar to Dr. No."

I loved Goldeneye (one of my top 3 faves along), Tomorrow Never Dies was good and The World Is Not Enough wasn't that shit but Die Another Day..? Lord have mercy. Overall, his movies are enjoyable and still hold the test of time despite being 15-20 years old.  He deserved far better scripts and better directors. Who told him to bulk up for TND and cut his beautiful hair? He was in perfect shape for Goldeneye, slender with youngish-ish looks.  He should have made more Bond movies (through coming in earlier or, sentimentally, have one more last hurrah in Casino Royale though logically, for a reboot, a new face was needed) He's still married/very much in love with his wife despite her...well, despite her not being the slimmest of women and despite him being able to nearly choose about any woman in the world. Genuine guy!   0-0-7. For a lot of us, he'll be ""our Bond"". Happy Birthday, you magnificent, suave bastard!"

Had he gotten it instead of Craig I would have been happy. Craig's movies turned out fantastically, aside from skyfall of course, but was that all because of Craig or was it writing, directing, and the overall new direction they decided to take Bond in?

Best known as Matthew Crawley from Downton Abbey but he's recently done a lot of work across the pond such as A Walk Among the Tombstones and (my personal favourite) The Guest.  The Guest is a really great movie, and he's excellent in it. He's lost some weight since his Downton days and is extremely lean and buff now, and the movie exploits this in one hilarious scene. Stevens' character is alternately charming and dangerous and funny and sociopathic, I really think he has all the makings of a future Bond.  He's also only 32 right now so still prime Bond age when Craig steps down, and quite unknown when compared to the likes of Fassbender and Hardy and Elba.

JamesBond,364ule,ReverendEarthwormJim,23,Sat May 16 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"It's still a Bond film so I love it, but ranks towards the lower half of the franchise. I'll just try to list reasons, some articulated by the James Bonding podcast.   Bond fails at his job. The agents at the start die, the prostitute is killed, Judi Dench dies, he never gets the list back. Two movies ago, Bond earned his 00 status, but now he's an old man in everyone's eyes? Bond is soooo dour for most of the film. The score is kind of lackluster despite being an otherwise well produced film. Poor scoring isn't uncommon in Bond films though. I think Whishaw is a good choice for Q, but the fact that they bring him back in the second portion of the film and make his mistakes have massive repercussions is an odd creative choice. This may be the only time Q has been unhelpful in a Bond film. No gun barrel scene? Whyyyy? Bond rarely appears solo. He mostly has Moneypenny, Kincaid, or whomever with him or at least in his ear.   Pros: Cinematography and scene direction was good. Action was great. I liked all the locations and the acting was superb."
JamesBond,364ule,Smokinacesfan55,9,Sat May 16 05:07:27 2015 UTC,2 is my biggest critique of the film.

My main complaint is that Bond is supposed to be a ""secrect"" agent yet everyone in the movie knew who he was. The villain had a mannequin of him for goodness sake. with a loaded gun. and the whole obstacle course was horrible. Plus the whole idea of him being the best assassin out to kill all the competition. and the midget. and that stupid sheriff. the book was a hundred times better"
JamesBond,364ule,1701ncc,2,Sat May 16 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"See, I guess if you'd read the book and the plot was completely different, you'd have good reason to dislike TMWTGG. In my mind though, it's the campiness of the Moore era at its prime. It looks bad now because we've seen what's come afterwards (the Moore era getting even more ridiculous + Brosnan/Dalton/Craig eras + Austin Powers), but back then, it was still somewhat novel, and showed that you could take a ridiculous plot with ridiculous characters and make a fun spy movie out if it. That is still James Bond to a lot of fans--you see it in the vocal minority who seem to dislike Craig (not that I'm one of them, I'm just trying to see it from their perspective).  Plus, Christopher Lee can always be counted on to play a good villain, but we all knew that already."

JamesBond,364ule,sigersen,1 point,Mon May 18 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"I found someone else!  Here's why I love it. I love the idea and concept of many of the Bond films more than some of their executions. After so many Connery films and SPECTRE being the faceless evil generic corporation of evil for so many of the films, I wanted a change. SPECTRE essentially boiled down to a bunch of incompetent evil middle managers incapable of besting Bond, regularly outclassed by their own lead Henchman, who also fail to give much of a challenge for Bond.   But Scaramanga was the Anti-Bond, he was Bizarro Superman. No overly complex master plan (OK, the Solar McGuffin was added to appease the energy crisis of the time), just one on one action. The idea of a villain who acted alone, with the slight help of a midget, was a fresh take on the Bond formula.  The execution was where it lacked. Instead of focusing on the battle between the minds of Scaramanga and Bond, Maibaum added more JW Pepper. Also, the final battle was terribly short and rushed."

JamesBond,364ule,-WISCONSIN-,4,Sat May 16 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"It was unapologetically a bond movie. It married the best elements of Connery, Moore, and Brosnan. Roger Moore was campy but way to soft and blatantly silly. Die another day took that over the top campy kind of movie and put a more serious badass bond in it rather than the ned Flanders interpretation of bond that Moore had."

JamesBond,364ule,Badmecha007,19,Sun May 17 11:02:53 2015 UTC,"Connery fell off after Goldfinger Die Another Day will have a much better reputation once the HD-realism-superviolent era comes to a close. I like Dalton but no amount of Fleming true-ism can make him un-socially-awkward. Live and Let Die is basically just the standard Bond formula with voodoo paint. Roger Moore saved the series off its ass, stopped it from becoming ""the establishment"" like Lazenby predicted, and turned it into a massive durable franchise. License to Kill was right for evading the tired Bond formula. Octopussy was very clever and funny.   The World Is Not Enough had a more innovative plot than most films in the series. If you think Goldeneye was the only good Bond film Brosnan made, you are missing out. OHMSS > most of the Connery movies. Craig is a brilliant actor and his Bond has a lot of depth to it, but we'll be ridiculing gung-ho macho man with an AK47 image years from now. Quantum of Solace is a little bit underrated.  Dominic Greene was one of the series best villains, and did what he could with the script he had.  Another Way to Die is good song if you're open to modern taste in music. Oh, and I'd take the absurdity of Casino Royale 67 over a handful of some of the more derivative unoriginal entries in the series."

JamesBond,364ule,-WISCONSIN-,12,Sun May 17 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, here are some of mine:   Goldeneye is the second worst Brosnan film. I go back and forth on this, but the character of Jaws is just needlessly ridiculous even by Moore era standards. It was especially apparent while watching Moonraker the other day. I mean, wtf? I think most Bond fans would agree with me, so this is more so unpopular given only the public perception: Quantum of Solace is actually pretty good. It's nowhere near as bad as I see people saying it is. I see people say ""watch CR and Skyfall but skip QoS"" but I don't really feel like if you'd enjoy CR and Skyfall, you'd dislike QoS."
JamesBond,364ule,RGSagahstoomeh,10,Sat May 16 05:19:40 2015 UTC,"I say this all the time but the only thing that killed QoS is expectation.  Casino Royale is so great, and being directly linked to it, is it's biggest flaw.    I feel the opposite is true for Skyfall.  Everyone's Expecataions fell, and then sky fall was (imo) just good, and everyone loved the shit out of it.  Personally I'd rank the three CR, QoS, then Skyfall.    I'm very curious about your ranking of the Brosnan films.  Personally my Favorite is TMD.  It's the most fun of the four, but I'd still say Goldeneye is the best executed of his films."

Almost. ;) I honestly don't dislike Goldeneye, I guess I just think TWINE and TND are better.  I agree with you that in that I think TND is underrated.

I think GoldenEye has some slow bits that really suffer due to it's horrendous score.  The synthy crap takes the life out of a couple scenes.  I still love it, but I totally get what you're saying though.  I like Onnaptop.... I can't really justify it, she's a batshit silly character that just enjoy."

He is a good actor, but his role as Bond transforms the character from a bigger-than-life figure to a moody, generic and easily-forgotten action movie character  • Skyfall was a pretentious pile of crap. Aside from the almost insulting amount of 'symbolism' and 'artistic' measures, the plot was a mess too. Why would Bond play 'Home Alone' in some random abandoned mansion that's supposedly his 'house' over finding a proper bunker to hide from camp-a-mania Blondie Silva?  • new Q is a generic annoying computer nerd. Seriously? Why would you turn a hallmark character of the Bond franchise into a generic, easily-forgotten ripoff...oh.  • Die Another Day was a good movie.

Gave it a rewatch 3 weeks ago (first in 5 years) and I was amazed at how absolutely weak it was, and rife with crippling plot holes. Watching FRWL beforehand really contrasted how terrible it seemed, as everything in FRWL seemed plausible with true suspense at many turns (the train climax, especially). Goldfinger seems like a parody in comparison.  The one thing I enjoyed was how amazing those Switzerland shots looked in restored 1080p."

The clever-clever villain wants to kill Bond with a railway and his plan fails because he can't shoot in the courtroom. And why do they meet in Skyfall where I-am-not-Alfred-Pennyworth still takes care of the gas bottles? And why are computer viruses still like these annoying animated gifs like in the late 1990's?  The movie is far away from being the best Bond ever.

JamesBond,364ule,jaammyjames,0,Sun May 17 22:12:07 2015 UTC,How can you like Quantum of Lameace?
JamesBond,364ule,Zassolluto711,1 point,Fri May 22 00:13:16 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I do. Well it all started when I was a young boy growing up in the south of France... just kidding. No actually, okay, do I say it's perfect? No. But for brevity's sake I'll just list the top points and try to be short.   The cinematography and coloring. From start to finish, the picture is beautiful. The little bonus I love too is 4 of the major action sequences are based on the 4 elements. That sort of thing wins me over. And people can say what they want about the action cuts but, artistically, I just see them as an extension of Bond's mood at the time. He was in revenge mode.   Bond doing Bond things. He actually does some great spy work. Lone Bond is my favorite Bond. It's not bloody Mission Impossible. The man's a Double-0, let him take care of it.   The opera scene. It speaks for itself. Fucking brilliant from start to finish. It's just so smartly done.   Now here's the one I might catch shit for. The plot and villain do not bother me. The way I see it, manipulating people's water supply is just as evil as threatening the world with nukes. And I get it, people wanna be all boo hiss and lame villain and lack of memorable henchmen but then I hear people saying that another movie is too by the books. So whatever. I liked Greene, I loved Quantum, I love how Mr. White is sort of like this quasi-placeholder Blofeld, alluding to much more. Given the behind the scenes writers strike that was going on, I think what they pulled together was fine.   Gemma Arterton. My God, she is... she is just unbelievably gorgeous. Irresistible in the eyes of this viewer.   The final scene which ties up the Vesper loose end just fine. It's a great close. At the end of Casino Royale it didn't quite feel like the bitch was dead to Bond, there needed to be more closure. And suffice it say I'm not the biggest fan of Skyfall. I didn't like the feel of its deviation from the overarching plot. It didn't feel like the third part of a so-called ""origin trilogy"". It feels like the groundwork for a finale tale (dare I say... GASP! Bond dying). I wanted more from Quantum, I wanted to see Bond attempt to dismantle another portion of their operations a la Live and Let Die, the novel. With more thrills and higher stakes than the previous adventure. Spectre may or may not be that, which we'll see, but I feel Skyfall was a weaker follow-up to Quantum of Solace than people thought Quantum of Solace was to Casino Royale.  So call me crazy, call me an idiot, call me a heretic, burn me at the stake but I like the film. I've seen people name the out and out worst films of the franchise as their favorites. Unironically too. Now this is not my favorite, surely. But it's up there; easily Top 5.   Now the theme song? Eh... doesn't do much for me. I love Jack White but this just doesn't work too well. On its own it's not so bad but attached to a Bond flick it's kinda sour. Would have much preferred the rejected Shirley Bassey tune.   You still reading? Haha I doubt I've changed your mind, I know. But hey, I mean, thanks for giving me your time at least."

In You Only Live Twice, a movie that was lame in itself, Blofeld achieved radical new levels of lame by giving his arch-nemesis Bond a tour around the facilities as if he were a health and safety inspector come to grade the premises.  On Her Majesty's Secret Service was one of the worst movies ever made. Which is especially lame because it had many good moments, such as the opening and Tracey's introduction and that ending."

JamesBond,35ufi7,HappyFaceNinja,15,Wed May 13 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to me the obsession with Skyfall? I really don't understand. It's a good movie with awesome visuals, but it has the strangest shifts in tone, a completely unbelievable plot, and it goes on for a half hour too long. I don't understand how people rank it above Goldfinger and Dr. No."
JamesBond,35ufi7,dudelikeshismusic,4,Wed May 13 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"Skyfall, Goldeneye and Goldfinger are the most overrated Bond films IMO. All are completely solid entries, but I don't understand the love for them over a ton of other just as good/better Bond flicks. They seem to always be someone's absolute favorites and I wouldn't put any of them in the top 5 personally, except maybe Goldfinger just due to how influential it was."
JamesBond,35ufi7,thedeevolution,3,Wed May 13 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"Goldeneye has a solid villain, two great Bond girls, and Pierce Brosnan, the most charming Bond. I think it's comparable to The Spy Who Loved Me. Goldfinger has one of the most iconic Bond villains and has excellent pacing. I think it's a little overrated, but it's definitely one of the most important and influential Bond movies. Skyfall I just don't understand outside of aesthetics."
JamesBond,35ufi7,dudelikeshismusic,2,Thu May 14 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree. Skyfall's plot makes no sense and is pretty weak.  In Goldfinger, Bond doesn't really do or influence anything other than get a couple women killed. He's mostly just along for the ride, unless you accept the movie's implication that he fucked some sense into Pussy Galore and turned her against her boss. The movie literally wants you to believe it was his penis that saved Fort Knox.  However, Goldeneye is a pretty solid film. Yeah, the plot might be a little outlandish, but the movie stays pretty grounded overall. The humor is perfectly balanced with tone of the movie, and Brosnan is unbelievably cool as Bond (at least in this film).  I'm glad it made the list."

The cinematography in parts is great and I love the underwater sequence. Looking back at it, the underwater scenes seem fairly modern especially when you consider this was 50 years ago and long before the era of CGI."
JamesBond,35mavz,BungleBungleBungle,-1,Mon May 11 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"I don't hate this one. Yeah, I think for the time those sequences were new and spectacular. Underrated is a possible description. I say middle of the road. Title was only for the sake of a one liner."

Bond also claimed that she did not think it would be a role she would be forever associated with.  “I’d never seen a Bond film in a cinema and I had no idea of the scale of what I was getting into. I didn’t know it was a global thing. I thought he was just a British spy person.”  Bond also claimed that Pierce Brosnan was a better kisser than Sean Bean. She infamously locked lips with Brosnan in the penultimate scene of Die Another Day involving Moneypenny’s use of a virtual reality simulator, but some JBR listeners may not be aware that she starred alongside Bean in an acclaimed 2002 West End production of Macbeth.   http://jamesbondradio.com/this-week-in-james-bond-03-05-2015/"

JamesBond,35f8vn,Sucubis,8,Sat May 9 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"None of them have any continuity  aside from the Daniel Craig trilogy (the three latest films). There's no real contingency except for those and Bond changing actors is never addressed, so you can just start from the beginning with Dr. No."
JamesBond,35f8vn,That_Mad_Hatter,2,Sat May 9 20:04:25 2015 UTC,100% correct however OHMSS may be worth a watch as the events are referenced once or twice later on
JamesBond,35f8vn,worldrallyx,3,Sat May 9 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to count weapon usage as ""continuity,"" you could include the later Brosnan films since he switches over to the P99, which Craig continues to use in Casino Royale and I think also in Quantum before going back to the PPK/S."

JamesBond,35f8vn,kickstand,7,Sat May 9 22:26:50 2015 UTC,"Start with the beginning and watch them in chronological order. The changes in fashion and social mores are among the most interesting aspects of the films. Connery hits women, Moore dresses in a crazy blue tuxedo, Moore sleeps with a black woman because it's the Civil Rights era, that kind of thing. Also, a lot of fads like snowboarding or parasailing tend to make their way into the films."
JamesBond,35f8vn,Smileyjoe72,2,Sat May 9 21:54:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely one of my favorite aspects of the films. The Bond films try (and mostly succeed) to be very very cutting edge.

Some of the movies aren't exactly good but they all have aspects that are really entertaining and fun to watch."

JamesBond,35f8vn,akanefive,3,Sat May 9 22:27:41 2015 UTC,"There is a HUGE difference in Bond's character when portrayed by Craig than not.  The Craig films are a series reboot and are fundamentally different from the Bond we have come to know over the last 50 years.  I strongly urge you to let earlier iterations be your first introduction to Bond.  Only one or two films will suffice.  If you watch the Craig films first, there is a really high chance that you will not like the older James Bond movies because of how stylistically different they are."
JamesBond,35f8vn,Darkimus-prime,3,Mon May 11 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"Start with Dr. No, From Russia, With Love or Goldfinger.  Don't skip any Bonds. Try all the actors. They all bring something to the party. Start with an early Connery and move up. FRWL would be my personal choice of the 3 I mentioned but they are all good."
JamesBond,35f8vn,dragonsky,1 point,Sun May 10 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"I'd advocate for watching all of them (as would just about everyone here), but there are definitely a handful you can skip (and watch later if you get hooked). I'd say skip Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, A View to a Kill, and Die Another Day. The 60's Connery films are all worth seeing.  Other than the Craig films, they're more episodic, though the events of On Her Majesty's Secret Service are referenced several times in subsequent films. As far as the actors changing, it's no different than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney playing Batman (movie quality notwithstanding). It's understood that it's the same character, they don't try to explain why he looks different."

It actually uses the same cartridge as the PPK (.32 ACP), but the reason that it gets replaced is because it has ""no stopping power"", which doesn't make any sense when comparing the PPK to the M1935 since they share the same cartridge, but it does matter when comparing it to a 418 which uses a smaller cartridge."

I know in the book, Boothroyd also gives him a hammerless S&W revolver which he doesn't get in the film. Well can't a smaller cartridge be just as deadly, if not more, in some cases with it bouncing around inside the body? Such as a .22? If you ask me, it seems like a Double-0 agent would know how to make well placed shots like that with smaller caliber ammunition in order to make the kill. They're deadlier with less, which makes them such a special agent. That's how I justify it anyway.   Oh, another major difference book to movie.... Honey Rider ain't wearing nothing but the knife belt. Fleming, you horny, old devil."

JamesBond,350f9y,ReverendEarthwormJim,9,Wed May 6 03:02:18 2015 UTC,It's awesome how Craig is so rugged and macho
JamesBond,350f9y,someoneofimportance,13,Wed May 6 07:24:30 2015 UTC,"For sure.  I remember reading an article a while back talking about how each Bond actor's suits have been slightly different and reflected the way their particular portrayal of the character, for ex. Brosnan's looser-fitting tux to accompany his freewheeling ""I'm Bond but don't give a damn, let's just have a swingin' good time"" vibe, compared to Craig's much tighter, ultra-sharp outfits to go along with his colder, 'sharper' performance."
JamesBond,350f9y,dilplunk,20,Wed May 6 08:09:42 2015 UTC,"Brosnan (possibly exclusively) wore Brioni suits in all of his films.  The typical Brioni cut has broad shoulders, but it's brought in at the waist.  This results in quite an imposing image, apparently inspired by English formal military dress, however, when the button is undone, due to the breadth of the shoulders, the sides tend to hang further out resulting in what looks like a loose fit.  They also suited Brosnan's taller and slimmer physique.  Brioni also kitted out Craig in Casino Royale, but there was some criticism that he looked a bit silly in them.  Brioni suits are good at compensating for a lack of a broad shouldered muscular build, but, due to Craig's shorter and more muscular physique, Brioni was a bit much.  Just take a look at this image: http://i.imgur.com/7FY4GeR.jpg  In my opinion, his suit makes his shoulders too broad, making his head look tiny.  While, on my first viewing of Casino Royale, I was blown away, on subsequent viewings, I found myself cringing at his choice of suit.  I believe the director or producers or wardrobe people must have realised their mistake after after Casino Royale acme out as Craig switched to Tom Ford, which uses a much simpler and contemporary look, which complement his build rather than compensate for a lack of one, as Brioni did with Brosnan."

JamesBond,34yvgg,Dhd314,38,Tue May 5 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, because he's a good actor. It's a physical representation of Bond which fits to the style of how the movies are directed. This reminds more to the Connery Bond movies than the Moore and late Brosnan ones. But he plays Bond also a bit mechanical for example when he speaks with M. More like a solider than a jet-set spy. That's a good style and he filled the figure in a long-lasting way.  The other part of the realism is not only the filming technique and acting but also the scripts and the composition of the personal side of Bond. Something that wasn't present in other Bond movies or not well structured."
JamesBond,34yvgg,ax_reddit,3,Tue May 5 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"Correct, I find that this new Bond is a militarily accurate representation of high profile spies in today's age.

JamesBond,34yvgg,redisforever,7,Tue May 5 18:55:47 2015 UTC,Yes.  Skyfall has defined his stint in much the same may that Goldfinger did for Connery. I wish he was a bit more suave and at times I think the producers focus too much on his grit but if I have to choose between yes and no I say yes.  The only past Bond I'd consider answering in the negative would be Roger Moore. But he was good in his own way.
JamesBond,34yvgg,RowdyRabbi,5,Tue May 5 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"No. I don't like him. I think Craig is a good actor and I blame the writers, not Craig. They have played up the Thug and erased the Suave part of the character. I, too, long for a lighter but not super light Bond. I don't want a Jason Bourne knock off film. I want a James Bond film. I've said it before and I will say it now. Bond should be part cold killing machine and part Man-About-Town. Nothing personal, Daniel. You are a good EON soldier. You are just doing what you're told."

JamesBond,34yvgg,someoneofimportance,4,Wed May 6 07:27:49 2015 UTC,I don't hate him but he's not my favorite
JamesBond,34yvgg,MonkeyKing_,4,Tue May 5 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, he's probably my favourite Bond. Sure he can't charm like Connery could, but everything he does is badass in the way everything 007 does should be, and I think he's the best actor of the lot, he's delivered more convincing performances consistently than any other Bond."
JamesBond,34yvgg,eoinster,4,Tue May 5 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"I've never met him.   He's solid in the role, though. When they rebooted Bond in Casino Royale, they wanted a refined thug with hidden depth, and Craig is absolutely all over that kind of role. Having seen him previously in Layer Cake and Munich, clearly he was capable of playing a man of violence and drive but also a contemplative man with charm that lies under the surface. The characterization and the actor clicked, and we've gotten three solid Bond movies in a row (yes, I enjoyed Quantum of Solace quite a bit), and the next one looks great. It's no surprise that for an entire generation of Bond fans, Craig is a clear favorite.   That having been said...  Craig would have utterly failed in Brosnan's role, though. Or Moore's. He would have been okay in Lazenby's, but other than From Russia with Love, Craig would have been in trouble in Connery's Bond movies. Bond isn't one character, he's a new character for every generation which is informed by a number of factors, including the actor taking the role. While Craig has surprised me since becoming Bond, particularly with his outstanding performance in the American Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, he's a very particular type of actor. Can you imagine him with lasers in space? Or delivering Brosnan's dialogue with Jinx on the beach? Or being put in makeup to look Japanese?"

JamesBond,34yvgg,communistrobot,3,Tue May 5 20:54:15 2015 UTC,"Craig is good. Doesn't look the part at all. His style is almost outdated now. Gritty/real era is coming to an end and I am sure the masters of marketing that be will respond to it.  Seems like he can really hurt someone. Seems dangerous. Seems like he enjoys booze- drunk, depressive when not busy. He's pretty good at what he does. But that is all he is good at. He can be suave, flirting with Vesper or Severine- maybe with Moneypenny? He has sex, but he doesn't seem like he enjoys it terribly much. He just doesn't look like he enjoys any of this. I mean he has the money (Bond) but he is way too pissed off or angry all the time.   He's not a good looking guy. Bad hair. Bond should be handsome. Have good hair. A useful body- not a perfect one.   He's a good actor he kicks ass as bond and is a great transition from Brosnan- Who had to be Bond, but killed the development of the character.  I really love Bond- character needs to stay plausible and stay away from gritty. That said, bring on Spectre."
JamesBond,34yvgg,Bobsdirtydonut,3,Wed May 6 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"I don't really like him. He's a good actor, yes, but he always seems too serious and gritty.  Too much like every other action movie character."
JamesBond,34yvgg,mrgage,3,Wed May 6 04:32:38 2015 UTC,"I like Craig as an actor but not as Bond. His 3 Bond films are great action flicks, but not what I look for in a 007 film."
JamesBond,34yvgg,KneelYung,7,Thu May 7 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"No. I don't like him as James Bond. Neither his looks, nor his take on the role. I see him as a brute, mindless, yet obedient. No charm, wit or class. He would be great as Red Grand saying ""You may know the right wines, but you're the one on your knees."" Perfect pick for an old-school russian henchman. And if you say 'But that is how a spy should act!' - I agree. A REAL spy. But not James Bond. I get why people love him, everything now has to be gritty, dark, realistic, brutal and desaturated. But I hope next Bond will be lighter, wittier and more FUN to watch. I guess Henry Cavill could deliver this kind of performance I look for in a Bond movie."

JamesBond,34yvgg,wkfink,1 point,Sat May 9 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"He wasn't Skyfall-depressed in the books. Skyfall was an adage to an agent spiraling into death, the books were of a spy, charming yet tough who went on his missions instead of downing Heinekens and crying. There was also humor in the books, unlike the unhappy, serious art major movie Skyfall."
JamesBond,34yvgg,Badmecha007,1 point,Sat May 9 10:27:33 2015 UTC,"He absolutely was, especially in YOLT. The entire lead up to him going into the mission in Japan shows M being worried about him, and him describing himself as lethargic and taking no pleasure in life.  There were one-liners in the books. Very little over the top humor and campiness like in the late Connery and all of the Moore films, which it seems like most of Craig's detractors want the franchise to return to.  What's not realized is that the franchise literally cannot return to the Moore era camp, because Austin Powers so effectively lampooned it. It would be a huge joke if they came out with a Moore-style Bond film today."
JamesBond,34yvgg,wkfink,0,Sat May 9 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"Why is is that Austin Powers=bad? Explain to me this: so many people have panned him on this thread. While it is stupid to bring back OTT Bond, it is not stupid to bring back fun Bond. So what if Bond has some fun? Is it now a sin to have fun? Has society really melted into such a Demolition Man type place?"
JamesBond,34yvgg,Badmecha007,1 point,Sun May 10 07:51:20 2015 UTC,"Because Austin Powers is a lampoon of Bond. It takes the ridiculous parts of Bond (which weren't part of the original books) and exaggerates them even more to ridiculous (and hilarious) effect.  Very few people want to see a comedy when they go see a Bond film. They want a spy thriller. Yes, Bond's quips are a nice addition, but there is absolutely a point of too much being way too much."
JamesBond,34yvgg,wkfink,1 point,Sun May 10 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"And I doubt people would want to see a pretentious art major project about the suffering human condition when they go to see a 'spy thriller' either, which is what Skybore tries to be. This works both ways, you know."

There are 8 other Double-0's that would make awesome spinoff stories that wouldn't change anything if they're white, black, purple or sparkly.  Jame Bond is a white character- rather than ret-con everything, just make a NEW character.   ""But different actors have played Bond""  Yes.  All white and european.  Making a black Bond changes the dynamic-and for what? We know african, dutch, inuit and samoan all CAN do the job- this role is a white guy.  Without making it official canon that Bond is a code name given to different people its simply unnecessary and removes many from the movie.    Idris Elba is an amazing actor, just as is this gentlemen. 007, James Bond, however is a white european."

That's race based logic that's not based in reason, it even goes against the reasoning presented within the same argument. It's just idiotic. I would have more respect if people just said that it's too different for their tastes and move on instead of trying to explain with stupid, unrelated examples (yes, I'm talking about the idiots who now want to see a white Martin Luther King)"

He has only been that in the past, but that doesn't mean he can't be nonwhite.  Can Shaft be white? If he comes from an oppressed, underserved underclass in which he fights the majority corrupt powers that be, then yes.  One should only ask him or herself, are there currently any people of color in the British secret service? (I'm talking real life, not an Eon production).....

JamesBond,34x28m,CaptainRegor,7,Tue May 5 13:43:18 2015 UTC,Very true.
JamesBond,34x28m,dudelikeshismusic,24,Tue May 5 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"The first three Craig films are about getting over your first love, giving up, attempting suicide, wallowing in self pity and then realizing your friends and family will always need you (MI6 and M in Bond's case). They're the reason I'm not dead.  You've also heard pop music, so I don't need to go into details about a terrible breakup. But suffice it to say it involved the person cheating on me. I tried killing myself.  5 days later Skyfall came out. I've always been a huge Bond fan, but it wasn't until I went to go see this movie in a suicidal depression that I realized what they were, and why I was balling my eyes out when Bond says ""Resurrection"" to Silva. That's when he looks inside for 5 seconds that lasts for 5 hours and goes ""Fuck this. I'm James fucking Bond and I'm not going to die because I'm depressed. Fuck this. Fuck this guy. Fuck him trying to hurt the people I care about.""  Casino Royale: Falls in love. Get's heart broken. Denies he's in pain at the end ""the bitch is dead""  QOS: Does the whole get over someone by getting under someone. Realizes this just winds up getting two people hurt (in the real world it's a lot of emotions, in Bond's it's death by oil, but still), so after Strawberry Fields dies he decides not to sleep with the Bond girl. They have a heart to heart about pain and what it feels like, he confronts the person who ""ended his relationship"" with Vesper. But like real life, this guy actually didn't end it. He wasn't one of the people in it. So confronting him isn't going to give Bond closure, though he thinks it should.  Skyfall: He thinks he should be better mentally. He's worse. When the opportunity to die/commit suicide comes up, he's tempted. Normal dudes would do it with a knife or something, bond holds a gun to his head in the form of a scorpion, because Bond movie. He also is a pill popping, indiscriminately fucking no name women, drunken asshole. He's stuck in his own head, worried about his own shit, not concerned about anyone else. Then his home country gets blown up and someone tries to kill his mother. He was enjoying death, but not anymore. Time to sack up, motherfucker. ""Resurrection""   So now I'm getting the tattoo ""With Pleasure, M. With Pleasure"" for my birthday this year, so I never try to do it again. 5 times is enough. It's been 3 years, but I wouldn't be here without these 3 films.  TL:DR I agree  PS. Sorry for getting all deep and shit on a Bond subreddit."

It inspired the same sense of wonderment I had when I watched the old Bond movies as a kid. Really glad you've framed the Craig movies in this light, it's given me a lot to think about.

JamesBond,34nw6v,sayguh_,4,Sat May 2 22:03:07 2015 UTC,"Nice list. I too liked Lazenby's more vulnerable portrayal of Bond, and I absolutely loved the gritty, down-to-earth style that OHMSS was filmed in. I would have loved to seen George get a few more films. It would have been interesting to watch him mature as an actor.   If I may ask, what put you off of Live and Let Die so much? It's generally considered one of the better Moore films. I'm curious to know why you liked it less than some of the weaker/sillier films like Moonraker and Die Another Day."
JamesBond,34nw6v,Stringfellow__Hawke,3,Sat May 2 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"Those 3 films were all very close for me.   See above for why I didn't like Live and Let Die as much.  Yes, I found George's Bond was very similar to Craig's and I really enjoy that style of portrayal"
JamesBond,34nw6v,akadros,3,Sat May 2 23:09:10 2015 UTC,"I am currently going through the movies in order with my daughter (we just finished Moonraker) and I would say that i mostly agree with your rankings with a few exceptions. For some reason when we watched On Her Majesty's Secret Service, it just seemed boring this time even though I loved it the first time I watched it. Maybe it was just that Lazenby just didn't have the charisma that Connery had, I don't know. But I would probably move it down quite a bit in my rankings.  Also, there is something about Live and Let Die that I really like, aside from the stupid ending and the annoying redneck.  Maybe it was because Solitaire was so hot or maybe it was because it has my favorite theme song, but i would certainly have it a lot higher.  I do agree that Die Another Day absolutely sucked and it is the only one that I never bothered rewatching. I know you haven't ranked The Man with the Golden Gun yet, but that one would be very close to the bottom of the list for me.  The stupid redneck was in it significantly more and completely out of place and the plot just seemed to go nowhere."
JamesBond,34nw6v,bleuchamp,1 point,Sun May 3 13:29:28 2015 UTC,Very cool that are ratings are so similar.   I've watched OHMSS twice recently and I liked it a lot both times.   I'm not a big fan of Dianne Rigg casting though.. if the Bond girl was better it could compete for #2 slot.   It has a great soundtrack too.   Everyone here seems to disagree with my LALD rating.   I'm thinking maybe I should revise and put Moonraker and Die Another Day underneath it.  It should maybe have a few more points for Jane Seymour and the theme song which is certainly one of the best.   The Sheriff is responsible for at LEAST 10 deduction points though and possibly closer to 15.  Thanks for your comments

JamesBond,34nw6v,deowolf,2,Fri May 8 02:13:51 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the curiosity!   I'm a James Bond fan, but I'm a movie fan before that. A View To A Kill has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It could also be a script problem, but the dialogue is just laughably bad. Also, it has Indiana Jones Crystal Skull syndrome where the protagonist is just too old to be taken seriously. It's not just the fact that Moore was 57, it's the fact that this is in no way worked into the script, and we are supposed to act like it's the same James Bond as in any other movie. The Beach Boys didn't help it either. I wish I could look past the flaws, but the dialogue and performances really keep me from enjoying it. No other Bond movie does that to me, though the slide whistle and Tarzan yell are notable low points."
JamesBond,34nw6v,CelebornX,2,Fri May 8 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yes.  You know what?  I'm an idiot and did the thing where I confuse the titles for Living Daylights and View to a Kill.  Completely agree with you, and am shamed by my mistake.  I will now go have a double bourbon."
JamesBond,34nw6v,BTill232,2,Fri May 8 02:26:41 2015 UTC,Very good rankings. I feel the same way about the general way you've got them rated. My only complaints are that GoldenEye is too low and Octopussy is way too high.
JamesBond,34nw6v,CelebornX,1 point,Fri May 8 17:15:27 2015 UTC,"My same complaints, although I also would have bumped Live and Let Die up a bit. I thought that one was a pretty enjoyable movie (way more than Octopussy) and it gets bonus points for the song.  Otherwise, great list!"

To be fair to the guys, my vocals were super shitty because I just couldn't get it that day for some reason, and I'm not a producer by any means, so some of the levels were not great.

JamesBond,34ijtp,akanefive,2,Fri May 1 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, Lazenby and Peter Hunt didn't really get along on set - Lazenby had an attitude problem and he and Hunt rubbed each other the wrong way. Also, you're right, they didn't do much to promote the new Bond. There was no ""George Lazenby IS James Bond."" But by that point, he had already stated he wasn't coming back."
JamesBond,34ijtp,akanefive,2,Fri May 1 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"Largely, it was just George Lazenby being immature.  He generally had a background of being macho and egotistical, and viewed being James Bond as less of an art and more as a status symbol.  Simply put, he enjoyed the fancy dinner parties and getting laid every night more than making the movie itself.  And then when the counterculture came around, he left James Bond because it wasn't ""in style"" anymore."
JamesBond,34ijtp,icefire1020,2,Fri May 1 15:01:28 2015 UTC,"Right, but I don't think Hunt is blameless either. I read that he wouldn't talk to Lazenby during the shoot, kind of a forced method acting thing. So an odd combination of a miscommunication and a star with a bad attitude would make everyone want to part ways. I don't think the producers lost much sleep over it, truthfully."
JamesBond,34ijtp,sayguh_,2,Fri May 1 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"Lazenby made the choice himself to leave.  During the time, it was the counterculture era, and his agent convinced him that James Bond would never survive through the 70's because it was too violent for a new generation of peace-loving young people.  To be fair, nobody could've predicted that James Bond would've been a major franchise lasting 50+ years.  I also agree that they didn't market Lazenby well.  Even the directing of the film shows this.  With Connery, the camera would pan to his face whenever he delivered the one-liners.  With Lazenby, they would have a zoomed out approach, mostly focusing on his body, whats around him and not much on Lazenby himself."

From Russia with Love is NOT the first Bond film to introduce SPECTRE.  Dr. No and Bond have a conversation about the organization in the first film when discussing Dr. No's membership. Bond does not introduce himself as ""Bond, James Bond"" the first time when Honey Ryder comes out of the ocean - he literally said it in the first 10 minutes at that casino. But I agree with the rest of the guys in this comment thread: How the fuck did Quantum of Solace make it onto this list?"
JamesBond,34ecvj,the_Ex_Lurker,0,Thu Apr 30 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"what I meant by the introduction of SPECTRE was that we see the top villains in person for the first time. I could have clarified that.

As for Quantum, well...I really like Daniel Craig."

Seriously, I understand the hate for the Moore era here, but arguably some of the most memorable Bond moments occurred during his films.  People seem to forget the Bond is an action ADVENTURE hero- nit picking through the series to get something similar to the current take on Bond is ridiculous."
JamesBond,34ecvj,akanefive,4,Thu Apr 30 15:02:09 2015 UTC,You're right. They're not making Bond films anymore and have not since at least Living Daylights. I enjoy a lot of Moore's films and he needs to get a little more love.

JamesBond,34ecvj,jamedudijench,2,Thu Apr 30 23:17:58 2015 UTC,Much of LTK is lifted directly from Live and Let Die. It's one of the most directly Fleming Bond films in the series.

JamesBond,34ecvj,jamedudijench,2,Thu Apr 30 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"The living daylights isn't better that any Moore movie- that's an ridiculous comment to make. It was very poorly received when it came out because it wasn't very Bond like. Too many people are nit-picking what they want in a Bond film and disregarding other films as trash.   Bond is no Bourn, despite what younger fans may be looking for in a Bond film. Bond was originally designed to be an action ADVENTURE hero, and based off of that criteria, the Moore films provide a much more entertaining experience."

JamesBond,34ecvj,jamedudijench,2,Thu Apr 30 15:10:19 2015 UTC,Not a bad list but Quantum and Skyfall are iffy to me. Plus Moore should get a nod for Spy Who Loved Me. I agree that Goldfinger was probably Connery's peak.
JamesBond,34ecvj,haxbro14,3,Thu Apr 30 14:58:29 2015 UTC,Roger Moore fans are not going to like this list...but I think it's pretty spot on. Roger's movies wouldn't make any of my top ten lists either. Sorry guys.

JamesBond,34dqjc,UlfrGregsson,6,Thu Apr 30 09:17:31 2015 UTC,"In Skyfall, the pistol Q gives Bond is a ""Walther PPK-S 9mm short."" That's your standard .380 auto round.   The PPK-S is slightly bigger than the original PPK and I believe holds one or two more rounds in the magazine.   Also, on your gun it should say ""9mm Kurtz"" or something like that on the side. I believe ""kurtz"" is the German word for short."
JamesBond,34dqjc,Lexpert1,2,Thu Apr 30 19:57:22 2015 UTC,Nailed it. The PPK/S is essentially a PPK slide/barrel on a PP frame.
JamesBond,34dqjc,nealius,3,Fri May 1 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there was a reason for the switch back to the PPK. IMFDB doesn't specify the calibre of the PPK in QOS or Skyfall. In Dr. No, Q says it's a 7.65mm, so it could be the rest of the films.  Interestingly, in Octopussy, Sir Rog uses a Walther P5, though they don't mention anything about why."

JamesBond,34dqjc,BungleBungleBungle,2,Thu Apr 30 10:28:29 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain that in Skyfall Q states that Bond's issued gun is a 9mm. That gun is ditched in the komodo fight scene however and I'm not sure what he picks up after that.
JamesBond,34dqjc,non_troppo,2,Thu Apr 30 11:05:48 2015 UTC,"9mm short, if I remember correctly. Same thing as .380ACP."
JamesBond,34dqjc,nealius,2,Thu Apr 30 13:36:21 2015 UTC,"If that's true, then it is a .380 since that's the only 9mm PPK"
JamesBond,34dqjc,peltforth,2,Thu Apr 30 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"I always wondered why he switched back too.  I don't think they ever specify but my best guess is the Craig films are sort of about bringing Bond back to his roots, so it seemed fitting."
JamesBond,34dqjc,panopticonisi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:48:21 2015 UTC,"The ppk is iconic as far as bond movies go, but with the Craig era of movies they should have updated his firearm to the Walther pps or something along those lines.   The ppk is fairly heavy and underpowered compared to todays offerings. I haven't perused european gunshops or anything, but 9mm is pretty prevalent in European issued firearms, so I imagine 9mm being easier to source than 7.65 these days, which I believe was some of the reasoning given for his use of the 7.65 round in the first place.   The pps offers a 6-8 round capacity in a much more concealable (slim and light) package. The rounds being more powerful 9mm rounds is a good bonus.  But keeping the old gun was probably fanservice and I can't fault the producers for that. The crap about the handgrip identification being a statement of sorts in skyfall was cringeworthy."

JamesBond,34d3i7,foxh8er,1 point,Fri May 1 04:36:10 2015 UTC,Ebert isn't comparing the films though. He rates based on his enjoyment and seeing if it did what it set out to do.

JamesBond,34b7up,UncleThirsty,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"Well I feel there's a difference between being the worst movie and which one is more watchable. I think they are both poorly made films. Die Another Day is extremely agregious with how bad it's CG is and all of the references to the franchise, but it is a more modern film and does have some very watchable scenes. Thunderball to me was boring from beginning to end and was in need of some heavy editing. For it's time film making was much different, but seeing it for the first time in 2015 it's a different perspective. Also a review is more than it's letter/number. ;)"
JamesBond,34b7up,pinkpanthers,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"Because Die Another Day, while being a complete shit show, is more watchable than Thunderball. Also these are reviews as I watched the films in order and perspective changes things. Also I really didn't like Thunderball lol."
JamesBond,34b7up,dragonsky,2,Wed Apr 29 21:44:06 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the same thing. Besides an under-water fight scene the drags a little (at the time it was considered far too advanced to not milk the money invested into shooting it) I think the movie is in the top 10, and I can understand why it would be in people's top 5.  The film has 2 of the most sexual bond girls in the series. It has an EXCELLENT plot- nuclear warheads go missing, all 00 agents are called in and they have 3 days to find the weapons; Connery gives a great performance; one of the best theme songs of all time; great sound track... the movie is a 4/5.  I don't understand some of his other ratings, specifically how TWINE or Skyfall can be ranked so high- but it's all subjective."
JamesBond,34b7up,Theleux,2,Wed Apr 29 21:27:20 2015 UTC,I know there are a lot of defenders for pretty much every Bond movie but watching Thunderball I just couldn't wait for it to be over.

JamesBond,34b7up,pinkpanthers,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:14:53 2015 UTC,OHMSS is actually one higher than the actual written review. FYEO is one I listed as wanting to rewatch. I could see that one going up on a second watch I think I was more burned out on Moore by that point.
JamesBond,34b7up,BlueIceClimber,2,Thu Apr 30 01:32:39 2015 UTC,i could hardly make it through FYEO. definitely like your list and dont agree with every rating but close enough for me (plus its your opinion

It's not that it's the worst or anything, it's just remarkably average. It's so middle-of-the-road that I have a hard time watching it. 9 times out of 10, I'd voluntarily watch DAD over FYEO because, even though I consider DAD the worst by a large margin, it's a lot more fun to watch the train derail than two hours of...not much at all in FYEO."

JamesBond,3478fl,Stringfellow__Hawke,8,Tue Apr 28 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"There is definitely more continuity in the books than the films, but aside from the Blofeild Trilogy (Thunderball, OHMSS & YOLT) I remember them still being fairly episodic.  Live and Let Die is a direct followup to Casino Royale, so I do recommend reading it before starting Moonraker, but its not necessary to understand Moonraker. IIRC, M does make a passing mention of what had happened in LALD at the beginning of Moonraker.   There are other small bits of continuity sprinkled throughout the books which I enjoyed when I came across them. For example, Tiffany Case from Diamonds are Forever is referenced briefly in ""From Russia with Love"" which sort of addresses the question of ""Whatever happened to the previous Bond girl"" that the movies never really acknowledge (save for Vesper in the Craig series). For this reason I recommend reading them in order but don't think it's necessary."
JamesBond,3478fl,BungleBungleBungle,2,Tue Apr 28 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"I would agree with all that.  Also, if OP wants to read ""in order"", a couple of scholars have put together what they believe is the correct order of events: you can see that the early novels are fairly well matched to the publication order, but the short stories are all over the place and some of the events within even individual books have different timescales.  I think they did this based on real world events referenced as well as references to previous fictional events and characters."

Craig is my favorite followed by Connery. Connery also embodies exactly what you picture when reading the books. I think Dalton and Brosnan are tied at third and are interchangeable to me. To me both are great and Dalton suffers from only having two movies. Roger Moore is fourth for me. A great Bond but I prefer some seriousness over the silliness. Lazenby is last for me, the guy just couldn't fill the role but his movie was better than his performance."
JamesBond,346gyu,adventcrash,6,Tue Apr 28 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"Dalton is my favourite, closely followed by Craig. I do think the Craig era produced better films, but Dalton's performance is truer to the literary character. To each their own though.  Connery and Moore are in third and fourth, interchangeably depending on how I feel ATM. Brosnan takes the penultimate spot, and Lazenby is last."

JamesBond,346gyu,martin_italia,2,Tue Apr 28 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"It's a tie between Connery and Craig for me.   Connery's Bond is the most charming person who has ever appeared in any movie. Craig's Bond has some actual depth in the character, more reminiscent of the book. It's a shame Connery never got to do OHMSS to show the other side of Bond because he would have definitely pulled it up."
JamesBond,346gyu,PawsButton,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:23:11 2015 UTC,Truth.  It's hard to imagine how much more weight that would've thrown behind OHMSS.  (It's almost as much a shame that Lazenby didn't do DAF- could've been a pretty serious revenge picture instead of the sorta campy version we got.)
JamesBond,346gyu,jamedudijench,2,Wed Apr 29 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"I've discovered a new infatuation with Dalton. In TLD he blends both a serious, tonally accurate Bond with some subtle wit that can be found in rare pockets in the books but used heavily throughout the other films. That, I found to be refreshing and underrated. As opposed to Brosnan's wavering charm and grit in his films. In LTK, that is where I found Dalton hit the Bond nail on the head. He superbly hit the mark in creating a Bond performance, and thus a film, that turned out to be worthy of being called a better and more accurate adaptation of the novel Live and Let Die. I gave Dalton a shot and he delivered.   That being said, Craig has endeared me to the franchise with his contemporary, yet Fleming-worthy performances as 007. He's a Bond that feels real to me. Not to say Dalton doesn't feel real but Craig feels more versatile to me in terms of being a multidimensional man of secrets and romance. He succeeds in being a Bond who is fiercely loyal to Queen and country AND a man of exquisite taste. The ideal and quintessential globetrotting super spy.   So my loyalties definitely lay between to two. What I can say about Connery is he's definitely the ideal movie Bond of his time. But it stops there. There's eventually a disconnect on a personal level where Dalton and Craig feel like they have more to be unraveled. Same goes for Moore. He's a movie Bond of his time that did something different for the role, whether good or bad it's surely entertaining. Moore and Connery and Brosnan bring the joy I receive from reading a comic and Dalton and Craig bring the satisfaction I get from reading a novel. And Lazenby? Well I think he gets unfairly judged for only having done only one movie; we're unable to really see how the role would have evolved. But he clearly had no care or respect for the role. At least Connery cared enough to return on 2 occasions.   But there's my answer a Craig/Dalton split."

JamesBond,340322,colenotphil,8,Mon Apr 27 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"No, he didn't. Sony offered 28 mil, Samsung offered 50. There will likely be a Samsung galaxy 6 in the movie."
JamesBond,340322,bigboss2014,5,Mon Apr 27 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"And this is what I don't get in this whole story.  My understanding always was that the heavy Sony product placement in the Daniel Craig films was because of Sony practically being co-producers. I can't imagine they needed to make an offer for something of theirs to appear in the films. They were making them.  So, what changed? Why do they have to outbid someone in order for a cell phone, for example, to appear in Spectre?"
JamesBond,340322,lindblumresident,3,Mon Apr 27 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Sony is a hug company. Like, fucking HUGE!!! and it's all separated into completely different divisions, which are then yet again subdivided into different continents and sometimes then again into different countries. So Sony pictures US owns Columbia, and I imagine there's a lot of gaps between them and Sony mobile UK, they're practically 2 different companies, but they'd be able to communicate much easier than outside companies."
JamesBond,340322,bigboss2014,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:09:56 2015 UTC,"Being somewhat of a Playstation fan for quite the years, I am aware of all that. Sony's different divisions are, for all intents and purposes, completely different entities.  I still find it hard to believe that Samsung could just waltz in and outbid the producers themselves for that. Like, I find it hilarious they even had the opportunity to do so."
JamesBond,340322,lindblumresident,13,Tue Apr 28 04:53:53 2015 UTC,"Thank God. The less, the better. The product placement in Casino Royale was painful. Look at this amazing Sony Ericsson phone! Look at me driving my wonderful Ford automobile. Ugh."
JamesBond,340322,Tropps,6,Mon Apr 27 12:36:38 2015 UTC,The Ford rental car was the only thing that bothered me. Not that he was driving a Ford but that they shot it like a car commercial as he drove to the hotel.

JamesBond,34189m,adventcrash,4,Mon Apr 27 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Great review, as always. We appear to have very similar views on the series overall. Quantum of Solace is better than it gets credit for. The decay in opinion on this one is always interesting to me. It was well-reviewed when it was released (though not universally acclaimed like Casino Royale), but movie bloggers act like they always thought it was garbage.  There's a lot to like about Quantum: the direction, like you said, is done with purpose and intent, and is not just getting from point A to B, which I like. Bond and Camille have character arcs, something lacking from many earlier films. The action is intense and exciting. The music (other than the title song) is really strong.  That said, it's missing something. I think they were really hurting from the lack of a writer on set and it shows. I'm not sure who, but someone else on this sub said it best: Quantum is like a good drink but it's missing the ice. Exactly."
JamesBond,34189m,akanefive,3,Mon Apr 27 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like this is a movie that gets much better in retrospect,  especially after the release of Skyfall because I feel like it's the situation where when it's the last one in recent and it's not the best and your brain is like ""This is all I got?"" but then when the next one comes out and is great then you're like ""Eh that last one wasn't so bad"""
JamesBond,34189m,ObliviousCharles,2,Mon Apr 27 16:48:38 2015 UTC,gotta agree Quantum gets better each time i watch it
JamesBond,34189m,ObliviousCharles,3,Tue Apr 28 03:01:33 2015 UTC,Honestly I already want to watch it again.
JamesBond,34189m,akanefive,2,Tue Apr 28 04:21:26 2015 UTC,Honestly get goosebumps when the sound of the Aston Martin's engine kicks in during the opening. The only thing that bugs me is the title song. David Arnold's song was much better it would have fit the tone of the movie. Nothing against Jack White or Alicia Keys.
JamesBond,34189m,RABIDSAILOR,2,Tue Apr 28 04:36:44 2015 UTC,Something I forgot to mention in the review is that I actually like the song. It feels in tone with you know my name from casino Royale and is similar in the sense of I hated it at first but came to love it over time. It's not one of the best songs but I enjoy it.
JamesBond,34189m,akanefive,2,Tue Apr 28 05:06:51 2015 UTC,It would have been much better if either Jack White or Alicia Keys didn't sing on it. Their voices grate on each other.

There's nothing remarkable about him apart from being a bit slimy.  Bond villains aren't meant to be slimy, they're meant to be bombastic.  As for the General, that's the kind of ""villain"" the A-Team used to routinely despatch on a Saturday night inside an hour while I had my pie & chips."
JamesBond,34189m,jjness,2,Mon Apr 27 19:58:03 2015 UTC,I actually think Greene is far more realistic than Graves (gene replacement therapy aside). A maniac disguised as a philanthropist is really interesting to me.

JamesBond,33htjs,Stringfellow__Hawke,3,Wed Apr 22 19:35:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for reading! Yeah I get a little excited talking about this era of films. Craig really brings it to another level.
JamesBond,33htjs,herbieflynn,5,Wed Apr 22 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"This is great. Definitely a top 5 movie for me. I wrote a review I never finished before and your review touched on a lot of those points. Here it is: There was a time when I believed published criticism was foolish. A tool used to try and exhibit one’s own prowess for condescension. I then came to realize that attempts to break down the complex elements of the arts can lead to to deeper understanding and therefore greater pleasure taken, education for the creation of better future works, and increased exposure that could help someone to find a great movie or record that hadn’t been on their radar before. I believe in criticism that exposes positive aspects of films, and learns from what is seen as negative. I write these reviews to expose art that has greatly impacted me or the culture I know.  Casino Royale is my first Bond film.   Have I seen bits and pieces of Brosnan and Connery’s shadow-casting behemoths? Yes. But I wasn’t born and bred into the Bond culture. My first experience with the franchise, at an age where films had truly started to resonate with me, was Casino Royale. I digested the picture without a preference for it’s lineage. It changed me entirely. In ways it has stunted me, in others it’s helped me flourish. A few close friends of mine were paralyzed by it, drifting slowly into a state of alcoholism because of the keystone piece that Royale laid into the overarching cultural structure they bathed themselves in the shadows of. The film’s raw power stunned my young contemporaries. Anyone who chose to give themselves over to the film was forever shaped by it. As the credits on Martin Campbell’s picture rolled it was clear a jet-black paint job was drying on a popular new model from what some had thought was a fading film series. The new James Bond was clean. At a time when gritty reboots were on the rise, Casino Royale honed a style that Batman Begins introduced a year prior. Filled with complex emotions, Daniel Craig’s ruthless embodiment of a man whose soul is sand in a hand that clenches and opens on a whim was relentlessly moving.  Upon initial viewing, the surface components of the feature come across magnificently.  The score from David Arnold is an imperial work on it’s own. The compositions can bring back a fond childhood memory that quickly turns into a nightmare. The flourishes on cuts like “Solange” and “Aston Montenegro” can send a sonic wave through your cells that makes you feel that you are Bond. You’ve felt his pain, you know his strength, you’re calculated soldier and a gentleman. The luscious strings and brass maintained throughout can make you feel the infatuation, and right when when the harp twinkles you feel your insides warm.  swooping strings that flourish into rattling triumph  touching piano that touches like tear drops   lavish, exotic vacation music with bad ass tendencies  classy hi hats that make you want to put on a three piece  string sections that cause your most intimate memories to surface.  bass that makes you feel smoother than molasses  The cinematography provided by Phil Meheux compliments each scene’s emotions beautifully. A late-night dining sequence towards the second half of the film is so warmly lit that it turns Bond’s smile from charming to intoxicating. From the lusty emerald waters at the Ocean Club that mirror Craig’s blazing eyes to the silencing darkness that accompanies many of the villain Le Chiffre’s scenes (portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen), Meheux displays his mastery. The dialogue is also instantly memorable. With just enough pop ambition, writers Purvis, Wade and Haggis (the latter of which many think had the most influence) craft a script that wields the ability to move plot while moving thought. Bond’s late night luring of Italian siren Solange is embedded in your definition of smooth after this encounter:  Bond Can I give you a lift home? Solange That would really send him over the edge, I’m afraid I’m not that cruel. Bond Perhaps you’re just out of practice. (Solange smiles)  This written exchange can’t be done justice even when you learn that the vintage Aston Martin Bond drives Solange to his place in has just been won from her husband in a card game and Bond only collects her to gain intelligence for his rogue objectives. You have to watch it. Similarly silky conferences occur between Bond and the equally lubricating Mathis whose playboy tendencies leave you blushing in your theatre seat. Craig’s depiction of Bond’s breakdown is so convincing because the script is so polished. After you see what Bond has had to do, you understand how a heart can be turned into a block of ice. But when you see Vesper in her vibrant purple, you realize that no matter the size of the block, it will melt if she gives herself to you. As you begin to sift through why the film stays with you, one comes across the acting and genuine tendencies of Casino Royale. Craig, whose character is a direct descendent of the one he plays in the film Layer Cake, is a tailored fit for the new Bond. Cutting like a diamond with a soft sense of humor, the new Bond is never going to leave you in stitches, but will always give you something to think about as you watch him walk away. Equal parts heartless and seductive, Daniel Craig convinces you the born killer cocktail may have more in it than malice and obedience. Vesper, played by Eva Green is the ideal opposition for such a character. Her wit is initially masked by her orderly intentions and eventually brought to the surface, the naked emotion seen in her tearing eyes while the shower water runs.     When you first see Casino Royale it may seem as though it’s drawn out, but after repeat viewings you find it’s just the right length to allow for the proper digestion of the emotional scale they put to the test during the film. When I watched the extended scenes of Royale I understood why they were cut and was content with how Stuart Baird edited the film. His touch for keeping scenes brief was immaculate and always left enough for the imagination.   Shots Themes In popular culture -hardened man -to drift to alcohol in the wake of personal troubles (which is obvious when you watch it, but is powerful nonetheless, the joking and caricaturist copy of the main character’s actions until they become a reality. Until it feels real. If you were to meet this incarnation of  James Bond he would be quiet. An observing and calculating soldier. Entertaining to many, but in person, he would make poor company. Solemn cool with a need to best whoever else was in the room. Unable to let his guard down. For my friends without life experiences to guide us through our tough times, we lean on films, and the writers who shape our culture and our attempts to game the system by piggy backing on the lines they chose for us. When James Bond walks into a room and effortlessly picks up a woman with his seething charm and unforgettable swagger, the men in the audience are stunted. This man is the known alpha of our world. When created in this film by a genius director, he becomes even more powerful without the corny, fantasy lines. It almost becomes a documentary, and what works and what doesn’t for him becomes all the more real. The men walk out trying to be him, shedding normal conversations for slightly squinted eyes and what we believe are devastating stares."

JamesBond,33jqxx,MrBigD77,9,Thu Apr 23 02:02:15 2015 UTC,Honestly I think Quantum doesn't get enough credit for it's look. I'm rewatching it now for my reviews and that film looks really great. I love the shot in the beginning when Bond is chasing that guy and they fall through the glass.
JamesBond,33jqxx,adventcrash,5,Thu Apr 23 13:39:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. There is some gorgeous imagery Quantum. Even the beginning where the camera flies over the water towards the in-progress car chase is absolutely fantastic.   I think the cinematography in QoS is overlooked by many because of the way the fight scenes were filmed. And the fact that the symbolism in the visuals aren't as in-your face as they were in SkyFall.
JamesBond,33jqxx,Stringfellow__Hawke,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:29:29 2015 UTC,I agree with that. I've only seen Quantum all the way through twice but I rathered enjoyed its cinematography as well. I really enjoy all of Daniel Craig's Bond Films.
JamesBond,33jqxx,Stringfellow__Hawke,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see people finally appreciating the Craig films for what they are. Everyone says that he's become too much like Bourne, but that's fine with me. Bourne is a badass, and so should Bond be.   I appreciate the Moore films as some of them were fun, but even as a kid I wanted my Bond films to be grittier. The Dalton films were on the right track but they were still throwing in campy jokes that broke the suspension of disbelief. Goldeneye was a great start for Brosnan, but then they inexplicably pivoted back to the Moore style films thereafter. I love that they finally went for broke with Craig and started making serious non-formulaic Bond films. Craig truly is the Bond I always wanted since I first set eyes on the 007 logo."
JamesBond,33jqxx,foxh8er,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:57:05 2015 UTC,"A enjoy a few of the Moore films, Connerys were great, love Craig's and i don't know why really but I loathe Brosnans films."

JamesBond,33jqxx,WhiteBoythatCantJump,2,Thu Apr 23 14:34:31 2015 UTC,"That low tracking shot of Lake Como is, for my money, the single greatest cinematography in the entire franchise."
JamesBond,33jqxx,GetFreeCash,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"The beginning car chase scene is unrivaled for car chases, though I didn't really enjoy that the beginning was just a car chase"
JamesBond,33jqxx,adventcrash,6,Sat Apr 25 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"This shot from TSWLM is one of my all-time favourite cinematic images. It's the scene where Jaws is driving the van to the Egyptian ruins and Bond and Anya are in the back, dozing off. An instrumental version of ""Nobody Does It Better"" plays in the background and it's just a beautiful scene altogether."
JamesBond,33jqxx,akanefive,2,Thu Apr 23 04:15:29 2015 UTC,That's a great shot. A lot of the cinemetagraphy in that film is great.
JamesBond,33jqxx,Stringfellow__Hawke,3,Thu Apr 23 13:38:51 2015 UTC,The scene of Bond in silhouette in the door frame when he's looking for Fekish is also really great.
JamesBond,33jqxx,WhiteBoythatCantJump,3,Thu Apr 23 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite visuals in Skyfall are during the scene where Bond fights one of Silva's henchman underwater after they fall through the ice. Especially, when he lights the flare to find his way to the surface. Talk about breathtaking (no pun intended). That whole sequence is one of my favorites in the whole series.    Now, I don't have a lot of love for Skyfall due to the issues I have with the plot, writing, continuity, and lackluster musical score; but I absolutely cannot dispute that the cinematography and visual symbolism peppered throughout the film is outstanding."
JamesBond,33jqxx,foxh8er,2,Thu Apr 23 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"I almost put that scene in there as well. I'll agree with the musical score issues, I was happy with where both major Bond themes are used.  Mostly when you first see the Aston Martin. I get chills every time."
JamesBond,33i9qw,Zen_6291,9,Wed Apr 22 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from. What makes me love the Moore Bond is the fun he seems to have as a secret agent. With the exception of Connery, nobody else really seems to ENJOY going on missions and sleeping with ladies and drinking martinis. He makes me want to be a spy, which makes his movies fun to watch. It's certainly not as grounded in reality as Craig's Bond, but that gives the films more freedom to ignore his emotions and burdens, and let's them play up the women/action/witty one-liners that (to me) are my favorite part of the series."
JamesBond,33i9qw,KneelYung,9,Wed Apr 22 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"I hated Moore the first time I saw him. Years later, I like him a lot and consider him the Bond actor I'd most like to meet. I realize now that he was the perfect actor for the time to play Bond and his movies are very watchable. He's not my favorite Bond but I gained a lot of respect for him and he's also a damned Fun Bond.  Cheers, Sir Roger !"
JamesBond,33i9qw,sigersen,6,Thu Apr 23 00:55:27 2015 UTC,"He's not my favorite (that will always be Connery), but I absolutely love Moore and his movies.  It probably has something to do with the fact that he was the Bond I grew up with (I was born in 1970)."
JamesBond,33i9qw,tspangle88,5,Thu Apr 23 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"Roger Moore brought charm to the role.  Not the smoldering sexiness, masculinity, brooding, or brutality that some other actors have brought (and I shamelessly love all of them!); the kind of charm that makes him feel more like a secret agent than a soldier.  He's a guy who seemed to know he wasn't the strongest dude in the room or the best fighter, and had to rely on other talents to get the job done, and that adds an oddly realistic dimension to things, despite the submarine cars and laser guns.  And I think it's interesting that he managed to be in one of the most ridiculous films (Moonraker), and one of the most grounded in reality (For Your Eyes Only).  Roger Moore was really great in the role."
JamesBond,33i9qw,PawsButton,5,Thu Apr 23 02:24:28 2015 UTC,"I think 'The Spy Who Loved Me' is one of the best 007 films, but I've immersed myself in the books too much to think of Moore as Cdr. Bond.  Nothing against the man himself. Sir Roger Moore earned that Knighthood on account of him being an excellent humanitarian, but his Bond films are definitely products of his time. Take that as you will, I mean it neither as a positive or negative. I will never try and take enjoyment away from those who enjoy his films. Just the opposite, they're more open minded than I.  Drunk edit: drunk"
JamesBond,33i9qw,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Fri Apr 24 02:59:22 2015 UTC,"I love everyone's thoughts and ideas on this. I too loved that in ""For Your Eyes Only"" they showed us a Dalton-esque glimpse of what Moore could have done with the role if his scripts were darker and more grounded in reality. My personal favorite Moore era Bond film, which is also my favorite Bond film overall, is ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". I felt it had a good amount of camp and silliness as well as getting the job done.   And to put myself into an even smaller demographic among Bond fans, I absolutely love the guilty pleasure that is ""A View To A Kill"". I rewatch it every so often and have such a good time with how fun and over the top it is. I realize it wouldn't rank among ""Goldeneye"", ""Goldfinger"", or ""From Russia WIth Love"", but I get so much comfy non-serious fun out of it.  Also, Live and Let Die is my third favorite Bond film overall, and I replay the moment atleast 5 times that Kananga inflates like a balloon and explodes with that ""whooosh!"" deflating sound effect. I'll always remember the Moore era as a fun, rip-roaring time where you can unwind and not have to be so serious."
JamesBond,33i9qw,KneelYung,2,Thu Apr 23 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"I too really liked A View to a Kill, but Spy Who Loved Me might be my least favorite Moore outing."
JamesBond,33i9qw,pinkpanthers,2,Thu Apr 23 06:17:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. I find it funny how many users here dislike Moore for his ""campyness"" but the TSWLM is his best movie. IMO, TSWLM is his worst."
JamesBond,33i9qw,outaccountant,3,Thu Apr 23 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"I really love him, too. I grew up first being exposed to James Bond through TBS's early-90s ""Thirteen Days of 007"" specials on Christmas, and by sheer volume, it was almost always Roger Moore (this was before GoldenEye was out or even being shown on TV).  Looking back now as a more seasoned fan, I really appreciate the self-aware mortality he seemed to have in the role and feel some of his movies are underrated (TMWTGG comes to mind, and I'll be damned if Live and Let Die wasn't somehow satisfyingly raw). OHMSS is still my top choice, though."
JamesBond,33i9qw,peppertea,3,Thu Apr 23 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's my favourite, but he's an entertaining and charismatic enough actor to carry the film along even when it's objectively not very good. They're a lot of fun, and I think that's down to his screen presence, at least partly."
JamesBond,33i9qw,karatemanchan37,3,Fri Apr 24 01:17:32 2015 UTC,"Moore's Bond was nothing but consistent at least. You go in knowing what to expect, and if you like that stuff, great! Personally, seeing him doing the same thing for seven consecutive films is a bit too much. Moore's stories sometimes felt like it was played off of a soap opera too."
JamesBond,33i9qw,pinkpanthers,5,Fri Apr 24 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"Moore is my favorite Bond, but he did have some of the weakest movies.  Moore had a charm about him, a sense of humor, some style and politeness that's just heart-warming."
JamesBond,33i9qw,karatemanchan37,3,Wed Apr 22 22:29:17 2015 UTC,Every Bond has had weak movies. The main 4 all started off strong and then the movies weakened.
JamesBond,33i9qw,Duck-You-Sucker,2,Thu Apr 23 15:02:41 2015 UTC,Ehh. Craig seems to be the only one still kicking ass
JamesBond,33i9qw,pinkpanthers,2,Fri Apr 24 03:04:05 2015 UTC,"Quantum is a weaker film, regardless of all the ""companion to Casino Royale"" poppycock."
JamesBond,33i9qw,fernando_69,3,Fri Apr 24 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"To add on, Skyfall will not age well."
JamesBond,33i9qw,pinkpanthers,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:04:56 2015 UTC,Because they are spending on fixing something that you have any issues.
JamesBond,33i9qw,Iswitt,2,Thu May 7 01:07:43 2015 UTC,"Moore doesn't get the credit he deserves on this sub because most of the users here are fans of the series but of the craig era. Outside of this sub, the majority of people I've met really enjoy the Moore films, and it's only here that I see such hate for his films.  That being said, Moore brings something different to franchise. His films are entertaining to watch. He has a serious side to him, but it comes out only when needed. He really enjoys being a spy, which makes his adventures even more enjoyable. While Connery is my favourite Bond, and Brosnan was ideal Bond, I have to admit that I've watched more Moore movies than any other."
JamesBond,33i9qw,sirgraemecracker,3,Thu Apr 23 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"To the contrary, I found Moore's era to be campy and silly. I still love the films for what they are, but I much prefer Craig or Dalton."

Moonraker has a certain stupid charm that, for me anyway, DAD lacks. Like you, I love the start of this movie. Wow, here comes the big escape from North Korea....nope !  That was great. What a set up for a cool Bond story. It's as if they had two directors and one guy left and they hired Ed Wood to finish it. Halle Berry is terrible, as you said. Your poke at Brosnan is interesting. I never noticed it, but you're right. It's as if he knows the movie is awful and he just does not care anymore. Every Bond has an over-the-top clunker and this is Brosnan's. It's a shame he couldn't have gone out on top. That being said: for the folks that like DAD, enjoy. I have a special love for Moonraker. It entertains me.

The plot is outlandish and nonsensical, the characters are parodies of themselves (BOND STOPS HIS OWN HEART FROM BEATING WITH HIS MIND), the action is uninspired, and even the photography and locations are dull and uninteresting.

I'm even ok with the speed with which Bond puts on the clown makeup in Octopussy. But stopping his own heart? NOPE."

JamesBond,33238z,1701ncc,4,Sat Apr 18 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"Bond is hostile to women when he thinks they are getting in the way of him doing his job. Here is an excerpt from the novel of ""Casino Royale"" in which Bond has just learned, from Mathis, that Bond will have a female assistant (Vesper) while at the Casino.   Bond was not amused. ""What the hell do they want to send me a woman for?"" he said bitterly. ""Do they think this is a bloody picnic?""   A few paragraphs later...   And then there was this pest of a girl. He sighed. Women were for recreation. On a job, they got in the way and fogged things up with sex and hurt feelings and all the emotional baggage they carried around. One had to look out for them and take care of them.   Bond is not always this way, though. Later on in the novel, when Vesper breaks down in tears upon Bond talking about his torture at the hands of Le Chiffre, he doesn't treat her with hostility. He's rather gentle with her.  We all know that Ian Fleming probably didn't have the most politically correct of attitudes towards women but I always got the sense that Bond was more of a professional and a pragmatist when it came to female relationships. He doesn't see the point in keeping women around when it interferes with the job."

JamesBond,32z9tz,arafinwe,7,Sat Apr 18 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"One of the things I love about the original Ian Fleming novels is that they actually explain Bond's office life. He has his own desk in MI6.

(I remember one novel saying that one of them had stopped communicating for several months and the status of his mission is unknown) He files paperwork, receives upcoming missions in his inbox, does research, and attends meetings with M to discuss work-related matters.

JamesBond,32y32b,SureAviator,4,Fri Apr 17 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Connery - he's the standard. He might not be your favorite, but he's the epitome of classic James Bond. Brosnan - his scripts were lackluster, but Brosnan brought charm and charisma tenfold. He was a mix of Connery and Moore, and it's really too bad that he starred in some of the weaker installments. Dalton - Dalton is the gritty Bond. Craig is great, don't get me wrong, but Dalton brings a Lazenby-esque feel as well as plenty of charm. And he goes easy on the jokes. Craig - Gritty and undeniably rugged, Craig does a good job giving Bond a dark side. He doesn't have much charm though. Moore - Where Craig lacks charm, Moore brings too much. He's not bad at all, but his Bond is pretty silly and just a little too much fun for a ruthless killer.   I'm not ranking Lazenby because he was only in one movie so I feel like I don't have enough material to form a good opinion."

Daniel Craig - The man can do action no doubt but by god he's so sour and dull with almost no charm. Where is the suaveness and the sophistication? The class and the elegance? Timothy Dalton - Gritty Bond Roger Moore - Comical, womanizing and sarcastic and cool. His movies might've been average but he was a great Bond. Pierce Brosnan - His movies were crap (except Goldeneye and Tomorrow never dies) but his scripts were bad. He was perfect for Bond. He looked the part, was very classy and suave and just was a great Bond. Sean THE MAN Connery- BOND. JAMES BOND."

Craig - Say what you want about his hair color, the dude is a pretty good Bond.  Moore - It's a shame the Moore era was full of mediocre movies, because I actually like Roger's portrayal of Bond. Dalton - I don't really understand all of the Dalton hype. In my mind, he was too...silly. I didn't really like him as Bond. Lazenby - Yeah, not my favorite at all.

JamesBond,32u7hw,BraveEyefilms,2,Thu Apr 16 23:18:06 2015 UTC,Ejiofor was up for Andrew Scott's role in SPECTRE. But they went with Scott because they couldn't afford Ejiofor.
JamesBond,32u7hw,Lorcav,2,Fri Apr 17 06:20:00 2015 UTC,"Iko is incredible to watch, but I think a large part of what makes his work exceptional in Gareth Evans' films is his relationship with Evans and Yayan Ruhian, that the three of them have developed a style and way of working that I think would be lacking if Iko was dropped into a henchman role in Bond."
JamesBond,32u7hw,MichaelJahrling,3,Fri Apr 17 07:26:12 2015 UTC,Gary Oldman would be perfect.

JamesBond,32u7hw,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Fri Apr 17 02:50:45 2015 UTC,I think Rachel Weisz would make a fantastic main villain for a movie. There is just something so unnervingly but very subtly dark in some of her performances (like in the Constant Gardner) that I can see her knocking it out of the park as a nemesis to Bond.
JamesBond,32u7hw,jbh007,5,Thu Apr 16 23:13:02 2015 UTC,That would be funny seeing Daniel Craig fighting his wife in a Bond movie.

It's a serviceable Bond film that gets remembered for a really bad casting choice and an indefensible last line. But everything in between is pretty entertaining. I like all the connections to OHMSS in this one. The title, the skiing, the abstract reference to Tracy by Electra early on. And I admire that this film makes an effort to show that Bond is impacted by the people around him."

I have to say that the more I think about it, viewing the movie with that in mind really does elevate it.

JamesBond,32oyam,adventcrash,7,Wed Apr 15 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"A very fair and balanced review. I love TND and watch it as much if not more than even Goldeneye. I think many people find fault with this movie because it followed Goldeneye. Almost anything would pale in comparison.   TND is a great Bond film and everyone is great in it. I think its main fault is it is too action driven for a Bond film. There is not enough build up. That being said, it might have made it boring. I did not find the plot far fetched in 97 and certainly not now. To a point I agree with you about notifying the Chinese and MI6 about Carver and then going out for a beer, but would the Chinese have believed this by just England's Say so ? (Plus the movie would only have been 40 minutes long) You're also right about Yeoh being a fantastic Bond girl and perfect for the time. She's as tough as he is and just as smart. Maybe smarter. I've always felt this movie deserves higher praise than it gets. It's just a very watchable Bond film."
JamesBond,32oyam,sigersen,3,Wed Apr 15 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. A someone who grew up watching Bond movies and particularly Connery/Brosnan films, I've always enjoyed TND. The ""following GoldenEye"" point is a fair one, GoldenEye was such a fantastic film and, while TND doesn't quite get there, it's a good movie. Wai Lin is one of my favorite Bond girls. The scene where they are showering and she cuffs him to the pipe is great."
JamesBond,32oyam,fightONstate,0,Wed Apr 15 17:33:41 2015 UTC,It's a great scene. They have good chemistry.
JamesBond,32oyam,RGSagahstoomeh,2,Wed Apr 15 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"Watchable is a very good way to describe it. I think the amount of action helps it, where I know another upcoming film was knocked for too much action as well, I think here it's actually a good thing. It probably would have been hard to stretch out this plot without some action to help it along."

JamesBond,32m93f,Lyrad1002,5,Tue Apr 14 23:04:19 2015 UTC,"For Your Eyes Only - the best period. SkyFall - the most quintessentially Bond sounding song Casino Royale - the way it starts out right after the gunbarrel scene is fricking awesome. The rest of the song takes some getting used to, but its extremely well integrated into the score. The World is Not Enough - another very Bond sounding song. Goldfinger, Diamonds Are Forever - ditto Another Way To Die Nobody Does it Better the rest."

JamesBond,32m93f,Jack_Sandwich,6,Wed Apr 15 04:23:30 2015 UTC,Chris Cornell - You Know My Name is pretty excellent but Carly Simon - Nobody Does It Better might be overall timeless best. Goldfinger is most iconic.

For one, I'm a big Jack White fan and I'll never forget being in the theater having no clue who got the song for QOS and hearing Jack White and being super excited.  Secondly, it's so different than most modern Bind themes that it just stands out to me."
JamesBond,32m93f,DLottchula,2,Wed Apr 15 06:13:33 2015 UTC,"I'm glad there are others who like this song. It's not my top favorite, but I do enjoy it a lot. The intro is extremely catchy.  ""You Know my Name"" catches a lot of flak from the mainstream, but to me, its a close second to ""Nobody Does it Better"" as my all time favorite Bond song.   The opening theme to OHMSS is absolutely stellar, probably my third favorite.   ""Live and Let Die"" absolutely rocks.   ""Tommorow Never Dies"" by Sheryl Crow is good, but it pales in comparison to KD Lang's ""Surrender""    I also like Tom Jones ""Thunderball"" a lot more than the movie itself, but I like ""Mr. Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang"" even better.  SkyFall is another song I like better than the movie it preceded. It's an instant classic, even if some of the lyrics are a little hokey. ""Let the sky fall... when we meet at Skyfall"" always bugged me, but Adele's voice and the booming orchestra that backs her up more than makes up for that unfortunate line.   ""Goldfinger"" is good, but I think its overrated.  My least favorite song is probably ""Moonraker"" on account that I don't think it could be any more boring."

JamesBond,32cc97,elevendayempire,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:49:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Spielberg's take on it was a perfectly acceptable idea for adapting the books, and one that would've made sense to Hollywood suits at the time. It's only with the benefit of hindsight that Warner Bros' outlandish plan to shoot seven films with an all-British cast (at the author's insistence) looks like a sound investment.  Plus, Spielberg's Harry Potter would still have been a more faithful adaptation than, say, Casino Royale. Either of them."
JamesBond,32cc97,elevendayempire,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"You're talking with the benefit of hindsight, though; yes, it's very easy to look back at the success of the multi-billion Warner Bros franchise and say, ""They clearly made the right decisions,"" but at the time they were being developed it was seen as a huge risk – just look at the trade magazines of the time, and you'll see they're full of articles asking ""Has WB bitten off more than it can chew?"" Taking a series of books, half of which had yet to be written, and adapting them into films using the same cast over a period of a decade or more, was seen as a massive risk.  Bear in mind that the production process for the film version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone started as far back as 1997, when only the first book had been published – at the time, it was a major media conglomerate taking a punt on a largely untested author, and JK Rowling wasn't the multimillion-dollar brand that she later became. She also didn't have as much clout at the time – witness the title change to the US version.  The process of changing stories as they're adapted for the screen by Hollywood is seen as par for the course; before Rowling's success, Hollywood producers thought nothing of ""Americanising"" films in order to maximise their appeal to US (and, given Hollywood's cultural dominance, global) audiences.   Indeed, you could draw a parallel with the very first James Bond adaptation; the producers turned James Bond into Jimmy Bond of the CIA, and Fleming didn't have the clout in Hollywood to change that. Rowling was lucky, in that the success of the early Potter novels empowered her to place demands on the producers; she was able to force them to cast the film with British actors."
JamesBond,32cc97,brave_joe,26,Sun Apr 12 20:34:46 2015 UTC,That's not the actor who plays Auric Goldfinger's real voice.  He was dubbed over due to his near inability to speak English.  Many of the early Bond girls are also dubbed due to thick accents.

JamesBond,32cc97,akanefive,15,Mon Apr 13 06:34:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks that James Bond wore a Rolex Explorer (or Sub if they're really off-base) because Fleming wore one, yet the Rolex Explorer came out in 1953, the same year Casino Royale was first published (and Rolex first mentioned).  Since Fleming finished the book in 1952, it's impossible for the Explorer (or the Sub) to be Bond's watch.  It would then have to be the Oyster Perpetual that Bond wore. Unlike in my picture, it was on a bracelet."
JamesBond,32cc97,wkfink,5,Sun Apr 12 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"In the films, Roger Moore is for sure wearing a Submariner in The Man with the Golden Gun though.   EDIT. Changed Timothy Dalton to Roger Moore. Redditing while drunk is hard."
JamesBond,32cc97,wkfink,3,Sun Apr 12 22:04:03 2015 UTC,I've always preferred the Omegas to the Rolexes for some reason. Probably because Bond's worn them since I was born
JamesBond,32cc97,jubelo,2,Sun Apr 12 22:08:13 2015 UTC,Roger Moore? Or a different movie?
JamesBond,32cc97,wkfink,2,Sun Apr 12 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"In the films, the watches aren't accurate to what Fleming intended. Moore wore a Seiko, for gods sake.  Connery wore a Sub, as did Dalton (and a TAG, horror of horrors), Brosnan and Craig have obviously wore Omega (Brosnan started with a 2541.80, then moved to 2531.80, Craig wore a 45mm PO in Casino, Quantum, and Skyfall, and a 2231.80 at the end of Casino, and an Aqua Terra after he came back to MI 6 in Skyfall).  Moore was the dark days. He wore Seikos and such, though he did have one or two movies where he wore a 5513 Sub."
JamesBond,32cc97,panopticonisi,2,Mon Apr 13 01:26:20 2015 UTC,"The Sub origin is simple: on the set of Dr No, Connery needed a watch. Cubby Broccoli gave him his, which just happened to be a Sub. Rolex themselves had refused to supply one free of charge and the production budget wouldn't allow the expense.  As for the literary watch, it was never specifically identified, only that it was silver coloured and on a steel bracelet. I agree that the Oyster Perpetual is the most likely candidate. Fleming said that the reason for the choice of Rolex was that although it's commonplace now, at the time Rolex was one of a very small number of watchmakers who offered luminous batons and hand markings.  Oh, and to complete your set: Lazenby wore a Rolex Model 6238 which is basically a Daytona as we now know it, although that term wasn't used until its successor, the 6239.  EDIT: Two corrections for you: Craig wore a 2220.80 in the second part of CR, not a 2231.80 (an older model which doesn't have the skeleton handset and is finished in a dull titanium), and in QOS, he moves to the smaller 42mm PO mainly because Craig himself didn't want to bulk up to the same extent he had done for CR and the 45mm looked too chunky on his leaner arm. Also, if you notice in CR, he never wears the PO45 with a suit, the first he's seen in one is on the train to Montenegro, and by that point, it's 2220.80 time. In QOS though, he's in a suit a lot more, so that also necessitated the smaller PO (I can testify to this myself, I have a 45mm 2907 PO (the CR one), it's a hefty watch and barely fits under a shirt cuff).  This continued into Skyfall where the Aqua Terra is even smaller, again because the producers wanted Bond looking as lean as possible."
JamesBond,32cc97,wkfink,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew of the film stuff. Thanks for the corrections on the reference numbers, I knew the watches, just fail in reference numbers off the top of my head (except for Speedmasters). Thanks for the corrections!  Edit: I don't know why I said 2231.80, I owned a 2231.50 for a bit, so I don't know why I'd confuse that ref other than I'm kind of dumb."
JamesBond,32cc97,jupitors_cock,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"Ha, I'm the other way, I'm pretty good with Seamaster serials, can't remember Speedies for the life of me (all the commemorative and special editions, can't keep up with them).  I have one (the basic moonwatch), it's my day to day ""office wear"", but dammed if I could recite the serial.  The Omega Canon reads:  Goldeneye: 2541.80 Seamaster Pro Diver  TND/TWINE/DAD: 2531.80 Seamaster Pro Diver  (These are basically the same watch, except 2531.80 is automatic, 2541.80 is Quartz.  The 2531 was the last Seamaster with a non-coaxial movement)  Casino Royale:   Planet Ocean ""Big Size"" (45mm), Steel on Black Rubber Strap (2900.50.91) (not the 2907 as I said above, slipped up there, the 2907 is the 007 Collectors Edition) Pro Diver 300m Steel on Steel (2220.80.00)   The 2220.80 is the successor to the 2531.80, with co-axial movement, applied markers (which are brighter), longer hands, and, a much more pronounced ""wave"" pattern.    Quantam of Solace:   Planet Ocean 42mm Steel on Steel (2201.50.00)   Skyfall:   Planet Ocean 42mm Titanium on Steel (232.30.42.21.01.001) Aqua Terra Steel on Steel (231.10.39.21.03.001)   A few people have said Craig wears a THIRD watch in this one, possibly the same 2008 PO42 from QOS.  I don't know, can't see closely enough, the only way to really tell is the bezel, the original was black, the titaniums all had grey.  SPECTRE: The publicity shots so far are inconclusive, but most people think it could be the just-released rebooted Seamaster, could be the Steel on Steel or the Titanium Version with the Blue Face, which would be a nice throwback. What is clear is that he's definitely wearing it on a nylon NATO strap, that's a look that's new, but I think quite appropriate: it's what you'd expect a covert operative to have on his watch. It's also highly possible that he could again wear more than one watch (this is a marketing tie-in after all, Omega have paid money for their products to be featured): I see they've already released a Special Edition SPECTRE Aqua Terra, so it may be the standard version of that.  I'm not as familiar with Rolexes TBH, but the original worn by Connery was a 6538 Sub.  Fleming himself was a diehard Oyster Perpetual and later Explorer man."

JamesBond,32cc97,Hurricane12112,6,Mon Apr 13 06:44:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest though, Skyfall doesn't necessarily disprove that. Since Casino Royale was a reboot, it could easily be the case that the first James Bond (Daniel Craig) was a real dude called James Bond, and any subsequent Bonds (once Craig leaves the role) can take on the Bond moniker as a codename and an homage to Craig's Bond"
JamesBond,32cc97,RedditTipiak,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:38:10 2015 UTC,Yea but you would have to account for the time difference. The theory would make perfect sense if the movies started with Sean Connery in the 60's with the technology of the time and continued towards the future. However given the increase in technology of Casino Royale 2006 it leaves alot of plot holes open.
JamesBond,32cc97,saratogacv60,0,Mon Apr 13 10:32:38 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter because the previous movies are technically no longer canon anyway. Casino Royale was a full reboot. Once Craig leaves the role and a new actor is chosen, that new Bond can easily be a man who is using the ""James Bond"" codename.  At this point in time, every movie before Casino Royale is irrelevant to every movie after Casino Royale. So the technology difference doesn't actually matter"
JamesBond,32cc97,akanefive,2,Mon Apr 13 01:37:53 2015 UTC,So 21 movies suddenly don't matter? I feel there is alot of Bond fans that would disagree with you. And sure you could say that the next actor will take on the code name of Bond but that hasn't happened yet so for the moment the theory is proven false.
JamesBond,32cc97,Clancy_B_Shanty,0,Mon Apr 13 03:11:28 2015 UTC,"In terms of the canon and the Universe, yes the earlier movies no longer matter. The older movies are no longer canon, and there are a lot of clues to this.  The opening scene of Casino Royale was Bond achieving double-0 status, meaning its definitely chronologically the first one. A lot of things in Casino Royale contradict the earlier movies - for example, Bond first meets Felix Leiter in CR, but he also meets Felix for the first time in Dr. No. Which means either Bond forgets who this is, or these two movies are not in the same canon.  Additionally, Bond doesn't hear about SPECTRE unitl Dr. No, so either the upcoming movie is actually a Dr. No remake, or they are (again) not in the same Universe.  I love every Bond movie that came before CR (with a few exceptions), but its pretty widely established that the new movies are their own Universe"

I hadn't seen Octopussy since mid 2004 and I remember not really liking it. But watching it again after nearly 10 years it really was one of Moores higher tier outings.

JamesBond,32eb3u,wherewuz,2,Wed Apr 15 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I think before rewatching it would have been in my bottom five overall and one of the worst Moore's. It moved up to being one of my favorite Moore's (TSWLM is still my favorite but it's probably in my top 5 overall) and in the top 15 overall. Maybe even in the top 10.   The train action sequence, the plane action sequence at the end, the jungle chase (Tanzan yell aside, which I actually sorta liked this time around)...It's very fun. It drags just a bit and the faberge egg plot isn't my favorite, but I think people focus a lot on its worst moments. Gobinda is a great minion too."

JamesBond,32adzi,JohnnyReeko,10,Sun Apr 12 01:10:27 2015 UTC,OHMSS was supposed to be filmed before YOLT but was for a number of reasons postponed. The production of OHMSS is covered in the Wikipedia article.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Her_Majesty%27s_Secret_Service_%28film%29#Production

JamesBond,32adzi,thegeneral400,5,Sun Apr 12 04:20:32 2015 UTC,It's a great question. And if the answer is that Blofeld knew from the start (can't remember if that's a possibility) then how could MI6 ever think he wouldn't?
JamesBond,32adzi,Smileyjoe72,3,Sun Apr 12 03:00:21 2015 UTC,Maybe the ridiculous tuxedo kilt thing was supposed be a distraction? It certainly would distract me.
JamesBond,32adzi,Smileyjoe72,2,Sun Apr 12 03:01:14 2015 UTC,I think they chose just to wash over it to be honest as they wouldn't be able to adapt OHMSS with Blofeld being able to recognise 007.
JamesBond,32adzi,1q2w3e4rqwe,2,Sun Apr 12 04:11:28 2015 UTC,"An early version of the script supposedly included a scene where Bond had surgery to disguise his face, thereby also explaining the change from Connery to Lazenby. Wisely, it was ditched, but Blofeld's apparent memory lapse might've been an overlooked side-effect."
JamesBond,32adzi,Shanyi,2,Sun Apr 12 11:59:53 2015 UTC,Soft reboot
JamesBond,32adzi,chrisc098,2,Sun Apr 12 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"I'm totally fanwanking here, but I think the movie works if you interpret that scene as Bond and Blofeld both knowing who the other is, but playing a game of chicken."

JamesBond,32adzi,dieNal,2,Mon Apr 13 13:27:35 2015 UTC,"I read OHMSS a long time ago - but I'm planning on rereading all the Fleming, so I'll get back to it eventually. In the novels chronology, it's their first meeting.  In the context of the films, I think you can interpret it to say, Bond obviously knows it's Blofeld, but needs to gather evidence of his operation. And Blofeld obviously knows it's Bond, but figures it's safer for his plan to keep him within arms reach. (Especially considering Bond's not in contact with anyone outside.)"
JamesBond,32adzi,akanefive,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:36:46 2015 UTC,Not to mention in the previous movie Blofeld has Bond captured and sees his face many times. It was something that really bothered me about that movie too. No matter what the production was like they should have made some sort of reference to this.
JamesBond,32adzi,adventcrash,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:44:00 2015 UTC,"It's down to the fact that they suddenly switched to the book order and how events are sequenced in those. Bond in the book of OHMSS meets Blofeld for the very first time,this was included in the film despite them already meeting on screen in YOLT. It's no game or contest,just a new movie timeline."

JamesBond,324w77,dgener151,13,Fri Apr 10 16:34:30 2015 UTC,"From Russia With Love - The best. Maybe the finest spy film ever made. Red Grant is a beast.  Goldfinger - Best car, best henchman, one of the best villains. It's dated, but impeccably entertaining. Connery at his best.  Casino Royale - Craig's best performance. Stellar from top to bottom. Exciting and emotional.  Live and Let Die - A personal favorite for nostalgic reasons. Best Bond song. Great villains.  Goldeneye - 006 is my favorite villain, Xenia my favorite femme fatale. A perfect movie of its time, bridging past and present. Before the Craig films (and even since) this is a go-to for introducing people to Bond.  Skyfall - Just too visually stunning, brilliantly acted and breathless to place any lower. It doesn't get as many rewatches because it's almost TOO intense (I prefer my Bonds as lazy day hang-out films) but it's damn good. On Her Majesty's Secret Service - Lazenby is just okay, and some of the Hilary Bray stuff drags, but that's all that's keeping this one from top five, if not numero uno. So frigging good. Best orchestral theme of the series.  License to Kill - It's a total Joel Silver knockoff with Bond as Riggs (does that make Sharkey Murtaugh?) but I'm an 80s action-head so it's the perfect formula for me. Robert Davi? Coked to his eyeballs Benecio? Carey Lowell in that black dress?! Forget about it.  Moonraker - Yeah, I know, I'm alone on this. Fuck it. Drax is a god-tier villain and I'm a sucker for clownish Jaws. It's not as entertaining once it gets to space but before that it's fun, fun, fun. Tomorrow Never Dies - I just always liked this one. It's not great by any means but it always keeps my interest. I think Pierce is great and I wish he got more good material. His face off with Vincent Schiavelli goes from hilarious to cold as hell. It's also got one of my favorite Q sequences.    The rest I will just list, because I will ramble forever.   The Spy Who Loved Me The Living Daylights Dr. No Quantum of Solace A View to a Kill You Only Live Twice Diamond are Forever For Your Eyes Only Man with the Golden Gun Octopussy Thunderball The World is Not Enough Die Another Day   My tastes range from genuine quality to camp. I just love Bonds of all styles. To me the cardinal sin is being BORING."
JamesBond,324w77,WithShoes,2,Fri Apr 10 21:39:56 2015 UTC,"I love seeing so many people put FRWL about Goldfinger. Goldfinger gets all the press, but From Russia is the quintessential classic spy movie. I put Craig's good ones ahead of it, but I could just as easily have From Russia on top."
JamesBond,324w77,Shanyi,6,Fri Apr 10 23:36:50 2015 UTC,"Bond fan since watching Goldfinger as an awe-struck six year old. Now twenty-nine. Still getting ridiculously overexcited about these things.  1- From Russia With Love: Goldfinger may be my personal favourite, but objectively, From Russia is one of the best spy movies of its era and an exceptionally vivid adaptation of one of Fleming's finest.   2- Goldfinger: What more is there to say? Every scene is iconic, every line a killer. Not just the defining Bond, but an essential part of film culture.  3- OHMSS: Despite some odd storytelling choices and Lazenby's accent, arguably the best character-based Bond movie yet produced. Diana Rigg, as always, is perfection. Lazenby gives a hugely underrated performance, with Savalas offering a louche, well-rounded interpretation of Blofeld.  4- Licence To Kill: Controversial this high up? Maybe, but Dalton is exceptional, the action is some of the best in the series, Sanchez is a legitimately dangerous villain and there's a nice smattering of Fleming in there to boot.  5- Skyfall Plotholes be damned, Skyfall is gorgeous to look at, has terrific action, a rare memorable modern villain, and M as the Bond girl. A worthy 50th anniversary entry.  6- The Living Daylights Dragging Bond back into the Cold War spy thriller genre for the first time since From Russia, TLD returns Bond to his roots in the best possible way, building on Fleming's short story and anchored by a commanding Dalton debut.  7- You Only Live Twice Yeah, it's way over the top, but enormous fun with it and the Japanese locations give it a very distinctive flavour. Connery's coasting, but there's plenty of fun to be had here, even if it almost completely ignores (IMO) Fleming's greatest book.  8- Casino Royale Craig's performances may have hit diminishing returns following his debut, but it was a hell of a debut. Wobbly dialogue and structural messiness aside, this is as close to Fleming's Bond as has ever been seen on-screen. Set the series back on track with a great Bond and the lingering threat of a new evil lurking in the shadows.  9- GoldenEye Much like Casino, the dialogue can be squiffy, but Brosnan gives a terrific debut, Xenia is the series' most audacious villainess and Alec is a fantastic villain. Modernises the classic ingredients without losing or overcooking the humour.  10- Octopussy Yes, Bond dresses as a clown, but for a Moore film, the plot is pretty original, there are some memorable characters and set-pieces, the love interest is age-appropriate, India looks ridiculously gorgeous, and the cringey humour is mostly kept within reason.  11- Dr. No The original and still a cracker, with many of the elements already in place and firing on all cylinders. Connery is magnetic, Ursula rocks that bikini, and Bond is cold, cruel and immediately iconic.  12- The Spy Who Loved Me Often cited as Moore's best, the movie is a barrel of fun despite a forgettable main villain and recycled plot. An absolute romp, if rather uneven.  13- Thunderball The underwater sequences go on forever, but there's still much to like here. Largo's great, Domino's a jaw-dropper, there are some great lines and terrific set-pieces. It's too long and drags badly at times, but still comes out an overall winner for me.  14- Live And Let Die A very mixed bag, but when it works, it's terrific. Yaphet Kotto and Geoffrey Holder dominate the screen against a slightly uncertain Moore, but Jane Seymour does nice work with Solitaire/Simone Latrelle and the vodou trappings are nicely creepy.  15- Moonraker God help me, I can't help but sort of love it. Most of that is down to Michael Lonsdale's hilariously deadpan Drax, who seems to treat the whole thing like a slightly tedious game and whose supply of magnificent zingers is never-ending (""You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season""). The whole thing is so stupid it goes full circle to being fun again.  16- For Your Eyes Only At the opposite end of the spectrum, FYEO tries to bring some seriousness back to the series, but ends up feeling quite ponderous. Never quite adds up to the sum of its sometimes quite strong parts. Gotta love Topol, though.  17- The World Is Not Enough There's a great movie in here, but buried deep in some lousy pacing, bland action and woeful attempts at humour. Marceau and Carlyle are fantastic villains and there's an honest to god plot twist, but it falls some way short of its credible ambition.  18- Quantum Of Solace Bond has rarely been less Bondy than the rampaging sociopath depicted here. Quantum is developed in an interesting way, the plot deserves credit for being realistically low-key, Camille is an engagingly feral Bond girl and there are big improvements in the second half, but it's a huge mess from start to finish.  19- The Man With The Golden Gun Christopher Lee almost saves the whole damn movie on his own, with a little help from Herve Villechaize and Maud Adams, but there's just too much idiocy and witless humour to overcome. Plus, why is everyone so grumpy?  20- Tomorrow Never Dies As nondescript an actioner as imaginable, Bond is little more than a flouncy clothes horse in the first half and Terminator in the second. A game Michelle Yeoh is wasted, Jonathan Pryce does his best as an interesting modern take on the traditional megalomaniac, but TND is the series' most instantly forgettable entry.  21- A View To A Kill A Bond movie is only as good as its Bond girl, and Tanya Roberts is one of the worst ever. Christopher Walken is a hoot and Grace Jones a striking henchwoman, but the most serious danger Moore's Bond faces is the constant threat of breaking a hip from old age. Rubbish.  22- Diamonds Are Forever Unforgiveably throws away that heartwrenching OHMSS ending, Blofeld dresses in drag, Connery couldn't give even half a feck, Vegas is a dreadful location, the 'plot' is incoherent at best and the tacky 'humour' is a constant drag.  23- Die Another Day CGI surfing. 'Yo momma'. Halle Berry in general. CGI gunbarrel bullet. Toby Stephen's sneer. Igor. Madonna's song. Madonna. Directed by Lee Tamahori, a man who understood the character and series so little he invented in an interview the malignant cancer that is codename theory. Killed forty years of continuity with its awfulness, and only saved by Never Say Never Again being somehow even worse."
JamesBond,324w77,MRR1987,3,Fri Apr 10 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"Wobbly dialogue and structural messiness aside,   ??  Casino Royale has the hands down best dialogue out of any of the Bonds. The wittiness back and forth between him and Vesper is great."
JamesBond,324w77,Marcanadian,3,Sat Apr 11 12:39:28 2015 UTC,"This is going to get buried but I'm bored so I might as well...  My picks are fairly fluid. I have a general idea of which films I enjoy more than others, but an exact ranking is difficult. But here's an idea:   1) GoldenEye - I put this as number one mainly because it was the first Bond film I can remember seeing. It's what got me hooked on the franchise and the countless hours I spent playing the video game only let me appreciate the film more. It's got one of the best villains in Alec Trevelyan, who has Bond beat several times. It has two great Bond girls, especially Xenia Onatopp who is one of the most intimidating female characters in the series. It's also got a captivating secondary villain (General Ourumov) who I loved to watch. I still think the final battle between Bond and Alec is the best raw fight in Bond history and that tank chase is just awesome. It's got a believable plot that propelled Bond back into relevancy.   2) Casino Royale - This movie did the same thing to the franchise that GoldenEye did, with the same director no less. It's a gritty action movie that still has the Bond wit and charm. Le Chiffre is one of the best villains and the opening parkour chase remains a favourite of mine. Again, the plot is believable yet outlandish enough to keep your attention. It's never boring to watch.  3) Skyfall - One of the reasons I liked this was because it took elements from GoldenEye. You sort of question M's past motivations, which makes you sympathize with Silva, who again, was a fantastic villain. Amazing cinematography and awesome set pieces. Having much of the movie set in London was also an interesting choice that made sense given the tidbits of Bond backstory we received.   4) Goldfinger - A must see for anybody interested in the franchise. It's classic Bond through and through. The final sequence at Fort Knox is exciting and intense. Oddjob is an iconic henchman and worthy of as much praise as Goldfinger himself, who can only really be described as a megalomaniac. I'm a fan of realistic plots, and while this was an impossible task to pull off, Goldfinger's confidence convinced me in a way most villains can't.   5) The Spy Who Loved Me - Moore's finest outing complete with an underwater car, ocean lair and the best henchman in Bond history. The locales are impressive and Anya Amasova ensures Bond is watching his back throughout the movie. Stromberg could have been a stronger villain, but I think Jaws' presence makes up for that.   6) From Russia With Love - The movie where SPECTRE really takes root. It's darker and grittier than most Bond films. Red Grant and Rosa Klebb are two formidable opponents that almost have you worried for Bond's fate. Connery proves why he's a favourite among many fans.   7) The Living Daylights - I'm sure a lot of people will wonder why I ranked it this high, but I think Dalton is a criminally underrated Bond and this is just a fun movie to sit through. It lacks a central villain, but the action is consistently exciting throughout. It has two of my favourite action scenes in the series: the winter car chase and the final epic battle.   8) Live and Let Die - Stylish and pure 70's, Bond walking the streets of Harlem feels so out of place yet captivating. Kananga is a great bad guy who is assisted by Tee Hee and Baron Samedi, two of the most outlandish yet intriguing characters. It's just a fun movie to sit through, so long as you can bear J.W. Pepper for more than a few minutes.  9) On Her Majesty's Secret Service - Ridiculous voiceover dubbing aside, Lazenby puts in a good effort in his only performance as Bond. Blofeld is always a joy to watch, and while the plot is pretty corny, it's offset by the impressive locales and chase sequences. Plus, it has a great but tragic ending that comes as a surprise to many unfamiliar with the series.   10) Dr. No - Great villain and a terrific start to the franchise. It's not a movie that's in your face, but it has good pacing. It introduces many of the classic Bond elements without it being over the top.   11) Licence to Kill - A pretty polarizing movie, but a decent revenge flick. Bond goes into territory we haven't seen him in before and it's pretty unpredictable. Leiter's gruesome dismemberment sets the tone for the rest of the movie: the grittiest and bloodiest Bond movie to date. Sanchez is a fantastic villain and the tanker chase is horribly underrated. Sanchez's death is one of the most satisfying.   12) Tomorrow Never Dies - A notable dip in quality from GoldenEye, but still an entertaining movie with Michelle Yeoh providing some great stunts. The motorcycle chase and Hamburg parking garage chase are two great sequences that are among Brosnan's best. Carver is a physically weak yet mentally strong baddie whose fairly simple master plan could yield the most damage.   13) Thunderball - That underwater sequence. Sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it. But the movie itself is elevated by a good story and a decent villain that keeps you interested.   14) For Your Eyes Only - A definite improvement from Moonraker, though Bibi is one of most annoying characters ever. Locque is great, but Kristatos is a pretty forgettable villain. Still, the rock scaling scene is tense and nerve wracking and the movie's got a Bond girl who isn't afraid to get her hands dirty. Diverse action set pieces and a good plot is somewhat held down by a really weird soundtrack.   15) The World is Not Enough - The longest but one of the best pre-title sequences raises your expectations, which aren't really met by the rest of the movie. I loved King as a villain and Valentin's return is always appreciated. It's dragged down by a fairly boring climax and Denise Richards. Just Denise Richards. Ugh.   16) Quantum of Solace - As a direct followup to CR, it fell flat in a way much like Diamonds Are Forever. But on its own, it's a decent movie with some of the most action. Though the movie would have been more interesting if it had followed Mr. White. Instead, we got lacklustre villains in Dominic Greene, Medrano and Elvis, whose role in the movie is still pointless to me.   17) You Only Live Twice - This one is sort of all over the place. Bond's ""transition"" is ridiculous, but I loved the Japanese setting. Donald Pleasence's Blofeld is the most iconic and his volcano lair, while totally unrealistic, is so cool. Connery started looking old at this point, but he puts in a decent effort.   18) Octopussy - The juggling around of villains kind of hurt this one, but each had their merits. The clown scene is rightfully given a lot of flack, but it's altogether a pretty entertaining flick that unfortunately lacks an identity that some of the other films are famous for.   19) The Man With The Golden Gun - Scaramanga is awesome, even Nick Nack is awesome. But Goodnight is one of the dumbest characters in the series and it really distracts from the imminent threat that Bond faces. J.W. Pepper is beyond annoying in this and I really wish he was axed from the movie. The flying car and the slide whistle are two gimmicks I could have done without.  20) A View to a Kill - Moore just looks like crap in this movie. He was far too old at this point and it was distracting. But Walken is such an insanely entertaining villain, and Mayday is just as attention grabbing. These large fictional companies, like Zorin enterprises, are always a draw for me. That blimp is such an appropriate mode of transport for a narcissist like Zorin, whose death is one of the greatest. Too bad Stacey's only purpose in the movie seems to be shouting ""JAMES!"" over and over, so that's disappointing.   21) Die Another Day - This movie suffers from the biggest dip in quality half way through. It starts off promising: Bond is captured and tortured by the North Koreans. MI6 has abandoned him and he's essentially on his own. A great premise that falls apart when they hit the ice palace. Moon's transformation is so unnecessarily complex: why is he speaking Korean with a British accent? The whole plastic surgery thing is just so out of place, along with the invisible car. They tried too hard to bring Bond into the 21st century, embracing all these futuristic elements that they figured the millennium would bring. Jinx has some of the worst dialogue in the series as well, seemingly consisting of immature one-liners that even Bond should roll his eyes at.   22) Moonraker - Jaws falling in love, I still don't get it. The most intimidating henchman is reduced to a mute giant who has the hots for a mute girl with pigtails. It was such an unnecessary twist that was only made worse by their venture into space. An invisible space station, a plot to create perfect human specimens and that stupid Venice gondola scene. It's so ridiculous that I have to laugh, but at least it holds my attention. It's worth a watch if you're not looking for anything serious.   23) Diamonds Are Forever - I'm just bored by this movie. Connery is much too old in this one and Blofeld in drag was pretty awful. I wasn't too fond of Las Vegas as a locale, at least not for the amount of time it was in the movie. There's a couple decent scenes, namely the elevator fight and the police chase, but they're weighed down by many of the cheap gimmicks that prepare us for the Moore era. It could have been a straight up revenge flick, but instead we get a Bond who seems disinterested and unmotivated."

JamesBond,324w77,Marcanadian,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah. He did a really good job introducing Brosnan and Craig to the audience, that I think he'd do just as well introducing whoever follows Craig."
JamesBond,324w77,mistermister98,3,Sat Apr 11 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service - the perfect Bond film. Lazenby's performance is outweighed by the pure awesomeness of the entire movie License to Kill - Timothy Dalton is my favorite Bond and this is easily his best. Wish the series could have gone on with him for at least one more film. Casino Royale - The opening 20 minutes or so includes some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. Craig is amazing as Bond and silenced all of the haters. Skyfall - One of the only Bond films with a certain mood surrounding the whole thing. It's very hard to explain, but it works out extremely well. Live and Let Die - The villains, the action, the song, the environments; although it's one of the most over-the-top movies in the franchise, it's still awesome Goldeneye - Brosnan puts in a really good performance as Bond, but I feel that the supporting cast really boosts this one. Thunderball - In my opinion, the most iconic Bond film of all time. It is also Connery's best performance as Bond. Goldfinger - Great characters and plot; I guess if you're only gonna watch one, watch this one. From Russia With Love - A classic film. The highlight is the fight in the train. The Man With The Golden Gun - Crazy and even stupid at some times, something about this one intrigues me. Scaramanga is my favorite villain in the franchise. The World Is Not Enough - Really fun movie. Although Denise Richards is definitely miscast, the rest of the cast is perfect. Moonraker - Don't get the hate for this one. Yes, it's stupid and cliched, but it's still a ton of fun. Tomorrow Never Dies - Although somewhat generic, Brosnan puts in another solid performance and the action is great. Dr. No - It's missing a lot of the things we come to expect out of a Bond film, but it also created many things too. Have to respect it for that. You Only Live Twice - Very slow beginning, but as soon as you reach the volcano lair, it's amazing from there on out. Quantum of Solace - Works best if viewed directly after Casino Royale. The action is pretty sloppy at some points, but I love Craig as Bond so much that I can look past that. The Spy Who Loved Me - Don't get the love for this one. I feel like I'm missing something. The Living Daylights - I love Dalton as Bond, but this film is almost completely forgettable. There's not much memorable in it. Octopussy - Pretty generic and Roger Moore is already too old for the part. For Your Eyes Only - The serious tone of this movie doesn't fit Moore's Bond at all. Die Another Day - The opening scene is cool. It's all downhill from there. A View to a Kill - Holy shit does Moore look old in this one. The whole film is a complete mess and there's not much redeeming about it. Diamonds are Forever - This movie blows. Connery doesn't want to be there and the whole movie is dated, stupid, and most importantly boring. I don't think I can ever sit through this one again."
JamesBond,324w77,GetFreeCash,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Care to elaborate on why you think Thunderball is the most iconic Bond film of them all? I'm not trying to provoke an argument, I'm just genuinely curious since it's not a commonly held opinion.  Don't ever feel like you're ""missing"" something by not finding TSWLM good. The great thing about Bond is that even the most popular of entries have their detractors, and vice versa. I don't really like OHMSS even though this thread is evidence enough that most people consider it to be a top-tier Bond film, but hopefully we can have an environment here whereby everyone can feel secure in voicing their opinions, no matter how unusual. :)"
JamesBond,324w77,mistermister98,2,Sat Apr 11 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that Connery gives his best performance as Bond here. The jetpack, the Aston Martin, an appearance from Blofeld/S.P.E.C.T.R.E, a great Bond girl; the list goes on. I also really like the underwater scenes and don't get why some people don't. It's just a great movie and is one of the first things I think of when I think of Bond."
JamesBond,324w77,dudelikeshismusic,3,Sat Apr 11 04:03:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is gonna be tough...great list by the way!    Goldfinger - No surprises here. This one just feels like the quintessential Bond film in pretty much every aspect. Dr. No - This is an old movie that doesn't try too hard, making it feel as fresh as ever in 2015. Really set the tone for the series. From Russia With Love - Pretty much the same reasoning as the last two. Great middle movie in Connery's best 3 flicks. On Her Majesty's Secret Service - I liked the book more, but this movie did a great job giving Bond an emotional, gritty look. It contrasts Connery's movies well, though it didn't age quite as well. Goldeneye - It did a great job depicting a modern Bond. Over-the-top and entertaining non-stop. Casino Royale - Very entertaining and powerful. Craig's best by far.  The Spy Who Loved Me - Moore's ""Goldfinger."" One of those movies that just feels right from start to finish. Thunderball - It's a bit dull at times, but I really enjoyed this one. Connery killed it as always. You Only Live Twice - By far the most over-the-top of Connery's movies, but it works. Probably my favorite Blofeld. The Living Daylights - I really enjoy Dalton's two movies, and this is my favorite of the two. Felt like a throwback to Lazenby. Tomorrow Never Dies - What I consider the most underrated Bond movie. Great villain and great Bond girl. Not quite as entertaining from start to finish as Goldeneye though. For Your Eyes Only - It's not the most exciting movie, but it does a good job keeping the Moore ridiculousness under control. I really hate the opening scene though. Skyfall - Putting Skyfall this low isn't going to make me any friends. It's a movie that looks fantastic and features some spot-on performances, but the plot is nonsensical and the film drags on too long. I couldn't figure out the tone, which was somewhere between gritty and ridiculous. Not a bad movie by any means though. License to Kill - Great movie until the ending. Ignoring the last thirty minutes, it was a great Lazenby-esque adventure. Then he starts hanging from airplanes...it lacked a good central villain as well. Diamonds Are Forever - Pretty stupid in a lot of parts, but it's got plenty of good Connery fun and doesn't take itself seriously at all. Die Another Day - IMHO, Brosnan's best performance. Great sword fight, pretty good Bond girls. Some very lackluster parts in this one though. You'd think CGI was better in 2002. The Man With The Golden Gun - Christopher Lee was excellent as the villain, and overall it's a pretty watchable film. And then there's the slide whistle, the most annoying character in the world, etc. Moonraker - I liked this one quite a lot more than everyone else seemed to. It's the most over-the-top of any Bond movie, but it's fun and implausibly entertaining. This is the last movie on my list that I enjoy watching. Live and Let Die - I feel the same about this movie as I do Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. There's a lot of really strange stuff going on here, with one of the oddest villains.  Quantum of Solace - A very forgettable film. It's not a bad movie, it just leaves pretty much no lasting impression. The World Is Not Enough - There are some good elements here (the female villain is excellent) but overall it's pretty much a mess and definitely Brosnan's weakest.  Octopussy - MI6 clowns and Tarzan yells. It's a tough watch. I found myself saying ""Why?"" throughout the whole movie. A View to a Kill - The only Bond movie that I legitimately hate. I can't watch it from start to finish. The performances are bad, the plot is terrible, Beach Boys music...there's really nothing I like about this movie.   Bonus: Never Say Never Again - Not a bad movie by any means, but Connery is a little too old for me to really get into it. It just felt like an unnecessary venture."
JamesBond,324w77,WithShoes,3,Fri Apr 10 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"Casino Royale – Craig Skyfall – Craig From Russia with Love – Connery On Her Majesty’s Secret Service – Lazenby The Spy Who Loved Me – Moore Goldfinger – Connery Goldeneye – Brosnan The Living Daylights – Dalton Dr. No – Connery Never Say Never Again – Connery Quantum of Solace – Craig The World is Not Enough – Brosnan Moonraker – Moore Thunderball – Connery Tomorrow Never Dies – Brosnan For Your Eyes Only – Moore Octopussy – Moore A View to a Kill – Moore The Man with the Golden Gun – Moore You Only Live Twice – Connery License to Kill – Dalton NOTE: These bottom three are the only ones I didn’t actually enjoy watching Die Another Day – Brosnan Live and Let Die – Moore Diamonds are Forever – Connery   Dr. No (Connery, 1962) – James Bond’s first film. Pretty enjoyable, but the series definitely needed to work some things out before it could become truly great. If Bond was the Zelda series, this would be “The Legend of Zelda.”  From Russia with Love (Connery, 1963) – The best of the pre-Craig Bond films. Nothing outrageous or over the top. Just an excellent spy thriller set in the Cold War with an awesome sequence on a train and an awesome villain. The “A Link to the Past” of Bonds.  Goldfinger (Connery, 1964) – Generally regarded as the best Bond film, but for me it falters in the third act. Pussy Galore and the odd Kentucky sequence with American gangsters drop what could have been the best one below From Russia with Love for me. The “Ocarina of Time” of Bonds.  Thunderball (Connery, 1965) – It went for the same slightly campy action as Goldfinger, but just didn’t do quite as good a job. The underwater fights were fun, though.  You Only Live Twice (Connery, 1967) – James Bond goes to Asia and gets eye prosthetics to blend in. The series was starting to get a little too campy at this point. This is the film that Austin Powers lampoons.  On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (Lazenby, 1969) – George Lazenby’s sole outing is one of the series’ best. The only Bond film where you truly care about the side characters (and Bond himself) until Daniel Craig took over the mantle. The best Bond girl, the best villain, and the best winter sports chases.  Diamonds are Forever (Connery, 1971) – It has been described as Sean Connery starring in a Roger Moore Bond flick, but that gives it too much credit. Ridiculous, homophobic, and none of that is even in a funny way. Just boring.  Live and Let Die (Moore, 1973) – Roger Moore’s first is his worst. The bizarre Blaxploitation one takes Bond to Harlem, New Orleans, and Jamaica to do battle with stereotypes. Saved by the wonderful Sheriff G.W. Pepper.  The Man with the Golden Gun (Moore, 1974) – Not bad. More Bond-like and spy-seeming than Live and Let Die, with Christopher Lee as a better than average Bond villain. (Fun fact: I watched this, Star Wars: Episode II, and a Lord of the Rings marathon all in the same day by coincidence.) Has a midget as the literal mini-boss, but you have to accept such things in the Roger Moore era.  The Spy Who Loved Me (Moore, 1977) – One of the best in the series. Moore was at his best, the dynamic with the Russian spy girl made Bond Girls seem not useless for once, and Jaws was a wonderful mini-boss.  Moonraker (Moore, 1979) – Ridiculously campy and horrible, but it has grown on me with time. Once you accept that it’s more of a comedy than a drama, then you can enjoy it for what it is.  For Your Eyes Only (Moore, 1981) – It definitely seems like a new decade in this movie. The series grows up quite a bit from Moonraker, and it seems like a Timothy Dalton-style Bond but starring Roger Moore and his humor. Not great, but definitely decent.  Octopussy (Moore, 1983) – Bond goes to India. Like For Your Eyes Only before it, a pretty decent movie. Nothing great, but the kind of thing you’d buy a ticket to in 1983 and leave happy.  Never Say Never Again (Connery, 1983) – Old man Connery does a Bond film outside the main series. His age (53), was played up, but Moore was actually 55 that same year in Octopussy. Connery shows that he’s the best at action, and the aging Bond vs. English bureaucrat plot makes for a film that feels more real than any until Craig. I like it better than Thunderball, which it is a remake of.  A View to a Kill (Moore, 1985) – Christopher Walken as a Bond villain is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I have ever seen. A simple yet enjoyable movie, and Moore’s age (57) actually doesn’t show. Great Duran Duran song, too.  The Living Daylights (Dalton, 1987) – Dalton brings a gritty realism to the role, which both of the next two guys did after him a bit more successfully. But this was still a great change of pace from the Moore Era, and Dalton really shows why a thirty-something Bond is ideal.  License to Kill (Dalton, 1989) – It has been described as an episode of Miami Vice starring James Bond, and that rings true for me. It doesn’t fit in well with the rest of the series.  GoldenEye (Brosnan, 1995) – GoldenEye successfully updated the series for a post-Cold War world. The best of Brosnan, and one of the better films in the series. Plus Sean Bean, Robbie Coltrane, and Alan Cumming all deliver great supporting performances  Tomorrow Never Dies (Brosnan, 1997) – Thus is a good action film with some sense of humor but no camp. This feels like what you’d expect 90s Bond to look like if you’d stopped watching after Thunderball and came back thirty years later.  The World is Not Enough (Brosnan, 1999) – An exciting action film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but Denise Richards was a horrible actress.  Die Another Day (Brosnan, 2002) – The plot is pretty ridiculous and far-fetched. Tidal wave surfing, invisible cars, and ice lairs make this up there with Moonraker for the silliest Bonds. I wonder why the tone shifted so severely from the previous three Brosnan outings. This took the original Bond series out with a campy bang, and it would fall to Craig to show what Bond movies should be.  Casino Royale (Craig, 2006) – This is one of the best movies of all time. Next.  Quantum of Solace (Craig, 2009) – A cross between Casino Royale and Bourne that misses what makes both of them special. Still, it’s the traditional Bond with a villain in a lair in an exotic country with Bond as an action hero who needs to stop him, but updated and personalized. Not bad.  Skyfall (Craig, 2012) – This is not the best James Bond movie. But it is the best movie that stars James Bond. And incredible piece of cinema, and the series may never reach this high again."
JamesBond,324w77,WithShoes,2,Fri Apr 10 23:31:11 2015 UTC,your zelda comparison is spot on.  DN is the originator.  FRWL is the perfection.  GF is the one that becomes the standard for the series.
JamesBond,324w77,WithShoes,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I wrote this up when I did my full watch-through of a series two years ago, and I've been waiting until right before the next movie comes out to show it to anyone.  Looking back at it now, I'd extend the Zelda comparison to Thunderball and Majora's Mask. Although this won't be a universally held opinion, I dislike watching Thunderball, and I dislike playing Majora. They both tried to replicate the OoT/GF formula, and I think they both totally failed. The 3 day thing stresses me out hardcore.  I'd then put OHMSS as the Windwaker. Wildly different from the previous ones, but arguably the best in the series because of it. Arguably.  Then Twilight Princess is like Goldeneye. Brings us back to what we love about the series. Not quite Goldfinger/OoT, but close. Then for me personally, Skyward Sword was Die Another Day. Just the worst.  I'm hopeful that the new open world Zelda game will be the Casino Royale of the series, but Nintendo hasn't satisfied me in a while.  Edit: Roger Moore and Dalton can be the handheld Zeldas. Not console quality by any means, but pretty fun nonetheless."
JamesBond,324w77,icantfindbatteries,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Moore is like the Wind Waker.  People were saying its not realistic enough but eventually they warmed up to it.  Dalton was the Twilight Princess, all dark.  And then Brosnan is like Skyward Sword, doing an in between."

JamesBond,324w77,Smileyjoe72,3,Fri Apr 10 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"yeah.  i dont think it will ever be a classic but right now, its under a certain stigma because the prevailing trend right now is more serious grounded movies like casino royale 06, which by the way is fantastic.  but in time, i think bond fans will warm up to DAD too."
JamesBond,324w77,jamedudijench,0,Fri Apr 10 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"Today's grimdark theme so prevalent in cinema is really pretentious; it always looks down at 'fun' and fantasy movies such as DAD. Once this fad is over, I think DAD will be better loved."
JamesBond,324w77,akanefive,0,Sat Apr 11 02:02:08 2015 UTC,I think future films will embrace CGI for colorful abstract kinda-psychadelic experiences with political and sci-fi implications.  And DAD was peering into that.

Not judging or criticizing, I just think that's a pretty rare viewpoint."
JamesBond,324w77,MrRobertGoulet,5,Fri Apr 10 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"The Bond series is criticized for being formulaic but then when it does stray from the formula a bit, it's seen as ""not Bond enough"".  I can understand how some people don't like LTK a ton, but that's okay.  Let that be my underrated gem.  Hahah.  LTK had so many great moments like the truck chase and Q had his biggest role ever, going rogue.  Sanchez was a terrifying and believable villain with some quirk, like the iguana.  LTK also had the wonderful Pam Bouvier, beautiful inside and out, strapped with a shotgun & kevlar.  A perfect match for Dalton's hardcore Bond."

JamesBond,324w77,JohnnyReeko,3,Fri Apr 10 22:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I tried to do, appreciate all the actors.  It'd be impossible for me to rank them because I enjoy all their performances.  Moore is probably my favorite actor (he fit in the role so naturally), but I wouldn't say he had the best movies.  To the same extent, it's kinda sad how Brosnan wanted to do a more serious dark Bond but Eon would write weak scripts."
JamesBond,324w77,scozzie,4,Fri Apr 10 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I know ""everyone"" loves Skyfall, but I don't. Why? Because James Bond doesn't save anybody. He doesn't save his fellow agent. He doesn't save the agency from being blown up. He doesn't save the assasin's target. He doesn't save the girl. He doesn't even save M at the end.  What's Bond good for, if he can't save anybody?"
JamesBond,324w77,Dhd314,5,Fri Apr 10 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great movie, but if you look at it the villain completely succeeds in every part of his plan. I kind of like that because it helps define who Bond will become and I like that Bond doesn't always win."
JamesBond,324w77,Badmecha007,6,Fri Apr 10 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"No no, that's the best part of SkyFall. In every other Bond film, 007 is hunting down the villain.  In SkyFall, the villain is hunting him."

Take The World Is Not Enough for example: I can't stand that movie, and yet I can still watch it from start to finish because of Brosnan. He got three bad scripts in a row and pretty much no help from any other actors (except the girl in Tomorrow Never Dies, she did a great job.) Now imagine Pierce in Casino Royale. He could pull that off and then some; the guy is phenomenal. I'd love to see him in a Wes Anderson movie."
JamesBond,321xh6,Darkimus-prime,5,Thu Apr 9 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"As someone nearly finished with LALD (novel), dare I say... LTK is actually a better and more accurate LALD than LALD.   Moonraker is commonly known to be different, to say the least, from the novel."
JamesBond,321xh6,jamedudijench,2,Fri Apr 10 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, LTK is the most Fleming of many of the movies and it wasn't even based off any particular book. Few scenes notwithstanding."

JamesBond,321xh6,mrgrandgrind,5,Fri Apr 24 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service is pretty close, for the better I think. There is a bit of trouble with the order of the movies being different than the book order, but it's still very faithful. And worst - The Spy Who Loved Me. Even Ian Fleming didn't want the plot of the book on film."
JamesBond,321xh6,shinkapinka,3,Thu Apr 9 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"The Living Daylights story was essentially completely reenacted in the film (obviously didn't go for 3 days like the story, but the premise was identical).    On the opposite token, Octopussy is nothing at all like its literary source."

JamesBond,321xh6,shane0mack,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:28:13 2015 UTC,I would say those are the most different in terms of the full length novels adapted to movies. Obviously the short stories were mostly used by title only.
JamesBond,321xh6,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Fri Apr 10 12:38:44 2015 UTC,"Except for Living Daylights. Pretty much word for word with the opening, post credits scene."

JamesBond,321xh6,BigFraz61,2,Fri Apr 10 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"Here an in-depth explanation on the faithfulness of the books.  Nearly Identical   On Her Majesty's Secret Service   Very Faithful - Faithful the majority of the time   Dr. No From Russia With Love Goldfinger Thunderball For Your Eyes Only Casino Royale 2006 (the first 40 minutes was original content.  that aside, almost entirely faithful.)   Somewhat Faithful - a mix of Fleming's source material and creative interpretation   Live and Let Die (lots of novel elements but with lots of humor/camp) Octopussy (the faberge egg parts were faithful) The Living Daylights (The first half of the film was faithful)   Slightly Faithful - contains some bits of Fleming but are largely unfaithful   License to Kill (Dalton's Bond in this one is a lot like Fleming's) Die Another Day (Contains elements of the Moonraker novel) A View to a Kill Moonraker Diamonds Are Forever Man with the Golden Gun   Original Stories - written by Eon and not Fleming   The Spy Who Loved Me (Fleming was embarrassed with his TSWLM story and asked Eon not to use it) Goldeneye Tomorrow Never Dies The World Is Not Enough Quantum of Solace  Skyfall"
JamesBond,321xh6,GenTsoChickenX,2,Fri Apr 10 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about a couple rankings:  *You state The Living Daylights is only ""Somewhat Faithful"" because only the first half of the film is faithful, yet state Casino Royale is ""Very Faithful"" despite the first 40 minutes being original content.  On this token, wouldn't TLD be worthy of being considered ""Very Faithful""? Apart from the length of the extraction of General Koskov being significantly shorter, the entire short story was essentially covered in the film's first 10 minutes.  *Is it entirely accurate to consider Octopussy as ""Somewhat Faithful"" even though its plot was almost entirely pulled from ""The Property of a Lady""?  If it's only based on elements pulled from the Flemming stories and not just how close they are to their title source, I would want to bump Licence to Kill up to ""Somewhat Faithful"" as its first half was very similar to Live and Let Die and borrowed aspects from The Hildebrand Rarity."
JamesBond,321xh6,dantheman757,3,Fri Apr 10 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.  With TLD, the sniper story is only superficially related to the Soviet-Afghan war story.  With Casino Royale, it's almost entirely faithful with the exception that Le Chiffre is a terrorist financier rather than a brothel owner.  On the other counts, I agree."

JamesBond,31yada,jjness,8,Thu Apr 9 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"THAT scene to me is when he is shot off the train, falls 100 feet into a river, and wakes up drinking beer on an island."

JamesBond,31yada,dash101,16,Thu Apr 9 03:01:07 2015 UTC,"Well...when you said THAT scene from Skyfall, I thought perhaps you meant that wonderful fight in the skyscraper.  As far as Bond's response to Silva, I saw Skyfall on opening weekend in Los Angeles and there were more than a few chuckles.  I thought it was a classic Bond line that accomplished two goals - Goal One: it shows men around the world that the 21st century 007 isn't homophobic and if you're going to be ""like James Bond"" and you've got a problem with gay people - get over it. Goal Two: fitting right into step with this entire reboot, we're witnessing 007 in a classic verbal sparring match with his adversary and he's refusing to crack under pressure or be one-upped...Bond is in total control of the situation and is so cool, he's playing with this guy while being held prisoner. Joking with your captor? That's some cold James Bond shit!"
JamesBond,31yada,seventhward,3,Thu Apr 9 05:14:49 2015 UTC,"I was worried Silva did more harm for LGBT communities. But at the end of the day, he is super twisted, and one of my new favourite bond villains.  Plus gay characters are allowed to be villains too. Even if we are afraid of potentially demonizing the LGBT community.  Also ya, cold ass James Bond shit is right @seventhward  Also also, I thought the comeback also in some ways speaks to the current iteration of Bond. Craig's Bond is jaded and reckless because he is broken emotionally inside his heavily fortified exterior. He gives no fucks. Gay, bi, bi-curious, other or not, if he did fool around he likely did it for very reckless reasons."
JamesBond,31yada,jthrillzyou,3,Thu Apr 9 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Bond is alpha as fuck so he doesn't freak out when a man makes a pass at him (he isn't going: ""EWWW Don't touch me Homo!!"" like some sexually frustrated teenager).   The line ""Who says it's my first time?"" is also most likely a reference to Lechiffre's torture method"
JamesBond,31yada,WhiteBoythatCantJump,3,Sun Apr 12 14:02:56 2015 UTC,I was livid when the media came out and started saying that bond might be gay - just latching on to a tiny detail and trying to blow it out of proportion.
JamesBond,31yada,dudelikeshismusic,9,Thu Apr 9 13:02:24 2015 UTC,I thought it was completely unnecessary. But that's just me.
JamesBond,31yada,dragonsky,2,Thu Apr 9 02:41:19 2015 UTC,I honestly thought that Silva was messing with Bond. Sure it seemed homoerotic but it was all done in the sense of Silva is twisted villain who can do whatever he wants to a tied Bond and Bond not giving up and trying to out-wit Silva while being tied.
JamesBond,31yada,arafinwe,5,Thu Apr 9 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"I was watching it alone. I gasped, then giggled.

JamesBond,31yada,TheBitchIsDead,7,Thu Apr 9 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"And besides some coverage from LGBT-centric media outlets, the scene caused very little discussion from critics or fans.   Probably because homosexuality isn't a problem? It's not discussed because it's not an issue."
JamesBond,31yada,jjness,6,Thu Apr 9 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"Oh no, that's not what I was implying at all, I spend most of my time in a subreddit dedicated to a competition show for drag queens. I meant normally when mainstream films have homosexual content, there's usually a lot of fanfare that comes along with the release of the film.   I was just wondering why Skyfall managed to not only avoid the exploitation of a scene not usually found in a mainstream action movie, but the backlash from right wing nuts, and I'm trying to gauge the reaction of a mostly heterosexual audience."
JamesBond,31yada,BondGirl20,5,Thu Apr 9 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"It didn't make that much of an impression on me at all. Whether it was a serious flirtation or just a trivial power play by Silva, it was a quick distraction he allowed himself before getting down to brass tacks.   It wasn't a sex scene or anything."

JamesBond,31yada,wildcard6270,2,Thu Apr 9 04:59:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry but that's kind of a silly remark. The insinuation that Bond might have had homosexual experiences is certainly noteworthy, considering how stereotypically masculine and straight the character is. He's an iconic womanizer and no where in the source material is it mentioned that he may have had homosexual relations. It was either a totally misinterpreted line or else the filmmakers were not so subtly hinting your very point, that it isn't an issue. But the issue isn't that it's wrong of course, just that it's out of character. Sacrificing the integrity of characterization in order to prove a political point is in my opinion, very cheap, and counter productive. The idea that they thought the world might be ready for a gay bond is offensive in itself to homosexuals. They don't need Bond to be gay to legitimize their lifestyles. Its kind of pretentious."
JamesBond,31yada,akanefive,2,Thu Apr 9 10:33:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that they were implying that Bond was gay. At most, they were hinting that Bond was not afraid at all of being hit on by another man; that it didn't make him uncomfortable or afraid or angry. And if you were to take the most literal reading of the line, it would just merely imply that James Bond was bisexual instead of gay, or is willing to 'fake it' to gather information or leverage from an asset or mark."
JamesBond,31yada,Darkimus-prime,0,Thu Apr 9 12:38:52 2015 UTC,"I'm just using the term homosexual to refer to the situation in question, of course you're right it would make him technically bisexual.

That being said, I've got no problem with Idris playing Bond, I actually think he would do quite well in the role. I do agree he may be a bit too old for the role when Craig steps down. A political move? I don't know about that so much."
JamesBond,31w67k,YourFavBarPunk,2,Thu Apr 9 08:20:20 2015 UTC,"I just checked it up and Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and Adam West all declined because they said Bond should be played by a British actor.   I also have no problem with Idris Elba playing Bond, I think he would be great, he is an amazing actor. At the same time there would definitely be a part of decision making process that would come down to being politically correct. It seems to be becoming a thing where people change the race of a character to a minority as some kind of arbitrary gesture these days.  This isn't even the first iconic British role that Elba has been rumoured to take over - After Matt Smith stepped down as Doctor Who there was a TV special that announced the new Doctor and the favourites were Peter Capaldi, Olivia Coleman (great actress but thank god it wasn't her) and Idris Elba.   Like I said in my other comment I doubt he'll get a chance anyway. Daniel Craig is extremely popular in the role and is contracted for one more film after Spectre so at the very earliest the next Bond will be announced in late 2018 / early 2019 at which time Idris Elba will be around 46 years old. I don't think anyone wants a repeat of 58 year old Roger Moore still playing the role and that would probably only give Elba two films as Bond (assuming a three year turn around for each film being the new norm). It's clear the producers want an actor to be in the role as long as possible (Lazenby was offered a 7 film contract iirc and Dalton was offered a third outing) so that will likely be in the back of their mind when deciding."
JamesBond,31w67k,JohnnyReeko,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:42:17 2015 UTC,"Adam West was the one I was thinking of, and it's pretty cool to know that he wasn't the only one who felt that way.  Also, I had completely forgotten about how changing the race/gender of an established character is kinda chic/cool nowadays. And no, I don't really understand all the hate that it gets either. Everyone shit a brick over the idea of a female Ghostbusters squad. Why is that a big deal? It's not really breaking the universe per se (at least from what I know). An American playing as Bond, however? I don't know, but you'd have to be a hell of writer to explain why the British secret intelligence has an American agent and NOT piss off every fan of the series."
JamesBond,31w67k,YourFavBarPunk,2,Thu Apr 9 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"At this stage I don't think an American would even be considered for the role. It's hard to think now that he's so popular in the role that Daniel Craig was a really controversial pick - there were newspaper articles with the headlines ""His names Bland, James Bland"" and people critiscising the choice and threatening to boycott the film before Casino Royale even came out. Imagine the controversy for a non brit to play the role. It just won't happen.  As for the female Ghostbusters team and stuff like that I think the hate comes from the thought that it's done just for the sake of it rather than for a good reason. That goes for all similar casting rumours like a Black Bond."
JamesBond,31w67k,JohnnyReeko,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:39:02 2015 UTC,"In Elba's case, I don't think they're worried about their production company going tits up all of a sudden. That's what doomed Dalton's third."

This whole ""We Must Have A Black Bond"" thing is knee-jerk political correctness and anyone who dares disagree is a ""Hater"". I feel bad he got snubbed by the producers. That's pretty crappy. But even though that happened and it's a more than legitimate reason to hold a grudge, the guy showed a lot of integrity by speaking his mind even though he will offend a lot of people and probably get a ton of bad press for it."
JamesBond,31w67k,sigersen,8,Wed Apr 8 18:12:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with him. It doesn't make as much sense for a lot of character to change their race if they're already established. In the reboot, they established Felix Leiter as a black man, which they should also keep. I'd much prefer they make a new character than just change an existing one."
JamesBond,31w67k,Hyperman360,10,Wed Apr 8 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"This is the strongest argument for not casting a black man. The Craig films are working hard to establish one continuity, and I'd hate for that to be erased. That said, it ultimately doesn't matter who they cast, so long as he's British and badass."
JamesBond,31w67k,akanefive,6,Wed Apr 8 19:24:49 2015 UTC,"He said: “Black men should stop trying to play roles created by whites. These roles are not written for black men. We have pens [to create] roles that no one else has established.”  THANK YOU  Create a new character- don't bastardize the source material for affirmative action.  No white will ever play MLK, or Malcolm X, or to stay fictional: Shaft, Black Panther, Uhura, Blade....  But as soon as someone recoils from the idea, we're stamped ""racist"". It's simply not the voice or tone of the character.  Can a black character exist in the world? Absolutely and HAS. Make a 00 that happens to be of African decent, go nuts.  But we need to get back to Fleming(as they appear to be doing) not further away (Die Another Day much?)"
JamesBond,31w67k,ArtistApart,7,Thu Apr 9 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"JFK was a REAL PERSON, not a character in a book. It should not matter what race the man is who plays James Bond.

JamesBond,31w67k,FlapjackFreeman,15,Wed Apr 8 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"My only problem with Elba is he's almost definitely going to be too old to play Bond by the time Craig is done.

Even if, for example, Spectre was Craig's final film, and you assume a quick turnaround of 2 years before the next one is released, Elba would be the oldest first-time Bond since Roger Moore.    And since Craig is under contract for 1-3 more films (depending on what you're reading), it's hard to see EON casting someone closing in on 50 years old in a franchise that they'd expect the actor to stay in for several years.  Especially with how physical the character has become."
JamesBond,31w67k,PawsButton,7,Thu Apr 9 05:32:36 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be downvoted for this. It's an opinion just as valid as the others in the thread.  EDIT: My comment seems not to be relevant anymore. Good.
JamesBond,31w67k,akanefive,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents, The reboot of the franchise with Craig has a clear timeline between all of those films. The only thing kept from previous franchises was Judi as M, then she was replaced ON SCREEN. I bet we will see the hand off on screen and confirm that James Bond is at least a name that gets passed on. (Maybe code name, maybe not)  Casting a Black actor in this timeline would work, as the character of James Bond could be seen to be more defined by the type of person needed to be an Agent that gets 00 status. All the James Bonds were different, but echoed the essence of what it means to be ""James Bond"".   This is not something that isn't based on race.  Besides Eon Productions owns the character for film, they have the right to decide what it means to be James Bond.  At the end of the day, fictional characters have the ability to evolve with time. Historical people do not have that luxury."

JamesBond,31w67k,Wizzer10,-9,Wed Apr 8 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"Bond needs to embody British masculinity, I can imagine a point in time that a black guy could do that; right now that's not the case. In a couple of decades it will be acceptable to international audiences that a black dude went to Eton. I'm sure black dudes have already, but it would be surprising to many people if they encountered one; when it's not surprising Bond can be black."

JamesBond,31w67k,roastbeeftacohat,-6,Wed Apr 8 21:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think it would be great if we did have a black James Bond. I would love the movies to support the theory that ""James Bond"" is just a codename and that each different actor was a different James Bond."

JamesBond,31w9dg,mrgrandgrind,5,Wed Apr 8 17:35:35 2015 UTC,"Of course, I forgot Nightfire. The plot was a straight up rip-off of the fantastically written Moonraker, but I played that multiplayer for years with my friends and brother.  We had to ban Oddjob and Nick Nack for unfair advantages (hat and stature) and our favourite map was the mountain one with a building on each side and a cable car doing a loop. I liked Atlantis and Fort Knox too."
JamesBond,31w9dg,jamedudijench,5,Wed Apr 8 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"Everything or Nothing is the one with the building repel opening right? I used to rent that one from time to time. Yeah, rent, I know, I'm a fossil right? That one is good, I think it gets a fair bit of love. Not too much, maybe even not enough. There's a Youtuber by the name of Metal Jesus who really loves it and it's a pretty solid review.   I liked the FRWL game when it came out. I remember reading about it and being excited for it in, I believe, Game Informer magazine. With Connery returning and voicing Bond I thought that was freaking sweet. But unfortunately I had it on the PSP. Some things were noticeably cut but not a bad title for my money. I liked that they added an actual Bond cold open mission with the Thunderball jetpack. It made me really love FRWL and to this day is still on the very top of my favorite Bond movies. I teeter, sue me. But the gadgets were cool, I liked the Q Copters, they were a nice little nod to the spiders in EON. Eh, I liked the game."
JamesBond,31w9dg,jamedudijench,3,Wed Apr 8 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"FRWL was good. Compared with other contemporary action games it wasn't amazing but it was a decent and unexpected entry in the series. The return of Connery, technically his final performance as 007, was fantastic, although his complete disregard to even attempt an English accent was a little jarring and immersion-breaking."
JamesBond,31w9dg,akanefive,6,Wed Apr 8 17:59:50 2015 UTC,"Oh God, yeah, he went full Connery. I mean FULL. I always remember the cutscene at the train where he meets Red Grant and they use the famous ""I use a lighter."" dialogue and he's just like ""Oi yews uh loituh."" I love it. But you hit the nail on the head, decent and unexpected, sorta outdated and sub par for the time. But for a Bond fan, an enjoyable little romp."

From Russia With Love was really fun too.  Rogue Agent had some really great ideas but I'm not a huge fan of FPS (the original Goldeneye is about it for me).   Legends, TWINE, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Agent Under Fire were all pretty awful. Terrible controls, graphics, and wholly uninspired.  Blood Stone and Nightfire were both mediocre. Not terrible, but a decent way to kill a few hours. I haven't played QoS but from what I've read the consensus for it is the same."

Also a pistol has a finite amount of energy that it can impart on the bullet. Using a depleted uranium bullet means it is shooting heave and very hard metal, but the total energy in the bullet is limited by the propellant used. To turn his lungs inside out would have required something significantly more powerful than a pistol.  Now, when Moneypenny shot him with her rifle, that would have done far more damage than a pistol shooting a depleted uranium round."

But, I will say, the way I justify him falling and surviving at least is a lot of times you'll see drunk drivers survive accidents, especially when they involve flying through windshields or windscreens. This is because their bodies go limp from passing out or what have you. I'm not qualified to bore you with the details but essentially you decrease your chances of surviving trauma like that by tensing up. Ergo, the way I'm able to suspend my disbelief is that Bond was limp and somehow that's what saves him. But that's a long fucking fall so I dunno.   I think it depends on the half life. I could be wrong but I think it's just residual radiation that they're talking about. They're safe to handle externally but having one lodged in ya gettin all your internal parts all irradiated.

JamesBond,31qtqj,GetFreeCash,11,Tue Apr 7 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"I have always thought this.  Connery wasn't really much of an actor when he won the role.  Being a new face helped his cause due to producers wanting someone to do a multi-picture deal.  Connery's anonymity helped that cause.  Lazenby had no acting experience, and Roger Moore was never considered a great actor.  A case could potentially be made for Dalton.  He had won some acclaim as a stage actor.  Brosnan isn't a bad actor, but, similar to Moore, was never considered that great of an actor.  Craig was already an established actor when he took the role.  He has a lot of good acting credits to his name, and I'm sure he has many good roles left in him after Bond."

JamesBond,31qtqj,RF20Lennon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:59:56 2015 UTC,Or not like Daniel Craig who played the poet Ted Hughes in the film Silvia.  I can't think of a Sean Connery film where he played anyone other than himself?
JamesBond,31qtqj,Auntfanny,-5,Tue Apr 7 22:15:33 2015 UTC,Oscar vs no nomination.  Sean Connery may not be able to change his accent but the man gave a terrific performance in Untouchables.
JamesBond,31qtqj,RF20Lennon,2,Tue Apr 7 22:18:15 2015 UTC,We are not talking about performances.  Sean Connery is a movie star.  He's pretty much great in every film he's been in.  We are talking about acting ability and range...the ability to transform into another person
JamesBond,31qtqj,Auntfanny,3,Tue Apr 7 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"Oscars are overrated. There have been numerous performances and films that were passed over for Academy Awards and instead saw movies that had better press, social causes pushing it or actors rewarded more as a ""lifetime achievement"" rather than being the standout performance that year.  I think that Connery is an enjoyable actor to watch with some memorable roles, but if you're going to hold up The Untouchables as an example of how great he is, then you should also hang League of Extraordinary Gentlemen around Connery's neck too."

Craig is a very goood actor. So is Connery. But they are not playing the same character.  Bond is a brand name now. There was a hint of Fleming's Bond in CR, but that was the end of it."
JamesBond,31rdtq,adventcrash,5,Tue Apr 7 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about The Living Daylights. I loved the Death To Spies (Smert Spion sp?) element and I really like Dalton. I think he is the closest Bond to the novels. Like Brosnan, I feel he rose above the material. I need to watch both Dalton films again. I have not watched them for a while.  I feel you could swap out either Brosnan or Dalton in their movies and either one could carry the film.  Nice review !"
JamesBond,31rdtq,sigersen,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:39:41 2015 UTC,Thank you! Thanks for reading. Yeah I feel the same about swapping Dalton and Brosnan and either would work. I really love them both as Bond.

JamesBond,31rdtq,akanefive,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:31:28 2015 UTC,That was a great moment. The whole ending I thought was just a great and fun action piece.
JamesBond,31rdtq,tenredux,3,Wed Apr 8 02:38:54 2015 UTC,"It must feel nice to move on from Moore. The films really begin to feel more modern, for better or worse, starting with Dalton.  I'm a fan of The Living Daylights. It's a welcome change. The action and music are great, it's got 2/3 of a strong plot, and the acting is really strong. The events of the film actually seem to have an effect on Bond for the first time in about 6 films. (Not a knock against Moore, he just starred in very different movies.)"
JamesBond,31rdtq,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Wed Apr 8 13:28:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I never thought I would like Moore because I don't like the camp but I really enjoyed some of his films but I feel like if Dalton had a longer stint then people would speak more highly of Dalton over Moore.
JamesBond,31rdtq,YankeeBlues21,2,Thu Apr 9 17:46:35 2015 UTC,"I just watched this one for the first time myself two nights ago.  This review is spot on for me except for Craig being the best Bond, but that's personal taste. What surprised me somewhat is how Dalton delivers those short, humorous quips.  They aren't plentiful, but it seems more of a dry humor which I thought fit in with Dalton's portrayal perfectly."
JamesBond,31rdtq,glidingclyde,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:54:44 2015 UTC,Yeah he never feels forced. He felt so natural and I wasn't really expecting his performance to be as good as it was but he makes a great Bond.

JamesBond,31s2a9,akanefive,5,Tue Apr 7 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"Well Dame Dench is essentially playing Stella Rimington, so in Goldeneye it is a bit of a novelty to have a ""girl"" in charge. In Casino Royale she's not playing the same M, because by 2006 there had been two female heads of SIS anyway."

JamesBond,31s2a9,JakeK812,-2,Tue Apr 7 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not a reboot.  It's more like showing the early years of Bond.  But still, trying to find continuity in all if the Bond movies is impossible, and you should not try to look for continuity errors are there will be TONS of them.  There are some continuities in the Bond movies such as his parents dying when he was young, Moneypenny trying to get Bond  to fall in love with her, 007 not being a code name, Tracy's death and Bond being white lol"
JamesBond,31otdz,vinegarstroke13,4,Mon Apr 6 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"Spectre is connected to all three of Craig's prior films in some way. It directly follows a significant portion of the Casino Royale/QoS Quantum plot arc, and the final events of Skyfall impact the setup for Bond's mission in this film.  Spectre is also going to be closely related to On Her Majesty's Secret Service in plot and theme, so you should watch that as well. Also, if you haven't seen all of the Connery films, all of them (except Goldfinger) very well may be informative depending on how Waltz's character plays out..."
JamesBond,31otdz,yachamed,2,Tue Apr 7 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"The Craig movies are a separate universe from the others, so you really only need to watch his movies and Spectre should make sense to you. That being said, since the movie is called Spectre it's probably not a bad idea to get an idea of what Spectre actually is. To accomplish this, watch From Russia With Love, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and You Only Live Twice."
JamesBond,31otdz,dudelikeshismusic,2,Tue Apr 7 01:05:33 2015 UTC,I see no reason not to rewatch all of them. Except maybe Die Another Day.

JamesBond,31lj07,jamedudijench,2,Tue Apr 7 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing 'British' and 'English'. British would refer to anyone from England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland.   Brosnan and Lazenby are the only none British Bonds."
JamesBond,31lj07,Jrees,-1,Tue Apr 7 02:25:21 2015 UTC,I didn't necessarily confuse them. I know the distinction but colloquially it's just understood that one means Englishman by saying Brit. What I was getting at is each culture is so different it almost doesn't matter what the home country is as long a as the role is performed well.
JamesBond,31lj07,jamedudijench,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I'm glad he never got the part."

JamesBond,31lj07,jamedudijench,2,Mon Apr 6 18:27:07 2015 UTC,For me Jackman is too hammy for my Bond tastes. We've suffered enough with Moore.
JamesBond,31lj07,Banzai51,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"Hammy... yeah. I can see it. It'd probably fall under Brosnan type area where he'd do the hard nose action segments with full bore Jackman grimace nd then be the suave, cool, sappy, heartthrob which people seem to not like.

JamesBond,31lj07,jamedudijench,10,Mon Apr 6 18:56:38 2015 UTC,It always shocked me that they kept offering it to Americans. I wonder if it was at the studio's insistence.

JamesBond,31lj07,GetFreeCash,3,Mon Apr 6 17:03:16 2015 UTC,Props to Adam West though. The man is a legend and I appreciate him saying it should go to a British actor. Shows he has respect for the character and is probably a fellow fan of the franchise.
JamesBond,31ohng,Deaththinius,11,Mon Apr 6 22:23:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, the films have often made a point of showing that the various actors are playing the same character. In OHMSS, Bond (played by Lazenby) is shown looking at souvenirs of the first several Bond adventures, implying that he is portraying the same character that was played by Connery. At the beginning of FYEO, Bond (played by Moore) is shown visiting the grave of Teresa Bond, implying that he is the same character played by Lazenby in OHMSS. In LTK, Bond (played by Dalton) is said to have been married a long time ago, another indication that he is the same character played by Lazenby."
JamesBond,31ohng,Thaumarch,2,Mon Apr 6 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Just to add:  Daniel Craig's Bond is an actual new Bond, but not in the ""he's the next guy assigned 007 codenamed 'James Bond'"" sense.  Casino Royale was a full reboot so the Craig movies have no real story connection to previous movies."
JamesBond,31ohng,Ginkasa,3,Tue Apr 7 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"Just to also add: There are times in later bond movies that have sort of broken the fourth wall with this. In Die Another Day you can see Brosnan looking through all the old bond gadgets Saying things like ""does this still work?"" when touching the thunderball jetpack. And the exploding pen from Goldeneye is referenced in Skyfall. There's a ton more where that came from"
JamesBond,31ohng,mrgrandgrind,3,Tue Apr 7 01:08:25 2015 UTC,"Of course, Lazenby also makes the comment that ""this never happened to the other guy"" in OHMSS referring, of course, to Connery. Obviously still meant to be the same character."

JamesBond,31ohng,mrgrandgrind,5,Tue Apr 7 11:26:53 2015 UTC,"They reset the continuity when Craig took over. I still don't buy the Bond as a codename theory any more than I would buy a Bruce Wayne is a codename theory. They reset the Batman continuity all the time but people just understand that each continuity is a retelling of the same underlying story.   I suppose that because Bond is a spy and doesn't have such an established back story, the codename theory makes more sense. But if I don't need a similar theory with comic book characters, I don't need one for Bond either."
JamesBond,31ohng,deathtospies,4,Tue Apr 7 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"This is a long debated question. Generally, the movies support the theory that each actor plays the same character. There are a lot of references to old events that just seem implausible for different people (For Your Eyes Only and The World Is Not Enough come to mind.) Craig's is a bit strange because it's a reboot with the same M. It's not something that is openly true either way, but I think it makes more sense to think of the actors all playing the same character with no real established timeline.   Also, read the books. I just finished On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and it gave me a really good grip on the character of James Bond that the movies never really provided."
JamesBond,31ohng,dudelikeshismusic,2,Tue Apr 7 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"Another example: In The Spy Who Loved Me (Roger Moore) Agent Triple X described Bond's marriage and dead wife (from In Her Majesty's Secret Service), and he is very sensitive about it.

My older brother got the DVD collection when I was about 10, and I've made my way through them. People always say that the actor who played Bond when you were a teenager was ""James Bond"" to you for the rest of your life, and to me that's Craig.  I think his line of films are some of the best (yeah, I even love Quantum of Solace). I love how they are building a universe around these characters, it makes it seem more real to me.  That being said, this is great if Daniel Craig stays James Bond forever. I think the direction these personal films are going in might cause some discomfort for when the next actor takes over the role. The very personal character backstory that we've seen built around Craig will now have to apply to the next one. I don't know, we'll see how it pans out in a couple of years."
JamesBond,31kisg,GrizzledAncient,4,Mon Apr 6 01:58:12 2015 UTC,"You sound like you might be around my age (early twenties), my teenage years also coincided with the beginning of the Craig era! Welcome to /r/JamesBond, pick a flair from the sidebar and enjoy your stay. :)  I'm sure people were wary of where the series would go after Connery stepped down from the role. I personally am not concerned about the longevity of James Bond post-Craig. This series has proven that while it is heavily centred on the actor who plays 007, it transcends and is not limited to said actor (see: Never Say Never Again). 007 will thrive and audiences will flock to see the movies regardless of whether or not the person playing him is a proven hit or not."
JamesBond,31kisg,GetFreeCash,4,Mon Apr 6 02:09:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've been a lurker for a while so this is my first time posting. And you're right, 21.   I might catch some flak for this, but people keep going on about Idris Elba and I hate the thought. I love him, think he's an amazing actor, but when there's a physical description of Bond in the books (and they sort of deviated with Moore and Craig), I don't think you can go too far from it, you know? Especially if they want to be mindful of continuity's sake.   Of course Bond will thrive, its such an attractive series. I'm just saying that as someone who has built the identity of Bond (back-stories, Vesper, personality, quips) around Craig, it'll be extremely hard for me to see another person in that role. No matter how good they are for it."
JamesBond,31kisg,GrizzledAncient,3,Mon Apr 6 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's reflective of Fleming's novels.  There's glimpses of it and the conflict Bond endures throughout Fleming's series in OHMSS and Dalton's performance's.  Dalton get's it, ""Bond isn't a superman, you can't relate to a superman"".     Bond (the character) is a flawed human being, with doubts, skepticism and real feelings.  He isn't a machine or flawless being, rather he gets out of shape, has hangovers and suffers from immense boredom at times.  The shot of Bond in the bar after a night of buying rounds in Skyfall is a situation that Fleming's character could easily be placed in.  A lot of the time he doesn't actually like his job.     M is a very important part of Fleming's novels, while the character pops up in and out of the story and isn't a main focus apart from Moonraker (until Aims' Colonel Sun) M is really the driving force being Bond, who's approval, acceptance Bond strives for.  I'm all for it, I don't really want to go back to him shooting dozens of bad guys with a machine gun and popping off some quip, that's not the guy Fleming wrote about.  Bond isn't funny, he's a serious character who in some instances has to kill people as part of his job.  A lot of the time he doesn't enjoy it, but rather is somewhat disgusted by it.  One of Fleming's best stories I think is actually The Spy Who Loved Me, along with his short stories these give a great insight into Bond the person and his character more so in some cases than the full length novels as he isn't always on assignment.   I don't agree that Bernard Lee was replaced with little or no fanfare, or Desmond.  Rather their characters were used differently, if there was no acknowledgement they wouldn't have had a portrait of Bernard up in the Scotland scenes of TWINE."
JamesBond,31kisg,1q2w3e4rqwe,3,Mon Apr 6 07:38:57 2015 UTC,"I was born the same year the first Bond movie came out! Literally the first book I checked out of the library when I was old enough for a card was a James Bond novel. I grew up with Roger Moore and really have a love for each of the Bond actors in their own way. That said, I waited for years for the Bond franchise to grow into 'real' movies that could leave behind the comic book villains trying to take over the world from some multimillion dollar secret base that always got blown up at the end of the movie, and for James Bond to stop being saddled with goofy Southern sheriffs who were just inserted for comic relief. It was the 70's, and we all loved it at the time, but it was also kind of like watching them make Dark Shadows into a comedy when you grew up with it as a horror show. I loved Timothy Dalton because he and his films represented a more serious Bond, but he came and went and it wasn't until Casino Royale and Daniel Craig that I finally got the Bond I'd always hoped for. I walked out of that movie and Daniel Craig was my favorite Bond. I love how they show more sides of him, and I think (and hope) it speaks to the fact that these are more fully realized movies and not just action/comedy templates. I especially like the way Craig shows us how Bond is feeling through his eyes. Lots of times you see him thinking something like ""I know doing this is going to destroy part of my soul, but I'll deal with that later. There's a job to be done."""
JamesBond,31kisg,DeeBased,2,Mon Apr 6 07:40:57 2015 UTC,"I am a lifelong fan of the films, I was a baby when my dad took me to see Diamonds Are Forever at the cinema and I swear my first memory of life is of Sean Connery dangling outside the Whyte House.  However, I am a huge fan of Fleming's books. I read them countless times growing up, along with the various adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and I always wanted to see that Bond, the Bond of the novels, up there on the big screen.  When Timothy Dalton came along I was ecstatic, this was the Bond I'd been waiting for. Unfortunately his films were not particularly well made, a better director could have done so much more with them, but I still enjoy them. For me, Dalton is the unsung hero of the franchise.  Daniel Craig has picked up the Dalton gauntlet and run with it. His run of films are the best in the series, and yes I include QoS in that comment. The complexity of novel Bond is more evident than ever, and I love that 20-odd films into the franchise the producers have the courage to delve deeper into the character than ever before.  The great strength of the Bond films is their ability to evolve and adapt, both with the times and with the change of actor. I have no doubt that the quips will one day be back, and I'm sure that some day 007 will be going back into space a la Moonraker. Fashions change and so do the Bonds. I love that about them. They are the best films around because I never come out of a Bond film feeling like I've wasted my time. You always get your money's worth with Bond, even the worst of them (Die Another Day, I'm looking at you)."
JamesBond,31kisg,I_Will_Be_Blunt_,2,Mon Apr 6 11:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think the series is in better shape now than it's ever been. The fact that an Oscar winner is directing the films, the last two villains have been played by Oscar winners, and the cinematography is being done by an Oscar winner (last time) and someone who may very well win one for Spectre says a lot about what people who don't need the money think about these films. There's a prestige to the series that, despite it being long running, didn't really exist until Casino Royale. As Doug Benson pointed out in the last James Bonding, Spectre will, at least after we first walk out of the theatre, feel like the best one they've ever done. And that's just by virtue of who they have working on it.  The retrospective, continuity heavy trend we're seeing is reflective of entertainment everywhere. The Bond films of the 60's and 70's were episodic, just like television series. Audiences didn't care if the events in one episode of Bonanza had an impact on it's characters long term. That's not how television shows worked in that generation. The same was true of the Bond films. Audiences we're bothered by the fact that they never heard what happened to the characters outside the films.  Today, we get shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men, which are so focused on continuity. They're unafraid to change the status quo of the characters, to the benefit of the show. We're seeing that in film series across the board, from Bond to Batman to Marvel. Filmmakers a generation ago wouldn't have had the balls to dismantle SHIELD like they did in Captain America 2. We're seeing the same thing in the Bond films. These have always been a somewhat reactionary, but this time around, they're choosing the right thing to copy: big huge action spectacles that don't treat audiences like children."
JamesBond,31kisg,akanefive,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said, but, believe it or not, somehow Deakins never actually won despite being nominated many times including for his Skyfall efforts."
JamesBond,31kisg,broadfuckingcity,2,Mon Apr 6 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"I think the franchise is certainly thriving right now , but I don't like the constant overlapping storylines. I'm tired of ""navel gazing"" Bond. I don't want Moonraker , but EON has had its Bourne knock off Trilogy, let's bring back the gun barrel and make a real James Bond film that is heroic and upbeat and makes you want ot buy another bag of popcorn, instead of a cyanide capsule."
JamesBond,31kisg,sigersen,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:23:45 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Where is the smirk? The quips? Bond was a character literally too cool to be emotional and be normal. He was the guy we all wanted to be but never could. We have this obsession in today's day in age of reducing heroes to our level while instead we should be trying to be more like them.

A frog would not need these.   Also, how would you explain the poison scene in Casino Royale? Mostly tho, Kermit is way too old to be Bond. What is he? Like over 60? This also lends credence to the James Bond is a code name fan theory.   Is is actually bias to make this suggestion, as you are effectually saying that Bond cannot be human.

It's definitely one of the best and the underwater sequences were great. You do realize the film is from 1965, right?   Today's Bond films are sorely missing good underwater sequences."
JamesBond,31f58z,Kruse,2,Mon Apr 6 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. It seems wrong to keep COMMANDER BOND away from water. I love the underwater sequences of the 60s and 70s.   Yes, Thunderball's underwater climax scene did drag on due to poor editing, but I think that was the result of the produces trying to milk every last penny out of the millions of dollars they invested in that original sequence."

JamesBond,31f58z,GetFreeCash,-1,Sat Apr 4 17:38:21 2015 UTC,I agree. The underwater and sped up hand to hand combat scenes really drag Thunderball down.
JamesBond,31f58z,BladeRunnerOO8,-5,Sat Apr 4 23:45:35 2015 UTC,Having Thunderball on a top 10 pretty much nullifies the writer's opinion in my book. Thunderball laid the template for all the worst Bonds.

Voodoo, human sacrifice, a henchman with a claw hand!  I find it endlessly quotable. I think Moore's freshman performance is  devilishly entertaining. Jane Seymour is a great Bond girl. Yaphet Kotto is a great, threatening villain. His death is hilarious.   It's a mixture of camp affection and genuine appreciation.   And one of the best themes, natch."

JamesBond,31et5q,kutwijf,10,Mon Apr 6 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who doesn't want to see Bond marrying and losing his wife? I feel we already got that (in a way) with Vesper in this reboot, it would have to be played out really well not to feel repetitive. Maybe I'd prefer something like I really love you but I have to let you go (I'm thinking of El Secreto de Sus Ojos train scene, if anyone's watched that)."
JamesBond,31et5q,GetFreeCash,4,Sat Apr 4 20:35:09 2015 UTC,I don't either. What op talks about reminds me of Casino Royale with Vesper. I say they either kill him off and give him a heroic death or allow him to find love again and make it a happy ending.
JamesBond,31et5q,megatom0,3,Sat Apr 4 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one. I feel that as we've already seen Bond lose two women that were very important to him, seeing him lose Tracy (or whatever name they choose to call The Love Of Bond's Life in this rebooted timeline) may not be as resonant as the book and the 1969 film of OHMSS depict it to be. And that would just be a shame."
JamesBond,31et5q,GetFreeCash,3,Sat Apr 4 20:50:27 2015 UTC,I am with you here. CR did that plot very well already. I guess with Vesper there are some issues because she had a whole lot of threads left hanging with her double/triple agent business.
JamesBond,31et5q,CmdOptEsc,3,Sun Apr 5 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"It's funny because in the novel, there are no threads left hanging with Vesper. She was a traitor, pure and simple. Bond cared for her (and, to some extent, still does as evidenced by the beginning of the novel OHMSS); emphasis on cared, past tense. He no longer sees her as anything but a bitch after she dies and reveals what happened in her suicide note.  In the films, however, because of the subplot where it's revealed that Vesper only betrayed James because her own former boyfriend was part of a scheme manipulating her, it's not as easy for Bond to dismiss her as a traitor. Her actions are essentially vindicated after her death and everyone (M, Mathis, and eventually Bond) forgives her.  So as a result, any plotlines involving Bond falling in love after Casino Royale in this rebooted movie timeline are made more confusing because theoretically he already found the love of his life in Vesper Lynd. And because the movies have established that everything bad she did was because of somebody else, she can't be as easily dismissed as she was in the novels. Add to that the fact that we've seen Bond lose women he loves (either romantically or in a familial way) in two of his three films, post-reboot, and the introduction of Tracy di Vicenzo just wouldn't seem as resonant."

Maybe 25 could end with the death of Tracey a la the original OHMSS, giving us an entire film to develop their relationship, then 26 becomes a vehicle for the final showdown with Bond starting off at rock bottom and finding his only remaining love is the service and the destruction of their enemies."

JamesBond,31bhrl,suppow,6,Fri Apr 3 21:51:15 2015 UTC,why not tell us the whole story in the preview. Two things I wonder about after seeing this. 1. Why does everybody in fiction use silencers when they are proven to be pretty much useless in real life? 2. is there really a underground bunch of assassins for hire? or is that just pretend? every time I hear about someone trying to find a killer for hire they always end up hiring a FBI agent
JamesBond,31bhrl,1701ncc,8,Fri Apr 3 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"When a gun is fired, there are 3 ways sound is produced; muzzle blast (high-temperature, high-pressure gases escaping after bullet), sonic boom (sound associated with shock waves created by the bullet exceeding the speed of sound) and mechanical noise (moving parts of the gun). A silencer/suppressor typically only affects the noise created by the muzzle blast and even then it's impossible to completely negate the sound created so it can still be heard. Which is why they seem useless in real life. But it's still significantly less sound produced than firing a gun without a silencer. Plus it also hides the muzzle flash when the guns fired. So like if a sniper fires a silenced weapon into a crowd, people are gonna be less certain where the bullet came from because they don't see the flash coming from the gun. Yeah, there are assassins you can hire. If you look on the right places on the dark web, you can find them. But you really need to know what you're doing otherwise you will probably get the FBI knocking down your door."
JamesBond,31bhrl,Greyclocks,2,Fri Apr 3 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"Plus it also hides the muzzle flash when the guns fired.   More importantly the muzzle blast which can kick up considerable amounts of dust. Most rifles already have a flash hider to suppress the flash, and with live ammunition there is already hardly any flash to begin with. A sniper rifle is so long the majority of the powder is burned off before it exits the barrel, and if you see a flash at all it will only be evident at night. Even shooting handguns indoors in a dim environment, you will only intermittently see a dim red flash. Depending on gun/ammo."
JamesBond,31bhrl,nealius,3,Fri Apr 3 23:34:27 2015 UTC,Mostly because successful assassins do not put out press releases.
JamesBond,31bhrl,obgynkenobi,3,Fri Apr 3 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"Why does everybody in fiction use silencers when they are proven to be pretty much useless in real life?   ...because they're not? Using subsonic ammunition they're pretty damn effective. Even with standard ammunition something like a 9mm could be easily assumed to be a car backfiring. Even more so since the vast majority of the public has no clue what a real suppressor sounds like. Even with the crack of the bullet breaking the sound barrier, the biggest advantage of a suppressor is masking the muzzle blast, which in the case of long-range work makes it hard for the enemy to discern from where the shot came."
JamesBond,31bhrl,nealius,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:29:45 2015 UTC,Using a muzzle suppressor or subsonic round is useful in a closed room so you don't disorientate yourself. It quiets the sound enough to not deafen you.

M does say quite confidently at the very end that ""they were very much in love"" up until Vesper met James. I think Vesper died believing it would save (or at least temporarily prolong) the lives of the two men she loved.  I also think Vesper handing over the suitcase full of money to Gettler was her fulfilling her earlier promise to deliver the money to Quantum in exchange for Bond's life; she may have left Bond that text message with Mr White's phone number in the hopes that he would see it in time and rescue her, though. The Yusef blackmailing was to ensure Vesper's cooperation before and during the poker tournament; after it was over, that's probably when Yusef stopped being used as a threat with Vesper.  We should note that in the novel of CR, Vesper's suicide note briefly mentions that she considered becoming pregnant with Bond's baby and maybe running away (with or without Bond himself) to South America to start a new life, once she realized SMERSH was on their tail."
JamesBond,31d40q,GetFreeCash,2,Sat Apr 4 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.   If in the novel of CR Vesper mentioned that she wanted to become pregnant with Bond, then that ultimately implies Bond was her true love and not Yusef.   Which begs the question: at what point did Vesper fall out of love with Yusef? It just annoys me to think that Vesper went through all that risk never knowing that Yusef was a fake."
JamesBond,31d40q,Chriias,5,Sat Apr 4 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"In the novel Vesper confesses a lot in her letter to Bond.  She was in love with a Pole in the RAF. To keep him alive she worked with the Russians; he would write her once a month.  She met Bond and eventually fell in love with him. She got to the point where she knew her work would have to end and her lover would die so she could be with Bond. She hoped to run away and start over with him by having his baby.  Then realizing they were after her, she decided to kill herself before SMERSH could get to her and maybe Bond as well."

We know that their codename systems seems to use colors as their last names as opposed to a numbered chain-of-command system like in SPECTRE. We know that money is of little concern to them.

For me, it would either be Connery's or Craig's 007. There's something rather animalistic about both of them (in a good way, a very good way) that makes me think they'd be just outstanding in bed. Rough, but outstanding.  I have no idea why but Brosnan's 007 strikes me as the type that would be competent but not amazing in bed, at least from a woman's perspective. He'd probably be more focussed on his own pleasure than mine (or whoever the lady was that he happened to be sleeping with) ... or maybe I'm just remembering the look on Miranda Frost's face after she slept with Bond in Die Another Day.  Dalton's 007 would probably alternate between being coldly distant and intensely passionate. I would sleep with Moore's 007 just to hear the post-coital quip.

His stylistic approach is something of a mix between Connery and Moore's Bond's and I think that lack of distinction in making the role his own and sort of being indefinable as a Bond character type is what people generally don't like about him in the part. And for a lot of people, it's also not a problem. He took traits that made Bond Bond and developed a unique type of spy. Those who grew up with him as ""their Bond"" are in their prime, 20 and 30 year olds, and I think I speak for many in that group when I say, he was our introduction to James Bond. He was how we got started, then the rest came afterward. For that reason alone, I think it endears people to him so he will always have his original fans. We may like other Bonds more now but we all remember our first, which means he's never truly a bad Bond at all. Just not what others are used to."

JamesBond,31dxi6,AirJordanFan93,5,Mon Apr 6 04:17:14 2015 UTC,He got handed awful films. The Brosnan Age apart from Goldeneye pretty much consisted of them trying to hop on the popular action movie tropes of the time. Brosnan despite the quality of his films is actually quite good in the role for the most part especially in TWINE. I think the big hype about Brosnan finally being Bond and having films that didn't really deliver doesn't help his standing either.

I had an acting coach once tell me after watching Remington Steele for the first time that ""It will be a crime if he's never Bond"".  But fuck he was given some lame movies (Apart from GoldenEye. Which is tied with Skyfall as my favorite film). They were just so dry and took Bond gadgets to an absurd level.

I've come to like Dalton more and more and I think he had more in him.  I would (would have) loved a Goldeneye with Dalton. '80s Dalton. That might be a perfect movie. But the film might have suffered from ""old-Bond-itis"". It's hard to say. Brosnan, though, fit as a more spec ops Bond in this.  You're talking Dalton in LALD? He would have been a young Bond. If he played a darker Bond from there I feel like people would have turned away from the franchise. People already look at his two entries as ""too dark for the series"". Conversely, Moore perhaps came too late, but I could be wrong.  Bean? Well Bond isn't supposed to die so no Sean Bean for me. But in reality, I just don't know if Bean has... Bond chops? If that makes sense. Maybe it's just because I, as well as a lot of people might, look back with hindsight but Bean... is just made to play a villain. I had to say it. Typecasts suck, I know, but it's just a movie truth. The guy is a baddie."
JamesBond,31bjac,jamedudijench,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:30:56 2015 UTC,Sharpe is more or less perfect hard evidence that Bean could have been Bond.
JamesBond,31bjac,Hufflepuffins,2,Fri Apr 3 17:28:52 2015 UTC,Hmm. I will have to take your word for it. I personally have not seen that series before.
JamesBond,31bjac,jamedudijench,2,Fri Apr 3 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"Waitjustadamnminute, EON wanted Bean to be Bond? I've never heard that before. I remember suggesting that on the alt.fan.james-bond USENET newsgroup around 1996 or so. I thought he would have been a great Bond. IIRC most of the others on the group didn't agree, though. :(    He can't be any more dour or rough than Craig is (and I like Craig's Bond just fine). Hell, we might have had a Craig-style Bond 10 years earlier if Bean had been 007 instead of 006."
JamesBond,31bjac,duranfan,2,Fri Apr 3 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"According to Wiki, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_actors_considered_for_the_James_Bond_character  No reference but then again, bit tough with the rumour being in the 90s + Bean doesn't seem one to be arsed about crying over not being Bond. So yeah, I think with Bean/007 being a good fit I'll believe it."
JamesBond,31bjac,sigersen,2,Fri Apr 3 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"As much as I like Dalton, he would have flopped following Connery. Moore had the Bond Lite thing down. He adapted Bond for the 70's, like it or not. I think Brosnan could have done TLD and I think Dalton could have done Goldeneye. Bean played Richard Sharpe. He could easily have played Bond. Read the books and watch the TV series. Compared to Richard Sharpe, James Bond is a pantywaist."
JamesBond,31bjac,dudelikeshismusic,2,Fri Apr 3 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"The thing about mixing those actors is that the shift in tone between movies would throw people off. We've come to know Craig and Dalton as the gritty, dark Bonds. Brosnan and Moore are fun popcorn Bonds. Connery had a good mix of both. The tone shifts with the actor."

JamesBond,31apv4,sigersen,3,Fri Apr 3 10:53:19 2015 UTC,The big thing that takes me out of a lot of the later movies is how old the Bonds are. Moore was 57 in his last. I can't buy it when Bond is in his 50's and hitting on 20 year old women.
JamesBond,31apv4,dudelikeshismusic,2,Fri Apr 3 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be a good idea to have a limit on the number of times an actor plays the role. The real tragedy of the series IMHO is that after Connery and Moore, no one of comparable charisma were chosen for the role."
JamesBond,31apv4,Sini01,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:53:53 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... I think that's a little unfair to say. 2 of the 4 remaining Bonds were specifically very Fleming Bond in their approach, making them closer to the actual James Bond than anyone else. Lazenby showed a more emotional side of Bond that, personally, I think Connery would have had a hard time pulling off. Especially as far into the series as it was. And Brosnan? Well Brosnan was trying to do his own thing, mixing the stylings of Connery and Moore. James Blend, if you will. Plus he's quite the handsome devil, I wouldn't say he has no charisma. But that's just my 2 cents."
JamesBond,31apv4,jamedudijench,2,Fri Apr 3 12:33:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think Dalton actually did a more up to date Bond, one more in line with modern Bond.  And being in my 30's I have to say that Brosnan is 'my Bond', I liked his interpretation a lot, but some moments in the movies fell a little flat, that's not Brosnans fault though.  I think if Lazenby had stayed in the role for a few more movies he really would have grown in to it, OHMSS is one of my favorite Bond films."
JamesBond,31apv4,terrymcginnisbeyond,2,Fri Apr 3 12:53:38 2015 UTC,"Brosnan is ""my Bond"" too but I can admit where the moments don't hit as well as they should. I wish Dalton would get more of his due. I always say the scene with him and John Rhys-Davies in the hotel room is such a book-esque, tense moment. Really good. But it would be really interesting to see if Lazenby could have followed up OHMSS. With the ending the way it was, how would his Bond have been? Very playful thought. But Craig is really doing the role nicely I think. Very satisfied so far."
JamesBond,31apv4,jamedudijench,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"It's tougher to say now because of the linear progression the films are taking. The actor could only play in so many movies until he is too old for a transition with a new actor to work well.  If the movies weren't so tightly attached to each other it'd be easier to get a younger guy in there. If there were bigger gaps in between CR, QoS, and Skyfall it would make a much stronger, longer lasting Bond franchise.  Seperate the three Craig movies by years and there is opportunity to slide a new actor into a different part of his life. Albeit the events may not be as important as the three Craig movies, but it would work to make a more complete progression.  I still love the direction Bond is going. Craig is a stone fucking killer."

I just found it most odd that no one would notice a gaijin running around the island.

I don't think the fandom is ready for a female Bond yet. And you're right, the series has not exactly adhered to strict rules of canon, well, ever. It would be a game changer for sure. I'm cool with females in male roles though. Like I was excited when they announced the first Star Wars spinoff, Rouge One with a female lead. I was like YES! This is gonna be so cool!

That piece of trivia is on IMDb.   According to the James Bond tailors in London, he has been both the lightest and heaviest of all the James Bonds. The tailors who fitted him for his Bond films state that in his first Bond movie, GoldenEye (1995), he weighed 164 pounds, making him the lightest actor to play Bond. However, in his fourth Bond movie, Die Another Day (2002), he weighed 211 pounds, making him the heaviest actor to play Bond.   www.imdb.com/name/nm0000112/bio"

I think my idea of ""ageing"", has more to do with the years taking their toll elsewhere. The lines in the face, the bags under the eyes.   I'm probably not the best judge of this, being a heterosexual man, but I've never quite got why the ladies like Daniel Craig on a superficial level.

In Goldeneye his hair is longer than in any of the other three, and is often tousled around giving him a rugged/active look.  It's also very black and shiny.  For some reason in the rest of his movies, they gave him a much shorter haircut and didn't seem to color it while it started to grey.  It wasn't really so bad in TND, but by TWINE his haircut was rather ""severe"" and made him look more like an uptight stockbroker than a fun, active, secret agent whose hair is always getting messed up during action.  By DAD his age was definitely showing too.    Oh, also, I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that they made him gain 20-40 lbs after Goldeneye.  That is another factor that would make him look older, since most people gain weight as they age.  I take it this has come up because Goldeneye was on repeat on BBC last night?  I watched a few minutes, and I do agree that whenever I see some of that movie, it is striking how young he looks.  And as someone else commented, he definitely has helmet hair in it.

Sure everyone here likes some of the movies on this list but they still may deserve to be on it. I even wonder if DAF should be on it. I don't think it's really that bad a movie.  I would put TWINE ahead of DAD because I think TWINE is boring. As over the top as DAD is, certainly a boring Bond film is the biggest sin of all. I would take DAF off the list and swap it for Thunderball. It's as boring as TWINE. I may take a look at the list again and see if I can make room for Skyfall.  If you will excuse me, I'm off to watch  TMWTGG. :)"

JamesBond,314wrv,jamedudijench,4,Thu Apr 2 01:51:44 2015 UTC,"The money that paid for it was a gift from my Dad, as was the glass/water thimble. Locally made crystal.

JamesBond,314wrv,jamedudijench,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"Amazing! The pieces are beautiful. I'll say I have taken a liking to brandy lately. That glassware is perfect for my aging alcohol tastes. I keep wanting to make an authentic Vesper with the traditional higher proof gin and vodka. Like I'm partial to Stoli but given I'm in the alcohol oppressive U.S., blue label (100 proof) is hard to find. If it even exists here. And people look at me like I'm crazy when I ask about aperitif wines. But hell yeah, man, live it up like Fleming! Well not exactly like Fleming. Please be with us on this earth for a very long time, but enjoy that tantalizing scotch for sure."
JamesBond,314wrv,jamedudijench,3,Thu Apr 2 02:31:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, No Haig and Haig with soda for this fella.  Living in Eastern Canada is even worse as its all poor folks who grew up from Families of fishermen and coal miners who drink mouthwash and acetone for a buzz. Polar Ice (serviceable vodka...) makes a 90 proof version, and Tangeuray 10 is over-proofed. So those might be the easiest options for a Vesper. Myself, I stick with either Gordon's (I know the recipe is different now...) and Stoli despite it not being as strong as it should. But hey -- it's a delicious drink. I actually have Champagne coupe's from a friend for Christmas, so I try to drink it out of those whenever possible."

I like hearing about other cultures. So is that like a legitimate problem or do you just mean it as a cultural distinction? Isn't TPB filmed in Nova Scotia? Is that an accurate depiction of that region? I'm guessing not but i think you know what I mean. Like is it a parody for a reason? I mean I some what understand. I live in an area that's largely a run down valley of old steel mills that were once booming in northeast Ohio. Which I'm actually a native of southern California so suffice it to say it's culture shock for sure.  I will say though, it just seems like there's regions of Canada that just have their shit together way more than we do here."
JamesBond,314wrv,jamedudijench,3,Thu Apr 2 03:09:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Trailer Park Boys is accurate in an exaggerated way - 'Unemployed Alcoholic' etc. I live in Halifax Regional Municipality, but everyone still breaks it down into Halifax, Bedford (generally richer area) and Dartmouth (practice yo' stabbin'). A lot of the rural communities are where the stereotypical problems lay in my home Province, and sadly, NS is MOSTLY rural. And old, we have the oldest, fattest, poorest, sickest population in Canada.  There's a term passed around here called NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard) where a business will come in and say, try to set up a wind farm. Yay! Cheaper power. But everyone will get up in arms about it for some reason, then complain that NS Power is gouging them again. There was this report called 'The Ivany Report' that sums up all the problems with the Maritimes in general.

They say that heroin is a bigger problem in small towns than it is in big cities. And the bit you said about unemployed, alcoholic, fat, poor, etc. I felt like I was reading something written by someone from this area. I look and wonder and it's like you see some people have just given up. It is pretty depressing.   Oh wow, I just looked at a headline on The Chronicle Herald that reads, ""Is Nova Scotia the next Detroit?"". That puts it into perspective for this ugly American. So is it that people just wanna rely on government indefinitely? That's a fairly popular mentality where I live."

JamesBond,3128x4,rpp8,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"I think they're stretching them out to finish close to Spectre's release.

JamesBond,3128x4,akanefive,2,Thu Apr 2 13:10:15 2015 UTC,I only started subbing to the show at the start of 2014 and they did Goldeneye and Live and Let Die pretty close together I think there was a 2 week gap between those shows. Since then we have been getting the fairly lengthy gaps between shows. How frequent where the shows being released in 2013
JamesBond,3128x4,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, I only started last summer. But there's a point in an episode where Mira makes an off handed remark about how tired he's getting of doing them. New episodes are less frequent since then, but they seem more into it. (Also, both of them are super busy of late.)"
JamesBond,3128x4,akanefive,2,Thu Apr 2 14:55:41 2015 UTC,I think it was the License To Kill show where they said they would be doing shows more frequent but due to their schedules they weren't able to. I don't recall Mira ever saying he was sick of doing it but it has been well over a year since I listened to the older shows.   From memory here is a rough timeline of show releases  Live and Let Die Feb 2014 License to Kill May 2014 Man with The Golden Gun July 2014 Living Daylights October 2014 Spy Who Loved Me December 2014 A View To A Kill December 2014  Moonraker April 2015  Also throw in episodes in between such as Mission Briefings as well as the Best and Worst of Bond and the SPECTRE reaction show which I think was released the same day or day after The Spy Who Loved Me show

JamesBond,312hzd,jakielim,1 point,Thu Apr 2 11:48:33 2015 UTC,I figure its due to the sheer size of the films Gilbert directed. The films he helmed are likely the biggest Bond films of the 1962-1989 period. Not sure why its titled the Monorail Trilogy seeing the only monorail in these movies was in YOLT. Or at least I only recall seeing it in YOLT and not the other two.

JamesBond,30u6qj,mcqq,7,Mon Mar 30 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, but having Skyfall as a brief unrelated adventure amidst the larger storyline was quite welcome, in the same way that Goldfinger is refreshing when rewatching the Connery films."
JamesBond,30u6qj,SpaghettiYoda,3,Mon Mar 30 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it was a really nice turnover film... it fully established the new MI6 supporting cast (M, Moneypenny, and Q), which will help bring a sense of completion to the series when it's all said and done.   I think the fact that it might come in the very middle of the Craig series is just awesome in a storytelling way."

JamesBond,30tg3m,akanefive,5,Mon Mar 30 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"I think an easy first step would be to add some language to the sidebar about racist statements.  Another, maybe less popular idea would be to have a moratorium on who the next Bond will be until after Craig leaves the role, or some other newsworthy event happens. There are plenty of other topics with all the news coming out, and the Bond 7 talk, even when everyone is on their best behavior, tends to get a little circlejerky. I'm not totally in favor of this idea, but I'm curious if others think it's an issue."
JamesBond,30tg3m,dibsODDJOB,7,Mon Mar 30 17:12:10 2015 UTC,"a moratorium on who the next Bond will be until after Craig leaves the role, or some other newsworthy event happens.    I think that's taking it a bit too far. Discussing Bond actors, past, present, and future is such a large part of Bond fandom, that outlawing it seems like overreacting. Of course people are going to disagree, it's a highly subjective matter (except that Moore was too old ;) ). I don't want to censor a whole topic because of a few idiots with racist comments, who can be deleted or banned as needed."

Not really. Sort of.   A secondary approach could be to ban all rumors related to upcoming media and create a new subreddit for such discussions."

Thankfully, the fans and mods were very quick to jump on the riff raff and it hardly seems to be a problem anymore.

JamesBond,30tmmi,alexanderthepoor,11,Mon Mar 30 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"So I'd like to add my two cents to the whole Oberhauser/Bond backstory. In the book Octopussy we're told that a man named Hannes Oberhauser was a father figure to Bond after his parents died. Side note, he also taught Bond how to ski, so we might get some skiing sequences if we're lucky. Anyway, in the SPECTRE trailer we see some papers transferring custody of Bond from an H. Oberhauser to Bond's aunt Charmain. Alongside this is the photo of what is likely young Bond, Hannes Oberhauser, and another young man. This person looks slightly taller than Bond, but not yet an adult. I think that this person could be the son of Hannes Oberhauser, which would likely be Christoph Waltz's character Franz Oberhauser. This explains why he would say James instead of Mr. Bond and explains the existence of both Franz Oberhauser and H. Oberhauser.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I would be more excited if Waltz's Oberhauser became Blofeld or if there was a reveal at the end that he was only a pawn for Blofeld. On one hand Waltz is a great actor and this personal relationship to Bond could be interesting for a villain, but I don't know if I would like that big of a change to the character of Blofeld. I definitely agree that it would be amazing to see an actor no one expected have a surprise reveal at the end as Blofeld, but if so, I hope that it's a total surprise, like Interstellar, and not just Denbigh.  TL;DR - It's probably Denbigh"
JamesBond,30tmmi,eeple,8,Mon Mar 30 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"Matt Damon confirmed as Blofeld. I 100% agree. As much as I dislike them connecting movies with cliffhangers (Casino/Quatum style), it would be a great lead in for the next movie."

JamesBond,30tmmi,JCappy,7,Wed Apr 1 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"He may be Blofeld, he may not be. But I certainly wouldn't say the trailer made no allusions to the possibility. Quite the contrary, in fact - I think the trailer was designed specifically to keep the Waltz is Blofeld Theory swirling.   Building up the duel mystery of Bond's past and the existence of SPECTRE and punctuating it with the introduction of, in the context of the trailer, a figure who could only be the leader of such an organization, seated at the head of a table very reminiscent of the classic SPECTRE meeting tables, shrouded in shadow very much like Blofeld, wearing clothing very much like Blofeld, and delivering a line implying the culmination of a lengthy (in pop culture terms) anticipation of meeting.   I'm not saying he IS Blofeld. But this trailer sure as sugar wants you to think he is. These were conscious decisions by the filmmakers and the ad men."

But this trailer sure as sugar wants you to think he is. These were conscious decisions by the filmmakers and the ad men.   Exactly. I took the ""It's been a long time..."" line as a clear double meaning. It infers to some past the characters may have had and is a direct nod to the audience who damn well knows that it's been nearly 40 years since the last time Blofeld and Bond sparred and have been widely anticpating the return ever since the name 'Spectre' was revealed.   As for Waltz's character just being another pawn for Blofeld - isn't that what we've already had through this entire Craig Quantum arc? First Le Chifre and Green are pawns for Mr White and now Mr White is seemingly a pawn for Waltz's character - do we really need another layer of that without it becoming repetitive?"
JamesBond,30tmmi,fairway-frank,2,Mon Mar 30 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"I hate it when sequels render the events of previous films as less significant. Like MI6 was scared shitless of Quantum, and at the time Quantum was a reimagined Spectre. So if it comes out that Quantum is just some pawn of Spectre's that'd be super lame. I mean they had people in the British government, some special envoy to the PM remember? Doesn't get much scarier than that... Sounds like Quantum was some serious shit. Don't want them to be trivialized just because some people didn't like the second film"
JamesBond,30tmmi,dragonsky,3,Tue Mar 31 03:04:36 2015 UTC,Has anyone ever considered that M might be Blofeld?  I don't know enough to research it further.  Can someone discredit me?

JamesBond,30tmmi,OHMSS008,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"When I watched the trailer, I was thinking that the opening scene after the traditional gun barrel placement (I hope have it at the beginning with Craig from now on) is a flashback to young Bond, his parents death and/or transfer of Bond's guardianship.  Another twist could be a redo of the only good thing from Die Another Day, where they use the opening number to help ush the plot along. Maybe have a reference to his parents' deaths and then use the song's video showing them die ect..."
JamesBond,30tmmi,empossible,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP's theory that Waltz might not be Blofeld. I think he would be perfect for the role but it seems strange to me that they would introduce Blofeld as the main villain of Craig's 4th film just as they reintroduce Spectre. From a writing perspective wouldn't it make more sense to have Waltz as Oberhauser and to have Blofeld appear (or be alluded to) at the end of 'Spectre', leading to a climactic showdown in Craig's 5th and final film rather than have Waltz reappear as the same primary villain twice?   Don't know if this has been debunked but I have heard some rumors about another actor playing Blofeld. Keep in mind I haven't read the leaked script so I might be totally off the mark.  Potential Spoilers   Before the cast was announced and official shooting began it seems a small interior train scene was shot with Craig in Morocco, around this time Craig was photographed with his friend Mark Strong ""on holiday"" in Morocco. I think they shot some ending scene where Strong is revealed as Blofeld - It would be pretty crafty of them to film this scene before announcing the cast and title but it would allow them to keep it under the radar and have it as more of surprise. Again I could be totally wrong but Strong would make a good Blofeld as he is physically imposing as he was in the books (if I remember correctly) also he's bald!"

JamesBond,30t6kj,keysersoze1015,4,Mon Mar 30 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"That's a misleading use of the term ""shared universe"" when they meant continuity.  Got my hopes up that they might consider other movies sharing the Bond Universe. Maybe one where Idris Elba plays another agent of MI6, or one where Jon Hamm plays an American counterpart. It could be cool to see Bond as a shadowy figure in such movies.  Edit: What if, after Spectre, Bond became a ""ghost"", apparently disappearing, people not knowing if he's dead or alive. Imagine the next movie, Elba is playing an agent trying to work a case whilst also trying to figure out what Bond might be doing, figuring out clues he might still be alive and tangling with Elba's case. By the end, he's solved his mission, but he's not sure if it really was Bond that was crossing paths with him.  The next movie, Jon Hamm is a CIA agent (Felix?) having to cooperate with MI6 to bring some organisation down. His friend Bond has disappeared, maybe died. But some elusive man is putting pieces together for him. At the end maybe he finds out that Bond has gone deep under as a double agent working for Spectre/Quantum.  Then we complete the trilogy with Bond making an awesome return as protagonist."

JamesBond,30qanc,ProfShea,0,Wed Apr 1 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"That shouldn't matter though. The simple fact that Fleming wrote that he was white back in the 60s shouldn't preclude the modern Bond from being black.  Fleming's Bond wasn't blond, but Craig is blond. Should that matter?"
JamesBond,30qanc,wkfink,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what type of bond movie the producers are trying to create... Is it supposed to be gritty and rough and true to the author's intent, or is it supposed to be a movie that makes money with someone popular in it? Does it have to be MI6? Why not CIA or KGB or Polish secret service? Does he have to be straight or can he be gay? What about just bi? Does he have to be a loose cannon that doesn't play by the rules? Maybe he can just be a guy that does everything by the book...?  It becomes that classic question, how many planks of wood does it take to have a different ship?   At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter, but I think that fans might fairly feel as if the current producers are cashing in on the Bond name while pushing a younger and more diversely appealing star. There's nothing wrong or bad with that, but I can see how fans might not like the name of James Bond changed in order to get more money for a studio. Realistically, those same fans might see a movie starring Elba with a similar plot and a different name. To them, James Bond is more than a name and a plot. I understand their love."
JamesBond,30qanc,ProfShea,6,Wed Apr 1 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think Moore's comments were racist at all. I get it, sorta. Here's my take on it. If they went with Elba as Bond, of course it could be viewed as playing the race card, because the race card IS probably part of the decision. In 2011, Marvel Comics killed off Peter Parker and replaced him with a thirteen year old black kid from Brooklyn named Miles Morales. Fans were outraged until they realized Miles was a decent, well-written character. Did Marvel pull the race card to appear more racially conscious to attract more viewers? You bet your butts they did. It's kinda racist in and of itself, thinking about it, but it's sadly the world we live in, and, hey, I like Miles. The point of Miles is they pulled it off. In 2013(?), Nick Fury whispered a secret (Which still has yet to be revealed) in Thor's ear that left him magically unable to wield his hammer. He decides to use a battle axe, ends up loosing an arm, replacing it with a cybernetic one. Meanwhile, an unnamed woman with no backstory as of yet and no real personality traits, comes in and is able to skillfully wield the hammer in battle. Thor is flabbergasted and tries with all his might to regain his hammer. He can't. He decides to retire and gives Jane Doe the title of Thor. As you can expect, she is universally hated. Her only definable trait is ""strong woman."" She kinda sucks, imo. Jane Doe Thor and Miles Morales are both characters that were admittedly created to appeal to the PC crowd. The difference is Miles is awesome and lady Thor with no name is a pencil thin piece of suck character. The same ideas can be applied to Idris as 007. Yes, he's black, and Sony's decision to pick him or not will, probably, in some way, be based on race. I, as a straight white male, would be perfectly fine with Idris as 007 (actually I'm a big fan) if there's something unique about him aside from being black."
JamesBond,30qanc,fiestaoffire,-1,Sun Mar 29 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, all this whining about how a black Bond will be unrealistic or stupid or whatever just reminds me of all the crap that happened when Daniel Craig was cast as ""blond Bond.""  People were saying that was the death knell of the franchise, threatening to boycott it, antithetical to the very concept of Bond, etc., but the franchise is probably even more respected now than it was immediately prior to Craig getting the role. Casino Royale is my personal favorite movie (and generally accepted as a very good Bond movie) and Skyfall was a critical darling. Hell, Skyfall made a joke about Bond possibly being bisexual or having a gay sexual experience which is definitely counter to what Bond is typically stereotyped as.   I think this'll just be version 2.0 of blond Bond. Some fans will be loud about how this will destroy the franchise or whatever, but if they put out a good movie, moviegoers will still watch it and will still enjoy it. The casual movie goer still sees the 007 franchise as a spy action movie, and that's what they're coming for. They didn't find a blond Bond abhorrent, and I don't think they'll find black Bond abhorrent either.  Also, slightly unrelated, but isn't femThor just Thor's love interest? Or was that a red herring? I don't follow Marvel too carefully."

Not unless you make him an adoptive son. That reminds me of the story where a plane crashed outside the advanced African nation of Wakanda. The only survivor was a Blonde boy the prodigy of a Scottish father and Swiss mother...may they R.I.P. The young boy is brought to the attention of King T'Chaka who then adopts him as his very own. The Kings son, T'Challa befriends the blonde boy like a brother. One day, the Evil adventurer Ulysses Klaw attacks Wakanda. Though they do defeat him, it is at a high price. King T'Chaka is dead, as is his brother S'yan. Worst of all, T'Challa, the Heir to the king of Wakanda and the Black Panther ceremonial title, given to the chief of the Panther Tribe, is dead. This leaves T'Chaka's only surviving son, albeit Blonde son, to take the mantle of King and more importantly the Black Panther moniker. At his crowning ceremony attended by the many, T'Chaka's adopted Son was ask ""How shall ye be Known to your Wakandian subjects?"" ""I wish to take the name my birth parents gave me...in honour of their memory.

Where and when did he get it? Who knows. And who cares, because why the hell not? It was cool.  I'd rather see Idris Elba as 007 than a less-competent white actor.  But again... I don't think he'll get the chance, because Daniel Craig is 47 and Idris Elba is 42. That's only a 5 year difference, and it'll be about 5 years before he gets his chance, since Craig is signed on for one more after Spectre."

It's ridiculous. And the people complaining are usually the first to try and claim that they're ""colorblind.""  There's also the fact that even Fleming wasn't above the idea of making changes to Bond's history when needed. If they decided to make the next Bond black, I'm sure they could easily pull it off."

JamesBond,30oc1z,MLGCalamity,16,Sun Mar 29 05:29:44 2015 UTC,He is just too old. Idris is already older than Craig. He could be an amazing baddie though.
JamesBond,30oc1z,NaturalAI,5,Sun Mar 29 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. His age is the only thing I think he has going against him. And that makes me sad, because I think he would absolutely crush it as Bond."
JamesBond,30oc1z,Stringfellow__Hawke,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"Yes.  This is a valid objection in a way that race isn't  The physicality of the role demands a certain age range.  We've already seen an older Bond in Never Say Never Again, and it changes the tone - it introduces themes of newly found fallibility plus it makes the already problematic womanizing even more sketchy :) .    It was an interesting experiment, but I wouldn't like it as the new normal.  Elba would be a great Bond today, but I'd like a Bond who can do a few movies and I wonder if that's possible."
JamesBond,30oc1z,xurble,2,Sun Mar 29 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"NSNA isn't the only older Bond portrayal. Roger Moore was 45(!) when he STARTED the role of Bond. Finished when he was 58. He probably shouldn't have made the last few at his age, but the fact is he played Bond while being older.  Having said that, I agree that Idris is a contemporary of Craig and if he was to play Bond, should be playing him RIGHT NOW and not after Craig steps away."
JamesBond,30oc1z,compaqesc,2,Sun Mar 29 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they shouldn't have cast Moore either, the guy couldn't even run :)  Plus it's a case in point for the dirty old man side of things.  In all seriousness though.  While I like some of the Roger Moore movies, he'd never get cast in the role at that age and in that shape today.  Just as attitudes have changed to make a black Bond possible, I think modern expectations of pacing and stunt choreography make an older Bond less desirable today.  That said, Elba looks a lot fitter than Moore, so maybe?"
JamesBond,30oc1z,xurble,10,Sun Mar 29 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"Elba is a great actor. He's not a great ""Black"" actor. He's just a great actor.  I like him. Bond is a fictional White character. Can we please put this to bed ?  I think Elba has. I don't want to see Elba as Bond and I don't want to see Matt Damon as Shaft. Fair enough ?"

JamesBond,30oc1z,are_you_nucking_futs,2,Sun Mar 29 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"People use the excuse that Bond is white as he comes from the upper crust of European society, being of British / Swiss descent, attending Eton etc. But that's part of the lore they are trying to move away from. In the 1950s when the books first came out, most British civil servants (and probably all their spies) were Eton and Oxbridge educated, 99% male and white, so it made sense for Bond to be that.  But society has moved on, as has Bond. Bond's extreme misogyny has been toned down dramatically. In the novel Casino Royale he thinks women should 'stay in the kitchen with their pots and pans' and likens his desire to sleep with Vesper as having the ""sweet tang of rape"", typical 50's mentality. In the 1960s with the films it's toned down a bit but take Goldfinger, Connery's Bond forces himself on Galore.  21st Century Britain though is much more diverse and egalitarian than the Britain of the immediate post war years. Moneypenny being black in 2012 seems believable.  MI6 no doubt has many black agents in real life today unlike 60 years ago, and British upper society is still very white but it's not impossible to be non-white and be in the upper echelons of society.  TL;DR: Bond couldn't be black in the 1950s, but in 21st Century Britain, it's possible and fairly realistic."

So many classic elements to Bonds character have changed so drastically in the past 10 years, I don't think making him black would really be that jarring. I don't care if he's blue, I just wish he still threw his hat on the coat rack when he walks into Mi6."
JamesBond,30oc1z,AUBalrog,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:31:08 2015 UTC,This argument only holds water if you keep the setting in the 60's and adhere strictly to Flemming's literary description of 007. The Bond films have always evolved with the times. This would be no different.
JamesBond,30oc1z,xurble,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"Bond has a history in Scotland, it's part of his character. He has a Scottish family coat of arms. From an aristocratic family. To say bond is Black would be like saying the queen/king of England is black."
JamesBond,30oc1z,grania17,0,Sun Mar 29 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"I don't get this attitude in movie watchers.  Because it has always been so, it must always be so.  Theatre has been routinely recasting roles regardless of race for years.  And in that case it's not even the same character in a new story, it's the same fucking story retold.  Take Shakespeare - lots of these characters are actual real historical people, kings of England and the like.   They couldn't be more canonically white.  Black actors do just fine.  The purpose of a movie is to tell an interesting story.  In a franchise like Bond there are certainly elements and tropes that we expect that make it a Bond movie, but given how many actors have played him, in quite different styles, I would say that continuity of portrayal is not high on the list of priorities.  Appealing to his backstory in the novels makes very little sense.  Firstly the movies make very little (any?) reference to it.  Secondly, Bond's continuity-breaking longevity over the years means his back story can't be constant anyway.  Bond is always late thirties / early forties ""now"", meaning his background is constantly moving in time too.  Are you seriously trying to say that the difference between growing up in the late 20s and the late 70s can be glossed over but race can't?  The Bond franchise doesn't give two shits about continuity.  If they did, they wouldn't have kept M constant when they rebooted Casino Royal as an origin story. They wouldn't have given Sean Connery's Aston to  Daniel Craig.  It's all fourth wall breaking nonsense, but it doesn't matter because it doesn't affect the movie you are currently watching.  And neither would a black Bond."
JamesBond,30oc1z,compaqesc,3,Wed Apr 1 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"And yet a white person couldn't be Shaft, or be in musical The Colour Purple, or the Lion King.  You can't only have it one way."

White Superman, White Batman, White Spiderman, White James Bond, etc.  I'd pay you money TO-DAY to see a white John Shaft movie, if you could write a script in which that made sense. There's a difference between race being INTEGRAL to a character and INCIDENTAL to a character. This is the point you seem to be missing."
JamesBond,30oc1z,xurble,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"Bond's race isn't Incidental. It's part of who he is. You might pull it off if you make him out as being 1/4 black, or maybe even 1/2 if both of his parents are 1/2."
JamesBond,30oc1z,grania17,7,Sun Mar 29 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"The color purple deals with the experience of race. Shaft is an iconically black role. So no, you couldn't have white actors in those roles.

Ten years ago i might have thought he'd be great if he'd been suggested.

As an actor I can see how that would be extremely frustrating."

I also hate the fan theory on Bond being a code name, this lends credence to it, and I dislike that.  Idris is also too old IMO, and instead of arguing about who may or may not know best, why not stick to a character archetype that we know is what Flemming wanted? Craig being blonde did not make Bond any better or worse, it was dark blonde and often hard to tell if it was light brown or dark blonde - so it did not require a lot of consideration. Bond being an African/Asian/Indian/Arab would be very noticeable and equally within the realms of a race change. If they are going to play the race change card I would also prefer Sammy Sheik over Idris Elba."
JamesBond,30oc1z,Portponky,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:12:45 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the fan theory.  It's never been true and a black Bond wouldn't magically make it true.  The bottom line is that all the movies are essentially separate from each other except for the occasions where they specifically position themselves as sequels (like Connery's Blofeld trilogy or the four Craig movies).  If you want to hold the series to a strict continuity, you can actually prove that Connery-Brosnan were all the same man: On Her Majesty's Secret Service has a scene where Lazenby goes through a bunch of Connery's souvenirs, the Moore movies contain several references to Lazenby's marriage in OHMSS, and Brosnan has a number of gadgets and souvenirs from previous Bonds (Die Another Day in particular does a bunch of this). Dalton's the only one I can't connect off the top of my head, but I'm fairly confident there's a reference to Lazenby's marriage somewhere in Licence to Kill. I may be wrong about that one, though.  Craig was a reset, and nobody cares at all.  Most people don't give a damn about James Bond series continuity, and the people who do care should know enough to know the code name thing isn't actually true and the series doesn't really have much proper continuity."

JamesBond,30oc1z,dragonsky,5,Sun Mar 29 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the confusion regarding Roger Moore was based on the nationalities of the previous Bonds. The ""English-English"" thing might refer to the fact that only himself and Daniel Craig are from England. The others are Scottish, Welsh and Australian. Although Idris was born in England so....  In terms of race, some argue that the character of James Bond was literally supposed to be the same one through all of the original twenty films (from Connery to Brosnan), and although that's highly implausible, I guess one could make the case that his race was necessary for the sake of continuity.   However, Craig is the first Bond in the reboot series, so who knows how they'll handle the transition to a new actor. Unless race is an absolute inherent quality to the character, I don't see why the role couldn't be cast colorblind. There are tons of deviations from the novels by Fleming, so why is this one particular aspect, his skin color, so fundamental? I think the primary, character defining thing most people take away from watching Bond films is that James Bond is British, not that he is white.    Personally, I'd like to see Idris take on his own franchise though. He'd make a great Bond, but I'd much rather see him in a brand new IP franchise, Luther feature, or as the new Alex Cross. Something he could really make his own."

JamesBond,30oc1z,compaqesc,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"PBS Game/Show had an episode on wetter or not Link from The Legend of Zelda could be a girl. They used some concepts that I want to use in this debate, as the James Bond series is in a very interesting position.   They made the difference between a singular character and a honorific character. Singular characters are one specific character existing in one timeline, while honorific characters are characters who share names and personalities. Mario is singular, Link is honorific.   I would also argue that when stories are completely rebooted and told with the intent of telling a different kind of story, the characters become honorific. Adam West's Batman is not Micheal Keaton's Batman, who in turn is not Christian Bale's Batman. Making changes in the race/gender/sexuality/whatever of the character, along with the rest of the story is not a betrayal of the character that was, but a redefinition of the character that is.  This is why I like the idea of a female Link, a Doctor who is not a white man, or Donald Glover as Spider-Man when they reboot it. These changes does not conflict with the narrative or the character, as we come to know them anew.  On the other hand, making drastic changes in a character midway a ongoing story feels like a betrayal. You have come to know them, and suddenly their character are changed arbitrarily. Let's say Harrison Ford didn't come back as Han Solo in Star Wars VII. I would argue that reacting negatively to a black actor replacing him is not racist, as it ruins the feel of continuity  that the rest of the narrative tells you it has. Same if Lando were replaced by a white actor. Or if Morgan Freeman became Dumbledore after Richard Harris, instead of Michael Gambon.  In the case of James Bond, we are in a strange grey zone. The actor has been recast many times, the timeline is fleeting and we had a soft reboot. It's not a clear and straight timeline, but it is still there. Fan theories about code names aside, many people view this character as a singular character. And when you make a striking change like changing the characters race, many people are going to react. This is not the character they know.  Personally, if it were a hard reboot as Idris Elba or any other ""non-English English"" actor took the mantle as Bond, I would be much more accepting of it. But if they are continuing the same wonky timeline they are using now, I would prefer him as white."

I just feel like there is currently a diversity trend going on. I feel like there would be an utter shit storm if they changed a black character to a white character arbitrarily.  I feel like they should make new characters like the ultimate spider-man(whom I love). Sorry this kind of turned into a ramble but I just wanted to get this out there since I have never written it down.   TLDR: I don't feel racist when I say I want white characters to stay white.

JamesBond,30oc1z,Seesawkarma,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"Mr. T is a black actor, so I don't think there's any reason to see him as anything other than a black actor. John Shaft's race in Shaft is integral to the film as it's a blaxploitation film.   Bond has always been described and portrayed as white, so it's natural to see him that way, but I don't really think there's anything inherent to the character that would prevent him from being portrayed by another race. He's a highly trained, suave, British, secret agent. That's not really too limiting of a description. If there's a story that hinges on his whiteness, I'm not familiar with it."
JamesBond,30oc1z,akanefive,-1,Sun Mar 29 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"Ok I should have said BA Barachas, and Shaft was a TV series (don't know about the blaxploitation movie, not that I've seen the film myself). But the point I was trying to make is that back in 80's when the films were prolific, I think it'd be fair to say a lot of white kids identified with Bond while a whole bunch of black kids wanted to be like Shaft or BA.   I don't think there is a moment in any of the books where he's descibed to be white, but he's a spy. He's supposed to fit in to high profile infiltration and subterfuge and in the fifties that would have been far easier as a white guy. That's not to say that today's modern bond needs to be like that, but I just imagine Ian Fleming had intended him to be white.   In any case, I don't see it being an issue if Idris did become Bond, I just feel that the character has a white familiarity. I think that having a teeny tiny scene at the beginning where it refreshes people's memory that ""James Bond"" is a code name and not the spy's birth name (IIRC that's how it works), it'd work without upsetting too many folks.   And let's not forget the ""blonde bond"" fiasco, and it ended up giving us one of the best Bonds to date."
JamesBond,30oc1z,Griddamus,9,Fri Apr 10 08:24:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a moment in any of the books where he's descibed to be white, but he's a spy.   Actually it is mentioned in the novels that he looks quite a bit like Hoagy Carmichael who is white.  James Bond is the character's real name. The idea that it is just a code name, like 007, is fan theory.  The point about infiltration and subterfuge in the 50s makes sense, but as you pointed out, it's not really as relevant today. There are secret agents/spies of different races and genders."
JamesBond,30oc1z,akanefive,0,Fri Apr 10 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"I saw on wikipedia that apparently Flemming's inspiration of Bond was from some American bird expert named James Bond.   Flemming mentions: ""It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born""  I mean, it is pretty clear that Flemming wanted Bond to be a white guy, because he cast Bond as a white guy originally. People say he did not specifically mention he was white, but that is because Flemming did not consider what kind of assholes in the future would want to change his lifes work."
JamesBond,30oc1z,Shanyi,2,Sun Mar 29 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"James Bond isn't a code name, that's been debunked in four different films. Nevertheless, I wouldn't have a problem with Elba as Bond if he's the best man for the job. But I think he'll be too old by the time the part opens up."
JamesBond,30oc1z,Maximus8910,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:45:52 2015 UTC,So who would you recommend for the job at the moment?
JamesBond,30nswt,jvolmon,3,Sun Mar 29 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"I hate looking into Bond's past. Hint at it, that's fine, but for the most part let it be a mystery. If they turn out to be brothers I'll be upset, if they turn out to be childhood friends I still probably won't like the idea."
JamesBond,30nswt,raysweater,2,Sun Mar 29 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"I changed the photo filters, and we can see that Christopher Waltz is with a Monocle. What does that mean? Donald Pleasence when he played Blofeld in 007 With Only Live Twice he wore a monocle.   just so we're clear, no he did not"
JamesBond,30mvkq,planetsalic,23,Sat Mar 28 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"I took it more as Quantum is probably a pawn of SPECTRE, which would more than adequately legitimize them as a global threat."

JamesBond,30mvkq,wkfink,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:24:54 2015 UTC,I assumed the chess board implied that Bond and White were both just pawns to Spectre.
JamesBond,30mvkq,eoinster,8,Mon Mar 30 17:57:46 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. They could be separate. That was actually my first thought but Bond said that Mr. Whites name came up and I assumed it came up in regards to a spectre meeting which I find strange if quantum and spectre were one entity
JamesBond,30mvkq,mathis007,3,Sat Mar 28 21:41:21 2015 UTC,Doesn't spectre make two groups fight to the death before eliminating the victor? Maybe they set up quantum to fight mi6 then attack whoever survived? Unlikely hat quantum could destroy Britain as a nation but could soften them up by killing their best agents - Mr White actually saved Bond's life.
JamesBond,30mvkq,are_you_nucking_futs,6,Sun Mar 29 04:16:20 2015 UTC,"From White's haggard appearance, and the fact he seems to be hidden away in some kind of remote lakeside house, I'm going to suggest he's hiding.  Quantum may be a breakaway organisation from SPECTRE, one which has now been weakened and nearly extinguished, so when White says he always expected death to come with a familiar face, he's really saying he always expected it'd be SPECTRE who would find him first and kill him, not Bond."
JamesBond,30mvkq,broadfuckingcity,1 point,Sun Mar 29 11:11:24 2015 UTC,"Based on some pages of the alleged script, it could be that he is on painkillers and that's why he is a little bit woozy. No comment if he goes by the alias Mr. Lambert."
JamesBond,30mvkq,Spoonman007,4,Mon Mar 30 04:10:20 2015 UTC,I picture Quantum to be to SPECTRE what Smersh was back in the day.

JamesBond,30js1h,Willravel,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"You're forgertting Roberto Schaefer in Quantum of Solace. That film was beauftiful, even if in a bit more traditional way than Skyfall. The tight shots in some scenes might be controversial, but it doesn't change the fact it looked really good."
JamesBond,30js1h,-WISCONSIN-,3,Sat Mar 28 01:55:31 2015 UTC,Oberhauser's first name is Hannes. Hannes Oberhauser!
JamesBond,30js1h,Willravel,3,Sat Mar 28 13:56:03 2015 UTC,Oh boy I CANNOT wait.
JamesBond,30js1h,rrob002,2,Sat Mar 28 14:53:12 2015 UTC,You must.
JamesBond,30js1h,RodKimble_Stuntman,6,Sat Mar 28 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"I'm even more excited for this movie now! Can't wait to see Waltz as the Bond villian!  I'm curious as to who the man in the 'farm/shack' was... I believe it was Mr. White, but I've been reading the Young Bond books and I could swear the whole scene reminds me of Hannes Oberhauser's home from the fifth book."
JamesBond,30js1h,fiestaoffire,4,Sat Mar 28 00:03:22 2015 UTC,"I suspect it was. Which is what leads Bond here to begin with.  Seeing the Oberhauser paperwork etc.   I haven't read the leaks, so all my speculation is just that and gatherings from the trailer.    I'm suspecting / hoping SPECTRE has used it as a safe house for White, probably a ploy to attract Bond as the Oberhauser clue would certainly lead him there.  Also- Id LOVE for them to touch on the color names used in the Craig run of films.  Perhaps the color coded names show branches of SPECTRE (also reaching to Quantum)? Mr White, Mr Green and even Silva would have been part!!  So excited for this!!!"
JamesBond,30js1h,RodKimble_Stuntman,2,Sat Mar 28 00:47:53 2015 UTC,I think the meeting that Bond mentions is the one at the end of the trailer.  He meets Mr White again after that scene.  And maybe even the voice over happens later in the film too.
JamesBond,30js1h,WhiteBoythatCantJump,10,Sat Mar 28 02:51:52 2015 UTC,"Looks like the leaked script is what they're going with.   Blofeld, played by Waltz, is going to be James Bond's half-brother. It's staggering that no one in the creative process raised their hand to say this was a really, really bad idea. Skyfall already dealt with Bond's past well enough, and this plot direction will mean Bond is moving away from his roots and more towards being a character who's past is integral to the universe, as opposed to towards his cool, mysterious spy roots as was indicated at the end of Skyall. Additionally, this sets up Spectre to be a direct sequel to Skyall, which is nonsensical given how well Skyfall set us up for a more traditional, stand-alone Bond film with M and Q and Moneypenny back in the game."
JamesBond,30js1h,Darkimus-prime,3,Sat Mar 28 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"Just curious: From the perspective of someone who hasn't read the script, what from this trailer leads you to believe that is the version they're using? It's been changed numerous times."
JamesBond,30js1h,Aurailious,7,Sat Mar 28 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"The things from the trailer which are more or less from the leaked script:   MI6 still in shambles The burnt photograph from James' past suggesting a certain familial relation that's important to the plot James pouring over something from his past which will likely be one of the central themes of the movie  The return of Mr. White from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace to warn of the film's great threat The implication that Monica Bellucci's character is a source of information on the film's great threat The Waltz character being at the head of a certain table.    I'm trying to be careful because I don't want to spoil anything. The script is still on the internet, if you do choose to read it. Personally, I'd suggest against it. Scripts in and of themselves are dry, and this particular script had some pretty major issues, imho."
JamesBond,30js1h,cnet14,5,Sat Mar 28 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I think Spectre should have been the Craig film that wasn't linked to the prior ones, and I think the orphan plot is ridiculous.  This movie will not follow the 007 formula that was basically defined with Goldfinger; it's trying to be more of a thrill-seeker movie. It could turn out well and define a new formula, or it could be a flop.  Based on the leaked Sony exec emails and the portions of the script that I've read, I would put my money on the latter, but let's hope that's wrong. Eon has a fantastic creative team, so I'm hoping they can make it work.  Then again, they gave us Quantum of Solace."
JamesBond,30js1h,fiestaoffire,4,Sat Mar 28 01:10:29 2015 UTC,Quantum was also made in the midst of the writer's strike and by a shitty director. I don't think Spectre will have either of those problems...
JamesBond,30js1h,ononothimagen,2,Sat Mar 28 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"I dunno, didn't Sam Mendes say he was out of ideas for any Bond movies until he was given a much bigger sum of money to direct the next one or two films?"

JamesBond,30js1h,myfriendsdeleteme,6,Sat Mar 28 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know. To me, I liken the character relationships to be that of Bruce Wayne/Batman to Thomas Elliot/Hush.   I feel this is also a good juxtaposition based on how Skyfall borrowed some elements from The Dark Knight. I'm not saying these are bad things - just that this is how my brain processed that idea.  Personally, I'm OK with part of what is your spoiler text, but I also hope before end of production they change a few things for the better."
JamesBond,30js1h,ZiggyPalffyLA,3,Sat Mar 28 17:12:04 2015 UTC,The Blofeld/Bond dynamic is much more akin to the iconic Batman/Joker dynamic than it is to Batman/Hush. The move to make Blofeld and Bond essentially brothers (assuming that's what's happening) is more like shoehorning Joker into being Bruce's sometimes-canonical brother Thomas than it is creating an entirely new villain (Hush) with some newly created history with the protagonist (Batman).
JamesBond,30js1h,broadfuckingcity,2,Sun Mar 29 09:52:17 2015 UTC,Not sure about Oberhauser being Bond's half-brother. I think he's going to be more of a foster brother.

JamesBond,30js1h,andre3snacks,2,Sat Mar 28 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have (and a first world problem, at that) is how spoiled I am becoming with the Craig era.  Don't get me wrong. I love all of them for different reasons. And I perfectly understand how Bond changes throughout the years in order to reflect the world at the time, but...  Craig's films are just so well made and cohesive, both visually and thematically. I am not even sure how the producers will be able to surpass themselves with whatever direction for the franchise they choose after Craig.  And to be brutally honest, I just don't want to see another CG tsunami."

First, because it's been done too many times in modern media (2008-now, so many movies focus on a character's inner turmoil) Secondly, because having Bond supposedly stay with a ski instructor for most of his childhood (after his parent's death) clashes with the movie canon (not book canon, I must acknowledge)  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OtaQbXfrdNA (read: 'MI-6 figured I was too young to remember', relate how Bond and Alex were lifelong friends in MI-6, how the same thing was most likely done for Bond) I know I seem like a sour old lemon, but despite my general hype for the movie, these two things are really bothering me.

JamesBond,30js1h,Bulk70,-5,Sat Mar 28 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Question on that form. It clearly states that he is 12 when the court gave guardianship of him to Charmain. But in the left of the picture, next to his thumb, is a word I can't make out next to a word that looks like ""begins"" and then the date 21/01/1985. Doing the math, are they saying that Bond is 42 in this movie?  If so, a question. I always thought Bond was supposed to be timeless. And I don't think the movies at least have every addressed his age. Why ruin that vision now?  EDIT: Wow. Gotta love how everyone takes the sarcasm as gospel. Maybe I should clarify. When EON was starting production on OHMSS the question came up about how to deal with the fact that Bond looked so different now then in You Only Live Twice. They floated the idea of saying that Bond had facial reconstruction surgery to throw Spectre of his tail, but Broccoli vetoed that. Broccoli's quote was something to the extent of ""This is the same character just played by another person and the audience will accept it."" Later (I think around the Dalton era, but I honestly can't remember) the issue was brought up about why Bond really wasn't ageing. Again Broccoli's idea was ""Bond is a timeless character and the audience will just accept that.""   So to the best of my knowledge, all of the movies have that vision of a single, timeless character. So why ditch that now?"

JamesBond,30mlq3,jamedudijench,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"But here's the question. Why does Bond need an origin story? The mystery of the character is what has been great for all these years.  I maybe would've bought what that guy is spewing had Henry Cavill landed the role. He's young, fresh and inexperienced and learning to be 'Bond'. This mofo not only looks old but they keep pointing it out in the movies over and over again. So Bond: Begins my ass."
JamesBond,30mlq3,RF20Lennon,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that it's an origin story is more in line with the fact that Casino Royale is the first Bond book, they needed something different. EON never originally had the rights to the story so who's to say how different the film franchise would have been. Maybe it too would have been an origin story. But I think the point about Bond being old and tired is a character trait. Originally he's a war vet. He's not a young, scrappy fellow. He's a blunt tool and gets used as such. But I think the reboot breathed a breath of fresh air into the movies. And I think Skyfall is the only movie that alludes to Bond's age."

Perhaps something happens like Waltz being behind Bond's parent's deaths so Bond joins MI6 as means of revenge? I don't know, it's all crazy, wild, improvised speculation like I said."

They really have nothing to lose from maintaining this in the Craig's Bond story arc and I'm so absolutely glad it's going to feature in it."
JamesBond,30j01t,Gilatar,7,Sun Mar 29 16:28:11 2015 UTC,Wait guys..I think I've got it..first of all let's stop with the Waltz is Blofeld theory..it might not be true and this is just speculation..I hope it won't be true..now to the part I wanted to say:  If you pause at the part when Bond is holding the picture and the document you can see that he is adopted (or something like that) by H.Obenhauser. H.Obenhause in the novel Octopussy is his ski instructor and sort of a father figure....  Waltz's character is named Franz Obenhauser...so I think it's safe to say the other kid on that picture is Waltz's character.  How is this all related to the organization SPECTRE and is Waltz part of it we will find out in November ! :)
JamesBond,30j01t,Real-Terminal,1 point,Sat Mar 28 04:45:45 2015 UTC,Isn't that Christopher Waltz sitting at the Spectre table at the end of the teaser?

JamesBond,30j01t,blueballs4ever,6,Fri Mar 27 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"White seems like he had a hard time after QoS. Was it his funeral after the scene in the cabin? Has SPECTRE taken over Quantum? What is Bond's dark secret, and is that Blofeld in the burnt picture?  So many questions!"
JamesBond,30j01t,Gilatar,5,Fri Mar 27 23:51:40 2015 UTC,I reckon Quantum will be a subset of SPECTRE.
JamesBond,30j01t,jwpar1701,3,Sat Mar 28 03:47:39 2015 UTC,Those SPECTRE rings have really slimmed down for bikini season.
JamesBond,30j01t,stanleyjub,5,Sat Mar 28 04:41:48 2015 UTC,wow the colours and the tone of this film look amazing. Can't wait.
JamesBond,30j01t,Gilatar,7,Sat Mar 28 00:24:40 2015 UTC,Looks like another Skyfall in terms of cinematography. Hoyte van Hoytema will certainly deliver.

JamesBond,30j01t,Smileyjoe72,3,Fri Mar 27 23:50:11 2015 UTC,That was extremely satisfying
JamesBond,30j01t,Fenderboy771,2,Fri Mar 27 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it won't just be a still frame with a voice-over. I expect it to be short, but I'm hoping to see some action.  Belated edit: No action needed. Best teaser trailer ever."
JamesBond,30j01t,BlueInq,5,Fri Mar 27 23:38:25 2015 UTC,"I would accept a voiceover from, say, Christoph Waltz (saying something appropriately villainous) but if it's just Bond saying a Bondism that would be slightly disappointing. Beggars can't be choosers, though."
JamesBond,30j01t,lackssyntax,11,Fri Mar 27 23:40:27 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, it was almost exactly like that, but better!  So I guess it's confirmed now? Waltz is Blofeld as the head of SPECTRE. That room at the end seemed a lot like the classic SPECTRE meeting room, for sure."
JamesBond,30j01t,walbeerus,2,Fri Mar 27 23:48:40 2015 UTC,Well I'm excited

JamesBond,30j01t,agentjamesbond007,2,Sat Mar 28 11:56:24 2015 UTC,"I too am excited to experience the newest Bond outing like everyone else! But my intense admiration for the franchise causes me to have hopefully unfounded concerns.   I am done with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade writing these movies. While I very much enjoyed their collaboration with Paul Haggis for the Casino Royale script most of the rest of their writing holds their respective films back. I believe the most negative things you can say about QoS and Skyfall center on the writing. Ironically I believe what is becoming a desired change for fans is a move away from exploring the back story of James Bond's history before MI6 much like the films of old. While the older films often explored his history it was never the focus of the plot. I love James Bond because he is a secret agent not Bruce Wayne. Seeing the focus on his childhood gave me flashbacks to all those scenes at his childhood home in Skyfall that I have spent considerable time excising from my memory. We need some fresh writing blood as Purvis and Wade seem to be circling the same themes.  Speaking of Bruce Wayne brings up my second concern. We live in the Post-The Dark Knight world where many movies look and feel like Christopher Nolan films. The cinematography on display through this trailer by Hoyte Van Hoytema looks like it will be drowned in muted grays and blacks contrasted by shadows much like every other ""serious"" action film of the past few years. Skyfall was undoubtedly beautifully shot but is undercut by it's similarity to other films. I would argue that an immaculately reproduced copy has less merit than an experimental endeavor.   I am hopeful that the films positives outweigh the negatives and that we get another great film that is successful enough to warrant to continuation to the franchise. My major concern is that if we continue to see this homogenization where Bond movies further resemble superhero action movies the casual viewer will not feel James Bond is unique enough to bother watching if it goes up against a big Marvel or DC movie in the future."
JamesBond,30j01t,gangmember17,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all points. James Bond, really since the rebirth in 1995 with GOLDENEYE, has followed other trends more than it has led trends.   The Craig era has given us very good films and I have high hopes for this one, but I can't help but notice the heavy reliance on the Bourne series and The Dark Knight trilogy for inspiration. While I can't fault them for finding a way to make a very old character relevant again, it's a little frustrating that they can't seem to find their own way entirely of doing it.   I hope that they eventually can move away from the ""James Bond begins"" storyline and back to us seeing Bond in medias res.   I don't know how much Purvis and Wade have to do with it though. I think Haggis and the other writers might be equally to blame.   ANYWAY - this teaser does look very good and a nice continuation of the theme they started. I love the return of spectre!"

If so begs the Q as to why Mr. White is there unless he might be some reference to the British officer.

JamesBond,30k308,notexactlyclever,4,Sat Mar 28 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"So This picture is a screenshot from the trailer and I've noticed a few things.   First and foremost, there are specific dates on this paperwork. On the right hand side of the page it says ""at or about: 12 noon"" which I'm assuming is when the paperwork was signed. The date next to that is 21/1/85 (possibly 83?).  It also says that James Master Bond is 12 years old, meaning that if we assume this takes place in the present, then bond is 42. Oberhauser is named as the temporary guardian who was watching over 007 and is now giving up guardianship to Bond's relative."
JamesBond,30k308,athzar,2,Sat Mar 28 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"42...7x6! Because 007 and ... yeah, I got nothing :)"

JamesBond,30k308,arafinwe,2,Sat Mar 28 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"Great catch! That means Bond was born in 1973 (not 1968), so he is younger than Craig, which I always thought he should be."
JamesBond,30jvuw,agentjamesbond007,12,Sat Mar 28 00:21:01 2015 UTC,Maybe it's one of those headphones that people listen to translator like they have at the UN and stuff? It was a large meeting room. Maybe it was a bad guy meeting and some of them speak different languages and need a translation.
JamesBond,30jvuw,BradInBlack,-1,Sat Mar 28 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"That is actually a very insightful comment. Thank you! It would completely make sense since SPECTRE is an international organization (like the UN).  Pertaining to the movie, I really hope foreign languages would not be included in any meeting scenes to an extent that it would require subtitles. That would detract from the movie and a Bond franchise first if I am not mistaken."
JamesBond,30jvuw,broadfuckingcity,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:57:32 2015 UTC,Right off the top of my head there is Bond speaking Russian in TWINE and many other instances of non-English languages being spoken in the series.
JamesBond,30jvuw,jamedudijench,-1,Sat Mar 28 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yes! You are completely correct! Those moments slipped my mind. Now that I am thinking about it, there are several subtitle moments.

JamesBond,30k40u,dragonsky,2,Sat Mar 28 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"Hi AsinQ. Like agentjamesbond007 had previously mentioned--there are a high number of replicas within the market, so do in fact be careful. Additionally, prices will be higher at this time as the news of a new Bond film has just been released; therefore, please do take that into consideration when making a purchase--do not pay overly excessive amounts for something out of desperation; be patient. Your best time to buy is usually after the movie leaves the box office and becomes available on DVD/Blu-ray. Prices are generally lower at this time as the hype dies down. What I would recommend to you is (if you are looking to invest), rather than buy merchandise or memorabilia, try and find copies of the original first edition books. With copies becoming rarer and rarer these days as the books are usually stored either incorrectly or are become lost or damaged, they are becoming more valuable. True Bond lovers want these because they are as close as you can get to the legacy of Ian Fleming's James Bond. Personally, that is what I have done and I couldn't have been happier. I've added a picture of my collection here. Best of luck."

And kind of Craig's movies are supposed to show Bond before Connery years (don't try to find too much continuation in the franchise), so IF Blofeld appears in SPECTRE it would be the first meeting between Bond and Blofeld.  And we can't be sure about the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. neither, but it goes same as above, this should be the beginning of the Bond/SPECTRE and Bond's first meeting with SPECTRE (again, don't look for too much continuity in the franchise :D )  edit: But again we will all find out more once the movie comes out :)"

JamesBond,30kgjw,akanefive,2,Sat Mar 28 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"I think we're getting a bait and switch, like Star Trek Into Darkness. It actually makes a lot more sense for this film than it did for Star Trek - Blofeld was always mysterious, and this is a nod to that.   Wild speculation about the backstory: Waltz is the adopted son of Olberhauser, who was a foster parent or something similar to Bond. Waltz's character's given name? Blofeld."
JamesBond,30kgjw,jamedudijench,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:08:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.... yeah, I can see it going down that way. I mean, wouldn't you be aching to use an intellectual property that's been off limits legally for the greater part of 4 decades or something? Haha."
JamesBond,30kgjw,akanefive,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:16:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It would be foolish for them not to use him. And even though we all seem to know its Blofeld, I like that they're giving us a nod to the past with the misdirection. We didn't see what Blofeld looked like for 2 and a half films back in the day. So I'm all for this direction."

JamesBond,30fr10,TouchMyTooter,4,Fri Mar 27 00:18:26 2015 UTC,Well you have to imagine the movie would have been slightly different if it was Connery. Yeah if you take that exact movie and plug in Connery it wouldn't work but with some minor tweaks it would have been a much better movie.
JamesBond,30fr10,adventcrash,3,Fri Mar 27 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"I agree and I love Connery too. But , like him or hate him, Lazenby was perfect for the tone of OHMSS."
JamesBond,30fr10,sigersen,3,Fri Mar 27 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by tone and style? If you mean that OHMSS was more 'realistic' than some of the other films, so was From Russia With Love."
JamesBond,30fr10,kristopherm3,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:07:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with you - it's a different film entirely with Connery. Lazenby doesn't give the strongest performance in this movie, but he fits the film so well, and I don't think Connery would work as well. Besides, there is a reason he quit after You Only Live Twice. He was really sick of the franchise, and his performance suffered because of it. It wouldn't serve the story to have the lead sleepwalk through OHMSS."

JamesBond,30fr10,kristopherm3,3,Fri Mar 27 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, Diana Rigg was one of the best Bond girls, certainly the most real. She had a personality and wasn't just glorified set dressing."
JamesBond,30fr10,joosh82,2,Fri Mar 27 08:11:25 2015 UTC,While she was certainly more active in OHMSS I feel like they could have done a lot more with her role. (Or maybe her scenes feel small compared to the bloated chase sequences and too much time at the allergy facility.)
JamesBond,30fr10,kristopherm3,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:22:30 2015 UTC,I do think it was odd that they decided to include Bond's usual 'side-shags'. It felt out of place in a film about Bond falling in love.

The only episode i felt really cheated on was Goldfinger. And not because there was differing opinions, it's far from being my favorite Bond movie, but there was pure hatred. Just unbridled ripping to shreds, and that's not what I wanna listen to. Like, we get it, you're progressive and modern, now shut up and talk about the other aspects of the movie! More Greg Proops and Paul F. Tompkins types, people that can hold their own. In fact, I'd love Amanda and Maria again."
JamesBond,309nc1,akanefive,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, I feel the opposite. I LOVED the Goldfinger episode! The two guests provided such a different PoV from Matt & Matt.

JamesBond,309nc1,akanefive,3,Thu Mar 26 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not on the Goldfinger bandwagon. I agree there. I've said many times on here that it's the ""stuff"" that people like it for, not because it's the strongest movie. ""Oh it debuted the DB5 it must be the holy grail of Bond movies!"" Pfft, please.   I would have been fine with dissent if it was along the lines of: ""this movie is not quite what you think it is or remember it as"" and on its own merits, a la the Thunderball episode, not the guest but I remember Gourley especially being pretty critical of it, and not ""IF YOU LIKE JAMES BOND YOU HATE WOMEN."" It was kind of insulting, as a man who obviously sees women as equals. I like Westerns too, does that mean I'm for Native American genocide? Of course not! I just hate how everything has to be a social issue now. I'm listening to an entertainment podcast, not trying to be educated on gender inequality."

I didn't have a problem at all with the Goldfinger episode. Goldfinger is an entertaining movie, but it also included a pseudo-rape as a plot point, or so badly screwed up the filming of one scene that it appears to be a pseudo-rape. It would be far worse not to dissect that element in a podcast about the movie. I totally understand two people with zero exposure to the series not enjoying the movie on the basis of the way it treats female characters."

JamesBond,3091dr,mcuv,5,Wed Mar 25 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're getting at. In Skyfall, the DB5 was destroyed so the ""bringing back"" was ultimately short-lived. Besides, Goldeneye and Casino Royale brought back the DB5 before Skyfall. As for the characters you mentioned, they're kind of Bond staples. They never left the series. What you've got to remember is Casino Royale was a reboot. It effectively set up and introduced characters in a way never seen before. In a series where James Bond was just always James Bond, we now see, or at least have context to, why he is who he is. The same can be said about the supporting characters. The boxes were always checked. The current state of the franchise is just doing them a little differently. All you have to do is watch a Moore or Brosnan movie to see that the series has been a caricature of itself before. It does that from time to time. If that's what you're talking about well then that is understandable. Bond films arc in that very manner and have since the beginning. Serious then silly, then serious again and then back to silly. But the box-ticking? I don't know, those characters were spawned from literary works and the film tropes are an established aesthetic to the movies. They exist as pillars of the franchise. People expect to see those things."
JamesBond,3091dr,jamedudijench,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"I love the classics, but unless we're doing period appropriate movies, I don't like re-using the old Bond classics like the PPK and the DB5. It's ridiculous that a secret agent in 2015 would use an outdated sidearm like the PPK. I have one, and I love it, but it's not something a modern day agent would use. Bond would probably have something polymer and with a higher magazine capacity and a higher caliber. 7.65 mm is a .32 ACP which is not considered an appropriate defensive round. I have to believe that Bond would at least have a .380 if not a 9mm.   Same thing with the car. The DB5 is awesome, but it's not exactly inconspicuous. At least the BMWs from the Brosnan era blend in. It's not like they're 200,000 dollar cars."
JamesBond,3091dr,skinsfan55,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"I liked the updated P99 but even as a spy weapon that seems to have its drawbacks as a real world pistol. There's some kind of jamming issue or something? I don't know. But anyway, see that's the thing. How do you find a replacement for the PPK that satisfies everyone? The way I see it is he's a guy that's as deadly or more so with an obsolete pistol than a highly trained assassin with the latest, high tech pistol around. It plays to his danger factor.   And even the cars. I think people like the fact that he drives super expensive cars. Sure a cheaper car is more practical but he wants the Aston Martin. He's James Bond. That was sort of the intent of the series. They're supposed to be globetrotting, extravagant, visceral fantasies. It's why Fleming wrote the books. And why Cubby Broccoli wanted to realize this vision in film. Otherwise you have Jason Bourne in a suit. People want and expect the outlandish and impractical. I do. I just can not bring myself to say Bond in a BMW sedan with a glock or something is better/cooler than Bond in an Aston Martin with a PPK."
JamesBond,3091dr,jamedudijench,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I completely agree with you. Casino Royale happened because the franchise had become pastiche, a parody of itself. Casino Royale made Bond dark, serious and gritty, and it worked fantastically! Skyfall removed this, trading the realistic violence and occasional humour for slapstick violence and intrusive comedy. Yes, Quantum of Solace was a bad movie, but at least it was consistent with its tone. I felt that Skyfall existed to please the fans of the lighthearted Moore/Brosnan films. I just hope the franchise doesn't continue down this dangerous path, with the films becoming more and more silly until... BOOM! We're back into Moonraker/Die Another Day territory."

JamesBond,305jsj,adventcrash,3,Tue Mar 24 17:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm always curious as to what other people think about this movie. I find it a terrible rehashing of a far superior Bond (THUNDERBALL), and it's so campy that it makes Moore look like Craig. The lack of Broccoli is painfully obvious and Connery clearly didn't give two shits. Hell, he put more into ""Highlander"" than this film. That being said, Kim Basinger was the hottest Bond girl of the 80s."
JamesBond,305jsj,KngHrts2,2,Tue Mar 24 20:42:25 2015 UTC,Well I can't agree with you but I respect the opinion. I know I have the unpopular opinion but I just found Thunderball painfully boring but enjoyed this one so much more. I'm curious if you have watched either of them recently? I came to all of these for my first time this year and didn't have any nostalgia for them. Curious to know if you have given them rewatches and if your opinion ever changed?
JamesBond,305jsj,dibsODDJOB,3,Tue Mar 24 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"I think you nailed it with Thunderball's problem. Too many long, drawn out underwater scenes, and the entire movie could have used some better editing to cut out a lot of the chaff. Shame, because it had some great elements, including the fantastic Fiona Volpe."
JamesBond,305jsj,ILendMyAxeToAll,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:49:04 2015 UTC,I think in my review of Thunderball I echoed the fact that editing could have made a great movie. Thanks for reading!
JamesBond,305jsj,sigersen,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:53:59 2015 UTC,It was a rehash. A rights issue lead to Kevin McLory(i think) having rights for the story of Thunderball and only that. So he remade it
JamesBond,305jsj,meatspun,4,Wed Mar 25 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"I have always thought Thunderball was a snore. I love NSNA too. I don't think Connery was phoning his part in at all. Not compared to YOLT. He plays a weary and delighfully crotchety Bond in this film and ,as you remarked, the whole cast is great. I just want to say that, while I don't always agree with you, I find your reviews refreshing. That's why I never give my opinion of the next flim up, until you have seen it."
JamesBond,304y24,GetFreeCash,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:58:13 2015 UTC,The part the host (Devin) brings up about it being parts of different movies I agree with. It doesn't make the film bad but it's something I sort of noticed. And Matt saying how this film sets up the character in a way that was unprecedented which makes it better is really a strong argument. I never really gave CR credit for that before.

JamesBond,3012op,GetFreeCash,7,Mon Mar 23 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"I think it would still be something trying to emulate the Bourne franchise. Maybe like a pre-QoS Quantum of Solace-type plot involving oil and geopolitical disputes. More cold and less jokey and gadgety. Maybe a heist at some point? Seeing as how they went for a more loyal novel adaptation I would say they went there. If not Casino Royale, I don't know what would be left to do. Come to think of it, a non-Fleming title I suppose. Or better yet, instead of oil, a virus, and they do The Man with the Red Tattoo. I could really see them doing that given the time period. People worried about chemical warfare and bioterrorism and such, if memory serves me. Considering it would have been released maybe 2004-ish, that would be my ultimate guess. I'm sure they'd bring Jinx back in some capacity."
JamesBond,3012op,jamedudijench,7,Mon Mar 23 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"It would've had to have been what For Your Eyes Only was to Moonraker. As much as I love CR, if there had been room to squeeze in a final Pierce in 2004 without eroding Casino Royale, I would have loved to have seen it."

JamesBond,3012op,sourdsmokin,4,Mon Mar 23 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"I think after 9/11, the producers were going to treat the subject matter in a more serious way, regardless of the actor. I'd have loved to see Pierce sneak one more in (around 2004), that dealt with Bond as an aging spy - a one last job type film - before turning it over to Craig."
JamesBond,3012op,akanefive,4,Mon Mar 23 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"DAD was after 9/11, though"
JamesBond,3012op,jb4427,9,Mon Mar 23 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"Much of the work on the film had been done prior to 9/11, IIRC. Michael G. Wilson talks about this in the documentary that came out in 2012. 9/11 and the War on Terror shook their equilibrium."
JamesBond,3012op,akanefive,6,Mon Mar 23 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"Pierce definitely deserved at least one more film. 9/11 or not, because Die Another Day was so Over-The -Top I'm sure they would have made a more grounded serious film. It would have been a tone change similar to FYEO after Moonraker. Brosnan can do light or gritty Bond. Whatever they decided, he would have been great."
JamesBond,3012op,sigersen,9,Mon Mar 23 19:35:54 2015 UTC,Everything or Nothing is legitimately better than Die Another Day.

JamesBond,3012op,jamedudijench,4,Mon Mar 23 19:44:42 2015 UTC,He and Bret Ratner we're already in talks to direct the next film - until the rights to Casino Royale reverted back to EON.

JamesBond,3012op,WhiteBoythatCantJump,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:03:18 2015 UTC,Something like OHMSS and FYEO which followed huge OTT Bond films. Something which re-establishes the character in reality. I think after Bourne made a lot of money only 6 months prior to the release to DAD they would of had to consider that people wanted to see a much more serious or realistic spy film which is what we got with CR.
JamesBond,3012op,AirJordanFan93,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:32:35 2015 UTC,It seems like every time they go too far in the ridiculous they pull it back and just try to do From Russia With Love again. So Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in From Russia With Love but with a different title and slightly different plot points.
JamesBond,3012op,adventcrash,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, they were going to do Casino Royale after Die Another Day regardless, and odds are it would have been pretty similar to the one with Craig in tone given the success of Bourne and 9/11.

JamesBond,2zycgr,adventcrash,3,Sun Mar 22 23:20:20 2015 UTC,They make a nod to the short story by the same name is a conversation in the film.  Maud Adams thanks 007 for allowing her father to commit suicide before being brought back for a trial over a past crime. I didn't appreciate that dialogue until I read the book.
JamesBond,2zycgr,Clancy_B_Shanty,5,Mon Mar 23 01:42:18 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is how this film is rated lower (by 11 percentage points) on Rotten Tomatoes than Moonraker. And overall, it's the second to worst rated official EON Bond film critically on the site. A View to a Kill is the worst. Die Another Day is critically rated higher than Octopussy. Just let that sentence sink in for a second. And even still, the users have it at third to worst, with Moonraker next, and DAD and AVTAK tied for worst rated. I don't know if I agree with it's place critically."
JamesBond,2zycgr,jamedudijench,3,Mon Mar 23 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"Die Another Day is not only the worst Bond movie but easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen just on a disappointment level. Honestly Octopussy was really fun and enjoyable which is more than I can say for other Roger Moore Bond films. The Man With the Golden Gun has some great ideas but is in no way a great film and I would rank it below this one. Moonraker is EASILY worse than this but I feel people rank that higher as one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies."
JamesBond,2zycgr,jamedudijench,2,Mon Mar 23 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's certainly some unfairness surrounding Octopussy's critique. And it totally predated the Temple of Doom dinner scene hahaha needs some points for that."
JamesBond,2zycgr,WolvoMS,2,Mon Mar 23 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"Especially with older movies, the older they get, the more skewed the ratings since they have less reviews to go by. So usually a badly received movie will be lower rated now than it should be, and a well received movie will be rated higher now"
JamesBond,2zycgr,jamedudijench,2,Mon Mar 23 15:01:01 2015 UTC,"That's why I like Rotten Tomatoes, the movies that time becomes kind to can eventually get their fair shot, like OHMSS as it's one of the higher rated films now."
JamesBond,2zycgr,akanefive,3,Mon Mar 23 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"Octopussy is a victim of it's own title. It's a terrible title for a pretty good movie. I rank it among the stronger Moore films. I think it does a nice job balancing the spy stuff, the campy humor, and the travelogue element that the films of this era all strived for."
JamesBond,2zycgr,pinkpanthers,0,Mon Mar 23 02:34:32 2015 UTC,Yeah this movie had a lot of decent spy moments compared to the last few Moore films that allow it to overshadow the more campy aspects.
JamesBond,2zycgr,akanefive,2,Mon Mar 23 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"For Your Eyes Only was before Octopussy, and I thought it was an excellent spy movie."
JamesBond,2zycgr,akanefive,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"To me For Your Eyes Only was good but just boring because it was such a carbon copy of previous Bond films, even more so than just following the Bond formula. It was just the same plot as From Russia With Love but I watched it in a marathon. I feel like if I saw it on it's own after some time I would like it a lot more."
JamesBond,2zycgr,akanefive,2,Mon Mar 23 15:25:36 2015 UTC,"I actually think For Your Eyes Only was a really bold film, considering how successful Moonraker was with audiences. The fact that the producers said, ""Yeah, we made a lot of money, but we made a crappy movie,"" is a testament to their forward thinking.  FYEO is similar to From Russia With Love in a lot of ways, but it's also full of interesting characters, cool locations, and really fun set pieces. Octopussy crept back toward Moonraker on the ridiculousness scale, but it's still grounded in a decent amount of reality. Ultimately, I think the first two 80's films work, but for different reasons."
JamesBond,2zycgr,akanefive,2,Mon Mar 23 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the fact that the movie was a bold choice. They would never have made that same decision in 2015, we would have had Bond in space forever because, hey it made money. I just feel like if you are going to try and emulate one of the best Bond films then the execution should be better and the script should have been mixed up a little more. Like I said before I feel this is a film I would have enjoyed a lot more if I randomly came to it one day instead of watching it in line of a marathon where I've seen it all before. There were some great moments in that movie but overall just felt a little too recycled during my first watch. I did love some of the characters but there were some I couldn't stand. Bibi being a main factor mostly because her acting was terrible and she contributed nothing to the plot."
JamesBond,2zycgr,sigersen,2,Mon Mar 23 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bibi is some of the worst acting in the series - which is no small feat - and a completely unnecessary addition to the film. She doesn't advance the plot in any way. I wonder if there was a reason to include her that some of the Bond historians that frequent the sub might know about."

JamesBond,2zv5ij,Sir_Duke94,12,Sun Mar 22 04:11:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say for me it's OHMSS. When I was younger I wouldn't watch this if it was on TV, same for the Dalton films, would only Connery, Moore or (later on) Brosnan. Shame cause aside from Lazenby it's one of the best.

JamesBond,2zv5ij,guidotheguido,3,Mon Mar 23 00:06:53 2015 UTC,For me it's definitely OHMSS. The first time I watched it on TV as a kid I hated it even though it had Diana Rigg in it.

JamesBond,2zv5ij,sigersen,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:00:52 2015 UTC,It was all but shunned by the filmmakers after release. It was like a mistake they spent the entire decade of the 70s trying to undo.

JamesBond,2zv5ij,waynerooney501,0,Thu Mar 26 04:36:54 2015 UTC,Casino Royale. Used to love it now i think its dull and boring
JamesBond,2zv5ij,ILendMyAxeToAll,3,Sun Mar 22 10:48:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that's understandable.  It was so refreshing when it came out that a lot of positivity around it was probably inflated.  Still a great movie IMO though
JamesBond,2zv5ij,berad90,3,Sun Mar 22 13:44:04 2015 UTC,"I just prefer the ""campy"" bonds. I think Casino Royale is a better film that alot of them, but not a bettet bond film. If that makes sense.  Skyfall sorted that out though"
JamesBond,2zv5ij,ILendMyAxeToAll,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:33:23 2015 UTC,"Goldeneye  Loved it a few years ago. Now after the Craig films, I find the writing lazy and convenient. It seems like each line of dialogue is a set up for an one liner. I mean, how realistic is that Zurkovsky can shoot at Bond at such close proximity without any risk to him? Oh, the girl who likes to squeeze people to death.....JUST SO HAPPENS she gets squeezed to death. I don't know, it's still Bronson's best Bond film, with TWINE as a very close second. Thinking back on the Bronson films just makes me feel sorry for him. The Craig films are so good, even the ""mediocre"" one. Considering how good he was portraying the character, Pierce Bronson's Bond seems like a wasted opportunity for everyone involved, most importantly the fans."
JamesBond,2zv5ij,mydarkmeatrises,0,Mon Mar 23 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"Goldeneye. It was MY Bond film once upon a time. I excitedly showed it to my wife a year or two ago, telling her at the time how it was one of the best. It wasn't just disappointing that it wasn't as good as I'd remembered; it was even particularly great to show someone who wasn't committed to the series already. I still love it, but it's not the masterpiece I remember."

JamesBond,2zlkp1,thedeevolution,12,Thu Mar 19 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're right that QoS gets more hate than it deserves. It certainly isn't even close to the level of awful that is Die Another Day.   The problem with QoS was it just didn't feel like a Bond film to me in the movie theater. I honestly haven't watched (or had any desire to watch) it since I saw it in theaters. I just remember leaving and reflecting on the fact that there wasn't much that differentiated it from a lot of other movies (at that time the Bourne movies were fresh). It seemed to lose that bond magic. Whereas in skyfall my heart skipped a beat when he unveiled the classic Aston Martin or when he met Q. It's an unquantifiable trait and is probably tied more to nostalgia.   I'm sure it is better than I remember but I just didn't find anything about it compelling. The villain's motivation in skyfall may have been done before but I just found him to be interesting to watch. Also I found the Bond girl to be particularly forgettable in QoS (especially after Casino Royale).   My guess is a lot of the hate comes from the fact that it was following up Casino Royale. I remember getting really psyched for QoS and so I think expectations were super high. It was sort of like comparing TDK to TDKR. If QoS is one of your favorites then be proud and screw the haters. That's the beauty of Bond. Everybody has their favorites.   Oh one other thing, the opening song for QoS was unbearable. It might take the cake for my least favorite opening bond song."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,stanleyp2011,3,Thu Mar 19 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"I personally like Die Another Day more than QoS. But you're probably right about the hype that followed Casino Royale. The bar was high for QoS, but because of QoS the bar was low for Skyfall to succeed."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,InsanityIsTrueSanity,1 point,Thu Mar 19 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"It's nowhere near as bad as the Madonna song, but yeah there's definitely something just...off about it. Everything else you say I can at least completely see where you're coming from. I say give it another watch if you get a chance, it's definitely a Bond movie that I've heard fans come around on with more watches, but it's also completely reasonable if you still don't like it.   Also, Skyfall DEFINITELY has stuff I absolutely adore, I don't want to sound like a negative nancy. The villian is AWESOME, and very Bond-y. It also has one of my favorite moments from any of the films, that's not wholly original, but perfect Bond. When he jumps onto the train after ripping it open with the crane and he has the little moment of adjusting his cuffs. Goddam, that gets me every time."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,DrinkinMcGee,18,Thu Mar 19 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to offer a counter-view to most of the respondents here and see where that takes us.    Quantum of Solace was horrendous and Skyfall is one of the best Bond films in years.    Daniel Craig is very frank about the problems with the script for QoS, which was kneecapped due to the writers strike.  He and the Director openly admit that the movie suffered because of it and that the story didn't develop the way they had originally envisioned it.  Beyond the failings of the story, the movie was painfully heavy on product placement, had a tone deaf ecological plot that seemed exceedingly forced (even for a Bond film), and misused several Bond tropes in a poorly executed attempt at fan service that came across as neither fan service or interesting.  The best element of the movie is the first 10 or 15 minutes and from there on out it's slow, uneven, unsure of itself and seems more like a half-baked sequel to Casino Royale than a fully developed Bond film on it's own.  To be clear, I don't mind that they connected to the Vespyr storyline but it felt so tacked on as to be almost an afterthought in a movie about an exploding hydrogen hotel and a cut-rate ecoterrorist.    Skyfall on the other hand was magnificent.  It had the perfect balance of Bond humor, gadgets, action, loss, redemption, wit, charm, character balance, fan service - frankly, it hit almost every note (more on this in a minute) perfectly.  I don't think it can be argued that the cinematography was spectacular and that they did a magnificent job on the location scouting, and the music and soundscape was superb.  The movie is everything I could hope for from a Bond film and a lot more than I expected from the current set, especially after CR (which I felt was a good action movie but lacking as a Bond film overall) and QoS (see above, ugh).  Now, to be fair, Skyfall has its faults.  It's a bit overlong, the Home Alone segment at the end is a little trite, the villain doesn't work especially well (he would've worked better/more sympathetic if they had somehow given him a bit more back story, maybe flashback style or as the prologue before the credits) but even with these faults in mind, I feel it holds together better and gets the Bond job done better, than any other Daniel Craig film and I'd say any Bond since perhaps Tomorrow Never Dies.    Well, that's my 2c - happy to see what you guys think while I make myself a drink. Or 7."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,pick-a-spot,3,Thu Mar 19 20:17:43 2015 UTC,"i'm going to counter your counter...   Daniel Craig is very frank about the problems with the script for QoS   This means nothing.It wasn't well received so it's logical to distance yourself from it.    the movie was painfully heavy on product placement   I would argue casino royale and skyfall are worse  They would literally stop the film and take a time out to show it; http://www.typhone.nl/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/skyfall_gsm1.jpg  and http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=1362&d=1354076557  not to forget;  m:what was that  moneypenny: VW beatles!  me: cringe   a tone deaf ecological plot that seemed exceedingly forced   Doesn't sound much better then a cliché hacking plot, which the rules of aren't defined and everything and anything can be hacked at any time   Vespyr storyline but it felt so tacked   tacked on? that's the whole point of the movie. It's a revenge plot. If anything the eco stuff was tacked on not vesper. I do think they didn't do enough to remind us why Bond is hurting, they made one quick comment at the interrogation and just quickly moved on....but then M did mention vesper/revenge again after Bond killed the first guy and then Mathus did again.    misused several Bond tropes in a poorly executed attempt at fan service   Are we forgetting the anachronism of the aston martin with ejector seat    skyfall had the perfect balance of Bond humor, gadgets, action, loss, redemption, wit, charm, character balance, fan service   humour.yes. gadgets? gadgets? are you kidding me. he got a gun and a lighter and shit on Goldeneye, arguably one of the best Bond movies. Either do gadgets properly, or don't do them at all."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Fri Mar 20 09:33:28 2015 UTC,"Excellent rebuttal. I couldn't have countered his counter better myself.  I will agree with DrinkinMcGee on one point though. As much as I love QoS. I still have a little trouble with the Hydrogen Hotel. That was pretty ridiculous. It did serve the plot more than being just a cool action set-piece, however. The fire caused Camile to break down due to the trauma she suffered as a child. Bond nearly put a bullet in her head to keep her from suffering from it a second time before he found a way to escape. It's a pretty powerful moment in the film. Although, I missed it upon first viewing, because I couldn't get over the fact that someone would build a hotel that could explode if someone backed their car into the wall."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,pick-a-spot,0,Fri Mar 20 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone always brings up that Daniel Craig and the director said they weren't happy with it. But you have to understand, Quantum of Solace did not garner the enthusiasm Casino Royale did. And now they're being interviewed with Skyfall coming next. It just wouldn't have been smart for people to say that Quantum was perfect because then people might have been less inclined to see Skyfall, expecting more of the same. He has also talked negatively about the Skyfall script, but probably to dissuade people who have beefs with it and to convince them Spectre will be different. Michael Bay and his writers said the exact same thing after every Transformers movie too, and there's little to no difference between the films. You say that to convince those who are skeptical fans, because the other fans are going to see it no matter what.  Besides that, I wouldn't argue too hard with any of your points, they're perfectly reasonable opinions to have even if we don't agree and I'm glad for your input. I LOVE Casino Royale, but I do think you have to be in the right mood, or it can seem a bit plodding. It's a great adaptation of the book type of Bond, but not everything from the books should be kept...like tons and tons of poker playing, haha.  I think one thing we can all agree on, we're all hella excited for Spectre! I think if they can combine the best elements from the previous Craig films and then kick it up a notch with more outrageous (but not too) Bond elements, we've got a winning combo on our hands. We'll see though...maybe they'll completely shit the bed, haha."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,DXPetti,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:19:37 2015 UTC,"You are right about then distancing themselves from quantum of solace. If the majority didn't like it.. They can't endorse it... It would make those same masses think skyfall is the same type of movie.   I personally think the writers strike and Craig's involvement in the script made the film better. It's not a bond film but a film about bond. And apparently 'writing his own lines' , I honestly think Daniel Craigs acting benefited from it. Every action, dialogue and expression of his on every scene was perfect.   I'm not excited about spectre. The same director and lead writer that he brought with him that made skyfall made a shit dark knight that didn't make sense , now I'm assuming it's going to be a shit django or something."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,kristopherm3,3,Fri Mar 20 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"The real shame about SKYFALL is that fall all the time that it leans on nostalgia (DB5, exploding pens etc..) many of the real diamonds such as the fight in Shanghai, Bond running to M/courthouse scene will be forgotten about. No doubt they were under such directive to lean heavily on the past due to the film coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Bond...  While Casino Royale is still my top Bond film (it helps having the emotional side of Bond explored as well as it being a reboot) and I too disagree with the hate QoS gets, SKYFALL is still the most spectacularly shot Bond film.  I just pray SPECTRE goes back to the grittiness of Casino Royale + QoS. It would be amazing to see this tone combined with the visual direction of SKYFALL"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,jamedudijench,3,Fri Mar 20 06:26:54 2015 UTC,"I loved Casino Royale, disliked Quantum of Solace, was disappointed with Skyfall. Skyfall sadly removed the grit and seriousness that Casino Royale established in favour of a more comedic 'classic' Bond."

JamesBond,2zlkp1,DiscipleOfDrone,5,Thu Mar 19 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"I think Skyfall won't age well at all.  I was baffled by the praise and the popularity it received. Yes, it's shot (too) beautifully. But that's the main draw.  The story, as you highlighted, indeed collapses very quickly. And yet it was off to a great start, but as soon as Bond arrives at Silva's island, presses a button, and the cavalry arrived, I almost chuckled out loud. Come on. Then, as you pointed out too, we get a byzantine second half of the story where everything was masterminded by Silva from the beginning, culminating in a desolate Scottish manor with an overwrought finale. Skyfall's plot simply didn't work for me.  Skyfall was also far too self-referential for its own good. It nodded so heavily towards the past without ever creating its own distinct, individual voice.  Now, for QoS, I like it. A lot. It's offbeat, mysterious, and an atypical Bond film. The opening for instance, starting with the abstract close-up flashes of car chrome and Craig's face: superb. And then it's a straight adrenaline rush.   QoS set pieces are also far, far better than SkyFall's:   The Bregenz Opera scene The Perla de las Dunas Hotel scene   The story too, is actually incredibly relevant. Ecoterrorism is such a bold idea. It's even conceivable that a fight over natural resources will become a catalyst for war and territorial expansion. Much more than a super-hacker who blows up M's HQ, then hacks MI6 from the inside after a deliberate capture."

JamesBond,2zlkp1,pick-a-spot,2,Fri Mar 20 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think QoS solace is that bad, I think it just followed the powerhouse that was Casino Royale.  Even if QoS was just as good as Casino Royale it wouldn't be viewed the same because it didn't improve upon the previous Bond movie."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,wildcard6270,2,Fri Mar 20 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"I think /u/jamedudijench* said it best:   It's a good drink, just needs a little bit of ice.   Quantum had a lot of really cool elements. It's definitely a film heavily influenced by it's director - I think Mark Forster made some really interesting choices. The film looks great - lots of unique locations. David Arnold did great work on the score. But it's just missing something. Because there wasn't a screenwriter on set, the film definitely lacks polish. Elements are introduced early, like the Guy Haines aspect, only to disappear. And it's odd that we don't get to hear the information the Greene shares with Bond before being dropped in the desert.   Silva's plan in Skyfall might seem outlandish (I don't think it's as thin as others seem to), but overall, the film is more complete.    That said, I do like both, and think Quantum is unfairly criticized. There seems to be a revisionist history going on, that QoS was unsuccessful in the box office and critically. It was neither. The movie was a big hit, and most reviews said it was entertaining, and a worthy follow up to Casino Royale, but not the instant classic that Casino was. I think that's fair.   Edit: Misspelled the username."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,3,Fri Mar 20 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've brought this very issue up before, perhaps to a lesser degree, but I stand by it. Quantum of Solace is the Bond movie I find that I would much rather revisit than Skyfall."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,GetFreeCash,5,Thu Mar 19 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"There's nothing beneath Skyfall to hold it up. The plot is simply ludicrous (even by '80s Bond standards). They touch upon the computer skills the villain has, and then his beautiful plan at the end is to barge into a meeting and shoot M? I got up and left the theater."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,pick-a-spot,5,Thu Mar 19 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"no you didn't get up and leave the theatre. Admit it, you sat there like me waiting for some sort of twist to make everything make sense. Then the film ended and you were a bit confused but thought the film must be good. But the more you thought about it the more you realised that nothing made any sense"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,4,Fri Mar 20 09:05:13 2015 UTC,"Quantum is great, Skyfall is blah"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,pick-a-spot,3,Thu Mar 19 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"YES! I agree! QOS is in my top 3 bond films. Skyfall doesn't even make my top ten. There is so much wrong with skyfall, I left the theater tremendously disappointed. I honestly don't understand all the love for it.   Granted I didn't like QoS at all when I saw it in the theater either, but the movie has really grown on me. It's so densely packed with detail that it's hard to understand without repeat viewings."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,4,Thu Mar 19 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, which are the other two in your top 3? I'm just curious since it's not often that people declare QoS to be one of their top-tier Bond films."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Thu Mar 19 17:03:54 2015 UTC,QoS   Goldeneye   Live and let die   Special mention to Casino royale
JamesBond,2zlkp1,FrobozzMagic,2,Fri Mar 20 02:37:22 2015 UTC,Wow! Are you putting QoS at number 1 in your top 3?
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Fri Mar 20 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"damn right  because of this scene and the build up to it;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLPlohvMA88  Vesper dead. Mathis dead. Field's dead. Special branch guy, dead, random guy in Haiti hotel dead.  Is Bond beyond help... Does he even care anymore? 'you're so blinded with inconsolable rage, you don't care who your hurt' and then bam he comes back from the point of no return...or he was never 'gone' in the first place"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Fri Mar 20 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"I tip my hat to you. It takes some guts to admit QoS is your favorite. And here I thought people would think I'm crazy for putting it at #3.  I really do love the film though. Its always fun to watch. Plus I think Craig's acting freaking rocked in this one. That scene with Mathis on the plane is fantastic. We finally get to see just a glimmer of vulnerability in Bond. It's also nice to see 007 show some real emotion for once. Plus, I think its the first time on screen we've seen him slightly drunk. It was about time too considering the amount of alcohol Bond throws back in each film."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,akanefive,2,Fri Mar 20 23:58:55 2015 UTC,"Okay. Let's see these are my personal top 10 favorite Bond films (I know you only asked for 3, but indulge me here:   Casino Royale Goldeneye - It was my first Bond film watched in the theater.  Quantum of Solace OHMSS Goldfinger From Russia with Love Tomorrow Never Dies Live and Let Die License to Kill The Spy who Loved Me   Just in case you were wondering, Skyfall, for me, would probably be number 11. It just barely edges out The Living Daylights for that spot."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Thu Mar 19 21:35:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's definitely close to one of my favorites. I almost feel like I can't say that, as if enraged Bond fans will emerge from nowhere  and attack me. Casino Royale probably beats it for me, as far as Craig goes, but it's still up there on my list for me. But I'm an unusual Bond fan. My favorite Bonds are Lazenby, Dalton and Craig in no particular order...Connery is iconic, but he comes off as an unlikable prick sometimes. James Bond should definitely be a prick, but there's a line between likable prick and unlikable prick that he crosses sometimes. Moore is also great, I consider him the Adam West of Bonds. Sure, his films are mostly goofy as hell and far from the book characterization, but they're still mostly great entertainment and hard not to love. And Brosnan...it pains me to say it, because he was my first Bond, and I saw and loved all of his films back in the day. But now? Rewatching them was a chore. I'll always be grateful for him introducing me into the greater world of Bond, but his films did not age well, if they were ever good. (Goldeneye being the obvious exception.)"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,pick-a-spot,2,Thu Mar 19 17:10:12 2015 UTC,"Dalton is definitely underappreciated, and my personal favorite. He comes closest to the book Bond for me, especially in License to Kill, which is my favorite of the films."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,highorderdetonation,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:53:22 2015 UTC,Hell yeah! License to Kill is so underappreciated. With this re-watch marathon I'm having right now it's probably in my top 5. I actually see a lot of similarities between its reception and Quantum's. Though at least Craig got more chances.
JamesBond,2zlkp1,BannerHulk,2,Thu Mar 19 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"Goldeneye was the first Bond film I saw in the theater. To this day I have a massive man-crush on Pierce Brosnan because of that film. After growing up repeatedly watching the Moore films on TBS, Brosnan blew my mind with how cool he was in his first 007 film.  Sadly, his films never reached the apex of Goldeneye. Tomorrow Never Dies wasn't nearly as good, but it was enjoyable. TWINE and DAD, however, were terrible. They swung back too far into Moore territory for me. Its a real shame Brosnan's followups to Goldeneye didn't have better writers and directors. He could have had an amazing run."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,Dude4001,2,Thu Mar 19 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Funnily, the writers of the bad Brosnan movies also wrote all the Craig ones. Which is pretty mindblowing. I think it's most evident in Skyfall. But the directors and action choreographers in the Craig flicks are just top tier in comparison to the Brosnan era. TND isn't bad, but it's still directed by the guy who did Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,jwpar1701,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just don't understand how they picked some of the directors for the Brosnan films. Martin Campbell was an inspired choice. It's no coincidence that my top 1 & 2 favorite Bond movies where directed by him. He just knows how to do Bond right! He gets the nuances that make a phenomenal Bond movie. Goldeneye follows the Bond formula to a T, but it still somehow feels fresh. It managed to call out the Bond tropes without winking at the camera like the Moore films did. And Casino Royale is the first film since From Russia with Love to break out of the Formula. How do you go from Martin Campbell to D-List directors like Roger Spotiswoode, Michael Apted, and Lee Tamahori? I'm actually shocked TND is as good as it is considering its pedigree.   As far as Purvis and Wade goes. I have no idea how they were hired back after TWINE and DAD. But they did redeem themselves with CR and QoS. I'm not sure what happened with Skyfall, the writing in that is really the only thing wrong with the film. All the other elements of that movie were so good it masked all gaping plot holes and horrible inconsistencies. I'm not sure though if that was P&W's fault or John Logan's."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,vendetta06,2,Thu Mar 19 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"In fairness to those other directors, Martin Campbell has only directed two good movies, both of them Bond films. (The first Zorro is ok, but forgettable.) It's not like people were screaming for the return of Martin Campbell in 1999. This was the series m.o. in the Brosnan years - directors on the cheap. The fact that they have an Oscar winner at the helm these days is significant.  My theory on Purvis and Wade is that they're company men. EoN wanted some crazy, bonkers nonsense in the Brosnan years, and that's what they delivered. Then after Die Another Day, they hired people like Paul Haggis to craft the story, but kept P&W on to craft the action beats, which is what they're good at. (This is pure speculation, I have no idea if it's accurate.)"
JamesBond,2zlkp1,wildcard6270,2,Fri Mar 20 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I was about to disagree with you pretty fervently, but after spending some time on IMDB, I can't argue with you. His filmography is, in fact, pretty lackluster. However, I thought Mask of Zorro was great, and I'll watch ""Edge of Darkness"" over Lee Tamahori's ""Along Came a Spider"" any day. I personally can't speak to any of his other movies including the Zorro sequel as I haven't seen them.   Maybe he was just born to make James Bond films."

I can imagine the regular writers having ermm less creative input?  The two same writers (I forget their names) have distanced themselves from QoS, saying the director of that movie didn't let them see the final draft before it was too late.  Now when left with coming up with an original story  they did die another day, I'm not too sure about skyfall as John logan (I think) /Sam mendes also came aboard."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,vendetta06,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:45:32 2015 UTC,"QoS wasn't a bad film, no...as others have said, though, its being the followup to Casino Royale hurt it like crazy.  But I'll say this: if you judge Bond films by their villains, then this movie is a seriously mixed bag--Dominic Greene is unusual in that he's not exactly the typical charm-you-and-then-stab-you villain mold.  He's all about the objective, with just enough of a facade of charm to pass muster, and yet he still exudes a sort of sleaze that very few Bond henchmen--never mind main villains--generate.  (And by comparison: Jesper Christensen's dapper Mr. White, who opened the film.)  It actually worked in context, and I think I can appreciate it more with time, but it was definitely a weird spin on things at the moment--and more so, again, coming after the film that preceded it."
JamesBond,2zlkp1,jamedudijench,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"Not at all, but that being said, I love that QoS seems to be getting noticed as a let-down, but not the worst of the bond films, and quite frankly, decent. I really love QoS, I know that Bond isn't Mr. Emotional, but seeing him in turmoil and heartbreak, loved it. Plus the soundtrack was amazing."

I'd like to see Craig's Bond in a LTK/Mission Impossible style of story when MI6 is attacked from the inside and the only people that can do it is 00 agent..and have Bond and couple other double oh agents try to find out who did it and which one of them is the villain while the government chases them.

I think he was awkward in LALD and they tried to make him Connery-like in TMWTGG (roughing up Maud Adams for example). I don't feel they let Moore play Bond his way until TSWLM.

JamesBond,2zepyg,NeuralLotus,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:46:24 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Maybe it's just a bad angle.
JamesBond,2zepyg,i_fuck_for_breakfast,2,Wed Mar 18 17:47:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure. It does have a high collar. But I don't think it's a turtleneck.
JamesBond,2zepyg,NeuralLotus,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I see now, definitely not a turtleneck."
JamesBond,2zepyg,i_fuck_for_breakfast,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:02:59 2015 UTC,Very possible. I must research.

JamesBond,2zdluc,wmeredith,5,Tue Mar 17 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"This should have been the teaser! Separately you have something unique and something that's been done to death, but together you have what looks like a warning being left."
JamesBond,2zdluc,PleatherJacket,2,Wed Mar 18 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"Which blend mode did you use to overlay the two images without having color issues!? Maybe it wasn't even a blend mode, but if you would share your steps I would greatly appreciate it!  Edit - also, is there a vector version of the spectre logo out there anywhere? Or a TTF / OTF file for the font used?"
JamesBond,2zdluc,theforevermachine,7,Tue Mar 17 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"Since the original bullet hole is on black, either Screen mode, or a straight greyscale-to-alpha blend."
JamesBond,2zdluc,caligari87,4,Tue Mar 17 22:58:25 2015 UTC,Yep. Screen mode. Then fiddle with the levels to get the black background to true black so it becomes completely transparent.
JamesBond,2zdluc,wmeredith,2,Wed Mar 18 00:50:50 2015 UTC,Thanks so much!
JamesBond,2zdluc,theforevermachine,2,Tue Mar 17 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"Just something you may want to alter, the center of the bullet hole is too dark in comparison to Craigs tactical turtle neck."
JamesBond,2zdluc,geoface,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:36:29 2015 UTC,That looks awesome!
JamesBond,2zdluc,Hyperman360,12,Wed Mar 18 18:47:00 2015 UTC,That's pretty awesome.

JamesBond,2zdluc,sirgraemecracker,6,Wed Mar 18 01:34:31 2015 UTC,I think it's supposed to be that you are looking dead on at a mirror (the perspective that you'd have if you were Bond). So what looks like his left would be his right.
JamesBond,2zibee,Wicelo,2,Wed Mar 18 20:32:42 2015 UTC,"He is not sterile, impotent, or castrated.  Source: You Only Live Twice."
JamesBond,2zibee,omaixa,2,Thu Mar 19 00:10:10 2015 UTC,No.  Just messed up down there.  Hence all the hospital and recovery time.  Things get better though.
JamesBond,2zibee,sleep-apnea,2,Thu Mar 19 07:49:54 2015 UTC,"I think, because it's not real we're expected to believe Bond's balls are basically made of steel, so he manages to escape the inevitable crushed bollocks you'd receive in real life"
JamesBond,2zibee,Dude4001,2,Thu Mar 19 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"No he's not sterile. He fathers a child in You Only Live Twice, but he doesn't know about it"

JamesBond,2zibee,arafinwe,2,Wed Mar 18 20:37:17 2015 UTC,Castrated means he has his testicles cut off. Do you mean is he sterile (can't produce sperm)?
JamesBond,2zdae8,GetFreeCash,21,Tue Mar 17 17:06:28 2015 UTC,The Live and Let Die is strong with this one.  https://georgesjournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/live_and_let_die_roger_moore_publicity_shot_cool_pose.jpg?w=240&h=300
JamesBond,2zdae8,Gilatar,7,Tue Mar 17 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"I thought the teaser reminded me of Connery, but now that you point it out it's obviously a throwback to Live and Let Die. Not sure why I thought of Connery ..."
JamesBond,2zdae8,GetFreeCash,2,Tue Mar 17 17:17:45 2015 UTC,Maybe his stance? I feel like the way Craig is posed seems a bit Conneryesque. That might be just me though.
JamesBond,2zdae8,trevize1138,7,Tue Mar 17 17:18:37 2015 UTC,Yesh. He'sh got the schame classhic schwagger of the original Bond.
JamesBond,2zdae8,Lupara,3,Tue Mar 17 19:40:25 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thought of Steve McQueen in Bullitt, Not Roger Moore when I saw this?"
JamesBond,2zdae8,liza,1 point,Wed Mar 18 08:05:54 2015 UTC,i like how he subtly placed that gun between his legs. /s
JamesBond,2zdae8,Gilatar,11,Wed Mar 18 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest this is really underwhelming, but it's only a teaser (I liked the previous gun shot teaser  better) I hope THE poster will be more exciting than this (and better than Skyfall which wasn't bad but could have been better)"
JamesBond,2zdae8,JKastnerPhoto,10,Tue Mar 17 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"I was honestly expecting something more, even from a teaser, but I like it. Feels to me like there's something very retro about it - Craig almost reminds me of Connery/Moore in this picture, for some reason."
JamesBond,2zdae8,bunkerbuster338,5,Tue Mar 17 17:12:36 2015 UTC,Is this what you're thinking?
JamesBond,2zdae8,PleatherJacket,6,Tue Mar 17 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"That subtle ""the gun is my dick"" pose."
JamesBond,2zdae8,Gilatar,3,Tue Mar 17 19:23:36 2015 UTC,Bond doesn't have time for subtlety. He has to let you know that a licence to kill isn't the only qualification he has to be considered the best spy.
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, it must have been that."
JamesBond,2zdae8,PleatherJacket,8,Tue Mar 17 17:31:15 2015 UTC,I'd love the main poster to be a throwback to the old Connery/Moore illustrated posters.
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,5,Tue Mar 17 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"I would love that, but it costs money to make those posters because you have to hire an artist like Robert McGinnis or Drew Struzan - the latter who is already dead - instead of getting some guy to photoshop a poster and saturate the blues and oranges.  Anyway, I agree with whomever said that this one is underwhelming. I prefer the original teaser.  Edit: TIL Drew Struzan is still with us. Cheers to that."
JamesBond,2zdae8,PleatherJacket,5,Tue Mar 17 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah - but that's kind of what the Avengers posters are morphing into. I think the Avengers poster is poorly executed, but I like the concept."
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,5,Tue Mar 17 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"Almost every poster (and film) falls in line with orange and blue.  If you ever want to experience a total color shock, watch something as muted as Skyfall and then watch The Spy Who Loved Me or From Russia With Love.  Edit: Grammar."
JamesBond,2zdae8,PleatherJacket,3,Tue Mar 17 18:01:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, totally - Goldfinger is also exceptionally bright, with a ton of contrast."
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,4,Tue Mar 17 18:05:14 2015 UTC,That's because Goldfinger is the Bond film that should be preserved and sent into space in case anything happens to Earth.
JamesBond,2zdae8,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Tue Mar 17 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"Hopefully with a note that says, ""Please ignore the quasi-rape.""  Kidding aside, it's been awesome to watch the older films on blue-ray. I've picked up on so many details I had never noticed - as small as seeing that Connery was wearing a knit tie in the early scenes in Goldfinger."
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,3,Tue Mar 17 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Neat fact, he wears knit-ties in his all of them (can't remember YOLT) except DaF and Lazenby wears one as well."
JamesBond,2zdae8,PleatherJacket,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:55:02 2015 UTC,I noticed the knit ties in OHMSS too - makes me feel good about my preference for knit ties.
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,4,Wed Mar 18 13:38:44 2015 UTC,"If that note's being attached to Goldfinger, we've got to attach one to Skyfall that says, ""Please ignore the sex worker that Bond gets with immediately after she told him she was sold into the sex trade."""
JamesBond,2zdae8,sdesaulniers,2,Tue Mar 17 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"And one to Thunderball: ""Please ignore the scene where Bond punishes a woman by sleeping with her."""
JamesBond,2zdae8,PleatherJacket,4,Tue Mar 17 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, Drew Struzan was still alive last I looked. Wasn't JJ Abrams trying to get him to make the poster for The Force Awakens recently?"
JamesBond,2zdae8,sdesaulniers,3,Tue Mar 17 18:24:56 2015 UTC,You're right! I don't know why I thought he was dead.
JamesBond,2zdae8,mydarkmeatrises,3,Tue Mar 17 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"He's been retired for a while, maybe that was it?"
JamesBond,2zdae8,akanefive,3,Tue Mar 17 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, yes. A poster with elements from the film. Thunderball is one of my fav along with LALD.  Too lazy to upload. Google."
JamesBond,2zdae8,Gilatar,2,Tue Mar 17 23:57:18 2015 UTC,OHMSS might be my favorite.

JamesBond,2zdae8,NeuralLotus,3,Tue Mar 17 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"This is just James Bond looking like James Bond, why in gods name did it need a teaser?"
JamesBond,2zdae8,ThatLeviathan,7,Tue Mar 17 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"I love the poster. The only thing that bugs me is that his finger is on the trigger even though he's not aiming his gun at anything. Kind of unrealistic for someone who is supposed to be heavily trained in firearms. But it's still awesome. Especially the font. It seems to really fit the style of the new movies and seems to be fairly evocative of what SPECTRE is (the group I mean, not movie since how would I know that)."
JamesBond,2zdae8,iamnotparanoid,3,Tue Mar 17 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"I just thought exactly the same thing!  They have to have a firearms consultant on set, why the hell wouldn't they have him or her there for photoshoots involving guns as well?  I don't think anyone with any significant firearms knowledge would fail to notice it."
JamesBond,2zdae8,NeuralLotus,2,Tue Mar 17 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"You know what a consultant is for on set? They're paid so the movie can say they have a consultant to be more ""realistic"". The director doesn't care, and the guy making the poster thought this looked better."
JamesBond,2zdae8,Braxo,4,Wed Mar 18 00:41:02 2015 UTC,Seriously. Keeping your finger off the trigger until you have acquired a target (or at least are trying to acquire a target) is usually the third thing you learn. Right after assuming all weapons are loaded at all times and not pointing at anything you do not intend to shoot.
JamesBond,2zdae8,dgneo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:32:27 2015 UTC,"I used to think that, but many highly tactical positions actually train to keep the finger on the trigger.  So knowing that and knowing that in Bond's universe he is the most elite, it actually fits nicely."

JamesBond,2zdhbv,ML90,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, shooting should be wrapped sometime soon. Then it'll be months of leaks and avoiding trailers. I'll likely engage the same strategy as Skyfall. Watch the first teaser sporadically if I feel not much is being revealed or watch it only once if I feel they're giving us too much upon it's first viewing."
JamesBond,2zfsem,PleatherJacket,5,Wed Mar 18 05:14:31 2015 UTC,"Connery in any suit with a thin, black tie was good.   Dalton in the light colored suit and shirt with no tie was a pretty fine outfit.   Then I gotta go Craig's outfit at the end of Casino Royale.   I also gotta give love to Brosnan's covert ops suit in the beginning of Goldeneye.   Then how can you not love Moore in the turtleneck?"
JamesBond,2zfsem,jamedudijench,4,Wed Mar 18 11:34:27 2015 UTC,"I really liked the grey suit from the opening of Skyfall. There was another suit that I'm pretty sure was Daniel Craig, but I can't seem to find it. Maybe I completely made it up, but kind of a cream suit with a light blue shirt? Don't know where that image is coming from."
JamesBond,2zfsem,nealius,3,Wed Mar 18 17:55:11 2015 UTC,He also wears a more accurate one in The World is Not Enough.
JamesBond,2zfsem,jamedudijench,2,Wed Mar 18 18:44:15 2015 UTC,That suit is technically called a pick-and-pick suit because it is a twill weaved in alternating colors. The only other time Bond has worn that particular suit is Pierce Brosnan in the World is Not Enough.
JamesBond,2zfsem,WaddleBuff,2,Wed Mar 18 22:55:01 2015 UTC,This linen suit in The World Is Not Enough?
JamesBond,2zfsem,akanefive,2,Wed Mar 18 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"That's it. I could have sworn I saw it on Craig once, though."
JamesBond,2zfsem,nealius,2,Thu Mar 19 05:45:36 2015 UTC,"I believe you're thinking of a Brosnan outfit in Die Another Day. I was conjuring images of the most recent 3 Bonds and decided to check Brosnan. Alas, he's wearing an outfit that matches your description."
JamesBond,2zfsem,jamedudijench,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:40:35 2015 UTC,Wasn't Craig wearing that in the short scene from Casino Royale showing him getting off the plane in the Bahamas?

JamesBond,2zeuz1,acomputer1,2,Wed Mar 18 08:43:13 2015 UTC,Yup. I didn't see that at first but I like it. Still pretty meh about the poster. It looks like something shot for GQ or the like.
JamesBond,2zeuz1,ML90,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:41:33 2015 UTC,Well it is just a teaser. I think the black and white version looks too similar to Skyfall. I'm really excited about the aesthetics and general colour theme for Spectre.

JamesBond,2zewmy,Sir_Duke94,2,Wed Mar 18 00:20:42 2015 UTC,"It's a great film and the more times I watch it the more I like Lazenby. He was hated because he ""Wasn't Connery""."
JamesBond,2zewmy,sigersen,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:58:46 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly I think he did a wonderful job and if he wasn't so arrogant he would've been great in the 70s
JamesBond,2zewmy,akanefive,2,Wed Mar 18 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"It's got the best music, the best locations, and some of the best stunt work in the series. And there are enough skilled actors around him that Lazenby's inexperience isn't too jarring. It's in my top 5 for sure.   It's just too bad that Diamonds Are Forever isn't a more worthy follow up."
JamesBond,2zewmy,akanefive,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:33:45 2015 UTC,Yeah diamonds are forever really started bond off on the wrong foot in the 70s and unfortunately the other movies followed suit.
JamesBond,2zewmy,JamesBondRadio,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"Live and Let Die and The Spy Who Loved me are both really good, IMO."
JamesBond,2zewmy,JamesBondRadio,2,Wed Mar 18 20:26:29 2015 UTC,I love those movies as well but I wasn't trying to say they are bad they are much campier than the others. I prefer a more realistic spy movie like FRWL over TSWLM
JamesBond,2zewmy,TunaLobster,2,Wed Mar 18 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"DING DING DING DING DING  I'm ringing the Lazenby bell loud and clear! Majesty's is my all time favourite Bond movie. Absolutely brilliant all round. What I'd give to see Diamonds starring George, man that would have been a good movie!  We did a couple of podcast episodes you might find interesting...   Our Film Review:    http://jamesbondradio.com/on-her-majestys-secret-service-reviewed-podcast-021/   Our Interview With The Author of 'The Making of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Charles Helfenstein:   http://jamesbondradio.com/the-making-of-on-her-majestys-secret-service-charles-helfenstein-interview-james-bond-radio-podcast-022/  The interview goes deep on what happened behind the scenes and the author even talks about the early scripts (which he got to read) for what would have been George's version of Diamonds Are Forever...which would have been the perfect title for a Majesty's revenge movie followup when you consider the wedding etc. Absolutely fascinating!"

JamesBond,2zewmy,joosh82,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:01:13 2015 UTC,The dubbing bugged me through the whole thing. That's my rational for not liking it as a film in general. Good plotline for a Bond film though.
JamesBond,2zewmy,jwpar1701,3,Wed Mar 18 02:36:10 2015 UTC,I still don't get why they had to dub him when he was pretending to be Sir Hillary. It seems like it was a lot of extra work because of that.
JamesBond,2zewmy,dgener151,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:35:55 2015 UTC,"I always took the dubbing to be Bond actually imitaing the real Sir Hillary's voice, to add to the success of the charade, rather than an attempt to combat Lazenby's lack of acting experience.  Admittedly, no other time when Bond's impersonating someone was there any redubbing done, so I presume the Powers That Be realized it was a less than stellar choice and never tried again."

JamesBond,2ze1b7,rattlebat,2,Wed Mar 18 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"Supremacy - Muse   Honestly, it already sounds like it was written AS a bond theme! :D"
JamesBond,2ze1b7,RunEd51,2,Wed Mar 18 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"This is the song I came here to mention.   I don't know if there's any truth to it or not, but when Skyfall was coming out, I heard that Muse had been approached about creating the song for the movie but that they were also talking to other artists about it and would pick the one they thought suited the movie best. Again, I don't know if it's true or not but supposedly Supremacy lost out when it came down to either that or Adele's song."
JamesBond,2ze1b7,YoureKindOfADick,2,Wed Mar 18 04:42:20 2015 UTC,"This is new to me, but I love the song and feel that this makes a lot of sense. I personally think they passed on it because of Jack White and Alicia Keys's ""Another Way to Die,"" which while a good song is not a good Bond song. Then again, I'm not much of a fan of Quantum of Solace. Although I have not seen it in a while and I have considered watching it back-to-back with Casino Royale (which I love, but who doesn't) because it works better as an immediate watch - almost a missing piece instead of a sequel. Personally, I think the only thing missing from Casino Royale that was in Quantum of Solace was the epic ending line Fleming originally wrote: ""The bitch is dead now."" But who knows! I may end up loving Quantum of Solace upon rewatch."
JamesBond,2ze1b7,Duck-You-Sucker,5,Wed Mar 18 11:12:50 2015 UTC,That line is in casino though
JamesBond,2ze1b7,WaddleBuff,2,Wed Mar 18 11:38:34 2015 UTC,Mea culpa! That line is in Casino Royale! I was thinking of another bit in which M talks to Bond about Vesper Lynd that has nothing to do with Ian Fleming's original work.  This mind slip brought to you by pot.

JamesBond,2zf1n4,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:21:33 2015 UTC,I think we're fine as is. Its fun to supplement the movie talk with the stuff from the books to add to it. Its something for everyone that way :)
JamesBond,2zcz1f,adventcrash,2,Tue Mar 17 15:40:57 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, Connery was never in Miami - even the scenes without a green screen where he appears were filmed at Pinewood."
JamesBond,2zcz1f,akanefive,2,Tue Mar 17 16:45:24 2015 UTC,They were shot on plates because he was busy filming Marnie for Hitchcock I recall.
JamesBond,2zcz1f,Clancy_B_Shanty,0,Tue Mar 17 23:58:44 2015 UTC,I did no research before watching the movies because when reviewing I wanted the most open and oblivious point of view as possible aside from what I've already heard and absorbed through osmosis so that's probably right and I wouldn't have known going in but it becomes obvious.
JamesBond,2zcz1f,akanefive,2,Tue Mar 17 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"Makes total sense. I'm one of those people that likes to read everything I can about a movie after I see it, which is why my head is full of useless trivia not unlike what I posted above."
JamesBond,2zcz1f,akanefive,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:02:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I've only been reading anything after my review is posted. Usually hit the IMDB trivia page.

JamesBond,2zcz1f,kristopherm3,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:11:08 2015 UTC,I could also recommend a podcast called James Bonding which is what got me started on this little adventure. It's pretty great and you get some trivia from that as well.

JamesBond,2z9xqv,ankensam,6,Mon Mar 16 22:27:52 2015 UTC,We are going to announce in the near future the announcement of a future teaser for a future trailer for a future movie.
JamesBond,2z9xqv,Gr33nman460,4,Tue Mar 17 02:24:47 2015 UTC,SPECTRE's actually a teaser for Bond 25.  Edit: Grammar.
JamesBond,2z9xqv,PleatherJacket,0,Tue Mar 17 03:43:55 2015 UTC,We have a leaked script and live-time coverage of the filming locations. A teaser poster is a little irrelevant.
JamesBond,2z9y2u,doctorgaines,3,Mon Mar 16 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting to read your thoughts. I've always enjoyed the book ""Live and Let Die."" One of the things that stood out to me in your review was your mention of the pacing; Live and Let Die may be Fleming's best paced book. It never seems to slow down, but it also doesn't seem to move too fast, either, and always keeps you engaged. It's also one of the Fleming's most exciting novels, as well, though if I remember correctly it lacks a bit on the characterizations that are more prominent in some of the other books.  If you read any of the other novels (and I hope you do!) I really look forward to reading your thoughts on them."
JamesBond,2z9y2u,jasonm87,2,Tue Mar 17 01:43:17 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I never thought of that -- but you're right. The pacing is very consistent up until the last two chapters!  I hope you keep reading them. Moonraker is the next in the series and it is a personal favourite.  Ps. My copy of Dr No is a Signet edition!"
JamesBond,2z9y2u,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Tue Mar 17 01:54:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Glad you enjoyed the review. I will for sure be reading more of them. I'd like to go back and read Casino Royale, then read the rest in publishing order."
JamesBond,2z9y2u,MrBigD77,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:25:30 2015 UTC,I've been trying to find any of his books other than library and online. Do book stores not carry them for some reason?
JamesBond,2z9y2u,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Tue Mar 17 01:46:56 2015 UTC,"Major book retailers should carry the Black, White and Red covered versions. That's what Chapters up in Canada carries. So Barnes and Noble should in theory be the same."
JamesBond,2z9y2u,NeuralLotus,2,Tue Mar 17 01:52:52 2015 UTC,"You can find them on Kindle for free with a Kindle subscription. And if you're willing to read them all in 30 days, you can read it all for free with a trial account."
JamesBond,2z9y2u,jamedudijench,2,Tue Mar 17 06:05:51 2015 UTC,I've seen Casino Royale in Barnes & Noble.
JamesBond,2z9y2u,DistinguishedSpirits,0,Tue Mar 17 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Check out Moonraker, the next book in the series. It's way better. You'll probably dig it."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,adventcrash,6,Mon Mar 16 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"I have always felt that this was Moore's last decent picture. It's not as good as TSWLM, but it's pretty good. Age catches up with all of us and his only crime was playing the role too long. But that's what EON wanted and the guy followed the money. I can't blame him."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,sigersen,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:05:42 2015 UTC,Moore was already pretty old when he started. It would have been interesting to see someone else after Moonraker.
JamesBond,2z8n7p,Smileyjoe72,2,Mon Mar 16 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"I sometimes wonder how much of it is Moore seeming like / being the nicest guy in the world. I couldn't fire him either. Of all the actors who have played Bond, I think I'd most like to hang out with Moore. And that's saying a lot."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Mon Mar 16 17:18:01 2015 UTC,He seems like a pretty stand up dude. Hard to imagine him as Bond sometimes for that reason. There's also the comparison to Connery being a wife beater and Moore being beaten by his wife. He clearly doesn't like violence.
JamesBond,2z8n7p,David_Jay,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, I always considered this his second best outing."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,akanefive,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:48:10 2015 UTC,What about a view to a kill? That's my favorite Moore film.
JamesBond,2z8n7p,akanefive,2,Tue Mar 17 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"I like this one, my only main gripe is the music. It's really dated. I like Bill Conti, but there are some sections of the score that are just everything bad about the 80's."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,akanefive,2,Mon Mar 16 19:42:45 2015 UTC,Yeah honestly the score of the last few Roger Moore films have seemed super dated and in some cases out of place for a Bond film. Too much era music not enough spy music.
JamesBond,2z8n7p,dgener151,2,Mon Mar 16 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"It seems to right itself after this one. The non-Berry scores tend to be somewhat jarring, I think. That said, I secretly kind of like the super-disco Bond '77 track in the skiing sequence of TSWLM."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,akanefive,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:56:19 2015 UTC,I know Goldeneye has some weird score moments like the scene in the car after the cold open but that's the only one that jumps to mind.
JamesBond,2z8n7p,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Mon Mar 16 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"The GoldenEye music is peculiar. When it works, it's really cool, but when it's bad, it's REALLY bad."
JamesBond,2z8n7p,akanefive,2,Tue Mar 17 00:51:00 2015 UTC,The music in that scene reminds me of one of the campier episodes of Are you Afraid of the Dark?.
JamesBond,2z6pl4,bsf91,2,Mon Mar 16 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"I've been sceptical of them for some reason...  I don't have a logical reason for this aside from ""Well...it ain't Fleming"".

JamesBond,2z6pl4,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:02:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I've been listening to them and John Gardner's just seem so... Bad? I don't know how to put it, I'm not much of a reader but its so difficult to read them.  I enjoyed Raymond Benson's though and the Devil May Care seemed good. Colonel Sun sucked imo, and so did Carte Blanche, way way too much ""I'll just use my iPhone and do this"" sorta thing"
JamesBond,2z6pl4,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"I feel I almost owe it to the series to try one of the non-Fleming ones. Part of what made that series so good was it there was so much of Fleming in them. So, how on Earth could another author capture that spirit, ya know?"

JamesBond,2z6p03,dragonsky,4,Mon Mar 16 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"The articles title is a bit misleading. This is from the article itself ""While the changes of the film will only affect a very small portion""  Hardly a re-write is it?"

Keep in mind these are MY opinions and by no means a universally agreed-upon list.  CONNERY: Goldfinger (the most iconic Bond film, a must-watch for that reason alone), From Russia With Love  LAZENBY: OHMSS, obviously  MOORE: The Spy Who Loved Me, watch For Your Eyes Only if you feel like seeing a more serious turn  DALTON: Even though I prefer Licence to Kill, I usually recommend people check out The Living Daylights first as it's more of a prototypical Bond movie  BROSNAN: GoldenEye  CRAIG: Casino Royale, watch Skyfall too if you want to be up-to-date in preparation for SPECTRE"
JamesBond,2z5avl,GetFreeCash,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"Great list here. I would add You Only Live Twice (Blofeld and his volcano lair) for Connery and Live and Let Die (a lot of fun) and A View to a Kill (Christopher Walken is an excellent Bond villain) for Moore.  Also, Licence to Kill is an awesome film because it is the first time we get a dark Bond (Craig is often given that, but Dalton was first). So definitely watch it after The Living Daylights."
JamesBond,2z5avl,PleatherJacket,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"If you have a nice chunk of time, watch Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace back to back. It's a great 3.5 hour movie since there is no time passed between them."

It's a better idea to switch Bonds every once in a while so you get an idea what it means to be a Bond film.

JamesBond,2z5avl,Smokinacesfan55,5,Mon Mar 16 13:56:07 2015 UTC,"Fair, but each movie is partly a time-capsule to the time they were made. Watching the evolution of society, fashion trends, villains and plots is part of the fun."
JamesBond,2z5avl,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:32:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You should watch them in order. Especially when you come across tributes to old films in the newer ones. It's nice to see that little tip o' the hat to the classic films. Which you'd miss if you skipped over the old films.

Some of my favorites are You Only Live Twice, Octopussy, For Your Eyes Only, License to Kill, The Worls Is Not Enough, and Goldeneye"
JamesBond,2z5avl,MasterUnlimited,2,Sun Mar 15 21:09:58 2015 UTC,What is your reasoning for that particular order?
JamesBond,2z5avl,PoopScootnBoogey,3,Sun Mar 15 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"The order looks pretty logical.  It takes your through the beginning of Bond and two more iconic bond films that really build the Bond storyline.

JamesBond,2z5avl,Smokinacesfan55,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:57:45 2015 UTC,"Takes you through the cinematic beginning of Bond with the classics, then the characters beginnings, then Spy Who Loved Me is one of the most iconic and a good introduction to Moore. The rest are just recommendations.  I wouldn't bother watching them in order, you'll get fatigued during Moore, even though he's my personal favorite."

Brosnan- Goldeneye Craig- Casino Royale  Haven't seen the Dalton ones as I am watching them for the first time myself and I can't recommend Lazenby unless you commit to watching them all. On it's own it can be kind of rough because Lazenby is pretty bad.

JamesBond,2z63fq,PleatherJacket,2,Sun Mar 15 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"This film contains one of the best introductions to a character that will ever exist. The gambling, the smoking, and Bond's ever calm personality make this scene so memorable."
JamesBond,2z46pk,dantheman757,11,Sun Mar 15 11:52:16 2015 UTC,"He has a licence to kill, not a licence to capture.  The point of the Double-00 section is not to punish, it is to eliminate threats against Great Britain, and quite possibly the world.  Contrary to what Dr No once said about him, Bond is not a policeman, he is an assassin."
JamesBond,2z46pk,I_Will_Be_Blunt_,13,Sun Mar 15 15:17:48 2015 UTC,"In the Craig films M often gives off at Bond for his reckless behaviour rather than carrying out his assignment (the bomb in the Embassy in CR; instantly killing a lead instead of questioning him in QoS, etc.), but Bond is usually in a life or death situation and has no other choice but to kill before he gets killed or captured himself."
JamesBond,2z46pk,0regan0,12,Sun Mar 15 12:33:04 2015 UTC,"And to be fair, he does end Casino Royale and begin QoS with a successful capture."
JamesBond,2z46pk,MrDegausser,15,Sun Mar 15 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"He has nowhere to keep them. Or it is self defense. Goldfinger had tried to kill bond, and his death was an accident. Also cuts down on loose ends. Bond is, after all, kinda a dick"
JamesBond,2z46pk,Duck-You-Sucker,6,Sun Mar 15 12:23:07 2015 UTC,"I saw a BBC program where Stella Rimington (ex-head of MI5) said Bond's essentially an assassin, in that he's given a target and he kills them. I'd contest this because M gets bond to investigate these people, and it always turns out they he has to kill them, coincidentally. Or, to look at it another way, we only see the interesting megalomaniac baddies and Bond spends a lot of time chasing after people who turn out to be not that bad, but those missions would suck as films."

JamesBond,2yzzmz,AnotherMansCause,-7,Sat Mar 14 07:50:36 2015 UTC,this is the real reason and the reasons movies today are so convoluted and unbelievable. Just compare movies made in the 70s and 80s to movies made today. Star Wars sequals vs prequals.
JamesBond,2yzzmz,1701ncc,3,Sat Mar 14 17:58:57 2015 UTC,Star wars-why didnt the guy on the star destroyer shoot the pod with r2d2? Your point is invalid
JamesBond,2yzzmz,ILendMyAxeToAll,8,Tue Mar 17 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"They really didn't need any information out of Silva   Surely they wanted to know how he hacked MI6, and planted a bomb there?"
JamesBond,2yzzmz,Endurum,3,Sat Mar 14 12:31:11 2015 UTC,Something something he was once an MI6 operative something something insider knowledge.
JamesBond,2yzzmz,jamedudijench,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"The ""bomb"" was gas leak + flame."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,arafinwe,7,Sun Mar 15 03:17:59 2015 UTC,"Do you mean after he had killed the minions, when the helicopters showed up? Maybe the ""rat speech"" served its purpose? For all of Bond's resistance to the mindgames, here is a former fellow agent who (Tanner said it earlier, blink and you'll miss it) worked with M, claims to be ""you from 10 years ago“, claims to have been her favourite and showed Bond his MI6 records where he failed his tests (where M lied). He was preying on what Bond perceived as a betrayal from M. It's not that far-fetched for me to imagine Bond would have wanted to get to the bottom of this rather than just killing Silva.  Pay attention to the way Bond looks at M when she's interrogating Silva. He's not entirely convinced about what she's saying. And M can tell, that's why she tells him Silva's real name afterwards, to put Bond's mind at ease that she does, in fact, remember her agents.   That's how I view it, but I agree with those above who say the Shanghai plot was too convoluted.   In any case, Bond's orders were to find out who was behind Patrice and to terminate Patrice. He wasn't ordered to kill anyone else. For all they know, Silva could have a program to publish the NATO names even after he's killed, so they must find a way to stop that."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,acomputer1,2,Sat Mar 14 13:18:00 2015 UTC,"He's a Double O, technically he can kill anyone he likes while on a mission.   (I do agree with what you said though)"
JamesBond,2yzzmz,NeuralLotus,3,Sat Mar 14 14:06:41 2015 UTC,"Well, he can kill anyone that is necessary to kill. He obviously has to obey MI6's orders to not kill certain people, as long as it is possible. And I doubt MI6 would look favorably on him going on a rampage and killing lots of civilians."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,acomputer1,0,Mon Mar 16 08:42:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, his orders at the start of Casino Royale were to take that bomb maker alive, and he killed him.   Obviously he was reprimanded for that, but, I feel as though he could have gotten away with killing Silva :P   (I still do agree with /u/arafinwe though)"
JamesBond,2yzzmz,acomputer1,7,Mon Mar 16 10:36:02 2015 UTC,"To be honest, (as I have said before on this sub) I don't know why Silva was the villain to begin with, or, at least, why he was such a narrow minded and seemingly careless one.   I mean, his overall goal was to kill M. Like, his goal in the ENTIRE MOVIE. If that was his goal, why did he have that random Asian guy killed in Shanghai? But, not only that, why would he use the same hit-man type person he used to get the HDD? Its just silly.   I think they could have made him a better villain by linking him with Quantum, and made it seem like this was a side project.   With the whole Shanghai segment, though, it was like they tried to go the same rout they did with QoS with the whole back to square one thing, gotta go find the bad guy, but then they just decided that they really couldn't be bothered, so just gave Bond the villain and called it there. I mean, hell, that happens in the first half of the movie! Then the rest is just Bond and M."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,acomputer1,1 point,Sat Mar 14 10:29:56 2015 UTC,"There was a line or two in Skyfall that, looking back/ahead, could possibly be construed as linking Skyfall/Silva to Spectre/Quantum.  But, yeah. He was not as dangerous a villain as Greene, IMO.  I'm coming around to think that history will play up QoS as better than it first seemed and play down Skyfall as being a bit overhyped."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,codespyder,1 point,Sun Mar 15 03:17:49 2015 UTC,"The thing I like about QoS with Greene is that, for most of the movie, Bond doesn't know Greene is the bad guy. He's still figuring it all out, connecting the dots, and understanding it all.   In Skyfall, it all just falls into his lap, and just feels a bit too easy."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,WaddleBuff,4,Sun Mar 15 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I also like how Dominic fights, like other villains either go out quickly with little fighting, are experts in hand-to-hand combat, etc., where as Greene is a, basically, a glorified desk jockey and just uses his environment (see: fire axe) to fight, which, really, makes him incredibly dangerous in a close-quarters fight, since formal training teaches you (in a broad generalization) a series of deflections and counters, whereas when going up against someone with zero training, you have to end up using your hands and training to deflect a motherfucking fire axe.  Basically, Bond got lucky going up against Greene since one good hit with the fire axe and Bond is disabled long enough that Greene can get in a fatal whack or two with the axe."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,Stringfellow__Hawke,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"I guess the problem I've had with QoS is the ""evil plot"", which instead of a leaking of secrets or world domination, turns out to be monopolizing the water supply of Bolivia. Instead of upping the stakes as it goes along, the movie went the other way which was pretty disappointing.   I think with Skyfall they recognized that the stakes had to be upped on a personal level if not an external level. Silva is dangerous because he wants revenge and nothing but. A vendetta can make a person deranged which, in my opinion, makes me him more dangerous."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,Willravel,12,Tue Mar 17 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"For a good movie or a good story in general, some logical decisions need to be suspended. Also, Bond probably thought that the security was tight enough for Silva to hold a safe conversation with M. That tupperware container did look pretty foolproof."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,nealius,0,Sat Mar 14 08:29:24 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think we let writers and directors off the hook way too easily. For the most part all the characters in Casino Royale made pretty logical decisions. Their motivations and actions for the most part all made sense. Is it too hard to make another CR?
JamesBond,2yzzmz,nealius,2,Sun Mar 15 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"At the time, Bond was operating under the impression that his mission was the retrieval of the NOC list, which had been taken at the beginning of the movie. Killing Silva would have been a huge risk, because it could have triggered the release of the rest of the names of undercover agents. Even if Bond could overpower all of Silva's hence-people and kill Silva, there's no guarantee he could retrieve the list before it was leaked.   It was only later in the film that Silva's true plan came into view and both Bond and M came to realize that the theft of the list was just to get their attention. Silva had no interest in releasing the names, it was just about vengeance against M."

JamesBond,2yzzmz,acomputer1,2,Sun Mar 15 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"It's been a few weeks since I last saw the movie, but I don't recall Bond ever being alone with Silva on the island."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,nealius,0,Sat Mar 14 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"It's after he swiped the gun from the guard and took them all out, and then held Silva at gunpoint, just before the choppers show up."
JamesBond,2yzzmz,Stringfellow__Hawke,2,Sun Mar 15 00:02:11 2015 UTC,Ah that part!
JamesBond,2yzzmz,nealius,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  Though, like u/Willravel said, Bond's #1 goal was list retrieval and IDing the guy that hired Patrice to swipe it and that it was one piece of Silva's puzzle that led to the ultimate goal of revenge against M."

He was getting a little too old for the role then,  but it worked as the film was a lot more down to earth than the previous films.  I think Bond films have always had a roller coaster style trend to them. The series would progress and become more and more like a science fiction films before the producers would wake up and bring the series back down  to earth."
JamesBond,2ywb13,Smileyjoe72,3,Sat Mar 14 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"There are the more serious Moores too. TSWLM keeps a lot of it to a minimum (no J.W. Pepper, no absolutely insane plots, Moore is still young enough to pull it off)."

JamesBond,2ywb13,korrt106,2,Sat Mar 14 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"Aha, and here comes my very controversial opinion.   James Bond is one of the most successful film franchises in history, and they're very different from the books. Popular though they are, the novels are not nearly as popular as the movies.  The films as a whole have not been based off the books in decades. When a new writer or director comes in they don't go ""Oooh yes, I loved reading those!""   They likely say ""Oh yes, I'd love to work on a Bond film, I grew up watching them!""  James Bond is not and has not been about the books is such a ridiculously long time that we have to stop comparing them. They're completely different things at this point."
JamesBond,2ywb13,Dr_ChimRichalds,32,Mon Mar 16 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty weak argument. The tropes of the old Bond films became tired and outdated. We didn't see the Austin Powers movies and decided, you know what, Bond is stupid! Myers was parodying a genre that needed badly to be brought into the 21st Century. He didn't fuck anyone."
JamesBond,2ywb13,GavinZac,13,Fri Mar 13 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"The genre had already been brought into the 21st century with the Bourne films four years before Casino Royale. That's how it should happen, new characters, new settings.   It's an unpopular opinion around here but I don't particularly like the reboot. They're ok-to-excellent films, and in some ways closer to the books, but there was no need to grittify 'film Bond'. Have an original character solve Bolivia's water crisis.   Someone else mentioned Kingsmen. I was dreading going to see that as it had the possibility of being utter rubbish if done badly. But it was done extremely well, a great cast, great writing, great imagery and most of all it was fun. I wasn't thinking 'oh that's silly', because I understood what I was watching. Fun in a way that so many movies are missing these days, even <inception noise> superhero films. Fun in the way that Bond films used to be."

JamesBond,2ywb13,Veggieleezy,8,Fri Mar 13 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"Saw it! And while I definitely love and prefer the Connery/Dalton/Craig Bonds- darker- I always enjoyed the Moore/Brosnan Bonds on a more superficial level.

JamesBond,2ywb13,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Fri Mar 13 18:23:49 2015 UTC,I loved the fun too. Its annoying nowadays how we have all these pretentious realists forcing a reflection of life onto a screen. Wasn't James Bond escapism and fantasy anyway?
JamesBond,2ywb13,PleatherJacket,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:40:14 2015 UTC,Yes.....to a point. When the books were written they were done so as a  salve for the British people who were still on War rations and quickly losing their place in the international arena. The character (whether deliberate or not) was a reflection and a rejection of what England and the Empire had become.
JamesBond,2ywb13,Chilblain,2,Sun Mar 15 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"I never thought it was bad back then. But when Casino Royale came out I saw what it could have been. I mean looking back, DAD could almost be a sequel to Austin Powers."

JamesBond,2ywb13,Emay75,3,Fri Mar 13 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Bond has always changed with the times, depending on what audiences wanted. The 60s spy movies were sexist, stylish and cool, but in the 70s audiences wanted a but more light hearted, almost goofy style, and Moore did that well. The 80s were grittier and Dalton was perfect. The 90s were a bit of both and Brosnan was great (my favourite)  Now with the likes of Bourne being so huge and a general shift to more realism, Bond has followed suit.  Im sure in another 10 years the style will change again.  Its not like someone watched Austin Powers and thought ""wow is that what Bond is like, we need to change"""
JamesBond,2ywb13,mdegroat,2,Sat Mar 14 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"let's see how the Man From UNCLE turns out.

In the How many actors have played Bond? question, they give the answer as 7, but there's more on screen James Bond actors, and even more when you include radio (Bob Holness being the first and  Toby Stephens being the most recent, IIRC).  On screen there were the 6 official EON actors (Connery to Craig), Barry Nelson on the Climax! television adaption of CR, David Niven in the 1967 film - That's 8 visual portrayals alone, 9 if you include Bob Simmons playing James Bond in the gunbarrel sequences of DN, FRWL & GF.  So yeah, the quiz isn't exactly correct."
JamesBond,2ywm7m,BondFan2015,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... well for the Bonds question, I don't think Jimmy Bond counts.

JamesBond,2yt460,dibsODDJOB,5,Thu Mar 12 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"None of the Craig films follow the Bond formula that well, so I'd say that, no, it hasn't been that formulaic lately.  In fact, I'd love for SPECTRE to be a little more formulaic. The formula for Craig has been: ""something happens to Bond and he goes rogue to settle a personal score"". The gun barrel scene has been at the end of every Craig movie, completely opposite of every other film. The cold opens are always there in every movie (except Dr. No), and are one of the best parts of the franchise. What's missing from the Craig Bonds is a cold open that is completely unrelated from the rest of the film. From the end of Skyfall, it seems like they are ready to go back to a little bit more of the formula that really made the series."
JamesBond,2yt460,BraveEyefilms,2,Thu Mar 12 16:58:17 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ez7ZYceOs  You can see Bond in M's new office. So it is more than likely that they are going back to the formula. Which a lot of Bond fans have been waiting for.

JamesBond,2yt460,dibsODDJOB,2,Fri Mar 13 14:24:27 2015 UTC,"Any actual footage from a film is spoilers.

Skyfall and Casino Royale have been less formulaic than the films from Brosnan, Dalton, Moore and the later Connery ones, I agree.  But even then, all of Craig's films have a girl Bond sleeps with to get information (and subsequently dies).  And since his films had a different plot, they weren't necessary.  I agree Craig's film broke out of the gadgets, gags, and one-liners, and such though."

JamesBond,2ysl1b,melissadhastings,10,Thu Mar 12 13:51:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, as far as spy movies go, FRWL is definitely the best.  There is so much more tradecraft in FRWL than most other (older) movies. Plus you have a bunch of storylines that crosspaths (the whole chasing SMERSH agents not realising they are SPECTRE), lots of friendly and enemy agents (who are actually doing spy things instead of just extra fighting men). The counter intelligence agents/assassins. Bond taking part in a political bombing to gain intel. Hiding out with gypsies.   Bond eventually went on to become a great action star as well, but there is something so satisfying to watch Bond being a spy instead of an action hero. There are way more iconic movies for Bond (Goldfinger, MWTGG, and Thunderball) but in terms of spying - I agree with Olen Steinhauer and Alex Berenson."
JamesBond,2ysl1b,Seesawkarma,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"I've gotta agree with you. It feels the most like a more realistic (a word rarely used for Bond) spying scenario.

JamesBond,2ysl1b,ScornfulLysander,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:41:58 2015 UTC,Not to mention its most of the Bond actor's favourite 007 film. I am likely to agree with them. Its a sharp sharp sharp movie. 'Dat fight scene holds up today for how vicious it is.
JamesBond,2ysl1b,Clancy_B_Shanty,5,Fri Mar 13 01:52:49 2015 UTC,"As a straight spy film, FRWL is the best in my opinion. It seems the closest in style to the books. I would place Goldfinger right behind it. I feel that FRWL is Connery's best film, edging out Goldfinger by a nose. I liked their other choices too. The Ipcress File is a classic, as is The Hunt For Red October."
JamesBond,2ysl1b,sigersen,5,Thu Mar 12 14:13:47 2015 UTC,It's definitely one of the best. Bond movies should be rated on their watchability though. FRWL is great but my favorite is Live and Let Die.

JamesBond,2ysuws,WhiteBoythatCantJump,3,Thu Mar 12 19:20:26 2015 UTC,Although admittedly it's pretty cool to see for the first time on screen an HK VP9.   But I doubt he was issued the HK. If I remember the BTS video he disarmed the attacker and used it. Plus another set photo has him with the trusty PPK.   Part of me wants him to upgrade to the P99 or the P99 successor-- the PPQ.
JamesBond,2ysuws,AsianShieldAgent,2,Thu Mar 12 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"That's one of the things that threw me about QoS: he had the P99 in CR (which is keeping in continuity from the Brosnan years), but in QoS (which is supposed to take place right after CR), he suddenly is back to the PPK."
JamesBond,2ysuws,PerfectlyNormal77,2,Thu Mar 12 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"See, I feel like for production/style reasons, the PPK sat better with Marc Foster.   In my mind, I justified it with ""he lost the P99 in CR but had the PPK as his backup"". The time between CR and QoS was insufficient for him to re-equip himself with a P99. If you notice, after he uses the PPK at the end of the rooftop chase, the PPK is not seen again until the Toscana scene. And that can be justified by him wearing a tux, with the PPK being infinitely more concealable than the P99. He then does not use any Walther until the Russia scene at the end when he confronts Yusef. Which then begs the question, why not use the P99 during the end Russia scene?"

I don't think it really matters, and having James Bond be a code name just cheapens the cool factor of Bond.   The argument also falls apart when he says we've had six Moneypenny's, so why not have more than one Bond? Umm, we've had six major film Bonds, more in TV, radio and other lower spinoffs, and they've all played him very differently. And they haven't necessarily been tied to a single historic timeline, although some movies throw references to others. He wishes for the Bond to be played different ways, as if Dalton's Bond and Moore's Bond were played the same way, which couldn't be farther from the truth."

JamesBond,2yoopa,jamedudijench,15,Wed Mar 11 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you,  I think there were many memorable scenes in QoS, the homage to Goldfinger the ""Oilfinger"" scene is not only relevant to the real world when it came out, and less so now, but also a very beautifully shot scene, that brought back some memories.  Also the scene where James is so angry, and vengeful, Craigs more ""flawed"" Bond really made it believable, when he offered the can of oil to Greene with the comment ""I bet you make it 20 miles before you consider drinking that."".  The oil/water plot was not the worst plot in a spy film :)  The Opera scene was very nice, with James sneaking into and monitoring the Quantum members.  and of course the beginning that takes place immediately after Casino Royale.  I totally agree with you, that it is not deserving of 'all' the hate that it gets.  Thank you.  (Flawed Bond, does not mean worse, but he is more human than many previous Bonds, so he makes mistakes,  assumptions, and shows emotions.)"
JamesBond,2yoopa,Enyeez,8,Wed Mar 11 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, thank you. Yes, people act like Bond films are never topical. They're literally ALWAYS topical. If people weren't complaining that it's too topical and ""of its time"" then they'd be complaining that Soviet aggression and Cold War era spying is no longer relevant.   I also love the opera scene! Such a cold, capable Bond.   Some people say flawed, I say Fleming. He explained James as a boring character with interesting things going on around him. I mean after all, he gave him the most boring name he could find. That's a fact.   To me, there's just something believable about a faceless entity manipulating resources to gain control and power. All the people that call this plot unrealistic and unbelievable, look at me in the face and tell me that shit doesn't go on on a macro or micro scale in the  real world. The scene with the villagers at the spigot looking troubled and bewildered about where the water went really resonated with me, as someone who is fortunate and doesn't have to worry about things like that. And I am the opposite of preachy."
JamesBond,2yoopa,WhiteBoythatCantJump,3,Wed Mar 11 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"I agree withe everything you said excluding the whole opera scene.  While fun, it was not very bond-esque."
JamesBond,2yoopa,jjness,10,Wed Mar 11 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"IMO, it's a good movie.  Not a great one, but way better than the ill repute it seems to get from the James Bond community.  The film was rushed and due to the writer's strike, it's backed by only a skeleton of a script.  Craig said he had to write sections of the movie himself because they weren't allowed to employ writers.  And Craig felt making the movie a sequel as a safer approach than just inventing a plot out of nowhere.  How it managed to even be a watchable movie at all is a feat.  I think if Eon/MGM had another year or two on it (as they had with the more acclaimed Casino Royale and Skyfall), it would have been an amazing 9/10 movie rather than a still-good 6/10 movie.  Craig's acting was great.  Dominic Greene was a great understated villain (what Carver from TND should have been).  Camille is a strong ""bond girl"".  The plot has strong emotions with a clear concept of what political issues it wanted to take on.  The beginning was solid, the ending hit hard and there were some nice (though not necessarily $200m nice) action bits in between.    As for the directing, I'm warming up to it.  I like rewatching it to see what's going on.  Some scenes could've been slower, but on the whole, I felt the fast pace helped it.  It probably would've been as long as Casino Royale if it didn't decide to have so many cuts, and that would've been too long for a movie without a fully fleshed plot.    A James Bond movie doesn't need ""shaken not stirred"", ""Bond, James Bond"", gadgets and such to be good.  And it's okay to have serious movies every now and then.  I loved License to Kill, for example.  But at the same time, Quantum still manages to follow the Goldfinger formula more than it could have.  It had lots of great concepts such as water monopolies, oil companies and such are an issue.  Craig-era Eon wants to apply Fleming's work to modern day issues.  Post 9/11 terrorism was on our minds for Casino Royale.  In 2012, Skyfall addressed cyberterrorism (even a bit more ahead of its time than one would expect it to).  In 2008, oil prices, corporate corruption and things like that were on our minds.  They could have done more with that.  Somethings are  indefensible, like choosing the title last minute and not even mentioning it in the movie, or plot inconsistencies like how M seems to uncharacteristically follow Bond via airplane everywhere.  But most of these things are nitpicks.  Some more fundamental problems, however, are that most of the characters have curt dialogue, intimate moments (while they are great when we do see them) are rare.    And the viewer should have been shown the impact of Greene's actions, such as social unrest and an outright violent Civil War in Bolivia.  What would Skyfall have been without the M16 headquarters being blown up and M being threatened via virus?  Perhaps a scene of Bond dismantling the dam and saving the day would've made it more Bond-esque.  An environmental crisis would be a legitimate MI6 mission, but without that fully fleshed out, it did become more about Bond's personal life than it could have been.  The issue with the movie wasn't that its concepts were poorly executed.   It's that they weren't executed enough.  With Brosnan's post-Goldeneye movies, they took sound ideas but went in a bat-shit crazy route in implementing them.  That's not Quantum's problem.  With Quantum, they were painting the right portrait.  But the portrait was more like a wonderful drawing on a sketchpad than a beautiful painting in an art gallery.  In the end, though, it had the unfortunate luck of being the forgotten middle child between two more impactful movies.  I think history will be much much kinder to Quantum while also recognizing its shortcomings and what it could have been."
JamesBond,2yoopa,jjness,5,Wed Mar 11 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"There is so much here I agree with. I only differ in that I, personally, enjoyed not being spoon-fed the civil war consequences of the plot. I like films that assume its viewers are intelligent, capable human beings.   It's similar to a few complaints I've heard about Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I don't need to see the people of Naboo starving to understand what a trade blockade might do (ignore for the moment that an entire planet with lush flora and fauna can't feed itself...). Likewise, I don't need every World War II movie to show the storming of Normandy.   However, I get that a lot of people enjoy having it fleshed out in front of them, and go to movies to not have to think and connect the dots for themselves. That's cool, I'm not saying I'm right and they are wrong. Different folks/strokes."
JamesBond,2yoopa,pick-a-spot,2,Wed Mar 11 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"You could say ""infer but not show"" to lots of things.  There needed to be some kind of climax though.  There were so many angles they could've gone with this, such as showing MI6's internal reaction to the situation for one example.  I guess I would say that fighting Greene with an axe in a burning hotel isn't quite the climax that we would've had if there were better writers.  I loved the subtle understated approach by making a signature of a document a pivotal event, but there could've been something more with QoS."
JamesBond,2yoopa,Cut_the_dick_cheese,3,Wed Mar 11 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems we do disagree a bit.  Maybe I'm misremembering it, but it wasn't all that long ago I watched. However, wasn't this story more of a dual-revenge story where Camille and Bond seeking revenge on their respective enemies, who just happen to bump into each other as their individual missions converge? I don't remember this being an MI6 mission at all (which would have been borne out of turmoil of Greene's evil plans). It would make no difference if Greene and the new dictator (blanking on his name) were meeting at a weekly Bad Guy's Bridge Club game, the motives of both Camille and Bond were the same.  That's the way I see it, anyways. It's a revenge story that exists in a fully fleshed-out world, unlike something like Kill Bill, where the only exposition is backstory of the characters themselves, and there's no greater backdrop for the story to take place against."
JamesBond,2yoopa,2Fast2Finkel,2,Wed Mar 11 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"Your memory serves you well. It is a dual revenge tale. I think that's one reason it takes place so shortly after CR. Yes, I like what you say about it existing in a bigger, fleshed out world. I don't need an explanation of how the Death Star works when it exists in a world with blasters and lightsabers and starships capable of lightspeed."
JamesBond,2yoopa,arafinwe,2,Thu Mar 12 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"dual revenge tale   The funny thing is...Bond doesn't actually get revenge at the end. He lets the 'seducer' agent go.  His not even sure from the get go if it is a 'revenge mission'. His more hurting and confused. His not sure why or how Vesper betrayed him, or if she even did. He needs closure or solace.   But he does avenge Mathus and the 'oil covered' agent."

JamesBond,2yoopa,keysersoze1015,3,Thu Mar 12 00:15:05 2015 UTC,"You said everything perfectly, my friend. Thank you for taking the time to write that. I appreciate the contribution."
JamesBond,2yoopa,GetFreeCash,3,Wed Mar 11 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"I was really shocked when I found out people didn't like Quantum and they absolutely loved Skyfall.  Skyfall though cinematically beautiful went away from what the previous Craig movies had set up.  It was so annoying.  I liked the story line in Quantum the only, and I do mean ONLY thing I didn't appreciate was who the hell would go to a hotel in the middle of the desert?  What was the appeal of that place other than a sustainable hotel?  I didn't get how that seemed like a good idea, though it was an epic fight and had a little bit of everything Bond but not too over the top and unrealistic. I'm happy to see this so high up in this sub, though people rarely hate on it in here.  Unless someone grey up with Moore as their Bond I just don't see how they can hate on this film.  My other big problem with skyfall is they should have not made it so that his real name was James Bond.  I would rather it have been an identity that gets passed to new agents as they take over the role.  It would have made connecting the series so much easier and we could just ignore that he was ever married, even though his wife was killed as a different actor and just kept thinking ""that never happened to the other guy."""
JamesBond,2yoopa,keysersoze1015,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:25:29 2015 UTC,"To answer your disdain for the hotel, the cinematographer, I think, or someone in charge of such decisions designed 4 of the major action scenes after the 4 elements. The hotel in the desert being, well, fire. So in that sense in fine it to be pretty cool. It's in stark contrast with Blofeld's snow-capped, mountaintop resort in OHMSS. Which is cool. No pun intended.   But yeah, i jus replied to an opposing viewpoint and, while I respect it, I just can't find any validity in it.   Ehh, I guess part ways about the code name theory. I find it to be held together by a thin thread at best. It's refuted many times in the series. The film canon is: there is no canon. It's just a bunch of filmmakers re-adapting an old idea into an updated, new idea.   But I do agree, Skyfall is just not as much of a fun movie to watch. As I said before, it's a movie I feel like I need to be studying for a term paper on in film school. Well shot, good acting, good score, nothing really bad to say about it, just one I don't find a joy to watch."
JamesBond,2yoopa,keysersoze1015,2,Thu Mar 12 13:25:44 2015 UTC,The point you make about Felix is an important one.  I think that there was room for Felix to continue to be an important part of the franchise in Skyfall and omitting him was a real missed opportunity.
JamesBond,2yoopa,keysersoze1015,2,Wed Mar 11 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Oh totally! I want more Felix, dang it! And I want Geoffrey Wright. I hope his absence just means they're preserving his impact and saving him for future use but I want some more context to his character. I don't think he should be every Bond is but I could go for a... oh, let's call it a Felix Leiter booster shot."
JamesBond,2yoopa,pick-a-spot,3,Wed Mar 11 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"I quite like it as well, because of Felix and Mathis like you said. It also has my favorite interactions with M (only topped by Skyfall of course, but it's close). And I love that he didn't sleep with Camille.  I don't find it boring or underwhelming. My only beefs are rather minor, like the cartoonishly evil Medrano, impossibilities in Geography (that desert is at least a 9hr drive from La Paz, no way he could drive to Siena from the lake where the race was etc) and skipping over the crucial reveal with Greene in the car. Okay, that last one pisses me off a lot. How do you skip'over that!!!!!! It was the whole damn point!!! But yeah, I like it. Thanks for posting this."
JamesBond,2yoopa,UlfrGregsson,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:17:26 2015 UTC,"I was also satisfied by him not sleeping with Camille. Feels weird to say it but I agree. I'm thinking it's to do with Vesper. I mean, sure, there was Strawberry Fields but maybe she was just so irresistible (you know us redheads, wink wink). In the Casino Royale novel, Fleming talks about how deeply Bond lusted after Vesper and how he waited to make love to her after his injury healed. I can imagine, as a guy myself, how at some point the wait is unbearable and since Vesper is no longer around, well, you do the math. But it wasn't gonna be Camille, perhaps being a double agent herself it reminded him too much of Vesper.   As for Medrano? Eh, Greene needed a patsy. What can I say?  I didn't know about the distance inconsistency (dumb American).  And I think I'm missing what you mean about Greene in the car.  But you're very welcome! Thank YOU actually! I love the feedback I'm getting :) it's people like you that make me happy to be a fan and finally join this sub. Glad my thoughts don't fall on deaf ears and die alone haha. Nice to know others agree."
JamesBond,2yoopa,UlfrGregsson,3,Wed Mar 11 21:11:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the girl(s). Haha, as I see it, Fields was probably to make sure the plumbing worked after getting his heart broken, but then Camille was too close to home (double agent, confided personal stuff to him, ""damaged goods"" etc). So a kiss and nothing more works well for me.  Re: Greene, I mean this:   I answered your questions. I told you what you wanted to know about Quantum.   Well, I also wanted to know everything about Quantum! I realise the movie had to end, but it annoyed me a lot that we didn't get to hear any of the ~revelations Bond worked so hard to obtain."
JamesBond,2yoopa,StylishLu,2,Wed Mar 11 22:05:33 2015 UTC,"Haha yes, all is how I see it in my head as well.   Oh okay, the tell all moment. Result of the writer's strike maybe? Or were we to believe there was going to be more to Quantum in the coming movie(s)? Either way, it seems Quantum is all but a distant past now with, well... who am I to speculate if Spectre is actually Spectre or not, yanno? Will Quantum come up? Are they a subsidiary? We're they just a template organisation? Do they have a good dental plan? These are questions."
JamesBond,2yoopa,akanefive,3,Wed Mar 11 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't exactly hate it, but CR and Skyfall are much better. It was going OK until they revealed the plan to take over water, THE MOST ABUNDANT RESOURCE ON THE EARTH! Skyfall's plot was ridiculous and supervillain-y, yes, but CR and QoS weren't going for that, they were going for grounded. At that point, I was like ""OK. I'm done."" I enjoyed the stunts and really enjoyed that brief Bourne-esque fight. Definitely not the worst Bond film, it's a very enjoyable watch, actually. As a standalone film it's great, comparing it to other Bond films, though, it was meh. It just wasn't anywhere near CR, imo."
JamesBond,2yoopa,GetFreeCash,2,Wed Mar 11 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"Skyfall's plot was ridiculous and supervillain-y   One qualm I have about Skyfall was that the villain's motivation (get revenge on M and MI6 in general) wasn't ridiculous or over the top, but the execution of said motivation required substantial amounts of disbelief to be suspended. With QoS it was more of a gentle letdown that Greene was after the water in Bolivia."
JamesBond,2yoopa,akanefive,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"Well see, you just said it, you weren't expecting water to be the McGuffin. The twist worked. In a micro way it shows the repercussions of what Greene's plan would entail. Sure it leaves some things to the theater of the mind but there's worse things a movie can do. The plot was believable somewhat plausible to me, within reason of course. And given the circumstances with the film industry at the time, I think they pulled it together quite well. And that's the other thing, change the title to something else and alter all the names and you have a good movie. Objectively. I just want people stop comparing it to the others and making it seem bad by association."
JamesBond,2yoopa,BigWaz,3,Wed Mar 11 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"No, it wasn't a Macguffin. That's not what a macguffin is. A macguffin would be the briefcase in Ronin, the cure for the disease in MI:2, etc. It didn't work, the villains plan in a Bond movie isn't really a twist, because you're already expecting something ridiculous going in. A twist is a surprise. Greene's plan was a surprise, in a horrible way. I said out loud ""That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard!"" In a movie that aims for realism, the plan shouldn't be implausible. Not only is monopolizing water both physically and legally impossible, it's pretty freaking stupid. Most Bond movie plots are implausible and stupid, that's part of the charm. QoS and CR were going in the opposite direction, plausible and grounded, until QoS decided it didn't want to anymore.  Edit: The thing is, it isnt a different movie, it's part of the Bond franchise, it will be compared, as it should, it's a series. While I would say it's a work of art compared to Moonraker, it was underwhelming in respect to CR. And since QoS directly followed and began minutes after the end of CR, those two can and should be directly compared."
JamesBond,2yoopa,BondGirl20,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, I just wanted to say MacGuffin. Well I can't really argue, I mean, you didn't like it. That's fair, I don't agree, but it's fair.   I see the absurdity as a positive. I'm one of those people that love the Sam Raimi Spiderman trilogy. I just don't see why that has to make it a bad film. Like I said about Kingsman, it brings up a good point about Bond movies being too serious. If QoS has a wildly crazy plot riddled with implausibility then i'm game! The goal is plain evil. I dunno, man, I like Quantum of Solace."
JamesBond,2yoopa,BondGirl20,2,Wed Mar 11 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm all for ridiculous. I love all the Connery movies except for Diamonds. I loved Kingsman (no sequel, we riot) and except for 3 the Rami trilogy is awesome. The thing is both the movies were trying to say ""Hey, Die Another Day was too much ad placement and CG, here's a more real-world Bond."" CR did it very very well, and QoS was doing it right up until that point, then it totally contradicted the tone of the previous hour of the movie, as well as the movie before. It took me straight out of the movie. The point of Kingsman, Connery, and Rami was outlandish fun, but that wasn't the point of CR or QoS. To be fair, it's one of my only problems with the movie, but it's a BIG problem for me."
JamesBond,2yoopa,BondGirl20,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:02:12 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with where Kingsman stands but I'm not against a sequel. I feel the same about John Wick. Really enjoyed it, I don't really feel a sequel is necessary, yet we're getting one and I will still see it and most likely enjoy it as well. It's the old ""if it does well, there shall be more"" rule. So you didn't even like the Sandman sub-plot? One of the film's whopping 503 sub-plots.   I hear you though, it went against the quite publicized intent of a more serious Bond. I guess I see that as life imitating art or poetic justice or something. Because you take a look a Fleming's work and a book like Casino Royale then flash forward to, oh... I don't know, Goldfinger? The differences are pretty stark. Bad example maybe but I respect the going against the grain."
JamesBond,2yoopa,wrestlingfan007,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:45:30 2015 UTC,"Wellll your edit makes a good point. I can't argue there. Look at the Batman movies, they're all over the place. I find the combo to be awesome. Just like I like Dr. No followed by From Russia With Love."
JamesBond,2yoopa,eoinster,2,Thu Mar 12 00:09:02 2015 UTC,"Dr. No/From Russia with Love and the Batman films are extremely consistent tonally, the Batman movies were written and directed by the same dude, he knew exactly where he was going. Or are you talking all the Batmans?CR was a reboot of the canon, much like the TDK trilogy. As such, now that I think about it, you are right in that it's unfair to compare the three Craig films to the many others that came before, as it's supposed to be a clean slate. CR/QoS/Skyfall/Spectre (when released) can be compared though because they all share the same canon. I didn't really like QoS in comparison to CR, but that doesn't make it a bad film. As I said, it's a mostly enjoyable flick. Great post, and you have some great points, it gave me stuff to think about. Thanks!  Edit: concerning Skyfall, while I think it kept some of the tonal aspects from the previous two, it totally said ""screw you"" to realism. But that was established right away, it never contradicted itself in the way QoS did."
JamesBond,2yoopa,GetFreeCash,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I meant Schumacher and Nolan too. Eh, I try not to apply canon to the JB franchise like I do with Star Wars.

It's enriching to hear different perspectives, however apprehensive one might be at first. Good deal."
JamesBond,2yoopa,eoinster,3,Thu Mar 12 01:43:46 2015 UTC,"Your comments about the fast cuts...i agree.  If you watch the Bourne action scenes side by side with  the QoS scenes the difference is apparent; the Bourne cuts are to demonstrate quick reflexes and skills and bonds cuts are for anger, ruthlessness and ""single-mindedness'.  It's great how they played with weather  bond had gone over the edge throughout the film (moreso then in a licence to kill) ; he 'killed' a 'special branch'  dude and there was the 'capture or kill order'  as bond was going against British & American  interests.   At the end, you realise, Bond didn't even care about Greene at the start. He just wanted him for the vesper info he had.   I'v watched this film about 10 times. It's now my favourite bond movie. How many Action movies have you seen where the audience intentionally doesn't know the villains plan or what the protagonist wants or what state of mind he is in. You only know for sure at the end of the film. And it turns out the villain's plan itself was secondary.   I think the  writers strike made this film more difficult to absorb but even more interesting for subsequent viewings.  On my first sitting I forgot how bond dismissed wanting to chase after vespers 'lover' right at the start. They needed to show bond being dismissive of it but to just flash a photograph with one line was really not enough for anyone watching for the first time (or not watching casino royale the day before). If you missed that, then the subsequent ruthlessness of bonds revenge plot would seem pretty confusing and pointless."
JamesBond,2yoopa,adventcrash,2,Wed Mar 11 22:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. I see the quick cuts as an extension of Bond's psyche at the time. Giving that they're so uncharacteristic and unprecedented for a Bond movie(?).   And that is awesome! I'm so glad you love this movie :) this is what I like to and wanted to hear. I agree with everything. It has gotten better with every subsequent viewing. After having both the book and film Casino Royale fresh in my mind, it's a bittersweet punctuation mark on the Casino Royale storyline. Dare I say poignant, subtlety so."
JamesBond,2yoopa,adventcrash,3,Wed Mar 11 23:20:03 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree more. The villain was shallow and uninspired, as was the bond girl. Coming off of the remade LeChiffre, who was awesome (brilliant, wept blood, could match James Bond in poker, yet also deeply flawed and indebted), Greene felt so flat and boring. The bond girl had some vague background about her father dying, and had very little dialogue or screen time to make you even slightly interested.  Felix was probably the only bright spot in this movie, and the very forced attempt at being the older style Bond right after CR came out was completely lame. The shadowy organization went from feeling very real and modern day terroristic, to being a comical farce of what the Cold War era SPECTRE was.   TL;DR don't worry, your original opinions of the movie were right: it sucks."
JamesBond,2yoopa,GetFreeCash,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:26:20 2015 UTC,"The standard talking points that always go around. Oh Le Chiffre was better, Vesper was better, the original trilogy was better. I'm just not interested. Whether you like Greene or not, Mathieu Amalric's performance was great. Uninspired is also inaccurate, I feel, because he is inspired by all the real world philanthropist douchebags that aim to change the world by lining their own pockets. Never mind who they hurt in the process.   And I don't know about you but I don't really look for substance in a Bond girl. Besides that I don't agree about her being a weak character, she parallels Bond in her motives of revenge. Is CR the better movie? I would probably lynch myself if I said it wasn't. But that's what I want people to stop doing, comparing it. It's not a bad movie. Granted the writing wasn't perfect given the writer's strike, but you can not sit there and say it's a badly shot film nor a badly acted film.   And before you bring up the action cuts, I see those as a stylistic extension of Bond's mentality at the time. I just want people to stop pigeonholing this as such an atrocity.  It's not Die Another Day bad and it's not Moonraker-level absurd. And I think the whole point of Quantum was that it was rather small and not Spectre. The hate is unjustified."
JamesBond,2yoopa,Chilblain,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:02:28 2015 UTC,"I found it boring and contrived, even without the shadow of CR. Of course people had huge expectations after that film, but Quantum just did have anything interesting.

That said, I find it quite entertaining. I'm not crazy about the opening titles, but I love the location titles when Bond arrives in a new spot. I love the silence in the opera scene. I love the car chase opening. But the plot shifts from being overly complicated to being nonexistent. (Who's Guy Haines? Why is he important?)

It could mean the fact that Tracy runs away from him in apparent disgust, or it could mean the fact that random henchmen appeared out of nowhere to fight Bond (which wouldn't make much sense as that happened on numerous occasions in the Connery era) - or it could just be a nice fourth-wall-breaking meta reference to Lazenby not being Sean Connery.

JamesBond,2ypim2,GetFreeCash,3,Thu Mar 12 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, the director of Die Another Day (which as you know is a film I thoroughly despise) actually wanted to incorporate the codename theory into said film, thus cementing it as part of canon forever.  The films For Your Eyes Only and Licence To Kill, despite neither featuring Lazenby in the lead role, make very obvious references to Tracy di Vicenzo and Bond being married to her. Which might throw a proverbial wrench in your codename theory. Not to mention Skyfall firmly establishes the parentage of James Bond in the third act of that film."
JamesBond,2ypim2,Smileyjoe72,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"There are arguments to be made for this but it cuts both ways. In some cases Bond will make reference to things that happened to another Bond as if they happened to him. In other cases there will be little nods to changes in the Bonds. Part of the issue here is that different directors / screenwriters probably had different opinions on the matter. Some time back there was an anecdote on here about one director wanting to have the other Bonds visit Bond but the producers (?) shot it down.   Not to discourage anyone from watching movies however they want to, but my advice for Bond is to just sit back and enjoy the ride."

JamesBond,2ypim2,GetFreeCash,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"As for what to watch next? If you haven't seen any others you should watch Goldfinger. It's classic Connery and whether or not you love it, you need to see it. My advice would be at a minimum (if you don't plan on watching them all) is to watch one from each actor / decade. Bond movies--for better or worse--tend to try to be very current and very cutting edge so they tend to showcase their time period (or films from their time period really well).   Others will disagree but it probably looks something like this (note that I love all of the movies in their own way so this is in no way knocking the ones I don't list):  60s/Connery: Goldfinger (Though From Russia with Love and Thunderball are also quite good)  60s/Lazenby: On Her Majesty's Secret Service  70s/Moore: The Spy Who Loved Me (there are lots of options for Moore that range from silly to serious but this is a classic Bond movie in structure)  80s/Moore: You're fine skipping Octopussy and A View to a Kill until later  80s/Dalton: The Living Daylights  90s/Brosnan: GoldenEye  2000s/Brosnan: Skip Die Another Day  2000s/Craig: Casino Royal (and if you like it then watch Quantum of Solace immediately after)  If you end up watching them in order then you should pay special attention to the years they were made. Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball were all released within a year of the previous, which is crazy. And the gaps between some movies are notable."

I've noticed on many subreddits that if the writing is sloppy or just stupid the fans and writers of the junk will make statements like: ""It's a different timeline, blah, blah, blah."" They use it for Bond, Trek and Doctor Who.  Lazy writing and poor production doth not a ""Timeline"" make. It's a series and all the actors are playing the same James Bond."

And going along with that, they should've made a movie out of Everything or Nothing--which is a considerably better story, if still far-fetched.  I understand the dislike for DAD, obviously, but to be honest, I never understood why TWINE and TND are so loathed. The worst thing I can say about TWINE is that select parts of it are boring, but the characters and story are pretty cool. The worst thing I can say about TND is that the premise is pretty weird (still not like-DAD level though), but the action and set-pieces are pretty cool."

They're both safe movies, unwilling to mess with the status quo of the franchise. Now we see M dying, Bond falling in love with a double agent, etc... More risks are being taken with the stories, for the better.  Additionally, while they're both decent movies, but there were action movies in the 90's doing that stuff better than Bond. The Fugitive, The Rock, True Lies were all out Bond-ing Bond. Even the batshit crazy Face/Off is a worthy 90's action movie. But that's because it made these crazy choices. And Die Another Day tried that in '02, but at that point, that kind of action movie seemed stale."

I enjoy TND, but this is gonna sound really weird but I think the Direction was weak - if that makes any sense. I though he failed to really capture a sense of emotion and everything looked very plain. I personally liked Elliot Carver as a villain and thought his plan was pretty neat. The scene with Dr. Kaufman was one of the finest in the entire series, credit where credit is due.  TWINE...could've had 30 minutes of Scenes with Denise Richards cut and and it would've been incredible. They had a goldfingermine of solid acting from Carlyle's Renard - I would have watched an entire movie of him alone. All things considered, TWINE had the chance to be a very solid entry into the franchise, but it just...wasn't. The only other complaint was the pre-credits sequence was wayyyy to long. It should've ended after he blew the bank.  Edit: some spelling"

The writing was very ""convenient"" with a script full of one-liners and dialogue setting up those one-liners. As someone mentioned before, the film was fresh and people were ready for this new Bond of the 90's. Luckily it also had Martin Campbell at it's helm and Bronson looks like he came out the womb wearing a 3 button suit, otherwise the film may not have turned out so well.  Being that GE is widely considered the best of the Bronson films indicates the quality of the them. I read somewhere that PB has expressed dissatisfaction with Brocoli and Wilson over the choices made with his films."

I will say that I'm still wary about Madeleine Swann being the Tracy di Vicenzo of the rebooted Craig timeline, as evidenced by the final scene being Bond and Madeleine driving away together and him saying ""We have all the time in the world"". Based purely on what I read in the leaked scripts, their relationship didn't seem strong enough to warrant Bond leaving the Service for this woman, so I don't know if it will translate to something compelling on screen."
JamesBond,2ypjrm,GetFreeCash,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that they really just want to add some depth to the character and make the romances a little more believable in the more modern era of story-telling that is much more personal versus the 60s/70s.  There's no way they'll have Bond leave the service IMO, they already had the attempt with Vesper in the movies and return, and then fake death to join MI6 again in Skyfall, so it's too soon for those BS shenanigans! I'm hoping this is a straight forward flick that focuses more on bond's character than previously, and doesn't mess with whether or not Bond will stay with MI6 except for some sort of cliff-hanger ending and the gunshot stating ""BOND WILL BE BACK!""  I'm also really curious if Mr. Hinx will have any cheesy specialties other than being hulking and huge - they didn't have that in the script but it would be great if he had a bionic eye or something."

JamesBond,2yq5yf,WaddleBuff,6,Wed Mar 11 21:57:09 2015 UTC,"Code name theory is absolute rubbish. Always had been, always will be. Even back in the day it held no water. We just need to accept that a film franchise exists in a world where the actors age. Unlike a book or comic where everything can stay the same in a suspended timeline. James Bond is a character, the films adapt to the contemporary and the will of the filmmakers. Not being able to use the biggest villain, or organization, of the Bond franchise for something like 40 plus years, I think?, kinda makes the heart not want to squander the opportunity to reintroduce the elements in some way, shape, or form. So thank you for not wanting to legitimize that bonkers theory. I also can't see trying to put a narrative together to string all the films as a single piece of canon. With the exception of a few films, each new film or new Bond, is essentially its own reboot of the franchise. There's no other legitimate way to put it. This is what I believe.   That being said, I think you're right that it's not Blofeld. I mean he could be ""Blofeld"" but not Blofeld. If you catch my meaning. His son though? I don't see that working. Being that CR is a reboot, Bond could not have met even Blofeld Sr. yet. If the Craig films are chronological, that is. At any rate, Waltz is going to knock the role out of the park so I'm not worried about who he truly turns out being at all."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,jamedudijench,4,Thu Mar 12 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"Casino Royale is a reboot though, Craigs films are seperated.   Waltz has said hes NOT Blofeld"

If Waltz ends up being Blofeld, which I think it likely, then it will be unrelated to the 60's character.  Regardless of the references to the past continuity in Skyfall, Craig's Bond is continuity 2.0. Connery/ Lazenby is 1.0, Moore is 1.2, Dalton/ Brosnan is 1.3, in my opinion.

JamesBond,2yq5yf,cobysev,-1,Tue Mar 17 22:59:55 2015 UTC,That is debatable. And there are many things in the Craig movies that show it isn't a complete reboot. It's best not to think of a cohesive continuity for the Bond films. They screwed that up years ago.  It's just best to think that whoever is playing Bond has done all the missions that we've seen beforehand spiritually in some sense (with the exception of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace as those were clearly his first two outings).
JamesBond,2yq5yf,raysweater,0,Thu Mar 12 00:51:13 2015 UTC,So you are saying that CR and QOS are set before?   This really doesnt add up lol
JamesBond,2yq5yf,ILendMyAxeToAll,-1,Thu Mar 12 11:31:48 2015 UTC,How doesn't it add up? He wasn't a Double-O agent at the start of Casino Royale then became one. It was his first mission.

My timeline: Casino Royale, QoS, Dr. No - Die Another Day, Skyfall.  There is no concrete timeline. You can say stuff like ""it's a complete reboot"" (even though there is evidence that contradicts that). You're still wrong.  In reality, every time a new Bond actor debuts, it's a soft reboot of the franchise."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,raysweater,-2,Thu Mar 12 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is what has been said. However, Skyfall blows that out of the water with its subtle references to the classic series. For example, why is Craig so attached to his DB5? How does he know about its gadgets, such as the ejector seat and the twin machine guns, unless he is the Bond from Goldfinger?   Oh, then we can assume that the possibility of him being Blofeld's son is higher."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,BraveEyefilms,3,Wed Mar 11 22:32:11 2015 UTC,Well he did win that DB5 in CR and it is more than likely he had Q-Branch equip the car with all the bells and whistles.

JamesBond,2yq5yf,sweetjohnnycage,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:51:00 2015 UTC,"To this day, I refute the reboot, regardless of what anyone says from the Bond camp. Casino Royale was his first story that was never told on the screen. If you follow that line of thinking, it makes a lot more sense. I feel like Judi Dench as M was done because she was amazing in the role, but she doesn't necessarily have to be Brosnan's M. Think of it like Jack Wade in GoldenEye and Brad Whitaker in The Living Daylights. Same actor, different roles."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,akanefive,2,Wed Mar 11 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"This line of thinking means that the Cold War took place between QoS and Skyfall.  I think the implication in Skyfall is that Bond has been an active agent between QoS and Skyfall, not that all the other films happened between movies."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,sweetjohnnycage,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:59:01 2015 UTC,"I most certainly believe that Skyfall is not meant to take place anywhere near CR/QoS. There is no connection to those stories. In fact, I think QoS is the only direct sequel in the entire series."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,akanefive,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:23:25 2015 UTC,"I may be misunderstanding your original point, then. If the reboot doesn't happen, and you fit CR into the original chronology, it would have to be first, followed by QoS. Where do the other films fit?"
JamesBond,2yq5yf,sweetjohnnycage,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"After CR/QoS. CR/QoS is pretty much one movie as Quantum starts minutes after Bond finds Mr. White. So take that as Bond's first adventure.  Pretty much every other story happens after that. Sure the technology and everything is updated, but you'll notice that there's no references to the war in the middle east, or any other real-world conflicts in either CR/QoS (that I can remember, at least).  The early Bond films relied on the Cold War because that's when spies became something of mystique and wonder. Plus, it was a great storyline to have SPECTRE manipulating both the Allies and Russians against each other (one I miss). But it was never implied that Bond was anything but seasoned by the time those missions came about. There's not a ton of continuity aside from the supporting members of MI6, who also have different actors in different films."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,akanefive,2,Thu Mar 12 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"They discuss 9/11 in Casino Royale. And M says, ""Christ, I miss the Cold War."" I'm sorry, I don't think this works - CR is too much about terrorism to place it anywhere but in a post-9/11 universe, and there are too many early films where the Cold War is an important element for this to work without erasing major points of the films.  That said, they're movies, and we should each enjoy them however we want."
JamesBond,2yq5yf,sweetjohnnycage,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmm yea I guess I forgot about those. I'm still just going to blindly believe what I want to believe because I largely think reboots are stupid, especially in the case of Bond.

Casino Royale is the first Bond story. It just happened to have been made by Craig. Sure, he nailed it, but Connery or Dalton could have done it too. It's at best, a flashback. It always seemed to me that the first 3 Craigs were meant to be some sort of deep, dark trilogy. If they are indeed going back to formula in Spectre this may be true. Or it may just be lousy writing.

He's the right age to be Bond when Craig is done, he's getting more well known but not enormously so, and most importantly he's already shown himself to be capable of displaying a wide range of the characteristics often associated with James Bond."

JamesBond,2yll2i,dragonsky,3,Tue Mar 10 23:30:24 2015 UTC,He can't be Bond he's already Superman. /s  But seriously I would prefer a relative unknown to play Bond.
JamesBond,2yll2i,busybagel,2,Tue Mar 10 21:17:33 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with him as a Bond but it won't happen
JamesBond,2yll2i,busybagel,2,Wed Mar 11 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Very possible.  He's 31 right now, and he'll probably be 38 when his first Bond film would come out."
JamesBond,2yll2i,Seesawkarma,2,Wed Mar 11 16:27:16 2015 UTC,He just seems to big physically to me for the role.  Bond can be tall but he shouldn't be superman huge.  I'm rooting for Michael Fassbender but since that probably won't happen my other choice is Travis Fimmel from Vikings they way he plays Ragnar I think he could pull off a great Bond
JamesBond,2yll2i,busybagel,2,Tue Mar 10 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Hm...I don't know, Michael Fassbender seems more like a villain typecast for me. He just has that...villainous visage. As for Travis Fimmel...I really, really don't see what you see. He's bigger than Henry Cavill and he definitely doesn't have the ""Bond face"".  Concerning the ""Superman"" look...have you seen the trailer to ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""? He pulls of the secret agent look flawlessly. He doesn't even look like Superman."

JamesBond,2yggpb,keysersoze1015,6,Mon Mar 9 16:50:14 2015 UTC,"I've always interpreted Silva's laugh to be astonishment. That's the point at which he finally learns that Skyfall is connected to Bond. Up until that point, he must be wondering why Bond and M picked such a desolate spot for their last stand.  With the earlier dialogue between M and Silva, and Silva and Bond, that serve to indicate that both characters developed similar, strong relationships (bordering on the maternal) with M, this moment where it all clicks in Silva's mind must be deliciously ironic. This is where it all ends: the Bond family graveyard chapel.  It's unspoken, but I would guess he's thinking, ""You brought Mommy home to die, James?"""
JamesBond,2yggpb,DeadLucky,8,Mon Mar 9 19:35:03 2015 UTC,I have no idea but I think I'd prefer the idea of them being just normal folk who died on accident together more than than them being spies. I like the idea of Bond being an orphan who was plucked out of nowhere.

The movie production team found the restaurant partly constructed, and financially contributed to its completion in return for exclusive use for filming the movie (released in 1969), where the building is shown quite prominently.  Afterwards, the restaurant retained the Piz Gloria name of the film location, and currently acknowledges the film's significant contribution to its commercial reputation; it features a James Bond exhibition, containing memorabilia and film clips, in the lower floor."

They just feel convincing, the others are way too slow and clunky. Also have to laugh at Connery having balancing issues with his right leg after firing his pistol after Thunderball. I mean seriously, could they not have reshot the sequence?"
JamesBond,2y6fp5,Dakolias,9,Fri Mar 6 23:01:44 2015 UTC,I will always love the Craig one in Casino Royale because it's so unique and the first time it played a part in the story. Brosnan was also really solid. I always loved that the first three films wasn't even Connery but his stunt man.
JamesBond,2y6fp5,Seesawkarma,3,Fri Mar 6 23:51:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgive the outlandish Casino Royale one because of the whole reboot thing.

JamesBond,2y6fp5,Seesawkarma,3,Sat Mar 7 11:57:24 2015 UTC,"Early Moore? Jesus, he takes the wildest shot in those lol. Looks like he shot someone standing 50 feet to the right in the knee."

But in all honesty, most of them could've been done better (though on second viewing, I remembered I liked Lazenby's unique crouch-shot and the Dalton ones). I find Brosnan's most convincing because he does it with such speed and determination.   I never really counted the Craig ones because the Casino Royale one is not a traditional sequence and the other two are placed at the end of their respective films."
JamesBond,2y6fp5,Seesawkarma,3,Sat Mar 7 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Brosnan seems very deliberate, I love the way he pivots on both feet like a dance move. Really adds to the scene. But I also hate his silhouette at the end, feels like it leans over too much.  And I also really liked Moore's holding-arm style. And I really liked Lazenby's drop knee until I realised it probably makes it easier to get a head shot on him.   My favourite (despite it being at the end of the movie ""Boo!"", and being way to fast) is probably QoS. I love the silhouette at the end, it's perfect and they fuck it up in Skyfall.   I see them like:  Bob guy whoever: Jumpy agent spin shot.  Connery: Flashy quick draw guy.  Lazenby: Gangster hip shot  Moore 1: Wild man braced shot.  Moore 2: How to properly shoot a pistol guy.  Dalton:  Ballroom dancer assassin  Brosnan: Smooth criminal assassin  Craig 1: 1st time killer!  Craig 2: Angry assassin head shot  Craig 3: The retired cop"

In the description of the video I talk about the fact that Fleming may have had other ideas about this drink when he described it in the books. I choose to interpret it this way, but contextually given the vocabulary of the era (it's listed as a ""Perfect Martini"", not a Medium-Dry Martini in the 1947 Stork Club Bar Book, the same book that had one of the earliest references to a Kangaroo Kicker) and the fact that Bond and Leiter seem to be referring to a single bottle of vermouth, it would most likely mean that this Martini was supposed to be made with more vermouth and not the usual ""bone-dry"" recipe.  However, it's left up to interpretation and a whole lot more fun to make the double vermouth version. The Medium-Dry Martini or the ""Perfect Martini"" is a really good cocktail and one that has unfortunately fallen out of fashion. I choose to believe. Haha. Cheers!"

Yes, I subscribe to the theory that Dr Christmas Jones was a last-minute addition to the screenplay of TWINE after everyone realized Bond ended the movie without getting the girl (the horror!), as evidenced by the fact that whatever Christmas does in her scenes could have been handwaved away by making Bond do it."

JamesBond,2y2o7h,pinkpanthers,3,Fri Mar 6 00:29:19 2015 UTC,I suppose. Part of my problem is that I love Vesper so much and having Camille be her follow up was just a let down.

If you ask the average Joe to name a Bond Girl, Pussy will be called out more than any other one. But she was a cold, frigid character that showed no charisma with Bond, at least until he date rapes her and turns her straight. She's also the oldest Bond girl ever, and doesn't even run the show as a Bond villain, mainly working as Goldfinger's #2. If her name hadn't been PUSSY GALORE, she would have been forgotten by most."

Only memorable because of her death."
JamesBond,2y0q0c,sigersen,16,Thu Mar 5 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"Objectively, it's not a great movie. The plot is a mess and the acting is really weak. That said, the production design is incredible - the penthouse is a really great Ken Adam set, smaller than the You Only Live Twice volcano, obviously, but very impressive. And I love the score.   It's a really flawed movie, but it's fun to watch from time to time."
JamesBond,2y0q0c,akanefive,8,Thu Mar 5 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good summary of DAF.  The plot just makes no sense, the Tiffany Case character totally changes personalities halfway through the movie from ""smart badass criminal"" to ""idiot damsel in distress"", it's full of goofs like the infamous Mustang that enters the alley on it's right wheels and leaves it on it's left wheels, etc.  But still, it's a fun movie to watch.  Great set design, the whole Willlard Whyte/Howard Hughes thing, the fake moon landing set, the whole idea of Bond in Vegas, Blofeld's oil rig headquarters and it's awesome countdown guy (""Two minutes and countink""), Jill St. John and Lana Wood both look great, and even though it wasn't Connery's best performance, it's still Connery.  I think some of you have higher expectations than I do for these movies.  A lot of them have nonsensical plots and improbable gags and dumb jokes.  They also have action and fun.  The Bond series isn't meant to be Schindler's List, they are supposed to be fun, semi-fantasy action spy flicks.  As such, I'm able to find something to appreciate in all of them."

JamesBond,2y0q0c,adventcrash,6,Thu Mar 5 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"It feels especially dated because of the overall gay stereotyping - it's not just Wynt and Kidd, who are just, uh, problematic, but Blofeld in drag too. It's a product of its time, I guess.   Jill St. John is a beautiful woman but her acting varies. She's appropriately sexy and mysterious in the first scene in the apartment. Then, ""You just killed James Bond!"" Awful line (oh, a low level smuggler knows British secret agents by name?) but the delivery makes it even worse. Later Bond misjudges his own charms on her, expecting her to show up to run off. I guess this is a flip on the Pussy Galore magically turning good (and possibly straight) due to Bond's charms, but it just feels lame.  Plenty O'Toole? Good God. The mafioso stereotypes? Ugh.   Bond in Vegas and they send him to the Tropicana and Circus Circus? Christ. He could have been in the Sands playing baccarat.  But the opening scene - Bond is kicking ass to find Blofeld and it's angry and great. Jimmy Dean is fun but not in the film until it's too late. Bambi and Thumper, totally cool but again, one scene. Bond bluffing his way into the HQ as an inspector, and stealing a moon buggy? Great.  There are pleasures to be had here - it's certainly an improvement on YOLT, which is at the bottom of my personal list - but it's an OK outing.  Funny how seeing one as a child changes your opinion though. I saw Moonraker as my first Bond in the theater and I am a glass-half-full guy when it comes to that film."

JamesBond,2y0q0c,akanefive,3,Thu Mar 5 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"I rather like it, partly because of the story behind it, and how much it cost UA to bring back Sean Connery.  The story is a bit campy, however it's one of my favorite film/book combinations."
JamesBond,2y0q0c,pdmcmahon,3,Thu Mar 5 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"While objectively it's a poor film, it is just so damn fun. Wint and Kidd's homosexual, menacing quips, Connery's swagger, the big bright Vegas setting and a captivatingly mad Blofeld (although the drag is a little far.)  It's fun to watch with tongue firmly in cheek, and I love the theory that Blofeld has gone totally insane after being bested by 007 one time too many, to the point where him and his doubles don't even know which is which. (There's an extension to this theory where Bond killed the real Blofeld at the start, and the one he battles is an insane double).  If you want a serious film, there are loads to choose from, but as OTT Bond goes, DAF is surely number one, even over Moonraker.  EDIT: Because I pressed submit too soon."
JamesBond,2y0q0c,RABIDSAILOR,3,Thu Mar 5 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest it's my favorite Bond movie. I like its ironic or sarcastic style, the overall ""we don't care"" attitude, the greasy atmosphere. It's not a Bond movie, it's more a parody of a Bond movie.  The movie is as superficial and jaded as its Las Vegas/America setting. Somewhere between the extremes of the admiring ""Oceans 11"" and the harsh ""Casino"". A very cynical European view on the Circus America and its clowns like Shady Tree."

Although I like Brosnan, he turned in a similar level of effort for Die Another Day and it didn't come ANYWHERE near as watchable as Connery here. (Granted, he wasn't the only thing wrong with that movie.)  As pointed out by others, the acting isn't there, with a few exceptions (Wint and Kidd, and sue me, I liked Jimmy Dean), but the crew did a really good job, namely Barry, Ken Adam, and I'll even give a nod to Guy Hamilton."

Craig is just  a Jason Bourne Mock -up. You can debate literary accuracy all you want. The Bond of the books is not a fun guy and EON knew this at the start. My analogy is this: Jeremy Brett is the most accurate portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. As a Holmes geek I would happily go to see Brett's Holmes at the movies. But most casual Holmes fans would much prefer Basil Rathbone, who was the Holmes actor of his day and while still accurate was much more ""approachable"" to the general public.  Connery was so popular because he struck the perfect balance between suave Man-About-Town and Killing Machine. The current writers just don't understand this."

Heck, I remember when DAD came out and people were talking about how great it was and how they loved the new direction of Bond. Now its considered dead last.

A great films sandwiched by two total Aardvarks.  The Man with the Golden Gun was my first Bond film I saw (only partially) and I had NO frame of reference when I was a kid.

JamesBond,2xwq81,Cleanatwork,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:35:37 2015 UTC,"I agree - Diamonds Are Forever is a bit weird in that respect. I'm not sure if SPECTRE is mentioned in OHMSS either, but Diamonds seems more like a well-organized operation, and if I remember correctly the guy counting down until Washington is destroyed is credited as 'SPECTRE No. 6'. Although, the article does mention that continuity started to break down around that time in the franchise. Or at least they were less concerned with making the stories serialized and starting to gear things towards an episodic format."

JamesBond,2xvfua,TheGreatBatsby,3,Wed Mar 4 07:41:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is, there seems to be like 3 people a week suggesting the code name theory as if they've just come up with it independently. It doesn't make sense, and it's been Jossed (to borrow a phrase from tvtropes).  I don't really get the sense that they'll ever cast a non-white male from the UK as James Bond - keep in mind that the studio in the 70's and 80's wanted an American actor to take over from Connery and Moore. It never happened.   And Idris Elba is about the same age as Daniel Craig, who contracted for this film and one more. There's no way they would then cast someone the same age to replace him. They'll go younger."
JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:09:41 2015 UTC,Moore is older than Connery.
JamesBond,2xvfua,AUBalrog,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"True, but would it really make sense to cast someone for 3-4 movies when they're already 49 years old?

JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"I think he'd be a great transitional bond, kind of like what Dalton became. He could possible be on board for a couple movies, although I think he'd be better as a spinoff series with Phoenix, with Craig making a few appearances."
JamesBond,2xvfua,AUBalrog,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty anti-spinoff series. It always seems like a cash grab. That said - if Elba showed up as an ally in Craigs final Bond film, then went off and had some of his own adventures, I would totally be on board."
JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"I can accept that, and it wouldn't be a cash crab, but to create a back-up in case the bond series falters after Craig."

I must credit another redditor on this sub that brought up an idea which I like that is an HBO or Netflix type television series, not movie, that adapts the books as is in the time period set within. True, classic Bond. If done right, i think that would have the potential of making the movies look like cheap spinoffs. Period television can be done very well nowadays. I dunno, if forced to make a choice, modern spinoff film or classic spinoff television series, i'm going tv for sure."
JamesBond,2xvfua,jamedudijench,2,Thu Mar 5 18:32:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I don't think it would make sense to have both. And I don't think it will ever happen, but I would watch the crap out of a period Bond Netflix series."
JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,3,Thu Mar 5 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly the code name theory is complete shite. Many movies throw a wrench at the very idea. That being said, the roles are obviously arbitrary, they have to be. This thing is over 50 years old! If M can change sex, Moneypenny can change race, and Q can change age, can we quit making a big deal about the prospect of a new Bond. It's inevitable and comes with the series, we know this."

JamesBond,2xvfua,AUBalrog,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"See, I just, I find trying to do that all a bit absurd. You and I both know the producers just always adapt to be topical. A Cold War era spy story can't possibly exist for 50+ years without changing. I'm not saying we must mandate a black Bond, that would be wrong to do it just to spite. I think they should pick the best actor for the job. If he's black, so what, but besides that, why cheat another new franchise out of a cool, black character, I say. The point is the actors have to be arbitrary. They haven't exactly been loyal to the character. Why else would Daniel Craig have blonde hair if they casted to the number? Bond's traits are well established. And even in your theory, the time periods then become arbitrary. There is no timeline. EON is making do now establishing itself but what's it gonna be in 20 years? Probably nowhere near what the last few movies set up. Different directors, different directions. It's why Star Wars had to scrap all the excess material, trying it fit in something new and still be loyal to everything else is difficult to say the least.   TL;DR: I don't see making an established Bond film timeline as being a possibility."

JamesBond,2xvfua,terrymcginnisbeyond,5,Sun Mar 8 22:27:24 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd like to find out if there's a push from the black community or any other community for a black or ethnic minority Bond.  My guess that it's like the fringe SJW's trolling this.  Idris Elba isn't that interested.  My opinion of recasting male characters as females or white characters as minorities in most cases (not all) is that it's insulting to them, it's like saying that they're so uninteresting and hard to write for they'll just tack it on to a pre-existing character.   I say this every time this comes up we need more diversity behind the scenes, more diverse characters (not just a set amount of characters that change gender or race).  This allows a great dynamic mix from multiple perspectives."

JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone's opinion counts really, there will likely be a black Bond.  Craig I think is contracted for Spectre and a further film so after that we'll know.  I really don't want to come across as a racist or sexist in any way.  I raised in another thread on this sub that in the modern world where much of the NATO vs Russia war is fought mainly economically (Ukraine being the exception).  Much of the security threats come from Middle Eastern terrorist groups, in order for Bond to be an effective spy in that arena a Middle Eastern or Asian bond would make more sense."

JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"I think there's a push for it, the media tends to respond to these things.  I mean we've seen Thor changing gender recently, there's been a lot of push for a female Doctor (of Doctor Who) which beyond all logic will happen.  It can work, with the right actor, but I just think it drifts too far from the Ian Fleming character.  I also think the idea of just porting a black actor on to an existing role is insulting to the black community, since Hollywood and the media is so lacking in ideas and diverse writers with diverse ideas they can't give us a franchise with a black actor, and a new franchise."
JamesBond,2xvfua,terrymcginnisbeyond,2,Thu Mar 5 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"I also think the idea of just porting a black actor on to an existing role is insulting to the black community, since Hollywood and the media is so lacking in ideas and diverse writers with diverse ideas they can't give us a franchise with a black actor, and a new franchise.   I'm white, so I could never pretend to understand what it's like to be a minority, but I think you've touched on something here. Hiring a black actor just to say, ""Look! We're diverse!"" is a bad idea. It's the definition of tokenism.  If the producers see this as an issue, I would rather they approach it the way the Marvel films have: characters like War Machine and The Falcon are portrayed as essential and capable heros, but aren't there ""just because."" I think Bond can do the same thing. Show Bond working with 003, say, and have it be a black woman. Don't make her a love interest, just show her as being a critical member of the team - and give her a skill set similar to Bond."
JamesBond,2xvfua,bristow84,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've just had a scroll through my old posts and it's taken a while to find it so I'll just drop it here.  It is very much tokenism and there is a bit of an elephant in the room with Bonds previous lack of diversity, I just want to touch on this, when Trek had a black actor as the 'Captain' it wasn't Avery Brooks that had earned the role as such, since in my opinion he was a fine actor in that role, and very capable and always had the right to be in that role, but Star Trek itself as a franchise had earned the right not to just say, 'look we're diverse' and 'how progressive are we, all of a sudden'  they'd always cast capable black actors like Nichelle Nichols as Uhura or Levar Burton (famous for Roots) as Geordi LaForge and I never even think of their colour, they're the characters they play, I can see their black, I'm not blind but Trek always had a great way of me never thinking about the gender or colour of a character.  Probably Doctor Who has gone some way to justifying a Black Doctor or Female since over time they've become more contemporary and lost the focus on it just being a 'white' show.    But the Bond franchise hasn't really addressed fully the lack of diversity from it's past and some of the sexism and racism (like in LALD for instance, or the absence of any diversity in later films) so to suddenly cast a black actor it's a bit of an apology that comes in from nowhere like Eons saying 'hey we were bad in the 80's and 90's but hey forget that, here's a black bond'.  In any case here's what I wrote before on the subject.  I think it's a shame that people write so poorly for BME groups that the only way to achieve some sort of media equality is to make Bond black, or Doctor Who a Woman (apparently no one wants to see a black Doctor, I wonder why?).  The real inequality in a lot of these franchises doesn't lie in front of the camera but behind, not allowing BME / minorities or women to be in a position to be in producer / writing roles, unless they're writing about their group. I think it's really insulting in a way, as it erases the real struggle people may have to face to become a sub-commander or scientist in western Europe even now. I think it would be a great idea to see a black Q or Asian M, would it be realistic? Probably not, would it change anything? Hell no. It's also a gimmick, we've had a female M, so ladies you've had your lot, now it's back to someone so white he was able to play a NAZI. So again we'll have a black bond (c'mon it's inevitable) they'll do a few movies, then we'll be back to a white male Bond (the character as written). I haven't a problem with a black Bond, maybe when EON are casting though they should just allow open auditions to any actor of any race.  To me though it's similar to why didn't we have a black Harry Potter or Hermione Granger? I don't remember Rowling making a specific reference to either of their races (other than Ron Weasley), but again Rowling is a white female, writing predominately from that point of view, and that's fine, there's no problem, what we need is people from all backgrounds writing more and producing more media from their own perspective.  Will we in the future go further and further from Flemings character as he described him, until it isn't really Bond any more anyway, there seems to be a push to make the character PC when really he isn't, and we don't need to approach every 'good guy' like that, a character can be completely un-PC, smoke and womanise, drink like a guppy and shoot people in cold blood because not everything we watch has to palatable, it can still be OK to have a character like that, to have an anti-hero, much of the time Bond is a bit of bastard, yet even in the 60's and 70's I think audiences knew that, that this guy wasn't always a 'role model'. Modern audiences look back and think that in the 60's to 80's everyone was a complete racist and put women down, but I think they were smart enough to see Bond as a unique character not the model of a man. I think there was a bit of 'tongue in cheek' approach that everyone knew this guy would likely get a slap if he really acted like this but it was a movie.  So saying that, and if you do see a Bond from a different ethnic background how will that now be dealt with, will they make a unique character that is both James Bond, yet holds on to the unique background of the actors race, one of being a person from a BME background living and working in Britain, or will we get a East Asian actor that does kung-fu on the 'bad guys', will it become a Jackie Chan movie? Or will we get a Black Bond that's like a mix of Chris Tucker and Samuel L Jackson? It's not as if Hollywood always gets these things right in action movies even now (Transformers anyone), or are they going to make these actors who could offer something unique essentially act like Sean Connery / Roger Moore?.  In terms of the Films and Books we can put together some history of Bond, which is that he was born to a somewhat wealthy family, his parents died on a skiing trip, he went to private school, was kicked out then joined the Navy, rose to the rank of Commander and was likely in Naval Intelligence, and likely M (Bernard Lee's M) was his commanding officer, he then became an MI6 agent, eventually becoming an elite 00 agent. If you can sell me on the idea that a member of a minority group could get to do that in Britain as it is today then fine, I'm half Arabic and people still look at me funny when they find that out, and that's only bloody half, It's not even that noticeable! This is kind of the problem I have with Craigs Bond, that basically we've gone from someone who likely worked much of his career on a ship, (it's never suggested he was a Marine) to someone from the SAS (probably due to the obsession and public view that only the Army does any dangerous work, or defense of the UK, they never really notice the other two branches Royal Navy or RAF). He's now written as some jug-head rather than as a spy, someone who needs to blend in, not stand out. Which means as much of NATO's work is in the Middle East at this time the kind of spy they need to blend in would likely not be white or black but likely Asian, so let's push for an Asian Bond."

JamesBond,2xvfua,terrymcginnisbeyond,-4,Wed Mar 4 20:47:54 2015 UTC,Are you one of those people that's upset about the ghost busters remake?
JamesBond,2xvfua,WeGotCompany,6,Wed Mar 4 08:08:26 2015 UTC,"Why would you say that?  Because I don't think a black Bond is an amazing idea.  I personally think we'll see a black Bond, but I don't think it's the character as written by Fleming.  Again it's very much porting a black character on to an existing established character, which really means we lose out on say a new franchise with an interesting black character.  It's a shame that Hollywood is addicted to the reboot and remake, since getting more diverse writers in all mediums would see more of a leap towards diversity than just CTRL+V on existing characters, but that's likely what we'll get.  The Ghostbusters thing is very different and I'm looking forward to it, as the characters in Ghostbusters haven't really got a literary back story, or particularly a movie one with only two films, really Ghostbusters is about the ghosts and the humour.  But I'm concerned that with such a great premise Hollywood will screw it up like everything else they remake and reboot, from Spiderman, Star Trek, Alien whatever, and that's a shame because if they get a Ghostbusters film right it could be awesome whoever's in it."
JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,1 point,Wed Mar 4 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"The series has always changed to adapt modern times with reboots and such.  Fleming never wrote about cyberterrorism, yet Skyfall made it work fine.    And, unlike 50 years ago, the idea of a black man living in the upper-crust of Britain is more than believable, so what's the problem."
JamesBond,2xvfua,WeGotCompany,-1,Fri Mar 6 00:27:45 2015 UTC,"I think idris elba is a terrific actor with the right charisma, physicality and depth for bond. I also think that you have to realise that in 2015 this notion of what flemings bond is or isn't is fairly flexible, we accept that he doesn't smoke 80 cigarettes a day, we accept he's not a borderline rapist, and we should accept that it's possible to examine the idea of the character in a modern context which could include bond having a different background to the one we're used to. I don't know if there was this much outcry when judi Dench was cast as M but we know how that turned out."
JamesBond,2xvfua,akanefive,3,Wed Mar 4 09:55:45 2015 UTC,"Elba would be great, but it's just not happening. If they were going to cast him, it would have to have been in 2006.

JamesBond,2xp2mp,terrymcginnisbeyond,2,Mon Mar 2 23:13:12 2015 UTC,"He doesn't do too much in Thunderball, and seriously I was more distracted by the giant rubber fetish baby-grower that Bond was wearing in that movie, and the terrible terrible underwater scenes.    But yeah, Bond has turned on the homing device which Q gives him if he needs back up and Felix is like 'yeah James knows what he's doing', all the while James is thinking, ""man I nearly get my balls lasered through and I really need help, but wtf where's Felix"".    I do kind of like Goldfinger for the fact that James is in real peril though, it's a very natural place for the series at that point to go.  In Dr. No James has a real mystery to solve, In FRWL the stories the exact opposite, really it's collect Tatiana and the Lektor, and really just bring it back, there is some mystery but really that's it, and I'm OK with that.  Bond's mainly in control in both films, so in Goldfinger we get something fresh with Bond still being cool, but not actually doing much action, more being personally in peril.  Even at the end when Bond opens the bomb and hasn't a clue like and looks like he's been asked to assemble a pile of Willy Wonka's Meccano into a working Aston Martin in 30 seconds."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,SMStanton,2,Mon Mar 2 23:29:18 2015 UTC,Which version of Thunderball have you been watching?  I heard that some of the earlier prints released for home video were missing the music during some of the underwater scenes

It's loved because of the DB5. But to answer your question, part of me says well why not taunt him? He's James Bond. I mean just look how he acts towards Le Chiffre when he's being tortured. Why let them have the upper hand psychologically? It's a mind game. But within the movie I think it's as simple as it fits in with the major narrative and contributes to the famous quote (from the book as well as the movie), ""Mr. Bond, they have a saying in Chicago: 'Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action'."

JamesBond,2xp2mp,IamJamesBondAMA,4,Tue Mar 3 00:04:06 2015 UTC,"You're a lot like me in that regard. I feel as though you're more driven by a good story and the nitty-gritty Bond. I liked QoS a lot, too. My favorite Bond is Dalton, followed very closely by Craig."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,jamedudijench,4,Tue Mar 3 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. I want something compelling. QoS gets a lot of unnecessary hate. Aside from it continuing Bond's tale from the last movie, the 4 element model of the cinematography was fantastic, flashy cuts perhaps but I still enjoy it. Dalton and Craig best represent Fleming's Bond. The other Bonds are fun and represent the franchise's impact on film but of content worthy of the literature, I would like it to be a film with a good, solid story. I feel I don't visit Dalton enough."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,IamJamesBondAMA,3,Tue Mar 3 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"I was just talking with another Bond fan on this subreddit about how certain people were throwing around the idea of an HBO miniseries or series based exclusively on the books during the time in which they were written. In my opinion, that's how you could get away with doing a Live and Let Die or a Moonraker and still make it true to the books without having to be apologetic."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,jamedudijench,2,Tue Mar 3 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting! I think that would be real fun. A return to new forms of supplemental material could really invigorate things. And period television has never been hotter. Yes, it'd have to be '50s-'60s or nothing. That's a wonderful idea, I had never thought of that.

Now let's say the next place I go to, perhaps a distant destination thus the odds go up significantly, and i see the same person. That is coincidence. Although I can speak for neither Auric Goldfinger nor Ian Fleming. Ultimately it's just witty dialogue between villain and hero."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,tspangle88,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"I think it gets so much love for a lot of reasons.  First, it was the first one to really follow the Bond Formula from the later movies (gun barrel, popular theme song, Maurice Binder credits, meet with M, meet with Q, unique villain, etc).  Second, it was the first one to really be kind of epic, with lots of locations, big sweeping views, big elaborate sets, a grand scheme, and everything else.  Yes, there are plot holes, but can't you say that about pretty much any Bond flick?  Heck, even Skyfall....."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,jamedudijench,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:47:37 2015 UTC,"Rewatch From Russia With Love. I argue that it is the film that sets up the Bond formula first. Pretty much everything you mentioned is in FRWL. It's just a better spy movie. I'm telling you, Goldfinger is only iconic for the DB5 and maybe Oddjob and Jill Masterson's death. Movie-wise though? It's not as good as FRWL in my opinion. And like Quantum of Solace, it's great right after it's previous movie."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,jamedudijench,5,Mon Mar 2 21:39:57 2015 UTC,I tend to agree. From Russia With Love is a more traditional 1960s Cold War-era spy film. Its plot is also a lot more probable than someone breaking into Fort Knox by crop-dusting the surrounding area with nerve gas.
JamesBond,2xp2mp,jamedudijench,2,Mon Mar 2 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"Plus, I mean, James Bond vs. the anti-Bond, Red Grant. A fantastic performance turned in by Robert Shaw. A much more buyable and capable adversary to 007. A very tense movie. Goldfinger? I dunno. I don't hate it, I mean, it's James Bond, I love it as a whole. But the Goldfinger definitive film malarkey? No, I don't pray at that alter."
JamesBond,2xp2mp,tspangle88,2,Mon Mar 2 23:58:48 2015 UTC,I don't think it's malarkey; Goldfinger is a very enjoyable film to watch. But is it as good as From Russia With Love? Maybe not.

More tightly plotted and realistic, and the Bond vs. Grant fight scene is the best in the series, IMO.  But I still say that Goldfinger is the film that really set the formula for what came after, including the outlandish plot by the main villain.  It also has more locations, from Miami to England to Switzerland, and finally Fort Knox.  Plus, there are so many iconic moments and things.  The gold-painted girl, Oddjob, Pussy Galore, the Shirley Bassey theme song, and of course the DB5.  In short, I agree that FRWL is the better film, but I can see why Goldfinger gets the love that it does."

Take this scene from Goldfinger, I believe when Bond is in the clutches of Auric Goldfinger himself and believes he will die:   The wings of a dove, the heavenly choir, Hark the Herald Angels Sing - what else ought he to remember about Paradise? It was all so exactly like what he had been told in the nursery - this sensation of flying, the darkness, the drone of the million harps. He really must try and remember the dope about the place. Let's see now, one got to the Pearly Gates... A deep fatherly voice said, almost in his ear, 'This is your captain speaking.' (Well, well. Who was this. Saint Peter?) 'We are coming in to land now. Will you please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes. Thank you.' There must be a whole lot of them, going up together. Would Tilly be on the same trip? Bond squirmed with embarrassment. How would he introduce her to the others, to Vesper for instance? And when it came to the point, which would he like the best? But perhaps it would be a big place with countries and towns. There was probably no more reason why he should run into one of his former girl friends here than there had been on earth.

JamesBond,2xmro8,IamJamesBondAMA,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:45:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Fleming might not have been the best writer -- I like him a lot -- but he certainly knew how to create drama. I know I've said this before, but I think the pinky-breaking scene in Live and Let Die was brutal."

It's not nitty-gritty and charming like Chandler and it's not disillusioning like Camus. But Bond has always felt MORE than an adventure novel. It's a spy novel, but it's not Le Carre. It's an adventure novel, but it's not a pulp. Bond's a hero, but he's a Byronic hero, and not incredibly relatable -- but I still really enjoy him."

Perhaps I imagine him doing the bit with a certain amount of tounge in cheek self deprication rather than know-it-all annoying snob. A little history is fun when mixing a cocktail.  Edit: And yeah, no one is going to hear me calling this drink anything but a dry vodka martini."
JamesBond,2xl3ot,Jack_Sandwich,2,Mon Mar 2 00:31:08 2015 UTC,I've been working my way through them. Currently in middle of Goldfinger.
JamesBond,2xl3ot,AmericanRudeboy,2,Mon Mar 2 04:05:30 2015 UTC,"Bond did order Vodka Martinis shaken, not stirred in the books. First time was in Diamonds Are Forever and the next time was in Dr. No, which was nearly verbatim in the Connery movie, which, after being repeated in a few films, is why it became such a cultural phenomenon. In Live and Let Die he has a vodka martini brought to him in a shaker. It wasn't said, but it was implied that it was shaken.  It's great to hear from someone who's read the books (or had Simon Vance read them). You're right, Bond lives with death knocking at his door. He's filled with pain and loathing so he drinks and smokes and screws every chance he gets. It helps plug the emptiness that he's constantly running away from.  Bond, despite the fact that he didn't see himself this way, was a snob about a lot of things, including booze. Yes, he would drink Miller High Life and Molle Mit Korns but he could also be a pretty temperamental customer. In Casino Royale, when he first meets Leiter, Bond insists that Leiter drink his scotch on the rocks, then tells the bartender to make him a custom cocktail (The Vesper) that he invents on the spot and after it's served tells the bartender that the type of vodka he chose was sub-par. One could argue that he was putting on a show for the benefit of everyone at the casino. But the fact that he was constantly ordering Dry Martinis and specifying that they be made with vodka and lemon twists or in From a View to a Kill he orders an Americano with very specific brands because he considers it to be the least ""offensive option"" in the present company, means that he didn't just accept whatever came his way. He also refuses to drink Japanese Whisky in You Only Live Twice, despite the fact that several people he respects tell him it's great and that it's made in the Scotch Whisky tradition, which is a spirit he loves more than Vodka. Point being, maybe that's refined taste or worldliness, but he definitely was particular about the booze he ordered, especially in public.  Anyway, hope that helped. Cheers!"

JamesBond,2xdbfu,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Sat Feb 28 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"Aside from the unfortunate racist undertones (overtones?) of the novel, I actually prefer the plot of the book to the film. Mr. Big just wants to be the biggest criminal in the western hemisphere and he's got Soviet training and backing. I like the idea of Bond tracing the funding to the source in order to put him out of business - you can tell that was kind of the headspace that Fleming was writing in, but the fact that it's lost pirate gold gives the whole story a nice flair. And Mr. Big in the novels just felt more ruthless and threatening than Kananga did."
JamesBond,2xdbfu,Enriquepollazzo,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I definitely prefer the book, too. Given the time that the book was written, its tough to call it truly racist though. By our current definition the word-use is TOTALLY racist! But given that it was written in 1953, Bond himself is written to be open-minded and even praises the black community, which he also goes into further depth with in DaF. The dialogue of some of the characters is where I run into problems. Its very....insensitive and caricature-esque - which is not okay, but Fleming does that to anyone with a foreign accent, the SMERSH meeting in FRWL is one such example. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a book like this though, being aware that this stuff nowadays isn't okay, and reading it through the lens of the era helps keep it in perspective, ya know?"

JamesBond,2xe8cq,Billy_1998,6,Fri Feb 27 21:19:02 2015 UTC,I personally don't like the idea. I like each movie to be its own adventure that you can pop in anytime without any backstory.  Since there are so many Bond films I hope this stays the case for future installments.
JamesBond,2xe8cq,raysweater,4,Sat Feb 28 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"You know they would fall into that Hollywood standard of naming sequels.  We would end up with titles like ""Skyfall 2: The Rebuilding"" or some shit like that."
JamesBond,2xe8cq,voxshades,5,Sat Feb 28 17:23:15 2015 UTC,From Russia With Love was kind of a sequel. They experimented with a Bond girlfriend character but she never returned in Goldfinger or any film afterwards. Personally I love the idea of direct sequels. I brought up in another post that I would love the idea of a 2 movie scenario like Casino Royale and QoS for the future films. I'd love if Spectre picks up right where Skyfall leaves off.
JamesBond,2xe8cq,jamedudijench,2,Fri Feb 27 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"Blofeld is prominently in three straight movies, four if you count the ""Blofeld"" character killed in LaLD FYEO. In that same movie, Bond visits his wife's grave. So there are some nods to previous films on occasion. But really it's just the fact that Fleming's books are not one continuous story arc, and are more serial, and the producers chose to continue that for the film.   Also, it's near impossible to have a continuous arc over 60 years, so they do have to standalone to some degree. But with Craig's Bond, you see they've made a more concerted effort to make them more cohesive."
JamesBond,2xe8cq,dibsODDJOB,2,Fri Feb 27 21:38:48 2015 UTC,they've made a more concerted effort to make them more    I wonder how that will play out with Spectre. Will they assume some time and a handful of adventures have passed since Skyfall?  I hope Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) has settled into his new role as M and we don't have to spend an entire movie with Bond getting used to a new M.  Hard to guess when they went directly from origin story to old/washed up agent.
JamesBond,2xe8cq,CelebornX,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:14:28 2015 UTC,"Ya I think if they had known everything they would have played out the four movies a lot differently. CR was solid and what they wanted, but then the writer's strike throws a wrench in the plans for QoS, which itself has a SPECTRE standin in Quantum. And then they settle a half of a century old legal battle that allows them to reuse SPECTRE, so no they have to rewrite that into the Quantum arc somehow.  I just hope we just get a really long board room meeting at SPECTRE Corp where they come up with the acronym for their organization."

Actually just yesterday, I think, I was trying to remember the movie of the scene where Bond and M are in an office with other officials and Bond brings up a scandalous vacation they had and Moneypenny is asked to leave the room but listens in on the speaker on her desk. Then M knows she did that and asks her to do something related to the mission. I'm fairly certain it was Bernard Lee as M but the Bond is either Connery or Moore, it escapes me. I still don't know what movie it was. I must have jumped through each movie 4 times."

I know England has some Far-right groups and maybe the leader of it is a Political figure or something. Sadly there would be no sunny locales and foreign wonders but it would be (as the Brits say) a cracking good story.  We saw shades of that in Skyfall with the inquiries and final-act all on the British Isles, which I believe is the first time that ever happened.   Edit: a word"
JamesBond,2xa11j,sigersen,0,Fri Feb 27 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"I think EON is throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. Getting the rights to Blofeld back, saved their bacon. It's obvious from stuff Craig and others have said that many consider the newer films as ""Too Dark"".  ( I know I do ) I think EON is trying to strike a balance and soften the tone of the films without straying into Moonraker territory.  If Spectre is a lighter fun Bond film, I will go see it at the theater. If not, I will wait for Netflix."

My father won't accept anyone else to this day. Plus Bond is very human in the novel and Lazenby attempts to play him the same way. It's a very bold move on the part of EON if you think about it.

If any of you good Agents have access to it, the 2nd series/season of Sherlock, the commentary of the first episode of that mentions HEAVILY some scenes cut from OHMSS (god I'm getting sick of typing that) and they acknowledge it as their favourite.  Now, again as I've repeating a zillion times before. To to each their own and we all have our own valid opinions, but this movie I think is slowly coming into light as an overlooked classic.

JamesBond,2x5124,whisperHailHydra,0,Thu Feb 26 01:49:58 2015 UTC,But do they mention her at all in the following novels?
JamesBond,2x5124,Swamp85,2,Thu Feb 26 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, in You Only Live Twice - Bond is a completely broken man and is on the verge of being fired by M. He cocks up a few missions and is on his last chance. I won't say any more as it would spoil it. But it's pretty sweet."
JamesBond,2x5124,Clancy_B_Shanty,0,Thu Feb 26 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"That's my main problem with that plot point in the movies. They never mention it (besides some Brosnan movie I think, haven't made it there yet) and it bugs the shit out of me."
JamesBond,2x5124,Swamp85,7,Thu Feb 26 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"The movie for FYEO starts with Bond visiting her grave, and in LTK he is hesitant to catch Della's garter at Felix's wedding and mentions his previous marriage."
JamesBond,2x5124,Clancy_B_Shanty,5,Thu Feb 26 02:42:09 2015 UTC,"They never mention it    Except in The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only and License to Kill.  They also allude to her in Diamonds are Forever, Tomorrow Never Dies and (arguably) Goldeneye."
JamesBond,2x5124,HumanTrafficCone,3,Thu Feb 26 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"Okay y'all got me there, but as devastated as Bond was in the movie you'd think it would be a major plot point for the series."
JamesBond,2x5124,Swamp85,3,Thu Feb 26 04:51:38 2015 UTC,I'll give you that.  They do manage to sweep her under the rug awfully quick.
JamesBond,2x5124,HumanTrafficCone,8,Thu Feb 26 04:53:57 2015 UTC,I second OHMSS. Would have loved to see more with Lazenby!

JamesBond,2x5124,Clancy_B_Shanty,5,Wed Feb 25 19:54:45 2015 UTC,Goldfinger
JamesBond,2x5124,ttha_ttha,4,Wed Feb 25 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"I don't agree, but the circlejerk is going to say From Russia with Love.   I would say Goldfinger or Spy who Loved Me or For Your Eyes Only, personally."
JamesBond,2x5124,foxh8er,4,Wed Feb 25 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"Why would you assume everyone would say FRWL? Goldfinger is pretty much universally regarded as the best Bond film.  To answer your question though, I'd want On Her Majesty's Secret Service."
JamesBond,2x5124,ZiggyPalffyLA,4,Wed Feb 25 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's universally regarded as the best Bond film. The most iconic, probably."
JamesBond,2x5124,GetFreeCash,4,Wed Feb 25 21:10:38 2015 UTC,Octopussy because it's underrated and it will give people a second look.
JamesBond,2x5124,Swamp85,2,Wed Feb 25 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"It's underrated for a reason. Boring and ridiculous.   ""How do we top Bond in a gorilla suit?""  'What about Bond in a clown suit!'"
JamesBond,2x5124,GetFreeCash,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous, maybe. But I don't find it boring at all. It's one of the most .... adventurous Bond films, IMO, but to each their own."
JamesBond,2x5124,GetFreeCash,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:17:30 2015 UTC,Yes! I want this to happen. The cover can be Maud Adam and seven limbs winding around Moore.
JamesBond,2x5124,jamedudijench,2,Wed Feb 25 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"Goldfinger gets too much love. It's only considered great because it sets up the Bond formula for the future films and the DB5, let's be honest. From Russia With Love IS a good film and that would be one choice. Dr. No, sure, it's the iconic introduction of James Bond. On Her Majesty's Secret Service, yeah, that would be a good call too. The general public focuses on the negatives but it's a good film. But Goldfinger should not be the choice. And I say nothing after '69 should be considered."
JamesBond,2x5124,Enriquepollazzo,2,Wed Feb 25 20:44:47 2015 UTC,'From Russia with Love' set the formula not 'Goldfinger'

JamesBond,2x5124,Enriquepollazzo,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:33:02 2015 UTC,From Russia with Love  It is the best movie in many different ways. But I would also enjoy  -Goldfinger  -You ONly Live Twice  -Casino Royale
JamesBond,2x5124,adventcrash,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:44:07 2015 UTC,Casino Royale. But if we are talking pre Craig I say Goldfinger.
JamesBond,2x5124,essentialsalts,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"From Russia With Love. It's the obvious answer, but only because its such a quintessential Bond film. There are elements of the formula, but because the franchise was so fresh, it deviates in interesting ways. Bond is the Cold Warrior, battling the Russians, but the iconic villains of SPECTRE are the real antagonists. And the characters are some of the more compelling of the series - Kerim Bey is one of the best allies & Grant is one of the best villains. It remains one of the most popular books and films, and was instrumental in making the series what it was. It would be the natural choice."
JamesBond,2x5124,wrestlingfan007,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"Skyfall. Because hopefully that movie having a wider audience than old ones will cause people to buy a shit ton of Criterions of it, which could make them release the rest."
JamesBond,2x5124,nutsocharles,-2,Thu Feb 26 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"This might not be a particularly popular pick, but I'd honestly choose Skyfall. Not only do I think it's one of the best Bond films ever made, but because the cast and crew would be able to give insight from such a closer perspective to the process. Further, I would imagine there's much more footage both behind the scenes and stunts and unseen angles that there would be more material with which to examine the actors performances and the directing, the production, likely even less-frequently spotlighted angles like sound recording, editing, score...  I have to say having rewatched it so so many times the last few years already, I really believe #23 is going to hold up in the Bond franchise like it did in the NBA. Always a high mark and part of the best ever conversation. It may be too new for many to see it that way, but If I'm not rushed, I'd wait for another 6 or 7 movies and pitch it once it's become part of the established history of 007."
JamesBond,2x3x9q,arosen132,12,Wed Feb 25 13:22:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I did. But I guess we're not meant to.
JamesBond,2x3x9q,chriswalkenspal,6,Wed Feb 25 13:47:33 2015 UTC,I do that when I have a password out in public. I make it look like I'm typing other letters so if someone's watching they won't know what buttons I actually used.
JamesBond,2x3x9q,ZBGB,5,Wed Feb 25 18:07:49 2015 UTC,Yep.  Would've given it away quite fast.  But he still types some of the letters in the word Vesper.
JamesBond,2x3x9q,wildcard6270,2,Wed Feb 25 15:42:44 2015 UTC,I think you only see the keypad for part of the typing. I've thought this before but on later rewatching it looked to me like we were only catching the last few letters

JamesBond,2x3heb,iluvmoney,10,Wed Feb 25 09:31:11 2015 UTC,"I think it was fleshed out more in the novels than the films and the only film I can remember that even hinted towards it was Casino Royale.  Also, IIRC he took normal showers at first and would turn the cold water on just before he was finished."
JamesBond,2x3heb,llenzll,7,Wed Feb 25 12:37:55 2015 UTC,"This is a good life hack for people who like hot showers. You just finish with a couple of minutes of the coldest water you can manage, so you don't come out of the shower sweating and getting stinky before you're even clothed again."

JamesBond,2x3heb,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Wed Feb 25 14:23:07 2015 UTC,He apparently did that to wake his muscles up. It apparently helps when it comes to pain resistance too...
JamesBond,2x3heb,jamedudijench,3,Wed Feb 25 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"Similar (but probably not what you're thinking of) Daniel Craig's scene in Tomb Raider where he goes back in the shower, after Angelina Jolie interupts him there, saying ""now for a cold shower"""

JamesBond,2wzuy5,akanefive,2,Tue Feb 24 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed! The first bit of LTK took place in Florida, just like LALD just for those curious.  Another tie to the books was the character of Milton Crest. He appeared in the short story 'The Hildebrandt Rarity' and an even bigger asshole.  Edit: 2nd Act of LALD novel was in Florida, I'm not smart."
JamesBond,2wzyrm,adventcrash,8,Tue Feb 24 15:50:33 2015 UTC,"Great review - though I have a higher opinion of the film than you do. I've always interpreted (or maybe I'm just fan-wanking) the scene where Bond and Blofeld meet as a game of chicken. They each know who the other is, but neither will be the first to say. (Not unlike Thunderball.)"
JamesBond,2wzyrm,akanefive,4,Tue Feb 24 16:50:11 2015 UTC,I felt the same you do the first time I watched OHMSS. When I watched it years later it zoomed to the top of my list as one of my favorites. I agree that Lazenby was great in the fight scenes. I think he was better than Connery. But I won't argue about his acting. He was awful. Another nice and balanced review.  I await your review of DAF.
JamesBond,2wzyrm,sigersen,2,Tue Feb 24 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"I've practically given up trying to defend OHMSS. I love it, and I love everything about it. When this came out, Lazenby's name wasn't synonymous with being 'One and Done'. It was a TOTALLY risky move getting a first time actor into the role of 007, just as it was a TOTALLY risky move getting some ""Scottish stunt-man"" to play the part in Dr. No. The movie is certainly aided by going nearly word-for-word with the book and it is better for it. Why they decided to film YOLT beforehand is beyond me...  ANYWAY...my best advice -- is sit on this movie for a few months, then give it another go, especially after the Moore era films. I won't say Moore more about it as you haven't seen them yet. You might see it with different eyes.  (PS: you got an upvote just because even dissenting opinions are welcome here. Its what makes me love this Sub)"
JamesBond,2wzyrm,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Wed Feb 25 01:25:54 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the upvote and openess to opinions. I can easily see why people love this film, I think even a remake of this film could be one of the best Bond films. It just wasn't personally for me. I know about the  history with Lazenby (that guy is fascinating) I just think some acting training before hand could have helped some more. I didn't hate the film and I wouldn't mind giving it another look after I'm finished but the first viewing did little for me. I did very much enjoy all of the action scenes though. I knew when I started this little venture that I would probably get some dissent on some of these films but I appreciate your openness to opinions. Who knows maybe on my second time I will love it."
JamesBond,2wzyrm,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Wed Feb 25 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"That's how it was for me, personally.   I was a kid (13-ish) when I saw it the first time and I was ""contaminated"" as I already knew he only did the one film so I was like - 'Only did one? He MUST be terrible!!' so I was dismissive of it. Later when I got the box-set for Christmas I popped 'er in again and quite simply fell in love with it."
JamesBond,2wzyrm,knobthis,2,Wed Feb 25 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"I liked your comment about Diana Rigg.  I'm one of the few here old enough to see this on the big screen in 69.  This film has won Bond fans over the years, but in 1969 it received scathing reviews, did worse than all previous Bond films at the box office, and was considered the worst of all Bond films up to that time.  Your observation about Dianna Rigg as Tracy is an interesting comment I've not heard before, but her aggressive role was anticipated by audiences as Rigg (like Honor Blackman of Goldfinger) had played Emma Peel (65-68) in the very popular TV spy series, ""The Avengers.""  So, even though this movie ruined some careers, Diana Rigg survived unharmed.  That said, lots of reason this movie breaks down under any serious scrutiny.  Lazenby was ill-fit for the role - an Australian male model who had to be coached in carrying himself as Bond, and his voice had to be dubbed over by George Baker throughout portions of the film.  It baffles me that there are people who defend this film as one of the best - it's not.  Still, there was a lot of great talent surrounding the making of this film.  Cameraman John Jordan is one example.  John Jordan had himself strapped underneath a helicopter to shoot all of the amazing aerial scenes - including the ski chases.  This same John Jordan had his leg cut off by the blade of a helicopter three years earlier in You Only Live Twice while filming the helicopter fight scene with Little Nelly.  Sadly, this amazing man - devoted to his cinematography skill - was killed while filming The Battle of Britain in 1971 when he fell to his death from a helicopter.  *typos"
JamesBond,2wzyrm,b-rad012,2,Wed Feb 25 07:38:38 2015 UTC,"It might not have been the best bond film, but it is a decent film overall. It also sets up some important characterization for Bond that isn't really emulated until Casino Royale (Bond losing a woman he loves)."

JamesBond,2wu7xf,dragonsky,11,Mon Feb 23 05:56:20 2015 UTC,Noted. But the song was the theme to a film that Richard Kiel played in. Of all the Bond film themes they picked the theme for the film that was his Jaws debut. But they failed to include him in the In Memoriam. I think Hollywood kinda dropped the ball with that one.

The movie has a lot of flaws, and is probably the weakest of the Connery films, but I suggest you look at the older movies with an eye toward filmaking norms of the times. Movie making changed after Star Wars (compare to 1976's ""At Earth's Core"", which also had Peter Cushing).  Also, Thunderball is awesome. So much better than Dr. No."

JamesBond,2wx6yv,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Tue Feb 24 03:19:26 2015 UTC,No joke! The movie goes word for word with the book on several occasions. The scene that I (retrospectively) miss was his actual proposal to Tracy at the airport on Christmas morning.
JamesBond,2wx6yv,ManicsObsessive,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:40:49 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, that book is brilliant. It is a great story, some impressive action sequences and some really poignant moments aswell. The film did well in showing most of it but I think it's too easily written off as it's Lazenby's only Bond. Fantastic novel and good film"
JamesBond,2wx6yv,jamedudijench,6,Tue Feb 24 12:44:49 2015 UTC,"I just read Casino Royale, it reads really well and quick. Personally a great counterpart with its film. If anything I would say the film undersells Bond in the last act of the film. The book really fills in the gaps. As they usually do. Reading Live and Let Die now."
JamesBond,2wx6yv,Clancy_B_Shanty,4,Tue Feb 24 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"Moonraker is probably my favourite book. The movie can't hold a candle to it -- on any level. The bridge game at Blades is among the most entertaining scenes I've ever read.  Arguably it has the most capable female character in the entire canon. I hope to see Gala Brand in a movie eventually and I hope they keep her and Bond's dynamic intact.   If you haven't read it yet, or any of the books --- you're in for a treat!"
JamesBond,2wx6yv,GrinderAK,2,Tue Feb 24 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"My favorite book is Thunderball, it moves very fast and translates very well into younger generations. It definitely has an intrigue and espionage aspect to it, but it seems to not take itself too seriously. With the movie, you can feel the pressure that was on the producers to make a strong film to follow up to Goldfinger. However, still one of my favorite movies as well."
JamesBond,2wx6yv,Clancy_B_Shanty,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:01:01 2015 UTC,Thunderball is actually the funniest book just for the Health Clinic scenes. Watching 007 slowly go insane while drinking carrot juice was extremely enjoyable haha
JamesBond,2wx6yv,1q2w3e4rqwe,2,Tue Feb 24 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"For everyone who loves MR I do as well, its a cracking book however its been adapted...  You just need to watch Die Another Day, its a straight up Moonraker adaptation.  So they've had two goes and butchered it twice!"
JamesBond,2wx6yv,Cleanatwork,2,Tue Feb 24 08:10:01 2015 UTC,"Casino Royale...and it's one of my top 5 Bond films.  Also fond of Moonraker (meanwhile, the movie is dumb but fun) and From Russia With Love (the movie is faithful and good).   My fave Bond movie remains The Spy Who Loved Me...but the book has been on my shelf for about 5 years, still unread...mainly due to the widespread adverse reaction to it."
JamesBond,2wx6yv,sigersen,1 point,Wed Mar 4 11:47:18 2015 UTC,For me it's OHMSS. Great book and great film adaptation. Casino Royale and Goldfinger are good too. Actually the movie adaptation made Goldfinger a slightly more interesting villain in my opinion.

JamesBond,2ws4wa,jamedudijench,-6,Mon Feb 23 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"You have a good point. However, Ralph's 'M' character just rubs me the wrong way. Most of the new Skyfall charater's do, really. They just act too damn British and stuffy to me."
JamesBond,2ws4wa,Badmecha007,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:09:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, we'll have to see how Spectre turns out to really properly assess Fiennes as M. I liked what I saw in Skyfall to be honest. And as an American myself, I love the British aspect of it all. It's so James Bond. Although I admittedly admire many different cultures as a given. And besides, the acting chops between the Spectre cast is... wow, really all I can say. So excited. I mean Christoph Waltz? Are you kidding?"

I'm in mobile right now about going to the gym, otherwise I would link you the /r/menfashionadvice graphic regarding what color shoes you wear with what suits.   Brown is 90% there. Black suit is only worn in 3 occasions: Marriage, someone dies, or The Oscars, paired with black shoes of course. Amongst real suit occasions and wearers, to see a black suited person in everyday activities, is considered tacky, ie: an Interview, I know several people who did not get the job because they wore a black suit to a ""real big boy"" job interview.  People and laymen wear them, but amongst real suit-wearers, and professionals is considered weird and kind of ""off-putting"" to be honest.

I think OP's gripe was more with the brown shoes rather than the lack of a black suit?? In any case, the graphic you linked to certainly has black shoes  as recommended with both navy and indigo suits, along with other brown colours.   Somewhere in the thread you linked to someone comments how brown shoes with suits are frowned upon in England but not in the US. If that is true (and I apologise for my ignorance on the matter but a quick google search seems to confirm it), I would expect Bond to dress like an Englishman!   That being said, the shoes aren't hideous, but after it was pointed out I cannot unsee them and I think it's a shame because the outfit looks so great on him.

It's Snug, without any shoulder padding, very tight waist jacket, and slim pants.  Pretty much you do not see this style as much, because it requires you to be completely physically fit for your height-weight. It's not loose like the American Style or Broad like the Italian style.  It's my favorite style, but hence it's very demanding to keep up with it, because it's like a body-armor, snug, tight, and if you are not in physical shape, it looks weird, and tight on you.  If you can pull it off though, you literally will be the best-dressed man in any event, quite literally looking like James Bond.  BTW you're crazy ! (told me to call you that)"

JamesBond,2wbmbh,jetBlueberry,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"I guess it's on my top 3 list because if I had to choose another song to compare to the original theme from Dr. No, it would be this one. Take away the vocals and just listen to the instrumentals, to me, it sound like it could hold it's own as a new Bond theme.  Doesn't help that I love how Keyes and White really meshed well together."
JamesBond,2wbmbh,akanefive,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you think they mesh well, most things I've read about the title songs tend to rate AWTD on the lower end precisely because Keyes and White's voices don't fit together. (I would agree - I either can't tell who's singing, or focus on the slight difference in pitch when they're singing in unison.) That said, I love the guitar and horn lines in that song. I just wish someone had sang it solo."

JamesBond,2w9bki,sigersen,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:32:06 2015 UTC,"There is no need to retool OHMSS. It's a classic. I had heard rumors that Spectre would be a trifle lighter than the other three Craig films. That would be a good thing. We don't need any ""double-taking Pigeons"", but a little humor woudl be nice. I have no objection to a return of Blofeld but make a new story. Sure touch upon what happened in OHMSS that's fine. Bond's out for revenge in DAF so a big showdown with Blofeld would get me in the theater for this one. A tepid retooling will not."
JamesBond,2w9bki,justinlillich,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Bond crew knows this. Even though Blofeld was only in three of Fleming's original novels, he's been featured in six films and was manufactured as the primary arch nemesis for Bond. He was ""killed off"" at the beginning of For Your Eyes Only in a really stupid pre-credits sequence. It's time to find out what really happened... Or, this is his origin story."
JamesBond,2w6jab,DonKlasko,3,Tue Feb 17 10:39:08 2015 UTC,"Thomas Newman :( He did a nice-enough elemental soundtrack for Skyfall, akin to background noise that adds some ambiance, but utterly forgettable after the fact. I think I might even rate it worse that Serra's GoldenEye soundtrack for my personal tastes.  I wish it wasn't Newman again."
JamesBond,2w6jab,CountLippe,3,Wed Feb 18 08:44:30 2015 UTC,"Hate to be a party pooper, but I would put a billion to one odds against it. He couldn't hardly find the time to pull in the Bond theme in Skyfall. The single best instance of it's use during the DB5 unveil with M was a straight rip from Casino Royale. And his single reference to Adele's title song was so utterly misused it actually makes me angry.   I would love to hope along with you for that, but the only chance would be to have David Arnold back, who has repeatedly demonstrated a sense of sensitivity and respect for the old movies and Barry's music, rather than bring back Thomas Newman to f*** up another movie with the blandest most generic action score possible.  I'm not bitter or anything..."
JamesBond,2w6jab,Brochitect,3,Tue Feb 17 15:04:32 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, and think it was selfish of Sam Mendes to bring his own music guy instead of relying on someone who has proven he knows how to compose a Bond film. In fact, I don't think gaining Mendes was worth losing David Arnold."
JamesBond,2w6jab,ZiggyPalffyLA,3,Tue Feb 17 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"It depends. Did Skyfall land Deakins because Mendes was the director? If so, it might have been worth it, especially because of this."
JamesBond,2w6jab,Korotai,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"Didn't Arnold step down from Skyfall to score the 2012 Olympics or something? That being said, I've ranted on here that Arnold missed the opportunity to compose a soundtrack on the same level as Barry's greats. Barry's strongest soundtracks were composed, arguably, around the strongest title themes (e.g. Thunderball (using Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), OHMSS, DAF).  Arnold showed he had it in him with Casino Royale - a lot of the tracks clearly had YKMN in them (best examples being when Bond first gets his rental Ford, or the train ride through Montenegro). Skyfall was an amazing title song and, furthermore, the instrumental version was phenomenal. Arnold could have easily written an amazing soundtrack based on this.  So what we've got is one of the biggest missed opportunities in regards to Bond soundtracks. And it's probably going to happen again. I'm not saying Newman is a bad composer (I absolutely loved his title theme for Six Feet Under). He's unfortunately not a good fit for Bond."
JamesBond,2w6jab,Korotai,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:42:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but that doesn't sound right. Arnold could have done both. The scoring would have been done after the Olympics anyway."
JamesBond,2w6jab,HaroldPelham,1 point,Wed Feb 18 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"No, that was just the polite story that allowed everyone to save face. Sam Mendes always worked with Thomas Newman on all his movies, so he brought him along again to Skyfall, despite the fact the David Arnold has been the resident Bond composer for 5 films, each with a different director. Arnold got ousted, he wasn't too happy about it personally, but publicly said that he couldn't do Skyfall since he was doing the Olympics.   Tip for the producers: when your composer is called on to score the widest broadcast sporting celebration on the globe, hold on to him.  Edit: Addition - But yes, absolutely, the entire musical story of Casino Royale still astounds me with it's awesomeness more than 8 years after the fact. The way he wove in Chris Cornell's theme, which had the almost-Bond triad set of notes in it, was masterful to say the least. And on top of that, mirroring the storyline where ""James becomes Bond"", we get these little teasers of the Bond theme throughout. It's mostly Cornell's theme, but the Bond theme peeks through bit by bit, more and more, whenever something ""Bondian"" happens, and then when Craig delivers that perfect closing iconic line, finally doing everything that 007 is famous for, the entire orchestra ramps up into a full on explosion of the Bond theme.  God, I still love that score so much.  Edit edit: Addition again - agreement as well that Thomas Newman isn't bad, I think he does just fine on his own for other movies, but for Skyfall, celebrating 50 years of Bond, after everything about the ""Golden Anniversary"" of the longest running current franchise in cinema history, there was absolutely ZERO reference to any former movie, and hardly anything to the Bond theme. It was an absolute shame, and the generic action movie score we ended up with was nothing short of a disappointment."

JamesBond,2vye65,BondFan2015,3,Sun Feb 15 12:22:11 2015 UTC,Curious. What elements make you feel this is an adaptation of OHMSS?
JamesBond,2vye65,CountLippe,4,Sun Feb 15 11:03:29 2015 UTC,"Snow, maybe?"
JamesBond,2vye65,Dave3087,5,Sun Feb 15 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but I also subscribe to the theory that this is a (Semi) remake of OHMSS;   Alpine location.  The shots of the mountain ""base"" for lack of a better term, appear similar back to the Piz Gloria setting in OHMSS. Craig's appearance in the promo shots in reminiscent of Lazenby's. Spectre.  Which leads too; Waltz.  I'm damn near positive that Waltz playing Blofeld is pretty much the worst kept secret in the Bond-verse at this point.  I'll be more shocked if he isn't. Waltz himself has denied it, but then again so did Cumberbatch when it came to Khan.  Belluci as an ""older"" Bond girl.  Perhaps a (much much much) sexier version of Irma Bunt? That logo.  A bullet hole through glass..."
JamesBond,2vye65,HumanTrafficCone,2,Sun Feb 15 18:43:12 2015 UTC,exactly my point.
JamesBond,2vye65,hennelly14,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:07:36 2015 UTC,There's also speculation that Lea Seydoux's character may be a sort of new Tracy
JamesBond,2vye65,dragonsky,3,Mon Feb 16 10:02:09 2015 UTC,I hope this won't become popular opinion once the movie is out. It's fine if people only view it as a fan thoery rather  than canon (like that post few days ago that CR's theme is sang from M's POV)  TWINE  also had a ski chase and it had a bald villain and it featured a line about Bond's family motto and it waasn't an OHMSS remake.
JamesBond,2vye65,HumanTrafficCone,2,Sun Feb 15 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'll lose my shit if its an OHMSS remake. Or even if it just liberally takes some of the plot elements.  My favourite Bond story being remade with my favourite Bond? Yes please."
JamesBond,2vye65,sigersen,2,Sun Feb 15 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"Why does anyone want a remake of OHMSS ?  It's an almost perfect Bond film. There is no reason to remake it. And sorry folks, Lazenby was good in it. If they're stealing from OHMSS it means they have run out of ideas like the newer Star Trek films. I'm hoping this is just a big Craig fanboy rumor because if it's true, I have no interest in seeing a rehash Bond film."
JamesBond,2vye65,RodKimble_Stuntman,1 point,Wed Feb 18 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagree. He gave a valiant effort, but Lazenby was cheeseball in OHMSS. Its one of the best Bond films despite having one of the worst Bond performances, if they're going to remake one this or Thunderball is it. Imagine how good it will be with Craig, who's probably the best purely dramatic actor of the Bonds!"
JamesBond,2vzbyq,starmapleleaf,3,Sun Feb 15 16:36:54 2015 UTC,This could work in a similar way to Casino Royale and Quantum Of Solace. If so I hope Spectre can give half the awesome ending Royale gave.
JamesBond,2vzbyq,ChaosThe15th,2,Sun Feb 15 22:02:27 2015 UTC,"I have this idea that they run with a duology scenario for the time being. There was a hint of it from Dr. No to From Russia With Love with Silvia Trench. But like with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, it would be cool if Spectre picked up shortly after Skyfall."
JamesBond,2vzbyq,jamedudijench,4,Mon Feb 16 02:02:05 2015 UTC,I would love it if the final scene of Skyfall (Bond going into M's office) is the opening of Spectre.
JamesBond,2vzbyq,nothingsound14,2,Mon Feb 16 19:08:40 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm talking about. Oh yeah! Very awesome indeed.
JamesBond,2vzbce,Badgermutt,5,Sun Feb 15 16:30:55 2015 UTC,"IMDb credits him as ""Shanghai Art Collector"". It kind of looked like Severine and the other people there had lured the guy there so that Patrice could kill him from a neighbouring building."

JamesBond,2vwktk,tinidor01,10,Sat Jun 6 10:22:00 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite themes for any Bond movie was the theme John Barry wrote for On Her Majesty's Secret Service. While there are plenty of singers that could do a great job, I think we're due for another instrumental score."
JamesBond,2vwktk,Willravel,2,Sat Feb 14 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"That was a great theme, but I think the money cash in to sell an actual song along with the new Bond is too great for them to forego it and go straight instrumental."
JamesBond,2vwktk,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:17:16 2015 UTC,I always seem to go back to that one being my favorite theme. It just hits every right note. So good.

JamesBond,2vwktk,BlueIceClimber,3,Sun Feb 15 00:21:38 2015 UTC,"That and they've shown that they can do a Bond theme already, since Supremacy might as well be one."
JamesBond,2vwktk,TheKevinShow,2,Sun Feb 15 03:59:40 2015 UTC,I agree with this.  They've got a bond theme in them...
JamesBond,2vwktk,waynezii,2,Sun Feb 15 17:39:26 2015 UTC,I'm convinced they actually wrote Supremacy to be a Bond theme. It actually contains the James Bond theme...
JamesBond,2vwktk,watchstarsgoout7,3,Sun Feb 15 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"But it's about brainwashing children though media. Muse may be good, but please keep politics out of a Bond tune."
JamesBond,2vwktk,Badmecha007,2,Sun Feb 15 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I meant musically, definitely not lyrically."
JamesBond,2vwktk,watchstarsgoout7,2,Mon Feb 16 03:26:58 2015 UTC,Absolutely MUSE. Every song of theirs is an epic musical production. They already do so much with full orchestra accompaniment that any halfway competent composer (e.g. not Thomas Newman) could do an awesome score that folds their title theme into the mix throughout the movie.
JamesBond,2vwktk,Brochitect,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"I always thought their rendition of Feeling Good wouldn't be out of place in a Bond movie, but when they dropped Supremacy it really felt like they were just screaming out that they wanted to do the theme for Skyfall. I'd love for them to do the theme for SPECTRE."
JamesBond,2vwktk,sdesaulniers,1 point,Mon Feb 16 22:28:38 2015 UTC,"MUSE! fuck yes, I've been wanting them to do it for a while now, since they are the only act that has been tossed around that can actually write orchestral scores. the only people i could approve besides them is Lana, Florence, or Gaga. Sam smith can go fuck himself, he sucks, and is unoriginal. Gaga has surprised us twice by being very classy at two major award shows, and would probably kill as the opening singer. But Muse would still kill even more."

JamesBond,2vwktk,dodd1331,2,Mon Feb 16 12:23:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt they're going to ever do a Bond theme, because The Last Shadow Puppets is sort of on hiatus since both Alex Turner and Miles Kane are busy with their own productions (Miles has his own solo career and Alex has the Arctic Monkeys). I am certain however that the Arctic Monkeys might someday write and perform a Bond theme. They've got the style, they've got the knowhow and they're quintessentially British."

JamesBond,2vvilr,mydarkmeatrises,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:23:55 2015 UTC,the score for Skyfall had a very traditional James Bond theme by Thomas Newman on it you just have to listen because it is under a different title than James Bond theme

JamesBond,2vvilr,Brochitect,0,Tue Feb 17 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"I believe that is the record labels fault. Adele was on XL Records so they released the theme, but Thomas Newman's score was released by Sony Classical."
JamesBond,2vvilr,djduckflap,3,Sat Feb 14 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to the incidental music of the film. 007 Theme, not the James Bond Theme. They're two different pieces of music and the 007 theme hasn't been done since Moonraker."
JamesBond,2vvilr,mydarkmeatrises,0,Sun Feb 15 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not a fan at all of the 007 Theme (different from the James Bond theme). It may have worked in the 60's and 70's, but it's just too happy/campy/adventure-y for any sequence that would happen in a Daniel Craig Bond movie. I think it seems a little dated.  Also, in your Moonraker example, the tempo has always annoyed me. It's way too lethargic and really weighs down the action and drama. Because of the repetition and predictability of it too, you know for certain that the action is just going to continue as planned for the next 4, 8, 16, or more, measures, and there's no tension when there's any twist in the action.  IMO, David Arnold nailed it in the crane chase sequence of the Casino Royale opening. That nuanced little bit where Craig runs along the beam and leaps to pipes hanging from the crane goes just perfectly along with the action, rising in pitch and tension, and I honestly feel the pit of my stomach drop when he makes that leap, rather than back in Moonraker where massive mortars are exploding all over in the water, but hey, let's just toss in a tired old theme song in a major key.  EDIT: clarity"
JamesBond,2vvilr,Brochitect,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, but I think composers these days are well versed enough to slow the music and change the cadence therefore changing the feel of the music. I imagine the bass line of the 007 Theme before the melody slowed down with deep bass drums to establish the tone.   It'll be a good nod to the true fans of the earlier films."
JamesBond,2vvilr,mydarkmeatrises,1 point,Wed Feb 18 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"Along those lines, David Arnold did a fantastic job of that in his debut with Tomorrow Never Dies. As the story goes, before Arnold was hired, he created the Bond cover album ""Shaken and Stirred"", which even earned the attention and praise of John Barry himself. With that, he got the job as composer with Barry's blessing, and Arnold's way of thanking him was to incorporate the brass fanfare from the instrumental theme of From Russia With Love's title sequence into the score for the opening scene of Tomorrow Never Dies.  Edit: So yeah, a competent composer who is also a respectable Bond fan and appreciates those homages and references (like David Arnold) would be fully capable of updating the 007 theme for a Craig-era film. But as far as Thomas Newman doing that, I have my very heavy doubts.  Edit: formatting"
JamesBond,2vvilr,Brochitect,0,Wed Feb 18 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I can't understand how you can find the original theme happy... it's pretty epic, even relative to today's standards, and its written in the minor key.  As for your adjective ""campy""- if anything, the David Arnold piece you linked fits the definition of campy.: refers to intentionally exaggerated thematic or genre elements, especially in television and motion picture mediums. The entire piece you linked to is one overly exaggerated, stressed, overly produced song... not that that is an issue, as it works in this scene. But the original theme is DEFINITELY not campy- there was nothing similar to it at the time of composition.  And ""adventury""? James Bond is The original Action Adventure Hero (own him today)."

JamesBond,2vvilr,Brochitect,2,Wed Feb 18 18:18:40 2015 UTC,Haha. I never knew that this was called the 007 theme. TIL. That changes everything.   I think this has a pretty cool riff to it but the majority of the piece just doesn't fit with the franchise. It has never worked well in the older scenes- I have no clue why Berry took a happy major approach after the opening riff.  I apologize for my ignorance. I learned something knew today.

JamesBond,2vvilr,AUBalrog,1 point,Mon Feb 16 16:21:21 2015 UTC,I'd love this or his job on the score. I also feel like Michael Giachinno would just bring that great nostalgic sentiment to the score. If anyone has heard the score to the Incredibles you know what I mean.   Nolan has said he'd love to direct a Bond film. If that were the case I'm sure Hans would be along for that ride.

JamesBond,2vuqao,I_Will_Be_Blunt_,4,Sat Feb 14 06:56:17 2015 UTC,"A big component of his success on Bond was his relationship with his DoP, Phil Meheux. They have been working together since the Professionals tv show in the late 70's. Together they brought a much more dynamic visual style to Goldeneye than had been present in much of John Glen's work."
JamesBond,2vuqao,captars,4,Sat Feb 14 11:21:19 2015 UTC,"I always disliked John Glen as a director. His films were dull and lifeless; almost robotic, even. He lacked style or flavor. There isn't much tension in the scenes that need them. You never get a real sense of danger. Instead, the action just happens. It's so blasé.  And don't get me started on those fucking jump scares with birds (or monkeys, in the case of The Living Daylights).  If Martin Campbell had director any of the Dalton films, they would have been far better than what they ended up being."

JamesBond,2vuqao,Shanyi,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:46:13 2015 UTC,"He's a strong technical director, meaning he stages and shoots with great clarity. That's a great thing when the script and performances are good, he'll give them the right foundations to shine and never drown them under directorial tics. That's why he's so good for starting 'new eras', so to speak: he establishes a consistent, clear tone and allows his actors to do their work. Neither Goldeneye or Casino Royale had especially good dialogue, but he directed Brosnan and Craig very well, told the stories well and shot the action very tidily. Contrast that to Die Another Day or Quantum Of Solace, where messy and over-stylised direction only exacerbated existing problems. The downside is that when the script isn't great, Campbell won't add anything to it - see Green Lantern, for instance."

It could be Bond trying to take out ISIS cells in Eastern Europe/The Middle East.   Maybe a sex-trafficking ring between Mexico and USA. He could be looking for clues as to which US Congressman, or judge or governor is leading it and the CIA didn't want to get invlolved because of mole possibilities. This could lead to Awesome scenes in The Grand canyon, Rockies, The Plains, The Blue Ridge Parkway. Just imagine an epic chase scene on the Blue Ridge Parkway, or James Bond tracking someone who kidnaps people on the AT, leading to a night where Bond makes love in a tent on the AT overlooking the Great Smokey Mountain Nation Park. It'd be a more action packed movie with little plot, but the idea behind it would be more of Bond as a trigger man.  These ideas might be better suited for an Opening Scene, although a bit in the longer side, but it could be done if it's setting is of a Casino Royal esc Opening only with three three different setting instead of two."

He's every bit as passionate with her as he is with Agent Fields in Quantum of Solace or Solange in Casino Royale.

I can understand them switching from one Walther to another, but the brand is too iconic for the character. He shouldn't start his mission with an HK pistol."

JamesBond,2vnfdo,KW1Xan,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"In the novel ""Carte Blanche"" Bond uses a PPS.  Since it's a modern Bond novel it makes sense that a modern Bond wouldn't be using a pre WW2 design like the PPK.  The PPS is the natural choice for a man in his line of work.  I think the only issue with this gun in the novel is that Bond's is the 40 caliber version, but seems to have the ammo capacity of the 9mm.  Personally I would go with the 9mm because you get a couple of extra rounds, which would mean more to a crack shot like Bond then shear stopping power.  At least most of the time."

Plus the Blu-ray commentary is also one of the best, for those who dig that sorta thing.  The book was indeed a masterpiece, it's VERY hard to pick out the best book - in that regards, it is very subjective.

I think Skyfall would be my clear favorite if the plot was a little tighter. In any case, I think I'd give it the slight edge as it's so much fun to watch. I'd argue it's the most beautiful Bond film, and a beautiful film in its own right; Roger Deakins did a fantastic job with the cinematography, deservedly got an Oscar nod, and maybe should have won. There are just so many shots and scenes in Skyfall that still have the 'wow' effect even after multiple viewings - Shanghai skyscraper, Macau casino, the field as Skyfall burns in the background, among others. The theme song and title art was great, and the score for the film was solid too. And of course, there was plenty of screen time for Judi Dench, and Judi Dench is awesome."

I loved that Casino Royale was grounded, realistic, and emotional, especially after the horrible Buy Another Day. I also think Skyfall was amazing! It was the perfect throwback for the 50th anniversary. I loved the theme song, the over-the-top villain, the ridiculous plot, the action, the cheesy yet awesome one liners. I thought QoS was kind of meh. The fact that the evil plan was to monopolize water was kinda stupid if they were trying to go for a realistic tone, so to see Skyfall scrap that and pull out all the stops was about as refreshing to me as CR was originally. So I can't pick one over the other."
JamesBond,2vodxw,keysersoze1015,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"Casino Royale.  I think Royale is the best emotional Bond film and the stars--especially Eva Green, Giancarlo Giannini, and Daniel Craig--are superb.  The ending is tragic and a great reasoning of how James Bond became James Bond.  The parkour beginning is sensational.  My major qualm about the film is the ludicrousness of the poker scenes.  Skyfall is pretty good, but lacking the panache of Royale.  While the acting of Javier Bardem is great, the plot doesn't really make sense--Bond becomes a recluse, the villian wanted to get caught the whole time and adult Home Alone is basically act four."

The lines ""If you take a life, do you know what you'll give / Odds are, you won't like what it is"" mirror the scene in the shower where Vesper can't deal with the fact that she's helped kill a man.   ""I've seen angels fall from blinding heights / But you yourself are nothing so divine / Just next in line"" - Vesper is the next in line of a long list of women Bond has been with, and her not being ""so divine"" foreshadows her betrayal at the end of the film.   ""...if you must pretend / You may meet your end"" - Le Chiffre screwed around with his clients' money and it got him killed.   ""The coldest blood runs through my veins / You know my name"" - while M is ""cold,"" it's Bond who must learn to remain detached and we do know his name, though he doesn't do his ""Bond, James Bond"" until the very end.   It's an interesting interpretation that the song is written from M's point of view, however it makes just as much sense coming from 007's as well. Plus, every song sung by a woman - point of view of a female companion or someone who want's to be WITH Bond, every song by a male - Bond's point of view OR the point of view of someone longing to BE Bond."

JamesBond,2vfi0c,Awesomerific7,3,Tue Feb 10 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"The best term I would use for Fleming describing other cultures is a 'back handed compliment'. From his stand-point he would think he's being quite polite, but through OUR cultural lens he's being very colonial in his attitude."
JamesBond,2vfi0c,Gamblor,3,Wed Feb 11 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Yeah, when I see Fleming, he just doesn't quite strike me as a hateful person. That's not how I see him come off. Perhaps a little naive but not like a monster. I find him to be very complex man and the whole situation with his son is just extremely sad. I admire that he knew exactly what he wanted to do from the very beginning with the James Bond intellectual property. And his wartime exploits are captivating."

JamesBond,2vfi0c,dragonsky,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:17:51 2015 UTC,oh boy. Well I haven't gotten through all of them but Casino Royale is a real breeze. I love the omnibuses though. I love comics and art a lot so those are really fun. And we never had them printed here in the States originally. It's funny but also awesome to think exposed women's nipples is completely normal in a newspaper comic strip. Pardon the pun. Oh and I really wanna read Thrilling Cities. The thought of Fleming writing a travel book is devilishly amusing.
JamesBond,2vfi0c,dragonsky,2,Tue Feb 10 22:27:40 2015 UTC,I have the same edition of all the nooks and I absolutely love the artwork on them.
JamesBond,2vfi0c,dragonsky,2,Wed Feb 11 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, the new wave of art that came out of Amazon acquiring the publishing rights is fantastic! I'm a big, big fan of minimalism.It's actually what spurred me to start getting them all.

JamesBond,2vfi0c,GetFreeCash,2,Wed Feb 11 01:50:51 2015 UTC,Volume 006 like literally JUST came out not very long ago. So 005 must be pretty new too. But I remember seeing 006 available for pre-order a very short time ago.
JamesBond,2vfi0c,Clancy_B_Shanty,2,Tue Feb 10 23:17:39 2015 UTC,Cool. For some odd reason I thought the collection stopped at volume 4.
JamesBond,2vfi0c,Darkimus-prime,2,Wed Feb 11 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"They stop at 6, at least the comic strip does. There's no more titles after that. Which kinda makes me sad, no Volume 007 :("

JamesBond,2vhbgk,Clancy_B_Shanty,3,Wed Feb 11 00:41:11 2015 UTC,"I just realized earlier today that I solidly believe the Fleming Books > Movies > Other Books heirarchy.  Bond belongs to Fleming. What he said is set in stone fact, and all we have is his books. After Fleming died, Bond became the campy, over the top spy in the movies with the gadgets and the girls that every layman remembers. I just regard post-fleming Bond books as glorified fan fiction."
JamesBond,2vhbgk,PinkysAvenger,2,Wed Feb 11 02:43:53 2015 UTC,I try to regard the films as an equal pillar with the books.  But the 2nd pass through the novels thus far seems to endear them to me a little more.
JamesBond,2vhbgk,PinkysAvenger,5,Wed Feb 11 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"Seeing the impact of the Bond films, its almost like they're seperate entities.   The books are fantastic. Gripping, efficient thrillers about an everyman hero doing his best and enjoying life while he can with fast cars, good food, exotic women, and enough booze to sink the Bismark.  The movies are iconic. Campy, over the top, spy almost comedies with gadgets, women, and vodka martinis facing off against stupidly elaborate plans for world domination.  I'm a bartender by trade, and I feel the actual effects of the Bond films on popular culture every day. A martini, by defention, should be gin and dry vermouth. But at least 75% of people who walk into a bar and ask for a martini want vodka. Thats not because it tastes better or is cheaper. They just know the cocktail that way, and they know the cocktail because of James Bond, shaken, not stirred. Hell, I don't even know the last time I've stirred a martini."
JamesBond,2vhbgk,1701ncc,2,Wed Feb 11 03:10:08 2015 UTC,"No lie, I feel your pain with whole martini business. I tend to play barkeep when I attend a party and MOST of my friends now know that when ask me to make a martini, they are getting 2oz of Bombay or Gordon's and a cap full of vermouth and that fucker is going to be stirred."

JamesBond,2vf8sp,dibsODDJOB,3,Tue Feb 10 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"Well the only two major films that were non EON are hard to take seriously, especially Casino Royale.  And the EON films are what 99% of society refers to when they think of James Bond."
JamesBond,2vf8sp,jamedudijench,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"Kinda my point. Like, if what this website is claiming is true and it's one of those ""Jimmy Bond Casino Royale CBS television"" type deals, would anybody really care? No, probably not."
JamesBond,2vf8sp,jamedudijench,7,Tue Feb 10 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"Good point, but still it's Roger Moore as James Bond before he was ""Bond,"" if you know what I mean."
JamesBond,2vf8sp,HaroldPelham,-1,Tue Feb 10 21:40:01 2015 UTC,I gotcha. Kinda like Brosnan and Remington Steele.
JamesBond,2vf8sp,jamedudijench,3,Tue Feb 10 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's not like Brosnan and Remington Steele. Steele is a private detective who doesn't know his real name; he is not a spy called James Bond. This is Roger Moore playing James Bond in a comedy sketch. You could maybe place it amongst the first two Casino Royale movies and Never Say Never Again. It's more similar to Peter Serafinowicz playing James Bond in his sketch Licence to Tell Jokes. What's remarkable about this sketch on Mainly Millicent is that Roger Moore is playing Bond in a comedy sketch, and 9 years later he would actually come to be James Bond. Have you even seen this sketch? It's on the Live and Let Die DVD and Blu-ray, and it's on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYkTwXAyOBU"
JamesBond,2vf8sp,HaroldPelham,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"Well. If you're gonna be literal about it...  At any rate, we at least do know how close Brosnan came to being the next Bond earlier on before Dalton."
JamesBond,2vf8sp,jamedudijench,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"The big deal here is that Moore is playing someone named ""James Bond"". It just seems like you didn't get the point of the irony of this sketch. Brosnan technically was James Bond in 1986, he just didn't get very far before he had to back out."
JamesBond,2vf8sp,HaroldPelham,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"No i get it. It's very ironic! I guess, I dunno, it just seems like that role is hardly James Bond and more on the Maxwell Smart side of things, Adam West Batman, if you will. Not to say the performance is bad, it's actually great. What I mean to say is in the pantheon of pre-role roles, Brosnan did better by Remington Steele than Roger Moore did by Mainly Millicent. Though again, not to say one Bond was ultimately better than the other, they were both different and that's fine. But I do get that this is certainly more ironic and interesting than in Brosnan's case."

JamesBond,2vi9lc,jamedudijench,7,Wed Feb 11 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered if the only reason we love GoldenEye is because of the awesome video game. Not a terrible movie in over all, but I think the video game made the movie for most people in my generation..."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,tbe_dentist,6,Wed Feb 11 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"No, if you watch every single movie in a row, Goldeneye does stand out as one of the better films, especially after the many travesties that were the Moore era. It's much more complex and is the first Bond film to have a modern feel to it. Yes, the game helped, but the movie was good enough to stand on its own. It's the later Brosnan films that actually weigh Goldeneye down, and Brosnan's reputation as well. But I'll take Brosnan, easily, over Grandpa Moore."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"If you watch the movies, think about the time they were made. Placing them in context, all the movies make much more sense. All Bonds represent the time they were made in. So if whether it was Moore sucking face with faaaar too young women or Dalton hiding his inner manpain, think about actually WHEN they were made :D"
JamesBond,2vi9lc,QueenOfBubbles,1 point,Thu Feb 12 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, trust me, I absolutely do that. I even read the reviews of the time to get a better feel for how they were received. And most critics agreed Moore's films were too campy at the time."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:11:26 2015 UTC,You're preaching to the choir. I bought all the DVDs individually (couldn't afford the boxset at the time) and I deliberately skipped Moonraker. It's horrifying :D
JamesBond,2vi9lc,QueenOfBubbles,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:44:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, that one I actually like more than I should. I think it goes so far overboard it enters new ""good because it's bad"" territory. Also, it was bumped ahead of FYEO mainly in a business move to react to the Star Wars craze. Which turned out to be a good decision because it was the highest grossing film all the way until Goldeneye."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that it earned that much! Cool:D What's you absolute favorite movies than? Best movie from Connery, Moore, Pierce and Craig?"
JamesBond,2vi9lc,QueenOfBubbles,1 point,Thu Feb 12 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"Connery: FRWL . Tatiana is my favorite Bond girl.     Lazenby: OHMSS obviously, but it's in my top 10 overall, maybe top 5.     Moore: TMWTGG. I admit this probably isn't as great as a film as I think it is, I liked the idea of it more than the execution. TSWLM is also up there, and Moore's best performance might have been LALD.     Dalton: The Living Daylights. License to Kill didn't feel like a Bond movie to me, and not in a good way.  Would have liked to see another Dalton film.   Brosnan: Goldeneye. Shame they ramped up the silliness as his movies went on, much like Moore.   Humble brag, it's my favorite movie and he agreed with me on his own AMA, which he responded to. So we're basically BFFs.   Craig: Casino Royale. Didn't love it at first, but over time and compared to his next two efforts, I think it holds up the best. Skyfall sure was pretty to look at though."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:05:17 2015 UTC,"Liking this list of yours:D As for Connery, I'm a fan of Goldfinger (No Mr Bond I expect you to die!!).  Though perhaps a little cheesy I am a fan of Octopussy. Moore is too old for this as well, but it's just so spyish and they use the east-west angel so well.  Dalton- agree with. License to Kill reminds me of that Doctor Who movies they set to the US in hopes of exporting him.  Brosnan- You're BFF is right. Golden Eye is the perfect Bond Movie. Craig - I like him. Sort of missing a good Bond Girl in the last one (Moneypenny doesn't count :). May I ask, who do you think would make a good next Bond?"
JamesBond,2vi9lc,QueenOfBubbles,1 point,Fri Feb 13 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"Ya, Craig didn't really have a classic Bond girl in QoS, either. Olga was there, but she wasn't the traditional love interest. Since it was a true continuation from CR, they really played up his loss of Vesper. Also, you could make the argument that Skyfall's Bond girl was actually M, since the third act was focused on her and the movie was largely about her departure from the franchise.   I really don't have a strong opinion on who a new Bond would be. Craig has one more after SPECTRE, and if they have a little break that would be probably 5 years until a new Bond actor. Idris Elba and Fassbender are both great actors, but I don't really want either of them because they've got too much history, and they'd both be a little too old for what I think a new Bond should be."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,dibsODDJOB,3,Fri Feb 13 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that had the most to do with the popularity. Because it came out much later than the movie IIRC. I mean I remember kids making guns out of paper and we would play ""Goldeneye"" in the schoolyard at recess. If you had yellow paper that was the golden gun. So I can vouch that the game had arguably a bigger impact than the movie with the generation. It was a lot of our generation's introduction to James Bond. So yeah, that says a lot."
JamesBond,2vi9lc,jamedudijench,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:20:03 2015 UTC,Also because I don't think the same can be said for the Tomorrow Never Dies or The World is Not Enough films and video games.

Then the last Pierce Brosnan movies, along with QoS (because I can't remember a single thing that happened in that film). Then it's Lazenby's Marrige Film (Though I absolutely LOOOOve the fact that the Bond family motto is: The World is not Enough) Then Timothy Dalton's two movies aren't really that bad. (that poor bastard is hurting) At second place is the perfection that is Sean Connery And at the pinnacle, first place, Casino Royal and Skyfall.  Love them both."

JamesBond,2vbvqx,akanefive,3,Tue Feb 10 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite things about the Bond canon of movies is how each one is a time capsule of design. The clothes, the cars, the sets - the very nature of the subject insists that every movie showcase the most contemporary, and the most chic, style of the times. Every production employed supremely talented artists and craftsmen making sure the Bond style delivered. It's a joy to go back through them and examine every detail."
JamesBond,2vbvqx,CohibaVancouver,2,Tue Feb 10 21:24:09 2015 UTC,Yes totally! And even the movie style at the time.
JamesBond,2vbvqx,akanefive,2,Tue Feb 10 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"Which is kinda funny, because the first 2 (maybe Goldfinger included) films have arguably aged the best. They're the most down to earth of the bunch."
JamesBond,2vbvqx,CohibaVancouver,2,Wed Feb 11 01:44:53 2015 UTC,Drax was awesome in that movie. Credit where credit is due.
JamesBond,2vbvqx,akanefive,2,Wed Feb 11 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"I mostly dislike this film because Drax's multiple, absurd assassination attempts defy all common-sense or realism. He starts out by immediately trying to have Bond killed for little to no reason, on his own property while Bond was visiting him in an official capacity for the British government. He proceeds with these ham-fisted assassination attempts by trying to kill Bond no less than 12 times. At one point (I believe time #7 or 8) he tells Bond that he's defied ""every attempt to plan an interesting death for [him]"". He then proceeds to plan an interesting death for him. So it made no sense to try and just kill Bond at the beginning of the movie; but when Bond sneaks into his Mayan launch-site, or whatever the hell it is, Drax has no reason not to just immediately have him executed. So he can't kill Bond when it makes sense to do so, but he tries to do it for no reason earlier. Got it. Not that it matters, because he fails constantly.  This is the problem with having the 'plot' of your film just be Bond going from A to B, surviving assassination attempt after assassination attempt. It makes the villain look incompetent, for one; but it's just bad writing and that's only one of many, many problems with this movie. There's more to a Bond film than that, or at least there should be."
JamesBond,2vbvqx,rap31264,3,Wed Feb 11 02:40:16 2015 UTC,I just have an incredibly hard time with the space stuff. It's not just that they're in space - it's that the villain built a fully functioning space station and discovered artificial gravity without anyone knowing. Plus the space marine battle? It's impossible to take seriously.
JamesBond,2vbvqx,TheKevinShow,2,Tue Feb 10 00:01:37 2015 UTC,"and discovered artificial gravity   He didn't 'discover' artificial gravity - He spun the station to simulate it.  Agree though, that it's ludicrous that he would have been able to build it with no one noticing."
JamesBond,2vbvqx,TableCluster,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:18:17 2015 UTC,Right but artificial gravity doesn't actually exist.
JamesBond,2vbvqx,pinkpanthers,2,Tue Feb 10 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"If you 'spin' a wheel-shaped space station about its axis you'll get 'artificial gravity' around its outside edge and things will be drawn in that direction - But you'll certainly not get station-wide gravity like you saw in the film.  But if you want to poke holes, I'd start with the chest-mounted lasers worn by Drax's troops as the Space Marines :)"
JamesBond,2vbvqx,ThomasIrvin,2,Tue Feb 10 05:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think we're saying the same thing - it's just one of those suspension of disbelief moments that I couldn't get on board with, and then when the marines show up it just gets worse."

Lot's of good action, lot's of nice pictures, DC is just a badass as usual!  Edit: And I don't watch Bond movies for plot. I watch to see cool places, beautiful girls, and some badass shit by 007."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,DonManolo,5,Mon Feb 9 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"The story is weak   You may or may not be aware of the story being partially written/re-written by Craig himself, due the writer's guild strike at the time.  Story here:  We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers’ strike and there was nothing we could do."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,Circus_Maximus,4,Mon Feb 9 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"I remember disliking this movie the first time I saw it in theaters, but I think that is now based entirely on just how much I love casino royale.

JamesBond,2v9tpj,RGSagahstoomeh,4,Mon Feb 9 09:57:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, it suffers being between Casino Royal and Skyfall, two of the very best. As a film in its own right it is still a fantastic Bond movie."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,ManicsObsessive,9,Mon Feb 9 12:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yes! Great review. I agree with you, a bad picture it is not. Not enough people watch it as the follow-up to Casino Royale. Fun fact in case you didn't know, the 4 major action scenes were based on the 4 elements. The quarry chase (earth), boat chase (water), plane chase (air), and the final battle at the desert building (fire) were all stylistic choices by one of the filmmakers. And yes, the cinematography is GORGEOUS. Skyfall looked good too but it was a little bleak at times, probably the point but, gun to my head, I'd have to say Quantum of Solace had the better picture quality."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,jamedudijench,13,Mon Feb 9 11:46:19 2015 UTC,I rank it higher than Skyfall for the sole reason that I hate the villian's motivation in Skyfall. It has zero global impact. Its just straight up boring.   I do love QOS though.
JamesBond,2v9tpj,acomputer1,11,Mon Feb 9 07:33:08 2015 UTC,"That's actually why I like Skyfall. It's hard to care about the world, but it is easy to care about his target: M."

JamesBond,2v9tpj,DonManolo,5,Tue Feb 10 07:27:10 2015 UTC,"The car chase, plane scene, and set piece in the eco-hotel are arguably better action set pieces than anything else seen in any of the other Craig movies.  The cinematography does get annoying after a while though."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,-WISCONSIN-,2,Mon Feb 9 16:24:06 2015 UTC,I agree with this. The car chase would have been so much better if it were filmed well.

JamesBond,2v9tpj,DXPetti,2,Mon Feb 9 09:13:16 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but it's always going to stand in stark contrast to Casino Royale (not the Peter Sellers one you smartass) which is one of the best Bond films not only in the modern era but ever.  In that regard QOS is a major letdown, which is perhaps unfair but that's the way the cookie crumbles."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,Zentaurion,2,Mon Feb 9 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the title said Quantum Leap and was looking forward to seeing a connection to Bond.  I agree that the hate for QoS is unjustified. It's a good movie and I'm gonna say, I freakin loved the opening theme. It was catchy by itself, it matches the themes in the story, and it felt like it was invoking a youthful new era rather than maintaining baggage.  I would rather watch QoS than OHMSS, whitch I just don't understand the love for. A lot of the classic Bond movies just don't make any sense seen from the eyes of a modern moviegoer. If an hour was cut out from the middle of OHMSS I might consider it worth watching. Also I don't care for Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice, and others.  QoS I suspect the perceived hatred for it was propagated by scriptwriters trying to make job safety by painting movies made during the writers strike as irredeemably bad."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,ax_reddit,2,Mon Feb 9 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"The editing reminds me of ""On her Majesty's Secret Service"".  What I like about this movie is that it lacks all the gravitas of ""Casino Royal"" and the seconds half of ""Skyfall"". It has a lot of remarkable scenes: The motorcycle jump onto the boat, the beginning of the Tosca chase, the benefiz-party in its whole, the side-camera of the cars driving through the tunnels.  They made a quick, short action-movie. It is lightweight and a showcase of how to overlay a lack of a script with a furious use of different filming techniques.  And: You don't see the James Bond villain die."
JamesBond,2v9tpj,jo_maka,2,Tue Feb 10 20:50:32 2015 UTC,"The theme is the Side B of You Know My Name, if you just take the music without the lyrics. It's the Venom to Casino Royale's Spiderman. Raw, chaotic, acute and heavy, instead of confident, cocky and almost happy-go-lucky.  The duet is also a good mirror of the Bond-Montes dynamic. For once we're having a Bond girl on an equal footing as James. Camille is Keys is the obsessive single-minded B note of the piano. James is White is the guitar that wrecks everything around him.  I love that theme."

JamesBond,2v2bce,staber95,7,Sat Feb 7 04:50:58 2015 UTC,so Bond's fake identity is about 9 months younger than Daniel Craig.
JamesBond,2v2bce,Hyperman360,5,Sat Feb 7 05:24:44 2015 UTC,why does his fake ID need to be the same age as him?
JamesBond,2v2bce,daedalus_x,2,Sat Feb 7 08:07:31 2015 UTC,And why does his fake name have the same initials as Bond?
JamesBond,2v2bce,Hyperman360,4,Sat Feb 7 17:41:17 2015 UTC,It's generally good tradecraft to have an alias be as close to the real name as possible to facilitate remembering it
JamesBond,2v2bce,arafinwe,1 point,Sat Feb 7 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"Fair point, actually."
JamesBond,2v2bce,antaresiv,3,Sat Feb 7 22:05:38 2015 UTC,I think until Skyfall Bond made more sense if he was a few years younger than Daniel.
JamesBond,2v2bce,justlookqueen,2,Sat Feb 7 13:17:41 2015 UTC,Maybe that's his real name and James Bond is the alias

JamesBond,2v3ilu,GetFreeCash,10,Sat Feb 7 15:44:52 2015 UTC,There is no debate. It's called hype. With people pushing it. And I just hope that hype dies out soon. I'll start paying attention if Barbara Broccoli speaks up.

JamesBond,2v3ilu,bane187,7,Wed Feb 11 02:45:43 2015 UTC,This debate is so fucking pathetic. The character of James Bond is a white man. End of story.
JamesBond,2v3ilu,i_fuck_for_breakfast,-2,Sat Feb 7 16:27:44 2015 UTC,You think James Bond is defined by the color of his skin?
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Willravel,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"Should we do an Oprah Biopic where she is played by Meryl Streep? If you say no, I say why not? Is Oprah defined by the color of her skin?"
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Enriquepollazzo,5,Sat Feb 7 21:40:22 2015 UTC,"Someone like Lando Calrissian would be a better example, because even though his character isn't in any way defined by his race (in the Star Wars universe his race is just ""human""), you wouldn't cast a white guy to play him.  I think the problem with recasting Bond as black, female,  American, a dwarf, or gay (making the character gay, I've got no issue with a gay actor playing a straight Bond) is that you immediately lose any sense of character continuity, you're drawing a line that says ""this isn't the same person from all those other films"".   If the ""Bond is a codename"" theory was true (it's not), such a recasting wouldn't be an issue for me, but since he is ""the same guy"" (timeline shifts withstanding) a spontaneous (and likely unacknowledged) race change wouldn't make sense."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Canis_Ex_Machina,-2,Sun Feb 8 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"Hold on a second. You know James Bond is a fictitious character, right? He never existed. Photographs and videos of the original, real James Bond haven't been seen by the public for years. There aren't personal friends of his who can attest to what he looks like."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Willravel,1 point,Sat Feb 7 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"But he was written by a real author. Those books exist and are the basis for the franchise. In said books, Fleming gives a clear description of who Bond is, and he is not a black man.  Just like Meryl Streep is not a black woman."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Enriquepollazzo,-1,Sun Feb 8 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"But he was written by a real author.    No one's trying to make Ian Fleming black, so that's a non sequitur.   James Bond is a fictional character who's been changed perhaps more than any other. He's been taller, shorter, leaner, bigger, brunette bordering on black hair, blond, serious, funny, realistic, science fictiony, and everything in between. I grew up on the novels, and one of the first things I learned is that the movie version is unlike the novel version. Even in Casino Royale, which is perhaps the closest in behavior to the original, they're two very distinct characters.   Do you remember the description from the books? James Bond is supposed to look like the composer Hoagy Carmichael, meaning tall (183 cm) and quite lean, particularly in the face, black hair, and blue-grey eyes. He's also supposed to have a three-inch scar on his right cheek, a scar on the back of his hand. All of that has been true of precisely none of the actors in the movies. None were that lean, none ever had a facial scar or scar on the hand, and none had black hair.   If you were such a purist, you'd have a problem with Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan and Craig, not just Elba.   It's weird how hung up people are about James Bond's race. It's the Heimdall thing all over again."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Willravel,4,Sun Feb 8 00:52:47 2015 UTC,"You might be the one hung up on his race.   I won't rehash stuff we all already know just to make a longer post.   Fleming wrote the character a certain way. All of the casting choices have reflected the way the character was written. Fans have responded by going to the movies and buying the books to a smaller degree.  If people want to make spy thrillers with different characters than James Bond, from different backgrounds, who is stopping them? Noone. 007 is not the only character in the world. But he is a specific character. Leave him alone."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Enriquepollazzo,-2,Sun Feb 8 01:16:36 2015 UTC,"You might be the one hung up on his race.   How can one by hung up on something they say doesn't matter? I think Idris Elba could make for a good actor for the role. I don't think the amount of melanin in his skin would impact his performance.    Fleming wrote the character a certain way.   A way which has only ever been partially translated in the movies. Even in movies that are decent adaptations of the source material, the character tends to be different, whether physically or in personality and choices. We've never had a direct adaptation of a Bond novel.   Which Bond actor do you think most closely resembles Hoagy Charmichael?"
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Willravel,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:24:37 2015 UTC,'she doth protest too much' and timothy dalton.
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Enriquepollazzo,-1,Sun Feb 8 01:28:19 2015 UTC,"I have seen the exact same reasoning used by Limbaugh when he said it would be like casting George Clooney to play Barack Obama. The thing is Oprah and Obama are non-fictional characters whereas James Bond is a fictional character. I think his gender defines him more so than his race in the movies and is more central to his character.  The ONLY film to ever explicitly recognize Bond's race was Live and Let Die and that film played off of race specifically by the producers and they will not re-visit that again. If a black Bond is cast it will not be because he is black, but more so because he fits the 007 archetype. Especially with the points that Saltzman made in this article, it seems open to possibility. I think Elba might be getting a bit too old for the role though and I feel that age would be a greater limiting factor.  Also what about the character of Felix Leiter being played by actors of different races? I did not see that making the headlines too much. While it would be surprising to many audiences at first, I feel that the casting of a black James Bond would not matter in the long run if teamed up with a great script and director."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,Stmoore007,-2,Sun Feb 8 06:02:34 2015 UTC,"No, but the actor would become bigger than the movie. It would be too distracting. James Bond is supposed to be a white, tall, dark haired male and that's how he should be for now atleast.   I'd be kinda ok with a black James Bond actually if it wasn't pushed by people with a politically correct agenda who probably doesn't care about James Bond in the first place but need to whine about it to make themselves feel like good human beings."
JamesBond,2v3ilu,i_fuck_for_breakfast,0,Sat Feb 7 20:14:02 2015 UTC,We've had two blond James Bonds who passed largely without comment. Most people love Craig's Bond. I don't think anyone who matters really cares.

JamesBond,2v0ss6,Iswitt,6,Fri Feb 6 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"There are two passages where Bond swims in the body of water outside the little hotel where he and Vesper have decided to stay for a while. One takes place at night, the other takes place at dawn, but I couldn't really find any detailed descriptions of the sky in either of them. I'll just post both just because I'm not sure which one you might need.  CHAPTER 23 - TIDE OF PASSION   He walked along the waterline on the hard golden sand until he was out of sight of the inn. Then he threw off his pyjama-coat and took a short run and a quick flat dive into the small waves. The beach shelved quickly and he kept underwater as long as he could, swimming with powerful strokes and feeling the soft coolness all over him. Then he surfaced and brushed the hair out of his eyes. It was nearly seven and the sun had lost much of its heat. Before long it would sink beneath the further arm of the bay, but now it was straight in his eyes and he turned on his back and swam away from it so that he could keep it with him as long as possible.  When he came ashore nearly a mile down the bay the shadows had already engulfed his distant pyjamas but he knew he had time to lie on the hard sand and dry before the tide of dusk reached him.  He took off his bathing-trunks and looked down at his body. There were only a few traces left of his injuries. He shrugged his shoulders and lay down with his limbs spread out in a star and gazed up at the empty blue sky and thought of Vesper.   CHAPTER 24 - 'FRUIT DÉFENDU'   The sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise. The small pink waves idly licked the sand. It was cold, but he took off his jacket and wandered naked along the edge of the sea to the point where he had bathed the evening before, then he walked slowly and deliberately into the water until it was just below his chin. He took his feet off the bottom and sank, holding his nose with one hand and shutting his eyes, feeling the cold water comb his body and his hair.  The mirror of the bay was unbroken except where it seemed a fish had jumped. Under the water he imagined the tranquil scene and wished that Vesper could just then come through the pines and be astonished to see him suddenly erupt from the empty seascape.  When after a full minute he came to the surface in a froth of spray, he was disappointed. There was no one in sight. For a time he swam and drifted and then when the sun seemed hot enough, he came in to the beach and lay on his back and revelled in the body which the night had given back to him.  As on the evening before, he stared up into the empty sky and saw the same answer there."
JamesBond,2v0ss6,GetFreeCash,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:58:24 2015 UTC,A curious thing with the books - Bond is on several occasions written as being naked but it never has any sexual connotations to it. It seems like he's just a man who's comfortable in his own skin.

I managed to download it in the small window of opportunity and forgot I had it on my computer until recently, as I have never seen it reuploaded anywhere else I figured I'd be that guy.  Hope you dig it!"
JamesBond,2uxgh1,starmapleleaf,4,Fri Feb 6 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"That was freaking beautiful.   Things I noticed:    Bond is dragged down by a female hand to death (this could mean so much)  Love how the skull popped up a couple times as a motif  When she says ""so overdue I owe them, swept away I'm stolen"" we see a graveyard and it ends with a single grave in the shot  Bond is literally shooting 4 shadows at a part and one of them looks like Javier Bardem? I think, I can't tell  When she sings the vaguely romantic bit (Where you go I gooo, what you see I seeeee...) we see a naked girl a lot but we see the cross a lot too (like what you would see in a graveyard) you see 2 graves at first in front of the Skyfall house"

For example, Bond fighting his shadows; one of them is Silva with the same wound Bond has, but Bond never fired on him. This tells you that he was either an old 00 or agent that 'M' betrayed.  The blood vessels that make up the skull briefly resembled the Underground network.  We knew Bond's psychological fitness would come into play with the moving Rorschach imagery near the end.  When Bond is being pulled underground, you'll see that the holes form a skull.  And unrelated, it had my favorite image in any title sequence: the targets of Bond on fire. Kleinman should have skipped the CGI dragons and zoomed in through the fiery bullet hole, transitioning to the figure strapped on the chairs. It would have been even more chilling than it already was."
