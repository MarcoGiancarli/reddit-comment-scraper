The u bend had large amounts of algal growth. This would cause air bubble build up as eventually led to loss of siphon. Huge mess"
ReefTank,3e4bbv,1911_,2,Wed Jul 22 01:51:57 2015 UTC,Why recommend bio balls to a new reefer who might not be able to maintain them.  Bio balls require constant cleaning in order to stay effective. They are not worth it most of the time
ReefTank,3e4bbv,stan13ag,2,Wed Jul 22 02:14:11 2015 UTC,To each their own. The bio balls give more surface area for nitrifying bacteria to grow. Also if you run your supply through a micron sock you'd only need to give the bio balls a light cleaning once in a while. But once again people are entitled to their own opinions.

The on-board control however is like a 360WE in the fact that it is only intensity up or down and spectrum up or down and only spans the 10k-20kish spectrum. The lenses on this unit are ovals instead of the standard circular lens, this is to lengthen the spread without giving up too much in depth or width. That being said. I have not had a chance to hook it up to my spectral controller nor put it above a tank or even dived into the manuals yet. So im positive there is more to this than i have found initially.

ReefTank,3e0w3u,icedearth15324,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"$2 dry vs $6 live for me.  The money really adds up when you need 50 lbs of it.  That $200 you save is a mid level skimmer, or half your lighting system, or couple of powerheads.  Plus you can pick the type of rock, what sizes and shapes, and so on instead of relying on what the LFS has in stock.  Also, you can take your time with your aqua-scape; drill or cut the rock, etc."

Measure the salt out out so you don't have to constantly fiddle with the refractometer or hydrometer. Get a cheap light timer and have a heater come on 2 hours before you plan on changing the water the next day.   If you really want to keep saltwater on hand, just make sure you have a strong powerhead, no need to heat it, just use the light timer and a heater to come on automatically when you need it to."

ReefTank,3dyvd3,Nitroleviathan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:59:30 2015 UTC,you didn't say what all of your parameters.  Do water changes and manually remove what you can  Not related  but the temp at 72 seems a bit low.
ReefTank,3dx65n,Dgkooo,7,Mon Jul 20 07:20:12 2015 UTC,"Small tanks are a rough way to start, particularly with coral. Many corals need excellent water quality (some species prefer dirtier water), which is harder to do in a smaller tank (less stable water parameters because of the low volume). I would honestly start with a few small fish (and we're talking SMALL fish in a tank that size) to get the hang of things, or consider a larger tank. That being said, it can be done. Start out with some easy to keep corals (mushrooms, xenia, polyps, etc). These will mostly be softies, but there are a few lps that are pretty easy to keep as well.   You will need good lighting. There are a lot of options out there, look for one that fits your budget and will be able to support the corals you hope to keep. I prefer LEDs, but they are a bit more expensive up front.   You will need rock. It can be dead/base rock, or live rock. If you get live rock, be sure to cycle it separately from any livestock (there is a die-off process that screws with water conditions). You can get substrate, or you can go bare bottom. Bare bottom is nice because it makes keeping the tank floor clean a bit easier. Substrate is nice for aesthetic, supporting rock work, and keeping biological filtration going strong. Again, look at what fits best with your needs and desires.  You will need filtration. This takes on a lot of forms. Live rock and sand are a form of biological filtration. Sumps are popular- a second tank (or other vessel) that is connected, and holds more water, a refugium (for things like macro algae and some of your clean up crew), and/or the less-pretty hardware (heaters, for instance). Filtration can also be mechanical or chemical- you can get HOB filters, Uv filters, skimmers, canister filters.... there are a lot of options. There are high tech options, low tech options, expensive options, and DIY options. Do some research- I've had a 55 gallon reef tank (softies) with only a HOB filter and some power heads (as well as LR and sand), and it worked well. I've had a high tech 40 breeder, with all the bells and whistles, that was also pretty nice. Skimmers are nice for smaller tanks, because they remove a lot of the biological waste. With nano tanks becoming more popular, there are lots of nano-sized filters out there.  Something to measure the salt water (salinity/specific gravity). There are hydrometers, but those can be less reliable. Particularly the swinging arm type (which is what you mostly see in pet stores). I recommend a refractometer (which uses light instead of density)- they run about $50-$100 online, and are worth every penny.  You will need test kits! The basics (NH4, NO2, NO3, pH, alk), as well as others depending on what corals you keep and your water conditions (calcium, strontium, PO4, magnesium, just to name a few). You can get a test kit, which comes with a variety of the tests you need.   Power heads, heaters, thermometers are also important. Most corals need good flow, and well, thermometers are an obvious necessity. Keep an extra power head handy for mixing salt water. I'm sure you already have siphons and buckets, but make sure to dedicate one siphon and at least one bucket to the salt water tank.   Now, as far as moving a tank: It's better, IMO, to bag everything up (I'm not sure if you were wanting to move a full tank, but that's never worked well in my experience). Bag the animals (leaving air for gas exchange), wrap any live rock in wet newspaper, and throw them in Styrofoam coolers with a few hand warmers to keep them warm (only if you live somewhere cold, though- don't wanna cook the corals). I've used mason jars to move corals, by securing them to the lid, and flipping the jar upside down. A few hours, as long as they have some air for gas exchange, and reasonable temperatures, should be just fine. Remember, plenty of the animals in the hobby were put in tiny bags on some tropical island, and shipped to the US- they can be hardier than you'd think. Please note that you should have an already cycled tank- corals should never be involved until a tank is cycled and stable!   Also, I know this is less common in the fresh water part of the hobby, but quarantine any fish you get. Get a dip treatment for your corals, so they can go straight to the DT, but quarantine your fish. It will make life much easier, I promise you."
ReefTank,3dx65n,SwankyCletus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:42:51 2015 UTC,"Is there an easy way to move a live tank?   Break the live rock down into its original small pieces (this can be hard if they cemented metal rods or something into the rocks) and move it into smaller containers that can be sealed with enough original tank water to cover them and leave some head (air) space.   How long could corals stay alive without complete tank full of water if I were to be driving it home for a while?   Not that long actually. If they're exposed to air, they'll dry out. Zoas might last ~3 hours or so, but most other corals will probably die during transit or shortly after being re-submerged. The good news is that corals will last significantly longer as long as their submerged. Most corals and fish get shipped to their stores, right? They basically do that in bags that are half-water half-air like I described above. Still stressful, but not dead in a day sort of stressful. Same thing with live rock though, if you leave it exposed for too long things start dying. That will kick off a new cycle when you rebuild the tank which would be very bad for most corals, fishes, and inverts.   What would all the most important things to have in it would be? I already have a fairly large freshwater so I'm fairly experienced. Just want to know the more important saltwater accessories I would need.   The largest difference between freshwater and reefkeeping is that water quality matters way more than in matters in freshwater tanks. So you'll need test kits, probably nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, pH, calcium, phosphate, and hardness (KH). Basically, watch those parameters closely and if any of them start to inch out of their acceptable range deal with it immediately by checking online for solutions or visiting a local fish store that has someone knowledgeable. You'll also need some way of measuring salt content, which would be a refractometer or a hydrometer. Most reef tank owners tend towards a refractometer since they're generally more reliable and accurate as long as they're calibrated.   Honestly, I'd probably say that moving a live reef tank with corals is probably an advanced thing to attempt. I've only done it once for a tank a friend bought, and we basically caused a mini cycle that made us build an emergency tank to house all of the occupants while the tank finished cycling again. It was rough."
ReefTank,3dx65n,WoodworkDep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"You can get a 29 gallon Coralife BioCube for under $350 with stand. Its an excellent starter setup and comes with just about everything you'd need. There's 2 versions:  intermediate lighting and advanced ($200-300 more). The intermediate one should be fine for some LPS and soft coral.   Invest in a saltwater refractometer from Amazon for $30, and a few marine & reef test kits.  Aside from that, get about 15lbs of dry rock and a 20lb bag of live sand (don't use it all). Cycle, wait 4 weeks, and go from there.

ReefTank,3dx65n,WanderlustSailor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:48 2015 UTC,"I know that the wisdom around here is ""bigger is better"" but at 15, I know I didn't have the money to keep a 55 gal tank and equip it with the lights, filters, powerheads, etc. that a big tank required. I started with a 12 gal Nano Cube and I didn't find the tank particularly challenging. It will be more work than a fresh water tank, but if you like salt water fish and corals, its totally worth it. The single biggest challenge with a nano tank is that you can't stock it with ALL THE FISH. You have to be much more deliberate about your stocking choices. This may be frustrating, but over stocking your tank will be much more frustrating in the long wrong.  All of the following is my own anecdotal fish keeping advice. This stuff worked for me because I read about it for a long time before I did it. You should do that same thing. Don't just take my word for it, go look it up.  First, find a tank you like. I got an all-in-one, which worked fine for me at the time, but probably isn't the most cost effective way to get started. My JBJ Nano Cube came with a display tank, lights, and about 2 gal for a ""sump"", which was a seperate space in the back of the tank that had three chambers for a heater, powerhead, and whatever filtration you want. These tanks type of tanks are about $200-300, and they work pretty well for a beginner. I opted to swap out my compact floruscent bulbs for LEDs, but the stock lights will work for some soft corals, and I didn't find it very difficult to upgrade my lights if you choose to do that later. I also opted to swap out the stock powerhead for a more powerful one, but the old one didn't suck. Most of my research has indicated that a protein skimmer is unnecessary for a tank this small, but protein skimmers for tanks this small do exist. In a nano tank, you don't really need a proper sump, but I like my tank because I can hide my power head and heater and devote more of my ""display tank"" to fish and rock and coral.  As far as filtration is concerned, most of my research has indicated that bio filtration is the way to go, which means you need some live rock. Both my local fish stores carry some, and I got approximately 8 lbs for my 12 gal tank. In a tank this small, getting 12 lbs of rock would take up a huge portion of the tank, so I opted to go a little bit less than conventional wisdom dictates. My tank came with a bunch of stuff to ""aid filtration"" including bio balls, ceramic rings, carbon, and filter sponges. I took out everything but the filter sponges (which literally filter out large debris), and my tank has been fairly stable with just live rock and the sponges.  Setting up your tank will involve purchasing your tank, lights, powerhead, live rock, sand, and water, plus testing kits for nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia (and salinity and temperature, although if you really want to you can hold off until you put critters in your tank for those two). Your live rock will need to cycle before you add any livestock. This means having a tank full of rocks and water for up to several months that you are testing for nitrates, nitrates, and ammonia (until these numbers are at 0). Assuming that you have a local fish store that has live rock though, your cycle will probably be pretty short and you can add all the livestock that will fit in your tank.  I found that it was more practical for me to buy my water from my local fish store than to make my own. I live in a small apartment and there just isn't room to make and store large quantities of salt water. I keep 5-10 gals of salt water on hand, plus 2-3 gals of distilled water for top offs. I think that for most nano reef keepers, this is probably sufficient.  As I said earlier, the biggest challenge to having a small tank is that you are fairly limited to what you can keep. I found this guide extremely helpful in seeing what combinations of fish I could keep. Please keep in mind that the list is a guide only, and you should definitely research each fish to make sure they'll play nice and be happy in whatever ecosystem you set up. Personally if I could go back, I'd probably get a goby/pistol shrimp combo, but that's me. As it is, I'm delighted to watch my clown fish mess with my cleaner shrimp while my firefish occasionally pokes his head out to watch.  You will also need some kind of clean up crew. There are a variety of snails, shrimps, star fish, and crabs you get to do the job, but keep in mind the very limited space within your tank. I wouldn't get more than 4-5 snails and the same number of crabs if you want them. You don't need tons of organisms to clean up because there isn't that much to clean up.  Coral you can get largely will depend on your lights, so I can't advise you too much with knowing your specific set up. There are lots of very low maintenance soft corals which looks pretty neat. I went for Green Star Polyps, mushrooms, and zoas for my first corals. I later added a chalice coral and a hammer coral. All of them seem to be doing pretty well after 6 months and  haven't required any crazy care.  Salt water tanks require maintenance. I know that people say nano tanks need more maintenance than larger tanks, but I literally can't imagine how that could be true. I feed my fish every 2 days. I do a water change once a week. I test my water right before I change my water. Maybe once every two weeks I'll give the inside of my glass a good scrub. That's about it. I guess its more work than keeping a beta fish, but I just don't see how anything larger could be less work.  I don't have any advice for moving, sorry.  I know its possible for a 15 year old to keep a nano tank. Buy things slowly (so you don't have to drop like $1,000 all at once) and so you properly research any decision you make regarding your tank. You'll need to pay attention to your tank, but its really not as hard as people make it out to be.  TL; DR:  Stuff you need before you get fish:  -tank  -lights  -power head  -testing supplies (nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, thermometer, refractometer/hydrometer)  -live rock  -sand (if you want it)  -water  Stuff you need when you get fish:  -fish  -fish food  -more water (both RO/DI and salt water)  -heater/chiller (if you live in a place that requires these things)  Stuff you need to do:  -buy your supplies  -let your tank cycle  -test to make sure the cycle is complete  -buy fish  -maintain your tank  -enjoy your tank  Have fun man."
ReefTank,3dx65n,faerygirl956,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"One thing to look out for when buying live rock (from either a LFS or online vendor) is that some places sell live rock that isn't particularly live. It will have sat in a cycled tank, and will contain the nitrifying bacteria needed for biological filtration, but it won't have any other buggies or critters (things like copepods, amphipods, macro algae, sponge, coral, brittle stars, spaghetti worms, bristle worms, crabs, sea stars, chitons, the list really does go on). These guys are an important part of your tank's ecosystem, BUT a piece of live rock teaming with life runs the risk of bringing in unwanted guests. If you don't want to run the risk of hitchhikers, consider buying base rock and bottled bacteria to jump start things."

ReefTank,3dwdth,TheRudeReefer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:20:23 2015 UTC,"Try to give him some different food, or soak the pellets. I really do prefer frozen foods. Make sure you aren't letting the uneaten pellets sit on the tank floor- they will rot, your water will foul, it's bad news all around. You can call the pet store you bought him from and ask what they were feeding as well. If a fish has only ever had fresh/frozen food, it takes some time to get used to pellets. If you have sinking pellets, you might want to try ones that don't sink (or don't sink as quickly).  Another option is target feeding him, using a pipette. A few of my fish are trained to eat this way, and it can really help. Cut off the end of a pipette and suck up some food (pellets won't work for this though). Release a little bit right in front of his face, wait for it to all be eaten before feeding out more."

ReefTank,3dv9o3,RobbWo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think the general rule for circulation is ~10x the tank's volume. So, if the AquaClear 50 is running >50 gph, you should be fine."
ReefTank,3dv9o3,ClosedRhombus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:23 2015 UTC,I'm my spec V I have the stock pump which is a 83 GPH I believe and a koralia 240. Looking close to 60x turnover at the most. Granted a lot of this is lost as I have them pointed at each other along with up to the surface for a ton of surface agitation and it causes a lot of random flow that covers every square inch in my tank.
ReefTank,3dv9o3,EstablishedOrder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:47:23 2015 UTC,It depends on the type of coral you might be keeping.  I have a mixed reef and try to keep my circulation to at least 20x-35x turnover. I have seen people go much higher than this but I keep euphyllia coral and this is the perfect flow for them and it gives the tank a nice wavy look. Just make sure you go for random flow and build around the coral you want.
ReefTank,3dsq7w,fullofit,11,Sun Jul 19 02:23:45 2015 UTC,"Couple of dozens of them, all at once, just left their holes, crawled to the top of the tank and started dancing and pooping. Though I suspect they were actually releasing sperm (eggs, spores?). Whatever that was, it looked like dark brown dust. Whole thing lasted maybe 5 minutes. Now they're hiding again as usual."

ReefTank,3dsq7w,bombayterror,2,Sun Jul 19 06:06:33 2015 UTC,"Surely once one releases sperm and/or egg the others all sense it (through hormones?) and time the release together for better survival of planktonic eggs. This is beneficial for the survival in the same way coral releasing eggs all within a short span of the year is. If all released together, more will float on to grow. Predators can only eat so many so fast. Change in temperature can cause release of gametes.   Here is a video of long spine urchin reproduction and the release of gametes is triggered by warmer water.

I used to use it for my top off until I read that. Some people claim that depends on the distillery so be sure to check if your water is free of copper before continuing use, as not all sources of distilled water are. Something like a small copper dose could surely set off invertebrates at all the same time like that. I also noticed after switching from distilled to RO, my struggle with diatoms ended rather abruptly, which I take as proof that my distilled was not as pure as I thought."

ReefTank,3dr8au,Pow500,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:19:53 2015 UTC,I have never heard to trim sharp edges off a skeleton or to use superglue on the current flesh. I can understand that trimming the edges would lower the risk of the coral hurting itself on the skeleton if a strong current is to blame. What does the super glue accomplish though? It makes me feel like it would irritate the coral or even slow the growth considerably. Just curious how it works.
ReefTank,3dr8au,Nitroleviathan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:45 2015 UTC,This is what I've heard from people who have save a bunch of dying corals in much worse condition. The trimming the the skeleton is almost necessary as it allows the flesh to grow over it without getting cut. The superglue helps keep the good flesh from receding anymore
ReefTank,3dr8au,Pow500,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:10:19 2015 UTC,Neat and it makes sense. Not sure how natural it is but if it works I might have to try it one day.

Hailing from Melbourne Australia, it's crossed my mind several times what it would take to keep some of the creatures from Port Phillip Bay in a tank. With all the biodiversity we have around here packed up in the countless reefs, the temptation was certainly there! But running a chiller 24/7 put me off immediately.  Vancouver International Airport has a fantastic aquarium stocked with local flora and fauna. Fantastic sponges and ridiculously sized anemones. That got me thinking again when I was travelling.

ReefTank,3dpbsv,SagitariusAStar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"The NW.    The tank is ~65 gallons with a ~15 gallon cooler for a sump. The background is a 3-panel fiberglass rock mesh.  Live rock is not nearly as efficient in cooler water. So rocks are a purely aesthetics. Because basalt is much heavier than live rock, I didn't want to stack it too high.  Filtration is primarily biological. I run matrix in my sump as well as an XP4 filstar that runs water though my chiller.  I am running a reef octopus skimmer. A good place to look if considering a temperate tank is coldwatermarineaquatics.com"
ReefTank,3drl0b,GarrettRing,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"Ok so, I have the same skimmer. It will work great once you have it adjusted properly and broken in. First thing to do is tighten the valve between the pump and skimmer body. This will reduce flow and slow the collection cup filling up. Second get a air line regulator and ditch the little rink dink one that came with the stock airline tubing. This will allow you to adjust the air mutch more effectively. Third get a piece of sponge filter and put it over the outlet tube and it will pretty much eliminate microbubbles. Last but not least you get what you pay for."
ReefTank,3drl0b,MassSnapz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:19:41 2015 UTC,Skimmer break-in takes a week or two--it'll overflow constantly during this period. Remove your cup during this period and let it drain back into the sump.

ReefTank,3dqsyr,Riglin4096,5,Sat Jul 18 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"the colors are from the Zooanthellae that live inside the corals. They are the algae that help feed the corals through their symbiotic relationship. That's why they have colors. That's also why when a coral dies, it leaves a white skeleton. That's also why if you place a coral in too high of lighting, you can bleach the coral by overloading the Zooanthellae forcing them to lose their colors."
ReefTank,3dqsyr,icedearth15324,2,Sat Jul 18 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"Right, but in the instance of a something like a vase coral, the polyps can completely retract. Leaving behind a red plate.  That red plate is the skeleton.  So why does it have color that fades?   Do Zoo live on that surface?  I don't know."
ReefTank,3dqsyr,Nitroleviathan,2,Sat Jul 18 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"the skeleton is not living, there is no zoo on that, it gets the colors the pigment or something in it"

I had 2 vase corals die sadly though everything else lived.    One turned white, the other is still purple.  Just trying to figure that out because I'm curious at that nerdy level."
ReefTank,3dqsyr,Clevererer,3,Sat Jul 18 16:51:18 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the colored part is flesh/tissue stretched over the skeleton, so that when the organism dies, the flesh disappears leaving the white skeleton (like our bones would remain after the other tissue disappears)"
ReefTank,3dqsyr,secondsbest,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"Certainly agree on animals like acans.  But to my understanding on many SPS the entire polyp retracts.  For example on my cauliflower coral the skeleton is mostly white and the green comes form the polyp when it extends.    My best guess is that when the polyp is actively extruding new skeleton it has a color.  When it ""drys"" it turns white.  So when the coral dies, everything goes white."

Regarding removal, Aiptasia X is absolutely not what most people use to get rid of aiptasia. Lots of people do kalk paste, boiling water or some type of acid injection. Manual removal similar to what I did earlier is usually not considered but there's no reason it shouldn't work. Aiptasia aren't magic - if you remove all of the animal it won't spread.   If you butcher the thing in your tank then sure, you'll probably end up with a few more than you started with, but that's not what I did."

I strongly recommend Aphasia X myself."
ReefTank,3drtyn,initialcondition,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"Dunno what I expected fielding a novel idea on this forum. I'm unsubscribing after this post, this sub truly has zero value for me anymore.   It appears that the only usage of the word spoor in conjunction with aiptasia or anemones in general is you here on reddit. That doesn't appear to be a common nor an appropriate use of that word just based on the dictionary definition.  So they spew out some nematocysts when irritated, big deal. The entire idea is that you are applying strong suction and pulling the anemone and everything it releases into the syringe. Don't try it if you don't think it will work, I don't care, but it did work. Simple, easy, no mess, no prep, 30 seconds. No issues observed. Seems that you and a few others are drawing conclusions about something without having tried it yourselves. Stick with Aiptasia X - I could not care any less, I just wanted to share a method that I found that works just fine. Tons of corals will throw out some nematocysts when irritated, as long as you don't have gobs of them floating around then they're truly not much of an issue."
ReefTank,3drtyn,initialcondition,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, not sure where your hostility is coming from, but to start let's talk about your use of terms. Nematocysts are not even remotely close to being what we are talking about. Yes, they are ALSO getting put into the water, but nematocysts are not going to produce a new animal. The problem I am speaking of is not caused when the animal spews out its acontia. The issue is with propagation through pedal and basal laceration and the creation of propagules.  Now, there aren't many methods for getting rid of aiptasia that i have NOT tried and that INCLUDES sucking them up through a syringe. I have also tried Kalk paste and injecting them with everything from lemon juice to PH buffer to try and kill them. I have tried electrocuting them off with wands. What I am trying to do is give YOU the benefit of MY experience and that experience is that your method is counter productive.    As for your attitude.. wow dude. You need to chill the fuck out. Nothing written in this thread deserves a response like yours, most certainly not mine. Check the attitude.  People are simply trying to help."
ReefTank,3dqbn2,Moofishmoo,2,Sat Jul 18 12:25:03 2015 UTC,Hard to see on that picture as most bad things are pretty small at first. Give it a few weeks and a lot of things will die off and other stuff will grow.
ReefTank,3dqbn2,D_emon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"There's 4 pictures! I tried to circle the interesting thing I saw. One question! Why does it all die off so much? If someone theoretically dosed prime everyday or magically made ammonia/nitrites 0, would things still die off?"
ReefTank,3dqbn2,whaddup_pup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:42 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, just like in any ecosystem, newly introduced organisms will initially rapidly multiply well behind the actual carrying capacity of the ecosystem, consume all of the available food, and then suddenly crash. They will then rebound and eventually reach equilibrium within the ecosystem. You'll probably see a huge spike in your copepod population soon as well for the same reason.   Of course sometimes the ecosystem changes in such a way that it's no longer friendly to the survival of some particular species, but that's just common sense."
ReefTank,3dqbn2,CroneMatildasHouse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:41:36 2015 UTC,Ohhh..... I just thought that ammonia and nitrite killed stuff off and once they're settled the tank will be done... but guess not XP. How often should I water change at this point? My nitrates are growing and the others are reaching 0ish.
ReefTank,3dqbn2,CroneMatildasHouse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"You are still partially right, the amonia, nitrates, and nitrites are waste products of various bacteria and critters in your tank. As the populations boom and bust they release more then less of the chemicals that you are trying to get rid of.  Edit: also, there are different views, but if you are cycling i say you shouldn't change the water at all. Let the system come to equilibrium with itself."
ReefTank,3dqbn2,DarkTheShinyUmbreon,2,Sat Jul 18 23:17:06 2015 UTC,Wouldn't nitrites just keep building up then?
ReefTank,3dqbn2,yeah2311,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"I believe the bacteria that eats the last chemical in the process releases a fourth chemical as waste that is not harmful. I could be mistaken, but I think that's what I read a while ago."
ReefTank,3dqbn2,yeah2311,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:54 2015 UTC,o.O I thought the only way to get rid of nitrates is to do water changes? But since it's not harmful it's easy to do waterchanges whenever it builds up..

Top of picture 3 looks like a feather duster which is good. Right side of picture 3 looks like more macro algaes. Bottom of picture 3 I can't tell what it is.  Picture 4 can't really tell.  Overall I didn't see anything bad that will hurt the tank in any of the pictures. It looks like a lot of macro algaes and maybe some sponges all over the rock work.

ReefTank,3dqbn2,WanderlustSailor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"The macro is just a person preference. I personally am working on making my tank SPS dominant and I think the macro takes away from the corals, but I know plenty of people that keep macros in the display tank. The sponges shouldn't compete really from the corals, they will filter feed the water but your corals should be plenty happy with the sponges there. And over time I bet most of those sponges will come and go."

ReefTank,3dnhsj,WoodworkDep,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"There's probably a trace amount of iodine in it then that the xenia is reacting to.  Coraline algae is going to grow if calcium and alk are not bottomed out. Other trace minerals might matter, but it's probably such a small difference that spending money on a product like this won't really make a difference."

ReefTank,3dnhsj,WoodworkDep,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"I do 2-part calcium/alkalinity on a regular basis.  Usually I depend on my water changes for other trace elements like iodine and magnesium (generally come in the salt mix), but there are some corals and invertebrates out there that might need more careful monitoring of those minerals, or even regular dosing.   Edit: I just talked to another reef guy at work and he says he doses iodine religiously, claiming that it's good for soft coral colors. I have no idea if that's true, but it might be worth a try for me as one of my zoas is less bright than I'd prefer. Hmm."
ReefTank,3dnhsj,ZeKadeo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:12 2015 UTC,People that haven't used it call it snake oil. I used it for 3 months and I had coraline growing like crazy. When I stopped dosing it slowed down 10x
ReefTank,3dnhsj,morallybass,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"If you want to grow coraline you need a healthy tank:  1) Stable Salinity (ATO) 2) Stable Chemistry (Alk/Calc/Mag) 3) Strong Flow  It's actually worse than snake oil (which would do nothing), because it is adding elements all together you don't control and measure (it has mag and alk in it).  If you want to dose those things, measure them and dose them in a controlled amount individually."

ReefTank,3dnl9y,bunny1138,3,Fri Jul 17 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, when something is considering cautionary or opportunistic eaters, it's best to just avoid them.  No matter how closely you watch your habitat, anything that you've been warned about will likely start picking at your corals. It only takes missing one meal or an ounce of boredom before your livestock becomes a smorgasbord.  I've experienced a bicolor angel nipping at one tiny frag over the course of a day, which released all kinds of ammonia into the water ... and started a domino effect which caused a major die-off.  Just stick with peaceful species and you'll have a lot less stress and can see your reef continue to grow."

Anything that could jump out did so, and anything else literally cooked.  The only things that survived was a pulsating xenia (of course), our blue leg crabs, and a barbershop goby.  After losing a lot of coral and a handful of gorgeous specimens, we were pretty upset, but we decided to step away for a few weeks, let the water stabilize and regroup with the things we'd learned in order to make an even more impressive and manageable tank.  We also got a fixed temp thermometer. :D  Sometimes we have to learn tough lessons, but if you truly love being an aquarist, the poise for maintaining a habitat will resurface.  You might just need a little bit of inspiration. Keep checking out this sub and look for things that pique your interest. Take on a new species or think about ways to improve your current habitat.

After everything was up and cycled (which was pretty fast), I went out and got a new fish and coral to get re-excited about everything.

ReefTank,3diuur,toiletbowltrauma,5,Thu Jul 16 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"seems like its very plausible, coralline just uses calcium and alk in the water to grow. it would be tough to scrape off like you mentioned. The actinics would certainly be good enough to grow it."
ReefTank,3diuur,leveldrummer,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Its plausibility is why I brought it to /r/reeftank, you guys don't play around. I think it's pretty neat if it is, I'd love to share it with other cichlid folks. Especially if it's rare it might be good to know some favorable conditions for it to culture."
ReefTank,3diuur,TheRudeReefer,3,Thu Jul 16 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"If so, it really likes dkh 7-12 and calcium 400-450. If you want it to grow like wildfire go grab yourself a salifert kit for dkh and ca. You can use Randy's 2 part DIY formula to bring those levels up. I use baking soda for the bicarbonate and [this](Calcium Chloride Flakes 99% Pure (CaCl2) 10 Lb https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H9UT46K/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_xQ.PvbB4N06RM) for the calcium.

ReefTank,3diuur,leveldrummer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:52:20 2015 UTC,It's important to note that you cannot maintain those parameter values in the absence of other constituents of saltwater.  You may have to slowly play around with the levels you can achieve which are cichlid-friendly and before you start getting abiotic precipitation.
ReefTank,3diuur,NerdCage,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:40 2015 UTC,"Favorable conditions in reef tanks is stable alk and calcium levels, decent enough lighting to grow algae. Im not sure on the SG that it requires.  Air will usually kill it."

Purple Up is one of those things that some experienced reefs look down on for being a shortcut to doing it right.  Some people swear by it. I actually wouldn't recommend it, I have no idea if the ratios change due to your lower salt level.  At the very least, you should still get a test kit so you can monitor the levels and see how your tank reacts."

ReefTank,3dl9kr,mmbraduh,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:35 2015 UTC,"The live rock will kick off the cycle by itself since a lot of things will die when they're relocated to your tank. The cycle may take longer than a month due to the relatively small amount of live rock you're adding, but in my limited experience I haven't seen the cycle accelerated by adding food or another source of nutrients.   You will likely not need to seed your tank with copepods, amphipods, or isopods. They'll show up from the live rock as long as the water parameters are correct and relatively stable. You don't have to feed the pods anything, as they'll feed on various things that will start growing in your tank. My most recent tank is a tiny pico, and it took about 5 week for the tank to start crawling with various pods. I don't have any fish, so I just occasionally swirl them  off the glass after lights out and cackle as the LPS corals eat them (well, the copepods at least, the amphipods are all in holes in the live rock avoiding me).  The most important thing to remember with a reef tank is to keep the water parameters in line with recommended values. It shouldn't be terribly hard in a 65 gallon, but for someone just starting out it will be a good idea to check the water parameters fairly regularly, probably every week or so for the first few months.   I'd also read up on filtration systems in general. Knowing what the various pieces of a filtration system do will help a ton when you're diagnosing problems. It's a good idea to know what things like charcoal, GFO, and biological filtration will do for your system.  There are a LOT of great articles out there about starting tanks and general reef tank information. I recently came across Saltwater Smarts which would have saved me significant money and time if I'd known about it when I set up my first tank. Expect to spend a bunch of time observing your tank and reading about things you're seeing for the first few months in general :)"

Once your parameters are on point, then I would add snails/crabs (clean up crew) let them acclimate to the tank for another week or so before adding ANYTHING else. Check water again, and then add life. Not sure about the amphlipod seeding... I just pick them up from my LFS, and all is good. After that second week of your cleanup crew working, and checking the water, if all is good, add whatever you want. The Lights should be good for your most anything you want to put in the tank, IMO. I would double check with your LFS.   One last thing, I have 2 clown fish, and i regret it everyday. They are assholes. If you REALLY REALLY want one, get one, but if you are just getting one, because Nemo... I'd say pass... There are PLENTY of other, better swimming, nicer, cooler fish.

You could also raise the powerhead close enough to the surface that it creates a small air vortex and aim it down so that it distributes the bubbles everywhere.  Also running a fan over the surface helps airflow and disrupts surface tension

ReefTank,3dguoq,funran,12,Thu Jul 16 04:09:30 2015 UTC,"Unless you are already set up with a separate tank/food/etc to raise the fry, then no you can't save them.   If you want to raise the fry then it's good to try and get a piece of tile in the same area they spawned. That makes it easier to take out when they are close to hatching. You'll also want to make sure that you have a separate tank set up with food ready to go. Usually baby brine shrimp. There are a lot of sources out there on raising clown fish and it can be a lot of fun. And work...   The good news is they'll lay more eggs in about 2 weeks so you'll have plenty of opportunities to try raising them."
ReefTank,3dguoq,Lucked0ut,7,Thu Jul 16 04:15:47 2015 UTC,"As u/luckedout said, you need to place a tile in there, you will need green water, rotifers, baby brine, and a few tanks filled and ready to go to transfer the babies into as they grow larger.  See if you can find a clown breeder in your area and ask them to come check out their setup. Its a complicated process,  but if your into that,  go for it."
ReefTank,3dguoq,leveldrummer,8,Thu Jul 16 13:05:02 2015 UTC,Just keep them away from your barracuda.
ReefTank,3dguoq,zsayin123,3,Thu Jul 16 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"not worth it to raise them unless you reallly want alot of extra work, you need greenwater cultures running (nanno is my preference) rotifers, and baby brine shrimp, using a flower pot or ceramic tile does make life easier but is not required, you can build/buy a larvae collector like this one http://www.advancedaquarist.com/blog/fish-breeders-love-the-vossen-larval-fish-traps  you can also stay up all night attracting them with a flashlight and scooping them out with a cup."
ReefTank,3dguoq,burner421,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:37 2015 UTC,Simple answer is no. You would have to already have a setup and be growing food for the babies. Raising clowns is not expensive or difficult. It's just tedious work and requires attention throughout the day.

ReefTank,3dfm27,RMCPhoto,3,Wed Jul 15 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"To the best if my understanding from scuba and under water photography blue is the light spectrum that travels the deepest in the water, the red spectrum is the first color you begin to use, so a dim blue glow might be what you would see at depth. Second reason aesthetics. Blues makes the pretty colors pop and that's what we like to see. It's honestly probably more aesthetics then anything. I know digital aquatics sells their moon lights in either white, blue, or red. (Edit, scuba not scube)"
ReefTank,3dfm27,Titan-uranus,2,Wed Jul 15 22:33:47 2015 UTC,"Many of the species we keep exist in nature at much greater depths than our tanks. Lower wavelength light (blue) penetrates water much further. Since we don't have ten feet of water sitting on top of our coral, we approximate the light that would penetrate to the correct depth.  Also moon light is reflected sunlight. And the full moon is pretty bright.  Finally you don't need to run them every night. Perhaps put them on a cycle that lasts about a month..."
ReefTank,3dfm27,Blecki,2,Wed Jul 15 22:38:44 2015 UTC,I run a very dim blue led on my tank at night. It does look like moonlight on a clear night. Super bright blue lights not so much. Light gets bluer the deeper you go. I've seen pictures of finger cuts on divers bleeding dark green blood because there is no red at 30 feet.

ReefTank,3dfm27,ConvertsToMetric,2,Thu Jul 16 04:44:59 2015 UTC,"Just to add since we're talking about it, it's interesting how both the sky and water are blue but for very different reasons. For the sky, gas particles scatter blue light. For water, the reds, yellows, greens actually fall into the harmonics of water's vibrational modes and are absorbed. Interestingly if the ocean was made of heavy water (deuterium) it would be clear because the O-H vibrations are more sluggish so its harmonics remain in the IR range."

ReefTank,3ddlyj,WanderlustSailor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"Well, that means you need 8 gallon water per change (I rounded up). I have a 90 GDP SpectraPure MaxCap RO/DI that's rated for 90 GPD, which makes pure water (the water that goes into your tank, as opposed to the rejected water that goes down your sink) around 3 gallons per hour. So in three hours my system would make the amount of water you need.  The system I linked above might be a little slower, but would work fine. I use my system for 20% water changes on a 120 gallon tank, so I let mine run and make pure water overnight, but you wouldn't have to do that.    So, let's do some math! What does it cost you for 8 gallons of water at your LFS?"
ReefTank,3ddlyj,sleepingdeep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:50 2015 UTC,http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=16766  i get three of these jugs for $40 at my LFS.
ReefTank,3ddlyj,Starcryst,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"Let's do this! So you pay $40 for 13.2 gallons, which comes to $3.03/gallon.  A very liberal estimate of what making pure water costs (in terms of water usage, including the rejected water) is 50 cents/gallon. I'd say in reality it's less than half of that, but let's us 50 cents/gallon. That means that, with an RODI, it would cost you $6.60 for the same 13.2 gallons of water. Of course, you need to provide the salt then too. Looking at the 200 gallon box of Instant Ocean on Amazon, the regular price is $60, so that's 30 cents per gallon. That makes your cost, with an RODI, $10.56 to make 13.2 gallons of water.  $40 - 10.56 = $29.44.  So you've saving $29.44 per water change.  Looking at a $150 RODI system, after 5 water changes you will have made back the $150 cost of the RODI system ($150 / $29.44 = 5.09), and begin ""making money"". Of course, don't forget that approximately every 6 months you have to change the carbon and TSS filter in the RODI unit (let's say that's $40), and maybe once per year or two change the DI cartridge (maybe $50-$60). Plus your time to do the work. Still, it is definitely cheaper in the long run to go with a RODI unit, and that's why most of us do it!   Any questions?"
ReefTank,3ddlyj,MassSnapz,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"lmfao i feel like i just took a quick math class xD. and yeah i know its definitely cheaper to run an RO/DI unit instead of just buying water. i'm basically new to the hobby(just started a few months ago) so the idea of mixing my own water was just scary for me at the time... but now i'm ready >:) (i think). I'll take a look into some of the 4 chamber units and watch some videos on how to properly maintain an RO/DI unit before i just go out and buy... im also still living at home, so i have to see if my dad will allow me to hook it up and where he will allow me to hook it up. but i look forward to it! :D"

ReefTank,3ddp87,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:53:48 2015 UTC,The ATO bit worries me some.  Especially with such small water volumes.  I have a decent pressure switch ATO now that has been very solid over the last 3 years - hope it continues to serve me well.  Do you think an optical top-off system is 'necessary' for this sort of setup in order to keep parameters stable?
ReefTank,3ddp87,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"any top off is fine, my point is just to have one. And if you have one, make sure your switch is sensitive enough, and your pump is strong enough, to fill it. As an example, i learned the hard way that an aqualifter + hydor ato controller didn't work on my tank. Too much surface volume for that slow ass pump. The hydor's 3 minute automatic shutoff (safety) would kick in before the aqualifter was done topping off."

This way even if the ato resevoir runs dry - the new top-off water won't be added all in one go."

Depending on the type of coral will vary on the difficulty, for instance if you got zoanthids or mushrooms you would have leeway for your tank to get dirty. Acroporas on the otherhand require a higher and more stable conditions to survive.   To attach coral also depends if its hard coral you literally use superglue. Soft coral are a bit more difficult and there are plenty of articles if you google it.  As for filters, I am sorry to say this but you will want to get what is called a sump with a protien skimmer.   Check out reefbuilders.com Reefcentral.com  And for some great instructional videos youtube BRS TV, they have instructional videos on a ton of topics ranging from novice to expert."
ReefTank,3dfch9,mrhuggypants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:22:46 2015 UTC,"Maintenance actually isn't too bad in my opinion. The initial set up is a pain, but if you take your time and set it up right maintenance isn't too bad.   Again, the initial price is definitely pretty expensive, but after that your main costs will be buying fish and coral you want to add. For things you need to keep buying, you really only need food, salt, tests kits, and additives.  Bigger is better! The bigger it is, the more the initial cost will be but it will pay off in the long run. Big tanks are much more stable and you have much more options for fish. I would go for as big as you can afford and fit. Unless you have a really weak floor, I think you should be fine. As long as you don't have a giant spill or something.   Coral adds a whole new level of complexity. I would just start out with a FOWLR (Fish Only With Live Rock) tank and start adding easy coral once you get the hang of it. Once you add coral, you have to worry about reef safe fish, lighting, hardness, flow, feeding, etc etc. There are some easy corals that basically take care of themselves though. As for attaching them, you can use rock rubble or plugs and just super glue or rubber band them.   For a tank that big, I would definitely look into doing a sump setup. It's a smaller tank that you put in the stand that has all your ugly equipment (heaters, filters, protein skimmers, reactors, etc) and usually live rock. The nice thing is sumps are very customizable and flexible and add more water volume to your system which makes it more stable. Also, the majority of the water quality filtering happens in the live rock and sand. You want about 1-1.5lbs per gallon of water and the more the better. I had about 100lbs of rock and 100lbs of sand for my 55 and that (plus some other things) made it so I would only have to do water changes once every 2 months or so.   As for general advice: BE PATIENT. Take your time to fully cycle, quarantine your fish for a few weeks, etc. Almost all the problems I had with my tank were because I added fish too fast, or was too lazy to wait as long as I  Should have. Sorry for the wall of text. Everyone here will have different opinions about all this, just use what works for you and what you think is the best after more research. Feel free to ask me or anyone else in this sub if you have any questions!  TLDR: Just read the first sentence of each paragraph."

ReefTank,3dfch9,bryanfuel0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"It depends what kind of fish you have. Some will eat pellet and flake food and you could use an auto-feeder. Some fish will also be fine without food for 2-3 days (eels can go over a month) or be fine with picking at the rocks. On the other hand, the really picky fish will only eat live food and need it at least twice a day. So keep that in mind when choosing out your fish."

ReefTank,3dfch9,SwankyCletus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:50 2015 UTC,"In my experience, saltwater tanks are more difficult to manage than freshwater tanks. There isn't one specific reason why, but I've had both for several years, and it seems my salt tank is always my trouble child. My freshwater tank I pretty much leave alone, aside from water changes and feeding. A lot of the difficulties lie in what you want your tank to be. Bigger is always better for beginners, because nano tanks are much more likely to develop water quality issues. You can buy equipment (skimmers, dosers, monitors, etc) to make your life easier, or you can go the lower-tech route.  Saltwater tanks are expensive. A cool salt tank can easily range in the thousands of dollars for initial set up (and I mean EASILY). I have seen tanks that probably cost close to what a small home does, and I have seen tanks that were set up for well under $1,000. I'm not sure what budget your friend has, but this hobby gets expensive quick. Even water changes get expensive, because of the salt. Talk to your landlord/manager about a tank that big. In my experience, they prefer to know if someone has a 100 gallon fish tank, and usually require renters insurance. Coral can be easier to keep than some fish, but most corals require some experience. Start off by getting good lighting, and reading up on different coral needs. Then start out with some of the easier to keep species- mushrooms, zoas, etc.   Edit: Here's the best three pieces of advice I've gotten in this hobby. 1: Be patient. The only things that happen quickly to a tank are bad things. Good things take time. 2: QUARANTINE YOUR LIVESTOCK. I cannot stress this enough. (Inverts in my tank get a pass on qt, but do get a dip and a thorough inspection) I have seen one seemingly healthy fish wipe out an established tank by bringing something in. It's better to let them sit by themselves for a few months than add them to a display tank immediately (see #1). 3: Get involved in the community. Does your area have a local reef chapter? Check it out. If not, become active in forums. People have great advice, unique perspective, and, at least in this hobby, are more than willing to answer questions or help you trouble shoot a problem. Reef2reef is a great one, as well as reefbuilders and reefcentral. Good luck OP! READ. Read so much. Learn as much as you can before you start purchasing lifestock. IME, salt water species are a little less hardy, and mistakes tend to result in an animal's death. The best way to combat this is knowledge and diligence. It sounds like you have a lot more to research, but keep asking questions."
ReefTank,3dfch9,burner421,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"""How much more difficult is a saltwater aquarium going to be to maintain than a freshwater?""  Hard to quantify, they aren't more difficult per se, but much more demanding and less forgiving.  ""How expensive are they to maintain? Initial costs aren't too much of an issue since my friend got a super well paying job and is willing to get me one as a gift.""  This is also hard to quantify, My general budget advice for newbies is take however much you were budgeting for the tank and triple it, and you will be pretty close to how much you are going to spend to get thru initial setup, equipment, livestock and fiddling.  ""I want to get a really big one (at least 55 gallons but I'm leaning towards 75 or 100) but I live on the second floor. How big can I get before it becomes and issue for my floor?""  Depends of the floor, general advice is to place tank perpendicular to the load bearing joist, and as another poster mentioned close to a load bearing wall helps. I currently have a total water volume of about 220 gallon sitting on a 4th floor apartment, but the floor is concrete and its right next to a load bearing wall.  ""I want to keep coral. How hard is this?""  this depends on the coral, the typical beginner corals like palys and mushrooms are almost pests and some are invasive and impossible to kill (xenia)  Others, (finicky SPS) on the other hand can die just because you look at them wrong...  "" How do you attach live coral to live rock?""  superglue generally.  ""Would getting more than one filter make maintaining it less difficult (I'm considering doing this for my freshwater)?""  if you are talking hang on the back i'm gonna stop you right there, 55gal or larger you want to go sump, its going to be very difficult and messy to manage a tank that large with hang on equipment, a sump allows you to get a better protein skimmer, and generally keep all the equipment out of the display. the 'filter' in a saltwater tank is the live rock generally."

It's been distilled or store bought salt water for at least a couple months now. I also have a phosphate sponge in the filter.  I'm concerned about cycling because I'll have to replace the sand AND scrub the rocks."
ReefTank,3dewtp,bryanfuel0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"Just keep your rock moist scrub it with aquarium water and it will still be alive. You can also buy live sand from an LFS if they offer it. That should also help your cycle. I would also test for phosphate if you can. If it registers high, I would swap out the phosphate sponge (they get used up really fast) and switch to RODI water."
ReefTank,3dewtp,TheRudeReefer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, good to hear about the rock - is there much risk of the flatworms returning from the rock if I'm gentle with it?

ReefTank,3dfg73,ifarts22,8,Wed Jul 15 21:15:33 2015 UTC,"Big no no on collecting live rock OP. I want to remind you that rock of any caliber is a scarce resource in FL, and it can take 100s of thousands of years to replenish what's lost. As for live animal collection, that's fine as long as you pay the pittance ($17) for a SW fishing licence. That allows you some very generous live collection quantities of decorative fishes, algae, some softies, and inverts, plus the money goes in part to the preservation of our wonderful local wildlife.   With the finger wagging aside, your little basher may try to eat any inverts, but fish sould be ok. A 10 gallon is on the small side for water stability, and any nitrate explosions, or any big deviation in other parameters are often deadly to inverts.   The nitrates are a big concern because mantis can store kills, find fresh prey, and leave little corpses rotting everywhere. Unless you monitor nitrates near daily, and do frequent water changes, you will inevitably end up with a crash.  I'd stay away from the local brittle stars. They're very sensitive to many parameter changes (small temp and salinity changes can kill them), and they'll clean out your substrate to the point of ultimately starving themselves."
ReefTank,3dfg73,secondsbest,-5,Wed Jul 15 23:48:13 2015 UTC,"I've kept the same basic species for years.  All my brittle stars(but the one I bought to start after the nitrogen cycle 3 years ago(Who is still alive) are all nano.  I do water changes constantly about 2-3 times a week.  And I seem to have had no problems.  Actually, the only problem I did have was coming home from vacation and the a/c broke.  The water was at 82 degrees.  And any deaths by anything are quickly consulted with my hermits, nassarius, and my brittle stars.  Also, to back me up on the nitrates are all the macro algaes that are chaetos, caulerpas and halimedas.  I also used to have mermaid wine glasses, white scroll, and mermaid's fans."
ReefTank,3dfg73,Jhildebrand,5,Thu Jul 16 00:01:54 2015 UTC,"To answer your question regarding the mantis - they aren't that bad. 99% of the time it's the little green guys and they don't do all that much damage and people freak out over nothing. These aren't the 8"" beasts that can wreck a tank and they are entertaining in their own way. That being said if you have shrimp and other easy prey you would value more it would be better to catch it and remove it, preferrably putting it back in the ocean. They are smart and can even be trained to take food off a stick."
ReefTank,3dfg73,Jhildebrand,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"I don't value most native shrimp for my aquarium.  When I sift through seagrass, there are usually the brown grass shrimp, paelemon florida, sargassum shrimp, big claw pistol shrimp, glass shrimp, and brown shrimp.  Brown grass shrimp, and the paelemon species are the only ones that would be nice for a nano tank(like sexy shrimp), pistol shrimp are fun... for a day before they kick up all the sand and bury your corals.  Sargassum shrimp are about a quarter of an inch, and glass shrimp are just like the feeder shrimp at the lfs.  And Brown/white shrimp are considered either bait or food and for some reason always die in the aquarium.  So I usually will let all shrimp go."

He's very chill and hangs in the back behind the rocks. You'll need enough phyto plankton seeded in the water before even considering having one of these. I do regular seedings of live phyto plankton and copeods, and he seems to do pretty well.  He is quite gorgeous with his coloring, but he's killed two of my shrimp during his stay. They are tough to keep and require a lot of work ... Unfortunately, it's my humble opinion that 6gallons wouldn't be large enough of a habitat to keep him happy ... and alive.  Best of luck!"

Even the wrasse who looked healthy, most definitely wouldn't have looked healthy on the insides, even with only 1 spot visible.

Osmotic shock (I dipped my LR into ro/di water) will kill them too, but it needs to be rapid.  Have you done a no-shit three day lights out? Like cover up the entire tank with towels so there is absolutely zero light, not even from ambient. It wasn't a 100% cure, but it will hurt them considerably, making manual removal easier.  Another bad part is that some of what is more effective also hurts the rest of your tank. If it wasn't for my RBTA I'd do a 7 day lights out period."

ReefTank,3da325,initialcondition,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:17 2015 UTC,"How big is the tank? How deep is the actual sandbed? It doesn't look like a full DSB from the photo. You need to have a minimum of 4"" for it to be effective at denitrification, otherwise it is only providing nitrification.  The problem with replacing the sandbed is that you're going to be immediately reducing the capacity of your filtration, and you'll be underfiltered while you're waiting for it to re-establish.  I don't think old tank syndrome exists. I've heard of true DSBs lasting decades."

I've dipped everything for pests, I've ran carbon and the poly pads and done 3 gallon water changes.   But everything just isn't doing as well as it was a year ago. The sand bed has never been disturbed nor cleaned until about four months ago...that's 2 years with no vacuuming.

ReefTank,3d9y5s,Chanyman,2,Wed Jul 15 11:02:35 2015 UTC,"I've had one in my 75g since december 2013, so 19 months now. I ordered it from bluezooaquatics.com who give a nice acclimation kit and instructions. I slowly acclimated it over the course of around 6 hours, and then threw it into my tank.  It's been doing good so far. The whole ""do not expose to air"" is an old wive's tale though. Mine has climbed out of my tank into my overflow box numerous times."
ReefTank,3d9y5s,cancutgunswithmind,2,Tue Jul 14 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thought the Air exposure was a big deal. What about touching them with bare skin? What tips do you have for keeping it alive past the acclimation ? Do you spot feed it? If so what do you use?"
ReefTank,3d9y5s,Chanyman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"Considering these animals can be found in tidal zones where they could potentially be exposed to air, I always thought it was strange that they say that. They aren't sponges where air can get trapped and kill it.   I've touched mine with bare skin and never saw any adverse effects on it. Other than that, I leave it alone. If it goes in my overflow and doesn't get out after a few days I'll pull it out. Otherwise I let it live its life. I don't feed it or do anything special. Although I do feed my tank somewhat heavily so it may live off that."
ReefTank,3d9y5s,skatchawan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:41 2015 UTC,Mine climbed into the wavemaker. Lost 3 of its 5 limbs. Died a day later.
ReefTank,3d9y5s,skatchawan,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:35 2015 UTC,"I kept mine for 18-19 months in my 180G prior to breaking my system down for a move. It is still doing well in a friends tank holding him onto it for me until my new tank is finished cycling.   It would often be wondering around my tank on the liverock or glass. My family would often make the joke that he was 'waving' to us as he stuck one of his legs out of the water pretty often. I fed the tank pretty heavy with all sorts of frozen foods. Cyclops, Artemia, fish eggs, Malawi mix etc etc.  I found that it was pretty indestructible. I had very high nitrates because I hated water changes and had high phosphates. It even survived a cyclone hitting and knocking out the power for a week when I lost a lot of fish and abalone. I love that little fella, can't wait to have him 'waving' in my new tank."
ReefTank,3d9ble,pechuelloeschea,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"You can technically get by without much else for a crab, but a test kit that can do nitrate/nitrite/ammonia would be a good addition. Lights might be desirable as well, although you won't technically need those either unless you want to add corals, and then the price and requirements jump up a good amount.  You'll also want to get that tank cycling as soon as possible. Depending on the crab, it may survive while the tank is cycling, but it would be pretty stressful and a little mean to make him/her sit through that. Starting from dry rock will make the tank cycle take a bit longer most likely, but there are additives that can help there. I have no idea on the cost there though."
ReefTank,3d9ble,WoodworkDep,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:33 2015 UTC,"Don't forget food!  If your just going to have the emerald and nothing else then you'll need to supply him with a good omnivorous diet. Anything with plankton, seaweed, shrimp, squid. Tons of good frozen options out there."

ReefTank,3d6im9,Brianinkonthepaper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:25 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure. I bough it as an assorted frag a couple months ago. I think it's growing fast I always see new tiny heads growing. A coworker said that it would die a month after I bought it so I'm stoked. It's one of my favorite corals

ReefTank,3d9joj,PhantomCavie,2,Tue Jul 14 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"I would shorten the photoperiod to 8 or 10 hours, and raise the peak 5% every couple weeks for a month. Colors are effected by much more then light, so make sure your nutrients are in order, feed heavily and export heavily. I doubt you fried the montipora if your LPS and zoas are accepting the light fine,  it was probably a parameter issue,  do you test your water?"
ReefTank,3d9joj,leveldrummer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"He could have, I fried a monti with my d120 as well. After dialing it down it colored right back up."
ReefTank,3d9joj,TheRudeReefer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:49:16 2015 UTC,Yup I test my water daily. To be sure I had my lfs test as well and all parameters were within normal conditions.
ReefTank,3d9joj,morallybass,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"+1 for a shorter photo period with more brightness for better colors.  I use an 8 hour photo period with very bright light and get nice bright colors.  However, you should set the shorter photoperiod but slowly ramp up the intensity so you don't shock the corals."
ReefTank,3d7y1z,ivegotaplan617,2,Tue Jul 14 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"I know about their feeder tentacles but I was mainly talking about in the center of the picture it looks like one of the heads is ""melting"" toward the rock. Any ideas?"
ReefTank,3d7y1z,GrizFyrFyter1,3,Tue Jul 14 06:07:30 2015 UTC,Looks like a branch broke off.
ReefTank,3d7y1z,Pow500,3,Tue Jul 14 08:19:11 2015 UTC,I second this. Euphyllia ( not that a candy cane is one ) can do something called polyp bailout which looks almost exactly like this but I have never seen part of the skeleton tagging along with the polyp. Maybe something brushed it and damaged it?
ReefTank,3d7y1z,Pow500,2,Tue Jul 14 10:32:15 2015 UTC,That's interesting I had no idea that was possible but I just inspected the candy cane further now that the daylights are on and there is no skeleton attached! Very strange to see something like this happening in my tank fingers crossed everything is alright!
ReefTank,3d7y1z,Fishy-Business,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:38:18 2015 UTC,As far as I know bailout can either be from the coral trying to reproduce or something has angered or stung it. To be honest with how the other heads look I would not be too worried and just keep an eye on it.
ReefTank,3d7y1z,LitoriousBIG,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:11:15 2015 UTC,This happened with my candy cane once when it was sitting. It was like the tissue was so heavy it just decided to fall off instead.
ReefTank,3d7y1z,WDKegge,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:57 2015 UTC,It's trying to feed
ReefTank,3d5tz5,fp4,2,Mon Jul 13 19:28:22 2015 UTC,Looks awesome! But you need to level your tank. It looks like it drops down a lot on the right
ReefTank,3d5tz5,bryson1995,2,Mon Jul 13 22:16:37 2015 UTC,"Seriously /u/fp4, this. Look at the water line in the pic. Drain that tank straight away, shim it, then refill it. You 100% have to do this or your tank will burst. Get it perfectly level on both axes."
ReefTank,3d5tz5,SwineFluPandemic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:37:52 2015 UTC,"Levelling was a success, gained a gallon and a bit of total water volume in the process."
ReefTank,3d5tz5,clitoral_horcrux,2,Thu Jul 16 03:44:42 2015 UTC,It's off by about 1 cm but yeah I will have to go get some shims and level it proper. It is level front-to-back though so I've got that going for me...
ReefTank,3d5tz5,Fishy-Business,2,Tue Jul 14 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"Like your rockscaping, well done!"
ReefTank,3d56r7,nuropath,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:20 2015 UTC,yeah they do
ReefTank,3d56r7,MassSnapz,2,Mon Jul 13 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"It looks great but the common misconception is that it is Sympodium, however, it is actually Metalcyonium.  I had Cathy McFadden identify a specimen that I had a few years ago and that was what she identified it as."
ReefTank,3d56r7,Phenganax,2,Mon Jul 13 21:30:14 2015 UTC,Cathy McFadden   Looks like Harvey Mudd is coming out hard. Here's for those unfamiliar with the name-dropped Cathy McFadden: Harvey Mudd College Department of Biology Chair.
ReefTank,3d56r7,toiletbowltrauma,2,Mon Jul 13 21:46:46 2015 UTC,So is sympodium even a thing? Or does everyone actually have metalcyonium?
ReefTank,3d56r7,Phenganax,2,Mon Jul 13 22:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, Sympodium is also another encrusting octocoral, however, someone probably mislabeled it when they sent it into the trade.  The only other known example of Metalcyoniom known is a deep water asymbiotic octocoral.  I'll try to post a picture of Sympodium later if I get a chance to take one."
ReefTank,3d56r7,Phenganax,2,Mon Jul 13 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"wow, thats awesome. I'd love to see what actual sympodium looks like. Thanks for the info, i really appreciate that."
ReefTank,3d56r7,Phenganax,2,Mon Jul 13 23:17:13 2015 UTC,I finally had a chance to get some pictures.  The first picture is of some experimental colonies and the second is a stock colony.  Both are in two different tanks under different lighting schemes.  http://imgur.com/a/Z1WIf

ReefTank,3d7ug1,RogerWilco357,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:50:36 2015 UTC,Bought a piece of rock with random stuff on it.
ReefTank,3d7ug1,leveldrummer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:54:48 2015 UTC,Those are zoanthids.   Very cool looking ones too.  I would try to separate them and get them to spread without all those other polyps in there.
ReefTank,3d7ug1,Blecki,2,Tue Jul 14 13:11:24 2015 UTC,"Seriously, frag those and start selling them. They're awesome."
ReefTank,3d7ug1,Crispy001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"If fragging, I'd recommend separating them from the clove polyps first as many people don't want those."

ReefTank,3d7c1i,MassSnapz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:29 2015 UTC,Honestly you don't have to feed your coral.  I've seen tanks with huge colonies that do fine without target feeding.
ReefTank,3d7c1i,bleedblue89,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"You don't have to feed at all. Most corals get their food from the light. I target feed to help improve that growth, but it's not required. Also, you shouldn't have to feed each head. I believe they all generally work together/share energy.   This all depends on the exact corals of course."
ReefTank,3d7c1i,sleepingdeep,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:33:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly you will get to the point where getting to some of the heads is impossible. I used to feed every head like you do on my acans and duncan but as it grew and new heads sprouted it just became a pain to try to get to the lower heads. If you are going to feed them ( and its not a sun coral of course ) I would just spray some food over the coral and which ever head gets the food is the winner. Also as stated by many others it is entirely optional to feed your coral, it may help it to grow or it may not. When I started feeding one of my coral its growth exploded but with one of my acans it does not seem to care if I feed it or not and it just grows at a snails pace."
ReefTank,3d7c1i,Pow500,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:45:21 2015 UTC,"ditto on everything else, no need to feed them, sometimes feeding will help growth, but there should be enough leftovers especially if you have any messy eaters for fish for them to grab some floating food particles. Duncans especially are pigs and can eat some pretty huge chunks of meat, but i dont feed mine anymore, they are overgrown enough."
ReefTank,3d7c1i,burner421,0,Tue Jul 14 15:22:58 2015 UTC,I'm probably wrong on this as its my own opinion. So when you are fraging coral and u cat a head off and it heals back and is fine quite quick right? I would assume that each head is almost it's own organism. I would feed every head : ) that's just my logic and I bet I'm wrong
ReefTank,3d6xhz,vulturez,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have had several skimmers Eshopps (which I hate), coralife, but I have to say the sludge this bad boy pull out of my 75g is ridiculous. http://www.amazon.com/SCA-302-Gallon-Protein-Skimmer-Version/dp/B00HLXJ6EU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436837861&sr=8-2&keywords=SCA+protein+skimmer"

ReefTank,3d6v55,swordstool,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:19:41 2015 UTC,"just make sure you have them account for the weight of water when selecting the tubing size. I would go with regular steel, as stainless is a pain an will warp more, and aluminum ends up having to be very large and thick to get the required strength. in either case you want to get it powder coated, even stainless and aluminum will deteriorate in a salt spray environment. as for the top it depends what kind of tank it is, if it has a rim (meaning it only sits on the rim) the rim can go right on the steel provided its very flat and level, anything else i would put a piece of board and some neoprene foam under."

But keep in mind something goes wrong, no warranty. Behind good lights there is always a company behind them. Plus lots of people used them with great results. I spent about 500 $ before I realized I'm not really saving money. Just get a good light from the start"
ReefTank,3d5q48,filekv5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:13:16 2015 UTC,Ya that's where I'm at. I've read too many stories of people double or tripling the total cost of their reefs by try to save money and cutting corners. I'll have at look at the hydra's. However I've already accepted spending about 400-600 for a quality light whether it be buying or building. Also looking at the reefbreeders 32 maybe the w since  it'll cover the tank with it being 32“ long. How high would I need to put the hydra for full coverage.
ReefTank,3d5q48,filekv5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:43:55 2015 UTC,I'm not an expert on hydra but for 36 I'd go maybe 16in above tank
ReefTank,3d5q48,pseud0nym,3,Tue Jul 14 03:04:25 2015 UTC,"Kessil, Kessil, Kessil, nothing but Kessil! Best customer service in the business by a HELL of a long way. Amazing lights as well. You change the spectrum and the PAR stays exactly the same. With other lights in order to change the spectrum, you have to reduce the overall lighting. That is your only choice. With Kessil it stays the same.    But really, the big thing is their customer service. I can't say enough good things about them. I will never buy another brand of lights again as long as they keep that up! Worth every penny and then some."
ReefTank,3d5q48,pseud0nym,2,Mon Jul 13 21:12:46 2015 UTC,"Heard some great things about them also. However I haven't looked into them too much. I do know they do retail for rather high tho. Any model for my set up you'd recommend. I'd probably also have to run multiple lights tho, correct? I'm trying to keep to one fixture if possible. Buy if the value and performance is truly there I will run 2 light's."
ReefTank,3d5q48,nuropath,3,Mon Jul 13 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"Well.. if it is a 3' tank then you will likely need two. A A360We does a 2'x2' square at 36"" of height above the tank. Now you did say you wanted to keep ANY coral and that means A LOT of light. I have 5 lights over my 5' 120G (3 A360WEs and 2 AI VEGAs) and I still have to be careful about coral placement. Getting a PAR meter is a real eye opener when you think you have ""more than enough"" light. Turns out, I have JUST enough.    Anyhow, they are on the pricey side, but that warrenty really is a biggy. With my Vegas I have had to mess with them and install extra gear and buy new parts simply to keep them on. While I have had Kessils fail, they have replaced them every time. This last time I am pretty sure they weren't even under warranty any longer (just came out maybe a month ago) and they are sending me a new light no problems.    With technology, I expect it not to work sometimes.  Especially with bleeding edge stuff like LED lighting and keeping it over a evaporating vat of salt water. When it comes right down to it, you save more having a good warranty than you do getting cheaper lights. That and lights are one of those things that you can take with you from tank to tank when you upgrade. Kessils are perfect for that."
ReefTank,3d5q48,SwineFluPandemic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:15 2015 UTC,"Kessils are awesome, but it's really easy to over power your tank with them. That's the only downside."
ReefTank,3d5q48,euieui,0,Tue Jul 14 00:15:24 2015 UTC,Kessils have junk par readings. Dunno why these guys are so excited about them. Just go with some T5s man. There's a reason most commercial aquaculturing operations still use bulbs.

ReefTank,3d5q48,nuropath,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:00 2015 UTC,that always makes me nervous. especially when they claim high par values and then proceed to bury any actual mentions of the true #'s.

ReefTank,3d5q48,xrystopher,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:31 2015 UTC,i looked at those a few months back and iirc there were some readings in some forums for the value's but nothing on their website. as far as i'm concerned if someone wants to sell me a reef LED than they damn well better include their par values in the specs.

ReefTank,3d5lem,XPostLinker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"Get the system going first. When the tank came down, did you wash the live rock?  Either way, begin by getting a big trash can, a couple of powerheads, and a heater. Put all the rock in said trash can and load it up with saltwater. Fire up the powerheads and heater set to 80F. Let this sit for a month, change all the water, and then let it sit for a couple more weeks.   If you have any sand left over, wash it until the water runs clear, then let it dry.   After a month and a half of purging the rock, begin building the system. Aquascape, add sand, add some biospira, add some fish food, and begin the cycle.   This seems excessive, but a strong reef tank must have a strong foundation. This means squeaky clean rock and sand."

Compared to every other aspect of the hobby this is cheap and much more accurate than a hydrometer,  just make sure you keep it calibrated.

So i'm either assuming it's a different type of bacteria bloom from it being a fairly new tank or the water I got from the LFS was full of excess bacteria.  Either way, once i get home from vacation i plan on doing a water change and hopefully it clears up."
ReefTank,3d4czu,Pow500,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:40:00 2015 UTC,What size carbon? Different size carbon can pull different size particles.  Check out BRS on YouTube for a video about the carbon and different sizes. Honestly it just sounds like a new tank. The first year of a new tank is very rocky.
ReefTank,3d4czu,PriceZombie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:43:03 2015 UTC,yeah I'm thinking its just new tank syndrome lol. But it's annoying to look at :/.   And I'm not entirely sure what size carbon.

ReefTank,3d4czu,Crobb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"I can't necessarily speak to what salt mix is best, I use Instant Ocean and that is all I have used so far, but I will say don't forget to also buy a refractometer if you don't already have one. It will make your life very easy. Don't be tempted to buy a hydrometer."
ReefTank,3d4czu,icedearth15324,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:56:17 2015 UTC,I already own a hydrometer. I have one that sits in the tank suctioned to the glass and one regular one. I was looking into getting a refractometer definitely but I don't want to spend the $50 on it :/. do you have the expensive one you can get at your LFS or did you get the $20 one from amazon?
ReefTank,3d4czu,neURologism_wildfire,2,Mon Jul 13 13:14:28 2015 UTC,"the $20 one will work. Although one piece of advice is to not ever look at a price tag for an extremely important piece of equipment and choose not to just because it is more expensive. You say you have two hydrometers, those probably cost $10-20 each, which means you've already spent $20-40 on two pieces of inaccurate equipment. When if you would have spent $50, you'd be fine.  Anyway, I use Red Sea Salt, and have an RO/DI unit to make my water. It's the best way.   Also, are you running any form of carbon? Try that to help with the cloudiness."
ReefTank,3d4czu,neURologism_wildfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:37:30 2015 UTC,Red Sea is only good if you mix for less than 4 hours. I was using stuff until I noticed directions on side saying to not mix for longer than 4 hours
ReefTank,3d4czu,neURologism_wildfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm running a marineland emperor 250? with the bio wheel out and a carbon filter in it. It's still cloudy. It only happened this weekend so i'm not sure what could be causing it. I plan on doing a water change this weekend when i get home from vacation.   The problem is the tank is in a spot where I can't connect the RO/DI filter to a cold water line. Is there a way to do it without having an RO/DI filter? or is that going to be just as expensive as buying the live water from the store pre-mixed?   I'm looking to try and cut a little bit of my costs since my job doesn't pay me entirely that much and i need to start saving for a house. I agree normally on the ""you get what you pay for"" mentality. Normally price isn't an option when it comes to a piece of equipment. I'd rather spend the extra money on something i know will work. But since this is just something that measures salinity, I don't see why the $50 one is any better than the $20 one. The only difference I can find is that the $50 comes in a hard case (woo hoo -_-) lol."
ReefTank,3d4czu,RobbWo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:36:14 2015 UTC,"http://www.amazon.com/RHS-10ATC-0-10%25-Salinity-Refractometer-Aquarium/dp/B00DKMOR68/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436804256&sr=8-1&keywords=portable+refractometer&pebp=1436804284396&perid=1TR5Q2ZF1HK1P9RX42NH That one will work just fine.  It's possible you have a bacteria/algae outbreak/bloom, which could be causing the cloudiness. Is the tank cycled? How long has it been running?  And about the RO/DI, it doesn't need to be right near the tank. It could be in a laundry room, or under your kitchen sink. Then just hoof the water to the tank. You can buy cheap ones on amazon for like $70. http://www.amazon.com/Aquatic-Life-Reverse-Osmosis-50-Gallon/dp/B00DOG63OY/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1436804389&sr=1-2&keywords=ro+di+system&pebp=1436804395324&perid=13QZ8RCMRC532QXTPZXB  Which not sure about you, but my LFS charges $1.00 per gallon of pre-mixed saltwater. So if you buy that RO unit for $64, and a box of Reef Crystals for $50, you are at a total of $114, which would get you 200 gallons of saltwater, compared to the 114 at the LFS. As well as you know exactly what salt you are using, and you can make it whenever you need it.  Plus no more hoofing buckets to and from the LFS. An RO unit truly is one of the best investments you can make in this hobby."
ReefTank,3d4czu,RobbWo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:22:19 2015 UTC,Yeah the tank is cycled. I have 2 clowns and a melenarus wrasse with snails and hermits. It's still within the first couple of months running though so it's probably just new tank syndrome.  and oh! i thought it had to be attached to the tank... HMM... I might definitely look into grabbing one then. It will save me trips to the fishstore for RO! I'm literally at my LFS every other day. I feel like such a lame-o. They started making jokes about when I show up. Most of workers don't even know my name xD.  When I buy salt water I buy live nutri sea-water. they charge me 3 jugs for $40. One Jug is 4.4 gallons. So mixing salt water will definitely save me a ton of money.
ReefTank,3d4czu,toiletbowltrauma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"I am relatively new to the hobby and also make very little $$$ but I will say that investing in an RO/DI unit is mandatory in my mind. It will save many headaches for years. Mine isn't even hooked up on the same floor as my tank.

ReefTank,3d4czu,RobbWo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:28:30 2015 UTC,I thought it had to be hooked up to the tank this whole time!! My next paycheck is definitely going towards one of those units!
ReefTank,3d4czu,toiletbowltrauma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:10:37 2015 UTC,Good deal. I bought this one. I justified it because it has a valve to make solely RO water as well. Which is basically what Purified water that you buy at the store is. So now I make my own drinking water as well on occasion as our local tap water is horrible.

ReefTank,3d4tf7,krispybrownstank,4,Mon Jul 13 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"First off, looks like it has pretty high TDS, plus the nitrates, chlorides and sulfates aren't something you would want in the tank either.  You also need to take into account the additional contaminants that might get into the water closer to home (heavy metals from piping, etc.).  Even though you're only going for FOWLR, I would still recommend a RO/DI, just for the peace of mind of knowing exactly what's in the water you're pumping into your tank."
ReefTank,3d4tf7,jn062181,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:13:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll be purchasing one soon. I've been doing quite a bit of research and seems like RO/DI, in the long run, ends up being the most beneficial SW purchase you can make."

ReefTank,3d4tf7,burner421,3,Mon Jul 13 15:20:31 2015 UTC,can always buy water at the lfs to get started. even with fish only you dont want to add the extra nutrients and have algae go nuts.

ReefTank,3d4tf7,gitesy,2,Mon Jul 13 17:13:41 2015 UTC,Doesn't your LFS sell RODI and or salt water?  You'll need to invest in some water containers anyway in order to get your own RO/DI unit going.  Make a few trips.  Or you can do like I did on my first tank:  go to target and by 40 1 gallon jugs of distilled water.
ReefTank,3d4tf7,Bananabananasbanana,3,Mon Jul 13 23:03:31 2015 UTC,I use Distilled water on my tank. It is much happier than when I used well water.
ReefTank,3d4tf7,gitesy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:48:17 2015 UTC,I still frequently top off with distilled from the grocery.  It's not perfect but it's really convenient.
ReefTank,3d4tf7,Bananabananasbanana,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, what is better about rodi?"
ReefTank,3d4tf7,gitesy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:14:41 2015 UTC,RODI is supposed to deionize the water (DI) and therefore removes more elements than distillation.  I think the distillation process won't remove a lot of the soluble ions in a solution.  The other issue is; does your $100 RODI unit you hook up to your bathroom sink once a week yield better results than whatever process the grocery store water supplier uses?  I don't honestly know if it makes a difference.
ReefTank,3d4tf7,Bananabananasbanana,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:26:22 2015 UTC,Interesting. I can say the Distilled water made a huge difference with my algae bloom when coming from well water. Or my sand conch did amazing wonders...

Also from Book of Coral Propogation by Anthony Calfo  ""Some success with Goniopora stokesi, the Green Flowerpot coral, stand in stark contrast to G. lobata. Many aquarists will testify to great accomplishments with longevity and propagation of G. stokesi....G. Stokesi is a very diffferent coral on the reef than G. lobata. In the wild, G. stokesi is a free living coral (not attached to the reef), preferring softy sandy substrates and enjoys brighter light and less turbidity than its cousin. If G. lobata is indeed deriving crucial nutrients from its turbid biotope, then the clear water habitats of G. stokesi may translate to easier care in aquaria....For this Goniopora species, moderate current is recommended and strong current should be avoided. It is my opinion that this species must be kept on soft substrates and would benefit from nutrient-rich mud or detritus stirred up occasionally.""  Best of luck OP"

I think it's a tunicate or something."
ReefTank,3d31fk,Kevin_Wolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:56:55 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like the first one is a bristleworm. Very common, they can sting you if they're big enough. I don't bother worrying about them until they're big enough to get without taking the whole tank apart."
ReefTank,3d31fk,ErasmusCrowley,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:50:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is a planaria. They often have triangular or diamond shaped heads along with smooth bodies. I don't think it's a bristleworm either.   The black spot on the head makes me think it looks like a dorvilleidae worm. You can read about them at http://www.reefkeeping.com/issues/2003-05/rs/index.php, they are the last entry in the article.  Though the article suggests that they might be predatory, I often find tiny white ones like that on the glass in my tank grazing on the film of algae."

ReefTank,3cyk62,Chanyman,3,Sun Jul 12 06:44:09 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, I had one in a 180G (Albeit a much larger tank) and introduced plenty of fish after it. It was probably picked on more then anything, when I put a pair of maroons in they drove it out of its nem and it hid in a rock. It didn't bother any of my other fish.

Here's one forum thread that I've had bookmarked for a while. If you scroll down to June 5, one user made a concise list of the pros and cons of both SSBs and DSBs. Bottom line: Do what works for you. The amount you have looks fine, unless you're planning on getting a fish that's a real digger.   Pro-tip for cell phone photos of fast-moving fish etc: Switch the 'mode' setting in your camera app to 'sport' or 'fast-moving', if you have those modes."

ReefTank,3cvtim,onefreaky1,7,Sat Jul 11 04:57:41 2015 UTC,Definitely a bristle worm.  They are OK to have in your tank - they do a great job eating detritus and anything that dies (snails/crabs or even fish).  The only time you really need to remove them is if you start seeing them doing damage or you have a huge population explosion.
ReefTank,3cvtim,Vesper6,3,Sat Jul 11 05:28:47 2015 UTC,"I have had a bristle worm before. It managed to climb into my filter on two or three occasions. I had an 8 gallon and I flushed mine... My local saltwater store said they are more parasitic then helpful and they get rid of them when they find them. However, I had no problems when doing my water tests but I was sick of removing the long fuzzy worm from my filter."

ReefTank,3ckg65,filekv5,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"Hey all! Got a nice green/pink bubble tip anemone (BTA). He's been in the tank for a couple weeks. I sat him where I wanted him to be, and of course, he moved to the complete opposite side. Within 2 days he was all the way in the back corner hanging upside down with hardly any flow or lighting back there. The next morning he was all shriveled up and didn't look good. So I re arranged and flipped the rock to set him up right and with some good flow, hoping he would move again. He opened back up and the next couple of days he just stayed put, looking good! I figured I'll just leave him there and he'll probably move again soon. So about 2 weeks has passed and he's still there, my rock work looks like shit because I had to rearrange it for this bastard. So a couple days ago I took control of the tank and flipped the rock back to where it was (bright with lots of movement to dark and slow flow) so now he's back to hanging upside down in the dark. It's 2 days later and he still hasn't moved. In fact he looks better than ever! ??? Haha any ideas to help him move? He was right in front of the power head for weeks and didn't budge, and I don't want to peel his foot off. I'm glad he's not dead since this is my first anemone, but we are not on the same page here.   Side note: long story but ended up with store credit at LFS, and took home another BTA. Within a week, he's already split and now I have 3! All of which are not in ideal spots. (Ideal for me) I think these bastards are pissed at me!"

But I need to be realistic and pick a size that I can feasibly manage in the space that I have. Hence why I've decided 10-25ish gallon range.   I guess I should have been more clear as I'm not trying to be talked out of the size range into something large, but rather, looking for recommendations on brands/tank ideas in that size range I've picked. :)"

ReefTank,3cdyhv,paladin10025,3,Tue Jul 7 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"Well, fish you just drop food in the water and they grab it. With a Sun Coral you have to feed every polyp. It's a lot more time consuming."
ReefTank,3cdyhv,masterofstuff124,2,Tue Jul 7 13:39:51 2015 UTC,better question. how often must i feed a sun coral? i am already feeding my anemone 2 times a week(silversides) having to pipette some cyclopeeze as often wouldnt be much more work.

ReefTank,3cdyhv,callmesaul8889,3,Tue Jul 7 21:00:08 2015 UTC,"The guy I got it from said he would take it out of his tank and put it in a bucket to feed it. Drop a decent amount of food in the bucket with it and stir it around so that each polyp could snag some food. Easier than spot feeding every polyp with a turkey baster, and it also keeps you from overfeeding your display.   It's definitely more work than your average coral, but so far it's worth it to me for how pretty it is in my tank."
ReefTank,3cdyhv,lasttycoon,3,Tue Jul 7 13:44:56 2015 UTC,This is actually a really good idea.  You might be able to make it a little easier using a tupperware container. Put the tupperware in your tank then the coral in the tupperware.  Pour about 1/3 or 1/5 of the water back into the tank so the tupperware will float then feed there while it's floating in your tank.  When the coral is sufficiently fed quickly pull it out of the tupperware and drop it back into the tank.  Empty the dirty feeding water elsewhere.  This way you disturb the coral only a little more than feeding it in the tank but keep the tank cleaner than feeding it in the tank.
ReefTank,3cdyhv,jalalalaja,2,Tue Jul 7 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"They are non-photosynthetic so they need to be fed on a regular basis, not the easiest, but manageable if diligent."

ReefTank,3cg0mq,LocoLegit,2,Tue Jul 7 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"If they are prePaired you will have better luck with them coexisting. If its possible to acclimate them together in the same container that will help greatly, like if you get them from a LFS and the water in their bags is the same. Otherwise I knew someone that introduced a pair to his tank through a big clear plastic tube, so he could funnel them down onto the sand bed/rock together. I think he used the clear end piece from his sand bed siphon/vacuum."
ReefTank,3cg0mq,TheRaveLord,2,Tue Jul 7 18:35:35 2015 UTC,As another user said they will make a tunnel throughout the entire tank. Wherever they make their main enterance make sure to spot feed the pistol there. Other wise your snails are going to start disappearing.

Anywho... what I did is dig a small hole in my sand in the area I hoped that they would live. Note: I have a small grain sand bottom. I then put as many small chunks of shell, rock, etc... as I could find around the hole for future support. I then let the shrimp go into said hole. He ended up excavating this hole much further. The goby went and lived elsewhere for a few weeks and has just recently located the shrimp and they are paired. Since that time they have started making multiple ""homes"" but typically stay towards the front home I initially started.  Good luck. Post pics. :D"

There are a few hermit crabs, a few astria snails, and a Halloween crab in there. The goby and pistol shrimp are usually within a few inches of each other.  Sometimes one of them will go out of the burrow for a few seconds, but they're generally inseparable.  They did come from an established tank and were already pre-paired, so they wasted no time burrowing together.  They built a burrow with one entrance right in the middle of the tank up against the glass and another entrance in the back right corner up against the glass.  They're easy to observe at either entrance.  I guess I got lucky with that.    The only way to 'control' where they decide to build their burrow is to limit how much rock you use in your tank, and not really give them as many options as to where to dig their burrow.    You can't exactly tell the shrimp where to go and start digging."

Also, some sharks live for days after hatching not needing food directly  due to yoke being super nutrient. Just throw in live brine after a few days to encourage it to ""hunt."" That makes it search, then feed it tiny squid soaked in garlic that you tease by moving it around at the end of some tongs making the shark think its alive.

ReefTank,3cdgol,jimmyscrackncorn,7,Tue Jul 7 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"If I may elaborate on my initial reason for my negativity...  Your current situation is not at all uncommon, and it just boils my blood on two levels - 1) That local fish stores are still selling these and 2) the arrogance and selfishness behind the people that buy them and convince themselves that they'll do it right. And I say the arrogance/selfishness comment and apply that to myself when I tried it 10+ years ago, I was arrogant and incredibly selfish and thought ""I'll do it perfect and do everything I've read"" and SURPRISE, it still didn't eat and died...and there's an extra amount of guilt and shame applied when these beautiful animals die, and there should be.  I appreciate the drive and desire to want to house an animal like this, believe me I do, but when the odds are (likely) 10% survival rate at best, it's irresponsible of the entire reef community (farmers, distributors, LFS, and ultimately the driving force - the reef enthusiasts who buy them and feed the supply/demand) to attempt to convince ourselves these creatures will survive. Has it been done, yes, but that doesn't mean it SHOULD be done. And there's also a reason you rarely see LFS selling the hatched bamboo shark, because they know they won't be able to get it to eat and it's worth more (for them to buy) and easier to keep alive when it's in the egg.   I'm mostly posting this not for you, but in hopes someone else down the road sees this (and your thread, thank you for posting and keeping things honest) backs off from their decision to own a bamboo shark. Cause let's be honest, the only reason people buy them, is #1 because they want to own a shark and #2 because they're beautiful and you get to also say you own a shark."

They are THE best method of ridding your tank of the pest anemone.  Fish and peppermint shrimp are hit or miss - and can't get into the nooks and crannies like these guys can.    The fish & shrimp eat other things and may not want to eat your aiptasia.    These nudibranches are TINY - and pretty delicate - they need to be added to the tank via a small dropper/pipette.   The one thing to keep in mind is - peppermint shrimp (what people usually buy to deal with aiptasia), will eat these guys - so if you've got an outbreak?   It's best to go with these initially."

ReefTank,3cdgud,traitoro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:59:34 2015 UTC,Great stuff! I think it's an incredible interaction to watch in the tank.   I always noticed when my clowns hosted my anenome they would seem to steal the food from out it's mouth and I never noticed them feeding. Can anyone throw some light on how clownfish look after anenomes?
ReefTank,3cdgud,thewordwalker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:16:15 2015 UTC,They're... odd.  I've had clowns that would take the mysis I was feeding them and swim it down and shove it into their anemone's mouth and feed it.  Then I've also had clowns that would rip the mysis that I fed the anemone out of its mouth.
ReefTank,3cdgud,traitoro,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:16:18 2015 UTC,"My routine became, feed fish to distract the clowns, feed cleaning shrimp bit of prawn so it would spend a few minutes picking that instead of reaching through the anenome tentacles to pick food out, then drop a piece of food into the anenome and watch it slowly close up. Sometimes the clowns would see what was going on and rip the prawn out it's mouth and not even eat it!   Having said that the anenome always looked healthier when they started hosting and I would see them peck at the mouth, I didn't know if they were just having a peck or if that was feeding."

ReefTank,3cdjnq,HunkyMunky,2,Wed Jul 8 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"no worries, meaning they get wild collected colonies and chop them up into tiny frags. This means they aren't really spending any effort at aquaculturing etc, they just have holding tanks for new arrivals and frags until they ship out. This is a cheap way to sell corals (vs trying to grow out and sustain mother colonies), but environmentally not as responsible as mariculture/aquaculture. Not that I don't buy wild pieces or frags of wild colonies, its just nice to know the vendors are doing something to help promote aquaculture and reduced collection from wild reefs."

ReefTank,3ccjh1,burner421,2,Mon Jul 6 22:46:44 2015 UTC,"You know, I see this response a lot when it comes to hair algae and I think it is mostly the wrong mindset. I mean, sure if you scrub your tank and then the next day you have a full hair algae bloom then you have a nutrient problem. If you have hair algae that grows slowly you just have an algae problem.  As long as you have light and hair algae cells in the tank hair algae will grow. It might grow slowly, sucking out trace nutrients in the water but it will keep growing until it chokes the tank. So you need to kill it, you need something in the tank that will eat it faster than it can grow, and you need something else to absorb the nutrients and clean the water.  Chaeto and turbo snails."

ReefTank,3cbjae,Maraxusx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by method? I can tell you how he had it configured though.  The white spiral hoses went to the 2  elbows above the sock inside the sump. The other end of them goes directly to the bulkhead on the tank.   They were using a submersible pump inside the other end of the sump. The flexible black hose went from the pump to the Tee then from the Tee to both sides of the tank. Those are your returns. The long pipe with the flexible spout on the end goes to the return bulkheads in your overflow box, the white tube with the hook (overflow kit) gets pressed down into the drain bulkheads.  Edit: just noticed you have Sponges also. It is up to you to use the Sponges or the overflow kits. The overflow kit will reduce the splashing noise, but the sponge is a great prefilter since you only have 1 - 4"" sock there. If you use the Sponges make sure you also clean them regularly."

ReefTank,3cbta9,co_alpine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"in that range if you wanted to save money i would look for used bio cubes/nano cube/IM AIO. you can usually find them super cheap, and something like a led biocube would give you a little more water volume for stability (smaller tanks are actually more maintenance than larger ones IMHO) and a lid, which i think is essential for an office tank from experience."
ReefTank,3cbta9,burner421,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:06:30 2015 UTC,"honestly I would spend more if there was something that was like ""you have to see this"".    I have had the BC before and did not like the lid from all the heat it added.  They also had a nice 30G with kessil LED setup for just under a grand, just not sure i want to do a 30 in there.  why have a lid? not sure if you had issues with others in the area, but I have my one office. I know LED will drop the heat issue and did find a up an running BC converted to rimless with a kessil (older version) that is up and running.  it is about 100 miles so I may go up there if I can get a better price."
ReefTank,3cbta9,burner421,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:37:58 2015 UTC,My office always had really dry air and without a lid i was having a major evap problem that was hard to chase with an ato in a 8 gallon nano.

I have a glass lid on my 24g as well. The stock hinged lids are an eyesore, but rimless NC/BC setups can look really good (for a really great price)!"
ReefTank,3cc3ou,crabs_mcjones,2,Mon Jul 6 19:24:35 2015 UTC,That will be completely up to how your system performs. If algae is getting out of hand you need more. If you can't maintain alk and ca you need more.
ReefTank,3cc3ou,TheRudeReefer,2,Mon Jul 6 19:37:28 2015 UTC,"Calcium and alkalinity does not need to be maintained in FOWLR. Water changes need to be preformed to replace trace elements in a reef tank, and to reduce nutrients. Buy a good test kit for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate (not api IMO). Go slow with adding fish (1 every 2-3 weeks) to make sure the bacteria in the tank keep up with the increased waste. Target parameters of < .1 ammonia/nitrite, <.2 phosphates, < 20 nitrates. If algae is under control and your levels are under that, don't waste time/money on water changes. Now, that being said, being a new tank you will have an outbreak of diatoms, cyno, and various other algae until silica is reduced and ur tank starts maturing."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,Meow_whats_so_funny_,2,Tue Jul 7 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"with that tank i would do a 5gal change (easy to mix up 5 gal bucket at a time) every week. it really depends on feeding, skimmer, etc etc. getting in a weekly habit is a good idea.  with fish only you could drop it down even more since their tolerance to nitrate is much higher than say sps,  but again, weekly maintenance habit is a good thing to start."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,burner421,2,Mon Jul 6 19:45:56 2015 UTC,"Water changes are going to vary by tank.  I do a 20% change bi-weekly.  Its going to depend on how often you feed and how heavily stocked you keep the tank.    Though 10% every week isn't a bad start.  Just test and monitor your water quality to find what works best for you.  I would reassess the Assessor and Royal Gramma.  Generally you only want one Basslet in the tank because they can be aggressive to each other.  Best practice to get them to co-exist is to add at the same time.  However, the tank is only 36 gallons so you might still only want to go with one.  The Anthias might want a larger tank eventually.  I've seen them do alright in smaller tanks, but they were still pretty young.  You want to give them some space to swim.  Not sure what the dimensions are on the tank so others might have better insight on this fish."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,letmechoosesomething,3,Mon Jul 6 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"not to mention anthias need to be fed multiple times per day, feeding habits of things like anthias can roach water quality pretty quick. I would nix a royal gramma, never had one that was not super agressive, if you are looking for other fish that are good in that size tank look at a hectors goby or rainfords goby (if you have sand) and i would look for a blenny, tailspots and midas are my favorite, but there are plenty of other options like ember or starry. a borb would probably do ok in that size tank for anthias, and you can get away with feeding them once a day."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,burner421,2,Mon Jul 6 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"also can do cardinals or firefish, but need a top for firefish because they are jumpers."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,burner421,2,Mon Jul 6 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any problems with my royal gramma, but I do have mine in a 70 gallon so there is plenty of space to carve out territory.  I only had an issue initially because I was stupid and bought two damsels and they both wanted the same rock/cave area.  Eventually they sorted out their problems and stayed on opposite sides of the tank.  However, I had the space for that to happen."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,letmechoosesomething,2,Mon Jul 6 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"i've had issues in a 55 and 40br with one, even when put in last, it ended up taking more than half the tank for its territory and booted other fish out."
ReefTank,3cc3ou,burner421,2,Mon Jul 6 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"So what would be good stock for my tank then? I definitely want 2 clowns and the blood red fire shrimp. I'm really hoping to get a dwarf angel in there as well, but any ideas as to a better more peaceful and colorful stock would be greatly appreciated!"
ReefTank,3cc3ou,letmechoosesomething,2,Mon Jul 6 20:02:51 2015 UTC,I would peruse liveaquaria.com and take a look at some of the fish they have in there to get an idea of what might fit the tank.  You will be fine with the shrimp and clowns for sure.  I think one of the Basselet's will work too.  You just need to make sure you have some hiding spots and holes for them to swim in and out of with your rock work.  Really a lot of the husbandry outside of feeding and water quality comes down to whether there are spots for them to carve out a piece of territory in the rockwork.  Especially for some of the reef fish.   You might also want to look into a Blenny or Goby.  There are quite a few of them that have some amazing colorization.

ReefTank,3cbizp,OctopusBeard,2,Mon Jul 6 16:59:01 2015 UTC,The liverock will provide the ammonia due to die off during transportation. Adding sand and rock at the same time is generally advisable.
ReefTank,3cbizp,HunkyMunky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:18:33 2015 UTC,I would place all your sand and rock into the tank at the same time. This will ensure the cycle is all done at once. If you add rock or sand in intervals then the tank will cycle each time you add something new. It won't be as big of a cycle but you will see spikes nonetheless. To get the cycle started just throw some food into the tank once you have everything in and let it get degraded into ammonia then nitrite then nitrates. If the sand and rock is dead you will need to kickstart the cycle with a bottle of marine bacteria of your choice.
ReefTank,3cbizp,yeah2311,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"No tricks, just patience. Add the sand and rock all at once, add some fish food (on a regular basis)/a piece of raw shrimp (and leave it in there until it vanishes)/pure ammonia, then you don't even need to test - just wait for the diatoms."
ReefTank,3cbizp,paladin10025,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what are diatoms?"
ReefTank,3cbizp,burner421,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"skip adding food, its not really needed, diatoms are a type of algea that feed on silica, usually once that is all consumed they vanish. they look like a brown film on your sand. if you want to speed things up you can go for a bottle of dr tims, I pretty much never cycle anymore, dr tims and go.  if using certain types of rock i will pre cure/cook/acid dip it for phosphate leeching issues, but that's about the extent of it."
ReefTank,3cbizp,burner421,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:22:24 2015 UTC,What does Dr.tims do to the tank? I was under the impression that a cycle is needed to get rid of the ammonia.
ReefTank,3cbizp,paladin10025,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"the cycle is to establish beneficial nitrifying bacteria, with dr tims you jump start this process."

I had to mod it a little to make it work well with my tank, also a Spec V, but I would recommend it. Pods are everywhere in my tank and I never get any nitrate or phosphate readings on my tests.  That's also where I toss in my brine shrimp when I do feedings so my YWG can't over eat too quickly. Also, I took the sponge out of the back of the tank. Now I have Purigen, phosguard, and chemipure elite back there. Definitely overkill but helps a lot in such a small system."

I have near 0 readings on nitrates and I'm very stern on how much food I feed my fish. I had a 50 gallon freshwater tank once before but had to downsize since I moved. I've had bad experiences with cleaning agents or whatever they're called so I'm going to try the all natural method. So far it's been a little over a month and the only issue is brown algae.
ReefTank,3cav1k,HunkyMunky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough to not want to use chemicals. Though, I would say that you're overstocked.  The clown will definitely overgrow the tank. Plus, the water that you used won't prevent a cycle. Even with cured liverock, you generally have to have a cycle still.

You can always take some sand out if you want, My sand bed looks similar to yours, and I don't mind. Your rock setup looks really good!  One thing you might want to consider though, is that rock that is leaning up against the glass on the left side of your tank. From the pic, it looks like people will be able to look down the side of your tank from the left side. And that rock might make it hard to clean the glass for viewing. Just a thought! Awesome tank!"

ReefTank,3c71gs,tanukisuit11,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:51:04 2015 UTC,How much do you change? What is the gph of your pump?
ReefTank,3c71gs,TurtlesAndTrees,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:46:10 2015 UTC,about 45 gph an i do about 50%
ReefTank,3c71gs,JagerFuchs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:18:30 2015 UTC,Thanks dude! I've been trying to make something nice and small like this and seeing success stories gives me renewed hope
ReefTank,3c71gs,octoari,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:28:19 2015 UTC,Do you have a bigger setup or are you making water exclusively for this tank?
ReefTank,3c71gs,HunkyMunky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"Would it be difficult to add a Clownfish, or Wrasse? Just one or two little guys to swim around would look amazing."
ReefTank,3c8uvc,canhamd,3,Mon Jul 6 00:01:27 2015 UTC,Those temps are completely fine. Most of the corals and fish we get live in climates that can have ocean surface temps of as high as 86F in the summer. With temps as high as 83F 30 feet down. My tank stays around 82F in the summer and I have seen no adverse affect on my fish or corals.
ReefTank,3c8uvc,MassSnapz,3,Mon Jul 6 00:49:14 2015 UTC,How about you tell us a little more about the raspberry pi hookup?
ReefTank,3c8uvc,toiletbowltrauma,2,Mon Jul 6 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty cool! 80.15F with is being 90F outside is really good, do you have a chiller? or keep the AC on all day?   I can say that my tank usually stays around 78F   If it gets hot outside like 80F-88F I can keep my temps around 80F-81F with just a fan ( I have an open top tank)   But anything above 88F outside, I have to turn on the AC with a fan, and with all that, my tank never gets above 82F.   I NEED TO BUY A CHILLER!"
ReefTank,3c8uvc,suh_spence,2,Mon Jul 6 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"No chiller! I just kind of close up the house, close all the shades, and maybe run a stand up fan to make sure the air is never stagnate over the tank. No A/C either. Luckily in Michigan its 89 at 2PM and then 60 by 10 PM so at night I get all the windows open and fans going to get it nice and cold."
ReefTank,3c8uvc,suh_spence,2,Mon Jul 6 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"Nice! that's cool!  I live in SoCal, so it stays hot after sundown lol"
ReefTank,3c8uvc,Starcryst,2,Mon Jul 6 01:31:04 2015 UTC,I keep my tank locked in the 78.1 to 78.4 range.  I have a small fan placed to blow across the surface of the tank when the controller registers 78.4 degrees. In the winter the heater keeps it from going below 78. I find that it's really about consistency keeping the swings to as minimal as possible is best.
ReefTank,3c8uvc,I_LOVE_SHARK_WEEK,2,Mon Jul 6 13:56:44 2015 UTC,My Raspberry Pi emails me every few hours with my hourly temperatures.  I haven't seen it get over 80 but mostly sits around ~78-79.

ReefTank,3c8uvc,calabazadelamuerte,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Currently it's pretty basic as I haven't had a ton of time to play with it.  Right now it emails me my house temperature, house humidity, tank temperature and some other sensors I have.  I have some cronjobs doing some stuff but nothing interesting.  Hopefully by the end of the summer I'll have all my scripting done so that it sends an immediate email once my temperature gets out of a certain range.  I also want to add a salinity & PH probe."
ReefTank,3c8uvc,Aqua-Tech,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"My tanks run between 84 and 86 degrees. I turned them up around January as an experiment after doing some reading on less mainstream methods of reefkeeping. Fish, corals, and inverts all doing great. More growth in 6 months than previous years for some of my corals and I had to start giving away halimeda.  If you decide to go higher, do it slowly. Consistency is really important for reef health."

ReefTank,3c9690,Hyemp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:26:03 2015 UTC,55 is not big enough for those fish.
ReefTank,3c9690,TheRudeReefer,-1,Mon Jul 6 05:32:00 2015 UTC,Yeah but if you read all the comments you would know that I am getting a 125 soon
ReefTank,3c9690,Hyemp,3,Mon Jul 6 06:35:53 2015 UTC,"I've read them, and I've heard it before. I hope you do get it and quite soon, but you said hopefully, and that you are new to reef keeping. People always say they're going to upgrade and never do, and meanwhile have a bunch of fish in way too small of a tank. To be honest, it's not even a matter of ""I plan to upgrade"" because you still have too small a tank for those fish right now. If you plan on upgrading then do it and then get the fish that belong, rather than provide shitty living space for however long until you do upgrade. You're new to this hobby and I don't mean to come off as a dick, but these are not guppies and minnows that are a dime a dozen. Do the right thing and rehome these fish or upgrade tomorrow."
ReefTank,3c9690,captainjimmers91,-4,Mon Jul 6 07:00:39 2015 UTC,"Or I'll wait since the fish are doing fine in the tank for now, I have a down payment on the 125. Thanks for the advice though :)"
ReefTank,3c9690,SwineFluPandemic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:08:43 2015 UTC,"As a holding tank you should be fine for now. Start reading up on how to properly switch tanks. Since you have no substrate it should be relatively easy, but still a day long event."
ReefTank,3c9690,captainjimmers91,2,Mon Jul 6 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"Except it's not fine, because OP says, ""the fish are doing fine for now"" which translates to, ""Well its fine now, I don't have the money for the $125, so I'll get to it when I can since I just put a down payment on it."" which I don't know of any place that would take a 'down payment' or do a lay away program for a tank, but who knows. The point is, if OP think its ok for a 55 to house a huma huma, blue tang, butterfly, etc... he is going to house much more in a 125 because ""Oh well they all did fine in my 55, more can do even better in my 125"" OP is doing a shitty job of reef-keeping and should rehome at least 2 of the fish in his 55"
ReefTank,3c9690,TheRudeReefer,0,Mon Jul 6 15:52:21 2015 UTC,Will don thank you for not being a dick about it
ReefTank,3c9690,captainjimmers91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:48:44 2015 UTC,I'm starting to plan out my first reef tank and you have a ton of fish I'm interested in. How well do they get along? I'm a bit worried about putting chromis in with stuff that from what I have seen is listed as semi-aggressive.
ReefTank,3c9690,TheRudeReefer,4,Mon Jul 6 04:05:33 2015 UTC,Don't be a jerk like him and ignore the tank size guidelines.
ReefTank,3c9690,captainjimmers91,2,Mon Jul 6 05:38:26 2015 UTC,I'm planning on going as big as I can possibly fit in my future home.
ReefTank,3c9690,bowlofnailswithutmil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:40:11 2015 UTC,"Planning is vital to success. An early upgrade like OP is doing is a waste of time, waste of money, and an unnecessary stress in fish. It's not even the tank guidelines that's the issue, it's the actual stress on moving an entire system...on both you and your livestock. Transferring from a large tank to a larger tank is a huge pain in the dick.   With that said, if you're going for a big boy tank. First and foremost make sure the ground can hold the weight. Hire a contractor for a $100 if you want to be absolutely sure. Then make a budget. Buy everything upfront so you can take the most advantage of bulk deals. I can't stress the budget part enough. We have all made the mistake of buying things ""as we need them"". I probably could have saved about $600 by buying everything all at once for my 75g."

Pavona  Scrolling Montipora/Montipora capricornis  The one on the rock in picture 4 is a leather coral of some sort; most likely a closed-up toadstool leather
ReefTank,3c9fe6,Dleslie212,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Just set this thing up the day before yesterday.  I've never done a salt tank before,  but a few people here have been answering lots of questions for me.  It's about fifty pounds of lace rock and about ten of live.  We put a few hermit crabs in there just to have something to look at while we wait for everything to (hopefully)  cycle.   Water temp is right about 78, and salinity is at 1.026  Open to any criticisms or questions!   Edit -  all the shells on the bottom are just for decoration,  and to allow the hermits to upsize"
ReefTank,3c9fe6,MassSnapz,3,Mon Jul 6 03:14:43 2015 UTC,Welcome to the reef. Just be patient and let it cycle. The hermits you added might not make it through.
ReefTank,3c9fe6,gwubsmuzix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:31:32 2015 UTC,"You should watch your evaporation if you dont plan on having a sump set up. looks like the waters levels are lower than the tank which just makes it not look as nice.   For the size you have plenty of fish to choose from. So you are okay in that department.   You dont have any wavemakers or powerheads that i can see so i would recommend getting some. What that will do is give you flow throughout your tank for corals, for fish, and as well as avoiding dead spots for bad algae to grow. Jaebos are recommended on reddit and are a good bang for the buck. If money is not an issue get some vortechs.  For lighting it seems that you dont have reef lights but i could be wrong. They look just yellowish white. Pick yourself up some LEDS IMO or metal halides/T5s  if you wanna start growing some coral in the future and have the color of your fish pop more.    Other equipement i would recommend if you dont have already is a protein skimmer and test kits at the bare minimum. The protein skimmer will extract the waste material from your fish and whatnot into a collection cup so it wont be in your water. You will need your test kits to see if the tank is or has cycled as well as to be sure your parameters are in check throughout your tanks lifecycle  Enjoy your tank as it grows!"
ReefTank,3c9fe6,gwubsmuzix,2,Mon Jul 6 17:50:45 2015 UTC,I would also ditch the bubble makers you have at the back of the tank.

ReefTank,3c9267,Weezing87,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:30:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really like big tanks I went from a 29 to a 55 and just didn't like the bigger tank what so ever, and they are more expensive to fill/stock. Also I found that I am more into corals than fish so I don't need aa much room. I actually want to go smaller with a 16 gallon bowl from fantasybowls.com and then down to a 2-5 gallon mason jar. The smaller tanks require a little more husbandry but it's such a small task, 10% water change is 2 pitchers out and two in and when I do the water change I run my little aqua clear 30 with a waterbottle filter and it sucks up any detritus in the water column. You can actually see it in the pic,I was running it after a moved everything over from the old tank."

Also a way to track your inhabitants growth, maybe being able to assign different stock to a tank and individual profile to the individual fish, a way to track the growth over time of a species is both fun and informative. If people use it in the capacity, it may help the community over time to understand the final tank sizing or eventual tank sizing for various species. Something I find hard often times to find online.   Something for the future of the app, maybe basic information on species of coral and fish, both fresh and salt."
ReefTank,3c7mse,ElongatedCow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"Spot on!  I think the ability for more than one tank in this will be necessary.  Seeing as how some have a frag tank, or two or three :)  There will be a livestock tracker.  I'm thinking size, temperament, enemy animals/ things that need attention will be user added data.  While also being able to pair that fish/coral/invert to some kind of DB to have information such as feeding requirements.   And the ability to set up reminders for each inhabitant.   I'm thinking at some point in the future, (If possible) some kind of community input."

ReefTank,3c334q,lostmojo,6,Sat Jul 4 08:06:44 2015 UTC,"I just started getting back into reef keeping.  My hiatus began after my neighbors started a cooking fire and burnt down half of my apartment building one November, resulting in the loss of my tank.  8 years later, a free 36 gal bowfront with a stand came to me as an opportunity and I accepted gladly.    I've noticed many advancements in the hobby even since my short hiatus, much less since the mid to late 90's.  LEDs seem to dominate the market in terms of dynamic and efficient lighting.  KESSIL in particular is the brand I use and seems to be an extremely popular choice in reef tank lighting.  Their customer support/service is impeccable (I know from experience...).  The TUNA BLUE A160W would be perfect for your 27g.  As far as protein skimmers, I know that REEF OCTOPUS is a highly regarded brand and although I do not have one myself, would recommend just based on overwhelming positive reviews.  Idk if they make a nano version.  I currently have an eShopps PSK-100 and the thing is a beast.  A good local fish store is key.  Find a store that definitely specializes in aquarium keeping and even if it's farther than a general pet store, it's worth it.  The employees at a specialized aquarium store have knowledge and personal experience that can go miles with a new or re-introduced hobbyist.  Ask questions and be friendly, don't forget, it's an expensive hobby so I'm pretty sure they appreciate your business and want to steer you in the right direction."

Let me know what you find though because it could be worth it.  Sorry Tacoma stuff was for CaptAnonymous89, my redditfu has failed me on my phone today.  :)  What's the life span on leds and how do they compare to the vho and mh market?

Some purists still go with the halides, but IMO LED is the way to go. The more expensive models like the kessils and radions have really awesome programming available. You can sit there for hours setting your sunrise and sunset just right plus tinker with many many other things.   The cheaper LEDs are well, extremely cheap but still work just fine. Here's my reef with the cheapest available lighting. Search coral led on eBay and you'll see the Mars Aqua unit from China. They have two knobs, one for full spectrum and one for blue so you can have your tank as blue as you want. I like the 10k look."

ReefTank,3c2dkj,H_Moleman,2,Sat Jul 4 03:59:31 2015 UTC,Moving fish seems like a lot of undue stress when a few large water changes and some carbon will effectively remove the toxin very quickly. I would also increase feeding temporarily.

ReefTank,3c2dkj,Crispy001,2,Sat Jul 4 08:17:33 2015 UTC,"2 more 20% water changes will bring you to roughly half the original levels of whatever toxin. One 40% will do the same, do whichever you can manage and let carbon mop up the rest. I would not dose any additional peroxide as it's a fairly aggressive treatment.  Increased feeding for fish is a great start to combat most ailments. I don't think you'll have any problems since your slug was small and you're already taking steps to mitigate the effects, but an unstressed fish with extra food in its belly will be more prepared to handle any illness."

ReefTank,3bzlh3,nuropath,3,Sat Jul 4 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"its a type of sponge. sponges have much less rigid forms than tunicates. they can just kind of grow over stuff and in crevices like that. tunicates have are much more evolved and more complex so they tend to be more the same shape. sponges, for the most part just grow and let water flow through them and collect the nutrients that way, while tunicates do something similar they are able to close and open their syphons and actually have a nervous system and organs."

Essentially, you can kill it by letting it dry out or bleaching it.  The thing is also alive because it is a sponge. They're a very simple form of life, but indeed alive."

Everything opens up  a lot more, the health of the 2 tanks of running them on has improved as well. they are not programmable however dimmable and easy use with a timer on the front. even at the lowest setting the lights are bight enough for most corals and the fans do not run at this setting. i am now running my blue channel at 100% and my white at about 60% and could not be happier with the outcome just on price alone. the rapid LED kit cost more then the two MarsAqua lights did and both me and my corals are much happier.

I sent the Marsaqua back because they didn't have any violets(400nm - 440nm), the galaxy hydro claimed to but didn't, not sure if I got the wrong part but they wouldn't admit to it so... It went back too. Oh also bought a aquaViva COB. There's no blue only channel on it and the disco effect really wasn't any less than the others (it's not super noticeable in the first place...)  I ended up keeping the aquViva AQ and the euphotica. Both had violet LEDS, the aquViva is nice because it has power pass thru outlets (irrelevant if you're only using one) and the euphoticas because they had a few violet LEDs on both channels.  I'd recommend either of them with a slight edge to the euphoticas because the lenses look nicer and their hanging wire is adjustable  They all cover roughly a 24"" by 24"" footprint."

They can also be finnicky as hell to disassemble and reassemble for maintenance. Some people have the touch never have a problem, and some can never get the damn thing together again without getting the red light of doom.  Personally, I like what the pump does and how it does it, but the wiring issue means that its basically not a question of if it fails, but when, so until they are willing to change that, I'm passing on them personally."

However, they are pricey for the build quality and tend to get easily gunked up. Again, best used with a gyre (and a gyre is a fantastic setup) but in a tank with a center overflow where doing a gyre is much harder, I am less convinced of their utility.

Fresh dip if the white stuff doesn't go away or if it looks like it's breathing heavy. But only once and for at least a few minutes. You can add other antimicrobials to the copper treatment as well for full coverage. Just try not to stress it too much, or yourself for that matter. If the qt isn't established so to speak make sure you do water changes, maybe pour in some nitrifying bacteria. Didn't see what else you have set up for filtration and current but if you don't have enough movement to break surface tension add an air stone to maintain oxygen levels or add some macroalgae, maybe even one that tangs like to eat.

They're leftover from the days when we relied on return pumps to provide in-tank circulation and used large return pumps. If you use powerheads for in-tank flow, then you can get away with a much smaller return pump, and then microbubbles won't be an issue in a sump without baffles."
ReefTank,3bwadq,hoologan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"it looks like there might be soem cyano in there. its hard to tell whats happening to the coral without close ups. Look up ""rapid tissue necrosis"".  if your coral get any algae on it you want to lightly brush it off.  as far as the skimmer goes, it kind of depends on how you have it setup. what kind of stuff are you getting in the collection area? is it dark or mostly clearish water? you want it so that the bubbles are flowing up and into collection but its not overly watered down.  if youre getting particles into the tank look at your return pumps. are do they have a prefilter? if so has it been cleaned recently, if not is it in an area where crap can get into it?"
ReefTank,3bwadq,nuropath,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:21:30 2015 UTC,Can you post pictures of the sump? You might need to look at getting a GFO reactor to control the algae

ReefTank,3bsck4,KeepingKidsOnShred,3,Wed Jul 1 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"The egg wasn't hatching on its own, and the yolk sack was almost gone (which means it's time for the shark to come out). In the wild, the egg sacks are naturally weakened by other animals and the environment, but that doesn't happen in captivity as much, so sometimes it needs to be done by hand (just like sometimes chicken eggs need a little help hatching).

ReefTank,3bptb7,lasttycoon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:54:31 2015 UTC,Chaeto makes for a good hiding place for copepods to breed in my experience. Also make sure the fuge is fine mud-like sand to encourage the growth of smaller copepods for the mandarin.
ReefTank,3bptb7,Fishy-Business,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"Not with his size tank. A tank that size can't support a pod population adequate for a mandarin. They eat constantly. The only possible way would be to add live pods regularly, but the cost would be astronomical."
ReefTank,3bptb7,Fishy-Business,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:09:19 2015 UTC,Ahh I just figured with plenty of chaeto and liverock in the fuge it would be enough. I was wrong I guess.
ReefTank,3bptb7,Fishy-Business,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:15:05 2015 UTC,Even with seeding the 17G tank AND 10G fuge?
ReefTank,3bptb7,lasttycoon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, even if you seed. A healthy mandarin will eat pods at a rate of 1-2 per minute. A seeded fuge/tank with chaeto and an above-average amount of live rock still won't cut it. There is another alternative, however. Try contacting your local fish stores to see if they have any Mandarins trained to eat mysis shrimp, and make sure you witness it first-hand (though you'll still have to supplement with pods)."

Random sampling of detritus and coral mucus in my tank show a few ciliates every time.  I've successfully treated a goniopora with BJD. I placed it in my 10 gallon hospital tank, dosing 200 mg of metronidazole a day, fast flow. Did this for a week. Metronidazole was chosen as I could not get my hands on chloramphenicol. See this article.  Best of luck to you and your duncan!"
ReefTank,3bnvjy,Neapolitan,2,Wed Jul 1 01:46:35 2015 UTC,Thank you! I do not believe this is classic BJD. From what I read BJD has a rapid onset and progression. My duncan seems to be doing just fine other than the loss of 4 small heads over the last 2 weeks. Hopefully the tea tree oil treatment will help. If not i'll try some metro.
ReefTank,3bnvjy,Aqua_Puddles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:59:38 2015 UTC,Hopefully a marine biologist on here can give you some insight. I also hope your Duncan makes a full recovery. Keep us posted.
ReefTank,3bnvjy,WienerCleaner,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'm studying environmental biology currently, and the ""brown jelly"" probably has natural predators and/or limitations in the wild. This simply means that real world biologists wont be interested in something that only affects captive corals unless its widespread in captive coral restoration projects. (which are not very common)  Research as simple/or advanced as OP is all we have on many situations like that and it is what inspired me to buy a $400 microscope as well. It is really great to see people trying to figure this out and I plan to help on my days off of work and school. This and other problems hobbyists face are going to have to be solved by hobbyists with the means."

ReefTank,3boy77,sebastion64,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"It kind of looks like planaria, but has only two parts on the end instead of three so it might not be. I've got some in my tank also, and so far they have not been a huge issue. They do not directly prey on coral though they can get to such large populations that they cause indirect issues. If you want them gone try a six-lined wrasse or after removing as many as you can I've heard flatworm-exit will do the trick."
ReefTank,3boy77,toiletbowltrauma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"I have a small number of something similar in my tank, nothing seems affected but all i have are xenia, gsp and ricorea. They're on the glass with the tiny pods. It's a linked system of 8gal nanos so wrasses are out of the question. I don't care if they're not a problem, but I do want to add zoas and duncans to the system someday- will they be a problem then?"
ReefTank,3boy77,Sundown865,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:42:44 2015 UTC,"I have zoas, and duncans, and a lot of other stuff. They can get on the duncans and make them close up. They don't really directly harm the corals, but if they cause them to close up too much, that can lead to issues.  Vacuum up as many as you can, whenever you see them. If they start to hang all over the corals then I would consider flatworm exit. I've heard there can be negative effects of the chemicals, so I plan on using it as a last resort if they ever go crazy."
ReefTank,3boy77,toiletbowltrauma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"Solid plan. I'll do that. I've got the baster at the ready. I used to just blow them off the glass, but the tides have turned."
ReefTank,3boy77,sebastion64,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:11:54 2015 UTC,Believe it or not I've seen them go after the pods on the glass on my tank and their population actually dropped when I introduced a fish that ate a lot of my pods. This along with that they only showed up on the glass and seemed to boom in population following my pods makes me think that they might be predatory on pods besides probably rasping off algae. Also never had a problem with them doing anything to my coral.

ReefTank,3boy77,Fishy-Business,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, looks like a flatworm to me! So you could use a flatworm treatment and kill them preemptively, if you use that stuff with a large flatworm population the die off can cause a spike with your chemistry.  The other option is you can siphon them off when you see them, and watch for them to start to multiply. In all honesty i have some flatworms in my tank and they are no big deal. I suck them up when i can, and they tend to go to mushrooms from time to time, but theyve never been a bother to anything in my tank.  Side note i do have two fairy wrasses which purportedly eat flatworms, never seen them do it, but they may be keeping the population in check for me! (And they are beautiful too)"
ReefTank,3boy77,Fishy-Business,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"I only have a 29 gallon tank. So fairy wrasses are out of the question for me. Maybe a 6line though. I've heard they're dicks though. I want a Pygmy wrasse though, think they'd eat flatworms?"

It may even come down to the individual fish. There are some other suggestions here:  http://www.marinecolorado.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-20907.html  I don't see much saying a pygmy wrasse specifically will eat flatworms. And I have also heard that six-lines can be aggressive, so again it's hit or miss.  Also remember wrasse jump!"

ReefTank,3bn204,Starcryst,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"Seconded, never transfer sand. Theres nothing living there that isn't living in the rocks already, and the life in the rocks will very quickly repopulate the sand. Life finds a way and all that.  Sand tends to accumulate gunk and bound up wastes and other things you don't really want in your system. Any chance to change out your sand for fresh sand is a good thing."
ReefTank,3bnpn7,wallyTHEgecko,3,Tue Jun 30 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you may be making things worse by constantly adding prime to the tank because you're removing the food source of the nitrifying bacteria. I would keep up on the water changes, but instead go out and buy something like Bio-Spira, Dr. Tim's, or similar to supplement your the beneficial bacteria in the tank to try and set things right. After you add that, test your water parameters and otherwise try to go back to your normal water change routine. I personally recommend Dr. Tim's, it's what I used last time I cycled a tank and everything was ready to go in under a week.  Of course, that's presuming you've already done everything to remove possible sources of ammonia. You don't have any dead fish, decaying algae, cleaning the glass with ammonia, or the like do you?"

ReefTank,3bnpn7,ThatWolf,2,Tue Jun 30 18:37:34 2015 UTC,Just make sure to get the version meant for saltwater and to turn off your protein skimmer for a day or so.
ReefTank,3bnpn7,Heroic_Stevorino,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I second this - something is off with the bacteria load if ammonia is remaining that high with such a low livestock count and so many water changes.  3-4ppm with that water change regimen seems super high."
ReefTank,3bnpn7,jbannick22586,2,Tue Jun 30 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds like cyano algae from your description, lack of flow could be the culprit and let detritus build up. Try siphoning the cyano out and everytime you do a water change blow off your rocks with a turkey baster.  3 days lights out will help reduce/diminish it, I wouldn't recommend any artificial products like red slime x or anything. Your salt itself may be causing the cyano, I always had a terrible time with Red Sea coral pro, switched back to reef crystals and poof cyano gone!"

I never get any particularly noticeable buildup, but I'll try bumping it up one setting and see if makes any difference.   The turkey baster is the most heavily used tool. I blow the algae off the surfaces and corals and then use a small net to skim it out.  I've avoided messing with the light too much because of the corals, but I suppose they aren't too happy with me anyway and a couple days won't hurt them any more. I don't think I want to turn them all the way off, but I'll leave one channel on it's lowest setting for a couple days while I let a bottle of Bio-Spira do its thing.  As far as salt goes, I've used reef crystals from day one. It's what my LFS uses so I figured I'd keep it the same."
ReefTank,3bnpn7,HunkyMunky,2,Tue Jun 30 19:34:49 2015 UTC,Ammonia doesn't come from anything in your tank but waste or decay. Are you sure nothing has died in there rotting away behind the scenes? Have you checked your top off and water change water for ammonia? What about someone using cleaning chemicals nearby? Any way copper could have gotten in the tank killing off all of the micro fauna?

Easily scoop up the fish, and pump the water right back in the tank.   10 minutes tops, and corals are out of the water for less than that. I have had to do it once or twice over the years, and its worked like a charm with harder to catch fish.

ReefTank,3bjzev,Chrisbr117,3,Mon Jun 29 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"Tds is dissolved solids. It doesn't detect everything, chloramines for example will make it through an old di while still reading 0 tds.   Gha sounds about right for 7 months, though. No need to freak out just yet. You likely also have a nutrient buildup that the Gha is consuming. Find and stop your source of nitrate and it will eventually clean the tank and then die."

ReefTank,3bjzev,Pow500,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"Nah, hair algae is an issue almost everyone faces. Just keep the nutrients going into the tank low and it will starve off. Try and brush or pluck the hair algae off the rocks while you siphon water out for your next water change. This will help export the nutrients. You can also use a turkey baster or power head to help blow detritus out of the rock work assuming your corals are strongly affixed."
ReefTank,3bjzev,Pow500,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"Had not thought of the turkey baster, seems easier than maneuvering the powerhead around the rocks, great idea!"
ReefTank,3bjzev,Pow500,2,Mon Jun 29 22:33:28 2015 UTC,The first year is the ugly year. One month it looks great and the next you are fending off GHA or some other crazy algae. For GHA you can put a bandaid on it by running GFO. You need  to find the source of the excess nutrients of course for the algae to be brought under control but GFO is what I am using to keep the GHA at bay and my tank pretty while I search for my issue.
ReefTank,3bjzev,leveldrummer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:23:14 2015 UTC,"My one problem is I don't have a sump, I just run a HOB skimmer.  Any way to use GFO without a sump?"
ReefTank,3bjzev,leveldrummer,2,Tue Jun 30 14:20:02 2015 UTC,"I just put mine in a bag and run it through a filtration chamber in the back chamber of my AIO tank. I have put extra amounts of carbon in a tank by pinning the bag to the glass ( I use my magnet cleaner ) where my power head hits and it works pretty well, I don't see any reason besides it being ugly that you could not do this with gfo. You could always do this until the GHA gets under control then stop, if you run GFO aggressively it can destroy GHA in weeks but be careful not to shock your corals because the sudden drop in phosphates could upset them. The only downside to using GFO in a bag vs tumbling it in a reactor ( besides the reactor working better obviously ) is that you need to massage the GFO every few days ( I do mine everyday ) or it will clump together and become useless. Honestly I see people use HOB  filters for chemical filtration like this, might not be a bad idea to get a cheap one just for bags of carbon, GFO, chemipure etc."

ReefTank,3bicnn,FuzzyDice12,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"There not new (been in the tank for 2 years) but they grew out of a single frag so I was surprised to see the variation.

ReefTank,3bjb0w,Sundown865,3,Mon Jun 29 18:12:08 2015 UTC,What kind of filter and filter media are you using now?  I would run filter floss and just change it out weekly - this would likely be your cheapest and most effective option.
ReefTank,3bjb0w,jn062181,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that looks pretty good. Thanks for the suggestion! I use pura total filtration, sponges, in sump protein skimmer, socks and refugium. Then activated carbon and nitrate removal pad infrequently as needed.   Ill pick some of that up and give it a try. I feel like i just need something with slightly smaller filtration size than what i have. Seems like filter floss might do it."
ReefTank,3bjb0w,leveldrummer,2,Mon Jun 29 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Here is a trick to figuring out what you have.  TURN OFF ALL YOUR PUMPS. turn off all flow! let the tank settle down and become still.  if you have micro bubbles,  they will start to rise and collect on the surface. the they hang or start to drift down, then you have sand.   If you have microbubbles, you need to look into your pumps, and return lines.  if its sand, you need a filter sock/carbon/polyfilter to slowly get it out."

As someone who has used all if their of kit I would say their skimmers are the best I've used, hands down by a mile. The RowaPhos reactors are brilliant up to 5L media capacity, the rest are too tall and fragile for the height. The calcium reactor pumps fail after a year and the peristaltic pump fails after a year if not on a timer.   They have the best sump kit I  have come accross, just some of the pumps they use from aquabee can be problematic, the eheim pumps will last forever, but they only use the eheim on the big skimmers."

Google exists for a reason, it's an awesome tool and everyone should use it FIRST. There's nothing quite as exhausting as those, ""help where do I start?!?"" posts because there's literally thousands upon thousands of them all over the internet. There are hundreds of places with excellent information for beginners yet so many people choose to just ignore all of that, throw their hands up and come here where they expect us to spell everything out for them.   Do some reading first - try to solve your own problem or find someone who has had the same problem before you. This is a hobby in which you have to be intelligent enough to do good research and you SHOULDN'T enter into it if you can't.   ""HELP PLS IS THIS AIPTASIA?"" Gee, I don't know, does it look like the other 45,000 photos of aiptasia on the internet? Then yes, it is. Your eyes are better than the shitty cellphone picture you uploaded.  I don't give two shits if that attitude sours people on reefkeeping, if it does then they shouldn't have a reef - in fact, that attitude should be taught to people who want to have a reef. Keeping a tank full of delicate living creatures isn't a task for someone who can't be bothered with doing basic reading or for who doesn't understand the loads of quality information already out there, most of which is readily accessible and not overly complex.  Sometimes it's not such simple stuff being asked, then I think the questions are totally reasonable, but most of the time it's seriously just people who haven't even spent any real time learning about reefkeeping for themselves expecting us to spoon-feed them information so that they have to do as little work as possible. Even though I sometimes answer those questions I find them extremely annoying."
ReefTank,3bfi28,its_the_perfect_name,11,Mon Jun 29 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"This post almost put me off asking for help about a possible mantis shrimp in my tank so, thanks for that. I am new to the hobby and there is only so much god damn googling one can do. It's nice to have other, more experienced people give opinions and tips as you ask for them, not from some thread on some Aquarium forum that could well be 3 or 4 years old.   Though I do get where you are coming from, but yea, some people ask stupid questions sure, but others may not even know where to start when googling something. It is pretty easy to just ask on here where people can answer and help more readily."
ReefTank,3bfi28,WhiteBear2810,-3,Mon Jun 29 02:37:53 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I usually don't express this attitude exactly because of situations like yours. Let me be clear: if you already have a tank, ask EVERY question that you need to ask until you understand what you're doing.  Most people do not keep mantis shrimp - you have a creature that requires a more knowledge and specialized care than most other animals in the hobby. Ask away, don't worry about being judged for your level of knowledge if you've got some issues that could be resolved with your existing tank. Your questions are going to be FAR above the level of questions I'm talking about here.  My gripe is more with people who are thinking about setting up tanks who have done ZERO research about it, yet they come here asking for someone to explain exactly what they need to do, what they need to buy and where they should go to get it.  You're absolutely right that sometimes it's hard to know where to start or what to look up, but sometimes it's just a serious lack of motivation to find their own answers. Researching stuff is a bit of a skill and if you never try because you always lean on redditors or people on other forums then you're going to have a hard time being very successful with this hobby. There are tons of comprehensive guides that address the basics, if you can't find those then you have no business keeping a tank.   It's more the lack of self-sufficiency that bothers me I think. There's so much information, so many interesting aspects of reefkeeping, and so many totally incredible things about the organisms we keep, yet the level of conversation is consistently low caliber. The ""help answer my simple question"" posts definitely bring down the level of conversation.   This sounds pretentious as anything but I'd much prefer if people in this sub spent time talking about coral physiology or other interesting shit instead of spending time helping some dope figure out how to cycle his tank because he can't understand the piles of instructions already out there. It's posts like that I'm talking about here, not yours."

And yea I know what you mean about people who are thinking of setting up a tank and asking before they research. I know I researched my ass off before I did anything with a tank. Probably a couple of weeks of just googling stuff I wasn't sure about.  And I completely agree with the last point, I find doing research on something I'm interested in quite fun for the most part, though a lot of people just have no clue and spam threads with questions a simple google search would yield the answer to."

ReefTank,3bjmzq,leveldrummer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:58:13 2015 UTC,"Is your sump already built? If not,  put the skimmer section on one side,  the return in the middle, and the fuge on the other side.  have both drains dump into the skimmer section, then flow into the return, T off the return with a ball valve and let it run into the fuge, it will overflow the fuge and go right back into the return but that's ok. This is the safest way to avoid any flooding from a clogged drain."
ReefTank,3bjmzq,TheRudeReefer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:14:48 2015 UTC,"It is, I think I will just rotate it and have refuge on other end and the return under the holes to reduce the amount of hose/pipe I'll need to use."
ReefTank,3bjmzq,leveldrummer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:05:13 2015 UTC,Can he use the third as an emergency overflow instead of a return to make a true beananimal setup?
ReefTank,3bjmzq,xdestry,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"Sure could. I've ran a bean animal, its triple safe, honstly I think it's a little over kill with the double syphon backups. One back up should be plenty. If one pipe clogs and you switch to your emergency back up, and THAT clogs, you might as well just add 15 backups."
ReefTank,3bhgwc,eightlegsoffury,3,Mon Jun 29 06:45:23 2015 UTC,"Unrelated to your question, but can we see your mantis tank? :)"
ReefTank,3bhgwc,jrodstrom,2,Mon Jun 29 12:39:40 2015 UTC,"He smashes crab shells, destroys snail shells, and is strong enough to haul live rock across his tank. He's a good sized peacock.   He can not break glass. I'm betting that yours can't, either.  This is the only proof I have ever seen of a mantis breaking glass. It definitely chipped the Corona bottle chunk, but that does not prove that it can crack a glass/acrylic aquarium. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OasH7Jkt8Tk"
ReefTank,3bhgwc,toiletbowltrauma,2,Mon Jun 29 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"I had one, it used to beat on the acrylic for long periods of time. She could not do any damage to the acrylic."

And keep in mind that it's the + pressure of the strike and then the - pressure of the collapsing cavitation bubble together that would be generating enough stress to crack the glass. And keep in mind that glass accumulates stress that can't be easily noticed/visualized.
ReefTank,3bhgwc,GrizFyrFyter1,-2,Mon Jun 29 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"I've cleaned up the mess from two broken tanks from mantis. Thinking it isn't possible just because you haven't seen it is a very self centered way to live your life.   First: they hit the hardest when breaking rock to shape their tunnel. That's why the bottom pane of glass is what is broken most often.   Second: Peacock mantis don't have the strongest punch, even though they are one of the biggest."
ReefTank,3bhgwc,greencoinman,5,Mon Jun 29 09:43:03 2015 UTC,Thinking something is possible just because you've heard it a whole bunch is a terrible way to live your life.  Doubly so when it comes to reef keeping.  This hobby needs more evidence and less anecdote.  OP is the real MVP.
ReefTank,3bhgwc,ExdigguserPies,3,Mon Jun 29 12:39:35 2015 UTC,Unless a tank is constantly under CCTV then the only evidence we'll ever get here is anecdotal. /u/GrizFyrFyter1 said he's cleaned up two broken tanks that contained mantis shrimp - that sounds pretty compelling to me.
ReefTank,3bhgwc,greencoinman,3,Mon Jun 29 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"That isn't compelling at all.  Just because something is hard to prove doesn't mean that we shouldn't look for actual evidence of things.  You can probably find plenty of people who say they've kept tangs in 10 gallon aquariums for years without issue, but doesn't mean you should believe them."
ReefTank,3bhgwc,KelMage,4,Mon Jun 29 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"Niche hobby with limited resources. The evidence you're going to find is basically always going to be anecdotal. While anecdotal is always the lowest form of evidence a trend of anecdotal evidence can at least provide a correlate for a potential truth.   Healthy skepticism is always good, but in the absence of the best evidence sometimes good will have to do. Unless you would like to ruin some trials and provide better evidence."
ReefTank,3bhgwc,ExdigguserPies,3,Mon Jun 29 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"What evidence would you expect to get? OP is asking for evidence, we can only give what we've got."
ReefTank,3bhgwc,greencoinman,-2,Mon Jun 29 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"Like, evidence.  OP asked for actual evidence. If someone doesn't have any, then they should offer anything.  Since he is asking for proof he has probably heard the same anecdotes already.  More I am addressing the fact that people were all butt hurt that OP wasn't interested in anecdotes than anything else.  We should all be striving for evidence, not getting mad that our own personal stories aren't real proof of anything."
ReefTank,3bhgwc,GrizFyrFyter1,2,Mon Jun 29 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"We should all have a healthy scepticism of info in this hobby, there is a lot of bad info out there but this isn't one of them."

ReefTank,3bguss,WhiteBear2810,2,Mon Jun 29 02:45:06 2015 UTC,I had a red eyed devil crab that found its way into my tank that dug out some caves in my live rock. He also ate almost all my green star polyps and three sets of zoas before i caught him. The best bet is to check the tank in the middle of the night and see if you can catch a glimpse of what it is. My guess is its some type of crab that was in the rock when you got it.
ReefTank,3bguss,yeah2311,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"Could be a manits or pistol, maybe the flow is to strong ....or who knows what else.

ReefTank,3bguss,Pow500,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:58:36 2015 UTC,"When you go to look for one in the middle of the night see if you can pick up a fairly clear piece of red plastic ( I am having a case of the Mondays and can't think of what its called) and put it over the flashlight lens. Most inverts ( crabs that is, no idea on a mantis shrimp  ) cannot see the red spectrum and I have seen this recommended numerous times to try and catch or see possible hitchhikers, under the red light they have no idea they are being watched. I am sure if you look around a bit you can find what I am talking about, I have never had a reason to do it thankfully. Good luck!"

ReefTank,3bgzuk,Newcastle161,2,Mon Jun 29 03:35:12 2015 UTC,pics or description of the algae please. depending on the algae type cutting lights may or may not help. you'll probably have to do a series of water changes to clear out the excess nutrients.

ReefTank,3bgzuk,FuzzyDice12,2,Mon Jun 29 04:44:22 2015 UTC,"Best thing you can do, pick up a handful of the reef safe hermits and 1 or 2 snails. It sounds like you are dealing with diatom type hair algae.   If you are still putting food into the tank to help cycle you might want to slow down or stop at this point. you don't want to build up too many excess phosphates and usually diatom type algae shows up near the end of a cycle."
ReefTank,3bgzuk,greencoinman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:11:00 2015 UTC,Got it. Will my hermits die though? The tank isnt fully cycled
ReefTank,3bgzuk,FuzzyDice12,2,Mon Jun 29 06:13:52 2015 UTC,"You will not want to add any inverts until it's cycled.  They will die a lot faster than a fish would.  Algae blooms are normal for cycling, so don't worry about it yet :)"
ReefTank,3bgzuk,FuzzyDice12,2,Mon Jun 29 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm not trying to get into an argument with anyone here but the diatom bloom as I said earlier is normally the last stage, or end of the cycle. The diatoms eat up the excess nitrates and phosphates which is why they are there in the first place. Nitrate cannot exist without ammonia eating and nitrite eating bacteria. I've done this several times with no issues."
ReefTank,3bgzuk,yeah2311,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"Though I do agree on algae firming at the end of the cycle, I still feel that my cycle that has been going on for two weeks now isn't close to being over.  I thought maybe another week or two I would start seeing these things but hey, I still don't know what my levels are, so I have little ground to speak on. I'm keeping your ideas on the table."
ReefTank,3bgzuk,MacroAlgalFagasaurus,2,Mon Jun 29 17:55:27 2015 UTC,How did your last tests read? Ammonia Nitrite and Nitrate? Normally diatom algae is present at the end of the cycle because they eat the nitrate and phosphate.
ReefTank,3bgzuk,leveldrummer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:38:01 2015 UTC,Well I haven't been able to test yet. I have Red Sea's test kit but for some reason I have no instructions. I'm going to have to find information online. I'm going to purchase a Nutrafin test kit with all of the tests from Calcium to Nitrate. Until then though I'm in the dark.
ReefTank,3bgozj,Kidnpmyheart,3,Mon Jun 29 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"The ""algae"" you're seeing is actually cyanobacteria and the bubbles are a byproduct of their photosynthesis, this is why it keeps appearing even after you brush it away. It's a VERY common thing to encounter in cycling tanks, and unfortunately can become a huge nuisance. As MassSnapz said, increased water flow can help to reduce it, but if you're still cycling the ammonia/nitrites/nitrates spiking will be fueling it. Once you complete your cycle and get the nutrients under control it should start to disappear. Definitely increase flow though in the meantime! :)  Edit: Oh, also, since it's photosynthetic turning the lights off will also kill it, though if you still have high nutrient levels it will grow back in time."
ReefTank,3bgozj,ag09g,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:26:15 2015 UTC,My levels were fine when I tested them last week. I haven't gotten a chance to test yet today but I just added two fish this weekend so I'm sure the levels are going to be out of whack a tad.   How should I increase flow? Should I point my hydor at the rock? I have a marine land emperor 280 and a hydor 600 currently running on this tank which is a 29 gallon. Do I need to buy another pump?
ReefTank,3bgozj,ag09g,2,Mon Jun 29 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"I would start off by pointing the pump at the affected areas and see if that helps before buying another one. If that doesn't help, but your nutrient levels are low, I'd recommend doing a three day black out period on the tank. It will kill off the majority of the cyano and as long as you keep your water in check it shouldn't come back too quickly :)"
ReefTank,3bgozj,ag09g,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:14:45 2015 UTC,"awesome thanks! I'll try pointing the pump on the rocks tonight. hopefully that helps a tad.   Also, are there any snails or crabs that eat it? (I'm at work so I can't really spend much time researching) If there are I might go pick up a few just to help it disappear and stay away.   Also, I have a diamond goby that is surfing around on my sand. He's not going to be harmed right?"
ReefTank,3bgozj,DarkSkyForever,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any snails or crabs that will reliably eat it unfortunately.   As for your fish though he'll be fine, as well as any corals you may have!"
ReefTank,3bgozj,TheRudeReefer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:34:34 2015 UTC,Your levels appear fine because the algae is eating the excess nutrients.
ReefTank,3bgozj,MassSnapz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:45:56 2015 UTC,yeah. I turned down my light cycle. hopefully that gets rid of the excess algae.
ReefTank,3bgozj,MassSnapz,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"Give it a month or two. Expect to see algae blooms in the first year of a tanks life. First the simple stuff like cyano and diatoms. Then later the more complex algae like hair and bubble. I wouldn't worry about it. If it bothers you that much, try removing it manually. It won't harm anything so long as it isn't absolutely smothering your coral. Spots here and there are perfectly normal and safe."

Aiptasia looks something like zoa or paly but with longer thingys and it's brown.   You should always check zoa rocks (and actually every live rock) for pests, once the pest is in for a while, it will be hard to remove.   For aiptasia removing (if you have very few and on a rock, not next to a coral) , i recommend Aquamend and burry the sucker. :)"

It's a touch loud and the spray injector does clog with precipitate from time to time, but it's an easy fix with the brush that comes included. Seems to do a very nice job pulling organics out of the water. My biggest beef is that the pump goes in the tank and is unsightly. I believe the RO has an external pump which I would prefer. The sold separately overflow box is great, but also very large. I made the decision to pull it rather than give up that much space."

ReefTank,3bf04f,aiydee,2,Mon Jun 29 09:19:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty good idea with OP.  However,  I also highly suggest the 4x5Gallon refills READY.  Not for 100% change, but for emergencies.  It's better to be over-prepared and tip some down the drain, then to need it because of unexpected ammonia spike and have to wait for things to get ready. HOWEVER, here is also your 'emergency plan'  (Which I've had to use!) Get to site and make 2 x 5 gallons.  Get to temperature.  Airstone/small pumps.  Put to side.  These are your emergency tanks!  Don't use these guys water.  Instead, get the tank setup.  Get it going.  If you have an ammonia spike or any fish/shrimp looks sick/distressed, you have prepped a hospital tank.  2 of them just in case you need to put all livestock out (eg.  Ammonia spike).  Then spend your effort on maintaining the 'hospital buckets'.  Let the ammonia spike ride out, then transfer back. Have this idea as the fallback, things are going to hell-in-a-handbasket.  If you don't need it, you have waterchange water.  If you need it, you're prepared."

ReefTank,3bewlq,ClosedRhombus,3,Sun Jun 28 19:15:07 2015 UTC,You have trouble with this? That's so interesting- what is a pest in one tank and not in another.

Growth is similar to Green Star Polyps in that it grows rather quickly and forms a thin mat which the polyps extend from.   This is the original frag that I bought in October 2014. It's about 8 months old now.

ReefTank,3bdddf,quackenbush,5,Sun Jun 28 03:53:27 2015 UTC,I had an internship which required me to leave my tank from May-August. I've got an Apex and a Neptune Auto Feeder which works great. I also have two BRS dosing pumps for calcium and alkalinity. It's been about 2 months now and everything has worked great. I go back every 3 weeks to do a water change and have a friend of mine clean the glass once a week. I also have a webcam setup for peace of mind.
ReefTank,3bdddf,jrodstrom,3,Sun Jun 28 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"For a weekend I don't do anything except feed heavy the day before.   For a week, I use an automatic feeder. Dial it in a few days before you leave so you don't under/overfeed. Side note: fish can live for quite a while without being fed (week or longer). There are stories of fish hopping the overflow and living in there off scraps for months! So having said this it's probably better to slightly underfeed then to overfeed while on vacation imo.  If we have a house sitter and I will give them basic information on the tank such as emergency procedures but wont rely on them to feed the tank or do anything beside make sure it's basic equipment is running. Also make sure your auto top off container can hold enough water for the length of time you are gone and a few days extra (shit happens). For me this changes depending on what time of year it is. I tend to evaporate more during the winter.   Lastly, While it may be temping to tinker with your equipment before you leave, I think this opens up room for errors (forgetting to close a valve, forgetting to plug something back in ect.). If it's been running for months it should be fine for a week without messing with stuff."
ReefTank,3bdddf,DJwalrus,2,Sun Jun 28 04:15:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best advice here, based off of my own personal experiences.   I just a have little 20g nano tank, and had someone come over as a house sitter. They were living IN my house for a week and still couldn't be bothered to splash some water in my tank once a day, and not overfeed my fish. I'm still pretty pissed at this person because of this.  If I were to do it again, I would buy a top notch ATO and let the fish go hungry. It's better than the massive die off and algae explosion that i'm still trying to fix. The less someone else has to do with your tank while you're not there, the better."
ReefTank,3bdddf,CptSweetCheeksjr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:14:21 2015 UTC,i keep the daily pill boxes and put the correct amount of food i want fed in them. I then hide the food container so whoever is feeding cannot add more.  so for so good. I also agree that underfeeding is way better than overfeeding.
ReefTank,3bdddf,sleepingdeep,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"My sister is my designated stand-in fish mommy. She knows which animals get hand/target fed, and which ones don't need it. I have a big list of possible things that could go wrong, and what steps need to be taken immediately to prevent the problem from getting worse, and then have her call me so we can trouble shoot and I can walk her through how to fix it. (example: a pump is making a grinding noise? Unplug the pump and call me) She also sees my tank enough that she can spot when something is seriously wrong with an animal.  I do dole out food, using a weekly pill container. I keep one in the freezer for frozen foods, and one on the counter for pellets. That way there is no concern that my tank is over-fed while I'm away. She knows to pay special attention during feeding times, because it can be the best time to notice health problems.   I do a water change the day before I leave, and again when I get home (depending on how long I'm gone). I don't have many friends in the hobby that are close, so I've never trusted anyone to do a change for me. I do mix salt water and leave a heater and power head in the bucket in case there is an emergency.  While my sister doesn't know everything about my tank, she knows more than most people. I've had other people, who aren't as familiar, watch my tank, and I have regretted it every time. Tanks can be complicated, and it's not something most people can learn after a few hours of explaining things."

ReefTank,3bdddf,HadManySons,2,Sun Jun 28 08:09:18 2015 UTC,Yup if I leave town I have a pump in my sump that goes from sump closer to drain. There is another pump that goes goes from heated mixed salt water drum to sump. When I hit the command it drains water until it reaches a float valve. Then it fills it to another float valve. This way I do water changes at tap of a button from anywhere. Also when this prices starts it turns off return pump and skimmer until it's full again. I have 3 web cams hooked up to watch if I want.

I HIGHLY recommend marine bio poly filters:  http://www.amazon.com/Poly-Filter-3-pack/dp/B00HYN8602/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1435459282&sr=8-2&keywords=marine+bio+poly+filter  I always keep a few on hand in case of emergency.  They are a poly filter coated in a resin that is designed to attach to chemicals.  It will remove copper, and other heavy metals.  They stuff truly seems magical to me, it describes what it's removing based off what color it ends up turning.  As for the water changes, when I have had that situation where the skimmer is just overflowing on even the lowest level, I use the output of the skimmer to pull the water out of the tank.  I think it helps."

ReefTank,3bcy7x,becic,2,Sun Jun 28 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"I don't run them as a normal thing any more (they pull a lot of crap out).  So I normally just have them on hand in case something happens I need to remove.  They are kind of dense with the resin, so they can't push tons of water through them.  So I normally just put them in a high flow area, but not in a way that all water has to pass through them.  If you have a sump with bubble trap dividers, putting half a pad between the pieces of glass in the divider will work fine."

Mine is 2/3 the way up in my tank at about 400 PAR. And they love medium-high to high flow. They also require spot feeding (or medium to heavy tank feeding) in order to be kept long term. I keep mine close to my sun coral so I can feed them both with the frozen bits that fall from feeding my fish.
ReefTank,3baxxr,Baconsniper,2,Sun Jun 28 08:24:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely will spot feed him daily. Moved him up a bit so he's about 1/2 way up the tank to a bit more light and more flow, and you were right. First day, not much. Second, a little opening. Third day a bit more. Fourth he is completely open and looks incredible!"
ReefTank,3baxxr,Baconsniper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:26:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Good to hear :D I don't think daily feedings are necessary. Every other day would probably be good, the polyps feed the entire colony, so you don't have to feed each head like a sun coral."
ReefTank,3bb6p9,Chanyman,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:25:47 2015 UTC,You will still need to cycle the tank. It won't take very long however. Are you planning on adding any invertebrates other than coral?
ReefTank,3bb6p9,Thejanitor86,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I might get a pair of cleaner shrimp a few months in, but at the moment I'm focussing on keeping mostly corals to move into my 180G when I set it up again in 6 months time."
ReefTank,3bb6p9,HunkyMunky,2,Sat Jun 27 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"With a lot of coral, you still have to feed anyways. I would let the tank cycle even if you're not adding fish."
ReefTank,3bb6p9,nuropath,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"Ya, this. If you're going to add a lot of coral quickly you want to make sure you get a full cycle and give that bleached rock time grow up a little. You'd be surprised how much spot feeding can contribute to the load on the tank."
ReefTank,3bb6p9,Thejanitor86,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to mostly be focussing on SPS as I've had LPS before and feeding SPS seems like a waste of time, plus LPS super easy to take care of."
ReefTank,3bb6p9,theMeaniePanini,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:22:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's less of a cycle and more of a letting the new water mature. Getting good bacteria growing and spreading to all the new rock."
ReefTank,3bb6p9,Thejanitor86,2,Sat Jun 27 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"well If his dry rock was used in a tank before he will still have to cycle as the leftover organics decompose, but yes it should be very short compared to a regular tank"

It doesnt sound overstocked to me in terms of fish, ill be honest, i skimmed the invert list. But you could definitely add some larger fish.  I have a diamond goby, and i love him. But be warned he is an a$$hole! And he will move a literal f@ckton of sand in a day! He piles it into a mountain in the morning, i flatten it out at night. It's like hes going to work at the job sight every day.  As far as angels go, they can be super agressive so be very cautious. A nice addition might be some tangs or foxfaces. They are both beautiful and super fun to watch. Just research the species for aggressive tendencies."

I also have a cleaner shrimp and a clean up crew made of snails.  You'll probably want to trash the sponge it came with and use the filter area as a sort of sump. Your live rock will be more than sufficient for biological filtration. I have my heater, Purigen, chemipure elite, and phosguard tucked in there.  Mine isn't as pretty from all viewing angles because I have a HOB refugium from finnex. I grow pods/chaeto back there.

In this side of the hobby you will lose more money than you have ever imagined (but it pays off). For a 5gal salt tank you really cant stock much here is a list of some stuff I recommend to get a nice mini reef.  -10 lb bag of fiji pink sand (live would be best) -5-15lbs of LR (try and get some nice purple pieces) -for water you should just buy it pre mixed but to get the best water possible you can buy some Red Sea saltwater mix then but some RODI water from your LFS -With saltwater aquariums its very important you test your levels and corals require certain things that you will have to dose I recommend buying some Red Sea test kits you CAN buy Api kits but they are much less accurate  - Also for the aquarium the best thing to do before putting in the sand water and rock is to put either some egg-crate which you can buy at Home Depot or some acrylic, then put your rocks because if you place the rock on the sand any burrowing critter can make the rocks unstable and potentially ruin the tank -When you set up the tank it will take a 2-5 weeks to cycle just keep checking the params until it is stable then you can start adding live stock -Since the tank is small there arent many fish you can have so I would stick to inverts •assorted snails •assorted hermit crabs •one shrimp (skunk cleaner or fire) •then you can add as many corals as you can  fit if you want (I would stick to softies like leather and zoanthids)  •If you keep on your water changes and watch the params you might be able to get some sort of goby such as a watchman, clown goby, shell dwelling, etc -make sure you also have a heater and some decent lights, you can get some small nice LEDs which will work best   Sorry for the long post but its hard to fit it all in a small text"

ReefTank,3b0ygs,ThatWolf,2,Thu Jun 25 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, as nanobro said, the significance is that a lot of these deep water corals/reefs have not been discovered as they are outside the depth reachable by divers, and these are different than other deep water corals (like those found off Ireland's coast relatively recently).

ReefTank,3b0hhb,GreyingMantis,2,Wed Jun 24 23:54:30 2015 UTC,I believe the small crab is a standard hermit. The large looks like a red legged or scarlet hermit. The starfish are asterina starfish.

ReefTank,3b0hhb,Sundown865,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"So. Your parameters are a bit off, nitrates are a bit high, and SG you want to try to get down to 1.024-1.025 . Temp is also high, though I know people that run their tanks hotter, personally I keep mine at 77-78F. Do you know what your nitrites are?  Unfortunately I don't know much about nano-cubes. But it sounds like you have insufficient filtration. In a reef tank you generally should be running a protein skimmer, that would definitely help your water quality and the film you're seeing, If nothing else you may want a hang-on filter.  From what I've know, your corals losing color is usually either from way too much light, bleaching. Or way too little light and they're basically dying. The LEDs you're running may not have enough power output.  In order: 1. Yes 2. Kenya Tree I believe, def. not a xenia. 3. Yep 4. Mushroom, could be a watermelon, but hard to tell from pic 5. zoa 6. Yep 7. on the right, looks like knopia. left, I cant tell. rest, I agree with Sox.  Watch the stars, they are technically a pest."
ReefTank,3b0hhb,Starcryst,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:29:03 2015 UTC,"You really jumped into the deep end.  Having such a small tank, your main issue will be stability.  You may want to invest in a ATO (auto top off) to help keep your water level and salinity levels stable.  The film at the top is there for lack of water movement, move the powerhead up to agitate the surface and it should go away."

ReefTank,3b0hhb,toiletbowltrauma,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"Wow. You inherited a nice-looking tank. It probably took a lot of work to get there. I must say my heart dropped a little when you said it was neglected for three weeks to a month. You really need to stay on top of nano tanks. But it does look really nice.  *Edit: Yeah you need to step up your filtration game. Nanos can run without protein skimmers, but that requires at least 10% water change every week, without fail. I built my own protein skimmer for my nano and it has made a HUGE difference. They're not crazy expensive, but my budget is very low. You have the rocks and such that provide natural filtration, but I would add some overkill like purigen and if you have phosphates get some phosban, tie it up tight and wrap it in filter foam/padding. You can leave phosban in until the phosphate levels start to rise again. Another thing that would be very helpful is a HOB refugium, but you've got a big enough nano where you can get away without that pretty easil.y"
ReefTank,3b0j41,Highball2814,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:08:21 2015 UTC,"You'll probably get a mini cycle, more from the addition of the live sand as there's always a bit of death in those bags, than from the loss of your current substrate.

ReefTank,3b0j41,nuropath,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:17:05 2015 UTC,"Your sand is live. I would do this. Don't worry, the rock is your main filter. The sand is mainly aesthetic.    Drain the tank without touching the substrate and put all the rock and inhabitants in a big trash can with a heater and power head. Remove the substrate and place in another bucket Set the tank up barebottom in the new location. Do not use new water, use the old water, or at least 80% old water and 20% new. Corals don't like switching to a whole new system.  Wash the substrate until the water runs clear. I mean really wash it. Wash it like you mean it. Tap water is fine. You'll be horrified how filthy it is. Let it dry. Probably take a few days Place the substrate back in the tank. You can use a pvc pipe and a funnel to minimize the mess. However since you washed it, it won't make much of a mess at  all if you just use a cup."

This is how I've done freshwater, only I have done #4 first a couple of days before the move, then I can add the substrate when I set up.

ReefTank,3b0s4l,TheDocks,2,Thu Jun 25 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"Get the filter, protein skimmer is only there for removing dissolved organic material. I'd run chemi-pure elite and purigen in the filter if there is space for it, along with some filter floss.  As for chromis, both of those things are true. They school if you have a larger amount of them but if it's just two, one will probably kill the other.  I'm not a clownfish fan but they can be kept alone, some of them can have quite the temper and will absolutely be defensive of their ""territory"". That includes defending their space against your hand, they've been known to bite. From what I've read, Ocellaris are the most docile of the bunch.  As for a goby, a pistol shrimp/watchman combo can be cool but they will tear up your sand bed and may go after your snails if they're hungry."

ReefTank,3b0s4l,aiydee,2,Thu Jun 25 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"Righto.  So initial step.  Protein skimmer is fine.  Power head good.  Heater (of course). Cycling:  Your live rock is your cycling.  Don't add fish until cycling is complete.  This can take some time.  I've seen it go by in a flash (Typically when someone just fills with live rock from get go) through to 2, 3 or 4 months.  Adding any fish is just torture for the fish.  Don't do it. Live rock quantity.  It's not as much as you think.  If you filled the bottom with about 0.5"" - 1"" of sand and added about 5lb of rock, you'll be good. Next.  Test kits.  Seriously.  Test kits.  Buy some.  You'll need:  Ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, ph and alkalinity as bare minimum (assuming no coral.  ph/kh tie together and are needed for a stable system). 4 fish is pushing it.  3 fish fine. Fish I'd recommend looking at:  Cardinals (Pyjama or Bangaii), Blennie.  Hawkfish. I'm not a huge fan of hermits.  I prefer snails.  But each to their own.  The snails clean the glass and sand.  The hermits clean the rock and sand.  A turkey baster can blast the rock to clear the detritus so the snails can eat.  Cleaning the glass is a PITA. Clownfish are quite (read: VERY) aggressive.  They are kinda cool.  Very hardy.  And whenever you have a saltwater tank people ask if you have a clownfish.  But there you go. Blennie have LOTS of character.  Likewise hawkfish (Pro tip:  If you have a hawkfish, you don't have shrimp.  If you had shrimp, you HAD shrimp).  Cardinals are good 'middle of water column swimmers' and much more hardy, yet less aggressive, than chromis.  (Seriously.  Check out Pyjama cardinals.  Would you prefer some of them or a chromis!) Hope that helps. Otherwise.  The next bit of advice I give you is this.  Water changes.  If somethings not right.  Water change.  (10% minimum).  Weekly?  Water change.  Nothing fixes more issues than frequent, good quality, water changes. OH.  And water topup etc.  RODI filter.  Tap water is terrible in marine tanks.  (Say hello to algae and other problems if you do!)  Get an RODI filter.  Use the water for topup and mixing with salt.  If you get a fish-shop that says you don't need it, smile politely, and realize that this place is not for you."

ReefTank,3azvxk,halfbakedromeo,2,Wed Jun 24 22:19:41 2015 UTC,Two clowns would have eventually been too much. Three fish is too much as well unless they are some type of nano gobie. Or two pairing gobies with one pistol shrimp. Or two pistol shrimp with one gobie might work as well.

I don't see jelly on the dying/receded heads.  I had what I think must have been brown jelly on my nice healthy torch coral and within 3 days all 4 heads were gone. They were large too.   I'd siphon off any evidence of the jelly and frag off the affected head before it spreads. It really spreads very rapidly.

ReefTank,3b02wz,its_the_perfect_name,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I'd make sure you're positive that's what it is first.   I wasn't successful in treating it at all. Some people say Lugol's solution or a more concentrated iodine dip is the only thing that works on brown jelly, and even that's only marginally effective. I didn't have any at the time (I've since bought some) so I can't weigh in either way.  I'd read more about what others have successfully done if I were you, as far as I know the best thing is iodine."
ReefTank,3b02wz,Sundown865,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"something is definitely wrong... It's hard to tell from the pic if it is brown jelly. I had that on a duncan a while back, that spread to one head of another duncan, and the only thing to for sure cure it is to cut off the affected heads. that was losing about 2 of the 5 heads I have. It hurt, but now it's back over 10 heads... It sucks but it's for the greater good.  That said, my LFS lost about 5 heads of a beautiful torch because they went with the dip and wash method when 1 head became infected. Removal of the head is the only surefire solution to save the coral and the rest of the tank. If it spreads you're screwed.  I will say, the polyp recession you're seeing looks exactly like how my recession started, but before it gets bad enough where the whole thing is covered in slime, you need to look for... like a brown, dirt almost, basically buildup of crap on the areas where you're losing the polyp. That was a precursor for me of the BJ.  DISCLAIMER: If it were me, as paranoid as I am of that jelly and how devastating it is, I would immediately cut off the affected heads. You might not NEED to, it might be over kill... But then again it could spread to the whole thing. When BJ takes hold it can cover a coral completely in a day."

If I loose these two heads I'll definitely amputate the colony to try save it. Fingers crossed it won't spread to my frogspawn.

As long as you have sand sifters ( jawfish, gobies, nassiurus snails, bristle worms etc ) the sand depth never really plays a factor. Even over on other larger forums there are huge heated debates between what kind of sand bed is better.

(Also pretty peaceful) cuz compatibility charts all say no but they also generalize with the fishes breed and since most dotty backs are aggressive and most basslets are semi aggressive I think they would take that into account more than the specific breed.

That's more because the corals require flow and to keep detritus from settling in our tanks, the effects can be much more devastating to a reef tank.  Bacterial colonies don't require a lot of flow.  My 105 has over 4000GPH flow from powerheads alone.  There is a spray bar from the canister and a single powerhead in your tank?  If you really want to up your flow (and I don't know if it would destroy your tank or not) but you could pick up a Jebao RW-4 for about $80 and it is controllable and capable of up to 1000GPH.  One thing to consider is since you have a planted tank, typically plants like lower flow to soak up the nutrients.  In our tanks when we run a refugium it's best practice to have a slower flow through there, so it might make more sense for your tank to have a lower flow.  You probably want just enough flow to keep detritus from settling in dead spots.  I'm sure a fully grown in planted tank has flow problems from the plants filling and blocking it as is."
ReefTank,3auigw,AquaticReefer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"Well TIL. I guess I'll see how my plant growth is affected by this if nobody tells me otherwise. This isn't super high flow, but it seems to generate a bit of movement over on the right side so hopefully it'll circulate everything."
ReefTank,3auigw,zsxking,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:41:39 2015 UTC,FWIW I don't do FW planted so I'm trying to equate what knowledge I have about them to your world.  It may not be accurate so I suggest you do a little more research.  In our tanks we basically put as much flow as we can without creating a sandstorm and knocking our corals over.
ReefTank,3auigw,ThatWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"Alright. I think the best research here is going to be experience. If my carpet takes off on my left side, I'll know it's working well."

Look for ones close enough to you that they offer a cheaper shipping option, usually if you are within a state of the seller instead of a 40$ shipping it will be 15$. Also be on the lookout for reef shows. Save up your money for a reefshow ( great prices, tons of vendors), I have to drive around 3 hours to get to my nearest one when it happens twice a year but you can make a day trip out of it and bring other reef friends along. You will find good deals and amazing corals in person if your willing to search and find a show.  Reefs2go, Don't use them, poor coral, poor service, no return policy just credit. Do not let their prices tempt you for coral, I have heard decent things about the cleanup crews tho.  CultivatedReef, Great website and was my first website I ordered coral from, prices are average and sales come along every now and then. I was happy with my order and all coral are still alive over a year later.  Spikes Coral, Good website price and coral wise. Frags may come a little smaller than expected but he is close enough to me to get 15$ shipping.   UniqueCoral, I love these guys, the prices are high but the quality of the frags you get match what your payed. The prices on their coral is often because the pieces are higher end anyways. The shipping is 19$ no matter where you live though, I try to stay near this website just because of the cheaper shipping."
ReefTank,3auuiq,parasuta,2,Tue Jun 23 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on getting started.   -- The crushed coral should be fine to use... just rinse it again.(unless copper medicine was used in that tank? I could be wrong about that) -- I don't think any digging organism would have a problem with it.  But you might see pieces of the crushed coral come to the surface. ( For instance, Ive noticed pistol shrimps like to find all the shells in your sand bed / coral plugs they can get and use them for their caves.) -- I think 1 more 20 lb bag would be enough...  I believe this is the formula... Length of tank x Width of tank x Thickness of sand desired/20= Lbs So for you: 60x18x2=2160/20=108 lbs"

ReefTank,3auuiq,leveldrummer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:28:25 2015 UTC,"The crushed coral will not stay on the bottom of the sand, the sand will settle into the crushed coral, it will mix, and the CC will end up on top.

If its in your budget, I would seriously consider getting a bag or two of nice regular dry sand and washing it.  its not that big of a deal as you think and will save you headaches in the future."

One pump in the middle of your back wall will cover the entire tank and give lots of random flow the corals will really love. For a 40B the 7ml model will do a great job. I run a 10ml in mine, but I want more SPS and I prefer heavy flow in the 80x to 100x turnover range."
ReefTank,3atzzi,polo1126,5,Tue Jun 23 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"With that much cycling additive, you're probably not gonna get any. Bio spira is pretty damn good in my experience. I just kept adding a daily amount of food when I did bio spira and I NEVER saw ammonia, just one day a little bit of nitrite and then a week later about 10ppm of nitrate and that was it. I just let that go for about two more weeks before I was comfortable adding live stock.  You did bio spira AND live sand, so I'd say keep adding food (or whatever you've been doing to create ammonia) and let that go for another two weeks and then you're probably super safe to add livestock. The dudes at Bulkreefsupply will add biospira and like one fish, and they don't seem to have any problems but that's kind of an unpopular technique round these here parts  That being said, if I've learned anything so far, it's that rushing shit will not likely have good results and waiting just to be sure isn't gonna hurt anything but you're impulsive nature. yes, you're being a little impatient"

I'm not saying that if you go out right now and buy a fish that he's gonna die tomorrow, but that's less likely to happen if you wait another week.

(more on that in the sump section)  Sump: (my next project will be to replace this sump as it has some issues) An old amiracle bio ball sump I gutted, My drain flows into a 7"" sock and then spills into the second chamber which contains the skimmer and pump. There is no baffle between the skimmer and pump so microbubbles are a problem. The sponge from the pump helps, but not a whole lot. The other issue is the inlet side of the sump is 3/4"" while my drain is mainly 1"" so my drain narrows and my pump can outrun my drain if my ball valve is not tuned just right. The biggest problem caused by the pump and skimmer sharing the second chamber is that this is the chamber that changes water level with evaporation. As soon as the water level drops, the skimmer becomes rather useless, and if I add too much water back, I have a full cup all of a sudden. An ATO would fix this, but really what I need is a baffle to maintain a constant water level in the skimmer chamber.  Since I cannot add one with the sump in service, I'm designing a new, slightly larger sump with proper baffles and chambers.   I'm planning out a new sump that can be swapped in at the joints and will have a 1"" inlet, baffles to create a skimmer chamber of 7"" deep, and host a refugium.   Skimmer: Reef Octopus 110 SS classic, internal pump, low profile. The skimmer works great and while I occasionally get very upset with it, that is the fault of the sump, not the skimmer.   Environment:  I have around 45 lbs of live rock, including the very heavy sun coral skeleton that was originally a center piece but became a liability for crushing something so I put it in the back on its side, I was considering breaking it up into coral rubble, but right now I'm just leaving it. It's cool, but just so heavy. I used around 20 pounds of live sand and may eventually increase that it as it seems a little low.   Salt: Instant Ocean Reef Crystals,  SG: 1.024-1.025 Temp: 78.5-79.5  Livestock  2 Ocellaris Clownfish  3 Nassarius Snails  10+ Astrea snails   10+ dwarf blue hermit crabs (Under very poor guidance from a friend I put 50+ in there, have since been working to rehome them, I'm down to about 10 and may just let them run the course.)  I had 1 Mexican Turbo Snail, he might have fallen, but I blame the crabs, as his shell was entirely clean by the time I got home from work.   Corals:   1 finger leather coral,   1 small colony of green and orange zoas  1 colony of brown star polyps (though they look more red/purple to me)  1 booming colony of green star polyps  2 little button polyps.   I purchased the leather and the zoas, the rest were all hitchhikers.  The tank officially launched on April 10th of this year, and my first fish went in on May 18th, and the clean up crew went in a little before that. (stupid crabs). I probably could have moved them in sooner, but I had a bad ammonia test kit that read .5 PPM constantly."

Sustainable Aquatics did not even have the stock to offer them until recently (takes a long while for them to get the stock up).

ReefTank,3as9pi,NoxelTolth,3,Tue Jun 23 02:35:54 2015 UTC,"Most corals stay closed for the first day or 2, and any changes you make in their vicinity (moving rocks or other corals) will extend that time.    It sounds like you are moving very very quickly. My advice moving forward, introduce things one at a time, multiple corals are not a huge deal, but you just added some bioload as well, they're not big bioload, but you could cause a mini-ammonia spike and you don't have a lot of margin for error because you just added so many new corals, they'll all be exposed.  Lots of small trips to the LFS are better than one big one, give the system time to adjust after adding anything."
ReefTank,3as9pi,reenact12321,3,Tue Jun 23 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"Mk, well I'll start by saying don't panic. Sounds relatively normal; when I bought my first GSP it stayed closed for like 1.5-2 weeks, it was my first coral and now the thing is huge and super bright. GSP can be finicky at first.  3 corals isn't a ton of new additions, just keep an eye on your chemistry. Your big risk here is that you MUST be sure your tank is cycled before you add stuff. If it is, great. If not you could be looking at an upcoming spike of nitrites. What is your ammonia? During the cycle youll see a spike in ammonia, then nitrites, then nitrates, then it will settle out. If you used live rock, sand etc. this could have happened within a week, but if you used dead rock it almost for sure has not happened yet.  IMO: Seems reeeeally early for a star... you usually only want to add those to an established tank. Right now you should just have CuC in the tank to let it mature.  Finally as a general rule, don't add store water to your tank! (unless you have to) Let them float longer and then move them to your tank. For fish, drip them and toss the mixed water."

ReefTank,3as9pi,Look_over_yonder,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:52:17 2015 UTC,I let the bags float on top of the tank for 30 minutes. Then I ripped open the bags and clipped them to the side of the tank so the tank water would mix with the store water. I did that for about 30 minutes. Then I put them in the tank
ReefTank,3as9pi,paladin10025,2,Tue Jun 23 04:33:28 2015 UTC,Are you saying that the store water is now part of your tank's water?
ReefTank,3as9pi,Fishy-Business,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:05:26 2015 UTC,Try your best to keep other people's water out your tank. Also dip you coral before putting them in the tank with a product like coral revive or coral rx.

The kenya tree and GSP are  both super hardy coral and hopefully in 6 months you will be wondering about how to prevent their spread.  For corals I usually don't bother acclimating at all - just shake it a bit in the container to see if anything falls out and then put right into the tank. Have never lost a coral due to lack of acclimation. Temp acclimating is probably a good idea.  And that fire worm was probably a bristle worm. If you see any more, leave them alone - they are probably beneficial with only a slight chance of being bad."

In this shop though they would have some gorgeous fish stuck in a tank with some plastic rock or a plastic shark and I would get so angry at the store owner for doing this I was about 8 at the time. I used to say 'no one will buy your fish when you've got them living with plastic ornaments! It looks a lot nicer when everything is real' and he would just shrug and say 'ah well' after a year of my weekly visits and me giving him an ear full about it at every opportunity I could (My dad would tell me off every time I did this) the owner finally bought some live rock for the fish and guess what his sales boomed so much he bought another shop in another part of the city.

ReefTank,3aqsjk,imightgetdownvoted,3,Mon Jun 22 19:26:26 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you try the turf algae scrubber. I like to keep things as simple as possible in my tanks. Chasing numbers with dosing all sorts of chemicals can get really complicated and I don't really like adding a bunch of things into the tank that aren't necessary. I had a excess nutrient problem for a while and my entire tank got completely covered in GHA. I lost several coral due to that damn GHA and the ~20ppm nitrates didn't help at all either. I also got infested with pyramid snails which killed my nice maxima and all my turbos which kept the GHA at bay some. Finally  I made and installed my own turf algae scrubber. It took a few weeks for it to really start kicking in but once it did, WOW. Now there are a few very small tuffs on GHA in my display which is a huge improvement from literally every inch of rock covered in several inches of GHA. I also pull sheets of it off my scrubber every 2 weeks or so. Having the scrubber and skimmer running has brought my nitrates and phosphates both down to zero. I have also been able to increased my feedings which my remaining corals are loving. The only thing I dose now is kelkwasser with my top off water. The more simple and natural the better IMO. Another added bonus of the scrubber is the maintenance. Besides the initial building of the scrubber, it takes very little time to just grab huge sheets of GHA off of it. Less tests and less dosing will save you time, money, and effort."
ReefTank,3aqsjk,Underwateraven,3,Tue Jun 23 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"Take a look at purigen.  It may help you with the nitrate issue.  Also, what is your water change schedule along with feeding and light?  I had issues with hair algea for awhile myself.  I would remove it, which i saw as a form of nutrient export but it did not take long to come back.  my water tested fine, but figure that has to be something for all that hair algea to grow.  Take a look at your bulbs or light schedule.  If you are not using LEDs, it might be time to replace your bulbs.  Bulbs over 6 months can lead to more algea growth you dont want.  Also look at how long you leave your lighting on.  I found switching over to more blue wave lenght of light and only running my white lights for 2-3 hours a day also cut down on some hair algea growth.  Water changes are a great way of waste export as well as bringing trace minerals back in.  My hair algea is gone now, but i did get a yellow tang.  that is not an option for you.  If you are thinking of a fish method, an algea blenny may eat hair algea, but i have heard not all like it.  I have not really jumped on the dosing bandwagon.  I feel like often they have some side effect that you the have to dose with something else, then something else on and on."
ReefTank,3aqsjk,wintercast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"My waterchange's for the longest time were 8 gallons once a week. A lot of people told me 8 gal in a 27 gallon tank was too much so I cut it back to 4 gal. I've gone back to 8 gallon changes as of last week, and I might even do 8 gallons twice a week for a while to bring down my nitrates/phosphates. Do you think that's overkill?  My lights are maxpsect razor 160w. I was running it from 10:00am to 10:00pm, maxing out at about 45% power for most of the afternoon.  I've cut that back to 12:00pm to 10:00pm and 40%. It's usuallt in the 25-35% power range since the light ramps up and down during the day. It runs at 40% power for about 3 hours. White light runs for probabaly 6 of the 8 hours.

The only things I did to get it under control is lower my light cycle from 10 hours to 8 and to run GFO in gradual, slowly increasing amounts. In your cause slowly ease off of  dosing and see what happens, worse case scenario you just start dosing again. Honestly plate corals shouldnt have any problem with flow unless you are literally ripping the flesh off of it. Your coral problem might be coming from some other kind of imitators."

Get the lights here, get some plastic from Delvies, slap it together and call it a day.  If you don't want to DIY go here or for the cadillac, here  Best move I ever made.  You get to leave the coral food in the tank and when it turns into N and P it gets dealt with and I don't have to spend any money on a bunch of treatments."

Once i was running 2 cables parallel, one of them was inducing voltage into the other one on the range of 20~v.    When i talked to my electrician friend trying to understand what was going on, he explained to me that this was normal and the amps were probably in the range of 0.001 amps...  The multimeter probe you're putting in salt water (wasn't made to touch salt water but electronic cirtuits)is probably acting like very basic battery (like children science experiments with lemons /potatos , it's way too early and my chemistry class is way too long ago to explain the principle).

ReefTank,3aolgx,notaspookorgook,4,Mon Jun 22 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"Not going to answer all of the questions, but I have to kind of disagree with the ""bigger is better"" for beginners. Yes having greater water volume allows for a more stable tank...but the maintenance required for large tanks (my first tank was a 65g) is just such a shock going from FW -> SW. Unless you are going to get an ATO and have a salt water mixing station I found it a lot of work to keep the water topped off and do regular water changes for my 65g. This led to me doing less water changes (not even monthly) because I dreaded all of the work associated with it. I gave my brother my 65 and got a 29 gallon and it is safe to say I like my 29g wayyyyyyyyy more. Yes I cant keep as a wide range of fish as in the 65, but you can still fit in 3 pretty cool fish in a 29 gallon and tons of coral (which is why I am into SW anyways). I find with my 29 gallon that water changes are so easy, and its no hassle at all so my parameters in my 29 gallon are actually way better than they ever were in my 65.   Also you are 25? Plan to move anytime soon? If so good, luck moving a large tank, such a pain. I have moved every year for the last 3 or so years and my 29 gallon has made each move with me with no real pain (its bare bottom as well to make moving easier).   Also buy used! Preferably off a local reefer board over craigslist or kijiji. You can find some pretty sweet deals for almost complete systems at a fraction of the cost of what you would buy from a large retailer."
ReefTank,3aolgx,DrTrout,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"What fish do you have in your 29? Any do you have any suggestions? I'll more than likely go with that Marineland setup.i could imagine topping off SW tanks are more of a hassle than fw. Just last night my tank in my bedroom was making too much water splash noise and I couldn't sleep. So I just grabbed a cooking sauce pan, put water in it, dechlorinated it, and topped it off. Easy.   I do live in an apartment, which is also why I am not going to get another huge tank. I will dread moving as I already have 3 fish tanks, but that'll be in a few years atleast hopefully.   I've bought all my tabks off craigslist. There is no SW on Craigslist right now, which really sucks. I will try kiji though"
ReefTank,3aolgx,DrTrout,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"Currently I only have two clowns, but previously I have had both a bi-color blenny and a green clown goby. Both of those fish were really cool and had tons of personality and loved to perch. My clowns are pretty cool (you can get some pretty funky patterns for not too much) and they definitely get excited when you come to the tank and they think they are getting fed.    In SW its not just the noise you have to worry about for topping off - its the effect that evaporation has on salinity. If you are going into SW I would recommend buying a RO unit or buying RO water in bulk from a grocery store instead of using tap water, even if you treat it. I spent like $4.00 a week on RO water for top offs and another $4 every couple of weeks for a water change."
ReefTank,3aolgx,SwineFluPandemic,2,Tue Jun 23 14:24:50 2015 UTC,"1) Mark my words, if you don't go big you're going to go big later and it'll just cost you more money. Go with the longest tank you can afford. Something like http://www.glasscages.com/?sAction=OrderForm&sProdID=AQ_100Long maybe. I'd get the standard stand and sump combo. Then you can get a decent DC pump and be good to go.  2/3) It varies. As far as keeping your costs low, go with T5s for lighting, a maxspect gyre for flow (far superior to other wavemakers), and a budget skimmer like an SCA-302 or something. Those are the areas where it's REALLY easy to burn money. People are down with LEDs, and so am I (own 3 Radion XR30w), but bulbs give amazing results without a lot of tinkering and accidentally frying your corals, and they're cheaper. They only become less cheap (breaking even on bulb costs vs LED fixture costs) YEARS out, by which time you'll probably have upgraded fixtures or something anyway.  4) A skimmer. You need a skimmer for salt. It's magic. A filter that you never need to buy new stuff for. Just set it correctly and empty it every now and then. Running a reactor with GFO in it (flakes of rust) is something you do in salt that you don't in fresh as well. Check out the BRS youtube stuff about GFO/carbon. Another good thing to have is an apex gold package controller, but you can get that later once you realize how much you want and maybe need it.  5) AIO tanks are fine, usually something about them ends up being suboptimal, but I wouldn't get a 29g anyway as per 1)"
ReefTank,3aolgx,Pink_Punisher,2,Mon Jun 22 06:11:21 2015 UTC,"I would suggest starting with something no smaller than a 40 breeder (36""x18""x16"") if you don't mind it being slightly bigger than get a 50 breeder (18"" tall instead of 16""). A 40 or 50 gallon is big enough that you will have some stability in the system if you ever want to leave for a few days with no real concern. It also provides you with 18"" of depth front to back so you can aqua scape the tank MUCH nicer than a more standard 12"" wide tank. If your set on length then get a 40 gallon long. Though the longer you go the more you'll pay on a light fixture. You could potentially light a 3' tank with a 2' light if your not intending on keeping all high end corals, which I assume you won't because this will be your first tank. I personally run a combo of T5 and LED. I would likely suggest you run the same or one or the other. You can get pretty decent LEDs on Amazon for around $200 that would light up the tanks I suggested earlier quite well. Though be careful which you choose as there are many Chinese LEDs that look identical but have very different,  sometimes bad, light spectrums for corals. You could potentially get away without a skimmer on a 40 gallon or smaller but I would suggest one, you'll find it much easier to keep decent water parameters compared to doing large water changes every week.  You'll also get much better coral growth with a skimmer due to the cleaner water. Unfortunately your going to find out quite quickly this hobby is a bit of a shit show at times. Everyone has their own opinion and everyone's is the 'right' way of doing it. You'll find doing a lot of reading from a multiple forums will provide you with a somewhat balanced, broad spectrum of information rather than sticking with a single forum like Reef Central for example.   You'll be looking at a total cost of around likely $600-900 depending on if you buy new or used equipment and if you use dry rock rather than live rock to start out, which I would suggest. Way cheaper per pound, easier to aqua scape because you aren't on a timer, and no pests 100% guaranteed.   40 gallon - $40-$100 used vs new Stand - $50-$200 diy vs new  Lighting - $100-$250  Skimmer - $200  Rock - $30-50 vs $90-$150 dry vs live Sand - $40  Tl:Dr research a lot, don't buy equipment because it's cheap, you'll do nothing but regret wasting the money when you end up needing to buy the thing you should have bought originally. Also for the love of god don't let anyone try and convince to use tap water, you'll have nothing but algae problems, use RO/DI only. Most local fish stores sell it."
ReefTank,3aolgx,andyLDN,2,Mon Jun 22 12:25:42 2015 UTC,"You will always want bigger.  But I find there to be 4 tiers sorta.  Tier 1 is nano (<30ish).  Tier 2 is small fish ~30-65.  Tier 3 is medium/big fish (~75+) and Tier 4 is anything over 6ft in length, put nearly anything you want in there. I've built out a 30g and a 210g so far.  I'd bet my 210 is somewhere in the 6-8k range and there are still components I have on my wish list but it was ""running"" after I spent about 4-5k.  I'd say the 30g was probably around 1k and was up and running around $500.  On the 30g I went on the cheap and on the 210 I've been going mid-high end.  I spent more of my budget on lighting than anything else (outside of the tank/custom stand). I'd say Tiers 1-3 are all pretty similar in stuff you'd be buying for your tank currently.  Tier 4 start to get a little annoying.  I keep finding myself going, oh I need an X.  Then realizing that for a tank my size I need/want the $200 option instead of the $70 option or I need 4-5 lights instead of 1. Tank, Lights, Skimmer, Pump, refugium, live rock, sand, gyre, heaters, controller, ATO, reactor, auto feeder, RO unit, mixing barrel are what I can think I've got off the top of my head on the 210 build.  Strange how there are components I never thought I'd need/want that I'm buying to solve different problems I've faced that either didn't happen on the 30g or that the system handled much faster on the smaller tanks (cyano outbreaks, dinos).   I have yet to own an all-in-one cube, but just looking at the stats on most they should be ok to get you started in saltwater.  Planning a build is the most fun of the whole thing though and cubes suck all the life out of that.  I also haven't seen many cubes that come with lighting I'd want to keep for the long haul. These are different coral types.  Something you'll want to keep in mind with a saltwater tank is planning out your entire build, equipment, corals and fish, start to finish.  Make sure the fish are compatible with each other and the corals.  Make sure the corals are compatible with the fish, each other and equipment.  Some are  as simple as just chucking them in the water.  Some need better/special lighting/flow conditions.  Others will require more constant care/feeding and additives in the water.     It is certainly a learn as you go hobby, but it's so fun and why I went from a 30g to a 210g.  You'll save money now if you just buy a 6ft tank and get it over with, but what I learned running my 30g before the leap was well worth it."

The more you know before you buy anything, the most you'll save on wasted equipment costs, and dead livestock."
ReefTank,3aolgx,ThatWolf,2,Mon Jun 22 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"If you like money, don't do it."
ReefTank,3aolgx,ThatWolf,2,Mon Jun 22 19:27:09 2015 UTC,"1 - 40g breeders are popular options because they're big enough to give you plenty of stocking options, but small enough that it isn't to much of a PITA to move if you need to. Bigger is always better though, simply because the additional water volume makes the tank simpler to maintain. The cube tank you mentioned is also a popular choice, but you also reduce what sort of livestock options you can feasibly put into the tank.  2 - It's going to depend on what you end up stocking the tank with, how much automation you want, and so on. That being said, I would budget at least a few hundred dollars if you buy everything second hand from forums/CL to get going. This will change a bit depending on what kind of livestock you intend on keeping.   3 - This varies greatly, some coral frags you can buy for $5-10/ea. or you can buy a single 1-2"" frag that can set you back hundreds of dollars. The same applies to fish, some are inexpensive and others can cost over a thousand dollars. That being said, I would expect to spend $20-50/ea for fish and perhaps a bit less on some invertebrates. Fish can look significantly different once they've matured, though in the tank size you're looking at you won't see this in appropriately sized fish for your tank. Corals on the other hand will largely look the same, minus physical changes. The greatest thing that impacts the overall look/coloration of corals is going to be the tank parameters (e.g. lighting, nutrient levels, flow, water parameters, etc.). If the corals don't look stellar at your current LFS, it's probably worth checking out someone else in your area or go online.  4 - For a basic setup, you'll want good circulation pumps (min. 10x tank volume for flow), protein skimmer (HOB is a good option), live/dry rock, and sand in addition to what you've already listed. I would also highly recommend having your own RO/DI unit, it makes life so much simpler and they don't have to be permanently installed but it's by no means a 'must have'. From there you can go further with auto-top-off systems, tank controllers, and more that make the tank easier to maintain.  5 - They seem to be decent, the issue most folks run into with them is that the stock lighting is only really suitable for low light corals. Going further, from what I've seen, most folks end up modifying those tanks in some way to accommodate their needs at some point down the road.  6 - SPS = Small Polyp Stony and LPS = Large Polyp Stony, both of which are broad terms to describe different types of stony coral. That is to say, coral that have a hard skeleton. Typically SPS are harder to care for and require more exact/stable water conditions, the most flow, and the most intense lighting. LPS are easier to care for, but are generally the first corals to be picked on by any fish that may not be reef safe. They're generally in the middle when it comes to light intensity and in tank flow rate. Softies are by far the easiest corals to keep. By comparison they typically require the least amount of light, generally can handle 'bad' water parameters, and can require the least amount of flow. You'll also have non-photosynthetic corals as well, but I wouldn't recommend them if you're just starting out as they can be even more challenging to keep than SPS.  All that being said, proper research before you buy any equipment/livestock is paramount to long term success. After you've done your research about the types of fish/corals you're looking to keep, then start purchasing equipment. Last, but not least, never hesitate to ask questions."

ReefTank,3aolgx,ThatWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:53:52 2015 UTC,"You can get adapters to hook RO/DI units up to faucets, so they're only connected when you need it to be. Which is what I did until I decided to make a permanent connection. That aside, it would be worth having your tap water checked out. Water that's fine for freshwater tanks can contain phosphates/silicates/etc. that can cause algae issues in saltwater tanks or simply an imbalance in the other parameters (Mag/Calc/etc.). I personally have a well and even though the water is clean enough for me to put it directly into my freshwater tank, it causes algae blooms when I use it on my saltwater tank."
ReefTank,3aolgx,redsoxaa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:18:18 2015 UTC,"so is the RO/DI unit the equivlanet of me putting tap water in a few 5 gallon buckets, dechlorinating, and putting into my FW tank? i would only need to use the RO/DI unit when i am doing a water change?   also, ive noticed a LOT of SW tanks are just covered in brown diatoms/other algae. all over the glass, and very much so over the corals. i was on CL just now searching, found a couple good deals, but its making me scared that i'd never make it out of the brown slump."
ReefTank,3aolgx,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"It goes a bit further than that, using an RO/DI unit is basically turning your tap water into water that's suitable for use in a laboratory. It helps ensure that you know exactly what you're putting into the tank by removing just about everything else in the water (down to parts per million). Correct, you use the product water straight from the RO/DI unit without having to use a dechlorinator. The carbon block filter(s) will remove the chlorine/chloramines from the water. So if you want to, you can actually use the 'waste' water that comes out after the carbon blocks/RO section on your freshwater tanks.  That can be caused by a few things. It could be the water they're using, could be the rocks they used are leeching phosphates/silicates into the water, could be that they're overfeeding, maybe they're not keeping up on water changes, not enough water movement in the tank, and so on. I would say that those types of algae blooms are most often caused by overfeeding (by a healthy majority) followed by the others in no particular order. Of course, all new tanks will go through a diatom bloom during the cycle. Just the nature of the beast. After that, as long as you do your due diligence and keep up with tank maintenance, algae should never be a big problem."
ReefTank,3aolgx,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"ah, gotcha. gosh, i feel so silly. im the one usually guiding people about FW, up to causes of illness, causes of algae (which is obviously the same reasons as SW), what fish is compatible with what, down to what size tank said fish need--and not the petsmart/petco advice either, like true legit knowledge shared upon aquarium keepers.  im sure this is a silly question, but that nano tank you suggested, will also need/prefer the ro/di unit as well? maybe not perhaps so essential considering what is capable of sustaining life in that particular tank?"
ReefTank,3aolgx,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"No worries. Despite all the similarities, freshwater and saltwater tanks can be pretty different at times. So it's always best to do your research first. :)  It depends. If your tap water is good enough that using a dechlorinator is all you need, then you can go that route. Otherwise you can pick up RO/DI water from most supermarkets for cheap enough that spending over a hundred dollars on an RO/DI unit doesn't really make sense, since water changes aren't going to be that large. Some folks with small tanks get them simply because of the convenience. It's certainly worth trying out your tap water first, it's what I did. Though I did have to start using RO/DI because I had algae that did not go away until I switched water."
ReefTank,3aolgx,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"Given your history of aquariums, I'd say you are in for the long haul.  As such, research and buy quality components the first time around.  Try and have an idea what you want out of the tank long-term and buy it upfront.  If you want corals, make sure the lights are powerful enough up front etc... Skip the live sand and just get some good base rock and dry sand, the sand and rock will come alive as you cycle and slowly stock first animals.  I'd personally recommend 40 or 55 minimum.  I know it will be more work, but anything smaller really restricts the fish you can stock.  Once you decide on size of aquarium, people can point you in the right direction for individual components."

My spare pumps have saved me thousands of dollars. Drill your tank. Mine isn't drilled, and I could kick myself for it. It was my first tank and this is my biggest mistake ever.  If you have any other specifics just ask."
ReefTank,3aoiuv,triangle_coder,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:10:31 2015 UTC,Oh okay good ide to mix :o Drill the tank :o ? What do you mean by that :)?
ReefTank,3aoiuv,triangle_coder,2,Mon Jun 22 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"When you have a sump there are two main ways to get water to it. One is a direct connection through a hole that has been drilled through the tank, and has pipe that leads to the sump. The second way is an overflow box. The issue with that is it uses a siphon so while it is rare if a siphon breaks you can drain your sump thus burning up equipment due to running it dry, and it can also flood your display tank. It is considered best practice to get a drilled tank or drill it yourself if you are comfortable doing it."
ReefTank,3aoiuv,halfbakedromeo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:06:57 2015 UTC,Ohhh okay :o ! Will look in to that :)
ReefTank,3aoiuv,halfbakedromeo,4,Mon Jun 22 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"Don't rush things. One fish at a time after letting your tank cycle with no fish for one month. Best simple advice I can give. I'm a little tired after work at the moment, but can answer more questions later. One question at a time and I'll answer every time I get the chance."
ReefTank,3aoiuv,halfbakedromeo,2,Mon Jun 22 06:20:10 2015 UTC,"So basicly let tank cycle for 1 month , test kit on it if its ready for fish , Should I only buy one to start with or can i buy like 2? I was thinking to start with clowns ,when i get the chanse  or :o ?"
ReefTank,3aoiuv,hugofount,2,Mon Jun 22 06:58:42 2015 UTC,"After passing the tests for stable water parameters, yes a clownish would be a good choice. You could get away with two juveniles.  60 liters is a really small tank for saltwater standards as anything under like 151 liters is considered a nano like aquarium, where as the water isn't as stable and can be difficult to maintain by average standards unless you do water changes quite frequently. I have about a 110 liter which is considered small with two clowns and one yellow tailed damsel that I'm upgrading soon as it is getting a little cramped with so many rose bulb tip anemones and three fish.  I had to think about your question for a second because we go by gallons commonly in the US."
ReefTank,3aoiuv,MassSnapz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:08:01 2015 UTC,"Sadly I dont have alot of place(Live at home with just 1 room) , I would love a 100 liter tank but yeah no space apart from my super tiny bedroom with 3 aquariums in it already haha! Oh okay , the pet store got really cute clownish :c , If I had a 100 liter tank I toght about maybe 2 clownish and 3 Clown Goby, Citrinis, and maybe 2 Orange Spotted Goby  :O ? with some ''clean up crew stuff '' Or is that over stocked for a 100 liter?"
ReefTank,3aoiuv,unjung,3,Mon Jun 22 07:23:26 2015 UTC,"You could maybe do three fish. Or more if they are all nano gobies or something. But yeah thats overstocked. And I say maybe to three.  Two ocellaris clownfish with a clean up crew maybe some ornamental crustaceans would be good for a tank that size, and coral if your up for it after a few months. Cost of lighting etcetera can be quite expensive for coral. After 5 years I'm about 4k deep US. ($4,000 dollars US) invested in my tank. Of course thats when you cheap out the first time around."

ReefTank,3antej,toiletbowltrauma,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:29:45 2015 UTC,How would I get rid of them? I have heard of people taking the rock out and using a lighter to burn off pests without killing the rest of the rock. Should I do that?
ReefTank,3antej,SNESChalmers420,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:13:18 2015 UTC,I was in the position where I could use a screwdriver and a hammer and chip off the part of the rock where their colony lived.

ReefTank,3alwta,Kidnpmyheart,6,Sun Jun 21 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"Just off the top of my head because I seem to go to about 3-5 different sites for all of my information.  A place where I could enter a fish name and find care instructions, food likes, minimum tank size, differences if there are any from male/female, water quality it prefers etc.  Right now I will head over to liveaquaria for this information.  As I'm looking at the information on the fish I would want a hyperlink on suggested foods that I can click and it can take me to information on that particular food.    Corals:  Essentially the same as for the fish, but I would like to see information on what kind of foods a particular coral will eat, maybe methods of how to target feed a coral.  Water quality, light, placement, flow, supplements it needs, etc.  Again I have sites I use for this information when I want to research a coral I don't have much information about, but it would be nice to have concise data on any given coral that I want to search for.  Subsections on major categories of corals and then an index and button to click for a specific coral that pulls up more detailed information or pictures.  Also, pictures everywhere.  One of the best things about this hobby is that we have such a beautiful selection of these amazing creatures so I want to see a few pictures of the specific corals or fish that I am looking at.  Detailed information on things like different sump methods people use with pictures.  I want to see everything from the DIY rubbermaid bins to refugium setups.  A DIY section would be cool too for people that build their own overflows, tanks, sumps, stands, etc.   Information on foods plus maybe information on how to cultivate pods, rotifers, and different kinds of live food outside of the tank. I currently farm my own copepods outside of my system to supplement my dragonette when he isn't eating mysis.  It would be interesting to see other setups or information on how to setup these systems.  A whole section on large tank setups and a section on nano or pico tank setups.  Information on lighting.  That is probably the number one topic I see on here aside from the help me with my build posts.   A section on clean-up crews and what they do. A section on hitchhikers and which ones are bad/good  Sorry for rambling.  If something doesn't make sense just let me know.  I just kind of shot things off as they popped into my head."
ReefTank,3alwta,letmeaddnumbers,2,Sun Jun 21 17:20:15 2015 UTC,no need to apologize at all these were all wonderful suggestions. especially the DIY part. I didn't even think of that when I was writing up a list. I only thought of store bought parts and equiptment. So a DIY section would be pretty cool. :).  and i totally agree with the pictures.. i get super frustrated when im shopping online for a fish or something and I get a crappy picture or no picture at all. That's why I was thinking about the stream of tanks or a tank spotlight page where people can post a video or a picture of their tank and describe their process/equipment/livestock and where people can post comments and ask the tank owner questions. I feel like this would be a good way to learn since the majority of the problem solving comes from another reef tank owner who's learned from his mistake sharing what he/she has learned.  A page dedicated to diseases would work too. keep the ideas coming!
ReefTank,3alwta,letmeaddnumbers,2,Sun Jun 21 18:04:36 2015 UTC,I like the idea of having a stream on a tank and tank spotlight.  I really enjoy reading about other peoples setups because it gives me ideas for my own setup.  Diseases is a good one too.
ReefTank,3alwta,amboinensis,2,Sun Jun 21 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a web developer and agree with you about the forums. However, the forum format has been around for a long long long time because it works perfectly for having a discussion about a bigger topic. But when you think about it, this is ALL a bigger topic!  The thing about reefkeeping, and /r/reeftanks is an example of that, is that often the conversation is about a single item: a question, or a photo, and in that regard something like threaded comments would work better than a whole forum thread just to talk about how great your new frag is.  The other times you have a more ""journal"" type approach where a single photo+comments wouldn't work. This would be tank build threads, updates over time, or other long-term sometimes-updated discussions. I don't really want to scroll through 50+ pages of a built forum just to find the pictures.  I think what would work best is something like how the old Facebook works. If people could have followable ""profile"" pages for their tanks, where they post an update (status) or pictures, and people respond directly to those, then that would make things a LOT easier to read.  And the ""feed"" could be whatever topics (tags) I subscribe to. I don't really care about, say, RODI models or designer clowns but I'm interested in frag tanks and inverts, so that gives me a customized feed/list of discussions going on. Some of those discussions may be on a profile (2 years of updates on ""come check out my 600 gallon sexy shrimp habitat""), some may be more free-standing (""hey look at this awesome chalice I overpaid for"") but that way you keep it nice and clean and the interesting bits of information take precedence over the discussions until you want to get involved with that as well.  The above is basically following the older Facebook idea, but since that requires actual work to build, software such as Discourse might be a cool starting point as well. It's forums, but has that ""feed"" idea and is more modernized. Or something like Buddypress, although it's a giant pain to work with.  Oh and don't get me started on massive image-heavy sigs in forums..."
ReefTank,3alwta,cheese_king3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"I know the forum format has been around for a long time and its still around because it works. But there has to be a better way. Forums in my perspective are so messy. There's information all over the place. My ultimate goal with this site is to be able to provide users with a way to find the information they want as quickly as possible. Just because nothing good happens in this hobby when you do it fast, doesn't mean that the research has to be the same! :).  I definitely like the facebook idea. I totally agree with following only the topics you want. The idea of the ""status"" update is slowly growing on me. You're right. We don't need a thread dedicated to showing off your new frag. That should be a post shared on your page for your own pleasure.   This is what I had planned with the site so far. There would be a place for members. People can create their own ""page"" where they can share pictures of their tank and list their specs. (thats where it ended)  The site itself that everyone will see would be divided up in to a shit ton of pages. so the nav would go something like:  home, fish, clean up crew, coral, food, lighting etc For a topic like fish, coral, or CUC it would be broken down in to dropdowns. so for example, if i came to the site wanting to find information about Ocellaris Clownfish... I'd hover over fish, then find clown fish, hover over that, and find Ocellaris Clownfish from the list. It will then take me to a page dedicated to all of the care information for the Ocellaris Clownfish including food, water temp, tank size etc. My goal with this is to be able to provide users with the quickest way to find what they're looking for.  for the larger topics like lighting i obviously wouldn't follow suit since i'd be here forever making pages for the different light units. but it would be more of a ""what light would work for my tank"" type of page. Information about LEDs and hallogen lights... and this would be a good page for a thread where people can post ONLY threads for lighting questions. This page would also have a section for the most popular lights based on the users experience. So if someone was plannign on buying a light, but didn't really care much for looking through all of the brands and finding one. They could just look at the user suggested and order one of those. so since this page would have a thread, this would be something a member of the site could get notified on. So if they followed that page's thread, they could get notifications on when there was an update to that thread.  for compatibility, I wanted to dedicate its own page for that and have some sort of form where you can enter the fish you have in your tank and your tank size and it will spit out all the fish that are compatible with what you have. the same would go for tank planning. you would put in all of the fish that you're planning on having in your tank and the size you plan on getting and it will spit out the compatible fish. If you're in danger of overstocking the tank, nothing will show. so if I had 3 fish in an 8 gallon and I wanted to add more the search would spit back an error saying ""it seems that your tank is fully stocked. No more fish should be added at this time!""   for corals, theres just way too many, so it would follow some sort of suit with the lighting style but still have some sort of breakdown. So coral -> sps, softies, mushrooms, etc. say you wanted to know more about zoas. you'd hover softies and pick zoas from the list. I could NEVER list all of the zoas. again i'd be here forever. So you'd click on zoas and it would bring you to a general page with all the information you'd need to know about zoas in general. lighting conditions, flow, etc.   I wanted to do a spot on the homepage for a ""tank spotlight"" maybe once a month a user would be selected to display their tank on the spotlight. then people can comment and ask questions about their setup and learn from the spotlight user. Since half of this hobby is learning from other peoples mistakes and successes i feel like this would be a beneficial addition. Also, this would be a good way for the selected user to feel pride in their tank and learn as well.  there would be certain sections like nano tanks or large tanks that would be information/forum based. So there would be general information about how to start up a nano tank and there would be user suggested equipment. Then there would also be a thread on the page for people to ask questions about a certain product they were planning to add on their build.  basically, i wanted to limit the threads to page specific comments. I feel like this way it would be less cluttered and it would eliminate some of the searching."
ReefTank,3alwta,cheese_king3,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"I love this idea, as I'm also not a fan of forums. I definitely think having a section for folks new to the hobby would be great - including compatibility charts! Having all the info in one place, instead of scouring the internet/forums for hours would've been nice for me :)."
ReefTank,3alwta,cheese_king3,2,Sun Jun 21 17:15:49 2015 UTC,yes this is my ultimate goal.. the most frustrating part about being a newbie in this hobby is searching in MULTIPLE places for information. I always end up on threads from back in 2008 and i feel like that information is very dated and shouldn't be trusted.   I really want to go to just ONE website and find ALL the information I need.  Compatibility charts are a good idea :). I could make it better than those crap pictures and I can even make a little form where you fill out what fish you have/plan on having in your tank and it will spit out fish that are compatible :).
ReefTank,3alwta,Possumdd,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%! I think the form is a great idea, or even a Flow Chart. Something like ""Do you want corals?"" leads to next section-> ""Do you want fish to cohabitate with the corals?"" etc. This has been a lot of the issue we've been having- we want easy coral and fish, too. At first we didn't want clowns, but really there are not a lot of easy fish that can be with the LPS's (from what I've seen at least)."
ReefTank,3alwta,loony383,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! I'm building a 29 Gallon tank and I'm trying to figure out what fish I will be able to keep and I HATE looking at those crappy photos that are blurry and hard to follow correctly.   The form will make it so much easier. And as i mentioned to another poster I want to have it spit out an error that prevents the user from overstocking. So if they wanted to put 10 fish in an 8 gallon it would say something like ""we're sorry. It seems like your tank is fully stocked. No more additions at this time!"""

Or lets say, a Montipora Digitata frag that is maybe 2 inches and just starting to branch out for $15 vs one that is 6 inches already for $40?  In my personal opinion, the cheaper price makes it seem like less of an investment and is WAY more approachable.  I start to think about $$ and how much tank space this thing is going to take up if its much larger."
ReefTank,3al91h,ExdigguserPies,5,Sun Jun 21 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"I much prefer smaller frags because of the price but also because a small frag will grow appropriately for the place I want to put it, whereas a large colony can look unnatural. Plus I have a nano tank so large frags are often too big."
ReefTank,3al91h,Mokokomo,2,Sun Jun 21 10:33:54 2015 UTC,"For me personally id pick the smaller because I spend way to much in my tank as it is and I can justify the lower price easier, or spend more on other small frags(usually this happens). Also It's rewarding to see a small frag grow."
ReefTank,3al91h,steventhehammer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:46:10 2015 UTC,Smaller definitely. Sometimes I buy bigger frags and frag them myself and sell on craigslist. I like to have many different species

I don't care how good their prices are, I wouldn't put their stock in my QT and I wish their store was permanently closed. Bad word of mouth goes a very long way."
ReefTank,3al91h,PM_ME_UR_FTS,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:06:28 2015 UTC,"A couple of things off the top of my head:   Doesn't have to be a big store with a big selection, i'm totaly happy frequenting a small shop that brings in unique fishes regularly just to see what new surprises they might have. Also allows me to brush up on my own fish knowledge. For example, a local shop had Sargeant Major Damsels in stock recently. Same place had gold striped cardinals a few weeks ago. Never seen either one before locally. You don't need to have super knowledgeable employees, because in general, that's hard to find. Just give me a humble employee. ""I don't know"" is a totally acceptable answer to me. I get it, you're a kid who is working this job because you enjoy it and it pays you enough to have some spending cash. Doesn't mean you have to be the wiki of saltwater. But bullshit me, and i'm gone. I don't even bother buying corals in person. So many good deals online or from local reefers that LFS prices just can't compete. I pity my LFS, but as a consumer my interest is to get the best value for my money. An ideal LFS would stay competitive with online pricing. Not sure how tough that would be since I don't understand their costs, overhead, etc. Clean tanks. Gotta have clean tanks. If i see dirty fish tanks, sick fish, or hair/bubble algae on frags, I'm not buying. Reasonably priced dry goods. An indicator of whether or not a shop ends up on my A-list is the price of common commodities. 50w Heaters should be $20 or less. Anymore than that and I'm going to Amazon."
ReefTank,3al91h,SwankyCletus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"There was a LFS I went to for years for freshwater. They had a great selection, and reasonable prices, and the majority of the staff knew what they were talking about. They had a much smaller selection for saltwater fish and corals (one aisle compared to five freshwater). As I got into the saltwater portion of the hobby, I began to notice they had some really irresponsible saltwater livestock.  A distinct lack of tank-bred fish was not great, but something I could get over. (I realize there are species that can't be bred yet, but for fish like the Kaudern cardinal fish, supporting breeders greatly reduces impact on wild populations.)  What really bothered me was that they purchased fish that simply could not be well-kept in captivity. I understand experienced reef keepers can keep some species that most cannot, and these fish can be special ordered. This store kept a remora, and there was simply no way that fish would survive any length of time, or have a good quality of life. Aquariums are really the only place that sort of fish could have a chance at surviving, and any lfs carrying something like that is thoughtless and irresponsible."

I bought a rabbit after asking tons and tons of questions as I never owned a rabbit before. Long story short I was sadly misinformed. I spoke to the manager who basically told me to F off just not in this words exactly). Fast forward they were my ""go to"" for my salt water misadventures, until the sold me a mandarin, which had ich (I told the manager the symptoms, and he said he didn't know). He offered to sell me a new one at cost. I then looked up the symptoms and clear as day it was ich! My whole tank was infected. This is a guy who has been doing this 20+ years!

He was dumping the bags into cups then into his tanks after 5 min when they were ""ready looking"" and ""drip acclimation is useless.""

The nice thing with this arrangement is that your blenny is a bottom dweller and the cardinals are a mid/top dweller.  I would be careful with what you add because the tang can be a little territorial.  The only issue I can see is your cardinals not settling in nicely together.
ReefTank,3alvjo,Bodegus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I was going to add them first in hopes that theyll find each other easier, and the tang last to hopefully prevent too much territorial bullcrap. I was also gonna get the tang young."

Also looking at the picture, the light is very concentrated in the center of the tank; it appears as if there is no light reaching the sides of the tank. You will want something that has some blue LED's in it, as that is what makes colours pop. I would suggest two of these The spread on them isn't the best, but two of them will definitely cover the tank. There are also some custom built ones you probably can find at an lfs. Do not cheap out on lights; they are a very essential part to a reef. This isn't a cheap hobby (unfortunately), and spending more money on essentials will help your reef out a lot."

That doesn't mean more watts the better though since the higher it is the more quickly your temperature changes when it's on and you want it to be as stable as possible. Using 2 can be helpful just like having 2 sticks of RAM. If you only have one and it busts, your fucked  And if you have a good controller you don't need to worry about the heater's temperature reliability, so don't go all out.

It's been 3 days and the coralline algae has already started to spread from the live rock to the dead base rock, which is a good sign!  I'll add a few inverts in about a week, or when my water tells me it's time, slowly start to add coral one at a time in the few weeks after that, and probably wait about a month from now so it's cycled and ready to go before I add any fish."

You should leave the shrimp in there for a week or more if you're going to cycle that way; at least until you start seeing ammonia or algae blooms. If it started to smell, you probably don't have enough flow and surface agitation - how many power heads do you have in your tank?  Also, how big is the shrimp piece? For a 40g tank, you need maybe 1/2"" sized piece of shrimp. I've read people leave them in their tank to decompose naturally. I usually remove them once my nitrates spike and then start to fall."

You may be able to make a sump if you are handy with silicone and plexiglass and that could save some money, but if this is your first ever tank, the best piece of advice I can give is slow down, read and ask questions, and plan, plan, plan.  What do you eventually want your tank to look like? If this is your first ever tank, I would strongly suggest liverock and fish, and hold off on any sorts of corals for a while.   You've left a pretty open ended question and a lot of what you need depends on what you want. If you want corals, then lighting just got a lot more expensive.  Sorry, I am not trying to be vague or negative, I just want to help you do this the right way.  Did you purchase the tank new or used? If used, have you tested it for leaks?  Do you have a local fish store that you can get RO/DI water from?  Where do you plan to put this tank?

ReefTank,3affdy,chrilma,5,Fri Jun 19 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Hi, been keeping tanks for 30 years. Fresh and salt. The number one thing people do that causes problems is rush. It is a waiting game, and there's no way around it. It's no different than keeping your freshwater tanks with the exception of more parameters, narrower tolerances, and the cost of messing up gets higher.   You need test kits. The only way to know if your tank is cycled is by testing the water. IME, adding the bacteria is not a magic bullet for cycling. Those bacteria need to eat something. If there isn't anything in the tank for them to eat, they die off, and you are right back where you started. I think I read some studies that showed it may cut a day or so off of cycling. Test your water. See #1, I have used Prime, and never had it give a false positive. I don't think you are ready for fish and any ammonia reading the Prime contributes to will be gone when you are. You can keep 2-3 fish depending on what you choose. You aren't just dealing with bioload, but territorialism. Saltwater fish are a different game. Think about a few fish you would like, and pick the one that is your favorite. Build your tank around that fish, even though it may not go in first. LiveAquaria has some good information and their section on marive marine fish for beginners is where I would start looking. Invertebrates are much more delicate and yes, should not go into a tank less than 6 mos-1 year old.  Yes, you need that much, and possibly more. It also provides cover for your fish. This is my personal philosophy on filtration and some may disagree. There are different ways to adequately filter your tank. Some take more work to be effective. If you are willing to do the work, go for it. For reef, I love trickle filtration/sump because it is so easy and effective once you get it set up. The BioWheel you have may work depending on bioload. Having more live rock will take some of the load off your BioWheel. Personally, I wouldn't use it. It depends on more than just LED. spectrum and intensity matters. Can you give more details? Many invertebrates have a photosynthetic component to their biology. I would have the heater on to do ahead and get a stable water temperature.  Yes. Hydrometer for measuring salinity would be good. Make sure you get salt water test kits.   The best way to jump start your tank is to throw a piece of shrimp in there and let it rot and decay. This will help feed the bacteria and get your cycle going. Keep running lights and filtration normally. It will be 4-6 weeks.  Patience is your friend.  Edit: /u/reenact12321 makes a great point about RO/DI water. If you haven't started using it, do it. It will really save you some battles with the wrong types of algae growth."

We get desperate or lazy and cheap out on a part, only to buy the right part later, spending more overall than we needed to. Buy quality products. Start by getting yourselves a refractometer. This is the most accurate and affordable way to measure your salinity. Then save for QUALITY lights, they make a world of difference. Just take it slow, read a lot, and have fun!"
ReefTank,3affdy,ClosedRhombus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's start at the top.  Welcome to the hobby! I've been at this for about a year (including construction) and I've learned 3 important rules about doing a reef tank.   You can never read too much before making a decision, be it livestock, an equipment change, or an adjustment in parameters. Ask for advice, and talk to more than one source whenever possible. Never total up what you've spent. ;)   To start, you definitely do want to wait the 4-6 weeks. The false positive for the ammonia shouldn't last more than a day or two. You want to test regularly, every other day at least for awhile, mapping a trend of ammonia going up or going down.    You're doing a gentle cycle by only introducing live sand. Some of the microbes in the sand will die, generating ammonia as they decompose. A couple pieces of live rock would definitely help, but are not strictly necessary.   I doubt it will get ""nasty dirty"" because no one is in there dirtying the place up, so it will gently cycle over the next several weeks, ammonia will go up and then come back down, then nitrites will do the same thing. Eventually you should have none of either.   You should see a mini spike like that anytime you add livestock, particularly the first few additions.    Adding the bacteria just jumpstarts things, they will still need that time to establish a rhythm The prime false positive will only last a couple days,  1 Fish per 10 gallon is definitely a good rule. I have a 40 gallon, and I doubt I'll surpass 4 or 5 fish. (currently only 2 clownfish) That does not include scavengers. Scavengers I'd recommend 1-2 Nassarius Snails 1-2 Mexican Turbo Snails (more if you go with the smaller asteria snails) 2-3 blue legged hermit crabs. Anemones and corals are more sensitive to water changes than the fish (barring some very picky fish, which you should not start with anyway) so putting the fish in and letting things balance out first is best.     The easy thing to look for is the phrase ""established tank' in the description of something, that doesn't mean cycled, everything needs the water to be cycled. Established means everything has been balanced against fluctuations for close to a year, so do not plan to put in anything described as ""doing well in an established aquarium""   The more surface area the bacteria have to grow on, the better. Imagine your rocks and sand as sponges or filters, literally pulling the junk out of the water and changing it into something else. The more surface area to react to the waste, the better.  Ditch the filter. The rocks are your primary filter, the problem is, the bacteria will turn Ammonia > Nitrite > Nitrate.  Nitrates will eventually need to be pulled out.  Filters allow for this process to take place in a confined spot, and will cause it to constantly be reintroduced to the water, like washing your dishes with a dirty sponge.  The fish and clean up crew don't care about what kind of lights you have as long as they get something resembling a day and night cycle (nobody likes sleeping with the lights on). Algae and bacteria will take as much light as it can get but will be fine with the normal light  Anemones and coral will require special, high powered light to be healthy and grow, barring some species who are food dependent. Keep the heater on, The bacteria need the heat to grow. They actually like more heat if you have nothing else in there, up to 85 will make them really happy, though you will want to lower that before any fish are introduced.  The bacteria bottle wants to not get any colonies of bacteria filtered out until they have settled onto a rock or sand. The biowheel should just go away, What I would try to find to go in its place is a HOB (hang-on-back) skimmer. The return from it will help disturb the surface of your water. you will also want a small powerhead or pump to move water around the tank.    Things you didn't discuss:  Water: Are you using RO/DI water? Tap water will make all of this much more difficult. It's okay for your first batch (it will actually make keeping the pH up much easier early on. But you will want to start using RO/DI water for top offs and water changes. If you don't want to invest in a machine (~$120) you can usually purchase RO/DI water at your local fish store (LFS). At only 20 gallons, that might be more economical really.   The reason is, your tap water has phosphates, these are nutrients that are important to algae growth. You will have algae everywhere if you do not limit phosphates."

ReefTank,3adf79,CerealAndCartoons,5,Fri Jun 19 05:35:28 2015 UTC,Did you watch them bag it? Looks possibly dropped hard or on freshly bleached floor. Also that is where your finger could rest if hand catching so perhaps a chemical burn by whomever caught it. Or if the net was put in something nasty.   Bottom line no disease is going to go from zero to that in a few hours. That is definitely trauma of some kind.
ReefTank,3adf79,rmlynn,4,Fri Jun 19 07:18:04 2015 UTC,"I could see the possibility of an employee grabbing the fish in that area. Looks like a perfect thumb mark. Only reason I give that any weight is because I have no idea what else would cause the death of a healthy fish within a few hours if the fish seemed healthy beforehand. I would have recommended a little more time in acclimation, but I don't think that is what caused this death at all. From your post, sounds as if you know what you're doing. So yeah, conspiracy theories are my only option now."

ReefTank,3adf79,bryanfuel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:52:23 2015 UTC,Why would touching the fish with your thumb cause that though?
ReefTank,3adf79,rmlynn,2,Sat Jun 20 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"To me, it just looks like internal hemorrhaging. Like pockets of blood revealing themselves on the surface.  Especially if this showed up in only a few hours.  I would assume OP would have seen these red splotches on him at the store.  So I don't really have a clue.  Just looks to me like some kind of trauma. Hell, maybe he swam into a rock structure, like newly introduced blue-hippo tangs commonly do, and the rocks were a little unstable causing a piece to fall right on its back end.  That ridiculous conclusion holds just as much weight as the thumb conspiracy-- especially onsidering that both ideas were quickly pulled out of my ass."
ReefTank,3adf79,bryanfuel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:28:12 2015 UTC,"I think the rock explanation makes more sense to me. I work at an LFS and have touched fish with my hands before and nothing bad ever happens. (I did accidentally drop a yellow tang before, but he was okay....) Although I do see our hippo tangs always trying to get under rocks so I could see that happening."
ReefTank,3afmox,otp1144,2,Fri Jun 19 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"Not a good idea, they clog way too quickly. You are trying to put ductape over the problem instead of fixing it.  Your problem is backflow. If you have a backflow problem, consider re-plumbing your sump and return pipe instead. Put it closer to the surface. If you are worried about flow, get more powerheads for circulation in your display tank, don't rely on your return for all of your flow."

ReefTank,3afmox,MegaMeatSlapper85,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking of plumbing one into my 375 return line as well. I have a similar issue with my sump. Whenever the pump goes off water gets sucked back into the sump and overflows it. Fortunately my returns aren't as far below the water line as yours. If you're worried about reduced flow, why not just plumb in a larger check valve than your return line? It'll take some extra pieces, but then you won't have to worry about it impeding flow. That's my project for the next time I'm home at least. I'll let you know how it goes if I find time to work on it."
ReefTank,3afmox,Space-Commander,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"I had a check valve installed it got super noisy after a while, bad experience. I went with drilling a few small holes in my return line just below the water line in the tank, actually mine are just above the water line. That way if power goes out ( or actually every time I feed them I turn off the return) the water only siphons until the holes I drilled start sucking air and it breaks the siphon."
ReefTank,3afmox,Space-Commander,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:20:02 2015 UTC,"i've actually got siphon breaks, but they just don't work well because the holes are too small (i think) and i'm afraid of making them bigger. But it seems that really is the better option"

They are drilled in an angel so the water coming out goes into the tank. But that way the siphon break starts right when the return pump is turned off and the only water going into my sump is what is in the pipes."
ReefTank,3afmox,Fishy-Business,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"That's what the current ones do, but they're in the overflow. So the water spurts out in to there instead of the main tank. But I'll try and make them a bit bigger and see if that helps"

They work good but the best way to prevent backflow is to still keep your return lines close to the surface so the air breaks the siphon. I got mine from bulkreefsupply.com, and mine are unions as well, so if I ever have an issue with them, I can pull them out and clean them or replace them. If you're going to use check valves, I highly suggest going this route.  To find one local, you'll need to find a good fish store, particularly a local reef shop. They have a higher chance of having these types of parts."
ReefTank,3afmox,lamb_ch0p,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:57:51 2015 UTC,I've never seen a threaded check valve. Also I got mine at the lfs. Make sure you clean your check valve so that it won't clog.

ReefTank,3aauss,DrTrout,2,Thu Jun 18 16:48:40 2015 UTC,You can place a fan that blows over the top of the water to help cool it. You will have to top off a lot more frequent though. If you are worried about the temperature. That sucks about your clown though. Did you get any pictures of the fins? Does the water temperature fluctuate a lot? Have you ever taken a temperature reading in the middle of the night? I doubt that's the cause anyways since corals would be more sensitive to temperature swings then fish.
