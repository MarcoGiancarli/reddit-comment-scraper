ETA: the vertical menu sucks and is confusing unless you are a veteran user or (like me) are new but know to look for tips/help on forums like this. i would offer to post screen caps but now i am worried i wasn't even supposed to write this. i did not know this was a secret or a test run. it doesnt say anything of the sort when my bf logs in...

SwagBucks,3e1b5v,snattiebabe,14,Tue Jul 21 04:50:56 2015 UTC,"Well, first thing you need to realize is that it's not free money.  You're spending your time which is (or at least should be) worth something.  It is time you could be spending on other more lucrative money-making activities.  Obviously very few people want to be working dawn to dusk, but the point is that one could if one wanted to (especially for those with certain skill sets).  Swagbucks is never going to pay even minimum wage rates, but the trade-off that makes it worthwhile for many people is that there are many semi-passive activities that can be done while working, watching tv, reading a book, or taking care of kids without significantly affecting the quality of those activities.  Bottom line, value your time at least a little, and if you can't make Swagbucks even give you the below minimum wage payout, then I would say move-on to greener pastures.  I too wish that surveys and offers credited much more consistently, that surveys didn't do shady things to disqualify you, that certain old Swagbucks features weren't nerfed, etc.  However I doubt we'll see significant change so long as there are people that view it as free money and accept any new curve-ball thrown at them as normal."

SwagBucks,3e1b5v,newark02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:34:11 2015 UTC,Microeconomics was the first class I learned that concept and quite the amazing concept it is especially since it relates almost endlessly throughout each day.
SwagBucks,3e1b5v,Garwald,5,Wed Jul 22 01:15:44 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, about how many of the activities are pretty passive.  I do a lot the encrave on auto and wait a little and switch to tvswag to do another video while watching movies.   This is working out because I've been going over a lot of my DVDs to see what I want to keep, or watch what I haven't seen in ages.  The surveys are a pain.  I don't mind getting DQ'ed but it does suck when I get 4 minutes in before it happens.  I tend to look at it more like a video game then earning money.  My goal is to get the first daily, then 200 points a day.  If it's the weekend I'll try and get the 2nd daily, but if I don't feel like it i'll at least work on the getting 200 a day.   It's just a time wasting activity that leads to some money.  The daily bonus is very nice, as is getting a 100 point survey.   But I don't stress much about it.    If I was really concerned about making better money I'd get a second job.  SB is something I can do at home in my sweats while watching a movie."
SwagBucks,3e1b5v,HungryScott,7,Tue Jul 21 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"If your internet drops out during the ngage, it definitely won't credit (I learned the hard way during a spotty time).  With Swagbucks, I've gotten to the point where I avoid things I know don't always credit - Peanut Labs I'll only do the $1 offers, or anything posted here that is one or two step. Surveys, I have basically stopped doing, it's not worth my time - I stick with the apps on autopilot (never updated yet) and ngage/jungroup for the most part and make my $2 a day."
SwagBucks,3e1b5v,iwillnoteatgreeneggs,13,Tue Jul 21 04:57:41 2015 UTC,"It's not free money.  You're tying up your computer and using bandwidth and giving your time to perform these tasks.  Frankly, since July 1st they seem to be testing the limits of their users.    My rule of thumb for Swagbucks is if I'm paying using more than 10 percent of my attention on their site, then that's far too much.  Swagbucks real benefit is that you can watch TV or play video games, just be in the vicinity of your computer, etc, while  'enjoying their great content'.  But if you're actually forced to pay attention and have your computer tied up, and want to make money online then you might as well try Mturk.  If you set the bar low you can easily do 10 bucks(1000 SB) for around two hours work.  But I don't do that, again that's like work in a third world country.  And I'd really feel low if I was devoting my full attention to Swagbucks for even a 4 bucks a day,(which is pretty good for swagbucks)  I think children in work camps in the 1900s got paid more than that.  But it's tolerable if you're playing Arkham Knight and spending a few seconds while entering a capcha, clicking on a new encrave, new video, etc on one or two of your available computer screens.(along with some of their phone apps.)   But again it's taking up your computer and bandwidth and they are branding their ads.  Right now Swagbucks is more like a game.  I just want to get my minimum points and make my first goal, continue my streak.  In the end it's just 3 dollars, but it's not, it's 300 swagbucks."
SwagBucks,3e1b5v,ZZ232,4,Tue Jul 21 09:33:10 2015 UTC,"I wish I could use mturk. They banned me while I was on holiday last December because I couldn't provide verification in time, while the information they requested was locked in a safe in another state.

With the aps being limited, and Jun being scarce, I'm really annoyed. It's July and advertising is down a bit around now so some of this I understand, but the glitches (or whatever is up with nGage/Encrave) is what is really frustrating me.

Once I finish the minimum that I do on the Swagbucks site I use my PC for mTurk.  I can make more in 20 minutes on Turk than I could running encraves all day."
SwagBucks,3e1b5v,hb122,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:43 2015 UTC,For Perk TV the conversion rate is 1000 points for $1 as opposed to 100 SB's = $1. That's why i quit Perk.  And all I do is SB videos (SBTV and Entertainmentnow). I haven't tried Turk but I just assume I wouldn't qualify for anything.
SwagBucks,3e1b5v,ibeatoffconstantly,4,Tue Jul 21 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, you earn on Perk faster so the conversion rate really doesn't matter to me.  Plus they just released their Discover debit card where you can load your earnings directly onto it and it credits instantly, no more waiting for M/W/F redemptions.  Turk is a lot different.  If you search 'survey' on their search bar it'll pull up all of the surveys that you qualify for.  They don't DQ you at the end of them and they pay unless the answers are obviously crap.  The only downside to Turk is that some of the requesters can be a little slow to credit your pay, but you can also deposit your earnings directly into your checking account (or take your earnings in Amazon credits).  There's a good Turk sub here with lots of tips on maximizing your earnings."

Just space your searches by a minute apart. Search terms do not matter. Search windows have not applied in the last few days nor it seems the time between search wins.

The actual search term is irrelevant to winning AFAIK. If you want to see the silly terms people use look at the Swagbucks/Facebook posts on what got them a win. Usually total nonsense phrases. Wins are all about search windows when they are in effect (not today) and keeping your searches at least a minute apart and keep going until you win. It can take 15-20 searches to get a win at times.

When im actually wanting to search for something, seems that atleast 40% of the time or more now the search does not actually display any results.. which makes it basically useless to perform real searches on. :(  On the positive, it does not need to display results to win.. won last night when it didnt display any results."

SwagBucks,3e2gbc,Fredelas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"No, I couldn't find it on the homepage tiles either. From the home page ""Earn from special offers"" section, I clicked View All. From there I had to scroll down and hit the load more button a few times before I could find it."
SwagBucks,3e2gbc,Fredelas,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"Are you using the ""new"" Swagbucks site where the home page is divided vertically into categories, with tiles that scroll sideways? (I'm not, and I have nothing that says ""Earn from special offers"" on the home page.)  Edit: It just hadn't appeared on my home page yet when I checked earlier. For those of us using the ""old"" site, sort by Lowest Payout and the tile should appear near the top. I only got 7 SB from it before it ran out today.  When the Volume 11 offers are available, I always do them AFTER I've run out of JunGroup activities. Doing them at the same time sometimes causes problems with them crediting."

This is my thought process on Mercury Magazine and obviously correct me if I'm wrong.  You know how on your front page, on SwagBucks you'll see like a  bunch of those offers for 150, there's maybe like 4-5 sometimes.  Don't do all of them, just do 1 at a time, wait a week and then do another one or sometimes I even wait 2 weeks.  I think when people start doing them all the time like everyday or every other day, that's when customer support says ""yo to much,"" and then wants e-mail confirmations and all of that crap.  Just do one a week or one every two weeks and then they won't need any ""confirmation e-mail"" or whatever."

Hello,  We understand that some members have had limited or no access to engage in video viewing on Swagbucks or Encrave sites in recent days.

SwagBucks,3dxm8i,Logofascinated,13,Mon Jul 20 11:13:57 2015 UTC,"Please please people - go into your browsers settings, and change the default settings for downloads. In Chrome, you go to settings, scroll down to advanced settings and under downloads check the box marked ""Ask where to save each file before downloading"" . By doing this nothing will automatically start downloading EVER. You'll get a box pop up prompting you to select where to download and actually have to hit save before it starts downloading.  This won't prevent sites from trying to phish you, but it will prevent the automatic downloads from happening.   For anyone who says it then becomes a pain when you're legitimately downloading stuff - it's a single click OR you can just hit enter on your keyboard. The few seconds it takes even over the rest of your life is probably still going to be less than you'd spend trying to clean up ONE virus infestation."

SwagBucks,3dxvno,ZeSandvichMann,3,Mon Jul 20 12:54:54 2015 UTC,Encrave is not coming up this morning for me. So it is possible that maybe it is on their end today. I have nothing under mine just the white screen.
SwagBucks,3dxvno,audman1,2,Mon Jul 20 13:21:47 2015 UTC,Ad blockers do this.
SwagBucks,3dxvno,frosted1030,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:05 2015 UTC,Well I do not have any installed though. I am getting there are none available message lately though. It was working beautifully this weekend. I think they just ran out of ads or just see us as doing it too much maybe? Who knows. it still is not there for me.
SwagBucks,3dxvno,audman1,2,Mon Jul 20 14:24:17 2015 UTC,Daily crave is coming up unavailable too. all the other stuff seems to work. Strange probably an outage.
SwagBucks,3dxvno,audman1,2,Mon Jul 20 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"Really weird how some are unaffected by this and some are. As stated before, my desktop shows encrave just fine but my laptop doesn't show anything."
SwagBucks,3dxvno,RathaWynter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"Encrave was not working for myself or a friend last night. I managed to fix my issues with it in Firefox 34 by going into Tools > Options > Privacy Tab > Use Custom Settings for History > Accept 3rd party cookies from ""Always""  No amount of clearing cache, cookies, logging in and out, refreshing the page, rebooting, restarting browser, or anything like that solved it for me until i changed cookies to always. Friend said that it didnt fix his problem however, but im not sure if he cleared his old cookies either as maybe there was a corrupted one in there. It seems that once the proper cookie is downloaded, you can maybe set 3rd party cookies back to ""From Visited.""  As long as i had it set to 'always' Encrave would work just fine. But as soon as i set it to 'from visited' and cleared my cookies, then the page would be blank every time. Before then i had always used 'from visited' and it had always worked fine for me. Possibly just a fluke, but i tested it 2-3 times, fixing and breaking it last night repeatedly until i was sure that was the solution for me. I've had this problem with facebook cookies in the past.. sometimes facebook apps wont work (woobox giveaway apps in particular) unless cookies are set to ""always"""
SwagBucks,3dxvno,yankees992013,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"i have tried all things above and no luck. for over 2 years my firefox settings has been the same. Every firefox update, i checked the settings and it has remained unchanged. i stongly doubt setting cookies always is the reason, i was on another website that has encraves, it didnt show up there too. i tried on 2 pcs, and one laptop, nothing so far."
SwagBucks,3dxvno,audman1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I am using Chrome. Had been fine through last night. Both browsers firefox and it are allowing cookies. So maybe I am getting forced into a holding position where i can't do anything but what they want me to. I did not upgrade anything only a reboot of the computers. Any ideas what could have changed?
SwagBucks,3dxvno,RathaWynter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"I can only guess that either the offer was not available in certain areas for awhile, or that they started using some sort of special cookie that couldnt be delivered under certain circumstances or that certain regions couldnt establish proper contact with its provider. I noticed that the encrave page was stuck trying to contact some site for about a minute before it would give up, forget which offhand, but can probably figure it out if its super important.  When it was broken for me last night on one computer, it was working just fine on another that already had encrave page open. The only impactful difference i could find was that cookie setting. Loosening the cookie restrictions (combined with clearing them?) seemed to resolve it for me. Friend says his is working again today when he couldnt get it working last night using my method. So.. maybe a regional thing? I find it odd that i was able to break/fix it reliably last night, but that he couldnt."

SwagBucks,3dyvh9,mamurakami,6,Mon Jul 20 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"Getting DQ'd a lot would not be a reason for banning you from Gold Surveys IMO. If I'm lucky, I qualify for 1 out of 30 Gold Surveys so am constantly being DQ most of the time before even getting to start a Gold Survey. As long as your survey data matches up with any profile data you shouldn't have any issues as far as I know. Don't know of any relationship between SBTV caps and surveys."
SwagBucks,3dyvh9,JohnDRX,5,Mon Jul 20 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"It could be if you're ""rushing"" by completing surveys before their estimated time repeatedly? I think that's one of the things they could mean by their reason for banning you. I just say this because it's not hard to do since most of the times are exaggerated anyways and going too fast is something they always warn you against doing. Other than that I have no idea why... unless you're lying?"
SwagBucks,3dyvh9,imtotallysurebro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:32 2015 UTC,guilty on both accounts but i wonder why i got banned from gold surveys now instead of before. it's weird because every other aspect of swagbucks is still available
SwagBucks,3dyvh9,imtotallysurebro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"That would be it, then. I guess it just took that long for them to realize the answers were inconsistent. As for the rest of the website, I'm assuming it's because you can't ""lie"" on the other parts (ngage, shop and earn, mobile apps and whatever else) really and swagbucks earns money when you do those too. Not 100% sure on that, just my best guess."
SwagBucks,3dyvh9,frosted1030,4,Tue Jul 21 05:04:24 2015 UTC,"No, I haven't gotten a gold survey in a while, but I'm not banned. I get DQed mostly because I live a healthy lifestyle and I'm not sick, that seems to make a huge difference."
SwagBucks,3dyvh9,lilylily_4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"I get DQed mostly because I live a healthy lifestyle and I'm not sick, that seems to make a huge difference.   Interesting. I get DQed alot too in Gold Surveys - but lately have been maxing out total goals with pet related surveys."
SwagBucks,3dyvh9,sylviandark,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"Surveys have red herring questions and if you are caught giving fake answers (they'll tell you to choose 4 and you'll choose 5 because you're not reading) you'll be banned from GS.  Also try to come close to the survey EST time. If it say it takes 20 minutes and you reach the end in 10, wait 5-10 minutes to do the classification questions (age,sex,education,etc)."

Do I need to click 'yes' for everything? I really don't want my email getting spammed. Is there a trick to it?  I'm talking about offers of course. I just don't understand what I need to do to get credited.
SwagBucks,3dvlp0,Im_Your_Turbo_Lover,3,Mon Jul 20 01:16:32 2015 UTC,"If you don't want spam, create another email address that you only use for offers. In order for those path offers to credit, you need to say yes 1-2 times per page until it credits.  Outlook has a pretty neat setting that allows you to create sub email addresses where the mail gets sent to a folder on the main account. You can use the sub addresses like real emails and delete them whenever you want without companies getting your main email's address."
SwagBucks,3dvlp0,wanderingscribe,4,Mon Jul 20 03:21:06 2015 UTC,"The most efficient way to earn Swagbucks (in terms of reward/time) is answering surveys. However, if you really enjoy answering surveys (including frequent disqualifications), you will find more lucrative rewards from other sites.  With Swagbucks, almost every survey is routed through two or three intermediate providers who, along with Swagbucks, each take a cut of the money along the way. With other sites, there are sometimes no intermediaries at all, which will dramatically increase your earning. I'd recommend checking out some of the related subreddits listed in the sidebar if you're interested."
SwagBucks,3dvlp0,Fredelas,5,Mon Jul 20 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"Having said that, it's also possible to combine multiple minimally-attentive and passive activities on Swagbucks to earn decent returns. When offers are available, I click through JunGroup, nGage, SBTV desktop, and Encraves while keeping an eye on mobile video apps. This provides a slow, but reliable trickle of Swagbucks over a period of a couple hours each day. There are enough seconds in between that I can check out a couple of one-click or sign-up offers as I go, and occasionally be credited for them, too."
SwagBucks,3dvlp0,Fredelas,2,Mon Jul 20 01:57:56 2015 UTC,"When I do engage, I'm new to swagging even though I opened my account years ago, but when I open it the window just reboots constantly.

SwagBucks,3dvlp0,duckduck_goose,2,Mon Jul 20 02:31:36 2015 UTC,Same thing happens to me with nGage. I have adblock on chrome and it constantly reboots even though I whitelisted it. I have to actually go into the extension settings and uncheck the enabled box by adblock in order for nGage to work properly.
SwagBucks,3dvlp0,viewtifulv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:50 2015 UTC,I have that done too but I guess having adblock on chrome at all is blocking it. I'll have to try Firefox or Safari!

SwagBucks,3dsqqe,scoutxo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:57:16 2015 UTC,"wait a gosh darn second.. you can use paypal for these offers? well, that is a horse of a different color! i see offers all the time worth a nice amount of swagbucks and they are for things i was already interested in doing/buying but i really dislike entering my CC info. this is a game changer! are there any other offers that accept paypal? do all of them, or just a few? holy moly, i am so excited about this!"
SwagBucks,3dsqqe,SkitNinjas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:17:30 2015 UTC,It depends on the offer.  A couple of the new money makers lately have included PayPal as a form of payment but 90% of these just accept CC.
SwagBucks,3dsqqe,wednesdayheartattack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:04 2015 UTC,"Did this when it was at 600.  Wish I would've waited! :)  Still waiting on the credit for the 600 though and did the offer a week and a half ago so it takes some time, just so you're aware."

SwagBucks,3dsqqe,Death78793,4,Sun Jul 19 03:12:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't risk it.  Think about if everyone just made up a new e-mail address to do an offer like this?  They'd go broke.  I say just do it once so that SwagBucks can keep giving us offers like these in the future.  Don't want to ruin a good thing.
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,ukfan515,5,Sat Jul 18 23:58:33 2015 UTC,I'm a little new to Swag Bucks so pardon me for my ignorance but how the hell do you make $450 in a month and a half?
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,KickinNick,2,Sun Jul 19 00:34:41 2015 UTC,Well I typically make between 5-7 dollars a day from surveys. On top of that I have several panels that I have gotten through swagbucks that help out as well. I have a   Disney panel-$10   Pizza panel-$6-10  Guitar panel-$10  Battery panel-$10  Car panel-$15  Movie panel-$5  Kramer(Just random question panel)-$7  Those are the ones I have gotten into that I am still part of. There were several others that have ended in the last few months as well.
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,duckduck_goose,2,Sun Jul 19 00:51:29 2015 UTC,I've been doing $2 to $5 a day on survey mode too. Good to know I too can build my swag that high :)  (I need a new computer) Also yay for gifting treats to your dog <3
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,Garwald,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:13:12 2015 UTC,A computer or a new bed will be my next big $ purchase other than school books. But yes the more surveys you do the more used to them you become. Surveys that say 20 minutes I can now typically do in 5-8. Also getting into panels if you qualify is another great way. A panel I forgot is my fruit of the loom one. Not only do they pay me 5 bucks a month minimum but I have gotten at least a half dozen free pairs of boxers to test too!
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,coolbeanss88,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:33 2015 UTC,So they pay you $5 a month to do what?
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,duckduck_goose,2,Sun Jul 19 02:14:15 2015 UTC,Take 2-3 surveys about what styles of underwear I like and tell them what I think of the ones they send me
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,coolbeanss88,2,Sun Jul 19 04:27:26 2015 UTC,I'd love to be part of an underwear panel. Even though it sounds creepy and almost like a teenage boys wet dream. As long as they don't ask for them back at the end it seems legit lol.
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,duckduck_goose,2,Mon Jul 20 10:12:45 2015 UTC,Ha ha I'd actually be into it too and I'm a girl :P

SwagBucks,3dsbt9,KickinNick,4,Sun Jul 19 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"Keep trying, don't lie. It will catch up to you and I'm pretty sure you can get banned for it. Take screenshots of survey numbers because if you get DQ'd at the very end you can send it to CS and get credit most of the time. That's really it, just try a bunch at different times during the day (refresh the page a lot too so you can get them before they hit quota) if you can and accept the fact you're not going to qualify for every single one of them, no one does."
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,imtotallysurebro,3,Sun Jul 19 04:06:48 2015 UTC,This is the best description I have ever read it is accurate and brutally truthful

SwagBucks,3dsbt9,Lords32,2,Sun Jul 19 00:52:36 2015 UTC,I just do lots of surveys. I got into swagbucks 8 months ago and have cleared close to 3000 bucks in that span. The more surveys you do the more panels you'll get which pay like 10 bucks a month for just 3-4 surveys
SwagBucks,3dsbt9,metalfacedave,2,Sun Jul 19 01:33:24 2015 UTC,In 1.5 months and you're able to get $429 worth of Swagbucks?  That's impressive.  Congrats.

SwagBucks,3dsjul,SethR0gen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:44 2015 UTC,I'm also having a problem getting a third win.  I think it's a stealth search nerf that started yesterday.
SwagBucks,3dsjul,schizo01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"Didn't we have a swag code about a month ago about four wins a day? Seems weird to promote it then take it away without saying so. Especially in the middle of this collector's bills thing.  Then again, they did double how long we had to get them. Maybe they doubled the time because we get half as many wins a day now?"
SwagBucks,3dsjul,JohnDRX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:50:29 2015 UTC,Seems to be the case. Lot of posts on SB/Facebook saying no search trips today. Just finished trying my usually reliable way of getting a 3rd search win and nada.
SwagBucks,3dszfg,HungryScott,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think they had discounted ebay cards awhile back, if you use the search function, you should be able to find threads about that. Generally GC that are on sale are not very good (Restaurants.com......) So after you cash out your first $25 gift card every month it is generally up to you."
SwagBucks,3dszfg,EmployeeTK421,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:34:54 2015 UTC,"The eBay discount is the only good one I've seen in the past year, they have sales but they're generally stuff like charity gift cards or really targeted stuff you'd likely have no need for (and of course the ever-present Restaurants.com, which isn't really a gift card so much as a discount coupon)... IMO, you're best off cashing out as frequently as possible/needed beyond that first $25 every month."
SwagBucks,3dszfg,fookineejit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:43:47 2015 UTC,"Well damn, I hoped it was a common thing.  Oh well, not a big deal, I'd just be saving a few bucks with of points.   Thanks for the info."
SwagBucks,3dszfg,Hopalicious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:04 2015 UTC,Your first $25.00 card is discounted every month.  Saved up 2200 and cash it in. Then continue to save up 2200 sbs to cash in the first of the next month. Only use anything higher than 2200 during the month.

The reload icon in front of the URL entry box is an X (clocking) and seemingly never executes the search and the results section is just blank. After a few minutes a new search with a new tab will go through. I just assume the search engine is overloaded when this occurs.

Edit: I looked back through my ledger, and the birthday gift was awarded as a bonus (50 SB), not as a rebate toward redeeming a gift card."

The Special Offers promotion offers up to a 150 SB swagup rebate, and the birthday gift offers a swagup of 55 SB.  It'd be really inconvenient to have to redeem 3 separate giftcards just to get those small increments (assuming I even get all of them, of course, which did not happen for whatever reason during the Survey Soiree)."
SwagBucks,3dpiof,Fredelas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"If you typically redeem a $25 gift card for 2200 SB each month, I'd suggest waiting until after August 3rd (when the Swagcation rebate takes effect) to redeem it. Then you can see how many of the rebates are awarded afterwards, and adjust your remaining redemptions (if needed) appropriately.  Even if for some reason you didn't earn enough SB to redeem more gift cards in August, you'd still at least get the usual 300 SB off the $25 card, which is still more valuable than the remaining rebates combined."

SwagBucks,3dkenv,Tyoung916,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"If you like Mturk, and don't mind batch hits, I suggest signing up for UHRS at www.clickworker.com since they have a lot of batch, many of them paying well. I did some that paid out $0.02, but made about $12 an hour in 2.5 hours. Others I always do when they come up, that pay about $10 an hour for me. Everyone does them at different speeds, so you may find others easier and others harder, but they mostly tend to deal with search engine optimization. Those $0.02 hits were concerning the new Cortana software Microsoft is putting out in Windows 10. I also do ones that have side by side comparisons of search sugggestions (when you type in a search, and the predicted results show up underneath, you pick which is better). Also, ad relevance queries, where you rate how relevant an ad search is to the search done by a user. They all tend to pay about $9-10 an hour. If you are good at search engine battles, where you rate side by side comparisons of two different search engines for the same search query, they can pay upwards of $12-15 an hour. Another popular category is the adult hits, where you rate how adult a page is (sexually). I don't do these, but see them talked about often on the UHRS forums on clickworker.com. Apparently a lot can click through them quickly, but they are NSFW.  Anyways, hope this helps you out. I just got a full time job, so I probably won't be on much in the near future, so maybe you can get a little more money on the side to fund whatever you need.  PS: I also learned what ""anal acrobats"" were when doing the $0.02 hits for Cortana. I couldn't resist Googling it. I wish I hadn't. I've found I have learned interesting tidbits of information pounding through these hits. I forgot, but another interesting batch of hits, that probably won't show up anymore, involved going through Enron emails and highlighting personal contact information and addresses. I assume they were going to make they available publicly and had to edit out those pieces of information before doing so."

SwagBucks,3dknl9,Moobyghost,20,Fri Jul 17 11:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'd like to call special attention to the image on that post.  Some of the tiles show sets of five videos, lasting 22 minutes, that reward 1 SB.  The quickest ones appear to be four videos, lasting 5 minutes, that reward 1 SB.  Compare this to our current SBTV desktop, that reliably rewards 3 SB every 5 minutes.  It also looks like Encrave activities will bundled into the same category as the new Watch. I could previously do both activities at the same time. It looks like now I'll be limited to choosing one of them.  Edit: To ensure this is constructive feedback, and not just me complaining, I'd suggest rewarding users 1 SB per 2 minutes of playlist watched, rounded up. This would be similar to the rate we can currently earn."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Fredelas,3,Fri Jul 17 02:00:48 2015 UTC,I'm doubling down on tv desktop for a while in that case. Bleah
SwagBucks,3dknl9,duckduck_goose,3,Fri Jul 17 02:01:53 2015 UTC,If this is a feature meant to accompany the normal method then I actually think the payout on it is totally fair. Un-engaged people just setting it to play do not deserve the same amount that people who are manually clicking through - and therefore paying some amount of attention - deserve.   If it's just a whole hog change though... well that's stupid. Why get rid of the people who are actually paying attention to go with auto plays?
SwagBucks,3dknl9,prettyevil,2,Fri Jul 17 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario, there will be the option to manually forward (kind of doubt that, since they're apparently going to credit by playlist rather than number of videos) or the playlists will have a Discover feature like Auto-Encraves (30sec per vid), in which case we'll be earning at 2/3rds the rate we did before with slightly less clicking, but a lot more hunting for unwatched playlists - especially if there are a ton of pages with only a handful of 1SB playlists per. Worst case, they require watching the full vids... Earning SB at a maximum of 1/3rd the previous rate (based on this image). Doubt there will be 150 5-minute playlists anyway, but even so that'd be  12h30m assuming no load lag or time spent searching versus 4h10m currently.  The average time of the 8 visible offers on the preview is 10.5 minutes (84min for 8SB), so extrapolating from that, going through them concurrently would take 26h15m to reach the 150 cap ($1.50)... Obviously I realize that most people don't do 150 and am putting things in those terms mainly to highlight the disparity between the current and upcoming configurations. This may net some casual/passive users a few extra SB they wouldn't have earned otherwise, but on the whole it looks like a shit sandwich."

SwagBucks,3dknl9,prettyevil,4,Fri Jul 17 14:01:42 2015 UTC,Wonder if you will still be able to manually click through them to speed things along?
SwagBucks,3dknl9,usablues,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:30:24 2015 UTC,"I am hoping for this. After all, engaged people (those who are clicking through manually) are paying attention. Setting it to autoplay guarantees people not paying attention to those precious ads.   Wouldn't keeping the old system (letting people who want to pay attention get a bigger reward) and introducing an additional system (don't pay attention, earn less) make the most business sense?   That might just be my wishful thinking though."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,prettyevil,3,Fri Jul 17 14:15:25 2015 UTC,"Considering I only used the SBTV desktop hardly ever, I might actually start using it with the autorun feature. Time will tell though, I just hope they get the android apps working correctly again here soon."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Tsukiyonocm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:54:34 2015 UTC,Me too!  Oh don't even get me started on the apps. The crashing is driving me insane.
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Tsukiyonocm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:56:05 2015 UTC,"Oddly mine arent even crashing that much, it just takes me it seems like 15 hours just to make SBTV, much less any of the other apps. I can usually only complete MAYBE 3 apps a day now."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Moobyghost,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:23:21 2015 UTC,You're right. They do seem fine today. But for the past week they've been crashing a lot and displaying that connection issue message.
SwagBucks,3dknl9,usablues,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:24:22 2015 UTC,"Garwald, why do they hate us? Every change since Jan has been bad, and it is getting worse. They keep taking shit away under the disguise of something ""new and different."""
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Moobyghost,2,Fri Jul 17 11:41:09 2015 UTC,Thing is that I will often do this on my android phone or tablet via the android chrome browser rather than the desktop/laptop/swagbutton.  I hope that I still can.
SwagBucks,3dknl9,prettyevil,6,Fri Jul 17 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"fuck this. First they take away Accelerator. Then the penny a day for the swagbutton. Then they fucked up the apps. Then they reduced what you can make from the apps. Then they took away Ngage and now they are going to reduce income on SB desktop. Fuck this shit. I am so pissed off at SB right now. Do they have their own Ellen Pao or something? Who is making their decisions lately? Do you want people to quit and badmouth your service? Cause that is how you get people to quit and tell everyone else to stay away from their fucking site. I am sick of this shit swag bucks. In less than a year you went from a decent company, to just another corporate douchebag of a site."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Shortpants,6,Fri Jul 17 11:24:52 2015 UTC,"They didn't 'take away' Ngage. Ngage comes and goes with the seasonal ad cycle. It was disappeared during January and most of February as well. Advertisers aren't paying to be on Ngage right now then Ngage has nothing to offer SB then SB has nothing to offer us on it.   And we don't really know all the word about SBTV yet. It looks like shite, but we don't know if this will be replacing, or accompanying, the current method. If it's accompanying then there's nothing to complain about."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Tired8281,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:27 2015 UTC,Will this replace the normal way now? Or will it be like the Encarves where there are normal click ones and play list ones?
SwagBucks,3dknl9,SporeSpam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this is a way to turn SBTV into Encrave, and thus take it away from Canada, UK, and Australia."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Brandonhacks,2,Fri Jul 17 21:27:49 2015 UTC,I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Fredelas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:17 2015 UTC,Sounds great except these playlist are most likely extremely short and requires you to click a new playlist every 10-15 minutes to continue the auto play. Much like encrave is now.
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Fredelas,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"We'll have to wait and see, but it's an improvement none-the-less!"
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Moobyghost,14,Fri Jul 17 01:26:51 2015 UTC,Earning 3x less (at best) is not an improvement.
SwagBucks,3dknl9,JesusFreakNW,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:39 2015 UTC,Well I don't use Swagbucks TV Desktop currently but once this update happens now I will. So it is an improvement for me I suppose!
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Fredelas,6,Fri Jul 17 02:21:14 2015 UTC,"That's a valid point. People who previously used SBTV desktop will earn less, but people who didn't use it will earn more.  You're welcome, I guess. Enjoy the SB I was perfectly happy clicking for before."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,JesusFreakNW,0,Fri Jul 17 02:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fuck those loyal users /s"
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Fredelas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's a UI improvement however.  Less work to earn the SB, no need to click new videos is helpful.  As long as it doesn't require the mouse to be over the active window to flow, like the auto encraves do, I'm down for it. I don't do SBTV web often because it's more work than it's worth for me personally.  If I actually do it, even the reduced point payout makes it worth more to me."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,JesusFreakNW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"From the picture, this looks like it will replace the auto-Encraves."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,shatranjkakhiladi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, that page is video focused, so a lot isn't shown.  tho it does have the nCrave listed, but that's also spelled differently (Which owuld lead to confusion if the Encraves stay.  If you look at the new ""Offers"" page, there is a ""Content Discovery"" which is what nGage, JunGroup and Encraves have been considered thus far I believe."
SwagBucks,3dknl9,Hopalicious,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, without knowing more, I'd guess that ""Watch"" would be the passive activities, whereas ""Discover"" would be the ones we have to click through."
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,scoutxo,3,Fri Jul 17 16:12:17 2015 UTC,That's insane
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,dumbassniggashit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"i thought so too, which is why i got trigger happy and clicked on it instantly. had it said that the survey was mobile only or in-store only, i would have waited to click it.  apparently i have absolutely zero impulse control unless warned. :/"
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,ceildric,3,Fri Jul 17 16:34:31 2015 UTC,Surveys need only a limited number of participants.  Probably others filled it up.
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,ceildric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"oh, bummer. thanks for answering though, i appreciate it.  so i should just mourn the loss? there is no time a survey ever disappears and then shows up again later? i wish it had said on the page that the survey was mobile only or in-store or something, i would have waited to open it! :("
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,colafrank,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:15 2015 UTC,"I think I've seen surveys show back up on occasion (maybe someone else disqualifies or the survey maker decides they want another batch), though I would not count on it.  Probably would be best to just mourn the loss and hope for something similar to pop up again in the future."
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,joestrummer77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am not going to hold my breath, but I am going to hold out a little hope for next week. Thanks for replying, I was unsure if any surveys ever came back up. :)"
SwagBucks,3dmz4d,nessiebo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:29:47 2015 UTC,It's showing up for me right now. Go to your inbox and they should've sent a link to the survey there. Question for your. HOw do you even do surveys via mobile?
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,Expired_Bacon,10,Fri Jul 17 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"I've emailed them, but I'm waiting on a response. Lets be patient and not summon /u/swagbucks, /u/swagbucksadmin, or /u/Swaggodore to politely ask them to respond to my email. Oops:P"
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,crystalwindow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:19:49 2015 UTC,I just found this reddit even thou I have been using swag bucks for a while so I just subscribed.

SwagBucks,3dl0lk,jjharkan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:56:41 2015 UTC,What does subscribing do?  Will I become the next one?
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,prettyevil,2,Fri Jul 17 13:25:42 2015 UTC,It puts the subscribed boards onto your homepage and top bar. Quite convenient for navigating around multiple subs or just viewing your homepage to see all the threads from all the subs you care about at once.
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,jjharkan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know where my homepage is, nor the top bar.  There's a line of different subreddits along the top, but the three I'm subscribed to are not there.  Reddit.com contains posts from everything, but nothing I'm subscribed to"
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,prettyevil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:07:09 2015 UTC,Reddit automatically subscribes you to the most popular subs. Which is an annoyance for people who don't care about those subs. If you remove them all it will indeed show only the ones you are subscribed to.   Reddit.com also contains posts from everything because you are subscribed to the 'helpfully' pre-assigned subs.
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,jjharkan,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude, looks like I've got crap to unsubscribe from!"
SwagBucks,3dl0lk,prettyevil,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:48 2015 UTC,No problem. Enjoy your soon-to-be cleaned up top bar and homepage. It'll look a million times better.

SwagBucks,3dknzy,axel_val,2,Fri Jul 17 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"When the challenge begins, you go to the page and it automatically assigns you to a team."
SwagBucks,3dknzy,Fredelas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:14 2015 UTC,Thanks!
SwagBucks,3dknzy,axel_val,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think in previous team challenges, the participants on losing teams were more likely to give up as soon as they contributed the minimum when it became apparent they'd never catch up.  With an increased minimum contribution, increased reward for contribution, and decreased rewards for winning, perhaps more people will participate for longer this time, thus earning Swagbucks more revenue."
SwagBucks,3dknzy,Fredelas,2,Fri Jul 17 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"No, it will have the exact opposite effect.  Decreased rewards for winning means there's even less incentive for contributing more than the minimum and trying to fight for a win."
SwagBucks,3dknzy,ceildric,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"The competitive earners will probably still contribute as much as they always did. Those people who racked up 50,000 points on their own didn't really care about the 50 SB difference between winning and losing.  Meanwhile, the slackers will contribute twice as much as before just to hit the minimum."
