So it's not saying libertarian vs populist, it's social liberty and economic liberty as the axes and you get put into one of the boxes (libertarian, populist, left liberal, moderate, or social conservative).   Note how, right or wrong, the terminology used for the different sectors are terms used mainly in libertarian contexts, as ""left liberal"" distinguishes them from the ""economic liberalism"" of libertarians, and the ""social conservative"" labed distinguishes them from the individualized social liberties espoused by libertarians"

dataisugly,3ckfhj,xangg,2,Wed Jul 8 21:53:10 2015 UTC,I never understood using bars on a log scale. Length is a prominent part of a bar but has no good meaning here. 2x bar lengths means ...?
dataisugly,3ckfhj,antonfire,2,Sat Jul 11 17:59:05 2015 UTC,"If you double the bar length on a log scale, it corresponds to squaring the quantity. Often this doesn't make much sense, but there are also plenty of times when it does.  For instance, if you plot survival probabilities on a log scale (so longer bars are smaller probabilities), the probability of something surviving two equally risky events has a bar that's twice as long as that of the probability for just one of those events.  Basically, bars often make sense additively because 0 is often a meaningful figure, so it makes sense to draw a bar whose length corresponds to the additive change from 0 to your quantity. The same thing makes sense with bars on a log scale. If 1 is a meaningful figure, it often makes sense to draw a bar whose length corresponds to the multiplicative change from 1 to your quantity.  Hell, there are also plenty of cases where 0 isn't all that meaningful. Do you find bar plots of temperatures in Fahrenheit objectionable? It doesn't bother me too much, as long as you keep in mind that it doesn't make sense to start stacking bars in that context or whatever."
dataisugly,3ckfhj,xangg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:11:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I tend to stay away from bars for temperature for that reason, but I'm OK with using a semantic 0 for bars in general. That is, the bar length is showing deviation from some meaningful baseline.  Thanks for the survival example -- I'll keep an eye out for similar cases."

dataisugly,3ckfhj,llimllib,5,Wed Jul 8 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Well, not really. More marijuana = more opportunities for dogs to consume said marijuana."
dataisugly,3ckfhj,Nomeru,11,Wed Jul 8 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"Right, though this graph suggests that exponentially increasing marijuana use is not correlated with exponentially increasing marijuana toxicity in dogs.  In 2008, there were ~15 reported incidences of dog toxicities, versus ~43 in 2010, despite more than an order of magnitude more medical marijuana registrations."

dataisugly,3cfpt2,celestial1,24,Tue Jul 7 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain why this is ugly? I mean, yeah, both lines demonstrate the same information, but presenting it this way allows us to see how the populations are expected to have linearly and exactly switched between 1950 and 2050. I thought it was easy to read and interesting."
dataisugly,3cfpt2,Domer2012,28,Tue Jul 7 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"For one thing, the x-axis isn't evenly scaled. The crossing point is 2010, and this graph makes it look at though that is equally far from 1950 and 2050. The time increment is usually 10 years but in one case (1950-700) it is 20 years."

dataisugly,3cfpt2,lostsemicolon,13,Wed Jul 8 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"In addition to the x-axis (which actually has two skips), the terribly unnecessary and busy shading is ugly.  What do yellow men on a green background mean?  Nothing, it's useless visual noise, and it doesn't even go all the way down to the 0 axis.  Either leave the shading off completely, or shade with the colors and blend the two in the middle, and if you must, put some faint people outlines for pizzazz.  But in the overlap, certainly don't just pick one of the two legend colors and then add highlights of a third color!  Color-wise, it looks like rural population completely disappears in 2010.  Really for data like this though, either leave out the shaded areas, or stack them - you don't get the fun lines with arrows, but you do get the green taking over and the blue diminishing, and less visual confusion.  Also, as /u/dimdat pointed out, the value of having two lines that always sum to 100 is questionable - one line is completely extraneous as far as expressing the data.  Better to stack and shade.  Also, while it's close, the data is not actually a straight line - especially if you cut out 1960 and 1980, I bet.  Here's a chart of the actual data, courtesy Wikipedia, btw."
