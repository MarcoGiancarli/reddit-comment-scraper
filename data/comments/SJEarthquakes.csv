SJEarthquakes,3e5vwv,DrDrewJohnson,5,Wed Jul 22 05:25:56 2015 UTC,It was a fun game to watch and I enjoyed it despite the loss. I love the young core this team is building. This FO is actually thinking ahead and makes me hopeful about a potential USL Pro team in the near future.

Trying a new format for the post match thread, copy and pasting from the match thread and adding a highlights section for any...highlights.   Does this make the thread better for anyone?

SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,SomeCruzDude,2,Tue Jul 21 21:03:37 2015 UTC,No injuries and no embarrassment. Or maybe an embarrassment so we don't have to put up with this shit again. I'm really glad the Quakes fans (relatively) took a stand by failing to buy tickets to this game. Hopefully the FO sees that this was a waste of everyones time.
SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,DrDrewJohnson,2,Wed Jul 22 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"Here's my question. As a fan, what result do you want from today's match? Do you care if we win or draw? Or are you the type that wants to see us field out the Colorado Rapids' reserves so we can rest our players?  Personally I'd be really happy with a draw since our club currently has an undefeated streak against EPL clubs going all the way back to the Clash days."
SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,oven_for_hire,4,Tue Jul 21 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like we should rest our main guys, but the thing is we forget that just about every guy on our starting XI wants to have a crack at Man U from their own personal standpoints, but in reality it is only a friendly. I guarantee Marvell, Shea, Clarence, MPG, and Fatai are all dying to go against Rooney and Co.  So I do think our guys who get regular minutes should get to play because a game like this (against a team that has as much skill and experience as Man U), would teach them a lot. I'd like to see the players on the field get competitive and fully invested in going for a win, but maybe have most of our guys for the Vancouver game be brought on sometime in the second half. We should start a team of reserves and subs, but maybe lets see Bingham start, he can learn a lot from strikers and mids that will punish him for the slightest mistake.  edit: And yes, we should give Pelosi a go. Best to give him his first exposure in a friendly."
SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,t_l_m,5,Tue Jul 21 21:25:18 2015 UTC,but the thing is we forget that just about every guy on our starting XI wants to have a crack at Man U from their own personal standpoints   Man...never thought of it that way.
SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,Arjen_01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:48 2015 UTC,I hope we play Starting Guys for the first half then the B Team for the second half. Gives everyone a chance to play but gives plenty of time to rest for the real games.

SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,bobby_guz_man,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The Quakes cannot afford to allow a fluke outcome against Man U to fill them with overconfidence, or to bolster the belief that no further work need be done in the overhaul of the roster.   We're just over the halfway mark in the season, on a slide, and playing below .500 ball. If we want into the playoffs, we'd better improve on our first half record.  And regarding the rebuilding process, remaking the Quakes into a championship team is a long term project that's not even 50% complete. No one should be letting off the gas in the rebuilding of this team."
SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,Squeakopotamus,2,Tue Jul 21 21:57:45 2015 UTC,"Agree with the rebuilding, I hope we continue seeing new trades and signings, we need as much talent as possible from wherever we can. Hopefully Doyle lets Dom take control and build what he wants."

Can I pay for parking with a credit card or do I need to hit up an ATM before going to the stadium tonight?
SJEarthquakes,3e49o8,Squeakopotamus,3,Tue Jul 21 21:56:27 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they take cards.

The first ever MLS game was at Spartan Stadium in SJ with a Quakes 1-0 win (goal by Eric Wynalda).  We have a few exciting prospects in Tommy Thompson who's a extremely skillful player and part of the USA U20s, we just a signed a kid named Marc Pelosi who is part of the USA U23s and is coming from Liverpool.

SJEarthquakes,3e1qn6,SJSeismologist,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the group. Just to add to what others have already added regarding our club: we may not have the most skilled or deepest roster ever, but we are the team that can outwork you on any given night. We will never have the star power that LA has, but we know how to fight and in general we don't give up. One of the things that drew me to this team was the passion of the fans that support the team regardless of what is transpiring on the field.  I think most would agree that our new coach Dom Kinnear is one of the best tactician coaches in the league. Right now he is still trying to figure things out, with a limited roster no less. With the promising young talent coming up, there are definitely reasons to be excited. In the short-term, we might be kind of a rough ride. The coming weeks are vital for us to build momentum and try to make the playoffs."

As a Manchester United fan that sounds like an awesome deal. As a quakes fan disappointing they did offer a quakes or United jersey. Curious to see what the turn out will be at the stadium Tuesday   Just saw the event on Ticketmaster no more than 1-2k seats available

SJEarthquakes,3du773,pauleemath,9,Sun Jul 19 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. An inability to play out of the back, transition forward with short ground passes, maintain possession, and generate scores of shots on frame is a huge problem. Our short pass game is atrociously bad.  For those who would advocate embracing a predominantly long ball approach, I would suggest that certain distinctions be made about the kinds of long balls that can be played, and exactly what kinds of long balls the Quakes play more often than not.  Some long balls are simply desperate clearances out of the back under pressure. Sometimes, when you are under siege, that is your only and best option to relieve pressure temporarily and to buy a few seconds of time to reset your defensive shape. Acceptable under the circumstance, though not preferable.  Some long balls are brilliant field switching crosses to a wide open wing on the opposite side of the pitch, exploiting a defensive hole that has developed as a result of an overload on one side. This is a good use of a long ball.  Some long balls are actually long balls sent over the top of an opposing defense playing a very high line at midfield, leading a run made by your own, lighting fast forward who can beat the defensive backs to the ball and race toward goal in a 1v1 or a 2v1 scoring opportunity against the opposing goalie. This is a good use of a long ball.  Aerial crosses into the 18 yard box from the wings toward your own central strikers is a kind of long ball. It stands a chance of being met by the head of your striker, but it stands an equal chance of being met by the head of an opposing defender, or being snatched out of the air by the goal keeper. It's a 50-50 ball that may be worth a shot every once in a while, but is not a replacement for actually playing into the 18 yard box and taking direct shots. This is an acceptable use of a long ball, though it should not constitute your only vector of attack. Otherwise you become too predictable and easy to shut down.  Goal kicks (after the opposing team has lost possession by sending a ball over the byline) that are sent long to a crowd of heads at midfield are horrible low-percentage plays. Winning and controlling such long balls is extremely difficult, and more often than not they are headed right back in the direction of goal keeper only for the opposing team to remount their attack. I can't stand this sort of long ball play. You've just won back possession as a result of the opposition kicking the ball over the byline and your response is to essentially yield possession right back with a low-percentage long ball from a goal kick. This is not a good use of a long ball.  Similarly, any long ball played forward to a crowd of heads (a hopeful long ball), where the chance to control and possess the ball is 50-50 or worse, is not a good use of long ball.  In summary, not all long ball plays are bad or poor decisions. You just need to reduce or eliminate the low-percentage plays, and learn to spot effective field switching opportunities to open wings, and goal scoring opportunities to swift forwards making runs in behind defenses playing a high line. Otherwise develop and stick with the foundation of a dominant pass-possession game full of successful short ground passes."
SJEarthquakes,3du773,Arjen_01,6,Sun Jul 19 21:21:09 2015 UTC,"Great write up.  It's the 50-50 long balls the Quakes are always employing which is ridiculous.  Especially with their lack of a true, strong and technical target forward."
SJEarthquakes,3du773,Arjen_01,4,Sun Jul 19 21:56:43 2015 UTC,Or exceptionally fast and technically gifted wings. You have to get to balls played over the top first.
SJEarthquakes,3du773,Injustice52,5,Sun Jul 19 22:30:38 2015 UTC,I think we struggle at possessing and we send to many long balls to compensate.
SJEarthquakes,3du773,ogfk,5,Sun Jul 19 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"if we obviously do not have the skill to possess like other teams in the league, wouldn't it make more sense to play a counter attacking/long ball system. imo that can actually be more fun to watch than tiki taka too."

There's plenty of strikers who can do the mop up duties that aren't in season.  Bobby Wood is a good example. The thing is Wondo will babysit younger players and change diapers. Wondo knows full well he wasn't called up for meaningful minutes.  He also knew his club team was playing critical games to decide playoffs or not. Knowing that, if he goes to sit on the bench instead of play important games, it's just down to greed for two paychecks at one time. I guess being greedy is very American; but even if Wondo has my respect for many things, he won't get it for this.  Cato on the other hand is playing meaningful minutes and belongs at the Gold Cup."

Not his fault he got injured and it's WAAAY too soon to be writing him off as a flop or overstaying his welcome. Not to mention how young he is (26 young in the MLS) he could be our main striker for many many years to come.
SJEarthquakes,3dsh80,Totaladdictgaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"maybe i wrote that wrong, but i didn't mean for it to sound like i was writing innocent off.  he's one of the ones i think they need to keep.  it's guys like jahn, sherrod, fucito that haven't looked like they are going to help the team much"
SJEarthquakes,3dsh80,DeepSlumps,5,Wed Jul 22 00:41:43 2015 UTC,I don't know. Can we send Bernardez and Pierrazi to RBNY for Miazga and Stolz? ;-)
SJEarthquakes,3dsh80,Arjen_01,2,Sun Jul 19 00:59:42 2015 UTC,"I doubt we do anything major this season. We have all heard that we are tight against the cap. Only way I see us doing something is if we are able to offload a big salary in a transfer or trade.   That said, I do think we will do something major this offseason. Our weakness is our midfield. We just can not possess the ball which kills our chance creation. So what do we do?  I expect/hope that we use Innocent as our left wing/mid next year with Wondo and maybe Quincy up top. Alas he is our CDM. To me, the next step is identifying if we can add either a good CAM and move MPG out to the right or do we add a DP level right mid?  A wildcard in that thought process is just how good is Pelosi? If he can take over the left mid spot, then we can move Innocent up top with Wondo. Maybe Pelosi is the CAM and MPG goes to the right. A ton depends on just how good and ready Pelosi is and I am in no position to suggest where or how he fits in."

It is kind of difficult when the game is on the other side of the field though. There is usually more people in the terrace when the quakes are attacking that goal. Not sure how that will be with Manchester United though - probably the opposite I bet.  One thing to be careful of is balls flying in during warm ups. I've seen lots of close calls so far, but luckily no one got wrecked yet. Just have to pay attention."

SJEarthquakes,3dpq2o,innocraft,5,Sat Jul 18 12:16:59 2015 UTC,anyone else think Goodson has been the unsung hero of the team this season? Should be vice-captain when Wondo is unavailable.
SJEarthquakes,3dpq2o,RunningFerDauyz,2,Sat Jul 18 22:18:16 2015 UTC,Bernardez has historically been a vice-captain and been here longer (93 regular season games for Muma vs 35 for Goodson) but I agree he'd be captain if Muma wasn't available.
SJEarthquakes,3dpq2o,SomeCruzDude,4,Sat Jul 18 22:31:26 2015 UTC,Gotta love Goodson.

SJEarthquakes,3dpq2o,lookuppage7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:26 2015 UTC,Totally got that vibe for a while too. I'm guessing it was a Watson thing because he's been playing great and looking like he really cares out there.

I ran into him at a Burlingame Dragons game on June 14th. We talked for a good 30 minutes. To keep it short, he said he absolutely wanted to come play in MLS, he missed home, and would love to play for the Quakes. I told him we needed a left mid and that Kinnear plays diamond for the most part, he said that's the exact position he prefers to play. It's been tough keeping the secret, but I'm glad it's over.

SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,Arjen_01,3,Sat Jul 18 02:41:40 2015 UTC,I guess the Quakes didn't want to leverage their allocation order spot against MLS interest in Julian Green.  Now I'll get to see what all the fuss over Pelosi is about.
SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,TalussAthner,3,Sat Jul 18 02:42:19 2015 UTC,I'll just say I was searching some Liverpool forums/fan sites before he got hurt and their (non-american) fans who'd seen him play with their reserves thought he was a future starter for them. We'll have to see how he's recovered from his injury.
SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,SomeCruzDude,3,Sat Jul 18 02:53:19 2015 UTC,His situation kinda mirrors Simon Dawkins.  Dawkins was in Tottenham's academy but then was dropped after dealing with injuries. Eventually the team signed him and loaned him out to SJ. The rest is history.

SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,QuakesBlue,-5,Sun Jul 19 00:00:12 2015 UTC,"Tonight's game may be what we ""paid"" for Pelosi. The MLS held the contract hostage until the Quakes brass agreed to let the game be fixed so Gerrard could shine in his debut.  No ref is that biased and that bad without doing it on purpose and he didn't show those colors until the Gals were losing badly....the signing of Pelosi timing is quite telling, as is MLS track record for things like this."

SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,rb604321,0,Sat Jul 18 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure your perspective is accurate and a bit too much of a conspiracy theory for me. However cannot help but have similar questions when you witness the recent shenanigans of the league. It does make you question everything. Crazy how they make things up halfway through the season to advantage certain teams, and believe fans throughout the league are just going to sit by and accept it. Also agree refereeing decisions in the league and especially tonight is awfully suspicious. Nuts how soft calls were made one sided tonight and at very convenient moments. Other sports leagues with greater overall integrity have been susceptible to officiating manipulation many times throughout history, so wouldn't completely surprise me if something fishy was going on. I think there is a need for greater accountability and transparency with regards to officiating in MLS (and soccer in general).  I know officiating is a tough job, but all the reason to improve the tools and mechanisms to simplify the job in order to remove as much doubt from the system as possible. It would be great to see MLS lead the world to a better model for officiating soccer matches, but obviously I'm not holding my breath."
SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,QuakesBlue,2,Sat Jul 18 06:34:28 2015 UTC,"Most of the refs for MLS are horrible and out of their depth...or too fat to even make it thru a match without mental exhaustion. But as bad as Salazar, Toledo & Chapman are, I don't think they can be bought. This is one of the scab refs though. In the old days when MLS wanted an outcome, they used Michael Kennedy. Now they have this guy. Personally, I wouldn't have thought Gerrard was special enough for this treatment but old habits die hard. What bugs me is some players think they played a legit game. Pretty gullible schmucks.  But no one will ever convince me this leauge is on the up and up. Alexi Lalas told me personally they took Donovan off the Quakes and orchestrated the move to the Galaxy for the good of the league. He was proud of doing that when he was GM of the Quakes.  In the long run, having Pelosi is probably going to be worth it I guess. But for teams on the bubble throwing games away carries considerable risk."

SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,rb604321,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"I begrudgingly have to admit some of your points are valid. Still like to think the Pelosi angle you mention at the top is a bit too much. I find myself close to pulling the plug on following MLS. I really want the league to succeed and spend a fair amount of $$ annually on MLS product for the past few years. I had tried to explain away some of the ugliness of years past as something the league had matured beyond. However the evolution of the past season is really making me question time and $$ being spent. I've been told several times by those close to me it is a corrupt league and waste of time to follow. This past season is beginning to move me towards the camp who believes the league has significant issues beyond repair. The league manipulation at mid-season and just the ref situation alone is really quite bad. One has to be a bit dense not to raise questions about an air of corruption running thru the league. You can point to a lot of serious officiating issues across many games every week, and nothing is done to address the problems in an open and public manner. I get tired of hearing officiating is tough, and teams just need to be better in an attempt to cover for the problems. Not the sign of a good organization which is serious about promoting healthy sporting competition and attempting to become a top notch league. It is bad when everyone begins to know names of officials as if they were important players on the field."
SJEarthquakes,3dp4cr,QuakesBlue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"Right, I have no proof MLS held up the contract for this particular reason. It may be just coincidence.

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,SomeCruzDude,20,Sat Jul 18 05:04:43 2015 UTC,"We officially have the worst luck with MLS referee roulette.

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,pbrrules22,6,Sat Jul 18 05:07:00 2015 UTC,everyone was making mistakes tonight pretty much except for mpg and amarikwa... once the ref called that bs pk against tommy the whole team collectively lost its head
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,MikeFive,6,Sat Jul 18 05:33:26 2015 UTC,"I mean I love that Amarikwa scored 2, but he should have had 3 easily.  There's no excuse for missing a 1v1 breakaway with the keeper.  If we're up 3-0 after 25 minutes, that game is significantly different even with the penalty and soft calls."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,pbrrules22,2,Sat Jul 18 16:47:31 2015 UTC,a 2 out of 3 strike rate on good scoring opportnities is a lot better than any of our other players aside from wondo!
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,MikeFive,3,Sat Jul 18 17:04:06 2015 UTC,"In a vacuum, yes, 2 of 3 is great.  In detail, though, not converting a 1v1 breakaway is pretty bad."

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,ozkazuo,13,Sat Jul 18 19:03:17 2015 UTC,Incredible what a bs penalty call can do to the flow of the game. Not really an excuse for completely shutting down afterwards though. Very frustrating tonight. Not too sure what we can do to fix it. Seemed like a lot of individual mistakes.   I'm optimistic about Quincy though. He seems much more versatile than Jahn and Sherrod.
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,QuakesBlue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:11:22 2015 UTC,I think I understand why they shut down and oddly I respect them for it. We were dominating the game. And then the bogus PK showed the players that wouldn't be allowed. And the Gerrard got to do a red card worthy tackle with no punishment. Andthe  players stopped playing a fixed match. MLS used to use Michael Kennedy when they fixed matches. Now they have strike scab Alan Kelly for that job.

I've been saying the Quakes should have a USL team in Salinas just about as long as I've been saying I want a NWSL team in SJ. The Timbers are doing both, so why can't we?  But I agree. Quakes should create a USL team before NWSL."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Quixoticelixer52,7,Sat Jul 18 05:26:48 2015 UTC,I want both. But knowing our FO... It's neither
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,dodeca_negative,3,Sat Jul 18 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"They've spoken about doing an NWSL team, but are waiting for the league to stabilize and increase in attendance (which makes sense tbh). As far as USL goes, haven't heard a comment on it in awhile. Why hasn't anyone asked Kaval?  Gotta really press for that AMA with him."

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Quakes98,8,Sat Jul 18 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"Not only did the midfield check out, our back line couldn't get the ball up to our forwards.  Every time(well, almost every time) we kicked a ball long, LA would head it back into our end."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,rb604321,10,Sat Jul 18 05:53:17 2015 UTC,"I hate the direction the MLS is going but Gerrard+Keane combo embarrassed us. Defending was not great, and while there was a lot of diving and poor refereeing we shouldn't have put ourselves in those positions in the first place."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Quakes98,9,Sat Jul 18 05:07:08 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder how the game would have turned out if the first PK was not given. We had the momentum and it was starting to look like LA wouldn't recover.  We were moving the ball really well and Quicny looked like he could easily have scored more as the game went on. Even TT was factoring into the attack well. The Galaxy up to that point looked sluggish and hadn't gotten comfortable yet. Gerrard looked lost at times.  But when you give the Galaxy and inch and they score, its like waking a sleeping; a giant that goes on to score 5 goals.  But with that said and the hypothetical situation not happening, of course you are going to lose when you defense decides not to show up in the second half."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,rb604321,7,Sat Jul 18 05:16:39 2015 UTC,"What was that referee doing? Every single time an earthquakes player made any contact at all with a galaxy player, a foul was called.  The quakes were already going to have enough trouble holding the ball and manufacturing chances, all the fouls and free kicks in the second half ruined any chance they had at establishing rhythm"

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Arjen_01,4,Sat Jul 18 08:20:07 2015 UTC,I'm sick and tired of the 4-1-4-1.  And especially with Wondo not up top when he's out there.  He didn't set the scoring record playing in the upper mid.  Get him up top where he belongs.  Causing trouble for the defenders and goalie.
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,el_floppo,6,Sat Jul 18 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"I think the problem runs much deeper than an announced starting formation.  Collectively, this team just doesn't have what it takes to play a dominant pass-possession game and generate multiple shots on frame each night. We're still more likely than not to get nervous and resort to low-percentage long balls. We rarely demonstrate the ability to build out of the back, or play through the center of the pitch.  I don't care what the announced formation is. Just show me that we can pass, create chances and dominate possession of the ball.  Is Dom the guy to get us there? That's an open question to be answered in the coming months leading into next season."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,pbrrules22,5,Sat Jul 18 06:28:34 2015 UTC,Complete loss of motivation from our team. Simply out classed in the second half.   I can't wait till Dom is able to overhaul our team with the players he wants.
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Cyberwolf30,2,Sat Jul 18 06:36:20 2015 UTC,"He keeps playing Sherrod, and he only had two touches in 30 minutes of play.."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,el_floppo,3,Sat Jul 18 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"Sadly, he had nowhere else to go. Think about this: Jahn and Sherrod were all that we had to bring on late offensively. Ugh."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Arjen_01,2,Sat Jul 18 07:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, subbing both of them on seemed redundant. They're basically the same fucking player except that one of them is bald."
SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,Arjen_01,8,Sat Jul 18 17:09:29 2015 UTC,we didn't have a chance... the ref decided LA was going to win and our players shut down mentally

The quality just isn't there in the Quakes roster to maintain possession and work the ball forward. Always on the back foot. Always reverting to hoofing long balls out of back.   In the face of all that fire power, who do we have for depth in our subs? Jahn and Sherrod.   We're at least 2 years out from any hope of a championship side."

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,LONELOBO8,6,Sat Jul 18 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"I feel really bad saying this because I want him to succeed, but TT doesn't work.  He's not ready. He has amazing potential but he's not ready for the big show yet. Can't keep the ball to save his life, has bad passes, etc. Yes, there are flourishes of brilliance but that doesn't excuse overall bad quality play."

SJEarthquakes,3dpiu0,lookuppage7,2,Sat Jul 18 05:13:11 2015 UTC,"I think once Wondo is back, TT will go back to the bench, which I think will be good for him. He would be a great option off the bench instead of Jahn and Sherrod.  It would also help to reduce TT's minutes. Dude is only 19 and is probably playing more soccer than he ever has in his life at the highest level he has ever faced in his life. Also, the MLS season is long. He is probably getting a little fatigued and burned out."

SJEarthquakes,3dopb1,yebrent,2,Sat Jul 18 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"You're right, I can't know with 100% certainty bc MLS deliberately conceals allocation amounts to increase negotiating leverage. I can do research and make an educated guess, though.  In this case, here was my work:  The two known amounts in the garberbucks universe are annual allotment and cost of a DP slot, both $150k, leaving the Quakes at $0 after considering those two transactions. Add to that the (unknown) allocation for missing the playoffs, which front office staff have told me isn't huge.   The final source is the Sam Cronin trade. Colorado had already spent allocation money twice in trades earlier in the offseason, and got the same overall allocation we did, so it's highly unlikely that we got the entire amount of their allocation, not in the least bc that would be a bad deal for Cronin.   Therefore, I concluded that while the allocation money may well add up to the $150k+ over the cap we are, it's unlikely to be significantly beyond that number since Colorado just didn't have much to give us."

The roster just isn't that deep.  When I think of our current roster, the additional work that needs to be done improve the depth of talent, and the fact that we haven't yet announced the introduction of a USL Reserve team, I wonder whether or not current ownership are actually sports fans. Maybe the business of the Earthquakes is only of mild interest to them ‚Äì a hobby in the context of their larger business portfolio.   How different would this organization look if ownership were actually former players, super passionate about the game, and burning with desire to build championship teams year after year?"

SJEarthquakes,3dmyk9,Arjen_01,2,Fri Jul 17 22:04:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, that's a good point about the top end of spending. I just don't think we know yet whether it's a lack of funds or lack of appeal to DPs that prevents us from signing, say, Dos Santos. I'd imagine that we'd happily pay whatever he's making, but he'd never sign with us.   I also have attended a few academy and dragons games now and I think that part of the club is coming along nicely. can't buy development, it takes time too.  They've also made some moves behind the scenes in the academy that haven't been announced yet that I'd consider strong statements of intent (not new signings or anything, don't get too excited)"
SJEarthquakes,3dmyk9,TheCockerelsCry,0,Fri Jul 17 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"If the appeal of NYC and LA is the celebrity culture and the opportunity to manage high profile PR campaigns by rubbing shoulders with the stars, Columbus and San Jose won't do. However, there are just so many slots available in NYC and LA. And the lifestyle of the Bay Area ain't too shabby.  Once the dance cards at all the NYC and LA teams are filled up, players will have to look at other team locations.   I'd imagine that we'd happily pay whatever he's making, ...   Based upon external evidence, I'm not sure we'd happily pay for a Dos Santos.  The academy and PDL stuff is cool, but there's a critical gap between those levels and MLS: a professional USL reserve team owned and operated by the Quakes with an ability to call up and send down.  How many academy kids go on to become pros?  How many of those go on to play college ball somewhere and then find better offers at other professional organizations? Same question applies to the PDL college players playing for the Dragons.  It feels like all that academy work is just good community service and pro bono work, rather than a coordinated pipeline of player development that leads directly to professional contracts with the Quakes."

I always thought that one of the primary arguments for a closed, single-entity system, as opposed to an open system of independent clubs, was the promise of parity within the league and equal treatment. Clearly that's not really the case.  To play devil's advocate on behalf of Garber, what if all the favoritism that the league has shown for NYC and LA is meant to put pressure on the low-spending ownership groups to step it up?  Of course that could backfire. The low-spenders could just dig in, and MLS becomes like every other league in the world with a few super teams always dominating."

This is true and false. There isn't as big of a gap as you think. Look at Faitai Alashe and Steve Birnbaum at DC for example. Both played 4 years of college/PDL and not a day in USL. USL is definitely important for the reason you stated, and every MLS team should have one, but in term of development, it's not an absolute 100% necessity. It is a huge help though, but we can (and will) have kids coming up to the Quakes from college/PDL.   It feels like all that academy work is just good community service and pro bono work, rather than a coordinated pipeline of player development that leads directly to professional contracts with the Quakes.   It may feel like that, but that's only because you don't know what's going on in the system! This is a big reason I started a blog (and now write some stuff for QE) and try to cover the academy for the masses. Although it's a slow process, there are players on the way. In 2-3 years we're going to start to see the a wave of developed players signing HG deals with the first team. Remember, our academy is very young, but once the wave starts, there will be at least 2 kids signing a year."

SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,QuakesWC,5,Fri Jul 17 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Per Robert Jonas, it's due to transfer fee. I always thought it was a free transfer.   https://twitter.com/robertjonas/status/622076532270329857"
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,dgb422,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"So then the question: do transfer fees count against the cap, because from these numbers, we shouldn't be struggling that much."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,4,Fri Jul 17 16:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it's spread out over the life of the contract, so if his transfer fee was $1M, then the extra cap hit is $250k per year for 4 years, which puts him over the DP threshold.  It should also be pretty easy to use that 100k of Targeted Allocation to buy him down and get another DP."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,lookuppage7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:08 2015 UTC,His was $2M IIRC
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,dgb422,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"So we paid a shit-load of money (pardon my language) to put a player on DP status without actually paying him DP's wages, and if he gets hurt, we're still screwed because even if we drop him, he still counts against our books because of the transfer fee?  Tell me I'm wrong here.."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,2,Fri Jul 17 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly know, but my best guess is that it works something like this:  The $2M transfer fee was paid in full when we got MPG from Tigre.  That money was paid directly to Tigre.  First that's agreed upon, then a contract is negotiated with MPG himself (or his agent, whatever) -- $240K per year for 4 years.  Now for some reason, the salary cap hit from that $2M transfer fee is spread equally over the length of MPG's contract -- so, $500K per year for 4 years.  Obviously adding another $500K to MPG's $240K salary shoots him over the $436K DP threshold by a touch over $300K.  I dunno how or why MLS decided to have transfer fees count against the salary cap like that, but it's monumentally stupid."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,jd35,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:57 2015 UTC,I think its to keep teams from paying out huge bonuses to players to keep them under the DP threshold. Otherwise we could pay Matias a bonus as part of the transfer fee and it's essentially under the table.
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:31 2015 UTC,"The transfer fee goes to the team selling, though."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,jd35,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:38 2015 UTC,"yes, but what is stopping the team from taking a larger fee and then continuing to pay the player to lower his cap hit."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"They're 2 separate transactions.  The transfer fee is negotiated with the selling club, Tigres in the case of MPG,  and then after that is agreed upon the club negotiates a new contract with the player.  There are cases where a player gets a percentage of the transfer fee,but that is normally something with the player and the original selling club.

SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,TheSlowestCheetah,4,Sat Jul 18 07:05:20 2015 UTC,What springs to my mind in regards to the lower-paid players like Alashe and Cato is the Bay Area cost of living must be quite a burden for them.

If you are telling me LA can have a stacked team and pay those guys what they are being paid, we really should not have any issues with our cap.   We should honestly be able to go grab new wing players for a nice chunk of change no problem and really help this midfield. Nyassi and Shea are being paid just above impact bench level midfielders. Yet we have them starting and that's the quality we get. Bargain deals for the cap, but only if you use that money some where else."

SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,Arjen_01,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"Also a possibility. Though they have no problem using part of that cap to sign Silva.  Move Jahn, Stephenson, Francis, Koval, JBP, and Lenhart off the books. There's some real room in which to make some strides forward."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,quakes_tremors,3,Fri Jul 17 18:17:54 2015 UTC,Disagree on Jahn and Koval. Why would we keep Sherrod over Jahn? Sherrod has been worse this year. Koval is a solid player and can play multiple positions. That alone makes him fairly valuable and his salary is one of the lowest on the team
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,Arjen_01,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Respectfully disagree.  Sherrod > Jahn  Koval is not good on the ball. Need to find more players with good ball handling skills. If he is meant to be an alternate #6 to Alashe, he would have to develop the much better dribbling skills and an ability to pick out runs and distribution outlets with killer precise passing."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,2,Fri Jul 17 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"I'm betting Silva doesn't actually count against the cap.  From the MLS rules:   Players occupying roster spots 1-20 count against the club‚Äôs 2015 salary budget of $3,490,000, and are referred to collectively as the club‚Äôs Senior Roster. Roster spots 19 and 20 are not required to be filled, and teams may spread their salary budget across only 18 Salary Budget Players.  A minimum salary budget charge will be imputed against a team‚Äôs salary budget for each unfilled senior roster spot below 18. The maximum budget charge for a single player is $436,250. Players occupying roster spots 21-28 do not count against the club‚Äôs salary budget, and are referred to collectively as the club‚Äôs Supplemental Roster (maximum of eight per team). All Generation adidas players are Supplemental Roster players. Players occupying roster spots 21-24 will earn at least $60,000 in 2015. Players occupying roster spots 25-28 will earn at least $50,000 in 2015.   If you take the top 20 salaries from this data, you have $3,739.131 -- which is $249,131 OVER the cap.  According to the rule, though, TT's salary doesn't count against the cap.  Subtract $145K from that,  you now have the Quakes at $104,131 over the cap -- but that is assuming that MPG's cap hit is the full $436K.  IF his cap hit is only $240K and not $436K, you can subtract another $196,250, putting the Quakes at about $92,000 under the salary cap.  This is also before Garberbucks are used to buy down anybody, if that's happening."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"Move Jahn, Stephenson, Francis, Fucito, JBP, and Lenhart off the books.   Fixed.  Koval is cheap, young, and should be a good depth/rotational backup for Alashe"
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,Arjen_01,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, add Fucito, but I'm not high on Koval at all. I watched him carefully in the last game against quality players from Club America. It dawned on me that he just doesn't have the skills to play high level soccer. He and Jahn probably hit their level at Stanford as American college players. The relatively low level of play in MLS probably masks their deficiencies.  Once you speed up the tempo of the game, you spot the cracks in skill level."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"Hard to pass judgement based off a game against a CCL winning Mexican side, even their B teams are better than a lot of MLS players.  That said, he may not be MLS starter caliber, but as depth and a guy who can play CDM and fill in at CB for basically league minimum, that's not a bad value at all."
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,Arjen_01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:14:49 2015 UTC,"Well, with your qualifiers, I guess I could reluctantly keep him on.  Having said that, are we redefining the meaning of depth? Club America is deep with talent. What does depth in MLS mean to you?"
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,MikeFive,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"Club America has the ability to spend WAY higher than any team in MLS.  Depth in MLS is never going to be a reality while teams have to pay 50-60k/year to the guys on the end of the roster.  The salary cap NEEDS to increase significantly.  Guys like Nyassi and Salinas should be the depth players, not Fucito/Jahn/Francis.  As we're seeing now, ""missing"" on a couple of players (JBP, Lenhart) and/or a key injury (Ermagherd) can cripple a team.  That's $850K in salary cap space that is wasted.  The Quakes are essentially only getting 75% of the full salary cap for the rest of the team because 3 guys aren't contributing."

SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,TomRhodesMusic,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:53 2015 UTC,So some back of the napkin math puts our total salary for the team around $4.6 million... which is funny because the next salary on the list under our team is Altidore... he makes $4.75. SMH  Let's then look at what the team might be making just on ticket sales... 18k per game at an average of $90 per seat... that's $1.6 million in box office and doesn't include parking and concessions... Let's round that out to $2 million per home game.  That also doesn't include TV/Video game rights... but I digress... on paper this team should make enough money to be able to afford at least one more BIG player in the $1.5-3 million dollar range... It's a bummer that they don't seem to have anyone that they are willing to drop that cash on.
SJEarthquakes,3dmui2,rb604321,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"I think your $2M per game is conservative figure. Merchandise, concessions, and parking on most games that I have attended should be pushing the take per game considerably higher.  LOBINA is usually a pretty busy place for 3-4 hours a night. Feels like they should easily be able to bring in players at the level you suggest even when taking into account other significant large costs such as financing new stadium, FO overhead, and maintenance costs. Financially it feels like the team should be in a relatively strong situation for investment in the team going forward."

It was a recoverable position but it wasn't going to be easy.   My dad, his friend from college, and I went to the home leg, ready to cheer on the team we had loved since they were the Clash. We were cautiously optimistic about our chances.  It took about twenty minutes of game time for the Galaxy to go up 2-0 again. Now the Quakes were down 4-0 on aggregate. We were sitting 2 sections over (back in good ol' Spartan Stadium) from the LA support section, which you could probably imagine was going nuts over the current scoreline.   Some Quakes fans left (but not many). I think most of us were just too curious to see how bad it would get. Seventy more minutes could mean a lot of Carlos Ruiz goals.  Then the Quakes quickly got one back off a brilliant Jeff Agoos freekick. 4-1 aggregate. Desperate hope replaced a bit of pessimism. Minutes later, a man you may have heard of, Landon Donovan, puts one in. 4-2 aggregate. More hope and optimism flowed in. We put two in in 25 minutes, why couldn't we put two in in 45 minutes of the second half? There was no away goal rule so we only needed two (assuming they didn't score again).  Second half comes along and we get one early in the half. 4-3 aggregate. Quakes fans are getting louder. Galaxy section gets quieter as more and more begin to uncomfortably fidget. There's still 40 minutes left and we've seen 5 goals and we all can feel more are coming.  And then nothing. Nothing for 39 minutes. As the game wears on both sides have their chances but it just won't go in. We seemed sure to tie it up on aggregate after the 3rd Quakes goal but now it seems very possible it won't happen.   In the 90th minute a cross comes in (from Dayak or Ekelund, can't remember who). The young Chris Roner goes up for it and manages to head it past Hartman into the net. 4-4 aggregate. Deafening noise from around the stadium. Deafening silence from the Galaxy section. The tables have turned, now we're taunting them.  No away goals rule so we head to Golden Goal overtime. I can't even begin to describe how tense but optimistic everyone felt. It just had to be. We couldn't come storming back from 4 goals down to lose. The heartbreak might kill us.  Five minutes in and the Galaxy have a long ball to Carlos Ruiz which just misses where it needed to be to send him 1v1. It was close. Everyone flinched. We get the ball. Dribble it into their territory. One pass. A quick turn. Pass to Faria. The crowd sees it. Hartman sees it. He comes out but Faria sends it far post, into the net. 5-4.  Chaos. Spartan Stadium erupts. The bench clears as everyone loses their mind. Everyone is hugging each other in the stands. All except that Galaxy section, which must have been practicing a fire drill because they left the stadium in 25 seconds. They thought they could repeat. They thought they'd really show the noisy neighbors to the North who was in control. No, sir.  For me that will always be the Quakes. That team. Those early 2000 teams. Once they moved them I stopped watching the MLS. When they came back I went to a few games (again with my dad) but it didn't feel the same. I was bitter they had taken more of those experiences away from me and everyone who made the trek to Spartan Stadium to support them long before MLS had any national attention.   So go ahead LA, show us all the Championships you've bought. Tell us how good it makes you feel to collect Beckham, Dos Santos, Keane, whomever. Nothing you do will compare to that magical night in 2003.   TLDR: FARIAAAAAAAAAAAA"

SJEarthquakes,3dk9rs,TomRhodesMusic,3,Fri Jul 17 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"People criticize him because he hasn't led to points yet. To be clear I don't criticize him for that, I completely agree with you.  It kind of bothers me that they are both being played as CAMs. I would love to see either TT or MPG out wide as an RM while the other playing CAM and possibly exchange rolls through the game. I think that would be a headache for the other team to defend and could open up some space to possess and move the ball through the middle on the ground.  I think that when TT starts to get strikers in front of him that aren't scared to shoot and can play a ball to their feet you will start to see his popularity explode. It would be cool to see him scoring some, but really the thing that he brings is that little extra bit of space where he can slot in passes, we just need people who can create space and react. Wondo does that really really well, other than him we got a bag of magic beans upfront. We might get lucky and score with a forward some day but they aren't paying the rent right now.  We see the fans coming around to MPG now that you can see his style of play starting to gel. He picked up a goal, a few assists, and all the sudden he is starting to fee like a DP... I think that if Tommy had the same playing time with MPG and the rest of this team we would see HUGE improvements from him and hopefully a little more production up front.   I get the argument against it though. If MPG goes down again, who else could you put there? We are really thin in the middle after MPG and TT, who's left Kari? No thank you."
SJEarthquakes,3dk9rs,Quakes98,2,Fri Jul 17 06:12:20 2015 UTC,The thought of Khari starting for the first team due to injuries is genuinely terrifying. He's a nice guy but he's way past it
SJEarthquakes,3dk9rs,TalussAthner,2,Fri Jul 17 10:13:24 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, its starting to bother me when people complain that Tommy doesn't have a goal or assist yet, he's set up people for great chances on goal more than a few times now, its just that no one but Wondo can finish and Wondo's only had maybe 1 of those chances."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,dgb422,8,Thu Jul 16 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Quakes coach Dominic Kinnear confirmed that the club is chasing after Pelosi, a natural left-footer who could fit in at a number of different spots for San Jose.  Article's author: Geoff Lepper (shout out!)"
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,Quakes98,5,Thu Jul 16 17:37:57 2015 UTC,Pelosi: I want to play here  Kinnear: We want him to play here  What's taking so long exactly? Is MLS the one holding this up?
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,SomeCruzDude,4,Thu Jul 16 19:42:39 2015 UTC,"What's taking so long exactly?   If/when we sign Pelosi, we'll be using our top spot in the allocation order. There is a very small possibility that something of greater value than Pelosi would come through a trade for that top spot and so the Quakes really need to evaluate their strategy.  If Pelosi was falling through the ranks of the order and we were even at #3, we probably would have signed him sooner."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,RunningFerDauyz,3,Thu Jul 16 21:11:12 2015 UTC,allocation order is such bullshit
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,Quakes-JD,3,Fri Jul 17 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"We need to sign him for a few reasons, glad it looks probable.   As far as truly major signings, I doubt we see that until the offseason as the team needs to rid itself of some non performing contracts. We can only hope that the club has the option not to renew Lenhart's deal so we can also then buy out JBP. The way I understand it is if the club just declines the option on a player, that is not the same as buying him out (and teams are limited to only 1 buy out each offseason)."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,el_floppo,2,Thu Jul 16 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"I believe you are correct, although the Quakes could make Innocent inactive/ineligible for the season, freeing up a potential DP slot for the year.  He would also fall under the ""21-23 Designated Player"" and his salary would only be $200K against the salary cap (rather than $350k)."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,Quakes98,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"DP slot? For Pelosi? I don't think we'll need a DP slot for him. Mix Diskarud ans Sasha kljestan are not even a DPs.   If he was DP signing, then the fact that we have the #1 spot in the allocation order would be moot a la the Clint Dempsey rule."

It sounds like Liverpool really liked him, he has some caps for the NT and Kinnear has seen him train, but he's still unproven.   Then again - Tommy T was making $140K according to last year's MLSPU numbers and Tommy didn't spend time overseas with LFC, so maybe Pelosi is worth more than I think. It wouldn't be the first time I was wrong about something."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,Sjtid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"Tommy is a HGP, though, and those contracts are generally given to have players skip college."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,el_floppo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't consider that. TT was making more money last year than Harry Shipp, Will Trapp and Gyasi Zardes, who all went to college for more than 1 year. That makes sense since Tommy quit college to turn pro after 1 year at Indiana, which is a pretty big thing to give up and deserves compensation. For comparison, Shipp finished school at Notre Dame and, as a rookie, was being paid under $100K."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,MikeFive,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"To be clear, you don't need to quit college to get a homegrown contract.. TT could have finished college then gotten signed as a homegrown. (although he would first have to register as a homegrown)"
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,mjbatt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:19:36 2015 UTC,"Right. Like I mentioned, Shipp finished college. I think Zardes did, too. And it sounds like Jordan Morris is going to finish at Stanford. The HGP apparatus is to encourage teams to develop their academies since HGPs don't count against the cap and they have rights to claim any promising players they develop.  I don't think players register as homegrown. I'm not sure they have a say in it. The club that runs the academy they went through has to claim them as a homegrown player. And I think there is some specific criteria the players have to meet in order for a team to be able to claim a player as HG. A team (or multiple teams) challenged Chicago's claim to Shipp, and it went through some arbitration process with the league."

SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,Arjen_01,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"""Chasing"" would seem to be an overstatement, given that there hasn't been much competition for Pelosi's services, and that Pelosi is still not signed. Pelosi himself seems desperate and hopeful that the Quakes will take him in.  Maybe we'll end up signing him, but we certainly are not ""chasing"" him."
SJEarthquakes,3dizzl,MikeFive,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"Chasing could imply they are trying hard to negotiate a contract that they thinks is fair. They probably want him, but for the right price."

SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,lookuppage7,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"This is a much bigger problem than just two drunken fans throwing bottles. This is a cultural problem. No matter where Mexican teams play, tens of thousands of Mexican fans (men, women and children) will shout ""Puto"" (homo, faggot, whore, pansy, queer, pussy) in unison at the opposing goal keeper, and will throw bottles and debris at opposing players on the field.  The only remedy to this problem would be for CONCACAF to fine the Mexican federation a huge sum of money and to impose a three-year ban on publicly played matches. Empty stadiums for three years. Repeat as necessary."

SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,lookuppage7,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"You're right about CONCACAF not having the balls to sanction the Mexican federation, but it remains the only effective remedy to the problem.  I'm trying to imagine a scenario in which American Outlaws would show up at every U.S. match around the world, calling out GKs with the insult, ""Faggot!"", and raining bottles and debris onto opposing players. Do you think that would be tolerated by the world?"
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,Arjen_01,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"I hate to put it bluntly, since I despise the actions, but the world doesn't give a fuck. They couldn't care less about it. If there is so little inaction about the way Qatar treats the stadium workers, or civil wars shooting up team buses in Africa, what makes you think that people will compel action on this?   Oddly enough, the US stadiums do have the authority to kick people out for verbal abuse; but its been well known by now that it is done. I would think the reason why they look the other way is because of the amount of money generated at these events.   Here is the other thing too; it can't just be the American outlaws in your scenario. That makes it too easy to ban a specific group. The reason there is nothing done is because there is no single bannable entity."
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,lookuppage7,2,Thu Jul 16 18:41:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely in disagreement with your assessment of the cynical attitudes that would result in a blind eye being cast over all of this. However, UEFA have enforced financial and stadium ban penalties for similarly offensive fan actions.   Moscow was forced to play Champions League matches at home in empty stadiums.   Bayern Munich were forced to pay a fine and to leave two entire sections of seating at Allianz Arena unsold as a result of two fans displaying homophobic placards aimed at √ñzil.  It's possible to administer a punishment that would hurt the Mexican NT and fan base and prompt cultural change. But, as you said, the will within CONCACAF may not be there.  Still, can this continue to be tolerated and have a precedent set for what is acceptable in CONCACAF play? Do we, with a wink and a nod, say to MLS fans that this is acceptable behavior? Might the cancer spread if nothing is done?"
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,Arjen_01,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"Not likely, MLS is pretty heavy handed with these actions and for good reason.   CONCACAF is kinda screwed if it tried something like this, in that US stadiums can't really prevent Mexicans from buying tickets, but this always seems like the setup they like.   I would've preferred the fans get banned during home matches through the WCQ, but I find it hard to believe CONCACAF could not be $wayed otherwise."
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,lookuppage7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:03:28 2015 UTC,"FYI ""Puto"" is the abbreviation of prostituto, which translates to male prostitute. Usually this isnt used as a gay slur or used at all, in Hispanic culture prostitution is seem as one of the lowest if not the lowest way of making money. Drunks, Gangster, and Drug dealers are respected more then prostitutes. Puta which is a female prostitute its seem as one of the biggest insults in the Spanish language. The insult refers that the male person wasnt able to obtain a real job and had to fall to getting pay for sex. To be honest, I dont remember a lot of people using Puto until I started watching some Mexican games.  Some might use it as a gay slur but usually you will hear Joto, Culero, or Maricon as the insults people use to refer to gay man. Actually, Mexican people used to chant Culero, Culero, Culero to the ref or the opposing team, which will translate to Fag, Fag, Fag. Not trying to defend anyone, but just trying to inform anyone that was confused on what it meant.  By the way, Im not Mexican Im Salvadoran. At every game that I have attended in the States only Mexican people do that Chant. Everyone that I have talk to that isnt Mexican agrees that it shouldnt be part of the game and would like Mexico to get some kind of punishment."
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,willos003,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the point of clarification. But, wouldn't you agree, that one little word has layers of insult built in? It doesn't just cover the low regard for prostitutes, or the inability to find real work, or being weak, it also (because male prostitution mostly involves gay sex) covers the cultural scorn directed at gays."
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,Arjen_01,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree its a horrible word that has multiple layers and it can be a cultural scorn directed at gays. A way to explain this is male prison rape. The man who does the raping doesn't consider themselves gay because they were the ones doing the penetrating. The insult in Puto is that they are the ones who are taking it. let it be that they are gay or not, they were the ones who were being dominated. Hijo de Puta (son of a bitch) is the biggest insult in Latin America, because you are telling the other person that their mother was dominated by multiple guys, more like a machismo thing. I think is more like calling a guy a bitch then calling someone gay, likewise sometimes when you call a man a bitch there is some kind of homosexual vibe to that insult. Here is a video of the Culero chant you can see that its used when they want to insult someone when they thing they are doing something wrong, while the other seems more like something that they are used to doing"
SJEarthquakes,3dgjp4,willos003,2,Thu Jul 16 22:03:59 2015 UTC,Completely understand in situations where one or two things are thrown. I just don't understand how feasible it is to punish individuals when an entire landfill is tossed on the field.

Hes not going to start, but id rather they sign an 18 year old to sit on the bench and potentially develop than a 30+ year old to sit on the bench and rot.  Also, i dont even think his salary will count against the cap, bc hes most likely getting minimum and will be taking a ""supplemental roster"" spot."

But, perhaps the most important announcement the Quakes could make right now, for me, would be the establishment of a local USL reserve team and the hiring of a world-class technical staff under the leadership of Kinnear, with the promise of producing constant stream of world-class football players and a consistently winning first team that is stacked with talent from top to bottom."
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,Arjen_01,5,Wed Jul 15 21:44:55 2015 UTC,That's all I keep asking the @quakesprez twitter handle now. USL team needs to happen now.
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,lookuppage7,3,Wed Jul 15 22:25:19 2015 UTC,+1  I'd rather we spent however many millions on bringing burlingame up to USL than sign lampard or gerrard.  but it would be nice to get a high quality int'l dp... someone not quite on gerrard/dos santos level but above mpg/innocent... like a sessegnon or asamoah gyan.
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,pbrrules22,5,Wed Jul 15 23:38:39 2015 UTC,"I don't get why it's one or the other. If anything, LA has proved it is possible to have both a USL team and bring in Gerrard and Gio.  No offense to the Warriors but the Cali Classico is turning into the supposed Lakers-Warriors rivalry where Lakers don't really give a shit. The Galaxy is getting so far ahead of us in almost all aspects."
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,QuakesWC,3,Thu Jul 16 04:23:42 2015 UTC,"I do understand what you meant with your analogy, but since you're using it to describe the current and future state of the California Clasico...I'm sure you know that the Warriors are the NBA champions and a team with the most upside in the league, while the Lakers are one of the laughing stocks of said league. Just saying. Historically speaking, definitely. But, in terms of NOW, it's the exact opposite. The only reason the Lakers haven't given a shit the past few seasons, and will likely continue to not really give a shit for a few more seasons to come, is because it's basically no contest at this point."
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,wavetoyou,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:35:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough about the current state of affairs, but how long will that last?  You can be sure the Lakers are reloading and given their history, this lull is just temporary and they'll be back competing again within 5 years.  For the Warriors to be looked at as a rival, they'll have to be consistently good for the next ten years and beat the Lakers a couple times in the playoffs.  The Quakes have to act right now if they don't want to be a similar afterthought."
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,QuakesWC,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:33 2015 UTC,Well our academy system is finally on it's feet and producing through a great coaching staff and it's only a matter if time before we make some more signings from that front. Hopefully for our own USL Pro team. I'm sure this stadium will bring that to us by next season or the one after.
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,Cyberwolf30,4,Wed Jul 15 22:44:48 2015 UTC,the problem is 99% of academy kids are not close to being ready for mls... they need to develop 3-4 years in college. a USL team would help the best and the brightest develop much more quickly b/c they could play 9 months/year instead of 3.
SJEarthquakes,3dff57,pbrrules22,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:29:43 2015 UTC,So how long you gonna give them that benefit?

SJEarthquakes,3deyze,Arjen_01,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"Don't see Impact happening because of Montreal Impact.   Beside that, some good names that could be used!  EDIT: Response to a deleted comment  Two things  1) I think it's a little different when you have a team in the top women's league vs a team in the top indoor soccer league. MASL isn't even sanctioned by the USSF as far as I know whereas NWSL is.  2) The Quakes probably want the name to be more associated with them. If Impact was chosen, it would cause some confusion since SJ and Montreal share similar colors (blue/black) and so a black/blue Impact team would make you think Montreal before Earthquakes."

SJEarthquakes,3deinr,Quakes98,3,Wed Jul 15 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"I've been a bit torn. First, I love that it's not beyond my means and I can afford it. Second, it's much more fun to be a part of the crowd celebrating a goal than on TV.  But I haven't renewed quite yet. I'm still distrustful on how the FO handles this team and its fans. Last year, my tickets were $280 and parking $15 each game. Now I'm asked for $340 while having to pay $25 for parking. Sure I can get a season parking pass to save money, but I can only handle the ticketing at once. Money isn't my chief concern though it's annoying. It's more about how the team is using it. The game against Houston game me pause since two of our A squad players were out and our team went to shit. Club America was a dangerous team no matter who they put on the pitch and that's what our team needs is more depth. Meanwhile, other teams are signing big names while we sign no names, unproven players no one in America has heard of.  I don't want to lose my tenure, but unless things prove positive, I want to send a message that I'm not happy about the way things are and they better improve them. So I'm at least holding out until I HAVE to renew. Until then, I'm waiting to see how this team performs.  tl;dr the money keeps going up, the team has little depth, holding out until I have to renew to see what I'm paying for."
SJEarthquakes,3deinr,BTornado14,5,Wed Jul 15 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, other teams are signing big names while we sign no names, unproven players no one in America has heard of.   This part bugs the crap out of me as well.  I get trying to build depth, but you also need to have a team with players people WANT to see.  No offense to current Quakes, but nobody is going to pay to come see Matias Perez Garcia or Innocent Ermaghera, no matter how well MPG has been playing this season.  Nobody goes out of their way to see a Quakes game because Nyassi or Barrera might be playing.  People like seeing Wondo.  People like seeing Tommy when he actually gets minutes.  People LOVE to see players like Dempsey, Kaka, Villa, Pirlo, and dos Santos.  I'd actually consider it a huge disappointment if we didn't make use of the new allocation money and bring in a new player this window.  I'd also like to see a USL Pro team and a NWSL side.  All that aside, I absolutely LOVE Avaya, and I do actually want to show support for it being privately financed."

I don't mind having a big name player, but my priority lies with a winning team playing world-class football. If that winning team is made up of no-name players with ridiculous technical skills, I'm on board.  Names aren't so important. It's the quality of the football that counts."
SJEarthquakes,3deinr,Arjen_01,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"Big names are exciting, but, just to register a reality check here, NYCFC are currently 18th in the table.   NYC have one big name playing for them currently, maybe two if you count Mix.  You think they'll still be 18th when Pirlo and Lampard start playing?  I don't.     I don't mind having a big name player, but my priority lies with a winning team playing world-class football. If that winning team is made up of no-name players with ridiculous technical skills, I'm on board.   We don't have that."
SJEarthquakes,3deinr,MikeFive,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"True. But my simple point is that hiring a retiring star from an UEFA club does not necessarily translate into a winning team playing quality football.  If one focuses on the objective of building a consistently winning team that plays quality football, one can ask the question, ""how do we get there?""  The best long term strategy would be to invest in world-class coaching and technical staff, and to build a USL reserve team to train alongside the MLS first team. The same money one could sink into a two-year contract for Pirlo could be sunk into a reserve team and world-class coaching and development program. The difference is that the retiring UEFA star will be gone in two years and may not even be able to make a positive impact, whereas the reserve team and the coaching/development program would yield benefits for many years to come.  Given the choice between hiring Pirlo, and hiring a Guardiola-type coach to lead the Quakes and their USL development program, I'd hire the Guardiola-type coach every time."
SJEarthquakes,3deinr,Arjen_01,3,Wed Jul 15 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"True. But my simple point is that hiring a retiring star from an UEFA club does not necessarily translate into a winning team playing quality football.   True, and I've never advocated that.  I want young players with the potential to improve.  I think that they should have gone HARD after Mix, overpaying if necessary, last offseason.    To be clear, I DON'T want guys like Lampard, Gerrard, etc in San Jose.  Even Kaka would be a stretch, though he's playing well for Orlando.  The problem is instead of signing a guy like Giovinco, dos Santos, Chicharito, or even a USMNT player like Klejstan, Shea, Mix, etc we're getting guys like Pablo Pintos, Innocent, Nyassi, and Sherrod.  As it's been said elsewhere, we're near the top in attendance.  We've basically sold out every game at Avaya.  We're the only team in one of the biggest markets in the country.  There's zero reason that we shouldn't be one of the biggest spending teams -- and I mean on everything.  Academy, USL, coaching staff throughout the organization"
SJEarthquakes,3deinr,MikeFive,2,Wed Jul 15 22:12:43 2015 UTC,Do you go to games for names or to support your local club? You sounds like an LA fan bro.. That might be the club for you if you only care about stars.

We shouldn't be treated like a minor league team we deserve a quality team with depth. Matias Perez-Garcia has been fantastic, but realistically we need a few more MPG level players to have a shot at an MLS Cup. Our FO and ownership needs to treat this team like Toronto, LA, NYCFC, and fucking Orlando do, striving to acquire the best talent possible. Don't be content with mediocrity."

We are not good when our stars are away and I don't see us doing anything about it. Signing an 18 year old Brazilian mid fielder is not the answer. Secondly, the FO has failed to satisfactorily respond to some concerns I have had in our section. The STH's in the row behind us have sold their tickets to LA and CA fans the ladt couple of games and there has been near riots caused by over consumption of alcohol by those people. Security has not responded when the ushers have been asked and the FO only wants to gear if I enjoyed the Fautzone or the pretzels."

SJEarthquakes,3dcfh6,dgb422,2,Wed Jul 15 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"Freeze it right at the pass. If JJ's more aware, he tracks back a step or two at most and one time passes to Fatai, catching that traffic (3+ CA players) on the wrong side of the ball and creating an opportunity to shift play to the middle third or even into transition.   That traffic isn't an issue as long as players are tactically aware, which JJ needs to work on. I bet Dom shows him this.   Edit - It even looks like JJ was trying to body turn and turned right into the path of the CA player. Should've seen Fatai easily unless the ref screened him, but I dunno about that. Caused more trouble trying to finesse it."

SJEarthquakes,3dcfh6,dgb422,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:39:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, even on that pass he really didn't have any other options. Watch it again and look at all of the Quakes players around him standing still when he is being pressured. Nobody moves to the ball or to space, JJ stands still waiting for the pass. The CB doesn't move to space to allow an outlet to switch the play and Alashe gives up on his run right when he was needed to create any space... that was a bum play, but it wasn't just 39's fault.  I thought that he looked pretty darn good out there, but I'm still voting for Q's clothesline tackle."

SJEarthquakes,3dchcm,Arjen_01,2,Wed Jul 15 08:35:03 2015 UTC,I posted most of this in the post match thread but here is what I found on them along with some additional info I just found going back aways for Coutadeur.   Coutadeur is a guy who would slot in as a cm for us. Maybe he would be played defensively but from Information I could find he seems to be more of an all rounder. L'equipe has like nothing on him. He was at one point promising player but signed for Monaco in 2009 when the ownership was a bit shaky and so was stuff with the team. Was with them until they got relegated in 2011 and then signed with Lorient who are a midtable club in Ligue 1. Due to injury(? Saw some recent articles indicating he was out some for Lorient.) he hasn't featured much for them over the past 4 years and now his contract is up.   As a follow up to that information on Monaco I found this article dating back to his time with them questioning what happened to his talent and why things just weren't working out at monaco. Who knows what level he'll bring to us.   Not too much info on Matheus Silva. 19 year old Brazilian who played 19 times this year for America De Pernambuco in one of the many Brazilian leagues. That system is too hard for me to understand. No idea what to expect of him. /u/eddie_atleti replied in the post match thread saying that it was the 6th division of Brazilian soccer soooooo who knows... I know the Brazilian leagues are complex so if we have any brazilians in here who could clarify that would be great.

SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,Alex_Morgan_FBED,4,Wed Jul 15 04:41:01 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. #39 had the possession skills in tight spaces and reminded me of an MPG type (and just as small).

SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,eddie_atleti,3,Wed Jul 15 05:15:15 2015 UTC,The only thing that worries me about him is injury problems. But overall he has been slightly more successful than Pierazzi in his career so that may bode well.

At least Nyassi got his money worth for his red with that two footed kickout from his back.   Tale of two halves team wise. Up until MPG left the quakes performed well. Afterwards, not so much although I thought tommy had some bright spots.   What's up with JJ? I had high hopes for a first round draft pick. When he isn't getting sent off (and he very easily could have with that lunge of his), he's giving the ball away cheaply in awful spots. Led directly to the second america goal.   And of course Quincy got injured. It looked like he dislocated his shoulder, so hopefully that's just popping it back in and painkillers. But with the Quakes injury luck it will probably be worse."

SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,DeepSlumps,3,Wed Jul 15 04:49:12 2015 UTC,Fuck this season and year. Injuries upon injuries are ruining this team I thought had a chance. No one on this team seems to care about winning except Wondo. No one is willing to DIE for their teammates except Wondo. It's just a joke of a team. Combine that with the rimjob the league is giving LA with Gio? While we struggle to sign fucking Pelosi? I just can't be arsed to care anymore.
SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,pnf1987,10,Wed Jul 15 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"This is such an over reaction. Especially for a game that had our starters play only half the time. We are miles ahead of where we were last year. We have a decent team that I know is going to make the playoffs. Even if the worst happens in LA, I wouldn't go into panic mode because we're facing one of the best teams in the league in their home which has caused struggles for pretty much any other MLS team.  As far as Pelosi goes, he wants to play here so signing him isn't an issue. The FO just wants to play it smart and wait if someone better is available before they go ahead and use their number 1 allocation spot.  Lastly, everyone cares as much as Wondo. Just because they don't score doesn't mean they don't. Look at Perez Garcia, Alashe, Goodson, Wynne. They've all been just as instrumental to this team as Wondo. We are having a good run to the playoffs. It just doesn't look like it because the West is crowded and our games in hand haven't been played yet."
SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,CapitalistSoviet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"I get it's an overreaction, but we have never seen this team attitude before. I don't see a fighting spirit from anyone besides Wondo. No one rushes forward on attack or defense besides him. Hands-up and finger points happen after every goal we concede. I don't expect our Quakes to win every game or beat LA to prized players, I just want a team that fights for the badge on the front, not the name on the back. I don't get that vibe right now, and that vibe is a core principle to who the quakes are."

SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,CapitalistSoviet,2,Wed Jul 15 05:34:03 2015 UTC,Agreed. Sherrod and MPG worked their asses off chasing defenders in the first half. Probably knew they were only playing limited amounts and put their all into it.

This team has gone from optimistic to woeful in a matter of months. Working hard isn't just how much sweat you have, it's the guts to push up the field when we're down a goal, to track back when we're up. In 2012, every man on that pitch dedicated themselves to the cause of winning for the team. I don't see that same effort."
SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,MisterChao,6,Wed Jul 15 05:48:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously? The 2012 quakes were a totally different side, in a lot of senses.  Hopeful crosses had significantly more success with lenny and gordo each in the best form of their entire careers.  Our wide play was different with young players at rb and lb, each more attack-minded than their current counterparts.  I don't see it as an effort issue at all.  I see it as more of a personnel/coaching problem. Once again though, this is just a friendly.  It's not like this is the first time San Jose has ever stumbled without wondo.  Look at how Seattle is languishing without Dempsey.  It isn't because the other 10 don't work hard enough.  It's because they aren't used to playing without the focal point of their collective offenses"
SJEarthquakes,3dcfdo,dgb422,3,Wed Jul 15 06:07:06 2015 UTC,While we struggle to sign fucking Pelosi?   We aren't struggling to sign him. He was on trial here (longer than he was supposed to be) which means the ball is in our court. Kinnear and the FO will choose whether or not we want to sign him...it isn't as if we can't sign Pelosi.
SJEarthquakes,3dayzm,haydez,2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:47 2015 UTC,Heard about this on KLIV yesterday about the fire. Happy to see the Quakes stepping up to help the guy and the U17 team out.

SJEarthquakes,3dc9m6,sjq11,2,Wed Jul 15 03:39:09 2015 UTC,Am I alone in thinking that part of the reason for low supporter turnout was that nobody except for fans of Mexican soccer is really that interested in seeing Club America in a meaningless exhibition match? The event was designed to draw in a particular demographic which doesn't necessarily overlap with the existing fanbase.
SJEarthquakes,3dc9m6,eddie_atleti,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"Crazy how many fans were walking back home because they didn't have a seat and stood outside literally begging for a ticket to see America.   Wish we had our chants going, all America fans had to do was scream Aguilas to overtake the noise in the stadium"
SJEarthquakes,3dc9m6,SanJoseNativetil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:12:08 2015 UTC,"It's one of those technical sell outs.  I'm in the section you speak of, work is typically the factor that cuts numbers down. Tis why weekday games historically end up having less numbers. This isn't anything new at all if you've been to buckshaws $1 hot dog games in the past. The team unfortunately is not centrally located for ALL of the teams fans and many of those in the supporters section live outside of San Jose."

SJEarthquakes,3dai3z,LurkMonster,3,Tue Jul 14 19:40:10 2015 UTC,I'd be down but I typically go to the stadium for midweek games since I go down from Walnut Creek. I'd be down for a weekend or Friday game or unless you want to meet at the stadium to talk Quakes.
SJEarthquakes,3dai3z,QuakesWC,2,Tue Jul 14 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"I will be there with one other friend. I usually work until 7 but will try to leave by 5. That will get me to the stadium around 6:30. If  you want to hang out in the lot and drink some beers before going inside, send me a message."
SJEarthquakes,3dai3z,popsdiner,2,Tue Jul 14 21:53:40 2015 UTC,something just came up and I won't be able to make it
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,SanJoseNativetil,2,Tue Jul 14 22:58:20 2015 UTC,I think you'll find most people here that have ST will say that it is worth it.  It's just a matter of choosing your view and budget.
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,QuakesWC,2,Tue Jul 14 23:49:11 2015 UTC,I've got my tickets in the Ultras section. I'm able to go to pretty much every game so it's definitely worth it to me. Tickets were pretty cheap and way cheaper than if I had paid face value each time I go. You also get two bonus games a year. With one being every Open Cup Home game we got three essentially free games this year. First dibs for the all star game next year too. Season ticket holders get a discount at the team store as well.  I would go to a few games this year and check out each supporters group to see what you like the most. they are all GA anyway so you can roam around and see what suits you best  I know there's a waitlist for season tickets so I don't know how long you'll have to wait.
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,hella_sj,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on sitting with a supporter's group? Or in the stands?  I picked the stands, at around the 18' box, and up under the roof. Great view (then again, everywhere has a great view), covered, fits my budget, and it means a little exercise getting to the seat.   It all depends what you want out of your location and what you can afford, especially since the price changes section-to-section. I don't regret my purchase because I budgeted specifically for the seats and had an idea of what I wanted my sightlines and experience to be like."
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,Zupkuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"Totally worth it. I've had a single season ticket with the ultras since 2011 and up until last year, I was able to attend pretty much every game. I've only been able to make it to about half the matches this season (""grown up"" job/started a family) and the ones I cannot attend, I've been able to sell my ticket instantly on Stubhub for at least face value. I always post it as the cheapest listing too. Tonight's game is one of the two free/bonus tickets and it sold in 11 minutes listed at $40. Who knows how long this trend will continue when the novelty of the new stadium wears off.  As far as the supporter groups, I'm not going to try and sell you on it and I'm above bad mouthing other groups willing to support the Quakes. I'll just say that the ultras have the most members and take things to the most extreme. People say we have the most militant style of support...that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you are. There's a lot of hate on the internet about the ultras, but go to the games, stand with the group(s) or observe from a distance and be the judge for yourself. You can also email the groups for more info."
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,iPunchWombats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:20 2015 UTC,Just don't sit in the Ultras section. They harass fans (including season ticket holders) and fans of other teams even when you are nowhere near their chanting section. Most are great people but they send completely unreasonable psychos to come scream and stand in front of you until you move where they are not. Yet again the few losers ruining it for the many and giving the Ultras and undeserved bad name.
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,runrunrun231,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:01:44 2015 UTC,Wow that doesnt sound like a good time. My girlfriend and I area looking into getting ST so staying in a calmer area would be preferred
SJEarthquakes,3dba48,Q_J,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:28:37 2015 UTC,I sit in sec 119 row 8 right across from the Ultras and have no issue (as long as you can deal with the noise).  I do find some of the ultras self-aggrandizing  (IMO) a bit much...but they at least bring spirit and passion to an otherwise dead/quite stadium.  That being said I have only made about half the matches thus far this season bc summer weekends tend to be very packed for me...but the tickets are totally worth it...I have renewed for next year already.
SJEarthquakes,3d9yxs,Quakes-JD,6,Tue Jul 14 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"""Weakened"" may be an overstatement. The Galaxy are still stacked with talent.  We are without Wondo and Cato (Clasico goal scorers), and so far this year our offense has a low goals per game stat.  Not impossible to steal an away game, but very difficult. The Houston loss at home was a real missed opportunity."
SJEarthquakes,3d9yxs,Arjen_01,3,Tue Jul 14 18:21:33 2015 UTC,I don't think we have scored a goal when Wondo has not been on the field. Which is a very pathetic stat.   I'm not expecting much come Friday.
SJEarthquakes,3d9yxs,QuakesWC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"The one thing that reminds me of last year's team is how we miss opportunities against the weaker teams. We have a great record against good teams like LA, Columbus, Seattle, Vancouver but we drop points against teams like RSL, Colorado, Houston. In the stacked West we can not afford those missed opportunities."
SJEarthquakes,3d9yxs,neclov,5,Tue Jul 14 22:37:28 2015 UTC,At least we can hopefully wax nostalgic watching a Wondo/Gordo reunion in the Gold Cup.
SJEarthquakes,3d9yxs,dgb422,2,Tue Jul 14 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"Gordo's on the 23-man Gold Cup roster?  Who did he take off to make room?  Edit: After a sluggish trip through the group stage, coach Jurgen Klinsmann chose to shake up his roster ahead of Saturday's quarterfinal in Baltimore. Beasley replaces Greg Garza, Corona takes the spot of Alfredo Morales and Gordon replaces Jozy Altidore.

Going in order to see what sort of roster Dom puts out, and how well he's prepared them. Should be a good test of Dom's ability to develop ""B team"" players.  Do we pass well? Are we capable of maintaining possession for extended periods of time? Can we play out of the back? Do we combine well in attacking third?

SJEarthquakes,3da8gu,bobby_guz_man,4,Tue Jul 14 19:09:59 2015 UTC,The parking at the stadium is a joke. It's way overpriced and a cluster F&$@ when you leave. Take public transport if you can if not park somewhere else and walk. It took almost as long as the match to get out of the Houston game.

SJEarthquakes,3da8gu,SanJoseNativetil,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree.  When the game ends, I casually walk to my car and leave without having to wait at all.

SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,sixsamurai,2,Mon Jul 13 05:28:48 2015 UTC,That ref was a mess. Super exciting Goonie Time goal for the win.

SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,usbduong33,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:51:55 2015 UTC,Can someone explain who this team is? Is it owned by SJ?  Burlingame is a nice name too.
SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,MisterChao,2,Mon Jul 13 07:16:52 2015 UTC,Premier Development League (U23) affiliate of the San Jose Earthquakes.
SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,thesockerguy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:13:10 2015 UTC,time to take them up to USL next year
SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,pbrrules22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"The organization, or this roster of players?  For the time being, the status of this roster of players, those who actually won the divisional championship, remains ""collegiate amateurs"". Of course, within a year or two, many of them could leave their collegiate status behind and become USL professionals.  If the Quakes were to convert Burlingame to a USL reserve team and have the PDL team shipped elsewhere, it would be nice to get off that ugly damn multi-purpose artificial turf and onto a natural grass pitch ‚Äì something more befitting a professional soccer organization."
SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,Arjen_01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:41:04 2015 UTC,the organization + some of the players.
SJEarthquakes,3d3g74,pbrrules22,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"Theoretically all these players could join USL next year. You're not forced to go through with 4 years of college. You can do 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, or 4. Doesn't matter."
