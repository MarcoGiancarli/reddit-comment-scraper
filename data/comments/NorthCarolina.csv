When the cops showed up, he (all allegedly) advanced at Kerrick aggressively and refused orders to stand down. The other 2 officers fired tasers at him and missed. Kerrick emptied a magazine at him, hitting him a bunch of times.  The toxicology report hasn't been released, but if he wasn't on drugs, something was definitely wrong with this guy when this happened.  Honestly, I'll be surprised if he doesn't walk."

NorthCarolina,3dyd73,BuckeyeWolf,6,Mon Jul 20 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"1) The abysmal record of truly prosecuting drunk driving crimes with any level of seriousness in this state (really, the U.S. in general, but NC seems worse than average), 2) the fact that the criminal in this situation is white, and at least one of the victims (the professor) was black."

I looked up some statistics and did the math, and found that in 2013 (the latest year for which I could find a solid amount of available data) 62% of drunk driving arrests in NC ultimately did not result in the driver actually being convicted on any charge. While I'm sure that there are a few cases here and there where a person was truly innocent, there's simply no way that 62% of all people who appeared to be driving drunk were actually just totally innocent of anything and deserved to get off scot free, and be back on the road.  As an aside, I'm not posting the link to where I found these stats because it's on a .edu site and those often don't have a ton of bandwidth, so I don't want it to get inadvertently overloaded by Reddit. But if you don't believe me, I'll happily PM you the link and you can even do the math yourself."

NorthCarolina,3dyd73,bartsmith,7,Mon Jul 20 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"If you look at that same data but toggle over to the ""county data"" radio button and then do the actual math, it tells a bit of a different story.

NorthCarolina,3dyd73,sblinn,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"The county data does not tell a different story.  It's all part of the statewide data and your conviction rate is wrong.  And yes, if people are found innocent then they should get off with no consequences.  That's how the justice systems works.  Everyone gets a fair trial and if they are found not-guilty they don't get punished.  You are arguing that anyone that gets arrested is automatically guilty.  That's not how the justice systems works."
NorthCarolina,3dyd73,jsz,0,Mon Jul 20 19:59:42 2015 UTC,There's a big jump from this to thinking that a 20-year-old who killed three people while driving drunk won't even be charged with a crime.

I'm sure it could go either way, but I'm not hopeful that he'll get what he actually deserves in this case, i.e. substantial jail time. I would be surprised if he got off with literally no consequence, of course, but getting your license revoked for a few months or paying a fine isn't what I'm talking about when I'm talking about actually being prosecuted."

NorthCarolina,3dy33t,Aurion7,6,Tue Jul 21 00:42:44 2015 UTC,"The spin on this new tax code is a bit misleading.  Families got hit the hardest with the changes due to the way the exemptions were changed.  Since they did away with all exemptions for having kids (yes we still get a small credit), your taxable income went up depending on how many kids you had.  This is easier to absorb if you are upper middle class or rich, especially if you only had a 1 or 2 kids.  As usual, lower to mid middle class families got hit the hardest.  My taxable income went way up, and the new standard deduction was mearly half of what I was able to deduct in the years prior.  As a result, although my taxable rate went down, my taxable income nearly doubled, costing me a ton at tax time.  To counter this, as a head of household of 5, I've had to change my W2 exemptions for NC to 0, simply to break even and not have to pay anything next April.  What I've learned as I've gotten older is that middle class families tend to get screwed no matter who's in charge.   Every single person in my office that has a family of 2 or more kids paid more in NC taxes last year.    I'm a bit torn on it, because although it hurts my situation personally, I get the idea of the system.  I shouldn't necessarily be able to exempt much of my income based on the number of kids I have, especially when that money goes to pay for schools."

The Justice Center’s analysis encompasses both income tax and sales tax. In conjunction with the overhaul of the income tax, the state sales tax was expanded beginning last year. Added to the sales tax list was, among other things, service contracts for appliances and cars and a broad range of admissions charges, including movies and sporting events.  The working poor in particular are taking it on the chin because of the elimination of the earned income tax credit, which was designed to help them make ends meet, Johnson said.  “That alone took over $100 million out of local communities,” he said, adding that more than 900,000 tax filers claimed the earned income credit a year ago. Taxpayers can still claim the credit on their federal income taxes."

I just want to second & third other's suggestion that you want to live in the Southern Pines area.  My husband works in the SF community on post and it's a 15 - 20 min commute for him to work. Quality of life is great and it's an easy commute to Bragg or the Triangle (45mins) We lived in Fayetteville for 12 years. Don't make the mistake we did, start out living in Moore County! :)"

In Gear Career  - there is a local chapter here in the Fort Bragg area, usually meets once a month (I'll admit, I've missed the last few). Great networking to be had.   Employment Readiness Program (used to be called ACAP)  Resources for the area for you. If you haven't secured a position by the time you PCS, my recommendation is to set up an appointment when you get here to Bragg.  Parking can be an issue  (they only have a few spaces) and they run classes, so walking in won't give you the most bang for your time, especially if you need assistance with a more specialized or detailed resume or targeted job search.   From one spouse in the special forces community to another, Welcome to Fort Bragg :)"
NorthCarolina,3dqwva,Cynner,2,Sat Jul 18 16:22:18 2015 UTC,"John Skvarla, the secretary of N.C. Commerce Department, pushed for more spending on shale-gas exploration during a state energy-panel meeting this week after state geologists said samples recently taken from Walnut Cove property indicated unconfirmed signs of shale gas, according to conservationists and commerce officials.  The meeting comes about a month after the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources paid drillers about $91,500 to dig a core hole 1,750 feet deep on property owned by Walnut Cove in the Walnut Tree community.  This week, State Geologist Ken Taylor said during the meeting that the samples include 323 feet of organic-rich material, according to Brooks Rainey Pearson, an associate attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.  The samples must still be analyzed — though DENR does not have money for the analysis, according to DENR officials.  Jeff Reid, a senior geologist, said during the meeting that there were good signs that the samples contain shale gas because the rock bubbled after being covered by soapy water, according to Rainey Pearson.  Those bubbles do not clearly confirm the presence of shale gas, Rainey Pearson said Friday.  Skvarla, citing the samples, said public money should be spent for more shale-gas exploration, possibly through a public-private consortium.  ((Dear NC elected officials.  Please do not spend any more ""public"" monies on this exploration.  If there is shale gas there, trust me, the gas and oil companies, as well as their wildcatters, huge trucks, excavation equipment, etc., until nausea -- oh, they will come.  AND they will do all of it on THEIR DIME.))"
