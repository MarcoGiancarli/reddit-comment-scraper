funkopop,3e485y,knightstalker1288,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:16 2015 UTC,Personally I think Jon will turn into a white walker and fight with them in the final battle. I have called this since the ep where the white walkers invade the wildling camp because the king guy stares down Jon as he makes the dead rise.
funkopop,3e4hmy,marnibeau,2,Tue Jul 21 22:00:10 2015 UTC,Thats a huge collection.  Its a bad idea to stack like this though. The weight put on the bottom few rows will cause the boxes to get damaged.
funkopop,3e4hmy,mathewryan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:34 2015 UTC,True on the stacking. They do sort of overlap like bricks so the weight is some what absorbed. But shelves are definitely in the future.
funkopop,3e4hmy,DarkJay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:30:57 2015 UTC,Damn! Nice variety and number. Yeah I'd only stack it for the collection picture

Yeah the Jake says its ($21) but it goes for almost $40 no while the ($40) mini is $20 the most. I'm gonna revalue everything later in that case

The cheapest other than that I've found was $80, other than an unboxed with a very sloppy paint job that was going for $55. I didn't mind paying more for him because he's the main one I've been wanting since i started collecting and put off ever buying because most sellers want at least $100."

funkopop,3e3yqq,PrinceHansel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"they are currently doing this with vault edition pops from the Star Wars line, not sure if they will continue this with other lines  also there is a GameStop upcoming releases list with Woody and Buzz, we don't know at this time if these will be re-releases or new molds  to answer your question yes they do re-release some items but not a lot. I think it has to do with the popularity of the line and of the individual figure. Personally I really want the Genie and Jafar figures but their price is way above what I am willing to pay. I personally am optimistic that we will see a re-release of them at some point since disney is such a large and popular line (plus they have to release an Aladdin figure at some point right?). Ace Ventura on the other hand was a little more of an obscure figure and while the demand is there to make its price rise it probably wouldn't move the same number of units that a Disney figure would, plus there may be more involved in licensing and such (no idea just speculation)"

funkopop,3e145m,NecroGi,6,Tue Jul 21 03:49:11 2015 UTC,"The only issue I have with their setup is that while pops are roughly in a sort of order, it's a bit of a jumble to find specific ones.  I'm also NOT a fan of the way they do the blind box minis.. they open them and sell individual figures, marking up for rare finds.  I like PopCultcha's setup more. Their store is sectioned to themes and relevant pops are in each area with other collectibles (star wars, Doctor Who, Marvel, DC, Disney etc.)"

I'd be ok with this, depending on how much they markup. Get most of them for regular price at other stores, get the last few you need guaranteed but a little more expensive.  Just started collecting the Avengers 2 mystery minis and I'm worried about get duplicates."
funkopop,3e145m,RadiantViper,2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:05 2015 UTC,"They mark up from standard figure at AU$15 to rarer finds at AU$20 generally. Extreme cases have been more. I understand the option of filling your collection easily, but have the option. If you're just starting out, part of it is the excitement of what's in the box! You can't do that here as they made the choice no to sell them unopened at all."
funkopop,3e145m,Dogued,2,Tue Jul 21 04:56:39 2015 UTC,"That's true if someone went to their store first without knowing about the blind packs, for sure.

I've been collecting for about 5 months and I started out collecting the Age of Ultron set, and it's almost complete, save for Unmasked Iron Man, the Shield Black Wido, and Scarlet Witch. Going after one set at the beginning gets you accustomed to the hobby and to ""the hunt."" It also helps with cost, because you're not grabbing everything you see.

funkopop,3e2l0a,spideyfanatic93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:05 2015 UTC,started the same way. Ghostbusters and Horror Icons. Went from about 10 to 90 since Christmas.
funkopop,3e2l0a,ghostbuster55,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:16 2015 UTC,Like someone above said. It's a real expensive hobby. I've spent around $450 in the past 30 days on Pops and this is my first month collecting but my collection is valued at around $850
funkopop,3e2l0a,graphitezor,2,Tue Jul 21 15:15:28 2015 UTC,I'm in a similar boat. This was my first experience with the SDCC exclsuives and I've gone a little overboard the last 2 weeks.
funkopop,3e2l0a,ghostbuster55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:43 2015 UTC,"I want to second /u/ghostbuster55's  suggestion to check out poppriceguide.com. There's no worse feeling than passing on a Rorschach or something, only to look online later and find out that it's a super-rare pop you'll never see again.   Additionally, if you ever find an exclusive pop and think ""If I buy this now, maybe I can sell it for more"", think twice. Like the rorschach I mentioned above, you could probably sell it for something close to it's listed value on poppriceguide, but only do that for things that are valued $50+. I've bought an exclusive Gamestop R2B1 once because it was exclusive and I had a free pop with this promotion, but just because it's exclusive doesn't mean it's rare.   Not to mention that flipping is often regarded with contempt here. If you're buying a rare pop from a small-town store to sell or trade to someone who wants it - that's one thing. But people don't take kindly to buying things exclusively to profit from reselling.   Check out the side-bar for rules regarding posting here. Pay attention to the stickies at the top of the subreddit here - the mods often ask for opinions and they're pretty eager to listen to the community."
funkopop,3e2l0a,cheddarhead4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"You should probably start with more common pops, that way you get the pops you like first without spending an arm and a leg for one thats rare.   In my first month of collecting I went from 1 pop to 3 to about 20 or so. It's probably best to buy 2-3 per pay check that way you don't go over board."

It's in reply to his statement ""I want it in the box."" It happened to result in others offering for the Pop. I didn't intend it, but if it helps someone get Raven (who is collecting dust on my shelf), then good. I'd be more concerned about people offering Pops they don't have on the designated trade posts, which has happened 3 times in the 2 weeks I've been on this sub."

I can't say who I pictured, but it wasn't him. Someone...nerdier. Actually, you know who I pictured? Gordon Freeman. On the other hand, Walder Frey Argus Filch David Bradley as Abraham was fantastic. Showing the Master so early really blew the suspense. I don't know, the whole thing came off as cheesy. I love Guillermo del Toro's movies, and I read Chuck Hogan's earlier book Prince of Thieves and thought it was fantastic. The Strain was such a letdown. It sets up this whole mythology-free vampire fiction, and by the end...well, I don't want to spoil it, but it doesn't live up to that promise. In fact, it takes that promise behind the shed and shoots it like Old Yeller."
