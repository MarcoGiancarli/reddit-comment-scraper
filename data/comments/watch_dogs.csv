watch_dogs,3dq0qx,remikavue,2,Sat Jul 18 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, hire this guy, Ubisoft. I like the way you think. The bit about not being able to conceal rifles brings to mind Hitman: Blood Money, and honestly having gang hideots approached in a style similar to that game would be amazing.  Things I'd add:  Make the profiler serve as a hint to what kind of person you're dealing with, with people not all acting the same. Cause havoc near someone with a concealed carry permit and a military background? They might open fire on you. Stop a thug from mugging a mentally unstable homeless man? The guy you saved might throw a punch at you and run away. Watch_Dogs is all about how information is power, so let us use information as power.  I'd also say it is VITAL that it not be possible to tell whether someone's in your game or not. If that means changing or removing Focus, then do it! The second you realize you can just pause the game or tap the Focus command to check for intruders the entire multiplayer becomes pointless. Also, I'd really like to be able to search for targets to hack without being magically teleported to near their location, that's not ""seamless drop-in drop-out multiplayer"" at all. Just match me with someone near me.  I totally agree with what you said about blending, I'd also have random NPCs sometimes do things that look like player actions (Running down the street, dashing across a road, sitting idle in their car talking on their phone, parkouring, hiding behind a dumpster to spy on their ex or something, etc.) To make it harder to instantly spot a player.  The big thing I want: Partner with Google to replace City Hotspots with Ingress. Playig Ingress across a virtual city would be amazing, complete with fields, linking, and rival players. The cool thing would be that when you get an alert that you're portal is being hacked, the game could automatically drop you into a game with the hacker so you could rush over and jam their phone, distract them, or just shoot them to stop the hack. It would fit really well thematically with Watch_Dogs, too.  Wow, I wrote a lot of opinions here in a few mintes, jeez."
watch_dogs,3dei7y,OcelotWolf,18,Wed Jul 15 17:22:30 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the game for a number of reasons.    I found some of the missions (both side and main) to be challenging enough to give me some headaches, but never so much that I just wanted to rage quit.  I thought the gunplay was solid, with a decent balance to make me feel like a badass, rather than a gun-toting death bringer.  I enjoyed the driving, as with a little experience, the vehicles felt appropriately tuned. The Camaro knockoff and the Charger knockoff both handed as I would expect the real-world versions to, give or take, and the growl of the engines was viscerally good.  Hacking is satisfying in that it can be useful as a tool and as a method of tormenting the AI bad guys. The city is big, and it's densely populated in most areas. Running the profiler showcases a lot of weird personalities in the city, which shows the depth that the developers put into making the place feel big, and aside from being useful as a game tool, it's also humorous.  I really liked the story. I liked Aiden as a character, and I felt caught up in the story missions. I wanted to continue, and as the plot unfolded, I was pleased with how things developed.   There were some things I didn't care for, as well. Sometimes, controls were skittish, and some of Aiden's movement can be frustrating (despite the parkour, he can't technically jump, so a two-foot gap between rooftops might as well be a mile). Some of the side missions and map unlocks can be repetitive, but if you've played an Ubisoft game, you know exactly what you're getting into. I actually felt overwhelmed with weaponry options, on occasion, as you can carry literally every gun in the game at any time -- not bad in theory, but there are a lot of guns, so it get's tiresome scrolling for the one you want, and I tended to focus on two guns specifically just for ease of use.   This is all just my opinion, but for what it's worth, you'd be well-served at just $10. I thought it was entertaining, which is all I want from my games. I bought it on PS3 for around $30, I think, and enjoyed it enough that I paid another $15 for the PS4 version in anticipation of getting that system in the near future."
watch_dogs,3dei7y,InhumanTarget,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"I just now remembered that I was on the verge of getting it for PS3 when I decided to just wait until I got my PS4. I'll probably end up getting it, I'm sure I could get my money's worth of fun out of the game. And thank you for your response!"
watch_dogs,3dei7y,InhumanTarget,6,Wed Jul 15 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"No problem. Hope it helped.   Thinking about it, I probably put a good 50 hours into it, at least. I didn't do everything, but I did a good bit of it -- enough to get me some of the choice unlocks, anyway (better guns, some costumes, skills). I didn't ever go online with it, though... not my thing."
watch_dogs,3dei7y,spiral6,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"I did the same as you, all events except driving, all weapons, and the story.   Have you played the Bad Blood DLC? If not, I highly recommend it. Way better story and voice acting, T-Bone is a much more enjoyable character than Aiden. More events like the Street Sweep missions, which are quite enjoyable. New gadgets like the infinitely tasing OP RC Car. This DLC is worth it, because the others are complete shit."
watch_dogs,3dei7y,jazdk4,6,Wed Jul 15 23:18:32 2015 UTC,It's definitely worth $10. Go for it.
watch_dogs,3dei7y,EpicStreamMan,3,Wed Jul 15 19:53:40 2015 UTC,"Game is totally worth it. I got it when it first came out a $60 last year and still play it almost every week in 2015. After the main campaign (about 6-10 hrs), side missions (2-4 hrs), digital trips (2-4 hrs), there is the Multiplayer Online Hacking modes which are very innovative and addicting. Online hacking keeps me coming back for more every time and I usually skip most multiplayer modes. You will more than get your monies worth out of it if it seems like you enjoy the themes of this game at all. Good luck ;c)"
watch_dogs,3dei7y,ConnerVonHerd,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:07 2015 UTC,6-10 hours? I'm playing through it for the second time and it seems much longer than that. Like at least 20 hours.
watch_dogs,3dei7y,EpicStreamMan,2,Fri Jul 17 06:35:56 2015 UTC,Ya my play through was much longer too because I like to explore and mix it up with side missions and online hacking. All depends on how you play I was just trying to give a fair estimate on content hours. World record speed running can complete all main missions in around 3 1/2 hrs. Even with the crippling skill point reset bugs I still love this game and will even be playing it tonight on my birthday ;c)
watch_dogs,3dei7y,ConnerVonHerd,2,Fri Jul 17 13:33:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess if you blew through the missions back to back but man it would be hard because of the lack of skills and time to buy guns.
watch_dogs,3dei7y,twiceoftheheart,2,Fri Jul 17 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the open world map. One of the things that drew me to this game was that it was set in Chicago, my home city. The hacking is a really fun concept, whether you're stealth-ing using cameras or escaping a car chase. And I think Aiden is badass."

watch_dogs,3dei7y,redtail42,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"The reason this game has had so much hate and bad publicity is because ubisoft hyped this game up to be a groundbreaking game that would lead games into the next generation. It wasn't. However, that's not a valid reason to dismiss the game. It's quite a bit of fun, it looks great on next-gen consoles and good PCs, and it costs next to nothing because of how unpopular it is. Don't get me wrong, the game has its faults, but overall it's still a pretty damn fun 3rd person shooter."
watch_dogs,3dei7y,infiniium1,2,Thu Jul 16 07:25:57 2015 UTC,"You can read a lot on the web that the main character is bland, the story is flat, and the game is glitchy. What I think though is all this is crap, the story was okay, Aiden is badass, and the game runs fine with a few exceptions (I'm on PC mind you, you shouldn't have any trouble on PS4). The world is awesome, single-player campaign was fun to do, although some side missions were repetitive indeed. However, the game shines in online hacking mode, which I think is the best. I can't stop playing it, and even if I don't have the time or opportunity to play I watch others on YouTube or Twitch. A fcking addiction.  I say go for the $10 buy, it will totally worth it. Especially if you're on PS4 which I think has the biggest player base."

watch_dogs,3dei7y,hitraj47,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:42:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly the main issues with the game were technical ones, which really only applied to PC. Since you said you are getting it preowned, I am assuming you're getting it for a console. At $10 it's a good buy.   The gameplay itself - it has a lot to do in it besides the main story, but a lot of the mini games get a little repetitive (IMO). They're still fun to complete though. I am currently replaying it because I recently upgraded and I'm enjoying it.  EDIT: I also don't play any of the multiplayer. I'm just not interested. I do let fixers invade my world though, adds a bit of uncertainty to the game which I like."

watch_dogs,3da52f,dellett,4,Tue Jul 14 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Yes you can use a keyboard to steer in both games. Watch Dogs is a bit different than GTA in that the various car types all handle differently. I actually prefer Watch Dogs driving more once you get used the the car types there just is more too it.

watch_dogs,3d8nj6,Milk4Life,31,Tue Jul 14 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"The video shown at E3 before it came out was graphically wayyy better than the actual game, and this made people sour on it. Although there's a mod that tries to bring it to E3 level graphics by someone named TheWorse. Plus the story was just lazy about a lot of things, and it left me feeling disappointed at the end."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,DigChrono,17,Tue Jul 14 11:49:46 2015 UTC,"This ^ is the main problem many people have with the game.  Ubisoft showed the world a game that looked amazing, significantly better than what we got.  The game was clearly and severely down-graded before it was released, probably to make sure it could run on consoles and still look the same on all platforms.  People don't like being shown one thing, and then given another thing.  It's not that hard to understand the frustration.  There's a difference between 'hype' and blatant lies to get people to buy your product.    This is especially frustrating because Ubisoft insists that they didn't change anything, but TheWorse mod actually found/unlocked the graphics that we saw (for the most part) in the E3 demo, it WAS STILL IN THE GAME which seems to prove that Ubisoft did downgrade their own product just to ensure they could get more overall sales via consoles.  That's their prerogative, I understand they want to make as much money as they can, but it's disappointing as a consumer to intentionally not be given the best version of their product, especially after having been shown it.  That said, I really enjoyed this game.  I was disappointed by many things, but it was still a good game overall, I had a great time playing it and felt like they did a lot of neat new things.  I'm just weary of their business practices, and they basically ruined my excitement for The Division (another Ubisoft game) that appears to be suffering the same treatment (Incredible E3 demo, then steady downgrades to make sure it will actually run on ""next gen"" consoles, leading ultimately to a watered-down release.)"
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,archangel924,3,Tue Jul 14 13:15:10 2015 UTC,"I have similar fears about The Division. I enjoyed Watch Dogs very much, and I didn't really have problems with the graphical downgrades, but I'm on PS4, not PC. But I fully sympathize with PC users who felt disappointed.  But after the AC:Unity fiasco, Ubisoft has a lot to make up for."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,Farscape29,5,Tue Jul 14 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"Ha! Assassins Creed. I loved the first one. It's still my favorite, and I've played all of them except  Black Flag and the ones after that. It was an interesting story with a lot of potential, but then the yearly release schedule drove the story (and mechanics) into the ground. Now it's just derivative and poorly written, which is a shame because there was a lot of hype about the hidden symbols at the end of the first one. Also: Ezio is pompous and I can't stand him."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,DigChrono,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"I never even got past the first one. Although everyone said 2, 3 and BF were great. I really want The Division to be good, I really do. I like the story and the mechanics that I've seen so far.  Being a married, father of 2, and a career, my money and time are spare. So if I'm going to drop $60 on a game, it had damn well better be a finished, polished product."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,Farscape29,3,Tue Jul 14 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"I played 1, 2 & 3 after 3 I was done...qell at least I thought...I was offered a trade and Black Flag was in the deal. It's actually reeeally good! Its huge! I didnt think if like it maybe trya nd use it as leverage in a different trade but I tossed it on...how can I not? And I was not disappointed!"
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,DJ_Lud,0,Tue Jul 14 19:13:55 2015 UTC,Yes but it was for performance and if people really cared about it they would mod it and modding isn't hard

watch_dogs,3d8nj6,SirSweatsalot,3,Wed Jul 15 08:07:11 2015 UTC,"This was one of the leading factors of hate towards Ubisoft. FarCry was becoming a cash-cow that was poorly taken care of. Then Watch Dogs hit PC with graphics that would match the 360, while the E3 in-game videos looked absolutely amazing. It was then discovered that they actually dumbed down the graphics on purpose relatively close to launch. Once the better graphics were unlocked (note: unlocked.. not used) through simple modding, the game ran smoother for most PC players and it looked better for those who could up the quality. Then once people actually got into the game, they discovered that it was a victim of over-hype. I loved the game, personally, but I couldn't warrant any replay in it. Others simply hated it for not meeting their expectations.    And on the topic of Ubisoft, they then had the fiasco with Assassin's Creed Unity becoming the most buggy AAA release in recent history."

watch_dogs,3d8nj6,VenomB,3,Tue Jul 14 14:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as OP. I love the gameplay, I like being able to stealth through the entire game if you really want to. I know holding down a button isn't really hacking, but it's still very much entertaining/engaging to me to set up the enemy to walk into an explosion, use lures, etc.   I do think a lot of people feel Aiden was a really bland protagonist and I tend to agree with that. The game probably would've been better if T-Bone were the main character. That said, he's not unbearable or anything like that."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,pjd1645,6,Tue Jul 14 16:27:50 2015 UTC,"bland   This is a very interesting word and one I hear a lot to describe Aiden.   People seem to interpret his ""blandness"" as simply him being a boring, poorly-written character, but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, Aiden is not boring, but neutral. He doesn't necessarily have clearly spoken goals or constantly show off his personality, not because he's boring, but because he's meant to represent YOU. You, the fixer. You, the vigilante looking over the people of Chicago or You, the menace who strikes fear into the hearts of the inhabitants of his city. The reputation system, along with Aiden's plain character and your free choice as to what to do on the streets of Chicago mean that each Aiden will be different, and each will represent their own players' personalities.  In short, Aiden is ""bland"" because that leaves room for our own choices and personalities."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,pjd1645,2,Tue Jul 14 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest, bland probably wasn't the right word. I just felt like I wanted Aiden to embrace what he actually was rather than trying to portray some half-assed moral code on an inconsistent basis.  I also think some of the ""issues"" w/ Aiden are due to the popularity of T-Bone. Agree with a lot of what you said though."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,Svardskampe,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"To me, the crap gameplay. It was just the same thing over and over again. ""kill or run out of baddies"". The hacking minigame was worth nothing and all the hacking itself was not meaningful. I was thinking some hacker duality or uplink - level of stuff. (alike Deus Ex human revolution, but more worked out as they focused so much about this hacking part). Instead, I got a worse hacker game than Deus Ex, which didn't even focus on that aspect.   Maybe there was some mega man battle network - spray of hope involved."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,ueyuro,7,Tue Jul 14 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"I love this game, but what I have read from several posts on internet:  1) It is from Ubisoft. People love to hate Ubisoft.  2) It is nothing like GTA. No flying. Vehicle handling is not so good.  3) Stutters on PC."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,ueyuro,5,Tue Jul 14 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't describe the handling as ""not so good"". It's different, true, but it feels drifty and just fun."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,NSFW895,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:55:25 2015 UTC,"In my first playthrough, it was very hard and unpredictable with keyboard, like GTA4. In other games, front wheels turn instantly, in this game they turn slowly."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,ueyuro,2,Tue Jul 14 12:11:34 2015 UTC,"So you mean Watch_Dogs drives like real life then? I had to figure that out with GTA V too, that and WD reflect how real cars handle (slow turning, constant braking on turns, acceleration is slow on most cars, flat tires make a car useless, backing up is slow as fuck)  and when you realize that, driving becomes easier. I don't mean they simulate it exactly, but it is more realistic."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,NSFW895,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's not as realistic as GTA4. Taking turns in GTA4 was impossible in very high speed. Problem with Watch_Dogs is, wheels should turn left or right instantly as side arrow keys are pressed. But they take like half a second to turn. It feels laggy on keyboard, but fine for controllers. GTA5 driving is nowhere realistic."

watch_dogs,3d8nj6,ueyuro,2,Tue Jul 14 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"The reasoning for point 1 is because of your point 3. Basically the main reason I was disappointed with W_D was the horrible performance for not-as-good-as-E3 graphics. I didn't have a great system, but the stuttering was terrible, even with everything turned down.  I now have a badass gaming rig and it still stutters, unless I add the -disablepagefilecheck to the .exe. The game also has a weird mouse movement - I think it's autoaim? But it feels 'floaty' and doesn't move 1:1 - really frustrating.  Now that I'm replaying it, with TheWorseMod, it's a decent game. But Ubi basically showed PC gamers how they feel about them."
watch_dogs,3d8nj6,hitraj47,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, this game has terrible performance, but it doesn't mean to hate on company. These type of big games are usually targeted to gamers who don't much care. Ubisoft makes lot of small games that work flawlessly. Take an example of Rayman Legends, if your computer can run Aero on Windows 7, it can play Rayman Legends at 60 fps."

I consider myself a 'hardcore' gamer and was really looking forward to W_D.  It's not just W_D either. Ubisoft had other games with performance issues and then there was the stuff about DRM.  Personally I am not an AC fan so I have no idea what issues came up with that, I think it was mainly DRM. FC3 performed well for me and I've played many Ubi games in the past, most notable Splinter Cell series that have worked really well.  I think in general as well, especially PC gamers being sick of the technical difficulties with games, especially ones that were multiplatform. This was just another game added to that list."

Overall the story was flat Structure was very much like other Ubi games, Go to town, unlock more of map. people where expecting more? For me the big one was the crappy driving physics. People were into the hype   Overall I didn't fall into this hype and still think this was a great $60 game. I felt that it was refreshing enough that things like the tower unlocks didn't bother me. If this game had a good story then I would have considered it a fantastic game, maybe ubisoft's best game of recent times. (I never played the DLC for reference)"

It's just the inconvenience of having a second platform from which running games. You have to have an account, add it there and download it. Of course, you need the Uplay client. The game once downloaded is file-check-able, that means that you can from the Uplay client check if the game files are all in order in the folder (as in steam). But, in case you have an issue, they're overbooked, really, you can get help but it'll take time and if you don't describe precisely enough what are the circumstances of the bug, they won't be able to help (as with other tech supports).   Conclusion: No, Uplay is not that bad. But, where are you getting the game for 2€? It shows me on the Uplay store the most vanilla edition is at 29.99€. I'd be wary of your sources."

watch_dogs,3c4fwa,Anach,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"Got the hack by exploiting the map. He may have found you if you played within the rules, even if he walked passed the first time. Cheap win."
watch_dogs,3c4fwa,RainWornStone,3,Sun Jul 5 06:51:03 2015 UTC,"Which ""rules"" are these?"
watch_dogs,3c4fwa,Anach,2,Sun Jul 5 11:15:52 2015 UTC,"Ones that don't involve exploiting grenade jumps and glitching through walls and objects to reach normally unreachable areas so you can hide from people. Tricks are tricks, and it's a cheap way to play. There are lots of videos that show skilful players that are simply good at not getting caught, without exploiting the game world.   Players like this are why I stop playing most multiplayer games. Nothing ruins a good session more than boats flying through the air in Battlefield, or glitching under the terrain in GTAO, etc."
watch_dogs,3c4fwa,Anach,2,Sun Jul 5 13:12:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest I never really thought of it that way, but from a new defenders perspective I can see how that might be frustrating or cheap. I've always been a bit conflicted on how broken this game can be by doing some of these ""tricks"" as you say. When I had them done to me in the past I personally just wanted to know how I could do these things. I searched forums and Youtube videos and even Twitch Live streams of other players and learned from them. It really opened up my world and taught me new ways to explore and new advanced skills to learn so I can climb and reach new places. I guess I never saw it as a ""cheap"" way to hack and win but just as a new interesting and challenging way to do it. However maybe that does go beyond the true intentions of the Online Hacking Game mode. I think I will try more ""normal"" hacking for a while and see what kind of challenge I can get out of that. Thank you for your thoughts and if anyone else has something to say on the matter I'd love to hear more on this type of conversation. Like what is acceptable? Just anything  you can normally climb too with out bombs? I know some glitched area's are accessible with out any special techniques or skills, are those okay? What do you all think?"
watch_dogs,3c4fwa,Anach,2,Mon Jul 6 14:27:36 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely good for exploring in single-player, just not good for multi-player. I mean, how is someone supposed to catch you up there, even if they know about the glitches to get there. By the time they have done so, the time is up, or they are dead anyway, depending on the mission. Testing the limits and finding glitches is always going to happen in online games, but they really do ruin gameplay. As for what's acceptable. Well the reason I stopped playing Counter-strike years ago was because almost everyone uses hacks (even on vat protected servers), and once everyone is doing it, it becomes a case of having to do it too, or not bother playing. It completely changes the game; CS became a game of who is the best at pretending not to hack, because it was no longer about tactics or quick reflexes. Games with less support for multiplayer, like Watch Dogs, are also a problem, because things don't get fixed, and it becomes the new normal way to play."
watch_dogs,3c4fwa,RainWornStone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:32:22 2015 UTC,Now would this Video be consider a legit hack? I only use some climbing skill to get to my hiding spot which I could easily be found with line of site if they just looked up. Seems fair to me. I do show off a glitched spot that I could have used in the same area afterwards just for fun ;c)

Europe is the past, which is why an Assassin's Creed title is better suited for London.   Those ""older"" buildings are also pretty shitty for upgrades, European resistance to progress is such that they label every other bar as an 'artifact"".   Watch_Dogs is more of a sci fi adventure than a historical fiction and thus America, and China are better suited for locations than stagnant and boring Europe.

watch_dogs,3bz181,TheRealRailguy,2,Fri Jul 3 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"US major cities are the best settings for Watch_Dogs titles.   Less regulation, heavy base for tech companies as mentioned by Skydragon000, powerful local politics as opposed to the rest of the world so politics can be corrupted easily with Blackmail.   Aiden Pearce for all his heroism, is very much a local guy, so is Lucky Quinn.... to replicate something like that in Brussels, Paris or London is hard because they're ruled by national (and in the case of Brussels, EU) interests.   You'd lose a major part of the story by not including big players due to the budget of one game.

Very tricky climb though definitely takes some practice. You got to climb up to this tiny rail from a small pipe (gun climb really helps here). Then make your way over by the big pipes with out falling off. Then do a perfect bomb jump on the the big pipe while carefully walking it to bomb jump onto the upper roof area.

watch_dogs,3bo8ky,genchris,12,Tue Jun 30 20:20:28 2015 UTC,The only good that came of Watch Dogs is that now I just wait a few weeks for reviews and complaints about games to come out rather than pre-ordering based off of an E3 demo.
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,lulz4tron,4,Tue Jun 30 22:34:50 2015 UTC,"I know it's beating a dead horse but the concept of pre-ordering is so odd to me in this day and age.  Pre-ordering was a concept back in the day when physical copies where in limited supply and to pre-order a game was to secure yourself a copy of that game.  If memory serves, the only game I've ever pre-ordered was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  With the advent of digital distribution, there is really no need for pre-ordering at all.  I will admit that there are probably some fringe cases in which pre-ordering is still a way to secure a physical copy but certainly not to the point where promotions are almost literally shoving it down our throats.  What's worse is all the incentive they pack behind it to make purchasing it a more seemingly viable decision.  I think with time we'll hopefully see the decline of pre-order culture and move past it.  Big changes do take time so be patient.  I think the gaming public at large is starting to see the bigger problem with this culture and is wising up to it.  Hopefully, with this shift in culture, we can purchase games that actually work and function as advertised on launch day instead of being fucked over like we have so many, many times before."
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,WinterholdMage,4,Wed Jul 1 02:38:08 2015 UTC,"It's simple: Games cost a ridiculous amount in some places and retailers will offer significant discounts if you preorder.  Getting 30% off by preordering a bunch of games around E3, that I can cancel individually, just makes more sense than paying $80 plus tax."
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,sdesaulniers,2,Wed Jul 1 06:30:45 2015 UTC,The concept also revolves around marketing. It helps publishers know exactly how many people are more likely to purchase your game and project sales for investors. Although pre orders can be cancelled it still gives them a general idea how well the product is being promoted or not.
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,Turtlegalore,2,Wed Jul 1 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"TBH it wasn't Watch_Dogs that turned me off on pre-ordering (I genuinely enjoyed the game, but the replay value unfortunately wasn't there, and lots of missed potential), it's actually Ubisoft's other game, Assassin's Creed: Unity.  Otherwise, I agree with everything you said."
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,BluetoothMcGee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"the exclusive extra missions for pre-order still get me sometimes, but they can keep all of the extra weapons, clothes, collectibles etc. But Ubi has lost e as a pre-order after this game and AC: Unity."
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,klitchell,3,Wed Jul 1 11:55:40 2015 UTC,"Funny. Kind of true, disagree on the hacking part, it is fine as is. The game is super fun though. My time currently is divided between Witcher 3 and Dragon Age Inquisition, but I'll get back to Watch Dogs soon."

LoL some of this was funny because it's true. Still love the game though. Haters gunna hate but this game is fun. Especially the Online Hacking. Also Jordi is the best character ;c)
watch_dogs,3bo8ky,EpicStreamMan,2,Tue Jun 30 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"Fun game, enjoyed it even though I was disappointed at the downgrade and pretty poor optimization for PC at initial launch.  I got bored near the end though, the majority of side missions were carbon copies of each other in different locations (clear this gang hideout, stop this convoy etc).  I felt really overpowered and was just going through the motions of picking off guys one at a time without even getting detected.  Oddly, the hardest and most interesting part of this game is during the final car chase when the bad guy (forget his name) is hacking the city while you drive through it.  The game needed more of that, bad guys who can hack and troll you just as hard as you can troll them.  The game reminded me a lot of the first Assassins Creed.  It was good, but really repetitive.  I'd expect the second game to really step up the way AC2 did.  The morality system suffered because of the story.  Here you are, supposedly the good guy trying to find justice for your niece and you're stealing from peoples bank accounts, driving like a complete maniac through the streets.  This is all your choice, but the sequel really needs to open up the morality system and let you decide how you want your character to be.  Red Dead Redemption comes to mind, a character who used to be scum now trying to right his wrongs, or do you go back to your old ways as you progress through the story?  Looking forward to the sequel, just hoping they give it the AC2 treatment"
watch_dogs,3bozob,Pie23,3,Tue Jun 30 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah happened with me too, I'd recommend finish whatever fixer missions and driving quests you got to unlock it. Seems to be the only thing that helps."

watch_dogs,3bn0no,EpicStreamMan,3,Tue Jun 30 15:10:22 2015 UTC,Here is an amazing spot to explore that my buddies Kou Ichi and Gabytomdq on Youtube helped me with. It requires a precision stunt jump with a bike off of this train tracks bridge in the loop to a building in mad mile. You need to hit the area to east of the big ctOS sign on this building or you wont be able to walk the ledge around to the fire escape. If you make it  you'll need to bomb jump onto the fire escape for the long climb up then bomb jump finally up to the top of the building. It's not rally practical to do in a hack though I would love to try someday. However a very awesome place to check out with a little glitch area on the roof and an amazing view of the city from the top. ;c) Location: N11 on the Hack Map  Check out GabyTomDq's other sweet videos: LINK  Check out Kou ichi's other awesome videos: LINK

Then when I drove forward a bit more there was a 'driving' pedestrian floating in the air like he was driving a car, stationary in the middle of the freeway."
watch_dogs,3bifd0,_Burgers_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:57:03 2015 UTC,I was playing earlier when I decided to prevent a nearby crime. I get there and no one is about so I check up the stairs and still can't find anyone. I hear someone getting robbed and jump over the balcony. When I land I realise they are inside the wall of the stairs. The person got away while the criminal just stood there. I could see their outline through the wall and the only way I could catch him was with the destroyer through the wall.

watch_dogs,3as60a,toffee_fapple,5,Tue Jun 23 02:04:23 2015 UTC,I have the PS4 version but have played the Wii U version and seen it streamed on Twitch a bunch. It is basically a copy of the PS3/Xbox360 versions. So it has lower graphical fidelity then PS4/Xbone versions. So area's like roof tops and stuff are mission extra details like vents and a/c units and stuff. As far as I've heard Ubisoft doesn't plan on patching it or releasing any of the DLC for it either sadly. But hey play it on what you can man. Enjoy ;c)
watch_dogs,3as60a,EpicStreamMan,6,Tue Jun 23 02:21:04 2015 UTC,"I have the Wii U version. Granted, I only have a Wii U as far as current-gen consoles go, so it was my only option, and I was excited the Wii U was getting a game like this.  It runs ""okay"". Loading times are very slow. Once you're in world, things are as seamless as other versions, though if you hop on a train or are driving fast enough you might end up seeing some glaring texture pop in when you get to a new area. Draw distance is a bit limited, as is traffic volume, so you'll see cars fade in/out not TOO far away. (In online racing I once had a car fade in right in front of me and I smashed into it, though I think that was also a matter of bandwidth/ping). Lighting is good at times, but super flat a lot of other times. It doesn't look BAD, but it doesn't have the visual polish you'd get from the One or PS4 versions. Though the best visuals are during rain or after a shower when the sun is out and reflections are everywhere.  Framerate is not steady in the slightest. It never gets REALLY bad, but it runs 30 and usually sub-30 especially when driving. This is the one thing I wish they had polished up, since the Wii U should have enough horsepower to keep things smoother than they end up being.  Sound mixing is really bad. SFX are delayed and some of them (gunshots, punches) are super loud (the intro to the game in particular makes this somewhat obvious). The screaming when you stop a train is almost comical how loud it is compared to other SFX in the game - and I think only the Wii U has this issue.  I don't think there have been any patches. There is the odd freezing bug mostly when trying to connect to a new online opponent, or sometimes near the beginning of the game, but it's pretty rare.  If it's cheap, I think it's worth it. If you have your Wii U online, it's definitely worth it if you want a fun online experience. Online hacking is super fun - and super populated. I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds to find an opponent. Usually I find one in < 10 seconds. OH! And I've used the GamePad only mode a lot more than I thought I would."
watch_dogs,3as60a,_Burgers_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:27:39 2015 UTC,It's good. Sure the frame rate might not be perfect but you get used to it after a short time. The Wii U is my only current gen console and I love watch dogs.
watch_dogs,3as60a,lilmc01,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"wii U lol   Compared to PS4 and PC, the frame rate is total garbage. Its more like the PS3 and XB360 versions, but the frame rate is lower (from what i have noticed on my friends WiiU) than the PS3 and the graphics are about the same, if not worse. Not any patches that i heard of. If you just want to play for the story and its super cheap then go ahead."

watch_dogs,3apj0y,Mattytipz,4,Mon Jun 22 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"1) If you are using silenced pistol and getting headshots, there's not much difference at all. Game is significantly more fun if you go about it quietly rather than going all Rambo. I do believe you'll level up faster going the stealth route.   2) Focus skills are what I would go for first. I'd also go for the crafting section heavily (IED, Proximity IED's, etc) - don't go for the ATM boosts unless you care about buying cars.   3) I personally like to unlock the CTOS towers, but you don't have to do them all before starting the campaign - the fast travel unlocks are really nice if you are trying to just rip through the game quickly though  4) Some criminal convoys let you just kill the target, some make you knock the target down. Use explosives/traps for the ones where you have to kill the target. You're doing the ""knock them down"" style convoys just fine.   5) Gang hideouts are absolutely worth it and I really do enjoy them. The other ones are useful too, just look at the progression wheel and do the side missions that give the best unlocks.  The chess mini game is really important too for the extra focus skill as well.   You get a skill point (you get 2 after a certain stage of the game) for every single gang hideout you complete. If you want to unlock everything quickly, that's definitely the way to go."

The key is to get a Fire Truck at the East End of this Bridge at 5pm. So what we did was rested until 4pm (16:00) to give us some time to get the Truck to the spot near this camp site by 5pm. I've heard it helps to move around and move the camera around to pass time quicker in game shrug, but hey it worked. Listen to one of the Dev's kids sing a little song over the Dispatch Radio. Pretty Kool. ;c) Location: N0 on my Map  There is also one with an Ice Cream Truck at the same location that I'll have to see if I can get too ;c)"

The time travel allows for much freedom in that regard.  But then there's the Unity bugfest with retarded DLCs / ingame purchases. Syndicate already looks boring to me. It's mostly texture work for the new city and otherwise offers nothing interesting or new that couldn't be implemented within a few days and I don't like the assassin/british thug mix. Then there's handheld games (including terrible PC ports) and Chronicles, another cash grab spinoff.  Ubisoft are absolutely ruthless when it comes to monetizing their franchises and it sucks."

They really took a few punches over the whole ""graphics downgrade"" thing, so I think they'd be a bit more cautious and maybe we'll get news only 1 year before release as opposed to 2+ years. Also, it's no longer a new IP so I don't expect them to push the hype as much as they did last time, which also kind of bit them in the ass."

watch_dogs,3a14xm,NSFW895,6,Tue Jun 16 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of people saying the graphics downgrade affected them. They still sold millions of copies and Watch_Dogs was a super profitable game for them. Regurgitating the same ""graphics hurr durr"" just shows that you only see what people on the internet are saying where people who complain are the loudest.  Realistically and in reality, more people had no problems with Watch_Dogs graphics than those who did. Unless someone can provide a direct source saying that the graphics downgrade on PC hurt their sales (which it didn't) then continually saying it makes no sense. People do this on Reddit too much."
watch_dogs,3a14xm,AquatikJustice,5,Tue Jun 16 15:04:45 2015 UTC,"Defensive much?  As someone who didn't have an issue with the graphics and enjoyed the game VERY much, that doesn't eliminate the fact that a large, vocal portion of the player base was quite unhappy with how the game ended up looking when compared with the original E3 footage shown. Add to that the list of features that were dropped (including some features that were promised literally DAYS before the release of the game that were nowhere to be found) and you get a lot of criticism being thrown at Ubisoft for ""trumped up hype"" and some even screaming ""false advertising"".  Nobody has to hit a certain arbitrary number that you set to prove and validate people's own personal feelings about a game. As misplaced as they may be, those are criticisms that have been constantly thrown around because people genuinely had a problem with it. Does that mean that EVERYBODY saw it as an issue? No. Does that mean that a MAJORITY saw it as an issue? No. It does mean that there were enough people who did see it as an issue to cause a stink that even Ubisoft themselves made a reference to last night during their E3 presentation."

watch_dogs,3a14xm,superus3r,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:41:28 2015 UTC,"The criticism didn't come from the graphic downgrade itself, but the fact that their games have constantly got worse over the last years. WD was objectively a very good game, but the players were fed up by Ubisoft's bullshit to the point that it ended in a shitstorm.  Look at The Witcher 3.

The only game they showed that I wasn't pumped for was Assassin's Creed.  Edit: Ubisofts conference was in no way lackluster just because some people only want to play Assassin's Creed for the 40th time. They're really pushing open world multilayer, gameplay mechanics and graphics -  just look at some of the behind the scenes stuff for The Division. It's okay that some people aren't as excited for all the games they're making, but they were in no way lackluster."

Other than that, in my opinion, you should play the game with a controller. It allows you to have, say, controllable acceleration with cars and generally makes the driving and playing more pleasant. On the other hand, it worsens your aim.   Last but not least, I think the best idea is to start directly playing on the hardest difficulty, and tone it down from there if you can't make it. I found the whole experience to be better with the difficulty maxed out."
watch_dogs,39lmes,MoonALM13,2,Fri Jun 12 17:30:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! Great suggestions.
watch_dogs,39lmes,on2wheels,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:32:42 2015 UTC,Is it safe to assume the game hasn't been updated by Ubisoft to incorporate any of these upgrades?
watch_dogs,39lmes,MoonALM13,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is strictly modding. Ubisoft has to make it work for the most people possible that's the reason for the ""downgrade"". I think, now that they've started working on optimisation issues on PC, the next one will be way better in that respect."
watch_dogs,39lmes,RaiderDuck,9,Sat Jun 13 21:40:27 2015 UTC,I would concentrate on getting the CTOS towers unlocked and fired up as soon as you can. It opens up all of the side missions you can do for $$$.

watch_dogs,39lmes,Shniggles,3,Sat Jun 13 01:04:01 2015 UTC,"I've played through this game about 3.5 times. Every time I start, I do online tailing ASAP. The suppressed Vector is my most used gun."

watch_dogs,39lmes,NarWhatGaming,3,Fri Jun 12 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"Gather up as much money as possible, and get the nicer weapons.  They'll help you complete missions, like the Destroyer.  It makes the game a cakewalk for the most part.  If anyone else is still playing online, learn good hiding spots for hacking.  If you're hacked, it helps to know where they'll likely be hiding.  My favorite is the train station.  There's three levels- ground, station, and rooftop.  Using a combination of all three will almost always guarantee a winning hack."
watch_dogs,39lmes,EpicStreamMan,2,Sat Jun 13 03:53:17 2015 UTC,Spend Skill Points first for Crafting & Hacking Abilities like ATM boost and what not to get $$ quicker. Money is very important at the beginning of the for Guns and Ammo and crafting items. Oh and only buy 5 Star Guns don't waste your money on anything else because you'll either find them for free during missions or just are a waste of money otherwise. First gun I recomened saving up for is the 5 Star Grenade Launcher (I like $50K). Then do at least 10 Criminal Convoy Side Missions to unlock the Destroyer Sniper Rifle (best gun in the game).
watch_dogs,39lmes,Richumz,2,Fri Jun 12 18:53:55 2015 UTC,The online invasions (hacking & tailing) won't be available until you complete the first batch of story missions. So race through those missions and then you can take part in the best part of the game....  online hacking . And tailing.

watch_dogs,39l88z,cornercurve,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:43:39 2015 UTC,After lots of tries using a Rocket Car Steam Pipe jump to get up here I find out that you can just climb up using a really tricky bomb jump. The key is to use a gun to aim your bomb placement exactly like I show here. Trust me it took a few tries at first but this spot can definitely be used in a hack now.

OP, I think if you disable people automatically entering your game, and never go online yourself, you should probably be fine. I haven't heard anything about Ubisoft completely banning people from UPlay for cheating, though I think they do a sort of ""shadowban"" which means that cheaters would only ever be paired with other cheaters.  However, I'm not an official source, so caveat emptor. If you're having trouble with a section, first try turning down the difficulty and see if that helps."
watch_dogs,39g843,EpicStreamMan,3,Thu Jun 11 14:47:50 2015 UTC,Wow just found a way to climb up to this area. Wow and after all those failed Rocket Car Jump attempts. Don't know if I should be sad or happy. I'll be posting a new video soon ;c)

Lucky the second time I had a Save Game Backup that was like a week old from my PS Plus include Cloud storage. So I just rolled back to that save and it fix it. Lost a little progress but better than all. That's the only fix I know of unfortunately.

watch_dogs,38xquq,EpicStreamMan,4,Sun Jun 7 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"I did both eventually. But yeah it's hard to choose because you could look at it that is even more cruel to leave him alive because he's so messed up now and has to live with his guilt. So maybe its putting him out of his misery to kill him then, but ya really doesn't change anything in the game itself."
watch_dogs,38xquq,Targma,7,Sun Jun 7 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"(Not part of the game) You could help him, he could get his GF back from auction and live happily ever after.  Kill some of those people that screw him up and beside Aiden cleaned most of them.  (in Game) You just walk away.  (i did, and hope he gets shit together and gets his GF back, if Aiden helped him it would be piece of cake)  I personally would rather live in any kind of situation (this is debatable, but in Maurice case no need to) and try to fix it. This is also why i walked away."

Though I give Ubisoft props on that reputation stuff. If you get a bad reputation people will snitch on you quick and people will be scared of you and people will call you a terrorist. Be good and people love you and no one bothers you. Kind of a template for basic human behavior."

watch_dogs,38kmci,Richumz,3,Thu Jun 4 20:50:33 2015 UTC,"So, there are two things I see about this, either, as other people suggested, it's a glitch that is intended in the game such as the glitches appearing during the campaign (I won't go through details I don't want to spoil it). But, from the video, I'd tend to thinking that those are bugs due to sanitation of the game's code: for example, imagine you're doing one of the missions and you start hacking something somewhere, once the objective is complete, it has registered that you have hacked something and the location of it, so basically when you go through that point again it loads the hacking sound again as if you were hacking it as if it were caught up in a loop. That's my theory, I have no proof of that."

watch_dogs,38kmci,xThe_Nx,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:43:57 2015 UTC,That is very strange. Sounds like the start of the hack a device noise but stops. Maybe someone was hacking you at the time. Did you get hacked or tailed near that time? Or the game is just glitching. Did you notice that noise anywhere else? I'll check that spot and see if it's repeatable.
watch_dogs,38kmci,spruebox,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:53:09 2015 UTC,I was not being hacked or tailed at that time. These bleeping spots are all over the map. Try the open grave in the graveyard for another bleep spot.

When you're getting the sound, do you ever happen to notice a glitch on screen from time to time, of a box (IIRC, it's blue, but it goes by fast)?  I get that sometimes and don't know if it's a glitch specific to PS3 or if it's something else.  Very weird."

watch_dogs,38hfu9,TheGiantGrayDildo69,3,Thu Jun 4 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"For a start, they need to be honest with the trailer and gameplay details that they announce at E3. That was their biggest mistake of all and pissed off a lot of people.   They also need to improve the 'hacking' and introduce a bit of variety, other than 'Press X' (or whatever button it is, it's been a while since I last played). The little puzzles introduced some variation, but the main world hacking was always very limited.   I know that you need to hack quick in some moments, but when you have more time to do something in a mission, they need variation.   It would be nice if they could also try and find a way to prevent cheating with the online hacking. People knowing they're being hacked by constant pausing/slow motion and penalising those who drop out just as they are about to lose spoil the experience.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the first Watch_Dogs - after I got past the damn UPlay save bug that wiped my progress for a month - but it has plenty of room for improvement."
watch_dogs,38hfu9,Rhinne,0,Thu Jun 4 15:07:50 2015 UTC,I think they learned their lesson from the last E3. If they try and pull the same stunt again I will  not be buying this game.

It's not like the city maintains real geography, size, or whatnot.  The city in Watch_Dogs could have been virtually any major American or Canadian city if you changed the landmarks and a little dialogue.

It's taken me a lot of practice to make that final jump up. As you can see in the video it still took a few tries to get there. Even though the truck looks a little conspicuous, with proper circle placement, it goes unnoticed. And even if they do see it, its really tough to make that final leap up and you can always hop down the inside of the buildings."

watch_dogs,38cvf5,infiniium1,2,Wed Jun 3 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"If you're afraid that some files will be overwritten then make a copy of them first. Files that were not originally in the game folder will not be deleted or overwritten, or so I think.  But if you think that your files are messed up then verify the files in the client and then install that postFX thing again. This way you'll have fresh files and not something that was screwed by other mods."

watch_dogs,387pfe,tyessen,2,Tue Jun 2 20:26:10 2015 UTC,That won't fix the stuttering. The game is just shit. Putting out on a ram drive will just make the loading faster
watch_dogs,387pfe,infiniium1,2,Tue Jun 2 17:07:27 2015 UTC,That's not fully true for open world games. Map around player is constantly loaded and unloaded as player moves which can create major stutters. There must be reason why game is just shit.
watch_dogs,387pfe,tyessen,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:44:01 2015 UTC,"Learn something new everyday. Its just so unfortunate that the game can be fixed, but Ubisoft just doesn't care. Maybe by some Marcile they'll revisit the game to patch it"

watch_dogs,387pfe,Midhir,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:35:39 2015 UTC,It's not disk I/O that's the problem- it has to do with the way the game loads/streams textures in and out of VRAM. Totally fixable but they don't care it seems.
watch_dogs,387pfe,Midhir,0,Wed Jun 3 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going out on a limb and guessing RAM drive is something that allows you to use HDD space as RAM? In a gaming scenario of course it won't perform as well as RAM that's built to be written to thousands upon thousands of times, so it won't be able to perform as well as actual RAM. Because the game is trying to load textures from the HDD and back, an HDD simply isn't as fast as RAM"

If I understand correctly the defender gets no points if he gets the hacker before profiling? How so?  EDIT: 1 more question, ""otherwise unfair play"" means what? I have that habit of killing the defender, is that considered as style or unfair play?"
watch_dogs,384b59,vopice2,6,Mon Jun 1 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the hell out of the driving model, personally. Most cars can be controlled pretty well, and although the sports cars seem to want to swing their backends out a lot more, they have plenty of extra acceleration and top speed to make mastering them very rewarding. Of course the motorcycles are the best for handling hands down, but you can get killed on them a LOT easier.  Glad you're liking the game! Give the ctOS challenge a chance, they're the most fun ""driving mission"" I've ever played, and I just keep going back."
watch_dogs,384b59,marco262,8,Mon Jun 1 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"I feel as though this really depends what system you're playing on. With a X-box, and it's controller, the driving is pretty simple and goes smoothly with the game. However, on PC without a controller the driving is wild, unexpected, and nearly uncontrollable. I downloaded the game on PC and was forced to purchase a microsoft X-box controller in order to make the game playable."

watch_dogs,384b59,TheOrionKane01,5,Thu Jun 4 05:56:09 2015 UTC,I thought the driving in W_D was well done. IIRC the driving mechanics are originally from a racing game that Ubisoft cancelled.

watch_dogs,384b59,afi420,10,Tue Jun 2 00:55:48 2015 UTC,It's because of the difficulty for some and how every car type drives a bit different. I didn't like it at first either until I played a lot. Now when I play other games with driving I wish it was more like Watch Dogs. So all I can say is stick with it people. Do some online races. Learn the cars and have some fun.

watch_dogs,384b59,rbrumble,2,Mon Jun 1 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree.  the driving was brutal at first, and then I learned to drive all over again.  I hated the timed missions at first, but enjoyed them after I changed my approach."
watch_dogs,384b59,JELLYFISH_FISTER,7,Tue Jun 2 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think one of the worst parts was the city itself.  It doesn't feel like it was designed to be driven in. Its not very fun to drive through. In GTA you can easily thread your way between cars in traffic, go off jumps, and drift around corners with ease. Driving in Watch Dogs feels like an afterthought. The cars just don't handle very realistically. They don't seem to have any weight to them. You can't race down the road and dodge traffic because the cars are too close together. You just plow through them. The game feels totally polished until you get in a car and thats why people make such a big deal out of it. They were trying to compete with GTA V with this game and they would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for the weak driving mechanics."
watch_dogs,384b59,mccoyster,13,Tue Jun 2 03:42:07 2015 UTC,Because people were used to non-realistic driving and anything that is remotely challenging to modern gamers is usually denounced as broken.

People dont buy gta or games like that for a simulator??? Face it...its a lot of 12 year olds buying it to kill people. But ooohhh no #realgamer. We can not like something and still be ""gamers"". Just because this game flopped and didnt do so well in peoples eye doesnt mean you have to just circle JERK AND JERK it. I mean I know I'm IN the watch dogs sub..but come on.

watch_dogs,384b59,ybmnmyyy,3,Mon Jun 1 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"Just because this game flopped   It shipped over 4 million units within the first few months.

So, the scale of the city influences the driving model, if the streets were longer and bigger the driving model would be a lot more realistic to people whereas in my opinion it already is, the scale changes it though."

watch_dogs,384haa,EpicStreamMan,2,Mon Jun 1 20:06:50 2015 UTC,Here we show how you can make a custom Cash Run Coin challange and use it as a Teleport Point later to more quickly get around the map. Basically creating your own Fast Travel Points. They even work while the police are after you (unlike regular Fast Travel Points) but not while Online of course. Very useful for all kinds of things like resupplying faster. Getting back up to a hard to get spot. Even completing curtain missions faster ;c)

watch_dogs,37sl4i,hartk1213,2,Sat May 30 14:40:30 2015 UTC,oh ok cool...its pretty cool looking nice job :)
watch_dogs,37mw9g,An0manderRake,3,Thu May 28 20:15:57 2015 UTC,"Never seen someone in the police station before. I've seen however a video about getting into walls anywhere. The dude in the vid parked a car in a slight angle to the wall then got on a bike and slowly rode the bike between the car and the wall. And then he just popped inside the wall. I tried to do it once but it didn't happen, don't know if it requires any special wall type or anything."
watch_dogs,37mw9g,infiniium1,3,Fri May 29 06:46:22 2015 UTC,This method only works with thin walls or glass walls/doors which have no obstructions. Works every time.
watch_dogs,37mw9g,Richumz,1 point,Fri May 29 15:17:34 2015 UTC,How the hell do you find those spots? Nobody still hasn't told me.
watch_dogs,37mw9g,NSFW895,3,Thu May 28 23:21:10 2015 UTC,Look on youtube. Just promise not to be a naughty boy or girl :)
watch_dogs,37mw9g,infiniium1,2,Thu May 28 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, those are around for quite some time now. The Merlaut is the easiest, the stadium is a little trickier as you have to drive a car into the bar. And there's a garage in the southeast part of Parker Square that has a glitched roof you can fall through. These are the three ""normal ones"" I'm aware of. There are others that require you to do unnatural stuff like grenade hop onto roofs, bike-jump from raised bridges or steam-pipe jump with a car."
watch_dogs,37mw9g,RainWornStone,2,Fri May 29 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"Sigh, never having seen it anywhere else I thought I was the only one who knew about that roof ;)"
watch_dogs,37mw9g,RainWornStone,1 point,Sat May 30 22:14:33 2015 UTC,Finally got a recording setup established... there's an interesting spot near that Parker square roof you can fall through... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOn2IS6N6eI
watch_dogs,37mw9g,unnithaan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:42:18 2015 UTC,Check out my post here for an easy one.
watch_dogs,37mw9g,RainWornStone,1 point,Sun May 31 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"I've only ever come across glitchers in the Merlaut, and in May Stadium.  If you mean the Palin Correctional Centre ( by LaSalle station ), rather than the Police Station, I'm pretty sure there's a way to get in through the window above the doorway. It's the only window that's actually glass, and if you look through it you can see the scenery that should be blocked out by the opposing wall of the building."
watch_dogs,37mw9g,unnithaan,1 point,Sat May 30 22:01:11 2015 UTC,I had posted a video of a fixer trying the stadium glitch here.
watch_dogs,37fn5g,TheHiddenYouTuber,3,Wed May 27 07:37:21 2015 UTC,"As a last resort, skip the hard copy and download the game through UPlay. Might take longer, but it doesn't require any discs."
watch_dogs,37fn5g,infiniium1,-1,Wed May 27 07:43:10 2015 UTC,how do I do that? Could I copy the files over from the discs to my desktop from all 3 discs and then run the set up?
watch_dogs,37fn5g,infiniium1,2,Wed May 27 07:50:12 2015 UTC,"Not really. I think you should have an activation code on the disc, or something like that. Using that code you can activate the game in the UPlay client (download that first if you don't have it). Then the UPlay client will provide you an option to download and install the game.  I've never had or seen a hard copy of this game (bought it online and got the code in email) so I might be wrong about this, but if all else fails for you with the discs, try this."
watch_dogs,37fn5g,infiniium1,0,Wed May 27 07:54:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, inside the cover I have a small book and on the front it has 'UPLAY ACTIVATION CODE' XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX  Is this the code to use? X = Numbers/letters."
watch_dogs,37fn5g,infiniium1,2,Wed May 27 08:01:04 2015 UTC,"Lol, yes."
watch_dogs,37dlvs,BlacklistSpy,4,Tue May 26 21:19:48 2015 UTC,There's a few of us on PS4 that upload hacking videos to you tube there's;  TheWrath https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIls7dvzh9lqo8qH9LP7Hw Jose Lopes https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC05smVrESuC-iu9ksjETXsA captaincarrots https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChcjLbsFM0O8U3qjTfci_UA Tiffcomp https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUIa_DoTceNDfJtmR6C6udQ  and me   minners71 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiqYakkBi2daOajvrQYNXKQ  and on PC   Infiniteoptions https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjm7o9SukvCBQdTC9Vk3VvA
watch_dogs,37dlvs,minners71,2,Thu May 28 10:24:27 2015 UTC,The best montages so far that I've seen come from a guy named /u/TheUntitledSoul. Check those out.  EDIT: here's a link http://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/2t3lgp/hacking_from_0_to_100_in_100_different_vehicles/

watch_dogs,37dlvs,TheUntitledSoul,1 point,Wed May 27 07:35:27 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm late to the ball here, but thanks! I'm glad you enjoy what I'm doing :-)  I wish that I was able to put up more WD videos, but my well of ideas is running dry. And since there's already a massive amount of people uploading regular hacking sessions I want to put the extra thought into my videos.  Lol, and also, there's Witcher 3!"
watch_dogs,37dlvs,infiniium1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:08:38 2015 UTC,Yeah lol. Anyway the OP didn't come up with the montages he was talking about so the ball ended quite early.
watch_dogs,37dlvs,Pineapplejanna,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:15:25 2015 UTC,/u/GameStunts and /u/elliotness both do videos of hacks every once in awhile still

watch_dogs,37dlvs,infiniium1,1 point,Wed May 27 07:08:49 2015 UTC,"By montages you meant artistic presentation of interesting scenery/events, or just WD videos (like online hacking)?"
watch_dogs,37bndn,infiniium1,2,Tue May 26 13:02:04 2015 UTC,You should do a section on how to deal with campers
watch_dogs,37bndn,Richumz,1 point,Tue May 26 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"Added near the end, thanks."
watch_dogs,37bndn,Deansdale,2,Tue May 26 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"holy shit this is the most bestest guide i have ever seen  okay, seriously, it's very good :)"
watch_dogs,37bndn,thewrath_86,2,Tue May 26 17:28:59 2015 UTC,LoL. Thanks! :D
watch_dogs,37bndn,An0manderRake,2,Tue May 26 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"Great guide Infinite. Very detailed. The only thing I could suggest adding is the advantage of playing with headphones. This really helps with hearing telltale noises like over-revving cars, motorbikes etc. May also be worth mentioning the advantage of hacking steam-pipes / blockers etc once you have been profiled and are making a getaway (although I am not sure if they could still kill themselves and gain points using a steam-pipe you triggered for example). Otherwise think you covered everything : )"
watch_dogs,37bndn,sleuthyRogue,1 point,Tue May 26 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes indeed, listening carefully to the sounds can help a lot, vehicles driven by players sound different from NPC vehicles. Good point."
watch_dogs,37bndn,AquatikJustice,1 point,Wed May 27 06:34:09 2015 UTC,An excellent guide. Most of this I already know but will be invaluable to any new guys.
watch_dogs,37bndn,minners71,1 point,Tue May 26 16:25:28 2015 UTC,Thank you sir. I hope they will see this and it will help them.

watch_dogs,379nfy,NarWhatGaming,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:12:34 2015 UTC,So you pirated the game? You either have Uplay or Steam...
watch_dogs,375tp1,Beastabuelos,5,Mon May 25 03:17:18 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wonder what the game is thinking with some of these spawn points...
