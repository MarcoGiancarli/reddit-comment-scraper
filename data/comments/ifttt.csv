ifttt,3dtst5,crispychoc,2,Sun Jul 19 11:45:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not directly possible with IFTTT.  It would make the app ridiculously more powerful to include a single AND option, but no dice so far.  For OR, you have to make two recipes, one for each option.  I have a /r/SmartThings hub, and that allows me to do actions conditional upon location or time.  Location and time can trigger the hub to change modes, and then actions can be confined to specific modes."
ifttt,3dtst5,skucera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the SmartThings stuff isn't available in my country.  I'll have to see how to do this, I really want have lights turn on when movement is detected, but only if I'm not home.

ifttt,3dtst5,skucera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"You might buy a few cheap relays, and set IFTTT to control them and use them as inputs.  If home, turn on relay 1. 1 controls signal through the other relay (2 for lights).   IFTTT is used for ""if home, turn on relay 1"" and ""if motion detected, turn on relay 2.""  But physically, relay 2 only sends a signal if relay 1 is turned on.  It's definitely a workaround, and more complicated than it should have to be, but it could work."
ifttt,3dtst5,skucera,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"My thought was maybe sending a location trigger to an Arduino using IFTTT, then a motion trigger too, if both are true, then send a trigger from the Arduino to IFTTT."

ifttt,3dpvgi,osmosisjonesin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:16 2015 UTC,Why bother telling them happy birthday if you don't care enough to actually type it to them? I mean it's already impersonal enough
ifttt,3dpvgi,BegbertBiggs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"Because I can? Well actually I can't, but I like to automate and it's just something that crossed my mind today. It's a friend's birthday, I saw the notification and thought that I'd better wish him a happy birthday.   Then I thought about the number of birthday wishes I get and thought it would be nice to be able to wish each of these people it back without having to actually do it. I only do it for a select few (like today) and most of these people I don't bother. If I can do it just by setting something up in 10 minutes, once, why not?"
ifttt,3dpvgi,BegbertBiggs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:20:38 2015 UTC,IFTTT can't check for facebook birthdays. There might be a way to do it with CRSS.

Don't think Storm Shield USA has RSS feeds available, but there are other options, like the Storm Prediction Center. So in theory you could set up a recipe that triggers when a new item appears in the tornado feed (matching certain keywords if you want).  Still, a tornado trigger incorporated into the current Weather channel seems like a sensible future feature."

Note if you turn the mode off after 6:00, the event is still created but not triggered.  That noted, I'm not sure how IFTTT checks GCal, so you may need some buffers in there to make sure the event is created in time to trigger the payment."

ifttt,3cn7js,BegbertBiggs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:43:59 2015 UTC,I am only at 3% and I spent most the past couple days setting up recipes... battery usage is mostly for background activity. But as you increase the amount of recipes it will inevitably increase the amount of battery used. If you follow nobodyhasthisone's suggestion (for iOS) you will see that your lock screen actually takes up far more battery.

I saved some from the website and it looks pretty good  http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/06/instagram-preps-to-save-your-photos-in-1080x1080-resolution/#.7pkczm:j1IJ
ifttt,3chje1,darkspark_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:53:43 2015 UTC,I too have been searching for a way to save 1080x1080 pictures that I liked. It would be great if my current recipe can just grab higher-res size instead of 640 one. Thank you!
ifttt,3chje1,ParrotHere,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:23:25 2015 UTC,"I believe it pulls the image directly from the source. Therefore, if the image your looking at isn't 1080x1080 then it won't save as 1080x1080. If it's saving as 640x640 then the image was originally 640x640."

ifttt,3chfif,ParrotHere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:45:00 2015 UTC,Google actually acquired Waze in July 2013. Google Now is capable of finding the best route to any location. Enter your work/home address and it will tell you every morning when to leave and where to go. It's effortlessly integrated with Google Maps so it works well.
ifttt,3cfss5,blackashi,3,Tue Jul 7 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"8 days and no one ? Well i was immensely excited as you also released it at a critical time. I use it to let my smarthub know when i'm home, it also works with DO, so i can turn off lights and such from my notifications center.  It would be amazing if it were updated to get statuses. So my phone could do stuff if it knows i'm leavin an area, e.g Earphones plugged in, leaving home and away mode is active, play music. Maybe also display status readings  like temp and humidity from my DIY smarthome hub"
ifttt,3cfss5,Ruricu,2,Thu Jul 16 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't figured out exactly what to do with this yet, but...  The Maker channel gives me a more-useful access point to IFTT from my Amazon Echo, via the Amazon Echo HA Bridge. The existing Amazon Alexa triggers are very vague and interfere with normal usage of the device, but the Maker channel allows the syntax ""Alexa, turn [on/off] [device name]"" to be a dedicated IFTTT trigger."
ifttt,3cgmfo,ochristo87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think any channels support multiple accounts, but mutiple IFTTT accounts can access one channel account. I suspect you'll have to rely on a go-between channel.  In other words, set up one IFTTT account to access xxxxxxx@gmail.com and another channel that can accept calendar appointments (Kyber?). Then, set up a second IFTTT account to access yyyyyyy@gmail.com and the same common account. The first IFTTT account will push events from the xxxxxxx Google account to the common account, and the second IFTTT account will pull events from the common account into the yyyyyyy Google account.  All that said, I think an iCal channel would be a great addition."
ifttt,3cgmfo,drokkon,2,Tue Jul 7 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"He can also invite the other account (yyyyyyyy@gmail.com) as a guest. It will then appear on the other account (yyyyyyyy@gmail.com). If he is creating the event himself then that's simple enough.    However, if IFTTT is creating the event on xxxxxxxx@gmail.com then simply adding ""with yyyyyyyy@gmail.com"" to the Quick Add  feature should work perfectly fine.    If neither of these help then I may need a little bit more information to simplify the process."

I will use IFTTT to share articles that I broadcast on Inoreader to a central WordPress install. Then I will use the FeedWordPress on my satellite blogs to pull only the RSS feeds for specific tags.  Basically, if I want to share articles with a comment to 3 different blogs, I'll basically tag an article with ""A"" ""B"" or ""C,"" then broadcast the article with my personal comment using Inoreader. An IFTTT recipe will turn my broadcast into a post on robot-disallowing ""CentralBlog,"" preserving the tag and using my comment as a title. Then, BlogA, BlogB, and BlogC will automatically ""scrape"" CentralBlog periodically and reblog content matching their tag."

What you'll need to do it open the app a few times a day for about a week (the actual numbers I'm not sure about) so that iOS learnr that you value this app. It should then start updating more often (in the background)."

ifttt,38fw0b,Mark2_0,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:08:21 2015 UTC,"This is not possible with regular flickr channel on IFTTT. Besides each & every photo appear on photo-stream. Flickr album is more like tagging a group of photos...it doesn't move photos from photo-stream.  Anyway, if you are a programmer you can easily achieve this with flickr api. The workflow would be something like this:   Dropbox---->Flickr (tagged #album-name) A php script which extract photo id from url & add it to specific album. Register a webhook channel: IFTTT for webhook (https://github.com/captn3m0/ifttt-webhook) Host your php script on scalingo or on openshift for free! Then use flickr trigger from ifttt:    If any new photo tagged #album-name    then    POST to webhook (wordpress channel)    Title: {{Photo title}}    Body: {{Photo URL}}   The php script automatically adds your public photos to secific album! Done!"

Maybe someone has a creative application of 2 or more IFTTT recipes, but I haven't seen anyone figure out how to make it work yet.  But now you have me thinking. For your specific recipe, maybe there's a way to combine these pieces:   IF close to home, THEN add a row to a Google Drive Spreadsheet with time it occurred On a second tab in the sheet, populate the rows with sunset times (formatted to be comparable to the first tab data) On a third tab, compare values from first 2 tabs, and populate a row with a trigger term if (1) is later than (2) Create a second recipe that triggers when the third tab populates a row with the right output   And now I just realized IFTTT doesn't have triggers for Sheets.

I would assume making deals with tech products that light up your home and adjust your thermostat are much more lucrative than the whopping zilch that a user would pay for this type of functionality.  As an end user, it's technically possible, but super hackish and inefficient. One could do a workaround pinging your webserver, programming a script to push to an RSS feed when multiple conditions are met, and then using the feed as a trigger for a recipe. I am not sure how a layman would go about it without web development knowledge, though."
ifttt,37c13n,TinyCooper,1 point,Fri May 29 01:41:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.   Are there other automation apps that allow you to have multiple conditionals?

IFTTT is the best simple solution I've come across, unless you want to shell out for professional products like Mashape and Zapier... which I don't, so I have no experience with them, and can't comment on whether they allow for multiple conditions.  Mashape, I believe, is developer-oriented, and wouldn't work too well for someone without programming experience."
ifttt,37c13n,lieunee,0,Fri May 29 02:45:14 2015 UTC,"There are really imperfect solutions to the scenario above but it IS (sort of) possible.     Ideally the following would happen: 1) IFTTT pings your location at the designated lamp time 2) If location = home then lamp on, if not do nothing     Problem is that location only has triggers (enter or exit an area) and no actions. Time can't trigger a location action (because there are no location actions). One possible work around is this...     Trigger: Location - Enter Area -> Action: Google Calendar - Quick update with the time you want the to turn lamp on     PLUS     Trigger: Google Calendar event with specified search term (""hue"" for example) -> Action: Turn on Lamp     This recipe works (I have used it) the problem however is that you can only quick add to Google Calendar, you can't remove or edit. So, basically the formula above works great if you leave for work in the morning and then come home (triggering the calendar update and eventually the lamp turning on) BUT if you leave the house again after arriving home once already, exiting the area won't trigger removal of the calendar event. In that situation the lamp would still turn on even if you weren't home anymore."

ifttt,36xtqb,laddergoat89,1 point,Sat May 23 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"Hey laddergoat89! Since the iOS Location Channel uses the geofence API, the battery usage is minimal. Enjoy!"
ifttt,36xtqb,sirilluminator,0,Sat May 23 05:40:03 2015 UTC,"How does that work then? I currently don't have location services on on my phone all the time, I have recent locations and most of that other system stuff turned off. My Gps only turns on when I open apps that require it.  Surely IFTTT will need to have the GPS on 24/7 to know where I am?"
ifttt,36xtqb,sirilluminator,2,Sat May 23 07:55:54 2015 UTC,"There's essentially two different ways for a third-party app (like IF) to use Location Services -- location updates and region monitoring.   Location updates generally use the GPS antenna and create that blue bar at the top of your phone when the app is in the background. Apps that use location updates get constant updates with your exact location.   Region monitoring, which is what IF uses, is just interested in when you enter or exit boundaries defined by a center point (latitude/longitude) and a radius (N meters). Because we're not interested in a precise location, just those boundary events, the system doesn't need to keep the GPS antenna powered all the time. Instead, it uses a combination of cellular, WiFi, and GPS to track entries and exits into those boundaries. There's some more details here."
ifttt,36wail,shadowduff,1 point,Fri May 22 17:26:13 2015 UTC,No. That is too many conditions for IFTTT to handle at this time :(
ifttt,36wail,Jenllip,1 point,Fri May 22 23:13:26 2015 UTC,And even worst : everything is triggered by an event. No an absence of event
ifttt,36x28e,feeniksina,1 point,Fri May 22 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"This can be done using Gmail trigger ""new email in inbox from search"". In the trigger search box use ""to:email1 AND to:email2"" (replacing with email addresses of course). Choose Gmail action and input both email addresses, separated by a comma."
ifttt,36x28e,SkaPHataria,1 point,Sun May 24 03:30:41 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the reply. I'll try this out tomorrow. I appreciate it!
ifttt,36tj5c,DavidNealon,2,Fri May 22 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"Must you use IFTTT?   If not, then on your computer where both Dropbox and Google Drive are installed, you could move the Dropbox folder inside the Google Drive folder. You must have more storage space in Google Drive than Dropbox though."
ifttt,36tj5c,Gordonpn,2,Fri May 22 11:34:59 2015 UTC,"On Linux or OS X, you can symlink one to the other.  NTFS as of Win 7 has symlinks too, but I don't know if the same trick works."
ifttt,36tj5c,alinroc,1 point,Fri May 22 13:00:39 2015 UTC,"You're right, you could definitely make a symbolic link also! That solution is simpler actually :)"
ifttt,36tj5c,Gordonpn,2,Fri May 22 13:12:42 2015 UTC,I've done it when I needed to have just a subset of one synced to the other (mostly so I had 2 copies available away from home). Worked pretty well.
ifttt,36tj5c,alinroc,3,Fri May 22 13:56:09 2015 UTC,Why?
ifttt,36tj5c,whatne1wuddo,1 point,Fri May 22 04:57:46 2015 UTC,I agree. I can't think of a context why you would do this?
ifttt,36tj5c,notantisocial,1 point,Fri May 22 12:25:20 2015 UTC,Perhaps like me the OP has certain people/entities who insist on using one and he prefers the other? I use Drive and the fire department i'm on uses Dropbox.
ifttt,36skv0,namklabs,2,Thu May 21 19:57:39 2015 UTC,"Let's see if I can explain this clearly... The location map url is not actually part of the dropbox channel. Dropbox doesn't know where you are. What the Do app is actually doing is using your phone's location in connection with the maps channel to pass data through to dropbox.   Unfortunately, I can't think of a way to accomplish what you're asking for in one recipe because it requires three steps: If the time is x o'clock, then capture my location, then send that location info to dropbox."
ifttt,36skv0,Jenllip,1 point,Thu May 21 23:35:45 2015 UTC,Right on. That helps. Thank you!
ifttt,36nx7u,JeffIsTheCorn,1 point,Wed May 20 19:31:13 2015 UTC,Here's the official answer:   This Trigger fires every time a new post becomes one of the ten top posts in the subreddit you specify.   Source
ifttt,36nx7u,savethebots,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"But is that top ten of all time, monthly, weekly, or hourly?"
ifttt,36nx7u,savethebots,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:43:45 2015 UTC,"As far as I see, it triggers whenever a post gets to the top ten. But sadly, it just works with the all time top posts.  I wish there was a way to choose the period for this."
ifttt,36ks5a,devDoron,2,Wed May 20 02:47:11 2015 UTC,Sounds like something tasker is good for. I don't know much about it but the wifi bit you spoke of leads my detective work to tasker.
ifttt,36ks5a,0_-,1 point,Wed May 20 05:47:15 2015 UTC,If all you want is ambient light behind your TV the cheapest/easiest way would be a buy a LED strip/power supply and a power strip with a Master outlet. Plug the TV into the master and the LED strip into one of the controlled outlets. The LEDs would light up or turn off instantly with the TV.  If you have to be able to control it from your phone or are dead set on using the HUE strip I can't think of anything off the top of my head that would give you exactly what you are asking for.
ifttt,36ks5a,anonymous_douche,1 point,Wed May 20 17:28:32 2015 UTC,For that reason I installed a Belkin WeMo Switch in my home that automatically turns of when I leave the GPS area and turns on as soon as my phone is connected to my wifi. Of course theres an app for it which allows switching on/off from your phone.
ifttt,36ks5a,moep0r,1 point,Sat May 23 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"I tried this last week with my TV and phone. The goal was to detect the phone's ip / MAC address. The problem is that these values can linger on the network even though the phone is not on wifi anymore. There were options, like running arping to make sure the MAC address responded.   Since that felt too complicated I built a slack bot that interfaces with Ifttt and my raspberry pi. When I enter an area it sends a message to the slack channel, the bot then issues a sell command to turn the TV on. ( tvservice -p ).   I'm still testing it and there may be an issue with the bot not always reading what the iffft-bot says on the channel. But otherwise I feel it is the best way to integrate ifttt with different devices and triggers in a coherent way. I can publish the details if you want to try this route."
ifttt,36jwxt,Brandon4466,3,Tue May 19 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but maybe something like Pushbullet?"
ifttt,36jwxt,H3bus,3,Tue May 19 23:02:58 2015 UTC,"Try an app called ""Pushbullet"". You may have to look through the settings, but I know it can send notifications from an Android device to your other devices."
ifttt,36jwxt,trekstar,1 point,Tue May 19 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a little new to both these apps, is there a way to set IFTTT to turn on pushbullet after a certain time? Like if I wanted notifications sent from my work phone to my personal phone after 5 pm?"
ifttt,36jwxt,TheSidePocketKid,2,Tue May 19 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant with just PushBullet - no IFTTT. I'm not sure if there's a way to schedule it, although you may be able to do it with an app called Tasker. I don't believe IFTTT can do that."
ifttt,36ifk2,neuralzone,2,Tue May 19 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to have IFTTT 'grab' the shopping list, and replying would be an additional ""THEN"", which would require a Rube Goldberg-esqu process of recipes, so heres an easier, yes admittedly annoying alternative...   THIS: Amazon Alexa -> ""Item Added to your shopping list""  THEN: SMS -> ""Send me an SMS"" -> ""SHOPPING LIST: {{AddedItem}}""  It will send you an SMS for each item you add... then when you're at the store, you can just go through your texts to see what's there, and delete individual texts to ""mark them off"""
ifttt,36ifk2,plasma2002,1 point,Tue May 19 22:17:26 2015 UTC,"I know that this is extremely unhelpful at answering the question, but thought I'd throw it out there just in case.  If you open the Amazon Echo app on your smartphone, you can access the shopping list and the todo list in there"

ifttt,35vxt9,JeffIsTheCorn,5,Wed May 13 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"Probably.  I have IF send the hot post of the day to a dropbox folder, and then point the desktop-background-changer-thingy (I use a mac) at that dropbox folder. So it changes my screen every 15 minutes and also pulls the screensaver images from the same folder. I'm betting you can do the same thing in Windows."
ifttt,35vxt9,buzzjackson,4,Thu May 14 00:11:33 2015 UTC,You can make IFTTT put pictures in a Dropbox folder and then set Windows to cycle through all the pictures in that folder.

ifttt,35qmpd,plasma2002,11,Tue May 12 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"RE GCal.  I run a business. One of the businesses a couple doors down from me likes to throw parties and random events after hours. They put the events on a public calendar.  I use IFTTT to check to see if they have something going on, and if they do, I have IFTTT turn on all my showroom Hue lights to attract attention and also turn on a few appliances that passerbys can interact with (like a LED sign that people can text a message to and have displayed)"
ifttt,35qmpd,Library_Lad,2,Tue May 12 19:41:52 2015 UTC,I set up four square check ins to add a calendar entry. It's a quick way to make a record of a memorable event.  It now uses Swarm. I still don't understand why they split the app.
ifttt,35qmpd,Jenllip,2,Wed May 13 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"I use IFTTT + Google Calendar to: * track package delivery dates * log my Foursquare (Swarm) checkins * log when I get to and leave my office (though the android location detection trigger is unreliable) * log when I get to the gym (so I know when I actually went!) * log when I watch tv shows & movies (via the trakt.tv VIP RSS) * log my FitBit daily activity summaries * log all my Buffer posts to social media * log when I make a new LinkedIn connection (though I don't know why) * as an alarm clock to turn my lights on (""IF 'soft wake up' event found on calendar, THEN set lights at 50%"")  Yes, this would all result in a completely useless day-to-day calendar, which is why I have my IFTTT linked up to a secondary ""Jen's AutoCal"" Google Calendar in my account.

ifttt,35oz4n,aManHasSaid,1 point,Tue May 12 13:38:20 2015 UTC,"download boxcar app and make an account.  You might have to use the website to make an account I'm not sure.  Login to the app with the account.  Somewhere it shows you an email address that is the email address you send mail to boxcar with.  Remember that email address.  Now make a mail rule that says ""if mail matches this rule: forward a copy to xxxxxxxx@boxcar.io AND put it in a folder.""  When boxcar gets the forwarded email, it sends you a quick text that includes the subject of the email and a bit of the body.  Or something like that.  IFTTT works ok, but there's often a delay between email and notification.  Boxcar is much faster."
ifttt,35oz4n,BegbertBiggs,1 point,Tue May 12 18:39:11 2015 UTC,I don't know Boxcar but it appears to be iOS only. OP uses Android.
ifttt,35oz4n,aManHasSaid,1 point,Tue May 12 18:38:50 2015 UTC,There is an Android version.

ifttt,35oz4n,BegbertBiggs,1 point,Tue May 12 19:04:02 2015 UTC,Disclaimer: I did not try this myself!   Set up an Outlook rule to forward the emails sent into that folder to IFTTT. Use the IFTTT Email trigger and SMS action to do what you want to achieve.

I would imagine you only recieved winmail.dat in place of the original attachment.  The winmail.dat file is a collection of the formatted text and the attachment and is caused by incorrectly configured Outlook clients. You should be able to extract the attachment itself from winmail.dat using a 3rd party software.  Link about the issue https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/278061

ifttt,33cxiu,saviin,2,Tue Apr 21 16:30:18 2015 UTC,"Tried changing it to HTML/ RTF/ plain text, but no difference. The thing is, the winmail.dat file looks the right size, but I can't do anything with it."

ifttt,33dcd9,faraday-cage,2,Tue Apr 21 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"What does it mean to ""turn on"" (or off) an email account?   in iOS, you can turn an account's email on and off for the device. And as of now, there's no way to do that through IFTT."
ifttt,33dcd9,irishmcsg2,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I admire your restraint. :)  No, there is no API for that. Only in Settings.app can you toggle an account on and off; third party apps cannot make changes there."
ifttt,33dcd9,faraday-cage,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:21:19 2015 UTC,You should ask at /r/tasker .
ifttt,33ciu3,ryanmiddlesex,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:32:26 2015 UTC,Suggest the channel on IFTTT.com if this wasn't done already.
