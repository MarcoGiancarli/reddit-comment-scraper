NetflixBestOf,3e11rt,thekiyote,7,Tue Jul 21 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"I saw Carruth speak at the final showing of Upstream Color at the IFC here in New York. Here are some things I remember from the Q&A:  Before UC, he'd been working on a film called A Topiary about kids who find fantastical monsters in the woods. He eventually abandoned the project for various reasons. Shots from the film were used in UC though: they're the CGI project that Kris is working on at work.  Carruth did practically everything himself. Wrote the film, shot the film, worked with the editor, and even did the business end of things (fundraising, distribution contracts, etc). He said he was glad he had, but in the future he'd be leaving some of the duties to others because it made the project take too long. Particularly distribution I remember him saying.  The film was shot on a modified DSLR camera with various custom lenses. Carruth used to be an engineer, so he actually hacked the firmware of his DSLR so that the light sensor would sense colors differently from what it's meant to. He did this to make it easier to get the color palate he wanted when editing in post-production.  While Carruth neither confirmed nor denied this, one of the audience pointed out that Kris had probably been a SCUBA or free diver—that's why she has the box of gold coins and stuff for the guy to steal, and that's why she practices swimming and picking up rocks. Whether intentional or not, I thought it was a great interpretation of the film.  Spoilers: In the end, Kris shoots the pig keeper, and through this act of murder finds some semblance of closure. However, the pig keeper never actually hurt her, or anyone! In fact, he's the one who extracted the worms so they didn't live inside her and the other victims. I'd noticed this the first time I watched it, and Carruth confirmed to someone else in the Q&A that this was intentional.  That's all I remember for now. If anyone has any questions it might job my memory. It was a cool event, Carruth spoke both humbly and intelligently about the filmmaking process and his own intensions for the movie. Will definitely go see him speak again when he next film comes out."

NetflixBestOf,3e11rt,dontdigonswine,13,Tue Jul 21 18:08:01 2015 UTC,"It is an amazing achievement really. Structurally, it's more like an trippy, impressionistic experimental film you'd see at an art film festival - but with a more ""hollywood"" sci-fi plot.    But the plot is not entirely obvious.   Nor is it laid out conventionally. It's a little like the film Momento, in that it's disjointed in time, and what's happening isn't always obvious. You have to work to make sense of it --- OR you can 'not work at it' at all, and sort of just sit back and  let it all wash over you.  I'd say at a minimum, you will want to watch it twice.  It pushes the limits of commercial ""movies"" as we think of them.  This is something new, different, fresh.  Like nothing I've ever seen before.    It's really quite brilliant."
NetflixBestOf,3e11rt,malpais,12,Tue Jul 21 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of what you said, but I don't agree that the film is like Memento. The storyline in UC is far more linear than that.

But I can totally see that a lot of people would think it's slow or uninteresting. It's sort of like the 'Solaris' remake--if you liked that you might like this.  Also it's one of those 'it doesn't get any better after 30 minutes' type of movies. If you're not hooked by then cut your losses and move on.

A single mother returns from work to find her nine-year-old son gone. She calls the LAPD to initiate a search. Five months later, a boy is found in Illinois who fits the description; he says he's her son. To fanfare and photos, the LAPD reunite mother and son, but she insists he's not her boy. The cops dismiss her as either a liar or hysterical. When she joins a minister in his public criticism of the police, they in turn use government power to silence and intimidate her. Meanwhile, a cop goes to a dilapidated ranch to find a Canadian lad who's without legal status; the youth tells a grisly tale. There's redress for murder; is there redress for abuse of power? (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Todd McCarthy of Variety said Jolie was more affecting than in A Mighty Heart (2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted a surfeit of good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular. Oliver Séguret of Libération said the cast was the film's best feature. He praised the supporting actors and said Jolie's performance was forceful yet understated. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said Jolie shunned her ""movie star"" persona to appear vulnerable and resolute. He perceived the supporting characters—Amy Ryan's excepted—as having few shades of gray. David Ansen, writing in Newsweek, echoed the sentiment, but said that ""some stories really are about the good guys and the bad"". He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing, and David Denby of The New Yorker said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, ""The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators.""

NetflixBestOf,3dvizv,badattitude4u,6,Mon Jul 20 04:21:34 2015 UTC,None of these are particularly recent but try...  Black Sheep if you haven't seen it yet. Wonderful movie set in New Zealand where a massive flock of sheep turns carnivorous as a side effect to a failed experiment.  It's basically a modern zombie movie with sheep instead of zombies.  The Relic is an older one but still holds up. The movie deals with a monster following a crate of artefacts that got send to a natural history museum from the South American jungle.  Mimic A scientist finds out that the roaches she genetically modified to wipe out a disease haven't disappeared after the pandemic stopped. Wonderful forgotten Guillermo del Toro movie.  Although I guess Mimic and The Relic are a bit on the serious side. Doesn't stop them from being very fun movies though.

They stalk the trailer of the mysterious hunter Hans expecting to find an explanation for the killings. The reluctant Hans tries to flee from the youngsters, but he agrees that they film him in action provided they follow his orders. Sooner the trio of students learns that Hans is actually a troll hunter that works for a secret government agency. Further, several dangerous trolls have escaped from their territory and Hans is assigned to eliminate them. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   The most favourable review from the major national newspapers was written by Mode Steinkjer in Dagsavisen, where the film received five out of six points. He commended Øvredal's ability to combine ""subtle humour with physical tension"" and also commented on the ""striking naturalness"" displayed by Tosterud, Larsen and Mørck as the three students. Kjersti Nipen, on the other hand, reviewing the film for Aftenposten, gave the movie only three points out of six. She called it ""flat, predictable and rather devoid of content"". Although she regarded it as funny at times, she found the use of the mockumentary format exhausted and overused. The review in Morgenbladet was not favourable either.

NetflixBestOf,3dvizv,Wilcows,12,Mon Jul 20 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"It's not a slap stick kind of comedy.  Think of it this way. One of the most well known mythological creatures from the movie's home region turns out to be real. That's not so remarkable, plenty of horror movies work with myths that turn out to be real.  But the trolls aren't just real. The government knows and just sweeps it under the rug by having some grumbling underpaid civil servant go around in a truck shepherding rogue trolls back into the wilderness.  And then there's the little nods towards validating not just mythological creatures but actual Nordic religion by saying these trolls can in fact smell Christians and don't like them much.  Oh and the big problem in the movie? Not some ancient evil, it's just that some of the trolls got rabies.  The whole thing is very much an action comedy but yeah it's very understated and dead pan as is typical of Scandinavia. You'll also get a lot more out of it with a little more knowledge of Scandinavian folklore.  If I had to pick an American analogue I'd say imagine watching Tucker & Dale vs evil without knowing anything about American slasher movies and rednecks. It would just be weird gory slapstick."

Finds and fights other people altered by same event.   Heroes - first season is origin stories of heroes, later seasons have origin stories of villains but mostly about character conflicts of original cast. If you don't want to watch a whole series, just first season is fully contained arc and worth watching.   There's a bunch of western cartoons and anime that have this theme.  X-men cartoon is on Netflix   Sense8 - cool idea but depending on how much time you have, this might feel a little slow. Not really heroes, it's extra ordinary personal conflict using super abilities to solve. I'm waiting for season 2 to judge this before recommending this to people because I'm not quite sure what to make of it.   Tomorrow people - teens who have powers are similar, trope: being hunted   Jumper - people have similar power, trope: hunted  Wanted - office worker finds out his hidden abilities  The matrix 1 - office worker breaks out of office, learns super ability"

Classical music afficiando friends of mine who have seen it gnash their teeth at certain parts the same way I do as a private pilot with certain parts of ""Flight"", or as a chess player with practically every movie ever made that uses the game as a metaphor. This is to say, thriller fans in it purely for the atmosphere may be disappointed with some of the goofs.     Having said all that, I recommend it for the fight scene set against Alice Ella's version of ""Motherless Child"". It's a haunting and truly original version of a song that's been a covered by everyone and a standard since at least Louie Armstrong's version. Also, how no one has thought to set a fight above a concert hall since Phantom of the Opera is beyond me.   In short, a semi-cerebral popcorn movie with some good music and a lot of style.

The film is about a once promising pianist returning for a comeback performance, only to be the target of a sniper who will kill him if he plays one wrong note. The film premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 20, 2013 and was given a VOD release on January 30, 2014. It was given a limited release in U.S. theatres on March 7. (Wikipedia)   Critical reception:   The film was met with mostly positive reviews, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 77% and an average score of 6.5/10, based on 57 reviews. The site's consensus states: ""Grand Piano is so tense in its best moments — and appealingly strange overall — that it remains rewarding in spite of its flaws."" On Metacritic, it has a 61/100 score (indicating ""generally favorable reviews""), based on 20 critics. Todd Gilchrist of Indiewire said, ""Grand Piano succeeds as a whole for the same reasons that Selznick does—namely, because Mira brings all of its elements to work together in concert, and then executes them like a virtuoso"". Guy Lodge, writing for Variety, commented on the film, saying ""this not-quite horror film is refreshingly blood-shy even in bloodshed, preferring to let the scarlet soft furnishings of a plush Chicago concert hall provide the red menace"". Stephen Dalton, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, found the film lacking but said ""it has just enough stylistic swagger to excuse its utterly preposterous plot"". He also found praise in the performances of Elijah Wood, John Cusack and Alex Winter, saying, ""Together they elevate a risibly ridiculous plot into something akin to a pulp symphony"".

The acting is..interesting. I think the overacting in some parts might be on purpose, you'll see what I mean when you watch it.  I think the movie is supposed to resemble a set, not in a ""this is on a stage so obviously theres a set"" way.. I mean I think it's supposed to resemble the old sound stages and sets from the early days, like in ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""New York, New York"" days. Which isn't a bad thing or a negative in any way, just an observation.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 77%, Imdb gives it a 5.9...I'll go in the middle and give it a 6.8."

Simon Roberts is the head of a powerful agency, with the biggest clients and brands in the world, but even more important to him is that his daughter Sydney is by his side. As his partner, Sydney is Simon's exact opposite - focused, organized and eager to make a name for herself, but also too busy parenting her father, which she'd resent if he wasn't so brilliant at what he does. Joining them in the firm are the dashing and talented Zach; art director Andrew, who's as hard-working as he is neurotic; and the beautiful and deceptively smart assistant Lauren. With his team and his daughter behind him, Simon continues to set the advertising world on fire, and it looks like they are definitely buying what these crazy ones are selling.

I read reviews beforehand, and went into the documentary knowing that it wasn't going to tell me very much about the validity of the treatments they're looking at. But I thought it was a really interesting look at the two men themselves. They are totally different people, but both have the same goal: to find a ""cure"" for death. And though they say they're doing it for humanity at large, and not just for personal gain, it was interesting to watch them grapple (or not) with the ethical/practical questions of what would happen if their work was actually a success."

The show starts off a little slow and some of the jokes fall a little flat, but you start off feeling a little repulsed by Bojack and slowly begin to really feel for the guy. It's not a comedy for the sake of comedy, it's a comedy that deals with some pretty intense issues like alcoholism, drug abuse and depression.   I have both laughed uncontrollably and sat in deep reflection at the things I've seen on this show. I love it. The first 4-6 episodes can be a little slow but it really picks up quick. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."

NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,DarkSideofOZ,41,Fri Jul 17 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people on the web say that the first few episodes of season 1 were bad and then it gets better. Also season 1 in general got mixed and poor reviews. I really find all of that pretty baffling, I thought it was excellent from the first episode. I'd say it's the best animated show around right now, but it's pretty hard to dethrone adventure time.  Also the animation and character design are just beautiful.  Edit: Just wanted to add that golan the insatiable is extremely underrated also. Also yes rick and morty is amazing also, but I like the previously mentioned shows more."
NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,ducked,50,Fri Jul 17 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"For me, it is 100% the eponymous character. Bojack is a more complex, nuanced portrayal than anything on TV right now.  It actually reminds me of the experience of watching Breaking Bad. There the draw is getting to watch Walter White make his transformation, driven by spector of his mortality, from milquetoast to   a neo-Pablo Escobar.   With Bojack, it's the audience, you the viewer, going through the change. It starts with a character that is fundamentally unlikable, and then forces you to get to know him. It just peels back layer after layer, until you understand him, and then by God you're rooting for him, warts and all.   It's hard enough to write a likable character, but to start with such an ass and then slowly drill empathy into the hearts of the viewers is one hell of a creative accomplishment.   Bojack Horseman is humanism in a bottle."
NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,simon_phoenix,8,Fri Jul 17 19:12:04 2015 UTC,I've wanted to give it a try for awhile. This comment made me want to start a binge tonight. I've never heard it described quite like this. Very intrigued.
NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,LiberalTennessean,11,Fri Jul 17 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"Here, I'll push you over the edge. I don't say this about a lot of tv/movies/books, but this is one where I am actually jealous that you still get to experience it a first time.   It does start slow though, that is true. Let me draw a comparison to another show I'd put in the above category: The Wire.   Season one was great, I was fully on board, and I have this very distinct memory of sitting on my couch after the first episode of season two. That episode is very heavy on the docks and the union and almost none of the characters we got to know in season 1. I remember sitting there thinking, what the hell is this shit? Why in God's name did I just watch an hour of union politics?   Then, at the end of season 2, it was all mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, please accept my apologies David Simon, your vision was much greater than mine you genius, etc, etc. It took what I thought a crime show could be and pushed way, way past that boundary. Having your perspective forcibly shifted like that is a transformative experience.   Yeah, Bojack Horseman is kinda like that for cartoons."

I'd say some other episodes that fit the profile (using Netflix as reference) are The Late Philip J.

I ended up marathoning it all that day and ordering the bluray afterwards, it's really, really damn good."

NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,xdeific,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"Bojack is a lot of slapstick, visual puns, references, and some clever writing that gives a lot of depth.  Rick & Morty is the pinnacle of throwing logic out and just being absurd humor.  There's some heart in some episodes, but a lot of it is just the funniest stuff (a lot improvised, too) you will ever see."
NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,tigerbait92,3,Fri Jul 17 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think it throws logic out the window, I think what makes it great is how each episode has it's own self consistent logic where it builds on a premise in a totally logical way that never the less leads to total absurdity.   For example: we start with shrink rays exist to building a Jurassic Park style theme park inside a hobo to giant rotting hobo corpse floating in space. The fact that each step makes sense at the time is what makes it so great and not just lol random craziness like many other animated shows."

NetflixBestOf,3dlrxr,Eupatorus,29,Sat Jul 18 00:08:46 2015 UTC,It's better than funny. It's a character piece and it is very emotional.

It switches from a crappy comedy with mediocre jokes to a surprisingly deep look at a really depressed character. I would definitely recommend giving it a second chance, you just have to stick with it for a while longer for it to pick up.   IIRC Indiewire initially gave the show a C+ grade based on the first 6 episodes, but later changed their review based on the rest of the season."

If you don't like it by the 5th episode I'd think it's not for you. I don't even have a problem with cartoons, I love American Dad, Archer, old Simpsons, South Park, etc...but I just can not find this show funny or even interesting.

And that's just the beginning: Meet freedmen, the irish, robber barons, indians, mormons, the union army, more indians, prostitutes, lawmen and more as the mighty Union Pacific railway marches ever westward, laying the great rails of American civilization, by hammer, powder, or bullet.

I hate to say it but there were moments I was downright bored and playing on my phone as it was on. Perhaps the show could have benefited from 1-3 fewer episodes. And the dialogue is definitely cliche at times.   I do like that early fight scenes had Daredevil struggling and sorta getting his ass kicked though. It's a big relief to see that. Its more interesting than seeing him effortlessly take down thugs like Black Widow does. I like the darkness of the show that is unlike anything else in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And I'm interested in seeing where all the dangling stories are gonna lead. Can't wait for Punisher next season.   But yeah, definitely not a flawless show."

It rewards it's viewers with in jokes that are both subtle and not so subtle but that's part of its charm. The writing and actors get better as the series goes on, which is nice for a show thay doesnt alter its main cast for all 8 seasons. Plus, if you are a fan of movies, they constantly pay homage to different actors, directers, films and genres (which being a fan of movies, is a major plus for me). Furthermore, they understand the insanity of the premise and embrace it. The first episode ends with that very thing being discussed, and in later seasons they have a running joke about mocking people who mock The Mentalist (because they are comparable)."

But by this point Dante's vision was no match for Burton's.  Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice were transcendent in their vision. When the Burbs was released Dante was simply not the best in town.   Dante was always more of an anarchist anyway. He seemed to chafe against the Burbs too, getting bored with the pacing of the plot and reacting by pranking his own film. By the climax the film descends into Looney Tunes-physics and taps on the fourth wall. That was Dante's natural comfort zone and his next film, Gremlins 2, took this even further with better results.   All this aside. Had the Burbs had the guts to not have the ""surprise ending"" and stick with the conclusion that Hanks and friends were the lunatics, I'd have a stronger opinion of it."
NetflixBestOf,3dihe7,stackolee,2,Thu Jul 16 23:58:45 2015 UTC,I think one of the points of the film is that they're all lunatics. They just happened to be right about the Klopecs is all.

The Burbs was a follow up for Splash and Big for Hanks, plus it came out around the same time as Turner and Hooch. Compared to those movies, The Burbs didn't have the same emotional connection, the script was kind of formulaic (nosey neighbor, jerk neighbor, and creepy neighbor meets all around average guy), and there were some moments in the film that dragged enough to take away from the whole film. By itself, it was entertaining for me though."
NetflixBestOf,3dihe7,secondsbest,6,Thu Jul 16 18:02:16 2015 UTC,"the script was kind of formulaic (nosey neighbor, jerk neighbor, and creepy neighbor meets all around average guy)   If it was so ""formulaic"" maybe you could share some other movies that follow this formula.

It's what made him a premier comedic actor in the 80s. So by formulaic, I meant to convey his shtick before he broke with that for more dramatic rolls in the 90s and beyond."

NetflixBestOf,3dkxy1,g0newick3d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"I actually took some issue with some of the cinematography early on.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the aesthetic, the understated tones and muted colors of the whole thing but some of the focus and lighting on some of the early shots felt a little buzzy to me.     Those are small quibbles though.  Overall I thought that veteran character actor, Leland Orser (seriously look at his IMDB page from Se7ev to Taken the guy has been in everything), in a rare chance to shine, did a fantastic job as down-on-his-luck Ansel.    I also loved how the director (Mary Elizabeth Winstead's husband, Riley Stearns) played with the audience's expectations early on.  The opening diner scene and all the way up to the kidnapping of Claire, have a slap-stick vibe to them.  To the point where I thought the film was a black comedy until halfway through the second act."
NetflixBestOf,3dkxy1,MovieGuide,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by buzzy? Not trying to argue, just curious since I'm admittedly not an expert with this kind of thing.   And I agree about Leland Orser. I failed to mention him (mostly because I hadn't remembered seeing him in anything before), but he was outstanding as well.   And I think you explained perfectly why I loved the movie so much--the way it toys with audience expectations. At the end I was able to think back to all of the moments that hinted at what was going on that weren't initially apparent, so the conclusion felt earned. I'm excited to see what Riley Stearns does next. He wrote the part of Claire specifically with his wife in mind and has said he's doing the same for his next film."
NetflixBestOf,3dkxy1,BenAdaephonDelat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:48:08 2015 UTC,I mean the focus seems buzzed and lighting too soft in some of the early scenes.

NetflixBestOf,3dhufu,Boogie_knight,16,Thu Jul 16 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"Disappointing that it wasn't picked up for more, but I get why. The series isn't terrible, but it isn't particularly amazing. A clever concept that seems to get lost along the way. If people want a series that provides answers and concludes in any way, then this show isn't for them. The whole story arc of the first season seems like one giant episode that establishes characters and plot structure more than anything else. Leaves you with a big ""well shit. What now.""

NetflixBestOf,3dhufu,Sanstor,5,Thu Jul 16 15:32:28 2015 UTC,Nah I mean it aired on Syfy as a miniseries.

NetflixBestOf,3dhufu,Boogie_knight,4,Fri Jul 17 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"Just watched this on Netflix.  Pretty good for what it was (a six episode miniseries), with an interesting concept.  If you decide to give it a try, the ""Hook"" doesn't really come in until the end of what Netflix has as episode two.  When it aired on TV, the first two were aired together.  Watch at least until the end of the second episode before making your decision!  Be forewarned, however, that Sci-fi did not pick it up for a ""sequel,"" so the ending leaves some things in the air."
NetflixBestOf,3dhufu,Cheesedoodlerrrr,8,Thu Jul 16 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"I watched this just two weeks ago, and I'll tell you it is a lot more interesting than it initially appears. Great show, especially if you are looking for a miniseries with a unique concept"
NetflixBestOf,3dhufu,IAmNotNicCage,2,Thu Jul 16 12:28:33 2015 UTC,Maybe I should give it another try. The first episode came off as cw melodrama in space.

NetflixBestOf,3dhufu,IAmNotNicCage,3,Thu Jul 16 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this one despite some of the flak it gets for not being picked up and resolved properly.  The concept was interesting from the outset, but some of the big plot reveals were what really cemented me to the screen and made me keep watching.  The show was never picked up after the first 6 episodes however, so many of those really interesting plot reveals never got fully resolved while some other ones introduced towards the end barely have any explanation or context.    This series is certainly something I could have gotten behind and watched more of but sadly, that's not the case here.  Maybe some entity like Netflix will pick it up and continue the story and if anything, give some resolution to it.  I'd say it's worth a watch, even knowing there are some major plot points that never get resolved.  It's an interesting concept and one that I think most sci-fi fans will get into.  It is somewhat of a slow-burn initially, with a big plot reveal happening at the end of the third second episode but before that it's a lot of development of characters and their role in the show.  edit: episode and timing correction to my last sentence."

Well, I think some movie characters are ""deep enough"", and I have never been able to watch a TV series from start to finish. I do get invested in the characters but I invariably get bored with the plot and stop. This is incredibly frustrating because i don't feel a sense of closure and I frequently wish I hadn't started at all.

For what it's worth, the founder of HOLA explains here what the javascript was doing. Injecting advertisements... they were trying to work out a monetization plan. So, I guess that part of Hola was as dangerous as airport WiFi."
NetflixBestOf,3dfcgn,weirdasianfaces,2,Thu Jul 16 15:22:55 2015 UTC,"Not to mention remote code execution. Did you read the advisory linked on adios-hola? http://adios-hola.org/advisory.txt  Not sure how you could compare it to airport wifi or regular advertisements.    Hola Security Advisory  Title: Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities in Hola Overlay Network Client.  Overview  Hola 'Unblocker' / Hola 'Better Internet' / Hola 'VPN' is a commercial service offered on a  'freemium' basis that advertises itself variously as a censorship-evasion and  privacy/anonymity-enhancement tool. The number of users is difficult to quantify objectively,  but estimates range from 8 million users at the low end, to 42 million users as claimed on the  Hola website.  The Hola Unblocker Windows client, Firefox addon, Chrome extension and Android application  contain multiple vulnerabilities which allow a remote or local attacker to gain code execution  and potentially escalate privileges on a user's system. Additional design flaws allow a Hola  user to be tracked across the internet via a persistent ID. Furthermore, as Hola users -  wittingly, or otherwise - act as exit-nodes for the overlay network, each is capable of acting  as a Man-in-the-Middle for other users of the free or premium Hola network, or its commercial  'bandwidth' service, Luminati, and thereby compromising the privacy and anonymity of their  browsing and exposing them to further attacks.  Issues  The Hola software creates an API server listening on port 6853 of the loopback interface  (127.0.0.1). The server exposes JSON and other endpoints over HTTP, setting an  ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"" CORS header, which allows a remote website to read the  responses for requests to these endpoints, and thereby enumerate sensitive information, as  well as affecting the security and integrity of the system.   Local File Read   The ""/file_read.json"" endpoint allows a remote website to read arbitrary files on the local  system via path traversal. The files can be read up to the first null byte.   Information Disclosure    The ""/callback.json"" endpoint provides uniquely identifying information about the users  local Hola install. An attacker could exploit this issue to persistently track a Hola user  across the Internet. When nodes are acting as exit nodes, they also obtain implicit unique  identifiers for the traffic they relay, compounding the privacy concerns. The ""/procinfo/ps"" endpoint provides internal debugging information of the Hola software.  With certain query arguments, the information provided contains pointers to functions that can  be used to defeat ASLR (Address space layout randomization). This would make it easier for an  attacker to exploit memory corruption, such as a buffer overflow and other vulnerabilities,  potentially allowing the attacker to achieve remote code execution in the context of the  service in conjunction with other bugs.    As it happens, remote code execution is achieved without the use of the infoleak.   Remote Code Execution    The ""/vlc_mv.json"" endpoint allows files on the local system to be moved. The ""/vlc_start.json"" endpoint allows for the bundled VLC executable to be run with full  controlled arguments. Together these vulnerabilities can be utilized to gain arbitrary  remote code execution. Details will be fully disclosed at the discretion of the researchers  when some time has elapsed for users to remove the software. If an attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack against a target running the Hola  client on Windows - either as a network adversary, ISP, intelligence agency or another Hola  client acting as an exit node -- they can create a connection seeming to originate from the  hola.org or client.hola.org hosts to the local websocket port.    This web socket connection can be used to download a remote file and execute it with either  the privileges of the logged in user, or as SYSTEM, depending on what version of the client is  installed (browser extension or Windows client). The Android app is also affected by this  vulnerability, which can be used to remotely execute arbitrary code as the Hola app user.  An  XSS vulnerability on the hola.org or client.hola.org domains could also allow an attacker to  exploit this issue to remotely execute arbitrary code.   Privilege Escalation   The Hola software creates a websocket server listening on port 6863 of the loopback interface.  The software checks the Origin header against some whitelisted values, but this can be spoofed  if RCE has been achieved. The Windows client runs its service (hola_svc.exe) as SYSTEM. The  websocket server allows access to commands implemented within the service such as ""wget"",  which downloads a file from a remote server, and ""exec"" which executes a file with the same  privileges as the service. Therefore, the websocket can be abused to escalate privileges if  the Windows client is installed.  Affected Versions  Hola Engine for Windows and the Hola Firefox addon on Windows are vulnerable to the first  described remote code execution vulnerability. Hola Engine for Windows is also vulnerable to  the privilege escalation issue. These versions along  with the ""Chrome app on Windows"" .crx  extension (hola_chrome_ext_dll_1.7.333.crx) distributed on the Hola website and the Hola  Android app are vulnerable to the second described remote code execution issue, the  information disclosure and local file read issues.  Solution  No solution yet exists. Uninstallation of the Hola service, Firefox addon and Android  application will prevent exploitation of these issues. To fully uninstall the Firefox addon,  %localappdata%\Hola must also be deleted. The researchers cannot sanction any mitigations  except to remove this software definitively from any affected devices. To fully uninstall Hola  Engine for Windows, in some cases, deletion of C:\Program Files\Hola is also needed."
NetflixBestOf,3dfcgn,5py,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"Half of what's in there is nonsense (a lot of browser extensions make you a unique tracking target, for example), a quarter are problems created by the architecture of Windows (pretty sure Hola needs to run as a windows service).  Two things in there worry me: the endpoints that allow moving and reading arbitrary files.  I'm sad to say though, this pamphlet is mostly fluff without real information. I'd be very interested to see a more technical write-up, especially concerning the reading/moving files.  Thanks for taking the time to link this to me. It's at least two steps up from what was written on the adios hola webpage."

It just sucks that she didn't remember it in the end. I'm kind of pissed that Light died like biotch though. His reaction to being discovered was so pathetic. It was kind of a let down. I guess it was completely different in the manga though, so that makes me a little more happy. I wish he would have gone out like a bad ass. However, I think that L, M, and N were ultimately the righteous good that Light was so desperately trying to become. He wanted a world without evil, and his death was one step closer to that. He went from killing bad guys to killing anyone who got in his way or anyone that discovered him. He was no longer good and it was fitting that he had to die in his world he created."
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,MarlinBaratheon,3,Wed Jul 15 06:36:12 2015 UTC,SPOILERS  Yeah I get that.  I was just so disappointed at so many turns in the show.

I also kind of wish they didnt make her out to be such a bitch later. I was so sad when L died. The only happy thing I had was his dad died happy. I dunno.

I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of shows that mess with your head. It isn't bogged down with love stories or unnecessary filler. The whole series is 37 episodes and has a conclusion so there's no waiting for new seasons."
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,pkakira88,36,Tue Jul 14 20:41:30 2015 UTC,You sold me on the 37 episodes with a conclusion. I hate animes that just won't stop.
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,DrShocker,14,Wed Jul 15 01:35:08 2015 UTC,"There's actually a really good explanation for this. A lot of the times anime is used as a marketing tool to sell the source material, the same way that American cartoons are tied to you sales. If the source materials finishes but the anime isn't as popular they won't bother to finish the anime."

Definitely one I'm going to watch again in the near future.
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,SrsSteel,4,Tue Jul 14 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"I would recommend looking up the final Manga chapter if you are still interested in Death Note. The finale is quite a bit different in the anime, although they kept the ""soul"" of it. Also, the manga has an epilogue that the anime did not include, which shows what the (surviving) characters did after the events of the finale, mainly Near and team. I seriously recommend you check it out if you liked the series!   PS: If you need help with it don't hesitate to tell me, there are sites were you can read manga online for free so I could look it up for you."
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,GuardianOfTriangles,2,Wed Jul 15 06:40:18 2015 UTC,I tried looking it up and had no luck. If you have a link I would be forever grateful! I would love to see the manga ending.
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,Lyude,4,Wed Jul 15 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"I just found it. I am linking you to the penultimate chapter so you can see how the final scene unfolds in the original manga. Also be sure to check the epilogue after the final chapter. Enjoy! (Remember that Manga reads from right to left, so the panel at the upper right corner would be the first, and then the ones at its left and so on).   www.mangareader.net/death-note/106  There are also (live action) movies that take quite a different approach to the story, changing it pretty significantly, but I don't know if you would be interested in that. There's also a special ""recap"" anime OVA that is pretty much a summary of the first half of the series that has an alternate ending for the story right after the death of L instead of continuing with the second half with N and M. I could link to that alternate ending for the anime if you're interested, I think it's on YouTube somewhere."

NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,Lyude,2,Wed Jul 15 06:54:29 2015 UTC,"Is the ending good? I stopped watching after the episode in which.. An important character dies. This is because I heard that after that episode, the show goes downhill. Is that true? Should I continue to watch? Because, if I stop here, I am pretty content with it ending there."

NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,dbe7,2,Wed Jul 15 05:57:10 2015 UTC,"N and M were definitely lacking in character development, but I feel like they did pretty well for what they were working with. I wish they had just kept the original and extended his story line out."
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,AgentZen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:07:38 2015 UTC,That episode where an important character dies was my favorite; it was so well done and honestly I'd have been happy if the show ended there.  The episodes after that felt kind of repetitive but I thought the ending was decent and there were some cool moments yet.  I just felt that none of them were as good as any of the previous episodes.

NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,reallycooldragon,6,Wed Jul 15 03:51:29 2015 UTC,"Anime is like movies or books in that it has genres. It would be weird to say ""I don't like movies"". Maybe you don't like a particular genre, like kid's or fantasy, but there's genres for everyone. Anime is just like that. When people that don't know much about it think ""anime"" they usually think about the Shonen genre, which are series aimed at boys (like Dragon Ball for example). But as you can see with Death Note, there is anime aimed at older audiences, and there are more genres that you could imagine. Thrillers, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, gore, dramas, comedy, you name it, and subgenres for each one. So I would like to say to any person that dislikes anime because they think all of it is the same, to look for a genre that interests them!"
NetflixBestOf,3dapz3,frostysnow,2,Wed Jul 15 07:03:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I had a friend tell me that he hated anime, and I got him to watch a few that I though he'd like (Steins;Gate, HxH, and TTGL) and he's been a fan since."

NetflixBestOf,3d97nb,generaltsao,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:09 2015 UTC,"The Mytharc was pretty fucking awesome until middle season 6. It never fully made sense but it didn't have to. It was compelling as fuck. Seriously, some of the best episodes were Myth ones. The monster of the week were amazing and fun but the Myth is was held the show together. It was the glue that prevented it from feeling aimless, procedural and cheesey.   After Two Fathers/One Son they pretty much wrapped up the Myth into a nice bow. And then meandered for 1-1/2 seasons until Mulder left and they finally had a purpose again for season 8. It's not as good as 1-5 but kicks seasons 6 and 7's ass because those seasons were boring and aimless. It's a good thing they never made a season 9 or a second movie. Because they probably would have fucked those up."

Love the MotW now, and tend to gloss over the over stuffed and self serious myth arc eps"

NetflixBestOf,3d97nb,Tyler11223344,2,Wed Jul 15 16:31:35 2015 UTC,I disagree. Season 8 had amazing closure. We know more about super soldiers and how this colonization is going to be executed. We know that the conspiracy didn't die with the syndicate. We see mulder and scully more or less retire from the game with a son and a chance to build a life. We see skinner fully embrace the xfiles and vow to defend them. Doggett and Reyes will continue milder and scullys work starting with an investigation of their own evil boss.   Basically characters got closure and the story got to live on in our imaginations. Season nine took all that potential and wasted it. It didn't really give us anything interesting. Doggett and Reyes proved boring and incompetent. Scully loses the family she finally built and mulder just shows up for a clip show and a trial that goes nowhere. Complete waste of time.

As for some different genres...I love the show Portlandia. It's a skit-based comedy show starring Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen. May take a certain type of humor, but I know a lot of people that really enjoy it.   Another one I really like is House of Cards. I'm sure you've heard all the rave about it, but it really is worth the watch. It's politically suspenseful with just the right amount of drama and deception. If the political jargon doesn't mesh well with you, you'll be sure to appreciate the terrific acting of Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright.   My third recommendation is near and dear to my heart. Directed by David Lynch, Twin Peaks is a cop show with a twist. With 2 long seasons the storyline will keep you intrigued."

NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,starkbeast,2,Wed Jul 15 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"Check out the series The 100. It only has one season, but it's really good.  When nuclear Armageddon destroys civilization on Earth, the only survivors are those on the 12 international space stations in orbit at the time. Three generations later, the 4,000 survivors living on a space ark of linked stations see their resources dwindle and face draconian measures established to ensure humanity's future. Desperately looking for a solution, the ark's leaders send 100 juvenile prisoners back to the planet to test its habitability. Having always lived in space, the exiles find the planet fascinating and terrifying, but with the fate of the human race in their hands, they must forge a path into the unknown.  The acting is really corny the first two episodes, but it gets better.  Some good movies are God Bless America,  Oldboy (the original), City of God, and The Iceman."
NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,RearNakedGrope,4,Wed Jul 15 18:24:07 2015 UTC,DareDevil. Sense8.  For some comedy: Better off Ted or Dead Like Me.
NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,waspocracy,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:21 2015 UTC,Ah totally forgot to add Dare Devil and Better off Ted to my list. I really liked both.  I'll check out Dead Like Me.  Sense8 though..seems like a lot of people like it but there's also quite a few people saying it's kinda preachy. Is that the case? I have no issues with rights/acceptance but I don't really want to watch a show that glaringly forces their views into the story. It's always really easy to pick up on and instantly kills a show for me.
NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,waspocracy,2,Mon Jul 13 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I never thought of Sense8 that way, but I can totally see it with the openly gay/lesbian scenes and what not.  I'm just wrapped in the idea of people learning that they can communicate with each other regardless of where they are and help each other out with their certain skills. Kind of reminds me of Heroes in a way.  Speaking of Heroes, I would recommend 4400 if you liked Heroes. However, keep in mind that it stops suddenly due to cancellation so you may want to stop after season 3, where it has an appreciative ending."
NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,jamesdomingo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:06:35 2015 UTC,"Gonna piggy back on this. I never felt like the series was too preachy, although there are some early scenes in San Francisco and some scenes towards the middle in Mexico City that could be a little heavy-handed. However, the characters are awesome and the story is great!   Definitely go check it out."
NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,Llewllyn,0,Wed Jul 15 02:46:11 2015 UTC,I going to assume by Mexico City scene you mean the part in the museum.  I didn't think it was jarringly preachy.  Yes there was some serious talk about finding strength to be yourself.  But it was super appropriate for what was happening with the characters.  If your talking about the flash backs in San Fransisco to the festival on the lawn.  Then yes that was a little over blown.  But it was also really helpful in helping to define why those two characters have such a deep connection.  I mean Nomis girlfriend does some way over the top stuff for Nomi.    Actually my favorite part about Sense8 is that while yes there are several openly LGBT characters.  None of the linked characters ever even talk about it.  Everyone just accepts each other and moves on with their lives.  And I think that's a great message.  It's very subtle but profound.  It's really awesome to see LGBT characters in a show who simply happen to be LGBT.  It may changes how some of the dialogue goes but it's not a core feature of the show.
NetflixBestOf,3d6d87,jamesdomingo,2,Wed Jul 15 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the characters are really well done and that the series doesn't veer off into full on afterschool special mode. Lito's character is somewhat defined by his sexuality (his inability to come out of the closet and the consequences that it has for the people around him). We also see some of this with Nomi's relationship with her mother, who cannot accept that her daughter is transsexual. Of the two characters, I think that the series does a better job with Nomi of introducing this information and then moving on from it so that the character can participate in the overarching story. Lito doesn't really do this until the end of the series, but when it does happen it is awesome.   On the other hand, I think that it would be a disservice to the series if the issues weren't addressed. The Wachowskis and Straczynski are very consciously making a statement about what it means to be human and how human differences shouldn't prevent us from connecting (my reading admittedly). Ignoring (or not talking) about  issues related to sexual identity would be almost as bad as not including LBGTQ characters."

The rest of the film is up to you."

I just think the way people talk about it makes it seem like a brilliant film with the most intricate plot that you can't possibly understand in one viewing without intense effort. I would much rather have been introduced to it the way you just described it."
NetflixBestOf,3d1rxs,satisfried,2,Mon Jul 13 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"That's how it was introduced to me. My buddy raved about it, because it's a good story, but he was more impressed that a few guys with no money and little experience churned out something so good. In fact, in a way, that's kind of what the movie is about haha.   I remember it being a little tricky to follow at first but not as incomprehensible as some claim. I'll have to watch it again, it's been several years."
NetflixBestOf,3d1rxs,topcutter,2,Mon Jul 13 10:13:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is what pushes into the realm of the truly great. There's nothing fantastic about it.

NetflixBestOf,3d1rxs,satisfried,3,Mon Jul 13 19:47:43 2015 UTC,It was just a couple of engineers talking for two hours. Which is what made it realistic but not exciting to someone expecting a thrill ride.

But, they know that there is something more. There is some idea, some mechanism, some accidental side effect that is standing between them and a pure leap of innovation. And so, through trial and error they are building the device that is missing most. However, two of these men find the device and immediately realize that it is too valuable to market. The limit of their trust in each other is strained when they are faced with the question, If you always want what you can't have, what do you want when you can have anything? (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Primer received broadly positive reviews in the mainstream press. The website Metacritic rated Primer at 68 out of 100, while the similar site Rotten Tomatoes reported that 73% of the critics that saw the film gave it positive reviews, and the site listed it as one of the best science fiction films ""for the thinking man (...or woman)"".

It should also be noted that they skip a big portion of the story.

NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,Corrik,162,Sun Jul 12 18:26:24 2015 UTC,It wastes everyone's time.
NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,hinotezeke,21,Sun Jul 12 18:30:50 2015 UTC,I hate when they do that and they all seem to do that...
NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,dam072000,31,Sun Jul 12 18:35:00 2015 UTC,There is this odd belief that relationships are boring. Teasing things out for as long as possible will give you much better ratings. I hate it as well but it seems to work like magic on large swaths of the teenage population.
NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,hinotezeke,17,Sun Jul 12 19:21:31 2015 UTC,It's probably seen a boring because it is something outside of the target audience's experience. All of the romantic teasings are well within their social repertoire and that allows them to relate. :/
NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,dam072000,5,Sun Jul 12 19:48:26 2015 UTC,"Part of it is because in Japan the anime industry has to cater to the more extreme fans, and pairing up the main protagonist with one of the girls risks alienating the fans who like a different character.

NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,Sabrejack,25,Sun Jul 12 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"What's your definition of romance? Longing looks and constantly interrupted confessions? Because that's endemic of most anime romances, shounen and shoujo.  That's like saying Nisekoi is also a great romance, not just ship-baiting.  The currently airing Ore Monogatori! is a much better example of romance in anime.  It actually involves dating which, strangely enough, is downright novel in anime."

By the time it ended, I was majoring in Japanese in college (not because I liked anime - though there were plenty of people in my classes that took Japanese purely for that reason). The art/animation had improved dramatically but the story was still repetitive. The 167 episodes + 26 more episodes was far too much but I still look back on it pretty fondly."

NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,gandalfblue,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I only watched the first couple episodes. I had a friend who had seen it tell me the broad arc of the show (or at least what was available), it it seemed to continue on the course the first episodes set: having terrible people for the main characters that the show treats like good guys.  And that's the problem. With Game of Thrones, a character does something horrible, and it's presented as such. The show had bad characters do good things and asks you if they can be forgiven for their past sins. This show, it feels like the Red Wedding would happen while heroic music played, because the show itself thinks that these characters are good people.  It's a weird distinction, but it grosses me out in a way that I have a hard time describing. It would be like if the main characters were the Game Makers from The Hunger Games, and they prove how good they are by NOT taking the mangled corpses of dead children and turning them into horrific chimeras. They're the good guys! They only facilitate the games and the murder of children.  EDIT: I also find Minority Report and the whole future crime thought police thing to be pretty heinous as well, but that movie at least had the decency to say ""Well, maybe the whole thing is not a great idea"""
NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,recipe_pirate,9,Sun Jul 12 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"The world in Psycho-Pass isn't such a strawman dystopia like in Hunger Games where society is clearly evil and pretty much exists so that the main character can fight it.  That's about as compelling as the classic Dark Lord in fantasy who is evil for the sake of being evil.  It works in children's and young adult works of fiction, but it doesn't hold much philosophical depth.  The dystopia in Psycho-Pass is morally grey.  Yes, it's repressive and unfair to some individuals, but for the majority of people it works.  Crime is nonexistent to the extent where most people don't recognize murder or rape even as it happens in front of them.  People are given the jobs that suit them best, and they're kept happy.  It's a lot like Brave New World.  From our perspective, the Sybil System is clearly evil, but it's also the best they have.  What's the alternative? Society would literally collapse without Sybil holding it up.  The series is more about learning to live with Sybil and to reform it from the inside rather than to burn it all down and have everything miraculously work out like in other stories.  As for your first point, even in the first episode it shows that Akane disagrees with the established system.  Rather than listen to her superiors and the Sybil system to shoot the victim because her crime coefficient was climbing too fast, Akane chose instead to talk her down."
NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,FireworksNtsunderes,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:28 2015 UTC,"This is a good write-up for the show, and I agree with what you;re saying wholeheartedly. The society in Psycho-Pass (and really, pretty much every character in the show) sits somewhere uncomfortably on this gray spectrum of good and evil. Nobody is just purely bad, nobody is purely good, and if it seems that way then you, as the viewer, have made a fatal mistake. Psycho-Pass is very straightforward with how morally ambiguous much of it is."

NetflixBestOf,3d15oe,Migz968,3,Mon Jul 13 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"Spoilers.  I'm going to agree with you here, Psycho-Pass was passable, but it was far from ""Good"", finished watching the entire series.  Seemed like pretty standard Anime Fare, although I did appreciate the avoidance of anime tropes.  I think what really bugged me about the anime came in episode 1, when our hero consoled a raped women and brought down her distress enough that she was no longer asked to be executed by the Sibyl System.  This, instantly makes one wonder if A: The Sibyl System was simply wrong all along, and the people could be rehabilitated or B: The sibyl system was right all along, she couldn't be rehabilitated, and lowering the crime coeffiecent was a ""mistake"" so to speak.    The Sibyl system also has the ""crime coeffienct"" vary based on the plot, and COMMITING CRIMES can make it go down, and for some reason art and culture make it go up.  One of the stupider scenes in the series is when you realize the sibyl system has prisons, but people never improve their mental condition after being put in prison, and they never attempt to give the people in prison any sort of therapy.  Yet nobody seems to be bothered by any of this, and without variation among those working in the Public Safety Bureau they don't question it.  Most of the criminals in the series, rather then being relatable rounded characters, are completely insane.  The most well rounded character still occasionally does things that makes no sense, like torture akane indirectly just for the sake of it.    Generally I feel this show suffers from understanding human psychology about as well as a grade schooler.  Even the Sibyl System seems to have a grade schoolers understanding of human psychology.  People within the police do not seem realistic, the villians do not seem realistic, sanity/insanity seem to have a black and white differance with a visible ""snapping point"", and the sibyl system is pants on head retarded when you really think about it yet is simultaniously presented as so omnipotent it can show Akane its deepest secrets because Sibyl knows she will never tell.  In reality, such a system would regularly result in the executions of people that were just a little bit off, or a little bit mean, and again the police experience absolutely no cognitive dissonance.  Really, the show was best on a surface level.  It had lots of style and good action, I just felt like it pretended to be MUCH deeper then it actually was."

But the entire city seemed to be filled with crime and sucked.  When you see death note, they push the message across that people are literally fanatically worshipping Kira they are so happy about his presence, one of his worshippers but there are also many that are unhappy, some of the police whisper about the positive effects he has, some people sort of shrug and accept the new status quo with mixed feelings, it seems realistic.  In 1984, you see people accept the tyranny of the party to protect them from the other, and because everything they read tells them that they're great, and unrest is systematically stamped out.    But in psychopass, they never really establish at any point that anybody within the system is happy, they all seem miserable about their situations.  Everybody is a deluded little lemming and it's actually hard to reason why.  Why don't we see a single person, with a normal crime-coefficent who is openly against sybil for purely ethical reasons?  Is there something in the series that would stop that from happening?"

NetflixBestOf,3d3cfm,zkell99,3,Mon Jul 13 13:16:29 2015 UTC,will add it to the list
NetflixBestOf,3d3cfm,thenormalaccount,4,Mon Jul 13 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"Cowboy Bebop is much much less Japanese and is considered one of the most western inspired animes out there.  It's often considerred a ""beginners anime"", easier to get into then a lot of anime trope filled stuff.  It has a very similar feeling to Champloo despite the lack of Asian themes, and if you like that ""Wandering around aimlessly"" feeling well... you're in luck.  Watch the Dub, not the Sub, the creator of the anime considers the English VA for Spike the best VA for Spike and the Dub is overall FANTASTIC.  I feel the western setting really helps the english VAs come off, in some ways, as more authentic then the Japanese ones.  However, both the Dub and the Sub are high enough quality whichever you watch first will likely become your favorite.  It's my second favorite Dub of all time after Baccano!  I'll also mention that Bebop gets a ton of hype online, and there aren't any individual episodes of bebop that will really live up to the hype it gets.  It's a real example of the whole being more then the sum of it's parts, which is something I really felt about Champloo as well.  Just try and go into it with no expectations and enjoy.  Beware Spoilers."

NetflixBestOf,3d3cfm,Frito_feet,3,Mon Jul 13 06:37:03 2015 UTC,"Miyazaki    I am a fan, but have not made it through all his works yet.   Trigun / Attack on Titan.   New to me, Titan seems like the story is something I could really get into.  I find it hard to articulate what I like in manga. Part of the enjoyment is because of my unfamiliarity with the basic plotlines and tropes.   Champloo was a little different b/c it was so well executed visually that I enjoyed tuning my brain off and wandering along edo period japan. If you know anything that replicates that feeling, it would scratch this specific itch.  Miyazaki is great because it is so fantastical that you're ""spirited away"" to somewhere else. That's a little different than Samurai Champloo, where i don't feel nearly as much suspense or anticipation, Champloo is very relaxing to watch.   So, I guess what i am looking for is aesthetically well put togther manga with novelty. Not dragon ball z, not a substitute for ""the expendables"""

NetflixBestOf,3d3cfm,waspocracy,7,Mon Jul 13 12:57:38 2015 UTC,Ruroni Kenshin is one of the classics imo.
NetflixBestOf,3d3cfm,waspocracy,6,Mon Jul 13 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"Noragami and Eden of the East are both still on Netflix I believe. Both are short - 10-12 episodes, with polished animation.    EotE is a near-modern day globe-trotting scifi/mystery. It begins with a Japanese student visiting DC and a naked man holding a gun appearing in front of the White House.    Noragami is a modern day fantasy similar to the beginning of Bleach or Inuyasha. Girl almost dies and her soul gets knocked loose from her body. She enters into a partnership with a down-on-his-luck kami to fix her situation. Some very beautiful animation and music in this one.    For something in a feudal Japanese-type setting, there's Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit. Also very impressive animation and detail in this."

NetflixBestOf,3d3cfm,waspocracy,4,Mon Jul 13 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"Amazing art/music: Mushi-shi. I didn't really enjoy the stories, but it's among many anime fan's favourites.  Sengoku Basara is pretty good and it has a lot of funny moments. It covers the history of the Japanese warlords. It's similar to Dynasty Warriors, only with Japanese warlords.  Another one I highly recommend is Wolf and Spice Spice and Wolf. Although, you have to find another platform to continue it like Crunchyroll. I honestly wish I watched this show when I took economics 101 back in high school. It's actually amazing how much it teaches you about market prices and currencies, while having a great story to go along with it.  Last Exile is an extremely gorgeous anime that I recommend. Heartbreaking too.   Eden of the East is worth watching for its art and music alone. The story is psychological along the lines of Death Note. But the artwork really stands out.  Last recommendation would be Kill la Kill. The show is okay, although it's a huge hit like Mushi-shi, but the art is very unique.  Edit: Thanks /u/Miyelsh for correcting me. It's Spice and Wolf, not Wolf and Spice. Dammit."

Especially having a brother 2 years apart from myself, hard to watch them both just fall apart.   edit[SPOILER]: I think the doc could have been better put together from a timeline standpoint (of when they interviewed Tas). Maybe he fabricated some events as a coping mechanism, I think that's a real possibility. Trying not to spoil too much for other people interested, but he may have felt guilty for sort of abandoning his brother and tried to make up for it by creating a bigger legacy for his brother."

I stormed the field during a college football game when I was like 15 or so and I remember that it was pretty scary for a few seconds after the initial rush of running onto the field went away. My cousin and I got the fuck out of the middle as soon as we realized that more and more drunk college students were converging onto us. Still one of the best nights of my life but if one of us had tripped or something...   Definitely worth a watch even if you're not a huge fan of soccer, it's really a story about the incompetence of the police and a lesson in how organizations shift the blame when they fuck up. 96 fucking people..."
