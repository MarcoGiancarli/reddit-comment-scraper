Inhalation devices make it ""substantially easier to overdose on alcohol"" than drinking, because the alcohol bypasses the stomach and liver and goes directly into the bloodstream, and because the user does not have a reliable way of determining how much alcohol they have taken in. Inhaled alcohol cannot be purged from the body by vomiting, which is the body's main protection against alcohol poisoning. Inhaled alcohol can dry out nasal passages and make them more susceptible to infection. There is also a potential increased risk of addiction. Direct inhalation may cause nerve damage, brain swelling and, in the long term, dementia."

ifiwonthelottery,3cj9an,JorusC,6,Wed Jul 8 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"Do a bunch of research before you jump on it. The reason pellets are hard to come by is because Europe buys a huge portion of the 28 million tons of pellets used each year. Because they export huge ammounts those buyers get priority becaise they are shipped in bulk, not bagged and palletized.  Wood isn't extremely easy to come by, and most logs are worth more as lumber than they are as pellets so that's why they're isn't a huge priority to make pellets.  On top of the wood cost you have huge fuel costs in trucking material to, and finished product from a factory that are very volatile due to fluctuating oil prices.    I don't doubt for a second that the demand is there, but I know first hand the costs and projected profits in the pressed log and pellet industry aren't huge.  I really commend you on wanting to create jobs and find a niche market. Just be sure you are looking to break even or profit so you don't lose your shirt :)  Source: 14 years in and around the forest industry and working closely with a company that tried to get a firelog plant off the ground."

ifiwonthelottery,3cj9an,hazybluez,2,Wed Jul 8 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are EXTREMELY nervous about storing large amounts of propane, plus, the costs of installation is higher. I've personally traveled around my state (Maine) quite a bit and I've only seen a handful of houses with a ""Winter supply"" of propane in their back yards.  Straight wood heat is done, but it is a lot of work. Usually it is stored outside, then largish pieces are carried in and used. It is a high science to run a wood stove without getting too hot, too cold, or burning the house down. You also have to deal with the large amounts of ash.  So yeah, propane is generally out (Even though it is economical), wood heat is more work than most people want to do, so that leaves electric, oil, or pellets. Oil is expensive, electric is FUCKING LUDICROUS, and pellets are economical with only a minimum of extra work compared to wood."

ifiwonthelottery,3bb3h3,nist7,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:32:40 2015 UTC,"4k is not that far off for a nice suite..it may not get you the top of the line room on a ship but that's about what I was seeing when I was dream shopping for some cruises and was checking out suite rates.   There are certainly different levels of suites...and at the top end of the nicer suites it can run up near $9k.  Just priced a week in Eastern Carib for a week on the new ship for RCI and for the top end SkyLoft Suite, it was about $9k per person. But there were several other suite options you can have as cheap as 4k down to ""junior"" suite at about 3k.   I think for me even if I won the PB/MM jackpot, I'd be ok with just a medium level suite at around 4-5k instead of the highest end...because to me it would already be amazing compared to the sardin carbin for the regular cabins"
ifiwonthelottery,3bb3h3,nist7,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:58:57 2015 UTC,"For RCI, you can have a fairly nice suite for 4k, there may be more expensive ones out there for sure. Some of the nicer smaller ship cruises with very high end luxuries can run 10k+ per week and depending on length can go up to 20k+ as well.   Which cruise lines were you looking for that was 20k per person per week? That's a fairly pricey deal at about $3k/day/person"

I don't think I'd really value a 9k cabin vs a 4-5k one...to me probably will still amaze and awe either way."

It's because it doesn't pass our emissions/safety standards.  I've heard of people buying them and storing them in a garage until they are old enough to register, or buying one to trailer around as a track car. I've even heard of people buying them and registering them as another Nissan model for use on the street. The problem there is that the government will seize the car if you're caught."

In the case of the photo, it appears the integrator designed the mixing room very specifically. The angle of the walls (and likely the angles of the opposing walls) were designed to properly support the selected speakers for optimal listening at the mixing desk chair area. It's highly likely there is also a subwoofer lurking about somewhere.   If you don't often need to sit elsewhere and listen, it's OK to do this. Especially if you are a ""one man show"" in the mixing room.   Don't forget: your mixing room monitors are just ""step one"" of the listening process. You'll want to play back your tracks with various subwoofer settings (esp ""on and off""). You'll want to listen through an alternate pair of standard speakers (mix monitors are designed to be as ""colorless"" as possible; music fans will likely have more prosaic speakers in their home). Then you want to listen through headphones, through earbuds, through a shitty boombox, from behind a closed door, etc. You'll be amazed at what you pick out when you ""listen like a customer"". |  What sounds awesome through your ultra-clear $20,000 monitors may not sound so groovy through a pair of mid-level bookshelf speakers.   Then, there comes surround...ugh. Let's not discuss it."

I always thought it was a little on the hilarious side. It did help get an idea of what it would sound like played through a smart phone or similar type of portable system and it would certainly highlight any crazy tonal peaks in the mix that the HUGE!! PA speakers or the monitors might have masked."

It is generally considered that Spain's Sorteo Extraordinario de Navidad (Spanish Christmas Lottery) is the world's largest lottery and has the largest first prize jackpot. In 2012, the main jackpot was €720 million (US$941.8 million). The total prize pool in 2012 was €2.52 billion (US$3.297 billion). (Using a 13 December 2012 exchange of €1 = US$1.308.)  The tickets for this lottery have pre-printed 5-digit numbers, with each set of numbers sold multiple times in several so-called series. For example, a ticket with the number ""00001"" was printed 180 times under different series numbers. This results in the jackpot always being split across multiple winners. The 2011 main jackpot of €720 million was paid out as €4 million (US$5.2 million) to each of the 180 tickets with the number 58268.

ifiwonthelottery,3ahfi3,NouveauWealthy,15,Sat Jun 20 11:24:29 2015 UTC,"I probably spent too much time coming up with this, but here's what I'm thinking:  Women:  $11 million a year.  $30,000 for a model/escort to spend a week with you (educated guess) times 7 girls on average.  Honestly, if there's anything I've learned from porn, it's that once you get >3 girls together it kind of becomes a spectator sport, so aside from the instagram pictures I don't see the point in having more than 2 or 3 girls.  If you wanted 2.5 girls on average, that'd be more around $4 million a year.  House:  $1.5 million a year.  I have no idea where he lives, but mortgage payments on a $25 million house is like $115,000 a month.  If he's bi-coastal, it could be a little over $2 million.  Cars:  $250,000 a year.  Depends on how ridiculous and show offy you want to be.  Just kind of guessing here 48 month term car payments for a handful of $200,000 Porsches, Ferraris, Aston Martins, Jags, ect.  Yacht:  $1.5 million a year.  Yearly payments on a $20 million yaht.  Jet:  $2.5 million a year.  Payments on a $20 million private jet.  Fuel for private jets is insane though, so probably another million to actually use it.  Helicopter:  $100,000.  They're around $2 million.  Payments are pretty negligible compared to other stuff.  Parties:  $1,000,000.  Pure guess.  Travel:  $500,000.  Already accounted for part of it with the private jet.  Total:  About $19 million.  But if you want to be a little more thrifty with only getting 2 or 3 models/escorts, only having one house, and renting yahts and private jets when you're gonna use them, you could probably get it down to about $8 million a year."

Finance them with low or zero interest, put the extra cash into some bond or CD. If you plan on swapping cars a lot just lease them. You'll be spending maybe $30k or less per year per supercar.   The P1 on the other hand (which is Deadmau5's) is probably the only one that will appreciate or the very least hold its value.

(with IIWTL I am always thinking of the big jackpots) A lot of those cars could be picked up off the used market since they aren't in production any more. Insurance would be high but with a multi-car policy and low mileage clause it actually wouldn't be that bad, relatively.   Example, there is a producer guy in town that owns a bespoke Pagani Huayra 730S ($1.5m+) and a 918 Spyder ($900k). His networth is only $5m. Not sure how he does it, but it can be done.

ifiwonthelottery,39lk19,michaelzelen,12,Fri Jun 12 16:08:49 2015 UTC,I usually figure 20-30. I'll only play if it's over $100m advertised. That's ~50m in the pot and about 20-30 after taxes.  Then I go on to consider the excitement of walking into a large law office and demanding to speak with a partner of the firm. Working out all of the little details and building a team of financial advisors...  Edit: My budget would be like $800k a year. Every $1 million properly invested should yield roughly $40k per year in perpetuity.

See below:  First things first is to pay off my personal debt as well as my parent's debt which should clear a small chink of it out. Then set up trust funds for my siblings, accessible at 25 ($250,000 each?). Set up a retirement account for my parents. Set up college funds for littlest cousins. Gift like 50K each to the people who have helped me and my family out in our darkest times.  Not really sure where that leaves me, I wouldn't be too much out of cash after I secure the future of my family and return the good karma of our beneficiaries.  Then I would get my financial manager to tie up enough of it in low risk secure investments to give me guaranteed returns of at least a upper middleclass lifestyle (80-100K). So in case I turn into a money wasting drug taking fast life living megalomaniac, I know I can depend on that money I tied up in whatever portfolio my financial manager had set up for me. The rest of my investments can be mid to high risk.  Then I would have my 'fuck you, lets have fun' money I really don't live extravagantly in my IIWTL dreams and I'm not a car guy at all. I don't care for mansions, but I would like to get a nice apartment/loft in downtown Manhattan. I would like to travel a lot as well. I don't know, maybe spend $200,000 a year? Thats a high estimate considering I don't like drugs, big houses or big cars (which seems to be the downfall of lottery owners).   Honestly, I would be baffled with so much money that I would probably live a nice upper middle class lifestyle on the regular. Probably get one of those therapists to try and reconcile me with my newfound wealth."

ifiwonthelottery,38usai,mcstafford,5,Sun Jun 7 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"First thing to be aware of: if you try to get your full payout up front, your winnings will be cut in half. Otherwise, you're looking at a ~$70k annual payout for decades.  In terms of learning how to invest your money wisely, what you do in the first year is probably the most crucial. Learn the phrase compound interest - that is how your money starts making money for you.  I love cars myself - personal favorites are Broncos and FSJs - but if you're going to spend your winnings on them, think of them like investments. I like the 1970 GTO, hell of a car and it will likely increase in value with time. I'd caution against dropping too much on the old Chevy, because if you pay your cards right it will just be a toy, and down the road you can afford to spend a lot more on it.   As for fucking around for a year, just don't let it affect your goal for the future. I fucked around during law school and nearly didn't make it out alive.   One expense that will be well worth it is a financial advisor. Let him (or her) make the decisions about where your money goes, at least while you're still learning yourself. Get the degree, get a job that is comfortable for you, and treat the winnings as secondary income.   Develop yourself, find what makes you happy, and pursue it, knowing that in the not-too-distant future you can live off the interest your investments are earning.   Think about it like this - $10 million, earning 10% interest, will give you a million a year to play around with. But $70k only gives you $7k. $10 million means a mansion, college tuition, a boat; $70k means money for booze and weed. Both are great, but only one will give you long-term security."

Bought it due to three main reasons: My head didn't hit the headliner. My legs can be fully extended in my seat position. And it's got a good amount of power (enough for me).  The back driver-side passenger has -no- leg room when I'm sitting, and the middle passenger has a large ""bump"" where the RWD-driveshaft goes through.   For me alone, I can drive it in for days. I can sleep in it without problem too. So can my front passenger. The rear passengers? Yeah, have fun sitting in there for 5+ hours. It's terrible for them.  I've got an AWD Venza as well (a shooting break/SUV type body) and I've got amazing leg/head room, as well as all other passengers. My model only fits 5 but they have 3rd row seats as a factory option. Makes similar HP, very nice interior, nice sound.

I hope Cadillac did it right because I love the idea of a lightweight, quiet, quick sedan, made in America and can stand on its own two feet against the rest of the world.

The only thing Bose has done well is make small speakers sound like big speakers.  When it comes to car audio, you’re getting an average system being marketed as high end.

I sponsored racers in Cali a while back and I was building their engines for them, so I was looking at using commodity chassis or subsections, stripping them and then using a computer design some different skins/bodies to put on them, out of carbon fiber. Then put a high performance engine in it, based off commodity engines with good aftermarket support.  I got to where building a lil 4 banger, 500hp N/A engine was nothing. And I was cranking out 4 and 6 cyl engines turbo'd engines with 600-800hp, engines I could turn into superleggera by replacing a lot of that metal with titanium and CF. Removing metal, poking holes in other parts, etc.  But shit happens and your life gets derailed through no fault of your own.  Still have a few engines laying around, and still have a couple import cars (Nissans) that can run down and pass a Ferrari. Body kits, turbos, superchargers, all kinds of parts. Been selling it off little by little. If I start up again, things will be different.  I'm also toying with the idea of diesel hybrids. Did you happen to see that Audi R18? Sick ass car.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzI93pMhaLM  Be mindful... 200mph Diesel! Lol. There's a telemetry video around... you're like, wait what? It just passed 322kph?"
