Its much cheaper to live there for a reason. I live on the border of chandler gilbert and mesa and I'll tell you first hand if your moving to the valley, look into moving into chandler or gilbert.

Everything is very nice, it's not ghetto, lots to do, and it's just more home feeling then any other part of the valley in my opinion. Mainly because it's the suburbs where people live at.  Casa grande is a smaller town not too far from the Phoenix metro area. I wouldn't live there because it's too small for my tastes.

But it kind of sounds like your parents are into that. These cities would all be better choices than Casa Grande, because of their proximity to Phoenix or Tucson on the off chance that you (or they) want to go a museum, or go to a restaurant where the salad doesn't come out of a drawer. Casa Grande (speaking from driving through and every once in a while stopping at In-n-Out) is full of chain stores, chain restaurants, and outlet malls. The only major employer I can even think of there is Frito Lay.   If your mom has health issues does she really want to be driving from Casa Grande to Phoenix (or Tucson) on a regular basis? The 10 is balls during rush hour and you're like, stuck there.  If they really think traffic and population is going to be a problem in Phx metro (it's not) then go to Tucson."
arizona,3dyt23,thebluearcane,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:34 2015 UTC,"Casa grande is actually a pretty decent place to live on the north side, south and south west side are pretty bad in terms of crime and such. i've been living in CG for about 3 or more years and i haven't been robbed or shot at so i don't know why people in the comments thinks its so bad still.

arizona,3ddsua,redditforgotaboutme,2,Wed Jul 15 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"America's Toughest Sheriff is apparently also America's Most Desperate Sheriff.  And America's Most Conspiracy-Minded Sheriff.  And possibly America's Most Easily Duped Sheriff.  Newly released records show Sheriff Joe Arpaio spent at least $120,000 on a confidential informant last year in his effort to discredit U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow, the federal judge who found that Arpaio's deputies racially profiled Latino drivers.  Despite the misgivings of one of his top aides, Arpaio continued to funnel money to Dennis Montgomery, a Seattle computer programmer, in an effort to nab Snow and others in Arpaio's growing legion of political enemies.  Because the guy is so darned credible.  Montgomery's the confidential informant who in 2003 reportedly convinced the CIA that he had software that could decode secret al-Qaida messages. He reportedly claimed that Al Jazeera was embedding secret barcodes into its broadcasts, revealing the targets of intended terrorist attacks.  It was Montgomery who flagged the CIA on a plot to hijack certain incoming international Air France flights just before Christmas 2003, prompting then-President Bush to ground the flights. Turned out there was no plot, not so much as a single barcoded message. Playboy magazine in January 2010 dubbed Montgomery ""The Man Who Conned the Pentagon.""  James Risen detailed the ""plot"" in his 2014 book, ""Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War."" ""Montgomery was the maestro behind what many current and former U.S. officials and others familiar with the case now believe was one of the most elaborate and dangerous hoaxes in American history,"" the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter wrote.  So a Montgomery-Arpaio alliance? Match made in heaven.  Montgomery had apparently claimed that he could use his nifty software to prove that Snow had given the Department of Justice permission to tap the phones and e-mails of MCSO as it sought a scoop for its own civil racial-profiling lawsuit against Arpaio, according to sheriff's documents.  Dubbed the ""Seattle Operation,"" sheriff's officials hoped that Montgomery could show that Snow was working with U.S Attorney General Eric Holder and others to conspire against Arpaio.  Despite warnings from Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan that Arpaio was chasing a phantom and risked angering the judge (mission accomplished), the sheriff continued to pour RICO funds into the Seattle Operation.  And in return got …  … Video from the Al Jazeera network.  Genius plan, but hey sheriff, couldn't you get that video by subscribing to cable TV?  Arpaio is currently facing contempt-of-court charges for failing to obey Snow's 2011 order to stop his immigration patrols. Arpaio has admitted wrongdoing and said the order ""slipped through the cracks.""  ""I didn't know all the facts of this court order, and it really hurts me that after 55 years … to be in this position,"" Arpaio said in April, during his contempt-of-court hearing. ""So I want to apologize to the judge that I should have known more. This court order slipped through the cracks.""  Perhaps if it had been aired on Al Jazeera he might have paid attention?"
arizona,3ddsua,redditforgotaboutme,2,Wed Jul 15 20:23:18 2015 UTC,Thanks a bunch. What a crock. Hope he gets locked up and violated like the 400+ child Latino rape cases that were never investigated.
arizona,3dj2cq,satanisativa,12,Thu Jul 16 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but your post is... weird. You shouldn't let the media so easily form your opinion of a state or a people. Most of us aren't sovereign citizen, gun-totting rednecks who are out looking for trouble. We're normal people.  Joe Arpaio is the sheriff of Maricopa county. Tucson is in Pima county. Tucson/Pima is a bit different than Phoenix/Maricopa. One of these things is not like the other.  You can find historic weather info for Tucson here.  I'm unsure about camping areas. I suspect Google will be your friend in this regard. Take care."
arizona,3dj2cq,thoughtcrimeo,-9,Thu Jul 16 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"Right, but I have to travel through Maricopa county to get to Tuscon, right?   I really don't think I'm ""preoccupied"" (per another post) with aggressive law enforcement when CO tags are specifically targeted (which I'll have on my car, of course) and it's not completely out of left-field to be arrested on bogus charges. I just want to go to AZ and come back with no trouble. If taking precautions makes me seem weird, that's fine. I don't like police and want to stay as far away from them as possible. I'm avoiding, not instigating.  I know AZ people are great, I specifically said so. I know you're not all Jared Loughner clones. It's your fairly heavy-handed government I'm covering my ass from, not the friendly metalheads I'll be puking in the desert with."
arizona,3dj2cq,thoughtcrimeo,5,Thu Jul 16 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"If you interact with any officers down here they are more likely to be City, not County. County cops respond to happenings for the whole county so most of them are going to be in the boonies. Anyway, it won't take long to drive through Maricopa on the highway.  I haven't heard of anyone from CO being harassed here due to the legalization of marijuana. I think I'd read an article about that in regard to Utah. Anyway, don't bring marijuana to Arizona from another state. I believe we have the medical variety now but I'm unsure as to laws governing this area. Go the speed limit.   I know you're not all Jared Loughner clones.   That guy is literally insane. Yeah, most of us are not literally insane. Tucson is generally considered the liberal part of the state, if there is such a thing. Chill out, don't break the law, and you'll be fine."

Don't bring your weed, don't do anything overtly illegal, and everything will be fine. As a cop once said to me: slow down and don't draw attention to yourself.  As far as camping in your car, I don't know. You might try finding a campground or RV park, but some require an actual RV.  There are also a bunch of motels around Speedway near I-10 where you can get a room for like $45/night."
arizona,3dj2cq,wee0x1b,-6,Thu Jul 16 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"As a cop once said to me, ""this is my town. You don't like me? Get the hell out.""   Speedway near I-10 where you can get a room for like $45/night.   Yeah, I'd really like to camp this one out. No motels for me."
arizona,3dj2cq,wee0x1b,3,Thu Jul 16 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"As a cop once said to me, ""this is my town. You don't like me? Get the hell out.""   Well, we probably have different experiences with law enforcement. I just treat them like they're doing a job (even if I don't agree with what they happen to be doing in particular with me) and let them get on their way with as little stress from my end as I can manage. Seems to have worked out so far.   Leave the weed at home, wear your seatbelt, make sure all your lights work, drive normally, you'll be fine.   Yeah, I'd really like to camp this one out.   The car thing I'm not sure about. Look for a Walmart. I know they let people use their parking lots overnight. Check with the manager, too."
arizona,3dj2cq,ConvertsToMetric,-2,Thu Jul 16 22:03:56 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the tip, but I was hoping to hit some open space.  I dunno, maybe I have the wrong idea about the state, but I kind of thought that there were natural areas all around most major cities. Maybe I'm projecting, but up here, you can drive 15 minutes out of the city and find some nice areas to sleep the night. Am I mistaken? Are camping areas less common than I thought? Like I said, I'm willing to drive a bit to spend two nights outside, under the lovely Arizona night sky."
arizona,3dj2cq,ellius,4,Thu Jul 16 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"It was the ""10 miles or so"" that threw me.  There's not going to be much within that range. Tucson's a fairly large city.  It's really spread out.   To the south and eat you have fairly flat desert, but also the airport and a large air base. To the northwest you'll have like 20 miles of low-density urban city all around the highway.  So you might have to look directly west of town, though most of that is a national park that you can't stay overnight in.  The Mt. Lemmon area might be a better choice. Try Rose Mountain Campground.   I've been up there, it's pretty."

I guess I was a little off in stating that he ""describes himself"" as a socialist in that I haven't found a reputable source where he makes that statement. On the other hand I'm not sure if there's really a practical difference."
arizona,3d9nxw,canoneros,2,Wed Jul 15 02:08:33 2015 UTC,Venezuela is having issues for a lot of reasons outside of socialism. They are a poor food producer and have had a lot of political instability because of the region they're in. They've also done a terrible job of making strategic allies. There are lots of countries where socialist programs do well. Look at Canada or the Scandinavian countries or even the UK. Programs do well there because they can sustain them. Venezuela put the cart before the horse in a lot of ways. You can't institute a bread line with no bread. It creates black markets that destroy the economy.
arizona,3d9nxw,1994bmw,0,Wed Jul 15 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Sanders supporters don't think about the state of affairs in Venezuela, or they'll say 'It's not real socialism' despite it being real socialism a few years ago."

I volunteer for the campaign here in AZ and I haven't seen any other supporters of Bernie on the side of the Maduro regime. My full support to Leopoldo López and the release of political prisoners, Maduro is a despot. That being said, Sanders is a democratic socialist which - although seemingly misleading - is a heavily regulated form of capitalism that just unfortunately shares the word with socialism. He has said time and time again that the policies he wishes to implement are based on the European left's more liberal (but still, in fact, capitalist) economic policies (i.e. Sweden, Switzerland and so on)."

It's not a fallacy, it's direct commentary and parody. It wasn't meant to do anything but entertain me (which it did). I also like how you immediately abandoned your position when I proved you wrong (Sanders deodorant comment was real, not a strawman, and real dumb at that). I'm not sure why I even talk to Sanders supporters.  Honestly I hope he wins, especially more than any economically free market candidate (are there any?). That way when he sets everything ablaze with his inane policies we can put these silly old ideas to rest... again...

arizona,3d9nxw,latewire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"It's so funny that absolutely every news publication that covered that quote didn't share your interpretation. You can contort his words to say anything you want... or try, I guess.  Perhaps if you weren't so anxious to apologize for your favored political candidate, you'd have googled the full quote and see there's no mistake."
arizona,3d9nxw,dpkonofa,2,Fri Jul 17 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't need to google the full quote.  I watched the interview where he said it.  And he's not my favored political candidate, but you're free to continue to make assumptions.  I just absolutely hate when people try to argue a point by either being disingenuous or lying, regardless of what political party, topic, or statement.  It's like when people try to argue that you can get the exact same computer as a Macbook for half the price (and I'm typing this on a PC!).  The specs might be similar but saying that it's exactly the same machine is ridiculous.  Just because you don't care about the difference between aluminum or plastic doesn't mean there isn't one.  The funny thing is... if you actually had any kind of real principle or thought put into your positions, you wouldn't have to distort or misinterpret people in order to make your point.  I'll give you another shot at it, though.  Here's the full quote:   HARWOOD: If the changes that you envision in tax policy, in finance, breaking up the banks, were to result in a more equitable distribution of income, but less economic growth, is that trade-off worth making?  SANDERS: Yes. If 99 percent of all the new income goes to the top 1 percent, you could triple it, it wouldn’t matter much to the average middle class person. The whole size of the economy and the GDP doesn’t matter if people continue to work longer hours for low wages and you have 45 million people living in poverty. You can’t just continue growth for the sake of growth in a world in which we are struggling with climate change and all kinds of environmental problems. All right? You don’t necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country. I don’t think the media appreciates the kind of stress that ordinary Americans are working on. People scared to death about what happens tomorrow. Half the people in America have less than $10,000 in savings. How do you like that? That means you have an automobile accident, you have an illness, you’re broke. How do you retire if you have less than $10,000, and you don’t have much in the way of Social Security?   Now tell me, specifically and succinctly, what part of that quote can be interpreted to mean that ""having too many choices of deodorant leads to child starvation""?"

You do understand that (though not always wrapped in the color you like), your society has been voting in policies and politicians just like this for decades upon decades...and yet results worsen...and somehow you people still think that more of the same (statism, nationalization, fascism) will make it better.  This time it will be different!  We just need to vote harder!   You do understand, don't you, that giving a central authority more power to supposedly reign in the greed and malfeasance of ""the people who've gone so long without paying their dues of living in america"", is exactly what got us here in the first place.  That's their club, friend, not yours...always was and always will be.  You only play onto their hands.  Please give science a chance and really study economics, rational ignorance and the problems inherent to democracy, public choice theory, complex systems and emergent orders.  You may just see what perspective I'm coming from."

Who said anything about fascism? Why should I have to play into someone else hands my whole life? I'm not going to sit and abide to someone else's will. We can vote it in, we can vote it out. Problem is people don't really vote a lot.   I can't understand how rational ignorance can play into who we elect as a society. Because at this time in OUR society, it's vital that we elect someone who will act for the people, and not the money influence."

Best thing to do is to look at the websites for wherever you are going to be.  Ive been out in the Alpine area and had rain for 2 days straight and the forest rangers came by our campsite and told us there were no fires allowed starting the next day.    It sounds silly BUT a forest fire SUCKS!  What I've done is just gathered all the gear I need so I dont need a campfire.  I bought a camping grill and stove, so I can cook.  I also got a camping  heater so we can keep warm with no fire.    It sounds like it sucks BUT when you dont have a fire and dont use white lights (use red lights at night) You can see the night sky SOOO much better.  Im an astronomy nerd so seeing the milky way with no light pollution is something that puts me in awe every time."
arizona,3d671r,RangerBacksFan,3,Mon Jul 13 21:17:13 2015 UTC,Generally the parks will have a sign at the entrance that lists the fire danger and whether fires are allowed or not. You can always stop into the ranger station and/or visitor center and ask.

arizona,3cxzgh,tylerrelytyler,3,Sat Jul 11 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"Generally, the Salt River tribe lets DPS police the 101 freeway, but if you get off the freeway, you will encounter PMSR police officers, especially if you go East of the freeway where it's more residential.  As for schools, there you are under federal laws; the Gun-Free School Zones Act (GFSZA) signed in 1990 makes it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1000 feet of a school.     That means technically if you're driving past or even near with a gun in the car you're in violation.  This alone makes it tricky to not violate the law in major cities (what if you live near a school???) but generally speaking, if you're there on other business, not fucking around and not attracting attention, cops will look the other way.  It's not like they're doing random vehicle searches.    However, if you get pulled over for something else inside a school zone and have the gun in the car, they could charge you and the penalties are severe, 5 years/$5,000 and never be allowed to own guns again.  I am always extra careful to not have anything in my car (or worse, leave something in the car when my wife is driving my car) when I go to pick up my kids from school."

I think they get 14 people in stadium style seats. The driver was more self amused than entertaining, but he was informative. He also made some dumb efforts at scaring the passengers and probably hurting them, at least making them uncomfortable. After a week of back pain from the ride, I had to see a chiropractor.

I understand that they are in a competitive business but as these are public roads / trails, they need to share them with all in a respectable and safe manner.  I just want to sit back (focus on looking instead of enjoying driving), learn some regional history, and get back ""home"" safe."

arizona,3cv9z0,mrjackspade,2,Sat Jul 11 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"Like the other poster said, it really depends on what part of the state you're in but I'll try to give my opinion on the questions you've asked based on the premise you'll be in the Phoenix metro area....  1) Summer is hot.  :)  We got a late start this year but typically things start heating up in April or May and relief doesn't kick in until October or early November.  There are days/weeks where we don't go under 100 degrees overnight, but it's not that bad in my opinion as I spend much of my day in the comfort of an air conditioned office.  100* to 115* range is not uncommon but we do have a thing we call ""monsoon season"" here and it will assist with the temps and provide a little dust and rain but will also raise the humidity which is otherwise not really there (i.e. it's why we say ""it's a dry heat"" here).  2) T-Mobile works fine for the most part in the metro area.  Once you head out of town, you're not going to have 4G LTE... and coverage can be sketchy but if you're a city slicker you should get by pretty well (note: I can no longer make calls from the underground parking garage at my work but if that's the worst thing about saving money then hell, I'll put up with it).  3) There are plenty of technology related companies in the metro area, ranging from GoDaddy to Microsoft to Intel to Honeywell, etc.  I've heard of software companies too but haven't really paid much attention to that arena.  4) Uh, state... no... metro area.. yes.  The largest ""high speed"" provider in the Phoenix metro area would probably be Cox and I find it more speedy and/or reliable than Centurylink.  You can check out their website and learn more about speed at www.cox.com.  Of note, some apartment complexes have exclusive deals with internet/cable providers so in the event you don't secure a house, you'll want to make sure the apartment complex will allow Cox.  5) I think west coasters (well, Arizona isn't exactly on the coast) are much more laid back than east coasters... but, that's probably a biased opinion because I'm from the west originally.  I think there are different kind of people everywhere you go though, so no, not everyone here is going to be nice.  6) Uhhh... you should be able to find decent housing within the price range you're currently paying for your apartment.  There are areas in the metro area that have cookie cutter houses and then there are older houses, that typically have larger lots, etc, just kind of depends on what part of town you want to be in and what you want to pay, and how updated you want your house to be, etc.    7) See above.  8) There's all sorts of shiz to do.... from outdoorsy stuff to entertainment to breweries, etc.  We do have an art museum but I've never gone.  You can check out more info about it at www.phxart.org although a quick Google search shows that it appears to be semi decent (4.2 star rating).  9) I think this question was recently asked on the /r/Phoenix or the /r/Arizona subreddit not too long ago... and if I remember correctly the most common complaint was lack of adequate public transportation.... and how spread out things are in the metro area.  For example, I'm not even on the most eastern part of town and it would take me over an hour to drive to the most northwest part of town.  Hope this provides a little insight!  Good luck!  :)"
arizona,3cv9z0,bluestoctober,2,Sat Jul 11 03:52:01 2015 UTC,"Others have given some very good responses to your questions, so let me touch on the things I have experience with:  I live in Arizona and work in software. There are plenty of jobs in the Phoenix area, notably on the east side (Scottsdale, Chandler, Tempe). There are very big employers (Wells Fargo, State Farm, General Dynamics, etc) as well as many small start ups. There are plenty of software opportunities here. That will not be a problem for you as long as your experience is pretty mainstream (Java, HTML, javascript, etc). There aren't nearly as many jobs in Tucson or Flagstaff, the other two big cities in the state.  There are some good museums: Pheonix Art Museum and Musical Instrument Museum to name two.   As far as things to do... Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the country so its like any large city. Plenty of restaurants, shops, and sports (all 4 major professional sports). Phoenix is one of the best cities for city-hiking with Camelback Mountain, Pinnacle Peak, McDowell Mountains, etc within the city limits or very close by (20 minute drive).   We're also close to the Grand Canyon (about 3 hours) and other amazing landscapes in Arizona (Antelope Canyon, Monument Valley, Canyon de Chelly, Horseshoe Bend). We're close to Zion and Bryce in Utah (6 hours) or Arches National Park (7 hours).   San Diego is 5 hours by car as is Vegas; LA 7. San Francisco is a 2-hour flight.   It's a great place to live with lots to do. The ""worst"" part is probably that we've grown a lot in the past decade. Parts of the area are getting crowded, IMO. This has pushed housing prices up which is good if you own but not so good if you are buying."
arizona,3cv9z0,artistec,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:54:08 2015 UTC,MS Stack acceptable? I'm sure c# to java transition wouldn't be hard but iD be taking a step back skills wise
arizona,3cv9z0,artistec,2,Sat Jul 11 19:23:39 2015 UTC,honestly I can't say... I work with Java. I'm sure there are MS positions but I don't know any major employer that uses it. But that doesn't mean there aren't any. You might want to contact a local recruiter to get their opinion.
arizona,3cv9z0,ohheyaubrie,2,Sat Jul 11 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Seems like people answered you pretty well but i just want to comment on Tmobile:  I used to have Verizon. They were expensive and I was annoyed with them so I switched to T-mobile. Well, I live in Scottsdale, which is very populated, and in my house my T-mobile doesn't work and I have to use wifi. It's annoying. Also if I go up to Payson (1.5-2 hours NE) T-mobile 3G AND 4G don't work in town almost ever, and if I go up a bit north a bit more, I 100% lose signal, it doesn't work at all. Verizon worked in ALL of these places, and I plan to switch back pretty soon.   Also as someone who loves art, our museums suck. Phoenix has a cool art scene though and there's First Fridays which is super art oriented, and there's some cool galleries down there, so at least we have that."
arizona,3cv9z0,jmoriarty,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:52:23 2015 UTC,"I think every question you have depends on where in this huge state you're talking about. From Tempe to Phoenix to Tucson to Flagstaff to Globe you're going to get different answers.  But you might want to start with the wiki here and in /r/Phoenix. Both have links to past threads on moving here. Also search those subs for some of your questions.  Also check out both /r/Tucson and /r/Flagstaff, two other larger state subs that are pretty active. That might help you make more specific posts once you've narrowed things down a bit.  Good luck!"

arizona,3cv9z0,TheKunit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"FYI, Maricopa County (PHX metro area) is about 100 sq. miles smaller than NH."
arizona,3cv9z0,TheKunit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"Living up in NH at the moment. I have Raynaud's and I asked my doctor what I could do about it, and she said ""move somewhere warm"".  At first I kinda laughed it off, but laying in bed at night the idea has seemed more and more appealing. I talked it over with my SO and when she graduates, we decided we were going to move to the "" south west "".   Eventually I realized I wasn't saying "" south west"" any more, and had started saying ""Arizona"". I've never even been to AZ, but apparently I've made up my mind!  When we move down, she will be 22 and I'll be 30. Were both very blue.   I have a bunch if questions, and I know I could find some of the answers on Google, but its a lot to process. I figured no one knows a state better than its residents, so I've decided to put my faith in you guys!  If anyone can answer some/all of the questions below I will totally owe you.   What's the climate like? Summer? Winter? Up here its 8 months of winter with 4 months of 90 degree temperatures. How's the cell coverage? Am I going to have to ditch T-Mobile? Is there a strong technology center anywhere in the state? My current job is willing to let me telecommute but in the event that I lose my job I wouldn't want to park my ass too far away from the software development jobs! Is the state wired up pretty well for broadband? I really wouldn't want anything less than 100mbps. How are the people? New england is great, but the people can be cold as hell! Am I going to get weird looks if I talk to strangers? How are the housing costs? I'm paying 1400$ a month for a two bedroom apartment up here, just outside Manchester. I know living expenses are pretty high up here though. Is it realistic to expect to find housing somewhere cheap and semi-private? Up here anywhere you can see your neighbors is going to cost 2500$ a month or more. SO: is there anything fun to do? Museums or such? (She's an art major) 9: SO: what are the worst parts about living in AZ?   I guess I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm super excited to move somewhere warm/flat. I have a feeling that Arizona is going to be a completely different world from the densely wooded ice lands that is NH. I don't even know where to start looking or researching! Thank you for your time!   I'll do my best to describe living here, as I was born here and have lived here for 26 years so far.   The summers typically stay over 110 for all of June July and August, with the worst getting into the 120s and even 132 (highest I ever saw). You don't plan on doing much outside during those months. Even at night the temperature is above 90. During the winter we can get down to about freezing and I even saw snow a few times over the years! Don't expect to shovel snow unless you live in Flagstaff or somewhere else up north.   Cell coverage is great if you use Verizon. I've been with them for a decade or so and can't speak to other companies. As for Internet it's been a struggle to get anything more than 50mbps, and I live in Peoria which is a city to the northwest of Phoenix about a half hour. We have century link and Cox as well as a few satellite providers. Honestly the service sucks but most of the time it's bearable.   I should mention that phoenix and pretty much all the surrounding cities are completely connected and squashed together. This includes phoenix, Glendale, Peoria, Goodyear, Avondale, Tempe, Scottsdale, Mesa, and a few others. Phoenix is the highest population US Capitol city. People aren't packed together like sardines or anything like that. I guess you would just say that all the empty land between cities has since been developed on. There is a great system of freeways that loop around and through all the major areas, meaning everything is very well connected. That and the road system is a grid so it's very difficult to get lost.   Technology wise I believe you will find the downtown phoenix area to suit your needs. Just east is Tempe and I believe that area is booming as far as technology goes. I work in environmental so I really don't have a ton of input there.   The people are nice here, we definitely don't have a reputation for rudeness like new York or anything like that. I talk to strangers on the street all the time and have never found anyone particularly rude for no reason. Traffic to and from the downtown area really sucks during rush hour, so be prepared to have a lot of stop and go commutes if you get a 9-5 in that area. I feel like road rage has generally improved recently as well..   Cost of living here will probably beat out new England no matter what mansion you live in here. I own, and of course Peoria is a good distance outside of the main city area, but my house is a 3700sq ft that we bought two years ago for 215k.. Mortgage about 1200 a month. 4 bed 3.5 bath with a yard and grass and awesome neighborhood with a ton of Parks. You really have to decide what area you want to live in and if you want to rent or buy. Pick your acceptable commute time and work backwards I would suggest. My area also has a lot of homes on huge lots, meaning an acre or more. You can be as private as you want I guess.. I used to do inspections for custom homes in North Scottsdale that people would build literally in the middle of the desert. Nobody for a mile around. Being Scottsdale I'm assuming cost of 500k-2mil or more depending on the year and the builder of course.   Just a side note - prepare to not see real trees again when you come to this area. Unless it's the landscaped tree in your neighbors yard, those type of tall green things just can't grow here without human assistance. You can Google Palo Verde trees, mesquite, some ironwood, and a ton of creosote bush in undeveloped desert lots. Nothing tall, and the trees blossom yellow which falls making sort of a yellow carpet on the ground during the spring. Expect allergies from this crap.   Other than that we don't have much wildlife either. Replace deer with coyotes, and a good helping of cotton tail rabbits, rattlesnakes, and tons of lizards. Plenty of quail too.   I'm sure I'm missing tons of stuff but this ought to help!   PS. The West side is commonly considered the bad side of town. Northwest is great, but considered far away. North phoenix like anthem is well connected on the intersection of the 101 and 17 freeways. Scottsdale is East and northeast and is rich people territory. East like Tempe, Gilbert and Chandler are nice but not as nice as Scottsdale. Phoenix is ghetto at times near downtown but lots of business. Glendale is right in the middle and is getting run down into my opinion. I lived in Avondale and being a white guy I wasn't comfortable leaving the house after dark.   Become comfortable around Mexicans. They're a really hard working and honest people in my experience, but get a lot of shit because of the border issues. Also prepare to be smacked in the face with Republicans, sherrif Joe, and open carry gun enthusiasts, possibly at the same time.   Pm me for specific questions"
arizona,3cv9z0,altairean,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:20:44 2015 UTC,"Very specific, very good answer.   I love the trees up here but I'm honestly excited to get away from them. When you're surrounded by trees you have maybe 3 hours of real sunlight every day, and the rest is shadow.  Its starting to look like I'll end up near Phoenix at this point. 50mbps is kind of a let down though  If iD posted this on the NH sub reddit, three people would have already told me to eat a dick. I'm loving it already."
arizona,3cv9z0,TheKunit,2,Sat Jul 11 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I could help!   And now that I think about it, 50mbps is just what I have, but the company does offer more. That's Cox, I switched recently from century link because they offered 20 and delivered 1.5 for the same price as cox's 50. These companies don't ever fix the issue, just make excuses!   Good luck man, seriously phoenix is a great place with a ton to offer. You will do well here."
arizona,3cv9z0,altairean,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:26:51 2015 UTC,"PS. The West side is commonly considered the bad side of town.   Maybe in your opinion. It seems very wrong though since construction seems to be continuing westward, especially with the completion of the 303.  I think it would be more accurate to say (or maybe it's just my opinion) that the Phoenix metro area has no absolute defined 'bad' areas and 'good' area. The neighborhoods are very unique and interspersed with each other. One block might be total shit and then the next block is million dollar homes. I don't know why it is this way, but it seems that everywhere here is like that.  Scottsdale is no exception and there are definitely crappy Scottsdale neighborhoods. And as a matter of fact, Paradise Valley is in the same situation because of the spawl and the neighborhoods that have Phoenix addresses but the PV zip code."

And what the hell is the connection between this and the inflation lawsuit which he referenced twice during his remarks?"" [Katie] Hobbs said.   I think it's funny that the Republican is talking about spending money, because he has to, while the Democrat is playing the role of fiscal conservative, because she's in opposition. It just goes to show that both parties are the same, and they'll pretty much say anything for power."
arizona,3coax3,furrowedbrow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think your premise is flawed.  Ducey thinks this is free money he can throw at eduction.  A financing trick.  You are right that it is the opposite of conservative.  OTOH, Dems want to spend more on education.  They know the turnips have given all their blood - the only thing left is increasing taxes or changing how we fund the govt.  Ducey's plan is riskier, yet for not much reward.  I think Hobbs just wants to make sure people understand exactly what's going on.  I don't see how either party is performing a role-reversal here.  The Rep doesn't want to spend more on Ed, thus the ""no cost"" financing trick.  The Dem wants to make sure everyone can see that the plan is just an increase in risk, and that we still need to find a way to REALLY fund education."
arizona,3coax3,ohheyaubrie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:28:10 2015 UTC,Can you explain the risk? I'm having trouble understanding this whole thing in general.

It is a small town without a lot of job prospects.  The main activities are four-wheeling, hitting up the lake, playing softball or drinking at the local bars.  I agree with others' sentiment. Prescott over Kingman."
arizona,3cmlal,asufooty10,3,Thu Jul 9 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with the other people here. I grew up in Kingman and I would never consider moving back. The pros: it's cheap af, it's close to Vegas, it's cheap, you can have horses in Butler, and Lake Havasu/Lake Mead is pretty close. The cons: the meth, the rednecks, there is literally nothing to do in town but hang out at Walmart, the school system is among the worst, there are no jobs unless you work at the prison, the power plant, or the hospital, and there are active militia in the Cerbat mountains.   Tldr; don't move to Kingman."

Kingman does not have near the amenities of Prescott, but it also doesn't have the high cost of living nor the droves of retirees either. We have a thriving nightlife downtown (a brewery, taphouse, wine and beer bar, good old fashioned bars and 7 restaurants), low cost of living, close proximity to Vegas, Laughlin, Havasu, etc.  Depending on what your skillset is, employers could be knocking down your door or it could be a bit harder of a search.    That all having been said, we have the same problems that any  medium-sized town has:  Crime, local gov't that seems to disgruntle some, etc.    I hate it when people that have no clue how Kingman IS yet speak as though they do.  I've been here 18 years, since I was 16.  Trust me, things here are always getting nicer.    PM me if you need/want any more details or info."

Sedona is a town between Phoenix and Flagstaff that people love to hike in. It's a beautiful place.  Historic Brewing in Flagstaff makes some great beer.  If you do stay in Phoenix I suggest steering toward Scottsdale or Tempe for the best nightlife and vacation stuff.

The question we should be asking is if it would cost the taxpayers more to operate a fully public prison of the same size. If a public prison of the same size cost 15,000,000, then the state is still saving money even with the 2.5 mil going to a ""rich guys pocket.""   I don't know whether its cheaper or not. I'd like to see a full cost comparison of public vs private prisons of the same size before I jump on the ""waste of taxpayer money"" bandwagon.   And it should include ALL costs, including litigation defense and settlement amounts."
arizona,3cfda0,thatsnotminesir,2,Wed Jul 8 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"With things like the prison system Id rather pay more and not inject profit into our justice system.

Basically the private prison gave 2 judges kickbacks for giving kids HARSH punishments for pretty minor crimes.  http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/23/pennsylvania.corrupt.judges/  That's just 1 article so if you're interested in it do some more research.

arizona,3cfda0,RangerBacksFan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"Private prisons are not the first, or even the most prolific, profit motivation in our justice system. Private practice attorneys are huge in the justice for profit business.  Is it fair that rich defenders can buy a better defense than the poor?  How many people in prison would not be there had they been rich enough to buy a better defense? I'd be willing to bet those judges you are worrying about made their fortunes and reputation in private practice for a price.  I'm not saying private prisons are good or bad. I am asking that, if you think it's a tax payer rip off, show some numbers to prove it.   I'm actually unsure of the private prison issue currently. But when people argue for or against, I'd like to see some arguments and data to back up their opinion either way, rather than soap box preaching and anecdotal examples."
arizona,3cfda0,thatsnotminesir,2,Wed Jul 8 04:04:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's do some math.   Arizona will pay CCA $65.43 a day per inmate. Once the contract is fully implemented, the 90 percent occupancy guarantee will result in the company being paid at least $58,887 a day for 900 inmates — nearly $21.5 million a year. The contract is for an initial term of 10 years, with two five-year renewal options upon mutual agreement. Should the contract run 20 years, CCA could make at least $430 million. Ownership of the facility would transfer to the state after 20 years.   [http://www.azcentral.com/news/arizona/articles/20131204arizona-private-prisons-growing-cost.html](Source)  So the contract is to pay $65.43 a day per inmate to house them in private prisons.   What dos the state pay? According to [http://www.vera.org/files/price-of-prisons-arizona-fact-sheet.pdf](this), about $67.95. So the price offset is pretty close. The state saves a little money. All good?   The Nashville-based company, which is publicly held, said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its average total daily expenses per inmate at facilities it owns and manages was $45.89 during the first nine months of 2013. Based on that figure, Arizona’s daily payment will provide $19.54 in daily operating income per inmate, as compared with $22.23 in daily income per inmate the company typically makes in other facilities it owns and operates.   Ah. So they aren't spending it all on inmates, like the state would. They are pocketing almost $20, or a 29% profit a day per inmate. Nice profit!   The company, which operates 69 facilities in 20 states and the District of Columbia, averages just more than a 29 percent operating margin at all facilities it manages or owns, according to a recent company filing.   Hey, my math isn't bad.   ""Operating margin is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages, raw materials, etc.""   Operating margin is another name for Profit.  Anyways, so we spend almost the same, save a little, and get less for the money spent. But wait, there's more.   A Corrections Department study found it was less expensive in 2008, 2009 and 2010 to house inmates in state-run medium-security facilities compared with similar in-state private facilities.  That still may be the case, but it is difficult to determine because the state no longer factors inmate costs the same way.  In fiscal 2013, which ended June 30, the non-adjusted average daily cost per inmate at a medium-security prison was $64.52, compared with the private-prison cost of $58.82.  However the state’s number includes inmates who have significant medical or mental-health issues. The private prisons house only healthy inmates.  When an adjustment is made for the medical costs, the balance tips significantly in the state’s favor.  The adjusted 2010 daily cost of housing a medium-security inmate in a state-run facility was $48.42, compared with the private-prison cost of $53.02.   My take is that the state pays a bit more per inmate, in the end, and gets less service provided to the inmate. If money is equal to services and goods, then the inmate is getting less of both.  Having said all of this, these contracts require the state to keep the beds full. So if everyone behaves and never commits a crime, then that is bad for business. What will the business do if crime in the state goes down?  What do you think?"
arizona,3cfda0,Nadie_AZ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:59:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I 100% agree with you about the lawyers but since this is an article specifically about private prisons I wasn't concerned with that aspect of our screwed up justice system.  If we're gonna talk about EVERYTHING thats wrong with it we're gonna be here for a LONG time.  Right off the bat, people are getting 20 year prison sentences for selling a plant...  Thats WRONG!  Here's a story about rich kid in Texas that killed 4 people in a drunk driving accident who walked away with probation... (below) That is WRONG!  http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/05/us/texas-affluenza-teen/  I never said it was a rip off, I said that it might not be in the tax payers best interests to allow corporations who's only concern is profits to handle the lives of AMERICANS.  They may be shitty people but they are still Americans.  I hear you on needing facts and data to back up arguments but you say that and then dismiss facts about confirmed abuses between private prison corporations and judges on an ASSUMPTION that they were rich before they started taking bribes.... Even if they were does that matter?  Is it somehow less of a problem that rich judges take bribes and send children to jail on trumped up charges for financial gain?    My argument isn't only a financial one anyway though.  Like I said before, some things are worth paying more for.  Money has the power to corrupt ANYONE, myself included.  If I was a judge and someone offered me a bunch of money to give CRIMINALS, (because that's what they are), harsher punishments I'd probably take it too lol.  I like to think that I wouldn't but you throw a huge stack of money in someone's lap and they WILL change their views.  We are all humans and we all have the same weaknesses, and we all like nice things.  BUT shouldn't we as a society do everything we can to remove as much individual temptation for corruption from our justice system as possible?  Isn't it worth paying double for the government to do it? Isn't that worth keeping innocent people OUT of jail and the bad guys IN jail?  We cant fix everything but if we just say fuck it and let corruption stand what does that say about us?  Is it too hard to fix the problem so we just shouldn't try?  When JFK announced that we were going to the moon he said this  ""We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win""  Is the justice system too hard for us to fix?  I don't think so, we just don't care enough to fix it because we categorize everyone.  'Oh they are criminals, can't do the time, don't do the crime'... Yes, they are criminals but they are also (in most cases anyway)AMERICANS.  Left wing, right wing, gay, straight, christian, atheist, muslim it doesnt matter AMERICAN is what we all are.  Ive done bad things, Ive done good things, Ive done shit that I should probably have gone to jail for too but even with all that I am still an AMERICAN and I still deserve to be treated fairly.  Even a child molester has a right to a fair trial and fair punishment.  Yes, they are terrible people but we as the ""good guys"" can not base our actions on the actions of the shittiest people out there.  We HAVE to be better then the bad guys.    I was raised to believe that the United States was the good guys, how can we be the good guys if we allow corporate profits to imprison people?  How can we be the land of freedom if we have the highest incarceration rates in the world?  According to this article (below)  We make up ~5% of the world population but our prisons hold ~25% of the worlds prisoners...   (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)    When did money become more important that American lives?  Im not saying that we shouldn't treat criminals exactly the way they deserve.  I tend to be an ""eye for an eye"" guy myself I support the death penalty and actually think it should be used more often lol BUT people should be punished fairly for their crimes.  If there's a chance that an innocent AMERICAN is locked up because we tried to save a couple bucks and let corporations take over our prison system isn't it worth paying more and running our prison system ""Of the people, by the people and for the people""?  What if that 'innocent' person was you or one of your family members?  Would that change your mind?  If so, then why doesn't it matter when it happens to other people?  I'm not gonna even get into comparing the incarceration rates between whites and minorities because #1 that's off topic and #2 I need to get to get off reddit and get to work lol  But thanks for debating with me, its nice to hear other people's views with out it turning into a shit throwing contest lol."

arizona,3cfda0,londubh2010,-2,Wed Jul 8 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"""Private"" prisons.  Private is hardly an appropriate word, and keeps too many people barking up the wrong tree.  This is fascism.  This is what always happens to statist societies like ours who place too much faith in democracy and too much power in the government, and don't understand methodological individualism.  And then it allows the government to get people to scapegoat ""the market"" or the ""private sector"", as if there is anything truly private and market-like about their command and control economy.  These ""private"" corporations are nothing but arms of the government.  They are given a government contract, to do precisely what a department of the gov't proper would have done, in the way they would have done it, with the same illegitimate authority granted to the corporation as is granted to the government.  That they make a monetary profit and have shareholders is of only secondary concern (police are not ""privatized"" and yet they are just as profit-seeking and must bend to the will of the chief or sheriff or city hall, and thus they are nothing but a corrupt gang of revenue collectors who have no incentive to protect the rights of individuals. . .just as a corporation must do what the shareholders and board demand; only, in a free market, a corporation will die if it does not do exactly as it's customers, the people not the government, demand).  Most importantly, no one gives a corporation moral license to violate rights the way we do to government.. . unless that corporation is an arm of the government, a government contract.   We need to stop this silly, shallow assessment of the words: ""profit"" and ""private"".  Profit is not just money; it comes in achieving gain, value, and power of all sorts and the act of declaring an institution ""non-profit"" or ""public"" does not exempt the fallible, greedy people running it from the profit motive.  The difference is when you do not constrain that profit motive by proper competition and voluntaryism.  A government holds a coerced monopoly on the goods and services it provides (or contracts out to be provided).  It does not allow competition.  And we're not just talking about competition for the government contract here. . . we're talking about having to cater to the correct consumer (i.e. in this case those who have been legitimately wronged or violated by some person and need prisons in order for justice to be served and for others to be protected from a violent criminal). But ""private"" prisons answer only to the government, and the government does not answer to the people. . . at least not directly enough to align the incentives of the prison corp with the citizens who should be the customer.    Yet, presumably because citizens can vote (as if that has not been shown by public choice theory to be a false sense of control over government), the situation is totally different than if we gave walmart the sole license to tax us, build roads, arbitrate disputes, run criminal courts, make law, imprison people, etc. etc.  It's absolute madness.  When will people learn, that there is a public goods problem inherent to democratic politics:  that is that it will always be easier and more cost effective for an entity with $1 million dollars to affect change in government (create laws, regulations, buy politicians, etc.) than it is for 1 million people with $1 to make changes (or fight the changes being made by the wealthy interest).  The corruption you see is not a bug in the system. . .it's what some of us have been telling you all would happen, for a long time.  The trick is to not give a single entity monopoly power over such important things as law, and policing, and prisons, and infrastructure, and healthcare, and the list goes on.  You can and should expect government and it's ""private"" contractors, to behave just like any monopoly would (but worse for other reasons I'm not even getting into here).  Riot?  Maybe.  Defund and dismantle government?  Definitely."
arizona,3cfda0,kwanijml,3,Tue Jul 7 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Private Prisons answer to shareholders. Shareholders want their wealth maximized. The result? Private Prison costs go up and their service qualities go down. Just like in any other company.   [http://www.azcentral.com/news/arizona/articles/20131204arizona-private-prisons-growing-cost.html] Source   CCA is guaranteed a 90 percent occupancy rate at Red Rock, meaning the state will transfer inmates out of state-operated facilities and into the private prison until the minimum occupancy is met.   How is this good for the taxpayer or the Government?   A government holds a coerced monopoly on the goods and services it provides (or contracts out to be provided). It does not allow competition   Good. Arizona's history shows that private attempts were made to dam up the rivers to whatever use was needed. These attempts failed. The people got together and asked the Government to help. We now have over 50 dams, 100s of miles of canals and a water infrastructure that is responsible for more that 50% of our state GDP. Government wasn't so bad in this, was it?  There are places where Government is needed. To think otherwise is to ignore the world at large and how it works. What would happen if the Federal Government did sell off all the Highways? Private industry would take them, and charge a toll. Do you want to pay a toll to drive to and from any part of the state (or pay a bigger one when crossing state lines)? I don't want that. I'd rather pay a tax to ensure our highways are equally available to all.  Private Prisons answer to shareholders. They are a business. Government should NEVER be run as a business. Why? Because the goal of business is to turn a profit. The goal of Government is to govern. Sometimes that means spending more money than you have (see: War). Sometimes that means spending money in areas where you won't see a financial return on investment (see: Police and Fire). But they are worth spending money on.  We do have an impact on our Government. Thankfully. We are a large country with a large population. Our Government is slow to change, but it does change. It changes when We The People make noise. It changes when They The Money may payments. But we need a Government of elected officials to be more powerful than private groups that answer only to shareholders or private persons who answer to no one. Dismantling the Government is a horrible idea. Horrible. History shows that rarely works out for the best.   I upvoted you because it is good to see opinions on all sides of the argument."
arizona,3cfda0,Nadie_AZ,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"I hate to come across as rude. . . but really, did you even read and comprehend my post?  Because you're literally talking past nearly every point I made and regurgitating pro-government talking points which I either rebutted, called into question, or simply inane platitudes which simply ignore established theory and empirical reality all around you.  Let me make this very clear:  I am not for these so-called ""private prisons"".  I am showing why the outcomes of these private prisons are, at most, only marginally worse than if a gov't dept proper were running them. . . but most of all, I'm trying to get you people to understand that this kind of ""privatization"" has nothing to do with how markets free of government control work, and that corruption in government and this type of privatization are endemic to your belief in the necessity of a monopoly government (yes, even in your worshipped democracies or republics).  So let's examine some of your claims and correct the errors:   Shareholders want their wealth maximized.   As I already explained; so do government bureaucrats and politicians.  You have not explained how and why you believe stated goals or words on paper to be capable of constraining very natural human behavior.  This trick is to not create institutions of power for the greediest, ambitious, and most unscrupulous people to latch onto in the first place.  This is what's at the heart of it.  Until you can explain how, fundamentally, you intend to control human ambition by giving power to other ambitious humans; which the first set of ambitious humans will then buy off and corrupt. . . then you simply don't have an a leg to stand on.    The result? Private Prison costs go up and their service qualities go down. Just like in any other company.   No, not quite just like any other company.  Bear in mind that most every sector of the U.S. economy (and Arizona is no exception) is highly distorted, and is not largely indicative of how free markets function.  In other words: you can't look at what you call ""capitalism"" around you, and blame free markets for the ills. . . a free market has been nowhere to be seen. Big firms have, for a long time, used regulation as a tool with which to protect their cartel or monopoly.  Little guys and startups can't compete with the onerous requirements and the taxes and employment laws, like the big guys can with their economies of scale.  So, fundamentally, much of everything you see around you in the ""private"" sector is artificially big to start with, and is not a good reflection of the effects of market discipline and open competition.  Again, the U.S. economy is more fascist than it is free-market.  Not to mention that the entire money supply and interest rates are heavily manipulated. Fortunately, there are still quite a few vestiges of free exchange and association; and what we do observe from these mechanisms is that large firms can't simply raise prices or decrease quality, as you say.  That is an absurd statement borne of complete ignorance of how business works and completely blind to everything around you.  If what you say was true, then we would not live in the world of wealth and abundance that is all around us.  We have more food than what's good for us (and enviable problem), we have incredible electronic devices that allow us to talk as if face to face with a person across the world, instantly.  I mean. . .It's not even worth me going in to this.  Frankly, you are the one who needs to provide some evidence that the price of goods and services goes up and quality goes down.  That just flies in the face of even the most basic, time-tested economic theory and empirical evidence.  On a free market; you compete (i.e. offer lower prices or otherwise more value of some kind) or you go out of business.  Until you can refute this basic fact of reality. . . you once again have no leg to stand on.  Pick nearly any anecdote you want (and it will be anecdotal only, I can assure you), and I can show you how government interfered directly or indirectly and how it distorted or stifled the expected outcomes of market behavior.   How is this good for the taxpayer or the Government?   Not good for the taxpayer.  Don't care if it's good for government. . . but it certainly is good for those within government getting kickbacks.  Good luck stopping this process, and regulatory capture and revolving doors and corruptions of all types. . . you're not the first society on earth to think they could vote this kind of thing out or pass laws (campaign finance reform?) to make it okay.  You can't stop money from finding power.  What you can do is stop giving power and moral license to people and institutions.   Good.   Bad.  I'm sorry, but how insufferably pompous do you have to be to care so little for your fellow human beings and what they want and what they think?  It is peoples' money (and lives) that you are messing with.  At a certain point; this foments violence.  Don't do it.  Before the point of violence, it falls into the trap of the pretense of knowledge (see: Hayek).  All centralized control of resources suffers inexorably from the problem of economic calculation.  There is a reason that public schools barely teach economics and formal logic.  You cannot make any argument for the use of government to produce any goods or services (even public goods) or interfere in any way into an economy until you understand the calculation problem.  Very, very simply put: it is that value is subjective to the individual (i.e. there is no hive mind and there is no ""good of the people""), and only the individual can calculate opportunity cost and express their preferences through action (e.g. we can all say we want the government to build a dam or a bridge. . .we can even take a poll. . .but this information is useless as it does not take into account opportunity costs: i.e. when we all have to actually pay for it, in an up-front and direct way, how many actually prefer the bridge/dam over the opportunity cost).  You must study calculation further to really understand this; but once again. . . until you at least acknowledge this problem inherent to any kind of command and control of the economy; you have no leg to stand on and no understanding of what you are doing when you claim that something is a ""public"" good or necessary.  What does this mean for your anecdote about dams?  Well, I won't claim to really know the history of what you're speaking of specifically, but I do know plenty of other similar histories and more importantly, I understand correct economic theory and law, and can point out your fallacy:  You are assuming that, those dams should have been built at that time and in that manner (remember, a properly working market is a system of profit AND loss).  That a large entity like government can take over (with tax money stolen from the populace) and successfully engineer dams and produce all sorts of infrastructure; says nothing of whether that was the most productive use of those resources.  There is no non-arbitrary measure of what is ""good"" or certainly what is the most desired use of resources, than to allow people to voluntarily and freely exchange and trade and produce and consume.  You know, a lot of people think that the whole idea of a massive metropolis like Phoenix being able to exist at all, in the desert, is wasteful and unsustainable.  I don't know if they're right.  It's hard to keep track of all the ways that government has subsidized poor decisions and planning all over the economy. We build canals (and don't get me wrong, infrastructure is great and I'm not claiming to know that Phoenix could not be here without government or that free enterprises or public coops would not have sourced water somehow), but we do not allow the market to calculate whether the canals were the best use of the resources or whether there would be better way to source water.  We didn't let the millions of minds who could potentially profit from getting people water in the desert work on the problem; we just handed money to gov't and essentially said: ""build canals"".  And maybe that is the only and the best way to do it. . . but we don't know that.  We build more and more and wider and wider freeways, and then wonder that they keep getting congested. . .ignoring studies that show that highway buildout subsidizes the building of suburbs and living far away from city and work centers.  Do you understand that governments create or incentivize the sprawl we see in Phoenix?    Continued . . ."
arizona,3cfda0,kwanijml,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"Do you understand that every action a government takes, especially with the money it has stolen via taxes; has profound consequences (usually unintended and somewhat removed from the subject so people don't get to see the results clearly and blame the correct source), and distorts market signals.  Profits and losses and money and greed. . . these things are not inherently evil.  They are indispensable societal signals, which allow resources and activities to be coordinated most productively.  You need to get past this high-school-level of understanding of economics that most people carry with them to adulthood.  These things are important, and if you understand them, they radically reform ignorant opinions about how the world functions.   There are places where Government is needed. To think otherwise is to ignore the world at large and how it works. What would happen if the Federal Government did sell off all the Highways? Private industry would take them, and charge a toll.    Showing failure of a handful of private endeavors is hardly indicative of the need for government to provide infrastructure.  Otherwise, by your logic, we should conclude such things as: the government could never have invented airplanes and thus had an airforce, if it were not for the Wright Brothers, the private sector.  That is of course, not true.  You have been taught to believe that markets underproduce public goods (i.e. non-rivalrous, non-excludable goods); but this ignores, firstly, the market test as to whether the public goods produced by government were the most optimal use of the resources, and secondly, that markets provide public goods all the time; you are simply unaware of examples of this in history and modernity. . .and also that most large-scale public goods are monopolized by government and so funding for them is crowded out (and why would people fund alternatives when they already have a workable option and they have been taught that the current way is the only way to do it) and in most cases, competition is expressly prohibited (and sometimes violently put down by the government).    As just one small example:  did you know that many of the lighthouses on the East coast were built privately? (light houses are regarded as a public good, because you can't prevent non-paying customers from deriving the benefit, and seeing the light doesn't preclude others from seeing it or diminish their value derived in any way).  Here's how the market came up with a way to fund lighthouses:  they added value, by building harbors near the lighthouses and charging entry fees; thus funding the public good by adding value with a private, or excludable good.  Would you or I have thought of that?  Probably not.  The point is that when you talk about privatized roads (and I still think you have the wrong conception of what that means. . . .as if simply selling off what the government has created and uphold and fund it in it's current form would be what happens) just implementing tolls. . . you are completely neglecting the profit motive and projecting your own ignorance and inability to think creatively.  Just because you don't have a solution; doesn't mean that millions of entrepreneurs, greedily seeking profit, would not be able to come up with a more convenient and aesthetically pleasing (and interoperable) way to fund roads other than toll booths.  And of course, the reality is that roads are produced privately all over the world and funded in many ways other than toll booths. . . you are once again, simply ignorant of this and have a status quo bias. Markets have all sorts of mechanisms to produce public goods; including but not limited to: lotteries (if the government would stop monopolizing that), value adds, charity/philanthropy, assurance contracts.   Private Prisons answer to shareholders.    And this is where we start arguing in circles.  I have already shown why the same is true for government agencies.  And if you don't see that they too are greedy and unscrupulous and profit-seeking (or power maximizing), then you are completely blind to what is going on in your government and the world around you.   Continued. . ."
arizona,3cfda0,kwanijml,0,Wed Jul 8 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"Government should NEVER be run as a business. Why? Because the goal of business is to turn a profit. The goal of Government is to govern.    Again, what do stated goals have to do with actual outcomes and the incentives at play?  Government is already a business and it has no competition and is given moral license to grow its power and steel from the populace en masse and do just about whatever it wants, by people like you.   Sometimes that means spending more money than you have (see: War).   Dear god.  Do you understand how terrifying this mentality is?  Yes, please, see: war.  Please, go see it. Maybe, just maybe it will wake you out of your stupor. Just like your urban sprawl; your nationalism and spending on ""defense"" have created a war machine and a military industrial complex, the like of which the world has never seen. . . .and it always finds the next dragon which must be slain and whips you gullible people up into a jingoist fury.  Stop taking my money to make war and draft my children into your wars.  War will come to you.  You do understand that your government has been responsible for the needless deaths of millions of human beings over the last century or so?  Let that sink in.  Try to be an empathizing, non-sociopathic human being for once, and understand that even if everything else you said is true (that we couldn't have nice things without government), that that still does not come remotely close to justifying the killing and death and war-machine that comes as a direct result of your empowering a fascist monopoly state.   Sometimes that means spending money in areas where you won't see a financial return on investment (see: Police and Fire). But they are worth spending money on.   More baseless and insane assertion, flying in the face of logic and economics.  We all like food, right?  Food is also like healthcare, in that we die without it, so there's inelastic demand. . . so the governments should provide it so that greedy corporations don't jack up prices, because we'll pay anything to stay alive, right?    What are you people smoking?  Do you understand that you were educated in a Prussian-based government education camp?  Do you think they had incentive to teach you anything that discredits the use of the state in society?  You still have not answered: why the fuck wouldn't you want competition in providing police or fire or anything?  What do you think Walmart would behave like if they were given a monopoly, and why do you think that government behaves any differently; especially when we're living it right fucking now!  If you are so deluded as to believe that the laws you live under and good and conducive to civil society and that your police forces are generally good, with just a few bad apples. . . please, I beg of you: go see my friends at /r/bad_cop_no_donut .  You need to open your eyes.  There is an age-old adage about, ""who watches the watchmen"": there is no answer to that, except: competition.  Competition is the ultimate regulator of greed and human affairs.   We do have an impact on our Government.    Of course you do.  Just not nearly as much as you think, nor in the ways you think.  Do you think that this is just government reacting slowly to the peoples' demands?  Do you think that people before liked and wanted private prisons?  And now, you're enlightened and so you'll simply vote it away?  You may, by the way; as government tends to have to do the minimum necessary to keep the natives from coming out with pitchforks and torches. . . but as they correct their mistakes with the right hand, they'll be screwing you even deeper with the left.  You will be fighting a constant uphill battle, where every step forward you take, you'll slide two steps back.  Empirically and theoretically, democracys (and representative democracy) is failing.  What you have right now is not a bug in the system; it is an inevitable slide towards tyranny.  Democracy is old social technology.  We've moved past it.

What is Rainlog.org? Rainlog.org is a cooperative rainfall monitoring network for Arizona. Data collected through this network will be used for a variety of applications, from watershed management activities to drought planning at local, county, and state levels.  All you need to participate is a rain gauge and access to the Internet. We are asking volunteers to select a rain gauge, install it at home, and report daily total rainfall amounts through the online data entry form.  Why do we need more rainfall data? [A distribution of official gauges in Arizona with large gaps] Precipitation amounts are highly variable across Arizona due to topography and seasonal weather patterns. This is especially true during the monsoon season, when thunderstorms can produce heavy rainfall that is very localized.  The map at right shows a typical distribution of official gauges used to track monthly rainfall amounts. Large gaps exist over many parts of the state. Your observations will help fill these gaps, providing valuable information to be used in drought monitoring and resource management decision-making.  What products will come out of this project? All data posted by volunteers is available in real-time in maps through the data tab at the top of the page. These maps are useful in tracking high-resolution variability in precipitation patterns and potential changes in drought status. As more people participate and more information is gathered, the resolution of the maps will improve.   I'd love to see what the rainfall is outside the big metro areas. Thank you for helping!

As far as the hike goes, get a quality pair of hiking boots, and break them in before you go. You need the ankle support of good boots because there are a lot of rocks on the hike and you don't want to roll an ankle. If you're not comfortable carrying in everything you bring, you can use a mule - we did and it was incredibly helpful. I mostly used my camelback for water, frozen before we left so it stayed cold for a good while. We stayed a week, and my friend's dad left two huge coolers in the back of his suv filled with frozen water bottles, huge ice blocks and a couple blocks of dry ice each. Having cold water to drink when you finally get up those switchbacks was phenomenal!"

You can ride a donkey, a horse, or a helicopter.  The only downside is the natives charge a lot to camp there, but it is definitely worth it. You could rent one of their camp setups, a cabin, etc. You can also just buy all your food at their shops down there if you want. Again, expensive.  Regardless of this specific request I recommend anyone in AZ go here at least once before they leave. Seriously, just google image search Havasupai Falls. The water really is that color too."
arizona,3c0zzm,movzx,3,Sat Jul 4 07:50:43 2015 UTC,An INCREDIBLY easy ten mile one way 5 hour hike.

Coming up is steep, for sure, but the entire thing is very easy. We're talking about a 9 mile walk. Not bushwhacking through the outback.  Do you have problems literally walking on a level surface? I'm assuming OP doesn't because he is seeking hikes. Most people who have mobility issues don't go on hikes."
arizona,3c0zzm,movzx,2,Sat Jul 4 07:48:15 2015 UTC,Unless they're planning on never coming back and not packing anything with them then yes it's easy.
arizona,3c0zzm,ta9g,2,Sat Jul 4 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"There are stores down there. The only thing you have to bring with you is water. You're making it out like walking on a level surface is something humans can't do for extended periods of time with ease.  On the way back the switchback at the very end is wide with firm ground. If you get tired from going up simply stop and sit down. What is wrong with you? It isn't Everest. It's stuff you can encounter in everyday life already. Do you live in Los Angeles or literally any other city with hills in it? Congrats, you can hike this trail."
arizona,3c0zzm,movzx,3,Sat Jul 4 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"Geez mister I dont know why you're getting heated over this. Just dont think ten hours hiking outside is easy when it's up to a hundred degrees out but I'm not as tough as you I guess. But you're right they can buy their sleeping bags, tents, food and flashlights and toiletries when they get down there haha"
arizona,3c0zzm,ta9g,-1,Sat Jul 4 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"You're going to pay a premium, but yes they can get all of that down there. There's an indian village down there whose primary income is tourists. You can rent a cabin for shelter. They have 'deluxe' camp spots with cooking gear, exercise equipment, etc. You can go have burgers and Gatorade all day every day if that is what you want. They even have (slow) public WiFi. It's also not hot in the canyon that far north.  The reason I'm 'heated' is because it is a stupid easy walk and you're making out like it's trekking the arctic. Strap on a camelback. Bring some cliff bars. Enjoy the walk. Enjoy the falls. If you want to stay longer bring more gear (or a healthy pocketbook).  If that's too much for you I already said you can get a donkey or horse ride in, or even take a helicopter. I've seen little old ladies down there for Christ's sake.  OP asked for a hike with a swimming spot. That's a great one. It's beautiful, cold, easy to get to, and something you won't find elsewhere in Arizona. OP didn't ask for a place he could roll his scooter up to and flop into the water. I am assuming some base level of ""I can support my own weight and have a leisurely walk"" type of fitness here."

arizona,3bsci6,oneultralamewhiteboy,45,Wed Jul 1 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"God I fucking hate websites that make you answer stupid questions or makes you enter your damn email address. Here's the article.  During a whirlwind 81-day session, the Arizona Legislature and Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through a historically lean $9.1 billion budget and 324 new laws.  Political insiders describe the session as a honeymoon period for the newly elected Ducey, with the Republican-led Legislature giving him much of what he wanted in the budget and avoiding much of what he didn't want when it came to other legislation.  Some of the most controversial bills, from guns in public buildings to state sovereignty battles, never made it to his desk. An anticipated rehash of last year's fight over Senate Bill 1062 and religious rights was never introduced, leaving Arizona largely shielded from the unflattering national spotlight that's focused on the state in recent years.  Other than the budget, there wasn't a defining issue of the session. But there was plenty that will affect Arizonans' day-to-day activities.  RELATED: 7 new Arizona laws parents should know  Most of the new laws go into effect July 3.  Here are 20 of the more impactful new laws:  Social issues  Reversing abortions: SB1318, among other things, requires a doctor to tell a woman receiving a medication-induced abortion that the procedure could potentially be reversed. Arizona was the first in the nation to pass such a bill, which was based on model legislation by the national anti-abortion group Americans United for Life. The controversial law will not go into effect on July 3 as scheduled. The state and a group of medical professionals that sued Arizona over the law have agreed to delay its implementation until federal courts have a chance to rule on the matter.  Protecting plastic bags: SB 1241 prohibits cities, towns and counties from charging for or banning the use of ""auxiliary containers"" such as plastic grocery bags. Bisbee is the only Arizona city with a plastic-bag ban, although other Arizona cities were considering similar measures.  Release the felines: SB 1260 exempts cats from having to be held at the county pound for at least 72 hours if the cat is sterilized and will be returned to the area where it was captured. Bill sponsor Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, has said the goal is to reduce the cat population by allowing trap-neuter-and-release groups to work more quickly.  Travel ID: HB 2609 allows Arizona to develop a federally compliant driver's license or ID card that residents will have the option of purchasing. Starting as soon as January, the federal government will no longer accept current Arizona licenses as proof of identification at airport security check points for domestic flights. The tougher ID requirements are already in effect for entry to some federal facilities.  Protecting hunters: Under HB 2399, the Game and Fish Commission can revoke the hunting license of a hunter who harasses another hunter.  Studying body cameras: SB 1300 to allow and regulate police using body cameras was amended to establish a study committee that will examine their effectiveness. The committee must make its recommendation by the end of 2015.  Good for business  Expanding breweries: SB 1030 allows companies to keep a microbrewery license until they produce 6.2 million gallons of beer a year per location, up from 1.24 million gallons. It also allows them to have up to seven bar or restaurant locations.  Ride sharing: HB 2135 establishes regulations for ride-sharing networks such as Uber and Lyft, including requiring them to carry insurance, conduct criminal background checks on drivers and inspect vehicles.  Lab tests: HB 2645 allows individuals to get any lab test from a licensed clinical lab without a doctor's order.  Official state metal: Although its been one of the five C's for decades, SB 1441 makes copper the official state metal.  Money, money, money  Gas tax: Drivers will continue to pay a penny-per-gallon tax on gasoline to help businesses clean up leaks from underground tanks under HB Bill 2636. The bill extends the tax, which was first adopted in 1990, for another eight years.  Tightening the budget belt: The historically lean $9.1 billion budget included a number of cuts, including $9 million in savings by limiting low-income parents to a one-year lifetime benefit from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cash assistance program. Currently, the state has a two-year limit. No other state has such a short benefit.  Build the fence: SB 1271 allows the Joint Border Security Advisory Committee to use $264,400 it collected in private donations to build a physical or virtual border fence as close as practicable to the Arizona-Mexico border.  Protecting kids: HB 2517 allocates $900,000 a year in lottery revenue to the Internet Crimes Against Children Enforcement Fund, and $100,000 to the Victims' Rights Enforcement Fund.  Aggressive panhandlers: SB 1094 makes it a crime to solicit money within 15 feet of a bank or ATM, to touch another person without his or her consent while attempting to solicit money or obstruct the passage of the person being solicited.  More license plates: The state will add more special license plates to the more than 50 current special plates. New this year will be plates supporting professional golf, professional hockey clubs, firefighters and community colleges.  At school  Civics lessons: Arizona became the first state to require high-school students to pass a civics test in order to graduate under House Bill 2064. Starting with the class of 2017, students will have to correctly answer at least 60 of the 100 questions on the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization civics test.  Justifying junk food: Senate Bill 1267 allows schools to have fundraisers ""that include the sale of foods of minimal nutritional value.""  Reprieve from testing: SB 1191 eliminates the requirement that seniors pass a standardized test in order to graduate. It goes into effect immediately, but only applies to the 2014-15 through 2017-18 school years.  Back to driving school: HB2308 allows drivers to more often wipe their record clean by attending defensive-driving school. The new law allows drivers to attend school every 12 months, instead of the current every 24 months."

arizona,3bsci6,KnottyKitty,13,Wed Jul 1 22:56:10 2015 UTC,Protecting plastic bags: SB 1241   That sucks. Plastic bags are shitty and the only reason to use them is laziness.   Release the felines: SB 1260   Could someone explain this one a bit more? Why were they held for 72 hours in the first place? Was it to give them time to recover from being sterilized? Because that seems pretty necessary. I hope they're not just going to release freshly post-surgery cats back into the streets.
arizona,3bsci6,dashboardheyzeus,11,Wed Jul 1 22:42:35 2015 UTC,My wife worked for animal care and control and I believe 72 hours was the normal hold for any animal so the owners had a chance to find it.

arizona,3bsq7h,syd_nit,3,Thu Jul 2 17:30:19 2015 UTC,Even Riverside is uptight and in a hurry. During rush hour in Riverside you don't want to leave your house and weekend afternoons mean clogged freeways. In Tucson that stuff doesn't exist. I hear people talk about traffic but they don't know traffic like you and I do.  You don't have to plan your day around the crush of people because it's not here.  Goldbond powder is your friend.

arizona,3bii1f,goodboyBill,10,Mon Jun 29 14:33:32 2015 UTC,"Wait what? You don't have to prove you're a citizen to vote in federal elections, when it says right in the Constitution that only legal citizens maintain the right to vote?"
arizona,3bii1f,Raptor231408,5,Mon Jun 29 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"The ruling allows the federal voter registration form to be used to register. A voter must put their social security number on this form in order to register. The Arizona registration form requires a state issued ID (e.g. driver's license) to be used as proof of citizenship.  The work around that Arizona has created is that people who cannot be verified as a citizen by Arizona standards (e.g. John Smith at 123 Main St) is given a separate ballot allowing them to vote for only the federal candidates (President, US Senate, Congress) and no state level candidates (Governor, Attorney General, etc)."
arizona,3bii1f,fazzig,11,Mon Jun 29 20:08:06 2015 UTC,"That's just dumb, you don't have that right unless you're a citizen. For obvious reasons."
arizona,3bii1f,hks9,6,Mon Jun 29 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"I think the issue was of adding an extra step to the voter registration process if it isn't needed. You already need valid photo id and I believe you also need an SSN to register to vote. Also enough people are not abusing the current system to warrant a change. If anything, they should be working on promoting more people to register to vote and participating in elections."
arizona,3bii1f,MoNeYINPHX,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"How do you know if people are abusing the system if there is no system in place to verify identity?  It has been proven that there is voter fraud. There are organizations that actively encourage it as well as people such as felons who are ineligible but yet still vote. People like to dismiss this fraud as ""minimal,"" but more and more votes are being decided in the margins of hundreds or less. When Al Franken won, it was by something like 120 votes; it turns out later that something like 150 felons voted illegally in that election.   Again, if there is no process to prove identity and secure the vote, how can anyone definitively say ""there is no voter fraud""? People cheat, it is a fact of life. Why do people naively believe that something as high-stakes as the vote to decide who runs the country is so sacred that nobody would dare try to cheat at that, too?"

arizona,3bii1f,ghdana,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"Google it, or you can resubmit a for a new drivers licence(new one that meets airplane requirements) and register then, but you'd need a birth certificate or SSN card to do that. You'll need to be a citizen to register. The test to become one is really easy."
arizona,3bii1f,mspk7305,0,Tue Jun 30 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"To everyone freaking out about how bad this decision is: you are wrong. This is the right decision, and the only one that could logically have been made.  In Arizona, it is up to the Secretary of State to authenticate the ballots. This means they are tasked with tracking down voter fraud and making sure that all the votes cast are legitimate. This is common for many of the states, and they do catch voter fraud... But guess what? Most of the voter fraud committed is registered voters, citizens, voting in more than one precinct. The fraudsters are by and large baby boomers and snowbirds, people who live in X location half the year and Y location the other half. They may not even realize they are committing fraud by doing this, but they are.  Now back to the ruling. Requirements of photo ID at the polling place is bad. Why? Because they have a list of registered voters, and you are on that list. Maybe you don't have an ID because you don't drive. Maybe you are like Ruby Barber and never got documented, despite being born in the USA and having lived here for 92 years. Maybe you live on the Reservation and the closest place to get an AZ ID is over 200 miles away, and making the trip to get that ID would be a financial hardship on you.   Whatever the reason, the Arizona Constitution protects your right to not carry around paperwork, and both the AZ and the US Constitutions protect your right to enfranchisement. The state cannot infringe on that by establishing hurdles to your ballot access.   This is a good ruling."

arizona,3bkvdf,yotechguy,3,Tue Jun 30 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"When I went the tour guides were very on top of the weather and we got a nice long (slightly terrifying) speech about how we needed to stay close to them in case the order to run was called in.  If the weather is looking particularly bad that day they'd cancel your tour.   We took a special tour for photographers that had fewer people and it was great. There were a few spots you had to wait a bit to get a clear shot, but we had plenty of time to explore and take pictures."

arizona,3bkvdf,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:35:54 2015 UTC,"This is actually the best time of year to go for pictures because the sun will be directly overhead and the light beams will reach the ground. I was there in March and the light beams hit the side walls. Still got nice photos, though.  Upper Antelope Canyon is always crowded. But the tour guides do a great job clearing people out and helping you set up your shots. They know the canyon well and know exactly where to be and at what time. For that reason you want to go in the middle of the day - not too early and not too late. Call ahead to get their advice on the best time to see the light beams.   The only possible issue you might have at this time of year, with monsoon, is cloudy skies which means no light beams.   If you want serious photos, you must bring a tripod and a cable release. You should also sign up for a photography tour instead of a regular tour. The photography tour is 2 hours whereas the regular is only 1 hour so you have more time to get good shots.  Lower Antelope Canyon is less crowded. They offer a self-guided 2 hour photographer's pass. You can move at your own pace through the canyon. LAC doesn't have the light beams of UAC but I think it has better scenery. You still need a tripod and cable release."

arizona,3bfp0o,ImJooba,2,Mon Jun 29 02:13:53 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, EPL, MLS, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit, my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown for states/cities/regional subreddits, or my Swears/Word Breakdown for sports subreddits. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

Too many people on that stretch of road for the speeds people like to go at."
arizona,3bf8xu,frackiewicz123,8,Sun Jun 28 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"I will say that it isn't just high speeds, but overly aggressive driving, mostly not maintaining enough space between you and the car in front of you.  All is takes I one slower car in the left lane behind a switchback and you get a multicar pileup. I have seen plenty of RVs and other large vehicles that take the turns way too fast and tip it."

I felt the traffic on i17 is much worse that the 87.  The speed limit was 75 & people were passing me doing at least 95 (guessing).  At those speeds, it doesn't take much of a mistake to shut the whole road down."
arizona,3bf8xu,nickfromnt77,5,Sun Jun 28 19:20:49 2015 UTC,I don't understand what they're thinking. I mean I understand some people speed but +20 miles on a curvy road?

arizona,3bf8xu,noidontwantto,2,Mon Jun 29 05:53:14 2015 UTC,Aggressive driving plus the big trucks slowing way down on those grades (not their fault they cant do 80 up hill pulling 80k lbs) means you get 5 to 10 cars going 75+ suddenly hitting a rolling lane closure with no warning means lots of sudden movements and just a single mistake at the wrong time means a big crash
arizona,3bf8xu,defcon-12,2,Mon Jun 29 05:45:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it's a mix of all these factors. I don't know what'd be a good way to fix it as we know people aren't really going to slow down or tail gating others

arizona,3baiwb,Arctic_rose,10,Sat Jun 27 10:03:34 2015 UTC,"I would recommend living as close to your job as possible. The last thing you want to do is sit in traffic missing out on spending time with your kids and family. I would highly recommend living in Scottsdale if you have kids - you do not want your kids attending Phoenix public schools.   There are other options like Mesa, Tempe, or Glendale. But those can be long commutes (20+ miles one way). If there's an accident, forget it.   I've lived here for 13 years and haven't ever seen any of the ""bugs"" you're talking about. I've never even seen a scorpion."
arizona,3baiwb,artistec,5,Sat Jun 27 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can provide is to move near a freeway.  The valley has a lot of traffic, but if you live close to a freeway you can get around quite a bit of it.  Check out the South Scottsdale/Tempe area - it's within 20 minutes of just about everything good in the valley, and there is a whole lot of stuff to do."
arizona,3baiwb,Vauce,10,Sat Jun 27 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"Might want to ask this in /r/phoenix instead, as that's a bit more focused on the area you're talking about. There are some threads in the wiki over there you may also find useful. Good luck!"

arizona,3baiwb,PPKA2757,4,Sat Jun 27 12:23:40 2015 UTC,"Scottsdale native here, lived here for 20+ years. First off, our ""bugs"" are nothing compared to your bear and cougar population haha. You must be thinking of the South East if you're worried about bugs! Yeah, we have scorpions, yes they can be assholes, but as long as you have your house sprayed by an exterminator you will rarely see them in your home. Snakes almost never come into your house (only had one rattler in my garage ever, and he made sure we knew he was there). All you have to do is call the fire department and they'll take care of it! We get bobcats, coyotes, and Javelinas (wild pigs) from time to time, but they won't bother you if you don't bother them. Then all your typical bugs; bees, wasps, ants, spiders, etc.     Living arrangements within 45 minutes of the mayo clinic (congratulations by the way, that is a wonderful hospital) are vast. Depending on your price range, there are many different options on communities to live in. McDowell Mountain Ranch, DC ranch,  Windgate Ranch, Grayhawk, etc. (all East of Scottsdale road, the boarder between Scottsdale and Phoenix) are great options, but a bit more pricey. There are other areas to the south that I'm not as familiar with, but to get a good idea go on zillow.com, it's honestly great and has helped me find places to live in the past.   Like I said, I grew up here (went to school in Scottsdale) and my parents still reside here. So if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
arizona,3baiwb,snushy,2,Sat Jun 27 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"What kind of bugs? There are scorpions but I've never actually seen one in person and I've lived in Arizona for 15 years. A lot of people do though so just make sure you're careful with shaking out your shoes and looking in corners and stuff. When you walk around at night you'll see some crickets and maybe roaches but nothing too crazy. In every backyard there are little lizards, maybe 3-5 inches that are always crawling around the fence but they'll never do anything. I guess if you live further outside of town you might have some ""wild"" animals but its pretty unlikely in the phoenix area.   Scottsdale/Tempe/Ahwatukee/Chandler/Gilbert are all nice places to live in. Scottsdale is a little pricier, Tempe is more for college students and has more (affordable) older houses, Chandler is a nice suburban city, Gilbert has some really nice parts but its also a lot of farms and is far away from everything. Personally, I think Mesa is a bit run-down and there are better places to live, but I haven't spent that much time there. I'm moving out of Arizona in a month but I've really loved growing up here."
arizona,3baiwb,austinmiles,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:09:01 2015 UTC,I've never encountered a wild snake or toad. Scorpions scare the crap out of me..and dear lord the spiders! We have no venomous spiders here...or any kind of lizards for that matter!
arizona,3baiwb,lazymyke,3,Sat Jun 27 12:22:04 2015 UTC,"Depending on what area you want to live in, check out paradise valley and northern Phoenix along the 51. That's close to mayo but not north Scottsdale prices.   You will encounter wildlife. We had chickens and would get coyotes, foxes and Hawks attacking then very occasionally. We live in east Mesa which isn't actually run down but also not really near where you want to be. I go hiking and have seen a rattlesnake a few times. I never run across tarantulas but even if you did they are great for the ecosystem and are harmless and don't come in homes.   Scorpions are very dependent on specific location. I have never seen one at my house. Some people see them all the time. There is no way to know if you live in a place that gets them until you move in, but there are ways to manage them. They arent like roaches where they infest places.   45min is a long commute here unless you choose to live on the outskirts. Even with traffic the freeways are pretty quick."
arizona,3baiwb,wee0x1b,2,Sat Jun 27 13:12:27 2015 UTC,Perfect thank you! 45 is a normal commute here within the city so we moved closer to work last year here. Makes a world of difference after a 12hr night shift!
arizona,3baiwb,Uncle_Erik,2,Sat Jun 27 13:55:10 2015 UTC,"The person above said that the residential prices in Paradise Valley and northern Phoenix are cheaper than north Scottsdale, but I wanted to clarify. Most areas in the valley have their higher and lower quality real-estate. Typically on the outskirts of town there are larger lots/houses for cheaper. A lot of these are newer properties (especially up north) due to Phoenix growing so rapidly. You will still be able to find great housing priced housing anywhere though if you look enough.   Paradise Valley is a bit of an exception though. It isn't near any of the freeways so commutes are longer, but Mayo isn't too far from it. Housing prices are higher there because of the quality of the town. PV is a very nice part of town and it's housing market reflects this.   As for the wildlife. Coyote's and scorpions are everywhere, but you will encounter them very infrequently. As long as your house is insulated properly this should help keep scorpions out. If you like to be outside you will see a lot more wildlife, but for the most part if you leave them alone, they will do the same to you.   If you have any more questions please feel free to ask me. (Valley resident for 26 years)"
arizona,3baiwb,Crotalus,2,Sat Jun 27 19:36:35 2015 UTC,"The lizards you like, because they eat the spiders!  I've lived here off and on since 1968.  Never been bitten by a snake, only seen a scorpion a few times, and only rarely get bit by a spider (mostly when cleaning out an old shed, getting firewood, etc.).  The toads aren't a big deal."
arizona,3baiwb,Netprincess,2,Sat Jun 27 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"First, don't worry about the local bugs and critters.  They aren't that dangerous.  Though I highly recommend adopting a cat or two to go along with your dogs.  My cats kill everything that is bigger than an ant.  I hate the big water bugs (well, roaches) that come up through the drains.  The cats immediately whack them.  Cats will kill scorpions and spiders, too.  I was buying cat food the other day and ran into an older Mexican gent who was also buying food.  We started chatting about cats and he has 18 cats on his ranch.  He said that he loves them, they cause no trouble, and that they kill all the pests.  And that the other day, he went outside and found a rattlesnake his cats had killed.  No cats injured, either.  Plus cats are cuddly and loving and will get you karma when you post pictures of them on reddit.  So get some cats, OK?  Second, you need to plan for the heat.  It gets up to ridiculous temperatures down here.  You will need to drink one to two gallons of water every day in the summer.  Then go nuts on your car's cooling system.  Flush the radiator and replace all the belts and hoses.  If your water pump is more than a few years old, replace it.  Replace the thermostat, too.  This is all preventive maintenance - you absolutely do NOT want your cooling system to crap itself in the summer.  Oh, and keep a five gallon container of water in the car at all times during the summer.  You never, ever want to get stuck anywhere without water."

Called the emergency vet line and they told me to shove the hose in his mouth and just rinse the heck out of it.  After that I took him down to the emergency vet and they were going to give him a steroid shot, but by the time we got there he was acting normal again so we just went home."

arizona,3b4ndq,Phalanges_Sex,3,Fri Jun 26 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"Well, people don't actually lick them, you won't get anything from that except a bad stomach ache. The glands behind their head, and on their legs are milked on to a glass surface, dried for 48 hours, scraped/collected, then smoked in a glass inhaler or with a bowl of pot. There are people who will go to the extent of putting the secretion in a centrifuge and separating the bufotenin further from the 5-meo-DMT.  Remember when Dr. Bowman gets transported through space-time in 2001 A Space Odyssey and the lights and space are whizzing by him? The trip is like that and feels like it lasts about 10,000 years, but in reality about 15 minutes and really calming. There's a book called DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Dr. Rick Strassman about his clinical studies on DMT in the early 90's. The chemical has the potential to treat many psychological disabilities people suffer including alcoholism, depressing and even the neuro-degenerative affects of Alzheimer's.   There's speculation that DMT is released in our brain while we sleep to give us the ability to dream and when we die we release DMT- which is why we have reports of people seeing a bright light and feeling at peace when they have a near death experience.  It's stupid to think that there is some paper with some randomly placed ink on it to prevent medical research on this and similar hallucinogens- thanks Nixon."

We'd have to deal with the eggs, tadpoles, toadlets, and eventually the adult toads, and they'd just get everywhere.

arizona,3b4ndq,Nadie_AZ,2,Thu Jun 25 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"Basically what Enzainer said. They're not easily lethal to humans, though small children should avoid them since touching your mouth/eyes/nose with the poison on your skin isn't a great idea, plus with children being small it probably takes less poison to have the same effect (I think).  Handling them yourself shouldn't be a huge deal in most cases from what I read, though many sites recommended wearing gloves (like gardening gloves or whatnot) to be safe."
arizona,3b4ndq,UncleSneakyFingers,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"Their toxin can be dermally absorbed, so while it might be less of an issue than a dog mouthing one I would still avoid handling them as much as possible."

arizona,3b4ndq,jdmercredi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:08:40 2015 UTC,That seems like as good a reason as any to drop them after a bit. Interesting thing about the poison is that it comes out of gland that are behind their eyes and on their back legs. If you and the kids didn't touch around those spots much your exposure was probably lower.  Apparently some raccoons learned to kill these frogs belly-up and eat them in a way that minimizes exposure to the poisonous gland areas. Or at least that's what I heard... On the internet...

So, in my head I had to figured out where the next track was going to set, what side I'm going to have the spotters set the chassis up (which would coincide where the cranes dropped the boxes) and how long its going to take to have each tracked dropped/loaded back up for a continuous cycle in order for the facility to opertate. There was a lot of mental planning that went into it (more than what I explained) so I was able to pick up on it and became more appreciated by the railroad themself rather than my actual company. It was a 24hr operation and the only time it shut down was Christmas Eve/Day, New Years Eve/Day. Like I said, my shift was 12 hours [midnight-noon] on a Texas 2-step type of schedule but there were times I'd have to work 2-3 weeks at a time because the turnover was fairly high for ops managers. Being the only one without a kid or wife, I did it with no questions asked. Being on salary was fantastic for me, I just wish I had known about the truth behind the job I'm currently in so I wouldn't have left Chicago so soon."

arizona,3awayy,ayahuascaatdawn,2,Wed Jun 24 02:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well, it was for a foreman postion. I went in thinking it was similar to my last one except running a 25 man crew, it was just 4 people including me. I was told I'd be working with a foreman before I go to the school to train in the same aspect and you make this much yaddi yaddi yadda, come to find out, I will be a foreman but the foreman is also a member of the 4 man crew meaning the very demanding labor [that I haven't had to do in 3 years] takes its toll on someone who hasn't had to do it in 3 years. I'm not physically capable at this time to be able to handle the 100 degree + temps while doing this. I haven't needed to worry about hydration or upper body strength to dig holes. I feel like a complete failure seeing as how I was coming out here not only to get away from the shitty midwest winters but I had a job. Not many people can say that when they move somewhere. I know my limits and right now, this isnt going to work for me. Even the supervisor admitted he might not have clarified it as much as he should of the labor part. I felt lied to but not owed anything. This is my fault for expecting it to be a smooth transition. Now I'm just wanting a $1600/month job so I can get a small place and live ok for the time being until something better comes along again."

It's debatable that his actions with Lewinsky specifically weren't extremely questionable given that she was very young and he was in a position of authority over her. If you go by the ever-evolving definition of sexual assault/abuse, then by today's standards he may have even abused her.

It's not that he didn't commit a crime, he just weaseled his way out of a conviction. His maneuvering was legitimate under the law. My point stands that he did what he did and now he's in a position to return to that exact same environment where he'll have access to young ladies that he can exert power over. He was never convicted though, so nothing to see here, I guess.

The exact problem with copycat crimes is that all it takes is one delusional asshole, in custody or not, to set off a cascade of other delusional assholes carrying out their fantasies.  That said, I don't exactly agree with sending the posse to these churches, especially if the community doesn't want their presence, but I do think that to some extent, it's a nice gesture and show of solidarity. Simply learning that there will be armed resistance could be enough to deter a gunman from playing out their fantasy as their goal is to harm as many people as possible and an armed guard can prevent that."

arizona,3aimn2,bobabc,3,Sat Jun 20 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"Also, speaking as a previous auto dealer- you are fully allowed to run dealer plates on vehicles that the dealership owns.

I did not know that the blue dealer plates were a recent thing - but I've also started driving around more in the last few years than I had been doing previously, so I never suspected that was the cause.  I also wasn't aware that dealer plates were for anything more than test drives or ""official use"".

arizona,3aimn2,southpaw1004,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"Under state law (ARS 28-4532) dealers can let full time employees drive vehicles with dealer plates for personal use. The reason they changed the color of the plate is because there was a lot of abuse with the system, so now the plate expires after a year instead of having permanent status. The common issue was an employee would take a vehicle slap a dealer plate on it and give it to a spouse or child when under the law, the employee is the only one who can drive the vehicle. You notice it more now because of the blue plate when before you would have to see the DL prefix to the plate number."

This poor girl needs some justice, $20,000 probably isn't going to get it for her. :(   My condolences to the family, I've followed the case and hope they get some good leads. I also hope some rich business owners donate some money to get that fund higher."
arizona,3aiglc,_yourhuckleberry_,2,Sat Jun 20 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"I was a member, until the owner turned it into her personal social club. She got married and it went from singles-only to singles and couples. I thought adding married couples kind of ruined the whole point of the club. A Meetup group would be less expensive and more satisfying."
arizona,3aiglc,whyyesimfromaz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:18:26 2015 UTC,"If you dont mind my asking, what kind of people are memebers usually? Im hoping not to get into a huge Scottsdale clique club amd feel left out if we decided to still join?  Also, do you know of any meetup groups? We are just trying to find other married couples to make friends with. Thank you!"
arizona,3aiglc,whyyesimfromaz,2,Sun Jun 21 13:35:35 2015 UTC,"The members of A2K vary in age, both young and old. There are a number of members who have been in the club for 5+ years, and they do have a LOT of activities in Scottsdale (where they're based), especially bar-hopping in Old Town.   As for Meetup groups, just go to meetup.com and search for your interest. I'm still in the single category, but I'm sure there are groups for married couples looking to participate in activities."

arizona,3aewpy,RegattaJoe,40,Fri Jun 19 15:52:42 2015 UTC,It takes time. Stay hydrated like others have stated. Avoid being outside between 10am and 6pm and stay in the shade. Think of it this way...this is our winter. If you were living back east and it was the middle of winter you likely wouldn't be going outside all day.
arizona,3aewpy,thedukeofaz,11,Fri Jun 19 17:03:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, no.  This is not our winter at all!  I'm in Yuma and know a guy who moved here from a cold state.  I asked him if he liked the heat or cold better.  He said, ""you don't have to shovel air conditioning.""  In the cold places, it is cold day and night.  If it's snowing, you don't hang out in the back yard in the evening.  Yesterday it was 117° in Yuma.  After the sun went down, it was pretty nice out.  A breeze and the temperature dropped below 90°.  That's pleasant when the sun isn't out.  You can stay outside the entire evening in a t-shirt and shorts.  You can barbeque, pools are nice and warm, and life is pretty good.  People in cold places do not get to enjoy an evening outside at night."
arizona,3aewpy,Uncle_Erik,10,Fri Jun 19 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"I love going outside in the winter. I love cold climates. The difference between the cold and the heat is:   In the cold you can layer up and keep warm. I camp and hike on snow every year happily.   In the heat there's nothing you can do. It's hot. Even running around naked won't cut it in 110 degree weather. There is no escape, there is only hot. I will not leave my forested sky castle in the summer except to pass through."
arizona,3aewpy,HersheyHWY,5,Fri Jun 19 18:46:41 2015 UTC,In the heat there's nothing you can do   pools
arizona,3aewpy,121381,2,Mon Jun 22 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"Concur. There's nothing I could do when I was in AZ two summers ago. I still felt hot even when I wore t shirt and shorts. Like you said, at least I can layer up when it's cold and snowing. I can still bike or have beer outside even when it's snowing (though I had to ditch my bike on campus at one point and walked home lol)  I guess the downside of winter is having your car buried halfway and black ice."
arizona,3aewpy,HolyCelestia,11,Mon Jun 22 07:34:04 2015 UTC,"I've been living in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts for 4 years now, with plenty of outdoor field work and I've come to the conclusion that you get used to it, but only up to a point. I have yet to meet anyone who will be comfortable when it's 115 out, working in the sun at 2PM. Drinking water is the biggest thing, 8-8oz glasses doesn't cut it here - up the water! Stay indoors when possible, seek shade, wear light-weight long sleeved clothing, hats, etc. don't expect 110 to ever feel pleasant, in my experience it's more like you develop the ability to not be knocked down by temps in the 90s."
arizona,3aewpy,theHerbivore,9,Fri Jun 19 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yep this right here.  I've been here 27 years.  This is just a real bad week.  Anything over 110 is miserable.  Not sure what you do for work or when you're out in the heat, but the above suggestions are the best.  Get a pool if you want to enjoy the outside on the weekends.  If you don't have one of those window shades for your car get one.  When you get in your car, don't hop in and slam the door shut, leave it open while you start the car, put your shade up, and get your seat belt on.  If it's 115 outside, it's probably close to 200 in your closed up car, let it ""air out"" a bit."

arizona,3aewpy,cam-,9,Sat Jun 20 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, you need to be drinking at least a gallon of water every day out here. When I first moved from Seattle, I was drinking about 1.5 gallons, and I came in at the end of August. It took me a full year to acclimate to the weather. I moved in 2013, and this last winter was my second full winter here and I was actually cold. I was cold when it was 70 outside. I find myself wearing long sleeves still when it's 80.   This is coming from someone that has the perfect day as 56 degrees and overcast.   If I can acclimate, anyone can.   And drink more water.  And then drink some more. The humidity is regularly at 8% and sucks you dry."
arizona,3aewpy,penguin_apocalypse,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say a gallon is excessive. Drink however much water you deem is necessary. Your body will tell you. The standard 8, 8 oz glasses per day theory has been all but erased. If you sweat all day you'll need more than the average. Get a good bpa free reusable water container. I really like camelbaks chute bottle http://shop.camelbak.com/chute-insulated-6l/d/1370C5985"
arizona,3aewpy,Bbypndabamboo,3,Fri Jun 19 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"A gallon is a bit on the low side for me.  In the morning, I start with a half liter of water, thirsty or not.  I haven't had any water through the night and I need it.  After that, I drink a quarter liter every 30-60 minutes.  If my mouth gets dry, I drink immediately.  If I feel thirsty, I drink immediately.  There isn't much downside to drinking water, so drink as much as you want.  You will want to replace salts and electrolytes, so a Gatorade or salted nuts and bananas are good to have, too.  You can also DIY your own Gatorade - Google will pull up lots of recipes.  Mostly, put salt and sugar into water, add some potassium pills (crushed) and some lemon, lime or orange juice to taste.  You'll cut a lot of calories out and you'll save huge amounts of money."
arizona,3aewpy,Uncle_Erik,8,Sat Jun 20 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"Going to take a few months to a year. My wife took a few summers to get used to it after coming from Michigan.

arizona,3aewpy,Galapagon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need to drink more water.  My ""one weird trick!"" is to start drinking water before I feel thirsty.  If you wait until you feel thirsty, it's already too late.  You will be OK, but the heat will knock you down a notch.  Make drinking water a routine.  Start when you wake up and get into a routine of drinking water at least every hour while the sun is up.  Then drink some more.  You will get into a routine.  Pour the water over ice and add some citrus juice to it to make it more appealing.  Have a banana and eat a handful of salted nuts with it, too."
arizona,3aewpy,allisonstfu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"Remember that when you drink water, it flushes salts out of your body as well. You may be feeling tired because you need to replenish your electrolytes."

arizona,3aewpy,suzyatadvantage,2,Fri Jun 19 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"Stay out of the sun as much as possible. Even when outdoors, find some shade to be in. Wear breathable clothing- shorts, light colored t-shirts, sandals, etc. Enjoy the slightly cooler and more bearable nights. Any breeze will feel like heaven kissing your skin.   Also remember that monsoon season is right around the corner, so just wait it out."

arizona,3aewpy,ddavis113,2,Fri Jun 19 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"If you're in direct sun, light colored long sleeves can actually help keep you a bit cooler. They keep the sun off your skin (you'll see a lot of landscapers and roofers working in white long-sleeved shirts for this reason.)  Also, a wide brimmed hat is great for blocking some sun.  You can find some with a flap in the back to cover your neck.     You'll be wiped out for a little while.  It happens to most people for a few days when the first hot days in spring start hitting.  The desert heat is pretty hard on people in part because it's so dry.  It dehydrates you, dries out your skin, can cause nosebleeds from dryness, etc.  But you do get used to it.  Once September hits it'll still be hot but you'll notice you're dealing with it a lot better.     You're going to love it the first time you get a good heavy monsoon rain.  A good storm can drop the temperature 30 degrees in a matter of minutes."

Make sure you're drinking lots of water and something to balance electrolytes if you're sweating a lot.  Load up on sunscreen, wide brimmed hats, sunglasses, and loose but full coverage clothing.  A sunburn will sap your enery pretty quickly.  Also keep in mind we're experiencing record breaking heat right now, so this is a terrible time for even the weathered Arizonan."

The heat will be with us through October so first adjust your mentality. Don't let it get to you. Once you get through your first summer you'll get to enjoy the awesome fall/winter/spring and you'll be very glad you're here.  Then next summer you'll be acclimated.

arizona,3aewpy,hks9,0,Fri Jun 19 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"When you drink water, add a pinch of iodized salt to it. Most people think I'm crazy when I say this because they think salt is dehydrating, but actually its what helps your body retain moisture and turn it into energy. I've started buying empty capsules and filling them with salt and taking one in the morning with a huge glass of water and I instantly have more energy. You could also drink things like gatorade or pedialyte to not only get hydrated but supply yourself with minerals and electrolytes for energy. I prefer just having the salt with water because sugar is extremely dehydrating and most sports drinks have a ton of sugar, but they do work pretty well for a lot of people.   I also have really vivid nightmares which I just found out can be from dehydration so I starting having a capsule of salt with a glass of water before bed and I sleep 100x better and don't have nightmares. Its crazy to me all the different body functions that can get screwed up when you're dehydrated.   Here's a pretty good article with some more information: http://www.thealternativedaily.com/7-reasons-drink-warm-salt-water-every-morning/"
arizona,3aewpy,tralfamadorian42,0,Fri Jun 19 19:10:16 2015 UTC,I don't know the exact answer. I change into shorts and sandals at the end of the day. Sit in the shade. Avoid the direct sun as much as possible. I also try to sit outside as often as I can tolerate and embrace sweating.  This seems to work well. If you are tired I find the it's the direct sun that zaps the energy.   Also get out of town as often as you can on the weekends to somewhere cool. It will help with the murderous rage.

arizona,3aewpy,depeche_al,0,Sat Jun 20 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"I dunno why nobody has mentioned this yet: hats!  It's hot in the shade, but the real killer is when the sun touches your bare skin.  That's what will actually overheat you to the point of being dangerous.    So do whatever you have to do to keep bare skin from being hit by the sun.  Loose knit long sleeve shirts, breathable materials that are just enough to keep the sun off, a parasol, a big floppy hat.  Sunscreen actually helps keep your skin from drying out, you will need less water.  If you are prepared to go full dork to endure outdoors in the daytime, there are these things... I don't know what it's called but it's an absorbent gel sewn into a bandanna that you soak and drape over your neck, and the evaporation keeps cool.  You can get a hat with a little cape type thing on the back to shade your neck too, and some have the gel sewn into that even.  The water bottle trick:  fill it halfway, and freeze it overnight, when you leave in the morning grab it and fill it the rest of the way, because normal ice cubes will just melt.  Besides that, I've learned in my brief 28 years that things that rhyme are always true; the night time is the right time.  Take a midday nap, stay up late.  Hard if you are working so i'm mostly joking about this one, but sleep is some kind of respite from the heat.  One last tip; I think fitness helps deal with the heat.  Even if it doesn't do anything to actually cool you off, at least the stronger you are the better you will be able to deal with the toll that the heat takes on you."

arizona,3acbea,giantfuckingbears,6,Fri Jun 19 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"Isn't there a law where they have to move you to another apartment or hotel until the ac is fixed. Pretty sure it's a law.   Edit yup   You better not be putting up with their bullshit. After 24 hours id be banging on their management door demanding a per diem for a hotel of similar value. I would then move out as its a breach of contract on their end. Fuck that shit.   http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/33/01324.htm  Also uofa has an article on it as a warning to students http://legal.asua.arizona.edu/LT_Maint.html   Recover damages based on the diminution in the fair rental value of the premises; or Procure reasonable substitute housing, in which case you are excused from paying rent until the problem is remedied. If the cost of the substitute housing exceeds your rent, you may recover the difference, up to 25%. above the amount of your periodic rent. If the landlord's noncompliance is deliberate, you are excused from paying rent and you may recover the full cost of the substitute housing up to the amount of your periodic rent."
arizona,3acbea,ndboost,5,Fri Jun 19 03:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yup. Whole complex is down. They have yet to offer commensurate compensation or admit there's a problem. I already have the Attorney General, Arizona Housing Board, Arizona Tenant Advocate Association, City of Scottsdale, Channel 3 and Channel 12 investigating and breathing down their necks. But still, they've done nothing.   Like I said, I'm legally butt fucking them.   Edit: that law is called the Arizona Landlord Tenant Responsibilities Act. Use it, people. It's there's specifically for these reasons."
arizona,3acbea,giantfuckingbears,6,Fri Jun 19 03:25:53 2015 UTC,Yeah they don't respond just keep a tally of days and temps. If you have the funds stay in a hotel somewhere else  and bill them after the fact.   My apartment when I rented tried pulling the same shit.

At this point they're endangering quite a few elderly residents who are struggling to survive. Negligence doesn't do it justice. They refuse to give discounts on rent also. I've organized the community and they now have close to 300 complaints with the city. Still, nothing. It's utterly insane."

arizona,3acai2,westtexasforever,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible you will get a flat tire, especially on road tires. I've seen and patched three flats on other vehicles on that road.   I approach from Fredonia, so I'm used to taking the route in from Antelope Valley. It's an extremely well graded road, but there's small patches of sidewall killers here and there. People tend to get moving 45-65 mph easily and then hit a rocky patch and have a blowout.   Once you get within a mile or so of the National Park boundary it just turns to shit. It's rocky and rough and then that gives way to needing a high clearance vehicle with some small ledges. Even something like a stock Patriot or Xterra can do this; however. You just won't make it to the overlook or the campground in a passenger car.   There is no camping at the overlook. Camping is permitted in the campground with permits required. You must obtain the permit ahead of time. No campfires. You may camp dispersed/primitive in the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. Campfires are permitted unless there are any bans or restrictions in effect.   In September the monsoon season may still be in full swing. I went mid-september last year. There was a pretty epic thunderstorm that flooded the washes and drainages crossing the road. This posed no problem for our purpose-built 4x4s, but a passenger car/inexperienced driver would have trouble.   Just rent a jeep or something. It'll cost more than the economy car, but it'll be way more fun and you'll have less cause for worry."
arizona,3acai2,HersheyHWY,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:45:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the helpful information. Do the flats occur due to the rough rock/gravel or due to high speeds? Are there areas around there that rent Jeeps out for the day? Reason I am asking is I am renting a car from SF and driving through all the way to the Grand Canyon so I don't want a Jeep the whole way due to gas.  If the weather/road is too bad any other places you could recommend to go to for the Grand Canyon that is more secluded than the touristy areas?
arizona,3acai2,HersheyHWY,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"Tires seem to go usually because people are going too fast. Alternatively old tires will also have the tendency to spring leaks. It's like 70 miles of dirt road, so people like going a little faster to cut down on the travel time. The problem is, it's really easy to do that. It's a smooth road for the most part. You don't even notice that you're going 50mph.   As far as secluded places, Toroweap is probably the best a passenger car will be able to get near in the Arizona Strip since there's only one paved road in like 8000 square miles. Places like Twin Point, the Grand Wash Cliffs, Whitmore Wash, and Kelly Point should only be done in 4X4s. I think Nankoweap is only interesting if you are backpacking it. You could do the North Rim, but you've already been.   There's a shitload of really awesome secluded places I can direct you to, they just all require 4x4 unfortunately."
arizona,3acai2,HersheyHWY,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:06:59 2015 UTC,"So in order to try my best on keeping the tires free of punctures, what would you recommend I keep my speed at? 30mph max? Also what is the best and safest route for a passenger car from St. George as I will be spending the night there prior to heading out to the Canyon."
arizona,3aaud4,drak0bsidian,6,Thu Jun 18 16:32:30 2015 UTC,"The homes outside of the park is one thing. I mean, go for it I guess. But a tramway to the bottom? That's a little too far.   The National Parks shouldn't be a commercial commodity the way they've been heading, they should be pristine natural preserves with as little infrastructure as possible. I got no problem with commercial development outside of the gates with hotels, restaurants, tour companies, etc.   I just think, once you're in, it should be an unspoiled experience. Auto touring on some paved road, day hikes for casual encounters, and a wild backcountry for the more adventurous of us. What's wrong with that? The idea of National Parks wasn't to invest with monetary return, it was to invest in preserving exceptional spaces so future generations could experience the awe and inspiration and amazement that those before them experienced."
arizona,3aaud4,HersheyHWY,2,Thu Jun 18 18:08:06 2015 UTC,The problem with the homes outside is water.  The area already is absolutely parched and they wouldn't have water rights to the river.

Over 1,000 tons of solid radioactive mill waste and 93 million gallons of acidic, radioactive tailings solution flowed into the Puerco River, and contaminants traveled 80 miles (130 km) downstream to Navajo County, Arizona and onto the Navajo Nation.  The mill was located on privately owned land approximately 17 miles north of Gallup, New Mexico, and bordered to the north and southwest by Navajo Nation Tribal Trust lands.  Local residents, who were mostly Navajos, used the Puerco River for irrigation and livestock and were not immediately aware of the toxic danger.

They go to ASU all the time and look for shit like this to happen so they can point and laugh and tell people that all insert whichever group you want to pin it on are terrible and they all act like this idiot.

We've got a dumb ass little kid who hasnt learned to not feed the trolls and a group of grown ups who have forgotten everything their religious book teaches them and decided to focus on the worst parts of the book.    You know there's a part in the book where Jesus told his followers:  “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.  Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.""  So again 2 assholes, both are equally shitty."

arizona,39yvf8,wamazing,7,Mon Jun 15 22:52:07 2015 UTC,"Chandler and S. Tempe have a lot of good jobs. Go hit temp agencies and do some temping. There is one my employer uses, and the name escapes me but I'll ask when I get to work tomorrow and post back. We hire a lot of people into full time positions, from that agency. I have a friend who moved here from back east last year, she had several temp jobs until she landed a great job permanently. (She posted her resume on career builder and a company called her so there's another tip for you).   Go hit some meetup groups, either centered around your professional area or something related. Or even something you do for fun. Just network for the sake of getting out there and meeting people. If you're at all religious, find a church and join up.   Our construction industry was hit hard and I know a few auto-CAD guys who were unemployed or driving cabs (don't do that, you're too likely to get shot here) but most of them have found work in the past year as things have picked up.   Look around you and target the employers you'd like to work for or any that even sound promising. Print up a bunch of resumes, put on a nice shirt and a tie, and go knock on doors. Drop off resumes, ask if you can fill out an application. Wish anyone who declines a nice day and move on.   Bookmark all the local county and city municipal websites and check them daily for new postings. I wouldn't be applying for just anything and everything, but have a goal for how many jobs you'll apply for every week.   Maricopa County does have some job training/placement services like this one:  http://myhsd.maricopa.gov/Divisions/Workforce-Development.aspx  Find an organization in your area that interests you and volunteer. Let the people know you're trying to keep busy while you're looking for work.   Make a list of every possible company you could envision working for. Write up a cover letter and send (personalized, to each company) that and your resume to every company you like. You may get lucky and they are thinking about hiring someone but haven't gotten around to it. You can put that you're open to contract or temp work until you find something long term. Make sure your cover letter says what YOU will do for THEM and why you are a good candidate for this kind of work. Do a little research on each company and throw in enough info about them, that they know you made an effort.   And before you apply to any fast food places, apply at Discount Tire. They are one of the best employers in Arizona, everyone LOVES working there. They pay well and have a management training program and I hear the corporate parties kick ass. And don't buy tires anywhere else now that you live here.   Good luck. Let us know how it works out for you."

I just worry about dwindling resources so much I fear doing anything not directly ""getting a job"" related.   I know just about nothing about cars, would Discount Tire still consider me? Even if it just paid the bills until I could get an associates degree in one of a number of fields I have a ""wouldn't suck"" level of interest in...  Its been hard.

Most people are fine without an exterminator and you can purchase scorpion spray for much cheaper than an exterminator is going to charge you. You should assess the problem on your own with a black light as you might be wasting a lot of money on a relatively harmless pest, unless you have small children, pets, or the elderly living with you.  Screen your yard every night for a week or so with a black light and hammer and you'll have fixed the problem on your own. The whole thing won't take you more than 5-10 minutes as they light up quite brilliantly with even a small amount of black light. Squish them with the hammer (doesn't take much), and then dispose of the corpse via toilet or something else. The corpse can attract other bugs or more scorpions as they are not shy of cannibalism.  I live near a golf course whose moisture is a paradise for scorpions every year but we are able to keep them at bay with some regular hunting. However, if you don't mind spending the cash on the exterminator, it does work."

I treat my home myself. 1. Complete barrier around the house with pesticide. 2. Sprinkle Diatomaceous earth (ground up seashells basically) in cracks of entry ways (we put it all the way around the house).

They are territorial.  There are either 0 or lots of them at a particular place.  If there's one, there are more.  The only true way to avoid these things is with a professional exterminator.

arizona,39x1x1,Crotalus,2,Mon Jun 15 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"They for sure can climb, but are clumsy and often fall off of whatever they are clinging to.

arizona,39x1x1,Chunks1992,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"It could be a bark,  but if you can't tell then it's best to treat them all as barks.  There is a far less venomous species that inhabits the same general region and they can sometimes look very similar:  Bark Scorpion: GIS  Giant Hairy Desert Scorpion: GIS  Those pictures vary, but here in the valley both tend to look like the ""flat"" variety w/ skinny-ish midsection, darker stripes on the back and pronounced spot on the top of their head.  That said, my money would be on that one being a bark as they tend to be smaller like that one is.  Someone else in here said they're not lethal.  That's not true.  If you're stung you are not very likely to die, sure.  Especially if you're a healthy adult and in a situation where you can get help or other treatment.  But you're still not going to have a good time (if the effects of the sting are more or less over after a few hours, then it wasn't a bark).    Anecdote: One morning when I was 10 years old getting ready for school... it must have been in or on my shirt when I picked it up to put it on, but ultimately I was stung five times from my left shoulder down to the elbow by a bark scorpion.  That resulted in a trip to the doctor (this was ~1990 so urgent care wasn't on every corner back then) which rapidly escalated to a trip down to the emergency room.  I had trouble breathing, my head and limbs felt like lead, slurred speech, very blurred vision and I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Pain wise after about an hour I had the 'pins and needles' feeling from head to toe, but more strongly on my left arm and side and neck/head.   That feeling didn't subside until late that evening after a lot of IV, antivenin and the rest of my treatments which to be honest I'm a little fuzzy about to this day.  All this to say without getting into semantics of whether they're ""lethal"" or not, they should be treated seriously as a danger to have around, about on par with that of a black widow.  Someone else mentioned that you should consider not bothering with getting rid of them as they're not a big deal as pests go.  I'd disagree. They might not rate as pests in terms of causing property damage, but they will play hell on your piece of mind if you are living with them in/around your home.  Also, think of your neighbors who might have kids, elderly, etc.  If one person doesn't mind having them and takes no measures to prevent it, then all his neighbors will be plagued with them, year after year, regardless of the measures they take (short of moving).  Please don't be that person.  Last piece of advice: DEFINITELY get a black light and a broom handle or something to kill them with and go out at night.  You will probably not like what you find, so be sure not to lose your cool about it when you're out there.  They are not solitary creatures and tend to hang out in groups within a small area, so odds are good that you have more than just that one in the area.   If it's feeling like an endless supply (or if you see evidence of babies) I would definitely recommend at the very least consulting with a professional exterminator."

Flagstaff has real winter, snow and all, but the entire state is desert to one extent or another, so it is far drier than anything you're used to. Phoenix/Tucson is hot as hell for about four months out of the year, everything else is pretty nice.  No matter what you choose, your COL will improve dramatically, assuming you can find similar employment. I can't imagine it's nearly as fun here as Hawaii, but I've never been to Hawaii.  Because of the diverse (but fairly dry) climates and wildly variable topography (mountains, canyons, craters, desert) there is a lot of outdoorsy stuff to do here. Nightlife is relatively lame."

This happens to a friend of mine who is native Hawaiian. He's the safest driver you ever saw, speed limit or just a hair over. He doesn't drink at all (doesn't like the taste) and it's probably a good thing because he gets pulled over FREQUENTLY. He has never had a ticket in his life and is the straightest arrow you ever saw so I'm continually amazed by this. They always have some bullshit reason, and they let him go - he's never even gotten a ticket. Honestly I think he has dark hair, dark skin and a mustache, with shades on you can't tell his ethnicity. It's disgusting really, to think this happens and if I hadn't known the guy for 20+ years I'd say he was doing something to deserve it. But no way, it's his skin color.   He hates being so far from the ocean. Closest ocean is Puerto Penasco. If you move to Tucson it's a slightly shorter drive there lol. Good luck."

arizona,39ru15,The_Cultist,3,Sun Jun 14 04:00:45 2015 UTC,"""super cool' would depend on your interests. Earlier you mentioned local chains.  Near me food wise there is a place called America's Taco Shop, which once was named best Carnew Asada in the Phoenix Metro Area.  Thye have since started franchising out, and are now a chain.  Also food wise there is a company called Fox Restaurant concepts, which have many brands including Culinary Dropout, Flower Child, True Food & Blanco Tacos that are starting to spread to other states.  Things to do depends on the timing of the visit, not a lot of outdoor events going on in summer, when temps can be over 110 many days in a row.  So things are more late fall/winter/spring.  That is when you find beer fests, the state fair, the renaissance festival, or themed weekend events like the salsa fest or Aloha Arizona Festival.   ""Touristy"" again caters to taste. We have a couple botanical gardens, there are parks like Out of Africa wildlife in addition to the zoo, the ghost town of Jerome is north of the valley, as are the red rocks of Sedona. Or Perhaps Kartchner caverns near Tucson are more your interest.    If you gave a bit more indication of your interests, I could maybe suggest some other ideas."

arizona,39ru15,hks9,6,Sun Jun 14 09:29:06 2015 UTC,"Well first off, don't fall under the impression arizona is a massive hot desert. It actually has every single climate zone except for ocean within its borders, something most states do not have.  Where you are going is actually a pretty decent area in terms of weather. You won't be hot as shit like it is here in Phoenix. Show low is more of a woodland forest and higher elevation gives it cooler temperatures.   Show low is a smaller town, but is pretty. I'd recommend you definetly do some day trips around the nearby areas. I personally love the city of prescott. So much history there, and it is such a nice pretty small town that has a homegrown feeling to it. Everyone is super friendly. Plenty of lakes nearby as well to fish and hike.   When it comes to other seasons besides summer, the valley (aka phoenix metro area) has tons of stuff to do as well as just an overall nice place to live, especially the east valley which consists of the cities of chandler, tempe, gilbert. I would avoid mesa for the most part as well as apache junction (meth head city). You'll find many people are just trying to have a good time and if you haven't been out west before it's definetly a feeling of southern comfort. If you think low of mexican food, I guarantee you arizona will change that for you, as mexican food is far more enjoyable and authentic than any places in the midwest ( I came from Ohio and all the had was taco bell, which is just fast food and very shitty. It is now my favorite food, i recommend serranos.)  Coming from the midwest, you'll likely be amazed at how... Perfect the weather is here. No snow and shoveling, except in show low there is some but not too much. Most days of the year are sunny and cool.   Being a border state, and given the border wall around Mexico actually is purposely left absent in arizona opposed to cali and texas/nm, the law enforcement here is very strict. I will tell you right now, they are some serious dicks. It obviously depends on the cops but for the most part, you can guarantee they will search your car etc, and if you refuse, they'll do it anyways."

There are only so many weekends before it gets too hot so definitely go out and enjoy them while you can and don't spend them working overtime or hung over all day. :D Enjoy your time here. Don't listen to what others say...the summers are AWFUL even if there isn't humidity, even in Show Low.

It's remote, impoverished, meth-afflicted, and generally a cultural backwater if you're used to a metropolitan area of any real size.  There's a pretty substantial LDS population that has a large impact on the culture, which can be good, bad, or irrelevant depending on your lifestyle.  Some small Arizona towns have culture and charm; those in the White Mountains like Show Low generally do not.  There aren't any chains you need to try in Show Low, but In-N-Out burger is a West Coast staple you'll find throughout the Valley, and if you've ever watched Man vs. Food, you may have seen Los Reyes De La Torta, which has a pair of Phoenix locations which serve delicious Mexico City style food (which will be different from what you're used to in most of the Midwest, which is probably imitiation Tex-Mex, and is a nice change of pace from the typical (delicious) Sonoran food you'll find in Phoenix and Tucson).  I could go on about what's in Phoenix, but I've essentially made the most important point, which is that your nearest cultural hub is going to be the Phoenix area.  Pinetop is nice, but it's mostly a getaway town and has few permanent residents.  Flagstaff and Tucson have their appeal, but neither are easy to get to from Show Low.    There's half a dozen places to grab some good food or a pint interspersed throughout, but the town is essentially just the Summit hospital, a community college campus, and a Wal-Mart.  Not a whole lot of excitement for a young couple."

There's also an old Atlas missile silo you can tour in Tucson.  Very cool.  Some of my favorite places are just outside of Tucson.  Karchner Caverns are amazing - take both tours.  That's pretty close to Tombstone.  Tombstone is a little touristy, but then again, it IS Tombstone.  Boot Hill and the Birdcage are worth seeing.  Tombstone is close to Bisbee, my favorite town in Arizona.  Pull up some pics on Google.  Old town Bisbee is unlike any other place I've been.

This is 3-4 miles, scenic, and very nice. There are usually no people on this trail, so if you want a nice walk with privacy, this is the one for you.   Third is the newest ""trail"". It is more like a path, really. It goes from a parking area directly to the ""waterfall"". It is about a quarter mile, and is heavily traveled.

arizona,39colx,giantfuckingbears,3,Thu Jun 11 15:12:09 2015 UTC,"The whole set up for our water was that as our population grew, we'd retire the farm lands and convert them to urban lands. This is how we would weather the 21st century and the population boom.  The farmers and developers pulled off a little coup and were able to ensure we could grow exponentially without retiring any farm land. If water shortages weren't the very definition of this State, then it makes good economic sense. But the reality is that if the CAP dips below 1050 (and it is at exactly 1075 right now), lots of farmers are gonna be needing a new water source. Where will the go? Back to sucking the underground aquifer dry.   But greed will prevail and our grandchildren will live in a state that will be a shell of what we are now.   There are no more water sources available for the state. None. No more rivers to dam. No more water sources to extract. We have everything we could get our hands on. The tiny possibility of Desal from the Sea of Cortez is just that. And who would pay for it? Mr 'Business First'? Hardly. He'd want the Federal Government to. And then complain when they stepped in.   Without water, there is no hope for education. But without education, we can't begin to address our aging water infrastructure or how to make it better. Right now we NEED to put funding in our water departments, end the 40+ year water rights lawsuits that sit in the courts and repair and update what we have as well as modernize and make it more efficient. This is well worth the tax money required. We need to fund education so that young adults can learn about this and get in there and do. Our old Water Buffaloes are retiring and leaving a massive brain drain thanks to our stupid State budgets over the last 5 years."

arizona,396y60,uninan,2,Wed Jun 10 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"I moved from Tucson to Phoenix. All I hear are ""HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE HEAT UP THERE?!?""  I calmly explain that the difference between 105 and 110 during the day isn't much. It's that heat island effect that really gets you.  Tucson 105 in the day 85 at night. Phoenix is 110 during the day. 95 at night. A 5 degree difference in the day is 10 degrees at night.  On top of that you have Spring and Fall. Phoenix is 10 degrees hotter IMO in the middle of August/September, last October, I swear the difference was 15 degrees.  Now I drive down to Tucson twice a month still, so I get a taste of the difference and speak from experience.  People always focus on the time when the temperatures are the closest, during the day at the end of June. Really they should think about every other time besides that, because that's truly what makes Phoenix much hotter."
arizona,396y60,Xombieshovel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"I've lived in all three. Yuma takes the cake. Phoenix is close but it at least rains in July and August but in Yuma not so much. Monsoon season doesn't really exist in Yuma except for the humid part of monsoon season. And Tucson well the proximity of Mt Lemmon helps in regards to the wind.  The nice thing about each city is that a 90 min drive gets you either to Flagstaff, Winterhaven or Pine Valley where temps are nearly 20 degrees cooler."

The teen was knocked into the pool, accidentally knocking 7-year-old Clara Bergen into the pool with her, causing both of them serious head injuries.  Adults inside the home heard the swing structure break and found Eherlico seriously injured and Bergen at the bottom of the pool.  “They are doing CPR,"" said a witness who called 911.  ""They were in the pool. We are all there. This great big swing collapsed and hit two children. I don't know if they are dead or alive. I have no idea,"" said the witness.  ""We have major injuries to two children. They are both breathing. But we have massive trauma to both children,” said Jeff Ehrlico, an off-duty firefighter and father of 14-year-old Kayla.  ""The 14 year old has a neck injury and a left shoulder injury,"" said Ehrlico. He comforts his daughter before turning his attention to Bergen, who later died at the hospital.

arizona,38ty1r,VVhiteNoise,10,Sat Jun 6 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It really all depends on where you're trying to use it. The best piece of advice I can offer that will guarantee you 100% admittance is to use your passport if you have one. If you don't have/can't get it shipped to you it's really a roll of the dice every time you go somewhere.  Luckily for you, it's the summer, so some places are hurting for business more so than in other months (our ""winter""). Mill avenue next to ASU in Tempe is notorious for being very strict on this rule, however I had a friend visit from Texas a week ago with a vertical ID and after he explained his situation to the bouncers, he was let in to the bars we went to, denied from others. Old town Scottsdale is known to be more lax with their ID rules, so you might get lucky there. Smaller mom and pop bars are also more likely to let it slide, since business actually matters to them. Basically, every bar owner knows this law is dumb but are required to turn you away, it really all depends on when and where.   Again, my advice is to get a passport/have it shipped (it would be worth it to pay for one if you're going to be here all summer and are looking to go out frequently IMO). I don't know what the law is in Florida but if you can order a horizontal ID online and have it mailed to you, that will probably be cheaper than a passport. Best of luck, if you're in the Phoenix area I can give you a recommendation on bars and clubs to go to if you want."

arizona,38ty1r,theMumaw,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:41:20 2015 UTC,I have to be missing something here.   Is the vertical ID just a damn piece of plastic with a name and birthdate on it or is it like a regular state issued ID with a photo where it is identical to a drivers license except without the right to operate a vehicle?  This is the under 21 drivers license which I believe is different from the conversation here.  Is this ID illegal for verification of age?
arizona,38ty1r,Chicken-n-Waffles,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"The under 21 drivers license (also known as a vertical license) now expires 30 days after the person it was issued to turns 21.

arizona,38ty1r,theMumaw,2,Mon Jun 8 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"Flagstaff is pretty strict on that rule, too. These days a lot of bouncers assume vertical IDs are fake IDs since the state requires you to get a horizontal ID so soon after turning 21. If you're here all summer I'd get your passport mailed to you, getting an AZ license seems silly (especially if you don't really have an address).   Edit: Can you get a new Florida license by mail? In AZ you can fill out out the paperwork and send them a check and they'll mail you a new license with your old photo on it."

arizona,38ty1r,stutzmanXIII,-1,Sat Jun 27 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"AZ law says that you must get a 'normal' license within 6 months of turning 21, the vertical license is not a valid form of id once you are 21 and 6 months. I've known those that still have the kind you have that are older than you and have had no problems, others have been rejected at bars. The bars that reject you are those that either have police there, are new, or have had problems"

Also, anecdotally, I know a few people that work at GoDaddy and can categorically say that they don't reject overweight or Christian people as a matter of course.  If there is any truth to this at all (and it does scream ""scam"" to me), then maybe a head-hunting firm did something with this?

arizona,38rglr,philly035,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"There was another article that explains the story more.  http://www.kpho.com/story/29250236/software-engineer-accuses-godaddy-of-discrimination   After weeks of not hearing anything from the company, Connolly says he received a rejection email, thanking him for his time.  He filed the email away and said he didn't read it too closely once he saw that he didn't get the job.  But months later, he says he took a closer look at the email and noticed a forwarded message attached to the bottom of it.   The story rings true because why would anyone decide to fabricate something like this, a year after it supposedly happened? What would the motive actually be? If he's a decent programmer, he probably got a decent job elsewhere, so he would hardly have anything to gain by going public with this, especially after the statute of limitations ran out. I think he simply wants the general public and the developer community to be aware of GoDaddy's bad behavior in his case."

Ducey's proposal requires no tax increase but instead hinges on public support for increasing funding from the state-land trust's permanent fund from 2.5 percent to 10 percent each year for the next five years. It would then drop to 5 percent and expire at the end of 2026.   Is it just me, or is this plan seeking to fix the massive problem of Arizona's public education system, something I would dare to call a crisis (we ARE the lowest ranking state, and have been, for God's sake), in a very limited timespan? Ten years? I mean, maybe, but this plan is already questionable and doesn't seem to be a viable fix at all, much less a permanent one, especially if it expires after a single decade?

I live in a mixed community that has Arabs, Blacks, Hispanics, Gays, Hippies, and Yuppies.  Everyone is very welcoming.  I do live in Tempe which is a more relaxed city in Phoenix Metro.  Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, and central downtown Phoenix are all places I frequent and whoever you are you will rarely feel unwanted.  Legislate:  Our large older population votes in really bad city council that make terrible decisions that sometimes pick up traction and embarrass the state. This could be the result of PAC testing but I've been too a few fundraisers for republicans and dems (I'm libertarian independent, leaning right in my votes).  Both are old people who spend a lot of money to get dumb favors.  Republicans fundraisers are worse.  I nearly got into a row with a 65 year old woman about the light rail.  That's pretty rare for me.  Anyway, sorry for the wall.  I truly feel bad for the few friends that I know that encounter an old racist while doctoring or what not; but I do not think they are of the opinion that it is any worse here than in Atlanta or Philly."

arizona,388tcg,crescal,32,Tue Jun 2 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"Not in the least.  As with everything, its the vocal minority.  However, things such as illegal immigration are a little harder statewide. Typically, the closer someone lives to the border, the more they are for a secured border. My best friend growing up lived near a known path illegal immigrants would take, and they have quite a few stories of people showing up at their door and threatening them with knives or once a handgun.  This is NOT the majority of immigration, however its cases such as these that cause such a strong view on immigration from border states. There is also a lot of drug trade coming across this way, which causes more local violence."
arizona,388tcg,kageurufu,7,Tue Jun 2 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"Its not so much a racial issue as an illegal immigrant issue.  I think there is alot more anti illigal immigrant sentiment then outright racism, but it is viewed as racism because most of the illegal immigrants are mexican/central american."
arizona,388tcg,lepfrog,11,Tue Jun 2 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"I live in Yuma.  It's not terribly xenophobic around here.  It's actually a little melting pot.  For one, Mexico is just minutes away.  Lots of Mexicans come to Yuma to shop.  The USBP lets thousands of people through to shop and do business here.  So you see Mexican plates on cars all the time and lots and lots of Mexican nationals.  That's in addition to all the hispanics that are US citizens.  Further, people go down to the Mexican border towns constantly.  Everyone goes.  Big numbers, tens of thousands cross.  I find Mexico welcoming and hospitable and I love the people and culture.  I visit once or twice a month and I always look forward to going.  Third, there are lots and lots of Canadians here, too.  Mostly for the winters, but Canadians own a huge amount of real property around here.  They fit right in with all the US citizens and Mexicans.  So whenever you go out in Yuma, you are going to see and run into people from other countries.  I don't see any tension.  A majority of people speak English and Spanish and everyone gets along.  I think the reason why Arizona gets pegged as crazy right wing is because of the voters.  Arizona has a LOT of retired folk and a lot of them are Republicans.  Further, they vote in big numbers.  That's how we end up with batshit crazy politicians like Sheriff Joe and the nuthouse that is the Arizona Legislature.  But those old voters are dying off.  Literally.  Once that block of old folks goes six feet under, Arizona will flip to a blue state.  No question.  Most people under 65 tend to be liberal and we spend so much time with hispanic culture that it has blended into our lives.  For me, it's totally normal to go into a shop where Spanish is spoken.  I understand the culture well and feel totally comfortable with it.  It's the same for a lot of people."

arizona,388tcg,artistec,34,Wed Jun 3 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of people with Republican/Libertarian views who hold that state and federal resources should not be distributed to illegal immigrants. That might sound odd to people outside our state but much like Southern Texas the influx of drugs and people over our border has been massive enough to have a real impact on our society.  I can see how someone in Rhode Island might look at us and go ""geeze there's only 4 Mexicans in my town; just let them have it"". It's kind of a different thing when you've got millions on top of millions of illegal immigrants in your city. Tax day for example, I used to run a general construction company & when tax day rolled around the citizens were all bummed out and the Mexican dudes on my crews thought it was pretty funny (because nary a one paid a dime of income taxes)... little stuff like that or you get into an accident that's not your fault and you get to pay out of pocket b/c the cops in AZ don't make the illegals insure their vehicles (hit and runs are just way too common because of this)... it just kinda builds bad blood over time.  That's a commonish situation with your older AZ natives who work farm and ranch type jobs, construction, etc.  On the upside that group I just described is a really small slice of the people who live in AZ. It's not like Texas where (outside of Austin) people are pretty polarized with their views. A lot and I mean a lot of people leave AZ at some point in their life and a lot of people come to AZ from other places so it's a total melting pot of just like mid-westerners, Californians, handful of east coast people, etc. On top of that you've got a lot of Mexican-Americans who were born in the US or came here very young growing up next to everybody else. That dynamic means the younger crowd in AZ generally speaks a little Spanish (even if they don't realize it), Mexican food is their comfort food, and they have a handful of Mexican friends.   And yes I know xenophobic means people who have resentment towards any outsiders not just Mexicans, but I mean come on you want to know if we're a bag full of crazies.  The media likes AZ to kinda be the bad guy because we're pro-state's rights and we like guns and we like pot and they don't know how to handle it. To a dyed in the wool liberal we're pretty much the anti-christ of the states. That personal freedom stuff freaks them out so they paint us with a pretty dark brush.   Take the draw Mohamed protest recently. First off I think that's a dick move. Secondly I think it's something you ought to be free to do. Thirdly I understand the concern that drawing Mohamed could result in your death which led to the armed protesters... to an outsider I can see this looking like some sort of klan meeting getting totally out of control which is how the national media chose to portray it.   But they kinda missed a key detail. Yeah there were armed protesters (who were predominantly white) but there were also just about as many members of a local church who put on blue shirts and made a human chain to separate the protesters from the Muslims so nothing would escalate to violence (who were also predominantly white). You just never see this stuff on TV because it doesn't fall in line with the image of AZ that the liberals want you to have.   The larger GOP has for a long time preached that pot is bad and guns are good. The Dem's have preached that pot is good and guns are bad. In AZ we're like ""let's just have both"" and ""hey if we're going to have a border let's have a border""... that's the shit that freaks people out because they want it to fit that larger set of ideas about how a state should be red or blue and what that should look like.  I've worked all over the US and just recently moved to the bible belt (good job offer... like extra 20K had to do it kinda thing). People in AZ are not cool with saying the N-word, spic, flying the confederate flag, etc. If you were in even slightly mixed company and you said something about ""the mexicans"" people would flip the fuck out. So no we're not as crazy as they want you to think."

Nope.  The Arizona DMV keeps an eye on your insurance and insurance companies have to report to the DMV when coverage lapses.  When that happens, the DMV will suspend your registration.  The police have nothing to do with it.  The DMV makes the call on this.  Also, I am a lawyer and I've read through the statutes.  This is how it is."

arizona,388tcg,awpti,13,Wed Jun 3 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"So your answer is yes (and you seem rather obsessed with race.)  I know no devils, I just find it funny to hear someone complaining about a problem when they personally have profited the same problem.    Illegal immigration is a tax that business levy upon the public. Illegal labor contributes an estimated 2 billion dollars to Arizona's GDP on an annual basis. Companies benefit & the social costs of this labor is subsidized by the taxpayers at large.    I don't care what anyone feels about the situation, or how much charity they provide to Mexico or Mexicans. The employers are the biggest criminals here, and until we fix this, we will keep being screwed."
arizona,388tcg,mr_staberind,2,Tue Jun 2 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"I must have misunderstood their point. What I heard was yes, but they attempted to lay out how the situation was unavoidable and that they hope that a reasonable person might agree that the people that there are two kinds of employers of illegals; those that will make an effort to create a life for their employees which will hopefully prevent them from being a burden on the system (even 'legal' employees, treated poorly, will be a burden on the system) and those which don't do this. They seem to hope that you'd understand they attempted to do the former, they having fully realized themselves that if they had not, there would be many people who would do the latter.  I'm not going to break my arm jerking this person off, but, if they really truly did try to help someone make a better life, good for them. At the end of the day, you or I could speculate the ultimate outcome, but I don't think I'm going to dwell on it too much after this point."
arizona,388tcg,IJUSTWANTTOUPBOAT,4,Tue Jun 2 22:17:18 2015 UTC,"An absurdly complex problem. I suspect the answer depends upon how much freedom people are willing to give up.  If you live within 100 miles of the border, you have already given up quite a bit.  But before I explain, I have to say kuddos for your point on the permeable border as a cause for Mexico's decay.  I had not really thought that one through, but it's an obvious truth.  That said, the only easy, realistic way to solve this problem is a police state with national ID card system indexed upon biometric data. There is no way to sort out 11 million illegals without making life hell for everyone, but particularly making life hell for the 39 million Hispanics who belong here now. Everyone within our borders has constitutional rights, and given the current state of the legal system, we will need at least a decade of checkpoints, lawsuits, random inspections, and jackbooted thugs chanting ""May Ve Zee Your Papers?""   When your citizenship depends upon a document, the government effectively owns you. I'd rather not live like that.  So unless anyone has a better idea that is humane and acknowledges the fact that the barn door's been wide open for 40 years, give the folks who are here a means to obtain citizenship and move the border patrol to the border. Make the border patrol focus upon enforcing migration law and customs enforcement at the actual frick'in border."

You know, there are real issues that come with vast amounts of illegal immigration (you know the Arizona-Mexico border was the most trafficked border in the world for several years). Talking about the problems and fallout associated with that does not make you racist. Sadly, that turned into a partisan issue, and a certain party decided to label anyone racist who had the audacity of discussing issues associated with illegal immigration."

We just have a county Sheriff that likes to bust illegals and a few Republican knuckleheads who pander too much.  Still, it's better than being a sanctuary state like California where a quarter of Mexico's population lives.  P.S.  I've lived in Arkansas for a while so I can tell you Arizona is not a ""red state"" by any stretch."

Not all countries, but mostly Mexico. There is a pretty bad cartel problem here and lots of illegal immigration.

Whatever the news stations can come up with to try and peak interest, they will. I have personally, first hand seen Sherriff Joe, lie on the news. Now, whether or not he believed what was fed to him or he really is an attention whore, what he said on live TV was not true. I can only assume that the words that came out of his mouth were for attention and publicity. That being said, whatever stories are a ""hot topic"" will get the ratings, and rating equal money. Arizona is just  the current ""black sheep"". In my eyes, media is just acting.  I have lived here my entire life and honestly feel that we are genuinely just go with the flow people.

They will always present you with the citation and any/all reasons for it during the stop and ask that you sign it (while not admitting your guilt). I think in AZ a traffic citation does NOT ""require"" a signature but not doing so might cause further investigation and probably further issues."

arizona,3879fh,PhaliceInWonderland,18,Tue Jun 2 16:43:10 2015 UTC,"So a couple of things happened here.    The officer didn't provide you a reason immediately upon asking - a clear sign that it was a pretextual stop. While still technically constitutional, they're under handed practices of detaining a driver to look for other more serious crimes(drinking, drugs, etc). They can not give you a ticket post stop. They are required to present you the ticket, signed, at the initial stop(unless it's photo radar). So if you were to receive a ticket in the mail later, you absolutely need to take it to court.  (Opinion) I'm not sure I'd consider this to be a nice cop, just a lazy one. Being out late and driving near a bar aren't reasons to be stopped. It's harassment and creates unnecessary fear in a community when policing aggressively stops motorists on unfounded suspicions. If it happens again, I recommend getting the officer's badge number or squad car number and make a complaint."

arizona,3879fh,PhxShylock,2,Tue Jun 2 17:03:16 2015 UTC,"He probably thought you were coming home from the bar, and wanted to find some reason to stop you. Nearly the same exact thing happened to me, 15 years ago. I was 17 and our Model UN club had just gotten back from Tucson and I was dropping my friend off at his house. The cop saw two high school kids in suits, asked if we were drinking, I told him where we had been, he said some crap about swerving and to stop messing with the radio, then left.  TL;DR - Cop looking for drunks, found two high school dorks instead."
arizona,3879fh,thedukeofaz,6,Tue Jun 2 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"You don't have to worry.  Most likely he was indeed a bit far back to make accurate judgement, but honestly thought he saw something, and acted in good faith.  Being out that late means he was on drunk patrol, so he figured you might be.  He could smell and see that you weren't, you were apparently polite and cooperative, and so he didn't need to do anything else.  Good on both you and him for letting the contact be positive!"

You have the right to face your accuser. A piece of mail doesn't cut it.  I've tossed about a half dozen photo radar mails. They can send a process server if they really want to give me a ticket, short of that, they can fuck off.  I'm not mailing in something that basically admits guilt and surrenders my rights...   Did I just get a nice cop, only on the lookout for drunk drivers, that took an assessment of an totally empty road at midnight and decided to let me go, or am I likely to be in for a nasty surprise?   You got a bored cop, who was on a fishing trip.  He figured you might have something he can cite and so he ginned up a pretext to pull you over. legal, but somewhat slimy.   If they issue you a ticket, do they give you the papers there and then, or do you usually receive them in the mail?   You get it then and there."

I was surrounded by dozens of Muslims and not a single one of them tried to blow me up. I was much more intimidated and afraid of the anti-Islam protestors than I was by any of the Muslims. I was thanked several times by Muslims who were concerned that they would be standing alone.  I wasn't too pleased with the anarchists there. They gave a negative vibe to the otherwise positive feeling on our side. The bikers were consistently antagonizing and trying to start fights, but the cops were keeping everyone apart. Nobody on the bikers side was trying to keep anything calm, but there were several on our side that would pull people back to calm them down if things got too heated.  The bikers seemed to know just enough about the Bible to use it to bash others and just enough about the Koran to mischaracterize it. It was tragic to see them misunderstand two religions while also misunderstanding the constitution.  I don't know why I felt so strongly that I should be there. It's all the way across town from where I live, but from the moment I read about this I knew I needed to be there.

This is the same thing with people from the Westboro Baptist Church. They picket soldiers funerals and shout slurs at people, and all of a sudden Christians are viewed as terrible people hiding behind their god.  Extremism exists in every religion, it's a matter of looking past it and realizing that not everyone acts that way.

I have two teen daughters, we goto the movies/bowling/Vegas trip every now and again etc.  My job is a 24/7 type job, always on call and always stuff do to outside of normal business hours, that keeps me busy too.  There are some cool things to do in and around town depending on your hobbies, mine being auto related there is the Laughlin River Run, Kingman Sand Drags, The Strip in Vegas, Fun Run ...   Perks: Weather, we don't get as hot as Vegas or Phx, usually only 2 weeks where it's what I would call really hot.  Winters are generally mild, although this past year we did have some snow and it was cold enough to freeze the water in my truck ... Cost of living, MUCH cheaper then living in a bigger city.  I enjoy a small town, I grew up in and around Boston, left after 9/11.  There are lots of folks in their 20s here, it's not all older folks.

Not something I would move across the country for unless they are paying something amazing... there has to be something better in that distance.   The meth problem everyone is talking about is a problem but as with anywhere, it's mostly in the shitty part of town. Stay out of those areas and you stay away from it.  But of you have kids.. or plan on having kids I wouldn't choose to raise them here if that is something you're thinking of for the future. I know very few of my friends didn't go through a ""drug"" phase and a few of them kinda stayed in that phase and ended up getting involved with the meth...   It's a small town and all the old people are very typical Arizonans, and they fight every attempt to change or make this town any better. Kids get into drugs because there is nothing else to do.  I ride dirtbikes and go camping a lot. This town may lack businesses and stuff like that but one thing it has is a shitload of desert and a lot of motocross tracks.   The hualapai mountains are the edge of the city with pines and gets snow once or twice a year. Your 30 miles from Lake Mead, an hour drive from vegas. It gets to 105 in the summer (10-15 degrees cooler than the surrounding cities) and pretty cold in the winter (probably not as cold as you're used to)   And what they say about the population isn't really acurate because probably less than half of the people in this ""town"" live within the city limits. The rest don't get counted.  And above all else we have a                    SUPER WALMART  Edit:  For Spelling (what can I say? Arizona public schools...)"

arizona,37dcsu,glasskanan,9,Wed May 27 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"It'll be a huge year for Arizona. If the independent redistricting commission sticks, and Arpaio runs again, we could have a huge blue sweep.   DSCC targeted Senate race.  3 DCCC targeted House races.  Maricopa County Sheriff race.  CD7 turnout machine.  Presidential battleground state.  DNC's 100k new registered dems goal.   Mmm I'm excited   EDIT: Let me explain. The congressional districts in AZ were formed by an independent redistricting commission, meaning that they were formed by a committee of nominated arbitrators from the two parties and a neutral arbitrator. This is in contrast to the way that most states create maps of congressional districts, which is that the state legislatures create the district maps. In states with independent redistricting commissions, the congressional districts tend to be less gerrymandered. In Arizona, we have 4 solidly red districts (Franks, Gosar, Schweikert, Salmon), 2 solidly blue districts (Gallego, Grijalva), and 3 swing districts (Sinema, McSally, Kirkpatrick). Without this commission, the congressional district map would be created solely by the Republican majorities in the State Legislature and State Senate. It is possible to craft/gerrymander the congressional districts in Arizona to leave only two solidly Democratic districts and 7 solidly Republican districts, with effectively no competitive districts. That would be unrepresentative of the voting population in Arizona.   In reference to the independent redistricting commission 'sticking,' I'm referring to an upcoming Supreme Court ruling. The Supreme Court is about to rule on whether or not our independent redistricting commission (and others, implicitly) is constitutional, as the Arizona constitution language is debatable about who should be creating congressional district maps.   By ""blue sweep"" I'm referring to Democratic victories in the multiple swing races. These are: Presidential electoral votes, U.S. Senate race, Maricopa County Sheriff race, and the 3 swing congressional districts' races. That'd be considered a blue sweep because Democrats would win any seats that are realistically up for grabs. Last year was almost a ""red sweep"" because the Republicans won all of the competitive statewide races (Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Superintendent of Public Instruction, two Corporation Commission seats) Though, Sinema and Kirkpatrick won their respective congressional races, so it wasn't totally a sweep.   The independent in independent redistricting commission refers to the fact that the commission responsible for creating the congressional district map in Arizona was not made up of state legislators or other politicians, but instead created by a panel that with equally represented nominees from both main parties, and an agreed upon non-partisan nominee. Hope that clears up what I meant."

Republicans swept every single statewide race this past election and have dominated throughout most of our state's history.   Statewide elections are representative of the state as a whole. The problem with gerrymandering is that it's sometimes needed to ensure certain groups have representation.

arizona,37dcsu,inphx,0,Wed May 27 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"It does help to have DCCC targeted races in your state if you're a Democrat. It means you have very large campaigns with substantially more resources and energy dumped into them than safe seats. In Arizona, this means that these campaigns focus a huge amount of their efforts on turning out voters who are less likely to vote.   It does help and will continue to help Democrats in Arizona. Coupled with changing voting demographics and participation (which have been built by the swing district congressional campaigns in addition to many other actors over the past decade or so), it offers an opportunity for Arizona Democrats to win more.   It's not magical, its a matter of a vast increase in resources statewide for every competitive race being targeted at swinging independent or moderate voters into voting D or at increasing Democratic base voter turnout statewide. In 2016, Arizona will have competitive races in all of the above that I listed. That hasn't happened here ever."

arizona,37d5i8,kriegers-clone,1 point,Wed May 27 15:51:14 2015 UTC,i sure do.  I was told it would be about $60 a person to camp for a night.  Which i thought was very high.  Do you have any suggestions where to camp once i am in the canyon?
arizona,37d5i8,B_Witt,1 point,Wed May 27 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"That is good to hear, we have a lot of people come here and post and realize they have no reservation. The link I provided gives you a breakdown of the costs, it just depends on how many people are going. Right now it's $57 per person, but well worth it.  Sorry I don't have any personal recommendations on where to camp, but here are some maps: http://havasuwaterfalls.net/maps.html   http://havasuwaterfalls.net/img/MAP-8-Campground.jpg"
arizona,37d5i8,B_Witt,1 point,Wed May 27 18:41:42 2015 UTC,There's a large area to camp past Havasu falls and before Mooney falls (you'll see the other tents in this area). Closer to the spring (your water source) will be best so you won't have to walk as far on refills. I've gone 3 or 4 times now and will be going again in July. If you have any specific questions I'll try to help.
arizona,37d5i8,theberrydotcom,1 point,Wed May 27 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"Specifically,  bring a headlamp for at night,  moleskin if you're not an experienced backpacker, ibuprofen if you're not an experienced backpacker, someone needs to have a stove for food, pack only what you need because you don't want to carry unnecessary items, flavor packets are good to add to water, have water shoes and separate hiking shoes, hand sanitizer,  trash bags, a watch to tell the time, your wallet to pay!!, an extra pair of socks for the hike out, a camera, it'll probably be hot so you'll want a pad more so than a warm sleeping bag, etc... that's off the top of my head."

arizona,37bzrx,dijoman,1 point,Tue May 26 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"Antelope Canyon is on the Navajo Nation and is not free.  Be prepared to pay $40ish per person.   You aren't that far from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, a little ways south.  Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National park are a little ways north.  I just got back from Zion and it was awesome.  Near Page itself, Lone Rock Beach on Lake Powell has all the camping that you want and is pretty cheap.  It is fairly primitive.  There are outhouses, but no other facilities.  You can camp anywhere on the beach which is about a mile long and a couple hundred meters wide. No assigned campsites."
arizona,37bzrx,ThomasRaith,1 point,Tue May 26 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was looking at prices for Antelope Canyon guided tours and they had all said around $28 dollars for a guided tour. I booked a camp site at Wahweap Marina. I had seen Lone Rock Beach but it looked a little too primitive for the group I'm going with. We plan on hitting up either the Narrows or Angels landing in Zion National Park, both look amazing not sure which one to pick"
arizona,37bzrx,ThomasRaith,1 point,Tue May 26 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"Pricing is a little deceptive with Antelope Canyon.  There are two sections of the canyon (upper and lower).  Both charge for a guided tour and there is no option other than a guided tour.  They also charge for parking.  Angels Landing and The Narrows are a study in contrast.  The former goes up a really narrow spine of rock high above the canyon.  The latter goes way down deep.   Both can be scary depending on your phobias.  As to choosing, why not do both?  Angel's Landing is only about 5 miles round trip.  It took me about 2 hours to get to the top and back.  The Narrows you can just hike up until you are ready to turn around and then do so.    In the Narrows you are literally in the river and it's quite cold right now so be cautious.  You can rent dry suits in Springdale if you need to."
arizona,37bzrx,artistec,1 point,Tue May 26 17:51:24 2015 UTC,Neither Upper or Lower Antelope canyon's charge for parking. Most tours of Upper leave from the tour's offices in Page where parking is free. The one tour company on site at Upper does not charge for parking. Parking is free at Lower which is right across the street from Upper.   (information accurate as of a couple of months ago when I was last there)

arizona,375nta,99_44_100percentpure,1 point,Mon May 25 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"Good on this officer, but that doesn't change anything. Cops have power. If even a single one of them abuses it, it throws every other officer into suspicion by the people. Think of it like getting cheated on: if it happens once, you'll hesitate to trust the next person you have a relationship with. Maybe you'll get over it. If it happens twice, then that distrust of others grows even stronger. The more it happens, the less you trust. So it is with he cops. The problem is that there are too many bad cops. Even one is too many, but we all know there are many many more than one. Of course there are good cops. To believe otherwise is ridiculous. But the good deeds of a million cops or more will never compensate for the reprehensible acts of one."
arizona,375nta,Canalan,2,Mon May 25 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, take that last part and swap in a few other minority groups and you got yourself a bigoted screed.  You do realize the police is made up of humans, right?  And in a system ran by humans and staffed by humans and dealing with humans there will be some bad humans?  And that'll never not be true?  I understand that the police are ""held to a higher standard"", but you pretty much just said that there's no way they can ever live up to yours.  I feel that's a harmful attitude to have towards any group."
arizona,375nta,99_44_100percentpure,1 point,Mon May 25 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"No, they could live up to my standards. They just have to never abuse their power. And if an officer does, they should be terminated immediately, without restitution, pay, pension, etc., and tried and sentenced. This rarely happens. But first and foremost, they should not abuse their power. The latter case I mentioned above is not even consolation to the victims of their abuse, and should be executed matter of factly and without being demanded. This rarely happens."
arizona,375nta,Canalan,2,Mon May 25 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"So, due process shouldn't be afforded to accused officers?  ""Terminated immediately"", guilty until (never) proven innocent, I guess?  Ruin someone's life because he might have done something wrong, maybe?  It sounds like you want speed at the expense of actual justice.    You say officers never get fired, but they do, you just never hear about it since there's something else <your_favorite_news_sources> care about.  Trials and investigations take months, for almost everyone.  And if you've decided some officers are guilty, when they're found not guilty, you won't accept the verdict anyways, I'll wager.  And did you know that policing in the US is actually the least corrupted job, out of all jobs?  It's more likely that a firefighter will steal your things while putting out your house fire than a cop will violate your rights, for example.  Does that mean all firefighters are bad, or that some scumbags slip past the rigorous selection process?  I am not saying there are not bad cops, or agencies, because we know there are.  I'm saying they are not representatives of the profession as a whole, just like any criminal is not a representative of his/her race/ethnicity/gender/orientation/age/social class."
arizona,375nta,99_44_100percentpure,1 point,Mon May 25 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not going to get into this age old argument which just goes round and around over and over again. I commented to point out that it doesn't matter that one cop did something good and that his actions change nothing in regard to the crimes bad cops have committed. The title ""not all cops are bad"" is just as terrible as the #noteveryguy movement that popped up. Of course not all cops are bad. Doesn't matter. When one cop abuses their power, all of them become less trustworthy. Sorry, officers. Want this opinion to fade away? Stop abusing your power. Simple as that."
arizona,375nta,Canalan,2,Mon May 25 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"With that context, I don't feel you're a reasonable person, or at least, your expectations are unreasonable.  Humans cannot be perfect, and they cannot enforce perfection across all agency/city/county/state lines."
arizona,375nta,99_44_100percentpure,0,Mon May 25 18:00:55 2015 UTC,I don't think it's unreasonable to ask that every officer of the law not abuse their power.
arizona,375nta,Canalan,1 point,Mon May 25 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"I could say it isn't unreasonable to ask that no criminals do crime, in that case.  Idealism is nice, but you have to work towards it, not just demand it."
arizona,375nta,99_44_100percentpure,0,Mon May 25 18:12:45 2015 UTC,That's a poor analogy. We entrust the police with power. We don't entrust criminals with anything by choice. Asking a criminal to not commit crime is incomparable to asking a police officer to not abuse the power with which he is entrusted. The truth is that that is not an ideal. It is a baseline for admission to the force. The problem is that people think it is an idealistic opinion when really it's the bare minimum we ask of the police.
arizona,375nta,Canalan,1 point,Mon May 25 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"I think the comparison is fair, as it, in expanded form, applies to everyone not being shit, not just one particular group.  In any case, while your expectation has understandable roots, it ignores basic human nature.  Until we replace the police with robots, we will always have at least some issues based on human flaws.  Until then, you will always be disappointed."

Well, by the time three escapees -- the three ""crazy boatmen,"" as they were dubbed later -- got to the Gila River , they realized that it was not a flowing river. but because the rivers in Arizona was mostly dry and had not been navigable for decades, most of them were recaptured without bloodshed over the next few weeks."

The Arizona bridge is a reinforced concrete structure clad in the original masonry of the 1830s bridge, which was bought by Robert P. McCulloch from the City of London. McCulloch had exterior granite blocks from the original bridge numbered and transported to America to construct the present bridge in Lake Havasu City, a planned community he established in 1964 on the shore of Lake Havasu. The bridge was completed in 1971 (along with a canal), and links an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City.    Image i     Interesting: Bridge Across Time | Robert P.

arizona,36vrfx,autowikibot,2,Fri May 22 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"Pleasant Valley War:       The Pleasant Valley War, sometimes called the Tonto Basin Feud, or Tonto Basin War, was a range war fought in Pleasant Valley, Arizona in the years 1882-1892. The war was fought between two feuding families, the ranchers Grahams and Tewksburys. The former, who were part Indian, started their operations as cattle ranchers before branching out to sheep, and racial slurs were bandied about from the early years of conflict.   Pleasant Valley is physically located in Gila County, Arizona, but many of the events related to this feud took place in neighboring Apache and Navajo counties. Other neighborhood Arizona parts, such as Holbrook and Globe, were the setting of its bloodiest battles. The feud was originally fought between the Tewksburys and the Grahams against the well-established cattleman James Stinson, it soon involved other cattlemen associations, sheepmen, hired guns, cowboys and Arizona lawmen. The feud lasted for about a decade, with its most deadly incidents between 1886 and 1887; the last-known killing took place in 1892.   The Pleasant Valley War had the highest number of fatalities of such civilian conflicts in United States history, with an estimated total of 35 to 50 deaths, and the near annihilation of the males of the two feuding families. The Pleasant Valley War was one of the deadliest and well-known range wars. It was also a reason why Arizona's statehood was postponed for another decade. Years after its end, many books and articles were written about the feud, and a number of gunman made a name of themselves for their participation.

The representatives from Tucson came back to a very angry crowd who were not content with what Tucson did win - the university.  It ""only"" came with $25,000.  Tempe ended up getting a school called Tempe Normal for teacher training with a $5,000 appropriation.  At the time, Tucson was actually a bigger city than Phoenix.    The insane asylum is known as Arizona State Hospital, still in operation.  The University of Arizona is the result of Tucson's $25,000 second-place prize.

If that's your definition of progressive, then I guess it could make sense.   This move is to make poor people move out of the state, plain and simple. Less poor people means less tax money is required to care for them. Ducey is trying to balance the state budget by cutting social services and education. Typical TEA party bullshit."

And for perspective:   Most states impose a five-year limit on welfare benefits. Thirteen states limit it to two years or less, and Texas has a tiered time limit that can be as little as 12 months but allows children to continue to receive funding even after the parents have been cut, welfare policy analyst Liz Schott said."
arizona,36fsxd,rit100,10,Tue May 19 01:28:44 2015 UTC,The idea is to get them to self deport to another state.  This is how block grants to states can end up being abused by ideologists.  They want to take the money saved to fund the child safety department because the politicians have been taking a lot of heat for how that mess has been run and justifiably so.  The ethical thing to do is fund the child safety department with fair and progressive taxes and maybe back off on the tax welfare being extended to every other business with it's hand out down at the ledge.

It helped and I was able to move beyond it. Now I am thinking its time to self deport and put my taxes somewhere where my kids can grow up encouraged to learn in a place that actually practices the christian values they so dearly claim to have by helping those in need.

Personal example - My GF reacts very badly (sever bleeding, acne, cramping, ect)  to multiple version of the pill and wants an IUD.  Her gynecologist would not allow her to get one without first talking to me and literally getting my sign-off.  Let me repeat that.

Find another."
arizona,36fsxd,butterbal1,2,Wed May 20 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"Her doctors office has my signature on file stating that I want her to be on long term birth control and understand it could be up to 2+ years after removal before she is able to naturally convenience a child. (6 months is that standard)  Perfectly legal as the gyno does not have to provide her with birth control if there is a religious objection, but slimy as hell IMHO.  But other than the hoops to get the procedure done my GF is happy with the quack, and it is covered 100% by her works medical insurance."
arizona,36fsxd,uberalles3,0,Thu Jun 4 07:06:50 2015 UTC,"A very complicated issue. Balancing and weighing the gyno's rights of beliefs with the rights of a person to get needed medical treatment. I think the compromise is OK, you sign and it goes through. A little hurdle, but it satisfies the gyno and not much of a burden on you to sign.   Just curious, abortion is also complicated. At how many months pregnant should a woman be able to get an abortion easily. 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, the day before birth? Seems people don't like to answer how many months."
arizona,36fsxd,butterbal1,2,Thu Jun 4 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"In this case I wasn't upset about signing the paperwork specifically, it was that my GF wasn't allowed to make a medical choice about her body without my allowing it.  Had she been single and wanted it to allow for sex with random hookups that doctor would not have allowed it. HURRAAAAY SINGLE PARENT ONE NIGHT STAND BABIES!!!!!   As for abortion dates I would have to read up on the specific time but my choice for a cutoff is as soon as the fetus is viable to survive if born then (somewhere 3rd trimester)."
arizona,36fsxd,uberalles3,-1,Thu Jun 4 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it almost promotes hookups this way. As I said it is a compromise otherwise you'd need to find another less religious doctor.   Anyways, on abortion, I agree with you on when the fetus becomes viable it's too late. Somewhere about 6 months. But there are some that say it is a woman's body and if a woman wants to get an abortion at 9 months so be it. It is her body. Again this is a compromise between common sense, religious zealots and a woman's right to her body."

arizona,36fsxd,xeriscaped,4,Tue May 19 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you, but I am up-voting you since a lot of nice people feel like you do.  My problem with Ducey doing this is that by cutting programs like welfare and using that money to decrease taxes- you are probably decreasing a large stimulus to the economy.  In this link they go into the research in how tax cuts probably do a significant worse stimulus to the economy.  As an Arizona taxpayer- I would like to have the money I give to the state to be as effective as possible, and from what most economist think- this is not happening.  So with Ducey's current plan- we are decreasing funding for education and increasing funding to prisons and decreasing funding to poor families to provide tax cuts for the rich.  These decisions will have a large negative effect on Arizona's economy for a long time to come."
arizona,36fsxd,uberalles3,-1,Tue May 19 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"To support an argument like giving away welfare helps the economy, you can extrapolate and say, why not increase the payouts to welfare and give everyone some welfare money. The taxes to pay for this ""stimulus"" would bankrupt the state.  But as you argue, you say that welfare is better than tax breaks in how it helps the economy. It may be true, but you then are getting into take from the rich and give to the poor socialism. Which is OK for some, it's just not for me.   Arizona hasn't changed that much and is one of the better states to find work. If you want an example of failed liberal policies, look to Detroit. I'll take conservatism over liberalism any day."
arizona,36fsxd,xeriscaped,1 point,Tue May 19 22:02:47 2015 UTC,You could also extrapolate and say that water is bad for you because if someone is given too much they drown.    It's important to use common sense- of course if you go overkill on just about anything it is bad.  However at the current levels I do not feel like we are there.    I agree that encouraging people to work hard is important and the state shouldn't encourage people not to work as much as possible.   My main point is that I do not want my tax dollars wasted- I want every dollar that I pay in taxes to get the most value it can.  Let's get the most 'bang for the buck' we can.  If don't mind your hard-earned tax dollars wasted then we should continue with these policies.

I love Easy Rider, but have only seen it once years ago, time for a re-watch!

Both are little old mining towns with a quirky vibe, area is also beautiful. If you want to go North there is Jerome and the Verde River valley. Again quirky old mining town and beautiful scenery that contrasts the low deserts of the Valley. Montezuma's castle is a cool stop there but think you need to pay to get in. In the same area there is Prescott. There are plenty of day hikes around town and make sure you hit the Dinner Bell on Gurley st. for lunch or breakfast. Not sure what you are looking for exactly besides cheap but I could probably think of some other ideas if you have more specific requirements.   Hope this helps."

It is up in the Payson area. They have dispersed camping throughout the road leading up to it. It is a place to dig for quartz crystals, look at nature, and, on a very clear night, see the galaxy in the stars. It is quite amazing. It is a dense forest, with lots of deadwood, so firewood and pine needles are everywhere. No need to bring some! there are no bathrooms, hardly, so just be prepared to be close with nature.  If you do go, don't forget to visit Tonto Natural Bridge. It is one of the biggest travertine bridges in the world! Great place to day-hike. it is composed of limestone from when this land was a shallow ocean. The scenery is gorgeous, and the hike is definitely a workout, but fun for all. Small fee to get in."

arizona,36fcv6,kombodockerson,4,Mon May 18 23:17:29 2015 UTC,"The 101/I-17 is pretty far from the center of the metro area.

arizona,36fcv6,nickfromnt77,3,Tue May 19 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"Embryoyo described the demographics of the area fairly well.  I live on the north east side near the 101 & 51.  I would say our two areas are both middle class blue collar areas predominately.  The nice thing about the location though, is the freeways.  With the 101, you have quick access to the Scottsdale area.  With the 17, you have downtown to the center of Phoenix.  If you go east to the 51, then south, you'll hit Tempe although it's across town from you (an easy half hour in non-rush hour traffic).  Don't forget that there's all the local-to-NW-PHX night places also and usually only locals know of those."
arizona,36fcv6,nickfromnt77,0,Tue May 19 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"So if I were to live closer to my sister on the NW side it's not too big of a pain to get to the fun? I'm from Atlanta, where going anywhere near or through downtown is nearly impossible with rush hour and the amount of wrecks people get in every day. Our outer ""loop"" similar to the 101 backs up so bad that it's a nightmare to get anywhere. Hoping that won't be the case in the Phoenix area! So yeah, if it's fairly easy to get around on the interstates and highways then my location won't be as big of an issue."
arizona,36fcv6,Dejohns2,2,Tue May 19 01:17:46 2015 UTC,"Oh no.  During rush hour, it's a mess unless you're going against traffic.  For example, During evening rush hour, it's very easy for me to get into downtown on the 51 but on the other side of the freeway, it's bumper to bumper & real slow.  Believe me, you'll learn real quick & adjust when you go where accordingly."
arizona,36fcv6,Dejohns2,3,Tue May 19 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"Phoenix - 15th St to 15th Ave (east to west) and Lincoln to Bethany Home (south to north). Or anywhere within walking distance of the Light Rail. Really depends on what you're looking for. Roosevelt Row has a great art scene, cafes, and is close to the public market. Further north from Thomas to Camelback is a little more fancy yoga studios and spendier restaurants, but is a pretty nice area. The big law firms have offices there if you're looking for an administrative job. Van Buren to Lincoln is close enough to walk to the baseball and basketball stadiums and is literally downtown.  Tempe - Broadway to Rio Salado (south to north) McClintock to Priest (east to west). Check the light rail map, but also check the orbit routes (they are free neighborhood circulators). Figure out how close you want to be to a grocery store. But within this area you'll be biking distance to the light rail, a short drive (or longer ride) to the grocery store, and within walking distance of some smaller markets (Japanese, Korean, Mexican, Indian, Tempe Farmers Market). There are some fancy condo/loft style things, there's expensive and cheap apt options, and a lot of historic neighborhoods (historic = built in the 50s/60s in AZ).   Scottsdale - Old town area. Somewhere off of the 72 route if you take public transit.  What is important to you? Biking, walking, public transit, freeway access? Walkability and easy access to amenities? Parks or dog parks nearby? ""Family"" oriented or young professional oriented? Economic hubs? Outdoor activites (and which kinds)? Would you prefer a house, four/quad plex, loft, apartment, condo? Do you want to pay more for something way nice, or live a little cheaper and maybe not fancy, hardwood floors? Do you love live music? If you throw out a little more info I can make more specific recommendations.  Edit: How much do want to pay for rent as well? Are you open to roommates or would you prefer to live alone?"
arizona,36fcv6,JohnDeere,0,Tue May 19 07:02:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome info!! Thank you so much.  Out of what you listed, here is what is important to me: Public transit would be nice, freeway access nearby definitely, places to go running nearby (wouldn't mind driving a little to get there) - I've read that there are some green belts around, would love to be near one. Hiking nearby would be nice but not required. Walkability would be a plus. Would be great to be able to walk to a bar. I'm more family oriented but don't have one of my own quite yet. I plan to start in an apartment but will likely buy a house not too far down the road. I'd probably prefer a little cheaper and not super fancy right now. I do like live music, food trucks, sports, etc. Would like to join team sports if there are any nearby. Would prefer to live alone but am open to a roommate if cost requires me to. $600/mo range."
arizona,36fcv6,Sonoranpawn,3,Tue May 19 12:16:46 2015 UTC,"So, it sounds like someplace in Downtown Tempe (and surrounding areas) will work well for you. There's a transportation hub at College and Veteran's Way that all of the orbit buses, the major transit lines, and the light rail stop at. Valley Metro is the transit company and you can check all the bus routes/rail lines/orbits on their website. It's right next to ""A"" mountain (which is actually a butte) which is an easy hike. Like 40 minutes up and down in total. And Papago Park is close enough to bike to. And you'll definitely be able to walk to a bar. DT area I consider (with the things you want) would be from 13th Street (maybe parts of Broadway) to Rio Salado (south to north) and then from College (maybe to Rural or McClintock - depends on transit options) to Hardy (or Priest). Hardy between 13th and Rio Salado has some good apartment options, and you'll be able to go to Tempe Beach Park where you can run or bike or walk.  North of the lake there are some condos/apartments but I couldn't find the name of the one's I was looking for. A lot of them are way out of the price range even for the people who already live here, but there are some affordable ones near Curry/College/Roosevelt. These will be closer to Papago Park for hiking, and are also near-ish to the Mill Ave light rail stops or the Center Pkwy and Washington stops. These are a great location because it's a short cab ride from old town, bike or walk to Mill Ave in Tempe, and a 15-20 minute light rail ride to DT Phoenix.  Don't drink and drive here, not worth it. Anywhere you live in Tempe is 5 minute drive to freeway access.  There are some intramural sports leagues in Scottsdale. Tempe has rec leagues I think, but am not sure. Both cities offer recreational classes like yoga, jewelry making, sewing that are pretty affordable.  The different neighborhoods in Tempe have Facebook pages, so you can always check those out for rental options. Just google ""Tempe neighborhoods"" and you should find a list. If you see names like, Broadmor, Gilliland, Mitchell Park, Maple-Ash, you're finding the right stuff.  It's easiest to find good rentals when you can come here and just walk around the neighborhoods. A lot of rentals just have a sign out front, and there's no need to post online."
arizona,36fcv6,Ilsaluna,2,Tue May 19 21:26:01 2015 UTC,I live in tempe and it is very close to South mountain hiking ( I think that's what the mountain is called) which is a huge area and close to mill and old town scottsdale for night life. The music scene is pretty meh all over the greater phoenix area unfortunately but it's getting better.
arizona,36fcv6,Ilsaluna,2,Tue May 19 17:12:49 2015 UTC,If you're in the art scene I would say downtown. If you're on the materialistic side of scene definitely old town. Hipsters can be found in both but it really all depends on what scene you're trying to be in.
arizona,36fcv6,Ilsaluna,2,Wed May 20 07:12:22 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but a lot of the where depends on your budget. The other consideration is how much time do you want to spend driving to get from A to B and back?  Me? I'm partial to Arcadia and the immediate surrounding areas. It's minutes from the freeways, airport, Old Town, and there's all types of affordable housing, regardless of your budget."
arizona,36fcv6,Embryoyo,0,Sat May 23 02:33:38 2015 UTC,"Arcadia looks like a nice location, I will definitely check it out some more. My sister had me looking between E Indian School Rd and East Via de Ventura. I just got the okay from my job to work remotely, but I might end up going into an office some in Tempe by the intersection of W Broadway and S Priest Dr. So I'd like to have a reasonable drive to that area as well as up towards Arrowhead Lakes area where my dad and sister will be. At least initially, I'll be working from home mostly, and probably on east coast time, so driving shouldn't cause too many problems. Looking to pay around $600 per month either alone or with a roommate. Or might be interested in buying a small house if that were to end up being a better solution."
arizona,36fcv6,artistec,2,Sat May 23 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"That's a great area to work and just off a freeway. The drive to your family's is easy on the freeway. Housing will be easy; there's something for everyone. If possible, you should visit for a weekend and drive around the neighborhoods you like. There are several enclaves where places are rented by owners and don't get listed on services.  Take a look at places between Indian School Rd and Camelback Rd (north to south) and 36th St to 44th St (east to west). The Biltmore area, like Arcadia goes from insane expensive to reasonable and is also a great area, a few miles from Arcadia and the same thing. Close to freeways, shopping, nightlife, etc. Check 20th to 36th St, again Indian School but farther north to Lincoln.   The upside to being in central Phx is it's laid out in a square grid so it's ridic easy to find your way around and everything is 5-15mins away. And it's in the middle of all the freeways - I'm 5mins from going any direction.  I'm from here so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me."

arizona,362c9x,phoenix--insurgent,3,Fri May 15 14:39:52 2015 UTC,"I believe it's more of a discussion about lesser evils. Think about it, if these state agencies were buying this level of hardware out of their own pockets, instead of Mil surp, would the public react the same way? I agree that it's a double edged sword senario due to the freedoms we get to enjoy as US citizens, but I think the critical oversight required to yield ""controlled items"" as noted in the article is lacking.   For now, give the police what they need, but institute a mandated education/ training program. If they can't handle the hardware appropriately, revoke it.  Which is scarier here, police with access to tactical equipment so they can do their jobs, or police with the equipment and sub-par training?   I would also hope mandatory training would cut down on the swat technique for operations they deem higher risk. Do you really need 22 swat clad officers for a drug raid?"
arizona,362c9x,Csgod0,5,Fri May 15 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"/u/RangerBacksFan is trying to make up a reason for this. There is no reason for this besides keeping our defense contractors in big business.  Every year they make more weapons than the U.S. can use. They sell many abroad, but they always sell some to the U.S. Gov't. Even when the U.S. army says they don't need them, congress buys them anyways.   U.S Gov't has no need for all these weapons - so they house them on huge lots, sell even more of them to foreign countries, and then send the rest to our towns.  The supply is created first, not the demand."
arizona,362c9x,whowatches,2,Fri May 15 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"I dont disagree with that at all.  The military industrial complex is a HUGE problem.  There was that deal not long ago where our politicians voted to buy like 500 new tanks and the military leaders straight up told them dont send them to us, we have absolutely no need for them we have a ton in parking lots rusting away.  The politicans said they had to because the General Dynamics plant would have to lay some people off and it would hurt the company... I just dont blame the local police departments for that.    Im just pointing out other factors that are something to think about.  Im a gun owner (I own 3 times the national average) but I think part of the reason cops need stuff like this is because the crazy people have stuff that just as scary.  Have you ever been around or even shot a 50 cal rifle?  Ive never shot one but Ive been around them a few times they are ridiculous,  it hasnt happened yet but one day a group of crazy people, like those that flocked to Cliven Bundy's ranch, might try to use those guns against Americans in law enforcement.  There's crazy people out there and we have to be prepared to deal with them.  Id rather have some cops with weapons they dont really need than a bunch of dead people because some wackos had the cops out gunned.  We have a HUGE problem in this country with mass shootings.  It's only a matter of time until the crazy people that do shit like this step it up to the next level.  Police are there to protect us, how can we expect them to do so if there is a crazy ass with a rifle that shoots things a mile away if all they have is service pistols and shot guns?  Could we win a war if our enemy has better equipment than we do?  That's kindof our thing, we spend 10 times more money than any other military because we want the best weapons.  Its worked for our military for a long long time.  Have you ever looked into the North hollywood Shootout?  Check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout It took over 400 police men to take down 2 bank robbers... If they would have had some of this equipment people are all upset about today things may have played out MUCH differently."
arizona,362c9x,RangerBacksFan,5,Fri May 15 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"I don't find your argument compelling. All I see you doing is cherry-picking the worst crimes in the last 100 years, and then trying to use them to spread fear. 'Don't you want every weapon imaginable in case some big bad guy comes for you one day?'  No, I don't. You're willing to assume that there's some positive in all this, without evidence, that somehow every terrible crime would be prevented if we had just 1 more tank.  But you totally dismiss all the negatives. Are these police forces becoming more militarized as a result? Are they becoming more likely to escalate conflict than diffuse it when dealing with normal citizens? Are they killing more of us without trial? Are they starting to see themselves as warriors instead of peacekeepers?   I'll state this again: you are looking for a reason to make this okay, rather than being honest about what is actually driving this: money."
arizona,362c9x,whowatches,1 point,Fri May 15 18:22:22 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/RangerBacksfan.... But of course I'm biased. Of civilians can own military equipment. The police should have it as well. Or else you'll get another Hollywood shoot out scenario where the police are out gunned. No one bitching in this thread right now has ever been pulled over by a tank. So stfu with your petty militarization BS.

arizona,362c9x,Call_Me_A_Stoat,-4,Fri May 15 18:32:20 2015 UTC,Well when we as Americans demand to own military weapons the police will need to arm themselves appropriately.  A VAST majority of gun owners(myself included) are normal people that would never do anything to hurt anyone else BUT in every single group on the planet there are crazy people who mean to do harm.  If they own military style weapons the cops will also need to have those kinds of weapons.
arizona,362c9x,RangerBacksFan,8,Fri May 15 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"Is that why Sherrif Joe got a tank for his ""war on drugs""? Those damn meth and heroin addicts always shooting their damn military grade weapons at everyone all the time, better just to run them all over. /s"
arizona,362c9x,workingbarbie,-2,Fri May 15 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I dont like that police have to arm themselves like this but should they just be defenseless if a crazy person shows up?  Have you ever heard about the shooter that got in that tower at UT in Austin in the 60's/70's?  Civilians literally had to get their rifles out of their trucks and help the cops because all they had were handguns and they were out gunned.  Remember those guys who got completely dressed out in body armor and walked around in California for a while shooting people?  The cops had to go to a local gun store and raid the place to get the firepower to take them down.  Yes it sucks but as long as we think American citizens need to own AR15s, 50 cals and fully body armor the law enforcement community needs to be able to combat those kinds of weapons."
arizona,362c9x,RangerBacksFan,3,Fri May 15 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"as long as we think American citizens need to own AR15s, 50 cals   Thankfully the second amendment says nothing about the caliber or use of the arms it says we're allowed to bear.

They help uninsured and underinsured people with affordable health services, including dental. I am not sure of the exact procedure of getting an appointment or what the costs are, but I believe they are a nonprofit organization that runs on grants and special funding, so their purpose is exactly what you're looking for.

arizona,35jbb7,MegaWolf,2,Sun May 10 23:10:26 2015 UTC,Have you heard of wake surfing? You essentially surf on the wake of a boat and can be done in many of Arizona's beautiful lakes. I tried it a couple of weeks ago at Lake Roosevelt. A lot of fun. I think you need a certain type of boat to do it though.
arizona,35jbb7,MrNicejob,1 point,Mon May 11 01:55:37 2015 UTC,That sounds interesting. :)
arizona,35jbb7,Leakyradio,-2,Mon May 11 02:07:06 2015 UTC,So... Wakeboarding? For that you technically only need a boat fast enough to pull you out of the water. But really you need a ski boat.
arizona,35jbb7,Leakyradio,3,Mon May 11 20:09:17 2015 UTC,No rope
arizona,35jbb7,jdmercredi,0,Mon May 11 20:36:38 2015 UTC,No... Wake surfing. Wakeboarding requires you be pulled by rope behind the boat. You technically don't need a rope to wake surf. The boat needs to be able to create a wake directly behind the boat that is large enough to mimic the shape of a wave.

It sneaks up on you. It's by milemarker 221-ish. Turn right, go until you have to turn and take a left. The dirt road will end at a parking area and a trailhead. I think there's even a bathroom there.   Peralta Trailhead - take the 60 through the Gold Canyon area, turn off at the sign for the Peralta Trailhead. You'll be driving through a subdivision, the road will turn dirt, keep going til you get to the trail or find a spot to pull off. It's pretty darkish even before you get to the trailhead.  Take the Apache Trail to the Canyon Lake overlook. It can get kind of busy with traffic so it's not always the best spot to maintain your night vision.

Really though it's all a balance between a place you feel safe and a place that is far enough away to let you see what you want to see.  Take a look at a dark sky map like on that app and just start looking for the nearest yellow/green/blue area and cross reference with google Earth.    Trailhead parking lots are usually good.  I shoot a lot of photos at night so I'm always looking for new spots, each one has their pros and cons.  I also have a telescope and for me, even though sometimes the drive sucks it really is worth it to get under a really dark sky.  Oh!  Here's a bonus spot that's right in the neighborhood.  Sunset only though.  If you take 44th st south from Washington st about halfway to University is a stoplight.  Its right after you come out of a dip right by the airport.  Take a left at the light and a right at the stop sign you'll be on a road that is near a airport light rail depot and it leads to a chain link fence that's always closed (it's a service road for the airport).  There's a dirt road next to it that you can park on and it overlooks the dip on 44th st.  Hang out there 20 mins before sunset and on most days there are planes landing on the runway right across the street and they come in screaming and super low.  Probably the closest you can legally get to a plane in the air without being inside it.  Super fun sunset spot.  Don't try to pet the dog that sometimes lives there."

arizona,34yv1h,mauxly,1 point,Wed May 6 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"From AP:    CIENEGA SPRINGS, Ariz. (AP) — A man snorkeling in the Colorado River near the Arizona and California border was terrified — and later embarrassed — when he came across two fake skeletons sitting in lawn chairs about 40 feet underwater.  The man reported the skeletons to the La Paz County Sheriff's Office on Monday, launching a hunt for what authorities believed could be real bodies.  It turned out the skeletons were fake and had been strategically placed to appear as if they were sitting together, their lawn chairs bound to large rocks. A diver from the Buckskin Fire Department captured the scene on a video camera attached to his head. The sheriff's office called the scene a tea party.  The skeletons are wearing sunglasses, and one is holding a sign that includes the words ""Bernie"" and ""dream in the river,"" although the entire sign is not legible. The sign also has the date of Aug. 16, 2014, which is possibly when the skeletons were placed there.  ""I don't think they were trying to set up anything to scare anyone. I think they were gonna try to be funny,"" Lt. Curtis Bagby said.  The sign could be a reference to the movie ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" in which the two main characters lug around their dead boss for days, losing and recovering his body several times, Bagby said. At one point in the film, Bernie's corpse falls off a boat and into water.  The sheriff's office won't launch an investigation into who left the skeletons there, Bagby said.  ""Things happen. We go all the time to false alarms. That's just a first-responder's life. We're trying not to be overly concerned about it, not make too big a deal out of it,"" Bagby said.  Instead, the sheriff's office wants to have a little fun with the situation. Bagby said divers will recover the skeletons sometime this week and that he is considering placing them outside the sheriff's office as a joke.  ""We like to show some things that are fun, some levity too. But in the meantime, don't think it's OK to go put something there,"" he said."

That was my point above, the only difference between the ""normal"" and the ""freaks"" is that the the normal ones complied after 50 years of government intervention, including taking up arms to defend polygamy. It wasn't an enlightened change of view. Even today, the Mormon church is an extremely patriarchal institution.  My other point is that the ""normal"" ones, like other religious voters, demand you and I comply to their values. Gay marriage is illegal, millions are in jail for drugs, and plenty of other issues are caused because people like this don't want freedom, they want society to cater to their views.

arizona,34yocy,crossmerciaroadtrip,3,Tue May 5 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"I have hiked Havasupai from the trailhead twice and planned both trips for a group of eight, one of which was in July.  The earliest you can make reservations to camp is the beginning of the calendar year.  It is recommended to make reservations to camp at least six months out, It's a VERY busy time so calling and calling to get through is about all you can do at this point. The lodge fills up extremely quickly and likely has no vacancy at this time (so they don't pick up)  The hike in/out from the trailhead can very strenuous even for experienced hikers, even from the lodge it is around three miles round trip to moony falls (lower) and back (each day) and walking is the only way to get there.  There are no mules or helicopters.  So even staying at the lodge you'll need to bring all your day hike gear with you and have plenty of water and usually a cold lunch with you each day.  There is however a natural spring to fill up at called the Fern Spring below Havasupai falls in the camping area.  Usually there are open spots on the helicopter and mules but you'll want to be sure not to wait to the last minute to fly/ride out.  Two days is very short time for this, four is ideal and three or more is recommended in my opinion.  Ideally, try to plan to be packed and mounted for the trail down before dawn.  Its worth it but you need to do your own research and have a solid plan with proper gear.  Good luck!"

There are good schools here but most of them are private and you will need to account for tuition costs.  You can find hockey leagues at the Ice Den in North Scottsdale  State taxes are very reasonable compared to other states in the US. Property taxes are pretty low overall but will be higher in Scottsdale/Fountain Hills than in Phoenix.   Culture is what you make of it, Phoenix is a mix of a lot of people from somewhere else, which affects the culture. However, we have great sports teams, a ton of concert venues, good museums, and no shortage of family friendly entertainment options.  Gun violence isn't an issue most places. Like any major city there are definitely places in the valley to avoid due to high crime rate. With that said, you will see people carrying firearms frequently, as Arizona as some of the most lax gun laws in the country.   The best thing about the Phoenix area and Arizona in general is the great natural beauty this place offers and the ease at which we can have access to it.

arizona,34emyb,musicmlwl,2,Thu Apr 30 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Education should be a big concern. Arizona schools are among the worst in the United States. There are good schools here but most of them are private and you will need to account for tuition costs.   Some of the school districts are terrible IF your kid is at-risk, educationally, and you're poor.  There are a number of very good school districts in the valley (Chandler and Gilbert, at least).  Even without that, there are a bunch of excellent charter schools and private school for those people in the not-so-great public districts.  But yeah... that latter bit is also where the problems come in.  It's all well and good to be able to drive your kid to a school that caters to your kid's special needs, but if you are unable to do so, then you're pretty much screwed."
arizona,34emyb,az_liberal_geek,3,Fri May 1 04:57:19 2015 UTC,We are also considering Chandler and Gilbert. This is good to know!
arizona,34emyb,az_liberal_geek,2,Fri May 1 11:52:28 2015 UTC,"Cool.  Yeah, Gilbert is a great place to live if you have a family (not so good if you're young and want to party).  Plus, you can also buy houses with acre lots without being a multimillionaire and without moving out to the sticks (like Queen Creek).  FWIW, my wife and I moved to AZ from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which apparently has a very Canadian culture.  I'm still told to this day, nearly 20 years removed, that I sound like I'm from Ontario when I speak.  I can say that there is a bit of a culture shift moving to the Phoenix area, but it's not too drastic.  Really, the heat is the one thing that all non-locals underestimate the importance of."

arizona,34emyb,thedukeofaz,2,Mon May 4 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"It completely depends on exactly where you live!  There are only two major airports that would cause enough air traffic to really notice: Sky Harbor and Phoenix-Mesa Gateway.  Sky Harbor is big enough that it'll affect anywhere you live in the valley -- you are either under a flight path or you're not.  Gateway is notably smaller and has fewer flight paths.  If you're under one of them, though, then that can be notable.  There are a few smaller airports dotting the landscape, most notably the Chandler Airpark.  Those only have small planes and are far less frequently used.  If you're not right up against one of them, you likely won't even notice they are there.  Train noise can actually be more noticeable than airplane noise, if you're a few miles from a track..."

arizona,34emyb,devilscharm,6,Thu Apr 30 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"It would be very different.  If you live in the Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area, critters are not a problem although I guess you run into normal pest problems like most households.  The education system is atrocious - I guess I blame politicians & voters for this.  Obviously you won't get hockey similar to Canada, but several places try (Arizona does have a pro team).  Exploring?  It's going to be waaaay different from the northeast.  The Phoenix area gets about 9 inches of rain a year (and you better not be outside that day) and I won't even bother talking about temperature differences.  But it's an absolutely beautiful place for exploring.  Deserts, mountains, scrub forests, Ponderosa pine forests, even some snow country.  There's backpacking year round and if you have a vehicle, some good four wheel drive trails.  I like it."

arizona,34emyb,verylate,5,Thu Apr 30 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"I can answer a few of your questions at least...  For hockey, you'd most likely be going to the Ice Den Scottsdale - they use the USA Hockey development model (or that's the ideal at least).  We go to their sister rink in Chandler and are pretty happy with the hockey program.  You'll find a ton of Canadians at the rink.  There's youth hockey and adult leagues and the facilities are pretty nice.  Snakes/bugs/spiders - it happens.  You'll be living in the desert.  Depending on where you live, you may have scorpions, black widow spiders, rattlesnakes or creepy but not dangerous bugs too.  Most of us use an exterminator service that comes out every other month or so to keep the creepy-crawlies out of the living spaces.  I've lived in AZ for about 18 years and haven't been bitten by a single one of those nasty things, though I've seen them all.  It's really nothing to be overly concerned with.  Gun violence - again, not an everyday concern.  You may see people who carry guns openly in AZ (certainly moreso than in Ontario!) - but the likelihood of actually witnessing gun violence is extremely low.  Just make sure that your kids are educated on gun safety - and ask if your kids' friends have guns in the house and if they are safely locked up.  There's way too much to be said on this topic without a big argument breaking out.  Education - you have options.  There's both the public school system and the charter school system, so you have some choice - and there's always private school too.  Scottsdale/Fountain Hills are higher income areas, so the schools are going to be better in general - it sucks, but that's how it is.  Check Great Schools for reviews and rankings.  In general, I would say that you'll find Scottsdale to be a safe place for your family.  There's a ton of Canadians around, especially if you're in the youth hockey scene.  The weather will be an adjustment, for sure.  I would strongly recommend visiting in the late summer months (but not moving until late October if you can help it), so that you can experience the heat before you commit to it.  Anyway, if you have more questions on hockey - that's probably where I'd have the most answers.  We're pretty involved in that ourselves (and my husband is from Alberta)."

arizona,34emyb,wee0x1b,2,Thu Apr 30 16:17:20 2015 UTC,"I just want to add my two cents to the whole school thing - I grew up in Fountain Hills and went to elementary, middle school and high school there. Yes, it is in a higher-income community but the school itself is pretty broke, not many extra-curricular activities or art programs, especially compared to bigger schools in Scottsdale. I've always thought it had something to do with the large retired population in town not caring to vote for school funding because they don't have kids. That being said, it was a great place to grow up. Fairly safe and fairly small, the kind of place where everyone knows everyone (though that can have its negatives too of course.) There are no streetlights and the stars are incredible every night, being surrounded by beautiful desert makes it feel isolated but you're still about twenty minutes or less from just about anywhere you'd need to go. In conclusion, 9/10 would be raised there again"

You can always check the flight paths and noise exposure maps to ensure that you're not buying in a problem area (https://skyharbor.com/community/NoiseExposureMaps.html).

arizona,34emyb,250TestaRossa,4,Thu Apr 30 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"Arizona on average has some of the worst schools in the US, with also some of the highest ranked individual schools.  I'm not sure how Canada allocates education funds, but in the US, each school district is (primarily) funded by property taxes local to that school.  Poorer areas may not have enough money to properly fund their school, whereas North Scottsdale, or Paradise Valley, or Fountain Hills are paying for schools with the property taxes from million-dollar homes, so they are going to have less budget issues.  People pay a lot of attention to what school district their home is in, which determines which school district their kids attend.  There are plenty of good public schools.  There are also great private and charter schools - however, note that in AZ, private schools are not required to use certified teachers, and there is less oversight for those schools in general. Some are desperate to get students, so they will tell you what you want to hear to sign you up. Regardless of your choice, you need to really investigate the school you are sending you kids to."

arizona,34emyb,artistec,2,Thu Apr 30 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"looking to relocate to Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, or somewhere around there.   I live in that area, and like it.  It's suburban, so you need a car to get anywhere; there's no walking down to the corner market. And it's typical suburbia, but there are lots of great place to eat, shop, etc. The area has movie theaters, community pools, recreation centers, etc. Your kids might like stuff like Cracker Jax, for example.  Scottsdale also has what we call the ""wash park"".  It's an 11 mile long park that runs north to south. Originally built to ease flood water down to the Salt River, they cleverly decided to also make it one huge park. So you can pack up the kids and the bikes and have an 11 mile long bike ride and never cross a street or traffic. There's baseball areas, frisbee golf things, playgrounds, all that -- even trout fishing. My wife and I like to pack a lunch and bike around until we find a nice place to have a picnic. Bring a book, hang out, people watch, and relax a little.   culture   Almost everybody here is from somewhere else, so there's quite a weird mix. We have lots of museums, galleries, concert venues, etc. The Desert Botanical Garden is a favorite of mine. They have events all the time.   gun violence   Little to none in most areas. You probably won't see a gun unless you go buy one. We do have urban areas that have crime, us being near the border and all. But in Scottsdale? Very little.  The crime rate here is about half the national average: http://www.city-data.com/crime/crime-Scottsdale-Arizona.html  I live near a middle school and routinely see kids walking home unattended, playing outside, etc.   education system/post-secondary for our kids   The schools in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills (they share a school system) are generally considered to be very good, so much so that people move here purely for the schools. When you look at buying a house, one of the ""features"" listed will be ""Scottsdale school system"". But you do pay more in property taxes for it. Well worth it, IMO (and I don't have kids). There are also a lot of private options.   hockey quality for all of us (we all play)   I know we have a few ice rinks, but I couldn't speak to their quality. I'm not a skater.   state taxes   Very low. I pay about half what I did in California, and about 1/3 in property taxes, and 80% as much in sales tax.   snakes/bugs/spiders   They exist. We have scorpions, black widows, brown recluses, rattlesnacks, etc. I've lived here off and on since the late 60's and have spent a lot of time outdoors (I was a geology major in college, and am an avid hunter), and have never been bitten. Couple stings and such.  What we don't have are many mosquitoes and ticks and such.  You can eat dinner on your back porch on a warm summer night, right out in the open. During the monsoons we get a wave of mosquitoes, but it's generally short-lived.  And the monsoons... I'd live here just for those.  Imagine getting rain in huge droplets that's warmer than bathwater. Gorgeous weather.  Also, keep in mind that half the state is over 5,000 feet in elevation, and covered in pine trees and such. If you ever miss the forest, you're a 90 minute drive away from the oaks and pines up to the north pf the Phoenix metro area.  And if people mention the heat, well, mention that you never have to shovel it. It's only really hot here 3-4 months out of the year (and everything is air conditioned anyway). The rest of the time you can wear shorts and a t-shirt. I call that a net win."

arizona,34emyb,thedukeofaz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome!    People tend to ""hibernate"" indoors in the summer here.  But summer nights here are amazing. The air is like perfect skin temp.  And then there's always spending all weekend in and out of the pool. My grandmother used to garden and I think from May to September she never took off her swimsuit.  One of my favorite things to do in the summer is sit on the back porch at night with a book, just in a pair of shorts. Or get a bucket of beers, climb up on the roof and watch the monsoon storms roll in.  The smell is incredible.  And I don't know if your husband is a cook, but if he's ever had a hankering for a BBQ in December, that's entirely possible. You want to grill a steak on Christmas Eve? Go right ahead, it'll probably be 65F and sunny outside.  Have you ever wanted to use your garage for something besides storing a car? I have an entire workshop in my garage. If your husband is into woodworking or whatever, every house comes with a built-in workshop as long as you park outside.  You'll have trouble finding a house in Scottsdale without a pool, probably. Quite a lot of them in Scottsdale have one. They're not that much work to take care of, either. Though there are a lot of pool service companies here and their rates are generally reasonable due to the competitiveness.  One tip, though: try to get a house that faces south. It will have a much more livable back patio/yard in the summer."

The house market is great, I bought a fairly large house for the fraction of what I would have payed in Quebec.    I may have seen 1 or 2 scorpions in the 4 years I've been living here, it all depends on your location. (Avoid mountain side).  Never saw a rattle snake.  Black Widows are however everywhere outside.  Never saw one indoor.  The little things are probably the worst, no Tim Horton, used to play a lot of hockey, now I play golf, believe it or not, I miss winter sometime.  Constantly seeing lizard is still pretty exotic to me.    Moving here was a good thing for me, Az is a beautiful state with endless places to explore, and restaurant to try out.

Personally, I like the culture, everyone that I have come in contact with in all my years hear has been nice, even in my customer service job. Gun violence isn't a huge issue, although most people own guns and many carry. We have some of the best laws in the country regarding firearms if you like to shoot like I do. There are some hockey rinks but not really sure of all the locations. Taxes aren't that bad and we have some extremely low property taxes in comparison to the rest of the nation. And get used to the massive roaches. They'll occasionally be in your house, but be ready. You also get crickets in the summer. Snakes and other animals aren't a big concern unless you're living on the outskirts of a community. But fountain hills and the Scottsdale area are extremely safe. Overall police response time is quick so you should never be in fear. Arizona state university is actually pretty good and has some very good program. (Go Devils).

arizona,34emyb,Wilky323,1 point,Fri May 1 11:53:20 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid of some of the negative stuff people are posting here. I've lived in Scottsdale for 14 years and have nothing bad to say about it. The only thing is that its gotten pretty crowded here over the past decade and its not all that cheap anymore, including housing. Phoenix is now the 6th largest city in the US and the cost of living has gone up as we've grown. But my experience has been that salaries haven't kept pace. Phoenix suffers from the ""San Diego"" factor. Just like San Diego, companies can offer lower salaries even though the cost of living is high simply because people want to move here and they (the employers) have a ton of candidates to choose from. I am hiring two people for my team at work right now and have been flooded with out-of-state resumes despite offering what I believe is a below-market salary.  I can vouch that there is hockey here in Scottsdale. As a part-time sports photographer, I've shot numerous high school hockey games at various rinks around Phoenix. The closest one to you will be the Ice Den in N. Scottsdale:  http://www.coyotesice.com/  This is where the Phoenix Coyotes (NHL) practice. There are two rinks  and many leagues playing at all hours of the day. There are other rinks as well (at least one other in S Scottsdale in the Hayden/McKellips area I believe).  The education system is bad. There is no denying that. Home school if you can. Otherwise, you're stuck, although I'm sure there are private schools.   I've lived here for 14 years and I've never seen a scorpion. You have no reason to be concerned about that in Scottsdale - which is entirely built up. If you were further out where its less developed you'd be more likely to encounter one.   Culture is great here. There's lots to do in Phoenix/Scottsdale not to mention tons of great National Parks to visit in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah that are just a few hours drive from Phoenix. San Diego is 5 hours away. LA is 7. Summers are hot, so there's not as many outdoor activities at that time, but in Spring/Winter/Fall the weather is perfect for being outside. And... no snow!  The big issue for you is education. Considering how young your kids are, it may make sense for you to live elsewhere if private school is not an option."

arizona,34emyb,awpti,1 point,Sat May 2 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that Scottsdale has ""open enrollment"". That means that even if you live outside the geographic area of a school your kids can still attend there if you want them to. In that case they wouldn't get public transportation - you'd be responsible for getting them to/from school each day. But they won't be denied attending the school. I don't know all the details - like if there are limits to the number of kids from outside the district who can attend. You'd want to research that. Chaparral High School in Scottsdale is considered a very good high school (I know you're kids aren't that age yet) and many kids attend there from miles away because their parents want them to go there. Chaparral also has a hockey team. Paradise Valley is another town in the Phoenix area that is considered to have good schools. It is a very wealthy area (many actors and athletes live there). Don't know if they have open enrollment or not. I don't know anything about Fountain Hills, but considering that it is an upscale neighborhood, I would suspect the schools must be decent. But you definitely don't want your kids to attend a school in Phoenix."

I've been to the Grand Canyon before and never had an issue, but I'm really surprised about it filling up, I figured there would be tons of areas to camp.  Do you suggest anywhere else worth seeing?

arizona,34b0o2,lordguadi,2,Wed Apr 29 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend you get below the rim on your hike. That is really the best way to experience and appreciate the canyon. Bright Angel is a great trail that offers many beautiful views, as does South Yavapai. But Bright Angel has more resources. Do NOT plan on getting to the bottom! Remember that coming up is going to take you longer than going down and that the temps will increase as you go down. But by respecting these realities, you can have an awesome day hiking below the rim.   For your northern AZ plan, Horseshoe Bend and Antelope Canyon are both great things to see. What do you want to accomplish at Antelope Point Marina? If you are just there for dinner, the Rainbow Room at Lake Powell Resort has a better view. Downside- it's actually in the National Recreation Area so unless you have a park pass, you have to pay to get there."
arizona,34b0o2,because_dinosaur,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:13:44 2015 UTC,Wouldn't temps decrease as you go down? Since heat rises? I always heard it was 10-15 degrees cooler at the bottom.
arizona,34b0o2,kriegers-clone,2,Mon May 4 21:34:51 2015 UTC,"Other way around- it is 10-15 degrees warmer at the bottom. Heat may rise in a house, but there's a reason why there is snow on top of a mountain for much longer than at the bottom. In the atmosphere, temperatures drop 5 degrees for every 1,000 feet of elevation. Basically at the Grand Canyon, you walk from the elevation of Flagstaff to the elevation of Phoenix. And thus, the temps go up.   http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/find-us/weather/  http://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/ask-a-weatherman--how-does-elevation-affect-temperature-"

arizona,346uy9,kriegers-clone,5,Tue Apr 28 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"There are two tour options.   The basic tour takes you down to see the Nevada side intake pipe and then on to the generation room. It is interesting but not amazing.  The other tour then splits off and instead of going to the gift shop you go into the damn dam itself.  There are four tiny little air vents in the face of the dam and you get to go look out of one of them. Bring a nice camera.  Then back to dam elevator to go look at the ladder. In the event the elevator dies you get to climb a ladder out of the dam. It is pretty impressive.  Yes, it is stupidly overpriced, but I think it is definitely one of those things everyone should do at least once."

There are a ton of don't miss attractions on that route:   Canyon de Chelly Monument Valley Horseshoe Bend Antelope Canyon (both Upper and Lower) Vermillion Cliffs Grand Canyon North Rim Grand Canyon South Rim Sedona   There are other great places in Arizona, south of there that I'd recommend if you will be on a more southerly route (I-10):   Scottsdale   Musical Instrument Museum Taliesen West (Frank Lloyd Wright's studio) Butterfly Wonderland Desert Botanical Garden  Saguaro National Park Sonora Desert Museum   Keep in mind that Arizona will be hot that time of year.

arizona,342xbt,artistec,2,Tue Apr 28 06:54:44 2015 UTC,"The only thing you would need reservations for would be guided tours of Canyon de Chelly, which I highly recommend doing. You can see the canyon from the rim - there are 10 overlooks on the north (3) and south (7) rim - but to go into the canyon you need a Navajo guide. You can go by foot, horseback, or ATV for varying lengths (a couple of hours to a full day).  Upper Antelope Canyon also requires a guide but when I've gone I just made a reservation at the last minute, but that was in the off-season (February). It might be wiser to make a reservation ahead of time in June.  Lower Antelope Canyon is right across the street from Upper. It does not take reservations. They have one tour per hour (maybe two in the summer)."
arizona,342xbt,Davii_bowie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:33:00 2015 UTC,"awesome. Gonna look up the tours and work out what we wanna see while we are there. Super awesome advise, thanks a lot."

LVery pretty, there is quite a few great Lakes to visit up there as well. Lots of trails and little towns."
arizona,342xbt,kirinaz,2,Mon Apr 27 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"The Grand Canyon is an obvious choice, and I suggest trying to do it at sunrise to really experience its beauty. If you're in Phoenix, old town Scottsdale is great for souvenirs or nightlife. Sedona would be fun for hiking and lakes, plus it's cooler than Phoenix itself. Tucson has Biosphere 2 and a planetarium near the University of Arizona if you're looking for something slightly educational. Tombstone is also a great place to go (albeit touristy) as it is really the quintessential western town. Arizona in the summer can be hot, so make sure you check the weather of whatever part of the state your in, and have lots of fun! It's a great state with plenty to do"

arizona,33z46y,beerandknitting,11,Mon Apr 27 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, Antelope Canyon requires a guide. But its worth visiting. There are actually two main canyons - Upper & Lower. Upper is much more crowded. Lower is across the street and less visited (don't know why).   Upper will have about 400 people in it at any given time (6 tour companies can bring 60 people per hour + guides, etc). Lower usually only has one tour group per hour.   Monument Valley is amazing. It only takes a couple of hours to drive through the valley, stopping at all the cool places. There are some other things to see nearby such as Teardrop Arch, but they require guides too. The drive down MV does not require a guide. You don't need 3 days there. Twenty-four hours should be enough.   Since you're in the area, I highly recommend Canyon de Chelly. It is free and is beautiful. If you have time, go down into the canyon with a guide for an up-close view (for a fee; make reservations ahead of time). The guide will take you through the canyon on foot, horseback, or ATV (your choice which tour you want).   While in Page (where Antelope Canyon is) don't miss Horseshoe Bend. Its just a mile or two south of Page and is accessible via short, free hike. You'll see the parking lot on the west side of 89.   You may also want to consider Vermillion Cliffs, which is also nearby Page."

arizona,33z46y,Kiheiboy,2,Mon Apr 27 03:37:11 2015 UTC,Any chance you could his Horseshoe Bend?  In my opinion it's the most beautiful place in the state.  I did have a very different experience that most visitors as we camped close to the edge on private property and hiked out to the rim for a LONG stay.  We probably sat on the edge for 2 hours just enjoying the beauty.  Its well worth a visit since you'll be close
arizona,33z46y,RangerBacksFan,2,Mon Apr 27 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"Antelope Canyon is small, and yes, you need a guide.  It's spectacular, but you can cover it in one afternoon easily.  Two days seems good in Monument Valley.  It's gorgeous.  I actually greatly prefer both spots to the Grand Canyon.  If you've never been to Canyon de Chelly it's definitely worth seeing while you're near Monument Valley.  It's like the Grand Canyon but totally undeveloped."

arizona,33z46y,artistec,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"I believe so. The alternate route is north into Utah on 89 through Kanab.

If you're going to be in Page for Vermillion Cliffs there is no reason to skip Antelope Canyon, unless you just don't have the time."

arizona,33mu9d,cnacke,5,Thu Apr 23 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"Here's an excerpt from the AZ Supreme Court ruling on the tower investigation which I think shows how much Arpaio cares about the judiciary:   The testimony regarding the purported Court Tower investigation, which involved entering the sanctity of the homes of large numbers of county employees,often on weekends, was surreal. The evidence was that officers, often late at night, with surreptitiously hidden recorders, demanded to enter the homes of these individual employees to interrogate them. It ignored the very essence of the Fourth Amendment Constitutional rights guaranteed to those employees that eachRespondent swore to uphold. Yet, it was normal in the world created by Respondents.  ...  The coaster crashes in flames in “Bizarro World.”  Immediately after bringing the Stapley II and Wilcox indictments, in what is possibly the darkest moment of this nightmarish ride, on December 8, 2009,Thomas and Aubuchon quietly met with Arpaio and Hendershott behind closed doors. This shameful gathering had but one motive. The foursome met to conspire about how to muzzle their next most-feared nemesis. After much late-night intrigue by Thomas and Aubuchon, the conclave's results were revealedthe following morning.   On December 9th, Thomas and Aubuchon filed criminal charges against Presiding Criminal Judge Gary Donahoe without a shred of evidence that Donahoe had committed any crime.  Their provocation was fear, and their purpose was simple. They charged Donahoe to stop him from holding a hearing that was scheduled that afternoon. They feared the judge might rule against Thomas and his office, halting them from handling any more cases involving MCBOS and the County.   The direct complaint filed against Judge Donahoe charged him with bribery,obstruction, and hindering, with absolutely no evidence to support even a single claim. The probable cause statement that accompanied this despicable work was borrowed wholesale from David Hendershott's musings and had no basis inreality. In fact, in the hearing of this current matter, Thomas and Aubuchon could not testify to a single scrap of evidence of a crime committed by Judge Donahoe. Knowing full well that the complaint was patently false at the time it was filed, in Thomas' and Aubuchon's “Bizarro World,” the respondents committed perjury and caused others to perjure themselves when they charged Judge Donahoe.  ...  18 U.S.C. § 241 makes it a crime to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any person in the free exercise or enjoyment of a right or privilege secured to him by the U.S. Constitution. A judge’s work-related expression and ability to engage in his profession both implicate privileges secured to him by the Constitution."

Look at the shithead Governor that just got elected, the State Superintendent of Schools has zero qualifications but got elected anyway just because of the (R) next to her name on the ballot, all in addition to the countless elections ol Joe has won.

If you smash them so that the housing prevent the platters from spinning, then you get a good amount of protection. A professional could still remove the platters and access your old data, though.  IIRC you need to heat the platters to like 400C to get them to delaminate properly.  Sometimes places like Fry's will drill and recycle them for you. The Fry's in San Diego did this a while back."

I moved away from AZ 10+ years ago, so I'm not quite as jaded as the rest of these folks.  There is plenty of lovely, interesting stuff between PHX and YUM.   You can drive through Gila Bend, which has a shrimp farm about 5 miles outside of town.  The shrimp are good -- the olive oil is amazing.  It's off a dirt road, so maybe not the best plan if you rent a economy car, but a fun side trip otherwise.  Instead of taking the 85, you can take the 10 all the way to the 95.  The junction of those two highways is Quartzsite.  That place is a trip, and beautiful.  The drive down the 95 takes you right past the Kofa Mountains.  You can stop and hike Palm Canyon.  Gorgeous.  You can go the opposite way and take the 10 down to Casa Grande.  Other folks have mentioned the ostrich farm, which is cool.  But there is also Casa Grande, the largest Native American structure in the southwest?  Or maybe US?  I don't remember, but it's big.  And the rain cover structure that protects it from the elements is itself a Federally protected historical building.  Fun all around, and definitely something different to see.  Others have mentioned date shakes in Dateland.  I second.  They are delicious and weird, and the town is weird, and I always love stopping there.  Hopefully that gives you some ideas.  Never mind the curmudgeons on this sub.  People never appreciate what they have in their own back yards until they leave.  Edit -- If you stop in Quartzsite, go check out the Hi Jolly memorial.  It's dedicated to the camel handler that accompanied the US Army's Camel Cavalry division on their tour of Arizona.  It's a pyramid topped with a tiny golden camel.  Seriously.  Fuck people who say there's nothing to see.  They just aren't looking.  Edit 2: apparently the shrimp farm closed. A travesty. You can still stop in gila bend and pose with the Sinclair dinosaur."

arizona,338qjb,jdmercredi,5,Wed Apr 22 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"This is what google suggested.  http://archive.azcentral.com/travel/articles/2006/06/14/20060614south-yuma-CR.html  If you think southwestern Arizona is just a place you pass through on your way to California or Puerto Peñasco, you're missing out.  With everything from hikes and remote landscapes to fine dining (no kidding!) and a pyramid marking the Official Center of the World, who says there's nothing to do in southwestern Arizona? (OK, that last one is just across the Colorado River in California.)  Now is an ideal time for a road trip. Some ideas.  Breakfast  You'll need a hearty meal, so start early and head west on Interstate 10. At Exit 112, take Arizona 85 south about 35 miles to Gila Bend.  Your mission? A rendezvous with the Space Age Outer Limits Restaurant, a Gila Bend landmark. You'll know it by the flying saucer on the roof.  Before eating, check out the murals on the inside of the 28-foot-wide flying saucer from the motel lobby. Then head next door for breakfast.  The interior of the restaurant is bright and cheery. Iconic images from the U.S. space program - ranging from Mercury flights and Gemini spacewalks to lunar landings and the space shuttle - form another mural in the dining room, where paintings and photographs (many signed by astronauts) hang on walls.  Try one of the hearty omelets ($6.79), which come with a side of hash browns or refried beans. Or, better yet, Duke's Good Morning Breakfast ($5.99), a couple of eggs cooked to order atop a bed of toast and a slice of cheese, with hash browns and bacon or sausage on the side.  Next up: petroglyphs  Get on Interstate 8 by going west on Pima Street about two miles. Continue to Exit 102 and take Painted Rock Road north 10.8 miles to Rocky Point Road. Turn west and drive about half a mile on the well-graded unpaved road, then turn south to the entrance of the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site.  Hundreds of figures stand out against dark basalt boulders. Signs in English, Spanish and Tohono O'odham describe the petroglyphs - animals and humans, sun and moon and geometric figures - but no one really knows what these figures mean or why these ancient inhabitants took the time to make them.  A short trail loops around the petroglyphs, and more signs describe other features, including the Gila River, the geology of the Painted Rock Mountains, the Mormon Battalion, the Butterfield Trail and the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.  Date milkshakes  Back to the freeway. With all the history and prehistory you've been absorbing, you're probably feeling peckish by now, so pull off at Exit 67 and try one of Dateland's famous date milkshakes.  Yes, it sounds odd, but the shakes ($2.88) are surprisingly good - sweet and mild and so thick they're hard to suck through a straw. They're rich, too, so much so that one may be enough for two people.  Afterward, you can taste free samples of dates as you browse the gift shop.  On to Yuma  The craggy profile of the Muggins Mountains comes into view as you approach Yuma. A trail of sorts leads around Muggins Peak, but it's rough in places and hard to follow in others. Experienced hikers, though, will enjoy the challenging five-mile trek.  When you think of fine dining, what American cities come to mind? New Orleans, of course, and San Francisco. And . . . Yuma?  Well, maybe not yet. But the River City Grill is a find. It doesn't look like much, but don't let that throw you. If the weather's good, sit outside on the brick patio, where colorful wooden chairs, strings of lights and soft music create a feeling of casual elegance.  The restaurant offers more than 50 wines, and its menu, based on the cuisines of the Mediterranean, Pacific Rim, India and Caribbean, is extensive and imaginative.  We started with Vietnamese spring rolls ($8.95), a pleasing combination of mint, mango and rice noodles served with a sesame peanut sauce. My vegetarian wife enjoyed the blackened tofu, an almost Cajun-style mix of tofu, rice, black beans and corn salsa ($13.95), while I tried the mustard-crusted halibut ($20.95) with spinach ricotta ravioli and olive tapenade. Superb.  Fourth Avenue has a variety of motels, but for something different, try the historic Hotel Lee in the old downtown area. Book a room early; they go quickly in the winter.  'Official' Center of the World  Now head west a few miles on I-8 and take Exit 164 to Felicity, Calif., home of the Official Center of the World, established in 1985. A pyramid marking the spot was designated neither by geographic nor astronomic measurement, but by civil decree.  A sculpture of the arm of God from Michelangelo's painting in the Sistine Chapel points to the pyramid and the Walls of Remembrance, several 100-foot-long, 5-foot-high slabs engraved with an eclectic variety of names and events, ranging from the 1949 graduating class of Princeton University to the history of French aviation.  A section of original stairway from the Eiffel Tower, mounted in concrete, stands a short distance away.  For $2, you can take a 15-minute tour, half of which consists of watching a video of recent dedication ceremonies.  Then comes your entry into the pyramid itself. After your guide unlocks the doors and ushers you inside, you'll be directed to stand on the bronze dot that marks the Official Center of World and face the Chocolate Mountains to the north. Then you'll receive a numbered certificate - suitable for framing - with your name on it, attesting to the exact minute you stood at the Center of the World.  And back to reality  Now that your chakras are aligned and you're at one with the universe, return to Yuma and take U.S. 95 north, passing through the stark lands of the Yuma Proving Grounds. If you have time, take a short hike into Palm Canyon in the Kofa Mountains.  Take the well-graded Palm Canyon Road about 7.5 miles east to the trailhead.  A short hike takes you to a side canyon where you'll see the only stand of indigenous palm trees in Arizona.  Next, push on to Quartzsite, which has been described as the world's largest parking lot.  Acre upon acre of RVs are parked across the desert, forming a sprawling informal metropolis that is part mobile-home park and part yard sale.  There are several places to eat, and it's hard to beat Sweet Darlene's Restaurant & Bakery on the east side of town.  The nondescript restaurant is, well, a shed. But it's a nice shed, with carpeting and ceiling fans and paintings of local landscapes. The décor might best be described as Early Midwestern Church Basement, with long folding tables and plastic chairs.  But people don't come for the décor; they come for the food - good, solid Midwestern food. Darlene's is famous for its Friday Night Fish Fry, when it typically serves more than 700 dinners.  Be sure to save room for one of Darlene's homemade desserts. There's nothing like a big wedge of chocolate cream pie to keep you happy all the way back to Phoenix."

Be careful going down 95 past the Kofa refuge, there's a herd of wild horses and donkeys around there that enjoy playing chicken with passing cars.

arizona,338qjb,nickfromnt77,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"The drive from Phoenix to Yuma, I've done so many times, I'm not sure  there's anything worth 'seeing' as a tourist. Depending on your route, you'll see different things.  (All directions from the airport)  Most direct, I-10W -> Hwy 85 -> I-8 -> Yuma: This will take you out the west end of Phoenix, through the small town of Gila Bend. I've been driving through that town since I was an infant, practically. Traditional stops over the past four decades include the A&W or Dairy Queen, but usually just for a fuel top off or a quick bite. Don't speed through town, you don't want a ticket, I promise. West of Gila Bend, there's a brand new huge solar farm you could pull over and ogle for a bit. That wears off fast, though, and you'll be back on the road. Past that, you're in for more farm, more desert, and a couple of relatively mild mountain passes.  If you drove a car with excellent handling that demands to be driven (and/or you're coming from the south/east valley), you may find Dead Cow road more enjoyable. (I-10E -> 347 -> 248 -> I-8 -> Yuma) You'll see some railroad tracks, driving through the Sonoran Desert National Park, get some good twisty turns on a two lane highway, and maybe hit a cow at speed. Just sayin.  If you have more time, you can take I-10 West to Quartzsite, and run Highway 95 south into Yuma, getting you a lot of beautiful desert past the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, past the Yuma Proving Grounds (Warning, horse and tank crossings.)  Once in Yuma, you've got the Territorial prison to go check out, historic downtown, a couple of outdoor malls, and I think spring training is over. If you like fast Mexican food, check out Mr G's on 4th Avenue, or Chile Pepper on 24st/Avenue A. If you like slow Mexican food, try Chretin's on 16th St/I-10, or maybe Eduardo's down on Ave B/16th st."

Because every time anyone got a whiff that the tribe was a buyer the price shot up on them.  So they adopted the same exact practice that all real estate developers use.  They shopped through a third party.  It's a perfectly legitimate business practice in commercial property sales and development.  The tribe has been treated like trash by the politicians of this state who are the handmaids of other tribes doing the lion's share of casino business in the valley.  It's positively ridiculous when one considers all the sweetheart deals and tax abatements that have been handed out to the stadium and other developments in the exact same area.

arizona,32mcj0,SmartToaster,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:19:06 2015 UTC,"I will say that it was slightly reckless, however I still feel it was reasonable for the situation at hand.  If you watch the full video of the police cruiser who approaches the victim first (not the one who hit him), you can see that the man not only fires a shot in the air and but puts the gun to his own head - this is all after previously breaking into homes and robbing a store. It could have easily turned into a gun fight or suicide if the cops took another approach.  Also, the other office didn't blindly take off.  If you continue watching the angle from the first cruiser, you can see that another squad car blocks off the other end of the road.  Switching the view to the other squad car you can see that it wasn't as spontaneous of a move as it seems, and considering the dangers of the situation I feel it was a reasonable way to handle subduing the guy."
arizona,32mcj0,i_scatter_rubbish,10,Thu Apr 16 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"That's a ridiculous statement. This guy owning a gun has nothing to do with police taking action against someone who has committed multiple crimes.    Plus, if they had approached on foot, there was a good chance that the suspect would turn his gun on an officer or himself. You have to close the gap and subdue...and non-lethally, preferably. Firing on the subject would subdue...but lethally. With a tazer they would have to get closer and expose themselves to fire from the suspect...which was undue risk to themselves. Therefore, the officer made a snap judgement call and utilized the ""violence of action"". Which works.   There's many types of people in this world. Many types that can make this world better or worse. The police officer that ran that guy down could've killed the suspect, or could have prevented him from running in a house and gunning down 3 people before shooting himself. The officer took the assertive action instead of the reactive one resulting in no more lives lost . Yet people like you are getting their feathers ruffled. Thats okay. You'll forget about this story in a week or two.   Edit: After glancing at your history I'm not sure if you're full troll or not. Oh well, I mean what I said."

I live in AZ and I'm sorry to see this bill signed. I started bringing my own bags with me most of the time and have greatly reduced the number of plastic bags I use. Sooner or later plastic bags will be history.
arizona,32l5bk,artistec,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:22:24 2015 UTC,I hope this is true but the American Chemistry Counsel(ACC) is lobbying hard and spreading money to people to keep plastic bags around.

It's way, way drier than Mich. If your nostrils dry out and crack, use a neti pot. We'e moved back and forth between the mitten and this place a few times, and moving in the summer is cathartic- so hot you feel like you've entered some level of hell, so it makes the winter seem like paradise.  Drink lots of water, tea, lemonade, etc. Invest in good sandals and sunglasses and sunscreen. Park in the shade when possible, don't leave chapstick in the car...   Uh, can't think of anything else offhand. There are a lot of transplants here so it should be easy making friends. Best of luck!"

Can't say for sure on the dry skin issue, but there's lotion readily available.  It's hot in the summer - hotter than you've ever experienced!  But early morning and evenings are still nice.    There's no day lights savings time and it's really weird watching the Red Wings at 4:00pm.  Many employers don't understand why you have to leave work at 3:30 to watch hockey and drink beer.

Arias really brutally murdered a boyfriend, who I believe had broken up with her at the time, I didn't follow it too much but I believe she stabbed him multiple dozen times and shot him (taking pictures of him first when she caught him off guard). No she's not a threat, although it raises awareness of the ""Psycho-ex"" phenomenon.   Also it did happen in 2008, but she was convicted 2013, just now sentenced, I believe she missed getting the shiny needle in her arm by like one or two jurors. That was a ""big deal"" because it was assumed she was sort of a ""Shoe in"" for capital punishment.  I wouldn't consider myself an expert on the situation, but if you have any other questions I'll answer them to the best of my ability.  Here's the wikipedia if you're interested in seeing it."

arizona,32joed,fifty_five,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"Because they're human too. Going through genocide and oppression doesn't magically make you into a good people. The Israeli government are vindictive bigots just like the rest of the Middle-east, and it's so bad that any sort of criticism is often met with thought-terminating cliches or the kind of Zionist apologist nonsense you would expect to hear as a plot in a South Park episode.   I'm completely sympathetic to Holocaust survivors, but the legacy in Israel disgusts me. As a millennial, I can assure the older folks that holocaust deniers/revisionists hail mostly from the older generations. I do want to respect and honor the Holocaust victims, but I would be truly moved if more of these efforts would stop pretending that Israel has nothing to with Holocaust survivors and that Israel's actions aren't a moral affront to the struggle of the European Jews from that era."
arizona,32joed,babyoilz,0,Tue Apr 14 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"...conditions in Palestine can not be compared to conditions in Litzmannstadt or similar.  The Holocaust does not give Israel a blank cheque; but Palestinian leaders have consistently fucked up time after time.  Neither side has considered the other sides perspective.    However, it remains that Israel is essentially a creation of self-interested policies followed by all significant world powers in the last 100 years.  To play the blame game is a waste of time.    Palestinians need to accept that Israel is here to stay.  Israel will not permit itself to be obliterated, and The Holocaust is the reason why Jerusalem will utilize nuclear weapons to defend itself if need be.  The Arab world (especially Tehran) needs to wake the fuck up.  However, Palestine has had a rough road, and amends must be made.  Hopefully some long talks may begin the process of detente.   It is better to jaw jaw than war war   W. Churchill."

One of his tires popped, so he started walking the bike, as quickly as possible. He was stressed about this dog behind him, so he kept looking back, and gradually, in the darkness (there aren't many street lamps out there), the dog was walking on his back legs and grew considerably in height, to the height of a man, and was still following. My friend started running, I'm not sure if he ditched the bike or not, and the thing kept up for a while. My friend said he yelled at it, and in his head he heard, ""I'm not coming for you, yet"", and the thing just stopped following him. My friend ran the rest of the way home. I got chills when he told me the story, and I wanted to ask questions, but I only live a few miles from the res myself and I was riding a bike home, so I didn't want to prolong the conversation, because I've heard the more you talk about them, the more they show themselves."

I usually go early in the morning or later in the evening so I'm not out in the heat of the sun. It's pretty easy to get too focused on your divining rods when you're out there so sometimes you don't even notice when you're about to bump into something.  I was out one evening heading back to the farm I was working for when I saw a kid wandering kind of aimlessly, which was weird cuz we were in the middle of nowhere. I called out to him but he didn't even look around so I thought he might be deaf or just scared and I walked towards him. As I was getting close I heard what I thought was a kid crying. Just when I was getting close to him I saw him dip behind a huge agave, one of the biggest I'd ever seen. When I went around it to grab him all I saw was a coyote disappearing into the darkness of the undergrowth."

When it came near I saw the license plate said ""fresh"" and it had dive in the mirror. If anything I could tell that this can is rare. And the coyote got in and said ""home, to bel air!""

arizona,3261p7,mspk7305,16,Fri Apr 10 21:49:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I read the proposed amendment and can't say that I am coming to the same conclusion as you.   A.  A person acting on behalf of a school district or a person who aids another person acting on behalf of a school district shall not spend or use school district or charter school resources, including the use or expenditure of monies, accounts, credit, facilities, vehicles, postage, telecommunications, computer hardware and software, web pages, personnel, equipment, materials, buildings or any other thing of value of the school district or charter school, for the purpose of influencing the outcomes of elections OR TO ADVOCATE SUPPORT FOR OR OPPOSITION TO PENDING OR PROPOSED LEGISLATION.  C.  An employee of a school district or charter school who is acting as an agent of or working in an official capacity for the school district or charter school may not give pupils written materials to influence the outcome of an election or to advocate support for or opposition to pending or proposed legislation.  F.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as denying the civil and political liberties of any person as guaranteed by the United States and Arizona Constitutions.   There are a lot of horrible laws passed (and even worse ones proposed) by our legislature, but this doesn't seem like one of those, on the surface.  It's saying that a teacher (or other school employee) cannot use district resources to campaign for any particular political cause.  The teacher cannot pass out written materials in class trying to convince the students (parents) of a particular issue.  At no point does it say that the teacher cannot campaign for or against issues on his/her own time.  In fact, it explicitly says that the teacher is absolutely still constitutionally protected to do so.  I'm all for that.  Teachers have a massive amount of influence and I'm not a fan of them pushing their views on the kids.  I know that this doesn't prevent teachers from telling their kids on a regular basis that ""Obama is the devil"" but maybe if they get the idea that pushing political positions is verboten, then they might tone it down.  Maybe my kids will hear that only a couple time a year, rather than pretty darn regularly.  Thing is, if a teacher still wanted to really stress the spending cuts, then it would be a simple matter of telling their class that they're going to do a debate on the subject and assign half the class as ""pro"" and half as ""con"" and have them debate each other.  That's specifically allowed in the amendment as well.  Whatever topic the teacher wanted to stress would certainly be exposed in that kind of setting."
arizona,3261p7,az_liberal_geek,4,Sat Apr 11 00:48:03 2015 UTC,Hold up here. You guys are reading the wrong version. Link at bottom  The major change is this:  C. An employee of a school district or charter school who is acting as an agent of or working in an official capacity for the school district or charter school may not give pupils DISTRIBUTE written OR ELECTRONIC materials  to influence the outcome of an election or to advocate support for or opposition to pending or proposed legislation.   http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/52leg/1r/adopted/1172_ak.pdf

arizona,3261p7,SmartToaster,2,Sat Apr 11 04:53:18 2015 UTC,Acting as an Agent of - can be and often is construed very broadly in law when certain criteria is met.
arizona,3261p7,Flounderasu,2,Sat Apr 11 04:57:39 2015 UTC,"Well I guess that's the key point, here.  As-written, I don't have any serious problems with this amendment.  Your concern is that there is an unwritten subtext that suggests that a teacher campaigning against the cuts ON THEIR OWN TIME could be construed as acting as an agent of the school.  I will concede that this has been known to happen in other state and in other cases.  I also realize that there are more than a few batshit-crazy people in our legislature that would love to silence any opposing view in any way possible.  BUT... no, I don't think that we can connect the dots like that.  We can't say that this bill is suppressing their right to oppose the cuts when the bill says nothing of the sort.  If any suspected unwritten intentions become manifest, then a) it will be front-page news and b) will not be supported by the bill itself."
arizona,3261p7,az_liberal_geek,2,Sat Apr 11 05:09:07 2015 UTC,"I was in complete concurrence with you until I found the Amendment. If they kept the ""to Pupils"" part, I have absolutely no problem with it.   What I'm just saying is, I see OP's concern - now."
arizona,3261p7,Flounderasu,3,Sat Apr 11 05:18:51 2015 UTC,"I would feel the same if they didn't have the direct clause of ""acting as an agent"" in there.  Still, yeah, I know where you're coming from.  It feels supremely surreal for me to be defending any proposed bill from our legislature since normally you just know that they're trying to screw you over some way and it's your job to find out how.  I just don't see that this time."
arizona,3261p7,az_liberal_geek,4,Sat Apr 11 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"On a similar note, is there anything students and teachers can do about the new AZ Merit testing? I've talked to many people about it and they all hate it, myself included. I passed the AIMS and taking another required test is a bit ridiculous. A teacher told me this year's juniors don't need to pass them to graduate so I see no point in taking them at all. Hell, some of the seniors this year get to graduate since they got rid of the requirement that you had to pass your AIMS tests.   I'm also not sure if this is just my school or statewide but I've been hearing that starting next year, a graduation requirement would be passing a civics test.   Education is a mess it seems."
arizona,3261p7,carleyFTW,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"Well, we do need to assume that things will just get worse.

arizona,3261p7,Flounderasu,2,Sat Apr 11 04:48:20 2015 UTC,"I did a big response to this when it came up 2 weeks ago here.  tl;dr it's intended as a state-level extension of the Hatch act to prevent government employees acting in their capacity as government employees from using government money and resources for political campaigning. The language is probably too loose, but the bill is nowhere near as onerous as some have made it out to be.  The misinformation campaign is not doing teachers any favors here."

Its advantage has always been its efficiency, not how clean it is.  It's only been relatively recently that diesel engines have had the technology to reduce their emissions.  The addition of urea in 2008 or so finally started them down the path to being equivalent to gasoline engines.  Most (all?) diesel engines sold now have to meet the same emissions requirements that gasoline engines have to meet.  A 1992 diesel engine won't even come close."

Not a fan of sushi? That's not why I am mentioning it! Sure they have a range of great sushi, but I go there for the Bento Boxes, lunch or dinner. They come with a nice miso soup. The Box itself comes a salad with a great dressing. I am sure you could get ranch, but the house dressing is amazing. A side of white rice. And depending on which one you pick. There is tempura vegatables, califonia rolls, spicy tuna rolls, spring rolls maybe some other sides that I never get. I always get the California and Spicy Tuna sides. But my favorite part is the main portion, teriyaki chicken or steak. I always get the steak. The meat is always juicy and tender, and the sauce is wonderful. Wash it down with an iced green tea, and it is my best meal of the week! I get that for solid meal. My favorite though is Unagi Don, Eel Bowel. It's not very filling, but eel has replaced as my favorite meat!"

That's to cover up things like the lack of smoking they do. (The brisket has zero smoke ring whatsoever -- a very good indicator it spent little if any time in smoke.) They put liquid smoke in the sauce, sauce everything before serving, and it makes it taste like the meat was actually smoked. Without that ring, it wasn't. (Though you can fake the smoke ring by brining a sodium nitrate solution for a couple hours. But then your brisket will taste like the corned beef it was on its way to becoming.)  Little Miss down the road would be a better choice. OP might have to wait an hour or so, though. But then that's a very good sign of good BBQ."

I don't think the color really makes all that much of a difference.   I'd recommend avoiding chrome doorhandles  as I've burned myself on those.   Although I learned to open the doors with a sleeve / piece of clothing.     Good a/c is going to really do the trick.   Leather seats can be uncomfortable when you first get in a car.   Cloth seats are a little more pleasant for initial sitting.   I wonder about sweat absorption and smell.     Get windows heavily tinted.   You can usually get away with something a little darker than legal here as well.   I've gone legal, and illegal and will say it can affect your night time visibility, and heat difference isn't all that noticeable.

arizona,320rki,exprdppprspray,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:40:25 2015 UTC,Tinted windows and a sun shade for the front make a bigger difference than the body color.  Even middle tone cars get too hot to touch.
arizona,320rki,yogetthephone,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:38:38 2015 UTC,I heard this so many times but bought a black car with a black interior and it's no hotter than my wife's white car with a cream interior.  It's not an issue.  Get an auto start ignition and fire it up with the AC blasting 5 minutes before you leave and it makes all the difference in the world. Get what car you want and while you're at buy some black shirts too.

They obviously don't care what their voters think when they loss away the additional tax money that their own voters approved for K-12 Education, lose the lawsuit, and simply take the money back out of the overall education budget. That was a total ""Fuck You""' to their own voters. Why would they give a shit about what anyone who has anything to do with education says?  Oh, wait. I'm totally wrong! I forgot about private education providers/donors. Oops!  And the thing is?   They are absolutely right in doing so. If by 'right' you mean doing what's best for themselves.  They can't lose. Because the people that claim to be 'outraged'? Most of them don't bother to vote.  They have the Sun City blue hairs, and the Tea Partiers. A fraction of the overall population. But those fuckers vote in every election.   Most everyone else just sits on their ass, make excuses as to why they can't/shouldn't vote. And then snivel about the outcome.  And you know what?

But they also sold reusable bags for like $1, and they would give you 5¢ off for each bag filled.  So basically you're saving 10¢ per bag.  I personally loved it.  I don't see why that's a big issue.  They were also insulated like fry's bags, so I could bring home ice cream (walking) in the summer (DC not here obviously) and it just be a little melted, but not ruined in the slightest."

Those plastic bags cost them money and are a pain in the ass.  But one grocery chain  can't just make the decision. If they do, the customers who haven't figured out how much more convenient re-usables are would just go to the competition.   So they wanted the law. I'm a reusable bagger, not because environmentalist, because lazy. I can carry ALL my groceries in on one trip with canvas without worrying about spilling or tearing.

If we bury the bags and oil in the ground, the bags are much better for the environment. It is best we clean up the earth of nasty oil.

At least plants can grow in it while the oil it comes from is environmentally bad and nothing grow in it. Take the Alberta tar sands. What a waste land. Nothing grows there.   If timeframe isn't important than in a 10 million years California will be a mile under the rockies and melted into rock.  As far as being an asshole. I'm not telling you not to use plastics.

arizona,31uik9,post_rock0,5,Wed Apr 8 06:42:58 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoyed our state! If you have any other tips of places you tried for other visitors (or locals) we'd love to hear them.
arizona,31uik9,jmoriarty,2,Wed Apr 8 12:18:08 2015 UTC,I've added some more detail as you suggested. Feel free to add any to your Q&A if you think it's useful.
arizona,31uik9,Uncle_Erik,3,Wed Apr 8 20:50:26 2015 UTC,"First, I am glad you visited Arizona and had a great time here!  When you come back, you might want to go to the southeast corner.  There's much to see and do.  Karchner Caverns are a must (take both tours) and you'll want to visit Tombstone.  It's a little touristy, but then again, it is Tombstone and you must see Boot Hill and the Birdcage.  Then spend the night and a day or two in Bisbee, my favorite city in Arizona.    I do take some exception to this:   It’s hard to find drinks and cereals that don’t contain lots of sugar. You won’t find a chicken shop or chippy. On the other hand all the diners we went to had good food cheap. The Buttery Jack Classic Burger costs about $4 and would cost $10 in Melbourne. Yum.   Yes, there are a lot of sugary drinks.  But you can find bottled water all over or pick up a case at the supermarket.  I usually carry a stainless water bottle and fill it up.  Also, unsweetened iced tea is widely available.  The Buttery Jack Classic burger is, I think, available at Jack In The Box.  Jack In The Box is OK and I eat there now and then.  What you should seek out is our native food - Mexican food.  After all, this state was part of Mexico at one time and Mexican culture runs deep in Arizona.  For about the same price, I can get you a mind-blowingly good burrito.  Many of the best places look sketchy, but serve amazing food.  My secret tip for eating in the US is to grab a police officer.  I know they get a bad rep in the media, but the majority of them are good people.  They have to deal with unpleasant stuff all day long, so they're usually very happy to have someone friendly come up to them and ask about food.  The police always know the best places to eat and they give the best directions to get there.  Ask for restaurants that are not chains or fast food.  That will get you to where the locals eat, and that is almost always excellent.  Mexican food is usually cheap in Arizona and be sure to try things you haven't had before.  There's a good chance you'll make another trip just for the food!  By the way, you can also get excellent Mexican food in southern California, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico itself.  Quality drops off when you get outside of the southwest.  So be sure to take advantage.  I also recommend visiting Mexico.  It is much safer than what you hear, it is inexpensive and the people are amazingly friendly.  I'm taking a short trip down there in an hour or so.  Need to pick up some medicine in Los Algodones and will probably get a haircut and lunch there, too."
arizona,31uik9,mblack1144,2,Wed Apr 8 21:37:13 2015 UTC,"I really want to do the East side of I17, up around Page, and down all around Tucson. And yes Mexico has been recommended to me so hopefully one day. I'm going to start learning some Spanish when I get back. I've no idea how much, if at all, the laid back nature of so many people down in this corner comes from the Mexican influence, but I love it. I've holidayed all over Australia and nowhere has relaxed me more and made me more chilled than this place.     Re the drinks, aside from water (which is what I mostly drink), the same brand labelled drink is often made sweeter over here (e.g. Liptons iced teas) so it's a matter of learning that unsweetened iced tea exists (which we don't get in Australia). And orange juice in hotels all had sugar added, which I'm not used to. So I suppose it's not that it's hard to find, so much as you have to re-learn what drinks taste like. It's a strange psychological thing with international branding where part of your brain is saying something will taste like one thing but it tastes like something else. I did spend a lot of time reading bottles :)    Yes the Mexican food is great. I had beef mole for the first time ever in San Diego - a friend took me to the place he went to with his family as a kid growing up, and also had some chicken mole in Arizona. So delicious. Lots of good Mexican food and the servings are huge and cheap compared to Australian prices. And yes I've already told friends how much I will miss the good stuff.     The burger comment was in reference to the fact that in Australia the latest food craze is ""gourmet"" burgers, and I when I did grab one yesterday from Jack's while we were driving back to LA it was better that most of the gourmet burgers I'd had in Melbourne, so I was really just having a dig at our burgers."
arizona,31uik9,cheald,2,Wed Apr 8 23:08:40 2015 UTC,"Bisbee, must visit Bisbee. I agree with /r/Uncle_Erik it's one of my favorite cities here. Such a small little town nestled in the mountains. Old history, old buildings, antiques galore, good people, good time. This town is worth the trip."
arizona,31uik9,UncleSneakyFingers,2,Mon May 4 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"orange juice in hotels all had sugar added, which I'm not used to   That's rather unusual, for what it's worth, and I suspect it's just hotels stretching their ""orange juice"" with crappy substitutes (like Sunny-D, or some other mostly-corn-syrup abomination). We actually grow oranges out here, and you can get honest-to-goodness fresh squeezed orange juice from local oranges in the late winter and early spring. An orange or grapefruit off the trees in my back yard with my breakfast is one of the most pleasurable parts of spring. :)  There are places where you  can get good coffee, but there are a lot of places that serve pretty crappy stuff. Flavored/sweet ""coffee"" is really big business, though, so lots of places serve mediocre beans on the assumption that the customers are going to drown the taste of the coffee with additives. You can definitely get some really good stuff if you find the right place, though."

If your moving to the PHX area you'll need an emission test every 2 years @$ 27.  Tucson is cheaper emission but im not sure how often. If I remember correctly you'll also need a safety inspection the first time you register.  Some if not all of that can be done at 3rd party DMV offices.

My vehicles are registered in Show Low and not in phoenix. Show Low has no emissions, which is why my civic has 5 year tags.   my 94 honda civic was IIRC $50 for two years, $~175 for 5 years - in 2013 my 05' ram 1500 was ~$120 for a year - in 2014"

arizona,31qolh,RangerBacksFan,3,Tue Apr 7 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"If you're not sure which organization to donate to, please consider Support My Club.    We help high school students across the state get the items they need to participate in after school clubs and sports  - for example, we just had a 3D printer donated for a robotics club and get to deliver it to the students today!    We're in 54 schools and have been able to donate over $70,000 worth of items to AZ students over the past 3 years.  Supporting students in extracurricular activities is important because at-risk students are more likely to graduate if they participate in extracurriculars, and increasing the graduation rate is going to help everyone in AZ!  This is our website www.supportmyclub.org for more info, but to donate today, follow this link.  If you are a high school club or sport sponsor and want to get signed up for the program, go here."

Lots of statistics point to the effects of wealth on a family, not because of the money of course, but because of the behaviours that tend to coincide with wealth.  For example, children who grow up in poor households hear many fewer words growing up, which translates to future performance in school. Perhaps parents should be required to say a certain number of words throughout the day?   Where does it end? There are thousands of decisions a parent makes for their child each day, and every parent can look back hindsight regretfully to at least a few poor decisions. But are children the responsibility of their parents (with all the positive and negative implications) or are they the property of the state? Is ""what's right"" for a child something that should be decided by each family, or has the state become the arbiter of morality? The same state filled with politicians that, as the joke goes, are known to be lying because their lips are moving.  http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/toddler-language-gap-091213.html http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/nyregion/for-poor-schoolchildren-a-poverty-of-words.html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12019/abstract;jsessionid=676E45E2646AD3DA7E9DC9F714551451.f01t02"

But if leasing is not your only option, then buying very frequently becomes a more attractive choice.  At the very core is the fact that the leasing company wants to make a profit off of you for the long term, and so you will always ""earn"" less from then than you would if you owned the panels.  Now if you do own them, there's going to be a break-even period and, yes, you'll have a payment for some years.  At some point, though, the cost of the array will be completely covered by your electric bill savings and then ever bill thereafter is pure profit.  There's never a break-even point when you're leasing.  Also, you might not realize anywhere near the monthly savings you'd expect per month, when leasing.  The CEO of SolarCity has multiple times said that the average leasing customer only saves $5-$10 a month on a solar lease.  After the break-even point when owning, you'll save FAR more than that!"
arizona,314gsd,az_liberal_geek,5,Thu Apr 2 06:00:51 2015 UTC,"I got solar a year ago through Solar City, and my electric bills haven't exceeded $50 a month. Add that to my lease payment of $125, and my bill has never exceeded $175 a month - even though during peak summer use, my costs used to be $350+.   Power generators are trying to de-incentivize the proliferation of solar through surcharge, though the Corporation commission denied a significant portion of that surcharge (other proposals are in the works though).   Overall, I like it. I don't get annual rebates like owners do, but my monthly expenditures have decreased significantly.   Edit: I'm in Tucson. Oh, and during these winter months my bill hasn't exceeded $14."

Im an engineer and I had a project where we had to determine the may off period for solar and with the system we choose under ideal conditions they would pay for themselves in about 6 years.  They also increase the value of your home.  Downsides are the initial investment, and I've heard your insurance can go up too but I've never looked into that.  My dad told me they looked into solar and decided against it because of insurance increases BUT he is pretty much against anything involving green energy so he was probably talking out of his ass.  Its definitely worth investing in IMO."

I'm certainly not against solar panels or leasing, but I think it's good to look at both sides before making a decision.

But solar doesn't cover the entire electric bill (as I understand it), maybe 50%-60% is covered, tack on an extra needless $50 and my bill is basically the same, with a payment to the leading company for the panels on top of that."
arizona,314gsd,RandyTheFool,2,Thu Apr 2 22:07:34 2015 UTC,why is the $50 needless?
arizona,314gsd,ckahr,3,Thu Apr 2 22:15:31 2015 UTC,"I have Vivint Solar panels on my roof.    It's not a lease nor a purchase Didn't cost a penny to get it installed They design the system to ""zero"" your usage with your utility company. The power created by the Solar Panels is dumped directly into the grid, you still pull from the grid. SRP charges ~13-14 cents per KWh. Vivint charges 9 cents. Vivint will, supposedly, reimburse you for any electrical overage. I haven't tested that as I haven't gone over.   The only time Vivint will cost you is if you need the panels temporarily removed for roof work. They charge 500 bucks for that.. it covers the take-down and then the replacement of the panels once the work is done.  The only fuckup they presented was the panels near my AC unit --  they installed them too close. They'll be out soon to rectify that issue."

arizona,3145ae,arizona_lady,4,Wed Apr 1 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, I am in my thirties and I am offended that you labeled us as ""old"", haha. Just kidding!  Instead of finding someone that makes you happy, why don't you just make yourself happy? Your new found inner glow will draw people to you. They will see a confident and attractive woman because that is how you will see yourself. I have gained and lost the same 20 lbs since high school. Sometimes, I feel ok and sometimes it bugs me. But, I'll be damned if I give a crap what other people think about my muffin top. What matters the most is how you feel about yourself.  Are you in any groups or clubs? What are your hobbies? Maybe take a healthy cooking class and find other people that are trying to change their lifestyle as well. If it's a class with a bunch of curvy fun chicks then you have new friends who will take you to new places and introduce you to new people. Maybe let your freak flag fly and join a few BBW sexy groups. Not to find some weird guy who will fetishize your weight, but to find a fun guy who is genuinely attracted to larger woman because they are soft and sweet. Whether it's online or in person, mix it up and find new acquaintances and friends.   Girl, you will figure it out. You are on here posting because you feel something is lacking in your life. The good news is, you can be the one to change it!! Good luck, and quit calling us 30-year-olds ""old""! :)"
arizona,3145ae,kidskitchen,0,Thu Apr 2 02:57:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is - I am happy, and I'm attractive and confident. I've spent the past few years building my life to be where I want it to be (still not there with weight, obviously, but working on it!), and now I'm working on the next part of that - adding a relationship into the mix.  I can see where you're coming from though, I spend the vast majority of my time either at work or at home, and I need to broaden my sphere. I'm not a part of any groups or clubs, my hobbies are your typical reddit recluse hobbies (reading, watching movies, that sort of thing).   Dang it, I think I need to get out there more and maybe not rely on online dating."

Find an activity you can do both outdoors while it's not flesh removal season and indoors while god drys off his nutsack (sounded funny in my head atleast.) that you enjoy doing. Within that activity you usually find a group of friends and it branches from there with regular social interaction. I'm the same way as you and working on getting out more... and mostly failing at it. OKCupid is a pile of shit. Nothing good has come from that website the 5+ years I've been on it. Only reason why i still have an account is because i'm a flagmod on there and I do that sometimes to kill time when I'm bored at work. Anywho back on topic. It sounds like you're making all the right steps you just need to get out more. Albeit that is usually a lot easier said than done but I have a good feeling you have the drive."
arizona,3145ae,CJPi,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"My husband and I met on OKCupid and because we were in opposite sides of the valley at the time we never would have crossed paths otherwise.  Dating in any sphere (online, in bars, in Meetup groups, blind dates through friends) is what you make of it. If you become embittered by your experiences, guess what, you're not going to find happiness because others can sense that on you. No single method is ""shit,"" only your outlook is.  Just giving another perspective. OP should add variety to how she seeks to meet people, not shut herself out based on a few bad experiences or based on angry people's opinions. If I had given up after my first few failed dates..."
arizona,3145ae,Ryshek,2,Sun Apr 5 12:01:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're going about this the wrong way.  If you want to find someone who has a similar interest to you, you should be seeking out places where your interests take place rather than specific people!  If you're interested in firearms, go to shooting ranges and talk to people  If you're interested in exercise, go to gyms and talk to people  If you're interested in continuing your education, go to a community college and pickup a class or 2 and get to know people!  Basically, get out there!  Some of the worst relationships that I've been in and witnessed others in have been ones that people got into out of desperation and loneliness. You should focus on meeting people with similar interests at events where they pursue those interests.  On another note, as for the art of conversation, I highly recommend you have a listen/read to dale carnegie's ""how to win friends and influence people"". It can go a long way towards getting people to open up about themselves and helping you understand who they are and if you even want to get into a relationship with them! It's a long listen, but so worth it."
arizona,3145ae,-_eeeeee_-,1 point,Thu Apr 2 10:12:48 2015 UTC,"Others have said it but I'll say it again. Do things that make you happier (you're happy already you said).   You seem like the 'put-together' type. Losing weight for you probably won't be a huge hassle if you make a plan. It wont take as long as you think it will. Trust me (I know), losing weight will make you really happy and proud. Everything else will start to fall in line.  (Biking did it for me. Low impact and highly effective.)  While you're working on your weight maybe join some kind of social group to start meeting people that have similar interests?"

arizona,314irt,Cf_Red,3,Wed Apr 1 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"Lived in the southwest my whole life, however I have only been to Oregon once and only for a weekend. Used to live in Utah as well, so here's what I recommend:  Drive from Oregon into Idaho through Boise, then take the 15 south through SLC and into southern Utah/Nevada/Arizona. There's not a whole lot to do/see in northern Nevada other than Tahoe. I should note it's not the most scenic drive, if you want that drive Easy through Spokane Washington, through the neck of Idaho into Montana through Missoula, from there go south on the 15. OR you could go south through California and take the pacific coast highway, though I'm not familiar with stuff do do on that route.  If you're outdoorsy, you're going to love Utah/Northern AZ. Stop in Zion, hit up angles landing, Bryce Canyon is also amazing. There are hotels but the camping is to die for, you've never seen so many stars until you're out there!   Go to Las Vegas, NV even if you're not a big gambler or drinker. To save money go during the week, hotel rates are dirt cheap (I've stayed at the Luxor for $33 a night during the week in the summer). From there you can visit the Grand Canyon, take a day trip into Havasupi falls, you can rent mules so you don't even have to hike! Antelope canyon is an amazing place to visit as well, lake Powell will be warming up by then too, so the water will be nice to swim in. Go to flagstaff and enjoy the cool mountain air, maybe even hike Mt. Humphrey's, amazing views from up there.  If you or your wife is into art and that sort of stuff, check out Arcosanti, it's along the I-17 from flagstaff to PHX. Bisbee is a very cool little town in southern AZ, it's roughly a 4 hour drive from Phoenix and there is plenty to do there for a day or two.   Id suggest flying out of sky harbor, the airport in Phoenix, as all major airlines fly out of there and you will get cheaper rates no doubt.   Congratulations! I hope you and your wife have a great trip!  Sorry for any typos or grammatical errors, I'm on my phone."
arizona,314irt,PPKA2757,2,Thu Apr 2 01:11:57 2015 UTC,Thank you! I see a lot of the things we've been interested in seeing so it's good to see others suggest them.

arizona,314irt,PPKA2757,3,Thu Apr 2 13:06:02 2015 UTC,"Vegas is certainly something you should check out, if not for the gambling then just to say you've been there, it's a whole different world. Again, if you want the more scenic route I would take the Montana route, it will tack on at least an extra day of driving but the scenery is amazing. Hands down the most beautiful drive I have ever been on."

Unfortunately, the only thing I personally know of is to present a passport.   They made it illegal for businesses to except vertical ID's, even though they are essentially perfectly fine and even show when someone is no longer under 21.   Maybe someone could inform me why this law was necessary?"
arizona,31418q,sultanrsx,3,Wed Apr 1 23:25:15 2015 UTC,I understand their meaning for doing it...but its still a stupid law. My freakin' military ID is vertical for god's sake.   And OP - looks like you'll be the DD this time.

Arizona law specifically states you cannot purchase alcohol with any vertical ID, regardless of age. So my valid CA drivers licence is not valid here. Which is completely asinine. I was not aware of said law when coming here :(  And no, I did not bring a passport. I'm only here for a week, and considering I'm not leaving the country I did not think it was necessary.   Obviously ive learned my lesson and already renewed my license so that I will have my horizontal one in the mail in Sacramento, but that doesn't help me now :("
arizona,31418q,PPKA2757,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"Some venues will accept out of state licenses specifically for this reason, though not lawfully. They're not stupid and realize that not everyone with a vertical ID is underage and got it from someone else. Since it's for a wedding I don't think you should get too much trouble from the venue, especially if it's being rented out. Though if there is anyway for you to get a passport in time, do it, you'll likely need it in the future anyway. Or you could get your ID flipped, I'm not sure how the process is in CA but if it's as simple as going into the DMV and getting a new one paying a small fee seems worth it to me."
arizona,31418q,PPKA2757,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately since its not an issue in California, renewing or duplicating your ID just primes it to be mailed to you, which takes a few weeks. Even if I could do it in one visit like that, it's an 8 hour round trip to the closest CA DMV, and I'd have to rent a car. :|   I also do have a passport, it's just not with me. Aren't they usually mailed too, though? If I could get a quick reprint or card that actually might solve my problem."
arizona,31418q,PPKA2757,2,Wed Apr 1 22:22:01 2015 UTC,"Passports are mailed yes. It may be in your interest to have someone overnight it to you from California, that could solve your problem."

Big thing is to look for all the seasons and make sure you put in for your big game draws. Game and Fish have all the info you need for that. Bird hunting out here is pretty great for quail and dove, the only thing I know bigger is turkey but I think you need a tag for them (not quite sure).

arizona,30ztwm,Merica1,2,Wed Apr 1 01:28:21 2015 UTC,I honestly thought that was a cowardly way to go about hunting . Set up a feeder and game camera seems like a cheap method to go about it.    In what ways ? Are you supposed to enter a drawing or are there parts you can literally just go to and hunt as you want ?  Edit for autocorrect
arizona,30ztwm,ShadowStatus,4,Wed Apr 1 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Most big game is done through drawings. Sometimes there are left over tags you can buy over counter. Its great hunting here, good luck finding better elk elsewhere. I've never bird hunted but I'm pretty sure there's seasons that you buy permits for. I could be completely wrong about the birds though"
arizona,30ztwm,PNGN,2,Wed Apr 1 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"Azgfd.gov has all of the hunting and fishing info you need.  If you live near one, the Game and Fish offices are also great places to ask questions about the seasons and draws. Basically, big game you need a tag for, small game you typically don't unless it's a migratory bird or waterfowl which require stamps.  I have hunted in AZ since I was 10 and I have loved every second of it. Good glass is paramount for hunting desert deer, especially coues."

Or do I need to befriend somebody  with land to be eligible to hunt as I please ?   My hometown has spots along the llano river that you can go to and hunt as you'd like as long as its in season and you follow the laws ."
arizona,30ztwm,PNGN,5,Wed Apr 1 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"Most hunts are divided into different units in the state and you're only allowed to hunt within that unit. So research which unit sounds best for whatever hunt you do and you put your 3 top choices of hunt (rifle, archery, muzzle loader) for elk or deer or whatever and with what unit you want. If you have a license and a tag you can go on essentially any land in that u it except private land and any possible moments or stuff. I do believe that if you get permission from the land owner you can hunt on their land, if its in your unit. But I don't think that's very common here"
arizona,30ztwm,bobsyouruncletoo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"Hunts are drawn by both location and season.  You will say animal: deer (1 per year per hunter here), then specie: mule deer or coues deer, then time period and unit, each selection has a hunt number, which is all laid out in the hunting regulations on big tables. You put in for your top 5 choices, and your likelihood of getting drawn for your first choice is highest, second and third are next, then 4th and 5th. The number of tags per unit and time period (hunts are usually a week long) is decided by that unit's wildlife manager (game ranger/warden), and the draw success rate is based on the number of tags divided by the number of people who put in for that unit last year.  Things like elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn have low success rates because they are really popular hunts (my dad has been trying for 30 years to get a bighorn sheep tag), and the prime seasons and areas for deer also have low success rates.  Archery is a bit different. Deer is over the counter at any retailer, but there are draws for prime animals/units/hunts for archery. Bear and mountain lion are over the counter (you can buy those at Walmart) but require mandatory reporting. Bear season has nuances you should have explained to you by an Azgfd official.  Small game, yes you can just go to a valid hunting area and have at it. There are seasons for most animals like dove and quail. But some animals like cotton tail and coyote have year round seasons.  Kids under 14 [check that age] only need an accompanying licenses adult to hunt small game, too.   The draw goes: they pull everyone's name in random order out of an imaginary hat (it's a computer program now) and give first choice if they can. If they can't, the ticket goes back in for the next round of draws. The next round they pull everyone's name again randomly and try to give second or third choice. If they can't and those hunts are also full, they do the whole draw again for fourth and fifth choices. (If your second and third are both available when they draw you the second time, you get your second choice.)  Hope that helps."
arizona,30ztwm,uberdroog,5,Wed Apr 1 10:46:36 2015 UTC,Hunting here is pretty good. However there are a few things to know.   Hunting here for big game is a lottery. You need to get the regs and put in months in advance to be lucky and pull a tag. Bird hunting is awesome here. The country that you can cover is great. You missed the elk draw deadline already but deer will be in a couple months.

arizona,30ztwm,PNGN,3,Wed Apr 1 11:06:36 2015 UTC,Small game you don't need tags. Big game you do. I pretty much stick to dove and quail myself. A hunting license with a dove stamp is all you need for that. Season starts in September and goes for a few months. Then again a bit after the new year. 10 a day bag limit on each. Keep a wing attached if you field dress them in case you get stopped by game and fish. Plenty of public lands it here to go hunting.

arizona,30ztwm,RangerBacksFan,2,Wed Apr 1 10:53:00 2015 UTC,There is a lot of good hunting all over the state but it's no walk in the park either. Best thing to do is find area that interests you and go scouting as much as you can this will increase your odds. Also a good method is glassing. Basically mounting the best optics you can afford on a tripod and picking apart the landscape to find animals. Once found you can make a plan of attack. This method works for all big game here but is especially useful for coues whitetail which are very different from the whitetail found in Texas.
arizona,30ztwm,RangerBacksFan,2,Wed Apr 1 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"Fellow Texas native here!  I havent started hunting yet but Im planning on getting into it.  I just graduated so Ive got free time again!  They dont do that deer lease shit we do back in Texas but honestly I like this way better!  Make sure to buy your license and get in the drawing.

Here's a man who followed the law, used deadly force because he was being attacked by a criminal and now he will forever be labeled a racist because some people decided he executed Michael Brown.  He wasn't a racist, he was a cop doing his job.  Now his career is ruined because of public outrage.  Imagine the headlines if the media ever finds out he get a job on another police force...  Its gonna be crazy.    BUT if the smartest, most educated, and best policemen who raise through the ranks think this is a bad deal, then who am I to argue?    I have employees under me, sometimes what they want isn't realistic when you think about it from the administration side."

Make sure yours are spinning the right way for summer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rGnTcsi11o).  Also, make sure they are balanced so you can turn them up to high w/o fear that it will detach from the ceiling.  Mind your electronics.  Got a receiver for home theater?  It's full of heatsinks.  Don't let it run for no reason.  Are you a member of /r/pcmasterrace? Tone down that OC and enjoy a more cinematic experience w/a lower FPS.  Don't put super hot items into your fridge, let them cool on the counter then move the into the fridge. Don't bake cookies at 3pm in June.  Mind your moisture.  AC does two things; remove heat and remove moisture.  The more moisture you put into your apartment, the harder the AC has to work.  Don't get massive hot showers, keep boiling pasta to a minimum, etc.  Unfortunately, you're in an apartment so you can't plant some shading  bushes next to your house, but when you move into a home, I highly suggest it."

If you have sliding doors to a balcony, get light blocking curtains. You can also buy tinted window film for your other windows-it will block the uv Rays, keeping heat out. It also will help if your lease has a clause saying window coverings can only be a certain color, since some window films are still see through. If you have a balcony, check your lease if you are allowed to have anything higher than the balcony wall. Setting up a table with tall fake plants can block some of the light."

arizona,30pine,Unclegonzo,8,Sun Mar 29 16:03:20 2015 UTC,"The Arizona Police Association strongly supports the measure, in part because its members are afraid that protesters will march in front of the homes of officers who shoot unarmed civilians.   First of all, they already withhold all personal information about officers involved in these shootings.   Second, I know the vast majority of officers aren't going around shooting unarmed civilians, but when it does happen, why make a public institution less transparent.   If an innocent person shot an officer in self defense because the police were conducting a home invasion on faulty evidence (which seems to happen regularly in this country) that homeowner goes to jail, or is killed, and in either case, their name goes public.   Let's cool it on government officials shooting civilians without all the evidence, and maybe the civilians won't have to protest.  My main problem is this vilifies people protesting violence and lack of transparency"
arizona,30pine,drDekaywood,-1,Sun Mar 29 20:30:53 2015 UTC,"Let's cool it on government officials shooting civilians without all the evidence, and maybe the civilians won't have to protest.   Typically it's not cops shooting civilians ""without all the evidence."" It's civilians rioting and threatening violence without all the evidence. Keeping the name of the officer hidden for 60 days seems reasonable under those circumstances. Everything else about the officer--the incident, his service record, etc--is still public. Only his name is redacted and only for 60 days.   Finally, why don't you hit the street and try making a life or death decision in milliseconds with only the facts as you know them in that particular moment? If you feel comfortable waiting for a guy to pull out whatever he's got stuff into his waistband so that you personally can be 100% certain its a box of pills and not a gun then that's your call, your life that you are risking. Typically if it's a weapon and you've given them time to draw it, it's already over for you anyway unless they're a shit shot (in which case they miss you and possibly hit someone else). It's not for us to tell another person ""oh you should've waited till it cleared his clothing"" because it doesn't take that long for someone to shoot you dead."

Please step down from your high horse and join the rest of us who live on planet earth.
arizona,30rgg9,Derino,2,Mon Mar 30 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"How about letting the snake escape if you come across it? Wild snakes will do a while lot to AVOID human encounters anyways! If I walked out the front door onto my driveway one morning and found a big ol' eastern diamondback rattlesnake chilling just a few meters away, I wouldn't even be scared. I'd nonchalantly walk right by it, or out the back door if it were right next to it. There's virtually zero risk at all of getting bit if you don't deliberately make it angry, and it's not like it's gonna want to keep coming back.  About the ""think about the CHIIIILLLLDREN therefore kill snakes/hots"" argument, just teach them not to fear snakes at an early age, while at the same time tell them not to get near any wild snake until they're older/can decipher between a harmless snake and a hot.  Just because a snake is born with fangs does not automatically make it guilty enough to deserve to die. If it's already in the woods, leave it be. No exceptions. If it's in a residential area, either call a reptile removal service or get a snake hook to direct the hot away from where you perceive it to be dangerous. Often you won't even use it anyways because they often run away when humans get close, depending on the hot.  Bugs aren't even comparable to snakes in that bugs are pests that invade homes in vast numbers, while snakes are not pests because they never do this, unless maybe you're way up north in Canada and a bunch of harmless garter snakes mistake your house for a limestone den, and even that's a hypothetical.  There are very few occasions when killing snakes is ever justified. They control disease-carrying rodent populations, and aren't all that intentionally intrusive. Killing a snake just because it's also a hot is the wrong reason to kill a snake. Please stop doing this."

Between a lot of spots getting shut down (with posted ""no shooting"" signs) and the amount of people out there, I had to drive around for about half an hour taking my 2wd SUV to places that I probably shouldn't have been able to get out of for a shooting  spot that was just okay. And that was at 9am on a weekday!  I also used to go shooting out west on the 10 past the old abandoned dog track. I think it was Warner rd or Miller rd. There's a truck stop there with a red and green digital sign, and you take a right at that exit and follow that road a ways back for some decent shooting spots. It's popular too, but more spots are available than at Table Mesa."

Understanding and fighting the monopoly that your municipality (and govt in general) holds over rights of way and many other things, will speed the process of voter pressure coming to bear on this issue, allowing real competition and also concessions being made in the short term to help out existing competition.  Unfortunately, most Americans have bought into the myth of natural monopolies and other economic fallacies which the (wouldn't you know it) state monopoly on schooling teaches them.  Largely because of this belief, most people have turned to government itself to put a bandaid on the problem (the symptoms of the lack of competition) which they themselves created (i.e. the whole net neutrality thing and reclassifying broadband providers as title II utilities).....instead of demanding that government remove barriers to competition.  Unfortunately most people in our society are mis-educated on economics and fairly short-sighted, and so tend to beg for government interventions in order to solve problems which were caused by an earlier, primary intervention."

And I don't know -- I've been told that older modems on the network do cause problems so it's in the ISP's interests to get customers upgraded. Most of this info can be found in Google, like so:  http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cable-modem/  I hardly check my mail and am guilty of tossing things that look like junk. I pay my Cox bill online so I assume everything they mail me is trash. Maybe I'm the exception."

They run audits and if your modem is ageing and falling out of compatibility with the broadband technology they will notify you to upgrade. Obviously you don't have to buy from Cox and usually you are fine for awhile. However, the technology does evolve (like how we've gone from DOCSIS 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 etc) and eventually the older tech won't work so well and you won't have access to your max speeds. Think of it like having an old tube TV versus a new flat panel. You can still watch TV on the tube but the experience will be inferior.   Instead of people freaking out about ads I would think getting this notice would be appreciated. The alternative is not letting you know and you just getting that crappy connection."

So we were rather surprised when it happened. He said that he approached us because that particular site was so close to the water plant (I think that's what's up there.) He routinely checks to make sure everyone's weapons are legit. We had 2 handguns, 2 rifles, and 2 shotguns we had taken up there. He got them one by one and took them to his truck and reported the serial numbers on each one to the ATF. the whole process took like  less than 20 minutes."

If you want to test it, just tell TSA you lost your license next time you fly. You will get asked for whatever other forms of ID you do have like an insurance card, and you may be screened more heavily. Inter-state travel is a constitutionally protected right, which is not dependent on producing ""documents please"", with a long history of being upheld by the Supreme Court."

arizona,300gys,cipher_six,2,Mon Mar 23 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"Current US Code addresses air travel specifically. In 49 U.S.C. § 40103, ""Sovereignty and use of airspace"", the Code specifies that ""A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace.""   It is important to note that being a citizen of the US is the required status, not the presentation of a specific state's ID card. The supreme court has allowed restrictions to travel due to criminal matters, non-payment of child support, and the No-Fly list (which is still being debated last I heard). Ordinary citizens with no criminal record or no-fly status cannot be prevented from interstate travel, as a constitutional right.  How does TSA/REAL-ID reflect that fact:  http://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs ""TSA currently accepts other forms of identity documents such as a passport or Permanent Residency Card and will continue to do so.  For more information on acceptable forms of identification for boarding aircraft, please see TSA’s website (http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids)""  If you follow the second link, you'll find a lot of things are acceptable for boarding a plane, including ""airport issued ID"", which if you google that, is a TSA form called a ""TSL 44"", which is issued by the TSA if you don't have ID but allow them to search you well. In practice, TSA accepts a lot of other things as ID, including a Costco card. The freedom to travel between states is granted by your citizenship, not your possession of a specific card.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law  TLDR; Arguably, the TSA and other parts of the government would like you to believe they can limit your rights in any way they like for any reason, but that isn't true.  Parroting ""we must conform"" does all citizens a disservice."
arizona,300gys,lmaccaro,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"http://www.tsa.gov/contact-us   Q.  If I lose my ID during travel, what secondary forms of ID will be accepted?  A.  Passengers who do not have a valid photo ID, such as State-issued driver’s license, should bring any ID or documents they have available to assist in verification of identity.  Passengers need at least two alternate forms of identification, such as a social security card, birth certificate, marriage license, or credit card. The documents must bear the name of the passenger. Also, one of these documents must bear identification information containing one of the following: photo, address, phone number, social security number, or date of birth. If TSA can confirm the passenger’s identity, they may enter the secured area, but they could be subject to additional screening. For more information, please review the ID Requirements for Airport Checkpoints.   So if you have a credit/debit card and social security card they'll let you on.  Seriously I lost my ID in North Carolina back in '08 the day before I had to fly to DC.  You know what I used? My Voter Registration card and debit card.  Those are both valid things.  I'm sick and tired of this ""OMG AZ DRIVERS LICENSE WILL BE INVALID""  I could get on a plane tomorrow with documents that 96% of people have in their house NOT including their DL/ID."

I hit the trifecta for the most politically corrupt states: California, Minnesota, and now here in Arizona. ANY time funding is cut to public schools-ESPECIALLY post-secondary education- in lieu of tax raises, the policy is corrupt, and these old guys and gals have their heads in their asses by doing this.   I am planning to attend a major university's Teacher's School (yes, to be a teacher of science at the middle school level....don't get me started there). They want to give me a $10,000 stipend in my senior year for going through their rigorous teachers program. I wanted to possibly wait a year to take some physics courses at the CC so I can add Physics on to my education degree and teach at the high school level, but I don't know if it will be there next year, due to these cuts.   It is the school that is giving me that money, and it is essentially a grant that pays about one year's tuition and fees. The school gets a boatload of funding from the state, and since they are a small-market Division I school (unlike Kentucky, for instance), they don't get the funding from many other sources that will . So, I must proceed with the degree I intend to get, and since it has a ceiling as far as where I can teach, I will have to go back for my physics certification if I want to teach high school.   I didn't vote this year because I don't have the time to read up on whatever bullshit the candidates want to put out. Mitt Romney kinda pushed me over the edge with his ""I've got binders"" spew. It was the epitome of the state of things. I do find it funny, though, that as Obama is making all these social programs to help student succeed at life, Arizona is trying to get the California companies to flock in here and are pretty much just hush-hush about how the poorest students in the nation are being subdued...  This was for Fiscal Year 09-10 and 10-11, but it pretty much accentuates the fact that the people running this state are voted in by the gun-toting republicans that value their assets and not their community.

The rule of law protects citizens from mob rule. Nobody should get locked up absent legal justification just because angry (and probably ignorant) mobs demand it.  This is in reaction to the mob violence that has become commonplace any time a police officer is perceived to be in the wrong. The unrest and violence and the danger is not only to the officer but also to his family and community at large. The fact that the media and race hustlers will--absent any evidence beyond race of cop vs suspect--create a story of racism and whip up hate and violence is incredibly unhelpful.  Edit: Oh look. The angry mob is out with their downvoting of rational opinions."
arizona,2zyar5,cipher_six,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:09:40 2015 UTC,"You are putting words into my mouth. I never said anything about not locking up cops accused of wrongdoing. The accusations must come from law-enforcement, not a lynch mob. You mention a homeowner defending his property - if the police show up and they don't have evidence at the scene to take that homeowner to jail to be charged with a crime, they don't do it. You talk like every time a self-defense shooting happens, the victim goes to jail when that is absolutely not the case.  As it stands, any time a cop uses his weapon he gets investigated as a matter of course. Are you advocating that every time that happens--again, absent evidence/legal justification--the cop should automatically go to jail (and into the inmate population) pending completion of the investigation, as if he is automatically presumed guilty of some wrong-doing? What cop would want to work under those conditions?  This law doesn't suppress the cop's name indefinitely. It's 60 days. Long enough for investigations to be had and heads to cool, if needed. I don't see a problem with that in the context of current events."
arizona,2zyar5,cipher_six,3,Mon Mar 23 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"This is surely what we need - even less accountability for the government.  interesting point from the article:   After former Phoenix Police Chief Daniel Garcia released the name of the police officer who fatally shot Rumain Brisbon, an unarmed black man, in December, there were fears that protesters would march on the officer's home.    Nice example of how citizens versus cops are treated in the media. Months after that occurred, the article still refuses to mention the cops name. For reference, it was Mark Rine who sought fit to kill someone for having marijuana.   None ever did so, but Bolton said it ""sent a chill factor up and down our thought process.""    What the fuck does that even mean? It's like this moron ran out of meaningless tropes half-way through his sentence."

arizona,2zkvtd,Flounderasu,7,Thu Mar 19 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"Uhm, this is exactly states rights. Do also know that a conservative stance is one of lesser government regulation, which this legislation also exemplifies as the ordinance which is considered being passed is preventing access to something while the legislature is preventing the prevention, essentially ensuring freedom of access. Also third, why should a city mandate what you can and can't use for your shopping needs, especially when it's actually been proven that in order for reusable bags to actually do good for the environment, they would need to be used nearly a hundred times. Which almost never happens. I would think reddit liberals would be all over the idea of using plastic bags considering they extremely tiny ecological footprint as compared to the alternatives, I guess just not in cases where they can needlessly attack the opposition."

I reuse the bags in other ways anyway: trash can liners, dog poo picker-uppers, automobile trash receptacles, Goodwill donation transporters, etc etc. Banning them means I have to buy other things to replace them.

Or we could just ban these things and get people using cloth bags.  Naaah! I know! Let's just keep throwing these things into our environment and feel like sad pandas that we're destroying the environment but it can't be helped because we don't want to have to remember to grab the grocery bags before we go shopping...

If you are a street or cruiser rider there are many events in Phoenix. If you are a ADV rider like myself you will find groups that do trips ranging from hours to days. Additionally having a dual sport is the perfect bike for Arizona as the outback is always less than 30mins, no matter where you live.  Some negatives. Obviously if a bike is your only ride your going to hate it, heat and monsoons. You stated your a student such as myself, one thing I hate is carrying my gear around. So depending on what/if you wear, it can be a pain. I recommend purchasing lockable boxes/saddle bags and an evaporative cooling vest. Furthermore as stated by others, though this depends where you live, even though there are a lot of riders here people still try to kill you. I remember reading a statistic that Arizona has some of the worst drivers in the US. All in all, its amazing and you will enjoy the smooth roads, windy roads, the scenery, and the camaraderie among riders (except scooters, fuck them).   If you have more questions I believe you will receive better responses on /r/motorcycle."

Summer riding is actual hell. It's 115, there is no shade, and the asphalt is even hotter—it can get up to 140. Sitting on your bike in traffic is unbearable. Wearing a proper jacket is almost impossible. Your helmet gets drenched.   So I view it as just like anywhere else: there's a riding season, it's just the opposite time of year."

arizona,2znysn,autowikibot,0,Fri Mar 20 07:31:18 2015 UTC,I never said anything about race so where the hell you got that from is beyond me. In a lot of states including Texas you don't have to renew your id until 6 years after the first renewal. But my friend who's with me that immigrated from Germany who has a green card(and a vertical license) can. That's some governmental intrusion bullshit. My ID meets the national standards given to by the Real ID Act signed in 2005 but the state of Arizona says no?  That's in violation of article 6 of the United States constitution. So tell me again how i don't have the right to be frustrated about this?

It's really pretty and worth a drive through but I would camp below the rim.  There is ""That Brewery"" in Pine AZ that has good beers and Tonto Natural Bridge has some trails down under the bridge.  In Sedona, I would hit North Wilson Mountain trail and West Fork (along with Boynton.)  Oak Creek Brewery is good - there is a main bar in town, and the brewery is a bit outside of town.  You could also go through Cottonwood/ Jerome area.  There are some micro brews in that area, and Sycamore Canyon is a good hike this time of year.  I would try and do at least one desert hike to as this is wild flower season and we have some spectacular hikes in metro PHX.  www.hikearizona.com is a good resource for hike descriptions.

arizona,2z9aud,delapatriot,2,Mon Mar 16 18:23:31 2015 UTC,Just to mention for those who saw the title and didn't read the article - this is not about the 18 cent a gallon state gas tax but about a 1 cent gas tax for underground tank cleanup (a tax a lot of people didn't know about.)
arizona,2z9aud,sunburn_on_the_brain,2,Mon Mar 16 18:29:11 2015 UTC,I have to wonder how much of that tax ended up getting shifted into the general fund as loans that the legislature forgives long after people have forgotten about it.  Cig tax comes to mind.  They rob that regularly.
arizona,2z9aud,rit100,2,Mon Mar 16 22:21:45 2015 UTC,The legislature will sweep any funds they can. They've been sweeping gas tax funds for a while and the cities and counties have been fuming over it.
arizona,2z9aud,sunburn_on_the_brain,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:44:22 2015 UTC,And why was this a tax to begin with?  Shouldn't the stations be responsible for this?

arizona,2z7awd,Permapaul,5,Mon Mar 16 13:17:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! Arizona is a great place to live, it really is beautiful!  I'm from California, and experienced the same feeling you did when I visited. So I moved!  I don't regret it, it's been a great experience living here but I realize now that part of the reason it was so appealing and wonderful was because I visited on vacation time.  Living here I see that there's asshats and kind people. My life is just as stressful, I haven't found meaning or a calling and I've spent time in the desert ;)  Living in Arizona has its breathtaking moments and moments where I go wtf was I thinking coming to this place!  I'm not used to the...wild life here. The first month or so was scary, I wouldn't go outside after dark, but I've adjusted. If you have pets consider getting them trained to avoid rattle snakes, and be sure that you'll be able to keep them inside at night. I'm sure that's dependant on where you live but in the foothills where I live we see rattlesnakes, javelina, tarantula, and even a bobcat!  My vets told me there's also so a type of toad that your dog can lick to get high. So keep your eyes open for that. :p  I'd say come when it's hot! I lived in Redding, so the dry heat here has been a relief actually! Monsoon season is my favorite time of year, I love how quickly everything gets stormy and clear again...my car doesn't. :p Be very careful driving during those times!  Labor laws/wages are different and it is an open carry state, so research because the laws here are vastly different from California. As a worker you will not have as many rights, that's something I wish I would've looked into more before I moved.  Overall, make sure you're moving for the right reasons. I wouldn't advise against moving here just come informed!  Good luck :)"
arizona,2z7awd,camimiele,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:25:30 2015 UTC,"I am going to look into the labor laws/ wages thing, but would you mind giving me an idea about how it is different from anywhere else?"
arizona,2z7awd,TheseChainsAreHeavy,2,Mon Mar 23 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"Well moving from California the thing that struck me the most was the wage. In California I was making $9/plus tips. Here it is $5/hour plus tips.  Legally they're supposed to make up the difference but...  Untipped wage is 7.90 I think.  It's a right to work state so you, as an employee, have the right to leave your job at any time, without notice or reason.  Your employer can also fire you at any time, without reason or notice.   There's no such thing as required  breaks here as far as I've experienced, although that varies through companies. Overtime is only given after you've worked 40 hours in a week, in Cali it was if you worked over 8 hours during one shift.   So basically moving from California to here as a tipped worker I lost all of my rights, breaks and half my wages.   I've also had a bunch of bumps getting approved as an in state student, so I'll be moving back to California next year.  This is all as far as I know if anyone sees anything that's incorrect feel free to say something I'd hate to spread misinformation."
arizona,2z7awd,camimiele,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying. I live in NY and we also have to have breaks if we work 8 hour shifts.  The way some places out here have done it is you get a 10 min break 45 min lunch and 15 min break. Others would do just an hour break but they gets pissed if you work straight through.  Wages, I figured it'd be different, but the cost of living is supposed to be cheaper too. I like how much I make now... idk if I could handle a pay cut, even if things are cheaper.  That's messed up that you can just be dropped from your job... though if you can just walk off it would make sense.   I'm definitely gonna read up on their laws. Thanks a lot for the heads up."
arizona,2z7awd,TheseChainsAreHeavy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"I looked it up and Arizona laws require no breaks regardless of the hours worked.  Honestly, the cost of living is a little cheaper but not enough to make up for the pay cut. I was living much easier in California even if it was more ""expensive"".  Rent is cheaper here, although not by much. I was living up north in California so maybe that's why I broke even there. The cost of food/utilities/necessities is about even.  Overall, I can definitely feel the lower wage even though the cost of living is supposed to be cheaper."
arizona,2z7awd,camimiele,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the info. I'm definitely gonna look into it some more. I found this so I think I'd still be ok, though I don't know how viable this info is.   http://www.areavibes.com/cost-of-living-calculator/tempe,+az-vs-islip,+ny/"

Any local will tell you that the main hwy is horrible and just a major stress inducer.  Also, if you can afford it, Prescott is a little bit nicer and has plots of land up closer to the mountains that are worth it. Prescott Valley seems to be more of the younger, transitional families while Prescott is more retirement based.  Coming from someone who lived in Cali and moved to Prescott Valley, please spend a bit more time in the area before making the decision to move. Vacations make you see things a whole lot differently. Plus, Arizona has a lot more worth while areas to check out that might outrank Prescott Valley. To each their own, though."
arizona,2z7awd,jhartsfi,3,Mon Mar 16 05:38:57 2015 UTC,"You are talking about Hwy 69 on the South side of Prescott Valley. You should avoid Hwy 69 past Fain road during all hours of the day. Its a mess of traffic lights and moronic drivers.  Hwy 89A on the North side of PV is a breeze during rush hour. I take it every day.  That being said, between military and school, I have lived in a few different states including CA and I absolutely love Prescott Valley. Admittedly, we lucked into a bit of land North of Hwy 89A.

You've got to remember that shopping needs to be done before or after the first few days of each month (cities like Kingman have ""mountain men"" that raid walmart during that time).

arizona,2z7awd,austinmiles,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"I have lived here in Arizona for over 25 years. I was an army brat growing up so lived everywhere, but my last stop was the northeast so I met my wife who is a native New Englader. There are a number of comments made so let me try and address as many as I can.  First was the cost of living comments. Given that CA is a huge state and so is AZ, it really depends on what you are trying to compare. If you are looking at the similarities between the larger cities (LA, SD, the bay area), greater Phoenix is far less expensive a place to live. If not, then so many companies would not be moving such a large percentage of their operations and personnel here. Yes for some types of work, incomes generally are slightly lower. That is more than made up in ongoing living expenses, especially mortgages. Now if you are talking about the more outer lying areas, the cost of living is going to be similar between the two states. The difference is if you are looking to live in Prescott Valley and commute into Phoenix. That is very rural living commuting to a major city. In CA, that would come with a much higher cost than here. Which comes to the second major point which is traffic. If you are choosing Prescott Valley and plan on commuting to Phoenix everyday, then yes I17 traffic will be slow. But it is no worse than commuting to any of the major cities within CA. Locally in Prescott though, to someone who lives in the valley, it does not seem like there is traffic at all in town except when the tourists invade. Like anything CA, I think you will want to choose the kind of lifestyle you want to lead. If you to live in the mountains and still be in a long distance type commute to Phoenix, then the Prescott Valley or near Payson fits. There you will living among the Ponderosa Pines. The weather will be cooler year round as you are at altitude and will get occasional snow. If it is just space you want, there are many areas both on the outskirts and within the valley that still come with some acreage. Within the valley you can choose from mountain living, to golf course, to desert, to quiet neighborhoods you name it. Hope this was helpful. I do work in real estate so if there is anything I can do to assist in your search just let me know @ cstevens@az-usrealestate.com. I also have a blog that talks a lot about the area which is az-usrealestate.com"

As far as food goes, I'd personally just get some super nachos or a carne asada burrito from Il Potosino or Los Betos, but that's just because I've been craving that since I left Tucson.

The first two aren't anything really local. Low-quality chains (LosBetos in particular). El Guero and BK are both far better than either.   If you're on Congress in Tucson, I suggest getting a drink at both Hotel Congress and Iguana Cafe. They're close to one another and both two very different tastes of real authentic Tucson.  La Cocina is also within easy walking distance and has a great outdoor bar and restaurant.  Other great places in random order: Cafe Poca Cosa, Mi Nidito, Eegee's, Beyond Bread, Borderlands Brewing, El Continental, Taqueria Pico de Gallo, Penca, Proper, Seis, Cushing Street, El Sur, El Nene, 5 Points, Agustin Kitchen, Las Brasas, and Rosa's. There are tons more, but any of those will give you a good idea of our little city's cuisine.  It's hard to go wrong with any of the food Downtown or on 4th Avenue (North and South 4th!).

Desert Museum is a another ""must-see"", same caveats as above.   In Sedona, make a day trip to Jerome.  You're better off staying in Cottonwood or Flagstaff to avoid the outrageous hotel bill in Sedona proper.  Oak Creek has excellent hiking, great for a picnic as well. Plenty of museums and shopping.  Visit the Chapel of the Cross in Sedona for amazing views.  Consider doing the Grand Canyon Railway train from Williams to the Canyon.  Take Coach up and a better class on the way back (they serve booze in the afternoon).  Don't do the bus tours or an overnight, the three hour layover is more than enough to get your fill of the canyon.  A helicopter tour at the Canyon is amazing if you can afford it.

That's where they store lots of aircraft and it's a must-see.  Tucson's Titan Missile Museum is another must-see; you get to tour an old missile silo.  Very cool.  Jerome is another must-see, though you might want to think about spending the night at the Jerome Grand.  It's an old hospital converted into a hotel and a wonderful place to stay.  The hotel's restaurant, the Asylum, is very good.  I also like the Haunted Hamburger in Jerome.  If you head west from Tucson through Phoenix, head north from Phoenix and drop by Arcosanti.  It is a very interesting little community and well worth visiting.  They also have cheap rooms if you want to stay there."

arizona,2z5a5v,AngerSwines,4,Mon Mar 16 00:00:46 2015 UTC,As far as Tucson goes Nimbus is the local craft beer. I went to the brewery for lunch one day and had a nice pub meal and a few delicious drafts. My favorite spot in Tucson is Mount Lemmon hands down. The drive to the top is breathtaking to say the least. When you drive north to phoenix make sure you admire Picacho Peak it was the western most battle of the civil war. Casa Grande National Monument is worth the stop as well in between Phx and Tucson.
arizona,2z5a5v,grabberblu,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:56:34 2015 UTC,Perfect! Exactly This. So you can take your car to the very top? I definitely want to check out civil war historic areas. Thanks for sharing and if you come up with some more ideas for us.
arizona,2z5a5v,Twilight_Flopple,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:01:12 2015 UTC,You can drive to the top of mount lemmon and it is like driving from mexico to canada in 20 miles. Picacho Peak is a state park and is awesome to hike if you have any interests. From the top you will be able to view the pinal airpark which was a runway owned by the CIA during the vietnam war.

Two Brothers Brewery, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers (name of the place), Brat Haus, Union Barrelhouse...a lot of great options right near your hotel."
arizona,2z12gz,scottsusername,5,Sat Mar 14 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Phoenix is laid out on a grid, so it's fairly easy to navigate. However, in Phoenix streets running North to South that are West of Central Ave. are called avenues (1st ave., etc.) while those East of Central Ave are called streets (1st st., etc.). This can be confusing because when you ask someone where something is people have a tendency to say something like Van Buren and 52nd which could send you way the hell over to the wrong side of town if you don't know which 52nd.  It's going to be fucking hot in June, at least in the low country. I'm sure you're aware of this, but it bears repeating because it is fucking sweltering. Bring plenty of water, park in the shade, and seriously consider bringing gloves because if you leave your car and come back half an hour later there is a strong chance the steering wheel will be legitimately painful to touch. But the Grand Canyon area should be around 23.8 - 29.4 degrees celsius.  Arizona is extremely sunny, so pack plenty of sun screen. With that said, June is monsoon season. It can be sunny all day and rain several inches as soon as the sun starts going down. Being British, you'll be used to rain, but when it storms in Phoenix it has a tendency to come down hard. Dust storms are a distinct possibility.  As far as food goes, I highly recommend stopping by at a Filibertos. They're all over the valley, and there's one in Scottsdale. It's a Mexican fast food place with fairly low prices. Certainly not Taco Bell cheap, but with the extra few dollars you spend the improvement in quality is astounding. Portion sizes are gigantic, in the American tradition. You will be blown away by how little you spend on a great meal there. If they did away with the fast food gimmick and became a sit down restaurant people would not think it outlandish for them to charge twice as much as they do. The food is fucking legit, and it's open 24 hours. I highly recommend the Chile Relleno burrito. The quesadillas are lackluster, though. However, they do not serve beer.  As far as beer goes, 4 Peaks Brewery is pretty much just across the Salt River from Scottsdale. They serve food as well, but I've never eaten there so I can't speak for it's quality. 4 Peaks beer is fantastic, local craft beer. It's seriously good. Drink some and then go back to England and tell everyone how remarkably unshitty American beer really is. If you travel all the way to America to drink budweiser then you have failed as a traveler and a human being.   The change in elevation between the valley and the canyon is large, so bring some gum or something to pop your ears.  There are some trails on the rim of the Grand Canyon you could hike in a few hours with regular old sneakers. The Grand Canyon is an impressive sight, so if you've never been you will likely find yourself wanting to stare at it for a lengthy time.  Enjoy your time in the states!"

Why hasn't anyone dispensed the proper advice about flash floods, not driving through washes, and what to do if caught in a dust storm?  Flash floods: self-explanatory.  Washes: don't drive through them; the water is probably moving much faster and is much deeper than it looks. If you drive around a barricade and get stuck, you will get charged for your own rescue under the Arizona Stupid Motorist Law.  Dust storm: they come on suddenly and without warning; if you get caught and can't see where you're going, pull off the road as far as is safe, turn off all of your headlights, and take your foot off of your brake pedal. The latter is to keep other drivers from seeing your tail-lights, mistaking you being on the road, and then plowing into you."

They've more recently received national acclaim but they've been a local staple for years now. The most popular location is in Tempe where they started their small scale operation, but there are locations in Scottsdale and even Sky Harbor Airport!  They have a wide range of brews on tap and it's hard to go wrong with any of them, but I would recommend their Hefeweizen or their most popular, ""Kiltlifter"" Scottish-style ale.   For food, they also have a variety of styles ranging from sandwiches and bar food to impressive specialty dishes. My favorite item, however, is their Salmon BLT.

I called them and told them that this is not okay because they do not have a plan that can support the amount of data I use and to remove the limit and warning from my account.  I've been good, but stopped focusing on my overages as each day I use at the minimum 10GB of data (largely to Netflix).  The most I have used in a month is a little over 1TB of data, but I have not noticed any throttling yet.  If anything, they might make you subscribe to their ""Ultimate"" service (I have preferred plus or something along those lines 100Mb up/20Mb down which is more than I need and haven't upgraded to Ultimate).  I imagine YMMV but depending on the area, Cox will generally give you faster speeds than Century Link ever could.  Sometimes you'll have to call the ISP to see if they offer better speeds (Century Link for the longest time only offered 5Mb as the highest speed available to me on their website, when I called in they said they could get 12Mb to me which is better but still a joke).  Cox has worked extremely well for my needs and I have very little complaints other than they are pricey ($75 for 100/25 internet only).      That being said, those are the only real players in the area.  Other than that you have Hughesnet satellite internet at 1.5Mb.  The service you listed offering 400GB cap is most likely Cox Ultimate which should be good enough.  I think the only other solution is to go to Cox Business internet if they end up throttling you going over the cap, but I'd stick it out with home tier internet until then.

The woman I spoke to on the phone today (Mar 30 2015) from the website (who also said no reservations until November) was clearly extremely tired of saying that there is no way for me to see the falls, since there are no reservations.  That was all she said.  Actually she was extremely tired of saying anything helpful at all....  I also cannot find out any information about a day hike, whether it is possible to just show up and simply hike to the falls, and back out in one day, without camping.  I've done an 8mi round-trip day hike to a waterfall in (the Kalalau Trail along the Na Pali Coast on the island of Kauai in Hawaii) and loved every minute.  Still researching, but finding lots of misleading information about whether it is possible or not."
arizona,2ytq8o,poepoepoe33,4,Thu Mar 12 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I think the Tempe Farmer's Market sells meat from The Meat Shop. The Meat Shop gets pastured beef; it's not cheap, but it's very good. They also raise their own pork.  You also might have good luck with farmer's markets. The one in Gilbert usually has 2-3 different vendors that apparently travel some sort of circuit, selling ranched beef, Alaskan fish, that sort of thing.  Ditto with eggs. You can normally find someone who keeps their own chickens, treats them right, sells eggs for $5/dozen in the process."

arizona,2ytq8o,Titular_Character,2,Thu Mar 12 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"They're nice people. They usually have some other stuff in a small freezer chest up front- buffalo, rabbit, duck, etc. Pricey, but good. They're also closed Mondays, I think it is.  If you're looking for less expensive cuts, they always have beef liver; they can custom order pretty much anything you want in terms of organ meats, as the slaughterhouse they use is a small operator."

arizona,2ytq8o,penguin_apocalypse,3,Fri Mar 13 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're only in the Valley 1 day a month and you've gotta get your order in early, a few weeks in advance. You also have to basically buy your meat for the month that day, so you'll need to plan accordingly. That said, their prices are good and they're really nice people. I used to go to Superstition Mall at 10:00am or something on a Friday to take delivery. Obviously their delivery schedule doesn't work for everyone, but their prices are way better than buying equivalent at a Farmer's Market."

I am not a fan of vendors in Farmers Markets, they freeze usually freeze the cut and hike up the price for travel expenses.  Most of the markets are around the same price.  Its a matter of where they get their beef.  Von Hansons is natural hormone free cow from Minnesota.  It was started by a couple in Minnesota and they opened one up here as well so they could retire and keep busy.    I have been going here at least once a month for the past five years.  The same employees have been there since I've been going.  I have my reasons why I like this place over the ""others"" but I don't want to bash them.  I will let you know that I did go to a family owned meat market recently and the owner's son confided in me that when they do a groupon or their supplier drives up the price, they use Fry's meat instead.  Being a meat man, I was able to tell by the color and thats when he told me.  They said no one could tell the difference.  I smiled, laughed and walked away never to return."
arizona,2ytq8o,kriegers-clone,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:32:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your input. I will check your suggestion out. And I am curious, for what information you have on the Meat Shop just so I am aware. I love that this is closer to me, I'm just more concerned with the conditions of the animals more so the quality of the meat. Being a meat man, I'm sure it's the other way around however, I respect your opinion because you will know more than I do."
arizona,2ytq8o,djreluctant,2,Thu Mar 12 23:42:40 2015 UTC,"I love to cook.  I can taste the difference between a factory cow vs a happy cow.  I am also very outgoing.  Its easy for me to talk to butchers and learn from them.  A good friend of mine used to be a butcher so he was able to tell me what to look for in a cut, what is okay smelling and the color that the meat should be.  Meat should never be a cherry red color.  That usually means the cow was locked in a small confinement and fed antibiotics and steroids.  They use a dye to change the color of the meat to hide the unappealing color of meat from cows treated inhumanly.    Von Hansons is just consistently good.  The cow product is the same cut that you would find in an amazing steakhouse (that had a happy life).  They make a nice amount of side dishes as well.  Check for Bea's Potato Bake in the freezer and their homemade pasta salad at the counter."

arizona,2yqyui,francesthepoot,10,Thu Mar 12 01:55:31 2015 UTC,Usually you park your car and ride the bus or light rail to places where you would have to pay for parking.
arizona,2yqyui,lbric,7,Thu Mar 12 01:58:43 2015 UTC,It's a parking lot.
arizona,2yqyui,DrLariat,4,Thu Mar 12 02:18:31 2015 UTC,"Here in Tucson, a park and ride just means the bus stop has a bus company funded parking lot you can leave your car at while you use the bus. Although they aren't in anyway protected (it's just an open parking lot with no security or anything), you won't get your car towed by some business who doesn't want parking spaces wasted by non-customers. They're usually the stop at the end of bus line, so you can go from it to any part of the bus line."
arizona,2yqyui,tineyeit,3,Thu Mar 12 03:41:42 2015 UTC,"I use a park and ride to park my car and then I take an express bus downtown for work.  I can park my car for free in the park and ride instead of paying for parking in a garage downtown.  I get to skip all of the traffic generally since the bus takes the car pool lane.  Even if there is traffic, I don't have to deal with it. I get to sit back and read my book.  I'm also lucky that my work pays for the bus pass.  So instead of spending a couple of hundred bucks a month for gas and over $50 for parking, I get to spend just a couple of bucks to drive a few miles down the street from my house to the park and ride."
arizona,2yqyui,fantasyham,3,Fri Mar 13 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"To further elaborate, most park and rides have express buses with one or two stops, normally to light rail or a bus stop, then you take a local route.   Not feasible for me, but if you hate the stress of rush hour traffic, it might be a good plan.   Valley Metro does have a route planner online. Busses run every 12-15 during peak times. I believe light rail is similar."

Crown King could be a little different because they've had a nasty fire or two right north of town so I'm not sure how the runoff may have affected the canyon there.

But a change.org petition won't do jack shit besides make some ASU/UofA/NAU students feel accomplished from their armchair activism. Here is a good model of how a recall in Arizona works. the two most important reasons why this petition won't work (from the article)   A. A recall petition shall not be circulated against any officer until he has held office for six months,   And    C. Signatures obtained on recall petitions by a committee or any of its officers, agents, employees or members before the filing of the committee's statement of organization are void and shall not be counted in determining the legal sufficiency of the petition.

Everything from a paved trail (Centennial trail out west) to a 2000 foot stairway called Bear Mountain trail. Where ever you are staying, ask at the front desk and they should be able to give you some help. Otherwise, the Hike House is pretty good. Or... you could just go through this list.   Right now, the weather is spring like. 40° to 70° F and sunny. Oh yea... sunscreen and sun glasses are a very good idea.   History? we have some nice State parks in the area, if you don't mind a bit of traveling.   All I ask is you don't take a helicopter tour. They are noisy and disturb everyone on the ground.

The touristy shopping areas are actually fun to walk around, and they have some of the best scenery in the city, but lock your wallet in your car.  360 Adventures is a company that does hiking, biking, etc tours in the area so you could look them up if you're after that sort of thing, but a guide is definitely not needed to navigate the terrain. Just be smart and pack lots of water.  Otherwise just follow AZ Pete's advice: Stay away from chopper tours, and ask around for advice at various places when you get here. Most retail stores are use to getting questions such as the ones you have so as long as it's vaguely what the store deals with, they should be able to help you out."

arizona,2yetbw,chaqetadvacaconqueso,4,Sun Mar 22 08:00:54 2015 UTC,"Being a hockey fan and seeing as you're Canadian, I have to warn you that the Florida Panthers have a much more stable future than our Coyotes. You can help by attending Coyotes games when you visit for fact finding! Anyway, here's some real info that I hope you find useful.  Your house hunting needs sound like they would be met in Sun City or Surprise. These are both cities with a large retirement population, though Surprise is certainly more diverse in age range and Sun City is kind of the butt end of old people jokes here. The price sounds about right too. You might also want to look at the North valley, as it's a bit more central and accessible to hotspots around the valley. Specifically the northern parts of Phoenix, Glendale, and Peoria. The suburban neighborhood I grew up in in the North valley is filled with either retired folks or rental properties  and that seems to be a growing trend for the area.  As a young adult living in AZ, I don't really care about the presence of snowbirds. They don't cause any inconveniences for me since I live in the metropolitan valley and busy is far from uncommon, but you do hear people whine about restaurants being crowded and the like. Also, I'm under the impression that a fair amount of older people live in the touristy locales like Sedona and Prescott, so it's hard to imagine them having complaints.  My only complaint is when snowbirds decide they love AZ so much that they forget to go back home and they end up staying here permanently and voting for things that make life harder on the state's young people, minorities, and LGBTs. Thanks to this trend, AZ remains a state where these demographics' voices are generally obscured in the absence of national attention. Of course I don't mean to prematurely accuse you of doing such a thing!"
arizona,2yetbw,babyoilz,3,Mon Mar 9 06:05:41 2015 UTC,"This is extremely accurate!   Especially your last snid bit. Being 25, I've never had real issues with them either. But what bothers some, may not others."
arizona,2yetbw,poepoepoe33,2,Fri Mar 13 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"I have lived in Arizona for 18 years now and until recently (2-3 years) have I really started to appreciate this state. Mainly its landscape and the abundance of nature it provides. AZ is quite beautiful in the sense that you have a lake full of city and just off the shore (out skirts) of the city is paradise. The most hidden treasure I find, is Bisbee. If that's ever a place to retire, I'd snag it in a heart beat.   For 150k in the city though, you could get something pretty decent. If you drove a bit out of the center of Phoenix and go more East towards Gilbert/Queen Creek, you could get a 4 bedroom, 2 car garage, with a pool that was built in the past 10 years for that price. Also, prices in general are nice on your wallet compared to other states.   If you have been around ""snowbirds"" yourself, you won't have a problem here. And like some who have mentioned, a good portion are Canadian. The only thing I run into that one would consider ""problematic"" is resturaunt etiquette. Tipping is huge. I feel like we ""Arizonians"" respect it on some level (of course there are those who are just plain stubborn) but coming from other states/countries, you tend to bring your states tip standards. Again, not something we run into all the time, just a bit of insight.   All in all, someone had put our political views into prescpective and he was spot on. The general public is not like that. However, I don't think I would ever raise my kids here, as saddening as it is to say. I would want my children to have a decent education. My dad and my stepmom are teachers so please excuse if I have offended anyone but charts and statistics are all you need to look it up. I was blessed with amazing teachers throughout my schooling however, it was all a blurr.   What you two have planned, Arizona sounds like a perfect place for you. The weather alone is enough to talk about. And if you plan on traveling, then the Summer heat will never affect you. If you should ever spend one here, it's really not that bad, especially if you have a pool...which is almost a necessity here. But just like the snow, you spend most of your time inside.   Please come and visit! You won't regret it."

arizona,2y6h98,speedyharper,4,Sat Mar 7 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"Well.  The problem is that Arizona is facing a budget deficit of a billion dollars a year. Drastic measures have to be made to fix that.  Education is also the single largest budget expenditure, so big cuts can be had from the biggest piece of the pie.  Cuts are only on the table because a central tenet of the Republican platform is to not raise taxes. No extra taxes means no extra money to soften the blow to these tremendous cuts. Republicans control the House legislature and Governorship. No tax hikes are getting through.  Many of Reps voted in recently bring in a wave that is against public education, and would instead like to see charter schools take over. They see the districts as inefficient and wasteful, and charters as more local, direct, and effective.  Last time AZ voluntarily raised taxes through a voter initiative ($.01 statewide) to specifically fund education, much of the money was reallocated (ILLEGALLY) to balance the rest of the AZ budget in the years after the recession.  The state has been sued and is looking to settle for the reallocation. A judge has ordered that AZ owes its education budget millions. Dicey has joked about this.  So a huge defecit with no money to pay it. A party that won't increase the state's income, is by and large against public education and a public wary of illegal reallocation makes this a very sad case.  Keep in mind that the problem has to be solved, and this lines up with the party's philosophy and stated campaign issues. They were voted in on this platform."

I did work for a charter school and I do not support the charter system at all. Especially the one I worked for. They preached such a loving message but everything the parents didn't see was horrible, and I doubt parents would want to know how we handled their children.

I am all for getting schools the funding they need. However, I understand that throwing money at it doesn't always solve the problem. It bothers me that the US public school system is among the best-funded but in recent decades only produces consistently mediocre results. Nobody can ever explain why other than ""we need more money,"" something that obviously isn't actually getting any positive results, and the cycle continues.   Where is the money going?  Why aren't the students learning?  Why is continued non-performance acceptable?  What are administrators doing about it besides demanding more money?  How do we get back on track?   Then you have private schools (religious and not), home-schools, as well as privately-run public schools that do get consistently good results...what is being done differently in those systems? Has anyone audited them to see? What did they find?  Our public schools (not just in Arizona) are failing and the only thing that seems clear to me is that it's much more complicated than a lack of funding."
arizona,2y5ep4,sunburn_on_the_brain,8,Fri Mar 6 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"The difference is mostly parents who are actually involved in their children's education. If you're coughing up the money to send your kid to a private school or coughing up the time to home school (provided you do it right) then you're invested in your child's education. Some of these charter schools are getting results by picking and choosing students through things like entrance exams. (Not all charters do a good job of educating students.) In public schools you get a lot more parents who really aren't that interested in what their kid does in school. Go ask a public school teacher about this.    Also, ask a public school teacher in a low-income neighborhood about the challenges of educating kids that don't have much at all, including food. I know teachers who have bought clothes and shoes out of their own pockets for some of these kids.   Theyve never even met these kids' parents in many cases. Some of the parents are working their asses off to make ends meet and don't have enough hours in the day to be able to help their kids through school. Some of these parents are drug or alcohol addicts and send the kids to school to get them out of the house, not caring about their schoolwork at all."

During that time, more and more mothers were entering the workforce.  The numbers of both single working mothers and couples where both spouses are working have risen throughout that time.  School has transformed into more of a caretaker environment since then, and more services are required.  Parents have required more resources for students and changes in school security and discipline have required more employees and funding.  School isn't just a place where kids go to class anymore."

I see no problem with parents who are willing to allocate their own funds to send their kids to private schools.  They value their children's education to a point where it makes sense to spend thousands of dollars annually on tuition.

Nor can you escape the government if you don't like the rules it makes.   If the government decides it has the power to regulate something, then people with deep pockets and lawyers can lobby the government to regulate it in a way beneficial to them. Or they can sue and bend those regulations around in a way beneficial to them. Either way, they will now have government sanction for their actions, whether they are beneficial to the consumer or not.  If the government does not have control over something, then lobbying/suing has little to no effect since politicians and judges can't effect change as they don't have power to do so.   I'm not saying that issues do not arise because they obviously do. However, they have been handled on a case-by-case basis between the impacted parties and those parties have been able to come to workable solutions on their own without government intervention.   So if anything is anti-competitive, it's involving government because now the government gets to say (after months or years of review/litigation) ""this is the solution"" whether it's actually good or not. Things on the internet evolve so fast and bureaucracy is so very slow and cumbersome ; do you really want a potentially ""good thing"" bogged down in red tape or litigation such that it takes years to get to market, if it gets there at all?  Whether you trust the Republicans to keep their mitts out of Comcast's (etc) pockets or not, it shouldn't matter. If the government doesn't have power over the internet, then the power rests in the entirely hands of the consumers and the most effective and immediate ""lobbying"" is the removal of our money from the ISP's pockets. There are alternative options out in all markets, whether it's a different wired provider (here we have both Century Link and Cox) or wireless via satellite or cell phone provider. I don't pretend they're all equal choices, but consumers pick the winners and if consumers decide they want to get all their internet wirelessly through Verizon or T-Mobile, etc those carriers will build to suit."

The internet is being manipulated by huge companies... how in a city our size can we have only 2 internet options... Cox or Centurylink!?!?!?!? This is insane. We NEED regulation on this to open up the market so we can have more options.

This amounts to a pretty significant cut for a student that's taking classes at a JTED site (like EVIT in Mesa).  This is a cut to the public/charter school that the student is also attending.

Many indigenous tribes do want the San Francisco Peaks back for ceremonial purposes, much of what comes from the mountain is used in ceremony and ""reclaimed"" water certainly takes away from the healing that many do want. The run off and melting snow from the resort will give what the mountain grows distinctive tastes, smells, sound, and feeling, it will have a huge affect on a person or communities spiritual well-being. The spirit you ask? Yes, it's important to what makes a person an individual. Many still do traditional practices, just because many do not post it on the internet, it does not mean there are practitioners - we like to keep things in the community.  In the context of the mountain, freedom of religion comes to play because that's really the only way the governmental systems will recognized or even hear out any group, if we simply said ceremonial, then many would roll their eyes and equate ""Injun Ceremonies"" to powwows and bingo. We say religion because it's easier for many to understand the sacredness of natural things, places, or beings, some tribes do not have a word for religion, because life is religion. Even then, many would argue because of the rampant health problems that many pose on themselves as an Indigenous person, that it is hypocritical, but like many; you have some that follow and some that do not follow traditional ways. Many tribes do have stories about the power and healing from the SF Peaks.  Since the resort is making money and the city will do anything and everything in their power to discredit the notion of freedom of religion that many tribes place on the mountain, the pocket-change rattling from the ski season will sound louder than the lawyers, attorneys, medicine people, and environmentalists. Some with a straight to the point view can simply say that what we practice is irrelevant and the reality is money, but we are still here, still carrying our own cultural identities and ways.

arizona,2xo2kb,thenavezgane,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"I've spent the last hour reading over the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) study they cite:    A study commissioned by the California Public Utilities Commission found that across the state’s three investor-owned utilities, solar customers pay on average 103% of the utilities’ cost to serve them   That report is:   http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/75573B69-D5C8-45D3-BE22-3074EAB16D87/0/NEMReport.pdf  But the way it works out is this: Most solar customers are currently in the highest tiers of users. On average, before installing solar, residential net-metering customers would pay 154% of the utilities' cost to serve. This means that these high-usage customers were subsidizing low-usage customers. After installing solar, that dropped to 81%. (Non-residential net-metering users dropped from 122 to 112%; combining the residential and non-residential users is how they got at 103%).   They concluded that for every kWH of power generated by a net metering customer, 20 cents must be recouped from other customers to keep the grid running.   I'm guessing from your username that it's inconvenient to learn that you have invested a lot of money in a personal infrastructure that places a social burden on the same people you wanted to help.

It is a miserable cold, makes us feel like we have been left without energy and the coughing is just terrible!  My sister in Kingman has it and my daughter in Southern California has had it for four weeks now.  She says it seems to get better, the comes back with a vengeance.  Good luck everyone, hope you that don't have it are able to avoid it!"

arizona,2xg4tv,secaa23,3,Sat Feb 28 09:05:28 2015 UTC,"It's not the Internet's vulnerability. It's remote areas that are vulnerable. You slice fiber pretty much anywhere and you will be fine but if there's only one run up to a remote city in northern Arizona you're gonna have a bad time. Even the 911 issues are not limited to the Internet. The phones are carried over the fiber, had it been a phone fiber line that was cut (before the Internet) the same problem would have happened. I'm surprised that the 911 services didn't have some sort of redundancy like 4G cellular backups (and I'm not talking about cell phones sitting on their desk). I work in telecomm and a ton of businesses do it this way because they can't afford to be hard down. 911 definitely can't be down."
arizona,2xg4tv,SmartToaster,3,Sat Feb 28 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"yeah, that is the only thing that really irked me is why the heck wasn't 911 available. When you think about it maybe they mean since nobody had a working phone how are you going to contact 911? It says it took down cellphones so the towers were probably all back hauling to the same fiber.  Really it just sounds like a poor design that was meant to save money and now they are blaming it on everything else but that. I have seen companies do this quite a bit."
arizona,2xg4tv,nanoage,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"My buddy and I have Verizon, and were talking throughout the ordeal, so not all cell towers were out.  Sudden link wasn't affected either, so it wasn't like we were completely cut off. It has to be the money because century link is the cheaper internet option up here, and every business I've worked at in Flagstaff has had century link as their isp. We know businesses are cheap, and now we know Flagstaff is cheap."

I generally feel that the ISP's need more competition to force them to up their game and lower their prices. Or something.

arizona,2x6g0o,JustJed,5,Thu Feb 26 01:09:43 2015 UTC,"Not once it's fixed. They will cut it clean and then put in fusion splices, making it like any number of splices along the sheath. Only problem with too many splices is that it can cause not enough light to make it to the node/terminal. When that happens it just goes offline."
arizona,2x6g0o,Sharkfac3,8,Thu Feb 26 01:25:18 2015 UTC,"I work at a DC with a century link node in it here in phoenix. We don't have a single major trouble ticket raised so whatever problems arises were fixed by rerouting traffic.  That's usually how they fix this shit. Route all the traffic around the problem area until its fixed and then put the routes back to normal. So packet loss probably not, latency yes if the route is too damned long or too damned crowded"
arizona,2x6g0o,SmartToaster,-4,Thu Feb 26 08:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, downvote the guy that actually knows what he's talking about. But yeah, you'll see a lot of latency. There may be some packet loss if the other circuits are over utilized but that's not likely."

I feel like there has to be something else to it other than just vandalism. Pissed off Century Link customers? (which is still just as shitty of an excuse to cut off service for everyone else) Or, maybe, just a bunch of bored kids in New River...   I also have to wonder why the conduits are so exposed that vandals have a chance to do this kind of thing without breaking a sweat."

arizona,2x6g0o,bluzdude,2,Thu Feb 26 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"My guess is that storm runoff caused erosion, exposing the cables.   This is 100% correct. They do not have that much fiber just sitting out in the open. You can tell it was buried and has now been brought up."

One of the best parks in the state, and an amazing living cave like you don't get to see pretty much anywhere else."

arizona,2x1wap,publichealthta,3,Wed Feb 25 00:05:43 2015 UTC,"I almost never use the AC in Flagstaff. If you go outside of Flagstaff in the summer through the deserts AC is important. Registering a vehicle in Flagstaff isn't really super expensive, but I moved from San Diego, so costs are compared to that. One thing to definitely consider on buying a car in IL vs here is in IL you will be dealing with Midwest rust hell. Here you can find completely rust free used vehicles in excellent mechanical condition. I would look at an AWD/4wd platform orrr if it's easier to find a front wheel drive vehicle that works too. Just makes it easier to drive in the snow.   Edit: I just realized you said you'd be doing some work on the Rez. Invest in a reliable, high-clearance, fuel-efficient-ish vehicle. AC is important. Reliability is doubly important. A 4-runner is my recommendation. Most of the Rez is accessed by unmarked dirt road, distances are large, and cell service is mostly non-existent."
arizona,2x1wap,HersheyHWY,1 point,Wed Feb 25 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"Cheaper in IL, by far. The flipside is property taxes are higher in IL.  Here it's based on price of model of said vehicle, then reduces every year.   http://azdot.gov/mvd/azwelcome.asp"

arizona,2wzngt,renaebair,10,Tue Feb 24 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"I've lived here my whole life, so I don't have much frame of reference but it is pretty damn awesome.   The outdoors in AZ is absolutely amazing. Tall pines are only 90 minutes from the Phoenix area, there are plenty of lakes and the obvious huge amount of desert mountain/canyon hiking there is to do.   AZ had a few notable public school districts but that seems to be changing with the 'starve the beast' public education policy our governor's office has waged over past few years. Phoenix has plenty of schools however, you should do your research.   While yes, the state is very conservative, it doesn't rule every facet of life. Open racism is rare, and the metro areas are pretty diverse.   It is really easy to get connected with like minded people. Phoenix has a huge urban gardening and local food scene. It has a growing music scene, and currently Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa are doing experiments with New Urbanism centered around our Metro Light Rail. Also the Mexican food is incredible here.   Try also on /r/phoenix as it is much more active."
arizona,2wzngt,VaguelyNativeMurican,3,Tue Feb 24 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info! In the summer do you find it's impossible to be outside for any length of time due to heat or is it manageable once you get used to it?   I just cross posted to r/phoenix, thank you for the suggestion!"
arizona,2wzngt,theoutrider5485,6,Tue Feb 24 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what /u/VaguelyNativeMurican said. Summer is doable, you just have to get used to it and drink water all the time. I like doing activities at this time because most other folks are hiding inside near the A/C. Really, you just acclimate yourself to the temperature and keep up the hydration and you will be fine. A pool helps a lot, if you can afford it.   As to the political climate here, it can be interesting. i live in Tempe which I found to be generally a younger crowd as we are near ASU and thus a more liberal area. I personally am on the very left end of liberal on everything except gun control. That being said, expect to see people wearing guns. Arizona is a Constitutional Carry state in which there is no documentation required for a person to carry concealed or openly. I have good friends who are raving Republicans insisting that Obama is coming for our guns and good friends who are the most starry-eyed flower children that you have ever met. I keep it real with everyone and generally avoid discussing political issues with folks that I don't know. The state policies are very Republican so that may frustrate you, but that is what voting is for.  Your questions about the schools, I cannot answer, sorry. I don't have kids. One thing that my friends that do have children say is to look into charter schools and private schools as public education here is pretty bad.  The landscape is gorgeous, cost of living is pretty good, and their is a high level of diversity as well. If you are thinking seriously about moving I would plan a couple of vacations if that is possible. Come in the winter, spring and summer as that should give you an idea of what the climate will be like."
arizona,2wzngt,VaguelyNativeMurican,2,Tue Feb 24 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"I find it is pretty manageable, but again I've lived here my whole life. I'm very used to it.   The A/C ad swimming pools will be your friend. For me, dealing with the heat for 4/5 months is completely worth it because it's 70 degrees the rest of the year. Also if you're into gardening, there are two planting seasons because of our climate. It's awesome."
arizona,2wzngt,Uncle_Erik,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Be realistic about the summers.  You can do stuff outside as long as you're wearing sunscreen, a good hat, sunglasses, and are drinking lots of water.  That said, the sun will tire you out much earlier than you'd expect.  You will feel fatigue much earlier than you'd expect.  If you have to work outside, you'll want to get up very early and do as much as you can by 10AM or 11AM.  Take a siesta and come back after 3PM or so.  As I mentioned in my other comment, summer nights are wonderful.  They will often be 90°-100°, but that's actually pretty comfortable when the sun isn't up.  You can go in the pool and you'll dry off in a few minutes.  Barbeque dinner and you can hang around outside all evening.  I have a feeling that doesn't happen too often in Maine.  Also forgot to mention that you'll have to take special care of pets during the summer.  Best not to leave them outside, but if you do, make sure there's shelter and lots and lots of water.  I have cats that stay inside, but even then, they drink a lot of water during the summers.  I leave about a gallon out and have to refill the pans every evening."
arizona,2wzngt,CoffinRehersal,4,Tue Feb 24 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"The rumor that Arizona public schools teach creationism is just a myth, right? Right?   I was schooled here my entire life and never experienced this. Hell, I've never even heard the rumor before.  As far as schools go, I'm not a parent but my understanding is that the best schools are in the east valley, think Gilbert. This is interestingly enough the most conservative area as well."
arizona,2wzngt,allisonstfu,2,Tue Feb 24 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, Chandler and Gilbert would be the best areas."
arizona,2wzngt,Nesnesitelna,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:28:28 2015 UTC,"Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe, Ahwatukee would be my recommendations."
arizona,2wzngt,joe_arpaio_is_a_nazi,3,Tue Feb 24 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"Tucson is much more liberal than the Phoenix area, slightly less hot, and also stunningly beautiful. I can't speak for the schools there.  There isn't much for public transit. The East side of the valley isn't so bad about that and is constantly improving, but there isn't much on the West side.  You won't encounter much open racism or homophobia in the cities (excepting some old, retired folk), but many rural areas have notable populations of good ol' boys. And many suburban areas have wannabe rednecks who fly confederate flags, drive giant trucks, and say racist shit about Mexicans because they think it's cool, but they're way too big of pussies to actually threaten anyone.  Creationism is not taught in public schools, at least for now. However, public schools are abysmally underfunded and only getting worse every year, and the new Governor Ducey is a proponent of cutting public school funding even more."
arizona,2wzngt,Bingo_Dino_DNA,4,Tue Feb 24 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Taking on to this, Tucson is almost a liberal enclave in Arizona. It really is a beautiful place once you actually go out to see it. Stick to the North side for the better and safer schools/areas! And also, creationism was never even mentioned  in school where I went haha"
arizona,2wzngt,Uncle_Erik,3,Tue Feb 24 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Arizona is not that conservative.  That gets skewed by a bunch of old rock-ribbed Republicans who move here to retire.  They vote conservative and that's why we have some crazies in office.  Out and about, however, you will run into plenty of like-minded liberals and you should fit in just fine.  The one thing you might find surprising is the amount of guns.  Lots of people open carry and concealed carry.  I'm about as liberal as they come, but I do own guns and occasionally carry.  There are meth-heads wandering through the alley at night and I am not going to risk surprising one without a handgun.  That's just how it is.  The summers can be vicious.  The tricky part is that 100°+ can feel somewhat reasonable and 115° doesn't feel that different from 100°.  However, the heat sucks the life right out of you.  You will feel fatigue much earlier than normal and by the time you feel thirsty, you're already getting close to heatstroke.  You have to start drinking water before you are thirsty.  I start the day with a half liter of water and continue drinking often until the sun goes down.  The upside is that you will hardly use the bathroom.  Be sure to keep extra water in the car (at least a gallon per person) no matter where you go.  I don't care if you're driving three miles to the market, make sure you have water.  No exceptions.  As for other heat-related stuff, get your car up to snuff.  Proactively replace the water pump if you haven't in the past few years.  Replace the hoses every year or two. Flush your radiator every summer.  Your cooling system must be in top shape.  You can DIY all this stuff fairly inexpensively, too.  Be sure your tires are in good shape and recharge the AC, too.  These are super important.  You'll want to wear a wide-brimmed hat.  I like boonie-style hats that keep the sun off your face and neck.  Baseball caps don't cut it.  Get a good pair of sunglasses and use them.  Do not get $5 sunglasses from a gas station.  Get a good pair with (preferably) polycarbonate lenses, full UV protection and polarization.  The sun is rough on your eyes here.  Same thing with prescription lenses: you want maximum UV protection.  Buy lenses made from polycarbonate or Trivex, those have terrific UV protection.  I'd choose those over contacts just for the UV protection.  I've never heard of creationism taught in schools here.  I was a substitute teacher and didn't see it.  Mostly, the kids get drilled on math and English to take standardized tests.  That I did not like.  Kids need history, geography, science, art, music, and much else.  So if your kids end up gettimg drilled to take standardized tests, be sure to teach them everything else at home.  Another upside is that you can go solar down here.  Usually over 350 days of sunlight, so you can push your AC costs onto solar panels and feel good about it.  It also makes driving an electric car more feasible.  For a few hundred, you can build a solar water heater, too.  Or build a solar cooker with the kiddos - those are a lot of fun.  Oh, I should mention that the other side of the coin with the brutal summer days is that we have lovely summer nights.  If you can do it, get a place with a pool and barbeque.  The pools get as warm as bathwater and you can spend the evening outside in t-shirts and shorts.  It'll still be 90° or so at night, which is very comfortable when the sun isn't beating on you.  Phoenix is very nice, but you can also enjoy a big city in Tucson.  I live in Yuma which is a smaller town, but the real estate here is very affordable.  It has some good schools, a good hospital and you're within driving distance of San Diego, LA, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Tucson.  If you want a smaller, quirkier community, consider Jerome or Bisbee.  They're my favorite places in this state, especially Bisbee.  Even if you don't move there, you have to spend a few days at each.  You will love them.  Flagstaff and Prescott might interest you, as well.  I'd also recommend learning Spanish, especially for the kids.  Engish will get you by pretty much everywhere, but a lot of Spanish is spoken.  You'll also want to vacation in Mexico.  Forget the stories about violence.  I go over about twice a month and have never felt threatened.  Mexicans are some of the nicest people on the planet.  If you can speak a little Spanish, you can enjoy it more.  There are lots of great resorts and cities to see down there.  Take advantage of it.  Unless you're directly involved in the drug trade, there's not that much to worry about.  And speaking of Mexico, you'll be able to get deeply into Mexican food down here.  It's a lot more diverse and interesting than what you'll find anywhere in the US outside of the southwest.  You will love it."
arizona,2wzngt,First_World_Lazy,3,Tue Feb 24 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"Meh. Stay in Maine. Most people from NE don't adjust well to the summers or the culture. If you want something warmer, I'd still look at North Carolina. Asheville, or something. Warmer, but still eastern, and also fairly liberal."
arizona,2wzngt,klieber,2,Wed Feb 25 03:52:26 2015 UTC,"Having moved here a year ago from liberal California, you'll notice the conservatism, but not in a bad way.  There are a TON more churches out here, including some big, mega churches.  There's way less diversity than SoCal, though I'm guessing it might not be much different than Maine.  And, the taxes are low.  That's the nicest part about living in a conservative state, to be honest.  The heat is not as bad as people make it out to be.  They wail and complain and post pictures of hair dryers on this subreddit, but in reality, it's just not as bad as they make it out to be.  Yeah, it's hot and no, you don't want to spend hours at a time outside when it's that hot.  You learn to deal with the heat pretty quickly.  As for places to live, people here love to hate on Scottsdale for being rich and pretentious, but it's a fantastic place to live and has some of the best schools in the area.  Another place is Cave Creek, which also has top tier schools and is further north.  That's more of a drive from everything central, but it sounds like that wasn't a huge consideration for you.  Gilbert is another area with decent schools, though it's population is exploding, so I'd be concerned about their ability to sustain good schools over the coming years."
arizona,2wzngt,grebilrancher,2,Tue Feb 24 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in the Phoenix school system right now, and I have brothers who are in public schools or have gone through them, plus friends who are in other schools. When we first learned about evolution, I remember my teacher saying that there are other theories out there about how our species came to be, and that included creationism. She backed up teaching Darwinian evolution theory with facts and general knowledge, and all of the students in my class had no qualms about learning evolution (nor did the parents, because no one was excused from class). This was in a public middle school in Phoenix. My friends, who went to other schools, didn't say anything about being taught creationism. And that goes for some of the religious schools in Phoenix, like Brophy (run by Jesuits). All I can say is, it's really worth the parent exposing their kid to different ideas, subjects, and places at an early and impressionable age- and Phoenix has tons of zoos, museums, interactive facilities, and the like that I loved going to as a kid!  There are many things wrong in AZ's education and does rank our public schools among the worst, but there are tons of charter, private, and good public school programs to get into. I go to a charter school myself and find the teachers to have very open and liberal views.   *This is  my bias and what I've noticed"
arizona,2wzngt,Howie_85Sabre,2,Tue Feb 24 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"It's hot. Be aware of this. Don't move here and be a hater. Know what you're getting into.  I'm very liberal, it's not an issue at all.

arizona,2wzngt,gnilmit,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:08:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who lived in Arizona for 20+ years and then moved to New England, I think you're crazy, lol. That being said, I'll try to be impartial:  Arizona IS really beautiful. It's a different kind of beautiful, though. You won't find forests and rivers and water everywhere in the Phoenix area. Phoenix is a giant, flat city that seems to go on forever. It, and all the surrounding cities, are about the size of New Hampshire, to give you an idea. And it's not like here, where there's a few miles between the next town - there's nothing but a sign to indicate you've moved from Tempe into Mesa, or any of the other ""suburbs.""   However, depending on the city you choose, you'll be able to find anything you need within a few blocks radius. And they will be open later (some even 24 hours!)  which is practically unheard of over here, lol. Living in the city is very convenient.  There won't be seasons. Especially in Phoenix. It's February there now, and the temps are already in the 80's. This is fabulous, until it gets to May and the temps are already in the 100's. You don't ""get used"" to the heat, either. You learn to adapt. You will need to drink more water than you've ever had to drink in your life. That's no joke. Your AC bills in the summertime will be astronomical - but again, that makes up for itself from October to April, when the temps are so beautiful that you don't need to use the heater.   You will not have the convenience of being able to drive less than an hour or so to get to the beach, the mountains, the forest, etc.  HOWEVER, you will be able to have all those things - it's just a longer drive. One of my favorite things about Arizona is that it has so many different types of landscapes. You can head up north a few hours to Flagstaff and get your pine trees, and even snow in the winter.  San Diego is about a 5 hours drive, so you can easily hit up the beach, the zoo, Sea World...or head to Anaheim and hit up Disneyland. You're close enough to Vegas to drive, and Arizona has the longest drive-able Route 66, if you're into that. Also, the Grand Canyon. Can't beat that! :)  The public schools are not amazing, because Arizona doesn't get a lot of funding, sadly. Housing markets really are better - it's definitely going to be cheaper to find a big house out there than it is out here.   You will never have to worry about natural disasters. The worst thing we get is sand storms. The roads will never be super slippery or covered with snow. You won't have to wait for the roads to be plowed, or worry about whether or not school is cancelled. People get a little stupid on the roads when it rains, but it doesn't do that very often, so you should be okay.  I feel like I'm kind of all over the place with this response, but what I'm ultimately trying to say is that Arizona is an amazing state. It's just VERY different from Maine. It will take a lot of adjusting, but I think you'll love it.   Edit: a word."
arizona,2wzngt,wee0x1b,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"The rumor that Arizona public schools teach creationism is just a myth, right?   Yep, complete myth. If you go to a private Christian school they'll teach it, but not in public schools.  Also, you shouldn't sweat the politics all that much.  I'm as left on some things as I am right on others, and one of the things I love her is the diversity. Among my friends, I have card-carrying medical pot-using hippie friends in the urban gardening/farmer's market communities as well as gun-toting righty business owners. Honestly, politics never comes up.   A state isn't its laws. Sure, we have a lot of older right-leaning types who vote in some fairly stupid laws, but people are all over the political spectrum. You won't stick out in the least.  Yes, it does get hot here. But you never have to shovel the heat.  And you do get used to it. Summer nights here are fabulous. The air is perfect body temp, no swarms of bugs, and it's just wonderful.  Also, the monsoons are amazing. They're what I missed most when I moved away.  Scottsdale has very good schools. You see a lot of mention of it when buying a house."

Arizona is a different level of crazy. We are one of two states that doesn't have a ban for texting while driving because personal freedom! Our Superintendent of Education is a certifiable moron with zero experience who ran on one issue: repeal common core. She won without campaigning against an excellent candidate with great experience. Article on her win: http://www.azcentral.com/story/ejmontini/2014/11/10/diane-douglass-arizona-superintendent-public-instruction-arizona/18797529/  The legislature here is pretty much anti anything that makes sense. Anti-education, anti-reproductive rights, anti-tax, anti-poor, etc. The schools really aren't that good, and they are getting worst because of new Governor is basically in the pockets of charter schools. A lot of people believe that he is going to purposely make public school worse to help charter schools. I'm not sure if I'd go that far- but I will say that what he is doing will hurt our education.

Some of the suburbs have great school districts- like Gilbert- but Gilbert (where I live) also has the most batshit crazy school board you can imagine. They actually voted to censor a biology book because a paragraph on reproduction did not say that adoption was ""preferred"". The Department of Education said that the passage in the book was fine. You can read about that here: http://www.azcentral.com/story/brahm-resnik/2014/10/29/12news-gilbert-school-board-remove-page-biology-book-abortion/18126635/  There's a lot of good in Arizona.

Arizona has some of the best schools in the country. Google Basic Schools and take a look. We have a few of them down here and I've heard great things.  As software developers, you will find plenty of opportunities here. There is even talk of an Apple HQ coming to town in the next few years that will open up a ton of jobs for people just like you!  As a Realtor in this fine state, I can attest to the fact that this year would be a great time to make your move.

arizona,2wvux1,Pushpin1,6,Mon Feb 23 16:44:42 2015 UTC,No bugs and less rain/humidity. Also.... mountains are cool.
arizona,2wvux1,warrenfgerald,6,Mon Feb 23 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I lived more than 15 years in Florida and now I've lived more than 15 years in Arizona. I'll tell you right now, Arizona hands-down. You are two hours away from every conceivable climate here. There are mountains, plains, tundra, scenic stuff like you wouldn't believe and every range of temperatures.   And you couldn't pay me to live in Florida again. People everywhere complain because they don't know any better, but I know better. Phoenix flat sucks in July and August. It's not much better in June and September. But everything in-between is awesome. There really is something to the dry heat thing. Everything up to 100F here is perfectly tolerable. In Florida, it starts sucking in February, as temperatures get above 80F what with the ridiculous humidity. And the damned mosquitoes. I can go on and on.  Arizona all the way!  Loved the video, by the way."
arizona,2wvux1,Supervisor194,4,Mon Feb 23 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info Supervisor194, and the compliment on the video. I may be heading out there in April so we can check out the areas."
arizona,2wvux1,TheHornyHobbit,6,Tue Feb 24 01:06:44 2015 UTC,I've lived in both places.  It depends what you like to do with your free time.  If you like fishing and boating then Florida is your place.  If you like mountains then Arizona is better.  Golf and weather is good in both places.  People are actually pretty comparable.
arizona,2wvux1,nintynineninjas,4,Mon Feb 23 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comparison, Hobbit. I appreciate your input."

arizona,2wvux1,KnottyKitty,3,Mon Feb 23 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"Is there such thing as a typical reddit geek?  I've never been to South Jersey but there are a lot of strip malls in Phoenix.  We have the 4 major sports teams out here, some nice museums, a cool zoo, good food and bars for all tastes.  As someone said earlier, if you like to travel, there are many cool places within a half-day drive or less."
arizona,2wvux1,allmyguts,3,Mon Feb 23 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it's nothing like South Jersey, so it has that going for it. We have sports bars, liqueur stores, strip malls, etc., but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a state that doesn't.  I too am a mostly-indoor reddit dweller and Arizona suits me just fine. The heat isn't a big deal thanks to air conditioning (or a swamp cooler, which works great for most of the year). There are plenty of odd shops and places that geeks love, especially downtown. If comic cons are your thing, Phoenix ComicCon brings in tens of thousands of people each year. If you're into geology and/or goods from around the world, check out the Gem and Mineral Show that happens each spring. If you like concerts there are tons of options. I saw Metallica here in Tucson back when that meant something. If you prefer solitude, the more-land-than-people aspect of the state means that you have options for a more secluded lifestyle."

Arizona is hands down my favorite, but I'm sure there's some guy on /r/florida that would say the same.  Obviously the valley is beautiful, but there's so much to see and do in the northern part of the state as well.  If you wan't to check out the mountains and get a break from the sun, head north.  I spent a weekend in Greer last month in a snow-covered cabin and it was awesome.  Then I came home and had a margarita in shorts and flip flops.  It's also stupid cheap to live here, so there's that."

It's nice weather almost year round, which makes this a great place for you and your cars. For the gun portion, the rules here very relaxed, and there are plenty of places to shoot and hunt. To go along with all of this we don't have natural disasters. Sometimes we get dust storms, and strong winds during monsoon season, and we it gets a little hot in the summer, but that's about it. If you can't handle a dry 110 on a consistent basis you can migrate up north to Flagstaff or Sedona. We also get a fair amount of snow throughout the northern part of the state, so if you miss the snow it is only a couple  hours away."

Took a group of scouts up last summer (and we're going back this summer) The first 2 courses are pretty easy, but if you aren't in decent shape, the last 2 courses can become challenging. If you're not used to working out at altitude, be prepared to fatigue more easily and hydrate frequently. Rest between the second and third course and recover a bit, and then definitely rest between red and black courses, and you'll probably be able to make it if you're in decent shape.   At any time, on any course, if you run out of steam and feel you can't continue, the course marshalls will come help you descend back to the ground and get off the course.  Definitely worth the trip."

arizona,2vpf48,whowatches,2,Thu Feb 19 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm... you ask about public places, but your examples are all private places.  And since bars and restaurants are private establishments, it's up to them if they permit dogs or not -- there isn't really and set rules that globally apply.  I will say that it's very rare to see dogs inside of restaurants, but I don't know if it's because they aren't allowed or if nobody is bringing them.  It could very well be the latter since Phoenix doesn't really have the dog culture that places like Seattle and Portland and the like have.  Plus, you rarely see dogs being carted around in the summer since it's so ungodly hot inside of cars.  Now as far as public spaces go, Cosmos Dog Park in Gilbert is apparently ranked the 4th best dog park in the nation by Dog Fancy magazine.

arizona,2vbme5,mchandleraz,9,Mon Feb 9 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"Former Canyon guide here.  Compared to other Canyon hikes, it's a stroll. A long, flat, boring stroll. Not challenging. If you want a good analogue, put on the pack you'll carry, then climb Squaw Peak twice, up and down. Then walk five flat miles. That's the day, really.  Bad news: the views are not anywhere in the ballpark of those in the Park, and the trail tends to be dotted with litter and the occasional dead horse. Love them tribal managers, baby! You can probably tell I'm not a fan. Frankly, I hate that hike, though it is not difficult.   It's not all bad news, though. The waterfalls there are quite simply the finest natural swimming holes I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a lot. They are the entire reason for making that trip, and are truly special, but the hike and the tribe both suck. Stay out of the village - I've been challenged to a couple of fights by drunks for no reason."
arizona,2vbme5,First_World_Lazy,2,Mon Feb 9 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"I understand that you should always beat down a challenger there because it's important to establish dominance over the other males and demonstrate your superior genes to prospective mates.  I've only been challenge twice down there and both times I ruthlessly kicked their teeth in. Needless to say the females submit to my alpha maleness. Also there is plenty of good eats around the watering holes and no competition with Hyena or Aligators for food.  Oh I should mention I'm a lion so is not recommended to follow if you're human.   TL:DR I'm a lion, roar. Don't follow these instructions unless you're a lion. Havasu falls is an awesome watering hole and the prey is good."

arizona,2vbme5,First_World_Lazy,3,Tue Feb 10 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"I've done this exact same trip! Same time of year and everything, of course the Falls are beautiful at any time of the year... Ultimately though I'll personally do whatever I can to avoid a trip down in June. The area at the bottom of the Grand Canyon hiking to/around the Falls, is almost a mirror of Phoenix's weather, so definitely expect triple digits. Utilize all the available amenities possible to make it easy, even if you're going to the cabins at the bottom try to get a mule to take some extra weight for you. Pretty sure it's a flat rate, and not charged by weight (personally was fine to bring 3 large duffle bags with food, camping accessories, additional first aid and random supplies.)   Hike in the earliest hours possible, by noon wherever you are may be where you're at for the rest of the day, so hopefully you've found the falls, your campsite, or the town. Shade can be a scarcity in several key places so at that time of the year with as much sun as Havasupai gets, it'll beat down.   Also there is a helicopter service available that takes you from the town to the Hilltop for under $100 one way. If you can make it down, and after hiking the falls you or any of your party feel to weary you can pack some extra cash and arrive at the helipad super early. They don't take reservations, it's first come first serve, but if you get there in the morning they get to you eventually.   Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, or want any recommendations for good trails to train on."

Those are the people that die or have to be lifted out with a helicopter and a $50,000 bill. Don't be one of those people.  Yes, it is going to be difficult. Are you hiking Kiwanis Trail with a 60 LB pack on? If not, you should start. Doesn't have to be 60 right off the bat, but 30-40 is a good starter weight.   Hiking out is the hardest. You will have to pace yourself. Bring plenty of water. You guys are going in the middle of summer, which is crazy to me but hey, to each their own.   When I've hiked the canyon in the past, we were doing about 10 miles a day, and it was pretty rough. I can't remember which trail you take down, but hopefully you have some shade. Are you going to Havasu Falls???"
arizona,2vbme5,benwaaaaaaaah,2,Mon Feb 9 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"We were planning on adding weight during our hikes. On my walks to/from work (2 miles each way, which I usually do a few times a week) I carry about 10 lbs and even that little bit of weight does change things noticeably.  I'm starting to think that I'll have a lot easier time than my girlfriend..."
arizona,2vbme5,StumpNuts,2,Mon Feb 9 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"Here's a suggestion coming from an infantry veteran who's done one or two road marches in his day. Get a backpack and load it to 35 pounds. Everywhere you go, always have it on. Always. Don't take it off unless you're not going to be moving for a while. Your body will get stronger in the places it needs to and it's not so much weight that it kills you. After a week, add ten pounds. One more week add ten more, keep going until you can go 12 miles in three hours with whatever weight you'll be carrying.  Why 12 miles in three hours? It's a brutal pace for those who aren't physically ready and mentally prepared(that is a huge issue in itself, not quitting) but I've found that anyone who can do that pace, can do it damn near forever with proper motivation.   My basic training class for example, 62 people went from decent shape barely able to go 4 miles without falling out. In three months using the above method and proper motivation (for you that motivation will be not looking like a pussy in front of your gf and her family) we were all able to keep that pace, in Georgia, in the summer, for 28 miles after two weeks in the field.   Push yourself, get good boots CHANGE SOCKS, and just have the heart to stick it out, you'll be going nowhere near the pace I described above so if you reach that goal you'll look like a bad ass."
arizona,2vbme5,StumpNuts,2,Mon Feb 9 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"for you that motivation will be not looking like a pussy in front of your gf and her family   Hardly a concern for me. My concern is being able to enjoy the trip.  Carrying a loaded backpack everywhere isn't feasible for me, but I can definitely start carrying it outside of week days. Especially on hikes. 12 miles in 3 hours sounds like the pace I keep when I'm walking to/from work, I'll just have to work on endurance if I want to be able to maintain that pace for more than the first few miles.  Thanks for the insight. I'm going to start carrying a weighted pack on our hikes, and whenever else I can."

Even in shoes that I have hiked down in the canyon with before,(Bright Angel, North Kaibab, and Tonto), I developed blister because of the sand.   The hike itself is long but not overly difficult. Pace is the important part both up and down. If you plan to hike all day then you will be fine. If you plan to make it down or back up in 6 hours you are going to have a bad time. Take a break and pack enough water.   You absolutely need to do this hike. It will change you life :)"
arizona,2vbme5,benwaaaaaaaah,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"I just chaperoned a 8th grade field trip. It wasn't bad, but a lot hinges on how much your carrying.  You can use the donkey and do it the easy way.  The hardest part is the switchbacks on the way back.  Especially if it's hot because there is no water along the hike and by the time you get to the switchbacks it's the hottest part of the day.  When I go with friends, we leave the campsite after dinner and night hike, hitting switchbacks around sunrise....it's awesome"

arizona,2vbme5,Kippersnaks,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"I think this kind of depends on how much you're carrying and how fast you plan to do it.  Backpacking uses different muscles than just hiking, so start your training hikes with a light pack and gradually keep adding water or rocks every weekend until you're at the weight you expect to be carrying on the Canyon trip, carried for the length of the trail you plan to do.  Wear the shoes you plan to wear; if your shoes are old buy a new pair right now to break them in.    Try to do a lot of hiking NOW while the weather's nice, and then in May/June you can try to just maintain your endurance with the treadmill/stairclimber in the gym, or early morning walks.  As for hikes in the area, anything fairly steep done at or longer than the distance of your hike should be fine.  I'm assuming you're camping so be sure to hike 2+ days in a row, I get sore on Day 2.  Mt. Ord is a decent canyon training hike because the trail is wide/easy, it's a little cooler there, and most importantly you can park at the TOP and hike down and then up, so you get an idea of the way that affects your calves & quads.   Another poster noted that fit people underestimate the canyon, and it's SO easy to do.  Here's the thing though, even if you feel confident you can do it, you'll enjoy the trip so much more if you're able to focus on the beautiful landscape & geology instead of how much it hurts.  Everything is just better when you're strong and durable.    Have fun and post pictures!"

arizona,2vbme5,TheHornyHobbit,2,Mon Feb 9 20:24:50 2015 UTC,"We aren't camping, so our load should be a lot lighter than if we were.That much elevation in that short of a distance really puts it in perspective, though."
arizona,2vbme5,LostInTheTubes,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:36:16 2015 UTC,Imagine hiking 10 miles on a very gradual uphill then climbing Piestewa Peak (1.3 miles and 1300 feet in elevation).  That's pretty much what it's like hiking out.  Do put your stuff on a mule if you can. It makes the trip much more carefree and relaxed if you are not a backpacker. You can also send down comfort items you would not want to carry that far.

When you're in the canyon it's MUCH darker since there isn't a ton of light coming down through.   Also, be prepared for winter weather, make sure you add a little extra time if it's snowing, not sure when you're coming to visit, but with the jet skiiing comment I can only assume summer unless you don't mind freezing cold water."

There is really no excuse for maintaining dealership laws, or otherwise prohibiting the sale of a product; even under the guise of safety issues, as it is just too logically probable, and historically proven, that this type of populist legal campaign is merely a facade for anti-competitive measures by incumbent and politically connected industry (in this case, probably the dealerships)."

The only people that are affected are the rich and if they want the car so bad they have to go over an extra obstacle. Most of them have the time anyway so I personally think it sucks but there is definitely more of an upside to it.   It will be a greater concern perhaps this year when they release the low end model thats more obtainable to the middle class. http://gas2.org/2014/03/09/2016-tesla-model-e-rendered/  Another thing. Giving someone the ""Luddite Award"" for a decision that honestly affects the rich more then anything is hilarious. Thats honestly equivalent to banning the sale of a certain type of yacht manufacturer. ""Like omg I can't buy my yacht in AZ. Now I have to fly to Cali where I was going on business anyways and get it there. Just for that heres this Luddite award."""

One minute of going on google will show you all the sources you need. You can parse through it, or not, considering that you'd much rather use anecdotal evidence to suffice for actually understanding the topic at hand.   I've worked in Education with Hispanic kids here in AZ; have you?   Yes, I have.   Also and I mean I know I'm supposed to cower anytime the word racism is thrown out there (what race do you think I am btw - just curious)...   I really don't care what race you are.   you do understand that Mexico has massive disparities in socioeconomic status right?  Using your (clearly advanced) critical thinking skills do you believe that the most affluent 5% of Mexico's populous or poorest 5% would gravitate towards leaving their homes/families/possessions to come to the US? <-- you're not going to answer this & I can't blame you   This is a rhetorical question by how you've set it up. The obvious answer is the poorest come to the United States.   Also I notice that both the US and Mexico don't have rates of 100%    No country has 100%.   how are we going to bring that up to 100% without the capacity to verify the ID of a huge segment of the population? <-- you're not going to answer that either   Another rhetorical question. Did I say we shouldn't ID them?  The crux of your argument is ""We won't be able to have a good vaccination program because illegal Mexicans don't understand what vaccines are, or are too poor."" If you look through the many articles I posted in the single link above, you'll also notice that the poor in Mexico and the US tend to be vaccinated more than the middle class or upper class.

The 2 major constructions to watch out for on AZ89 are a roundabout in Chino Valley and the Hell Canyon bridge.  On I40 there's a bridge re-paving project ongoing just east of the US93 junction and that might have a delay also due to both directions being cut down to one lane.  Now if you're returning on Monday use US93 as all constructions will be fully staffed and working.

Walk around Old Town at night, get a drink.  Union Barrelhouse, Culinary Dropout, or Kazimeres are cool spots.  Greasewood flats is great place to get dinner passing through.

arizona,2uj29m,benwaaaaaaaah,6,Tue Feb 3 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Can you please ELI5 this bill?"
arizona,2uj29m,olllllo,17,Mon Feb 2 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"Sure. Our laws say that if you brew beer you have 2 choices.   1) You can brew under 40,000 barrels and be given a microbrewer license. With that license, you can sell to the public, drive your beer to another place to be sold and you can open an unlimited number of restaurants.  2) You can brew an unlimited amount of and be given a producers license. You can't sell it directly to people. You have to use a distributor to pick up your beer. You also can't open restaurants.  Our law in Arizona is unclear what happens to microbreweries that become successful enough to brew more than 40,000 barrels. It says that the state will grant them a producers license. It does not say what happens to the restaurants that the brewery opened in neighborhoods and in towns.   Our breweries are asking that we allow those breweries to keep those restaurants open so that people won't have to lose their jobs. Those businesses and jobs bring money to the state. In exchange, the breweries will agree not to open an unlimited number of them, but just up to 7. These conditions allow for the breweries to compete with breweries in other states that don't have such unfair rules. The breweries are not asking for favors, but just the same rules as breweries in other places. Also this won't cost any money, but will add money to Arizona (and jobs). (The state doesn't have enough money to pay its bills).  The breweries also want to help small breweries by allowing them to be able to sell more than just their own beer. Sometimes breweries grow so fast that they run out of beer. They need to sell other beer sometimes so that they can be open more and buy equipment to grow bigger.   The breweries worked out this problem with 11 of the beer distributors in the state. They cooperated. Everybody likes this bill and the cooperation.  The bill is opposed by poopy-heads that treat us like children. They want to protect us from the boogey-man (Bud) even though Bud could not care less and has documents that say that they don't care. The Arizona Wine and Spirits Wholesale Association (poopy heads) don't have a website and they don't like anyone to know who they are (even though they could buy 10,000 websites without losing any sleep.) They are like the kid on the playground that won't let you have the ball. They also have liquor distribution deals that mostly involve out-of-state liquor mega corporations. They don't want any changes to anything that has the potential of making them compete fairly.  You did say 5."

arizona,2uj29m,olllllo,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"In California they have a barrelage cap, however, California also allows license stacking and the holding of multiple licenses. The net result is that you get a Stone brewing that owns a distribution company, a hotel and restaurants. Stone brews close to 300,000 BBLs. They also are building an east coast brewery and one in Europe.  They have been on INCS fastest growing companies for 10 years.  We'd like to see what Arizona breweries can do with those kind of business conditions.    One of the companies that opposes our bill is Young's Market. They are based out of California. They did 3 Billion in revenue. They should be OK with our change to a more free market."
arizona,2uj29m,AZBigGuy,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"So basically California allows for the same company to be both: A) A distributor and then B) Secondarily own restaurants, is that correct?

It has been criticized both for being a social engineering scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.  In an interview in Reason, a right-libertarian magazine, professor Peter Gordon, a professor of Urban Planning from University of Southern California, spoke in favor of suburbanization, stating that the New Urbanism ignores consumer preference the free market and that cities have moved towards car-oriented development because that is what people want.   On the other hand, journalist Alex Marshall has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans.  In a 1996 article in Metropolis Magazine, Marshall denounced New Urbanism as ""a grand fraud"".  The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the Washington Post in September of the same year,  and in Marshall's first book, How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken      Interesting: Glenwood Park | Peter Calthorpe | Carlton Landing, Oklahoma | Le Plessis-Robinson   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

It's not something you can do in a month or two though, so if you're looking for something immediate, you may want to apply to local electrical contractors or even contact a staffing agency that specializes in technical positions."
arizona,2udtta,PCPhD,2,Sun Feb 1 10:19:38 2015 UTC,I am currently enrolled in the get into energy program with TEP in Tucson. It is a really cool program and will give you the foundation to do anything in the electrical field. A lineman at TEP can easily make 6 figures as well. If you are in Phoenix I know there is a similar program with APS. Jobs in the electrical industry are in very high demand now and in the coming years.

arizona,2u3o8j,GiveYourBestEffort,7,Thu Jan 29 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"Copy Pasta for those who are interested in the article, but don't want sound distractions.   (Bloomberg) -- Health officials in three Arizona counties said hundreds of people may have been exposed to the highly contagious measles virus, three days before thousands of sports fans pour into the state for the Super Bowl.  The National Football League championship game will be held in Maricopa County at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale on Feb. 1. Officials there, and in Pinal and Gila counties, are looking for people who have been to hospitals, grocery stores and a post office where infected residents visited.  “Measles is wildly infectious, which is why it is so important that we identify cases quickly and do our best to stop the spread early on,” Bob England, director of the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, said in a statement. “That means keeping unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the disease away from others.”  Arizona has reported eight cases so far, two in Maricopa County. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to man, with each original patient able to infect many others if they aren’t vaccinated. Maricopa health workers are trying to track down 195 people, mostly children, Jeanene Fowler, a spokeswoman for the county health department said in an e-mail Thursday.  The virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for hours, and health officials are trying to track down those exposed. Maricopa’s county health department said that people who have potentially been exposed and aren’t fully vaccinated should stay at home for 21 days. People who may have been exposed should wear a mask if they need to go out in public, the department said in a Jan. 27 statement.  Disney Outbreak  The Arizona cases are linked to a California outbreak where officials have identified 79 cases of the disease, which started in Anaheim’s Disneyland amusement park. Cases linked to the outbreak have also been found in Mexico, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Michigan and Nebraska, according to the California Department of Public Health.  The spread of the outbreak has been made worse, in part, by a growing failure to vaccinate. Arizona allows vaccination exemptions for children entering public schools for religious reasons as well as what’s known as a philosophical exemption, where parents can choose not to vaccinate and still send their children to school.  While most states permit religious exemptions, just 19 states give philosophical exemptions, including Arizona and California, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  The outbreak is the first in Arizona since 2008, according to the state’s Department of Health Services."

(The Kelvin scale was first proposed in 1848.)  The symbol for degrees Rankine is °R  (or °Ra if necessary to distinguish it from the Rømer and Réaumur scales). By analogy with kelvin, some authors call the unit rankine, omitting the degree symbol.   Zero on both the Kelvin and Rankine scales is absolute zero, but the Rankine degree is defined as equal to one degree Fahrenheit, rather than the one degree Celsius used by the Kelvin scale. A temperature of −459.67 °F is exactly equal to 0 °R.  Some engineering fields in the United States measure thermodynamic temperature using the Rankine scale.  The US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends not using degrees Rankine in NIST publications.

I mean, the federal law didn't actually change, just how it is being enforced has changed. Can someone explain how it is valid to use ""administrative action"" as the basis for a legal ruling when judges are supposed to rule on the law itself? Also how can the federal government force a state to issue a state driver's licence since that's 100% a state-issue?

arizona,2tdpn3,ZOlNK,11,Fri Jan 23 06:40:54 2015 UTC,"From Google:  The truth of the matter is in the Midwest and other areas of the country where the ground freezes, foundations have to be poured below the frost line which can be up to 4 feet deep, so it doesn’t cost that much more to go a few feet deeper to create a basement.  Here in Arizona, builders only have to dig 18 inches to pour the foundation, so a substantial cost and time element would have to be added to add a basement. A basement dig will add about 30 days to a new home construction and typically, this will add a minimum of $50,000-$60,000 to the cost of the home.  This cost is for a fully complete basement…with walls, flooring, probably a bathroom…everything."
arizona,2tdpn3,allisonstfu,6,Fri Jan 23 11:42:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is the main reason.  It's true that the soil isn't great for digging, but it's nowhere near as bad as it is in a lot of places that have ubiquitous basements.  You simply don't have to do the deeper dig here, so most builders don't bother.  It is a shame, since basements are pretty ideal in the summer."

They would pop up on the market once every week or two.  They tended to be more expensive for the same square footage and were almost always snatched up immediately.  Lots of people like the idea of basements.  But yeah, if you're patient and willing to spend a bit more, then there are absolutely basement homes available in Gilbert."

It occurs worldwide, in aridisol and mollisol soil orders—generally in arid or semiarid regions, including in central and western Australia, in the Kalahari Desert, in the High Plains of the western USA, in the Sonoran Desert, and in Eastern Saudi Arabia Al-Hasa. Caliche is also known as hardpan, calcrete, kankar (in India), or duricrust. The term caliche is Spanish and is originally from the Latin calx, meaning lime.

arizona,2t37y7,HackPhilosopher,29,Tue Jan 20 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"Forest Service seeking information on archaeological site vandalism  Flagstaff, Ariz. – U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement and Investigation on the Red Rock Ranger District is seeking information concerning vandalism to an archaeological site known as Jordan Cave near the Jordan Trailhead parking lot in Sedona.  On Dec. 16, 2014, several individuals in Jordan Cave were seen removing and throwing rocks from the walls of the site over a steep embankment. Some of the rocks were also dug from the prehistoric floor of the site and were thrown over the embankment.  Law Enforcement is trying to identify and locate the individuals in the attached photo who might be able to assist in the investigation regarding the vandalism.  “These prehistoric sites are rare treasures on our public lands and the Forest Service takes every effort to preserve and protect those resources,” said Patrol Captain Jon Nelson. “Once these sites are damaged, it removes a piece of the puzzle of how past communities lived an existed over time that cannot be replaced. It not only destroys scientific evidence, it denies the public from seeing these areas as they were left by the Pueblo people who lived here centuries ago.”  It is illegal to excavate, remove, damage, alter or deface any archaeological resource, to include surface collecting. An archaeological resource is defined as any historic or prehistoric object or resource that is 50 years or older.  These acts of vandalism and theft to protected sites are found under the Archaeological Resource Protection Act of 1979, under Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations 261.9(g), which makes it a criminal violation under federal law. The severity of the crime ranges from a Class B Misdemeanor, which is six months in jail and a $5,000 fine, to a felony, which is one year in jail and/or $20,000 fine.  Anyone with information regarding this vandalism should contact Officer Mike O’Neil at 928-203-7512."

National Parks are different, and for them your statement is completely accurate.    That being said, this incident is disgusting and angering.

Though the type of stacking looked to be done by someone that knew how to stack a rock wall and would have figured that it was probably some ancient people.  For kicks I think I'll try someday to build a rock wall in front of a cave to make it look like an ancient wall and then on one of the rock bottoms put the troll guy.

arizona,2t2z2t,Taint_Guche_Grundle,5,Tue Jan 20 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"You could also check out the ruins at Tonto National Monument.  It's about an hour and a half or so from Phoenix. If you have the time in the day, you could do a loop that would take you to Montezuma and Tonto by catching AZ 260 out of Camp Verde. That's a nice drive.    It looks like you don't have the time to go out and spend a couple of days around Four Corners, because you would just love love love Mesa Verde.  If you can, set up a trip to go see the park.  It's amazing.    How long do you have down here?  That might influence recommendations."
arizona,2t2z2t,poepoepoe33,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:56:08 2015 UTC,I came here to say Tonto as well. Your assumptions about the ruins you mentioned and their spectacular ness or lack there of are pretty spot on. But of the ones that are the closest drive to Phx Tonto is the best in my opinion. It is a nice drive and a short hike up to the cliff dwelling. If you did start very early you could go north from the Phx area and hit the Verde Valley ruins and then take 260 over to Payson and then go south on 87 until you got to 188 and then go over and check out Tonto. Then back track a little and come home on 87. Then you could check out all three in one day. You could also stay closer to home and do Pueblo Grande and the heard museum in on day and even squeeze in the little Hohokam ruin they have in Mesa. I forget the name of that one. The drive to Casa Grande N.M. in Coolidge is kind of boring but the ruin itself is pretty neat because it is postulated that it was the tallest building (4 stories) in the SW during its time. Hope this helps.

The Tonto area is somewhat north of Phoenix - I usually start my explorations from Heber (about 130 miles NE).    The writer Zane Grey wrote a lot of fiction about the old west in Arizona.  He had a cabin up on the Mogollon Rim.   If you felt like going south, you could visit Tombstone, one of the towns that gave Arizona the 'wild west' image.  The movie Tombstone (Val Kilmer & Kirk Russle), among many others, was filmed there and supposedly follows history.  What else?  There's always the Superstitions, a mountain range where many treasure hunters are believed to have lost their lives.  The Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine is somewhere out there.  Who knows?  You could be the one to find it.  Oh yea!  One of the best know cases of Alien Abductions took place in the Sitgraeves Nat'l Forest!.  I even know a guy who knows Travis Walton!  Anyway, I've just given a few items that interest me.  If you do a little research, I'm sure you can find a lot of stuff that attracts your interest.  Good luck!"

arizona,2sw4cf,Erronsing,2,Mon Jan 19 07:29:08 2015 UTC,"Phoenix has a very west-coast dress aesthetic, but folks aren't shy to go upscale, either. You can go to a nice restaurant in jeans and flannel, or in business casual, or you can go full on east coast nightlife. Folks aren't going to look at you weird if you show up in casual clothes, but you won't be out of place if you dress up a bit, either.  You should plan to bring some clothes for cooler temps - it can get a bit cooler, especially in the evenings. A light jacket, closed-toes shoes, some pants or ankle-length skirts.  I've been wearing jeans and t-shirts with flip-flops during the days. My wife is a native and dresses a little more warmly because anything under 78F is ""freezing"" to her. :)  As far as church goes, it'll really depend on the denomination/church, but a more relaxed west coast aesthetic isn't uncommon. I usually go to church in jeans and a polo shirt, though folks do dress up more depending on what they're comfortable with."

arizona,2sncj2,Troeltsch,2,Fri Jan 16 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"True, but you can't compare DC and NYC to states, they should be compared to other large cities. DC tends to come in either at the very top or very bottom in comparison with states, because it doesn't have any rural areas like every state does.  edit: removed a word for clarification"
arizona,2sncj2,SmartToaster,2,Fri Jan 16 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"Of course you can. 60% of the state's population lives in Maricopa County and another 15% live in the Tucson metro. Arizona isn't typical of other states, very few people live in ""rural"" areas unlike the South or Midwest. Money spent per pupil is all we're looking at and DC and NYC have some of the highest amount spent with the poorest performing schools."
arizona,2sncj2,ssracer,1 point,Sat Jan 17 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe the funding is separate from spending per pupil, but I recall that the state is in trouble about spending on education facilities too.  Back to court we go I guess.  State supreme court decided on that about twenty years ago with the state losing.  Then the legislature spent the next twenty years chipping away at and getting around the courts decision.  And here we are all over again.  If you're parents are well off and can afford to live in a good neighborhood, and because of the higher property taxes your kids will go to better overall schools.  Poor kids in lower property tax districts get screwed."
arizona,2sncj2,furrowedbrow,1 point,Fri Jan 16 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"You say that like that's unique to AZ. City spending always skews towards the areas from where the funding derives.

arizona,2sncj2,LebirtandJuztiz,2,Fri Jan 16 23:26:18 2015 UTC,"Not much.  It may be in the tens of millions, but AZ needs more like hundreds of millions to bring education funding up to average.  What we need is income tax and corporate tax increases."

I also don't see why this necessarily benefits Arizonans or Americans for that matter. If someone who already spends 9-18 hours of their life `pledging allegiance to the flag, indivisible, under god' doesn't need to take a test confirming their knowledge that the flag is red, white, and blue. As far as having a voting base that understands that the President is the leader of the Executive branch and can sign treaties, it should be important to note that a 60% is not too much better than flipping a coin, and students will get the opportunity to take the test multiple times--further a High School Diploma or equivalent is not necessary to be able to vote.  This is just a symbolic tax waste that adds inefficiencies to an already overly politicized education system. If politicians want to affect real change in the education system, they should be working on ways to standardize programming lessons so that high school students can graduate with a modern, employable skill."

He has been clean for over a year now but not from suboxones. For those of you who don't know, it blocks, or more so, tricks the receptors that makes them crave, disappear. Buy the biggest problem we face as a state, is not having the treatment to cure this truly horrific addiction.   We as a country need to take a step back and look and observe this epidemic. We treat heroin addiction like any other addiction and we have to stop that. Treatment? There isn't any. It's the same treatment that we ""tested"" on the 60's. We haven't changed anything and the overdose rate after NA is truly heartwrenching.   Then, when they want to quit, they have to illegally buy suboxones in order to maintain a normal life. So, not only do they worry about being clean, they worry about breaking the law.   Please remember; no drug addict wants to grow up that way. I don't blame any one for being addicted to anything in this country because it is handed to us like candy. All the prescribtion drugs being promoted and how little awareness there is, it's no wonder it's an epidemic."

Downtown Phoenix, Tempe (although they are doing major construction right now and will probably be there when you get here), Mesa and Gilbert are all fun. DT Gilbert has some of my favorite resturaunts one being Liberty Market. When you head up north, again, Camp Verde is really nothing. Instead, depending on which way you take up or down, stop at Montezuma Castle and Well. Also, Sedona, though expensive, is amazing to experience. The culture there is amazing. Talk about art central. On your way to Flagstaff there is a wonderful hiking trail called Oak Creek Canyon. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Also, if you can, go to Tonto National Bridge, I was blown away by what we found there. 20+ years and didn't know it exsisted. And only about a two hour hike.   Whenever you get the chance, or even if it is up for grabs - I would take a Southern Trip to Arizona. Personally, I find more history in the South."

Do you mean the state constitution?  It is also worth noting that, under this definition, Arizona risked statehood essentially the moment it became a state. President Taft would not sign the law making Arizona a state until Arizona removed provisions of the state constitution allowing for recall of judges. After becoming a state, Arizona almost immediately amended the state constitution to allow for judicial recall, then voted against Taft in the 1912 election. So I really doubt statehood is at risk."

The point of the exercise is to show people that in fact unpredictable shit happens out in the field and you only have a few seconds to react. The pastor failed by firing in the second scenario and the department made him aware of that.   The local affiliate (misleading title) focused a little heavy on the fact that the pastor pulled the trigger. This distracted from the main point - that while police departments may need reform and retraining its a hell of a lot easier to talk about it from our couches.

arizona,2s4kkb,A_Soft_Narwhal,2,Mon Jan 12 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"Why solar energy isn't just a ""duh"" solution for Arizona.  (1) Solar panels lose efficiency as they heat up and around 120-140 that loss can be pretty dramatic.  (2) dust, like from haboobs, also create a thin layer of loss on top of the panels.  (3) residential roof top solar! One of the biggest problems with solar is the rooftop solution. The current solution doesn't meet the needs of the home one and still makes them dependent on the grid (80% independent - 320 days out of the year). This leaves the power companies holding the bag on costly redundancies - the more homes that get them the less efficient current power plants become (not turning on peaker plants is good, throttling back base load is bad). People also want the full retail rate payback when they sell back, but intermittently buy and sell. This creates an animosity between providers and solar residents. The maintain a line to their house and rarely use it but don't want to pay a premium to stay on the grid - meanwhile the power companies don't want to pay any credits. It's insane.  (4) middle of desert plants - putting plants in the desert produce power at an expensive rate and aren't favored by power companies because of their cost.   The solution: Large scale Urban Environment Solar (LUES). What is it? Well I just made it up, but the concept is simple. Solar panels can provide more than just power. Providing shade for instance to a building and parking lot (not just roof mounted, but with sufficient gap) will reduce the cooling load and decrease the thermal storage of the concrete, which when applied on a large scale will help reduce the heat island effect. Placed over canals the panels will provide an immediate DC source for canal equipment as well as limiting the water loss due to radiation. Combine solar panels with local subsidies for people to get electric cars and suddenly you have a place to dump all that ""extra"" electricity that may be generated. The utilities own (at least partially) and maintain the system, but everyone benefits - even those that can't put solar panels on their home."

A foreign entity is a corporation or LLC that was formed or created in a state or country other than Arizona. Entities created under federal or Indian tribal law are also considered foreign entities.

arizona,2rk9qp,LebirtandJuztiz,2,Wed Jan 7 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"It's terribly frustrating the way the state handles education. The legislators obviously feel education is getting too much funding(AZ ranks near the bottom in per student dollars spent) but instead of launching reform to make them more efficient, they just cut funding and expect educators to make reforms on their own. If they want to cut spending how about looking at the fact that there are over 400 separate school districts in AZ each with their own support staff, superintendent, etc. I think a lot of money could be saved by consolidating districts. There are over 65 school districts in Maricopa County alone! Just blindly cutting funding is akin to pulling the rug out from under our kids feet with no one to catch them."
arizona,2rk9qp,theforkofdamocles,-2,Wed Jan 7 01:42:18 2015 UTC,Isn't this reduction due to the increasing number of charter schools opening all over the state? Pretty soon there won't be a need for public schools.

arizona,2rdxb8,worksmalls,1 point,Mon Jan 5 15:12:47 2015 UTC,"I've been here since 1996 and I played music here for well over a decade before giving it up as pointless. Phoenix's music scene is a reason to consider not coming. No matter where I go in the country, no matter how small the town, venue or crowd, I am consistently amazed at how much more energy there is at wherever I am at that isn't Phoenix. When I moved here from a small town in the midwest, I never gave a thought to the idea that playing shows in Phoenix would be significantly different than what I was used to there. But it is/was shocking. It is nearly impossible to excite people in Phoenix. I've never been able to understand it. Even when we would play with national bands, we always felt bad for them because they would be playing to relatively listless, small crowds that actually seemed more annoyed than interested.  Bands don't make it here. Bands that make it from here make it elsewhere. Those bands can get play here and find excited crowds, but only after the fact. Subsequent to them making it, the entire scene shifts its focus to that style of music nearly exclusively, making it extremely difficult to book shows if you are out of genre. When I first got here it was Gin Blossoms style alt-rock. Then it was Bloodhound Gang and ska. Finally, it was Jimmy Eat World's baby punk or nothing.   I have no idea what it is now, but I doubt it's much improved. On the other hand, there are lots of reasons to love the state (mostly outdoorsy ones) so I still love it! :)"

Last Exit is also awesome, but really tiny. It's not that there's nothing, because if you dig you can find it for sure. It's more about the fact that there are towns (and a lot of them) with 1/10 the population and way more impressive music scenes. The past 2/3 years has slowly been changing, but just that, slowly."

I moved here from PA when I was 5 and have lived here almost my whole life, and I can't wait until I can afford to move somewhere rainy-er, odd as it may be, my biggest annoyance is the lack of rain and green in this state. The northern parts of the state (Sedona/Flagstaff) are actually really beautiful in the fall, the rest just kind of fall short of that. The upside to the lack of rain is that when it does rain, most of the time it pours down, which then causes flooding because no one thought to build streets that can sustain rainfall.  Politics in the state are also kind of shitty unless you're conservative.   Driving is also shit since everyone likes to drive like a jackass, stay off the freeways unless you're, well, a jackass.  Everyone is different though, really no way to gauge how much you like it until you try it unfortunately."
arizona,2rdgne,brendanmint,2,Wed Jan 7 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"No, but as someone else commented, I can understand why others might. I am originally from NJ but also lived in FL for 5 years. I moved to AZ about 2 1/2 years ago.   The scenery here is beautiful but I also miss the color green! Stuff like trees and grass. One week of winter was not enough for me and I still can't get used to 75 on Christmas. I miss snow and rainy days (yes, you get them during Monsoon season but out of season they are few and far between).   Yes, the weather is nice during winter but that also means an influx of snowbirds. Which brings tons of traffic (and accidents). They leave when it starts to get hot so you never get the best of both worlds. Summer is unbelievably fucking hot. Yes, it is a dry heat (which I prefer to the humidity) but 120 is miserable no matter what. Also, electric bill in the summer is a bitch.  Cost of living is low, our property taxes are less than a quarter of what we were paying in NJ. Great for younger and older people but we have an 18 month old and another on the way so we want to move back before they start school. AZ is last in public schooling.  Also, political atmosphere is much different than that I'm used to. Very conservative and lots of very religious people.  And I lived right between Philly & NYC and a short drive to Jersey shore. Always something going on. There's definitely stuff to do out here but not what I'm used to. Beach is like a 6 hour drive now.  Anyways, it's definitely not a bad place to live (for reasons others have pointed out) but it's just not for everyone."

So housing the homeless in AZ would be about $337,500,000.     Arizona has a population of about 6,627,000 So if everyone bought enough pot to create $51 worth of profit to the state we could shelter all the state's homeless?   Does that math sound right?

Currently the federal government gives huge tax breaks to the major ISP's to build more infrastructure then the ISP's take their tax cuts and say no and build nothing. Why don't we tax them like we should and use some tax money to promote innovation.

arizona,2qgl2k,tpr1m,4,Sat Dec 27 04:35:27 2014 UTC,"Look, I think the Sheriff is an asshole, and I want to offer a path to citizenship for these folks, but this precedent of changing a law of the country via memo is a vast overstepping of the Executive's power.  This isn't merely an Obama problem, as Bush and other presidents before him have stepped through loopholes in the Constitution to change the actual spirit of the law, but it has been exacerbated by the road-blocking from Republicans and ineffective legislating on behalf of the Democrats.  With other branches of the Executive already shown to circumvent domestic laws in the country (CIA, NSA, etc.) for years now, and the President leading the charge on using these tactics, I really fear we are going down or are already far down a road where the Executive has taken much more power than can be checked by the other two branches.  I know Arpaio's case was thrown out because he couldn't prove any harm that would happen, and I understand and support Obama's view on immigrants in the country, but this governing by loophole is incredibly irresponsible, dangerous, and against the very principles in which this country was founded in. I hope to see more conversation on this topic as we move forward, but I don't see any party taking a moral stance on this as sticking to it would limit their power against the other side."

I can't take it personally, it's not like I wrote the poem on the statue of liberty.    This country was not founded because we came up with the Constitution/Democracy/whatever you call it - it was founded on principles of people not being represented by the Government whose interests they were serving. (TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION) Do you see the parallels?   Or do I have to spell it out for you?    I have no problem with the President executing their power when things devolve into petty partisan politics.  Partisanship was not part of the plan of our founding fathers - and we've been pretty screwed up since before the Civil War.  See Federalist 9 and 10 if you don't believe political parties were never intended to exist and viewed as a scourge to the end game.    Anyways - you were very quick to down-vote, quid-pro-quo, casting aside the ideas you espoused before.    The Constitution is from 1789 and is our second government.  From the Declaration of Independence, listing grievances of the King :   ""He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands""  I believe firmly that the people who outlined a plan for this Nation, on principle, would support the actions of the President even if they seemingly circumvent checks and balances in the system.  But hey, there's the judiciary branch for that and they just said it was kosher.  It's not the legislatures job to check the president, it's the president's job to check the legislature, and the judicial's job to check the executive.  And look how the system worked.  Arpaio is an executive by the way as well, and makes way more questionable decisions that are not sustained by the courts and waste taxpayer money.  He doesn't have a problem with the federal government having too much power, he has a problem with himself not having enough.  I've heard him say ""I just enforce the laws on the books"" and then the Government comes out with a new law, and he says ""I'm going to sue you for coming out with a new law!""."

arizona,2qgl2k,chairmanmow,1 point,Sat Dec 27 13:23:48 2014 UTC,"Yes, we should welcome immigrants. Yes, parties are a scourge (but a mathematical inevitability of our voting system). Yes, the Judiciary should (but hasn't) checked the power of the Executive. Yes, Arpaio is an apallingly power-hungry executive who should have been relieved of his post a long time ago. I agree with all those things, yet I won't allow the circumventing of the spirit of federal law.   I would like to have porous borders, but in reality that doesn't seem to be a sustainable approach for the well-being of the existing citizenry.  The thing is, Arpaio hasn't changed his position. The same laws are on the books. It's the President that has changed the enforcement. There were no laws added, some were just deemed unfeasible. I support the end, but not the means here. As soon as this tactic is used to support means and ends we don't want, many of us celebrating this executive order will be crying foul. Many of us will be crying for impeachment, and we won't receive it on the grounds that this precedent has long been established, and supported by those in power."
arizona,2qgl2k,cipher_six,0,Sat Dec 27 15:39:55 2014 UTC,"But Obama didn't pass a new law. He can't. Only the legislature can. What he did was just declare that he would change how the law would be enforced without actually altering the law itself. This isn't something that is supported by the division of powers. He is trying to change/abolish laws by selective/non-enforcement. You think it's fine and grand now because you agree with the ends. The Republicans have been cautioning against this attitude for some time now, essentially saying ""think about how you'll feel when we're in power--follow the laws now and don't open these doors/set these precedents or regret it later when we're in power."""

arizona,2pzii4,whatever21327,3,Sun Dec 21 17:37:29 2014 UTC,"It's too bad you don't have a 4wheeler because there's a lot of trails on that part of the Rim.  If you're into Mexican food though, make sure you stop by Casa Ramos.  They have some very good food there.  I think just across the highway from Casa Ramos, you'll see one of those places that carves logs and there will be a whole bunch of green spacemen kind of carvings there.  If you can find a native, ask them to tell you about Travis Walton who was abducted by an alien spaceship near Snowflake (they actually made a movie about it).  When they found him several days later, it was next to those phone booths near Casa Ramos (start spooky music here).  I think that story's pretty cool.  On the west side of town (more or less), there's a road called Black Canyon Road.  If you take this road southwards, you enter into the forest (Sitgreaves Natl Forest).  It starts out paved, turns into graded dirt, but small cars can handle it easily.  If you watch for those signs with brown spirals on them, you come across various landmarks.  I think the first one is a cave dwelling made by the Hohokam Americans about 900 years ago.  If you climb up, you can see petroglyphs made by these people.  There's another dwelling with petroglyphs at the next stop also.  It's bigger but it's about a 3/4 mile hike on pretty gentle ground to get at.    As you go further, you hit a ranch and an intersection - I think it's forest road 300 - can't remember.  The ranch is called Legacy Ranch, and it has an absolutely beautiful cabin on it.  The interesting thing about this cabin is that it's not made from Ponderosa Pine, or any wood from the Apache/Sitgreaves forest.  The wood came from British Columbia and the cabin was actually built in Canada and shipped to Heber in 20 semis.  They used to keep all sorts of animals there such as Llamas and ostriches.    Speaking of Ponderosa...  If you make this trip, and stop somewhere in the forest, find a big ponderosa (the big pines that have a reddish color bark).  Now....  Check that nobody's around looking at you and sniff between the plates of bark.  Believe it or not, it smells like vanilla!  That's it.  You just spent the last 3 minutes looking like an idiot, but it's still kinda cool.  On your trip, you'll also notice a lot of horses wondering around.  Those are wild horses, and if you can rope one, it's yours.  Take it home, train it, and bing, bing, bing, you have a pet horse.  Wild horses are kind of a problem up there.  There's too many of them and the last I heard, they were trying to thin them out.  There's a small chance that you can see some deer or elk, but they tend to stay away from the roads where there's a lot of traffic.  Let's see, the last marker before you get to Black Canyon lake is the site where the last 3 men were hung as a result of the Pleasant Valley War.  There are 3 concrete gravestones there.  I think the names are Slott, Scott and Wilson.  It's a longer walk to this site (about a mile or so), but I always enjoyed it.  If you like walking, well worth your time.  Further down is Black Canyon Lake.  It's a very small lake that's been made even smaller by the drought that has been ongoing for more than 10 years.  And, if you keep going in the same direction on that dirt road, you'll see some pretty good scenery, including some pretty spectacular views (I scared the crap out of my mother on this drive.  It was snowy, we were in a 4wheeler, but she was sure we were going to fly off of one of those cliffs).  Finally, the road loops back into the 260 and you'll be about 15 miles west of Heber.  Good drive.  Don't forget to stop by the Red Onion!  Best burgers on the 260, real good people and a good place for lunch.  What else.....  I can't think of anything right now, but if you're only staying a few days, that may be enough.  Good luck.  Edit:  If you're into stories, here's the story of Slott, Scott and Wilson:  http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2012/jan/04/wild-west-rim-country/"

arizona,2p94zt,autowikibot,-1,Mon Dec 15 07:07:18 2014 UTC,"This is a blanket argument and isn't valid.  If police use their eyes when illegally searching your house, that's illegal.  Using eyes (a tool) isn't illegal, it's how you use them that can be illegal.  If police use their eyes when walking on the street and see a crime in progress, that is legal.  Just like simply using the cell-device itself isn't illegal, it's how they use it.  Are they storing location data (phone 123 was here at this time?) or are they intercepting and reading your texts?  Are they even capable of intercepting your texts (sources say not)?  If they're just storing when and what phone connects to it and where, that is basically the same as ALPR systems that they use today (source if you feel like reading).  If they're intercepting text messages and scanning them for keywords that could indicate a crime, then that's definitely an illegal search.  And to be clear on where I stand on the actual opinion of use, I do not support agencies casting dragnets out to see what they catch such as illegally searching phone communication looking for a crime.  BUT I do support a scenario such as the gunmen taking hostages in Australia, and the police using a device to potentially ""listen"" to the hostages' phones to gain an edge on the bad-guys. There are other scenarios where unwarranted use can be good.  Perhaps if they have a list of known sex-offenders that aren't allowed within 1000 feet of a school, but a school has told police of children seeing a creepy man near the school frequently.  Well if they setup a van next to the school ""listening"" for any of those offender's numbers and catch one.  I'm ok with that."

United States of article  Automatic number plate recognition:       In the United States, ANPR systems are more commonly referred to as ALPR (Automatic License Plate Reader/Recognition) technology, due to differences in language (i.e., ""number plates"" are referred to as ""license plates"" in American English)  Mobile ANPR use is widespread among US law enforcement agencies at the city, county, state and federal level. According to a 2012 report by the Police Executive Research Forum, approximately 71% of all US police departments use some form of ANPR.  Mobile ANPR is becoming a significant component of municipal predictive policing strategies and intelligence gathering,  as well as for recovery of stolen vehicles, identification of wanted felons, and revenue collection from individuals who are delinquent on city or state taxes or fines, or monitoring for ""Amber Alerts"". Successfully recognized plates may be matched against databases including ""wanted person"", ""protection order"", missing person, gang member, known and suspected terrorist, supervised release, immigration violator, and National Sex Offender lists.  In addition to the real-time processing of license plate numbers, ALPR systems in the US collect (and can indefinitely store) data from each license plate capture. Images, dates, times and GPS coordinates can be stockpiled and can help place a suspect at a scene, aid in witness identification, pattern recognition or the tracking of individuals.  An early, private sector mobile ANPR application has been applications for vehicle repossession and recovery ), although the application of ANPR by private companies to collect information from privately owned vehicles or collected from private property (for example, driveways) has become an issue of sensitivity and public debate.  Other ALPR uses include parking enforcement, and revenue collection from individuals who are delinquent on city or state taxes or fines. The technology is often featured in the reality TV show Parking Wars featured on A&E Network. In the show, tow truck drivers and booting teams use the ALPR to find delinquent vehicles with high amounts of unpaid parking fines.

I could go on to discuss the nuances of this position, but your usage of the word ""probably"" in characterizing my position hints at an intellectual dishonesty that doesn't give me confidence those nuances would be received in good faith.  As to your contention that the only reason this device can be used is to generate evidence to be presented in court, I can only encourage you to think a little harder. As you mentioned above, the device was supposedly developed for the military and ""intelligence community"". These are not the type of people who create and handle court admissible evidence. In police hands, I can very easily see it being used to provide the tips that fuel further no-knock raids. Perhaps parallel reconstruction can be used to justify whatever they want to do.

Police could use lock picks and randomly search many houses until it found something that would ""fuel"" a no-knock raid the exact same way.  Here is what you don't understand. Police agencies are essentially businesses.  At least with the lock-picking, a rogue cop could search a few houses, but there is no way an agency would make a crime-fighting strategy to have several officers searching many houses at random. I think you can agree that it would be so obviously illegal to every person involved that they can't have a bunch of officers running around doing that.  And with a $200k+ device, a rogue cop can't just take it out of the office and stick it in his car and go snooping.  Several officers would be involved in its use at any time.  So to imply that several officers would all knowingly search random phone data looking for something to ""fuel"" a no-knock raid is ludicrous.

arizona,2p4zm8,SDr6,10,Sat Dec 13 02:26:40 2014 UTC,"Serious question: have there been any findings of any archaeo in any NEPA reviews of the area? I think there are two cacti that will have to be moved (Arizona hedgehog cactus) to Boyce Thompson, but the document I see says if they find more- more than 20, anyway- US Fish and Wildlife will have to step in rather than just relocate them all.  I have to admit, I don't like the idea of losing Oak Flat Campground at all. But from an endangered species perspective, it looks pretty straightforward. If there's anything on archaeological findings in the area, I'd like to hear about it."
arizona,2p4zm8,mr_staberind,9,Sat Dec 13 03:43:00 2014 UTC,"Great question.    None of the news sources are reporting on the real issues here, and it feels like all of the media does not understand the laws that are relevant in this case.  On the cultural side, there is one documented site eligible for inclusion on the National Register (Apache Leap), but the remainder of the forest service land in question has yet to be surveyed.  What Flake's amendment does is bypass the archaeological surveys required by law when ever such a federal land-swap takes place. There are no existing NEPA reviews, because Congress has stalled Rio Tinto in their efforts to bypass these reviews for past 10 years.    Not to put to fine a point on it, but there are a number of acres worth of  reasons why Rio Tinto has been fighting the required archaeological surveys for 10 years now.  They could have started mining years ago if they had only agreed to follow NEPA in the first place.    So, I guess I have to ask, why do you think Rio Tinto is spending years fighting this all out in Congress rather than simply complying with the law?"
arizona,2p4zm8,QuestionSleep86,5,Sat Dec 13 05:06:20 2014 UTC,"So let's take a look at this.  What exactly are we getting in exchange for more than a hundred billion dollars of copper?  If the tax revenue is estimated at 20 bil, well I don't know how that tax process works but if that's at 20% tax (I know it's a dumb rough estimate) the copper is probably worth 100 billion dollars right?  Now that land we'll get in exchange for it.  It's probably somewhat comparable undeveloped land, but it was probably passed over when this reserve was set up for a reason, and I don't know/am too fucking pissed to research what that land looks like.  But, let's pull more numbers from our asses here and say it's worth 2k an acre.  So 5k acres at 2k a pop... 10 million bucks...  for enough copper to produce a quarter of the nations demand.  Stupid fucking piece of shit.  And the Apache and whoever else, and the environment and yadda, yadda... well to be honest that's the more important part to me, but HOLY FUCKING SHIT!  I get that you can't just set the state into the business of copper mining, but the land and the resources still belonged to all of us under federal law.  I'm pretty sure we're allowed to ask a fair fucking price.  This shit sounds like when South American countries sell their entire national water supply to try to fix their budget bottom line.  McCain needs to GO.  *How about if it's an absolute economic necessity to slurp that fucking copper out of the ground, get your shit in order and find a way to set it up so that the mining rights get set in a public auction.  That seems smarter than shoehorning federal legislation to give it to whoever you personally see fit.  Might be less kickbacks that way though."

Its like if you were hungry and didn't feel like going to the store so you trade your whole house for a sandwich.  Maybe the federal govt can't mine the copper itself, but the mining rights could be auction like we do with oil rights on federal land all the time.

arizona,2p4ovq,QuestionSleep86,4,Sat Dec 13 18:32:21 2014 UTC,"Calm down there with the caps, Alex Jones.  Here's a much money reasonable reason: Money, jobs, and votes.  There is no doubt McCain gets donations from the mining industry and that's good for him. So that's one part of it.  But go belly up to a bar in Superior, Kearny, Globe, or Winkleman, and you will meet a lot of weathered men whose lives depend on the mines continuing to work, and have spent years concerned on whether that will continue until they can retire. You'll meet business owners and families whose economy depends on the workers that come through those towns and live around the mine. Mining brings jobs. Mining creates local economies. Mining creates tax revenue at every point that the payrolls trickle through the communities. Supporting our state's economy and protecting the jobs of its residents is a big part of mccain's job.  I don't know how I feel about the whole thing, but I know how those drinking partners felt about it. It's not as simple as ""evil old man gives sacred indian land to evil foreign corporation"". Hell, most of the workers I encountered were Apache."
arizona,2p4ovq,In_the_heat,1 point,Sat Dec 13 20:06:24 2014 UTC,"So your telling me playing by the rules and letting the mining rights be bid on would prevent local miners from being hired?  Explain that shit to me buddy, sorry if I lose my cool but this is out of control.  You don't have to tell me about mines closing I was a little boy but I was in Oracle when the San Manuel mine closed, and I remember what it was like for everyone.  The problem is that it's federal land so if we followed the rules all the Americans that entrusted that land to the federal govt would all get to take their fair share, but McCain wants it all to go to the AZ state budget, so he is backdooring a bill in such a way that someone would have opposed our national defense allocations to stop him, and getting a miniscule fraction of the true value of that copper so that it all goes where he wants it.  Now maybe that IS a win for the Arizona budget, but its not fair and it's not right.  Doing it the right way, in other words letting the federal govt that our mothers, fathers, and grandparents entrusted that land to, doesn't mean it can't be mined at all.  You know federal lands get leased for oil and mining.  That would still mean same number of workers here and the same operation.  There is a reason why he is fighting both sides of the aisle to get this through and that the primary opposition mentioned in the Mother Jones article is Republican, and it ain't cause he is a ""maverick"".  It's because this is tantamount to pawning a piece of America to fix local budget mismanagement.  Just imagine it on a small scale you and a friend went in together on buying a box(the land).  You find out that there is a diamond ring in the box so you guilt your friend into letting you have the whole thing(bundling the bill in defense appropriations), and and then trade the ring and box for two empty boxes(they get 2k acres of land with enough copper to supply a quarter of the countries demand, and we get 5k acres of campgrounds).  Now you seem like a reasonable person so you tell me if you really think that's right.  Don't you hide on that god damn "" I'm not sure"" shit because this is our country and if we don't watch our asses at every turn we'll get stripped clean."
arizona,2p4ovq,QuestionSleep86,2,Sat Dec 13 20:36:38 2014 UTC,"I'm reminded of the commercial ""That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.""  There are a few outright lies on the opposition side: This isn't a purchase of land. It's not Apache Leap. These two points kill a lot of the hype.  You speak of a bidding process. Anyone could conduct the same transaction for this property, but there is not a reason for them to. Resolution already owns the mining rights in this area. They already have a substantial operation and investment in the area. For another company to operate there they would have to have a much larger parcel for their operations, whereas resolution already has a massive operation and owns lands intertwined with the lands they want to receive. It would be, logistically, much harder for another company to buy the 3.5 square mile area and develop it than for resolution, who literally can just move their equipment a mile.  But this isn't a purchase, it's a land swap, which is much more common for this kind of transaction. Resolution owns land that the federal government finds valuable (four times the amount that resolution wants from the government) and trades this land. This includes riparian areas along the San Pedro River. There is a standard review process that is used to determine that similar value is being exchanged. You may ask, why not just buy it? Because national forest land is a public asset, a public trust. We don't want land for money, we want land. That's what the exchange does, retains public lands, albeit different ones. If another company really wants that land and has comparable land to trade and goes through the entire process too, they can have it. Save your shekels, but some land they government wants, and you too can own Oak Creek.  You ask me to actually give an opinion and, like I said, I'm not sure how I feel. On one hand, I hate this type of mining. It destroys the land, scenic vistas, vegetation and wildlife. On the other hand it is good for the area economically and we have an insatiable desire for copper. It's a history part of arizona (remember the 5 C's? Man... First grade). Generally I'd have to say I'm not for the type of mining they want to do, but I'm not against the land trade. I'm more frustrated by conversations that have a good cause that use lies and half truths to try to make people be on their side, like a lot of the articles I've seen saying things like ""Sacred Apache Lands stolen, given to foreigners"". Not sacred, not Apache, not stolen, and let's be xenophobia why not."
arizona,2p4ovq,In_the_heat,1 point,Sun Dec 14 00:58:01 2014 UTC,"So you don't think that the copper in the ground falls under the same public trust?  Do you not think that what is by their own estimation enough copper to generate 25% of our annual copper demand is worth more than a measly five thousand acres of undeveloped land?  Do they have us by the balls since they own the surrounding land or are we in a position of bargaining power?  Even to set up a new operation they're talking about something in the range of $100 billion dollars worth of copper down there.  I think someone might find that worth a fairly significant investment.  So yeah we need to maintain the park, but it seems to me that mountain of copper is a federal asset in the public trust as well, and I REALLY don't think that four times the amount of land even comes close to covering it.  Even if that land were to be valued at say $5000 dollars an acre it would still only be $25m, so we'd be selling that copper that belongs to the American people at about .4% of the value THE VERY PEOPLE WE ARE SELLING IT TO claim it is worth.  I'm making my estimate of the total value of the copper, which as you have pointed out is part of federal public trust, in other words belonging to me and you, based on Resolutions estimate that they will pay $20m in taxes on it, and a super rough ballpark of 20% tax rate.  Meaning $100bn in copper.  Now as one final point, if this really would have been an easy bid for this mining company, why was it shoehorned behind closed doors into must pass piece of legislation?  You would think that if it is as you say and nobody else would be interested in trying to develop a mine there, then they would push for an auction and lowball the bid, safe in the knowledge there was no competitor in position to outbid them, due to the higher setup cost for others."
arizona,2p4ovq,QuestionSleep86,1 point,Sun Dec 14 01:41:56 2014 UTC,"So you don't think that the copper in the ground falls under the same public trust?     Thats a separate issue and that's not at hand here because Resolution already owns the mineral rights beneath Oak Flat. They now want to exercise that. These are two separate issues. You can own land and not own the mineral rights and vice-versa. This is why someone can drill a mine that encompasses miles underground and not own all the land above it.   So yeah we need to maintain the park, but it seems to me that mountain of copper is a federal asset in the public trust as well   You're too late to this party because this issue was settled decades ago when the mineral rights were sold. Whether there is five dollars with of copper or a trillion, it already belongs to them.   and I REALLY don't think that four times the amount of land even comes close to covering it.      For the land? Absolutely it does. For the copper, no, but that's not what is being sold and they already own those rights.   I'm making my estimate of the total value of the copper, which as you have pointed out is part of federal public trust, in other words belonging to me and you   The land belongs to you and me, the mineral rights don't.  TLDR: Land ownership, water rights, mineral rights... All separate things. You can have one but not the other. Resolution owns the mineral rights but not the land, wants to trade land they don't want for land they do want. No one else can buy that land and mine it without the mineral rights, and Resolution can't put a giant hole of the surface without the surface rights. They could mine from the side into the vein but that would be harder for them and less safe.  Surface rights =/= mineral rights"

They are among the largest of dry caverns in the United States. Dry caverns are a rarity in that as little as 3% of caverns in the world are dry. Because of this fact, stalagmites and stalactites are very few in numbers. Air comes into the caverns from the Grand Canyon through 60 miles (97 km) of limestone caves. Scientists were curious as to how far the caverns extended and looked for a safe means of finding out. Rather than explore the canyons, which could take years, red smoke flares were ignited by University of Arizona students, and two weeks later red smoke was seen protruding from vents, near Supai, AZ, in the Grand Canyon, thus the name. The caverns are enormous, with measurements showing that the length of 3 football fields could fit snugly within its boundaries.

Most of this information should be in the ticket itself. You may have to pay additional fees if you have to request a replacement for your ticket.

arizona,2p1ws0,nsgiad,1 point,Fri Dec 12 05:32:56 2014 UTC,"Not in Arizona, the ARS states that citations have to be served in person. The notice they send is a waiver to your right to be served in person. So basically if you fill it out you are saying you're guilty."
arizona,2p1ws0,PCPhD,1 point,Tue Dec 16 00:29:36 2014 UTC,"There's probably a website on the notice where you can go to verify the charge. If you've already done that I'm pretty sure they can use that as proof that you received the complaint. So your two choices are to pay up, either by sending in payment or requesting a court date, or ignore it. If you choose to ignore it they could try to hand deliver a summons or possibly issue a bench warrant. Most likely what would happen is the next time you try to renew your license or your vehicle registration they'll tell you your license or registration has been suspended pending payment of the fine. Of course, they could just choose to drop the issue altogether but I wouldn't hold my breath for that. I got one in Tucson and just paid it. There's no points and it seemed easier to just pay it than risk getting arrested one night during an unrelated traffic stop."

But it's often (like, December mornings, then January and February, maybe a little of March) cool enough that wearing one is possible as a fashion item. Is it the most practical gift for someone in Phoenix? No...but gifts don't have to always be practical."
arizona,2opf7g,Lapulta,1 point,Tue Dec 9 14:57:46 2014 UTC,Honestly it also depends on if they're a native or not.  This winter's been very mild so far but it might get pretty chilly eventually.  I have seen folks wearing pretty heavy coats and scarves in early January and I figure they've been here long enough for their blood to thin out.  Also if they ride a motor- or bicycle they might wear more clothing when it's cold.
arizona,2opf7g,Grokking_Fullness,1 point,Tue Dec 9 03:59:21 2014 UTC,"Personally I don't like my neck to get 'cold', so I wear a light scarf when it's still 65 degrees out, but most of the other responses are correct as I'm an odd case. In Northern Arizona and the high spots, it does get really cold - and even in the middle section if we have a good deep freeze - but the scarf will probably be worn for four months out of twelve. So weigh those options and see what you decide!  Good luck with your wonderful scarf giving~!  (I don't trust the person who says they don't wear a coat. They're probably a foreigner from up north~ /pats /u/zweible   shhhhhhhh, hush, we will convert you to coat wearing. we are patient, my precious. we will wait.)"

arizona,2oldwf,meestersuperman1,8,Sun Dec 7 23:32:19 2014 UTC,"I grew up in Prescott and have lived in Flagstaff for the past five years.   Prescott is typically warmer than Flagstaff by a large margin in the winter months. Flagstaff gets very cold from January to March.  Prescott is warmer in the summer; typically high 80s to mid 90s.  Even though it's warmer, I feel it has less extremes than Flagstaff.   Flagstaff is very liberal. There's a large hippie/hipster crowd and the town is filled with young college students, especially the west side. Prescott is the opposite. It's a large retirement community with much more conservative views.    Flagstaff is pretty much exclusively forest, while Prescott has a nice mix of everything. The Granite Dells and various lakes about town are wonderful and not far from reach."
arizona,2oldwf,pap55,3,Mon Dec 8 00:51:19 2014 UTC,Flagstaff is sorta like the liberal red headed step child of Arizona. Lots of young outdoorsy people here. NAU definitely has a large hipster-ish scene.   The weather here is great. Still low 50's during the day and 20s at night right now. I'm from Michigan and love the mild winters here in flag
arizona,2oldwf,Grokking_Fullness,-3,Mon Dec 8 00:21:02 2014 UTC,"Would someone who has pretty typical conservative (Tea Party-ish) views feel unwelcome? I know I do in Chicago, or SF and NY.."
arizona,2oldwf,AngerSwines,1 point,Mon Dec 8 00:34:32 2014 UTC,Old conservative guy checking in. Flagstaff would welcome you with open arms. Flagstaff might as well be two different towns. College liberal and everyone else. Your largest issue with either town is finding work. Good luck in our state!
arizona,2oldwf,BoogieBot,-1,Mon Dec 8 00:55:03 2014 UTC,"Thanks! It looks breathtakingly beautiful and the weather seems great. All this ""liberal college town"" stuff was starting to worry me.   My grandmother lives in Nevada and I plan to go visit her soon, so when I do that I will take a 2 or 3 day car trip down to AZ to check things out."

arizona,2oldwf,GrimLittleBones,2,Tue Dec 9 16:24:21 2014 UTC,"I haven't lived in Flagstaff, but I've grown up in Prescott.  I believe both communities have a mix of young college liberals and an older conservative community.  Prescott will usually have a hand full of days that reach 100 a year.  It is currently 64 right now according to my outdoor thermometer."
arizona,2oldwf,PPKA2757,1 point,Sun Dec 7 23:49:10 2014 UTC,Well every community of any size is a mixed bag of course! Does it feel like a more liberal town?  64 sounds great right now! It's freezing.  It doesn't get hot like Phoenix right?
arizona,2oldwf,teh_capn,1 point,Sun Dec 7 23:52:15 2014 UTC,Not as hot as Phoenix.  We're usually about 15degrees cooler than Phoenix.  I would say the town is more conservative than not.
arizona,2oldwf,sweetnwild,1 point,Mon Dec 8 02:36:35 2014 UTC,"I grew up in Flagstaff for 12 years and I've visited Prescott a few times. I couldn't tell you the political views of the towns and unfortunately my opinion on the two will obviously be biased. Personally though I'd recommend Flagstaff, the weather was always wonderful throughout the seasons and the town is always welcoming and friendly. Plus I think it has more to offer, but again that's just my opinion. Good choice on avoiding Mesa and Phoenix, the heat sucks.   Though I think if you haven't already and if you can afford to do so, try visiting the towns you're interested in so you can form your own opinion. Get a feel for the area and talk to locals currently living there."
arizona,2oldwf,PPKA2757,1 point,Mon Dec 8 00:56:43 2014 UTC,"Checking in from Phoenix! I grew up in Scottsdale and have lived in the valley most of my life. It doesn't get much more conservative than living here if you're moving to Arizona. I know the heat sounds scary, but it's really not terrible. Yes, it does get hot 100+ degrees account for a large chunk of the summer, but unless you plan to get a job in manual labor that requires you to be outside all day, you really don't notice it as you are at home or work all day anyway. Also, we have mountains and while they're not as tall/cool as other places (I lived in SLC for 2 years, the wasatch are breathtaking), they are still a cool view to wake up to every morning! The big city offers a great job market (more than Prescott or Flag by a long shot) so keep that in mind. Our ""winter"" is composed of 65 in the day, dropping to 50 at night, which is great (pool parties year round!). I'd look into the Phoenix metro area more if I were you, keep an open mind!  Also I saw in a comment that you're gay, according to a few of my gay friends, downtown actually has a few really cool gay bars, and the night life in old town Scottsdale and by ASU is really awesome. Much more to offer than flagstaff, and for sure Prescott."
arizona,2oldwf,dhg,-9,Mon Dec 8 03:31:34 2014 UTC,"I actually do work in manual labor, I'm an electrician! I hate the heat man. My nana lives in Vegas and my parents owned a vacation house in South FL while I was growing up and I cannot deal with those kind of temperatures!!  I'm in a relationship already (he will be coming, obviously!) so no need for a ""scene"" or bars, I would actually like to avoid it. Also, the amount of illegals in the Phoenix metro scares the crap outta me. No sir, Northern AZ > Phoenix for me."

arizona,2ohy4l,dragnandy,5,Sat Dec 6 22:46:23 2014 UTC,As soon as you are employed you need to have an Arizona license and vehicle registration. Otherwise if you get pulled over for something they may give you a ticket for resident with out of state plates.
arizona,2ohy4l,tybo578,2,Sat Dec 6 23:11:26 2014 UTC,"Yep. You don't have a particularly long time to do it. I got a ticket for having the wrong address on an in-state license and while they will dismiss it in court if you prove you changed it you should save yourself the hassle.   It's pretty easy and the system here is rather user friendly. After you go in to get a license, you can use the ServiceAZ website to renew and register to vote or change your address.   Regardless of where you are living, I would recommend going to one of the MVDs in the suburbs. They tend to have a lot fewer people at any given time."
arizona,2ohy4l,austinmiles,1 point,Sat Dec 6 23:17:12 2014 UTC,"You have 10 days to change your address if you already have your Arizona license. As far as moving to the state there is a grace period, but if you get a job you have to get your stuff right away."
arizona,2ohy4l,tybo578,2,Thu Dec 11 04:45:41 2014 UTC,You're going to find your registration fees are lower than Cali. and you're really gonna like how long your driver's license is vaild for. I have to renew mine in 2024 but then I'm an old man already. eta:  You'll need to do an initial vehicle inspection at DMV and emissions but not near as intrusive as your prior state.
arizona,2ohy4l,semperfimac,4,Sat Dec 6 23:19:06 2014 UTC,That license renewal length surprised me as well. In other states when my ID gets checked people will occasionally question the ID because of it.
arizona,2ohy4l,thedeepfriedboot,2,Sun Dec 7 01:46:50 2014 UTC,"Ha.  I usually just say,""Yeah, I hope they keep it that way until I hit 65 then they should check me every 6 months until they bury me."""
arizona,2ohy4l,semperfimac,1 point,Sun Dec 7 02:31:32 2014 UTC,Somehow I feel like the long driver's license expiration time is some sort of capiutalation to the older crowd (Sun City).

The message is about police brutality over all. For some of us, it is also a racial issue. We want change. Majority of us do not hate all cops(aside from the assorted assholes who lump themselves in with us). We want there to be accountability, proper training, and proper repercussions when something illegal or wrong has been done by an officer. The rest of the country is standing up, so we are standing with them."
arizona,2ogx8e,121381,1 point,Sat Dec 6 23:32:30 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry that one of us acted that way. The large majority of us are peaceful and do not want to cause damage to anyone.

arizona,2ogx8e,mchandleraz,6,Sat Dec 6 20:16:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah. No. That is not cool at all. We try to actively control the wild cards that show up. Especially because it makes us look bad.

While you're there, if you and your wife enjoy wine, check out the Verde Valley Wine Trail. Some of my favorites are Page Springs Cellars in Cornville, Arizona Stronghold Vineyards and Pillsbury Wine Company in Cottonwood, Caduceus Cellars in Jerome, and Four-Eight Wineworks in Clarkdale. They're all within about 25 minutes of eachother and only about 25 minutes from Sedona.  If you can't make it to Northern AZ Wine Country, about 1.5 hours south-east of Tucson is the town of Willcox where you can visit vineyards producing over 75% of Arizona's wine grapes.  There are also a ton of great restaurants all over the state, too many to list here. If you want any recommendations, feel free to send me a message."
arizona,2o1wvr,mpwkeyper,3,Tue Dec 2 16:21:08 2014 UTC,I second this. Just be prepared to shell out some cash nothing in Sedona is cheap as far as food and stores. The vortex hikes are gorgeous

If you don't mind spending some cash on incredible accommodations though, L'Auberge de Sedona is the best place to stay in Sedona in my opinion. The cottages are comfortable, romantic, and have an incredible view. Also, the restaurant is world-class. It is pricey, but worth it if even if you don't hit it big in Vegas.  Now, if you lose your shorts in Vegas, check out Airbnb for a place to stay in either Cottonwood, Cornville, or Jerome. My wife and I looked recently and there were some great-looking places available for ~$100-$150/night."

arizona,2o1wvr,YourWebcamIsOn,5,Tue Dec 2 19:51:23 2014 UTC,"Sedona's been covered, and is a standard response. If you want to do a couple of cool hikes on your way from Sedona to Tucson, you could hit up Prescott and hike Thumb Butte (1-2 hrs)-very cool view from up there.  An hour south of Sedona is a weird little place called Arcosanti, not sure if you'd be interested in that. Right off of I-17. Disclaimer: I haven't been there in years, but it looks like it's still the same.  On your way through Phoenix you can hike Papago Park and get a cool view of all of the Valley, planes landing/taking off from the airport,  and it has the awesome Phoenix Zoo as well as a Desert Botanical garden immediately nearby.  Depending on when you come through in May, it should also be warm enough to tube the Salt River, near Phoenix. the water is snow meltoff, so you'll want the air temp to be well above 80!"

You must be accompanied by a Navajo guide in order to tour the canyon. This was the tour company we've used before. I've been on the all day tour a few times now and think its fantastic. The Grand Canyon is huge and almost too big for us to take in and fully appreciate. Canyon De Chelly is much more accessible in my opinion.   It might be worth your while to check it out. Don't expect the Navajo Nation to be glizty and touristy. Obviously there is a lot of poverty on the reservation so don't expect it to look like Sedona or Scottsdale. But in no way should that prevent anyone from visiting. I think its one of our most beautiful places in AZ and well worth anyone's time."

arizona,2ny366,Van-to-the-V,3,Mon Dec 1 21:36:58 2014 UTC,"Getting involved in the local metal scene is kind of a Goth passive ability I get by default since highschool. Look up some local shows, mosh hard, talk to people between bands and find your way to the after party would probably be your best way in from the outside. Have fun and make friends, we are an accepting bunch. This is incidentally also a way to start getting into the recreation of friendly fisticuffs. If you like folkmetal, there is quite the community surrounding a band known as Adavant consisting of a healthy chunk of the local metal talent.   If you are the kinky type there are plenty of fetish events hosted thought the year that at this point mysteriously drop into my inbox. Fetlife.com Is a great place to start.   Cupcake is a monthly fetish themed dance party. I am not one for dancing, I go for the company.   The body mod scene thrives here with the world famous Steve Hayworth residing in our humble town of Gilbert. He hosts live suspensions at his home and many come from afar to join in the festivities.   The Fightclub Sadisco events were awesome but unfortunately discontinued.

arizona,2nx3va,DontShitOnKitty,2,Mon Dec 1 23:17:59 2014 UTC,Lived in AZ for 3 1/2 years and never heard of an earthquake or a fault line going through there until now. Are quakes common in that part of AZ?
arizona,2nx3va,jadraxx,7,Mon Dec 1 16:23:01 2014 UTC,"There are faults scattered throughout the state, though most of them are very rarely active. The Rim is a historically intensely active region, geologically speaking. All those hilly regions as you drive up to Flag from Phoenix? Ancient Lava flows. There are thousands of volcanoes scattered all over the state, and the San Francisco volcanic field is still capable of activity. Sunset Crater last erupted in the 11th century, and is dormant, but not extinct. There are several fields that are capable of new eruptions, but they're relatively quiet most of the time. I grew up in Yuma, and we had a good quake every 5 years or so, mostly from the volcanic fields in Northern Mexico.  TL;DR, Yes, there are faults all over the state, with the potential to be active. No, they aren't very active, but they do give the occasional small rumble."
arizona,2nx3va,fatalifeaten,3,Mon Dec 1 16:44:23 2014 UTC,Interesting. I knew about the lava fields and such because I use to climb at Oak Flats/Queen Creek outside of Superior. Learning about this knowledge makes me wish I traveled the state more when I lived in Tucson. Made it to Flag but never Sedona for some reason...
arizona,2nx3va,jadraxx,2,Mon Dec 1 16:49:30 2014 UTC,I've lived in AZ all my life and this is the first I've heard of an earth quake happing here. We have experienced after shock from CA  earthquakes.

Far enough to be relatively safe and family friendly.  Really hot, but at least you don't have to shovel the heat out of your driveway.  Get used to being around lots of Mormons."
arizona,2nyked,finelife,4,Mon Dec 1 19:10:14 2014 UTC,Gilbert is growing very fast as well. It is putting in a bunch of new restaurants and businesses that are making it a really big hotspot

arizona,2nyked,fuzzyboxlvr,1 point,Mon Dec 1 22:04:29 2014 UTC,You understand that Chandler has roughly the same concentration of Mormons that Gilbert does right? Gilbert is about 13 percent and Chandler is about 12 percent.

arizona,2nyked,ChewWork,5,Tue Dec 2 02:26:50 2014 UTC,"The ""best"" city is the one where you will be closest to work. Chances are you will be more productive in your job and one less commuter of congested freeways."
arizona,2nyked,LebirtandJuztiz,3,Tue Dec 2 01:20:15 2014 UTC,This is the only correct answer.
arizona,2nyked,h4rpur,3,Mon Dec 8 21:48:28 2014 UTC,"Lots of options here.  Let's start by narrowing it down to the Phoenix Metro area.  Flagstaff, Tucson etc are further away and their own single city so I'd assume you would have specified neighborhoods in those cities as your question instead.  Do you have any idea where her family is or how close you want to be?  I've lived here my whole life but I've never actually done the math but just ballparking, maybe 60 miles across and almost as far north/south.  That's from East Mesa to West(gate) Phoenix.  There are a lot of cities connected to the Phoenix Metro area and even more neighborhoods/parts from each city to choose from. I'll list my top areas and why's for you. One big plus is that most of our streets are laid out like a grid. and the Freeways for the most part are either straight thru or one giant loop.  So even on the outskirts/edges of the valley, you can get anywhere with ease.  Traffic can be bad going into PHX in the AM and out of it in the PM but nothing compared to LA or anything.  *Quick edit: I know NOTHING about schools from a primary to secondary education standpoint besides my own perceptions growing up here.  Ahwatukee has a couple of nice high schools. So does Scottsdale. Stay away from most of Phoenix High schools save a couple of private ones (St. Mary's, Xavier/Brophy).  Southern area (Chandler, South Tempe, Gilbert, Queen Creek, San Tan) - If you want to be more centrally located, Tempe and Northwestern Chandler are closer to Phoenix and therefor not too far from some sporting events and major hubs like ASU, Skyharbor Airport etc.  If I had to choose from here I would say Chandler has some nice areas, Gilbert as stated below is newer and has some great bang for your buck houses.  Both are very family friendly. I find Gilbert has a lot of cookie cutter neighborhoods that are cheap and awesome, but generally look the same.  I personally live in Tempe and enjoy it because I am an ASU student and love the somewhat younger feel to Tempe.  For a family person it's still great, but if you're looking to get out of the student/20's era of your life and move on, it can be done here in Tempe but you've got better options.  Special note. Ahwatukee is a part of Phoenix, not technically its own city but a great choice that is a bit north and west of this and has some very nice more expensive homes although it's a bit older than most of Chandler Gilbert (70's/80's) whereas I believe most things built in Chandler and especially Gilbert are 90's and newer.  Centrally located (North Tempe, Scottsdale, Parts of Phoenix) Again North Tempe is HEAVY ASU related everything. Your cup of tea or not. Family works but you can do better elsewhere if that is your focus.  Scottsdale is probably one of your best bets all around. On the whole Scottsdale runs north/south pretty far so you can make a lot of decisions on how close etc. you want to be to certain areas.  It also on the whole is richer and whiter (pardon the bluntness but it's true).  You can find all different kinds of neighborhoods and areas in Scottsdale.  It will generally be a bit more expensive but there are great deals all around. I'd say most of Scottsdale is like Chandler/Gilbert except 20 years earlier.  Still very nice but nowhere near as new.  Gilbert definitely will be more family focused but Scottsdale is JUST behind it and way more developed, centrally located, and just as nice.  If I could, I would find a nice place near Arcadia in Scottsdale depending on your price range.  Stay away from everything in Phoenix itself for the most part.  You can find nice pocket neighborhoods etc, but you can do much better for much cheaper in all around better cities that are smaller and more contoured for a new family.  The center is old, lots of it is rundown, it's centered around downtown Phoenix which is offices, sports arenas, and shady shit.    West (Westgate area, Avondale) Westgate area is nice and new.  If I had to pick a place on the West side I would find something around there.  Avondale and everything near the 10 going towards Cali is farmland and large lots etc if that's what you like and you can find nice housing, but things seem very isolated.    East Mesa is your best (only) bet. Similar to Tempe in age, quality, etc.  Just without the University.  Slightly lower income on the whole.  Find the few nice pockets with a good High School.  So Quick Rankings Run down Cheat Sheet TLDR: Scottsdale tops my list (then again I don't have a family yet). It can feel snobby at times, but things are nice and as far as I know has good schools. Big plus to being centrally located for the valley.  Gilbert is probably PERFECT for a new family.  I just know nothing about the schools and location of your lady's family.  Gilbert to Westgate or North Phoenix will be little over an hour/hour and a half on the best of days and 2+ during high traffic times if not possibly longer.  Ahwatukee has a couple of great schools in the valley. Nice posh areas. Still upscale but less snobby than Scottsdale.  It's where I want to live eventually and where my parents now live. It's just slightly older than Gilbert area but to me that's a plus because the new Gilbert areas have like one giant mall/outdoor mall area that EVERYONE goes to because it's the only thing in that area and it was designed to be the central hub.  So it's packed. It has everything you'll ever need shopping wise. But it's big and busy. But brand new. Trade offs I guess. Ahwatukee to me has more small businesses and some fun history I guess. (in comparison)"

arizona,2nyked,Rhystatic,3,Mon Dec 1 20:44:54 2014 UTC,"You're welcome.  If her family is in Tempe, you've got a LOT of options.  Tempe is literally in the center of all of your top choices. It borders Scottsdale, Gilbert, Chandler, and Ahwatukee.  So you can practically live anywhere in the valley besides North or West Phoenix because all of your options are aprox. equidistant. I do recommend the rent then buy option. Good luck!"

Had Luxury Tint in Chandler do one last year and it was not good - bubbling and she didn't clean the windows well so there were waterspots on the glass that the tint went over. I gave her another shot to do it and still looked like poo. Called Steve - aztintman - and had him redo it. Looked 100% better and there is bubbling, hairs or other imperfections.   http://aztintman.com/"

arizona,2n8j96,NineMinusThree,4,Mon Nov 24 22:07:07 2014 UTC,"Healthy animals recognize danger & retreat from human contact in the wild.  As a general rule, if you have contact with a wild animal that doesn't seem to fear your presence, it's usually a sign of mental illness, injury, or some other bad juju.  You want to avoid these animals.  Rabies, for instance, it's marked with an atypical fear response.  Also, in some cases wild animals have been fed by human contact & lost their natural fear response.  This does not mean they're ""tame"" & may appear ""cute"" but can often result in aggressive behavior if their expectations are not met.  Of course, there may be exceptions & I'm no zoologist, but this is my understanding from current teachings & experiences in the bush.  Generally speaking, be cautious around wildlife that doesn't seem to be concerned with your presence.  Never approach or pick up a wild animal. And bobcats can fuck you up."

Maybe you should hold out then do a full on vacation and visit the Grand Canyon. I did a road trip once that went through a few national parks (like Zion), hit up the Grand Canyon and ended up in Vegas. The Grand Canyon is an amazing way to experience snow.  Have you considered Mt. Lemmon in Tucson? It's not great snow, and I guess if Flagstaff doesn't have snow Mt. Lemmon probably won't.

I know there are a lot and have been to quite a few but it's hard for me to speak of one being better than the rest.   Really good hiking includes Camelback Mountain in Scottsdale and Toms Thumb in North Phoenix.   There's a vegetarian restaurant in South Scottsdale called Green that has amazing soy milkshakes. Also Pita Jungle is a great restaurant with a lot of delicious vegan or vegetarian options.   Flagstaff is an adorable and fun college town that gets snow and has Snowbowl for snowboarding or skiing. Sunrise Ski Resort also exists, which I have heard has more challenging slopes but I feel like Flagstaff has a better overall experience being a young adult who likes hanging out in college towns. To each their own, though."

arizona,2mf29u,9me123,3,Sat Nov 15 23:00:58 2014 UTC,"I don't work t channel 12, but I provide helicopter coverage for TV3 and CBS5, and the way it works with us is that we shoot a lot of video that never makes air, for one reason or another.   Most of the time, if video doesn't make air, it's not personal, it's just that it was a heavy news day and the producer on that show had to make a judgement call about what to keep and what to cut.   So where does that video go? I can't speak for 12, but with most stations, footage all gets dumped into a big media management system at the station. Think of it as a huge hard drive, where they put all the raw footage, where it is tagged by day and topic, then the editors / producers can pull from that day's footage to create stories.   Different stations probably have different internal 'rules' about how long they keep footage, but if it was fairly recent, there's a chance that it is still living on a hard drive down at the station somewhere. You might try to find out who the producer or news director for that show was (twitter and Google may help) and just ask if they still have that footage around. Better yet, if you know which reporter was on the story, you might hit them up to see if they still have the footage.  Actually getting the footage is a whole different story - that's totally up to the station, and it's not likely that they'll just give you the raw video, but with the right amount of sweet-talking, you might be able to convince a reporter, producer, editor, or multimedia reporter at Gannett (the company that owns 12) to pull some of that footage and do a social media hit or something with it if it is still relevant enough (if it isn't specific to a particular day or event, but it can be used generically). Think 'what's in it for the station to go to the trouble of putting together a piece with that footage'. Certainly there's probably a bunch of kids that would retweet that stuff if it's relevant enough. But if they already aired some of the footage from your school, just not all of it, or if the story just wasn't big enough, they may not still have it, or would be less likely to put the work into pulling the footage and putting together a piece on it.  If it were us, I'd totally put together a piece for you and slap it up on Twitter or Facebook, but I don't work for Gannett / 12. That's why Channel 3 is awesome (pluggity plug).  Good luck!"

arizona,2m7svh,aTip4You,7,Thu Nov 13 21:02:53 2014 UTC,It is generally not allowed. Many of the cities say that urban camping requires a permit. We tried to find out about this for an event we wanted to host and the short answer was that there wasn't really a way to get a permit. They are essentially ordinances designed to keep the homeless from squatting on public lands.
