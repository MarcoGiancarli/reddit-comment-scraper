fpvracing,3e3tnn,AmpMunkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:58 2015 UTC,"The Alias is a lot of fun to fly, but the stock brushed motors are notoriously prone to burning out.  Here's what I think: both the Hubsan X4 and Alias have brushed motors, however the Alias motors are geared and driving a larger gear attached to each rotor shaft.  The rotor shafts are easy to bend after a rough crash and although they won't prevent you from flying, any extra friction in the gear drive will cause the brushes in the motors to heat up and incinerate.  The Hubsan X4 and most nano quads are direct drive and there's less friction involved.  The biggest advantage to the Alias is that it will fair much better outside.  I wouldn't consider flying one inside unless you've got tons of room."

fpvracing,3e3tnn,Bauerpauer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"/r/vitaminrad is spot on.  I literally replaced a motor in my Alais, went out and flew it for a bit, and bam, another motor burned up.  I've had it in the air for a few minutes, tops.  I fly Hubsan X4 nearly every day, 3 to 5 batteries, and I've only had 1 motor fail in a few months of bashing it around.  Another option might be the NanoQX - I've ""landed"" that into my dog's water bowl TWICE, and it keeps on goin.  I just unplug the battery, let it dry out in the sun for a bit, and she's good to go.  It's got both Autolevel and Rate mode, and it comes in a Bind-n-Fly, so you can theoretically use any DSM2/DSMX transmitter with it (though I haven't had any luck with my Taranis+OrangeRX, yet).  It's small enough to fly indoors."

I got mine at rtfquads.com  I have also tried kk2.1 and multiwii AIO v2 and been around /u/mycodude working on his CC3Ds.  CC3D is also a great option and good for beginners.   Avoid the KK2.

Beeper, telemetry, voltage battery monitoring, all types of flight modes, Cleanflight gives you multiple PID controllers to try and feel. Extremely locked when tuned properly and practically every pro uses one. The software to tune Cleanflight is also easy to use and works on chrome so it is device friendly. I use the Acro Naze32 as I do not need barometer and compass for altitude hold, as I have a race quad but it still gives you all the features of cleanflight. Also if you are looking for OSD, OSDoge is an OSD that is made for the naze32 and works beautifully."

No vibrations, no jello in the video, smooth as butter.  One word of caution. Be prepared that if you break something, getting replacements or even troubleshooting is a pain. There are no parts available. Thankfully the issue that I'm having with mine right now is just a motor which IS available, but still. It's scary to think I'll be down for a long period of time."
fpvracing,3dxzft,Mongrel80,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:16:13 2015 UTC,Oh nice an owner :D Did you had an other quad250 before the Vortex ? Is it more fragile than a ZMR or less ? I have a 3D printer so do you think that it is possible to print replacement part instead of buying a crashkit? And the plastics part are strong enough or not ? I'm a little bit scared about the fragility of the plastic parts like motor mount :s
fpvracing,3dxzft,Mongrel80,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's actually stronger. Many of my friends have zmr clones and are constantly repairing them. Any time they hit and roll they are replacing the nylon screws they use to attach the arms to the frame. My arms just fold back and absorb the impact.  The likelyhood of me breaking the plastic feels slim. The fit and finish of the vortex is top notch. I'm not very impressed with the 700TVL CMOS that came with it, I'm currently using a 600tvl cmos as it didn't wash out the colors in bright sunlight. I ordered a 5v ccd to put on the quad."
fpvracing,3dxzft,AllegedCaveman,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they use nylon screws to attach the arms to the frame. The kit comes with steel, I use aluminum, and I've never had a single one break, after a metric fuckton of crashes.   Not bashing the Vortex, but for what's it worth, the only one I saw needed replacement parts after a pretty lame crash on 3s. I slam my ZMR into shit all the time, 4s and 6045 props (so a lot more kinetic energy) and that sucker is tough as nails.   I have heard that Banggood ZMr's vary greatly in quality.

fpvracing,3dxzft,Saiteik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:47 2015 UTC,Yea thats what they get for using nylon screws....... Usually you'll never break anything other than props on a proper build.
fpvracing,3dxzft,AllegedCaveman,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:18 2015 UTC,"Hello, I have 2 friends that own the Vortex and have seen them race. They can handle one hell of a beating (seen one go full speed into concrete pole and only break props). Downside to these proprietary quads is when the electronics start failing. One of my friends crashed his and had a bad tumble and now it does random resets while mid flight. Also they are very limited on power. Swapping for better motors would require better ESC's which would be hard to fit on a frame with tubular arms.  The only real nice thing about the vortex is the OSD which allows for full adjustments to everything including your PID's.  One last note, the vortex is NOT designed to take an impact from the rear. My friend did a backflip and went tail in destroying the led board and all the plastic that folds the arms in the back. The impact was not even that hard."
fpvracing,3dxzft,PerceivedShift,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"I don't plan to crash on the rear, but it's good to know :) T-motors in your opinion are limited ? O_o  ESC's can handle 12A if I remember, you think it's limited ?"
fpvracing,3dxzft,AllegedCaveman,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:00 2015 UTC,"Tmotors are great motors for the price mind you there are better. But the motors that come on the Vortex are very limited in power because of the stator size. 1806 is very small with a tradeoff of weight vs extra power. If you were to attempt to run the vortex without modification on 6in props your motors would toast. Again, going back to my statement before about the ESC's if you swap those motors you will NEED to swap the ESC's which then becomes and issue with the frame."
fpvracing,3dxzft,Allah_Mode,0,Mon Jul 20 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"T-motors have been shown in thrust test to be one of the less efficient/powerful of the ""upper tier"" of motors. Cobras, Sunnysky, Hovership all come in better.  Also, 12a is limited. Some, like the rotorgeeks, can handle much more than 12a, but a true 12a esc is really limited. I push mine and they're 20a (4s, Cobra 1960kv, HQ 6045 props)"
fpvracing,3dxzft,PerceivedShift,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"You really don't need to run 6045's on the Vortex, a set of Cobra's running 5045's makes the Vortex damn fast because they are so light."

Parts are now being stocked so short supply was only a temp problem. OSD is amazing as are the pro tune settings. There are some must do's due to some design oversights.... These included upgrading the bottom skid plate to a thicker version made by pirofliprc.com, and zip tying the rear arms to protect the led board. Other than that I have found it to be very robust, with arms folding to absorb impact as intended and it flying great."

The Vortex's will rip up a track, their light weight and lower CG make them a beast in the turns.  They really shine on more technical tracks, they really do give that ""on the rails"" feeling.    So far they've been pretty durable, we've had a lot of ground crashes of all kinds, tree slams, gate hits, branch smacks, and bad mid-air collision between both Vortex's and so far the damage between the two of us is:  Many, many props!  2 motor mounts  1 damaged LED board (We are now both using the zip tie fix)  2 broken camera guards  1 motor  So far we haven't been grounded for very long after a wreck, but currently some spare parts are hard to come by.

Feels like a bit heavier 6"" quad with loads of power. The OSD is nice and I think it's pretty good looking. From what I've seen it can take a beating too. But it has quality issues/bugs... I've seen bad VTX's that sends over multiple freqencies. Bad main boards not flashable. Boards that break when flashing. Wierd bugs with the RX. It's a shame, really, because it's a great quad.

As long as your zmr is still structurally sound, changing between 250 frames won't do much given the same guts.   I'd guess the vortex is less likely to break, but upgraded arms on the zmr would probably make it a wash for cheap."

At the time I had no plan on going for an FPV build. I actually tried some FPV equipment on my 450 and it sucked.  But over the winter I started looking at these awesome fpv miniquad videos from BorisB, metaldanny, charpu, etc. and was hooked. So I pulled the trigger and naively bought all the high end parts right away. QAV250, 4s, T-motors, KISS escs. That was stupid. I couldn't even build properly, as I had no experience, and I made some stupid mistaked when configuring, and I couldn't fly. A lot of money were wasted by stupidity on excessively expensive parts. If I had done a cheapo build before (ZMR250 w/ HK electronics) my QAV250 would have been a lot better right away. I also would have the confidence to fly the cheaper one harder, as I didn't want to break the QAV250.  But yeah, it was still okay, I pulled through and I don't regret spending a single dollar!

The battery used by the fpv system is barely noticeable.

Even if there isn't an accident it certainly is an annoyance for others at the park. Doesn't this risk giving the sport a bad name?
fpvracing,3dn506,Bubberitt,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same.  Usually when I go to the park, I'll go to an area of the park that's empty ... I never fly near or around people.  Also, if there's walking areas, I usually have a spotter with me, to let me know if anyone comes around.  At one point you almost hit those people walking on the sidewalk while flying through the tree's....  And why is your multi so ... shaky/crooked? ... I was getting motion sickness watching it.

From what I gather, 6045 at 2000kv is doable in 4S if they're in the prop wash. But if you activate damped light you need to upgrade. The recombinant force dumps a ton of heat back onto the ESCs.

fpvracing,3d4vaf,DeathByPetrichor,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:27 2015 UTC,It would actually be counter productive to use that angle.  You wouldn't have enough downward thrust to keep it in the air.
fpvracing,3d4vaf,MachWun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"I've often thought about what the maximum angle is that a quad could hold without losing altitude. It's been a long time since I went to school and I wasn't a very good student, so I could be completely wrong but I think the equation is something like:  angle_in_radians = cos-1 (weight/thrust)  So a quad that produces 1600g of thrust and weighs 550g should be able to hold an angle of about 70 degrees from vertical. That doesn't sound right though.  Even if it is right, the angle will be less extreme in practice. The frame is tipped forward, which means that as it moves through the air, it will be forced downward, effectively increasing its weight."

fpvracing,3d4vaf,MachWun,2,Tue Jul 14 01:49:06 2015 UTC,You could go 90 degree or even more if you got enough speed so that the centripedal force carries you away from the planet... ;)
fpvracing,3d4vaf,ErrorAsh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"I think your math is right, quadcopters are pretty horrible for aerodynamics so that eats a lot of energy.   So a quad that produces 1600g of thrust and weighs 550g should be able to hold an angle of about 70 degrees from vertical. That doesn't sound right though.   There are not very many quadcopters that could pull those numbers off at speed. Note that the props are sending air back at (basically) a fixed speed. As you increase the speed of the aircraft, the difference in speed between the air you are pushing and the air you are travelling through gets smaller, meaning you are producing less thrust."

fpvracing,3cys0x,kevlarman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:14:17 2015 UTC,"Had another thought to better explain it, it's behaving as though the CG on the quad is really far forward and to the left, and even trimming and subtrimming can't artificially bring the CG to the center.

When I got into FPV, it was completely different and a learning experience all over again. The only thing that carried over was some muscle memory on how to sensitively control the quad.  Basically, learning one well does not help with the other. If you plan on getting good with FPV, focus mostly on that, since learning LOS is pretty much only handy as a backup if you lose video, but most FPVer do not invest enough time to learn it well enough for recovery anyway."

As an instructor at our local club I thought several people how to fly LOS with airplanes. Once you have a good mussle memory on how to fly LOS, you can put on the goggles and make sure you have a spotter beside you. In case you get lost or in trouble -  you can had over the remote to your spotter to bring back your craft. The fastest way to learn is to be thought by someone who already knows how to fly."

I am an advanced HAM, and I know a lot about radios, RF, microwaves and design, but antennas, gains, radiation patterns are still a bit of black magic to me. Here is what I learned from the designer/manufacturer.  When the incoming signal strength is equivalent with an Omni (this could be anything between 0db to 3db for a small rubber duck) the X2Air can do 150 degrees HBW. If the transmitter is further away - obviously the signal strength will be less - he measured/calculated it at -3db, the HBW will be reduced to 68 degrees."

fpvracing,3cgcqu,GoatSpoon,3,Tue Jul 7 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, note I'm an electronic engineer so this might sound like a design review because that's what I do.  *There will be a huge force on your circuit board/mid plate when an arm hits something from any direction. The length of the bolts/standoffs in between plates contributes to this. The will tend to bend in the middle and rip out of the plate. This is why many frames have the bottom and mid plate as close as possible, shorter bolts bend less.  I see that you have plastic reinforcing in that area, but it looks like the distance between the bottom/mid plate could be halved.  *What are the dimensions of the traces from the esc to the motor? (thickness, width, length). I would always be trying to decrease the distance between the esc and the motor.  *This one might not matter in this case, but it's still worth mentioning. Look at the photo showing the escs, specifically the top right. The configuration of the input wires means that the power input will almost perfectly couple inductively to the signal wire. You want to decrease the loop area of every high current and signal path.  I bet that there will be noise on the esc signal wire, but not enough to cause a problem.  Looks like a great build though, thumbs up!"
fpvracing,3cgcqu,GoatSpoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"Nice!  I'm currently studying EE so this is good to know too.  The reason the space is so large is to accommodate the angled arm spacers as well as house the ESCs.  I get what you mean about the space though.  The other option is to add more standoffs between these two plates.  Those parts are included in the kit as well.  Other than that, it's really just weighing the benefits of saving some weight and adding more strength.  I'll look into designing a side bumper to give it more rigidity at the cost of adding a few grams.   What are the dimensions of the traces from the esc to the motor? (thickness, width, length). I would always be trying to decrease the distance between the esc and the motor.   They are .3"" at a minimum in width.  Not sure about the thickness off the top of my head but they are all less than an inch in length.  Those were made to be as short and wide as possible.  Lots of copper fills there.     This one might not matter in this case, but it's still worth mentioning. Look at the photo showing the escs, specifically the top right. The configuration of the input wires means that the power input will almost perfectly.....   I'll post a photo of our PCB either today or tomorrow.  I get what you mean though.  Not sure of how I would get rid of the loop without really starting to twist wires.  Moving the ESCs closer towards the center is a given.  I'll keep this in mind when doing more builds.  You're right though, it probably is inducing some small current in the signal wire.   Thanks for the feedback!  Every little bit helps!"
fpvracing,3cgcqu,GoatSpoon,2,Tue Jul 7 23:02:32 2015 UTC,"Hey no problem. *Oh, angled arms! I didn't see at first that the spacers were creating an angled arm. I personally would just angle the motor and keep the arm flat, but I think its very important to have a huge variety of designs out there. The more the better.  *If you didn't specify thickness to the PCB manufacturer you might get 1 ounce. I would strongly consider thicker copper on the board. I would be very interested to see losses in general on PDBs. Its something I will be doing a huge test of when I set up my thrust measurement monstrosity.   *Like I said, I doubt noise will be a problem, but it would be very interesting for you to put a scope on it and see if there is any difference between the two escs. It would help to have ground plane underneath the white wires, I don't know what you have on the top side."
fpvracing,3cgcqu,evilspyboy,2,Tue Jul 7 23:20:56 2015 UTC,"We're making some changes on the PCB for the final batch.  Thicker tracers, more copper is a good idea, and some other minor things.  Lots of long nights ahead of me =]"
fpvracing,3cgcqu,evilspyboy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:24:47 2015 UTC,Want another tip? Consider putting a plated through hole in the centre of any pad that you think is at risk of being ripped off in a crash.
fpvracing,3cgcqu,whitenoise106,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:19:28 2015 UTC,Yep that's already done on the PCB.  Battery Power pads have a ton of those for sure.
fpvracing,3cgcqu,TedW,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for your feedback.  I'm about 12 hours away from completing version 3 of the board.  We will be shipping V3 to everyone who bought it!  If you have any ideas you'd like to see implemented, I'd be open to hear them!"
fpvracing,3cgcqu,brngdrg,2,Wed Jul 8 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"We're live! We love all the support you guys are giving! I talked to my boss and he agreed to a code for reddit for the GH Minis and kits. Code is ""reddit"" for 8% off  The product is on our website . We won't be able to ship until next week Wednesday."
