PsychologicalTricks,32943r,cluffmeister,9,Sat Apr 11 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Because Socratic method might have a bit of a different connotation for some people. For example, for me personally, I have heard that phrase used a lot in my classes to refer to situations when the professor doesn't want to lead the class, but rather wants the class to be more of an open discussion of ideas where the students are more actively involved.   So I figured I would explain it out to relate it better to this thread, so that it is more clear and less confusing. But you are definitely right... that is more of the proper term to refer to such discussions."

F. Doesn't stop them! It's cheap labor! Real Americans won't work so cheap!  Me. So wait, You want to shoot Mexicans because Americans are hiring them? Why don't we just shoot the Americans?  F.

PsychologicalTricks,32943r,Slenthik,13,Sun Apr 12 06:28:58 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time, particularly with people that are argumentative. Then later on (a few days to a week later), I will bring up the same subject in such a way that lets them subtly know they were totally wrong. Generally the best way to do it is to use an irrefutable fact or use a recent example of something that happened.   It lets them save face, and they are more open and receptive to changing their view/beliefs because you are bringing it up out of the blue (not during an argument, when they will be defensive and closed off to hearing an opposing viewpoint).   Here is a very simplified version of what I am talking about (this really happened):  My employee, Robert, was changing the paper in the printer while a job was printing out. A student (this takes place in a college) comes back into the printer room to get their print job, and because Robert opened the tray while it was printing, the rest of it cancelled. The student says to me that they think he caused their print job to be cancelled, explains why, wants a refund on their account. Robert proceeds to be indignant and says there is no way he did it. In front of the student, I let it slide and give them a refund.   Student walks away, Robert continues talking to me about how the student must have done something to cause the cancellation. I know this isn't true. In some cases, it would be helpful to have the ""tell me more"" part here, but this example doesn't need much elaboration, so I forgo that part.   Next week, I am talking with Robert and say ""Man, I am being so forgetful today. Earlier I mistakenly opened the printer tray and caused a print job to be cancelled. I don't know what I was thinking."" I did no such thing, but Robert clearly recalled the incident from last week and made a mental note to himself never to do that again, even though he has been working here for 3 years and should know better. And so far, he never has done it again.  ...I get a lot of practice with the ""tell me more"" trick and the ""several days later"" trick when it comes to Robert."
PsychologicalTricks,32943r,librarymania,3,Sun Apr 12 05:39:12 2015 UTC,That's a great example; I similar things. As you said bringing it up later makes it much easier for them to take.

PsychologicalTricks,31v1ig,deus_ex_macadamia,8,Wed Apr 15 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Instead of trying to tell them, but look at the positives, which, like OP said, invalidates their experience, give validation to their experience. For instance, if someone's mother dies, would you tell them, ""look at the positives."" Even if you have never had a parent die, you know that for most people that is a shitty thing. I think this is why most people say ""I'm sorry"" (among other things) because no one in their right mind would say look at the positives in this situation. Or if someone loses their job, and are rightfully pissed off, instead of saying well at least you still have a car, you can express agreement of their pain and frustration, by saying ""That's horrible that they fired you."" Now that person feels validated, because you also agree that it was shitty. Hopefully this was a good or at least okay explanation."

PsychologicalTricks,31pk1u,chipanderson,5,Tue Apr 7 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"I work with similar situations, in one way or another.  Lets just say, I have to get something to a customer (lets call it X) between 7-30 days after purchase. On day 15, they complain because its past 7 days, and they want X right now. They knew before they purchased that it could take up to 30. They tell me on day 15 that they won't make their payment (due on day 31) because they don't have what they need from me.  Right here is the difference, I think, between my situation and yours. At the time of purchase, they signed docs acknowledging the time frames. So when they tell me they aren't going to pay, I remind them that they signed a document acknowledging that it could take up to 30 days.  I'm thinking you may need to incorporate something similar. People are still going to complain, its part of the sale, but it gets them off your back much quicker.  What if your invoice for the product had a small clause at the bottom that they initialed? It would basically say something along the lines of   I acknowledge that standard installation and delivery time is 4-6 weeks. I furthermore agree that ""your company"" is not held fiscally liable for manufacturer default or error.   I'm not sure if this would uphold to anything, its really just more of a tactic. People don't often dispute something they've signed. This won't necessarily solve your problem, but it will probably shake off a lot of people. I find it a lot easier to stand my ground saying no when I have something like that.  As for when a person wants compensation for something that's neither their fault nor yours (I actually deal with this a lot too), I've found that taking a deep breath, putting your customer service attitude on, and acknowledging their feelings helps out a lot. I let them know that I genuinely understand their situation, because I need X to be done as well. In fact, X is money to me also, so I want it just as bad as they do. That's why I'm working hard to finish everything up so that I can benefit from it too.

He plays dumb like he doesn't understand when really we all know he has an alternate solution that he's going to force upon us. It comes off to me as him playing games.   I still think this is a good trick if you don't use it during every single meeting."
PsychologicalTricks,31mi55,iloveutoo,2,Tue Apr 7 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's not always what you say... but how you say it with tact"
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,arijitdas,29,Mon Apr 6 05:02:01 2015 UTC,"As a child I was always told I was very smart, and I probably was. Problem was, when I got into highschool, I was used to just coasting and still being top of the class. This became a problem around year 10, when I really slumped. After that, though, I picked up my act and ended up doing pretty well.  Don't tell your kids they're very smart. It does more harm than good."
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,AhrmiintheUnseen,5,Mon Apr 6 10:28:37 2015 UTC,This. I could slack and get a better grade than most of my classmates when I was younger. When harder stuff came though I had a hard time because my whole childhood had just been my parents telling me I'm smart and how I didn't need to study much at all.
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,Stickyballs96,5,Mon Apr 6 11:42:20 2015 UTC,I still slack and get better grades than my friends and I'm a graduating senior... I'm honestly scared for college next year because I sincerely do not know how to study.
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,Pooper85,2,Mon Apr 6 17:03:12 2015 UTC,In my school we got specific lessons on study technique. If you get them too you should pay really close attention to them because they help alot. If not I suggest researching it on the internet. It will help you enormously. Good luck!
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,Stickyballs96,2,Mon Apr 6 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, just do the homework... If you're having serious problems, read about what your teacher will teach next so you won't be oblivious to the theme and can clear your doubts."
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,MomoBR,2,Mon Apr 6 19:55:43 2015 UTC,absolutely same thing. And then college came and holy shit smart no more; I am a dumb man now lol definitely hurt me thinking I was exceptionally smart. I never even made honors either lol

PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,lzsmith,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:01:10 2015 UTC,"commend their work   I've seen versions of this that say to praise the kid as a hard worker.  I like the way you've phrased this here better.  If I did some work quickly and easily because I was smart (and I was), I'd have felt guilty after being praised for hard work, since I didn't work hard."

PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,EsotericKnowledge,1 point,Wed May 20 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly think when this concept is put under the lens of parenting that it inherently becomes controversial. My question is, what are the methods for improving your own growth mindset if you receive the more topical praises? Carol Dweck's TED talk on the subject is helpful in thinking about how this theory really works."
PsychologicalTricks,31liy8,kimmyswags,1 point,Sun May 10 04:09:37 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I agree. I was a ""smart kid"" and as I got older (and my home life got more complicated, my health declined, etc) my self-esteem was somewhere in the negatives because I had formed associations: good performance = smart; therefore poor performance = stupid. And so on...  That said, I don't think it's wrong to remind your children of their strengths. It's just dangerous to use innate traits as justification for when things go well or poorly. They can potentially become mentally inescapable/insurmountable then."
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,arijitdas,32,Sun Apr 5 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"Something that I do that is somewhat similar to this is I will split my sets up in my head, sometimes more than once. So if I'm doing 10 reps I will count to five and start over with ""only"" 5 to perform instead of thinking about the previous 5 I did. If it's a really heavy, difficult set of something and I'm doing like 8 reps I will count out 4, then count out 2 reps and 2 then more.  I'm not saying this will work for everyone but it's just a habit I've picked up that seems to really help me personally."
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,thurmco,12,Sun Apr 5 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time! If I have a set of 10 reps, I'll count to 5 and then be like ""hell yeah only 5 more,"" and then I'll grind out 3 more and get pumped that there's only 2 left. Idk it makes it easier for me"
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,receivesredditgold,5,Sun Apr 5 21:26:15 2015 UTC,Exactly! It totally helps with my motivation mid-set

I also like to think of how I'm ""already"" 1/8 done or whatever after a quick section. Makes it seem a lot shorter  Edited one typo"
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,122ninjas,6,Sun Apr 5 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I did the exact same thing in my swimming days. I was a short distance guy, so whenever I had to swim a 200 I just broke it down as 4x50s."

PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,St0kka,4,Mon Apr 6 07:02:30 2015 UTC,"but what about when you're going heavy for 5 reps and can crank out one more for 6, does that become -1? or 0?"
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,zts0005,7,Mon Apr 6 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"It becomes a positive 1, 2, 3, etc... now because you've completed the original 10 thru 1."
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,T045T3R0V3N,2,Mon Apr 6 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"I just count double, i.e. each rep counts as 2.  I seem to be more capable when I trick my body into thinking it's doing twice the work it actually is."
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,pmmeurpics,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:23:40 2015 UTC,"This may be true for those who go to the gym to 'stay fit'. However, For those who pump to get GAINS: always count up, always try to go bigger and higher. Never limit yourself by predetermining how many reps you will do before you start. Know your body and know your limit. Push it to it."

PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,jrd_dthsqd,1 point,Mon Apr 6 07:09:58 2015 UTC,"Unless you're lifting very heavy, as in Squat, Deadlift or Bench. Would also be true for pull-ups if you added an ungodly amount of weight.  In those cases you're supposed to use the valsalva (or whatever it's called) maneuver where you draw in air and exhale against a closed airway so you stay tight and your body is protected. You keep this pressure during the entire repitition (or multiple, if you like), so effectively, you only breathe in between reps"
PsychologicalTricks,31jwz0,RedditIsAChoice,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:23:58 2015 UTC,This is kind of hard when you're doing 10 sets of 10. You kind of lose count.
