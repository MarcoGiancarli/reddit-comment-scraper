weddingplanning,3e38jt,whinybride,19,Tue Jul 21 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"There are a number of reasons why a person can't attend so try not to think your family/friends cares less about you.  But with 25 people, you can potentially have an even more kickass wedding. With the extra room, maybe you can set up some simple inside ""yard"" games that people can play like cornhole.  You can also give people a quick call who might have not sent back their RSVP to see if they are going to come, but if you really want more people there, just start inviting other people in your life even if you aren't super close. Coworkers, other friends, your neighbors."

Best wedding ever incoming, great attitude to have for it!"
weddingplanning,3e38jt,internetALLTHETHINGS,6,Tue Jul 21 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"I can completely sympathize with the ""can't be bothered to come celebrate"" feeling. If I may rant for a moment myself...  I think most of us have heard that the two times in your life when everyone shows up are your wedding and your funeral, and I fully believe that if you're invited to a wedding then you fucking make it work. I understand that sometimes it's just really not possible (finances, health, etc.), but people are supposed to overcome stupid excuses or small inconveniences to be able to come share your day with you. And it doesn't sound like your family has any excuses or small inconveniences getting in the way.  Fiancee and I are dealing with this a bit right now. Over the past nine years (yes it was a big day when we finally got engaged!), we've happily invested money and vacation time to be there for her family's big events. Now that it's our wedding, several of those same family members - who absolutely have the means to make it work - ""just can't be there.""  The thing is, I saw this coming with some of them. I was hoping they'd surprise me, but they've fulfilled every negative expectation that I set the day we sent out the invites. And then last night we got a ""no"" from a part of the family who I really thought was better than that.  Maybe it's not worth it to be upset, but dammit, it's your day and you were there for everyone else when it was their day. Don't feel guilty for feeling the way you do.  (On the other hand - it's your wedding day! It will be great! And you know you're going to be surrounded by people who care about you and love you and are so excited to be sharing your day with you!)"

We ranted to each other about it for a while and got most of the disappointment out of our systems, but I'm still a little salty about it so I was happy to have the opportunity to share. Don't forget the last paragraph though, your day will be amazing and shared with people who care about you : )"
weddingplanning,3e38jt,stokelydokely,3,Tue Jul 21 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Our turnout is a bit lower than we expected too.  Honestly, if these people are not going to show up for free dinner and drinks, I doubt they would do the same amount of traveling for my funeral either."
weddingplanning,3e38jt,shichihachi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to say that gave me a good chuckle. It's a free meal and all the booze you want for five hours! Secondly, you're right, and that's what makes it all the more disappointing - they just really don't seem to care. I think we invited just about 160, and we really didn't think we'd have trouble hitting our guarantee of 120."
weddingplanning,3e38jt,vbm923,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"We invited 209 and have about 95 attending it looks like.  It involves varying amounts of travel (A LOT of travel for some) for everyone involved, so we're not offended (for the most part) really.  And it's saving us a lot of money.    The only ones I'm offended by are the ones that I feel like I would have made it to theirs had the situation been reversed.  The friends that I REALLY liked but was never super close to that live 10 hrs away with three little kids?  Okay, I can understand.  The friends living overseas for work where a (single) plane ticket back could run them $1k-1300 each before rental car and hotel expenses?  Okay, that's understandable.  I'm not even offended if you can't make the funeral at that price.  The cousin (who is childless and engaged herself) I grew up with, played on sports teams together, punched boys in the face for?  Yea, I'm offended you won't even answer my texts to ask if you're coming. Oh well I guess!  I just rectify myself to: ""I guess that's a no!  Have a nice life!""    I was actually more annoyed at the cousin who couldn't bring herself to say no, and so just keeps putting off an answer.  Her latest response: ""Can you pencil me in as a maybe?""  ...Do you know how weddings work?"
weddingplanning,3e38jt,giantteddybearmonste,4,Tue Jul 21 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's my main issue here too. My aunt/uncle who live in TX and just came up here (PA) last week to go a family reunion, I totally understand that they can't make it. The family members from out of the country, perfectly fine. The cousin who is having a baby right around then, yea, I get it. But the childless cousins that are my age with weekends off work who live <1 hour away that I was pretty close to growing up and didn't even bother to RSVP no until I chased them down... those are the ones that bother me more."

You let him know how you feel and let him handle the issue.  I'm having a similar situation with my mother now. She wants to invite all her cousins, which amounts to 25 more people (effectively adding 25% more to our guest list), but it isn't the money that bothers me, it's the fact that I don't have relationships with these people. These are people I see once in a blue moon, and honestly, could not pick half of them out of a line up. Sorry, mom, not the people I want to share my special day with. If you don't want strangers, you don't want strangers, and you present it as such. Money doesn't have to be brought into the equation."

My mom is doing something similar and making it out like I'm a shitty daughter for not inviting all these people. How are you handling it?

weddingplanning,3e30vi,phelinephile,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:38 2015 UTC,"It basically results in a screaming match each time about how I need to do the right thing and family is family and I'm a disgrace for throwing a wedding for my friends (last I checked, I was throwing a party for FH and I) and how it will cause a rift in the family if I don't invite these people I only ever see at funerals.  I'm basically taking it in baby steps. I was visiting this past weekend and firmly told her that I did not want people at my wedding who I did not have established relationships with, but I wanted to get addresses from her, so I had her give me their addresses just in case. I told her as soon as we get firm numbers for food, alcohol, cake, chair rentals, etc. and were able to get a per person amount, we would make a firm decision. She's offered to cover their costs, but that's beyond the point. I'm hoping her seeing that $200 a head is a lot of money. Plus, she's insisting most of them won't show, yet we're having a family reunion next weekend and the 90+ year old aunt and uncle who live in Las Vegas and one has severe dementia are showing! I can't count on a bulk of 25 people not showing!"
weddingplanning,3e30vi,stormeegedon,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, yes! Why is it the people closest to us are the ones throwing hissy fits?

She's already trying to grab my dad and FH's parents' invite allotments if there's go unclaimed. I'm just like thatsnothowthisworksthatsnothowanyofthisworks.gif"
weddingplanning,3e30vi,phelinephile,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I highly suggest easing her into it. Express how you feel and don't waver. Make an effort to make them work in, either by letting her have a few come, or by having a block in the road as far as cost goes. I'm hoping her seeing that people will travel for a few hour long family reunion, there's a good chance they'll do the same for a wedding. Although, I am having a Sunday wedding nearly 500 miles up north from all of them. It may deter them, but I also don't want to risk it!"
weddingplanning,3e30vi,stormeegedon,10,Tue Jul 21 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Would it be rude to give my FBILs their guests if I don't have to pay for them as well?    Well, no.  Why would it be rude to give someone a +1?  If you meant would it be rude NOT to, frankly yes, I think it would be.  I can see how it'd be off putting to give someone a guest when you don't even want them there in the first place, but these are your fiance's brothers, not some rando cousin or far flung friend.  If they're really going to cause havoc, it might be worth putting your foot down and have FMIL be upset about it - you'll have to decide. I would give the +1's."
weddingplanning,3e30vi,SuperiorHedgehog,5,Tue Jul 21 16:04:47 2015 UTC,I don't think it's rude at all. You don't want to invite them so you shouldn't have to pay for them (if you allow it)
weddingplanning,3e30vi,Grimmy430,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the sibling and their situations! Personally, the rule for mine is...if you aren't living with someone else....then they aren't coming. Even my sister has been informed that she will not be getting a +1 unless her current flavor of the month puts a ring on her finger. This is pretty much because she goes through boys like I go through coffee....so yea....  I mean, if FMIL is going to pay...then I guess it won't be awful if they have a +1 unless you really think these FBILs are going to be trouble otherwise? I think it really just depends on each situation."

weddingplanning,3e30vi,inquisicat,3,Tue Jul 21 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"I'm an only child, but FI has two brothers and a sister.  The sister and one of the brothers are both in long-term relationships, and we are inviting their SOs.  The other brother isn't in a relationship, and we aren't offering him a +1.  He'll be traveling with family, he'll be lodging with family, he'll be sitting with family at the reception, so it's not like he'll be alone.  Your situation seems similar - these FBILs aren't going to be riding solo at your wedding.  They're going to be surrounded by family.  They're not in relationships, they don't need travel buddies, and I don't think you're obligated to offer a +1.    However, your wedding is still a ways off, and there's a chance one or both of them could start seeing somebody and wind up in a serious relationship by the time your wedding rolls around.  In that case, I think it would be the nice thing to do to extend a +1."
weddingplanning,3e30vi,halcyon3608,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be rude. I actually went through a very similar situation with my FSIL.   Both my FH and I gave our parents 10 guests that they could invite, no questions asked, if they paid for them. That ballooned up a bit on my FMIL's side. When we were discussing this at this past Easter dinner, one of my FH's sisters jokingly (like she thought it was a given) asked if she would be getting a plus one. I knew she was single so I said no. I told her that unless you are in a relationship with someone at the time invites go out, or you don't know anyone else at the wedding, you aren't getting a plus one. She retorted and said that her mom (my FMIL) would happily pay for her plus one, but I calmly reinforced that it would not be happening. Not only is she not in a relationship, but she will know 75% of the guests at the wedding between her family and mutual friends of me and my FH.   I would discuss this with your FH, come to an agreement (whatever it is) and then let him discuss it with his mother and brothers. Make sure you're on the same page, but it shouldn't be your fight if your FMIL is going to be pushy about it."
weddingplanning,3e30vi,ilaich21,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"If you have the space in your budget and on your guest list, I would recommend extending the option. It's no fun to be alone at a wedding, especially when you're single."
weddingplanning,3e30vi,dangerouswhenbored,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:11 2015 UTC,"I'm only giving +1s to people in relationships, as of right now only one of my FH's brothers is getting a +1."
weddingplanning,3e30vi,mbltlh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"Personally I think immediate family should get +1s. I am giving one to my sister, though she's also a bridesmaid. If FMIL is paying, why not? Is it worth the fight? You probably won't even notice their dates on your wedding day because you'll be too busy with people you do care about."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,batboobies,41,Tue Jul 21 12:49:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't draw any extra attention to it if you can. But not to hide anything from your homophobic family of course. More to treat it like a normal situation, which it is. The sexual orientation of your bridal/grooms party is none of your families business. You can't stop them from gossiping among themselves of course, but hopefully they have enough class to keep their opinions to themselves during a wedding. It's sort of a given to not be a dick at a wedding, and drawing attention to it on the invitation or something I think would have the opposite effect and sort of add fuel to the fire. It would make it the hot conversation among everyone at that point, sort of putting your friends and their orientation on the spotlight which I'm sure they don't want.   However if there's anyone you think may be more extreme(or cause a scene) perhaps assign someone to keep an eye on them, and be prepared to ask them to leave if they get out of hand. Hopefully it doesn't come to that and people keep their negative opinions quiet for one day, but better to be prepared!"
weddingplanning,3e2e05,Loaf_Butt,10,Tue Jul 21 13:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'd choose the latter. Unless you have reason to believe that they'd get aggressive or violent, saying something upfront might be counter productive.   Will you have security at your wedding? The day of, if someone insists on being an ass, you can always tell that person that that kind of behaviour is not welcome so they can be respectful or leave."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,BrightLights0604,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"I wanted to say the same thing.  If you can, try to get someone who will stand up for your friends the day of so you don't have to worry on your special day."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,theprancingpuppy,7,Tue Jul 21 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"I'd stay quiet on this one unless you have reason to expect that someone specific will be rude about it or make a scene. You mentioned that they're generally too polite to say anything to someone in public, why would your wedding be any different?"
weddingplanning,3e2e05,snickerdoodleglee,6,Tue Jul 21 13:22:24 2015 UTC,"I would just rely on courtesy. Ultimatums are incredibly juvenile, and you don't need to stoop down to that level. Honestly, all these people are adults, and I think you should trust them to act like it. If you want to include some subtle hints in the wedding website that the wedding is gay friendly (such as having an ""about the wedding party section"" and mentioning the bridesmaid-MOH relationship there) maybe the really bigoted ones will stay away, but I wouldn't go further than that. Honestly, even if someone does say something rude about it, I'm sure the lgbt guests are not thin-skinned enough to let it get to them, and they won't blame you for you relatives' behaviour."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,bismuth92,6,Tue Jul 21 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"You could make a wedding website with bios of your bridal party.  Put the website address on the invites, encourage your family to go to your website (put your registry info on the website too, family always hassles you over registry information).  That is a polite / discrete way of warning your family that there will be gay people in your wedding, and it should give your family a chance to flip out (and be uninvited) or get used to the idea.   That said, it sounds like your bigoted family members will probably be in the minority at your wedding.  It also sounds like they're aware that you are LBGT friendly, and that they're generally polite.  I doubt they'll make a scene and if they do, it will get quashed immediately."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,Jani2349,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:40 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest this too.  Openly celebrate your friends!  It's a nice thing to do, and will clearly signal to the bigots what they will be facing and that their views are not welcome."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,robotneedslove,4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to say or do anything. People's sexual preferences shouldn't be anyone's business then their own. People are there at your wedding for you and your FH not to get uppity about other people's sexual preferences. If they make a stink about it at the wedding, shame on them and I feel embarrassed for their behavior!"
weddingplanning,3e2e05,KorinS,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"As everyone else said I would just say nothing and hope they are on their best behaviour. The only point I would say something is if you started hearing negative comments before the wedding about your bridal party. This is your special day, and if they are going to be nasty individuals then you have every right to nip the situation in the butt the way you feel is necessary."
weddingplanning,3e2e05,KaylaR2828,3,Tue Jul 21 13:45:57 2015 UTC,"FH and I are in a very similar situation.  I have some religious extended family who are openly homophobic.  One of my bridesmaids is a lesbian, and she's pretty butch and will be wearing a suit so it'd be pretty hard to miss.  Her partner and a few other same sex couples will also be at the wedding.  Also, one of our close friends is Muslim and wears a hijab, and I've heard anti-Muslim comments from the same family members before.  I'm terrified of someone being totally ignorant and making a loud comment that hurts feelings.  No one is violent, so I'm sure the farthest it would go would be rudeness.  We're basically just trying to not bring attention to it.  We're also using our seating chart to keep any homophobic/racist people far away from same sex couples/anyone they may make mean-spirited comments about.  There's already a bit of talk about our ceremony not being in a church.  Our wedding will be the first secular ceremony on either side of my extended family.  So, it'll be interesting."

I hope and doubt that anyone would start something at a wedding - especially when you have a whole LGBT posse!

If there will be 100+ people, your relatives may not even notice, or if they do, they won't up and make a scene in front of everyone.  They already know you're openly bisexual so you having not-straight friends who you also wish to invite to your wedding shouldn't be shocking to them.  If your relatives are reasonable people, it should be fine to just carry on without saying anything unless they bring up the topic to you.  If they do bring it up, simply state that they're your friends and you want them there but don't give them an ultimatum.  If your relatives continue to object or threaten to now show up, say you're sorry they feel that way and that they'll be missed at the wedding."

weddingplanning,3e2e05,fluorowhore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"A lot (not all) of prejudices and hurtful thoughts and comments stem from ignorance. Having LGBQT friends and family present at your wedding is great and should be celebrated! Your family may not be exposed to that lifestyle a great deal and therefore have certain feelings about it, but when people start to see others as just other people, they may change their minds. Hopefully your wedding will be a moment for some family members to be able to see the love and commitment you and your friends share with each other. I don't think there is any need to come out and say anything, just be yourselves and they will either have a great time or have to bite their tongues, it's really not your problem but their own! Have a great time!"
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,mtam6,13,Tue Jul 21 15:35:30 2015 UTC,You have a sweetheart table for this exact reason. The two of you get a table and your bridal party sits wherever you put them. You honestly solved your own problem right there.
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,stormeegedon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:23 2015 UTC,I just didn't know if it was more common for seating the bridal party together still even with a sweetheart table since our party is so large...
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,stormeegedon,8,Tue Jul 21 16:12:43 2015 UTC,"That's the point of the sweetheart table. You have a head table with only the two of you. Bridal party can go wherever, and frankly, I doubt anyone would notice where you placed them since they aren't going to be on display like you two are. This is your wedding, there are no rules!"

weddingplanning,3e2xz4,Enilenif,4,Tue Jul 21 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"Best wedding I ever went to let the bridal party members sit with their SOs. Nothing really dictates that the bridal party has to have their own table if you guys are already separate, so I think you could keep them all together at a couple tables and you'd be fine!"
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,awwkelly,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"I have the same exact situation going on. My fiance is hell bent on keeping the wedding party together. Like, he WILL NOT budge on this. I have no idea why, he thinks it's traditional or something. I went to a wedding recently with a sweetheart table and 2 tables for the wedding party so they could sit with their SOs and it was fine. However, I personally do not like the idea of a sweetheart table because I want to be near my friends and not stuck with guests sitting down at my table and keeping me away from the party (this sounds cold hearted but I am having a receiving line after the ceremony to greet and thank my guests for coming so that I have time to enjoy my reception versus having to visit each table separately throughout the night). Some of my wedding party's guests know others at the wedding so I tried to seat them with those individuals. Others know no one so I put a table in right near the head table and put those plus 1's there. Granted, they don't know each other but they will be near their SO at least. I figure they will only be sitting for a short period of time, an hour at the most, and will get up and mingle/dance afterwards. It's a tricky situation but I think it will all work out. Good luck!"
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,CurlyCurler,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:46 2015 UTC,This is totally fine.   We did a sweetheart table and I say my bridal party all throughout the tables with the people they know the best.
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,notapeacock,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely sit your party with their SO's. You can do combinations of tables of five or six or eight. Or include other close friends. My husband and I had 8 total in our party, 5 of whom have SO's. We sat those 13 people plus 5 other important people and friends of them at three 6-person tables. Good luck!"

That way we can talk to our party and their sos can be with them and we don't have to be an awkward two person island.
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,MzScarlet03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"That's how my friend did it and it worked out great. I think the total table count was 24 or 26, MOH to right of bride, and BM to the left of groom made speeches easier. My SO was across from me, all bridesmaids and their SOs were on brides end of table, and opposite for groomsmen."
weddingplanning,3e2xz4,LauraBellz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"We're doing a sweetheart table, and then the round tables nearest us will be our wedding party and their significant others/dates.

weddingplanning,3e2xz4,Banter725,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"I've been in this boat in both scenarios (my FH is a many times over repeat groomsman) and it's a way better experience to get to sit with your date. At the one where we were separate I was sat with other significant others that I didn't really know way in the back. Honestly I barely saw my FH the whole night that way since after the meal he was giving toasts and catering to the couple. It's your day so you can do it however you want, but I think the display table for the bridal party is kind of outdated and people prefer to just sit with those they came with."

I have to admit, I was always hesitant about wearing my hair down because we are getting married on a rooftop by the beach etc (gah, all of the elements!!) and I didn't know how long it would 'hold' form for, etc.. but, at the same time, having a stiff up-do is just so not me.. so together we came up with this style that matches my dress perfectly and really goes with the timeless, elegant vibe of the wedding. She did a spectacular job and she's actually talking about putting some clip-in extensions in so that it holds longer and sits a bit tighter but I just love it, and can't stop looking at it!"

I have a lot of fine hair and a fair number of coarse and middle road strands.  I looked into the no 'poo movement and have been doing that for ~5 years. I shampoo when it feels to heavy for me, but it's once a month and not the standard.  I often go longer with cornstarch or baby powder. I mostly rinse and co-wash.  I don't heat style as often anymore, but I can.    I went slow. Wash every other day instead of every.  Wash every two days etc until it was mostly once a week or every two. Now down to once a month. There are people that no longer wash their hair.   If you have time to get adjusted and the strength (it drove me nuts at first) I recommend giving it a go."

If your coordinator is unable to explain why she's unresponsive or provide a timeline you should expect a reply from and adhere to that, I'd let her know you're uncomfortable moving forward with her services and outline a timeline that you would feel appropriate with - just see what she says."

weddingplanning,3e36w6,CurlyCurler,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"I would suggest a nice charcuterie board (various meats, cheeses, honey, grapes, pears, nuts, berries) which would go well with all the wine. Us girls typically like to graze/snack than have a heavy meal. That, along with other side dishes that the rest of the 'maids bring, should be enough to fill all the bellies.  If you want to give all the girls a nice base layer before going out drinking for the night, maybe a self-serve taco bar would be cool and easy to do? brown up some ground beef with taco seasonings, prepare the toppings (salsa, guac, sour cream, lettuce, cilantro/onions, limes), set out some tortillas (crunchy and soft, for variety) and you're set. Or you can do a casserole or lasagna which is easy to keep warm if covered. Neither of these options are ""neat"" but they do qualify as ""fun"" and ""delicious!""  If you only want to provide protein (since the rest of the ladies will be bringing sides) I would suggest either a marinated/seasoned pork loin or baked chicken (drumsticks would be easy to eat one-handed if there's a wine glass or a paintbrush in the other hand)."
weddingplanning,3e36w6,ilikethenumber37,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"to add to this, crock pot cooking was made for this task!  you could do a shredded chicken either with salsa or bbq sauce and do tacos or sliders. Just drop in a pound of chicken and a can of salsa or 16 oz of bbq sauce and let it cook on low for 5-6 hours or on high for 3-4. The chicken will shred super easy with forks :)"

The hardest thing for me was that it had to be Halal because one of the girls coming was Muslim, but it worked just fine!  As long as it gets ""Stirred"" every 3-5 minutes it's fine to just sit there for hours.   Edit: You can prep everything beforehand literally it's just drop the cheese in ad wait until it melts. Prep time was about 30 minutes the night before for me."

Do you guys like hiking? Basically what my FH did was pop the question on a look out on one of the mountain trails we climbed during a camping trip. We keep hand sanitizer in our packs so he did put the ring on right away and we enjoyed the moment. I did clean my hands a bit later. I still wore mine the whole trip! I did put it back in it's box if I was in a particularly messy situation like cleaning dishes etc. I honestly wouldn't worry about it too much and maybe just a card with the picture of you 2 framed for a gift at dinner that way you don't have to spend a lot of money?

weddingplanning,3e2or3,catsandchaitea,6,Tue Jul 21 14:46:14 2015 UTC,How about a chain for the ring? If she doesn't want to wear it while camping she can keep it around her neck. Especially if you don't know her ring size.

But you could get her something camping related that wouldn't be too expensive and would probably work to fake her out.   I wouldn't worry about getting the ring dirty, although the purell is probably a good idea for her hands. The fact of the matter is that most e-rings are made to be worn day in and out and can take a pretty good beating. I wear mine camping, exercising, gardening, washing dishes, etc. I take it in every 6 months for an inspection, but I definitely don't think it needs to be treated with kid gloves.   Also, hide that ring well, man. Personally I know that when I go camping everyone's bags/pockets etc. are fair game when looking for a knife, a lighter, etc. So don't discount the possibility of her finding the ring while searching for TP!"
weddingplanning,3e2or3,hannchen,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking on this, if you normally give her jewellery, there is in fact lots of cheap jewellery that looks expensive. You could probably fake her out with that."

It was definitely a freak storm, and the weather prediction kept throwing it between Saturday-Monday up until the day of.

weddingplanning,3e3bg2,Yavemar,4,Tue Jul 21 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"Meteorologist here.  El Niño will increase your probability of getting rain, yes.  However, that doesn't make day-to-day weather forecasting any different - you still won't have any idea about any specific day until a few days ahead of time.  Right now, this map from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center is about as specific as possible at this time.  This shows that for SoCal, there is a 33-40% chance that the Aug-Sept-Oct period (note that this doesn't just include October) will be wetter than average.    It should also be noted that last weekend's rain was mainly due to the remnants of Hurricane Dolores.  A hurricane getting that close to coastal California is extremely rare, judging by all the smashed precipitation records, and not necessarily related to El Niño.  Basically, don't worry too much about it yet.  El Niño doesn't mean that suddenly every weekend will be like last weekend, it just means you might see a couple more random showers than usual over the next few months."

A continuous loop of ""Bride Loves Groom Loves"" inspired by the one seen here   Is there perhaps something like that the two of you share?  Like a design of molecules?  Additionally the music I've chosen for the bridal procession is an orchestral version of a game.  For those not as nerdy its just nice music, but its recognizable for those that know."

weddingplanning,3e2ukr,newbieketoer1,4,Tue Jul 21 15:24:43 2015 UTC,You could use music from some of your favorite shows/movies. We're using the Game of Thrones theme song for our recessional music and Concerning Hobbits for the processional music. We're also planning on using Vitamin String Quartet's versions of a lot of songs for before the ceremony and at the beginning of the reception.  For our cake topper I think we're going to get either bride and groom Halo Spartans or storm troopers!    Also I think it's really exciting to find another vet student on here!!

Some species of Beetles are BEAUTIFUL and would make amazing centerpieces if placed in frames, maybe surrounded by flowers.   If there's a Paxton Gate near you, you can find a wide array of incredibly beautiful scientific/naturalist things like bismuth crystals.   Old navigational equipment that was used to measure the stars could also be really pretty, and a reference to how you're finding your path together.  It really depends: What else do you have in your decor?"
weddingplanning,3e2ukr,AuroraRose41,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what we are doing! As you can tell from my flair, I am calling it Geeky Formal: A formal/traditional wedding with small geeky touches.   I designed our Save The Dates myself, and they have binary on them and say ""Programmed for each other"" (we met in a progamming class in college). We are both electrical engineers, so I want to design some formal letterpressed invitations with a gold foil PCB print in the corners, and we also plan to have that same gold PCB print on the cake.   I found this video game scavenger hunt idea on Offbeat Bride, and we plan to do this as well. For this, we just plan to set out a basket of cards and let people take them if they want to do it. Our friends will love it because many of them play video games or RPGs.   You could do test tube shots as a signature drink, or use chemistry equipment in your centerpieces. I have an entire Pinterest board dedicated to this, feel free to check it out for more inspiration!"

Things like the cake topper and centerpieces are much more difficult to be subtle with, I haven't figured out anything super subtle for those yet. We are totally going to town with photobooth props though."

weddingplanning,3e2kpc,ami5000,3,Tue Jul 21 14:06:14 2015 UTC,"Such a stressful time! Some things you can work on this far in advance are your guest list and budget. Those are two big factors that impact a lot of other decisions so it'll be good to get them out of the way early. With all the excitement you might feel like you want to start picking your wedding party right away, but most people don't recommend doing that when you're looking at a longer engagement. You never know what might happen in two years, relationships with friends change, etc. Good luck!"
weddingplanning,3e2kpc,princessponyta,3,Tue Jul 21 14:16:16 2015 UTC,"Lovely Ring! It really looks stunning on you. :)  Start by thinking about your guest list. You don't need an exact number, but figure out if this is going to be a small, average, or really big wedding. When you've got that information, start looking at venues. June 2017 may seem far away, but many venues around me are already booked up for Spring/Summer Saturdays in 2017."

weddingplanning,3e2bv0,bismuth92,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the houses are obvious colour theme choices, if we were to pick one we'd probably go for the red and gold. I'm really torn between keeping the colour theme in with the Harry Potter theme, or have a different colour theme and fit the Harry Potter bits in with that."
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,grimmauld12,8,Tue Jul 21 12:56:16 2015 UTC,You could also just go with the Hogwarts colors - purple and gold. I always loved this wedding.

Maybe if I see a really cute cake-topper (to be used on a pie!) on Etsy in a reasonabl3 price range, but mostly just our color scheme. We're trying to keep things pretty simple as far as decor goes, and no seating chart so no need for table names."
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,Enilenif,8,Tue Jul 21 14:26:34 2015 UTC,"I am a complete Potterhead, but I will say that marauders' map invitations and open references aren't ""subtle"" (if that's what you're going for). Guests who don't get it would definitely think it was weird if they got seated at Godric's Hollow or Spinner's End. If you go all-out (and please do!!) just know that older guests especially will have some opinions about it. As for subtle ideas... In your vows you could include ""after all this time?"" ""Always."""
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,Enilenif,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks for your response. I do agree that some of the things we'd like aren't subtle, however, I don't think people would realise what the theme is if that makes sense. For example, my grandparents haven't really seen Harry Potter, so they'd probably just think the invites were unusual ;)   Probably the more subtle stuff would be things like table centre pieces, and other decorations around the venue. Whereas the invites and table names, and of course the Honeydukes table would be the more obvious references."

I want to have my reception at the Three Broomsticks. I just absolutely love the whole idea.   House colors are obvious, but might be clashy/hard to coordinate/obvious. Try fall/harvest-ish colors - greens, gold, red, etc.? This could be good to coordinate flowers, too. Royals and gem tones would work nice, too. Potions as drinks/cocktails - use dry ice! Love the sweets table idea! For centerpieces - what about long taper candles in wine bottles? That would be reminiscent of the Great Hall without being super obvious. I even think you could get away with lots of greenery and candles. Or terrariums & succulents! For invitations, instead of doing a recreation of the map, what if you just made it look map-ish?  Put a Sorting Hat on your table where they pick up their escort cards!   Edit: spelling derp"
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,orchidsandtea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:54 2015 UTC,"I've never seen escort cards at a wedding before (I'm a wedding videographer, so I've been to plenty of weddings now) - I literally discovered them whilst hunting through google earlier. Maybe it's because they aren't popular in the UK. Would they be used instead of a table plan and place names?"
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,ididntdoityet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:08 2015 UTC,"In the US, they're used rather interchangeably - nobody knows that place cards are supposed to be called escort cards, and everyone gets them confused. They're basically the same thing, so yes, I would use them as the little card that has the guest name and table number on it so they can find where they're sitting."
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,princessponyta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:05 2015 UTC,Ah okay... I saw some earlier today that were attached to little keys which would fit nicely with a HP theme.  In response to your previous post ideas we have a cocktail bar at the venue that we are able to rename the cocktails so I'm quite excited for that.   The main thing I'm not sure about is the centrepieces - I was thinking about doing little bird cages maybe... but at the moment it's just an idea floating around my head
weddingplanning,3e2bv0,midnightjasmine1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"I think that all sounds pretty great - and I love the birdcage idea - maybe you could have some owls around, too?"

The menu is including 4 Harry Potter themed drinks. The present table we're  putting a birdcage with Hedwig in it to put cards in as well. We're also going to have my bridesmaids hold up wands and groomsmen hold up lightsabers for our ceremony exit, and we're going to have some Harry Potter props for our photo booth.

I bought non-self inking one when we got engaged, and was like cool, let me save some money, i can ink it myself. Yeah, its way less consistent and does not look nearly as good as a self inking one. Splurge a little. But definitely do get a stamp.    Check to see if your passport will be valid for your honeymoon, if applicable. Renew or apply more than 6 weeks in advance.    Remember, you don't need one invitation per guest, you need one invitation per household :)    Do everything at least a month before you think you need to do it. Time flies, and decisions are hard!"

weddingplanning,3e0pok,peanutbuddy,4,Tue Jul 21 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"Buying a self-inking return address stamp from Etsy was one of my best wedding planning decisions!    Hmmm, some other things this sub helped me learn along the way:   Number your RSVP cards.  I just sent out my invites so I haven't had to use the numbers yet, but I'm sure someone will mess up.  You don't need inner envelopes.  This sub taught me about the ""we have reserved ___ seats(s) in your honor"" line and made me feel better when I forgot to get inner envelopes (an envelope that goes in another envelope?? I seriously didn't know these were a thing and then had a panic attack when Googling how to address my outer-only envelopes.)  Your wedding day may be the biggest, most important day of your life, but it's just another party to your guests.  No one cares as much about your wedding as you (and your SO) do.  Picking someone to be in your bridal party will not magically improve your relationship with them.  Asking my very picky, traditional, competitive-natured older sister to be my matron of honor did not make our relationship better or automatically bring us closer.  She's still the same pain the ass who teases me (but I still love her).  You may not have the ""this is one omg happy tears!!"" feeling when getting your dress and that's ok.  I had a ""I'm tired of shopping and this one is really pretty let's just get it and I'm ok with not looking anymore"" feeling when getting my dress.  Let's face it, there's a lots of pretty dresses out there and lots of dresses that could be ""the one"" and I could have shopped for months.  Recognizing when to stop looking was important. Spend money on things that make your life easier and don't feel bad about it.  Yes I could have saved hundreds of dollars making my own centerpieces.  But I hate crafting so hiring the florist to do it for me is money well spent."

I honestly liked 90% of the dresses I tried on and could not decide for the life of me. The consultant kept telling me I was being too quiet -- I was thinking, woman!!! I was more bent out of shape that I didn't get a dress from the first appointment I went to because the consultant was amazing.

weddingplanning,3e0pok,roryn58,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"Holy crap 13% tax!!!  But yeah, for every price quote I get, even if logically I can work out what tax is applied to (generally everything) and what gratuity is applied to (generally food/beverage costs), I still explicitly ask the vendor.  Also ask about additional recommended gratuity for services such as bartenders, etc.  It makes the email correspondences longer, but it really helps us get a closer estimate of the expected final costs."

If my FH was in a wedding party and I didn't get to sit with him, even if I knew other people I was sitting with, I would be sad. Thats just my opinion though! But I honestly don't think 14 people is to many. Thats only 6 people on each side of you and your FH, I think it would work out fine :)"

weddingplanning,3e41v5,IroncladPen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Since there would only be 3-4 of them (one of which is a 16 y/o girl - FH's little brother's gf) that might be awkward. I think I would be better off splitting them up and putting them with people they know (gf with FH's parents, my friend's bf with some people we went to a music festival with) or might like (my sister's gay BFF who is her +1 with my cousin who she wants to play matchmaker for)."
weddingplanning,3e41v5,IroncladPen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:23 2015 UTC,"That might be the best idea.  I went to a wedding with my FH for one of his friends.  FH was in the bridal party and got to sit at the head table.  I got stuck at a table with random people instead of getting to sit with FH's parents, which I would have preferred."
weddingplanning,3e41v5,MrsCaptainPicard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"If you have your venue picked out, talk to them about the logistics of a 14 person head table. I have been to a wedding that they kept the head table large but had to move it to the center of the seating area with the other tables around it. Your venue will know what they can and cannot comfortably accommodate and you can make your decision from there. Do what you think is best and works for your wedding.   In my experience, people are used to being separated from their SO in these instances, so don't do something you're uncomfortable with to make other people happy.  Most receptions have signed tables only until the dancing starts and people mingle from then on, so even if you have people separated, it's like an hour out of their lives, they will be fine."

weddingplanning,3dyxxh,Mamabones,5,Tue Jul 21 03:30:27 2015 UTC,Yes! This is exactly what I want to do too.  I just worry cause succulents don't tend to run cheap.  Were you able to find a good deal?
weddingplanning,3dyxxh,atthebridges,8,Mon Jul 20 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"Well I knew I was going to use succulents from the get-go so I started propagating a year out. Unfortunately my babies didn't like last winter. There just wasn't enough sun so they didn't grow more than a couple inches, if that. I had to take another route and since I have some experience with succulents, I decided to buy mostly cuttings and let them root. I bought about 75 cuttings 25 two inch and 12 four inch from thesucculentsource.etsy.com (approximately $190). I also bought two mature plants from succulentjewels.etsy.com ($20) and a couple more, maybe four, from a local farmers market (about $12).   After I started making the arrangements, I realized I needed just a few more so I ran to Home Depot and spent a stupid amount for just a few plants.   So $222 for most of them and then maybe another $35 from Home Depot (not part of the budget. Ugh.)  I'm cheap, was that a good deal?"
weddingplanning,3dyxxh,baconandicecreamyum,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"These look great! We're doing something very similar with succulents with the thought being 1) we can DIY and 2) they'll last a long time. How far in advance did you make your centerpieces? Could you do the bouquet in advance, too?"
weddingplanning,3dyxxh,dreadpiraterose,3,Mon Jul 20 19:36:04 2015 UTC,Thanks! I made the centerpieces about 5-4 days out. I wired the succulents for the bouquet a week before and made the bouquet 2 days out. The fresh flowers didn't hold up that great but the succulents were fine. I had to rework the bouquet the morning of because some of the filler was droopy.
weddingplanning,3dyxxh,phantasmagorical,4,Mon Jul 20 23:51:00 2015 UTC,Gorgeous! Now I'm wondering about the cost.
weddingplanning,3dyxxh,RonRonner,4,Mon Jul 20 20:54:18 2015 UTC,Thanks! About $250 for the succulents. $50 for the milk glass dishes (I owned a bunch to begin with) and I made the cement pots (probably $30 for supplies).

weddingplanning,3dyxxh,msprings,3,Mon Jul 20 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"We had 9 tables in 3 rows. I made 60 small pots and 30 large pots out of hypertufa (lighter than cement).  I budgeted $400 for centerpieces. Plus another $200 for bouquet, corsage and ceremony decor.  I didn't have any bridesmaids so I just made one bouquet."

weddingplanning,3dzzza,nmuels,48,Mon Jul 20 22:16:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, I dummy-proofed the shit out of my RSVPs.   I think the ""It should be OBVIOUS that if your name isn't on the envelope, you aren't invited"" thing is extremely outdated. Hardly anyone looks at the envelope to see who it is directly addressed to, minus people who are grandparent-aged. Most people always assume that if its addressed to one person, its addressed to the couple/family.  So, I wrote names on envelopes. ""Smith family"", ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" ""John Smith & Jane Doe""  And I wrote the exact same thing on the ""M _______"" line on the RSVP card. Minus the ""M"", because I think its kinda dumb. Not only did that alleviate the ""they didn't put their name on the RSVP card"" conundrum, it also let them know very clearly who was invited. (I also  put on there ""John Smith and Guest"" to give people +1's)  But wait! Theres more!   I also wrote down under the ""coming/not coming"" check box  ""___ out of ___"" attending. And wrote the number in the second blank.  No scratched-out numbers, no phone calls asking if so-and-so is invited, I didn't hear a thing if people were offended or not."

I have had to get a second job to help pay for this damn wedding (and that is with both sides contributing a significant amount) so homie doesn't have time to play the ""lets invite everyone!"" game. Yes, it may be bad manners and yes people might have their feelings hurt but at the end of the day this is money coming out of my pocket for a party that I am throwing. My invites say:  ""RSVP by such and such a date.  Dear whomever:  We have reserved (this many) seats in your honor.  Accept Decline Number of people attending""  And at the very end I included ""while children are a blessing and a joy, we respectfully ask that our wedding be an adults only ceremony and reception.""

We are doing the ceremony at a free location and the reception at home so we can afford to have everyone, but if we were on a per-head basis, no way. You gotta do what's right for you on your wedding day, and others should understand and either accommodate or respectfully decline."

weddingplanning,3dzzza,inquisicat,4,Mon Jul 20 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Right now we have the ""we have reserved __ seat(s) for you"" on our mock up...will see if I can get that past my mom who thinks that's rude. She's suggesting we do digital RSVPs which is surprising since 3 years ago she insisted her friends wouldn't be able to figure that out for my sis wedding.  Digital RSVPs seem cost efficient and convenient but I'm curious how people control that shit since the form that comes with my site doesn't give a limit option."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,atlautiger,10,Mon Jul 20 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"So RSVPify (which I feel confident I will be using) has a drop down selection...and you can only select the # that you have deemed for that name.  So the name is ""John Smith"" and in your entry to the site you gave John Smith 1 seat. John Smith can't add on, because he can either respond 1 or 0.  This is why I decided to go RSVPify...I don't want add-on's I clearly don't know. I'm sure people will try, but if I can lower that amount, by all means I will try  EDIT: My best friend did ""We have reserved __ Seat(s) for you"" and it isn't rude.

I have been invited to a wedding once where my SO was not invited. I considered this person a good friend until then. I simply didn't attend or send a card or gift. I know you will never please everyone, but what it looks like when you invite one half of a relationship to an event celebrating love, is that you are sacrificing the comfort of your guests to the almighty dollar. Please don't be mad at my comments, I'm just offering a point of view from the other side. I wish you the best in planning!"
weddingplanning,3dzzza,margari7a,6,Tue Jul 21 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"This just happened to me. My fiancé received an invite from his cousin that was addressed to only him. Am I invited? The way it's addressed I don't think I am. When we go to the RSVP website it says to select how many people are coming and then says ""Max two per party."" That makes me think I can? awkward. I think people should spell it out as much as they can, so there are no questions. I feel awkward going to this wedding if I wasn't supposed to, I feel awkward asking and I feel weird staying home too!"
weddingplanning,3dzzza,Dr-nightshade,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd have your fiance give that cousin a call - just say 'Hey cuz, I received your invite!  When I went to RSVP on your site, it says max of two - does that mean thisisaghostyo is invited to come with me as well?'   I just wanted to verify since the invite didn't specify.'"

weddingplanning,3dzzza,haicra,0,Tue Jul 21 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"I had a good friend follow the ""no ring, no bring"" rule.  I actually think this is a great way to surround your day with relationships that have made the lifelong commitment to marry or to become married.  It's not saying, ""Your BF doesn't exist, so there.""  It's just saying, ""Look, I have to draw the line somewhere, and I know friend's SO won't be around in two years, so why should I pay for them to party and have them in my photos?  It's just going to be a bad memory for most of us in a few years.""  That's not a judgement call on your relationship - just a point of view from the side of financial constraint and practicality.  Sorry you took your friend's (most likely very) necc. choice so personally."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,kyrien,14,Tue Jul 21 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"By that logic, I shouldn't have honoured my common law relationship friends and family. No ring, but certainly a long term commitment. Are we to shun the folks who don't want to get married, but still believe in long term relationships?"
weddingplanning,3dzzza,kglplusace,6,Tue Jul 21 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"Apparently. Many people in this sub believe themselves to be experts on deciding which relationships are ""real"" or not."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,JLPphoto,3,Tue Jul 21 12:53:00 2015 UTC,"I think it depends more on if they know people or not. Like if I had a friend coming from out of town or flying in, and they knew friends at the wedding, and they are single, then I'm not worrying about plus ones.   But if they only know me, or my fiancé, then they get a plus one.    Otherwise my general rule of thumb is plus ones need to have been dating for at least six months, and I need to have met them once if not twice."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,mellamosarah,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:23 2015 UTC,"We are having a 50 people, late night wedding on a Friday.  It is low budget, low key, and mostly low stress.  There have been a couple bumps in the planning road, but for the most part is has been smooth.  Here's the worst we've faced:  As far as the RSVPs go, we are inviting 98% couples, we also don't want anyone feeling like they should go stag if they are in a relationship.  We aren't doing the bouquet toss or garder toss because of the fact almost everyone is in a relationship.  We just added ""you and a guest"" to the invitations.  I also added little hand written notes to specific members of my family (his family is like 7 people... total) to pass the news on to members I have lost contact with (like my second cousins) mainly because all their names won't fit on the front or back side of an envelope, not to mention we are pretty spread out across the US.  The biggest conflict that I have had is my dad's side of the family.  I haven't spoken to my dad in 7 years.  I don't know that side of the family (I may have met everyone maybe once?) and I'm not wasting my invites and my money sending invitations to people I don't know nor really care about.  My mom and sister disagree, my grandma and FH are with me 100%.    As for children, The only ones coming are my kids (2 boys) and my sister's kids (2 girls - one of which should be here any day now).  All four of them will be gone right after dinner (around 9pm).  My boys are being dropped off at their father's house, by a sitter I'm paying to take them there (like I want my ex at my wedding...) and my sister will probably leave early because she'll have a 2 month old ( I don't expect her to have the energy to be at our wedding for long).  I did have one of my friends refuse to be a bridesmaid because I told her she couldn't bring her 4 kids (all teenagers - the twins are autistic).  She got offended, complained that they wanted to be there, blah, blah, blah.  I told her, I understand.  She said she wasn't coming because of it, complained that my kids were going to be there, blah, blah, blah, its not fair.  I explained to her the situation, she questioned my FH integrity, and I said that I'm sorry she felt that way, and I'll see her at the bachelorette party.  If she shows, then no hurt feelings, I understand; if she doesn't, then  again, I'm sorry.  I stand by my word, she is 1 person out of 50 that are invited (2 if you count her date... whoever that was going to be)."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,moarpi34me,3,Tue Jul 21 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, way to take the high road with your friend. That's a yucky situation!"
weddingplanning,3dzzza,lilrileydragon,4,Tue Jul 21 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"Doing online RSVP on my wedding site so this isn't really applicable in your case I suppose...  I don't anticipate that any of my friends or family will be bringing rando's without asking before hand (and respecting my answer), but I'm explicitly stating on the RSVP the names of each person invited, with a checkbox (or maybe I should do a pair of radio buttons) next to each button for whether that person is attending.  This applies to children as well.  If I were to have done physical RSVP cards, I would have gone with ""___ of # are attending"", where # is a number I write in myself.  If anyone asks, I'll just tell them the venue has limited space."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,AtlasWontPutMeDown,3,Tue Jul 21 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"I totally put ""We have reserved __ seats in your honor"" and had no problem with it.  I have received invitations with the same."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,Blugentoo2therevenge,3,Tue Jul 21 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"We recently had an adults only wedding - and also attempted the RSVP with a preset number.  You would be shocked at the responses you will get - we had people simply write in a different number over the top of the number we allotted.  In those cases we simply gave in and allowed the extra person - keep in mind this was a very small outdoor wedding with only 90 guests - so when we had 6 guests write in their own extra person - we felt the impact, leaving us needing an additional table (with flowers/etc.).    Our language for the adult only was the standard ""we love your kids but we politely ask bla bla bla..."" and we took some major body blows on no kids - in fact, our plan was similar - 1 flower girl, 1 ring bearer as kids and we ended up having to scratch both kids due to the amount of complaints and downright rude comments we received.    In the end no one showed up with their kids after all (even though we had two couples spread the word they were going to bring them anyways - not kidding).  I would highly recommend the adult only wedding, if you are on the fence what we did was calculate the number of kids who would come if you allowed it -- we tallied 30 kids (remember 90 guests!) -- that would totally change the dynamic of our wedding had we allowed it.  If you stick to your guns you may actually receive a few thank you's after for it-- we did, but still had some upset parents.   Good luck on reversing the +1...our approach was ""If we haven't met the +1, they aren't invited!"" it worked for some but not all, in the end we cracked and let most of them just come."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,edmandarnditt,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:03 2015 UTC,"We are inviting max capacity and having a no kids wedding so I was dreading any potential drama. Granted I've just sent out invites not too long ago and only gotten 20/175 of them back so far, but everything has gone super smoothly so far.   We put on our rsvp cards as well as wedding website ""we hope the parent will enjoy taking the night off for this adult only event"". As far as kids my 3 nieces will be there (oldest two are flower girls, and a new born. Sister/mom to them is matron of honor) as well as FHs sisters boy and she is a bridesmaid. I was still worried about our wording 'adult only' and having these kids. But everyone I've talked to says bridal party and their kids are seen as an exception to those who value the etiquette side of things.   I had one scare since a cousin who has two kids and lives in Florida contacted me before he got his invitation while it was on its way to him still in the mail. I really didn't think he or his wife would want to make the trip to Ohio from Florida and here he was saying how excited he was and they wanted to make travel engagements. Knowing he hadn't seen the 'no kids' line yet, I slyly thanked him for his excitement and told him all info could be found on our wedding website (where he'd inevitably find the no kids line). Shortly after, they rsvp'd online and not a word was said.   I know it's not always the case, but people have been way cooler with me than I was mentally giving them credit for beforehand."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,wahoo20,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"My BIL is getting married in three weeks, and had a very short engagement.  When my husband and I got married, we invited the whole church family to our ceremony.  Only invited guests were given reception details, and no one had any issues with that.  My BIL and his fiancee did the same.  Yesterday, my MIL got an email from a socially awkward (but really sweet!) lady from church asking for help picking something from their registry AND if she was invited to the reception or not.  My MIL cringed and asked me for help in gently letting her down.  We settled on something like, ""The bride's family is paying for the wedding and reception and we want to respect their finances.  Thus, we welcome the church family to be witness to the ceremony (that is, after all, the most important part!) .  This is what we did for X and Y's wedding as well, and it has been tradition for many families in our church.  I guess we should have included a line, ""The only gift necessary is your presence!""""  Aren't weddings kind of wack-a-doodle?!?!  They really bring out the weirdest in everyone. :)"
weddingplanning,3dzzza,laur371,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, like a ton of people have said, it is now fashionable and considered polite to send along an RSVP card already filled out like ""___ of 2 will attend ceremony"". Last wedding I attended, sent mail in RVSPs with the second line prefilled, making it clear that children weren't welcome, if I had any (I didn't). Didn't stop the whole damn church from bringing their kids however, as I later found out. if outsiders are looking at this thread, for gods sakes, please pay attention to the DAMN NUMBER PREFILLED."

I do this because I have a million cousins and I'm being super strict with who is invited. Because let's be honest, I don't have the money to invite double my guest list, I also don't want a wedding with like 200 people."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,octoberzebra,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm being super-specific about addressing and invitation wording, and we are doing digital RSVPs that tell guests exactly who and how many in their party  and only has a drop-down for yes/no so not only will there be no mistaking who's invited, there will be no way for them to add extras to their RSVP.  I ain't playin'."
weddingplanning,3dzzza,mrsbelltobe,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Sortof a rant but...Better to explicitly state things and remove all doubt then have to deal with unexpected guests (costs) on your big day. You could tell mom that she's footing the bill for the additional guests if she wants them to come. We are telling people like it is, if they don't like it then they are welcome to call me and explain why they are entitled to it. Weddings aren't free and those vendors are gonna get their money and if not being allowed to come to the wedding is the worse thing these people have had happen to them in their life then they are living a pretty good life. Plus, maybe it's assumed they'll be heartbroken or want to come when they could not give a shit. Might be worth calling them to be like ""you aren't invited but here's why"" so they aren't left sitting mulling. Just ideas/thoughts"
weddingplanning,3dzzza,ihatechickens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"A serious thought I've been having:  While I am being really stringent on +1s and children, part of me wonders if we are ruining friendships. I may fall out of touch with a person over the tension this causes. Is it worth it then? No, not really.   I know a had a friend (not super close but close) not invite me to her tiny wedding and although I understood why, I don't thinks will ever be quite the same as they would have been.

I'd suggest looking at your contract and seeing If there's anything written about when you can expect your pictures. If that doesn't help, contact your photographer and inquire about it directly. This is a real busy time for wedding photographers, so yours could just be a little backed up. It really just depends in them though. I know fantastic photographers who deliver from three weeks out to a couple of months. Ask your photographer when you might expect them by."

Just because someone has more years on you doesn't mean you or more or less of a friend to the bride.

""oh jessica, i know you are just sooooo busy with the kids! what can i help with? i have a ton of free time this week and i'd just love to spend it making our friend's shower the best! you've already done all the big planning, why don't you let me help with the details?""  Seriously though, not having a headcount 4 days out is bad. Not having a budget is really bad. Even if there are a few maybes or people you are checking with, you sould at least have a general idea of the size and budget!"
weddingplanning,3e39eo,jwallwalrus26,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:31 2015 UTC,"I dunno, my MOH has kids and she handles it just fine.  You should definitely talk to her about it but come at is as a trying to help and mentioning that you just want to take some of the burden off of her, but if she takes it as an insult and isn't willing to hand some things off to you, then it is time to talk to the bride."
weddingplanning,3e39eo,rmric0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"I like that advice, thank you."
weddingplanning,3e39eo,FancyPhilanges,3,Tue Jul 21 20:24:57 2015 UTC,I don't think it's the sort of thing you really need to worry the bride about or get all that worked up about yourself. (Maybe people are dragging their feet on RSVPs and the venue is being bad at communicating)? Do you have any relationship with the MoH? Where you could ask fi she needs you t take on anything (but phrased in a helpful/supportive way)?
weddingplanning,3e39eo,ams1989,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:36 2015 UTC,"Very little relationship with the MoH. I personally think she's annoying and rude. But I know that part of being in a bridal party is being with people you might not know/care for. Which I'm cool with! I hope that doesn't sound bitchy? But I'll try to talk to her again, she always tells me she's 'too busy helping with the wedding' which I don't understand. I mentioned to someone else, I wonder if this has to do with the fact that I'm the only single person in the wedding party."
weddingplanning,3e39eo,ams1989,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"Perfect! Ask her again and when she replies that she's ""too busy helping w/ the wedding"" then you tell her you'd be happy to help with the shower and take that shit over! ""i totally get that! why don't I call the last few stragglers and get things firmed up with the venue for decorating. Is there anything else that needs to be done?"" This way you're presenting it as being helpful to her and the bride, regardless of your feelings for her."
weddingplanning,3e39eo,chewbecca83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:54 2015 UTC,Thank you! That's really good advice. I've been stressed about this.
weddingplanning,3e39eo,ams1989,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:32 2015 UTC,"Let me say this, as a bride, my ""new girl"" friend has been the one that has stepped up to the plate and done the most for me. I'm literally blown away by how thoughtful and helpful she's been. My ""oldest friend"" hasn't done one. single. thing for me.   You go girl and you help that bride! There's a good possibility she's even a little frustrated with ""old friend"" because if she's pulling that tude with the shower, that's most likely not the first time she's been unreliable."

As for the bags themselves, go to Walmart and look in the aisle where the paper plates, plastic cups and utensils are and look for the paper bags there. Or they might be with the ziploc bags and aluminum foil (usually that's all in the same aisle, but my Walmart is screwy). You can get packs of like 10, and 50. There might be other numbers.

She insists my mom must have had a miscarriage after the wedding. I wish they would tell her that her craziness and my mom's mom's craziness is the real reason they didn't invite any family to their wedding. And my parents had been together for 4 or five years and had lived together for 3 when they eloped. Some people just can't imagine that other people do things differently."

weddingplanning,3dzfp8,CodenameSparklepants,21,Tue Jul 21 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"That is too funny! This is less an embarrassment and more of a ""parent on social media"" story, but my mom announced my engagement on Facebook before we did. We felt very strongly about telling family and close friends in person so we didn't put anything out on social media for about a month after the proposal. I knew my mom was dying to shout it from the rooftops (which I certainly can't be mad about) so I told her she could tell her friends since they have no connection to my social circle and I'd still get to tell all my friends. Well I guess I wasn't very clear because the next day I'm standing in line to get into a bridal show and I see on my Facebook a full-on engagement announcement with both FH and I tagged and photos of the ring and everything. Cue me screaming ""What the FUCK?!"" in front of a couple hundred brides.... oops. I really thought it was common sense to not out other peoples' news on facebook until they'd posted about it themselves, but I should not, in retrospect, have assumed my mother understood that particular social media etiquette intricacy. Luckily I was able to get in touch with her and kindly ask her to remove it so I still got to make my own announcement for the most part, but it was highly, highly face palm-y. And definitely my most bridezilla moment to date :P"

weddingplanning,3dzfp8,marqat,5,Tue Jul 21 05:20:00 2015 UTC,"This why we told my biological mother LAST. We made sure to call immediate family, worked our way down to texting photos of the ring to friends, and finally called her. Then our parents were allowed to post about it on Facebook. If I hadn't explicitly told them, I'm pretty sure they would have tagged us immediately!  I found out about a few family engagements (and one of my grandma's passing away) on Facebook... I try to keep important news in person as much as I can now."

Granted, our hairdresser is a wonderful woman. Very caring, easy to talk to, and amazing at what she does. But this is supposed to be a smaller affair, fairly close friends and family only, and unfortunately I don't know her well enough beyond the hair salon... Not to mention we're hiring her to do our hair that day. I managed to squeak out ""I haven't even started working on the guest list yet."" while looking like a deer in the headlights. Luckily she laughed it off and saved me by saying ""But I'm gonna be working on your hair that day!"" Later in the car my mom apologized, and said she realized she might have been out of line, and that she just got too excited.  I'm actually surprised I haven't had any facebook issues yet! Although, when asking my uncle via facebook last night about what tune I want him to play on his guitar while I walk down the aisle, he messaged me back that he'll see what he can do ""doesn't do messenger"" and said that I can just post future stuff on his wall.

weddingplanning,3e0lg1,N3rvousBride,4,Tue Jul 21 01:07:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a bridal consultant and I sew. If the dress has a zipper and is 3-4 inches too small, putting a corset in will 100% solve your problem, even if you don't lose any weight. You'll be fine! If you're still nervous, take a picture and show it to a local seamstress. You shouldn't actually get alterations done yet, but just having them say it's possible will definitely put your mind at ease if you don't believe a random internet stranger."

My anxiety level is off the charts with this dress thing. I really truly hope it does fit, if not I'm wearing a potato sack."

Got down too low at my cousins wedding last weekend doing the cha cha slide, knee turned into the rice krispies and snap, crackled and popped.   But so far I've lost 5lbs, and I'm really trying to push myself. I will say being at a desk job for 4 years prior made me so lazy (Especially getting to work from home), not making excuses, just find it hard to follow through when I don't see results then I get sad and say fuck it and eat junk. Then I think about the dress and the cycle beings again. It's a viscous cycle, but I won't get into self esteem and all that jazz because it's just too big an issue for me. BUT YEAH, back on track, weddings next July."

I will honest to god coach you and message you every damn day if you want this and will work with me. I want you to feel like a goddamn princess on your wedding day.

I'll pm you tomorrow with some communication methods and we will get started.   Start off with a few baby steps: download an app called myfitnesspal, if you have iOS download another app called happy scale. Do you have a tape measure? Take measurements of your thighs, hips, bust, and waist. And lastly, strip down to your skivvies and take pictures of your front, back, side, face smiling, and face not smiling. Hide those away on your computer with a note about what your weight and measurements are, they're just for you. Sometimes it takes seeing those before pictures to see how far you've come. You'll thank yourself later for them."

If anyone refuses to re-phrase their sentence, I shut down the conversation and walk away. Certain family members are learning right quick how to talk to me about the wedding."

My time is worth more than the dollar difference to (attempt to) drive the price back down.  At this point's it's just 'Let's just make a decision, dole out more dollars, and move on.'

Current Dilemmas:  Do you think it would be weird to make the escorts cards small-ish? Because if we make them regular size we have to buy another massive frame thing and find somewhere to put the two of them and I DONT WANT TO. The thing is they have to be like 2x3 and we'd still have to put some families together, ""the Johnson Family""  It's not weird right?   Do we need a guest book attendant? Will people not sign it if we don't have a person? Or if we have lights around it would that be good enough?  Do the head tables get table numbers?  How far from the closest table should the porta potties be?  How the hell will we logistically get from our ceremony to our reception in the same backyard with the same chairs, but add table decor and appetizers?   What about the cake? Who serves the cake? I should probably ask someone to serve the cake.   How much should I be spending on my thank you gifts for the shower and bach party? Would a 60 minute massage (stay at home mom) and $20 to Taco Bell, $20 to Target and $20 to Cold Stone (college student, favorite places) be legit? Or overkill?

Trust us, if you take 15-20 minutes run out of the reception to work with your photographer and videographer during the golden hour, you will be so glad you did!  We also love the generations dances.  We get to give people video of their parents dancing, and their grandparents dancing, and them dancing....often all in the same shot!  How often do you get to have even just a clip of something like that?!  If it is someone working in a cinematic style, they will want the details as well.  Even though you will have photos of them, video (if done correctly!) of these things can be an incredible emotional pull back to the day.    We always want everyone we are filming to be comfortable, because we love candid moments.  The very seemingly small moments like laughing, telling stories while getting ready, your grandparents smiling as they sit, watching people on the dance floor, your first look.  So first, we always meet with our couples at least twice before the wedding.  Once upon booking simply to become acquainted and to get to know them and their story.  We film all over the country, so we often will Skype to do this!  And then once again closer to the day to run over the day, the timeline, and just again, to get more familiar with each other.    When we get their, often during preps, we introduce ourselves and are outgoing to learn names, talk with family, anything to be sure that we make everyone knows that we are friendly and there to help them have a great day.  We also have lenses that allow us to shoot across the room often if we need, so that there isn't the pressure of a camera on you.  If we do need a close shot, we get in and out as quickly as possible.   Also,we shoot on DSLRs, so we have a camera similar to you photographer.  It isn't going to be a big, intimidating camera that makes everything awkward!  Finally, we pop in and out, we don't stay hovering over you while everything is going on.  We get our best footage when everyone is natural and comfortable, so we do what we can to make it that way!"

You are SO keyed up on the day of, and there's a combination of boring logistical distractions (did they remember to tie those bows on the pews??), and happy people around you pulling you in every direction, that I just wound up in a happy fuzzy mental state where crying never happened.    I'd been worried about it because I knew we would all be thinking of my dad and grandmother, who had both died recently, and I expected my mom and I to both be a wreck about it.  But it was fine.  Be prepared with tissues, but don't stress about it."

weddingplanning,3dxylc,MissPippi,8,Mon Jul 20 21:39:11 2015 UTC,"I am a notorious weeper, so it surprised no one when I cried my way down the aisle. I choked up over my vows, my husband choked up over his, our officiant's voice wobbled. Best man, Dad, Mom... I started a chain reaction of happy tears and took everyone down with me. And you know what? It was great. It made our ceremony raw and real. We made our guests laugh and cry and the whole crowd surfed that emotional high for the rest of the reception.   I think a few tears are unavoidable, but I found that the audience and being surrounded by bridesmaids/family/friends kept me from devolving into full-blown ugly crying.  My best advice for calming nerves is to have a solid plan in place, delegate responsibilities to people you trust, and protect your own experience. The APW book has a section about ""finding your wedding zen"" and choosing a moment to transition from ""she who planned"" to ""she who is getting married"". Once you put on your wedding dress, your only job is to get married and enjoy the crap out of your wedding day- nothing else really matters, and a happy couple goes a long way towards an awesome celebration. I was rather aggressive about protecting my own experience of the wedding day. I leaned on my bridesmaids quite a bit and wasn't shy about asking for things that I needed. When things went wrong, I was deliberate about thinking ""this is not my problem"" and choosing to focus on enjoying the day instead. Getting lots of sleep the night before was really helpful too.  Good luck, OP! It will be fantastic, I promise. :)"

Isn't it weird how you can get so lost in the details, you kind of miss the point of the whole day?  Anyway, sorry for the rant! If you're already crying about it, I'm almost certain there's nothing that will be able to stop you the day of. You'll just have to embrace the tears with lots of waterproof mascara :)"

weddingplanning,3dxylc,meghanmapes,4,Mon Jul 20 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"We got married Saturday. I was really nervous about blubbering the whole time. I had the ""first look "" to get some of it out and then by the time the ceremony started i teared up a little but it was fine. We just held hands and looked at each other. I didn't even feel awkward or silly or anything."
weddingplanning,3dxylc,seethella,4,Mon Jul 20 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"So, FH and I just went to pick out tux's... As soon as he walked out of the change room, I was having myself a good ol' Oprah ugly cry. I seriously cry over everything - teen mom - cry, Little People Big World wedding - cry, having a bad day and can't wait to get home to my pizza in the fridge but someone else ate it - cry.   So many people have told me that as soon as you see FH, all of the anxiety, nervousness, etc. will go away. What you're doing now is visualizing how you will react - but in the moment it will be so very different. Heck, if you do cry, embrace it! You're in love, and you're happy and your entitled to cry your little heart out!   If you want to try to keep it together a little bit, do what I do, challenge yourself: look at pictures of FH, listen to sapping wedding music, and try to keep the tears to a minimum (don't judge me)."

weddingplanning,3dxylc,MuppetManiac,3,Mon Jul 20 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"It's totally normal to be anxious!  My advice to you is to practice the ceremony however you can- get FH to stand at the end of a hallway and walk to him, read your vows out loud in the car, or envision the ceremony and let yourself cry.  Hopefully after a few days, you'll have thought about it enough that you'll get less emotional each time.  Even if you don't cry any less, some of the most beautiful wedding pictures I have seen are of the bride and groom crying!  Good luck!"

They help with the nerves, and you can even get all your tears out of the way!   On the other hand, I cried my entire way down the aisle! And I laughed, and everyone cried and laughed with me! I had guests tell me as so as they saw me cry, they lost it. That's what weddings are for!   And a little suggestion for nerves, champaign is always a good start to help calm them!"

I choked up a little bit during my vows (I'd thought I wouldn't be able to get them out), but it really wasn't so bad. My husband is a crier too but we agreed that something about being in front of everyone/the music/the scenery etc. froze us up. This may happen to you too!  Anyways, I think it's nice when people cry during their weddings, it shows the sincerity of their emotion."
weddingplanning,3dxylc,rseahorse14,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"So, I was kind of in your situation on my day.  I set up the music with our string trio to play O Mio Babbino Caro as my wife walked down the aisle with my FIL.  Honestly, I get teary eyed just listening to that song, it's so beautiful.  Anyway, just as my wife made her entrance with her father, my eyes glassed over, I felt the tears coming.  The string trio began their song...  Wrong song.  Tears turned to laughter.  It was supposed to be my surprise recessional song.  My wife gave confused looks but went with it (God, I love her).  Just keep in mind that not everything will go as planned.  Bear with it, and some of your nerdy guests will affirm it was the best ceremony ever because of a special surprise song for everyone, including the ones who planned it :)"

weddingplanning,3dxylc,crackityjones86,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I couldn't control my emotions coming down the aisle when I got married June 27th. It was a mix of happiness, excitement, and a feeling of being overwhelmed by the kindness of all our guests. My ""bride coming down the aisle"" pictures were not that pretty because of it, but it made our wedding even better than it could have been. As soon as we got to the stage where we were married, I calmed down long enough to say my vows without my voice breaking. We did a first look, and I cried at those. I watched sad videos and forced myself not to cry for weeks leading up to the wedding, but I still couldn't control it day-of.  Just relax and have fun, your wedding will be wonderful no matter if you cry or don't!"

weddingplanning,3dymvl,bostonkreamdonut,9,Mon Jul 20 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation. We want to offer our out of town guests a few options for hotels with different price points.  We have a block at the hotel where we're getting married. How are you approaching the other hotels? Are they okay with the fact that you're guests are staying there but you're not hosting the wedding there? I'm new to this and it seems sort of awkward and uncomfortable to me.  Also, how far in advance are you contact the other hotels to reserve room blocks?  Edit: DATE TWINS! I just saw that :D"

There are 2-3 budget hotels nearby, but to be in downtown Portland, its a 30 minute drive to our venue. We decided to offer 3 different hotel options (2 in downtown and 1 budget) - and offer paid shuttles to take our guests from the hotel 30 minutes away to the venue and back.. the shuttle is around $1500 for the night (two shuttles for peak times)... obviously adds to our budget but gives us peace of mind that everyone drinking has an option to get home safely."
weddingplanning,3dymvl,HHH_624,12,Mon Jul 20 17:14:12 2015 UTC,"I would include other hotels on your wedding website.  It's helpful to have hotels in different price ranges, especially since over half of your guests traveling from out of town.  Getting a courtesy room block isn't hard (in my experience!) and doesn't cost anything.  A Practical Wedding has a good post on this: http://apracticalwedding.com/2015/04/hotel-booking-wedding-block/ You could also steer guests to places like airbnb.com    Everyone is traveling from out of town for my wedding.  We're using the hotel right next to our venue as on our main hotel.  But it's kind of small and old-fashioned, so we got a room block at a more modern chain hotel within walking distance in case people want more amenities or want to use their Hilton points or whatever.  We're getting married in an expensive city so I wanted to get room blocks to secure a decent rate for people.  We listed the main hotel info and room block number on an accommodations card and put that in with the invitation.  We listed the other hotel on our wedding website."

weddingplanning,3dymvl,jlynnbizatch,6,Mon Jul 20 19:40:29 2015 UTC,Definitely include other hotel options.  Putting only one could make it feel like you're expecting them to stay there.    There is nothing wrong with formal wear on the subway!  It is the least weird thing on the subway lol.

A lot of guest were also staying there, so we either carpooled or Uber-ed it over to the Ritz.   I had no problem with it, and was grateful that the wedding hosts gave us a list of places near the Ritz to look into that were less expensive. I think people are OK driving to save money and understand that you aren't demanding they stay at the nicer hotel."
weddingplanning,3dymvl,5Skye5,4,Mon Jul 20 17:12:27 2015 UTC,I think it's a great idea to post other hotel options :)

weddingplanning,3dymvl,Sapphire_bride,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"I've totally taken the subway to a wedding in semi-formal wear in NYC. (I wouldn't do it in a bridal gown, but unless you're requiring floor length ballgowns, people definitely take the subway in cocktail dresses). Otherwise they can always get an uber or cab, saving say $200 on hotel will easily pay for a $30 cab ride.  I'm planning to make a small block at our (also upscale, luxury hotel), and then a bigger block at the Courtyard about a 20min drive away."
weddingplanning,3dymvl,midnightjasmine1,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"In my area a lot of hotels will also provide a free shuttle if you do a room block. It's only once to the wedding and once back, but still a great way to accommodate the guests staying in the farther hotel.  Definitely include the information either way, and you should be able to get a room block discount regardless if the wedding is there or not so you can get your guests a discount"
weddingplanning,3dymvl,futuremrsf,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"I work at a luxury resort managing room blocks for weddings and corporate events. My discounted room rates are generally $500 to $775 a night. First of all, make sure that there's not a required number of rooms in your contract for the venue that you're obligated to fill.  Secondly, many of my wedding parties subsidize some or all of their guests' room rates and pay a portion of it to supplement and make it more affordable for their guests. That doesn't sound entirely feasible for your family, so I would recommend that you book a group block at a more affordable hotel nearby. The way you 'wow' everyone is by then booking a bus for the evening to shuttle your guests back and forth. Rent it out for the evening, and have it run in a circuit. Time the loop, and then post on your wedding website that the shuttle will run every X minutes. This saves your guests money on their transportation and allows them to enjoy themselves without worrying about getting around."

Even if the 20 minute commute worked out to be a $40-50 taxi ride, it would still be a better financial deal than the other choices.

I guess I don't have a poker face because the coordinator said, ""well we're typically $5-700/night"". This is our main concern with booking this venue but if we do we're going to block rooms at the Holiday Inn or something around the corner."
weddingplanning,3dymvl,sec408,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:47 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I think it's pretty standard to get a few blocks at differently priced hotels and then you can give your guests the option. (I mentioned Kleinfeld Hotel Blocks on another thread - I'd definitely use them for this as they could get quotes from multiple hotels in the area and give you a nice spreadsheet to compare everything. And it's free!)  It would also be great if you could offer your guests transportation to the other hotels, but if that's not in your budget I think it's totally fine to include taxi/uber/lyft info on the invitation (pro tip: use your uber invite code! Anyone who doesn't already use it gets a free ride and you get a free ride, so it's a win win. I think Lyft might give you free ride codes as well.)  FWIW, a college friend of mine got married in a very swanky hotel, and what a few of us ended up doing was leaving our +1s at home since they wouldn't know anyone else there and splitting the room between four girls so the cost was actually pretty reasonable.  It was great. Point being, you never know what people's preferences will be, so just offer a few options and then let them decide!"
weddingplanning,3dz1jo,safetyinthenumbers,8,Mon Jul 20 18:11:22 2015 UTC,It kind of depends on the context.  Is it way before the wedding?  Are you closing in on the date?    I don't think I've ever received notification that a card was going to be charged.  I'd only think it odd if it was long before the event.
weddingplanning,3dz1jo,SuperiorHedgehog,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"It's usually in the contract when the remainder after deposit will be charged/due.  It one of those things that happens automatically unless you cancel the order usually. It can be the wedding day, the last day to cancel with a refund, or 30 days prior - lots of options are common."

Have you already told people the date?"
weddingplanning,3dzks0,SuperiorHedgehog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't put a deposit on a venue yet but I have been telling people the date. Unfortunately, not a lot of weekends work for us until like February which is really frustrating. My fiance is pretty set on Nov 14th. Alterations would include taking in at the bust, and converting long-sleeves (lace) to three-quarter/at-the-elbow sleeves, and a bustle unless it comes with that already. No hemming likely."
weddingplanning,3dzks0,SuperiorHedgehog,3,Mon Jul 20 20:39:11 2015 UTC,"Hrm, altering lace can be time consuming.  Not sure about the bust.  It almost certainly does not come with a bustle.  I'd speak with the person who would be doing the alterations and get their opinion.  Provide them with a picture of the dress so they can see what they'd be doing.    I can understand how your fiance would feel set on the date.  I can see how it would be disappointing, in his shoes, to have to wait several months because of the dress."
weddingplanning,3dzks0,beverlycrushher,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"I think you need to call them and talk about it. Idk where you ordered it from, but I ordered mine from Brickhouse Bridal in Houston and it came in almost 7 weeks early. It may be possible to put a rush on it now, but also, you can ask if this is concerning to them, etc. Sometimes those emails are autogenerated. They may be able to help you work out a better situation or put your mind at ease.  That said, this is a super tight turnaround, I'm surprised they ordered it."
weddingplanning,3dzks0,beverlycrushher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:40 2015 UTC,I got it from Mia Bridal in Houston. We talked at length about the timing when I ordered it on Saturday. And I just called again and they're confident (aside from an act of God/nature) that the dress will be in Oct 28th. They're also confident in their recommendation for alterations - I tried to call her but no answer.  It's also already on super-rush.
weddingplanning,3dzks0,beverlycrushher,3,Mon Jul 20 20:42:19 2015 UTC,"Were they able to provide you with their plan to rectify things should this not work out? I would call and try to get them to commit to something and just ask for the manager if the girl on the phone gives you a hard time. NO ONE recommends ordering in that tight of a turnaround, so you're not being illogical by wanting to know what happens if there's a hurrican and shipping gets delayed a week.  Edited to add: IF you want to be really intense, I would call Brickhouse (looks like they sahre an owner) and ask what is the latest they would order a dress for your wedding date (tell them you ordered from a local salon and are concerned they underquoted you). If they confirm that this is totally shorter than recommended, I would take that information back and ask to talk to the owner to confirm they can set up a rainplan since her other shop confirmed this wasn't acceptable ordering practice."
weddingplanning,3dzks0,beverlycrushher,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:14 2015 UTC,The girl on the phone kind of gave me the run around which is unfortunate when I asked specifically what my options are if the dress isn't here. I'll speak to a manager.

weddingplanning,3e0ukj,felinemomma,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of these are questions i would ask a planner after I already hired them. Are you looking for questions to ask to find the right planner for you? I recently did that and can help you with that.   A planner's job after that will be to help the formulate your dream and make it a reality, and they will take anything you want and work with it. My planner gives me options that are in my price point for each vendor and I make the ultimate decisions. She handles paperwork and I write the checks. Easy as pie!"
weddingplanning,3e0ukj,preoccupiedwithlove,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"We're pretty much sold on one of them, and this list is a bit more focused on that planner, to be fair. The package is ""all-inclusive"" but not a lot of specifics given, but the company is really highly rated on Yelp and Wedding Spot.  Any suggestions for questions would be great."
weddingplanning,3e0ukj,preoccupiedwithlove,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"In that case, I like your list!   A few more suggestions:  Ask to make sure they'll help you with your theme, if they'll help set up the day of and provide day of coordinator services, if they're hourly or flat fee,  what their availability is during the evening, if they'll be present during vendor meetings, if they'll help you on Pinterest (my planner stalks my Pinterest and pins stuff for me), if they're confident they can work within your budget, hmm anything else... I'll shoot you a message if I think of anything else!"
weddingplanning,3e0ukj,RandomBanana007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:18 2015 UTC,"OH MY LANTA, Why did I not think of Pinterest!? I've been pinning like crazy, too...  Our favorite does have a day-of-coordinator, so that is good."
weddingplanning,3e0ukj,preoccupiedwithlove,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"I would love to know what to ask potential planners if youre willing to share! I am hoping to hire one and, though I have found some I like online, I have no idea how to go about 'interviewing' one."

weddingplanning,3e0ukj,ohcoconuts,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"Bit different, since we're hiring a day-of coordinator, but here are some questions I'll be asking:  Under what circumstances would you come and get one of us?  Tell us a story about a time when... a vendor didn't show up. ...someone was AWOL. ...the reception area wasn't ready on time. ...the food ran out. ...people weren't having fun. ...there was a noisy argument.  How do you do with anxious mothers?  How do you evaluate when people demand to see one of us while we're busy?  What do you do with upset guests?  How precisely do you schedule?  How do you get people to arrive on time when it is against their nature and philosophy?  How do you react to bossy people?  What was your favorite wedding like?  What was your least favorite wedding like?  What was your wedding like?"
weddingplanning,3dyshl,shelbzgt,4,Mon Jul 20 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"This is really going to depend on your area, but my floral quote was priced per centerpiece, and those were $130 per table. I am doing low centerpieces. For 8 tables (assuming 10 at a table + 5 at another table) that would cost $1040, not including any other floral decorations. You might be able to do a cake cheaper, but I think the average is around $400-500. So I think $1500 is a reasonable price (at least it would be for the NY area), but I would shop around and get some quotes from local florists and bakeries and compare."
weddingplanning,3dyshl,AuroraRose41,4,Mon Jul 20 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"For me it came down to what was easier. It was between two venues, one that did tables, chairs, flowers, food, everything. And another that did absolutely nothing. I knew there was no way I could deal with all the vendors. Though we paid a little extra, it was well worth my time and not having the stress of all of it."
weddingplanning,3dyshl,koconne22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on your area and what you're looking for. Is their included package going to be a very simple cake and very minimal flower centerpieces? If yes, maybe it's not a good deal... BUT if you really, really love the venue, you may still want to go for it anyways.   Our venue comes with tables, chairs, and minimal decorations at no extra cost which is totally awesome! Maybe you can find a similar deal. Good luck!"
weddingplanning,3dyshl,princessponyta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"Find out if you do go over the $1500 how much is it after that. Is the price per flower 1.5x higher than somewhere else after this $1500, that could help you decide. Also what is included in the $1500? I found a place that said they provided flowers, by that they meant set bouquets I could not modify with different colors or flowers without an extra cost."
weddingplanning,3dyshl,Chordata1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"You should find out about the quality of the included florist/baker. If it turns out that the bakery has terrible reviews, and their cakes suck, and you have to find another bakery, it's not going to be a good deal. Same if the flower centerpieces aren't your style.    For reference, my cake and centerpieces for a guest count of 130 were 410 and 880 respectively."
weddingplanning,3dybx1,rls13,6,Mon Jul 20 15:10:24 2015 UTC,Is giving them a gift common? I didn't know that was a thing.
weddingplanning,3dybx1,LauraBellz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:26:28 2015 UTC,I know in the south it is. It's a way of saying thank you to them for taking the time/money/energy to throw you a shower.
weddingplanning,3dybx1,LauraBellz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:42 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I'm already giving them all gifts at the rehearsal dinner. I'll think of a little something for the shower.
weddingplanning,3dybx1,speedygirl15,3,Mon Jul 20 15:52:41 2015 UTC,I wrote my FMIL a thank you card. No complaints from her ;)
weddingplanning,3dybx1,mlurve,4,Mon Jul 20 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"Mine was hosted by my mom, FMIL, and two grandmas, so I got them each a ""thank you"" wine glass or martini glass depending on their drink preference. It's totally cheesy but they all LOVE that stuff.  My fiance's brother's girlfriend (woo that's a mouthful) ended up helping out a great deal with some of the creative stuff so I got her a gift certificate to her favorite nail salon. My brother's girlfriend did some help too so I got her a reusable iced coffee cup thing because she is obsessed with Starbucks.  Is it overkill? Maybe, but people were so generous and put so much work into my shower that I wanted to do something nice for everyone involved!"
weddingplanning,3dybx1,ccseren,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like overkill at all! I'm trying to figure out what to get my MOH, her sister, SIL and mother (my second family) for hosting mine."
weddingplanning,3dybx1,rachelleylee,4,Mon Jul 20 16:07:47 2015 UTC,Mine had six hostesses (my mom has a lot of sisters) and I got them all Roots wool socks. I recently moved to Canada and thought it might be a nice gesture from my new city!

weddingplanning,3dybx1,LoveGuacamole,4,Mon Jul 20 18:19:23 2015 UTC,I'm working on figuring that out too! I've budgeted $25/per hostess.
weddingplanning,3dybx1,lilfossie,2,Mon Jul 20 19:32:17 2015 UTC,I figured this might help other brides. It took me months to figure out what to get my bridesmaids for being in the wedding. I hadn't even thought about shower hostesses until this weekend. First shower is in 4 weeks!

weddingplanning,3dyk92,5b3ll,18,Mon Jul 20 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"If he/she has a lot of invitees, for one it would take a long time. 150 guests, for example, at 2 minutes per call = 300 minutes or 5 hours of non-stop calling. And that assumes you get everyone on the first try and have a pretty short conversation.  For two, OP might not have phone numbers for everyone on the invite list (a brief history search that made me feel a little creepy seems to indicate that his/her parents are inviting people that OP calls ""strangers,"" so this isn't far-fetched)."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,schwarzermond,4,Mon Jul 20 18:02:18 2015 UTC,"haha, thank you, that is exactly it. I also don't want people to think I'm bugging them for RSVPs already. We just sent them out last week."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,5b3ll,5,Mon Jul 20 19:18:34 2015 UTC,I definitely understand. I'd probably just contact the people who I really want there to make sure they got their invites...everyone else can figure it out hahah

weddingplanning,3dyk92,SuperiorHedgehog,8,Mon Jul 20 22:30:32 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that they arrived open isn't related to whether they arrive at all.  I wouldn't worry about people failing to receive based on the envelope glue.  Also, if you are still worried, I don't think it would be weird to call and check with folks."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,Prairiegirl4,7,Mon Jul 20 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"Even sort of a general email could be useful if concerned - you could simply say ""just want to ensure everyone received all the inserts from our wedding invitation as a few unfortunately came unsealed in the mail. You should have received 1. Invite 2. RSVP card 3. Any addition info you included"""
weddingplanning,3dyk92,Dried_Apple,4,Mon Jul 20 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"I do know that my cousin's RSVP fell out of her envelope and was sent back to us blank (it was pre-stamped and had our return address, and I know it was not her that did it because she's out of state visiting family this month). So that kinda scares me. I only knew it was hers because I numbered them all. Another pro tip btw, thanks r/weddingplanning!"
weddingplanning,3dyk92,juliaplayspiano,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"Many of my parents' invitees to their wedding never got their invitations because the glue failed and they came apart.  The post office didn't repackage and deliver them.  IIRC, a handful of people got theirs in a bag and that's how my parents found out."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,lroc23,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yup that is what's scaring me! Hopefully I'll get around to talking to almost all my guests at least once before next month. All of the save the dates arrived without incident so I mean, if someone doesn't get an invite by next month, hopefully they will ask me what's up.  We have 125 guests though."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,Enilenif,7,Mon Jul 20 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"Could be something as simple as a different adhesive on the envelopes. I've seen it happen on mass-mailings at work or even just A7 envelopes that have been sitting on a shelf for a while. Sometimes they don't hold super well. Sometimes the mail machines that seal them don't do it well. Plenty of things to go wrong, and sometimes they do -  before USPS tests the limits of what you've secured.  They gave you a partial refund, yes? It sounds like they tried to make this right. Like you mentioned, there isn't really a way for them to help you going forward since people don't usually do wedding invites more than once. (unless you do - TY cards? escort cards? menus?). I'm not sure what else you're hoping to gain from slamming them over the envelopes, but from my perspective, it sounds like they're a responsive and friendly company - willing to fix their mistakes.   If anyone is missing the contents of their invitation, I'd ask WPD to resend. I'm sure they'd resend for free. If any don't arrive intact enough, guests should at least get the outer envelope, which would prompt them to call you for more details."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,ba-poi,5,Mon Jul 20 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"I agree...  It stinks some of the envelopes are arriving opened but I get mail like that all the time, it is what it is.  I think they were more than fair to offer her a partial refund and I don't think this is a situation where she should be telling people to steer clear of this company."
weddingplanning,3dyk92,mbltlh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:52 2015 UTC,Maybe you're right. In the moment I was just super pissed and agitated that we have to go through this. These invites weren't cheap. We were refunded less than 10 percent of the cost.
weddingplanning,3dyk92,meeanne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm hoping, too. Even if we had figured this out before sending, we stamped all of our envelopes before we attempted to seal them, so we would have been out $80+ worth of postage. It's an annoying situation that I hope no one else on here has to deal with. I'm sure it doesn't happen to every WPD customer but my advice is try sealing at least one envelope before you stamp!"
weddingplanning,3dyk92,mbltlh,7,Mon Jul 20 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"I run a printing company and we do everything from wedding invitations to mass mailings for people - this kind of thing CAN happen. It's unusual (and unfortunate that it happened on your invitations!) but not completely uncommon. How did you seal them? That honestly could be user error - too much or too little water will do that. Sealing machinery can affect it. Weather conditions in your area can also affect it. It really could have happened for a number of reasons, but it's not really WPD's fault. Sometimes, a bad batch of envelopes could have even been supplied by their paper company, and they would have had no idea.  It sounds like they tried to make it right by offering you discounts and then a partial refund. That is something that is pretty much out of their control, so that was pretty nice of them to do for you. As a printer, that's the best we could have done for you, too. It seems a little harsh to pull all your business from someone over something like this. You really could run into this anywhere. I mean, unless you want to duct tape your invitations shut - then I'd say they'd be almost guaranteed! lol"
weddingplanning,3dyk92,zakattak,4,Mon Jul 20 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"I ordered everything from WPD and it turned out fine.  To be fair, I also sealed the back of the envelopes with clear round seals.  :x  It solved the return address problem and made sure they were sealed."

weddingplanning,3dvgiy,pretsyl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:40 2015 UTC,They were supposed to be - we literally changed our mind the afternoon before the wedding because we found this lovely grassy area by the sea about a 10 minute walk from our hotel.
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,le_danse_macabre,2,Mon Jul 20 06:47:26 2015 UTC,Most adorable couple! Beautiful pictures!
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,PhoenixRingo,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:54 2015 UTC,"Aww, I absolutely love these! I've really enjoyed reading your posts leading up to the date, and your wedding looks like it was so much fun! Congrats!"
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,PhoenixRingo,2,Mon Jul 20 02:07:44 2015 UTC,My wierdly specific questions is where did you get that petticoat!  Loving that colour!
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,pointtini,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:22 2015 UTC,"I had my heart set on a coloured petticoat until i realised how expensive they were. Instead, I asked my seamstress to just add a colored ribbon to the bottom of the white petticoat already attached to my dress. Same effect, much much cheaper."
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,KoalaBear27,2,Mon Jul 20 06:49:02 2015 UTC,Wow you are so right! I didn't even notice it not being all blue!!! That's so clever and you looked great
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,KoalaBear27,2,Mon Jul 20 07:07:23 2015 UTC,Love your dress. Why did you want to get married in Finland? I hope it wasn't because of the lovely weather...
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,asm1125,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:27 2015 UTC,I was out there last year because one of my best friends is Finnish and thought it was a really beautiful country. Plus it's abroad but a reasonable distance in terms of travel from the UK. The supposedly good weather in July did also factor heavily into the decision though...
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,twice_as_hard,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:48 2015 UTC,You look gorgeous and happy! Congratulations!   Weird question though. Did anybody try talking you into wearing heels/wedges instead of Converse? I want to wear Converse and my friends keep trying to talk me out of it.
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,doublechinsexy,2,Mon Jul 20 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you! One of my mum's friends was horrified at the thought of not wearing heels with a wedding dress, my nana was worried I'd get sweaty feet, and I knew my grampa disapproved but he didn't say anything. Everyone else either didn't care or thought it was cool. I'm glad I went with Converse because I get to rewear them lota and my feet weren't killing me by the end of the night."
weddingplanning,3dvgiy,Youwerewild12,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:17 2015 UTC,See those are all the reasons I want to wear them! Ha. And I can't walk in heels.
weddingplanning,3e0anr,Spaghpeggy,11,Mon Jul 20 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"You have so much time to figure this out!! Don't stress. Your wedding isn't until 2017, your aunt may be an entirely different(and hopefully healthier) person by then!   I would say, don't even really start the guest list till 1 year before the wedding."
weddingplanning,3e0anr,ZeldaSeverous,4,Mon Jul 20 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to worry about this right now. Wait for this situation to unfold on its own in due course & worry about it closer to your wedding. This situation seems to be between your mum, aunt & uncle so let them handle it for now - the solution could present itself to you."
weddingplanning,3e0anr,mutantruby,3,Mon Jul 20 23:47:51 2015 UTC,I agree with the other comments here. Don't worry about the guest list yet. A lot of things can change in those two years so give it another year or at least several months. You can always plan other stuff for the wedding. :)
weddingplanning,3e0anr,hello_kritty,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"I just want to show some solidarity.  My dad's sister is a cluster fuck of mental illnesses, most recently diagnosed is borderline personality disorder. She's been wreaking havoc on our family since she was a teen. A few notable moments:   She claimed that my father molested her and their brother, though my father and their brother deny it. She went to years of counseling for this ""abuse"" She has tried to commit suicide a number of times. Once by strangling herself... Think about that for a second. Her last two suicide attempts both involved her children. She took 3 months one son's medications and locked herself in the bathroom. Her daughter found her. She has told my mom (her brother's wife) that my mom needed to stop having a relationship with my dad to salvage the relationship between my mom and her...    Well, those lovely events aside. In the last year she and her husband have undergone divorce proceedings. She's successfully cut off the entire family. No longer speaking to anyone.   She's fighting tooth and nail, claiming that she is mentally unfit to hold a job (and therefore deserves 75% of my uncle's income) while claiming she's also a fit mother and should have full custody.  ANYWAY. We've invited my almost no longer uncle, the three kids... and uncle's new amazing girlfriend. Even though his relationship to us is through his almost-ex.   Invitations went out in early July. This particular aunt did not get one.  TL;DR: family isn't always about who's related to who"
weddingplanning,3e0anr,TheDukesMistress,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of the advice so far.   I do agree that I have a long time to worry about this, and that I should spend more time planning and not take this too seriously.  I've talked to my mom and my sister about what happened some more. As of right now, I have no intention of inviting my aunt to my wedding unless she cleans up her act. Hopefully things will change for the better in the next months ahead."
weddingplanning,3e0anr,KaylaR2828,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:21 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people are saying not to worry about it or stress out over it. But I know being engaged...family and friends like to question you ALOT about your wedding...even if you haven't started planning. In that case...if someone brings up your aunt and her being there...just redirect ""We're focusing on finding a venue...figuring out our budget..."".  Things may or may not change and this may be the best way to deal with those family members that are ""curious"" about what may happen."
weddingplanning,3e07g2,mm7777,2,Mon Jul 20 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"If the RSVPs are tied to the email, there are two ways about it:   Create groups in Appy couple.  When one RSVPs they have the option to RSVP for the other. (Guests grouped together.) Create RSVPs as couples.  i.e. Mickey and Minnie Mouse   Then again that's how we did it for our guest list since we knew we had to make them pick an entree and add any allergies."
weddingplanning,3e07g2,ba-poi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"thanks for the reply.  we did create everyone individually and then grouped them as couples and families on the guest list.  the problem is people are typing in the names of both people in the couple all at once such as ""judy and jack smith"", which creates a whole new guest and only lets them choose one entree"
weddingplanning,3dye04,Sapphire_bride,7,Mon Jul 20 15:26:08 2015 UTC,"Would it be outrageous to ask a handful of our friends who are not coming to our wedding to put together an in-town casual event?    I think it's rude to ask someone to basically throw you a party. Your past actions of having thrown or contributed to a party for them is not grounds to demand the favor be returned on your terms.  There's nothing wrong with this event, but you should throw it yourself - I'd suggest you do it afterwards as a 'you couldn't make it so come have a cookout with us to celebrate!'"
weddingplanning,3dye04,Aleutienne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"That was my initial reaction as well. Only since friends have been asking for stag info did it occur to either of us that our local tradition is for the bride and groom to designate people in charge of this stuff and we haven't yet. If we were hosting a local event, we wouldn't have RSVPs yet (we are still 4 months out) so we would be choosing our closest friends without knowing who can make it.  We will probably end up asking a mix of those coming and not to put this together so that it's not specific to those not attending. Thanks for your input."
weddingplanning,3dye04,princessponyta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Could you potentially throw a local engagement party and invite all of your friends who initially RSVP'd ""no""?   I don't think I would personally just go to a stagette or pre/post wedding reception, but I would for sure go to an engagement party even if I couldn't make it to the actual wedding."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,HatTrick730,9,Mon Jul 20 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"I'd take a look at public parks.  Your cheapest options will probably be places that aren't billed as official wedding venues, so you may need to think outside the box a little.    For example, our rehearsal dinner party was held at a building owned by the city - nothing fancy, but it had a lovely outdoor patio with views of the ocean."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,SuperiorHedgehog,4,Mon Jul 20 17:02:48 2015 UTC,Seconding this! We're using a public park for ours; it costs about $100 for 2 hours. Can't beat that price!
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,newbieketoer1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:22 2015 UTC,Third this!  My ceremony is being held at a public park $99 for 2 hours. We are splitting chair rental with the couple having their ceremony before ours. The area has beautiful landscape so no decorations are needed. The total cost for our ceremony is under $300.
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,Cholalala,4,Tue Jul 21 18:39:44 2015 UTC,"State and National parks tend to have pretty reasonable event rates, you might want to try calling around those places."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,solinaceae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"This. Im getting married at Red Rock Canyon outside Las Vegas and it is only $210. They only allow 50 people so that cuts down on costs too and I get to blame the venue if people get upset, lol."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,republican4,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:57 2015 UTC,"So I won't be getting married for another year (not even officially engaged yet, but we want to get some major planning taken care of ASAP), and we'll have a pretty smallish budget of $5000. We're having the ceremony in our temple (no fee, no need to decorate) and the reception in my parents' backyard. Cheap as it gets. While it's not the most glamorous, a well landscaped yard could make for a beautiful location. My parents have hosted three weddings in our yard since we've lived there, so I know it's a very workable location."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,lovelywonderland,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:01 2015 UTC,The backyard idea is very workable for us.  The only thing i'm concerned about is the dancing.  When it comes down to it my family boogies with the best of them.  Was this a factor with your reception?
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,finnquinn,5,Mon Jul 20 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"I'm getting married outdoors (at my parents lake home) next month!    While the space is free to use, this takes a LOT of prep work! Yard work, clean up (pre and post) and factoring in all those little details that traditional venues already have, and you've never really thought about - like how many people you're inviting vs. how many toilets you have.  We're renting a dance floor from the same company that we're renting tents, tables, chairs, lighting, catering supplies, and restrooms (this can get very expensive!).  Most rental costs do not include delivery fees, so check with multiple companies.    If you're willing to organize these components and shop around a little bit, I think you'll be able to make it work for less than a standard venue. The park idea above is great - especially if they have a pavilion & restrooms!   Have fun! good luck!"
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,halloguvner,4,Mon Jul 20 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"Good points about the rentals adding up! I'm getting married in my parents' backyard, but with all the rentals, I might as well have reserved a venue. The yard has sentimental value though, and the plus side is that we have complete control and no weird venue rules to deal with."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,AcquaPiovana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"I have no info for how expensive it is, but rented dance floors can be installed on lawns.  My friends had a verrrry stripped down wedding in a family member's back yard, but they still got a tent and a dance floor. That was pretty much it. They didn't even have proper food (something I don't recommend, as we were complete blindsided by that fact).  They hooked an iPod up to some speakers and that was that."
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,princessponyta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who isn't officially engaged yet, but still beginning to plan. :) I think your plans sound intimate and awesome!"
weddingplanning,3dyqm7,mellamosarah,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:34 2015 UTC,My outdoor venue is a non-profit camp for youth which also allows weddings. It's so much cheaper than other venues near us and has a beautiful old lodge we can use for the reception/rain location.
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,marrymebill,5,Mon Jul 20 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"Your best bet would be to just call and talk to the photographer.  Say you're never done anything like this before so you don't know what to expect.  If they are straightforward with you, you've got a good one.  If they're vague, or seem like they're hiding something, I'd leave."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,IroncladPen,4,Mon Jul 20 21:59:16 2015 UTC,"I do 35 photos for $500+tax, and have given 3 ""no strings attached"" engagement sessions this year. I do offer our services, but I'm not expecting any return on these other than some good will."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,bn1979,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:57 2015 UTC,"My biggest question is only 10 digital photos? Does that mean you have to pay for the rest? My photographer for the day of threw in my engagement session for free and included ALL of my photos digitally. Sounds like they're baiting you with a ""free session"" and going to hook you by having to pay for your files."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,grandslamwich,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And is it 10 photos for free? Or 10 poses? If it's 10 photos, it's a really crummy deal and not worth your time. Either way, be ready to love the other photos they show you and that you have to pay up for them."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,EverBe,4,Mon Jul 20 22:20:59 2015 UTC,Really? 10 photos for FREE is a crummy deal? Some photographers charge hundreds to thousands of dollars for 10 photos. Some charge hundreds of dollars to just take the photos and more to buy them. What if this photographer is really great?
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,upabovethesea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"10 photos can be the same pose with 10 variations of them. 10 poses would be 10 completely different photos standing/sitting/hugging/etc.  And if the photographer was really great, they wouldn't use this type of tactic to get clientèle."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,EverBe,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"Did you enter a draw? When I did a wedding fair, I had a draw for a free engagement session. Totally legit.   You can ask how the 10 photo thing works. Ask if they're going to let you choose the photos from a gallery or if other photos will be available for purchase.  I've been doing mini sessions with couples lately with 10-15 photos included, of my choosing. But I usually give them 15-30 photos and delete the rest. I'm not trying to up sell them after. But some photographers might be. And there's no reason you shouldn't take the 10 photos and leave, even if that's the case. That's not a bad deal if you like the photographer's work a lot. Everyone is about quantity these days, but 10 awesome photos are worth more to me than 100 mediocre ones."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,upabovethesea,2,Tue Jul 21 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, I'd be stoked to have 10 great photos and an opportunity to work with a potential photographer. I will have to ask if we get our choice of the 10 or not...thanks!  Oh, and I did enter a draw FYI."
weddingplanning,3dzx2t,baby_mongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"My mom is a photographer and works a lot of expos. She does something like this.  She only contacts people who filled out her forms for a drawing (free session and an 8 x 10). Then she will call everyone and tell them they won the drawing.   It's a way to bring people in to her studio in hopes to generate more clients. Some end up just taking the free stuff, and some end up really loving it and buying more.  I think she's just hoping that you will fall in love with her photos and decide to hire her as your photographer - kind of like sampling your food or wedding cake - a test drive.  I would still talk with her and see what the exact constituents are before you commit :)"
weddingplanning,3dvpla,Rocknotaflower,14,Sun Jul 19 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"This might be long and a bit venty....So, today was my birthday and my fiancé had to work so I thought, why not have an awesome dress shopping day with my bridesmaids and mom just to see what I like! My mom said she ""didn't feel well"" after she was a half hour late to meet us at my house before the appointment and she decided not to come.   So we all went, had an awesome time and I found my dress! It was about the fourth I tried on, and all Casablanca samples were half off, and it fit me pretty well! I wasn't planning on buying today since the wedding isn't until June, but it just seemed to work out! So I got my dress for half off, and had a great day, but my mom wasn't there. We don't have a super close relationship anymore because she always plays the victim and guilts us. She texted my aunt who was with us at the store and said she hoped I didn't find a dress today so she could've been with me the next time we went shopping.   Is it crazy of my to be really upset that she is acting selfish? I can't believe I can be so happy and upset at the same time. I just wish she would have come so we could all enjoy together. I don't know what the point of this is, besides to just vent I guess! Thanks if anyone is listening!"

I had made plans with my mom for her to come and go dress shopping with me and when I called her to see if she was still coming, we re-scheduled because she ""couldn't make it."" The weekend we re-scheduled to happened to be a big sale at one of the bridal shops in my area. At this point in time she was not working as she took time off to oversee the re-do of our kitchen. Nothing was happening on weekends though, and the kitchen was being finished the following week.  I called her about a week before to see if she was still coming and she told me no, that shoe couldn't do it that weekend. It's a 5 hour drive, however, my mom also flies for free as my dad works for an airline. I was incredibly upset, but after talking to my dad and sister, realized that it was her fault. You are right in thinking that she is/was being really selfish. She has no right in the future to be upset that she wasn't there as you afforded her the opportunity and she decided not to take it."

I went anyways with my FMIL, future niece/bridesmaid, and another bridesmaid and ended up finding my dress. I haven't told her I've found it. I've attempted to make plans with her so I can ""accidentally"" find it almost right away, but she always comes up with excuses. It's her loss. She has some issues that aren't mine to try to fix.

To the OP, there are definite benefits to planning on your own.  Even the sweetest, most helpful friends and family complicate logistics and decision making.  One bride acting alone can book an appointment with a cake vendor, settle on a design, and order the cake.  A bride with friends and family nearby might go through just as much stress and time just trying to wrangle her people for an initial meeting with the cake vendor, and then has to balance all of the input she's getting from her helpers.    You might pick out the most intimidating things - maybe dress buying, maybe flowers, and make plans to handle those things while people are visiting. My sister was mostly planning her wedding on her own, but I was able to help her out with the flowers - we had an appointment to talk to the florist on Christmas Eve while I was visiting for the holiday.    Vendors will take you seriously as soon as you put down your deposits, and if they have any sense, they'll be polite throughout."

Plus the fact that I look very young, I'm pretty sure all the vendors think I'm pretending or something.

weddingplanning,3dwalj,ellieellieoxenfree,4,Mon Jul 20 02:25:19 2015 UTC,"OMGosh I hope that the visa works out for you! That's exactly what I mean, the pretending. I feel like making a shirt or something that says ""I swear my fiancé exists!"""

I can't wait until we find out because then we can actually do something!  Can you make me one, too? I also need one that says, ""No, I'm not 12. Seriously. I'm legal. Yes, really."""
weddingplanning,3dwalj,cupcakewedding,4,Mon Jul 20 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"Have you considered hiring a planner? They go to all the meetings with you and if you find the right one, it could feel as if you're with a best friend for the planning process."

I do feel like some people think that we won't make it to the wedding, that we're a break up waiting to happen simply because they can't imagine getting through long distance unscathed.  It's pretty sick how many people seem to think cheating is inevitable when your SO is ""out of the way"" so to speak.  It's nice to have the wedding to focus on while we're apart though!"
weddingplanning,3dwalj,MamaXerxes,3,Mon Jul 20 04:48:05 2015 UTC,"I feel you! We were apart for almost a year, people definitely were skeptical about us making it work. The best rub in the face is making it through and proving that you are the only one for each other. Stay strong!"
weddingplanning,3dwalj,emmabeeze,3,Mon Jul 20 06:23:35 2015 UTC,"You got this!! My DH works three month rotations on a ship, so for half the year before getting married it was just me doing wedding tasks. I went to see the venue we ended up booking by myself - I was walking around taking photos and giving him details via text, and he was replying ""book it! Give them money!"" because he loved it so much haha. One of my bridesmaids lives overseas, so she was my ""go-to"" for advice - it made her feel more helpful, she said, since she obviously couldn't come for other things. And my other two BMs were doing a masters and first year law, so we were all relying quite heavily on texting/emails to stay up to date. Make sure you do utilize them in anyway you can, though. I did all our DIY by myself, but always got input from them along the way and ran ideas by them, and it was so helpful.    Like another commenter said - feel free to use all of the people in this community for support, too :)"

Plus if I make a mistake or something goes wrong, I know exactly what happened and how to fix it.   When I nailed down who was coming to town when, I made little game plans of things for them to do - tasks I knew I could delegate and not worry about.   There is something to be said for the great amount of control you have when you do it yourself."

weddingplanning,3dzc3b,Roseredgal,3,Mon Jul 20 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"Here's a couple from a pro photographer.    Ask to view full wedding albums, and don't let them dance around the subject. People steal photos or do ""photo workshops"" to build their portfolio. You want to verify that they actually have shot weddings, and judge them on their ""average"" photos, because that's what you will get.  You want to know what they deliver, not just what their best shots look like. Look for consistency more than anything else. A white dress should be white, regardless of whether the shots were inside or outside. Look for distracting things in the photos.  Ask how many photos you can expect, particularly with an hourly photographer. Who cares how long they shoot for, you want to know what they are going to deliver.  Ask about the flow of their typical wedding, then break it down into the ways it relates to your plan.  Be sure to ask about releases for printing, any additional charges, etc.  FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR TURNAROUND TIME. We guarantee <60 days for complete delivery per contract. I've heard of people waiting 6-7 months for their photos. This is just ridiculous. A dirty little secret for you - the better the photos are as shot, the less time the editing. On a good shoot, we have turned 600 photo weddings in 3 days.  Ask about posing. If someone says, ""I normally don't pose because (excuse)"", It generally means they don't know how to pose couples. Posing is an important skill for a photographer, because it is how you ensure everyone looks their best. Different body types and facial structures call for different angles and poses.  Ask if they are comfortable shooting outdoors after dark, and if they have additional lighting. There are some really awesome ""natural light"" photographers, but they are few and far between - and expensive. For the most part, ""natural light"" equals amateur.    Hopefully this gets you started. I'm sure I could give you a few more, but I'm a little distracted at the moment."

weddingplanning,3dzc3b,bn1979,2,Tue Jul 21 08:54:29 2015 UTC,No problem!  Hope this can help you choose a good photographer.
weddingplanning,3dzc3b,holly_caust,2,Tue Jul 21 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"How many produced photos can you expect per hour of shooting?

I have no idea if that is high or low."

weddingplanning,3dzc3b,holly_caust,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:26 2015 UTC,Interesting. I have no idea if 200 photos for 10 hours is a good deal. It sounds like plenty but who knows!
weddingplanning,3dzc3b,bn1979,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"IMO, 200 images doesn't really provide adequate coverage of a long event, particularly if you want a lot of formal shots.   We really only offer the 200 photo package because it allows us to have a very basic package at a low ($2300) price point for couples that really want our work, but can't stretch to our higher priced packages."

An invitation is not an obligation. She could have any number of reasons for not wanting to attend. Maybe she couldn't afford a gift and didn't want to admit it. Maybe she just doesn't like showers. There are many other possible reasons, and none of them are any of your business. I understand you're dissapointed that your friend didn't come to the shower you hosted, but in the grand scheme of things, this is not a big deal. Take a few deep breaths and move on."

If you're not going to the shower, you definitely don't need to get her anymore gifts, but do bring a card to the wedding (you don't need to put money in the card).

There really is no polite way to say, ""if you get me something I don't want, I'll just sell it or throw it out."" Can you imagine saying that at a family Christmas? ""What's this, nephew Billy? A little man made of pipe cleaners? What am I supposed to do with this shit? It'll just take up space I don't have! Oh, don't bother crying, Billy,  I've had an Amazon wishlist set up for months. Months. Out on the curb it goes!""  Of course you wouldn't do that, and weddings really aren't that radically different from any other gift-giving occasion. The same etiquette applies here; you take whatever you get, you smile, you say you love it, you write a thank you note. Whether you keep the gifts afterward is your business.  I will say that you aren't obligated to fill a registry with housewares that you don't want, but really, that would make it all that much easier to return them for cash."

We went 'No, no, no, we're fine,' when people asked to give us non-wedding help and presents (outside of holidays).  I didn't even make a registry if they hadn't been able to communicate that they wanted one so badly (I didn't want one and for the first year said I had none because I didn't want presents).   I'd feel differently if the registry was entirely my idea and I said 'Eh, surprise me, I love presents, it's just like Christmas, isn't it?'."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,sappers_girl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"Although, I'm sure it depends on the store, but even with gift receipts we only got store credit for shower gifts that we returned. So that might also not be a solution OP is keen on. (Unless it's a huge store with a variety of items that they could purchase with their new store credit)."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,Mmsm101,9,Tue Jul 21 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"Don't usually when you buy on registries you can return it? Also just pick household stuff that you would want, even like you said you don't want it. Even if it looks expensive or outrageous it might make the things you already have that you originally wanted seem more practical."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,le_danse_macabre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:28:26 2015 UTC,"There was no household stuff I wanted, save for some SUPER cheap dish towels (getting the complaint that they were too cheap), and ice cream scoops ('getting the complain that they were 'too fun').  The stuff we could really use? A new cat carrier ('we ain't getting you cat stuff'), high quality seeds ('No farm stuff!), and a clock ('That's too fancy!  No fun stuff).  We live in tiny spaces, use very few things, love games and pets and farming, and we've always been our happiest that way.  It's no secret and we've lived that way together for 12 years.   It feels really weird that we got complaints as a reacting to 'your presence is the best gift we could receive'."

Fuck 'em. Haranguing you about your registry items not being good enough or not being to their tastes is incredibly rude. I would ignore all feedback if at all possible, and otherwise address it nicely but firmly with, ""Thank you for wanting to get us a gift! We've set up a registry with items we'd really love, but anything you choose to get us will be so appreciated!"" or however you'd phrase that in your own words, and then follow the above advice of getting rid of it discreetly after the wedding.  I never knew until weddit that asking for the ""wrong kinds"" of items on a registry was a thing. We're putting some household items on ours, but also power tools, and a DVD set of the entire Seinfeld series, and other things we haven't thought of yet. If it offends anyone that they might get us something that isn't related to making food or beds, I repeat: fuck 'em."

weddingplanning,3dx10l,11Petrichor,8,Tue Jul 21 15:28:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say those things at all.  I would register at a place where you can buy things you DO like (i.e. return the gifts, and use the money towards something else) and just graciously accept whatever they give you.  It feels wrong to basically say 'whatever you have that you want to give us, we are not going to want.'    You have no obligation to make a registry that they like, but it's probably in  your interest to do what you can to make sure the gifts are returnable, so it may be worth registering for kitchen wares and such so that you know you can take them back and exchange for something better."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,SuperiorHedgehog,2,Mon Jul 20 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yup - register at Target, you can return housewares you don't want for store credit and buy games, groceries, booze, whatever."

weddingplanning,3dx10l,11Petrichor,10,Mon Jul 20 14:19:40 2015 UTC,"It comes down to you can't control other people. You could register for 10000 items and people might just buy whatever the hell they feel like getting you. You accept them with grace and tact, and whatever you do after is your business."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,11Petrichor,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"If I got people to just buy whatever the hell they felt like after they sat down and listened for a few seconds, that'd be WAY better than registering at all.  Sure, I'd like them to be happy, but I also don't want to go to my own wedding knowing most of them are upset they weren't asked to spend large amounts of money on me or shower me with frivolities."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,11Petrichor,4,Mon Jul 20 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"Well, if you don't register for them, you run the risk of people buying them anyway, and then you might be stuck being unable to return them.  If you register for them, you know you can return, and all the return credit will be pooled in one place.  If they're buying things outside of the registry, then there's nothing you can do to make sure they're returnable.  Honestly I think everyone gets some wedding gifts that make them scratch their heads.  They are still gifts, and the givers mean well; you just have to smile and say thank you and be gracious."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,lroc23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"Its a lot more the attitude bout the gifts that bothers me.  It's starting to sound a lot less like 'I know you didn't ask for it, but I think you'll like it' and more 'You'll take this pony and buy it a stable and saddle and groom it and feed it because I say so!'  Just ask.  Or buy something off registry.  Or don't insist on a registry and buy anything.  Or don't buy anything, show up and have fun (this is what I asked for anyway)."
weddingplanning,3dx10l,11Petrichor,7,Mon Jul 20 15:33:14 2015 UTC,"I think it is perfectly acceptable to continue repeating the mantra ""Please no gifts, we haven't got room"" as much as you like. And when people give you shit about it, you politely smile and say ""I do hope you won't get us anything at all, we really do not have the space for anything."" And if they still give you shit about it you disengage and you turn around and donate whatever household things they give you to goodwill and you feel great about it because you told them twice!  I don't think there is any need to tell them that you are going to donate their gifts. Just do it.  You don't NEED to FEEL grateful just because they gave you a gift. It is perfectly fine to feel annoyed. Just ACT grateful and turn around and push it out the door."

Registries don't guarantee you'll get that specific stuff, just give people an idea of what to get you. My registry includes two giant Nerf guns, 6 bags of candy, and some other really fun/silly shit. That's who I am. That's who my groom is. If family doesn't get that by now they never will, and if they get us ""shitty"" gifts we don't want, we will gracefully thank them, and either return, resell, or donate shit we don't want.   You definitely don't say ""Get me the shit I want or don't bother."" because that's rude and makes you sound super spoiled."

We insisted and asked and pushed people into asking about gifts (so we could get them to back down, but didn't mentioned that part) for two years.  This isn't Christmas, it's a wedding.  You're supposed to show up and have fun, gifts aren't even necessary, but you know they can be a burden just taking them home."

You definitely need to go to the Blue Lagoon, a thermal hot springs near Reykjavik.  It's amazing!  Don't worry about the cold (it was -6 Celsius, or about 20 farenheit when I was there), you'll warm up as soon as you get in.  It's a beautiful location and so relaxing. Www.bluelagoon.com"
weddingplanning,3dwfoc,caitsey,2,Mon Jul 20 04:51:57 2015 UTC,I opened the thread to comment the same thing.  Iceland is an amazing country. The Blue Lagoon is definitely a highlight. You could spend hours there relaxing in the warm waters.
weddingplanning,3dwfoc,brokenxsmile,2,Mon Jul 20 06:35:31 2015 UTC,"I went there in April this year. It was very, very beautiful!! Keep a lookout for Icelandic air website - they often have packages and deals. Just some things of note - Iceland is very, very expensive. An average beer costs $14CAD. Meals will cost between $20-70CAD/person, even for a burger. It's windy and that generally makes it feel much colder than it is.   However, the hot springs are AMAZING. Blue lagoon is one of my favourite places in the world (though, I'm a bit biased because I love hotsprings.) But there are thermic pools in pretty much every town. There is lots of history and Reykjavik is very charming."

I would highly suggest visiting Iceland!"

We were going to do wow air (a discount airliner in iceland) but with their bag fees, inconvenient arrival times, and having to book separately to get to Boston or DC it seemed worth it to us to pay a little extra for Iceland air.   We are on somewhat of a budget but are determined to make it work so we are booking mostly with airbnb, renting a car, planning on doing some meals out and some from grocery stores, and lots of (Free!) hiking.

weddingplanning,3dwh2g,Cyradis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"I looked into doing this and didn't because the cost of catering and furniture rental was going to be too expensive. They have a list of vendors you have to choose from and none of the caterers would have been under $100/person and I couldn't afford that. So keep that in mind with your budget. The rental fees are low but you have to rent all of the chairs and tables too, so it adds up. It was like $4+ per chair plus a crazy high ($400 or something?) delivery fee."

It was absolutely top of my list for venues, but only seats something like 40 under the pavilion itself, which wasn't big enough for us.  Similar to /u/inquisicat, I checked into some of the logistics early on and the little things add up. Table/chair rental plus something about a tent made ""cute, easy reception"" into a headache. The caterers are pricier, but they have some good ones on there (Calihan is GREAT!!). I believe they required security too by person hours per people.  If you're doing something small (<50 people), the costs are probably still in your favor. If it's bigger, the little costs and restriction on vendors start to outweigh the savings from having a lower venue cost."

You already said they don't want the whole month, so no risks of conflicts.  Next time you or she call, in your conversations bring up your wedding and say ""we're excited! We picked a date, it's :this date:"" and have the rest of your conversation. It's not like it requires their permission or they have veto power."
weddingplanning,3dvibo,ilysespieces,11,Sun Jul 19 21:53:35 2015 UTC,"Agree. I say book the date, and next time you chat with her/them, let them know the date. Personally, if I were in your SIL's shoes, having it not be made a big deal would be ideal. I think if someone were to make it a big conversation it would make me feel crummy, because it would highlight the fertility issues. If you just let it naturally come up in conversation though it's a separate event with happy connotations."
weddingplanning,3dvibo,Prairiegirl4,4,Sun Jul 19 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"I really think you could check with her. It could be done very easily with a call to see how she is feeling and short conversation.

I believe you had said you didn't want anything in that month, so would that be okay with you guys?"" Chances are she'll be totally cool with it and if she's not, you will avoid adding hurt feelings to what must be an already emotional time for her."

It sounds like you don't really know her planning status and they may have moved forward with setting up a date/venue that you may not know about. My FH and I ran into this with my future SIL, who is younger and not engaged. We were getting a lot of road blocks from the family and decided to move ahead without keeping everyone in the loop to divert unwanted opinions.  We decided our date and just a few days later the future SIL announced her date - the same weekend. We were livid and felt that it was not curtious to consult with us b/c we were older and engaged first (again they were not engaged so we were really thrown off).

Personally, if I was that third bridesmaid I'd be mildly offended that everyone but me ended up with a cool title.!  What I would suggest, if she doesn't think Maid of Honor/Bridesmaid isn't sufficient for her party, is her to rename her side-  the MOH gets a new title, and the bridesmaids get retitled into something else as well.  It'd still be even, fair, but wouldn't require your side to be retitled as well."

That's something else you might want to mention to her - she choose them to be her bridal party, which is an honor and blessing on it's own.  They don't need shiny unique titles to feel loved and cherished - her choosing them shows they are on it's own. :)"
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,hannchen,6,Mon Jul 20 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"This is why are just having two bridesmaids and two groomsmen. No way in hell was I gonna pick between them. I'd suggest no formal titles for anyone. You really only need them with a huge party where someone needs to be ""in charge."""
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,snickerdoodleglee,2,Mon Jul 20 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'm actually a bit nervous about this; I originally had a MOH and 3 bridesmaids, but it's looking like 2 of the bridesmaids will be dropping out (not for friendship-ending reasons, and while I'm disappointed neither of them will likely be there, I understand it) so now I may have 1 MOH and 1 BM. I almost wish I hadn't asked one of the girls to be MOH considering the size of the party now, but I had no way of knowing until now."
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,hannchen,2,Mon Jul 20 09:10:18 2015 UTC,I think your friends will understand in that case. After all you could not have foreseen that. I'm sorry you lost half your party!
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,krys1128,5,Mon Jul 20 12:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I'm just lumping everyone in as ""Bride's Attendants"" or ""Groom's Attendants."" I do have my sister as MOH technically, but that will become apparent when she gives the speech at dinner."
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,TheDukesMistress,3,Mon Jul 20 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I couldn't decide who I wanted as my #1 (cousin/bestie forever, lives far away and sister in law, lives in the same area see each other all the time).   One is married and one is not, so I'll be having a maid of honor, matron of honor, and bridesmaid.   I have heard, many times, on this sub the idea of ""co-Maid of honors"". Honestly, I think my girls have liked splitting that burden with each other.   The biggest issue (for me at least) was picking who stands where at the ceremony/who's name comes first on the programs. It's not a huge problem, though. Just something to be aware of."
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,TheDukesMistress,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"OK, great!  It sounds like you were in the exact same boat she finds herself in now.    Did your husband label his side of the party to match yours' (like a two best men kind of thing)?  That's a crucial question for us.  I sincerely believe her side could have two ""positions of honor,"" while my side has one without looking silly!"
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,socialsecurityguard,5,Mon Jul 20 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"Nope. He's got one best man.   So, it's my cousin/bestie, my brothers wife, and his brothers wife. Maid of honor, matron of honor, and bridesmaid. And then his brother, my brother, and his bff. Best man, and two groomsmen."
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,margaret3lizabeth,3,Mon Jul 20 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"I don't like the sounds of any of her special titles. And the third gets the lame name. And if she has two maids of honor and one bridesmaid, that one will feel unimportant. One maid of honor or none. My sister had a page of her bulletin dedicated to her attendants and why they were special to her."
weddingplanning,3dw0r9,margaret3lizabeth,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:29 2015 UTC,"By chance is one friend married and the other not? It could be maid of honor, matron of honor, and bridesmaid.

She said she wanted her to be in the wedding party because they are going to be sisters for the rest of their lives!  ...I was a bit teary-eyed about that :)"
weddingplanning,3dwoy1,RingAroundTheRose,12,Mon Jul 20 04:00:52 2015 UTC,"Try writing something short and sweet along the lines of ""I vow to honor the life we have built together and to continue to choose you and us every day."""
weddingplanning,3dwoy1,adrun,4,Mon Jul 20 11:02:10 2015 UTC,"If you re-read the traditional vows, you will find that they are not about promising to do things that you don't already do. Rather, they are about promising to continue to do what you do even if bad things happen to you. Here they are, for reference: ""I, ____, take you ___, as my husband/wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,  until death do us part."" So in other words,  it's a fancy way of saying ""no take backsies."" Some people like to write their own humourous versions of the no take backsies clause, such as ""no matter how loud he snores at night."" Feel free to have fun with it."
weddingplanning,3dwoy1,bismuth92,2,Mon Jul 20 10:34:27 2015 UTC,"So traditionally there are two parts, though some people only incorporate one: the affirmation ""I do"" is you stating your intentions to the community, and the vows are virtually the same words, but spoken and promised directly to each other ""I so-and-so take you, so-and-so."" It sounds like the two of you have already lived out your vows to each other, but the wedding is an opportunity to make those things public, so your family and friends can be witnesses. I'm not sure if that reframing is helpful (it is for me), but I hope you find something that feels genuine to you!"
weddingplanning,3dwoy1,krys1128,2,Mon Jul 20 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"People may disagree, but I'd say incorporate part of what you said into them...  ""I don't need to promise him I will because I already do.""  Sounds good to me, and authentic!"

There was a set that were super realistic and I found hilariously appropriate to our lives with things along the lines of ""I will only clean the bathroom before your mother comes over so she doesn't think I'm a slob"". So we took those and customized them to our lives. I'm promising never to intentionally overdraft the checking account, unless I will DIE without those shoes. He's promising top use turn signals as arbitrarily as he wants, even if we are in an empty parking lot at 4am.   Our vows are far from romantic or mushy, they are fun and lighted hearted and silly.

weddingplanning,3dwe03,Distanceplanning,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:18:47 2015 UTC,"In general a budget is your first guesstimate x 1.5 or 2 even with good intentions. Get a checklist and see how much you can set aside for each category.   Rings alone, even going the Etsy way and making them plain solid gold bands, will set you back 200-500. Consider alternative metals as well.  You can get a cheap dress, but often the costs come from alterations (almost always needed depending on style) customisation (adding corset backs, modifying waists) and accessories: shoes, special bras, crinolines, veil, jewelry, belts. If you do go for a cheap dress make sure you absolutely love it. If you don't you will just shift the costs on accessories to pretty it up. My advice - do NOT order online. Yes it can save a lot but what it looks like in real life and what it looks like on you can and often makes it into a dress you wouldn't have necessarily have bought in a shop if you saw it in person.   There are a LOT of small things that add up: invitations, envelopes, thank you cards and envelopes, postage, name cards, menus, guest favors, flower buttoniere, guest book, seating plan, church leaflets, confetti alternatives (sometimes not allowed), candles, candle holders, table decorations.  You don't need all, and you don't need to hire someone to do it but DIY is also not necessarily cheaper. Ink, special artist pens, special paper, extra paper for mistakes. It adds up. Or the end result can look sort of awkward and imperfect. For example my flowers cost a lot, but then again they completely eliminated the need for any table decoration, any location decoration, church decoration,   You can DIY hair and makeup. If you have no particular skin or hair issues that require a pro hand to conceal/deal with a simple do, or loose curls and a subdued look with photography friendly materials will look amazing. But if you don't know how to do these things, be prepared to practice a lot and buy and return or accept a loss on between 50-300 bucks.   Consider guest entertainment. Music can be as simple as an ipod and rental sound system but the guests need some activities to do apart from eating.  If you are setting aside 3000$ for everything apart from venue and food be prepared to have a big challenge. It's not undoable, just that you will swap money value for hundreds of hours of research and DIY and limitations in what you can get. Do use Pinterest for inspiration but realize that those boho, chill weddings are actually extremely expensive 20000-50000 wedding merely using a lot of quality artizan stuff and a modern look.   If you are renting a place for the weekend prepare for paying for any needed consumables that would be supplied in a hotel setting, if not provided - from toilet paper to soap and towels.  Are you covered on cutlery, table sets, glassware etc? Those things are quite expensive  Mountain setting is gorgeous, but do you have a rainy day plan? Mountain weather is unpredictable.  Be prepared for many guests not to stay especially if it's casual. You can ask the guests that stay to contribute but this could be controversial depending on age and crowd. I personally would find it totally fine. My mother would consider it shifting tour costs onto your guests.   If I would splurge on one thing it would be the photographer. A photographer will at the minimum capture all the moments you will be too stressed to register. If your friend does it make it clear both for you and for them they are more like working that day. You cannot both be a guest enjoying the show and the photographer. If you do both you will not catch important moments or beautiful candid moments. If you do 't want to make your friend do 8 hours of work on your wedding day consider an alternative."

If it's just travel to get there, and the $30 covers all lodging and food, that'd be fine. Or if they have to just buy food for days nothing is planned.   I think it's a great deal.   Do you have a registry? That'd be the only possible sticking point but I don't personally think there is a conflict there."
weddingplanning,3dwe03,k9centipede,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:51:06 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thank you both so much for your replies! So much to think about! To answer some questions- We do have a rainy day plan- tents already owned by family members. The venue is also very large- with 12 cabins, two of which are very large and have huge common areas. As for decorations we are keeping very simple. Think paper flowers (provided by aunt) and lights (pre-owned). The venue is very rustic but pretty. My FH has ties to the restaurant industry so we will be getting all rentals (flatware/glass/silverware) and bulk food at cost. Although I am not opposed to the idea of paper plates- possibly tacky but much more suitable for the venue.  We already have rings. So this cost will not be factored in.  We will be having our clothes custom made before we leave Asia. We have been quoted about $300 for both my dress (non-traditional) and his suit.  We have many friends traveling from 2-4 hour away- all whom enjoy camping,fires, and booze so I think the number of people staying will be quite high. We only have a few people over 30 attending (Neither of us have many older family members)  Yes, the $30 dollars would be the only cost. We would supply food, booze, and lodging for the whole weekend for those staying. The venue supplies toiletries and bedding."

I am sorry your family and you are going through this.  Hopefully he will improve on the new medication, and will be able to function even better then before."
weddingplanning,3duxot,BadLuckNovelist,15,Sun Jul 19 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"That is an awful situation. I am so sorry to hear that.

Considering how your brother's condition has (understandably) taken a front seat to everything, I think it's a good sign that your parents at least don't want to miss your ceremony if they can help it.  It's a tough situation and I wish your family the best."
weddingplanning,3duxot,k9centipede,4,Mon Jul 20 17:46:55 2015 UTC,Would having someone Skype yhe ceremony and reception to the hospital would that make things a hit easier?

weddingplanning,3duxot,zreneep,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine being in this situation, especially the stress of worrying about your brother and his health. Please try to remember despite all the stress that this is just one day. And while this one day is an amazing, happy, huge day for you it is a scary, unfamiliar, lonely day for your brother who is in a scary place with people he doesn't know being poked and prodded.  You say your family and friends are all in town for your wedding -- that's great! Focus on that! Your family is going to be your family for the rest of your life, regardless of where they spend your big day. If I were you, I would tell your parents that while you would love for them to come, you do not want to pressure them and understand completely if they need to stay with your brother.   Because again, this is a big day for him too and not in a good way. Being in a hospital, taking medications with bad side effects, and having seizures are scary for an able-bodied person, let alone someone with reduced cognition. Take lots of pictures and video for your family, maybe even skype in with them during the reception so they can give a toast from afar.   And go ahead and be excited! Knowing your brother has your parent(s) with him should give you and them both some peace of mind. Have fun, celebrate, focus on the positives, and be happy as ever but remember that weddings are only one day, marriage and family are what really matters."

It was developed inColorado to help a little girl who had horrible epilepsy but obviously couldn't just smoke pot since marijuana itself is t good for children's development.  I am so sorry your family is going through this but try to just take each day one day at a time. Know that your family is there for you and wants to support you as best as they can.

Weddings are just ceremony and celebration of commitment, right? I feel like there's no reason you can't do that more than once. Lots of people have multiple ceremonies to a compare different cultural or religious traditions. I don't think one diminishes the significance or emotional impact of the other, because they happen in different contexts.   Ok, so, if it's possible, what about you and FH going to the hospital the morning of your wedding (or the night before) and having a small ceremony there for just your immediate family? It could be your legal ceremony (in which case you'd need to figure some shit out with paper work and officiant) or just a symbolic one. It could be really intimate and emotional and powerful to have a little thing in a hospital room or hospital chapel. Something your parents and brother would be touched by and be grateful for.   Then you could go off and have a ton of fun at your full wedding and celebrate your commitment again with all your friends and family without feeling guilty about not having your brother and parent there.   Again, could be a total logistical nightmare or maybe something you wouldn't feel comfortable with. But just throwing and idea out there."

They would be able to tell him if it could be sized up that far without ruining the setting - the fact he doesn't know for certain the size would indicate he hasn't.

weddingplanning,3dw9v0,BadLuckNovelist,2,Mon Jul 20 02:01:28 2015 UTC,No he hasn't-- and since he won't let me see the ring I can't do too much research on my own. I'm definitely pushing for him to visit a jeweler ASAP so that we can have a real think about what to do.

weddingplanning,3dw9v0,Prairiegirl4,11,Mon Jul 20 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"Jewellery consultant here: our general rule is if it's more than two sizes up, you would have to special order the ring. Either up or down will cause tension.   Sadly because of the difference there would be too much pressure on the setting and ultimately risk damaging the stones or losing them all together.   But. There is a solution. Go to a local jeweller and bring in the ring. Tell him/her that you want setting wise and that you want to use the stones. It won't necessarily be completely custom rather than a new setting that will fit what you are looking for.   I sincerely hope it works out. Don't feel down about it either. As long as you guys talk it over and go visit a jeweller they will be able to help you!! Good luck!"
weddingplanning,3dw9v0,kyrien,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:26:28 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for your input! I absolutely want to avoid damaging it! I'll have SO go to a jeweler and show them the ring and see what our options are from there.
weddingplanning,3dw9v0,robotneedslove,6,Mon Jul 20 15:13:35 2015 UTC,As a potential upside... Rather than being doomed to ruin the setting... Perhaps (if it can't be resized) this is a chance to reset it into a style you like? Which may be a blessing in disguise since you mention you weren't originally very excited about this ring?
weddingplanning,3dw9v0,lindsayadult,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:03 2015 UTC,"The thing is that I don't even know what it looks like (other than the basic description he gave me!) and he won't let me see. I'm afraid that resetting it would upset FMIL as it's her (long deceased) mother's ring and FMIL already doesn't like me... honestly if the ring won't work as is, I may just ask SO to pick out a cheaper engagement ring (the value of his grandmother's ring is far greater than we could afford to spend) and wear that and hope that I can lose enough weight in the future to make resizing it possible. This wedding stuff is complicated!"

It's like, being told two upsetting things that negate each other out, but in the end were both upsetting.  I think your idea here would be the best.  Get an e-ring that you like and that he can afford, and keep his grandma's e-ring intact as is.  If you would still like to wear it, you could put it on a chain and wear it like a pendant."

If you have five people + SOs, and two of them are your Aunt and Uncle, that leaves even less you may need the block for.  I'd say to just put together a packet of information about local hotels and attractions, and restaurants that are new to the area (if there are any), and send it with the invites or attach it to the wedding website if you have one."
weddingplanning,3dvyl7,aeb1022,3,Mon Jul 20 00:30:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yes I've made sure to provide a link on our wedding website to the Visitor Center site. The wedding, and where most of us live, are all near a historic area of town (called Main Street, like I've seen in a lot of places) that has a lot of mom & pop shops, restaurants, bars, a casino, etc. There are a variety of hotels in the area too & with it being the end of October, they shouldn't be booked up."
weddingplanning,3dvyl7,snickerdoodleglee,2,Mon Jul 20 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"I say set up a small block, and just make sure to follow the rules, like cancel unused rooms more than 30 days out from the wedding.    If a hotel won't let you ""reserve a block"", you can always just book some rooms under your name, and again, cancel them with enough time to spare. Most hotels let you cancel up until 24-48 hrs before without taking a deposit."
weddingplanning,3dvyl7,hellokittyisnotacat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"It’s controversial, but I’ve decided against offering a hotel block. We’re inviting approx 105 people to our wedding. Of those, about 25-30 are from overseas. It breaks down into 3 categories: friends who have family or close friends in our city that they always stay with instead of using a hotel; my friends from overseas; my parents’ friends from overseas. IF everyone says they’re coming, we would be looking at about 10-12 hotel rooms: 6-7 are my friends and about 4-5 would be my parents’ friends.   My friends and my parents’ friends will not stay in the same hotel. They just won’t. My parents’ friends will want a nicer hotel, a more expensive one, with the exception of one who will look for a super budget hotel. My friends will either do Airbnb or a super budget hotel. I don’t see an expensive hotel letting me do a block of 3-4 rooms, nor do I see a budget hotel doing a block of about 4-5 rooms. And, again, this is only if every single person from overseas RSVPs yes! So I’m just going to put up a list of hotels in the area in a range of prices and let people sort it out themselves.   The TL;DR: know or check with your guests. If you don’t foresee needing more than a handful of hotel rooms – and it may only be 1-2 hotel rooms, in which case you can’t do a block! - then skip it."
weddingplanning,3dvyl7,JinanReddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:03:57 2015 UTC,"I think that if you need as many as 5 rooms, just get a block. You can get a discounted rate and you won't be on the hook for the extra rooms (usually)."
weddingplanning,3dvrmi,azinnyy,9,Sun Jul 19 23:00:48 2015 UTC,Look at it from the venues' perspective. They could make thousands on ceremony and reception for one wedding.. or just the ceremony fee for yours? They don't want to lose the day. Are you asking them about Friday-Sunday? You might have more luck with the venues on a day they probably wouldn't book anyway and/or off season.   Maybe try non traditional wedding venues? Public parks and those kinds of places

weddingplanning,3dvrmi,ill_have_the_lobster,2,Mon Jul 20 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"I had a bride (who was doing a very small wedding, like 20 people) who wanted to get married by the ocean and they picked out some cliffs up in Gloucester - pretty much just cruised up a street to see who had a big driveway and asked if they could borrow the backyard for two or three hours (I think they ended up paying like $75, but they didn't need chairs or anything).  TL;DR You might be able to snag a space, you just need to think outside the box. There are also a lot of parks that might be more amenable to this sort of thing (since they tend to be sprawling and don't really do anything with weddings)."
weddingplanning,3dvr1w,HidingThings,3,Sun Jul 19 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"I went through exactly this when I went dress shopping a few weekends ago. I have the exact same body type as you, I've been all different sizes but am currently down 20lbs from my heaviest. I'd also like to lose 30lbs before my wedding in August of next year. I went into dress shopping thinking that it was going to be a horrendous experience and that I wouldn't like anything. I was wrong! I actually loved everything and picked a dress that is the complete OPPOSITE of what I thought I was going to get. My advice to you is to not let yourself get wrapped up in what you thought you wanted. If it looks good and feels good to you, then go for it! You want to be comfortable on your wedding day. I know what you mean when you say things look ""wrong"" on you. However, I think that it's because you are not entirely happy with your current weight. If you really put your mind to it, you can lose those pounds. If not, then you will have a dress that you look and feel comfortable with at your heaviest--so there is no pressure either way on yourself. I wish you the best of luck and I am sure that you look beautiful!"
weddingplanning,3dvr1w,gingie08,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:15:39 2015 UTC,"See, the cognitively dissonant thing is that I think I look amazing in all kinds of dresses that have nothing to do with my wedding. I can pull together outfits in the mirror that I find very flattering. I think there's something about it being my WEDDING dress that ups the stakes for me."
weddingplanning,3dvr1w,gingie08,2,Sun Jul 19 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"I understand completely, I go through the same thing. I get so nervous that literally all eyes will be on me. This sub has helped tremendously in that I have gotten to see all kinds of brides of all different shapes and sizes on their wedding day to give me a more realistic expectation of what brides actually look like (as opposed to models on sites). Offbeat bride (I believe) also has a collection of photos of brides who are more regular and plus sized and that has also helped me to normalize how I will look and feel if I don't lose the weight."
weddingplanning,3dvr1w,lily10110,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"What type of dress did you want and what type of body type do you have? (Like, apple, boy figure, etc.?)

weddingplanning,3dvjh6,itslevioSAH,23,Sun Jul 19 21:51:39 2015 UTC,"Your ex is attending the wedding because he is your FH's friend - not because he is your ex. You shouldn't look at it as ""do I really have to allocate a plus one for my ex?"" Instead, you should ask yourself ""what right do I have to tell my FH that his friend doesn't deserve a plus one?""  I think it will help if you stop thinking of this man as your ex, and instead as a dear friend your FH treasures. That makes him deserving of a plus one."
weddingplanning,3dvjh6,GuestQuest,3,Sun Jul 19 22:15:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for the thoughtful response! I guess I was wondering if I should go above and beyond because he's my ex. We wouldn't otherwise give him a plus one because they're not living together/engaged/married - but would I need to do more for him?
weddingplanning,3dvjh6,GuestQuest,4,Sun Jul 19 22:47:12 2015 UTC,"I think the easiest solution is to talk to your FH and see what he thinks. I'm sure it'd be simple for your FH to go to his friend and ask if he's interested in (or would even like) the option to have a plus one. You don't need to do anything to go above and beyond for this guest, you just need to make sure that your FH's friends receive the same consideration and importance that you're giving to your friends. There's a limited number of people on the guest list, so both you and your FH will need to navigate compromises along the way. If he's comfortable withholding a plus one for this friend, then problem resolved. If he wants to discuss things with his friend first, or feels it's important to give him the option of a plus one - then that will be a different conversation.   When in doubt - talk to your (future) spouse and see if a problem actually exists before you start worrying about implications.   Good luck!"
weddingplanning,3dvjh6,xoSamiya,4,Sun Jul 19 23:04:06 2015 UTC,Nope! No reason to go above and beyond what you're doing for your other guests.
weddingplanning,3dvjh6,dart56,9,Sun Jul 19 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"Will the ex have other friends there? If yes, I would not give him a plus one."
weddingplanning,3dvjh6,cdnpirate,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:54 2015 UTC,I look at it this way. You are asking friends and family to come and celebrate your love. Etiquette dictates you need to respect their love as well and should invite their SO's. I don't agree with the rationale that they need to be living together or engaged or married. I'd be offended if I were a guest but say I had a BF that was long distance. By your rule he wouldn't be invited. Just something to think about. Happy planning!
weddingplanning,3dv7u1,Fenna7,24,Sun Jul 19 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"There's really no way to advertise the alcohol as a deterrent. Honestly, deterring invited guests seems rude-ish to me. I'd rather not be invited.  The children you want there will be acknowledged on their parents' invitations. Their names go on the inner envelope. If you put a line on your RSVP cards that says ""we have reserved __ seats in your honor"" then you can fill in however many guests are welcome for each household. This will make it clear to most people that their children aren't included in the invite.  Just don't send ""obligation invites."" It's worse if people can tell they're invited but not welcome than if the invite list just stays small from the start. If money is an issue, you need to figure out how many people you can afford, then invite that many. Do not over-invite, especially not people who don't support your relationship.  You absolutely can invite your friends while cutting back on family - especially if you're paying for your own wedding.       I will also add that sending invites a week before your weekday destination wedding sends a really clear message that ""we felt like we were supposed to tell you about it, but we really don't want you there."""
weddingplanning,3dv7u1,I_will_slap_you,12,Sun Jul 19 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"I have what is probably a really unpopular opinion - if I/we want someone there, we invite them.  If not, they don't get an invite.  Period.  End of.  As for your particular situations, I'd suggest the following:  1) Before sending invites, let your relatives know that alcohol will be included in the reception.  Some of them may right off the bat say they won't attend due to it, and you can discuss whether they would be willing to forgo an invite then - which can help you figure out who to invite and who not to.    2) I notice you say you wouldn't mind them there, but don't say you want them there-  if it's just a matter that you don't mind one way or the other, I'd say just have no children, period, considering it'll be easier day-of, parents won't need to take care of them during ceremony and reception, etc.  If you want them there, maybe involve them in the wedding party if you have one, with the exception being 'wedding party children.'  I also feel like your idea of telling the people you want and sending invites a week in advance is just begging to backfire.  I would just send the invites normally, and invite the people you want to be there.  For those that don't make the cut, be honest - you wanted/needed a small wedding, and while you love and care for them, you had to be critical about who you invited and who you didn't, that them not getting an invite is not an indicator of how you feel about them."
weddingplanning,3dv7u1,BadLuckNovelist,11,Sun Jul 19 20:36:41 2015 UTC,Just don't invite the people you don't care to have there. Feelings will probably get a bit hurt either way but that's the least tacky way to do it. Sending out an invite the week before the wedding sends a much worse message in my opinion.
weddingplanning,3dv7u1,box-of-stars,11,Sun Jul 19 20:38:47 2015 UTC,"For the nieces, would you consider having them as flower girls or something along the lines.  Then you can just say  only children allowed are bridal party members."

weddingplanning,3dv7u1,k9centipede,4,Mon Jul 20 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"I'm from a pretty religious family, where nobody drinks. My FFIL literally drinks every. single. day. FH's parents are paying for a bar (because FH and I said we weren't paying for it, since neither of us drink). So far, tons of my relatives, as well as several family friends (who we know from church) have RSVPd yes. They won't be drinking, but they want to celebrate with us. This was something I was actually quite worried about, but I've gotten some really sweet messages from these people about how excited they are for me and how they're looking forward to our wedding. I hope you have a similar experience, because I've felt really loved. If you make your nieces flower girls, they can attend even if you say it's a child free wedding, because they'll be part of the wedding party. Don't invite people you don't want to invite. I didn't invite any co-workers (from my old job, because I just started a brand new job). FH invited only the ones he's close with. As long as you say ""we're keeping it small"", nobody can really complain. Also, if you do it on a weekday, out of town, those ""obligation"" invites are less likely to come. If they're your real friends, they will want to come and celebrate with you. Just remember that.   I wouldn't do that last minute invite thing. I would just invite the people you want to be there. Again, the more difficult it is to attend, the less likely it is that people who aren't super close to you will go out of their way to attend."
weddingplanning,3dv7u1,wilde_em,3,Sun Jul 19 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"1) It's your choice to serve beer and wine, and the religious/conservative among you will have to be fine with that.   2) As others have stated, you could include the nieces in the bridal party, and/or you could just clearly state on your invites who is invited (We have served ____seats in your honor.)   3) Don't invite people who you don't want to be there. Because whether out of obligation or wanting to be there, if they say ""yes,"" you still won't want them there.   4) That's good!  5 from your paragraph: I think it comes off rude to invite people at the last second. Just simply don't invite them, and explain to them that your venue doesn't have the space if they ask you about it. If you say, we are having a small, intimate ceremony, then they will have to get over it."
weddingplanning,3dv7u1,kingsla07,3,Sun Jul 19 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the input.  Okay okay inviting people right before a weekday destination wedding is RUDE - it was (kind of?) a joke... but it's definitely a joke now.  Only inviting people we want there - got it. I think ""we have a small venue and budget, we had to make critical decisions"" is good."

weddingplanning,3ducsu,OrganicallyRose,9,Sun Jul 19 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"I feel it could look nice if it gets a bit altered in the chest area. Very elegant and statuesque. The neckline as it is looks a bit too deep/too loose in the boob area and visually bringing everything down.   That being said, if you feel something holding you back try looking more. Wearing a veil is totally going to make you feel like a bride no matter what dress but you should like the dress even without it especially since you won't be wearing a cathedral lenght veil the whole day.  Is it an amazing deal? For sure. But it should be more of a case where you love a dress despite the price rather than love the dress more because it's cheaper than expected."
weddingplanning,3ducsu,pusheen_the_cat,2,Sun Jul 19 16:32:46 2015 UTC,Thank you for your honesty! Not sure how well the photo translates the fabric but it's all chiffon.

You have a lovely slender figure and the dress should show that off, not hide it! If that is just the style of the dress, as you said in another comment, it may not be the best style for your body. But if you're getting the back altered anyway, and you're willing, it'll be easy for them to take it in at the chest a bit."
weddingplanning,3ducsu,kitteninabox2,5,Sun Jul 19 23:09:03 2015 UTC,"Whoa, $179??? That's amazing! I would never have guessed it cost so little- it fits you really well and I'm crazy about the back. I also unexpectedly found my dress on the first day.

weddingplanning,3dus2u,streamandpool,9,Sun Jul 19 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"I like it; it's short, nice, personal...good!   My only critique would be that the ""...coming to my bridal shower and celebrating my upcoming wedding with me"" sort of rubs me the wrong way. I think it's the ""my""'s that are getting to me. I mean, I get that showers are about the person/event/whatever, but I like to think that when I go to a shower, I'm going to hang out with a friend and celebrate someone I love...not so much the fact that she's getting married/having a baby/all the other 31 year old female parties I get invited to. It's about her, not the event.  What about simply ""Thank you so much for coming to the shower last weekend"" or ""I had a great time at the shower last weekend and hope you did too. Thanks so much for coming, and for the (whatever gift); I can't wait to (whatever you do with the gift you got)!"" Something a bit less 'you' and a bit more 'them'. Does that make sense?  Another note (and this is probably just me being SO nitpicky) - you say 'we' look forward to seeing you at the end...I wonder if you can include your partner someone else in the note (""X and I love the gift and we can't wait to use it!"") or if you keep it to ""I look forward to seeing you..."" -- again, it just makes it a bit more personal.

Surprises get ruined, your FW isn't a child, and it sounds like her MOH is going to be throwing her a really nice party regardless.   Weddings can be a huge financial burden on bridesmaids, and it's great that those two girls felt comfortable enough with you guys to be open and honest about their situations."
weddingplanning,3dxw0a,happysaurous,30,Mon Jul 20 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"It sucks that some of your wedding party is dropping out now but you asked them 4 and half years ago. I'm sure these girls had no idea their financial situations wouldn't be good when your wedding rolled around. Hopefully you are able to rely on other members of your bridal party to be there for you!  I'm not sure why the shower being a surprise is important. Obviously your bride knows she is having a shower at some point, so why does it matter if she also knows where and when it is? A shower really isn't a surprise party. It sounds to me like her bridesmaids and mother are just trying to throw her a nice shower and she should be happy that she has such thoughtful women in her life.   I'm sorry if this seems unkind toward your feelings, but it sounds like you two are upset without real cause and possibly creating unnecessary drama."

I hope they can realize how minor this is and enjoy and appreciate what their friends and family are doing for them.    Also- asking your wedding party 4 1/2 years in advance?! I can't speak for everyone but I'm certain the person I would have asked that long ago is different than my MOH now.
weddingplanning,3dxw0a,lroc23,18,Mon Jul 20 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I understand that she wanted to be surprised but there are much worse things that could happen than seeing the invitation. I think you guys are turning into bride/groom-zillas. If you didn't want it to happen on your birthday weekend you could have specified beforehand and prevented that from happening. As for the other stuff, it sucks but at least they told you about it."
weddingplanning,3dxw0a,rawriya,19,Mon Jul 20 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"I understand that your fiancee had certain expectations for this event that were not met, and that you hate to see her disappointed, but I think you both need to take a step back.     FW told MOH that it's all her responsibility and FW doesn't want to know ANYTHING about it until she is delivered as a surprise to it.     TBH this sounds a little extreme. And although I hate to use this word, a little bridezilla-ish. A shower is a) an optional event, meaning not a mandatory part of wedding planning, b) an event someone should volunteer to host, not be told to, and c) not the same as a child's surprise birthday party. It's so generous and thoughtful that your fiancees friends are throwing her this great party, and if the worst she has to worry about is that it's not a surprise, I think y'all are in pretty good shape.    I hope your FW is able to put this in perspective and enjoy her bridal shower!"
weddingplanning,3dxw0a,aeb1022,18,Mon Jul 20 14:25:15 2015 UTC,I think you need to relax more about things. The maid of honour is trying to plan a nice bridal shower for your fiancee so you should focus on being grateful for that rather than telling her off for 'ruining' the surprise. It's very difficult to plan an event and keep it totally in the dark.
weddingplanning,3dxw0a,Alect0,18,Mon Jul 20 14:17:52 2015 UTC,"So here's what I see. The shower seems to have good food that the mum took home. The price per head is apparently fantastic. And finally, the invitations for the shower look gorgeous.   You know, I understand that your FW wanted to be surprised but that didn't happen. And what can be done now? Do you want the MOH to plan an entirely new shower? That would be insane, right?  So you have this shower planned now. Do you want to punish the MOH? Shall we throw her out of the wedding? That would be insane too, right?  So what can be done? Nothing. Let it go. Tell FW to just enjoy it. Is she going to sit there and stew at her shower?  Because honestly, if you guy do anything other then let it go and be gracious that she even has a shower, then your wedding party is going to start talking about you. Frankly, you guys are being unreasonable.  Shit happens. You're still getting married and having an awesome wedding. Just let this anger go. It's not healthy."

Your wedding is on the line! I mean, nobody has ever just gone into work one day and gotten let go with no warning!  If the fact that this very nice bridal shower just isn't going to be a total shock and surprise to your fiancée means that her wedding is just ruined and her friends are inconsiderate jerks - you all need to reevaluate your priorities, expectations, and general character.

If I heard an ounce of ungrateful behavior or demands like OP and his FW, I would call off the whole thing.  Shame on them.

They were handmade and adorable. If she gave away any detail of it, I would not flip out that my shower is ruined. I didn't tell her she had to throw a party, and I certainly never said I expected her to do it on her own. Don't people realize that showers are not mandatory? And acting like a spoiled brat is the best way to get yourself uninvited?"
weddingplanning,3dxw0a,socialsecurityguard,3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:12 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, this all sounds so disappointing. I understand feeling let down, it must be so hard when you are looking forward to your big day and those around you aren't as thoughtful as you would hope. My advice: try to focus on the good, and try to remember that everyone is the centre of their own universe. Remember to thank those who are making an effort to come, and try to look past those who aren't. I hope your FW has a blast at her shower!"
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,Adelaidey,10,Sat Jul 18 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"It's all so gorgeous but I LOVE the ""ceremonial changing of the status""!! I was looking for something to do instead of cake-cutting and I might just steal that."
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,originalchull,10,Sat Jul 18 23:12:30 2015 UTC,Gorgeous!!! You look really radiant. :) May I ask what the venue is? I'm also a Chicagoan and really curious where you found such an awesome rooftop.
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,sylviecerise,6,Sat Jul 18 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I work in the Chicago wedding industry, and that is Lacuna Lofts in Pilsen. One of my favorite locations in the city!"
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,SpaceshipEarth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:25:52 2015 UTC,"Oh nice!! I thought it might be Pilsen—I'm an artist & have heard of Lacuna Lofts, but never realized what a beautiful rooftop it has. Thank you!"
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,sylviecerise,3,Sun Jul 19 03:56:58 2015 UTC,"It was Lacuna Artist Lofts in Pilsen (i was living in Pilsen when I began dating my wife, so.)- they recently began being managed by LM, which means their price has at least tripled, unfortunately. It was easily the most stressful part of the wedding planning process- finding out that your wedding venue has changed hands 2 months before your wedding is... not great. And there were honestly a lot of communication/ deadline problems with the new management, which I suppose should be expected with a new acquisition, but which were nonetheless incredibly stressful."
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,nochilinopity,2,Sun Jul 19 04:13:17 2015 UTC,"Wah, been getting recommendations from friends to go with Lacuna, quite the stab in the gut to see that first line. Ah well, congrats to you two!"
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,sylviecerise,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"Man, that is incredibly frustrating—that would stress anyone out! Most venues are so ridiculously expensive already in Chicago, it sucks to hear that one of the few non-crazy locations is no longer affordable. :("

weddingplanning,3ds1m8,cats_pal,2,Sun Jul 19 12:00:25 2015 UTC,I'm a Chicagoan as well. Your wedding looks beautiful. It's easy to go with a low-key vibe and minimal decor when you have such a stunning background. I'm so glad the weather agreed with you. And the gold dress was the perfect choice! Thank you for sharing these shots.
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,Mycupof_tea,2,Sun Jul 19 12:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy to see someone else using paper plates! I figured we'd do that for our reception because the caterer offers them, but my mom kind of shot it down... I may come back to her with pictures of your wedding :P  Congratulations on your marriage!"
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,epipin,3,Sun Jul 19 13:29:54 2015 UTC,My mother and I compromised similarly with super nice plastic plates. Check out Smarty had a Party online. They have dozens of beautiful options such that my mother and I were able to find something we agreed upon.

weddingplanning,3ds1m8,Apicalmeristem,2,Sun Jul 19 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"gorgeous wedding!  it looks perfect~  question on spotify -- did you let the playlists shuffle, or did you control the order of the songs?  if you controlled the order, did you put the heavier dance songs later/middle of the night so people would be a bit more... drunk? lol"
weddingplanning,3ds1m8,mortualuna,4,Mon Jul 20 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"I controlled the order of the songs.   I had six playlists, each of which were 30 minutes longer than they had to be.   1: Preshow was all Ella Fitzerald and Louis Armstrong, and played while people were being seated.  2: Cocktails played immediately after our recessional, mostly while we were being photographed.  3: Dinner & Toasts was played during dinner and toasts, and ended up being 90% superfluous, because the music was turned down while people were on the mic, which ended up being most of dinner!  4: Focus Dances was just our first dance, our father/daughter dances, and the couples' elimination dance.  5: Dancing was dancing! I put in 3-4 fast dance songs between each slow dance song. As I mentioned, most of the slow dance songs were the first dances of other couples. I started with the oldest couples' songs earlier in the night, because I figured they'd be leaving earlier. I kicked off with fairly innocuous dancing music - Barry White, Love on Top, etc, and by the end of the night I had transitioned into Janelle Monae, R. Kelly, etc.  6: Cooldown was just 30 minutes of sentimental songs to play after last call to get us all appropriately teary as we packed up and went home - my wife's nostalgia song with her childhood friends, my song with my childhood friends, the first song my wife and I ever danced to, etc. It was a nice way to wrap up."

weddingplanning,3dty70,faeryjessa,24,Sun Jul 19 13:01:39 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could have it altered to include a layer of lavender tulle underneath the top layer of the skirt the the details. That could be beautiful!
weddingplanning,3dty70,5b3ll,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:03 2015 UTC,"This is actually what my dress has--there's some lavender fabric mixed in with the white, it becomes a light shimmery pink/purple color. It looks (imho) gorgeous. It's very clearly not white but it's clearly still a wedding dress. OP, If you go back to David's, ask to see the dress below (which is the one I wound up getting) and you can get an idea of what it would look like if you did that with the one you're considering.  http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_strapless-a-line-gown-with-two-toned-skirt-ms251074_wedding-dresses-all-wedding-dresses"

weddingplanning,3dty70,5b3ll,17,Mon Jul 20 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"I deliberately did a few things.   went dress shopping alone. I didn't want anyone else pressuring/influencing me on what I ""should"" be wearing only tried on dresses in the colour that I wanted (reds) never mentioned that it was for a wedding, just that I wanted a formal, red dress   saved a fortune (dress + alterations = $245), got a dress I loved and have since had it altered again into a sweetheart necklined tea length dress that I've worn several times over"
weddingplanning,3dty70,annagarny,7,Sun Jul 19 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"I have a royal blue dress. One of the things I like about it is the lace. A lot of people will tell you this is a bad idea but what I did was find a dress I loved and had it custom made in the color I wanted by a seller on aliexpress. I found a very highly rates seller and read reviews and looked at pictures posted by customers to see the quality. They communicated well, the dress turned out well and is very well made. It still needs alterations but not much. I think the lace looks lovely in blue. So this is something to consider if you are willing to take a risk. It cost about 130 for my dress which was based on a designer dress. I'm willing to give the seller info and dress pics of anyone is interested."
weddingplanning,3dty70,companionquandary,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:10:01 2015 UTC,I would love to see pictures and seller info! How long was the turnaround time on the dress? Was it just like the picture? Could you post a picture of the dress you loved for comparison? Thanks!!!
weddingplanning,3dty70,companionquandary,8,Sun Jul 19 14:43:12 2015 UTC,Here are pictures of the designer dress on the model and my dress on a mannequin. No pics on me as all the ones I took were really dark and grainy and now it's being altered. It looks really good in person though and the inside of the dress is made well which is a sign of quality. The seller is gardenia suzhou wedding dress company on aliexpress.  Here's the back because it randomly got left out. I am very happy with the quality and am actually having them make my rehearsal dress as well. Hope this helps
weddingplanning,3dty70,KoalaBear27,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:41 2015 UTC,I think it looks better in blue!
weddingplanning,3dty70,rissm,2,Sun Jul 19 18:12:29 2015 UTC,Your dress is stunning - I'm so impressed with the quality and price!
weddingplanning,3dty70,companionquandary,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:36:01 2015 UTC,Thanks I'm really excited about seeing it again after the alterations
weddingplanning,3dty70,Shawoowoo,4,Mon Jul 20 14:01:49 2015 UTC,"Before I became engaged, I knew that I didn't want the typical white dress. Honestly, I had my heart set on a yellow, long sleeve, lace dress that I found online. I could never find it. Eventually, after months of looking, I found my wedding dress. It isn't my yellow dream, but it isn't white (can't say anything because my FH is on reddit) and I'm happy with my dress. Do I still think back on my yellow dress? Absolutely. Sometimes, I regret not wearing a yellow dress, but I always wanted that white dress moment that I've dreamt of since I was 5. So, I say do what will make you happy and won't regret your decision."
weddingplanning,3dty70,11Petrichor,3,Sun Jul 19 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"You may be able to have it professionally dyed? Do you know what fabric it's made of? The page doesn't really say.   My dress is black and white, and the designer had a handful of colored dresses. The shop I went to only stocked the white versions of the dresses so I tried them on in white, and kind of had to envision them in the colors, but it worked out in the end."
weddingplanning,3dty70,bulelainwen,3,Sun Jul 19 13:13:09 2015 UTC,"I sort of doubt it, because there's 3 different kinds of materials (the base layer, the tulle, and the lace) so I'd think they'd all absorb the dye differently."
weddingplanning,3dty70,mizz_kittay,4,Sun Jul 19 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"You are completely right! And since it's from David's Bridal, it's most likely some type of polyester fabric. And polyester fabric does not take dye well. And there are not that many polyester dyes on the market (thankfully more are coming!) and to get a good color match, it would be extremely difficult."
weddingplanning,3dty70,Moral_Gutpunch,3,Sun Jul 19 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, yes!!!! For the longest time I was determined to find a beautiful yellow or red dress, then somehow I ended up buying a white one. I have no idea what happened! Lol! But I do adore my dress!"
weddingplanning,3dty70,GoooingToTheChapel,3,Sun Jul 19 15:15:21 2015 UTC,I shopped prom and bridesmaid dresses and found a stunning dress in deep purple.
weddingplanning,3dty70,Khalypso,4,Mon Jul 20 05:48:25 2015 UTC,That dress is BEGGING for a luscious purple satin sash! One that cascades down the back of the whole dress.
weddingplanning,3dty70,bulelainwen,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm in the same boat as you. My heart is set on a red wedding dress, and I good one I love that just didn't come in anything but whites. It's really frustrating, and I even had a dream last night where I was looking for a dress in a neighbor's yard sale. My cousin suggested that I may be able to dye a dress, but right now I'm thinking about custom ordering one. I just have to set up an appointment right now. Also, I know that one designer can do at least red for some of her dresses so if all else fails I have something I can fall back on. Don't worry, you have time! But seriously, not all brides want white! I'm sure whatever you decide to go with will be gorgeous!"
weddingplanning,3dty70,Khalypso,6,Sun Jul 19 14:05:32 2015 UTC,"Custom order, don't dye! You can possibly dye, but each fabric takes dye differently and 100% natural fabrics will dye, but polyester just sort of absorbs to a pastel version."
weddingplanning,3dty70,auntiepink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dying the dress just doesn't sound like the best idea. I'm just hoping custom won't get too expensive."
weddingplanning,3dty70,MsBeeblebrox,2,Sun Jul 19 18:40:49 2015 UTC,I had always sworn that I'd have a pink dress. Then we chose orange for our wedding color and I'll be in white. But it has everything else I wanted so I'm not too upset.
weddingplanning,3dty70,Dried_Apple,2,Sun Jul 19 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"I ended up sewing my blue dress. It was a pattern I found years ago and it came out beautifully. I also checked several dressmakers and found some amazing things in very non traditional colors and styles. White was never an option, pink almost was."
weddingplanning,3dty70,jwallwalrus26,2,Sun Jul 19 15:25:23 2015 UTC,Take your time now to find and try on the red dresses you want.  Sort of the opposite. I figured I'd go with off white of some sort to be traditional because I hate wearing white so much. I'm ending up with peach top and off white bottom.  Close but colored.
weddingplanning,3dty70,wafflesveryhappy,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"When looking online, colored dresses were my main search and I was looking at evening gowns at Nordstroms, Tadashi Shoji, Badgley Mischka...  At bridal shops I'd pull anything that had colored and I ended up with the wedding version of an evening gown by Luly Yang. The bottom is a light pink.  http://imgur.com/FUKEzJt  Look into evening gowns if your OK with not having a long train, but you might be able to get a seamstress to add one."
weddingplanning,3dty70,Sapphire_bride,2,Mon Jul 20 00:43:35 2015 UTC,"I also desperately wanted a coloured wedding dress. I went to the normal wedding dress shops and then tried on their bridesmaid section. In the end I bought a gun metal grey dress. Bit different from the original emerald or gold that I wanted, but I LOVE it."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,11Petrichor,35,Sun Jul 19 10:55:31 2015 UTC,You invite them to the rehearsal and they'll all mill around together while the actual rehearsing is happening.
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,mizz_kittay,4,Sun Jul 19 11:05:11 2015 UTC,"I actually think this is a good idea. Everyone worries about the plus one being lonely at the wedding, but this let's them all meet each other."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,Dried_Apple,2,Sun Jul 19 14:56:27 2015 UTC,Even if we're doing a separate dinner? Man that's gonna be so awkward for them.
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,mizz_kittay,15,Sun Jul 19 11:10:51 2015 UTC,"It'll be fine for them. But if the dinner is at a separate location then you can give each pair the choice: bridal party member must be at venue at 6pm, and their date can tag along there or meet up at 6:30 at the restaurant, their choice."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,mizz_kittay,3,Sun Jul 19 11:17:37 2015 UTC,"That might work best. I don't want to exclude the dates, but I also don't want to make them have to be at a place they have nothing to do for an hour."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,bradynelise,9,Sun Jul 19 11:31:24 2015 UTC,"Realize though that if there is only one car between the pair,  it's going to be a huge pain to force the dates to meet at the restaurant instead of letting them just stand around the venue location for an hour. Is there a reason you're against letting the dates be at the venue if that's what works best for the pair in question? If you're just thinking they'll be bored, let it go. They know they'll be bored, but they'll be bored waiting around for their date for an hour no matter where they are."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,nmuels,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's mostly that the one girl I mentioned, her date literally knows no one there aside from me and my one bridesmaid. They're from back home 4 hours away and I realized he might not have as much fun as the other plus ones (if they even show up which some I know won't) who have all known each other for years. And I feel kind of bad being like ""hey man ya'll have to be at this thing now and not know anyone but your date and I are too busy doing stuff to make it suck less kbyeeeeee!!!!""   And I mostly have no idea what I'm doing at all when it comes to planning a wedding. lol"

Not all of the plus ones were in town yet, but he just checked out the space and hung out. Rehearsals don't take too long anyway.  Then we all went to the dinner."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,jlynnbizatch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"This is what we did.  They are going to be separated enough from their dates during the wedding day.  I just told them to be respectful and not intrude, which was fine since they're all adults.  We also told the wedding party explicitly which parts of the weekend their dates would join for or not.  I would have appreciated that kind of info when I was FH's date to some of his friend's weddings.  So it's great that you're thinking of this...once you decide, inform them."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,hedgehogcheese,11,Sun Jul 19 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"I was recently the +1 at a wedding when my FH was a groomsmen. The couple told the wedding party that rehearsal was at X time and would be followed by dinner at [restaurant]. Their partners were welcome to come to the rehearsal and be the ""audience"", or everyone was meeting in the hotel lobby at [time] to head over to the dinner together.   It was great, because I had the option of coming along if I really didn't want to be apart from FH for whatever reason, but could also have some time to myself. I'm pretty sure I ended up taking a nap in the hotel room and grabbing a drink in the bar while waiting for them, it was lovely."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,btrswt88,2,Sun Jul 19 11:37:31 2015 UTC,Second this.  Every wedding I've been in (or been a plus one for) have given the guest the option of coming to the rehearsal and watching if they so pleased.
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,octoberzebra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"I think I'll go this route. That way everyone can do what they want, I'm not forcing anyone to be somewhere they don't want to or not be a place they do, and they don't have to feel like I'll be offended in any way if they opt to skip out."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,6119,4,Sun Jul 19 12:11:29 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of giving them the option to come or not. One might prefer to just relax at the hotel, or maybe they adore weddings and enjoy being in that celebratory atmosphere."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,faeryjessa,3,Sun Jul 19 11:36:42 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend was a groomsman recently and it wasn't mentioned if plus 1s were to go to the rehearsal dinner.   I chose not to,  figuring out wasn't worth asking (local wedding), I'm sure he'd be busy and I'd just be puttering around,  and it was just a couple of hours,  I wasn't missing out on anything.  Turns out,  the other 7 members of the bridal party (all local) brought their dates.  I felt the couple should have been more upfront initially about who was invited but it's not a big deal in the end. If any of the bridal party traveled, it would be nice to include the dates and do so across the board."
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,ktagly2,2,Sun Jul 19 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"same happened to me! It was awkward being asked why I didn't come to the dinner, and explaining that I didn't know I was invited"
weddingplanning,3dtq1b,k9centipede,3,Mon Jul 20 05:55:08 2015 UTC,"Most of the dates hang out at the venue while the whole wedding party and parents rehearse. It's a great way for all of the plus ones to meet. You've got enough on your plate to worry about someone's date not knowing anyone, that usually comes with being someone's date at a wedding where you don't know a lot of people."

Before booking ours, we met with him in person, he gave us the rundown, a contract to look over, and we've been in often-enough contact with him ever since.  Personally, I'd never consider hiring someone without a contract. It looks like someone already helped with that, so good luck! Hopefully your friend will be welcoming of it :)"
weddingplanning,3dty8i,acciogiraffe,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:01 2015 UTC,"It's been the case with mine. He's contracted through the venue, and I've been communicating with him via phone and email, but I won't actually meet him til the wedding."
weddingplanning,3dty8i,SuperiorHedgehog,5,Sun Jul 19 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely, definitely do not do this without a contract.  Relatedly, I urge you to think about the implications this might have for the dynamics of your friendship.  The main point of having a contract is that you have a mechanism to threaten/hold their feet to the fire if something goes wrong.  Would you be willing to do that if something happened?  Sometimes it's better to go with a professional, rather than trying to have a professional relationship with a friend.  Just something to think about."
weddingplanning,3dty8i,ATaleAhead,3,Sun Jul 19 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"I agree about the point about friendship. I do require signed contracts for photography I do for friends, but it's really a meaningless formality. Are they actually going to sue me if I get sick and take too long to deliver results? Would I really make them forfeit their retainer if they cancel on me last-minute?  If you want recourse, you should hire a professional who isn't your friend."
weddingplanning,3dty8i,Jessie4747,3,Sun Jul 19 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. We have close friends doing our photography and wedding coordination for no charge as a wedding gift. We agreed to accept these services as gifts knowing we were taking the risk that something could come up and they would have no obligation to make it. Since photography and coordination aren't top priorities for us and it saved us $$$, we decided it's worth the risk. If I were hiring them and paying them, which I'm not really sure about, I would definitely want a contract...which would be awkward."

weddingplanning,3dv1m9,wilde_em,2,Sun Jul 19 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"You only need one registry for your wedding and showers.  However, having multiple showers can come off as being ""gift grabby"". If your FH's relatives are already invited to the one your MOH is hosting, there's no reason to have another one. The general rule is that if you have more than one shower (ie/different sides of the family) you only invite people to one of those showers."
weddingplanning,3dv1m9,maedeator,7,Sun Jul 19 19:53:10 2015 UTC,"I've known many times different ""groups"" host showers, so it ends up being multiple showers.  For example, my mom and MOH hosted a shower for my hometown friends and family friends, and my FMIL and their neighborhood friends are hosting one for their family and family friends.  I have never considered nor heard others thinking of multiple showers as being ""gift grabby"" since the bride/couple are typically not involved in the planning.. It's a shower for her/them hosted by someone who decided it independently."
weddingplanning,3dv1m9,wilde_em,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:34 2015 UTC,I agree. They've known they're invited to the one hosted by my MOH. My fiance's cousin texted me today saying that his side of the family wanted a smaller shower with just family. It seems odd to me.

Fiance's parents divorced when he was very young. His father remarried soon after and his mother stayed single, but kept her married name to match her kids. We're including his step-mom because she and his dad have been married for quite some time.

You could do:  Parents of the groom....Father and Stepmother                               ....Mother and Stepfather Parents of the bride......Father and Mother  Not sure as much about step grandparents.  I think that kind of depends on whether you want to or not, i.e., do you like them and has it been awhile that they've been together.  If you decide NOT to, then you have to leave that consistent for all grandparents.  For example:  Option 1  Grandparents of the groom.....Grandfather                                        ....Grandmother                                         ....Grandfather and Grandmother  Option 2  Grandparents of the groom.....Grandfather and Step Grandmother                                        .....Grandmother and Step Grandfather                                        .....Grandfather and Grandmother  For the deceased, you can either have them all in their own section or put some kind of notation next to them in their respective section.
