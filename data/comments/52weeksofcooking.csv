This was my first time making both eggnog and ice cream, and both steps went pretty well (despite the latter taking something like seven hours).   I don't have an ice cream machine so I followed these instructions and beat the mixture every half hour or so while it was freezing. I also made meringues to use up the leftover egg whites, and crumbled a few up to use as a topping.  Recipe: http://altonbrown.com/eggnog-ice-cream-recipe/"
52weeksofcooking,3dzjhs,ImAtWorkOkay,8,Mon Jul 20 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"I decided to try a savory take on this weeks. Freezing the sticks solid prior to throwing them in the frying oil gives an awesome texture, and prevents the cheese from melting to fast and oozing out!  What I did:   ~1 cup seasoned flour 3 eggs (beaten, probably could have used less) 1.5 cup Italian bread crumbs Package of string cheese (fresh mozzarella is not best in this recipe) Frying Oil (I used vegetable)   Basically we want to make sure they're coated well. Roll the cheese in flour then egg, then flour then egg, then into the bread crumbs. Really make sure it's coated, then place them single layer on a pan lined with parchment paper. Once all of them have been rolled, place them in the freezer. I transferred them to a freezer bag two hours after freezing because my freezer likes to freezer burn stuff. In total, they were in the freezer for about 12 hours.   Now for the fun part. Get something to fry in (dutch oven, cast iron, deep fryer if you're fancy). Heat your preferred frying oil to about 350-375 any hotter and it might turn messy/burnt. Place a few in the oil without over crowding to prevent the oil temp from dropping. After (2-3? I didn't time them, just go by looking) minutes flip them over to the other side and let fry. Once both sides are nice and crispy, place on a plate lined with paper towels. And there you have it, mozzarella sticks for everyone!"

The way that it works is that you make the filling before hand and freeze it in a pie tin. Theoretically, you can do this months ahead of time if you want to make a fruit pie thats out of season. Also, the freezing process really punctures the fruits and makes an ooey gooey filling.

I was listening to the Alton Brown podcast and he described the differences between a granita and an ice-cream/sorbet and it intrigued me.  After searching for a tasty recipe, I hit on this one.  I wanted to use watermelon because we have been getting some really delicious ones recently and I love the refreshing taste of watermelon juice in the summer.  The addition of the lime and mint added some nice balance to the flavor, though the chopped mint was a little weird when eating.  I served it as a parfait with blueberries, strawberries and whipped cream and it was a great summer treat.  The partially frozen berries were really fun.  In a similar vein and keeping to the granita theme, for the cocktail this week I went with a Sangranita.  I have to say that this actually went surprisingly well.  Since you can’t add rum or brandy to the mixture without dropping the freezing point too far, I liked the use of brown sugar to add a little molasses richness to the wine.  In true sangria style, I served this with fruit (sliced oranges and strawberries)."

52weeksofcooking,3dw48z,jonvoightspencil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"I had one hell of a time with this.   I attended an institute for high school journalism advisers at Kent State the whole week. I left last Sunday morning and got home late Saturday night. So, as I was living in a dorm and had little down time to find a kitchen, I knew that I had today (Sunday, July 19) only.   As I was there, I browsed through Pinterest to find something that would be easy enough for me to throw together in a day.   Well, I got home last night, made my grocery list, and went to bed in a bed that I didn't need to climb a ladder to get into.   Today, at the store, I bought key limes and mint. I was planning to add those to 4 cups of water and a half cup of sugar, which would, in the end, make Egyptian Mint Limeade.   I measured out my sugar - exactly a half cup left. Into the blender... except, I didn't feel like taking out my blender, so I used my food processor. The recipe called for blending all of the ingredients--probably so they would just mix well and not be clumpy.   Next, I figured I'd add the water. I did. And it started dripping out. All over everything. Everywhere. I just stared as water dribbled out of the food processor, off the counters, down the cabinets, and onto the floor.   I told my husband that I was effed. He said he's go to the store to buy me more sugar. I said no. I was defeated.   Until I remembered. Somewhere in the depths of the pantry was a packet. A glorious packet.   Campbell's Moroccan Stew for in the slow cooker.   And dinner was created. And enjoyed. And delicious, actually.   10/10 would make again."

Like, I get intimidated by having too many choices,  and there were so many choices. I ended up picking butter chicken because I'd been intending to make it for a while and it certainly sounds fitting for the occasion. To go with it,  I prepared Puloa (a rice pilafy thing), and sesame shishito peppers (which weren't incredibly on theme,  but I wanted to get to the peppers before they went bad).   Slow Cooker Butter Chicken - My fiance was very impressed,  and it really is an easy, low maintenance preparation.  It reconfirmed for me that I do not like chicken prepared this way. The texture is not my cup of tea.  It was pretty good,  nonetheless.   Pulao - This was great.  It could easily be made as a main dish.  I omitted the cashews and substituted zucchini for the cauliflower.   Sesame Shishito Peppers - Easily my favorite part of the meal,  tbh. They were so yummy."

It's shaved raw beet root, shaved radishes, pink grapefruit, bibb lettuce, fresh dill and a tahini/lime/ginger dressing. I added yogurt to it because it was just too much tahini to start. It was delicious but missing something crunchy. Next time I would throw in some toasted chickpeas or serve with warmed pita (cuz even though that wouldn't be crunchy, that would be delicious enough to make up for it).  I would make this again."
52weeksofcooking,3dkp7y,jakevkline,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:10 2015 UTC,"Since there is no unified idea of what should be served at an Eid al-Fitr celebration, I decided to go to the country where both Mecca and Medina are located and prepared a Saudi meal.  For the main course, I went with Chicken al-Kabsa, which is apparently widely regarded as the national dish of Saudi Arabia.  I made both of the spice blends mostly from whole spices, toasted and then crushed in a mortar & pestle and then cooked the chicken on the grill (because grilling makes everything better).  This was exceptionally delicious and the various spices combined to make a delicious, complex flavor.  Since Eid al-Fitr is also known as the “Sugar Festival,” it only made sense to make a dessert for this week.  I opted for a Basboosa, a syrup-soaked semolina cake which is common all over the Middle East and North Africa.  This recipe turned out exceptionally well, though it needed a bit of tweaking.  I dropped the amount of sugar in the syrup from 3 cups down to 2.  I also cut the cooking time down to around 30 minutes.  Finally, instead of juicing the lemon and then dropping it into the syrup, I zested it and then juiced it because it was just simpler and neater that way.  We served this with a mix of white nectarines and oranges macerated in sugar and lemon zest and it was delightful.  Finally, since we are celebrating the end of Ramadan, it didn’t seem right to make an alcoholic cocktail.  While perusing various Saudi recipes, I came across a perfect beverage to make instead: Saudi Champagne.  The name and the bubbly refreshingness of the drink is a nod towards the cocktail but it also complies with the theme by being non-alcoholic and from Saudi Arabia.  It was a great drink to serve with dessert and was a light and fruity way to finish the meal."

However, tagines are kind of expensive, and I didn't want to drop that kind of money for something I'd probably just use once and then put in my basement for a long time.  So...cast iron dutch oven it is!    This is the recipe I followed and didn't change much of anything aside from the amount of salt, which it definitely needed some more of.  I also used sliced almonds instead of whole blanched (since it was what I had), which browned much quicker than whole would have.  I cooked it in that dutch oven with the lid slightly ajar, making sure it was angled so that it would drip condensation back into the stew.  The end result was awesome!  I would definitely make it again.  It had a great balance of savory spices/herbs and sweetness from the honey/apricots."

52weeksofcooking,3d2js5,kromyt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"Here is my experience with using bread flour in cookies...do not bake them same day. The texture always seems a bit off. I'm actually more a fan of using a mix of bread and all purpose, and then chilling the dough for at least 24 hours. The reason is, it gives the bread flour time to form the gluten strings that will give the resulting cookie that chew factor. When I've baked bread flour cookies the same day, they always have a graininess to them that can be unappealing.  If you still have dough left, try baking it tomorrow and then giving your final assessment."

A bit less soggy, a bit more delicious.... Still not perfect but definitely better than the first time around. I followed the recipe as was stated.  I think the beef made a difference. I used ""Chef’s Request 10-oz. Center Cut Beef in Bacon"". Delicious and tender. The bacon definitely did not hurt. :) The actual size of the meat was smaller, too, so easier to wrap up in the pastry without it cracking/breaking open. Also, I made sure the duxelle (the mushroom mixture) was drier (more liquid evaporated out in the pan) before I used them around the meat.  I still have work to do to make the perfect Wellington but this was a step in the right direction. I do not know much about Alton Brown (he is not one of the chef shows I frequently watch) but this recipe was pleasant. No complaints, Alton."

I'm not sure if it's because I have an electric stove instead of a gas one, but I pretty much knew that much beef broth was not going to reduce/thicken much in 12 minutes but I followed the instructions anyway, thinking maybe the sour cream and chevre would thicken it up. It did not. Next time I would use less broth and reduce it more.  The noodles are not Alton Brown, they are from King Arthur Flour. I have never made my own noodles before so I went with my most trusted recipe source. I always loved it when my mom made thick egg noodles for soup, so I didn't roll these as thin as suggested, but I really should have. I subbed in their traditional whole wheat flour and it worked great."

Tart, sweet, bubbly lemonade.  I was a little nervous about the basil in the syrup,  but this is a seriously delicious drink and would be sorely lacking without it.

Mix vinegar, salt, and sugar in a bowl, add water until fully dissolved.  Pack carrot and daikon in a big mason jar, pour mixture over the top, and add water until covered.  Refrigerate for at least 1 day and then eat whenever.    Banh Mi Assembly  Layer on the following on a french sub bun:  Pate  Semi-peeled cucumbers sliced on a bias  Meatballs  Some drained Carrot/Daikon mixture  Cilantro  Spicy Mayo  Eat immediately or wrap and chill.

This trip turned out to be one of my favorite trips that I've ever taken. While there, I ate at The Palace which is a historic bar that saw Wyatt Earp, his brothers Morgan and Virgil, and Doc Holliday. It burnt down in 1900 but not before the patrons carried the actual bar across the street to safety.  Anyway, it was at The Palace that I first tried Ranch Beans. And I loved them immediately. They were like baked beans, but spicy instead of sweet. They had chilies and tomatoes and everything else awesome.   Well, the hotel in which I stayed sold a cookbook that the State of Arizona put out. This recipe was in it. I now make this a few times a year, and I thank Arizona each time I take a bite.   2 lbs pinto beans  1 tsp salt  2 lg onions  3 cloves garlic; minced  1/2 tsp black pepper  1/2 tsp cumin  1 (4 oz) bottle taco sauce  1 (4 oz) can green chilies  1 (14.5) oz can diced tomatoes   Soak beans overnight. Drain; cover with water. Add salt and boil for 1 hour (adding water as necessary). Drain and add to large pot. Add onion, garlic, pepper, cumin, sauce, chillies, and tomatoes. Reduce heat and cover. Cook 1 hour 30 minutes. (I did mine in my slow cooker on high for 1 & 1/2 hours - got those beans nice and soft).    Mmm... spicy!"
52weeksofcooking,3c3g3x,jerzey516,2,Sat Jul 4 11:42:15 2015 UTC,"This is a Weight Watcher recipe but doesn't taste ""Weight Watcher-y"" at all... It was actually pretty delicious! It came from a Weight Watcher's Cookbook. I am not a huge pie fan, but this was warm, sweet and delicious! Not too heavy either. It was also the perfect pie for summer because of the peaches - that is one of my favorite summer fruits. I used frozen peaches for this, simply because I didn't have the time to slice up all the fresh peaches myself. Although it takes some time, this pie was easy to make and I will definitely be making it again. It is one of the few desserts I have made well! :)  Recipe:  Ingredients:  Pie Crust:   1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tsp sugar 1/8 tsp salt 2 tbsp cold unsalted butter, diced 2 tbsp cold vegetable shortening 1 tsp cider vinegar 3 – 3 ½ tbsp ice water   Filling:   3.5 lbs peaches, pitted and sliced (about 7 cups) – or 3 (16-oz.) bags of thawed frozen sliced peaches ¾ cup packed light brown sugar ½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground ginger 1 ½ tbsp cornstarch 1 tsp vanilla extract   Topping:   2/3 cups rolled oats ¼ cup all-purpose flour ½ cup packed light brown sugar ¼ tsp salt 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp water   Directions:  Pie Crust:   In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut the butter and shortening into the flour until the mixture resembles course crumbs.  Stir in the vinegar and then the water, 1 tbsp at a time until the dough begins to form. Press the dough together and shape into a disk.  Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.   Pie:   On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a 12- or 13-inch circle. Fit the dough into a 9-inch pie pan, pressing to fit and crimping the edges to form a rim.  Freeze 20 minutes. Prick the bottom with a fork. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. To prepare the filling, in a medium bowl, combine the peaches. Brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cornstarch, and vanilla extract. Toss well. Transfer to a pie shell. To prepare the topping, in a medium bowl, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, and salt. Add the butter, lemon juice, and water. Press the topping mixture together to form clumps, then break them into smaller pieces over the filling. Bake 40 minutes then tent loosely with aluminum foil to keep topping from over-browning.  Bake until the filling is thick and bubbly, 40-45 minutes longer."

52weeksofcooking,3bi4aw,jakevkline,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:20:18 2015 UTC,"My favorite picnic food has always been sandwiches, so I turned to Tom Colicchio’s sandwich book ‘Wichcraft.  I wanted a sandwich that could be served room temperature (like a picnic) and the Flatiron Steak Sandwich caught my eye.  The steak itself was very simple, salt & pepper and then seared on a cast iron pan.  It was topped with a little salad of julienned cucumber & ginger tossed with salt, pepper and lime juice.  Finally, there was a recipe for a homemade roasted chili mayo which added a nice creamy texture with a hint of spice.  We were all nervous about the slices of ginger but it was really mellowed out by the lime juice.  I also wanted to do a potato salad, but I really don’t like traditional potato salad.  I found this great recipe from Giada de Laurentis for a lemon-mustard potato salad.  Cooking the potatoes in the dressing made them extremely flavorful and topping it with the remaining dressing let the lemon flavor pop.  It also helped to coat the arugula and tied the whole dish together.  Finally, the cocktail was actually pretty easy to get to.  I asked a couple of people what they would drink at a picnic and literally everyone said “lemonade” without hesitation.  So, I made a grown-up version of lemonade, a Tom Collins.  I actually used a bit more club soda than this recipe called for and the result was a delicious, light, and infinitely drinkable cocktail.  This is definitely my new favorite gin drink (not hard, I’ve never been a huge gin fan--working on these cocktails has definitely improved my feelings about drinking gin)."

52weeksofcooking,3b8586,4_the_love_of_cheese,2,Fri Jun 26 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"Scotch Eggs are a very tasty treat, however due to their size they can be pretty hefty and quite filling. So to counter that and turn this amazing delicacy into a bite-sized appetizer, make them with Quail Eggs!  Quail eggs aren’t too hard to manage. They do have a thicker membrane than their chicken egg counterparts, but if you let them sit on the counter before cooking them, they are relatively easy to peel. To cook soft-boiled quail eggs, you bring a pot of water to a boil and then once you have a nice rolling boil going you place the eggs in and cook for 1 minute 30 seconds, then immediately place in an ice bath. The last time I did this they were perfect and deliciously runny! Last night when I cooked them I cooked them for a little over 2 minutes and while the yolk was still bright yellow, it didn’t have the same glorious runny yolk that I prefer, but cook them how you like!  Aside from getting the yolks right, I do struggle from time to time with the sausage. Sometimes the sausage doesn’t like to stay on the egg and will start to expand and separate. I haven’t figured out the trick yet, but I think I need to place a thicker coating of sausage on the eggs before frying them. I have been worried about not cooking the sausage all the way through, but I think I need to work on the heat of the oil and the thickness of the meat. I think an oil thermometer will help me out tremendously with this.  Also, the dipping sauce is amazing! I have decided to try to make a pasta using this sauce as the inspiration for the pasta sauce and using other aspects of this dish in the pasta also.  Bonus: Banana for scale!

52weeksofcooking,3b3jwz,lysanderish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:00:16 2015 UTC,I worked loosely off this recipe. The coffee is just regular old coffee in a tiny cup with some whipped cream. Someday I will make real cinnamon roles;  today is not that day.

It will form a nice, sticky meat dough. Form and put it on any leftover lemongrass or just some kebab sticks.  I put my satays on a grill for about 20 minutes, it really depends on how thick they're. And of course, don't forget to taste it before you grill them.  For the sambal:   Tomatoes Chili padi Scallion Garlic Keffir lime Fermented shrimp paste (terasi) Coconut oil   Just chop and mix everything. But well, I can't really say how much each of the ingredients. For this, you really have to feel and keep tasting the sambal.

I don't want to spend a bunch of time making identical, tiny versions of food I could make in a normal size with much less effort. Mini muffins are much more my speed.  We are getting the first zucchini out of our garden so I dusted off this favorite chocolate zucchini bread recipe and baked it in a mini muffin tin for about 15 minutes. I had a little batter left over so I also used my mini loaf pan to make three mini loaves. They are delicious, but dangerous, because it's easy to just pop another muffin in your mouth as you walk by. I ate three while doing the dishes afterwards."

My parents would not let me touch the stove at that age by myself and I really wanted to. I was a willful child. One night while my parents were watching the news I crept into the kitchen and flipped through a cookbook until I found a recipe that looked relatively easy. The only problem was that I didn't understand how to read the numbers and fractions on my mother's measuring jug. I started going to my dad and asking him ""how much is two cups?"" For every item in the recipe. But my dad was only half paying attention and wasn't giving me the right measurements. My jamjams were a mess that my mom had to try to fix. They turned out horrible and hard. They sat in the fridge for a week before being thrown out.  This is my first time making them since."

I wanted a little more biscuit to bacon ratio. Plus some areas where the bacon over lapped didn't get crispy. I might also try baking them, instead of frying.   I dipped them in spicy ketchup (ketchup plus sriracha), but ranch would probably also be pretty good. I felt like they do need a little something to cut the salty flavor."

The shell was a corn tortilla which I cut with a biscuit cutter and then split in half (to make it more pliable).  The base layer was refried beans with cumin, garlic, and Adobo sauce (from a can of chipotle peppers).  Next, I went with a Mexican street-corn flavor with lime and chili powder.  Finally, I used diced pot roast.  The meat was marinated overnight in onion, garlic and chipotle peppers and was slowcooked with Rotel, tomatoes, and beef stock.  These were assembled in a mini muffin pan and baked at 350 for about 10 minutes.  They were delicious and with an assembly line, it was not too time consuming to put them all together.   For the cocktail, I was looking for a shooter that wasn't too disgusting to get down.  Also, Scooby Snack was such a hilarious name for a cocktail that I couldn't resist.  Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I'm not going to rush to make another one, but the different components balanced each other out and it was drinkable, if not awesome."

Perhaps my affection for this dish has made me lazy, but when I hover over my stove top, I am taken back to a time where I stood upon a chair, spatula in hand. And I smile.    You see, I have a 14 month old daughter who is beginning to take an interest in flavors - albeit, they can't be too flavorful as she will spit foods out and thrown them to the floor. So the foods I share with her must be simple enough to not overwhelm her undeveloped taste buds (though she does seem to enjoy my coffee. Hmmm...).   Anyway,  no, I didn't let her help me make it, and, again, no, she won't remember this as a first food just yet. But someday.  So, I'll keep making my 2 egg omelets with a splash of milk and 2 slices of Kraft American Cheese, and someday, maybe, she'll think back on this overtly simplistic food with all of the nostalgia with which I regard my own long-gone childhood.

It was fun in a way that I've not really experienced much since starting grad school.  Anyway, I followed this recipe from Saveur, though like some of the comments suggested I reduced the amount of sugar.  I also made sweet potato fries as a side by slicing a sweet potato into batons, coating in olive oil, salt, and pepper, then baking on tinfoil at 350 until they seemed sufficiently cooked."

Not it because it ""tastes the best ever"" but because every time I eat it, it gives me the feeling of ""comfort"", ""family"" and ""home"".  My grandparents on my mom's side came from Calabria, Italy - my grandma came over when she was six years old. Growing up, we always had a big Sunday dinner at around 3 p.m. with the whole family where Grandma Nancy made a huge pot of ""gravy' (aka red tomato sauce), meatballs, neckbones, sausage, hard-boiled eggs, and a salad (which you ate after the spaghetti). My grandma has since passed but now my mom makes the gravy occasionally. The memories of those Sundays are such a happy, warm memory from my childhood.  The gravy has to simmer all day - at least 5 or 6 hours. The neckbones and the homemade meatballs are cooked right inside the gravy. These are just some of the secrets of Grandma Nancy's gravy!"

52weeksofcooking,3agyf7,Apocalypse-Cow,2,Sat Jun 20 15:13:12 2015 UTC,"One of the earliest food memories for me. I pretty much grew up on this, made by my mom and grandma."
52weeksofcooking,3agyf7,Apocalypse-Cow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:01:45 2015 UTC,Nice. I like to see this sort of thing. One of my first food memories is of my grandmother making me over medium eggs smashed into a paste with the back of a fork and then mixed with buttered grits. I still mash my eggs into my grits to this day.
52weeksofcooking,3afm4l,4_the_love_of_cheese,3,Fri Jun 19 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"When I started to cook, one of the first things I remember making was pasta. At the time it seemed so easy: boil pasta, add sauce or butter, and done! But as I’ve gotten older I realized there is more to pasta than I originally thought!  Adding salt and a bit of olive oil to the pasta? Makes the flavor of the pasta stand out and helps prevent sticking! Tired of canned or jarred sauces? Making your own is super easy and tastes way better! Butternut squash and dried cranberries with goat cheese in a pasta? Why not!  For this week, I decided to share a recipe of my own for a shrimp and sugar snap pea pasta, along with a strawberry dish that I love (if you like strawberry basil lemonade, you will definitely love these!)! Hope you enjoy!    Recipes:  Shrimp and Sugar Pea Pasta (Serves 2)   4 oz Linguine Pasta, Boiled 1/4 tsp Oil - Olive 1/4 tsp Oil - chili  1 shallot, diced 1 clove Garlic, minced 1/2 pepper Red Bell Pepper, diced 1/4 lb Fresh Sugar Snap Peas 1/4 tsp corn starch 1/4 cup Wine - Table, white 1/4 tsp Spices, paprika 12 medium, Raw Medium Shrimp 1/4 tsp corn starch 1/2 tsp Lemon juice 1/2 tsp Butter - Salted 1 tsp Basil, fresh    Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the linguini. Should cook in 8-10 minutes. Once finished, drain pasta and reserve 2 Tbsp of pasta water. In your pan, heat up olive and chili oil on a medium heat. Cook shallot and garlic in the oil until softened and aromatic (about 3 minutes). Add in the bell pepper and peas to the pan, and continue cooking until peas start to soften. Then remove everything from the pan. Add wine to the pan and reduce down a bit. Combine the corn starch and reserved pasta water until the starch is dissolved, and then add to the wine along with the paprika. Add dhrimp to the pan and cook until pink. Mix vegetables back into the pan, Remove from heat and add in the pasta, butter, lemon juice, and basil to the pan. Stir around until everything is coated and the butter melts. Serve and enjoy!   Lemon Basil Strawberries (Serves 4-6)   1 lb Strawberries, raw, sliced 1 tbsp Sugar White 1/8 tsp Salt, table 2 tsp Balsamic Vinegar 1 tsp lemon juice 2 Tbsp basil, chiffonade    In a bowl, combine strawberries, salt, and sugar. Set aside. In another bowl, combine the balsamic, lemon juice, pepper, and basil. Once mixed, pour into bowl with the strawberries and toss to coat."

52weeksofcooking,3acwkw,TriGurl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:18:21 2015 UTC,"The sauce is made by cooking a shot of dry white wine, chopped garlic, capers, and the juice of half a lemon until it reduces. Whisk in 5 tbsps of butter until it emulsifies and add pepper to taste. I strain it, but you could leave the solids in if you choose."

52weeksofcooking,3aagq3,mofish1,6,Thu Jun 18 14:48:36 2015 UTC,"Way back in the day when I was in preschool, all the kids looked forward to the days that we had Benjis for lunch.  The preschool had a rule that if you wanted seconds of something, you had to clean your plate first, and I think that rule only existed to force kids to choke down canned beets, which were ONLY served on Benjis days.  I remember this injustice well, and that is why this is the first food I have a distinct memory of.  I have no idea why they are called Benjis, because it is mashed potatoes creamed with cottage cheese, with hot dogs mixed in.    Edit:  I still don't eat beets.  My mother actually worked at that preschool part time for a while in the kitchen, and she had saved the recipe for me, but of course I had to jazz it up a bit.    Original Recipe:  12servings worth Instant mashed potatoes  1 pkg hot dogs cut up  1big container small curd cottage cheese  Milk for potatoes as needed  Boil water for 10 to 12 servings potatoes  Add cottage cheese to water to melt it  Add potatoes-there will be cottage cheese lumps still  Stir and add as much milk as you need to make creamy  Add hot dogs  Stir  Add salt as needed!  What I did  5lbs russet potatoes, peeled and quartered  1 big container small curd cottage cheese (its like 22 or 24oz, cant recall)  1/2 stick butter  1pkg beef hot dogs  Milk as necessary (I didnt need any)   Boil potatoes in lightly salted water until tender, drain Cook hot dogs in skillet or griddle until browned all over, cut into 1/4"" thick coins Put cottage cheese into a big pot and get it hot, but not boiling. Using potato ricer, Rice potatoes into hot cottage cheese and stir to combine Add hot dogs, stir Add salt and pepper to taste, add milk if the potatoes are too thick.  Stir in some parsley if you have it, top with chives if you want."

52weeksofcooking,3a8i5c,emu1,2,Thu Jun 18 01:47:37 2015 UTC,"This was the first dish I made for myself in college, when I realized I needed to learn to cook. It's super simple, and really delicious.  Here's the basic recipe:   Boil water for the linguini, and in the meantime, mince 4 cloves of garlic and dice 2 tomatoes. Add the linguini to your pot and cook. While it's cooking, heat some olive oil in a pan over medium heat, then add the garlic. About a minute later, add the tomatoes. Let the tomatoes cook down a little and soak up the garlicky flavor. When the tomatoes are soft, add a whole bag of fresh spinach to the pan and let it cook down. Once the pasta is al dente, strain and put it in a large mixing bowl. Add the contents of the pan. While the pasta and veggies are still hot, crumble about a third of a block of feta on top, and stir until the feta begins to melt. Ta-da! Awesome dinner in 20 minutes."

52weeksofcooking,3a43bu,UsurpedSatan,3,Wed Jun 17 01:56:10 2015 UTC,Recipe and how to?
52weeksofcooking,3a43bu,UsurpedSatan,3,Wed Jun 17 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"So the basic essence is this: You make flat shortbread/sugar cookies, bake them for about 10 minutes (just long enough that they're stable but can take a little more time). As they cool, you make peanut butter cookie dough. When the sugar cookies are cool, you scoop a little bit of jam into the center (we used raspberry) and you form the peanut butter cookie dough over the top like a little lid. Bake for about 10 more minutes until the peanut butter cookie is cooked.   Then they must cool, this is essential for safe and easy consumption.   The double baked sugar/shortbread cookie makes a nice crisp toast base for the gooey jelly and soft peanut butter dough.   They are very, very rich. And very, very good.   I have specific recipes but they're at home and I'm at work. I'll post them later today :)  Edit: more sentences."
52weeksofcooking,3a3on3,gastronomad,4,Tue Jun 16 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"Fried egg is one of the earliest things I cooked and still one of my favorites with some good olive oil and fresh bread. The beaten egg with sugar is one of my earliest food memories, I am sure the sugar and great texture and rich taste has something to do with it. It's a very common kids snack around the Meditarranean, perhaps its most famous version is the Jeweish kogel-mogel. You beat an egg yolk by hand with a spoon in a cup with a couple of tablespoons of sugar until it gets very creamy, pale white and you don't see sugar granules anymore. You can add flavorings too, my favorite was cocoa. If you are concerned about raw eggs use eggs from pastured chickens (naturally grown) or the pasteurized kind."

52weeksofcooking,39zrmb,jakevkline,3,Tue Jun 16 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"This week, I wanted to take the first thing my wife and I cooked and update and elevate them.  For me, it was the chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have been making since I was a kid.  I was watching The Kitchen and they made ice cream sandwiches out of cookies.  I did the same thing, putting vanilla ice cream between the cookies and then rolling the edge through some chopped peanuts.  These were delicious but definitely needed some more ice cream in the middle.  The first thing my wife remembers making was Kraft Mac 'n' Cheese.  I was definitely not going to be making this and serving it to everyone for Sunday dinner, so I decided to make a cast iron version of the Alton Brown oven-baked recipe.  I made some changes, however.  I cooked some bacon in the pan and used a little of the residual grease in the pan to keep the food from sticking (and crumbled the bacon into the sauce).  I also tossed a few handfuls of parmesan cheese on top, which was a nice added flavor.  Because my brother's girlfriend is gluten-free, I also made a GF version of the recipe which also turned out great.  Finally, the first cocktail memory I have is of my dad making me my very first cocktail, a Manhattan. This is the drink that first got me interested in cocktails and mixology.  I went with the recipe in my Death and Co. book and it is the best version I have ever had.  I made it with Bulleit Rye and it was exceptionally well balanced.  In terms of presentation, I have been trying to get these ice balls to work and finally managed to get it right.  I froze the spheres for 3.5 hours before sucking out the insides, left them for two days, and put the martini glasses and the syringes of Manhattan in the freezer as well.   You can't tell from the picture, but there is also a maraschino cherry (real maraschino cherries, like these ones are actually incredibly delicious) inside the sphere."

But instead, I decided to go for a dish that I tried when first married to surprise my spouse.  I knew that he liked sweet and sour pork because he ate it at the Chinese restaurant that we frequented back then.  So, I searched through my Betty Crocker cookbook and found a recipe.  I made a list and went to the store.  When it came to buying the pork, I was confused.  There were so many pork products !!!  So I settled on ham.  Well, ham is pork, isn't it?  I think you can imaging the rest of the story!  This recipe is easy and delicious.  The sauce is sweet and sour without being sticky sweet.  I pounded the pork cubes with a meat mallet prior to dusting with flour and frying.  Very, very nice dish."
52weeksofcooking,39z9b2,mofish1,2,Tue Jun 16 00:19:10 2015 UTC,Sweet and sour ham could work!  But with a recipe that called for regular pork it probably came out super salty

I ate tuna salad on Triscuits everyday for lunch during Elementary School.  One of my first memories of food is the year my mom decided to put Jax Cheese Doodles inside my Easter Eggs because I didn't like candy. I remember the day so well and it was before my brother was born so I was younger than 4. I ate only cheese doodles that day.  Another early memory of food is having my dad order the large chinese food dish of sauteed vegetables, and picking out all the baby corn for myself. ONLY the baby corn. It's too cute not to devour!

52weeksofcooking,39ptbo,jerzey516,2,Sat Jun 13 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"Recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/portuguese-paella-226218  Meh. Such a disappointing recipe. I felt so let down after making this because I was so looking forward to making this - my first time making paella of any kind.  The flavors were great together (and so the dish has the potential to be delicious and awesome), but the way the recipe is written, the cook times are way off, at least for not using a paella pan. The shrimp needs more time cooking than 5 -10 minutes and the arborio rice needs wayyyy more cook time. The comments below the recipe also said this, so I know I am not alone in this assessment. I wish I had read the comments on the recipe before I made it.  I think next time, I would actually maybe cook the arborio rice separately until it is all-the-way cooked or almost all-the-way cooked. The way this recipe states, the rice came out literally raw in the dish. Crunchy and hard. And none of the liquid was absorbed. Gross for rice. I was afraid this would happen, and it did. I also didn't use a paella pan, I used a normal pan, so I think this affected the situation. Next time, I would just cook the rice separately and then add.  I used linguica (Portuguese pork sausage) for the chorizo, which was nice. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs so I could cut them up and mix them into the paella. This was just a matter of personal preference.  This dish got me down. I'd be kicked off Top Chef (one of my fave shows) immediately for this dish due to the raw, crunchy arborio rice. My husband wants me to try it again one day with the tweaks to conquer the dish.  Perhaps I will."

All in all, it's usually about an hour to make. But I also use a 15"" paella pan. Not sure how it would change things without one"

52weeksofcooking,39c4b7,4_the_love_of_cheese,3,Wed Jun 10 19:37:50 2015 UTC,"This was the perfect theme for me, so thank you! Once every month or two, I have been picking a different country to ""visit"" by cooking a week's worth of dinner from that country. Because of the theme this week I went ahead and am doing an entire week of Portuguese cooking! So to start off this week of cooking I made some Arroz de Polvo Malandrinho (Octopus Rice) and Grilled Sardines; delicious!  When looking into Portuguese food I saw that they use a lot of seafood, particularly sardines and salted cod, so I knew I had to include those ingredients. Plus I have recently become infatuated with sardines, so I was all for trying out this meal.  The sardines are simple and great; just gut, debone, oil with olive oil, and then salt and grill. Takes about 3-4 minutes on each side once on the grill. Then place on some toasted bread and voila! The sardines cooked this way actually tasted more like tuna fish from a can which was interesting. I want to do this again, but include the chermoula from Morocco as a stuffing/marinade (chermoula recipe included below) because that filling is amazing!  As for the Octopus rice, the recipe only called for large octopus, however the store only had 1 left when I went shopping, so I decided to try to add baby octopus to the dish as well. Bad idea. The baby octopus, while great on their own, are too dense and chewy for this dish. Whereas the octopus legs from the larger one when cooked and chopped, are tender and the perfect texture for this simple peasant dish. And while the house did smell quite fishy by the time I was done, the food itself surprisingly did not which was great. Serve with a side of olives and you have yourself a terrific meal to eat!

52weeksofcooking,39c4b7,Jericho443,2,Wed Jun 10 19:38:04 2015 UTC,A very important question: can you prepare sardines and not end up eating any bones? If so PLEASE tell me how! I have given up on this ingredient.
52weeksofcooking,39c4b7,momma_dukes,2,Wed Jun 10 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is slice open the belly, gut them, and then open them enough to pinch the spine and pull it out. Then I spend time pulling out any of the remaining bones I can see still hanging on. It is pretty messy this way but I end up getting most of the bones out, and the few that remain you don't end up finding them after you cook them (at least I haven't noticed them like I do with other fish). That is how I prepared these fish in the picture.  Usually when I make sardines, I cook without the head and tail on too and when I do that it is much easier to open up to gut and debone. You just slice off the head and tail and then open them up. It may take practice, but it can be done! You will just have a messier looking fish, but messier doesn't mean less tasty! ;)"

52weeksofcooking,39angu,mofish1,4,Wed Jun 10 13:32:47 2015 UTC,"These little fish croquettes are really good, and you don't need to have actual salt cod (I didnt want to wait 10 days to make my own).  In the spirit of clearing stuff out of my freezer, I made a few adaptations that worked out really well in the end.  This is the base recipe I used, with a few changes.  I used yellow fleshed potatoes instead of idaho potatoes, and just regular cod loins from my freezer instead of salt cod.  I seasoned the cod well with salt and pepper, dropped into a ziploc bag and sealed with water displacement method, and put it into a 145F water bath for 1hr.  It flaked very easily and had bag juices leftover.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in a pan with some olive oil until the onions had softened, and then deglazed with the bag juices, and swirled in a tablespooon of butter.  From there on out it was as the recipe stated.    Tomato rice was:  1.5cup dry jasmine rice  14oz can diced tomatoes  1/2 onion, diced  2 cloves garlic, minced  2tbsp-ish chopped cilantro  2tbsp-ish chopped parsley  2cups beef broth  Bay leaf  2tbsp olive oil  1tbsp butter  S&P to taste  Sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil/butter until soft, added rice and toasted, dropped that mixture and everything else into a rice cooker and pressed the white rice button, and walked away.  Once it was done, seasoned to taste with S&P and it was delicious."

Francesinha was supposedly invented in the 1960s by Daniel da Silva, a returned emigrant who worked in a local restaurant (""A Regaleira""), while trying to adapt the croque-monseur, French sandwich, to Portuguese taste.

I had such a plethora of recipes in mind that I didn't know what the heck to make (torresmos, pao doce, rice pudding, kale soup, fava beans...so many great foods from my childhood)  Sopas are a specialty of the Azores served during the festival of the holy spirit (the 7th Sunday after Easter). It's a great, flavorful meal originally used to feed the poor (since it's bread soup with meat and vegetables).  I used this recipe as my basis since I never thought to learn how to make it when my grandmother was still alive. It was good, though not a soupy as hers (my fault probably for doing tomato paste instead of tomato sauce)...and we don't have any shallow bowls so it would have been very difficult to eat anyway. It was still good though.  Couple other changes I made: the store didn't have any bone-in chuck roast, so I ended up using a boneless one and throwing in some pork neck bones I had in the freezer. I sear the meat first, which this recipe does not call for, but which makes everything better.  Serve with a soft Portuguese, Italian or French bread and lots of fresh mint.

We practically lived on Portuguese food.  Since the Portuguese are famous for their fishing skills, many of the coastal dishes include food from the sea.

Cook until lightly brown.  Add onions, carrots, celery and bell pepper and cook until soft.  Add Linguica, fennel,  and leeks and cook on medium heat  for two minutes.   Add garlic and cook for one minute.  Add vermouth and allow to reduce for a few minutes.  Add tomatoes through potatoes and simmer, uncovered for 15 minutes.  Add parsley, clams and mussels and cover for 3 minutes.  Add cod and simmer, covered, for 3 minutes.  (At this point, care should be used while stirring so as not to break up the fish.)

52weeksofcooking,3914ci,jakevkline,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"My entrance into the world of Portuguese food was My Portugal by George Mendes.  The images in this book are stellar and the explanations are great.  I found this great Vinho Verde marinated grilled pork recipe in the book and it was really delicious.  I used pork loin instead of tenderloin and they turned out great.  I also made Piri Piri, the Portuguese national hot sauce, to go with the meal.  To go with the whole menu, I also made Portuguese Sweet Bread.  I have not had a lot of success with doughs in the past so I got my dad to help me walk through this and it turned out great.  The kitchen smelled delicious and the result was like a slightly-sweet challah.  Turning to the cocktail, initially all I could find was recipes using port.  I am not the biggest fan of port, so I was looking for something else.  Once I found the pork recipe, and its use of vinho verde, I did a little reading into what exactly vinho verde is.  Apparently, it is made from grapes picked very young and has a very nice hint of effervescence. I found this great sangria recipe which was specifically meant to use and highlight the characteristics of vinho verde.  This made a really gorgeous looking sangria which was delicious and unusual and I will definitely be making it again in the future."

When hot, add onions.  Cook for 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Add garlic and cook for another 5 minutes or until veggies are brown. Place nachos down on a plate (1/3 bag per plate) Place shredded beef brisket on top of nachos Place beans on top of brisket Place caramelized onions and garlic on top of beans. Place shredded lettuce on top of garlic and onions.  Place cheese sauce on top of lettuce. Sprinkle cilantro on top of the dish.   Hot damn!! This dish... I have been trying to eat healthy lately but this was a clear break from the healthy eating and it was so worth it. Nachos are my guilty pleasure whenever I go out to restaurants and I absolutely love the variety of textures and the strong flavors well-made nachos can bring. This dish was probably one of the best nacho dishes I have ever tasted (and I like to think of myself as a nacho connoisseur).  Although I am not a sports fan, I feel like this dish would be the perfect indulgence to munch on while watching sports. Kudos to the AT&T Center (home of the San Antonio Spurs) for creating the perfect nacho dish. This Jersey girl is impressed."

All in all, I definitely did not fail at either of those this week!   The brisket was amazing! Marinated for over 24 hours in the fridge, and then five hours of slow cooking in the oven with beer, some leftover marinade, and onions stuck on the sides. The entire house smelled amazing yesterday, so that was a plus! We topped the sandwiches with horseradish, BBQ sauce, the onions from the cooking phase, and a jalapeno/cayenne pepper cheddar cheese.  The onion rings came out way better then they did the last time I made them, and I believe it had to do with a simple step I have never done before: after coating the onions in the batter, I let them drip on a rack for a bit so they could dry a little and get rid of all of the excess batter which allowed the breadcrumbs to stay on better. The onions came out tender and juicy, and the breading stayed on better than I could have imagined! If you are looking for an onion ring recipe, definitely check out the one I used for this week. If I can do it, so can you!    Recipe:  Bangin' Smokey Beef Brisket  Old Fashioned Onion Rings"

If you have a gas stove, put a pepper on the fire directly for a minute it so until there are black crackles on the skin.

52weeksofcooking,38dn4z,mofish1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:12:31 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to clear out my freezer this week, and I had 4 1lb vacuum bags, 2 of smoked pulled beef, and 2 of smoked pulled pork (from the BBQ week).  I grabbed the 2 beef and one of the pork, and set to making the sauce.  I used this recipe for the sauce, minus the oxtails and chuck obviously.  I only had dried mulato chilis, so I used 3 of those.  Dumped the frozen meat and the sauce into a dutch oven, brought to a boil, put the lid slightly ajar, and then put the concoction into a 350F oven for about an hour.  Scraped down the sides and stirred it all together, put it on the stovetop on med-high and cooked it until the sauce was thick.    The BBQ beef and pork worked surprisingly well in this dish, it added a really nice smokey flavor and a touch of sweetness from the pork bark.    Cilantro lime rice is simple, use chicken broth or chicken boullion mixed with water instead of plain water when cooking rice in the rice cooker.  I have a $30 Aroma rice cooker that does a great job.  Once the rice is done, mix in chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice, and salt to taste.  I'd say for 2C dry jasmine rice, I used the juice of one medium lime, about 2TBSP packed chopped cilantro, and about 1/2tsp kosher salt.  Pile your meat, rice, cheese, and whatever else you want into a fritos bag and chow down.  Also good for just tacos, or bowls, or whatever you want."

So I made this for ground meat instead.   This is a cottage pie with a curried filling.  That is to say,  the filing is flavored with a Rogan Josh curry sauce.  Since I doubted being able to find it in the store,  I made the sauce from scratch using Julia Child's recipe. The only real deviation I made while cooking was to add a little half and half to the potatoes.   This is really good.  If you have the opportunity, you should definitely make this."

52weeksofcooking,382u9u,jakevkline,4,Mon Jun 1 13:25:46 2015 UTC,"For the food this week, I wanted to do a spin on burgers and fries.  I decided to try out Beer Can Burgers after watching this video.  I made 4 beef burgers and 4 pork burgers, each with 1/2 pound of ground meet.  I put the hole into them and wrapped them in bacon, and then filled them with one of 4 toppings/stuffings.  The beef burgers got either red bell pepper and caramelized onions or chorizo, potato and onion. The pork burgers got either pineapple and bacon or cream cheese and Hatch chilis.  They were all then topped with a slice of pepper jack.  All the filling was cooked ahead of time and then the burgers were smoked at 250 for about an hour.  They were moist, flavorful, and incredibly delicious.  I also served the left-over filling on the side in case people wanted extra.  I opted to just slice them into quarters instead of serving on buns because the burgers were around 1.25 inches thick.  For the fries, I decided to try something I saw a week or so ago on The Kitchen (One of my favorite cooking shows.  I highly recommend you all check it out), Polenta Fries. Because my brother's girlfriend can't tolerate gluten, and because polenta starts off gluten-free, I decided to use gluten-free flour so that she could eat these.  Other than that, I made them exactly according to the recipe and the sauce as well.  They were incredibly delicious right off the fryer but the texture got a little weird after they cooled and sat for a bit.  I wouldn't recommend making them for a large party but for something where you can serve it right away, they were delicious and quite different.  For the cocktail this week, the first thing that came to me was the concession-stand bar windows type things all over downtown New Orleans.  These places are serving daiquiris (which I made a few weeks ago already) and Hurricanes.  Since we were having a party, I opted to make a large pitcher of these and since this is a New Orleans cocktail, Emeril's recipe seemed to be the way to go.  These were great because I made them a bit less sweet than most of the street-Hurricanes you get out there and the tart and bitter passion fruit juice flavor came through nicely."

52weeksofcooking,380tx7,mofish1,3,Mon Jun 1 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"This week I wanted to get kinda weird with my experiments, and they turned out surprisingly good!  My favorite version was the Dae Ji Bulgogi/Gochujang Hollandaise, would definitely make again.  The sous vide tea eggs worked well, but were difficult to peel when soft boiled since they werent as firm as hardboiled.    Recipes and whatnot below:  Dae Ji Bulgogi  I followed the ingredients on this page except using belly of course, and grilled it in my cheapo grill basket on a weber kettle.  Took closer to 4-5mins per side, since belly has much more fat to render off.    The second batch I went without the grill basket (and also most of the onions by proxy) and cooked it straight on the grill, since the basket handle was preventing me from closing the lid and the extra air was causing flare ups from all the fat.    Steam buns recipe  This is adapted from the momofuku recipe to use weight instead of volume and worked pretty well.  1tbsp plus 1tsp active dry yeast (~12g)  340g water  512g bread flour +40g extra added during mixing, dough was too wet  75g sugar  75g lard, room temp  16g powdered milk  1tbsp kosher salt (~13g)  rounded 1/2tsp baking powder (~3g)  1/2tsp baking soda (~3g)   Combine the yeast and water in the bowl of a stand mixer outfitted with the dough hook. Add the flour, sugar, milk powder, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and fat and mix on the lowest speed possible, just above a stir, for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should gather together into a neat, not-too-tacky ball on the hook. When it does, lightly oil a medium mixing bowl or proofing cambro, put the dough in it, and cover the bowl with a dry kitchen towel. Put it in a turned-off oven with a pilot light or other warmish place and let rise until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a clean work surface. Take off 50g chunks of dough and roll each piece into a ball, and place on a greased baking sheet. Cover the dough balls with a draping of plastic wrap and allow them to rest and rise for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut out 25 or so 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Coat a chopstick with whatever fat you’re working with. Flatten one ball with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 4-inch-long oval. Lay the greased chopstick across the middle of the oval and fold the oval over onto itself to form the bun shape. Withdraw the chopstick, leaving the bun folded, and put the bun on a square of greased parchment paper. Stick it back under the plastic wrap and form the rest of the buns. Let the buns rest for 30mins. Set up your steamer (I used electric). Working in batches so you don’t crowd the steamer, steam the buns on the parchment squares for 10 minutes. Remove the parchment. You can use the buns immediately (reheat them for a minute or so in the steamer if necessary) or allow to cool completely, then seal in plastic freezer bags and freeze for up to a few months. Reheat frozen buns in a steamer for 2 to 3 minutes, until puffy, soft, and warmed all the way through.   Sous Vide ""Poached"" Chinese Tea Eggs  6 eggs  2 black tea bags  2c water  1/2c soy sauce  2tbsp sugar  2 whole star anise  1 cinnamon stick  8 cloves  1/2tsp black peppercorns  1/2tsp sichuan peppercorns  3-4pieces citrus peel  Put everything except eggs and tea in a saucepan and bring to a boil, add tea, remove from heat, and set aside.    Poke holes in the bottoms of the eggs with a thumbtack, this prevents them from cracking.  Bring pot of water to boil, add eggs and cook for exactly 3 minutes.  Remove to a bowl of iced water immediately to shock cool.  Once cooled, crack all over with the back of a butter knife or spoon.  Put eggs and tea mixture in a bag and store in fridge overnight.  Heat water bath to 143F and put bag with eggs and tea in it.  Cook for 45-50mins depending on how long it takes for ambient tea mixture to reach 143F.    Chashu Pork  Mine was leftover from when I made tonkatsu ramen a while back, but it was this recipe, though I cooked it sous vide for a couple days, sorry but I cannot recall the temperature/time exactly, I want to say around 150F/2days.    Edit:  Realized I forgot about the hollandaise.  Hollandaise Infusions  I used this method of making hollandaise, but used lime juice instead.  I split the resulting delicious hollandaise in half.  In one half I mixed in about 1TBS of Hoisin sauce, and in the other I mixed in about 1TBS of Gochujang.  You can just add it to your taste preference, and then serve immediately."

So this morning, before breakfast, I asked my husband what I could do to mix 2 types of food together for breakfast.   His suggestions were disgusting.   I knew I wanted to make something French, and I just kept coming back to Southern food. So, I looked in the fridge to see what I had.   BBQ pulled pork... 2 eggs... Milk...  Yikes. What could I possibly make? Pancakes aren't french...But crepes are!   I had never made a crepe before, so I looked up a quick recipe and cut it in 4 (I didn't need 8 crepes). Anyway, here goes:  1/2 c flour  1 egg  1/4 c milk  1/4 c water  1/8 tsp salt  1 tbsp butter, melted  Whisk together the flour and egg; slowly add the milk and water, and whisk until smooth. Stir in the salt and butter.   Spray a small saute pan with cooking spray and heat to medium-high. Do this with a second saute pan on a different burner.   In 1st pan, once heated, add half of crepe mixture. Move pan around to coat the sides of the pan. Let cook for about 2 minutes. At same time, add egg to 2nd heated pan.   After 2 minutes, flip crepe and egg. Allow both to cook for another minute. (This is when I microwaved about an oz of pulled pork and covered it in my homemade BBQ sauce).   Put the crepe on a plate, top it with pork, fold to close. Top that with the egg and some BBQ sauce.   This was intensely delicious (though my crepe was a bit too thick). There was enough batter to make 2 crepes."

52weeksofcooking,378xfd,jakevkline,3,Mon May 25 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"This is going to be a long writeup.  For this week, I was taken by the idea to do a variety of tacos from different cuisines around the world and to pair them with a cocktail from that same country.  Each taco consisted of a chicken recipe and a sauce/spread to go with it.    First, I decided it was time to try my hand at making Jerk Chicken.  I went with this recipe because it had such a wide variety of spices that it seemed like it would produce a fun, delicious crust.  It did, though I was unable to really get the habanero peppers spread throughout and would probably just make the hot sauce from the recipe which had the mango chutney (this page has a recipe for jerk chicken but I preferred the spice-heavy recipe from the other one).  This was a very balanced chutney without a strong fruity flavor.  Second, I wanted to try exploring a Moroccan recipe which I found in Steve Raichlen's Planet Barbecue which used cilantro, mint, turumeric and cumin as a marinade.  It was incredibly delicious and I served it with harissa, a North-African pepper paste.  This was not as spicy as I hoped for, but could be kicked up a bit with hotter chilies.  Finally, for those with a more mild palate, I made Greek tacos which were simple and delicious.  I served them with this tzatziki which called for mint, a very nice touch I thought.  For the cocktails, I finally got to break out my beer flight set.  Since I was making tacos, I started with a Mexican cocktail (left).  I made an El Diablo which tasted a bit like a margarita but with more fruit because of the cassis.  For the next one, I made a Greek Lightning.  This was originally a recipe for a shot and I would recommend leaving it in that volume.  It is hard to get through that much ouzo when sipping.  The next drink was my favorite, a Moroccan star anise and cinnamon cocktail.  This was light and refreshing and the infused simple syrup I made for it was absolutely delicious.  Finally, on the right was the Jamaican cocktail, Planter's Punch.  This is a drink which has come to be associated with South Carolina, but originates in Jamaica.  It is also one of the cocktails which has an IBA official recipe, so that is the version I made.  It was tasty, but not something I am in a rush to make again."

Well, it took me until Sunday evening, but I figured it out. Two weeks from now is Week 23: Concession Foods. This girl is making Coney Island Chili Cheese Dogs. In order to make Coney Island Chili Dogs, one needs chili. Hence Week 21: Ground Meat.   The plan is to freeze it; thaw it; cook it; enjoy it.  Here's the recipe:  1 lb ground beef  1/2 large onion, diced  2 cloves garlic, minced  1 tbsp sugar  1 tbsp yellow mustard  1 tbsp dried, minced onion  2 tsp chili powder  1 tsp Worcestershire sauce  1 tsp salt  1/2 tsp celery salt  1/2 tsp ground cumin  1/4 tsp ground black pepper  1/4 tsp cayenne pepper  1 (8oz) can tomato sauce  1 tbsp tomato puree  1 c water  Brown beef with onion.

It was a meal-in-one with veggies, carbs, and proteins all in a lettuce wrap and the sauce was really nice-tasting. It was not difficult to make. It also had tofu in it, which I enjoy with the right sauce.  The mixture was very textured and thus the lettuce leaves weren't very strong, so the whole wrap process didn't work. Instead, we just served the filling on a bed of a lettuce leaf.   Not as beautiful as most lettuce wraps dishes you see, and definitely not as delicate, but the flavors made me happy!

For the turkey burger: 1 1/3 pound package ground turkey + 1 golden delicious apple (minced) + 1 white onion (minced) + 2 stalks celery (minced) + 1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning. Salt and pepper as desired. Form into 4 patties and allow to chill for about an hour.

These have simple ingredients that can be easily modified to contain just about whatever you want.    This is the recipe I used.  I think that next time I might put in some finely grated carrot and a touch more salt.  A little mirin in the dipping sauce also opened it up nicely. Kenji's video on shaping the gyoza was immensely helpful.  If you pan fry them like I did, make sure you use enough oil to get a nice even browning on the bottom.  Also make sure to keep them moving in the pan, swirling them around at least once every 20-30 seconds.  After the steaming step they need even more swirling, I found.  And in between batches make sure you scrub the extra starch off of your pan or you'll end up frying your next batch in a sort of gyoza-roux."

I have been trying to find a meatball recipe that is easy to make, very tasty, and something I would want to cook again and again, and I believe I found it with this recipe!  The meatballs are made with half ground veal, and then the other half is made of equal parts ground beef and pork. Well, that’s not how it is listed in the recipe, but that is how I made them! Having the majority of the meatball made with veal, it added a very rich and buttery flavor that you just don’t see with ground beef or pork. But the beef and pork are equally as important as they help give and maintain the meatball’s shape while it cooks.   To construct the sub, we spread homemade marinara sauce (the thicker the better for these I believe) on bread, placed a chiffonade of basil on the sauce, sliced the meatballs and placed them in the sub, and then topped with mozzarella and provolone cheese. Then I took my shiny new blow torch and melted the cheese right on top of the meatballs. If you are looking for a new meatball recipe to try, you should try this one!    Recipe:  The Best Meatballs"

I started poking around and found two different recipes I thought were interesting enough to try.  First, I found this bacon cheeseburger fatty.  I was especially intrigued by this one because it would give me an excuse to learn how to make a bacon weave/latice.  It turns out, this is surprisingly easy.  I followed these instructions (Steve Raichlan is a BBQ god) and it was really great.  The fatty was a little one-note, but it was very tasty and a real hit.  The second one was this poblano-cream cheese fatty.  This was a real show stopper and the mix of roasted poblanos and the pork was truly delightful.  Overall, I can't wait to try out some more things like this, and the swineapple is high on my list of novelty BBQ foods to try.  Turning to the cocktail, I was stuck with a bit of a conundrum.  I really wanted to use my molecular mixology kit to make a bunch of red cocktail caviar with a few white ones mixed in to simulate ground meat visually, but my wife but the kibosh on that one as soon as I suggested it.  Instead, I went with a cocktail that at least has a name and a pedigree associated with meat.  I made a Meat Hook, a cocktail invented by the bartenders at L'Abattoir (The Slaughterhouse) in Vancouver.  This drink was delicious, with the smoky flavor from the scotch and rye being nicely offset by the fruitiness of the maraschino liqueur. It is sort of like a souped up Manhattan with more fruity flavors."

At first I thought maybe I'd try brisket, but I'd always wanted to try ribs. My husband and I live in Northern Virginia and travel 2 hours south, to Staunton, VA, every year to go to this restaurant that has the most amazing ribs. We haven't gotten there this year, so ribs I had to cook!   Here's the rub (pun intended):  2 racks of St. Louis style pork ribs  Cut off tough flap of meat from the back and top (make the rack take on a rectangular shape). Remove tissue-like cartilage from back. Cover ribs with rub. I use an all-purpose rub that I had in the pantry. Now that I know ribs aren't difficult to  grill, I might try to make my own. Place on a large sheet and cover with tin foil. Refrigerate 2 hours.   Preheat your grill for low, indirect heat (back burner on, heat to around 300 degrees F.). Remove ribs from refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.   When grill is preheated, add ribs to unlit section of grill, rib side up. Close the cover and allow to grill for 2 hours. After 2 hours, remove from grill, baste with BBQ sauce (my homemade recipe was posted for the canning/jarring week), wrap with tin foil, and replace onto the grill for another 2-3 hours.   Remove to baking sheet and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Cut and serve."

First BBQ meal of the season!! My husband fired up the grill just for this. :)  The ribs came out reallllly good. Like finger-lickin' good. Literally. The whiskey barbecue sauce was very watery and not thick, so it did not stick to the ribs much, but it gave it a really nice flavor on the grill. Before grilling, the whiskey taste was super strong. However, after grilling, that whisky taste (which I abhor - bad experiences with whiskey) disappeared and just left a nice, savory barbecue flavor. The ribs were tender too.  The corn came out good, especially slathered in basil butter. The butter was pretty much, to me, the star of this dish! I recommend it to put on ANYTHING! The potatoes came out dry, so we ended up even putting the butter on them and they were saved. And delicious. And grilling corn on the cob was fairly easy but the perfect warm-weather veggie.  As I said before, the potatoes turned out to be dry. Due to what was available at the supermarket, I used purple potatoes instead of red. Not sure if this had to do with the drying-out.

We live in an apartment complex so charcoal is out of the question, and since we didn't have money for a large BBQ we really wanted, we settled for this one. However it works great and now I can bring it to the beach with me for cooking, but I digress.   I'm still learning how to use it; I grew up in a house where my dad BBQ'd and that was “the man's job”, but mostly because my mom didn't like using it and I think he was afraid I'd play around with the fire, which to that I say I probably would have so he made the right decision at the time. However now it is my turn to learn, and it has been fun learning to BBQ different meats with my husband. He isn't too well-versed in the ways of cooking, let alone BBQ, so this is a learning experience for both of us.  That said, I may have over cooked the short ribs a little bit, lol. However, don't let that burnt business fool you; under there is still a very tasty meat that was marinated overnight in a blend of Asian pears, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and more. The smell along from this marinade just screams TASTY. I need to make this again, and go slower with cooking the meat, or try using it on a bigger cut because my oh my, it was tasty! We paired this with some Fiery Red Pepper Potatoes that were mildly spicy until I added more cayenne and some crushed red peppers. All in all, this is a meal I would highly recommend!

52weeksofcooking,35mywz,bluefuzzyoctopus,3,Mon May 11 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"I made this recipe for BBQ sauce; it's a bit meh. Can DEFINITELY taste the canned tomato. It actually got better with time, so recommend letting it sit for a day or so before using.   I tossed a cup or so of that into the slow cooker with a couple pounds of chicken for 6 hours on low.   Slaw was this recipe. Good fresh, but got too bitter after about a day. Not too surprising; I don't think regular slaw would last much longer. :P   After this meal, I added swiss cheese and took out the slaw, and ate it on some sandwich thins. Better with the cheese and without the slaw, sadly. :P Maybe needed a ""regular"" slaw to taste better."

I ""oven barbecued"" the brisket since I live in an apartment in a city, and it was honestly more like a braise. But it was still really good with the traditional barbecue dry rub spices.   Brisket: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/texas-oven-roasted-beef-brisket-recipe.html  White sauce: http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/white-barbecue-sauce-3     I added some cayenne and spice to this to give it a good kick. Highly recommended.   Baked Beans: http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/baked-beans I ended up under seasoning it a tad, but thats nothing that can't be fixed before eating. Really good recipe.   Cabbage: http://www.food.com/recipe/southern-style-cabbage-104803 I added some apple cider vinegar at the end to give it a little tang. It needed the acidity, was pretty flat. Ended up being really good though. Not as good as the stuff that I've found at the bbq joints and meat and 3's here in Nashville, but still good."

52weeksofcooking,35m8kg,fernando_69,3,Mon May 11 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah its a recent discovery for me too. I'm about it now, though. Definitely a good alternative to the traditional red and brown sauces."

52weeksofcooking,35lmzv,mofish1,5,Mon May 11 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"BBQ is one of those things that takes practice and experience to get it right.  It is a lot less exact than a lot of other types of cooking, but a little tuning never hurts.  This week I did a Boston Butt and a rack of St Louis Cut Ribs, SL ribs are actually just spare ribs with the ""rib tips"" sliced off, resulting in a meatier, richer rib than babybacks/loinbacks.  I salted the butt with 1/2tsp kosher salt per pound of meat, and then let it dry brine overnight.  The next morning I sprayed it with some oil (from a misto, not pam), and rubbed it with a slightly modified Meathead's Memphis Dust.  Changes I made to the rub were using the extra bold tellicherry peppercorns from Penzey's, and a little bit of white pepper as well.  I also ground my rosemary right before applying, and made sure I had pungent, aromatic onion,garlic, and ginger powders (these were from Myspicesage).  I heated my 22.5"" Weber Smokey Mountain to about 225 using the Minion Method, with Kingsford charcoal.  Cleaned the grate, put on the butt, adjusted my vents, added some pecan wood chunks, and let it smoke.  I added more wood once the smoke thinned out, about every 2hrs or so, four doses total.  After about 4 hours of smoke I added the ribs, which got the same salt/rub treatment.  After smoking those boys for about 4.5hrs they were done.  When I pulled the ribs out, I also put the butt into a double layer of foil with maybe 1/4c apple cider vinegar, and just dropped it in the oven at 250F for another 1.5hrs, at which time the internal temperature was 195F and the probe slid in and out ""like buttah"". The bone pulled right out with very little resistance as well, which is an excellent indicator of doneness.  After letting it rest for about 20mins I pulled the pork, discarded the fatty chunks, and added most of the crutch juices to the glistening mass of pork strands."
52weeksofcooking,35lmzv,sungenie,2,Mon May 11 15:02:59 2015 UTC,great information.  Gosh that looks just delicious.
52weeksofcooking,35lmzv,CrystalElyse,3,Mon May 11 19:08:11 2015 UTC,Holy hell this looks delicious.  I feel like I need to buy a smoker now....

52weeksofcooking,35lmqh,ausper,2,Mon May 11 14:48:20 2015 UTC,I made pulled pork this week. I don't have a grill so I cooked it in the slow cooker. Here is the recipe I used for the barbecue sauce.   It was easy to make and so delicious. I will definitely make this again. 10/10

52weeksofcooking,35lkms,jakevkline,3,Mon May 11 14:30:18 2015 UTC,"For this week's theme, I wanted to play with my newly modified Brinkmann and shredded beef is delicious, so I went hunting for a barbacoa recipe which used a smoker.  I went with this recipe because it seemed nice and simple which would allow the beef flavor to be most prominent.  The one odd thing that struck me was that there was a ton of oregano in the recipe.  After tasting, the biggest thing I would change would be to up the amount of black pepper significantly (pepper is a great flavor for smoked beef) and to increase the heat with either more chile powder or some cayenne.  The cocktail for this week (and next week, really) was a bit of a puzzler.  I knew that the one thing I didn't want to do was make a cocktail which used BBQ sauce, because that sounded really gross.  Instead, I went with a more interpretive drink.  The most basic elements of BBQ are smoke and spice, so I decided to go with a smoky, spicy margarita for this week's drink.  To up the smoke factor, I used mezcal instead of tequila as the primary liquor.  I also used smoked salt to rim the glass (this was slightly tricky because the large granules of salt did not want to stick to the rim of the car).  To add spice, I used some of the leftover jalapeno-infused tequila from Week 13's cocktail, the Spicy Paloma.    The final recipe was:   1.5 oz mezcal 0.5 oz jalapeno-infused tequila 1 oz tripel sec 1 oz lime juice"
52weeksofcooking,35lkms,mofish1,2,Mon May 11 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"I love smoked chuck, did you go with just naked smoke the whole time or did you do the foil wrap/braise as well?"
52weeksofcooking,35lkms,Orikons,2,Mon May 11 15:09:03 2015 UTC,I did the smoke until it had an internal temp of 160 and then popped it in a covered aluminum pan in the oven for around 45 minutes to braise.
