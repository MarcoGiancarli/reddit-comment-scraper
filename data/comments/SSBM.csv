I do think Big House-Evo is basically the season though, people get burned out after that and September is dead, definitely feels like starting over."
SSBM,3e3wda,krispness,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:46 2015 UTC,"Except Smashcon is happening this August and Paragon LA is happening in September, both are/should be big events."
SSBM,3e3wda,ACDCGAMER,7,Tue Jul 21 21:54:05 2015 UTC,If we are only looking at the gameplay and not the tournament logistics then MVG Sandstorm was incredible.
SSBM,3e3wda,lbblur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:51 2015 UTC,As far as leffen getting bopped this was undoubtedly the best tournament.
SSBM,3e3wda,Vacumpencil,4,Tue Jul 21 21:19:38 2015 UTC,Nah Press Start was way better for that.
SSBM,3e3wda,ramskick,5,Tue Jul 21 21:31:46 2015 UTC,Outside of top 8? Evo unquestionably. So fucking good. Just top 8? Apex but if that's discounted then yeah CEO or maybe WTFox
SSBM,3e3wda,A_Waskawy_Wabit,3,Tue Jul 21 19:33:00 2015 UTC,"Tbh4 if it goes back that far, paragon if not"
SSBM,3e3wda,Brionac23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:03 2015 UTC,CEO and Paragon are run so well. Honestly I'm not the biggest floaty hater in the world but I will say TBH4 had a great top 8 because there was so many spacies and like one peach. Apex was hype AF but looking back the actual play of the top players was pretty lackluster.
SSBM,3e3wda,Vacumpencil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"If we're talking the Summer of Smash, I think CEO was great. Best of 5 top 8s, close games, and scar & toph commentary. Also, it's been in my opinion the best doubles tournament yet (at least, from a viewer's perspective imo)."
SSBM,3e1nju,lemonlust92,17,Tue Jul 21 07:09:53 2015 UTC,"If used to evade an attack, this does give you a better frame advantage to punish compared to a on-platform spot-dodge. Interesting find."
SSBM,3e1nju,Zalozis,13,Tue Jul 21 08:02:09 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about that? Spot dodge goes invincible on frame 2, and for peach intangibility ends on frame 19 and the dodge ends on frame 27. I don't see how this is better unless those numbers are wrong."
SSBM,3e1nju,ContemplativeOctopus,6,Tue Jul 21 09:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah you are right. The only way to have better frame advantage would be to do the airdodge on the latest frame possible, which only gives 4 frames of intangibility.  I think doing a horizontal airdodge would be more useful, kinda like triangle-jumping."
SSBM,3e1nju,schmooblidon,3,Tue Jul 21 12:35:11 2015 UTC,"If you do the frame 1 airdodge: invulnerable 4-18 out of 28  If you spot dodge: invulnerable 2-18 out of 27  I suppose the 3 frame platform drop airdodge would be a nice thought, as it only lasts ~19 frames, but you aren't intangible for very long, so it would have to be a very precise dodge. It would also be a read on your opponent using something without a lot of active frames.  However, In all cases, simply spotdodging earlier would be the better option since spotdodge has less cool down after the last frame of invulnerabiltiy."

SSBM,3e1nju,NanchoMan,4,Tue Jul 21 15:07:37 2015 UTC,"This is interesting, but I don't see anyone taking the time to learn a frame-tight window for essentially a marginally better spot-dodge"
SSBM,3e1nju,OrangeDoors,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:02 2015 UTC,The real question is whether you can do a wavedash out of shield drop. Then it's a marginally better WD OOS! So exciting.
SSBM,3e1nju,_Panda,4,Tue Jul 21 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"Yes it works, Yoshi has to do this to WD OOS since he can't jump OOS."

SSBM,3e1nju,_Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah forgot this thread was about peach. Well in her case, she cant land the airdodge till the tenth airborne frame due to the ecb airborne lock."
SSBM,3e1nju,schmooblidon,8,Tue Jul 21 18:12:20 2015 UTC,I'm imagining someone using this to bait a punish and then DSmash on the platform lel
SSBM,3e1nju,wtvdd,4,Tue Jul 21 07:54:25 2015 UTC,Or you can just dsmash on platform to bait then into dsmashing on platform. It works fairly often.
SSBM,3e1nju,Gatoraay,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:53 2015 UTC,When can you act again? 10 frames after intangibility ends?
SSBM,3e1nju,DavidL1112,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:12 2015 UTC,Yup. I was testing this in debug frame advance mode and I held shield after the air dodge. She lands and was able to shield right on frame 10. Meaning she'll be able to act frame 10 after she lands from the air dodge
SSBM,3e1nju,flyingasian2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:03 2015 UTC,I also discovered you can do a right or left air dodge as well.

Samus: Sheik  Yoshi: Peach  Dr. Mario: Marth  Luigi: Sheik?  Ganon: Fox?  Young Link: Fox  Mario: ???  Link: ???  DK: ???  Zelda: Sheik?, Falcon?  Roy: Icies?, Sheik?  Mewtwo: ???

SSBM,3e1eak,RathKeno,6,Tue Jul 21 08:41:11 2015 UTC,"Sheik should be fox imo.  Pikas worst MU is peach.  For the low tiers its a toss up but I'll try:  Dk gets destroyed by a lot, but camping is awful. Pretty certain peach, he has a 0-death on fox at least.  Mario is prolly also marth.  Link I have no idea, but my guess is peach/sheik. YL is for sure fox.  Zelda's worst MU is sheik, with falcon close behind..  Roys is peach. He can't keep her out. No seriously try this MU and cry.  Getting into idfk territory.   Mewtwo is prolly fox cuz both lasers and easyyyyy kills off the top.  Gdubss my inclination is sheik for the chain grab and needles and mobility.   Ness' could be marth. Ness has atrocious range on everything and is perfect combo weight.  Pichu is likely peach for the same reasons as pika. ICs also sound awful."
SSBM,3e1eak,Xrmy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:30 2015 UTC,nawww Sheik's worst matchup is by far ICs. Fox matchup is like 55-45 fox now that people can tech chase well.
SSBM,3e1eak,Rmbuckley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:44 2015 UTC,The ICs-Sheik MU is incredibly overrated in ICs favor.  Patient play and better punishing makes that MU 45-55 or 50-50 as well.
SSBM,3e1eak,Xrmy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:19 2015 UTC,I just think that a reliable and easily accessible Downthrow > wobble setup is real fricken hard to get around as well as all the other curve balls ICs throw at Sheik.
SSBM,3e1eak,Rmbuckley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:43 2015 UTC,I guess the idea is that shiek can theooretically stay away/stay airborne and never get grabbed if they play hella safe. But no one seems to want to commit to playing that slow of a game. Stages with platforms give Sheik excellent mobility and I can see her having the edge if she plays the platforms and abuses needles.  I could also be super wrong
SSBM,3e1eak,ElPanandero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"I mean it's tough. Needles are weird because Nana can like face tank them even though that still kinda sucks for ICs, but the thing about plat form movement is that IC's upair = godlike and platform camping can be really hard against them."
SSBM,3e1eak,Rmbuckley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:12 2015 UTC,"That's true, the needles thing is if nana faces enough of them without Popo taking any the difference in percents allows Shiek to separate them easier with most aerials. Avoiding those upairs is the real challenge, got to have crisp crisp movement and spacing to use needles and not eat upairs. I've only seen it between players who were pretty different in skill levels so I don't know how it'd translate to two even players. Again it'd come down to the style, a guy like Chu is god like with his upair timing, but a guy like plup has such crisp platform movement. It'd be interesting to see them play when their both in the zone (like they were at EVO)"
SSBM,3e1eak,ElPanandero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"Mario is definitely also Marth. Can confirm. The biggest differences between Doc, and classic Mario, is that Doc is more powerful, and classic Mario has a better recovery. Neither of them are able to make up what makes them an awful matchup against Marth, their short stubby arms, against Marth's very long sword."

SSBM,3e1eak,d4b3ss,14,Tue Jul 21 05:38:22 2015 UTC,"Puff is worse than Marth for Peach. You could argue Falcon is worse than Marth as well, I think they're about the same levels of shitty for the Peach player."
SSBM,3e1eak,theyak1715,10,Tue Jul 21 06:11:39 2015 UTC,it doesn't make any sense for fox's worst matchup to be falco and falco's worst matchup to be fox lol
SSBM,3e1eak,TunaSheep,18,Tue Jul 21 06:05:09 2015 UTC,Im not saying it is true but mathematically it could be true. If both Fox and Falco had a winning matchup against every character in the game but then had even matchups against each other then their worst matchups would be each other.
SSBM,3e1eak,Habefiet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:54 2015 UTC,"Their worst matchups would also be themselves then though, so denoting both would make it clearer  Unless it was like 55:45 Fox but each won every other matchup by 60:40 or greater lol"
SSBM,3e1eak,Reesch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:42 2015 UTC,"If Fox-Falco is 55-45 and every other match-up for Fox is 60-40 or better and for Falco is 50-50 or better is makes sense.  Not saying that's what they are, but it works."
SSBM,3e1eak,Tugnus,5,Tue Jul 21 06:10:40 2015 UTC,No. Fox's worse match up would be himself. 50-50
SSBM,3e1eak,Reesch,5,Tue Jul 21 06:20:13 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true, actually.  But that's a lame answer lol."
SSBM,3e1eak,Tugnus,4,Tue Jul 21 06:25:46 2015 UTC,"It's the truth, which is why Fox players hate playing the ditto. It's the only time they don't have a winning match up."

SSBM,3e1eak,HppilyPancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"I actually totally forgot how bad that MU was while typing this, whoops."
SSBM,3e1eak,ReinDance,12,Tue Jul 21 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"Marth's is arguably falcon. It remains tough at a top level because you can't out maneuver falcon. He's faster and is one of the few characters in the game with as good a dash dance as Marth. Kind of like against floaties Marth had to just repeatedly win the neutral. Against floaties that's because it's hard to combo them, but with falcon it's because it should be death if he grabs you, so you have to win neutral or die."
SSBM,3e1eak,ssbtonic,2,Tue Jul 21 06:04:09 2015 UTC,"I'd add Fox as being a pretty hard counter to ICs as well, and ICs as decent counter for Sheik"
SSBM,3e1eak,A_Waskawy_Wabit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:54:27 2015 UTC,ICs are an amazing counter for sheik. I feel like there's nothing she can do but run away and needle
SSBM,3e1eak,Reesch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"Why do you think Falco worse than Sheik for Falcon? The edgeguards are about as easy on both of them for Falcon, and I see getting tech-chased as far harder to escape than pillaring. Lasers are worse on stage, and needles are worse off stage for Falcon so those feel about equal."
SSBM,3e1eak,particlemaniac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:36 2015 UTC,I think the consensus is Falco wins neutral really hard vs Falcon whereas Sheik struggles a little. Plus I think Falco has an easier time getting Falcon off stage.
SSBM,3e1eak,HppilyPancakes,2,Tue Jul 21 09:52:16 2015 UTC,"Falco Neutral is generally much harder to navigate IMO, and I believe the edgegaurding is better and easier for falco since Fsmash is basically guaranteed for below stage, and bair is good enough for above stage, though I agree both should basically be free kills. If you're playing well, most of your time should be spent on stage anyways, and Falcon's offstage against both is trash. The needle advantage is basically moot/win-more given sheik's other ledgeguarding options.  The biggest differences for me is that Falco has more recovery options, that Sheik gets blown up a little bit harder, and that sheik is easier to whiff punish on."
SSBM,3e1eak,Reesch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:29 2015 UTC,I like these answers. I agree with you about staying on stage. That's a good point.
SSBM,3e1eak,HppilyPancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:30 2015 UTC,My primary practice partner plays Falco/Sheik now. It's painful :(
SSBM,3e1eak,particlemaniac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"Falcon, Sheik and Yoshi are all Marth's hardest matchups. Peach's hardest is definitely Puff. Also, Falco has just as hard a time vs Marth as Peach and Fox. Sheik also has a rough time vs ICs and Falco but with her metagame development it seems unclear as to which will be her hardest matchup in the future.  Generally good list though!"
SSBM,3e1eak,A_Waskawy_Wabit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:01 2015 UTC,Unless something crazy new is discovered her matchup with icies will never change. They shut down her grab game completely and she has no safe way of separating them
SSBM,3e1eak,particlemaniac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:28 2015 UTC,Based on that it may well be ICs then.
SSBM,3e1eak,flyingasian2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:47 2015 UTC,Puff is probably Sheik's worst MU.  Maybe Samus could be included in bad MU's for falco
SSBM,3e1eak,Mr_Fasion,0,Tue Jul 21 14:32:49 2015 UTC,Fox's worst matchup is Falco for sure
SSBM,3e1eak,brentosclean,-9,Tue Jul 21 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"Marth's worst match up at top level should be sheik then falco.  Peach is definitely up there for falco's worst match up.  Not top tier, but Roy is Puff's worst matchup. It's like 95-5 lol.  All the rest are correct  Quick edit: puff is one of peach's worst matchups, which is why hbox would usually beat armada, especially back in the early days of the gods."

I don't use the bird and nothing I can theorycraft gives a good case outside of this)  Marth - Falcon (might not be the case. Might even be Yoshi (even if that's a pretty hard matchup for Yoshi to play technically speaking regardless if he wins on paper or not). Marth kinda struggles with the mid tiers but yeah I definitely say it's Falcon since Falcon's tools just align to help him win. Just theorycrafting though)  Sheik - Ice Climbers (from what I've seen anyway from Sheiks anyway. It might not be that bad at all, but oh well. I feel like Sheik's matchups aren't understood that well overall right now, and I can only go on what I see since I don't main her lol)  Puff - Fox (how surprising)  Peach - Puff (might not be as bad as Armada says it is; I've seen other Peaches say as much. Either way though it's definitely the consensus that this is bad for Peach and I'd give it the edge over the Fox MU. But who knows, I could be wrong)  Falcon - Fox (might not be Fox, might be Falco, I think some might say it's Sheik, but nobody can deny Fox-Falcon is not good for Falcon, even if he can punish Fox hard)  ICs - Peach (the classic)  now for the mid tiers, again correct me pls  Samus - Sheik (Sheik does Sheik things)  Yoshi - Peach (This is kind of hard to explain but it's awful. Peach is just a wall, Peach wins the neutral hard and it goes from there)  Pikachu - Ice Climbers (he has no range, he can't really get anything started, I don't think he can separate Nana well? Ultimately he just gets wobbled and dies)  Luigi - Sheik (really not sure about this, I feel like Sheik just does Sheik things. He obviously struggles with the top tiers better-character-ing him in general)  Doc - Sheik (see Luigi)  Mario - Sheik (see Luigi)  Ganon - Sheik (poor Ganon. This could be a spacie too but from what I know about Sheik-Ganon it's pretty awful)  now for the low/bottom tiers (some of these are probably going to be even less accurate, if not completely wrong, pleeease correct me on these if you know lol)  DK - Sheik or Peach (can't see DK being able to touch these really, probably Sheik since maybe DK's bair might be able to vaguely resemble a neutral game for him? lol)  Link - Sheik (idk, I feel like Sheik just does Sheik things and destroys)  Young Link - Sheik (see Link)  Roy - Peach (this one's pretty obvious, he just can't hit her and absolutely cannot kill her)  Mewtwo - Peach (idk, I just can't see him being able to touch her because of the space she generally wants to be in, and unable to kill her because of his moveset)  Zelda - Fox (she's too slow, she just gets camped so hard, what does she even do?)  G&W - Sheik or Peach (idk here, another one where I think Fox might be just as bad on paper but the volatility means G&W realistically stands more of a chance)  Ness - Marth (Ness's complete lack of range and free recovery makes me think this, it could definitely be a spacie or Sheik or Peach or whoever though)  Kirby - Fox (Kirby's kinda like Puff but has a slightly better ground game imo and is worse in every other way. He can't weave in and out and just... how does he do anything against Fox)  Pichu - Ice Climbers (like Pikachu but even worse)  Bowser - Sheik or Peach (Sheik might have the chaingrab but I feel like even if Bowser miraculously lands a hit it means even less on Peach making it hellish)  Hope everyone enjoyed that (probably uninformed) theorycraft wall of text as much as I enjoyed writing it lool"

SSBM,3e1eak,stickity,5,Tue Jul 21 13:20:52 2015 UTC,I think the Falco meta is utter shit tbh. Too much reliance on lasers for literally everything. Seemingly no understanding of how to use space strategically if not for shooting lasers. Poor movement and pressure habits. Poor mentality regarding shield pressure and opportunities it creates. Poor edgeguard theory. Poor implementation of mechanics. Poor stage control. Etc etc. I don't think there's a well rounded Falco out there.
SSBM,3e1eak,just_dan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"I think PP is pretty well rounded, but doesn't quite have the combo game on fast-fallers that some others do and doesn't edgeguard some characters as well as Mango. I agree that Falco is starting to lag behind in new tech/ideas though."
SSBM,3e1eak,HappyMoses,5,Tue Jul 21 18:41:30 2015 UTC,Marth Falco is a heavily discussed MU that is widely considered to be 50/50. Falco absolutely has worse matchups than that (Peach immediately comes to mind).
SSBM,3e1eak,SubjectiveF,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"The punish game on falco is similar for marth and peach, the difference is that lasers are barely a factor for peach and they're still something marth does have to deal with, even if he's good at it. I definitely think marth beats falco, though."
SSBM,3e1eak,Epic563,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:45:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree.
SSBM,3e1eak,CptnLarsMcGillicutty,7,Tue Jul 21 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"Falco's worst matchup is Fox? LOL. Falco and fox go 50/50. Every fox player I know loves playing falco, and every falco player loves playing fox, its like goku vs vegeta, they both have the tools to destroy each other.   I would argue falco vs peach and falco vs puff are 45/55, which is absolute blasphemy to the ""spacies cant possibly have any bad matchups"" circlejerk that has existed for a long time, but just ask yourself, what can falco actually do to puff? Lasers dont work very well, especially since she can crouch beneath them. You cant edgeguard her, you cant combo her, you cant shield pressure her, killing off the top is far harder with falco than with fox, and if you get rested your chance of recovering is far worse than fox's, and if puff gets falco off stage hes basically dead 100%. Puff is basically the perfect falco counter based on all of her properties. anyone who says thats 50/50 isnt being realistic. If one character has a harder time killing another character than that character has killing them, thats called a bad matchup. Would anyone honestly say falco can kill puff just as easily as puff can kill him?   The peach matchup is just as bad for many of the same reasons. falco cant combo peach effectively because peach can spam nair to combobreak by trading with falco. falco loses every trade with peach because she has far superior recovery, so if they both hit each other just as hard, peach still wins in each instance. peach can combo falco more effectively than puff, peach can chain grab falco, she can edgeguard him effectively, she can float over lasers. Falco can barely edgeguard peach as well, her umbrella outprioritizes dair, and unlike fox, falco cannot nair into upsmash, or upthrow into upair, or waveshine into upsmash, so he has no guaranteed kills on peach the way fox does. every single stock is a struggle.  both peach and jiggs thrive on horizontal recovery and die from vertical hits. falco specializes in horizontal kills, while his vertical kit consist of shine towards the top off a platform which is hard to hit, and dtilt which has too much startup lag, no range, isnt safe on shield, and cannot be comboed into effectively on floaties. clearly not a 50/50 matchup, hence why falcos in general have so many issues facing peach and puff. the entire reason most top players who play falco hate playing the matchup and pickup fox is because its so difficult, not because its 50/50, or in their favor.  Id also argue that Marth/Peach is 50/50, not in marths favor like everyone says for some crazy reason. And Marth/Puff is like 45/55 at best. He has very few tools to kill them with at any %, which is why you see puffs and peaches living so long against Marth. Because of that I feel Falco/Marth dual maining(which I do) is not very good because they both have amazing kits for dealing with most characters, but cant handle the floaties the way fox can.   PPMD performed exactly how I expected him to against HBox due to both characters having IMO a bad matchup, when he is clearly a better player. Theoretically, if two players are of even skill, the player with a better matchup will win, (provided they dont kill themselves). So if one player is better than another and still loses, it is a definite sign of a bad matchup (and/or killing themselves)."
SSBM,3e1eak,dydtaylor,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel like Falco still beats Peach and Puff, despite the downsides you mention. Even though his combo ability is reduced on them he can still combo them a little bit, and that's huge against those characters. His tall full jump and insane priority below him, combined with his great platform movement makes platform camping them a very viable, hard to deal with strategy on dreamland, battlefield, and fod, while Stadium has a good platform layout and a lot of his weaknesses in the matchups get eliminated on Yoshi's (although Peach can control platforms and space extremely well on Yoshi's).  His recovery also, while very difficult against both floaties, is not a 100% death from him being off the stage. While many many of his options can be covered the characters are not fast enough to cover all of the options and typically I feel like you can identify which options they aren't covering in most situations, even more so if you have a double jump.  Falco will always have autocancelled back airs, up tilt, and down air, as well as very good poking/zoning tools with his jab and ftilt, with jab still leading to potential kill combos depending on percent. Falco might or might not have the horizontal mobility to deal with the characters but he still has huge hitboxes. If Puff is bair camping you then he has the vertical mobility to go over her and take advantage of her very weak vertical hitboxes."
SSBM,3e1eak,CptnLarsMcGillicutty,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"a good jiggs can 100% just jump off the stage and cover every single option. she can wall of pain you before you can even get off an Up B or side B, god forbid you are missing a jump. In fact Im pretty sure jiggs has the best edgeguarding against falco in the entire game. theres not a single character who shuts down his recovery harder than jiggs.  it is not possible for falco to laser camp anymore in this meta. laser camping worked back in the early days of melee. but now even mid level players are learning to powershield consistently. you make one mistake with a falco laser and it can lead to any high tier character comboing you for half your life. falcos cant afford to just sit and spam lasers anymore, it takes creativity and timing mixups now. people are more than willing to trade laser damage for a hit, instead of let the lasers whittle them down.   The fact that falco can jab into backair for kills is true for any character. that isnt reasoning for why his peach/puff matchups arent bad. peach and puff both have easy gimps on falco, falco absolutely does not have gimps on them. again, he has no effective vertical kills, which is what works against peach and puff. he has no way to edgeguard either of them.  the way most falcos play this matchup is by racking up damage little by little since they cant combo. most kills come from well spaced backairs, and laser jabs into backair. but no other character counters the way falco is generally played as much as them. you try to rush down a peach as falco and have fun getting downsmashed. you get shieldgrabbed by either of them and you will be nearly killed even from low %, if not killed completely with a rest. again, I dont think anyone who knows anything about this matchup would honestly say that falco has as easy of a time killing peach and puff as they have killing him. that is what ultimately matters.  I looked up PPMD vs HBox on youtube, just to watch the very first video that pops up. Very first stock, hbox wall of pains PP off the stage. Second stock HBox shield grabs PP into an upthrow rest. within 30 seconds HBox is up 2 stocks. that is simply not possible for falco to do to puff. I then went to the Westballz vs HBox set from MLG last year. HBox rests him like 5 times in 3 games. most of the time, Westballz cant even kill him off of the top platform of Yoshis when he revives the way he could with fox. Theres very few high level sets I could find where people use falco to beat a jiggs. If falco genuinely won the matchup, then way fewer people would be switching to fox because they would have great results either way.  If your character has to work harder, that = a bad matchup. If your character has a harder time killing theirs that = bad matchup. Thats really all there is to it."

SSBM,3e1eak,sefazures,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"honestly, idk about Falco vs Puff/Peach. I don't play Falco but based on MY opinion I do honestly see him losing to them.  But the general opinion does seem to be that, on paper, Falco does do fine against Peach and Puff, just that his side of the matchup is more volatile and more technically difficult to play out, even if he has the tools to do fine. I tried to balance out reality (ie: do Falcos seem able to win these matchups consistently) against theory (ie: does Falco have the tools to win this matchup on paper).  Either way I'm bad at this game so it's just pointless theorycrafting but still. lol  as an extra note, I intentionally didn't use this as my argument, but look at this: PP's opinion of Falco-Peach  edit: whoops linked to the Falco vs ICs matchup first, my B"
SSBM,3e1eak,A-Fred,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:39 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:   Fox - Marth   The ditto shouldn't count. I think we are seeing Falco fall behind in this match-up while Marth is keeping up. Agreed.   Falco - Fox   I might say Marth again instead. PPMD has said (it was a while ago though) that Marth was Falco's worst match-up and PPU has claimed Falco straight-up loses to Marth. Fox is a close second, but Fox being combo food for Falco evens it up a bit.   Marth - Falcon   Sheik is the conventional pick here, and I think it's for good reason. She has IMO an even better punish game on Marth than Falcon does. Needles give Marth trouble in the neutral game and offstage. I can see the Falcon pick, but I think Sheik or even Fox (ironically) are harder match-ups.   Sheik - Ice Climbers   Agreed. Ice Climbers just have such a massive advantage in the punish game with down throw to Wobble while Sheik can't down throw with Nana around. Sheik just has to play to avoid every potential grab set-up and it just looks almost impossible. Fox is the only match-up which is in contention here, and with Sheik's tech chase game that match-up is not too bad.   Puff - Fox   Yeah Fox destroys Puff.   Peach - Puff   This match-up made the most committed Peach give up. She has no answer for the disjoint of Bair. One rest for Puff is devastating and all it takes is one good read on a tech roll. I agree with Armada switching for this one.   Falcon - Fox   Agreed. Falco and Sheik are also bad, but Fox has every advantage in neutral, waveshines, shine spikes, etc.   ICs - Peach (the classic)   Pretty much unanimous   Samus - Sheik   Yeah Sheik can actually edge guard Samus with needles, gets free combos, can just grab a Samus trying to CC.   Yoshi - Peach   Agreed. aMSa has no chance against Armada ever. Fox is bad, but Yoshi has a good punish game to give a shot. With Peach there is no hope.   Pikachu - Ice Climbers   I think I agree here. The other possibilities are probably Peach and Sheik, but I can see ICs as being the worst since they definitely have the strongest punish game.   Luigi - Sheik   I've talked to Abate about this. He says Sheik is the worst, and I watched DruggedFox dismantle him. This match-up is hard.   Doc - Sheik   Now here I disagree. Doc has a chain grab on Sheik up to about 70% and can combo into Fair. He has some hope in the neutral game with Pills, Bair, Dsmash, etc. Doc and Mario are actually pretty decent against Sheik overall. They lose, but it's not their worst. Now Marth is impossible. Marth's disjoints and speed just cannot be overcome with Doc (see PPU vs. Shroomed). Peach is also pretty bad because she does here normal thing vs low tiers (can't combo her well, she is strong in Neutral and can still combo and edge guard well while living forever).   Mario - Sheik   See Doc   Ganon - Sheik   Ganon also has a chain grab on Sheik, but Sheik chain grabs him harder and is way better in neutral so I can see this, but I think spacies are worse. Against Falco he has no answers for lasers as he can't move fast enough between them to evade or attack. He just gets shut down hard. This is a hard one for me to decide which is worst...   DK - Sheik or Peach   Seems right, not sure.   Link - Sheik   I'd say Fox here actually. Not that Sheik isn't terrible, but Link is just so perfect for getting bodied by Fox's punish game and the neutral is so much in Fox's favor. Either way though.   Young Link - Sheik   Well Young Link is slightly better against Fox cause he gets knocked down by shine. I can give it to Sheik but again it is pretty bad against Fox too.   Roy - Peach   Roy gets chain grabbed by Sheik really hard so it might be her instead, but Peach is also a good choice.   Mewtwo - Peach    I'm fine with this.   Zelda - Fox   The only thing I know about this match-up is that one Zelda main who is well known and streams actually uses Sheik against Sheik. I can Fox though because he has such a huge advantage in neutral it's basically impossible.   G&W - Sheik or Peach   Peach or a spacie maybe. His biggest weakness is his tiny shield and these characters can just force their way through his shield. I'll go with Peach as well because spacies can actually be punished for mistakes.   Ness - Marth   Sheik beats Ness hard in Neutral too, but her chain grab makes this stupid.   Kirby - Fox   Agreed. Poor Kirby.   Pichu - Ice Climbers   This or Sheik who again chain grabs Pichu and can just use her quick hitboxes to keep her out.   Bowser - Sheik or Peach   Sheik can chain grab again. Peach is a good choice too.  Ok those got a bit tedious near the end. Remember this is just some feedback rather than necessarily corrections."
SSBM,3e1eak,upvotegod98,6,Tue Jul 21 13:27:33 2015 UTC,PPMD has said (it was a while ago though) that Marth was Falco's worst match-up and PPU has claimed Falco straight-up loses to Marth.   PPMD literally came into the matchup thread and said falco won 55/45

SSBM,3e1eak,Bunsunkunsun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Ganon also has a chain grab on Sheik, but Sheik chain grabs him harder    I have to nitpick this one small point, ganon's chaingrab is 3 times  more % on sheik than vice versa. It still doesn't matter for the other reasons you said, like a better grab and neutral overall. on top of that, if you DI to jump out of sheik's dthrow as ganon (i think it's somewhere in the late 30's when you can avoid regrab) the sheik has ample time to react to your DI and uptilt or whatever they want. BUT it's not a perfect chaingrab past that %, whereas ganon chaingrabs sheik into the 80s(aka 0-death if you dthrow bair at 85%) iirc.  As a long time ganon main I'd say both spacies are just as bad as sheik though."
SSBM,3e1eak,A-Fred,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, I actually meant Sheik chain grabs him harder because it's easier for her to get the grab and the actual chain grab is easier. I wasn't aware of the complete percent details. Can you speak to the difficulty of Ganon's chain grab on Sheik? I haven't seen many people do it and I know the spacie chain grab is really difficult. Is it actually reasonable to consistently chain grab Sheik 0 to death consistently? Thanks for the feedback. I couldn't decide who actually is his worst match-up. If you had to pick one of them who would you pick and why?"
SSBM,3e1eak,Bunsunkunsun,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"The chaingrab is definitely difficult to consistently get big % off with ganon due to his speed and poor grab range. You need to have a read on/very quick reaction to their DI at higher %s because a moment's hesitation means you won't get there before they can jump out. Sheik has the benefit of easy reactions and simple followups that lead to huge damage, and the chaingrab works to much higher % if ganon doesn't DI correctly to jump out. Sheik doesn't need to regrab ganon at all to destroy him in the matchup though, she can shut down ganon's neutral options purely off of reaction, and should never miss an edgeguard vs ganon EVER. If i had to rate sheik or spacies for worst matchup vs ganon I'd have to go with Spacies though. Ganon has great punish games on sheik and both spacies, but fox can do the same thing sheik can by using his superior movement to avoid ganon, just reacting to punish anything ganon whiffs, and falco can make ganon unable to move at all with proper laser pressure But they have the added benefit of a much more difficult time for ganon to get the hard punish through chaingrabs or tech chasing, both of which are pretty much humanly impossible on spacies without making continuous hard reads."

From what I can see people think he struggles more with Falco, so I was probably wrong about him being his worst MU, but it's pretty much a general consensus that Fox beats Falcon pretty hard  as for Marth-Falcon, Marth doesn't really have any BAD matchups. Honestly Sheik probably does better against Marth than Falcon but still.  and yeah I probably did put Sheik down too much. Honestly this was all just theorycraft since I saw nobody attempting to think about all of the matchups.  I definitely know Peach also crushes most low tiers though. She's just a wall."
SSBM,3e1eak,Mexicanfood_and_feet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"Doc kinda loses to every character just as bad as each other, more or less. His hardest would have to be any arrangement of falco (lasers are hard to deal with since his jumps are so stubby, and his crouch canceling is stuffed by dairs. Falco also combos doc, which is pretty rare) falcon (range, destroys pills, can get around crouch canceling, combos, and doesnt even need to bother edgeguarding him because knees will destroy doc early) marth (range, juggles, swats pills, and is somewhat tough to combo) and peach (hard to combo, hard to kill without a read, impossible to edgeguard, and has a tough neutral with potent crouch canceling). All of those should be 35-65 and the rest of the top 8 mus should be 40-60. Sheiks neutral and recovery are simple to deal with as doc and she eats combos like nothing else.  Mario performs slightly worse against fox falco and falcon, gets absolutely destroyed by marth peach puff and ics, and goes about 45-55 against sheik with his great grab game and combos accentuating on docs already stellar strengths in the mu.  Fox imo is much easier to handle than a character like falco. Foxs punishes/edgeguards on falcon are arguable against falcos punishes/edgeguards (despite imo falco having the advantage in raw damage output and falcons recovery being bad enough that shinespikes hardly outclass falcos fsmash dair and offtstage lasers anyway), but i feel fox is much easier to handle in the neutral. Any of foxs tools in neutral can be outspaced and outprioritized by falcons absurd disjoint. Falcon has the ability to pull out raw knees in neutral, and can move around the stage completely unrestricted. Falco on the other hand limits falcons ability to move, and can easily force a shield from falcon who is built around avoiding being in shield as often as possible. Results from past falcons also tend to favor falco being more dominant in the mu than fox.   I dont think falcon is marths worst mu. A lot of it is due to recency bias with people respecting falcon a whole lot and neglecting sheik just as much. I already feel that peach v falcon is an overrated mu for falcon and that peach doesnt lose nearly as hard as people think (45-55 as opposed to 40-60), and people are respecting falcons strengths just a little too much against marth. I wouldnt put it behind me to say that falcon potentially slightly has an edge over marth, but there is a misconception going around that as the level of play rises, falcon becomes better of a character and sheik becomes worse without much explanation towards either point and is imo ignorant to developments other characters could be making as well at high level play. Top players have pointed out that sheik has been underdeveloped for a while, and newer sheiks are starting to make advances in sheiks meta in these recent large tournaments. Sheik is just slept on, simple as that."

SSBM,3e1eak,Xrmy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"This is pretty good, but a few are likely wrong.  Ganon's worst MU is Fox, pretty inarguably. He has a CG on sheik and can kill her easily but cant do a thing vs fox.   Mewtwo my inclination is fox because of lasers and uair/usmash kills.   DK is peach I am 90% sure.   Young link is 100% fox. This is arguably one of the worst MUs in the game. He has no combo game on fox, edguards are difficult, can't kill with dair, and most of all his main strategy is run away and bomb, and fox is faster in every single category by a ways.   Zelda's worst MU is sheik, followed very closely by falcon. Fox is also awful but she has solid punishes on him and gimps.   Doc/Mario is Marth.  And lastly, I am of the very strong opinion that SHeiks worst MU is fox. the neutral in this MU is very tough, kills can be tough, and the punish game on sheik is really rough. Not an awful MU by any means, but his worst.   The ICs/sheik MU is such a product of ICs not knowing the MU. A patient and campy sheik makes this MU even, it is just that it is one of those hard evens like Marth in the Sheik-Marth MU."

SSBM,3e1eak,sefazures,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"honestly the main reason that I didn't put Fox and Falco down for most matchups is because I wasn't just thinking about how the matchups should play out on paper.  I was also considering the ""human"" element - ie, generally, spacie players won't be perfect ALL the time. And for a lot of low tiers, if they land a hit on a spacie, they can do a LOT from it. (eg DK's chaingrabs). However, their problem is that they just struggle so much landing those hits in the neutral, and the spacies can punish them just as hard, and likely harder.  Against characters like Peach, the neutral is less bad than it is against spacies, but it's still godawful. And they need to fight super hard just to win neutral and land a hit. But against Peach, they can't really get much from that hit, so it just goes back to neutral."
SSBM,3e1eak,CodeNameJake,8,Tue Jul 21 15:29:14 2015 UTC,"Luigis worst Matchup is for sure Falco. His lasers lock down luigis ground movement unless you can power shield and they also stop his recovery a lot, his bair has ridiculous priority along with dair which luigi can't do a whole lot about, but the main thing is lasers. Those God damn lasers."
SSBM,3e1eak,theyak1715,5,Tue Jul 21 06:02:58 2015 UTC,"idk, sheik fucks up luigi pretty bad."
SSBM,3e1eak,CodeNameJake,0,Tue Jul 21 06:07:03 2015 UTC,"It's close, but I think falco is worse just because the lasers make the neutral really hard, while shiek you can actually have some room to breath."
SSBM,3e1eak,Tugnus,5,Tue Jul 21 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"If you know how to power shield, it's not that bad, especially since he can be combo'd.  Luigi can't combo Sheik nearly as well and needles are rough as hell."
SSBM,3e1eak,CodeNameJake,3,Tue Jul 21 06:22:10 2015 UTC,"The thing about power shielding though, is that it's really, really hard and impossible to get down 100%, even 50% is rough. Yes the match up against shiek is horrible, but luigis combo game on shiek is actually pretty good, with down throw to down smash at 0% being great for racking up damage. Luigi can also edge guard shiek pretty well, with an up b on stage leading to a free shoryuken. Needles are a bitch especially when she's edge guarding you, but Falcos lasers are easier to hit while edge guarding horizontally, and sets up great for a dair.   EDIT: Forgot about up-tilt. Extremely hard to get around and leads into A LOT for Falco"
SSBM,3e1eak,_davey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:08 2015 UTC,"^ I second this. I think people say the Falco mu isn't as bad as the Sheik mu just because power shielding is a thing. If a Luigi can power shield every single laser thrown at him, the mu wouldn't be all that terrible. Unfortunately it's pretty hard to do in during a real match."
SSBM,3e1eak,Jamarac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:21:25 2015 UTC,Luigi can definitely be combo'd fairly decently. Just watch a westballz vs eddy match.
SSBM,3e1eak,Quandiverous,3,Tue Jul 21 14:15:42 2015 UTC,"I would agree to this. With sheik the fall through platform f-airs with needles and back air make it a hard match up for luigi, BUT falco is much worse imo.  Lasers are a big thing, but also falco just has really good priority with little room for luigi to punish him. Even sub-par spacing is nearly impossible to punish because of shines. If Falco has a move out, it takes very particular spacing to punish him even if you know where he is going, and afterwards he has shine and OOS b-air or more shines.  Luigi does have a good combo game on falco, but falco also has a surprsingly good combo game on luigi despite him being a floaty, mostly because of his terrible air control. If luigi gets shined once, he is in a super terrible position, even if he smash DI's correctly, falco's bair will beat out his DAIR the vast majority of the time. The only option is air dodging, which leaves you open of course.  But primarily its laser approach mix ups that wreck your neutral. Laser approach mixups with high priority moves that are very hard to punish.   So the skinny of it is Falco can just wall out luigi super well with B-air and stop his neutral with lasers. Overall just a terrifying match up for luigi.  Though to be fair, if luigi gets a good grab with a good follow up and and reads the ledge guard he can end falco's stock.  But he can do that with sheik too, its just less comboing and more easy ledge guarding."
SSBM,3e1eak,CptnLarsMcGillicutty,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:33 2015 UTC,"Fox - Marth/Falco 50/50  Fox has no bad matchups, but I think of all the character in the game, these are the two he goes absolutely even with.  Falco - Puff/Peach 45/55  As I commented earlier, this is my opinion as an 11 year vet of this matchup, which I have theorycrafted and discussed with top players, including PPMD, Westballz, Zhu, etc.   I would argue falco vs peach and falco vs puff are 45/55, which is absolute blasphemy to the ""spacies cant possibly have any bad matchups"" circlejerk that has existed for a long time, but just ask yourself, what can falco actually do to puff? Lasers dont work very well, especially since she can crouch beneath them. You cant edgeguard her, you cant combo her, you cant shield pressure her, killing off the top is far harder with falco than with fox, and if you get rested your chance of recovering is far worse than fox's, and if puff gets falco off stage hes basically dead 100%. Puff is basically the perfect falco counter based on all of her properties. anyone who says thats 50/50 isnt being realistic. If one character has a harder time killing another character than that character has killing them, thats called a bad matchup. Would anyone honestly say falco can kill puff just as easily as puff can kill him?  The peach matchup is just as bad for many of the same reasons. falco cant combo peach effectively because peach can spam nair to combobreak by trading with falco. falco loses every trade with peach because she has far superior recovery, so if they both hit each other just as hard, peach still wins in each instance. peach can combo falco more effectively than puff, peach can chain grab falco, she can edgeguard him effectively, she can float over lasers. Falco can barely edgeguard peach as well, her umbrella outprioritizes dair, and unlike fox, falco cannot nair into upsmash, or upthrow into upair, or waveshine into upsmash, so he has no guaranteed kills on peach the way fox does. every single stock is a struggle, whereas peach can just play it formulaic.  both peach and jiggs thrive on horizontal recovery and die from vertical hits. falco specializes in horizontal kills, while his vertical kit consist of shine towards the top off a platform which is hard to hit, and dtilt which has too much startup lag, no range, isnt safe on shield, and cannot be comboed into effectively on floaties. clearly not a 50/50 matchup, hence why falcos in general have so many issues facing peach and puff. the entire reason most top players who play falco hate playing the matchup and pickup fox is because its so difficult, not because its 50/50, or in their favor.   Shiek - Fox/ICs/Puff 45/55  Pretty much everyone agrees with this, Shiek as a character has the tools to deal with literally every other character in the game if played correctly. One grab should theoretically lead to death every single time. There is no counter to tech chasing. However Fox has a fairly easy time in the neutral game, and has consistent kill setups on shiek, whereas shiek usually has a more difficult time killing fox than she has of killing him. All of Fox's neutral game leads into kills on her (nair>upsmash, shine>upsmash, upthrow>upair) and perhaps most importantly, Fox has the easiest time edgeguarding shiek in the whole game. The second shes forced to recover from offstage she is at a significantly higher disadvantage than against any other character, due to how easy optional drill>waveshine>upsmash is.  IC's are also very bad. If ICs get Shiek off stage, thats a wobble. If Shiek grabs one IC, the other hits her out of it, and there is no tech chasing ability vs them. If shiek gets shield grabbed, because none of her approaches vs ICs are safe on shield, thats a wobble. Her best bet is to needle camp, but usually ICs have a good enough wavedash to punish her if she attempts this on a platform.  Additionally, the Puff matchup is brutal for shiek, because without being on FoD or Yoshis, Shiek's fair is largely weakened. Shiek gets WoPed really hard off stage, and when recovering Puff can usually get a free rest. Shiek basically cant even grab puff. She is too short to shield grab, and too short to nair or fair out of shield, meaning puff basically doesnt even get punished for approaching. Shiek cant tech chase puff, which is one of her most important tools, and cant chain grab either. She has no vertical kills on puff whatsoever, unless you count upair at very high %s. People dont understand how bad this matchup is because its pretty rare to see these days.  Shiek's grab game is her #1 property. Her tech chasing, chain grabbing, and options after a throw are what make her so dominant. So it makes sense the two characters who completely neutralize that (puff and ICs) would be IMO her worst matchups.  Marth - Shiek 45/55 at best, 40/60 at worst. Probably closer to 45/55.  Recently there has been a small movement saying that Marth Shiek is actually 50/50, but thats just silly. Sheik simply has better tools against marth than marth does against shiek. Shiek has an easy time edgeguarding marth, while marth doesnt have much to edgeguard shiek with. Marths grabs also dont really lead into anything 60% of the time, especially at low %s, whereas all of shieks juggle moves (ftilt, dtilt, downthrow, dair) are excellent at popping marth up into a fair. Because Shiek gets more off of shieldgrabs than marth, it means marth is punished more for approaching in the matchup than shiek is. Needles are absolutely brutal against Marth's horizontal recovery, especially when combined with platforms.   Puff - Fox 45/55.  Pretty obvious. I think its also pretty obvious that this matchup isnt anywhere near as bad as many people make it out to be (many say 40/60). People talk about it like its unwinnable for puff. How many foxes did HBox beat this weekend? Puffs tools are pretty universal. And it helps that she has upthrow>rest in the matchup, and can juggle fox in a way she cant juggle several other high tiers. I would say Fox is puff's one and only bad matchup.  Peach - Fox 45/55  Fox has good tools for dealing with peach, as he specializes in vertical kills, unlike falco. Peach has to straight up play better than the fox to win this matchup. I think Fox is her only bad matchup in the entire game, except for maybe falcon. Shiek and Marth she goes 50/50 with imo, which people consider blasphemy.  Falcon - Shiek 40/60  Falcon players by far complain about shiek the most of any character. Shiek destroys falcon's recovery, and her juggles into fair can really just bop him. Unlike most other top characters, Falcon doesnt have a projectile to rely on for gap closing, has no range to rely on either, and literally just has to run in there with a nair or upair (which is bad especially since he loses trades with shiek straight up. falcon being off stage is far worse than shiek being off stage)."

Marth: Fox (NOT Sheik! At the highest level, Fox's punish game on Marth >>> Sheik's and Fox has better tools in neutral) Sheik: Fox Jiggs: Fox Peach: Jiggs Falcon: Hm...probably Jiggs. People overrate how bad his other matchups are (Falco/Sheik/Fox aren't that bad).  ICs: Peach Pikachu: ICs (NOT Sheik!) Samus: Sheik   People kind of overrate how much Sheik kills low tiers . Sheik has CGs around the lower characters, but is susceptible to CC shenanigans and is combo bait in the air. Bowser actually has a 50/50 edgeguard situation on Sheik that if Sheik guesses wrong on the DI, she can actually die really early. I find that Peach's ridiculous hitboxes, strong defensive game and shield destroyers are  bit more effective for annihilating the worse characters of the game, though Sheik obviously still is a hard counter."

For example, DK might have an unwinnable fox matchup on paper, where he has no options in the neutral. However, if the DK player gets one good read, he has a shot at 0-deathing the fox. Against peach, he has to make a read just to land a stray hit that doesn't lead into anything."

But my point is there doesn't seem to be any basis for the judgement that falco has the upper hand on peach or many matchups with mid tiers actually.   Ppmd has arguably the best falco ATM so whenever he does not choose falco I would think that's a good indication of which mu falco is lacking.  Similarly, mango always chooses to play certain mus  with fox instead such as ICS, peach, Luigi (abate beat his falco).  Marth peach seemed 50-50 to me, but I don't know this mu too well. Is Marth peach indeed more like 60-40?"
SSBM,3e1eak,regready,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"Wait... you honestly think that Falco is disadvantaged against PEACH? I've heard it all. No offence but that's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard regarding Melee.  The match-up by most people is considered roughly even, and on paper it can be argued that Falco has the advantage. In no way do I think that Peach is winning the match-up, I find that laughable.   I think it's pretty clear that PPMD doesn't use Falco against Armada now because Marth is winning the match-up against her. Despite what some people believe, if played correctly Peach does not have a good-match up against top Marth play. Most importantly, The Falco/Peach match-up unlike the Fox/Peach and Marth/Peach is not as developed against Peaches of Armada's calibre therefore it seems one-sided. Meanwhile Armada takes advantage of this and goes to town on Falco's.  You're asking for an example? Fine. How about a couple of exampls both from this year. A top falco and top Peach.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA1Vdm13nAU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXRSyU0lYA4  Here's an example of from a couple of players a few levels below  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RL9W1zWOvM  Armada is the anomaly. He's been making match-ups look better than they really are his whole Smash career and that's because he straight outplays his opponents, he destroys their souls. He's the most consistent.

SSBM,3dz9xr,ContemplativeOctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"haha, I still think they're basically on par of in terms of quality of reads. But - because it was low ranked Plup playing with Samus and it was the chargeball, it does seem a lot cooler."
SSBM,3dz9xr,frog_wiz,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'd give it to Plup. Puff can decide whether or not to commit post-confirmation, but Plup had to actually see and commit to the future for this one, since Charge Shot hits about 600 frames after Rest hits."
SSBM,3dz9xr,EddyBearr,3,Tue Jul 21 12:29:41 2015 UTC,Lol 600 frames is ten seconds. I think your numbers are just a teensy bit off
SSBM,3dz9xr,CitizenShips,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:04 2015 UTC,Uh oh. My bad.
SSBM,3dz9xr,EddyBearr,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:48 2015 UTC,Plup didn't whiff a single grab in game 3. He landed like 5. Samus players are a special kind of player man.
SSBM,3dz9xr,l5555l,5,Tue Jul 21 06:26:07 2015 UTC,he whiffed one on ps in game 2 but leffens punish was... Uhh... Less than spectacular (starts with up and ends with tilt)

SSBM,3dz9xr,Squall94,25,Tue Jul 21 20:27:43 2015 UTC,He landed a 0-death twice on Leffen during his first two stocks in game 3 on Yoshi's - That was fantastic.
SSBM,3dz9xr,HeroEMIYA,9,Mon Jul 20 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"I pretty much laughed my ass off the first minute or so of that match. To be fair to Leffen, it was pretty close at the end though."
SSBM,3dz9xr,HelloYesThisIsRegent,11,Mon Jul 20 21:55:58 2015 UTC,winning   Blowing leffens head off with a charged shot multiple times and generally being a legend*  Ppmdkreygasm
SSBM,3dz9xr,spectremagic,9,Mon Jul 20 21:35:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was really fun to watch his Samus. Leffen looked lost at times.
SSBM,3dz9xr,NaitzurK,8,Mon Jul 20 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"That was the most badass thing I've seen this year in Smash, especially game 3 when he just straight took 2 stocks within the first few seconds."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Fershick,16,Mon Jul 20 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"That was the last beating I needed to see Leffen take before I could root for the guy. He took it so well, and he got wrecked so hard, idk I just like him more now."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Grimlokk,4,Tue Jul 21 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and how he behave after the GFs, the hug to Armada. I feel like he's way more friendly to everyone."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Sllanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:43:31 2015 UTC,"Same. I've even told Leften that I'm a fan of his stream, but root against him in tournaments lol. I just really wanted him to not win this Evo. I think I can let this grudge go now lol. don't care what happens in the next ones."
SSBM,3dz9xr,NY_Lights,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"Seeing Plup in top 8 at all was enough for me, absolutely love seeing him play"
SSBM,3dz9xr,CannaSwiss,4,Tue Jul 21 06:12:48 2015 UTC,I honestly felt burnt out after watching that game. It was such a crazy and amazing set and the games afterwards just couldnt really compare
SSBM,3dz9xr,TAC0J0E,64,Tue Jul 21 01:22:35 2015 UTC,"I think everyone wanted some sort of pp vs leffen vs mango grand finals just for the spacies matchups on the big stage. And with so many top players being upset, its no wonder a ton of real smash fans are upset.  But to the outside world, I think the show must've been great, there was great character variety, lameness was proven effective but still beatable, and the consistent underdog and master of 2nd place finally overcame his demon but still ended up 2nd. I bet smash 4 players and the fgc loved it.   And the fact that mango didn't get the 3vo kind of makes melee like real life. U don't get everything you want, but you can always work harder next time. Melees perfection is in its imperfection, people wouldn't be as huge fans of mango if he won everything, and he himself wouldn't seem so godlike if his lows weren't so low and his peaks weren't so high.   So overall, it wasn't the show that I personally wanted, but I think it's actually really cemented melee as something that is constantly changing and something that will never ever die."
SSBM,3dz9xr,phoenixwang,17,Mon Jul 20 19:43:41 2015 UTC,And the fact that mango didn't get the 3vo kind of makes melee like real life.   Sorta like...FD...  But I love this answer.
SSBM,3dz9xr,skwaag5233,11,Tue Jul 21 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"to be honest what really matters at EVO is the outside world's perception in getting new melee players so hopefully you are correct  we should be using a b05 tournament as our most prestigious anyway EVO is what it is a very cool tournament and huge for the scene but should never be the end all be all as far as crowning a champ   that said Mango,Mango,Armada being the champs the last 3 years still did a pretty good job at naming our best player"
SSBM,3dz9xr,FoxeRsmash,4,Mon Jul 20 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"Well unfortunately we can't really do anything about that since it's up to the TO's, and they have to run a timely event"
SSBM,3dz9xr,particlemaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:27 2015 UTC,Big house should be the new apex.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Anvillain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"Winners Finals (which are not being discussed enough, imo) were hype as hell, even with the 3-0. The same could be said of LFs. Now GFs would have been underwhelming if it had been a 3-0, but Hbox kept it close and the result was uncertain throughout the whole match, making it virtually as exciting as any other. I think the majority of the disappointment in this top 8 comes from the fact that Hbox is not a favorite for most people. Mango and PPMD and even Leffen now have many more fans, so their fans are disappointed not at the quality of play or level of hype, which were all extremely high, but simply at the fact that their favorites were not in GFs.  And then you can't ignore the Leffen v. Plup set, which has a case for most hype set of top 8. I would also give a nod to Mango v. HBox. Do you realize how huge of an upset that was? In spite of how it happened, it happened. No one saw that coming after Mango's seemingly endless domination over Hbox."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Ferdyshtchenko,55,Tue Jul 21 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"Like every year, it was good, but too short and annoying at times.  To sum it up : BO3 in top 8 shouldn't EVER be a thing.  It puts too much emphasis on game 1 because of the counterpick flow.It lacks nuance. It promotes cheese strats. It increases the importance of technical flubs and random factors like the infamous tree.  Look at all those BO3 top 8 sets that were tied as hell, 1-1 last stock situations. 3 games are not damn enough to decide a game at that high a level. All those BO3s aside from one were extremely tied and could have been turned around given enough games.   Overall I'm saddened that EVO is considered THE tournament of the year when it's that shallow. it was great, but that's the thorn in my enjoyement."
SSBM,3dz9xr,RaIshtar,16,Mon Jul 20 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"Best of 5's are definitely better for determining the better player.  Right now everyone wants to see the best player win the tournament, but having a tournament where upsets can occur more easily are nice too. Maybe not at EVO though.  It's like the NBA playoffs (BO7) vs NCAA March Madness (BO1)."
SSBM,3dz9xr,quuser,8,Tue Jul 21 00:38:04 2015 UTC,yo nba playoff's round 1 should be bo5 for some more upsets.  it sucks to watch a 4 game sweep it takes so long
SSBM,3dz9xr,jinzo2222,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:14 2015 UTC,I wonder if there's a solution to this? Maybe best of 5 top 6 could work?
SSBM,3dz9xr,RathKeno,6,Tue Jul 21 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"We could use flex sets for the first sets. Play 2 games. If it goes 2-0, you have a winner but if it goes 1-1 you play Bo5. So plup/ppmd and ppmd/hbox still would have only played 2 games, but plup/leffen and hbox/mango would have been best of 5.  In this case, 4 of the 7 games that were Bo3 went to game 3, so about half would have been Bo5.  And of course, Winner's/Loser's/Grand Finals would still be mandatory Bo5."
SSBM,3dz9xr,OrangeChris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:35 2015 UTC,That has the potential to be super long though if the sets are all close. I think they want to reduce that possibility.
SSBM,3dz9xr,RathKeno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think there really isn't any way around it, especially at Evo where smash is much longer than the other fighting games."
SSBM,3dz9xr,OrangeChris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"We finished 50 minutes early this year. Armada doesn't go all peach anymore and top players have more experience fighting puff, I can see flex sets being a thing vs. the time we are given."
SSBM,3dz9xr,jamaicanmecrayz,14,Tue Jul 21 17:05:28 2015 UTC,Plup and Axe vs. Leffen were some of my favorite match-ups this year.  I guess they weren't all winners but that happens a lot. At least it wasn't Grand Finals at Paragon. (lolm2k and such)
SSBM,3dz9xr,DavidL1112,6,Mon Jul 20 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. I feel Axe could have won the set if it was bo5, and Leffen would have won his vs Plup if it was extended as well. A shame it was so short!"
SSBM,3dz9xr,NY_Lights,24,Mon Jul 20 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"There wasn't a single fox ditto played in the top 8. Just from that standing, I'm satisfied, though I wish PP and Mango had played better.   They're probably my two favorite players to watch and they just didn't seem to have it going this tournament."
SSBM,3dz9xr,platzapus,8,Tue Jul 21 00:51:42 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way about PP and Mango, they're two of my favorites, but they didn't play at the level they have the potential to. Also about the fox dittos, I'm actually disappointed there weren't any, to each their own though!"
SSBM,3dz9xr,HavocA,2,Tue Jul 21 05:44:06 2015 UTC,Not sure how anyone can hate Fox dittos after Armada/Leffen's sets.
SSBM,3dz9xr,JFM2796,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:12:47 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, Fox dittos are crazy and when top level players are playing them, they're especially fun to watch! A GF fox ditto would've been so hype, especially if it was Mango vs Armada, Armada vs Leffen, or Leffen vs Mango. I must say top 8 needed more westballz though :'("
SSBM,3dz9xr,HavocA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"With Armada and Leffen, sure they're fast and have long combos, but you start seeing the same combos with the exact same edgeguards (grab ledge bair, jump an stage and bair again to cover high), and IMO it gets kind of boring since moving from one option to another is SUPER flowchart from the two. Mango is actually interesting in Fox dittos"
SSBM,3dz9xr,card28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I got my fix of Fox dittos from Mango/Leffen at Salty Suite, which was the only good thing about Salty Suite."
SSBM,3dz9xr,mathmage,58,Tue Jul 21 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"This sort of thing is pretty common in a bo3 format with tons of people watching. Unfortunately evo is not a smash-centric tournament so we can't really do anything about it. Puff is just easier to execute in high stress environments compared to spacies, which is why hbox usually does well at Evo. Not to say he didn't play amazingly."
SSBM,3dz9xr,CanItWait,34,Mon Jul 20 19:24:31 2015 UTC,"What we can do is stop considering Evo our ""world championships"". Make it anything else. I don't really mind that Apex is shittily run as long as the matches themselves aren't effected too much at the highest levels of the tournament."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Weis,119,Mon Jul 20 21:59:20 2015 UTC,Big house should be our world finals 100%:  It's near the end of the year and before winter starts  It's grassroots af and is hosted by the almighty Juggleguy  It has a history of great tournament outcomes and storylines
SSBM,3dz9xr,particlemaniac,10,Mon Jul 20 22:57:13 2015 UTC,Agree with this or CEO
SSBM,3dz9xr,Weis,16,Mon Jul 20 23:05:52 2015 UTC,"CEO is also great, it just doesn't have that grassroots aspect that can help out at times. Decisions will always be made at Big House to make the Smash better, but since CEO is multi-game the same won't necessarily happen. No offence intended to JeBailey though, that guy knows how to run a tournament and is pretty damn nice to smash"
SSBM,3dz9xr,particlemaniac,4,Mon Jul 20 23:08:04 2015 UTC,Did Big House drop PM? I forget if they did or not.
SSBM,3dz9xr,wickedfarts,8,Tue Jul 21 03:52:22 2015 UTC,BH5 only has Melee and Smash 4 this year.

SSBM,3dz9xr,jasonhalo0,4,Tue Jul 21 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I get why he's doing it but I still don't like it. Melee should be awesome though."
SSBM,3dz9xr,wickedfarts,2,Tue Jul 21 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"Also ceo is an fgc tournament just like evo. Our ""championship"" should be a smash event."

SSBM,3dz9xr,particlemaniac,2,Tue Jul 21 08:46:20 2015 UTC,"This isn't gonna happen, you can't just change people's perceptions. Genesis could take this spot as world championship only if Melee is no longer at Evo. Without Genesis it would probably have to be Apex like it was in 2012 and 2013 (before Evo was confirmed).   Interestingly, I don't remember there being many calls like this to replace Evo as the world championship in the last two times when Mango won it... just food for thought."

SSBM,3dz9xr,KG1639,2,Tue Jul 21 01:38:31 2015 UTC,I think it's better than apex and Evo
SSBM,3dz9xr,ChedduhBob,69,Tue Jul 21 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"It was pretty stale to me, Mango beat himself basically, PP wasn't playing well, the whole ledge camping debacle. The only real hype was the Plup samus."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Evisser,33,Mon Jul 20 20:54:30 2015 UTC,Mango beating himself wouldn't have happened in bo5.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Weis,8,Mon Jul 20 22:00:47 2015 UTC,If the set went two more games Hbox would have still had the DL counterpick. Hbox usually takes the DL game (and no others to be fair but still)
SSBM,3dz9xr,RGBJacob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see the stats for which stage mango usually loses to hbox on, I feel like dreamland wouldn't be dominant one way or another."
SSBM,3dz9xr,DrNagatocchi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'd be super dominant either, but I think every other stage would be very dominant in mangos favor so DL would still be Hbox's highest winning %"
SSBM,3dz9xr,RGBJacob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:32 2015 UTC,Mango usually takes the yoshis.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Anvillain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"That's true, Hbox could lose, but I honestly would favor him to take at least 1 game of the last 2 against any fox in the world on DL, even mango."
SSBM,3dz9xr,RGBJacob,12,Tue Jul 21 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"I think PP was playing about as well as he was at Apex (good, not great) actually. He had a notably better punish game on spacies, though his movement was more reserved. Just like at Apex, he was taken to game 3 by some lesser players and was forced to switch between his characters. Armada was just ready for him, and I think was a better player on that day (and in my opinion overall)."
SSBM,3dz9xr,qweyroiquoi,8,Mon Jul 20 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly don't know if PP could have beaten hbox at APEX. And despite the 3-0 losses to both hbox and armada, they were pretty close games. It always seemed clear that his opponent had a slight advantage, and ultimately the person playing better that day won. If I recall correctly though every one of those games went to last stock. It means 1 more gimp vs armada or avoiding a few rest set-ups vs hbox could have easily resulted in PPMD victories instead. Neat sets."
SSBM,3dz9xr,ReinDance,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:00 2015 UTC,Just because a player loses doesn't mean he wasn't playing well (in reference to PPMD).
SSBM,3dz9xr,Ferdyshtchenko,29,Tue Jul 21 14:35:04 2015 UTC,Only thing that didn't satisfy me was Plup having controller issues with his Shiek. I would have loved to see how far he could have gone.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Pwnemon,14,Mon Jul 20 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like he would have had a legitimate shot vs hbox and ppmd if he had his controller, I'm not saying he would be favored to win by any means but there would have been some hype-ass upset potential and maybe not 2-0s both times"
SSBM,3dz9xr,spectremagic,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:11 2015 UTC,Especially vs Hbox he kept it respectable. PPMD looked dominant but I'm sure it was a lot of controller stuff too. Like PPMD is real good at marth vs. sheik but plup also looked off his game.
SSBM,3dz9xr,ReinDance,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:50 2015 UTC,That really upset me too. You could tell from the first game vs PP that he was really struggling to shield drop and it cost him. He'd spot dodge/roll on a platform by mistake and eat damage for it. He eventually stopped trying at all and instead relied on his platform movement to kind of try and do the same job a shield drop would.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Lone_Sal_Bug,141,Tue Jul 21 06:40:37 2015 UTC,That tournament had way too much Jigglypuff in it.
SSBM,3dz9xr,ahampster,78,Mon Jul 20 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Like i know hbox is good but TBH4's top8 was super entertaining since it didnt have hbox. I truly think evo top4 would have been super exciting if mango beat hbox, but it was pretty lack luster."
SSBM,3dz9xr,kofinater,43,Mon Jul 20 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"APEX 2015 was great too, though it helped a ton Hbox wasn't planking.   TBH4 was definitely one of the best tournaments ever."
SSBM,3dz9xr,ahampster,18,Mon Jul 20 20:19:52 2015 UTC,TBH4 is my favorite tournament. So much good gameplay and unexpected wonkiness.
SSBM,3dz9xr,ewd444,17,Mon Jul 20 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Hbox stopped planking once Armada showed that he could safely challenge it as fox. If Mang0 had done the same, Hbox probably would have stopped planking in that match as well. He is all about gimmicks. If you can't beat the gimmick he will keep doing it. It is part of why he is a frustrating player to play against."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Elkram,24,Tue Jul 21 00:31:46 2015 UTC,Mango normally challenges ledge camping harder and more successfully than most. He just bustered and SD'd too many times this Evo.
SSBM,3dz9xr,pkblaze78,8,Tue Jul 21 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"And like I said, Hbox was using the planking because Mang0 wasn't being successful at stopping it. I don't see how our comments contradict."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Elkram,6,Tue Jul 21 03:08:46 2015 UTC,"pkblaze is saying Mango lost because he SD'd. You're saying he lost because he couldn't stop the planking. Lets be real dude, Mango got kills off the side with fsmash and bair, that was his strategy against the ledge camping and it was working. The only problem was... he halved his own stocks by killing himself twice."
SSBM,3dz9xr,RufflesTheMonkey,68,Tue Jul 21 08:03:51 2015 UTC,"I hate how right Mang0 is when he says he is Melee Jesus.  Hbox did great and deserved the win, but that was just not as hype to watch lol. I enjoyed it, but my mind didn't get blown after Plup beat Leffen."

SSBM,3dz9xr,kofinater,6,Mon Jul 20 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"For sure. It's too bad people assume Apex is the ""pinnacle"" of Melee play when there's so many examples of matches they display more skill and understanding while still being more hype than some Evo matches.  It was a fun tourney, lots of stories going in, but so far TBH4, Apex, Press Start etc. Were more fun"
SSBM,3dz9xr,Trandovski,3,Mon Jul 20 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"I think that makes the loss even harder for Mango because when he was trash talking Leffen at WTFox he talked about how he saved the last two Evo's for Melee with his exciting play. I don't think he just wanted to beat H-box, I think he wanted to destroy his ledge-camping playstyle."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Grimlokk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"Just imagine, if Hbox made top 8 at Big House we wouldn't have got Mango/Lucky."

SSBM,3dz9xr,EddyBearr,4,Tue Jul 21 12:31:27 2015 UTC,"I think it felt like a lot since the sets were so long and the last 3 matches were all Hbox, but yeah it did get a bit repetitive"
SSBM,3dz9xr,particlemaniac,2,Mon Jul 20 23:06:18 2015 UTC,I felt that. It felt like a funeral in the viewing hall when jiggs was on the screen. The plup v leffen and axes match were way hype though. I totally respect hbox and how goddamn good he is but it's just not as fun to watch.
SSBM,3dz9xr,RocketBun,2,Tue Jul 21 09:33:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really mind if this was any other tournament, but for it to happen at pretty much the most watched tournament of all time... yeah.. pretty lame."
SSBM,3dz9xr,koopa77,10,Tue Jul 21 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"Tbh, hbox kind of blew my mind with his game plan. He wasn't just holding back planking. I understand people not wanting to watch Puff vs. Peach or a Puff ditto, but Puff vs. spacies is super cool imo. Both characters punish the mess out of each other and the neutral game is really interesting. It isn't as simple as just camping vs. planking.   So yes, I'm pretty satisfied with EVO this year. I'm glad the same thing doesn't happen every year. Although I have to admit, it's probably somewhat due to the Bo3 format; seems to create a lot of random upsets. What year at EVO have we actually had a complete GF that people anticipated? Or even Loser's Finals for that matter?"
SSBM,3dz9xr,PurpleKiller,8,Tue Jul 21 05:24:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely not super hype, but very interesting to watch nonetheless.  Still, I just hope both new people and veterans of the scene start taking EVO with a grain of salt. Bo3 is not a good format."
SSBM,3dz9xr,nikovan_smash,4,Mon Jul 20 21:15:07 2015 UTC,It's funny that it took Mango losing to Hbox to get people to realize this. You know no one would care if Mango made it to grands.
SSBM,3dz9xr,JFM2796,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:09 2015 UTC,Exactly. No one complained about this in 2013 or 2014. A lot of people complaining about Bo3 or the 'satisfaction' of top 8 are simply complaining because their favorite didn't make it to GFs.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Ferdyshtchenko,9,Tue Jul 21 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"Plup v Leffen literally had me out of my seat, otherwise I was mostly bored by it. I still watched every minute, and enjoyed it, but I wasn't very excited. That's not to say it wasn't exciting as a whole, it just didn't do it for me...probably just because of how good Saturday was."
SSBM,3dz9xr,LWD3,67,Mon Jul 20 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, not at all.  Call me what you will but I was heartbroken after Mango was knocked out.  I had more fun watching Marvel vs Capcom and Street Fighter."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Onomatomanic,50,Mon Jul 20 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"Regardless of people's love/hate for Mango, it always sucks to see a top tier player like that have 2 SD's in a crucial game."
SSBM,3dz9xr,lawlsmagawls,13,Tue Jul 21 00:11:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't need to see him play but those SDs were daggers.  I'm not even a big Mang0 fan but to see him not even get a real shot at the last game really hurt.  The story line was so about Mang0, Leffen and PPMD to me too so the GF felt kind of weird, but I still loved it.  Top level Melee is always good."
SSBM,3dz9xr,CannaSwiss,6,Tue Jul 21 06:14:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything would top Street Fighter though, that was pretty damn incredible."
SSBM,3dz9xr,d4b3ss,19,Tue Jul 21 06:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel the same."
SSBM,3dz9xr,GlassOfWatah,39,Mon Jul 20 21:09:49 2015 UTC,Tbh hbox matches are pretty boring and always go 4-5minutes and i realllly wanted to see pp vs mango or mango vs armada so im kinda sad that the top8 had so much puff vs spacie matchups...hbox destroyed the hype matches for me :/
SSBM,3dz9xr,elpotento,28,Mon Jul 20 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"HBox played great and all (props to him) but top 8 was lacking good matches to watch because of that little pink balloon. I don't wanna say HBox ruined EVO but for me personally, he did. -_-   Edit: Forgot to add that Plup played amazing and I'm now a fan."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Janglez515,5,Mon Jul 20 22:37:54 2015 UTC,"I personally thought is was better than Evo 2014, and probably as good as Evo 2013. Some unfortunate stuff happened (Plup's controller, Mango's SDs) but I thought It was a good change of pace from what we've been seeing this year. I guess I'm the only one who found the advancement of the ledge-camping meta interesting as well. It's always nice to see new things, especially on a high-stakes stage like Evo."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Killer_Gum,20,Tue Jul 21 02:38:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is just character bias since I play puff but I really love watching puff-fox, it's one of the most interesting matchups to me, so I enjoyed it"
SSBM,3dz9xr,RGBJacob,12,Mon Jul 20 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"fox-puff is my favorite matchup as well, it has this crazy tension where either person could die from anywhere on the stage at almost any percent. definitely slower paced than spacie matches, less flashy combos, but hype in its own way"
SSBM,3dz9xr,reese_ridley,8,Tue Jul 21 02:02:35 2015 UTC,"It was okay. Axe vs Leffen was decent, Plup vs Leffen was amazing, Armada vs PPMD are always great sets. ChuDat vs Mango was okay, it could of been a lot closer but Chudat flubbed multiple early wobble chances.  I did think the first Armada/Hbox set in Semis was good just because we could clearly see that Armada did his homework. Very great use of d-tilts.   To be honest, last years top 8 wasn't amazing either  Fox vs Puff and YL vs Puff for example.  As far as actual storylines go though, I felt like Armada was destined to win it this time regardless of Leffen's recent dominance or Mango's ""3VO"" legacy. I had the same feeling I had for PP at Apex. Despite Armada's recent struggles, he came out on top where it mattered. Great potential ending for the upcoming Smash Film Feat. Armada"
SSBM,3dz9xr,regready,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"That wasn't Chu flubbing, that was Mango with some insane mashing and SDI"
SSBM,3dz9xr,card28,15,Tue Jul 21 19:36:57 2015 UTC,It was a bit underwhelming to be honest. Lots of Hbox shit goong on that I don't enjoy watching. Usf4 top 8 was godlike.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Lalo1212,4,Mon Jul 20 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly just disappointed in not seeing Mango vs. PPMD, because 1) it's such uncharted territory and 2) we're probably not gonna have a chance to see it again until Apex...."
SSBM,3dz9xr,SkyKnight34,3,Tue Jul 21 03:59:16 2015 UTC,"PP might still go to Big House though, right?"
SSBM,3dz9xr,notsocrazy24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:50:23 2015 UTC,He has promised to attend many more tournaments in the near future. Hermit PP might be a thing of the past.
SSBM,3dz9xr,OathToAwesome,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:53:34 2015 UTC,He looked pretty disappointed in his 3rd place defeat. Not going to tournaments and getting 3-0'd twice once you face Gods must be a wake up call!
SSBM,3dz9xr,NY_Lights,19,Tue Jul 21 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, except for two things: 1.  Watching Mango lose due to SD's was disappointing. 2.  The puff vs. fox meta has evolved into something that is no fun to watch."
SSBM,3dz9xr,ryanmrf,22,Mon Jul 20 22:19:25 2015 UTC,Honestly I hate playing puff more than anyone but absolutely love watching fox-puff. The ledge camping really never lasts that long and the neutral has fascinating interactions. Every up throw up air could be an early kill for fox or an sdi->conversion for puff. Watching hbox string a couple aerials together and get a rest or a gimp is also super exciting.
SSBM,3dz9xr,syc06,8,Mon Jul 20 23:40:04 2015 UTC,I think it's mostly just Hbox vs Armada and Leffen.  The Swedes run away and laser.  Hbox responds by ledge camping.  Against other foxes it's more entertaining.
SSBM,3dz9xr,ryanmrf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:15 2015 UTC,"This could be true if speaking only about Winners Semis, but go back and watch Grand Finals and you will honestly not be able to say this."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Ferdyshtchenko,34,Tue Jul 21 14:40:09 2015 UTC,Don't like hbox anymore.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Frumpis_,6,Tue Jul 21 00:12:55 2015 UTC,How do you feel about Armada laser camping?   Hbox only camped against Armada who was camping him right back. It's shit that Hbox is copping all the flack
SSBM,3dz9xr,thrillho145,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:14 2015 UTC,When there’s little difference between him playing to win and playing to stall I'm not sure what's left to appreciate.                  The grand finals might have been done over netplay based on how much Hbox wanted to interact with Armada.
SSBM,3dz9xr,FeelsASaurusRex,7,Tue Jul 21 06:54:21 2015 UTC,"What? Were we watching the same GF?  Hbox in Winner's Bracket timed Armada out. Hbox in GF was much more dynamic and aggressive.  GF was pretty exciting, there were a couple of moments where I wasn't even sure if Hbox would reset the bracket or not, and it wasn't through cheesing. He hardly took to the ledge, at all."
SSBM,3dz9xr,roboticphish,20,Tue Jul 21 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"I found Top 8 extremely satisfying and enjoyable. While we missed out on Armada vs Leffen, Leffen vs Mango, etc., we are going to see those matchups dozens of times in the future so I'm not too worried. I never pictured Hbox going this far and especially being able to beat Mango. I mean when you look at the bracket and see Plup vs Leffen and HBox vs Mango, how many people would think that will result in HBox vs Plup? To me, that made the tournament really exciting because it didn't play out in a way I would expect. It reminds me of March Madness where the tournament is really enjoyable when there are a lot of unpredictable upsets.  I don't really agree with everyone thinking HBox's play was boring. The neutral between Fox and Puff is insanely tense where both characters can get touched and then die. I really enjoyed watching HBox when he got the 55% range just weaving in and out of danger and picking his spots. It was really intelligent and cool play imo. It might not be Mango flying around the stage with Falco pulling off ridiculous aerial combos, but it's exciting in its own way. This game isn't only about the Falco vs Fox matchup even if it's the flashiest and fastest.  I'm surprised at the amount of hate HBox's planking got. I mean he is playing a matchup where Fox has multiple, easy ways to kill him at 50%. What do people want HBox to do? Why are people not instead critical of the fact that it is perfectly viable to play Fox by running away and racking up damage safely and then going in for an easy kill move (not saying they should be, just playing devil's advocate)? I think it is extremely impressive that HBox has found a way to take down top Foxes and continue playing at a high level during a time when more and more people are playing Fox and Fox play is getting better and better. I think people are just upset that HBox found a way to beat Foxes that doesn't involve him going for a rest every 15 seconds and doing flashy grab combos."
SSBM,3dz9xr,np2392,0,Mon Jul 20 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"i agree that the neutral between fox and puff is tense and pretty exciting to watch, but can you say the same about planking?"
SSBM,3dz9xr,satpreplol,5,Mon Jul 20 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"actually yeah, I get the same feeling with hbox on the ledge as I do when M2K is dashdancing"
SSBM,3dz9xr,reese_ridley,7,Tue Jul 21 02:03:54 2015 UTC,Can you say the same about laser camping? It goes both ways.
SSBM,3dz9xr,burritonacho,5,Tue Jul 21 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"I really hate this. Every ignores it when foxes runaway and laser camp or m2k ledgestalls, but puff is always given shit, no matter how the player actually uses puff, people complain."
SSBM,3dz9xr,HppilyPancakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:21 2015 UTC,because puff is a lame ass character and when he's played even more lame ass then you get double lame ass gameplay. he can be less lame ass if played more aggressively
SSBM,3dz9xr,adlp,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:09 2015 UTC,But puff is forced to play agro more often than not. Hbox was approaching for most of the tournament if you actually study the vods. People are just biased and don't like the way it looks even if it's agro play.
SSBM,3dz9xr,PurpleKiller,12,Tue Jul 21 15:54:09 2015 UTC,"no, its boring to watch jigglypuff plank half a set while armada laser camps. Its boring to watch jigglypuff in general unless its in teams"
SSBM,3dz9xr,SpudSSBM,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, aside from Plup, Drugged, and KJH, it was fairly boring throughout the entire tourney.  I wish West made it farther, i feel like a better impression could have been given to the 200k viewers if they saw westballz vs a stylish falcon or something.  My favorite moment was honestly when SW recovered by wavelanding off Randall and air dodging on stage.  It seems so obvious, but it looked so nice."

SSBM,3dz9xr,WireDxEntitY,2,Tue Jul 21 05:23:29 2015 UTC,Nah chu wouldve double eliminated m2k  Edit: 16 stocking him in marth dittos with his one hand marth
SSBM,3dz9xr,edqiao01,3,Tue Jul 21 10:32:12 2015 UTC,It was so satisfying. I've been waiting so long for the Armada evo pop-off. I think he is one of the least appreciated gods and plays the game in a very beautiful way.
SSBM,3dz9xr,KreatorExodus,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's one of the least appreciated. Everyone knows how good Armada is, and how he basically reinvented Peach, but I do think he doesn't have a hardcore fanbase like Mango, Hbox, PP, Leffen and M2K do. I think the reason for that is because his personality is that of a stone-cold killer; he's not flashy or charmingly cocky as Mango, he's not as marketable or recognizable to new players like Hbox, he's not a villain like Leffen, he's not a southern charmer or rare sight like PP, and he doesn't have the multi-game appeal or recognition of M2K. Armada is just all business, and I love it. That pop-off made me smile so hard, I almost shed a tear. I really hope he continues to do well at nationals this year.  Great username, by the way."
SSBM,3dz9xr,HallowedBeThyBrain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure everybody knows how good he is. I've just always felt that he deserves more fans but I'm also the biggest Armada fanboy there is. I think he's a genius. And thanks dude."
SSBM,3dz9xr,KreatorExodus,5,Tue Jul 21 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't want to sound biased, every match after plup v leffen was pretty boring. I understand that you can't really play puff in an exciting way (and expect to win) and props to Hbox for winning such a difficult matchup so many times against top level foxes; buuuut his matches were all boring as shit. Every stock was him kicking the air underneath the side platform for 4 mins then getting upthrow uaired 4 times. There's not many ways to make marth and fox boring characters to watch, but hbox managed to do it. GFs were cool, but I felt like the entire time I wasn't watching a tournament, it felt like I was just waiting for armada's imminent victory and it made it a lot less exciting when he won."
SSBM,3dz9xr,ContemplativeOctopus,11,Tue Jul 21 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"So much Puff completely killed the hype for me personally. Someone in Twitch chat was like ""12 year old meta game kappapride"" when Hungrybox was doing his thing... this kinda hit home. It just could have been so much more."
SSBM,3dz9xr,sourfang,7,Mon Jul 20 23:17:57 2015 UTC,Hungrybox just made top 8 boring to me. Nothing against him though.
SSBM,3dz9xr,AJF99,10,Mon Jul 20 23:46:52 2015 UTC,Honestly seeing how successful hbox was this year clawing it out against the top Foxes was crazy. Maybe more puffs will start studying those matches now and really becoming threats in bracket. That would make things more fun.
SSBM,3dz9xr,Big_D_Squirrels,5,Tue Jul 21 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"Loved plup's samus, loved hungrybox's run, loved leffen being exposed, but didn't like ppmd's seemingly short run, mango's choke, axe's non-upset. I mean you can't have it all and overall I liked it, big congrats to Armada, but I agree there was some more potential. I'm just upset I have to wait for more melee.   Also, chu didn't do much in top 8 but him just being there was awesome."
SSBM,3dz9xr,syc06,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:51 2015 UTC,he brought mango to last stock. wouldve won some games at least if he didn't drop and wobbles.
SSBM,3dz9xr,bashdemears,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah not knocking him at all, I was hugely impressed, just would've been sick to see him win a game/set, but just being there made it a better top 8."
SSBM,3dz9xr,syc06,4,Tue Jul 21 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"Not really, Plup vs. Leffen was amazing, but other than that it was pretty boring. It didn't help that Mang0 lost the 3vo and HBox was ledge-camping a lot which tends to kill hype."
SSBM,3dz9xr,GrammerNaziParadox,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"Very satisfying, Armada is my favorite player, and I'm not a Mango fan. Yeah, you can't ignore the SDs, but I was happy to see Hungrybox take the set."
SSBM,3dz9xr,TyroneBrownable,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:04 2015 UTC,I agree with you that top 8 was not very satisfying.  No one was really playing well and it felt like  most of the matchups we got to see were Puff vs a floatie or a terrible display of Puff vs Fox with that whole ordeal.  A lot of the matches we expected or wanted to happen like Mango against Armada or Leffen or the two swedes facing off never happened.
SSBM,3dz9xr,ALvl1337Magikarp,5,Tue Jul 21 15:37:08 2015 UTC,It was not as hype as i predicted it to be alot of slow paced matches the best part imo was plup vs leffen
SSBM,3dz9xr,Wars-,5,Mon Jul 20 19:30:28 2015 UTC,it was fuckin great man
SSBM,3dz9xr,Cushy,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:38 2015 UTC,Too much puff but yeah it was good. Glad Armada was able to stop him because no one else would've. Perfect end to the documentary.
SSBM,3dz9xr,ewd444,3,Mon Jul 20 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"I get that it boils down to personal preference and all, but I don't see why everyone finds Fox v Puff so boring. Yes it can be campy, and yes it can be lame, but between two truly excellent players it becomes this amazing war of attrition with occasional bursts of activity. Stocks can disappear instantly, and there's no such thing as a lead in Fox Puff."

SSBM,3dz9xr,krispness,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"Hbox ruins melee, so boring to watch him play, I felt bad for the new people watching top 8 cuz it wasn't entertaining to watch hbox camp everyone, it's suppose to be a fast pace fighting game, I wish he would quit already"
SSBM,3dz9xr,Blueonn,9,Mon Jul 20 23:43:35 2015 UTC,"No, it's supposed to be a smart and complex game that you're supposed to win. It can turn out slow. It can turn out fast. It looks slow and campy but if you were to break down Hbox vs Armada's young link, whats happening there is a very complex and unforgiving neutral game."
SSBM,3dz9xr,bashdemears,3,Tue Jul 21 00:27:58 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKAZabrGU3A  Not saying he's right but I agree with the opinion in this video.
SSBM,3dz9xr,quuser,4,Tue Jul 21 01:23:55 2015 UTC,"But watching chaingrabs for days, or lasercamping, or any of the many ledgestalling tactics is a-okay? Honestly, Armada vs Hbox (the fox-puff ones) series this past year have all been fairly exciting until relatively recently. Each one of them were intense and interesting because there was a real, constant tension in the game, something that few other series have brought IMO.  Not only that, but Hbox's emotional outbursts make the game way, way more entertaining from my perspective as well."

SSBM,3dz9xr,NY_Lights,4,Tue Jul 21 15:13:00 2015 UTC,Everyone is saying the puff got boring but it really didn't for me. I thought it was really refreshing to see hbox go so far with puff and we got to see some matchups happen that usually don't (plup vs leffen hbox vs ppmd.) Although I do agree gf was a little boring because of the laser camping at least it was pretty close. This is all coming from an hbox fan though. Also I didn't mind not seeing armada vs leffen or leffen vs mango or vice versa because we have been seeing that since apex at most of the big tournaments. Oh and Plup whipping out the samus!!

I think the biggest let down for me was the top 8 commentary. Don't get me wrong I like Scar, I like Toph and I even like when they commentate together, they give good bits of info that are helpful for new viewers. But there's something about how they reminisce and get off topic and spend way too long on something that's not relevant to the match that frustrates me. A large part of the hype for me is the announcer getting hype for big plays on screen and where they are talking about an inside joke or bickering it hurts the presentation on the world stage."

Hopefully this shows new comers to smash that you can main other characters than fox and be successful!"

Hbox beating mango was kind of a let down because while puff is okay for a match or two, I get bored of it quickly and would be preferred plup or mango to play pp and armada, would've been amazing."
SSBM,3dz9xr,Whimby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I can respect Juan playing to stall.                I don't think anyone would be satisfied to watch someone play when there’s little to no difference between them playing to win and playing to stall.                         I believe playing to stall against someone for extended periods of time defeats the purpose of playing such a cherished game in person. (Hbox's Fox MU sets might have well be done over netplay...) With EVO at stake its fairly logical to do but its a dangerous precedent to set.                    It reminds me of Brawl metaknight and I don't think its ""the solution"" to the Fox MU at all."

SSBM,3dy5jg,EdwinDexter,27,Mon Jul 20 17:05:58 2015 UTC,Darkrain is actually really good at the ditto though. Gatzhu 5-0'd a rusty Darkrain back in 2014. Darkrain when he practices is beastly at the Falcon ditto and I'm almost certain that the MM would have went very differently if Darkrain wasn't rusty.

Leffen and Armada give him lots of trouble and as Leffen said post WTFox, he refuses to change core mistakes like double lasering from the edge and not learning to shield drop.  I love Mango, but he really needs to lab up if he wants to keep up."

SSBM,3dy5jg,qweyroiquoi,6,Mon Jul 20 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why everyone got so salty over the prospect of Hbox winning.   Calm the fuck down, you'll still get to mash buttons like an idiot with Fox, Jesus. You people are acting like everyone would switch to Jiggs if Hbox won."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Frostav,26,Mon Jul 20 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"Let me help you out with that then. This evo was the biggest melee tournament ever. Hungrybox got to grand finals using a VERY campy playstyle which is, for the most part, not indicative of how melee is played. It's nothing to do with people switching to jiggs, it's to do with it being boring as fuck and a fairly lackluster conclusion to what should've been the hypest melee tournament yet.  Don't get me wrong, Hbox played very well and probably would've deserved his win had he got it, but most of us just don't want to live in a world where someone can win Evo playing like it's Sm4sh."
SSBM,3dy5jg,kr4yt,10,Mon Jul 20 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"Well really hbox has gotten to grandfinals the last 2 years and the year before that he made it to losers finals, so there is always a lot of him since he always makes it so far. Hbox also really wasnt camping all the time especially in his match against ppmd and I think it does show very well what melee is, which is a game that can be played many ways even if we have 'no character variety' as some like to say."
SSBM,3dy5jg,vexoskeleton,18,Mon Jul 20 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with playing like that. I think it's smart for hbox to play like that. If he doesn't he would be fuuuucked. The match up is getting worse and worse for puff in today's meta, so he did what he needed to. Foxes camp puff out too. They're just hitting more buttons than he his. They also can go in with better options that's why they don't do it more. Puff slows it down, takes it to his pace and once he sees an opening will take advantage of it. Yes it's more boring but it got him that far. Its not always about watching it. Its still a game they are playing to win."
SSBM,3dy5jg,zombieINFECTD,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not knowledgeable enough about the matchup to comment on whether it's necessary for hungrybox to play this way, I was just explaining to the other guy why people would've been salty had he won. Very few people enjoy watching this kind of thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRw-OTIXfEM&t=50s . Hungrybox get's the first stock then goes straight to the ledge and basically continues to play that way for the entire rest of the game, looking to get cheap gimps on Leffen. That's fucking lame, whether or not it's a justified way of playing the game. Personally if it were me I'd take absolutely no joy from winning in that fashion.   Fox does laser camp quite a bit in the puff matchup, however they are still on the stage and are considerably more approachable than someone (especially a jiggs who fucks fox in the ass when theyre both offstage) whos sitting on the ledge. And the extreme amount of laser camping from Leffen and Armada in the evo sets specifically was caused by Hungrybox camping the ledge, he started it."
SSBM,3dy5jg,kr4yt,6,Mon Jul 20 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all. Those two have been increasingly laser camping Puff all year. Hungrybox has had to adjust to their approach, not the other way around."
SSBM,3dy5jg,gazer89,20,Mon Jul 20 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of hbox winning because he doesn't appeal to me as a player.  Really he found out that back air was good, spammed the crap out of it until he got figured out, then introduced a bag of rest setups into his flow chart, finally a few other aerials, and a couple other tricks like rolling lots on his last stock as a mix up. He doesn't adapt mid match, he doesn't train like the other guys, he says that puff isn't that great of a character when really without her he wouldn't have gotten anywhere, and he johns for his losses instead of innovating with some tech-chase rests, platform cancelled aerials, better movement, more rest setups, etc.   Those fox players aren't mashing buttons like idiots, and if they are what does that say about hbox who's spacies are only as good as a mid level players? I main puff, so who are these ""people"" you're even talking to?  It's totally just my opinion but hbox doesn't come off as genuine to me as a competitor either. I don't like his obnoxious pop offs, that he sits and mopes on stream when he loses, that he's so emotional, that he asked his fans to pay for his money matches, that he's completely different in person than he is on stream, that he abuses top player privellage, asks for free shit from fans at tourneys, and will never play friendlies with anyone who isn't good.  Sure whoever wins in the end is the one who deserved it, I'm just really glad it was Armada over him."
SSBM,3dy5jg,qweyroiquoi,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:39 2015 UTC,Plus he always has to fucking point out how he's better than the other gods because he was in school and how he's got an engineering career john.
SSBM,3dy5jg,itskisper,5,Mon Jul 20 23:24:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  As a new-ish player and spectator of Melee, I like HBox for some of the reasons you dislike him. Dude has stayed at the top level of play while holding down engineering school and after this summer a job. He beats some of the best players some of the time in a matchup heavily weighted against him. He does this with gimmicks, and it's always neat to see him bring out a new gimmick; rollout at Sandstorm to get two kills on Leffen, ledgecamping at FC Return and Evo, it's always interesting to see what trick he busts out next. ""If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid"". The way he exposes the other top players with stupid gimmicks that shouldn't work is important for the metagame, in my opinion.  I don't see how you can judge him by how genuine you feel like he's being, though. The top players are good at video games and that's the only qualification they need to be on that stage. If he makes efforts these days to look like a good guy on camera (like all the other players besides maybe M2K do), that's his business. It must be super hard to play this game at a high level when half the people watching hate how you play and boo you; if he want to act out a little act to make less people boo him and more people cheer for him, I don't think people should criticize him for that."
SSBM,3dy5jg,the_noodle,4,Mon Jul 20 20:00:44 2015 UTC,You kind of missed my point. My point was that everyone was acting like an Hbox win would result in Melee's meta stagnating into camping and Puff overload. I don't really get that.
SSBM,3dy5jg,Frostav,10,Mon Jul 20 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"I think the point the last two people were trying to point at is that no one ever implied the meta changing to more camping or stagnate into puff overload. Honestly, im not sure where you got that idea that people were insinuating that was the case. I think most everyone just wanted to be super hype for the biggest Smash tournament to date. Hbox's matches, due to his character and his style, are extremely boring to watch and imo just made everything really anti-hype. Rewind to apex where we had a losers bracket reset between armada v. ppmd and you'lll understand. That entire set had everyone on the edge of their seat, the level of play was phoenominal, and was so incredibly hype for fans of both sides.   The grand finals match for this Evo was easily my least favorite match on stream and it was freaking grand finals. Grand finals should never be that anti-hype. I personally don't get the appeal of Hbox and i'm surprised when i see people get hype over him. qweyroiquoi put it very well, he's got a lot of things going that aren't all that appealing to a lot of people. The dude plays the meanest puff and he deserves credit where due for his wins, but that doesn't really change anything in terms of spectator enjoyment. I knew that as soon as he made it to grands, he wasn't gonna take the win. If pp advanced i knew there would have potentially been a close fight and a much more enjoyable match to watch; A GF match that I REALLY would have rather watched than the one that happened.  What you said:   I have no idea why everyone got so salty over the prospect of Hbox winning.  Calm the fuck down, you'll still get to mash buttons like an idiot with Fox, Jesus. You people are acting like  everyone would switch to Jiggs if Hbox won.   If you don't want to imply things you don't mean, you should really choose better wording on your opinion. The past two posts were replying to your misunderstanding of why people are salty of the prospect of Hbox winning. The second statement of fox is quite ignorant, as fox players aren't just mashing buttons; Fox is an incredibly difficult character. The post sounded incredibly passive-aggressive overall, which provokes response. You really shouldn't be surprised."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Azureflames20,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"I missed your point because it isn't accurate. I explained to you why I and others don't like hbox winning, which has nothing to do with fear of puff dominating the meta. If anything I'd invite more puff players."
SSBM,3dy5jg,qweyroiquoi,47,Mon Jul 20 23:55:29 2015 UTC,If you've seen any play between Mango and Leffen since WTFox you'll know he has stepped it up as he won nearly every set.
SSBM,3dy5jg,ewd444,23,Mon Jul 20 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"Leffen also had decently weak play through most of the tournament, at least in my eyes."
SSBM,3dy5jg,grc_tv,12,Mon Jul 20 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"Right, but so did basically everyone. A few people (I think silentwolf being one of them) actually tweeted out how bad everyone was playing at EVO. Armada did pretty well, but wasn't full potential, which is no big deal. So did hungrybox. But the rest of the top players didn't seem to be able to play their best, even plup made some unfortunate mistakes because of his controller, though his run was awesome."
SSBM,3dy5jg,yomi338,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Evo was very hype this year, but I wish players played to their fullest potential. Would be too much to ask for, though."
SSBM,3dy5jg,grc_tv,30,Mon Jul 20 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"There have been no tournaments since WTFox. If you are talking about friendlies and money matches, I guess, but the real wins are in tournament."
SSBM,3dy5jg,nikovan_smash,12,Mon Jul 20 15:47:18 2015 UTC,But you're telling Mango to step it up and he has visibly adjusted his plays since his last losses and has seen positive results.
SSBM,3dy5jg,ewd444,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:34 2015 UTC,"Lol, I guess his marth and fox ditto money matches were legit."
SSBM,3dy5jg,ContemplativeOctopus,8,Tue Jul 21 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"Mango totally stepped up his game for EVO. I think you're being too results oriented.  All props to Hbox, but I don't think a lot of people believe if they played 3 bo3s or 5 or whatever that Hbox would've come out on top that day.   Mango vs PPMD would've been so hype I'm really sad we didn't get to see it."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Royo_,15,Mon Jul 20 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"And I agree with that. Me myself I did not expect to see HBox break top 4. But let's be honest about Evo Mango. Close sets with Chu, sent to losers by Plup. Do you remember 2014 Mango? Unstoppable. I felt his gameplay this EVO was unusually sloppy, not so much his usual Mango mistakes, but overall carelessness."
SSBM,3dy5jg,nikovan_smash,10,Mon Jul 20 17:58:59 2015 UTC,Lucky said that he thinks Mang0 needs to stop being mang0 if he wants to win. He's 26 and his age is catching up with him he can't keep going to bed at 4am and showing up hung over. He also doesn't want to learn like many other tops players. Lucky also said that after Evo mango was probably taking a break
SSBM,3dy5jg,Pineapple_Tommy,15,Mon Jul 20 17:32:49 2015 UTC,he isnt 26 lol
SSBM,3dy5jg,Foxdyfx,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:56 2015 UTC,Lol my bad. How old is he?

SSBM,3dy5jg,jacobpilawa,5,Mon Jul 20 18:48:53 2015 UTC,I don't know that's just what Lucky said on stream.
SSBM,3dy5jg,Pineapple_Tommy,4,Mon Jul 20 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"He drank at the Apex salty suite (I have confirmation), got shitfaced at CEO (I saw him personally), and he was drinking significantly at WTFox as well (he said it on stream).  Evo was pretty much the only tournament he restrained himself/took seriously, but I guess you can't half-ass 6 months of smash and expect to just make everything work as Mango was hoping."
SSBM,3dy5jg,throwaway2676,5,Tue Jul 21 00:07:33 2015 UTC,"That's Mango's strength and weakness. Mango has always been like this. Mango won't go hard until he has to. When Mango triggers beast mode he is goddamn unstoppable.   In the salty suite, Mango was down 0-2 vs Leffen and just turned it up and won 3 games straight (ending with Leffen rage quitting because Mango was just damn ridiculous).  At WTFox, during the during the 2v1 with M2K and Armada he was scary as hell.  Look at the games against Plup again and you'd see Mango turn it up last stock. Mango just has a history of having trouble with Sheik (specifically M2K's) and Plup was really on point.  The problem against HBox was after he SD's twice, he wasn't able to essentially 2stock HBox that match.  Loser's Mango is probably the scariest player in all of Melee. I was convinced that Mango would have gone all the way if it wasn't for those SDs."
SSBM,3dy5jg,ShortFuse,15,Mon Jul 20 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I couldn't see Mango going all the way at all. PP looked good, but even if Mango made it to grands I don't think he had a shot against Armada. I understand that the last time they played Mango clutched it, but two sets against the current best in the world, who was also playing on point is just too much. Mango was playing too sloppily to beat PP or Armada imo."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Luma_not,23,Mon Jul 20 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"PP really wasn't playing on point. He was kinda struggling a bit throughout the tournament. When I saw his set with Hugs and Plup, I didn't think he could take it versus Armada. Loser's Mango looked a lot sharper than PP did the whole tournament.  Out of curiousity, did you catch Mango at the salty suite? He obviously was ready for the Fox ditto.  Edit: Of PP, Hbox, and Mango, I think Mango had the best chance to challenge Armada."
SSBM,3dy5jg,ShortFuse,4,Mon Jul 20 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"At the Salty Suite I saw Leffen dominantly win 2 games, then get shaken and absolutely crumble in the next three. There were a few moments where he made mind bogglingly bad decisions, like in game 5 where he fell onto on obvious u-smash trying to beat it out with a nair instead of just double jumping away. I don't think that Mango looked ready to do it against an on-point Armada.  Also, Mango didn't really look that much sharper than PP, he lost to Plup(who PP took out fairly easily), he scraped by against DruggedFox, the games with Chu were distinctly too close, and he lost to Hbox. The fact is that Mango lost to a non-god, then struggled against two players and characters that he should consistently dominate. PP wasn't playing incredibly well, but Mango looked incredibly shaky.   Also, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think Hbox was the second best player at Evo. He was clutch, he was consistent, he beat the most gods out of any player there. Four times in Evo he played amazingly against the best Foxes in the world(and masters of Fox v. Puff). Besides Armada, Hbox definitely looked the crispest out of the top players at Evo."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Luma_not,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that PP was playing very off the second day, just like Armada. However, I did think he was playing well against Armada on the final day, he just didn't have an answer to Puff which is clouding his overall performance. All his games against Armada were last stock games, he absolutely did play well against him. His combo and punish game were on point, if he got an opening he would convert it into big combo if not a kill, his recovery was on-point it's just that Armada looked like someone that did his homework and wasn't getting baited for the same things as much, unlike Apex. He was getting outplayed.  As for Mango? Armada is not only up in sets life-time against Mango, but also this year which is the most important thing. If Mango had faced Armada with the way they both were playing? I think Armada would of won the game one Ditto and it's GG from there. The difference between WTFox and EVO is that Armada was playing good, even Leffen was saying how Armada was off at WTFox which I think is fair, people let alone Armada himself rarely ""John"" for him because he's usually consistent. A lot of it is just mentality and winning when it matters, I don't think we should ever use a Salty Suite as an argument for someone's progression.  Honestly, it looks like while Mango and Leffen were focusing on the Fox Ditto match-up the most for the Summer, Armada was focusing on some of the other match-ups such as Fox/Puff, Fox/Marth and Fox/Falco. Which according to Leffen is actually the case. This does make sense when you consider his CEO performance where he dominated everyone in until he met Leffen and got dominated himself. Leffen has been putting mad-work into that match-up.  On the other-hand Armada has struggled against Hbox recently, more than Mango at least. He barely beat him at Sandstorm to the point where some say Hbox should of won, he lost the last time they played just two weeks ago to the planking strategy. As for PPMD? The last time they played Armada got 3-0'd convincingly. We can say that Mango is overall a better player than Hbox and PPMD but I think for Armada, the formers were tougher opponents. Not to mention that Hbox and PPMD use Marth and Puff, two characters he struggles against, compared to Fox anyway.  In short: I think Hbox and PPMD were bigger threats to Armada than Mango."
SSBM,3dy5jg,regready,4,Mon Jul 20 19:09:10 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with that. Leffen and Mango are the only two players that can put a dent on Armada right now. I was impressed with the fact that HBox was able to make the GF 3-2, though.  PP got demolished 3-0 when they met in winners. And HBox demolished PP as well."
SSBM,3dy5jg,nikovan_smash,3,Mon Jul 20 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"The set with PP was 3-0 but they were close games. Stop looking at just the numbers and look at the actual set, the gameplay. The Hbox/PP set was destruction but I already answered that.  Also, I agree with Leffen being the most likely person to take Armada out. I just don't agree with Mango, especially with how he played at EVO. I think Hbox and PPMD were definitely more of a threat given their history with Armada this year."
SSBM,3dy5jg,regready,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:28 2015 UTC,"If I really wanted to argue, I could say that closing a set is the deciding factor between two good players, but I can agree with you."
SSBM,3dy5jg,nikovan_smash,5,Mon Jul 20 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"Agree with all of this, I think mango/leffen had the biggest chance of beating armada. I think if mango didn't throw away his set to hbox, we'd see him win over broken-controller-Plup and PP. Armada would have been much tougher especially for 2 sets, but mango had been practicing for him and I think at the very least it would have been a crazy grand finals regardless of who won."
SSBM,3dy5jg,P_2,5,Mon Jul 20 18:41:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mango could have beaten Armada who looked sharper than anyone by a mile (except vs Silentwolf), but PPMD did not look good to me. Other than his win against Plup, all his wins were shaky at best, and he got destroyed by both Armada and Hbox."
SSBM,3dy5jg,sdw9342,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:01 2015 UTC,You have a good argument for him not beating armada (even though I think he could've) but I'm not agreeing with PPMD being able to beat him. PP wasn't playing that great and only beat non gods to get to where he was. Don't get me wrong it probably would've been a great set but I think mango would've pulled through. But we'll never know so what ever lol
SSBM,3dy5jg,crankthatjose,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:16 2015 UTC,"Mango also only beat non-gods to get through, the only god he played throughout the tournament was Hbox, and we both know how that went. Mango also lost to Plup, who was very handily defeated by PP.  Also, this is probably an unpopular opinion, but Hbox outplayed Mango. The second game was an excellent match which Hbox clutched out. Mango was clearly mentally shaken going into the third game, and Hbox, even though he played sloppily, capitalized.   Mango was just being recklessly aggressive, this wasn't calculated bursts like his other great runs. If he had beaten Hbox I think that PP would have shut him down fairly easily in the neutral."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Luma_not,2,Mon Jul 20 18:27:27 2015 UTC,I think Leffen quitting was more of him not caring about the set.  He's already proven he can beat Mango.  So he didn't really have anything to gain from that set besides a tablet.
SSBM,3dy5jg,throwawayforsmash,13,Mon Jul 20 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"He focused so hard on practicing to best armada and leffen at the ditto, then fell to a shiek and jiggs. Now that's real disappointment, he couldn't even show what he was working for."
SSBM,3dy5jg,jamaicanmecrayz,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:58 2015 UTC,I know it was Bo3 but he really shouldn't underestimate Hbox the same with leffen. But then again I think hbox was just on fire he took armada to game 5 and almost reset the bracket.

SSBM,3dy5jg,reddit409,66,Mon Jul 20 21:19:00 2015 UTC,"mang0's fifth placing. in the grand scheme 5th is great at EVO, but after all the '3VO' hype and lead-up to this tournament it stung to see him go out that way. i have no idea what those two SD's on yoshi's were--nerves? technical sloppiness? bad luck? probably a combination of all three. hbox's ensuing strategy to ledge camp worked against mang0 in the sense that it put him on tilt, imo. that's, like, the antithesis of mang0.  question is, will this light a fire under his ass for next year? or will this be the beginning of his decline and entry into the full-time streamer's lifestyle, moving away from the top echelon of competitive smash?   the worst part? this means he won't be switching full-time to falcon ;_;"
SSBM,3dy5jg,onehunna,36,Mon Jul 20 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"I feel that if Mango won Evo he would have never taken a tournament seriously ever again. Armada winning is the best outcome, because now that he has a legacy that disputes Mango's there's an incentive for the kid to try again."

SSBM,3dy5jg,themagicalcake,43,Tue Jul 21 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"This is an unpopular opinion, but here goes. Mango is on the decline. He approached the tech skill ceiling faster than any other fox and with his smart, aggressive play style he got very far ahead of the rest of the scene.   These days, you need to be more disciplined. Hit the film room, study your opponents, learn to adapt your playstyle etc. Mango's showing at EVO shows he's not doing that.  Compare his games vs hbox with Armada's and it's so clear. Both players saw hbox planking at WTFox. Armada came prepared with d-tilt, Mango just looked flustered and lost.  Edit: Oh whoops I meant FC Return, not WTFox. Had it in my head cause Toph kept saying it like /u/j00t said."
SSBM,3dy5jg,alotofdavid,26,Mon Jul 20 16:11:46 2015 UTC,I know this is going to sound insane but I swear to god Hungrybox was not at WTFox. And I attended that tournament so... yeah. If he was there then I am a crazy person. Just because Toph said Hbox was at WTFox several times doesn't make it true >_>
SSBM,3dy5jg,j00t,13,Mon Jul 20 17:01:08 2015 UTC,He was at FC Return
SSBM,3dy5jg,DarthBane_,12,Mon Jul 20 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they meant FC. That's where HBox showed up and started planking everyone. Since Leffen won both in similar ways they may have blended together in their minds."
SSBM,3dy5jg,HortonHearsAGenocide,17,Mon Jul 20 17:23:03 2015 UTC,HURRAY I'M NOT CRAZY
SSBM,3dy5jg,j00t,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:01 2015 UTC,You're still crazy. Just not for that reason.
SSBM,3dy5jg,apengeriser,56,Tue Jul 21 02:36:25 2015 UTC,"Until the SDs he was in very good shape vs Hbox. Game 2 was fine and he is great on dreamland. The SDs basically determined his entire EVO run.  I mean, Armada nearly lost the GF set to Hbox, so it's not like his play style of the matchup was vastly superior."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Doctor_Teh,8,Mon Jul 20 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"although i dont disagree with you, i want to point out hbox didnt plank in gfs, he just didnt some crazy punishes"
SSBM,3dy5jg,brandong567,6,Mon Jul 20 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"True, but the planking really didn't seem to be why he beat mango, just that he did it once he was in a huge lead"
SSBM,3dy5jg,Doctor_Teh,5,Mon Jul 20 20:25:10 2015 UTC,He didn't plank because he was almost always behind in percentage.
SSBM,3dy5jg,Espi_BC,7,Mon Jul 20 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I think Mango takes winning against HBOX as a given, but if he just did a little studying or maybe even just watched the game against Armada he might have come prepared. Hungrybox did nothing wrong and shouldn't get hate just for winning when Mango clearly didn't know how to act against the Puff ledge camping. I'd go as far as to say HBOX would have possibly had the chance to win EVO if he didn't introduce the ledge camping sooner. I think Armada had time to adjust to the strat just in time to win."
SSBM,3dy5jg,webtoon,25,Mon Jul 20 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with this. Mango really had hbox beat. Even with the planking and 2 suicides (which is absurd for a top player) mango almost won game three. He assumed he didn't need to study hbox, and I think he was right: mango ultimately lost to mango, not hbox."
SSBM,3dy5jg,chopu,8,Mon Jul 20 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"While what you say has merit, I think the ledge camping was getting to him and making his nerves worse. If he knew what HBOX had up his sleeve (which is kind of a gimmick, but a one that worked) Mango would have probably had that extra edge for him to win."
SSBM,3dy5jg,webtoon,5,Mon Jul 20 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"True, the ledge hopping seemed to give hbox the mental advantage over mango. It's hard to say since mangos play was so sloppy the whole day. Really disappointing run from mango either way."
SSBM,3dy5jg,chopu,3,Mon Jul 20 17:05:46 2015 UTC,I agree. I like Mango but he really wasn't up to his full potential and it must have been devastating and the worst way to go out.
SSBM,3dy5jg,webtoon,3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:39 2015 UTC,Hbox choked it up too. Like the time he got hit by fox's up b on the edge where he could have just rolled up.
SSBM,3dy5jg,Dublshine,15,Mon Jul 20 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"It's funny how everyone just assumes that the most recent tournament placings are all that matter when judging how someone is playing. If you look at his game footage as well as money matches and stream, you'd see that he's not on the decline at all. Mango is playing better than he ever has before. It's just that Armada and Leffen are finally at the point where they have a fox that challenges them, there are new sheiks (Plup, Shroomed, & maybe Druggedfox) that he wasn't ready for since he typically bops m2k without much effort, and his set with Hbox was a giant choke (he should have won game 2 and 3, but made dumb mistakes). If he hits the lab, he'll continue to be in the top 3 or so, depending on how things pan out."
SSBM,3dy5jg,adustbininshaftsbury,16,Mon Jul 20 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"Mango does have a winning record against m2k but I wouldn't go as far as to say that he bops m2k without much effort. They always have pretty close sets for the most part, including their most recent set at what the fox (although neither of them played too well)"
SSBM,3dy5jg,LucasZero,7,Mon Jul 20 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, he definitely doesn't bop M2k without much effort. All of there games are super close, or its one sided to m2k or mango."
SSBM,3dy5jg,DarkLava,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, he lost in an unfortunate way but he prepared strictly for the peach and fox ditto matchup. And I don't blame mang0 for not worrying about Hbox, mang0 has like 90% win rate over him."
SSBM,3dy5jg,GlassOfWatah,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"but after all the '3VO' hype and lead-up to this tournament it stung to see him go out that way.   Saw it coming. He's been playing poorly for the past few tourneys, there was no way he was going to take EVO all of a sudden."
SSBM,3dy5jg,mutoeien,34,Mon Jul 20 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting that some of the gods took a hit. Mango and Leffen were both eliminated by Hbox and Plup; a lot of people speculated whether Hbox would ever again beat a top Fox. PPMD also had a slightly disappointing ending to his run; even though all but one of the games were close, he got 3-0'd twice."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Sidisphere,36,Mon Jul 20 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"PP's run was interesting, I think the stars aligned for him to get third. He wasn't playing particularly well, but some how made it to winners finals.   I wish Plup didn't mess up his controller so I could confidently something take good away from the 2-0.  Still though, he took third while  not playing at 100%, which I think is a testament to his skill. Him playing bad is still good enough to clutch his way to top 8. I can't wait till he has another dominant tournament like Apex 2014."
SSBM,3dy5jg,ShrugSmash,8,Mon Jul 20 16:28:31 2015 UTC,The controller problems sucked so bad for him. He missed so many opportunities (even some basic down throw follow-ups). I think that Plup seriously stood a chance of making it to winners finals if his controller hadn't overindulged in beer the night before.
SSBM,3dy5jg,sefazures,22,Mon Jul 20 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"I kind of want to say PP had a lucky bracket. We all know he has the potential to place 1st at his best, but at EVO I wasn't convinced. His set against a worried-about-controller Plup was definitely less difficult than a set against Mango would be.  ugh Florida why did you have to ruin EVO loool If you're both gonna beat so many top players at least win the tournament"
SSBM,3dy5jg,reddit409,7,Mon Jul 20 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"he didn't even play a god until WFs, right?"

SSBM,3dy5jg,holographicmew,2,Tue Jul 21 01:14:33 2015 UTC,He never went on tilt and still looked solid despite not playing up to his potential. I'm excited for the upcoming months of PPMD.

SSBM,3dy5jg,SpaciesJam,24,Mon Jul 20 16:33:44 2015 UTC,Watching him get eliminated from Evo by losing to Samus yet again...  Was painful to say the least
SSBM,3dy5jg,qweyroiquoi,37,Mon Jul 20 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"A little bit painful, a little bit funny, and a little bit deserved for not learning the Samus matchup. He admitted that himself, and I don't think he'll make that mistake again."
SSBM,3dy5jg,SpaciesJam,9,Mon Jul 20 17:15:47 2015 UTC,As a Fox that's been hella struggling with the Samus MU more than any MU in the game I just feel his pain every time he gets missiled/CC'd/etc.
SSBM,3dy5jg,ShrugSmash,10,Mon Jul 20 17:24:04 2015 UTC,"It seems like a tricky matchup to learn. Plus, Samus isn't exactly a common character, so your chances of having a good Samus to practice with aren't as good as they might be with other characters."
SSBM,3dy5jg,sefazures,5,Mon Jul 20 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair he probably didn't expect to have to play a Samus in top 8 lmao. Good old Plup picking Samus for fun because he'd lost his motivation to play seriously (because of his controller issues), and then beating the favourite to win the tournament anyway"
SSBM,3dy5jg,JackFU,9,Mon Jul 20 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like Plup didn't choose Samus for fun, I mean, Leffen is known to hate the MU."

SSBM,3dy5jg,Octane_Twisted,4,Mon Jul 20 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"I get you. My pick was Armada and both sets vs Hbox I was at the edge of my seat almost crying. It's just funny because the personalities are very different. Leffen has a huge mouth. I love the guy, but I coouldn't help but imagine chillin rapping in the background"
SSBM,3dy5jg,reciac,39,Mon Jul 20 18:09:17 2015 UTC,Honestly think Leffen on day 2 (top 32 bracket) played the worst he has since Press Start. Sunday top 8 looked a lot better but I guess he ultimately still wasn't quite prepared enough for Plup's Samus.
SSBM,3dy5jg,ramskick,5,Mon Jul 20 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"Well said.  I was sure that Leffen was going to win until I saw him play on Saturday.  He looked extremely vulnerable, the only time he looked like a top 5 player was against Ice."
SSBM,3dy5jg,grandpaseth18,59,Mon Jul 20 20:09:05 2015 UTC,"Shroomed lost to Javi and Santiago to get only 25th, when he was expected by some to make top 8  aMSa lost to Light and Hax to get 25th, which is probably where he should be, but his yoshi is so cool that I wish we got to see more of it."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Yrale,32,Mon Jul 20 14:36:37 2015 UTC,Shroomed isn't a safe top 8 pick until he gets better vs. spacies imo.
SSBM,3dy5jg,Jamarac,4,Mon Jul 20 15:36:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. He has been shit vs spacies for a while now and I thought that had changed after the great play at CEO vs Mango but it looks he was just on fire that day.
SSBM,3dy5jg,ricknad,9,Mon Jul 20 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"I personally expected aMSa to at least get like 13th, but hax isn't a bad loss"
SSBM,3dy5jg,sefazures,4,Mon Jul 20 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"The Peach matchup is really bad for Yoshi. I feel like aMSa running into Peaches will always have a good chance of him losing. It's not quite Peach-Icies but it's bad.  And as for Hax, I feel like a Fox that plays like Hax is probably the worst kind of Fox player for aMSa to run into.  amsa is definitely above top 32 level but it really depends on his bracket... I guess it depends on how important you consider consistency when measuring skill"
SSBM,3dy5jg,SheldonH44,35,Mon Jul 20 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"How has no one said Colbol? Tenth on the MIOM Top 100, yet only placed 49th."
SSBM,3dy5jg,reciac,43,Mon Jul 20 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"Colbol's MIOM 2014 ranking is not really that accurate for him in 2015 anymore. He definitely hasn't been close to being a top 10 player in a longer time now.  Colbol barely had any noteworthy performances so far this year. Other than Hungrybox and Plup (he usually loses to both of them) who he plays on a regular basis in Florida I can hardly think of any other top players he has actually beaten this year. I suppose Sfat at Paragon but that was back in January. Nintendude at BMR comes to mind too but after that I already start running out of notable players.  Also had a lot of questionable losses to people like KDJ, Twitch (twice), Gahtzu etc.  Honestly I expected this kind of Evo perfomance by him."
SSBM,3dy5jg,qweyroiquoi,22,Mon Jul 20 16:28:09 2015 UTC,Colbol's top 10 placing wasn't even accurate for him in 2014. He won the MIOM popularity contest when really there were like 8 or 9 players with better results than him.
SSBM,3dy5jg,SheldonH44,4,Mon Jul 20 17:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think what adds to the disappointment is seeing the other big dogs from Florida perform so well, just to see Colbol flop so hard."
SSBM,3dy5jg,Xrmy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:38:41 2015 UTC,This. I did not predict colbol to even get 33rd.

SSBM,3dy5jg,just_dan,18,Mon Jul 20 18:48:41 2015 UTC,KK was my most disappointing one. I have been a big KK fan for a long time and want to see him get back to his old form before he took a break.
SSBM,3dy5jg,AppleAssault,41,Mon Jul 20 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"Druggedfox with the game in his hands against leffen unable to clutch it out, then two nailbiter losses to mang0. Win either of those sets and who knows where he'd have finished"
SSBM,3dy5jg,theguynamedtim,21,Mon Jul 20 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"Although the way he went out was disappointing, I don't think anyone can say his run was disappointing.

SSBM,3dy5jg,DarkReapingX,13,Mon Jul 20 20:34:07 2015 UTC,Silentwolf was definitely my dream pick that got squashed. Such a close set vs Armada only to get wobbled 8 (Q_Q) times by Chu Dat in losers. Washington's lack of a really good Ice Climbers definitely showed.
SSBM,3dy5jg,jinzo2222,4,Mon Jul 20 19:31:36 2015 UTC,played out of his mind first 2 games vs armada.  could have easily been a 2-0.  and the ic's thing is spot on

SSBM,3dxni4,jugglingguitars,7,Mon Jul 20 12:24:23 2015 UTC,Hijacking your thread a bit but I'm having trouble figuring out the timing for the shield drop when someone does an aerial on your shield. Do you move the joystick down during hit lag? Or after?
SSBM,3dxni4,graylunarmake,7,Mon Jul 20 14:38:57 2015 UTC,During. You'll buffer a shield drop this way and it's the fastest.
SSBM,3dxni4,jlap1n,6,Mon Jul 20 16:01:22 2015 UTC,I couldn't find this information anywhere. Thank you!
SSBM,3dxni4,Epic563,3,Mon Jul 20 16:16:31 2015 UTC,Does this only work for the fully horizontal-->one notch down method or can you buffer the slight angle one as well?
SSBM,3dxni4,Im_French,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:45 2015 UTC,I think you can even buffer a shielddrop with an input so hard it would normally make you spotdodge.
SSBM,3dxni4,Eideeiit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:01 2015 UTC,"From what research I've done, if you shield stop while holding a direction and during hitstun drop a notch like a ""normal"" shield drop, you'll shield drop on the first available frame. This seems to be the easiest way to do it, but i'm not sure it would work if you just slight angled down."
SSBM,3dxni4,jlap1n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:17 2015 UTC,"Buffering shield drops are a little awkward to explain. The gist of it is, imaging these are the last 7 frames of shieldstun. And each option means to start holding it on that frame will produce a shielddrop on the first actionable frame.  1 -   2 -   3 - Full down, Centered angle, Diagonal angle  4 - Full down, Centered angle, Diagonal angle  5 - Centered angle  6 - Centered angle  7 - Centered angle  Actionable - Centered angle  But it isn't quite as simple as that. When you move the stick to any point, you are more often then not be inputting a frame or 2 of the inbetween angles. Inputting a downward tilt before 3 will stop the full down and centered angle from working, but you can start the input with a downward tilt and be holding fulldown/centered angle by the actionable frame.  Holding left/right before hitting the diagonal angle will actually give you a larger window, as you are preemptively disabling roll. So as long as you start holding left/right on 4 or earlier, you can input the diagonal angle anywhere from 3 - actionable"

SSBM,3dxni4,Hariooo,4,Mon Jul 20 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"If you press down to drop through a platform and then press and hold a jump button to float, you will lose your double jump when you float. This is what armada is talking about.  However, I THINK if you return your stick to neutral first after dropping through, THEN press down and a jump button to float, you will float without losing your double jump. Tested this a bit myself and that seems to be what's going on (in which case armada would be wrong), but I haven't done so rigorously/in TAS or anything so take it with a grain of salt."

His Falcon play definitely reminds me of Falcon Hax. In a lot of ways, you could make the argument that he has the better Falcon right now. He is patient when he needs to be, which a lot of Falcons just don't do. His placings are getting much better and is taking players like leffen to much closer games and sets.

SSBM,3dxp8h,alton312,48,Mon Jul 20 11:52:19 2015 UTC,I think the difficulty of extremely consistent and effective smash DI is overrated and as a result it's not used to its full potential. The fact that people are still being upaired x3 off upthrow is ridiculous for example.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Jamarac,20,Mon Jul 20 12:10:12 2015 UTC,"One huge thing that everyone forgets, SDI on this is based off of where exactly and how exactly the fox hits you with Up air.   If Fox uthrows and I DI behind and then SDI in the first time he tries it, I may escape because Fox went too far behind me. If, the next Uthrow I do the same DI but he doesn't shoot as far, I get hit by Uair because I should have SDId the other way.   Avoiding Uair by SDI is a bit of mindgames and heavily dependent on what the fox player does. Additionally, it is extremely more difficult to SDI away if Fox hits you really deep (you have to SDI down and away I believe, which people don't do)."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Xrmy,5,Mon Jul 20 15:53:11 2015 UTC,"SDIing fox's uair is hard just because of how random it is where you get hit. It's so dependant on which direction fox is running, how much airspeed he has, how deep into the hitbox you get hit, and how far you are to each side. There's no guaranteed consistent way to SDI it and reading which way you need to is pretty difficult to learn. I'm sure people will improve in the future but at the moment even the players with the best SDI are still getting hit by it at least 50+% of the time even when they sdi."
SSBM,3dxp8h,ContemplativeOctopus,3,Mon Jul 20 22:02:21 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. It always irks me when people talk about SDI needing to improve for people.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Xrmy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:39 2015 UTC,By really deep do you mean more in his legs rather than his feet? Like with a falling uair.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Reesch,4,Mon Jul 20 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"Yea kinda. Check out the frame data  Ok what you need to get from this is that you need to sdi far enough away that the second hitboxes don't getcha. So, naturally, if you get barely clipped by the top of the top first hitbox, you don't need much asdi to get far enough away from hit2. Conversely, should you get hit by the middle of the lower hitbox of hit 1 (I.e fox is all up in your butt) you may not have enough time to SDI away far enough away to not get hit by hit2, and is also significantly more challenging to get the inputs."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Xrmy,6,Mon Jul 20 21:09:14 2015 UTC,Are there times where the person would not be able to smash DI out of Fox's upair? Like say if Fox upairs Marth directly in the middle of him?
SSBM,3dxp8h,DarkLava,7,Mon Jul 20 15:22:15 2015 UTC,If you only do 1 input maybe but 2 inputs + ASDI should be more than enough
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:21 2015 UTC,I thought that ASDI overrided all forms of Smash DI? Or is that just for the direction?
SSBM,3dxp8h,DarkLava,3,Mon Jul 20 18:08:41 2015 UTC,Let's say there's 5 frames of hitstun hitlag (thanks /u/daftatt). On frames 1-4 you can I put SDI as many times as you want. On frame 5 you can SDI but if your c stick is moved you will ASDI which is less than normal SDI and that will follow the c stick direction
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:42 2015 UTC,OK So it looks like this:    Frame SDI/DI Direction    1 SDI left Left   2 SDI left Left   3 SDI left Left   4 SDI left Left   5 SDI left and ASDI up Up    And the last frame not being as powerful because it was by the c-stick?
SSBM,3dxp8h,DarkLava,5,Mon Jul 20 18:23:23 2015 UTC,hnng chart formatting kreygasm  I fucking love this sub
SSBM,3dxp8h,Daftatt,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:00 2015 UTC,Yeah but you can't input the same direction twice because the game will read it as you holding the stick there so you'd need to go up and left -> left -> down and left -> left
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:47 2015 UTC,"So theoretically I can get out of Fox's upair by simply doing a quarter circle (maybe more than once) with my control stick?  P.S. I apologize if I'm asking all these questions lol. I just want to make sure I have it all right, so I can go practice it."
SSBM,3dxp8h,DarkLava,3,Mon Jul 20 18:42:45 2015 UTC,Yes but it's a very tight timing. QC SDI is the best way to do it AFAIK.
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,2,Mon Jul 20 19:00:52 2015 UTC,Doing a half circle is more reasonable for humans because the stick is moving for a longer amount of time so if you slightly miss time it you're more likely to still get some sort of sdi input instead of missing it entirely.
SSBM,3dxp8h,ContemplativeOctopus,11,Mon Jul 20 22:05:22 2015 UTC,I think a big part of it is how hard it is to get it up to a high enough level where you can implement it into your play. If I'm trying to learn anything from shield dropping to wave dashing all I need is an opponent do I can do it over and over until I can do it every time and know when it's best used. Learning the timing for SDI is much harder just because you pretty much need a fox and normally to implement these you want someone worse than you because you can make more mistakes and still survivor. A worse fox than you won't get many grabs so you basically need to tell them that yo just want them to uthrow uair you which is pretty boring for them
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,9,Mon Jul 20 13:52:22 2015 UTC,You can practice SDI every single time you get hit vs a player of any skill level. The reason my SDI is pretty solid is from years of getting bodied by my region's top level players when I spent most of my time getting combo'd
SSBM,3dxp8h,Jamarac,6,Mon Jul 20 14:21:51 2015 UTC,You can practice it but there's a finite amount of moves where it will have an immediately obvious impact
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,12,Mon Jul 20 14:26:52 2015 UTC,"They're scenarios that come up pretty commonly. ie. Fox's upair, fox's drill, falco's pillar combos, peach's dair, falcon upairs etc. etc. etc.  SDI can be used in so many situations that you can practice it every match you ever play."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Jamarac,4,Mon Jul 20 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"Again, though these need you to be reactively practicing tech rather than proactively. You need to realize that you got hit and then do it.   I'm not saying not to practice I'm telling you why so many don't. It's a much larger investment than learning other tech and everyone has tech they need to learn. Also most other regions don't have 3 foxes in the top 4/5 so yeah you're going to have more opportunity to practice it."
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,3,Mon Jul 20 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"Do you know if there's a way on 20XX to practice smash di by having a cpu up throw-up air you repeatedly? I know the commands to get cpu to spam lasers and simple things but that seems hard, and my sdi could use some work"
SSBM,3dxp8h,rapemybones,4,Mon Jul 20 17:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's a command. It's not going to vary the timing / spacing of the upair as much as a human will but it's a good start."
SSBM,3dxp8h,the_noodle,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks, I gotta look up how to do that and practice it tonight!"
SSBM,3dxp8h,rapemybones,2,Mon Jul 20 20:16:23 2015 UTC,I'm sure there is a command to make fox uthrow up air you. You can parctice it vs human opponents too.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Jamarac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"You can do this in 20xx. I really need to make a video showing all the stuff you can practice, because there's so much you can do in 20xx that no one seems to know about."
SSBM,3dxp8h,cherubthrowaway,5,Tue Jul 21 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"Those multiple up-airs can be a result of attempted (and missed) SDI.   For example, Fox up-throws, you attempt to SDI up, but miss the timing. Now you've input DI up, setting yourself up for another easy up-air.   On the other hand, you could ignore SDI and focus on DIing out, meaning you'll probably eat that first up-air, but have a much better chance of escaping successive ones."
SSBM,3dxp8h,OrangeDoors,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:15 2015 UTC,I'm not saying people aren't trying to SDI enough I'm saying they should be getting it more often. Axe is a testament to how consistent you can be with it.. That guy's success with it is like 90%. When Hbox is onpoint he has close to 100% too. There's no reason why everyone (especially floaty players) shouldn't be doing at least close to this consistency rate.  I'm also talking about SDI in general not just on upairs. There's such an insanely diverse uses for SDI and I think people don't try and take advantage of all of them as much as possible because it's seen as a difficult technique that won't ever be consistent. I disagree with this.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Jamarac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:48 2015 UTC,Is it easier with Pikachu because his character model and thus hurtboxes are smaller?
SSBM,3dxp8h,the_noodle,4,Mon Jul 20 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"pikachu secondary, can confirm smash di is easier with pikachu."
SSBM,3dxp8h,bomono3,4,Mon Jul 20 20:28:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot of times the pro players space upair so only the second hit connects but you are right"

SSBM,3dxp8h,Jamarac,33,Mon Jul 20 16:20:12 2015 UTC,Maybe not the most but goddamn Sheiks need to learn the neutral against spacies. Right now only KK and Plup have any idea what they're doing in neutral against spacies
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,3,Mon Jul 20 13:54:14 2015 UTC,A lot of sheiks also mess up their chain grabs and their punishes/tech chases.  I haven't really seen a sheik nail both their neutral game and their punish game. Plup has done it on occasion and KK has done it before but there isn't a sheik who can do it consistently.  Kira and DruggedFox are on point with chain grabs but their neutral games are weak.
SSBM,3dxp8h,jaesuk97,3,Mon Jul 20 23:47:03 2015 UTC,Chaingrabs really aren't important.  There's only one relevant matchup it's even difficult to do in. Techchases are way harder
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,7,Tue Jul 21 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"DruggedFox was doing gorgeous techchases that I feel that need to become the core of the Sheik v spacies meta. But yeah, neutral game is a problem. Thing is, how do you deal with the two best neutral games in the game effectively?"
SSBM,3dxp8h,nikovan_smash,8,Mon Jul 20 15:38:39 2015 UTC,Amazing movement and zoning with arguably the best projectile in the game.
SSBM,3dxp8h,stickity,9,Mon Jul 20 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"Arguably. Both lasers are just as good, if not better. No charge time, less lag... It's not an easy pick."
SSBM,3dxp8h,nikovan_smash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"Sheik needles are better than fox lasers. If fox wants to laser camp you he'll get hit by your needles and your needles do much more damage along with inducing hitstun, which fox's don't. One of sheiks best tools in neutral is short hop needle someone's shield. It puts them in enough hitstun that you get a free grab off it. If you're a bit slow they'll still probably roll which you can chase easily."
SSBM,3dxp8h,ContemplativeOctopus,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:08:58 2015 UTC,They all auto cancel...
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,13,Mon Jul 20 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"you cant throw needles across the stage from the air.  you cant deal as much damage as fast as fox with them.  you cant needle and approach or retreat like falco does.  Needles are good, but they have downsides that lasers don't. They also have upsides that lasers don't. It's a tradeoff."
SSBM,3dxp8h,nikovan_smash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"I think you are underating the ability of needles to string combos together and edgeguard. In neutral it's probably Falco>fox>sheik, but for getting kills and doing cool shit it's sheik=/=falco>>>>>>fox."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Vacumpencil,-3,Tue Jul 21 21:28:36 2015 UTC,But they all have the same endlag
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,5,Mon Jul 20 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"Can you use a single needle like a jump cancelled short hop falco laser? That was the comparison I was trying to make, sorry if I did not word it better."
SSBM,3dxp8h,nikovan_smash,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:56 2015 UTC,Can you throw a needle to snipe a fox's illusion? There is no comparison to be made  Also it isn't a jump cancelled laser. It's just s short hop laser. The cancel is an auto cancel from landing. Jump cancel means you cancel an animation by jumping
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,3,Mon Jul 20 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"That's what i meant, damn.  And what do you mean by the snipe? I honestly can't see Sheik using her needles in the way Falco uses his lasers to control space and move around."
SSBM,3dxp8h,nikovan_smash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:11 2015 UTC,This is mostly because every sheik was just carbon copying m2k for the longest time and m2k plays marf against spacies.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Vacumpencil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:54 2015 UTC,He actually would play sheik until he lost a game where he'd play Marth of FD then stay Marth. The real reason is that he'd camp ledge and go for gimps not tech chases which doesn't work anymore
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:21 2015 UTC,Ah you are right he'd always try dreamland sheik before FD marth.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Vacumpencil,0,Tue Jul 21 21:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'd include Shroomed as another Sheik with a good neutral game.   Unfortunately, her neutral does seem undeveloped in general after M2K's approach to it."
SSBM,3dxp8h,OrangeDoors,18,Mon Jul 20 16:12:46 2015 UTC,No his neutral is pretty terrible compared to the rest of his game. Watch his set vs Leffen then Plup's set vs Leffen at CEO and the difference is night and day. Same with their sets vs Westballz
SSBM,3dxp8h,A_Waskawy_Wabit,26,Mon Jul 20 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"boom and i make the joke all the time that 64 is end game melee. not (just) because every hit converts into a kill, but because of a lot of shared mechanics that are used fundamentally in 64 but are or only starting to be explored in melee. Shield drops, subtle and stronger utilization and understanding of sdi, pivots, rebound/clank, etc"
SSBM,3dxp8h,victra,13,Mon Jul 20 15:08:15 2015 UTC,Can you give an example of how rebound/clank is used at high level in either 64 or melee?
SSBM,3dxp8h,wafflepouch,26,Mon Jul 20 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"The way rebound/clank works is the weaker of the two moves comes out of rebound stun faster. One common example in 64 is Falcon can dash attack kirby's utilt and come out of rebound early enough to get a grab.  In melee it hasnt been explored too much. Ive noticed Axe had been clanking marth attacks like fsmash with pika dtilt, and then using that to reposition himself."
SSBM,3dxp8h,victra,10,Mon Jul 20 18:17:29 2015 UTC,that is so cool
SSBM,3dxp8h,THEadversaire,5,Mon Jul 20 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"It's pretty interesting, you just need to read what move they'll do so you can hit with something sufficiently strong to clank. Also, melee is much more focused on aerial attacks which are almost always transcendent so they can't clank. I don't see clanking happening in many matchups other than sheik marth since falco, fox, peach, and falcon all approach with aerials."
SSBM,3dxp8h,ContemplativeOctopus,0,Mon Jul 20 22:11:07 2015 UTC,it also doesnt help that fox and falco fsmashs are one of the few moves that dont clank haha
SSBM,3dxp8h,victra,4,Tue Jul 21 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"They clank, they're just strong so they're hard to clank with."
SSBM,3dxp8h,ContemplativeOctopus,3,Tue Jul 21 02:41:38 2015 UTC,? Falco's at least clanks all the time.

SSBM,3dxp8h,ReinDance,5,Tue Jul 21 05:49:41 2015 UTC,I could see this.  Melee is essentially 64 with more control/mechanics.  As time goes on I can see the game becoming alot more like 64's meta but faster is all.

SSBM,3dxp8h,Heemoglobin,9,Mon Jul 20 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"From a totally ""not biased towards Marth slash have a huge mancrush on Marth"" perspective:    Utilizing more dash pivot fsmashes against other floaties/in the ditto around the mid-high percents off of forward throw. Most Marth players will instead WD fsmash or WD aerial, but the dash pivot is far less frame-committal with a higher reward a lot of the time. Not sure about how guaranteed this is though or the percent range for each character, but I'd imagine having it as a reaction-based punish or even a 50/50 would help quite a bit.  Consistently pivot dtilting, which would add another option out of dash dance that they can do without committing to a run.

Too many Marths just use dash dance JC grab/pivot grab as their main approach in neutral with occasional dtilt pokes (myself included) as a result of M2K's dominance, but they don't actually utilize it well and get punished for being predictable.   I think Marths need to start doing most of the stuff I'm working on above, along with basic fundamental stuff (chain grabbing spacies, tech chasing fast fallers, etc). We need to look back at old-school Marths (Cort, Zoso, JesiahTEG, etc) and retain their unpredictability and amazing zoning strategies, while applying the technology and option coverage shown from above and other Marths (Arc, The Moon, and I guess PewPewU).   The perfect Marth would be probably something that looks like Taj movement, M2K punishment, PP speed/neutral choices and Arc's pivoting mastery. Honestly, watching Mango/Leffen and even DruggedFox's Marth gives me ideas on how to improve my play and character."
SSBM,3dxp8h,EdwinDexter,4,Mon Jul 20 22:18:03 2015 UTC,Honestly empty pivot into dtilt out of DD is super hard to do as empty pivot dtilt by itself can be hard to do quickly to the point of being better than wd dtilt
SSBM,3dxp8h,vexoskeleton,3,Mon Jul 20 17:54:00 2015 UTC,I really agree with this. I'm always tempted to switch to Marth just because I see a lot of untapped potential.

Pivot fsmash is rarely required for the follow up when wavedash wouldn't cut it, mostly only at relatively low percent when you should be trying to start an aerial combo instead anyway. You don't start a combo on marth/peach/sheik at 20% with an fsmash. The wavedash is much easier to pull off and offers the same reward most of the time.   Consistently pivot dtilting, which would add another option out of dash dance that they can do without committing to a run.

Wavedash back does this fine, the only time pivot dtilt is necessary is when wavedash is too slow on reaction, but no one has reaction time that fast anyway so it doesn't help. Anytime you would react to an approach with a dash back pivot dtilt, you would have had to react earlier anyway when wavedash is fast already fast enough.

Bthrow to techchase Dolphin Slash against fast-fallers (Fox/Falco/Falcon)   A much riskier tech chase option with no gain in reward? If you can hit with a reverse up B you could have just tipper fsmashed them instead. Also, the extra distance you have to run to get in range for the up B usually means you're too slow for the tech chase when fsmash would have reached. If you read them hard enough to execute this you should have just fsmashed instead because It has less end lag which means you can still follow up afterward. If you reverse up B someone there's no chance for you to get the edge guard before they come back.   Utilizing platforms to our advantage (Dark Sonic and PewPewU are the only guys that do this pretty frequently in neutral off the top of my head to deal with Falco lasers and mixup their movement)   Platforms are amazing for marth, I think the mindset that FD is good for marth remains just because of M2K, no other marth is as good on FD, they all do better on platform stages.   Honestly, as a whole Marth technology is really underdeveloped and the people with the technology don't know how to smartly utilize it. Too many Marths just use dash dance JC grab/pivot grab as their main approach in neutral with occasional dtilt pokes (myself included) as a result of M2K's dominance, but they don't actually utilize it well and get punished for being predictable.   I really think the neutral against spacies is where most marth's suffer. Well timed aerials and well spaced dtilts should keep everyone out of your space unless you make a mistake. I see way too many marths just fishing for grabs all the time in neutral and they just get fucked for it. You always need a setup into grab, this whole 'raw grab in neutral' thing needs to end, everyone does it just because a top player was able to pull off for so long against spacies of yesterday."
SSBM,3dxp8h,ContemplativeOctopus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:58 2015 UTC,"Did you (or anyone else) notice PP using shield stops a little bit in neutral WF? They weren't often and I found them really interesting. Usually they're used in conjunction with something like an AC nair or fadeaway fair, but he would use them to just stop, and then continue dash dancing (if I remember correctly). I didn't notice him shield stopping at all at APEX - I wonder if that's something he's been developing in the lab."
SSBM,3dxp8h,The_Popes_Hat,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"Pivot dtilt is extremely overrated. For its level of difficulty its reward is too low. It also only covers one option, an opposing dash toward for an option out of run or a grab. Pivot jab is much better. It's easier and also works as an anti air. Pivot fair is also good for the same reasons. In fact, grounded pivot attacks in general are over shadowed by the very easy to use and only marginally less effective turnaround side B out of a dash. Pivot dtilt is only kind of useful at dealing with Falcon's ground speed as a fox trot is usually enough to space around Fox's run. Stages aren't long enough for pivot dtilt to be an effective defense option against fox."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Matthias35,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:59 2015 UTC,Ever since Apex 2015 PPU has been missing like half his pivots in tournament sets (ok at least WTFox and EVO and a random norcal tourney i watched a while ago).  People underestimate how hard it is to be frame perfect for pivots consistently in high pressure environments but last few times this was discussed on /r/ssbm apparently it's ez /s
SSBM,3dxp8h,Hariooo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"It's all about what method you use. If you're trying to do raw pivots it's hard to be 100%, but if you're doing empty pivots it's definitely possible to be 100% or close to it. I can pivot f smash 10 times in a row and I'm sure others can too and assuming you're using the c stick it works exactly as good as doing it the harder way."
SSBM,3dxp8h,cherubthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:55 2015 UTC,I mean I'm sure PPU can string together 10 pivot fsmashes in a row too but he's been failing a few in tourney sets recently. I think people vastly underestimate the difficulty of doing these things in a competitive environment is all I'm saying. I'm sure invincible ledge wavelands are done close to 100% in practice by Hax/Leffen/random Fox player #1324 but we see what happens on stage.
SSBM,3dxp8h,Hariooo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:45 2015 UTC,I've watched ppu stream. He can't do 10 at home either playing against the cpu. It's a mechanics thing not a pressure thing. Arc gets them pretty much 100% in tournament. I think it's just that not everybody has the empty pivot mechanic down.
SSBM,3dxp8h,cherubthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:09:02 2015 UTC,just to clarify empty pivot being the flick reset stick back to neutral technique right?
SSBM,3dxp8h,Hariooo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. There's more than one way to do it though. There's the flick which is more or less what i do. I dash then flick the stick back to neutral without ever going the other direction, I'm not sure if this is how other people do the flick method. I'm not even sure why it works tbh.   There's also the gravy quarter circle pivot where you go one way, then the other, then go to diagonal down in the same direction within one frame.  And I just tried it after warming up and was able to get eight in a row so not 10 but close. :P"
SSBM,3dxp8h,cherubthrowaway,14,Tue Jul 21 21:16:36 2015 UTC,"Picking your character based on your opponent. We're starting to see this become more and more relevant with Armada switching between Peach and Fox depending on the matchup (especially against Mango).  The most apparent instance this EVO was Plup choosing to use Samus against Leffen. Lately, Plup has been playing spectacularly with Sheik. But Leffen is notoriously terrible at the Samus matchup, losing sets to Plup at Paragon and HugS at Press Start earlier this year. As long as Leffen refuses to learn the matchup, Plup will continue to pick Samus against him. I think we're going to start seeing more top level players expanding their character pools and switching mid set in order to counter their opponent's playstyle."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Boneface,28,Tue Jul 21 22:19:24 2015 UTC,"Plup hates playing Samus and will almost certainly go Sheik against Leffen in the future.

It also is much less useful to bair an IC's on a platform than one underneath.  My next step in the matchup is to incorporate more nair in addition to fair, I think - I am not sure whether super-delayed nair is safe on the front of IC's shield, but it probably is and if it is that's very useful and should prevent most wobbles.    I'm also never leaving the top platform again for any reason."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Laudandus,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"that super delayed nair thing isnt always safe, but i might not have the timing completely down. If you can force ICs to get in the air, bair becomes a pretty good tool."
SSBM,3dxp8h,thefifth5,2,Mon Jul 20 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"He went sheik vs. ppmd to test the new controller, didn't work, tweeted ""I'll probably go samus since I'll lose anyways"", goes samus vs. leffen and wins, then he knows he'll never beat hbox with samus no matter what, so he tries sheik and fails."
SSBM,3dxp8h,Chrozon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"He's beaten Hbox with Sheik a few times, actually. I thought he would again."

I've never talked to him about it in person, but I would be very surprised if he uses Samus against Leffen in the future when he has a good controller again.   I don't think Plup said ""hate"".  Seems like he just thinks that if Fox knows the MU than they have the advantage."

SSBM,3dyz8s,Twin__A,5,Mon Jul 20 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"Camping may have been the inappropriate term, but it was more of a style which tries to slow down the game taking advantage of her superior hitboxes, which usually does well against Yoshi.

Don't be afraid to use tech skill you aren't that practiced with in friendlies, that's how you improve it for tourney matches and stuff.  Work on mind games too, although depending on your character that's not as big a deal.  The biggest thing I can suggest you work on is spacing.  It's a really easy thing to work on even against computers but it's so important.  Most stuff that defines ""good players"" can't really be taught, though, and comes with practice, so just practice as much as you can (with people if possible) and you should see improvement"

Literally every time it with someone around my skill level (there are three that I routinely play with) I end up salty whether I won or lost. I play to win so I don't care about doing the coolest combo. I will tech chase another Falcon to death if it nets me the victory. But I cannot for the life of me figure out why I hate it so much.  It seems like, at our level anyway, it's both Falcons dash-dancing on opposite sides of the stage and seeing whose aerial wins/trading 3 nairs in a row. It's just annoying in every way and I can't pinpoint areas I can improve on.  I don't even need advice on winning, I just want someone to change my perspective so I'm not salty when I lose.

SSBM,3dx4qr,Reesch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:49:34 2015 UTC,"Lol, that's the thing. We both want space to come in and start a combo, but Falcon out-spaces himself really well because of his crazy dash-dance. And even at my level one grab can lead into a good amount of damage.  It's safer on the other end ;-;  And running over to the other Falcon is a retarded idea because they can easily extend the dash away, turn around, and get the aerial we were both vying for for 10 seconds. Coming in with an aerial is significantly safer, but when both people want to and have literally the same tools we end up in a lot of stalemates lol.  Dash-dancing against Falcon isn't that easy."
SSBM,3dx4qr,GeZ_,3,Tue Jul 21 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"It's not easy, but what you're talking about isn't purposeful dash dancing.   Straight up, example from being taught street fighter by a top 30 Marvel vs Capcom 3 player: He was trying to teach me whiff punishing in relation to footsies, which is sort of similar to punishing moves that you baited out with dash dance. I wouldn't have as many opportunities to whiff punish his moves because I was afraid to try to play footsies against him because he's better at it, so he would straight up throw out whatever he wanted and have as much space as he needed because I was scared of his options.  When trying to teach me, he would literally space a move right outside my range, and use it over and over again, while saying ""What are you doing? Why are you even trying to play footsies if you won't punish my misspacing or bad options?"".  He actually did that to a friend of mine in Melee. He was playing Marth and my buddy was playing Fox, and they were dash dancing and stuff, until he noticed my friend wasn't dash dancing based on spacing, he was just kind of robotically doing it. The dude stopped DD'ing or anything and just started doing random tilts and smash attacks. Says something to a similar effect to my friend. ""What's the point of dash dancing if you're not going to punish my moves? What you're doing is pointless if I can whiff an Fsmash and not get hit for it."" My friend got pretty mad about it, but it's a good method for teaching.  I know this turned out lengthy, but the point is, you have to play like you want your tools to be optimal. If you don't you'll miss out on opportunities, and have stunted player growth."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Reesch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"I've thought about just standing still and reacting because I know the DDing we're doing is stupid, but Falcon's moves take so long to come out.  I might do it anyway and just shieldgrab half the time. Or WD back.  I think I'll do what your buddy does, then. I know running back and forth like I do is meaningless but I couldn't think through my other options. Thanks for the replies because this is what I needed."

SSBM,3dx4qr,Reesch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:16 2015 UTC,"I basically just try to make them whiff and start a tech chase, but the amount of knees and overshot nairs I eat are so bad lol.

SSBM,3dx4qr,Skytch,4,Tue Jul 21 04:50:15 2015 UTC,"I would suggest thinking about what decisions the other Falcon is making and think to yourself ""I know what beats that decision"" and try to bait out him doing something so that you can punish it.   It seems to me you might have some inner pride that you're not really consciously aware of, but I get the same feeling whenever I used to play Ganon dittos and lost to someone who was around my skill. Though recently when I play Falcon dittos, I focus more on the neutral and what decisions will throw off my opponent or what will just straight up beat his dumb nair approach. For example, you could prepare yourself for that nair approach and CC grab him when you see him jump, as most Falcon will be trying to nair you.  I've tried numerous times to just run out of the way of the other Falcon's nair but sometimes not even that works out, and you get hit anyway. You can turn around in shield and make him space it badly and get a shield grab, etc. etc.   Again, there might be some sort of pride that you feel like you must accomplish when you play another Falcon, like you really want to outplay them, and if you don't, you'll be salty. Neutral is super important in the matchup so if you become much more aware of what you are doing as well as your opponent, then I'm sure you'll be more focused on winning those neutral situations instead of getting salty. I know I still get salty over little things in Melee that just seem like they have a 1% chance of happening. It's okay to get a bit salty but you do not want to let it consume you."

I find it somewhat easy to figure out what I messed up on, but not against Falcon. I don't mind losing enough to always get salty, but when I can't figure out why it puts me over the edge.  I would say maybe I hate getting punished so hard, but I can get pillared for a whole stock and not be irritated. Maybe it's because I'm not doing the same right back.  I really couldn't tell you exactly why lol."
SSBM,3dx4qr,-oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo-,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"Try ""watching yourself"" as in be more aware of your thoughts and feelings.  The same triggers will usually cause the same feelings. Recognize when you're brain is feeling these negative emotions brought on by the things that annoy you in the match up, and once you've recognize that feeling, try to shake it off.  I usually take a deep breath. Try your best to not   You're using braincells that should be going to pinpointing what you are doing wrong for thoughts that shouldn't be there.  I've spent a lot of time in my own head, so maybe it's easier than I think."

I wasn't really rooting for anyone after that, but after seeing Armada win and pop off like that, it showed me how much this game meant to him and how much he wanted the win. I know melee means everything to the rest of them, but Armada deserved this, at the award ceremony at Evo 2014 Armada looked awful, but at this Ceremony he looked the happiest he has ever been in his life. I'm glad Mang0 and Leffen were good sports in the end. Everyone seemed happy for Armada and that overall makes me happy. Evo was great for me."

Been thinking about starting to play melee, finally snapped and made the decision after watching Evo.  Two gamecube controllers on the way, picking up a CRT tonight and gonna mod an old Wii my sister had laying around her place.  My question is, how the hell do I even get started?  I live in Provo, UT and know literally nobody that plays smash at all, much less melee.  My GF is semi-interested in learning how to play but I doubt she'll dive into it with the devotion that I generally do with new games.  I know I'm going to be absolute shit, since I've only played a few hours of melee my entire life (loved every minute) and I'm mainly a PC guy who has never owned a console in his life.  I don't really want to burden somebody who I don't know and who actually knows what they are doing with teaching me how to play/giving me practice, but I also know that 20XX/bots probably will only go so far and will get boring to a new player pretty quick.

People are actually super willing to give help to new players. Don't be afraid to ask the most ridiculous questions. We want you to ask. They may get frustrated if you ask questions that are easily searchable. But screw those guys and what they think of you.   There's a link in the side-bar wiki about facebook groups. Those are the best way to find people around you to play.
SSBM,3dx4qr,Crazycupofjoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"Ok so playing bots is not bad at first especially if you are just learning the game and need to unlock characters and stages. After that hopefully you have found a character you would like to main and take to a higher level. Because the timing for almost everything is different per character is it important to pick one and stick to it once you find one you like.   From there I would learn how to wavedash, L cancel, and SHFFL in that order. You will start to be able to move faster and hopefully will se combos starting and how to follow up. If you would like to learn more about advanced tech and character specific tech, I would suggest visiting smashboards.com and navigate to the character of your choice.  In order To find people to play with, I would find your local scene through the Facebook groups in the sidebar/top bar of the subreddit. You can also look on smashboards.com to see upcoming tournaments. Also if your computer is good enough (mainly processor power) you can download Dolphin emulator and get a Melee rom that will allow you to play on your computer assuming you have an adapter which you can buy on Amazon. When using dolphin, most people use the website anthers ladder ( I think it's anthersladder.org but I'm not sure) as a matchmaker, it has chat rooms and a ranking system but still lets you play friendlies."

He plays Marth against spacies on FD because he like platforms with Sheik and ""that matchup is SOOO easy with Marth on that stage."" He also has pretty good Falco that I'd say is just a little worse than his Sheik. He picks either Falcon or Peach against ICs cuz those matchups are so much easier than with Sheik. He beat S0ft with Falcon at a GA local recently too.   tl;dr He plays everyone but is a Sheik main."

SSBM,3dx4qr,CriticalRibbon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"If melee was all about interactions like that, no one would like it or play it once the slight amount of novelty it provides wore off. The main reason so many people play melee in fact is because of the high pace, high interaction mindgames that it not only allows but (usually) rewards at the top level. Constricting the neutral game so thoroughly that it becomes a game of rock paper scissors (or ledge grab, laser, downtilt if you prefer) is not only ""anti-hype"", it's trading in yomi and a fair amount of skill just for the W. It's knowing you'll lose at chess so you force your opponent to play checkers instead. If you're willing to make that trade then sure, go for it. It's not worth it in my opinion though, and you can't expect the people who came expecting a chess match to enjoy it either.   There seems to be differing opinions on who exactly is funneling the neutral game. Maybe they both are. I personally think there is a tremendous difference between ledge stalling and laser camping however and I would fully support a ledge regrab limit if any forward thinking TOs were to implement it. It's the difference between interaction and non-interaction. Fighting and not fighting (and this is a fighting game we are talking about here). The footsies when someone ledge stalls are just too limited, and somewhere before ""lasering -> invincible 8 minute firefox stall"" there is undeniably a line that we have to draw. Maybe most of you don't think that line came close to being crossed, but some of us do and that's worth considering."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Dublshine,4,Tue Jul 21 04:40:33 2015 UTC,This is more so my opinion on ledge camping vs laser camping but I guess I'll put it here anyway. Laser camping is more exciting for two reasons:   Laser camping is actually doing damage and hitting your opponent while ledge camping is just stalling for time.  You can run straight at someone who is laser camping and put them on the defensive while you have to wait for an opportunity to maybe get a poke on someone who's ledge camping.    I don't have anything against hbox but he shouldn't expect people to like his ledge camping or dislike armada's laser camping.
SSBM,3dx4qr,SubjectiveF,3,Mon Jul 20 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with it but frankly there's not a lot of depth to those interactions. It's a flaw within melee itself, though, hbox isn't to blame."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Pareto_effecient,8,Mon Jul 20 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"Theres nothing wrong with camping or timing someone out in game, people are allowed to play to win. None of that means I have to enjoy watching Puff ledge camp. Everyone likes to say it was intense and there was these great neutral exchanges and it was and there were, but none of those neutral exchanges(or very very few) took place once Puff grabbed the ledge and all the intensity melted away for 30 seconds. Youre welcome to play to win, and I wouldnt mind playing a match like that, but I dont care to watch it. Thats not to say every match needs to be some wild over in a minute and a half game, I enjoy watching floaties play too and I enjoy watching people camp to an extent."

SSBM,3dx4qr,Crazycupofjoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:53 2015 UTC,Not a gameplay question. Where can I find my placing? I went to Evo and outside of top 32 idk how to find how I did. I went 2-2 In pools but I'm not sure what placing I got.
SSBM,3dx4qr,Rmbuckley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:58 2015 UTC,"You might be able to do some math and figure it out if you find out how many overall spots (with players and without) there were at evo in the first round. Sounds like you went two rounds so you would have to take the total number of spots and cut it in half I think? My math might not be sound here, but I think I have the right idea."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Crazycupofjoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:57 2015 UTC,"From just thinking over what I think happens, I think that no one is knocked out first round. And a quarter of the players are knocked out second round (half of the players in losers bracket). Then each round, another quarter of the remaining players are knocked out. So if Melee had 1800, r1 has 1800 then r2 still has 1800, and then 450 would be knocked out. Down to 1350. Then a quarter of 1350 are knocked out leaving close to 1000. Then people that lost in r4 would be somewhere around tied for 750 I think. Idk if any of this makes sense to anyone else. Just kind of putting my thoughts into words."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Rmbuckley,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:52 2015 UTC,Nope that's the correct way to do it. Yeah my math was wrong. You subtract a fourth from the number of spots and then another fourth from the number you have and that's your placement.
SSBM,3dx4qr,nikovan_smash,7,Mon Jul 20 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"The more I watch Melee, the less I want to play PM. I don't know if it is the constant updates or the lack of clarity with the PMDT explaining balance choices, but I feel that I want to play a game with a developed meta and no chance of random changes. Sad, because I feel Melee is ridiculously stiff coming from PM. Everything feels off. I have to sit down and not succumb to the temptation of booting PM again."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Reesch,12,Mon Jul 20 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"Melee is more precise. The input timings are all more strict than PM, so it probably feels terrible right now.

SSBM,3dx4qr,Dublshine,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:21 2015 UTC,Melee feels stiff because inputs are slightly harder but you'll adjust to it.
SSBM,3dx4qr,advancedpongtech,3,Mon Jul 20 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"During the salty suite, Wobbles said something about dashing in the direction your character isn't facing being oddly difficult. Are there any differences between dashing forwards and dashing backwards?"
SSBM,3dx4qr,chunkaroonied,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you look at Armada's controller tweets, he was looking for one that could dash backwards easily. If you don't get the the 'smash turn' then there's a delay when dashing backwards. This is something that not many people talk about but is essential if you want to play fluidly."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Reesch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:32 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it takes a few more frames for the animation to start. I personally don't know why.
SSBM,3dx4qr,Buttkream911,5,Mon Jul 20 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"Assuming you begin dashing from standing and talking about dash dancing, you have to move your control stick very fast to get a 1 frame turnaround animation. If you move it too slowly, you end up getting a normal turning animation, and so you have to wait through that. For characters with short DDs or players used to using ahort DDs, you might end up doing pirouettes if you go through this longer turnaround animation.  This is information I gathered from an older daily discussion. Hopefully someone more mechanically familiar with Melee can verify or something."
SSBM,3dx4qr,PM_ME_UR_UR,4,Mon Jul 20 19:09:55 2015 UTC,"With such a short dash distance, I find it very hard to utilize Falco's DD like most of the other top tier characters do. The only situation I find it great is during an edgegaurd; it confuses opponents for my edgegaurd strategy. Most of Falco's neutral relies on Wavedashing and Lasers. How can I better work his DD into my neutral? Should I work it into my laser game?"
SSBM,3dx4qr,CanItWait,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"Just practice more with it. Falco's dash dance is all about microspacing. It's smaller than a lot of the top tier, so you really can't use it in the same way. Try to be unpredictable, dd > fadeback laser. Also incorporate dash >wavedash into your arsenal. It is falco's fastest way to move on the ground."
SSBM,3dx4qr,RathKeno,8,Mon Jul 20 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"Watch some PP videos, he's crazy good at dashdancing."
SSBM,3dx4qr,garrettxvx,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"When I think about zoning with Falco, specifically maintaining space with both lasers and threatening with DD's, the optimum space to maintain is like 1-2 dash-worths of space. This video has a good visual representation of that space. If you laser from anything further away, you're basically just laser harassing or interrupting your opponent because you can't expect to get in quick enough for a follow up after the laser. Doing an approaching laser from closer in than that distance leaves you vulnerable to a defensive option. Dash dancing when you are around that 1-2-dash distance allows you to keep your opponent guessing on your laser mixups. Because the DD allows you to quickly change directions your laser mixups at that distance then become:   when dashing in (facing your opponent) - WD -> f-tilt, WD -> d-tilt, approaching nair, dair, laser  when dashing out (back to your opponent) - WD -> u-tilt, retreating bair, retreating turn around laser.  DDing in Falco's optimum zone allows you to most effectively maintain space and threaten with the most amount of mixups."
SSBM,3dx4qr,YoungLorax,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, quick question about CRTs. I recently just got a Sony Trinitron, and what I noticed when playing smash on it was that everything felt really ""stiff"". Like, if I wanted to dash dance, unless I slammed the joystick, my character would just pivot from side to side. Short hopping is a lot more difficult because it feels like the buttons on my controller aren't as sensitive as they are when using other CRTs. I have to hit the buttons way harder to do anything advanced, like wave dashing, tech rolling, l canceling, etc.  I think I can rule out a controller issue, because I was at my friend's house a couple days ago using the same controller, and everything was crispy as hell on his CRT.  Do I just have a bad CRT? Is this normal? Any help would be appreciated!  Pics of the CRT"
SSBM,3dx4qr,KoopaPoopaScoopa,2,Mon Jul 20 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"About the dash dancing, you actually do have to slam the stick if you start your dash dance backwards, otherwise you will enter the turn around animation which takes some time. Then, once you've finished turning around you'll be trying to ""dash back"" again and repeat the process which results in the pivoting you're talking about. I'm on mobile but I'll link a control stick map when i can.  You probably just had a bad tech day when something like the above happened and ended up focusing solely on your inputs."
SSBM,3dx4qr,YoungLorax,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong; I'm not great at melee.  But I literally tried dash dancing on my CRT set up, had trouble, switched to dolphin and everything was fine, and then went to my buddy's place like 10 minutes later and had none of the issues.  Like, my tech skill is far from being great, but all I know is that everything feels completely different on my CRT set up.  Is it possible there may just be a few frames of lagg on this TV?  I've never had any issue like this with the whole button inputs feeling stiff feeling until today, and I've been casually playing Melee for about 2 years now, and am just starting to get into playing on CRTs"
SSBM,3dx4qr,the_noodle,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"Dolphin fucked up your tech skill mate, happens to everyone who plays on an emulator.  The closest you can get is if you use the official Wii U adapter or at least a compatible knockoff with a Wii U mode, running the latest version of dolphin, using native input. If you don't do all of those steps perfectly though, you're going to have a bad time switching to the real deal.  The most likely reason Dolphin is easier is that you've set it up to max out inputs before reaching the edge of the stick. You're used to moving the stick slowly to dash backwards, you need to move it faster, basically you have to reach the edge within one frame to get a back dash instead of a turn."
SSBM,3dx4qr,YoungLorax,2,Mon Jul 20 20:19:05 2015 UTC,That's kind of what I was afraid of. Cheers mate!
SSBM,3dx4qr,Jay__Money,7,Mon Jul 20 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"The TV you're using has no effect on the inputs you put into your controller; Your controller puts the inputs straight into the game, it doesn't pass through the TV. Your TV most likely has a frame or two of lag, which is affecting your timing."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Yrale,3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:00 2015 UTC,"TV looks fine, but either way a TV wouldn't affect the issues you'e describing. Might've just been having a bad tech day?"

SSBM,3dx4qr,Yrale,4,Mon Jul 20 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"Is it possible my gamecube is messed up?   Unlikely, but possible.  Could be you're used to a non-native Dolphin controller configuration?"
SSBM,3dx4qr,YoungLorax,2,Mon Jul 20 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"It's possible.  I just messed with the settings until I was happy with them.  I'm just confused because when I was at my friends' place a couple days ago, everything was perfect on his CRT.  The game would react to every little move I did on my controller, the same one I'm using on my set up right now."
SSBM,3dx4qr,_Panda,5,Mon Jul 20 18:08:53 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely no way that the CRT is affecting your actual inputs. All it does is display what the gamecube tells it to display. It is possible that the TV has lag, but that really shouldn't be affecting stuff that doesn't depend on visual cues like short-hops and wavedashes (though it could be a mental thing)."

SSBM,3dx4qr,Ivacaftor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"Something that I find helps is by pausing the game and thinking about my options. If you play on dolphin saving and loading states is very useful for this (20xx has this too but I never use it). What options do you have? What do you need to do to approach your opponent. Once you do this often enough, you will start to dissect your own gameplay more.  As for slowing it down that only came to me once I was so used to all my movement options. The moment you don't have to think about certain inputs is the moment you can focus on slowing the game down"

I don't really play SF at all but like lots of people I'm familiar with it from seeing it in arcades and stuff. The commentators also did a fantastic job pointing out how the strategies the players were using fit into the meta, pointing out when someone was getting away with something they shouldn't, explaining how Chun-Li is supposed to counter Elena(?) but how the E. player was using a new strategy to reverse that advantage, etc.  At the end of the day, it's a good game, the players are skilled, the meta is interesting, the combat has a nice ebb and flow between tense neutral and explosive punishes. You don't need to circlejerk on the internet about what the pro players are tweeting to enjoy watching a game; people just see it climbing the twitch rankings, tune in to check it out, and stick around because it's hype."

SSBM,3dx4qr,Skytch,5,Mon Jul 20 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"There was an Evo viewing party at my college yesterday with there being a tournament that I wanted to enter before Melee started.   I got there a bit late because I forgot that it started at noon and had no time to warm-up (I didn't want to do it on purpose this time). I was kind of disappointed that I wasn't even remotely seeded correctly, but there was noway of me knowing that the seeding would be messed up until after the tournament started.   Either way, I ended up going out 0-2. Both sets went down to last stock and I didn't play terribly, but it still wasn't enough. At least this time round I didn't feel like I played badly, I honestly just didn't capitalize enough on my opportunities and got outplayed half of the time. My mentality right off the bat was definitely better, but I also still got nervous and flubbed a lot of tech in my first set.   I played a bunch more friendlies with some spacie friends, as well as a few Marths. Against most of the spacies that I played, almost all of them, if not all, had the habit of spot-dodging right after teching away or behind. I swear I had the read multiple times on them doing the spot-dodge and so many times I went for the grab anyway to just get spot-dodged. It's like I'm just barely too slow on the regrab and it frustrates me a bit. But instead of getting frustrated greatly, I focused on how I can punish the spot-dodge habit that these space animal friends of mine kept doing, and I eventually was able to punished the spot-dodges with like dsmash, late grab, and stomp. I didn't get super consistent with it, but I was definitely expected for them to spot-dodge a lot and very few people actually changed their habits, the only way they changed it however was they would just straight shine out of a tech roll or getup instead of spot-dodge and then shine.   I can see the improvement with Falcon though, so I'm going to keep playing as him."

SSBM,3dx4qr,ender1944,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:37:34 2015 UTC,How does one analyze anything ? It's the same way.
SSBM,3dx4qr,OriginalKarma,4,Mon Jul 20 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this, analyzing a Smash match may have similar aspects to analyzing something like a basketball game, but it's by no means the same. Giving a full answer to someone who is asking is legitimate question a lot more beneficial to the discussion than giving an empty answer.  What I mean is that in Smash, you analyze by following things like tech patterns, what moves a player is using to take away options, how a player traps an opponent on a platform during a tech-chase, etc.  In my opinion, when practicing, you want to focus on improving individual aspects of your game (tech-chasing, edgeguarding, spacing, etc.), and then incorporate them into your play.  As a Marth main, I watch a lot of different players and try to emulate how they play, for example watching Mew2King edgeguard various characters for an hour seriously helped me with my edgeguard game, and allowed me to realize how many options Marth had to keep other characters from getting back to the stage. Ledgedrop bair or counter against firefox, jab against phantasm, runoff dair (for style), are all moves I never considered as being viable, but turned out to be incredibly useful, and are now staples of my edgeguard game.  Watching what PewPewU gets off of one grab, what percents he does certain moves on certain characters to keep his combos going, how he uses his dash dance to keep characters in the corner while pressuring them with shieldstop aerials and d-tilt, also teaches you a lot about the limits of a character. Punish game is something vital to succeeding with Marth, and players like M2K, PPMD, and PPU have juggling down to a science. Watching them utilize each of their moves with purpose and deliberation taught me how to get the most out of a single grab, and seriously bolstered my punish game by providing me with new ideas on how to capitalize on every opportunity.  As a final example, Marth's movement is one of his strongest tools, and in my mind I needed to improve my movement as much as I could if I wanted to get the most out of my character. I often watch PPMD matches and focus solely on his dash dance. PPMD uses every movement tool that Marth has with unparalleled fluidity and effectiveness, cactus dashing to fake out his opponent, wavedashing constantly, and being extremely fast while maintaining spacing which threatens his opponent into reacting and staying at a safe distance most of the time. Seeing how PPMD moves and threatens his opponent, often times without even throwing out a move, opened my eyes to just how effective movement can be at baiting out opponents, and bolstered my neutral game heavily.  This is just my mentality when analyzing matches, I hope this helps you /u/idklikeseriouslyidk, watch some 20GX, watch some S2J, watch some Darkrain, and try and find the aspects of their game that appeal to you, that are optimal, and that are, of course, extremely stylish."

SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,7,Mon Jul 20 08:31:25 2015 UTC,"I really, REALLY wanted to see a better game 3.  Mango's disappointed face just killed me :("
SSBM,3dx4qr,neros_neurosis,-6,Mon Jul 20 08:33:57 2015 UTC,Same. The 3VO is dead and I'm so glad it was Hbox that killed it
SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,3,Mon Jul 20 08:28:23 2015 UTC,"People like to use the Internet for bashing people because of the anonymity, but it's still sad to see it every time.  Hbox played out of his mind at EVO, I think we should all expect it from him at this point.  I'm really excited to see how he'll do when Smash isn't his focus."
SSBM,3dx4qr,SnackalackaSmash,5,Mon Jul 20 08:27:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the sad fact. Happy people dont usually comment, its not worth it - its the people with a problem you hear the most."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Gatoraay,12,Mon Jul 20 08:32:13 2015 UTC,It's a good day to be an Armada fan!  ...  But I'm still lamenting the fall of his Peach.
SSBM,3dx4qr,Kevinar,3,Mon Jul 20 08:07:42 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he only used fox in top 8, almost everything else was peach"
SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,6,Mon Jul 20 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"I dunno, he still pulls out the peach for certain matchups.  If I could choose to play peach v. puff or fox v. puff I think the choice would be clear."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Gatoraay,-3,Mon Jul 20 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"But you know he had to work so much harder with Peach to get the wins. And aside from certain sets vs Mango, his switch to Fox was due to a clear goal and that was to simply win big tournaments.  Peach has pretty much become a gimmick at this point, a counterpick that no one is really scared of anymore. Armada was artificially inflating the viability of Peach due to raw skill. Now with Fox, he can get wins easier and doesn't have to worry about counterpicking wars."
SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,3,Mon Jul 20 08:41:56 2015 UTC,I won't argue that. All I'm saying is that he still plays it sometimes against other matchups.  I do think it's a little harsh to say peach is just a counter pick at this stage of the game. She has way too many tools to be just that.
SSBM,3dx4qr,Gatoraay,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I overreacted. She's not as viable as she used to be and she still loses to laser camping (which is now becoming a shameless top-level strategy) but her tools can still win games if used properly."
SSBM,3dx4qr,IEatBabies8,5,Mon Jul 20 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't exactly say that no one is really scared of it anymore or that is a gimmick OR a counterpick, he was using peach a lot through the tourney before top 8 and still could pull of crazy stuff. I would be very surprised if anyone outside of the top 6 and maybe plup beats his peach any time soon."
SSBM,3dx4qr,Gatoraay,3,Mon Jul 20 08:56:08 2015 UTC,I'd really like to pick his brain about Peach stuff and his general mindset regarding Peach. I wonder if Armada would ever do an /r/ssbm interview or AMA.
SSBM,3dx4qr,iRanch,4,Mon Jul 20 09:09:07 2015 UTC,"One thing I never see being discussed is approaching with roll.  With Ganondorf, I am able to get in on some characters like Falco at the startup of the jumpsquat + laser with my roll and it works pretty well as a mixup. I've also seen some foxes sometimes approach with roll -> shine. I heard with Kirby roll -> uptilt is a legitimate approach.   What do you guys think and what other characters + applications can you guys think of?"
SSBM,3dx4qr,krispness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:40:40 2015 UTC,For a short while I started doing roll through Marth fsmash into rest. If you just spam crouch cancel they'd think they're hot shit when they space for the smash but I'm really baiting that tipper fsmash. ...but then people caught on. Same thing with sheik since she'd try to grab but is be crouching already.
SSBM,3dx4qr,A_Waskawy_Wabit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:38 2015 UTC,Just curious do you know if you can rest me when you're crouching and I run up down smash you? I know it's unsafe on hit normally but if you're CCing there's a decent chance you'll get hit all 3 times
SSBM,3dx4qr,M_19_B,13,Mon Jul 20 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"I heard with Kirby roll -> uptilt is a legitimate approach.   This is jokingly called the ""invincible combat roll"". It's one of Kirby's best options in neutral. The keyword is ""best"" not ""good"" or ""legitimate"". It's Kirby's best option, but it's still a terrible option, lol.  Rolling is good elsewhere too. For ICs, Yoshi can fuck up nana with egg lay unless the ICs read it and roll behind him, and then they get a free wobble. I think what you're describing is only good for reading someone, though, there's often a better option. Ganon's roll is 31 frames and Falco's frame perfect SHL is 26 frames, so unless you read the laser, you're going to be at a 5 frame disadvantage which is plenty of time for Falco to fuck you up (and pretty reactable too)."
SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,3,Mon Jul 20 07:45:24 2015 UTC,"Kinda like how we affectionately refer to jumping from ledge as a ""tournament winner""?  That's kinda funny.  Man, if Kirby's best approach option is roll into uptilt, there really is no hope from him..."
SSBM,3dx4qr,RathKeno,3,Mon Jul 20 07:49:55 2015 UTC,"That's actually called that because it wins the tournament for the other person, lol."

SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is something I would use once, then it would work and I would use it way too much.  That's just me, but I guess from the standpoint of a mixup every once in a while it might work.  However, characters like Ganon might not be able to use it as effectively.  Slower guys like him might just get punished hard for doing things like approaching with a roll.  Falco/Fox can uptilt/shine/grab you pretty easily if they see it coming and start up a combo from there.   I've always thought of rolling as more of a defensive/reading type of option, but who knows! Experiment with it a bit more in friendlies, I'd love to hear how it goes!"
SSBM,3dx4qr,enemydrag,13,Mon Jul 20 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on the weekend in Smash:  Holy shit, 10/10 weekend.  What I saw of EVO (Pretty much everything besides Saturday) was top notch performances from everyone involved.    I guess if I had to name an exception to that rule, it'd be Leffen or Mango.  Of course, with all of the hype surrounding the two, it's hard to imagine either of them meeting expectations.  Game 3 of Mango/Hbox was just a heartbreaker,  I can't even imagine how bad Mango must feel.  As far as Leffen goes, I think he might've been able to win his set against Plup had it been a best of 5.    Up against Axe (Pika) and Plup, who decided to go Samus in what I thought was a friggin' brilliant move, was just a killer for Leffen.  Leffen's shown his ability to make it past early setbacks in quite a few situations. His INY set versus PPU shows what I'm talking about pretty well.  From what I saw, Leffen was making some great adjustments from game to game.  Maybe with a little more wiggle room, he could've clutched it out. I think he had the toughest possible bracket for a player like him.  I suppose that'd lead into EVO being bo3 until finals.  It's very different from other majors in that sense, but it creates a little more pressure on the players to be consistent, which I think is good.  And speaking of consistensy, holy shit Armada is good at Super Smash Bros. Melee.  I didn't expect a 3-0 against PPMD at all, but Armada played beautifully and took the tournament with relative ease.  Sweeden seems unbeatable right now.  Stateside I was definitely impressed with Hbox's last tourney as a full time smasher.  It seems like every time I think he's finally fading out into the distance, he comes back with a really consistent and dominating tournament.  It just goes to show you can never count one of the gods out.  Besides Hbox, a lot of other players from the US played extremely well too.  Who would've thought CHUDAT would make top 8 at a tournament like this?  Even better we got players like Ken, HugS, and DruggedFox playing like they should be playing.  Everyone's really hitting their stride for August, and I can't wait to see how the new few months unfold.  TL;DR HOLY SHIT WHAT A WEEKEND, EXCEPT FOR LEFFEN AND MANGO.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS."
SSBM,3dx4qr,A_Waskawy_Wabit,2,Mon Jul 20 07:36:12 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if Leffen would have won a bo5. Fox really has a ton of advantages of Samus in terms of maps but giving Plup FoD is pretty huge

I know the general consensus is that PP is better than Hbox. But PP seemed to struggle against a lot of people he arguably shouldn't have. And not to mention he didn't take a single game off a Armada or Hbox. He hasn't given a lot to work with. I can see him being above Hbox but not in the top 3 currently.
SSBM,3dvswv,DarkLava,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"PP seemed to struggle against a lot of people he arguably shouldn't have.   So did every single top player aside from HBox.  PP obliterated Plup, far more convincingly than HBox did. I have no idea how you can put Mang0 ahead of him."

SSBM,3dvswv,white015,3,Mon Jul 20 13:11:00 2015 UTC,"People are downvoting this, but this guy is right. The set would've been different, but I don't know if Plup would have won. If you look at the matches there were NOTICABLE flubs from Plup like forward smash on platforms instead of drop zone fair and getting stuck in his shield. That being said Hbox played really well, so I don't know if Plup would've beaten him."
SSBM,3dvswv,Rmbuckley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, I'm not saying plup would have won for sure or anything, I just think it would have been a lot closer than the set we got, which was a pretty easy 2-0 for hbox."

Dont get me wrong, kevin is one of my favorite players and he has the best non mango stream, but he has yet to prove himself in a top 8 national situation.  Edit: it's also kinda obvious mango, leffen, and hbox are a step ahead ppmd right now."
SSBM,3dvswv,Vacumpencil,19,Mon Jul 20 01:32:11 2015 UTC,well shroomed went out super early at evo but yeah i agree.  much better national performances

SSBM,3dvswv,Sheikwithnotag,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:10 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% but I feel that PPU has a better head to head record vs shroomed. Which is why he's usually placed above him
SSBM,3dvswv,crankthatjose,13,Mon Jul 20 03:28:11 2015 UTC,Head to head means almost nothing in this context...

SSBM,3dvswv,Vacumpencil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"shroomed currently has a pretty weak matchup vs spacies. until he learns to techchase like plup / druggedfox this will probably continue to be true. and since there are so many amazing spacies players, he's gonna have a bit of a hard time."

A few people are putting him above Leffen, which simply has no backing in fact on any kind of recent metric (tourney placement, head to head, etc.), but I'm also surprised that he's pretty universally considered above PPMD. Evo certainly wasn't his strongest tournament, but the same and more could be said for Mango.  I know we need more data on PP, but putting him below Mango seems incorrect to me, and I'm surprised that there doesn't even seem to be any debate here to put Mango above him."

One tourney, even evo, is not the be all, end all. I would even argue evo only means as much as other large tourneys because of the unusually deep Bo3s."
SSBM,3dvswv,just_dan,3,Mon Jul 20 18:56:17 2015 UTC,Completely agree with this. Nice way of putting it.
SSBM,3dvswv,Peanutz996,4,Mon Jul 20 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"I dont know if I would put leffen very far above mango ppmd and hbox, he still hasnt shown that he can really show up to lots of these major events like some of the others even though when the stakes are lower he seems to do amazing and he did do amazing at a big event like ceo recently so he should be somewhere up there."
SSBM,3dvswv,vexoskeleton,4,Mon Jul 20 10:48:06 2015 UTC,"Hbox has won exactly 1 stacked tournament in the last year and half, PP doesn't go to tournaments and had a somewhat deceptive 3rd at Evo, in that those who placed directly below him had arguably better tournaments, and I still think Armada is basically a wall for Mango until he proves otherwise. Leffen is the biggest threat to take a tournament out of those four imo, and that gives him the nod for me. He really only has 1 bad placing this year, and that was partially because he saw Mango really early in losers."

SSBM,3dvswv,iSwm42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:25 2015 UTC,I am aware. I think its an outlier until he proves otherwise. He basically needs to win game 1 and then also not lose on his counterpicks for him to get the W at this point. That is pretty rough and a serious uphill battle.

He's shown plenty of times that he can beat HBox in tourney lol. They've only played twice in the past year (Evo 14+15) and their Evo '14 set went to game 3 last stock, with PP almost 4 stocking hbox game 1. Their set right before that was a 6-1 beat down in favor of PP, so its not like HBox has an overwhelmingly positive record or anything."
SSBM,3dvswv,mylox,38,Sun Jul 19 23:51:33 2015 UTC,"He's gotten 1st and 3rd at the two biggest tournies this year. Mango has gotten 5th and 4th, and HBox got 5th and 2nd. He even has a better average than Leffen, who got 3rd and 5th.   Average placings at Apex/Evo  Armada- 1.5  PP- 2  HBox- 3.5  Leffen- 4  Mango- 4.5  Leffen is argued to be above PP because of his performances at tournaments outside of Apex/Evo, and his 1st place finishes at at CEO, FC, and WTFOX. Mango got 3rd at CEO, didn't attend FC, and got 2nd at WTFOX. HBox got 5th at CEO, 2nd at FC, and didn't attend WTFOX.   Leffen has played well enough in the other tournies outside of Apex/Evo to have a very strong argument for #2, maybe even #1. PP's 3rd place average at supermajors this year gives him a very strong argument for #2 and #3. Neither Mango nor HBox have performed as well as Armada, Leffen, or PP this year, going by tournament results alone."

SSBM,3dvswv,TrulyMaster,8,Mon Jul 20 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"You're looking at only 2 tournaments. Take into consideration that his bracket was really easy at EVO and at Apex he never played Mango or HBox. The sets he took from Leffen, Armada, and even S2J were really close and by no means dominant. Consistency isn't placing high in 2/2 tournaments and a couple locals. You have to consistently play against the top players and beat them convincingly."
SSBM,3dvswv,TheNak1123,24,Mon Jul 20 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"His bracket was easy at Apex? He played PPU, who beat HBox, and S2J, who's a top 20 player before top 8. In top 8 he played the players who got 2nd and 3rd. He didn't play Mango or HBox because they got eliminated earlier, because they weren't playing as well as PP.   He didn't play Mango in winners semis at Evo because Mango lost to a player he was fully expected to beat. He played Sfat earlier (who's arguably better than Ice, who Mango played) and Hugs, who nearly made top 8. He played Plup in semis, who beat and outplaced Mango, and 2-0d him. He then lost to Armada (who won the tourney), and HBox (who beat the players who came in 4th and 5th). PP did not have an easy bracket at Evo.  PP outplayed everyone at Apex. At Evo, he played like a god while Mango and Leffen lost to two players they were heavily favored against. Armada, Plup, and HBox beat gods at Evo. No one else did. PP is the only god besides the two in GF who didn't lose to a non-god. In fact, he 2-0d the player who sent Mango to losers and eliminated Leffen."

Granted I'm pretty sure he would have beat Mango today since Mango was also not looking great but still, this particular third at Evo is not necessary indicative of a Top 3 player.  But it's hard to argue otherwise too.  I mean... first and third at the two big tourneys this year.  That's nothing to sneeze at.

I mean if Leffen was getting WORKED by Plup at CEO (and Leffen was amazing at that tournament andwithout a doubt, significantly stronger than he was at APEX where PP barely beat him 3-2) then I think Plup would have had a chance to take a game off PP."
SSBM,3dvswv,kr4yt,2,Mon Jul 20 10:58:51 2015 UTC,You can't really say the extent to which Plup's controller was broken (unless you've spoken to him yourself?)... and it was certainly good enough for him to beat Leffen. I'm not saying Plup can't take a game off PP but I doubt that his controller was the reason for him not doing so.
SSBM,3dvswv,DarthBane_,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:10 2015 UTC,Um.. He spilled beer all over it. There's a tweet directly from him saying how he spilled beer and ruined his best controller ever.
SSBM,3dvswv,kr4yt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"I know he did, you don't even know if he used that controller for a start, do you? You also don't know the extent to which it was broken, like I said :p. And like I also said, clearly it was good enough for him to beat Leffen, and it's not even like Leffen played badly. Plup played incredibly well, so clearly whatever controller he was using wasn't effecting him too badly. Neither of us know for sure however, so we ought to agree to disagree instead of speculating haha"

SSBM,3dvswv,bogpanovic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:15 2015 UTC,I haven's seen much data for him this year apart from his phenomenal EVO run and making top 32 at Apex and CEO. I wish I could replace Fly with a composite Icies main because I think all 4 of them are capable of top 8 given the right bracket.

PP didn't beat a single god to get third at evo, and played absolutely terrible (by his standards) the whole time. Plup has been on a tear, and axe is a pillar of consistency. Westballz, on the other hand, is extremely inconsistent, losing to Ken and chudat. However, when he's on point, he is ON POINT. Shroomed usually does very well at majors, this evo being am exception, as he got top 8 at apex and CEO.   Just outside the top 10 are pewpewu, lucky, and silentwolf."
SSBM,3dvswv,Ivacaftor,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:40 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with your arguments here.. Yes, PPMD lost against Armada and Hbox pretty convincingly (he still went down to the last stock in 5 games), but he lost against two GODS. Leffen and Mango lost to Plup, who played really well but he's not a god.   PP did look shaky in brackets in the first game but his Falco was amazing after the first games, especially against Sfat.   Leffen lost games to DruggedFox and Axe. He also lost against Plup who hasn't played Samus since Paragon (I think?).  My point is Leffen, Mango and PPMD looked shaky this tournament. I agree with Leffen on #2 but I would argue Mango is 4th at most and maybe even 5th if you solely look at Apex and Evo."

PP made it to winners finals at both of the two largest tournies of the year. At Apex, He beat Leffen (who dominated part of the summer of smash) and Armada, who is the best in the world atm. At Evo, he was the only god that played like one, excluding the two in GFs."
SSBM,3dvswv,MyLifeForKFC,3,Mon Jul 20 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"He got 6 0ed by gods lol at evo. He also beat leffen before the summer as you may have noticed, times actually do change."
SSBM,3dvswv,Dublshine,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:02:09 2015 UTC,"At evo, pp beat sfat, hugs, and plup. He went to game 3 in two of those sets and didn't take a single game off a god. Mango lost 2 games to a non God (same as pp) and leffen dropped 1. Hell, I don't think ice or druggedfox dropped any.   Pp made it to winners finals largely because of his seeding and the fact that mango was upset. You could argue back and forth whether mango would have beaten him in semis, but mango certainly would've played better than today because he went on tilt after being sent to losers.   It's hard to place pp right now, but leffen deserves second because not only did he win the previous super major, but he also won three tournaments in a row without dropping a set, and has had armada's number as of late."
SSBM,3dvswv,neros_neurosis,6,Mon Jul 20 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's a very good argument for Leffen at #2, but I think PP has it because he's performed better than almost everyone at the two biggest tournaments of the year.   You could argue back and forth whether mango would have beaten him in semis, but mango certainly would've played better than today because he went on tilt after being sent to losers.   Oh, come on. That has to be the silliest Mango john of all time. For Christ's sake, Mango is known for playing exceptionally in losers.  CEO was arguably not a super major. It had only four of the top six, and half as many entrants as Apex. Leffen did win three tournaments in a row, but just now at Evo he didn't win. It wasn't a pretty tournament for Leffen, at least not compared to the standard we hold the gods to."
SSBM,3dvswv,Dublshine,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:27:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to John for mango, ppmd is easily my favorite of the gods and I don't particularly care for mango, I just think if mango got to semis he had a solid shot of beating PP. His fox played just about as well as I've ever seen vs leffen at the salty suite, and he was clearly shaken when he was playing today. Again, not trying to John.   I'm not trying to PP is clearly not the second best player in the world; nothing is clear when it comes to PP. He simply doesn't have the results to back up 2nd place. There's just no evidence that he's even as good as he was at apex. On stream he said he didn't feel ready for evo and it showed in his play.

It's one of the most accurate lists I've seen.   Armada pretty undisputed in terms of consistency and placings. Although, he does have trouble with leffen he has proven that he can beat leffen.  Mango although got a ""bad"" placement at evo still has his general consistency of beating hbox and other various gods. his showing at the salty suite proves that he picked up the fox ditto and was able to beat leffen, one of the best in the MU. so Mango deserving of the #2 at least.   Hbox pretty consistent and #2 at EVO got the win over PPMD, who did win Apex, but he still got the game over PP and with the lack of data on PP Hbox leaves the standings to go to Hbox.  PPMD and leffen placements can go either way but I don't feel that recent placings and lack of matches between PP and leffen offer substantial reason to place leffen over PP.  lolM2k, but he still wins tourneys, is currently struggling with the gods+leffen but still dominates everyone else (including plup, see Smash n Splash GF).  Plup has been on fire and its pretty hard to argue against this placement. With recent victories over mango and leffen he gets a high spot. You can argue that he can be higher but with the consistency of the gods you can't just have someone breach top 6 without at least proving you can do it multiple times and not drop sets to anyone below you.  8 9 and 10 are a bit iffy because PewPewU kills at the fox MU and is a great player and shroomed axe lucky and westballz play phenomenally, but with axes placing in top 8 twice in two years he deserves that spot westballz dropped the ball this tourney by losing to ken, but giving him the benefit of the doubt for having a bad tourney (it happens to all of us) I wouldn't throw him down the ranks quite yet. And I would put shroomed over PPU and lucky becuase of his recent placings and lucky's lack thereof   Edit:Adding Spaces."

Mango at #2 is pretty dumb. He hasn't won anything with more than one other god present since Big House, has dropped a number of sets to non-gods, Leffen has won multiple majors in that time, PPMD has outplaced Mango at every tournament they've both attended in the last year, and Hbox has more wins over Armada and PPMD in the last year than Mango does.

SSBM,3dvswv,particlemaniac,0,Mon Jul 20 19:26:56 2015 UTC,"The reason I placed Mango that high is because of his achievements this year. These past 4 weeks we've seen three tournaments where Leffen played well, but we have not seen that any other time this year (Apart from Beast V, but that was super early and only had 5 or so good players). It's been either Armada, Mango or PPMD taking the tournament. The reason I put Hbox above PPMD is because of his dominating win over him yesterday as well as his sick consistency.  I also believe that players generally play better on majors, where Leffen's best result has been third (Apex (No, European majors are not real majors))  Also, Leffen struggles with some low tier matchups. He was unable to even take down a god when it really mattered, meaning the only person to do so was Plup."

Can't choose. Lucky, Westballz, PewPewU, Shroomed, Sfat and even Hugs all have arguments for it. Maybe if we see more Javi, he eventually could be there. Hax without insomnia could also be there."
SSBM,3dvswv,particlemaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:20:18 2015 UTC,"EVO is an entirely different beast to other big tournaments. Almost every second/third tier player was there. People like Javi and aMSa who are very good and are genuine threats to even the top players attended, and thus the best have to prove themselves against them too.  It's also just so big. Being up there in front of the FGC and being on stage at CEO are two entirely different things, and you can see how it affects some players more than others. Armada could absolutely deal with it, and Hungrybox even seems to do better when it's there. Leffen didn't seem to play nearly as well either.  There is something to be said about how there were 5 matches in this tournament that were Bo3 and not Bo5 as they usually would be. This is likely (just statistically speaking) to have affected some placements somewhat too.  So while EVO is definitely a super important tournament, I wouldn't expect the placements to reflect what we're likely to see at tournaments in the near future as much as CEO, which was also very large, had most of the most relevant players in attendance, and is far more similar to other tournaments in many aspects.  Bearing this in mind, Leffen could very easily still be top, although it's hard to call. I've put the players in groups since distinguishing them is pretty difficult, and its hard to say how much weight the EVO results should have.  1/2 Leffeb/Armada  3 Hbox  4/5 Mango/PPMD  6 M2K  7/8 Axe/Plup  9 Westballz  10 Shroomed  Edit: Changed my list a little bit since I change my mind about the order of 3/4/5 every 3 minutes lol  Edit 2: changed it again, decided Hbox deserved better"
SSBM,3dvswv,Ferdyshtchenko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"say how much weight the EVO results should have.   This doesn't make sense. Especially after you place Hbox @ 3, which can only be justified by placing a lot of importance on Evo. CEO was important but also below Apex, which is below Evo in terms of importance. There's no way to make a good argument about Leffen being a slight #1 because of his hot summer streak, especially when you consider his inconsistent/poor results in the spring. #1 is undisputedly Armada. #2 and #3 could go either to Leffen or PPMD. Hbox does have a solid case for #3."
SSBM,3dvswv,particlemaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:23 2015 UTC,Hungrybox did very well at FC returns too; he beat Armada and has beat Leffen at EVO in what would have been a Bo3 anyway. To be honest the main point of my comment was to say that EVO shouldn't really have a massive amount more weighting than CEO or other summer tournaments. I just find it odd that people were calling Leffen no.1 then EVO happens and suddenly Armada is 'indisputably better'. Like surely they'd now be roughly the same?
SSBM,3dvswv,Blahcookies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"I hear you but the fact is that you'd be part of a very small minority who does not think Evo is of much greater significance than other tournaments.

SSBM,3dvswv,zjak92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"Bagh. Evo just left so many questions unanswered. That's what upset me the most. We learned that sheiks with good tech chasing are extremely dangerous. With druggedfox and plup doing serious damage. I feel that there's still no clear order of the gods now except armada is insanely consistent and currently beats ppmd (which isn't insanely telling because this was his first major in 6 months) and hbox( which was fairly established before Evo). The main questions of who was the best amongst mango armada leffen and pp is still very vague. Mangos loss to hbox wasn't a fluke but those two sd's were very very unusual and ubfortunate. I don't think anyone would call it a solid win for hbox, but moreso a bad loss for mango. Leffen was beat fairly but I still wouldn't say hbox is the better player. Mango and leffen losing to plup and his performance in general prove he's the real deal but even moreso prove how dangerous sheik can be off the grab. I expect the top players to focus on the Sheik mu strongly in the near future to counter this (no offense to druggedfox but I don't think he's at the level to challenge mango and leffen in such a manner.) Evo left a sour taste in my mouth. Hopefully pp going to more tourneys soon will help establish his placing amongst the  I can't really rank the gods except put armada at number one. And even that isn't unquestioned. He was beat handily by leffen frequently before Evo in bo5s. Mango leffen pp and hbox showed at Evo that there is no consistent dominant of the bunch. Hbox beat pp, mango outplayed but lost to hbox. Leffen lost to hbox but was so consistently good pre Evo that he can't be ranked lower than any of them. And pp lost to hbox badly, but didn't lose to a non god. After those 5, you have m2k and westballz on good days, and axe and plup floating around in that area. I don't think plup is a fluke, I think he's great but I think some time should be given before he's considered ahead of westballz axe and m2k."

I think I still will give it to Armada, in part because of his consistency, but I don't think there's a big gap at all between the two. The gap between Armada and Leffen is much smaller than the gap between them and number 3 (who I would say is PP, but he's very hard to rank, and a lot of the concerns people are citing are valid)."

PP in comparison has only a 1st and a 3rd at the tournaments Armada came 2nd and 1st, Mango came 4th at apex and 5th at evo, leffen came 5th at evo, 9th at press start and 5th at Sandstorm, Hbox has basically only one notable win all year (paragon) and placed outside top 3 at Press Start, Apex, Sandstorm, and CEO.   So if not Armada first, then who? I'd say Leffen, PP and maybe Mango are closest, but there's no doubt that Armada has a much more impressive resume this year, showing much more consistent top level play than anyone else, as well as being the winner of the biggest tournament of all time and 2nd at the 2nd biggest tournament of all time.   In all seriousness, if not Armada, then who? At the moment, the arguments to be made for the other top players are noticably weaker. Perhaps the best argument I can think of to come up with someone other than Armada being the best would be to arbitrarily only look at the last month of play, where leffen's 3 wins in 3 weeks starts to look really good, even when placed next to Armada's win at the biggest tourney of all time, but by any other metric or looking at any other timeframe I don't think anyone else has a leg to stand on."
SSBM,3dvswv,Ferdyshtchenko,3,Mon Jul 20 05:48:34 2015 UTC,"He's shown consistency but not dominance. It still counts for something. Are we gunna say the best player in the world almost lost to druggedfox and then got 5th? One could argue that, but one could also argue against it."

SSBM,3dvswv,4estZJ,4,Sun Jul 19 23:31:11 2015 UTC,"Your list is good except for hbox. He had a great evo but is straight up not as good as Leffen, PP, and Mango."
SSBM,3dvswv,qweyroiquoi,2,Mon Jul 20 00:17:58 2015 UTC,"yeah i think that the top foxes have really gotten a grasp on the fox - puff matchup. it takes exceptional play from hbox to win, but foxes have a very clear cut strategy that works. unless someone develops a good counter for runaway fox vs puff, i dont see it happening."
SSBM,3dvswv,4estZJ,2,Sun Jul 19 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree - Hbox showed he could beat Leffen in tourney, something mango hasn't been able to do since May. He straight up 3-0'd ppmd in a super solid performance, and while i do agree that leffen is probably overall still higher than hbox, he still had a super strong showing.   When you compare the similar matchups that hbox had at FC Return vs Mango at WTFox, Hbox is stronger there too. Both 3-1 v Wizzrobe, Hbox took a set off armada 3-1 while mango only clutched it out last stock 3-2, and mango got 3-0'd by leffen while Hbox had 2 1-3 losses, but again showed he could adapt at EVO. After Armada, Leffen>Hbox>PPMD>Mango imo."
SSBM,3dvswv,TheNak1123,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:03 2015 UTC,"Hbox is dropping more and more sets to non-top 6 foxes, he has been out placed by leffen since 2014, PP since 2011, and Mango forever. He has never won a tournament where the top 3 have attended, he has a losing record against all of them, and besides paragon he hasn't won anything since apex 2010. Sorry, but I don't care if hbox beat wizzrobe by one more game than mango did, it's not relevant, and if it is then so is the fact that hbox has dropped entire sets to him. His Evo was fantastic (for him, Mango wouldn't be happy with 2nd), but he is not as good as Leffen, PP, and Mango, even if there is a varianace in all of these player's performances."
SSBM,3dvswv,HortonHearsAGenocide,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:46 2015 UTC,"You clearly didn't read anything I said other than the last sentence and 2. you said I brought up irrelevant facts, but your points of reference were lifetime records against players and tourney placings over the past couple of years - we're talking about now. Hbox undisputedly had a better showing at FC Return than Mango did at WTFox given they fought the same matches and Hbox had better records. And even more recently, he clearly did better at EVO. And you really have no grounds for PP > Hbox, Hbox has beaten him in the head to head the last 3 times and PPMD doesn't really have tourney placings/matchups to prove otherwise right now."
SSBM,3dvswv,qweyroiquoi,-2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"How Mango and Hbox perform against wizzrobe is irrelevent. If we're talking about more recent tourneys, Mango won press start, destroying hbox along the way, and PP won the last Apex. They're more impressive than hbox, and despite what just happened at Evo they are the favourites to win over him."
SSBM,3dvswv,KJJBA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"Again, you really didn't read what I said, because I said that Wizzrobe matches were even between the 2 players, and that was just one point out of the many you're not addressing. Also, tournaments that were within the past 3 weeks are better points of reference for a current ranking than tournaments that were 2 months ago and half a year ago. Your points might have validity in a ranking that encompasses all of 2015, but that's not what the original post was about, now was it?"
SSBM,3dvswv,qweyroiquoi,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:49:34 2015 UTC,"HBox is one of the few that doesn't seem to struggle much against the non-gods. Leffen by comparison has a considerably tougher time with Axe and Plup. Plus HBox took the set in Sandstorm and in EVO top 16 so I put him a little over Leffen after EVO.  PP hasn't given us much to go on. I'm just refraining from placing him high when he only beat Plup in top 8 and still hasn't met Mango in tourney or beaten HBox in tourney.  The question asks how I rank them NOW. With Mango, Leffen, and PP having weak performances while HBox makes a comeback, I place him a little higher. If it asked all time, I'd probably put HBox at 5th or 6th."
SSBM,3dvswv,Dublshine,4,Mon Jul 20 01:45:56 2015 UTC,HBox is one of the few that doesn't seem to struggle much against the non-gods.   This is simply not true. He struggles a lot against many mid-tier Foxes simply because of the matchup and he usually loses to Plup. Today was out of the norm for their most recent matchups.
SSBM,3dvswv,kuando,2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:32 2015 UTC,"Actually Hbox is dropping more and more sets to non-top 6 foxes, he has been out placed by leffen since 2014, he has never won a tournament where the top 3 have attended, he has a losing record against all of them, and besides paragon he hasn't won anything since apex 2010. His Evo was fantastic, but he is not as good as Leffen, PP, and Mango."
SSBM,3dvswv,DarthBane_,0,Sun Jul 19 23:56:44 2015 UTC,Hungrybox has done better than Leffen exactly has many times as Leffen has done better than Hungrybox at tournaments this year. And Leffen has lost to more non-top 6 players this year than Hungrybox has. Leffen has a losing record against the top 3 as well and Hungrybox is the only one who has won a tournament where all 3 of them were there besides them.
SSBM,3dvswv,KreatorExodus,0,Sun Jul 19 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"Between his wins at Beast, CEO, FC Fox, etc. he has had a much better 2015 than hbox.

SSBM,3dvswv,Terr0rbyte,2,Mon Jul 20 03:36:34 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts:   M2k is not 9th. He recently had very close sets with mango and leffen and destroyed plup in 2 sets, 6-0.  Amsa is certainly not top 10. He's really good in the sheik and fox matchups, but he has trouble with other mus and has major consistency issues (even worse than westballz).  I agree with PP at 5th he doesn't deserve top 3 if he's not gonna go to any tournaments then play like shit at evo."

Conclusion?

SSBM,3du8lt,EnigmaticScarecrow,2,Mon Jul 20 06:28:40 2015 UTC,I called Hbox beating Leffen!!
SSBM,3du8lt,NanchoMan,5,Mon Jul 20 03:48:04 2015 UTC,Someone remind me about this for TBH.  reddit.com/live
SSBM,3du8lt,krispness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:17:39 2015 UTC,"lol I'll remind you. I wanted to do one but didn't know how, guess I should've mentioned it."
SSBM,3du8lt,Dublshine,20,Mon Jul 20 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"Just wanna point out that druggedfox and ice both lost to leffen and mango to get 9th, while PP beat no gods to get 3rd. The power of seeding."
SSBM,3du8lt,Falcoooooo,3,Mon Jul 20 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"What's it got to do with seeding? The seeding was set up for a Mango/PP winner's semi, he should've needed to beat 1 God for third.  He transitively beat Mang0 and Leffen ;)"
SSBM,3du8lt,Dekachin,3,Mon Jul 20 01:56:31 2015 UTC,"well, hugs had a huge upset over Axe, who could've posed a major threat to PP. plup upset mango so he didn't have to play mango in semis. so due to upsets he, due to no action of his own, had a pretty free bracket. but honestly, you can only play the matches you're given, so it's hard to make any real conclusions."
SSBM,3du8lt,coralmonsterr,4,Mon Jul 20 12:42:57 2015 UTC,"But PP beat Plup who beat both Leffen and Mango, so it's not totally undeserved. Double elim tournies never really determine any places beyond 1 and 2 with any reliability."
SSBM,3du8lt,mylox,4,Mon Jul 20 10:12:00 2015 UTC,"It just happens sometimes with upsets lol. Westballz got 4th at Paragon and CEO, outplacing a god at each despite not beating a god himself because of Plup beating Leffen and Shroomed beating Mango."
SSBM,3du8lt,Dublshine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:50:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm just saying it's pretty unusual for someone to get third at a tournament like evo without beating at least one god.
SSBM,3du8lt,ar21plasma,5,Mon Jul 20 04:51:54 2015 UTC,Maybe he would've played a god if Mango didn't get wrecked. The power of Plup.
SSBM,3du8lt,Skytch,32,Mon Jul 20 06:33:21 2015 UTC,I honestly felt like Top 32 was miles better than Top 8. The only real exception being Plup vs Leffen.
SSBM,3du8lt,westbrookswardrobe,8,Mon Jul 20 04:20:09 2015 UTC,Axe v Leffen was also great
SSBM,3du8lt,wickedfarts,4,Mon Jul 20 01:29:35 2015 UTC,Is top 32 going to be put on youtube or anything? I had to work through today and yesterday so I got to watch 0 EVO.

SSBM,3du8lt,white015,4,Mon Jul 20 02:07:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, top 8 didn't have too many great sets (the 2 leffen was in were solid but not insanely hype) and I don't think melee really put on a great show this year. It was a pretty bad look for the community imo and I wouldn't be surprised to see the game get moved to Saturday finals after that."
SSBM,3du8lt,KG1639,3,Mon Jul 20 02:10:18 2015 UTC,Top 8 wouldve been amazing if Hbox wasnt in it.
SSBM,3du8lt,waaxz,14,Mon Jul 20 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"200k viewers, it aint moving nowhere lmao."
SSBM,3du8lt,krispness,13,Mon Jul 20 12:17:51 2015 UTC,"200K twitch viewers..... Nah but they might take away Bo5 outside of GFs.   Evo is never super hype though. Wobbles going 6-1 vs mango or HBox playing 2 sets against armada with puff ylink. It just seems players at Evo never play as good as they usually do, except hbox at every Evo so far and mango before. Armada did good this time but thinking back to MLG, everyone played their very best there and even big house had better sets. I think it's the Bo3s. So far I've felt that top 32 is more exciting than top 8 at Evo."
SSBM,3du8lt,mdz1,11,Mon Jul 20 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be fine. I felt the same way last year (2 sets of ylink/puff....) but I think we had a better top 8 this time and we still pulled in 200k viewers which will only be beaten by sf if anybody. Also judging from the twitter feeds of the evo higher ups I don't think they really understand smash well enough to realize it wasn't a great top 8, they seem super satisfied. It is weird and unfortunate that evo 2014/15 are probably two of the worst top 8s I can think of melee nationals pretty much all time lol."
SSBM,3du8lt,white015,2,Mon Jul 20 01:30:22 2015 UTC,"These are some very good points and you're probably right. One thing to note is that while 2014 had 2 sets of ylink puff, it also had silentwolf vs axe which was one of the standout moments of the the entire event for a lot of the casual viewers. Hbox also played a lot less lame (no ledge camping) and there wasn't an 8 minute timeout. I'm not saying melees getting cut from evo, just that I feel like it's a lot more likely the game gets moved to Saturday or Friday if they make it a 4 day event (probably some sort of smash block on the second day where they go through all of smash 4 top 32 then all of melee top 32 with losers on one stream and winners on another)"
SSBM,3du8lt,ar21plasma,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:30 2015 UTC,That's implying that sm4sh is going to be back
SSBM,3du8lt,white015,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"It had the second most entrants, it's gonna be back next year. Melee top 8 wasn't even significantly more hype than it (top 32 obviously was though). Now, I think there's gonna be a huge drop off next and it's unlikely it'll be back in 2016 but it's silly to think that a game that only had less entrants than ultra won't return"
SSBM,3du8lt,ar21plasma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:25:10 2015 UTC,"It may have had the second most entrants but that's easily explained by it being a new game that a bunch of kids wanted to try. I'm pretty sure that by next year, the novelty of the game will have worn off and considering that the game is inherently non-competitive, the meta will not evolve and most of its scene will lose interest. Not only that, but I'm almost certain that sm4sh was even at Evo because Nintendo wanted it there. Don't forget that Melee earned its spot at Evo through the power of the community and Sm4sh just piggybacked on Melee's success and probably through Nintendo's influence. The fgc barely likes us as it is, and I can see how they would see sm4sh as an insult to their scene and tournament. That and the fact that only 95K people watched while melee top 32 had like 150K right afterwards makes me seriously doubt that sm4sh will be reinvited."
SSBM,3du8lt,Falcoooooo,2,Mon Jul 20 04:52:14 2015 UTC,"It was one of the best attended and best viewed events (on Saturday). It'll almost certainly be back next year, what's happening is that you don't want it to be back and are twisting the facts to fit your bias.   easily explained by it being a new game that a bunch of kids wanted to try   Good, mature start to your points.   the novelty of the game will have worn off and considering that the game is inherently non-competitive, the meta will not evolve and most of its scene will lose interest   Yep, I'm sure your personal opinion will be a big factor in whether Smash 4 will be at Evo.   I'm almost certain that sm4sh was even at Evo because Nintendo wanted it there   Nintendo don't give a shit about Evo, Smash 4 was there because it's one of the biggest fighting games around.   I can see how they would see sm4sh as an insult to their scene and tournament   Why?"
SSBM,3du8lt,TheStupidareFunny,3,Mon Jul 20 05:26:37 2015 UTC,I know this is a melee sub but to be fair People played Brawl well into 2014 and I expect Smash 4 to go strong until smash 5 it might drop in attendies but until smash 5 comes out every year will have at least 1 tournament with 400+ attendies

SSBM,3du8lt,riceandcow,8,Mon Jul 20 13:43:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially how surprising it was. After CEO I didn't think in a million years he would bust out he Samus. His controller issues and bad mindset after losing to PP might have actually been a benefit to him in the end, strangely."

SSBM,3du8lt,HeroEMIYA,5,Sun Jul 19 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"Also shoutouts to him for playing like an absolute monster. Sure, Mango was SDing - But Hungrybox was pushing him to do that. He 3-0'd PPMD and gave Armada the fight for his life.  It's absolutely crazy how fragile he shows Fox in his sets. People really need to study up on his EVO sets cause he clearly plays his best at EVO. Consistent Top 3 placings since 2013 (3rd, 2nd, 2nd)."
SSBM,3du8lt,icuepawns,15,Sun Jul 19 22:34:35 2015 UTC,"Shoutout to Hungrybox for selling himself as the classiest loser of a major event that you have ever seen.   I am not implying that he is necessarily a classless person, and obviously no character flaw of any sort can take away from what he accomplished today, but I will say that he is very aware that people are watching.  Edit: I understand (and probably deserve) the negative reception. I also really appreciate it. Clearly I did not articulate myself very well in this comment, and I will figure out how to convey my thoughts more clearly in the future. Thank you :)  Also, I want to make it known that I bear no animosity toward Hbox at all, and it is great to see him being happy and truly enjoying himself here. I just wanted to raise a point in regards to the comment I replied to (one that the commenter did not seem to have considered); a point that I based on anecdotal evidence I have received from people who have interacted with Hbox in more private environments. AGAIN, I do not think that he is a bad person or anything like that. He does what he believes he should do based on what he has experienced throughout his life, and I have (at best) minimal knowledge of what exactly that entails.  Please forgive my inarticulacy (if you think that is the right thing to do)."
SSBM,3du8lt,FemtoG,2,Sun Jul 19 22:50:36 2015 UTC,This is 100% on the money.  It's so funny to me how people are divided between HBox being genuine vs. HBox being fake.  The very fact that such a divide exists (compared to any other player) should tell you HBox believers something.
SSBM,3du8lt,icuepawns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. Mango and Leffen had a pretty interesting conversation on Mango's stream last week about how almost every good player is really arrogant behind closed doors.

I think hungrybox made a case for him being very relevant as a challenger to the leffen/armada/ppmd/mango crowd that people had been saying were simply out of his reach. I think Armada has made a case for him being the best this year, with consistent placings and an evo win (which counts for a lot). Otherwise yeah I think we'll need to see how people play the next tournaments, as we still have only limited data points on PPMD and M2K has also been to fewer big events than normal. We'll see."

Of course this is optional since you don't need that channel to watch melee, whereas this place is pretty central, but I think it could turn out well.

I personally think its absurd to expect any kind of ""deep"" discussion or any kind of discussion in a live chat room after it hits more than 30 people. Especially when watching a big event where honestly, there isn't much to discuss/time to analyze shit since its happening right there. If you want to chat with people while watching melee just make a smash fest or make a skype call with friends or other smashers, I doubt you will ever get much from a bunch of strangers in a unrestricted chatroom."

SSBM,3dy33i,Chris1and2,13,Mon Jul 20 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"If we're going off past achievements, Mango. It will take a very long time before anyone can surpass his level of dominance. But if we're talking strictly here and now, Armada is the best player at the moment."
SSBM,3dy33i,Mallow-kun,7,Mon Jul 20 17:22:47 2015 UTC,there's no question that it's mango
SSBM,3dy33i,dr_piss,30,Mon Jul 20 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"Mango can have the title of Goat. How long does someone have to keep winning? I'm surprised he hasn't retired. No one has touched his various runs through Pound 3, RoM, Pound 4, Genesis, Impulse 2012, Zenith 2013, Evo 2013, MLG, Evo 2014, Big house 4. He has consistently won the largest tournies in the game up until this past 6 month stretch."
SSBM,3dy33i,krispness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:28 2015 UTC,well theres the genesis 2 apex 2012 apex 2013 era which was clearly armada's unless you hold it against him that he didn't fly over for more than 3 tournaments...
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"He definitely has that era, but how does that equate to ""of all time""? Since his retirement Evo was the first super major he won"
SSBM,3dy33i,krispness,22,Tue Jul 21 13:20:42 2015 UTC,Mang0. Pretty much no question about it. Showed the world complete dominance during the summer of smash.
SSBM,3dy33i,I_read_comments,10,Mon Jul 20 14:06:23 2015 UTC,Just not this summer
SSBM,3dy33i,fraynor,4,Mon Jul 20 15:31:01 2015 UTC,He's actually shown lots of improvement as summer went on.
SSBM,3dy33i,rrexyl,10,Mon Jul 20 18:54:56 2015 UTC,"Still Mang0, I have not heard any claims from other people to be the GOAT."
SSBM,3dy33i,Exdeath64,2,Mon Jul 20 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"Most dominate, easily Ken. Best of all time, either Mango or Armada"
SSBM,3dy33i,actual_ness,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"It seems like Mango is the overwhelming choice here, so I guess I'm going to play devil's advocate. Here's part of the case for Armada.  Although Armada's win percent at majors is approximately 10% lower than Mango's. However, before the summer of smash, one of the most dominant runs in recent memory, Armada entered retirement briefly, after winning Apex 2013. After that Apex, it was fairly clear that Armada was the current best in the world. By retiring he shot himself in the foot for the tournaments that followed. Needing to spend approximately a year and a half playing catch-up to the other top level players. Mango's run of dominance over the summer of smash benefitted from his biggest challenge (Armada) shooting himself in the foot.   Also, if we gauge player skill by win/loss records, Armada is the clear best. The man is a model of consistency who has not lost to someone not named Mango, PPMD, Leffen, Hbox, or M2K for the last 7 years.   Additionally he came to prominence in what was a fairly barren region for smash, in a continent with much lesser competition. It is safe to say that Armada had the toughest smash community situation out of all of the gods.  Just my two cents."
SSBM,3dy33i,Luma_not,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:18 2015 UTC,"Also, if we gauge player skill by win/loss records, Armada is the clear best.

SSBM,3dy33i,rd1027,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain on the dates, but he hasn't lost to anyone not in the god-tier of player for a very very long time."

SSBM,3dy33i,TrappedInMyMind1,10,Tue Jul 21 06:11:36 2015 UTC,Mango.This isn't much of a question. No one has his level of accomplishments.
SSBM,3dy33i,Jamarac,8,Mon Jul 20 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how you much you weight underperformances at major tournaments (Mango has more of these), and how much more value you put on first place over second-third (Armada has a ton of these).  If you penalize Mango at all for his relatively disappointing performances at majors, then suddenly Armada's resume starts to look really pretty. But if you simply count the first place finishes at major tournaments, it's hard to argue against Mango. It's pretty impossible for Armada to compete with Mango on the latter, just because of years playing + Mango had many more opportunities to go to tournaments because he's lived in the US."
SSBM,3dy33i,_Panda,14,Mon Jul 20 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"They are only disappointing because you always expected Mango to win. Getting 4th at Apex is only disappointing for a player of the highest caliber. He undeniably has those kinds of placings more than Armada, but placing 1st really is a lot more impressive than anything else. Placing 5th often isn't much or any worse than finishing 2nd or 3rd, depending on how the bracket shakes down. I think you can absolutely consider Mango's losses, even weigh them pretty heavily, and still find that Mango has a better career record."
SSBM,3dy33i,just_dan,6,Mon Jul 20 15:46:32 2015 UTC,1st place at the most important events and having long periods of established dominance are what counts the most and Mango beats Armada in both counts. Not to mention he has played at the top level with several characters and won super majors with 2 (on top of smaller but still impressive wins with falco).
SSBM,3dy33i,Jamarac,2,Mon Jul 20 15:50:55 2015 UTC,won super majors with 2   you could be talking about either person right now
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"Armada got 4th place at Pound 4, EVO 2013, Sktar 3, Big House 4, and 5th place at Paragon.   People just don't remember those low placings. They excuse them. They john for him.   Mango has 2 5th place or worse finishes in his career since his asent, and they happened this year (Sandstorm and EVO). Armada has 1, at Paragon, which was also this year.   That's it, for both of them, in over 6 years of the highest professional play in their field. They're both insanely consistent with placings. Mango wins more, and historically wins at a better rate than Armada."
SSBM,3dy33i,Condoriano10,4,Tue Jul 21 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"If you penalize Mango at all for his relatively disappointing performances at majors   If by ""relatively disappointing"" you mean ""has only missed Top 4 twice in literally years when playing his mains"" then yeah that's really disappointing  /s wtf  I'm not a Mango fanboy by any stretch, I was rooting for an Armada-PPMD Grand Finals, but Mango's never placed outside the Top 5 while playing his mains since becoming gdlk.  Not seeing it."
SSBM,3dy33i,Habefiet,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"Been arguing this with various people and its astonishing how many people don't understand the scope of Mango's career. This really isn't a debate on so many levels, and it would take several more large victories from Armada while Mango got none for it to even be close."
SSBM,3dy33i,just_dan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"Still easily Mango. Armada would be next. Then if Leffen keeps winning, maybe we'll have to consider him if he gets some super majors under his belt. PP doesn't go to nearly enough events and honestly APEX is not that great. It's been at shitty venues that are overcrowded hosted in the winter when statistically everyone plays worse on average. Apex 2015 also went to like 3am or some shit. Ken had arguably the longest reign but it was during a time everyone sucked, so it's different. By definition that's not ""the greatest of ALL time""."
SSBM,3dy33i,TruckJitsu,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:48:56 2015 UTC,I see a lot of people putting Mang0 here but IMO it is Armada. Armada's reign has been much longer than Mang0's and much more consistent. Throughout the past several years Armada has rarely placed out of top 4 and very very rarely placed out of the money. Mang0 has had some bad tournaments in the past.  However both were good players. I think Mang0 is given a little more credit because he took the crown from another great player in Ken while Armada had to take the European crown away from Amsah who has a considerably smaller name value compared to Ken.
SSBM,3dy33i,jaesuk97,19,Mon Jul 20 14:42:41 2015 UTC,Consistently placing second isn't really enough to make him the best IMO.
SSBM,3dy33i,RathKeno,5,Mon Jul 20 15:19:27 2015 UTC,"Much longer? You forgetting 08 and 09 and 2010? You forgetting 2013 and 2014? Because Mango dominated in those years. Mango was the best player in the world for 3 full years before Armada ever won a North American tournament. Armada had a reign of only about 1.5 years before ""retiring."" He is more consistent, but its not like Mango randomly finishes 9th once every couple of months, he finishes, at worst, 5th at stacked tournaments every once in a good while. If you look at their past records, and understand the significance and the history of their careers, Mango's is just a cut above. As impressive as Armada is, and as amazing of a resume as he has, Mango's is even more impressive. The fact that Armada, the consensus #2 player of the modrn era and the fucking insanely consistent wrecking ball he is, has only has a fraction of Mango's success, is probably the greatest testament to how good Mango has been these last 7 years."
SSBM,3dy33i,just_dan,0,Mon Jul 20 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"Throughout the past several years Armada has rarely placed out of top 4 and very very rarely placed out of the money.   Armada has placed Top 4 at all but one tournament (Paragon) in his career. Mango, when trying, has placed Top 4 at all but 2 tournaments (Sandstorm and EVO) in his career.   Mango has been a god-tier player for longer than Armada. He has played in many more god-tiered tournaments than Armada. The only difference between the two players is 1 placing below Top 4 at 1 tournament. That's inconsequential to anyone unless they're scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to defend Armada"
SSBM,3dy33i,Condoriano10,-2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:40 2015 UTC,"At their best, PPMD might be the best. It clearly is among Mang0, PPMD, and Armada. Hungrybox, Mew2king and Leffen are amazing, but they’re just not on the same level."
SSBM,3dy33i,barchueetadonai,4,Mon Jul 20 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"There's no substance to claiming that X player would be the best ""at their best"". It sounds more like you want to believe that PPMD is the best.  Mango has the big wins for his GOAT argument. Armada has less big wins but more consistency for his GOAT (or BOAT) argument. No one else has a good enough argument."
SSBM,3dy33i,Ferdyshtchenko,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"No, but I get the feeling when watching him play that his best is THE best. He hasn’t played a whole lot the past couple of years, but he has mostly dominated while playing."
SSBM,3dy33i,barchueetadonai,-9,Mon Jul 20 19:26:32 2015 UTC,The GOAT is a coinage for Mango. GOAT isn't a title that moves around. It's forever associated with Mango and his period of dominance in 2013 and 2014.
SSBM,3dy33i,brolitaesq,16,Mon Jul 20 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"The goat isn't a nickname for him. It's a term used throughout sports and different competitions. He referred to himself as the GOAT before solidifying his spot as such with 2 EVO, MLG, TBH4 wins and that's the real reason he's now considered the GOAT."
SSBM,3dy33i,Jamarac,22,Mon Jul 20 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"Somebody needs to stop this ""its a title you can't take away"" idea. Its turning into a meme."
SSBM,3dy33i,just_dan,5,Mon Jul 20 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"'Greatest of all time' is actually just a phrase in the english language meaning 'best ever', I can see why this would be confusing though."
SSBM,3dy33i,kr4yt,-5,Mon Jul 20 15:54:02 2015 UTC,hehehhhehe this is slightly arbitrary but only one player has ever won both Apex and EVO
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,7,Mon Jul 20 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"And only one player has ever won TBH, EVO, and MLG and has more than 1 EVO title."
SSBM,3dy33i,Rmbuckley,-14,Mon Jul 20 16:19:42 2015 UTC,TBH is not a supermajor let's be real
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,8,Mon Jul 20 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"I don't really care what title you give it, it's fucking Big House. It was a tournament with every god in attendance and several hundred great players. Even if you don't count it, 2 EVOs and an MLG? lets be real.  EDIT: PPMD was not in attendance at TBH4, regardless my point still stands."
SSBM,3dy33i,Rmbuckley,5,Mon Jul 20 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"This dude is just a huge Armada fanboy, don't waste your time. Had a similar argument with him and he just plays the muh opinion card over and over without saying anything."
SSBM,3dy33i,just_dan,-8,Mon Jul 20 19:27:40 2015 UTC,2 Apexes and an EVO.  Of course you can't count TBH lol. How can your point stand?
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,5,Mon Jul 20 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"They're fairly even players. I'm arguing that they are incredibly close in achievements. I don't know what you're arguing, but you've only supported my arguments. That's why you're getting down voted. No one is saying Armada isn't extremely good, but not a person can argue he has had a better legacy than Mang0. There is a reason they have one of the best rivalries in eSports."
SSBM,3dy33i,Rmbuckley,-10,Mon Jul 20 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"i'm getting downvoted because mango nation  you'd think people wouldn't take a statement prefaced with ""this is slightly arbitrary"" so seriously and literally"
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,5,Mon Jul 20 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yes pls scapegoat ""Mang0 nation"" truthfully a lot of people consider TBH a grassroots super major because of its size, who attends, and the legitimacy of it because of who runs it. TBH is JuggleRob's baby and that's why you're getting downvoted as well. Also to go with /u/Krispness's comment, if you don't count TBH4 as a super major then the Apex that Armada won was absolutely not a super major."
SSBM,3dy33i,Rmbuckley,-6,Mon Jul 20 18:01:47 2015 UTC,if you don't count TBH4 as a super major then the Apex that Armada won was absolutely not a super major.   lmao it's an offhanded comment that I even qualified. yeah people took it too seriously and who would do that unless they're huge mango fanbabies?  and LMAO Armada won two Apexes with all of the top 5 and none of them were Apex 2014 which was the one that HE didn't enter. wow you guys can't even keep your facts straight. damn that's pathetic
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,4,Mon Jul 20 18:14:51 2015 UTC,"Again I have literally no idea what you're trying to argue because you come at me with random shit every time you talk. This is my argument: Mang0 and Armada's achievements are extremely comparable and it is impossible to put one ahead of the other. These are the things you have argued so far: TBH4 is less important than Apex 2012 and 2013. People are only disagreeing with you because they're ""Mang0 fanbabys"" and that I'm pathetic. I have literally no idea what you're even trying to say at this point."
SSBM,3dy33i,Rmbuckley,5,Mon Jul 20 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"No one really cared until the BH4 comment. Just don't dig the hole deeper by trying to argue it while being so condescending, it's your replies people are downvoting."
SSBM,3dy33i,krispness,4,Mon Jul 20 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"TBH4 had 600+ people and all of top 6 in attendance. It was a super major. I mean you're comparing it to the Apex armada won, same players, leffen not a threat with 300+ entrants."
SSBM,3dy33i,krispness,-5,Mon Jul 20 17:00:18 2015 UTC,all of top 6 in attendance   uhhhhhh lol
SSBM,3dy33i,Hariooo,5,Mon Jul 20 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"True, PP wasn't there, I guess apex 2014 wasn't a super major then."

SSBM,3dt3m2,Heroic_Lime,35,Sun Jul 19 05:13:58 2015 UTC,Leffen was at Mango's house practicing for the last week. Leffen said Armada would be mad for teaching Mango the Fox ditto but he probably regrets it himself now.
SSBM,3dt3m2,Whimby,13,Sun Jul 19 05:46:30 2015 UTC,He also played against m2k with the ditto and other matchups for several hours after wtfox. Leffen looked like he was going to go off and break his controller again.
SSBM,3dt3m2,JoseElEntrenador,4,Sun Jul 19 07:43:25 2015 UTC,"What if Mango was only pretending to be Leffen's friend, to learn the Fox ditto. All the lost MM, all the pretended gambling problems, all were necessary for the 3-peat?"

SSBM,3dt3m2,nikovan_smash,32,Sun Jul 19 06:55:53 2015 UTC,Incredibly dull match. Kage dominated since the very beginning and when Bizz lost his confidence it was over. Props to both players for giving it their all but it was not hype at all. Poor Bizz.
SSBM,3dt3m2,Ianian58,9,Sun Jul 19 06:59:52 2015 UTC,To be fair on Kage it's not his fault Bizz is a fraud and couldn't even take a game off lol.
SSBM,3dt3m2,nikovan_smash,7,Sun Jul 19 14:45:24 2015 UTC,100% agree. Kage did what he had to do. The fact that it led to a dull match is not his fault.

I don't really think its a sellout thing though, I think gimr just misunderstands what people want out of the salty suite. The apex one this year was way overproduced and imo way worse than the more fgc type ones like were at last evo/apex. Although I'm honestly not sure what most of the smash stream monsters watch since it seemed like most of them liked the Apex one so I think gimr tried to make this like the Apex one but didn't have the time to do so.

That's no big deal if you learn to play with them and build muscle memory to go straight down, or even if you already happened to do that. But if you've played since the game came out like DJ probably has, and you always pushed on the triggers at an angle, the new controllers are practically unusable."

SSBM,3dr5vb,tempestatic,16,Sat Jul 18 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm honestly very surprised he made it top 32. I'm from NY so obviously I'm happy, and I'm making assumptions here about who he had to face to make it there, but I feel like he must have had eas(ier) opponents than most people who made it top 32. And that's in part due to EVO being a huge tournament where seeding every notable player is unrealistic, which is also why I think we see so many upsets.  For example, consider this. Zhu completely wrecked DJ in winner's, but he didn't end up making Top 32 (losing to Leffen and Lucky) while DJ did. I would bet good money that DJ didn't have to play people on the level of Leffen nor Lucky. If my assumptions are right, it's almost like winning that match against DJ was bad for Zhu."
SSBM,3dr5vb,needuhLee,9,Sat Jul 18 18:16:38 2015 UTC,You think it would have been better for zhu to lose to DJ on purpose maybe?
SSBM,3dr5vb,Themightyquinja,23,Sat Jul 18 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Well you could have never known something like that in foresight, but I think if Zhu had lost to DJ, he would have had a better chance at making top 32 than he did winning against DJ.  Zhu's path after winning: Leffen (lose), Mafia (win), Lucky (lose)  DJ's path after losing: Captain Crunch (win), ConnorTheKid (win), Vish (win)  Though DJ's path was certainly not a walk over - he had to play three very solid players that I'm not sleeping on by any means - I'm just saying, I don't think any three of them is on the level of Lucky.  Zhu's harder path is mostly due to Lucky being upset-ish by DruggedFox. So yeah, take it as you will. I guess it happens at any tournament whenever an upset happens. Just sucks that it works out like this."

SSBM,3dr5vb,Pareto_effecient,4,Sun Jul 19 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't count DruggedFox possibly playing Fox because he has not shown to switch to Fox in the past several months of him playing tournament. He claims that he hands hurt whenever he tries to seriously play Fox or train as him, so I wouldn't count him on using Fox anytime soon.   I have yet to see S2J use his Falco in tournament. That might change if he brings it out later today.   Hmmm... I could see the argument for Mango's Falcon.

SSBM,3dr5vb,nostalgic_dinosaur,2,Sun Jul 19 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"Westballz did seriously use Falcon to comeback against HugS at a Mayhem I believe.   I've been told otherwise before, and since I've only seen them use it once in the recent past... I guess I could un-count it.   Ugh. seems like I'm going back and forth at this point."
SSBM,3dr5vb,Shootypatootie,3,Sun Jul 19 02:49:15 2015 UTC,The general rule of thumb when counting a character in top X is if the player actually went that character. Not if they have played them in the past.
SSBM,3dr5vb,jonlin1000,2,Sun Jul 19 03:07:11 2015 UTC,Get rid of Mang0 and Westballz's Falcons. They have no place here. Neither of then used that character in this tournament nor do they dual main. If you're gonna count unused characters why not count Mang0's Marth too? And Plup's Samus? Make sure you don't forget HBox's Ness.

SSBM,3dqlha,TheLastOmishi,21,Sat Jul 18 20:41:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, so does anyone else think that DJ Nintendo threw his game versus Zhu?  He played uncharacteristically poorly. I at least thought very much so. What did he gain? His next game would've been vs. leffen, and as Zhu learned, the side of bracket you get thrown to from losing that match was much more difficult (see their bracket here). Zhu had to go through either lucky or druggedfox, whereas the other side culminated with vish (a good player, but below lucky and I'm pretty sure druggedfox). My theory kind of banks on vish not being as formidable as druggedfox, so if this isn't the case, then I guess you're free to downvote me into oblivion."
SSBM,3dqlha,needuhLee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"Hah, for what it's worth, I said a similar thing in another thread (though without DJ's intention of throwing) without reading your comment."

If he somehow predicted connor over nintendude, he would have had to play nintendude in losers. Anything other than connor beating nintendude and druggedfox beating connor would have made zhu's bracket much easier for dj nintendo, so unless he made uncanny predictions, this is infeasible.  He also could have been playing just as poorly in losers; his bracket was insanely free."
SSBM,3dqlha,ThisIsTheGuy,6,Sat Jul 18 17:58:50 2015 UTC,I think it has more to do with the fact that you can't play slow and turtle with pikachu especially vs falco and that's pretty much DJN's style.
SSBM,3dqlha,Gliffie,20,Sat Jul 18 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"I think 9/10 times, if both were playing their best, Zhu would beat DJN anyway, tbh. Even if DJN was sandbagging, I don't think him trying would have made a difference. No offense to DJN but Zhu is for sure a stronger player."

Please show me these great results that I'm ignoring and I'll believe you. The first tourney I could find that had Hellsing, paper, or MB above Yoyo is stock of champions and also UM Biweekly 12, but that's really it. UM biweekly 11 and goatcat show a similair story to the results I've posted.  Edit: I missed um biweekly 12, so add that as well as stock of champions as evidence in your favor, but I still believe that yoy's performance is worthy of at least 8 on the PR."

SSBM,3dqlha,Hooots,10,Sat Jul 18 15:32:58 2015 UTC,"That's how evo does things. It's not how most other tournaments run things but they do it so they can just get 8 players to rotate on one or two tvs instead of going to find their opponent, even if it means everyone gets double eliminated if they can't overcome a bad MU.  Big House hype!"
SSBM,3dqlha,Chrozon,7,Sat Jul 18 15:51:36 2015 UTC,EVO is dumb and doesn't switch the bracket around in losers bracket. You can play the same person again in losers finals of the bracket pool.
SSBM,3dqlha,Hooots,9,Sat Jul 18 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"It's not EVO that is dumb, it's the whole ""bracket pool"" system. If it was just one huge DE bracket, then you would never meet the same person, but since it's split up into a bunch of small tournaments, then suddenly everyone in their bracket can meet each other multiple times early in the tournament."
SSBM,3dqlha,Chrozon,5,Sat Jul 18 15:50:36 2015 UTC,Big house used bracket pools for round 2 and I don't remember this being an issue. They must have done something different.
SSBM,3dqlha,nikovan_smash,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know what they did, but the evo seeding is basically the same as challonge. If you lose in the upper part of the winners bracket, you will be placed in the lower part of the losers bracket. What happens is that someone plays in winners, then they meet again in the loser's finals of that bracket pool. I'm 100% certain the second time two players met it has been in the loser's finals of one of the bracket pools."
SSBM,3dqlha,A_Big_Teletubby,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"They should do what is done in tennis... In juniors they have the main draw and the consolation , if you lose first round or lose second if you had a bye second you go into the consolation or ""losers"" and theres no chance of getting back into the main draw.  At the pro level there is no consolation. Also pro level for a grand slam is top 128 In the world. This would make things cleaner and simpler for smash.  But tbh I like the fact that in melee if you lose you have the chance to make it back to grand finals."
SSBM,3dqlha,nikovan_smash,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"Then again, a tennis set lasts a bit longer than a melee set. It's a bit harder to ""choke"" in tennis. Double elimination also offers better knowledge of seeding at the lower levels. In tennis, it's all single elimination, and only a small number of entrants are seeded. The rest are unseeded, and it's random whether an unseeded player meets the best seeded player or another unseeded player in the first round. It's a bit frustrating losing to the grand champion in the first round because of random seeding when you have the skill to get top 16, but you're just short of being seeded. With double elimination you will always meet someone at your skill level in losers, which gives you more regular chances to do upsets (or get upset)."
SSBM,3dqlha,DAEHateRatheism,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"Great point , I agree that since sets are shorter and less games are played its easier to not perform to well and lose and not have a chance back in.

SSBM,3dqlha,grandpaseth18,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:38 2015 UTC,To not be seeded in melee you basically have to be completely unknown. In group stages they usually always seed at least the amount of players that advance per group.

SSBM,3dqlha,ItsTheOtherBen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yo that's hype as fuck. Was druggedfox just super on point, or was lucky sloppy?"
SSBM,3dqlha,Pareto_effecient,2,Sat Jul 18 18:01:53 2015 UTC,I talked to druggedfox  and he said he thought he played mediocre but his tech chasing was ok. Lucky also tweeted that he played mediocre though so make of it what you will.

Mangos definitely gonna poop on Plup today,  hes not gonna let a sheik ruin 3vo.  Also does anyone have any info on like 64 to 32 ? Hopefully someone has a homemade bracket?"

SSBM,3dqlha,TheLastOmishi,10,Sat Jul 18 17:40:29 2015 UTC,"Assuming I'm interpreting bracket correctly, sorry if I'm not, but let's get some speculation rolling shall we:  The loser of Armada / Silent Wolf plays the winner of Chu Dat / Laudandus The loser of Javi / PewPewU plays the winner of Darkrain / Westballz The loser of Leffen / DruggedFox plays the winner of S2J v. Zanguzen The loser of Hungrybox / MacD plays the winner of Duck v.

SSBM,3dqlha,Habefiet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"Armada beats Silent Wolf, Chu Dat beats Laudandus, Armada moves on.  PPU beats Javi, Westballz beats Darkrain, PPU moves on. (sadballz).  Leffen beats DruggedFox, S2J beats Zanguzen, Leffen moves on.  HBox beats MacD, Eddy Mexico beats Duck, Hbox moves on.  Mangoat beats Ice, Fly beats reno, Mango moves on.  Plup beats Ken, Shroomed beats Sanitago, Shroomed moves on.  PPMD beats SFAT, Lucky beats DJ Nintendo, PPMD moves on.  Axe beats Hugs, aMSa beats Hax, Axe moves on."
SSBM,3dqlha,Dreamer1432,5,Sat Jul 18 17:38:45 2015 UTC,"I take SW against either chu or ladandus. Much more interested in PPU potentially playing Armada.  Ken possibly playing sheik back to back is rough.  Lucky and SFAT would be hype.  Would like to see Hax and Axe duke it out on that good demigod battle status, despite Hax's troubles lately. I have faith in my boy."
SSBM,3dqlha,FoxeRsmash,4,Sat Jul 18 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"Yo S2J could go deep in this. He has zanguzen who iirc is a solid Falco, but hes beaten him solidly before at nebs. Then druggedfox who is a sheik/fox that S2J will very likely beat, then Duck or Macdizzle who hes both beaten. MacD is the strong threat in the last 3 sets hes up 2-1."
SSBM,3dqlha,agrarwirt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:13 2015 UTC,How did you come up with this?
SSBM,3dqlha,jinzo2222,5,Sat Jul 18 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"Juggleguy tweeted all of these projections, but you just have to go through the evo bracket and match things up. Then again, relevant username."
SSBM,3dqlha,Forrest_Salamida,2,Sat Jul 18 16:28:17 2015 UTC,By combining the Liquipedia bracket  http://wiki.teamliquid.net/smash/EVO_2015/Singles_Bracket  With info from here on what seeds go where:  http://evo2015.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/ssbm_k101.html  It all looks accurate to me
SSBM,3dqlha,HoneyD,7,Sat Jul 18 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"Mango, PPMD, Armada and Leffen in top 4 winners would be awesome although anything can happen with Plup, Axe and Hbox!"

SSBM,3dqlha,Smittyyy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:25:18 2015 UTC,Fly and reportedly kept it close with sw?
SSBM,3dqlha,Habefiet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"Based on the stock count it was close, but sw looked in control the whole time."
SSBM,3dqlha,zuko2014,2,Sat Jul 18 20:08:48 2015 UTC,Eh..not that close. I think it was a 2 stock and then maybe last stock second game.
SSBM,3dqlha,NurokToukai,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"Both games were last stock. Azen kept it pretty close, but dropped a few punishes."

SSBM,3dqlha,opbn8,15,Sat Jul 18 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"leffen is seeded 4th, hbox is 5th. In order to make top 8 winners they face each other because only 4/5 top players can and they're the bottom of the 5."
SSBM,3dqlha,rd1027,15,Sat Jul 18 15:01:23 2015 UTC,Why does Leffen play Hbox second round?   Was bound to happen with 5 out of the 6 top players in attendance unfortunately.

SSBM,3dqlha,neros_neurosis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:32:47 2015 UTC,Jeez. I hope he cleans up his act and can perform better for the rest of the tournament
SSBM,3dqlha,rd1027,16,Sat Jul 18 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that he wasn't playing that bad, though, ken just looked like he forgot it wasn't 2006. That crispness has not been seen in many a year."
SSBM,3dqlha,_________Q_________,2,Sat Jul 18 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Do you have eyes? He played terribly. Not johning for Westballz but he played worse than I have seen him play in a long time, and alot of it was unforced."
SSBM,3dqlha,iode,3,Sat Jul 18 19:46:06 2015 UTC,I actually think Ken is more technical and crisp now than he ever was back then.

SSBM,3dqlha,ItsTheOtherBen,3,Sat Jul 18 17:03:54 2015 UTC,Did he lose in the Marth vs. Luigi matchup?
SSBM,3dqlha,Pareto_effecient,-7,Sat Jul 18 15:33:38 2015 UTC,Luigi gives marth a rough time if played correctly.
SSBM,3dqlha,trapsloth,11,Sat Jul 18 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"Marth gives Luigi a rough time by just using dtilt and fsmash. Marth is probably Luigi's worst match up, him or fox. Eddy is just fucking good."
SSBM,3dqlha,Theforward,3,Sat Jul 18 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, Abate agrees with this (and most Luigi mains from what I remember from guides, etc.) Also side note, the Moon was annoying while commentating about Luigi at a recent Xanadu (intimating he could never lose to a Luigi) so I'm glad he got his just desserts."
SSBM,3dqlha,Pareto_effecient,2,Sat Jul 18 17:03:41 2015 UTC,Marth is definitely not Luigi's worst MU.  Sheik at least is definitely worse.
SSBM,3dqlha,trapsloth,5,Sat Jul 18 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"No Marth definitely is not Luigis worst matchup. Hard for sure, but not worst"
SSBM,3dqlha,chis5050,4,Sat Jul 18 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"Peach/Fox/Marth, I think they're all equally as bad for Luigi. Some people are just better/worse at certain match ups."
SSBM,3dqlha,rd1027,5,Sat Jul 18 15:54:02 2015 UTC,Idk falco lasers really shut luigi down almost entirely   You need to be rly good at powershields
SSBM,3dqlha,Sidisphere,5,Sat Jul 18 16:19:35 2015 UTC,Id definitely put Fox and Peach clearly above Marth in this Mu.
SSBM,3dqlha,televisionceo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"Why exactly is fox bad for luigi? I understand fox is the better character, but fox can't connect anything off a shine, he can't up throw up air, and pretty much all of luigi's combo options are vertical moves, which are powerful against fast fallers like fox."
SSBM,3dqlha,rd1027,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"Fox's aerials kinda wreck Luigi. You're definitely right about Luigi's combo options being really good against Fox, but if Fox plays the matchup right and spaces nairs/bairs and avoids grabs, there's not much Luigi can do. Plus, Luigi has a very slow fall speed, and therefore dies to upsmash earlier than one would think."
SSBM,3dr5uc,Winnie_The_Bago,5,Sat Jul 18 17:41:52 2015 UTC,Wouldn't an IRC chat be much better?  Pros:   Less RAM than skype IRC can easily handle lots of people People can leave and join easily You can PM people without having to freind them No invite required   Cons:   Unless you have an IRC client(They are free) the webchat can sometimes randomly stop working.
SSBM,3dr5uc,Probable_Foreigner,2,Sun Jul 19 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad idea, but from my limited experience with IRC it can die pretty easily, and you can turn skype notifications on on your phone, so you don't miss any conversations."
