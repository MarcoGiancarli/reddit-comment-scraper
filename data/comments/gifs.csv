If you took a normal doe and treated her with testosterone, she would grow antlers. Hunters typically encounter two types of antlered “does”; those with hard antlers and those in velvet. Does with velvet covered antlers usually have normal female reproductive tracts and can bear fawns. Does with hardened antlers are almost always male pseudohermophrodites. These animals have female external genitalia, but have male organs (testicles) internally.  Comment ""UNSUBSCRIBE"" to stop receiving Antler FactsTM"

Because the testosterone plays such an important part of the antler cycle, castration in deer can have a profound effect on antlers. If a male fawn is castrated early, he will never grow pedicels or antlers.

gifs,3e27nx,whataguy,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on that last sentence? Never heard of this, and honestly, what's the difference between a walk in the woods and shed hunting besides success?"
gifs,3e27nx,juice369,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"The difference would be if a game warden caught you with shed antlers during the blackout window.  The reason is that when the snow is high and temperatures are cold, deer and elk don't have easy access to food so they have to conserve as much energy as possible.  They don't allow shed gathering during this time because it would impact the animals abilities to conserve energy.  The reason it doesn't overlap too much with simply hiking is that sheds are usually in more remote and difficult to access areas.  Most deer and elk who are trying to conserve energy don't hang out on popular hiking trails.  In my state (Utah) you can't gather sheds during a few weeks in winter.  But I  imagine if someone had no clue and picked one up, and was stopped by a game warden, the game warden would just let them know the rules and let them go no problem.  But shed gathering is a big business for some, because of the resale value of big antlers.  Some douchebags chase elk or deer on ATVs waiting for the shed to drop.  This can kill them in harsh winters.  I think game wardens can typically tell the difference between someone who gathers sheds for a living and someone who just had no idea."
gifs,3e27nx,whataguy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"FWIW, shed-hunting is a huge pasttime in Utah (compared to other states, at least). Here in NY, I don't think there's a law like that."

I wonder if it's a bit like having a cast cut off when a broken arm has healed.  The arm feels really light and quick once you're no longer carrying a big hunk of plaster around on it.  It's liberating.  Or maybe it's more like having a full beard and having to go clean-shaven for a few weeks for some reason (maybe a job interview):  Weird, a bit annoying, and hard not to notice at first until you gradually get used to it.  tl;dr: deer thoughts."

gifs,3e27nx,giveitago,5,Tue Jul 21 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"When the velvet falls off, that is called molting.  When the antlers are dropped they are then referred to as shed antlers.  You can often find them if hiking in the right area although during some times of the year it is illegal to go out looking for shed antlers.

gifs,3dz9v4,dittbub,32,Mon Jul 20 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"Eh it's always a dog's instinct to jump into the water when people are diving in or under the surface.   There was a video the other day of this group of people who had been white water rafting with their dogs when they flipped. One girl was stranded on a rock with her dog. It was a shitty rescue, and she was inexperienced, but long story short, the girl handed off her dog to the rescuer before maintaining her balance and she fell into the rapid. The guy secured the dog before turning back to help her. Luckily she was able to hold onto the raft while drowning and they were able to yank her out.   People in the comments were saying that if someone was drowning to make sure you secure the dog before rescuing the person because the dog's natural instinct is to jump in. This can complicate the rescue obviously.   I don't think this dog was waiting his turn to jump. He's looking antsy from the start because other people are in the water. He more than likely was trying to save someone in that clip (even though nobody was drowning). His natural instinct can't help it.  Edit: Said video. There are a million Youtube videos of dogs jumping in to save non drowning humans though. Just their instincts."

gifs,3e1eg1,fyeah11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:33 2015 UTC,What you just said is the reason I think most people still eat animals.

gifs,3e1eg1,Hivmonster,4,Tue Jul 21 05:59:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't bother me.  I feel sympathy for the animals I kill and eat, but at the same time I accept it.  I don't want to see an animal suffer, I take steps to end a kill's suffering when I hunt, I don't want to make it any worse than it needs to be.  But at the same time, I understand my place and its place and how things got to where we are.  Its like rabbits.  Rabbits are cute, they are soft, people have them as pets.  We do not.  Rabbits are food, they are good food, you don't name the food.  (Braised Rabbit in a garlic aoli sauce over linguine noodles, very delicious.)  Even slaughter house meat doesn't bother me.  I know what goes into making hotdogs, hot dogs are delicious, thank god modern science has found a way to use all those left over bits!  Less waste and great taste!"

gifs,3e1eg1,Mown,0,Tue Jul 21 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with you on that one.  Don't get me wrong, I've hunted, dressed a kill in the field, and even dissected human cadavers.  Would be very interested to see if the rate of waste for meat would drastically decrease if there was more education about the subject (an extreme example- like the pictures of black lungs on cigarette cartons).  Just especially in this case of fishing, I feel it's especially unique in that it occurs almost 100% out of sight, underwater.  Meat is a far reality from the nice packaged 'sterile' almost appearance of a steak in a grocery store.  'Funny' (depending upon your definition of funny) story about meat from when I was growing up.  My mother for the longest time told us kids she was allergic to chicken and fish.  We believed her until we were older and she mentioned she just didn't like them, but still wanted us to try them (I actually appreciate her tact in that regard).  She would though eat beef, pork, etc. pretty regularly.  Well one day we were sitting down at dinner after grilling some steaks and I commented on how cool it is that the meat that we eat from an animal is it's actual muscle (think I learned that in ether a middle school biology class or maybe on like national geographic).  My mom instantly dropped her fork, completely grossed out and to this day refuses to eat meat.  Apparently she thought that meat was just some kind of floating around substance within the animal (yeah, I have no idea how she thought that).  She's actually a very intelligent woman, it's just funny the extent that humans will go to in order to separate themselves from the reality of things."
gifs,3e1eg1,1Os,0,Tue Jul 21 06:06:53 2015 UTC,"Mercy for animals did it for me. They made huffpo, and I felt that I should have to watch all the videos. I stopped eating all meat instantly. I got somewhat sick during the transition, and my doctor urged me to eat some type of meat. I still eat fish or shrimp a couple times a week, but I'm working on ditching that as well. I can't tell you how excited I was when Jeff Bezos made lab grown beef. I know it's not a viable option yet, or if it ever will be, but I was disappointed when I watched the taste tests.   The foodies who tested it were pretty critical. They said it wasn't bad, but I expected excitement from the fact that nothing died for them to eat that burger.   I'd rather people be forced to hunt for their food, than for the current slaughterhouse system to keep existing. I feel bad for not just the animals, but for the people who are completely desensitized by taking life for a living. It's fucked up shit."
gifs,3e1eg1,Hivmonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:43 2015 UTC,"Lab grown meat is such an interesting pursuit.  It absolutely blows my mind to think how close (maybe not tomorrow or next week, but just in general) we are to being able to do such.  There was a recent article posted somewhere that also showed the decrease in price for a piece of lab grown meat- it was literally orders of magnitudes cheaper than years previously.  Pretty cool stuff.    Couple of questions, if you don't mind (I get the impression you wouldn't mind sharing your thoughts, but sorry if I'm wrong! Would you eat lab grown meat (1- just once off and / or 2- regularly) if / when it were to become a viable industry?  The idea of forcing people to hunt for their own meat is also an interesting one.  Hypothetically, if that were the only option and a majority of our day had to revolve around doing so, do you think that would have had a significant impact upon how technology / civilization has progressed?    Anyway, thanks for sharing your perspective.  Although I personally love meat and couldn't imagine living without it, I find it really interesting hearing another's perspective about the topic (many of which I may not have considered before)."
gifs,3e1eg1,The_Seed_In_Tweed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:13 2015 UTC,"I would probably eat lab grown meat somewhat regularly. I miss meat, but I can live without it.   I'm not completely serious about making everyone hunt. Honestly though, I don't think it's something you'd have to devote most of your day to doing. A deer will feed a family of four, for a fair amount of time. Chickens, can be picked up and have their necks broken.   If we're being hypothetical though, I don't think it would hinder our advancement as a society. You look at any indigenous tribes from anywhere who still hunt; none of them are overweight, what is hunted is respected, and what is killed is not wasted. Any hunters that I know are like this. All the hunters I know, never want to take two shots to put an animal down. Whether it's pride in their marksmanship or respect, they're trying to end the engagement as soon as possible.  Take a look at the Temple Grandin method of slaughter. It's the best we have for slaughtering beef, and it's scary as fuck. I try to think of how I'd want to go out if I was a food source. I'd want to think I was free, and a large caliber bullet to the head (when I don't expect it) would be the way I'd want to go."
gifs,3e1eg1,Hivmonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:53 2015 UTC,"The idea of forcing people to hunt for their own meat is also an interesting one. Hypothetically, if that were the only option and a majority of our day had to revolve around doing so, do you think that would have had a significant impact upon how technology / civilization has progressed?   I know you're not asking me, but I think this is quite an interesting question.   Yes, I think this would significantly hinder technological progress, or any progress for that matter. Having to spend a large part of your day hunting—a pretty exhausting task—there is very little room for other activities as you depend on it for sustenance. Therefore, any specialised jobs are hard or impossible to perform because there simply is not enough time to do so. In addition, the amount of energy spent hunting and the amount of energy gained from the meat is probably about the same, so there is very little energy left.  This is in line with existing theories of how hunter-gatherers lived. They had to spend a relatively large amount of time hunting and, more importantly, gathering food to survive, in addition to trekking across the land to find food. With the rise of agricultural societies, and thus the possibility for fewer people to produce large quantities of food, specialisation was made possible, as one person could provide for many others. This basically initiated a vicious cycle of innovation; because people had time and a promise of sustenance, more advance farming equipment could be made, in addition to better clothes, houses, etcetera. More advanced farming equipment meant more food for more people, and thus larger cities, and thus more diverse needs, and thus more specific—specialised—jobs.  TL;DR: Human society as it is today developed because we stopped hunting for our individual food."

Yeah, this is the information that I come across each time I do some research on the study (I actually used to do nociceptor research in human subjects for a while, but that's another story).  Differentiating between the ""ouch whatever in my mouth is sharp and I have to get out of here"" and ""oh crap something is yanking me, let's move"".  I guess something akin to a central pattern generator that as soon as it's triggered, regardless of conscious modulation, it's going to act to completion.
