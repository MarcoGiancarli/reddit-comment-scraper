science,3e26al,AmerChemSocietyAMA,12,Tue Jul 21 11:26:12 2015 UTC,"Hi Amy and Brian, thanks for doing this AMA.  My 2 questions are mostly directed at Amy, and come come from a place of having tried start 2 non-successful businesses in the past.  1) It seems like I reach my ""non-success threshold"" quickly and the cost of investing more effort into the project doesn't seem worth the time it would take.  Can you give any advice specifically to address this issue?  2) I'm working with a partner on my latest idea and we've identified what we think is a gap.  However, the product we want to produce would use a pre-existing, (possibly) patented, commercially-available product.  How do we go about approaching this product's owner to discuss including it in our own?  Thanks for your time."
science,3e26al,HearthBrewer,4,Tue Jul 21 11:54:50 2015 UTC,"This is Amy.  To start, congratulations on starting new endeavors!  It takes courage and isn't easy. But it is worth it!   To your questions:  1) It is important to develop a threshold for when to ""stop.""  Different creators have different thresholds and my research shows that it is important to set a ""failure ratio.""  By that, I mean that it is important to decide ahead of time what ratio you will tolerate to keep experimenting.  Some entrepreneurs set the ratio to be 1 in 3 things that won't work out - or 1 in 4 experiments - or 1 in 10 attempts to get the business launched.  If you have already hit your ""non-success threshold"" then it is important to make that decision and quickly change direction.  It is difficult to give concrete advice here without knowing more about your specific startup and numbers.   My best advice is to test your assumptions with at least 3-4 people and discuss your own personal ""failure ratio"" before making a concrete decision to stop or continue aggressively.   2) Regarding seeing a ""gap"" and approaching the owner of a patent, it is important to   approach patent discussions fully armed with legal advice.  My best suggestion is to reach out to a patent attorney before you contact the product's owner.  Information is power and you want to be best informed."
science,3e26al,balamory,9,Tue Jul 21 17:33:09 2015 UTC,What are some of the best things you can do if you have nothing to begin with?
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 12:32:54 2015 UTC,"This is Brian.  Two things: 1. Think about stuff--anything and everything.  Look at stuff others are doing, and what is being left undone.  The opportunities are in what is being left undone. 2. Join another startup and find out what it is all about.  You can start by volunteering for a company that you have some expertise you can contribute to, but the ultimate would be to get a job for a startup.  This is the only way to really know--to immerse yourself."
science,3e26al,AppFritz,8,Tue Jul 21 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"What triggered you to take that first leap of faith over the nagging self-doubts you might have had about one of your ideas? Many understand that failure can lead to lessons on how to do things better, but how did you initially jump over that first hurdle?  Did support have to come from somewhere, or did it just come about with discipline, and thoughts of ""the worst I can do is not succeed?"""
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 12:32:28 2015 UTC,"For me it was a combination of frustration with my previous job and how slow, tedious and uninnovative the whole environment was. That combined with an opening to do something different that could not be done on another platform.  I was one of those folks who jumped, and built the airplane on the way down.  I did jump with one partner lined up, but nothing more than that and so rallied technology partners, investors and business partners after starting the company.  There is a poem called ""You Mustn't Quit"" that has been hanging on my various office walls for 20 years now."
science,3e26al,pnewell,6,Tue Jul 21 17:18:04 2015 UTC,Reading the list of companies leads me to wonder: how important is having a clever or intentionality misspelled brand name?
science,3e26al,nallen,5,Tue Jul 21 12:23:07 2015 UTC,"One of the inhibitors I feel when thinking of starting a business of my own is my age (I'm 40), I feel like the ramp up of a business would take too long to pay off relative to my rather good paying job.  How long has it taken you to get your businesses self-sufficient?  (I believe they call this ""crossing the valley of death."")"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 13:59:07 2015 UTC,"Well--that is why they pay you well--to keep you on the current side of this decision.  I have started advanced materials businesses, which take an extraordinarily long time to get off the ground (think 5 years before cash flow positive).  Software businesses can go much faster, while some (medical, aerospace) can be even slower.  However, I have been earning a competitive salary for most of the time that I have been an entrepreneur because investors, like your current boss, want to keep you on the current side of the ""do I leave to do something else"" question.  The trick for the entrepreneur is that you have to raise the money to pay yourself until you can be paid through revenue."
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:44 2015 UTC,Just FYI--I have a friend who is 70 years old and started his own company (software for fire stations to get insurance filed on an ipad) and he is two years in with measurable revenue and growing quickly.  There is no right age.
science,3e26al,nallen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:17 2015 UTC,Good to hear!
science,3e26al,AppFritz,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"1.) Also, can you recommend any good literary material in any of your passions that may have initially set off that ""spark?"" Your own works notwithstanding. :)  2.) What really brings about that flare and love of what you all do?"
science,3e26al,BlackManonFIRE,3,Tue Jul 21 12:40:28 2015 UTC,"This is Amy.  On your first question 1) I would recommend reading Zero to One by Peter Thiel.  It is a solid entrepreneurship book written by one of the great Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.  There is also solid research around curiosity by George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon that I would recommend!     On your second question 2) I would say that love of people and ideas is what fuels my research.  Curiosity is also a big part of it for me - and for the 200 entrepreneurs I interviewed for my book.  When you love your work, it is easier to stay motivated and to take the setbacks that inevitably arise along the path to success.  Good luck!"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing this AMA.  In the southeastern US, textiles used to be a major industry. However most of the industry has gone overseas (primarily China).  Do you see this industry rebounding in the US whether through conventional means (enhanced fibers for clothing, sporting gear, etc), other routes, or through battery technology?  Is there a route for smaller businesses to develop in this region to partner with this industry (whether chemical, engineering firms, etc.)?"
science,3e26al,TeignmouthElectron,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:35 2015 UTC,"The traditional textile industry in the US will not rebound.  Unfortunately, the US textile industry did not respond to the foreign manufacturing pressures in the same way that the electronics industry did--by moving manufacturing and keeping R&D and design in the US.  The opportunities for fiber-based technology in the US will be technology based--either doing something that no one else is doing (Under Armor, others) or by applying fibers in a market where they are not currently being used (like we are in battery separators).  The best way for a company to develop is to develop a technology, and then find a partner to help manufacture.  Dreamweaver has done this with Glatfelter, a large paper company that will be making our materials.  With my last startup, Innegrity, we did not partner and built two manufacturing sites on two continents and then failed during the downturn when customers started dropping like flies.  Hope this helps!"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"This is Amy.  To the question of textiles, there are great examples in The Creator's Code of retailers who are making products in the United States.  Under Armour founder Kevin Plank, for example, wants to bring all UA jobs back into Baltimore where his company is based.  Spanx founder Sara Blakely launched her company in the southeast by going door-to-door to get a manufacturer to make her product.     I do see this industry growing in the US through new fabrics as well as wearable technologies.    In terms of smaller businesses partnering with larger companies, this is one of the best ways to scale a startup.  Any time an entrepreneur can find a larger partner who will be a collaborative customer, the odds of success improve dramatically!"
science,3e26al,PerkyTank,4,Tue Jul 21 17:43:26 2015 UTC,What's the longest time either of you have went from starting off on an entrepreneurial journey (quitting a job or similar) to getting that first bit of revenue with a glimpse of success?
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"I usually try to get some revenue quickly, even if it is just customers buying samples, so for me it's been a max of two years.  The trick in advanced materials/chemistry is the customer development time--the ""valley of death"" seems to last a long time, and cash flow positive threshold can be elusive.  For this, it is a matter of discipline to keep the company lean and keep spending low while growing the revenue.  For the early years, more than 100% growth is difficult but necessary to achieve positive cash flow."
science,3e26al,cityhoneybee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"This is Amy.  I have launched a couple of new ventures and it often takes longer than you expect to secure revenue. It is obviously best to be revenue positive from day one!!  Some ventures do start that way.  Through my research I can say that the vast majority of successful entrepreneurs test their new businesses as ""side-projects"" while holding down a full time job.  They experiment in low risk ways before quitting a job or investing significant time or capital.  Good luck!"
science,3e26al,Sukrim,4,Tue Jul 21 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for conducting this AMA! My question is this: how does a young chemistry-based start-up establish their initial proof of concept for investors? For programming and engineering start-up teams, the initial POC may be obtained given enough time and the proper tools, but chemistry typically requires a lab space that abides by environmental regulations. Are university and industrial partnerships essential to chemistry start-ups for this reason? If so, how does a team typically make this partnership happen?"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"Typical resources can include university labs, testing labs, partners in the industry.  I've found that equipment manufacturers can be particularly cooperative--they generally have equipment laying around unused that can be rented for a reasonable fee.  At Dreamweaver, you would be shocked at how little capability we have for ourselves.  We partnered early with the Herty Foundation (www.herty.com) and have done almost all of the development work at their labs.  They are fee for service and didn't ask for any part of the IP, so it's been a great partnership for almost five years now. How to make it happen?--sometimes a matter of just talking with lots and lots of people until someone buys into your vision.  For us it came relatively quickly, but that may not be the norm depending on the industry.   In true chemistry, I would look for a contract manufacturer."

science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think of the patent system? Some see it as the holy grail to innovation that is the only thing that saves our society from stopping to be innovative/creative at all, others would rather see them eliminated alltogether yesterday.  Especially: Should patents come with a working sample implementation attached (e.g. you patent a machine: add CAD files to build a prototype that does what the patent states, you patent an algorithm: add program code that implements this algorithm, you patent a chemical substance: provide a method to create this substance and verify that it has been created properly etc.)? Do patents really measure innovation or do they only measure how much money one is willing to hand to patent lawyers? Should start-ups focus on secure their ""intellectual property"" early on and spend lots of time, effort and money on this or rather not care about copycats and just continue innovating and going forward?"
science,3e26al,SOMBREROOO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"Wow--so, first, this is not legal advice, which you should get from a lawyer.  That said, in some industries holding a patent is a necessary step to getting outside funding--think advanced materials, innovative devices, others.  In others, first to market and penetration matters most.  The trick is to make sure your invention is truly innovative, creates real value, and is desired, and then patent protection is just one more tool in the toolbox to carve out your competitive niche.  It should be used in conjunction with trade secrets, branding, product design and relationship building to protect your position.  Michael Porter's five forces are a good mechanism to help think about it--a patent is just one of many barriers to entry you can put up in front of competitors."
science,3e26al,Nevro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer! :)  I was more interested in your personal view on patents though (especially since you mentioned you own hundreds of them, which after all must have cost a small fortune in application fees alone)."
science,3e26al,Hurricanewarningdc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"So a little more personal part--I have a lot of patents because lawyers and the patent departments of various countries have been paid a lot.  But the truly valuable ones for me are about 10-20%, and I think I hit higher than most.  I have a blog in which I detail some of the successes as well as duds--innovationintegrity.blogspot.com."

It seems like right now there is a serious upswing in the industry due to the science behind it being held back by regulations and ideology, which is quickly changing.   Are there any other fields that you see with such a strong potential for growth?"
science,3e26al,joshuateas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:51 2015 UTC,"This is Amy.  I'm excited about companies such as Theranos, a lab testing company based in Palo Alto, that will use data analytics to fundamentally reshape the healthcare industry. The concept is that if as patients we get lab tests more frequently that we will be able to see the story of disease develop over time with the hope of detecting and eventually preventing it.  I see significant future growth in the intersection of data-science and medical applications.  Companies such as 23andMe have the potential to reshape healthcare but are not stuck in regulatory battles.  As you note, this is changing.  Keep your eyes on biomedical, bioengineering (such as the inventions coming out of Bob Langer's lab at MIT) and data analytics as related to healthcare!   I'm going to!!"
science,3e26al,AppFritz,3,Tue Jul 21 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"Hi Amy, glad to see this AMA from you.  The biotech industry, particularly in this post genomic era, is known to consist of many startup successes and arguably many failures.  When it comes to starting with a basic idea from research and bringing it to a business model, what are some key elements of business that researchers are often initially unaware of when considering founding a startup?"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question.  There is huge potential for scientists and business leaders to work together in more seamless ways.  Bob Langer, pioneer of drug delivery systems and human tissue engineering and founder of the Langer Lab at MIT, is a wonderful example of success at this intersection.  Bob has cofounded 25 companies that have scaled to over $100 million in annual revenue.  He has also licensed technology to over 250 larger pharma companies.  Check out his model as an example.   Specific to your question, one of the things underestimated by scientists (and new entrepreneurs) is the significance of funding. Startups need more funding often than they anticipate and one of the main factors related to startup failure is running out of funding.  Technical transfer and patent law is another area that needs close consideration.  There is huge potential in bringing research into the marketplace!  Scientists and researchers need to first and foremost find good business partners."
science,3e26al,nattywalls,3,Tue Jul 21 18:02:16 2015 UTC,"For females (entrepreneurs or otherwise), were any of the skills more significant than the others? More important to have or harder to obtain? Any other tips that were gender-specific? (Great concept and book, btw.)"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the question.  My research shows that male and female entrepreneurs who  start and scale companies to over $100 million in annual revenue share the same skills.  There are no gender differences that I have studied specifically.  That said, women do not show up in equal number in the ""high scale entrepreneurship"" category.  There is research that shows one reason for that is less access to funding.  (Women are not as connected in venture capital and angel networks and therefore do not have equal access to capital).  Research also shows that women don't have access to the same networks of advisors.  I would direct you to a new study out of Babson on women entrepreneurs as well as a study conducted by The Kauffman Foundation for more specifics.  Good luck!!!   And we need more female high-scale entrepreneurs.  Go for it!"
science,3e26al,oncheosis,3,Tue Jul 21 18:05:53 2015 UTC,"One more for Amy: What about the leap of faith to go from single person with a concept/service/product to employee #2 and beyond? Someone has an idea, high standards, desired direction and at some point, if they're to grow, they need let go and trust others with that vision. I see in many of my small-business-owning colleagues a difficulty in bridging that gap, handing off their baby to others who may not have the same drive. Or so they fear. They have to do it, but I wonder what you saw with entrepreneurs who got over that hump to scale upwards. (And Brian, please feel free to reply, as well!)  P.S., not a new poster, but for the life of me, I can't get password to work today"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:55 2015 UTC,"The leap of faith question to add employee #2, #3, and beyond is a good one.  For founders who want to make meaningful change in the world, it is easy to bring in other people.  No one person can create and scale an endeavor without enlisting other - many other - people to help carry and shape that vision.   In my book there is a chapter called ""Network Minds"" about how to harness cognitive diversity and bring together other minds to make businesses stronger.  It is by working together that we will solve problems that have not been solved in the past.  Moving past the solo operator to build a concept that will reach many others requires searching for allies.  It is a mindset as well as a skill set that is crucial when building meaningful partnerships."
science,3e26al,Juhyo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"Hello Amy & Brian! Do you consider Big Data to be a Natural Resource?  My startup empowers & educates patients to exercise their health & privacy rights to get money out of politics in the USA.    For example: Your doctor uses a file management business that donates millions to a political agenda.  You revoke your medical consent from the file management business.  The doctor is not allowed to refuse services based on your choice, and has to adapt and find another file management solution that fits your terms of consent.  How do we avoid insurance companies and healthcare providers losing their shit when they realize the patient has the right to do this?"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:41 2015 UTC,"One for Brian: Starting off, did you use your own background and knowledge to set something off to lead to success, or was it a group effort? How often do you find yourself in a position where you are active using your science background when it comes to processes or designs?  Do you now just use it to understand what others are helping to produce in a more managerial, oversight capacity or are you still active contributing to some things directly or in a more hands-on sort of way?"
science,3e26al,jdmorrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:17 2015 UTC,"I spent ten years in industry before starting my first company, where I learned so much about business in general.  My training is as a physicist, which is as much a mindset as it is a technical field.  As an entrepreneur in a tech field, the lines between business and technology are so blurred that I don't even know if I can draw a line.  I use both my technical background and my business acumen in every decision.  An example--we have some lead customers who are considering using our product.  But for a new player in a conservative industry populated by big competitors, we have to go the extra mile.  So we are planning with a few key customers to jointly develop the next generation of our product based on their specific needs.  Here my ability to understand their needs and also see what technical opportunities are available is necessary--but also the ability to understand the business needs and competitive pressures that a customer is facing are also necessary.  Its so blurry that there isn't an edge, which is what I love about entrepreneurship.  If I can solve a problem with a paper clip, we use a paper clip.  If it needs a tunneling electron microscope, then we'll use that."

What has your research suggested should be the next step for someone in a similar situation and with similar goals as me?"
science,3e26al,lolredditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"The best step would be to get a job working for a life sciences startup.  There are hundreds, they are VC funded, and hire lots of people even pre-revenue.  You can earn a decent salary, learn the skills of entrepreneurship, and begin thinking about whether you, or a group of your friends, may want to take the leap to start one yourself."
science,3e26al,Zzsky,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"Are there different types of advice that you might give to a non-billion dollar entrepreneur (someone building a $20 million dollar future company) vs the billion dollar examples listed?  For instance, an entrepreneur that builds a $20 million dollar company with the help of venture capital may not have anything except a salary to show for it when the venture cap guys cash out in ~5-7 years."
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"For me, the threshold for an equity invested company is that you can reasonable expect to get to $100 million, with an upside over $1 billion.  This for an advanced material.  Below that, you should bootstrap, which means selling services, testing, government SBIR grants, etc to get the company going.  While many great companies have been founded on debt, I would not recommend the company owing more than your mortgage, and I would not recommend personal guarantees.  $20 million dollar companies are the source of great wealth in this company but don't expect to get the interest of a VC--nor should you want it.

Is the additional credibility, exposure to ideas, and experience to  better understand what is feasible often worth the long time investment? Do most founders have advanced degrees at the start?  An unrelated question: who is the ideal first person to recruit when starting a company? In general, is it better to find another technical expert to refine the idea/prototype, or someone who can operate the drive the pitch and operate the business front?"

One has only a high school degree, and he barely got that!  What you need are natural curiosity, a brain that doesn't turn off, drive that startles other people and a stick-to-it-ness that will keep you going no matter how bad it gets.  We joke, there is only one reason a company fails--it runs out of money.  A company can almost run out of money any number of times, but it only runs out once.    For a first person to recruit--find someone who complements you.  If you are a tech person, find someone with business experience and people skills.  If you are the business/people person, then find a technical rock star.  In either case, look for the features above, and, last and maybe most important, the character that will keep your relationship 100% honest and real even during the down times.

science,3e26al,Meggiekins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"This is Amy.  I believe we are moving into a non-credentialed economy.  By this I mean that degrees and certifications matter less than problems that people can solve.  When building companies, the person with a PhD or post-doc is only as valuable as what she or he can bring to the table in terms of problem-solving.  Advanced training can certainly help prepare individuals to tackle thorny issues.  That said, most founders in my research set do not have PhDs.  There are many entrepreneurs who graduate from college but forgo an MBA degree because of the 2 year investment in business education.  The MBA - or non-MBA - debate in the entrepreneurship world is heating up.  There is also the argument out there that the best entrepreneurs dropout (Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etc).  Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, Solar City, and PayPal, for example, dropped out of a PhD program in physics at Stanford after only 2 days.  I do believe education is important.  In the entrepreneurship world, it is mostly about what problem you can solve."
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Hi and thank you for doing this AMA. I have two related questions mainly directed at Brian as a ""serial inventor"".  1) Would you recommend that a potential inventor always pursue a patent for a good and applicable idea or are some things better sent directly into the public domain as a public service? Conversely, should some inventions be kept as trade secrets?  2) Do you have a personal litmus test or rule of thumb that you use to decide if an idea is ""patentable""? Often it seems like good scientific ideas that lead to research and grants are too broad or fundamental for patents and ideas for specific advances to existing technologies either feel too trivial (e.g. a software patent on a ""pop-up window"") or lie in a patent gray zone (e.g. using a previously patented technology as part of a new process). Where is the ""sweet spot"" for good useful patents?  Thank you for your time!   I am a PhD student set to defend in ~ 4 weeks and very much appreciate your perspective as I hope to continue developing my sense for patentability and invention. (Also this is my first AMA post so /hi /r/science.)"
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:19 2015 UTC,"1) Patents:  If the product is new to the world, I always patent it.  People fall on different sides of this.  The question for me has always been, ""How different is it?""  If it is new to the world but just a slightly more polished billiards ball..then skip.  If it's a smart billiards ball that never misses, then patent.  2) Litmus Test:  I hold the idea or invention up to the test of ""obvious in hindsight.""  If it was never thought of before, but after explaining it people go, ""Duh--of course, that's obvious,"" then develop it, protect it, and build the company around it.  However, the problem of a patentable invention is still one that is 95% invention and 5% patents.  Great patents protecting something that isn't that different and isn't that necessary are worthless. Make sure you get the technology right--and that when you are alone in the room with just you and your Creator you can stand up to everyone in the room and know that it is different and better and commit yourself to making it work.  There is a funny scene in Silicon Valley (hbo series) where 20 software entrepreneurs are going to ""make the world a better place"" and then drift off into acronym land. But the reality is that you have to make the world a better place--it has to work.  Patenting is one small piece."
science,3e26al,I_want_hard_work,2,Tue Jul 21 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"Lets say I have a great idea that isn't software based.  Let's say this idea is somehow amazing and a near instabuy, and that it costs like $5-$10 each for everyone to have one, or even two, in their home.  How the heck do I get it to market without having manufacturers, distributors, and retailers bending me over backwards if I just sunk the majority of my income/leverage in to the development and manufacturing/packaging of this miracle widget.  I'm just trying to see how the small guys get something from their garage to nationwide really quickly when online sales aren't the primary outlet.

I'm a junior in college dual majoring in Biochem and Biology and have a great GPA but my school is small and doesn't offer the same opportunity as a bigger school would. Starting any sort of business seems hard by yourself!
science,3e26al,BrianMorin_ACS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"Find something that you are passionate about, and get involved.  Networking for networking's sake is generally fake and people can see right through it. But if you happen to be building a Habitat for Humanity house next to a guy who lives next door to a VC or angel who invests in your area, then that is real and works best.  It can be anything, but churches, charities, local professional clubs, education are all areas where you can network.  Amy has a great section in her book where she talks about ""Gift Small Goods,"" which is really all about building a network.  Find someone or a group of people that you can do something for, and do it expecting nothing in return.  The return will astound you."

He was judged to be around 45 when he died, matching the age at which Philip was killed, but he was also found to have suffered a severe wound to his knee three years before his death.  This is consistent with reports of Philip's life: ""As Philip was returning to Macedonia from the Scythian campaign against Ateas, the Thracian tribe of Triballoi met him and refused to allow him passage unless they received a share of the spoils,"" the researchers wrote. ""Hence, a dispute arose and afterward a battle, in which Philip received so severe a wound through his leg by a lance that his horse was killed by it.  Analysis showed the male in Tomb I had leg bones with a stiffened knee joint, signs of bone fusion and a hole through the knee indicating a piercing wound.

The cool thing with the mice is that you can use targeted genetic mutations to make the mice far more susceptible to certain types of cancers, and then look at the effect of stimuli on that rate of tumor development. That's what the researchers did here: they took a strain of mouse known to develop a certain (mammary, in this case) type of tumor, and had a control group and a group exposed to a disruption of day/night cycle. Then they compared the two. Whether or not the mice develop tumors faster/more often than humans isn't so important...at least, not to this study. That's the beauty of the mouse studies -- taking genetically-identical mice and subjecting them to different conditions. I know it might not ultimately apply to humans, but it's a start."

science,3dzdhc,brokeglass,51,Mon Jul 20 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"Fun fact about BRCA1: it is one of the few human genes to ever be patented. Myriad Genetics patented it I the early '90s, and over the course of the patent's lifetime made nearly half a billion dollars selling women genetic tests for the disease. Their patent hugely inflated the cost of these tests, and outrage over the practice ultimately led to the U.S. Supreme Court disallowing the practice of patenting human genes."
science,3dzdhc,SirT6,21,Tue Jul 21 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"You have your facts partially right. BRCA1 is definitely not one of the few human genes to be patented. There were many, but Myraid's patent enforcement strategy was what brought them to the attention of the ACLU. The timing was right after Prometheus for SCOTUS to hear the case and be justified in limiting the practice of patenting human genes. Some human gene patenting is still permitted under 101 (that is, still patentable subject matter) because it was still found permissible to patent cDNAs with only the expressed portions of the gene. However, it remains to be seen whether these types of patents will be frequently allowed under 102 (novelty) and 103 (obviousness) since the practice of removing introns to leave only exons in a cDNA is well-known in the art."
science,3dzdhc,ThinkingViolet,10,Tue Jul 21 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Good point; I could have phrased that better. At the high point, about 4,000 human genes were subject to patent protection. Very few of those were enforced, let alone monetized, however. It was certainly Myriad's business practices which drew the ire of the ACLU and other litigators.  I agree, although the Supreme Court struck down the practice of patenting 'naturally occurring gene products', it is still unclear what aspects of human genetics (if any) can be patented. A lot of this confusion is tied to how difficult it is even for biologists to agree on what a gene is, and what is novel about genetics research. Given that biologists struggle to agree on this issue, it is unsurprising a collection of justices struggle as well."

Is obsessive-compulsive disorder regarded as a lifelong condition, or with symptom treatment is it considered to 'go away'?  I was diagnosed with OCD by a clinical psychologist and had very severe handwash/bathing symptoms in my early teen years. I ended up personally conditioning out a lot of my compulsive mannerisms, though. I've been a bit confused as to whether or not I still 'have' the condition, as I don't know if I have any explicitly identifiable physical compulsions which meet DSM levels.  My second question is more of a neuropsychological one. Which areas of the brain are neuroatypical for individuals with OCD? Despite having an undergraduate psychology degree, I couldn't get a straight answer from any of my professors regarding this question."

However, most of the time, OCD waxes and wanes across someone's lifespan. Sometimes people can have very bad symptoms, and at other times symptoms can be milder. We've seen people who have gotten good treatment and then become well. They can live well for decades as long as they maintain their treatment strategies and/or proper medication.  In terms of the brain, what we know is that people with OCD have abnormal functioning of specific brain circuits. Whether the abnormalities causes OCD, or is a result of OCD is still being studied. The main circuits of interest are the ones that are involved in cognitive control, reward processing, habit formation, and fear.  We're currently doing studies on this now at our lab!! And hope to have answers for you soon."

science,3dxpai,22bebo,211,Mon Jul 20 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I've suffered from OCD for most of my life and have experienced many of the varieties of OCD. Basically, the types of OCD can be divided into 4 categories. Checking, Contamination, Hoarding, and Intrusive/ Taboo thoughts. I have personally only experienced Checking and Intrusive thoughts, so those are the ones that I will elaborate on.   Checking is undoubtefully one of the most widely known forms of OCD, primarly due to its visibility. An example of checking OCD I experienced when younger was repeatedly opening my backpack (4 to 5 times) to make sure I had my homework before leaving for school. These compulsions are not driven out of a sense to be a perfectionist, but instead out of an intense fear that something bad will happen. In my case, school was very important to me, and getting a lower grade due to a forgotten homework assignment terrified me, which is what the OCD latched on to.  Completing the compulsions provides relief to the sufferer that their fear will not come true, but also strengthens the OCD, causing the instrusive thoughts to occur more frequently.   The other type of OCD I have suffered from is called intrusive/taboo thoughts. From my personal experience, I have found that this category is by far the most dehabilitating type of OCD, as it specifially targets the morals and values you hold most dear. I will not go into detail regarding some of the thoughts I have personally had, but I can give you some examples. A devout christian wondering if they curse God, a mother thinking if she wants to murder her children, a good person wondering if they would enjoy raping someone. These thoughts terrify and/or severly disturb the sufferer, causing them to reassure themselves one way or another that they don't want to commit these actions which conflict with who they are. This is a horrible manifestation of OCD, as the more you reassure yourself that you will not commit these actions (the compulsion), the more and more frequently the thoughts will show up. Over time, these thoughts  can mentally beat down the sufferer, causing them to go into a depressed state or even contemplate suicide (as it did for me).   If not treated, OCD can be an absolutely dehabilitating disease that can take years of productivity and happiness from your life. However, as someone that has sufferred from the disorder, I can tell you that there is hope. Therapy through Cognititve Beahvioral Therapy and exposure, specifically from a physcologist or physchiastrist that specializes in OCD, can do wonders to break the cycle of thoughts and compulsions that is the monster known as OCD. Initially, breaking the cycle brings huge anxiety, but the more you recognize the thoughts as OCD and resist the urge to do compulsions, the less power and the less frequently the thoughts will occur.   Edit: Thanks for the gold stranger. :-)"

For obsessions you want to expose yourself to what you fear, and for compulsions you want to limit that behavior.  Imaginal exposure is particularly helpful for this presentation (for people who have dominant obsessions and mental compulsions). Resisting doing the mental rituals (for these obsessions) is key.  For people who don't respond to these treatments, there are new types of therapies that are being developed. For example, at our site (NYSPI/CUMC, New York area), we're using new strategies to help people that don't respond well to traditional therapy.

We recommend entering treatment as soon as possible. That's the best way to manage your treatment trajectory.  Lifetime prevalence is 2-3% (ex: 2-3 people out of 100). If you have a family member with OCD, your rate is closer to 10%. That shows OCD has a tendency to run in families. If you look at twin studies, if you have an identical twin with OCD, estimates are, 40-50% of the time, you'll also have OCD. This suggests that OCD has a genetic component, but it's not complete.

science,3dxpai,GadgetHackwrenchRR,7,Mon Jul 20 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"Have you come across any neurostim or electrophysiological treatments for ocd, so as to bypass the side-effect profiles of many of the first and second line medications for the disorder (e.g. clomipramine hcl and fluvoxamine)?   Both as a budding researcher and patient, I'm quite interested. Much as I love how well-managed the disorder is for me, there are certain side effects that, while not explicitly distressing, are still somewhat unpleasant.   Also, the above brings up the idea of knowing where and whether to inhibit or increase rates of firing. That brings two more questions:  1)Is there a particular model or well-defined functional network that we look at when understanding the neural correlates of the associate symptoms?  2)Do we see any feedback loops like those within the spine for reflexes within functional networks, which may account for a possibly evolved ""cognitive reflex"" that leads exhibits itself in the form of obsessions?"
science,3dxpai,illannoysnazi,11,Mon Jul 20 12:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, all medications including SSRI's can have side effects. Even though SSRi's are generally well tolerated, many of our patients don't want to be on them if they don't have to be for life.  We're studying whether CBT can be used as a strategy to help some people discontinue their medications. We're also studying novel treatments, including brain stimulation.  Several novel treatments are being investigated. They include: 1) Transcranial magnetic stimulation (which is using a magnet to stimulate certain brain areas) 2) Deep brain stimulation (which is a more invasive treatment because an electrode is placed in the brain to change the firing in a particular brain circuit).  Finally, some sites are doing neuro-surgery where lesions are made in specific brain circuits to interrupt them."

science,3dxpai,Ickarus_,26,Mon Jul 20 19:34:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions! I am a 2nd year U.S. allopathic medical student that has struggled with OCD since I was a small child. My current compulsions include skin picking, blinking and walking in pre-set patterns, counting and recounting my caloric intake, computer/keyboard compulsions, touching my belly button repeatedly, and tapping random things all the time. It's not been a problem personally or professionally for the most part, but I do occasionally find it limiting or harmful, ex. I have intentionally burnt myself pretty badly in the past and am trying to stay away from certain medical specialties (i.e. infectious diseases) as a result of my OCD. I have 2 questions:   OCD is often described as an anxiety disorder, but I personally have never felt very anxious (ex. believing that something terrible is or is not going to happen as the consequence of OCD behaviors). In my experience, I feel some mild physical/mental discomfort that causes me to compulse and there are a lot of arbitrary behaviors that I just have to do or irrational rules that I have to follow. Logically, I know I have the choice not to perform my compulsions, but my feelings usually override logic and I cannot resist. How would you approach treating a patient whose believes her obsessions and compulsions are not based in fear/anxiety? I have tried exposure and response prevention, which has been helpful, but I was wondering what other therapies (drug and psycho) are out there. Every couple of years, I will have a period of time where I get both motor and vocal tics, ex. humming in a high pitch voice or shrugging my right shoulder. Most tics are preceded by a mental urge to perform an action and somatic feeling of discomfort that is only relieved by ticcing, although on rare occasion a word or twitch will pop out involuntarily and surprise me. Usually I have to repeat a tic multiple times in a row until it feels ""just right"". To me, this subjective feeling of ""just right"" is very similar to what I feel with my OCD compulsions. It can be pretty hard for me to distinguish what is a tic and what is a compulsion. What is the relationship is between OCD and Tourette's? Do you think OCD and Tourette's should be treated differently clinically and pharmacologically?   TL;DR is in bold."

I worry about negatively affecting my daughter since I am constantly inquiring about how she feels (she is five) and I know I am harming my marriage by bringing up my wife's past. It is not fair to her when I do this and I know it but I cannot help it. I am currently seeing a therapist and I take 50MG of Anafranil a day.  I guess my question is this: Are there any strategies or treatments for Pure OCD I may not know about? Are there other medications I could try? I am better when I take the Anafranil but the OCD is still a big issue in my life. I would do almost anything to get rid of it. If there are any recommendations you could make I would appreciate it.

I later went to an intensive program where I did a bunch of exposure response prevention therapy (hated it, but it helped a lot).  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder senior year of high school. My OCD was so bad that it completely masked my comorbid bipolar disorder.

It got pretty dark but they're mostly recovered now, and hoping to be off the drugs in the next 6 months.  We know the OCD is something that will have to be managed going forwards, but we were warned that it is very likely they will have a relapse. Whilst we understand how to manage it, I was wondering what the likely hood the relapse will be as bad as the original episode, or if it's more likely to be minor, assuming we take action as soon as we notice something is wrong.  If I can cheekily ask a second question, I also wanted to know your opinion of mental health facilities (generally). Having recently spent a significant portion of time in one, I can say that whilst the staff where kind and friendly, the atmosphere created by some of the patients made the place a bit scary, and it really didn't feel like a place to get much better from mental health issues, more a place to be safe from them.

science,3dxpai,Boudicca_Rebellion,7,Mon Jul 20 12:44:42 2015 UTC,"Hello! I got a couple of questions.  During my own treatment, I had to conduct research by pulling together meta-studies that linked OCD to abnormalities to glutamate activity, as serotonergics proved to be ineffective or worsen my OCD symptoms. With strong NMDA-Glutamate antagonists, such as Rilutek, it gave significant, and near instant relief. However, given the ""dirtiness"" of the medication, I began to suffer from numerous liver issues.  I was wondering what research your team has done linking glutamate activity to OCD? And, if any more selective/specialized glutamate antagonists are being created for OCD treatment?  With the controversy on SSRI treatment, being that a large percentage of OCD sufferers do not receive significant relief within 2 months of SSRI use, why is serotonin still ruled as the most contributing neurochemical to the disorder/first line of treatment?  Research has been done on Ketamine showing near instant relief in OCD patients. Has your team conducted any research/success in creating a ketamine alternative, mimicking it's success but not it's horrific long term side-effects?  Just another question; OCD is seen more so in males than females.  Signs, given no major injuries or other medical conditions are present, start around puberty.

I struggled with flavors and textures of many foods until my late teens.  The trick to making healthy food kid friendly isn't to slather it in butter or sugar, either. It's simply to ease them into the flavors.   My kids eat whatever vegetables I set them up with, because I also know how to pick out healthy food that doesn't dip into the bin of strong flavors. Mushrooms and onions aren't your typical kid food, but you sure as will have great luck with peas, carrots, celery, and the fresher, with less crud on them from the store, the better.   On a side note, I can't even choke down the celery they sell at the store precut, I think they've taken to soaking it in brine. Guh. No amount of washing can save it."

Healthy eating, I would say, is FAAAAR more important during development than after.  Don't raise your children as your parents raised you. They are from a different time.

My parents tried the same approach you're doing, and it didn't end well. Once I was a teen, I pigged out on whatever unhealthy food I could get because they were so forbidden.

science,3e2bxr,Ouyllyum,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:16 2015 UTC,"I can try. Feeding mice a high fat diet resulted in oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and caused fat to be deposited in the liver and other organs where it doesn't belong. The researchers contest that a change in the connective tissue between the fat cells (adipocytes), due to oxidative stress, prevented them from expanding to store the circulating fatty acids that were damaging other organs and causes all the trouble.  By giving the mice a lot of vitamin E (an antioxidant), they were able to combat the oxidative stress, prevent the remodeling of the fat cells, and basically improve the health of the obese mice."

science,3e2bxr,Ouyllyum,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"Whew. Umm. Okay. To stick with the ELI5 idea:  During normal metabolism and cellular function, free radicals (""reactive oxygen species"") are produced. These are highly-reactive oxygen-containing compounds with an extra electron that really wants to get rid of; in this instance, we're talking about superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. They can react with all sorts of proteins and stuff, causing cellular dysfunction and damage.  But, since they form through natural metabolism, the body has also developed defenses against them. Certain enzymes and vitamins (peroxidases and vitamin E, for example) help get rid of these things by reducing (as opposed to oxidizing) the reactive oxygen species and preventing them from doing damage.  However, many diseases and stimuli (diabetes, obesity, inflammation) can increase the production of reactive oxygen species. This is bad news when it overwhelms our natural ability to get rid of the reactive oxygen species. The result: ""oxidative stress"". Oxidative stress is a catch-all term to define a state where the production of these free radicals exceeds their removal, leading to cellular damage and ultimately dysfunction."

After 2 years they showed - improved insulin sensitivity, 10% weight loss, decrease in cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased blood pressure.  Perhaps more importantly they showed a good level of adherence to CR (82% of subjects completed the 2 years). A key issue with CR is getting people to maintain CR so showing good adherence is pretty big. However, the target level of CR (25% decrease) was not maintained for 2 years but most maintained a CR of 10% suggesting that the more chronic CR typically used in animals is not needed in humans."

MFP takes your lifestyle, height, weight, sex and age and gives you what I feel like is a pretty good approximate daily goal.  You can then set it to adjust for weight loss or sustaining.  The Fitbit then adds calories based on your exercise so if you have a day where you walk a lot, go to the gym or something you get more but you're staying aware of just how much more.    With this method I've lost about 35lbs and it just generally helps me eat better and stay in shape.

After 2 years they showed - improved insulin sensitivity, 10% weight loss, decrease in cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased blood pressure.  Perhaps more importantly they showed a good level of adherence to CR (82% of subjects completed the 2 years). A key issue with CR is getting people to maintain CR so showing good adherence is pretty big. However, the target level of CR (25% decrease) was not maintained for 2 years but most maintained a CR of 10% suggesting that the more chronic CR typically used in animals is not needed in humans."

That means once you got to Earth (or wherever) you would already need to have a preferred handedness. Keep in mind that if you're producing chiral glycine randomly you will have what's called a ""racemic"" mixture, which means both handednesses. You aren't ever working with a single molecule."

In typical laboratory experiments which produce chiral molecules such as amino acids, little or no enantiomeric excess is observed in the product if no driving forces to promote a chirality bias (e.g. left- or right-handed circularly polarized light) are used [15]. This may also be true for the present experiment. However, since homochiral d1-Gly has a potential to be a catalyst for amplifying an enantiomeric excess of a molecule under certain conditions [24], the initially formed d1-Gly, which must have either R or S configuration, could induce an enantiomeric excess in the whole d1-Gly formed by surface reactions.   If I'm understanding this correctly:  The chirality of the first amino acid formed in whichever molecular cloud was the source of earth's AAs, happened to be L-chiral, which catalyzed the formation of the rest to be so as well.  In that case, title is definitely misleading. Very interesting study though."

science,3dukkg,Lightfiend,665,Sun Jul 19 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"Physical appearance is a larger factor in relationships that form before people have the opportunity to learn more about one another. Seems like a reasonable conclusion. People tend to pair off based on similar physical attractiveness when told to pair off absent other information. As people get to know one another other factors begin to come into play. So relationships that form early tend to place a heavier weight on what someone looks like, whereas relationships that form late place less weight on those things."

Science isn't just a set of disconnected results that only signify exactly what they test. Those results are supposed to confirm or deny larger models, and sometimes the results themselves inspire models which can be further tested with other models.  Kitworks is offering a model here: ""If you start a relationship with a stranger, you have to base on that on appearances."" Or, probably a better model would be ""When starting a relationship with a stranger, your knowledge of them is limited, so appearances contribute more to your perception."" The latter model could be tested by giving different subjects more or less information about a potential partner, including a picture, and then having them rate the likelihood of starting a relationship with them. The prediction from the model would be that the image would have a proportionally greater impact, the less other information was provided."

Stating that something is common sense typically implies that it is so obvious that you're a bit dumb for having questioned it. I think that reading the statement as ""unworthy of examination"" is a pretty standard way to read that use of the phrase ""common sense"", and I think that claiming he's ""reading into it"" would be similar to hearing someone be very sarcastic, and seeing a second person getting offended by the sarcasm, and then jumping in to say ""well, second person, first person didn't actually SAY the offensive thing, you're just READING INTO IT!"""

In phytoplankton, this concerns a group called coccolithophores, but the vast majority of phytoplankton species do not build calcite shells so they shouldn't be much effected by ocean acidification. I've also seen research that suggests certain calcified coccolithophore species (usually those with thinner calcite shells) can grow just fine despite ocean acidification.  In fact, since the acidification is caused by having more dissolved carbon (CO2), and phytoplankton need carbon to photosynthesize, some people theorize it will make phytoplankton grow faster since they won't become carbon limited as quickly. This effect really depends on the supply of other limiting nutrients, such as nitrogen or phosphorous.  However, it is theorized that global warming (related to acidification but different) will reduce phytoplankton growth rates through thermal stratification of the upper ocean layer and reduced nutrient fluxes from the deep into the sunlit surface ocean."

science,3dxnms,OrbitRock,5,Mon Jul 20 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for bringing this study to my attention, it was actually just published today so it's as fresh as you can get in the world of academic research. I always take modeling studies with a grain of salt, but here is my take on it...  This new study is a so-called 'meta-study,' compiling data from many laboratory and some field experiments to extrapolate how phytoplankton communities would respond to elevated CO2 concentrations. Figure 1 shows that increased CO2 caused a wide range of growth responses among phytoplankton, some increased and some decreased, and there was a lot of variation even within functional groups and taxa.   The only groups with statistically significant growth rates responses were diazotrophs (nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria) and large Eukaryotes (such as diatoms), which showed increased growth rates under elevated CO2 conditions, not a decrease as suggested by the first comment in this thread.  This observed increase in growth rates is caused by increased carbon availability, which alleviates carbon limitation (something I mentioned in my previous comment). Obviously if some phytoplankton groups can grow faster and out-compete other groups, it's going to alter the community composition and potentially shift the entire marine food web.   Something I think that's slightly misleading about stating ""ocean acidification alters phytoplankton growth rates"" is that the growth altering mechanism is not directly caused by a change in pH, it's actually due to increased carbon (i.e.nutrient) availability, which has a side effect of slightly lowering the pH of ocean water."

From the article:   They explained that the dimethyl sulfide created by the phytoplankton gets carried into the atmosphere at high altitudes, and then it transforms and helps produce the aerosols that move downwind   the article did a poor job explaining this, but the dimethyl sulfide is photooxidized in the atmosphere to other sulfur containing compounds, notable sulfuric acid. It's this sulfuric acid that acts as cloud condensation nuclei. It also contributes to acid rain.    It has long been suggested that we use stratospheric sulfate aerosols to combat global warming. However, the sulphate aerosols produced from marine plankton stay in the lower atmosphere, so it's cooling effect comes primarily from the clouds formed.   Theoretically, I could imagine severe unintended consequences resulting from too much artificial DMS injection in the lower atmosphere, namely altered precipitation patterns due to the clouds formed (potential for severe floods and/or droughts in certain regions) as well as acid rain"

science,3dxnms,tothvito,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"On cloud formation: I do believe quite the opposite is happening to what the title of this post suggests. The aerosol cloud formation based on microorganisms mostly results cirrus clouds. Clouds play a complex role in the climate system, and the ""complex"" is the scientific term for ""we do not know how it works"". More here.  Anyway, what I know is that due to their thickness the cirrus clouds let the light in, but do not let the the infra-red radiation escape to upper layers of the atmosphere. So eventually it is a warming effect. But I do believe a climatologist will explain it better. Thus, if the system described in the article is correct, it could made things worse.  On acidification: the main problem with acidification is not the difficulties with calcification as /u/micromonas suggested (also it is indeed a great problem), but the shift of available carbon form. The carbon in the water is available in different forms, CO2, carbonic acid, hydrocarbonates, etc. and different autotrophs use a specific carbon form. With the shift of pH the concentration of the dominant carbon form may change and even disappear, making the photosynthesis impossible. Anyway, it is a well studied area in freshwaters, so the you should look for limnological articles."

science,3du06c,Shruiken,384,Sun Jul 19 17:14:25 2015 UTC,"Well, a superlens is to optics what a superconductor is to electronics. It's one of those ""holy grails"" that will open up new discoveries and applications.  When using a microscope, there's a limit to the amplification, somewhere around 1500/2000x. This limit is caused by the wavelengths of light: resolving the smallest detail is limited to the wavelength of light. At a 1500x magnification you have a resolution of about 200nm. It's called the Rayleigh criterion. We can build lenses that go over 5000x magnification, but the physical properties of the light (i.e. wavelength) doesn't allow us to resolve a higher resolution. It's like zooming into pixels: there's a certain point where there's not additional resolution.  Electron microscopes surpass this limit: electrons are so small, they give us a huge amound of detail resolving. That's great, having a 50.000x magnification, but ESM's have a few downsides: apart from being hugely expensive, you can't put living organisms in it, you need to chemically fix your subject, etc.  This ""superlens"" will allow us to circumvent the diffraction limit (Rayleigh) and be of great use in biology: watching living cells at a 10.000x magnification would show us some new things. I'm not sure how this'd work on the macrofield, if we could improve Hubble by putting a superlens in it. Optics isn't my specialty, so maybe someone else can chip in.  EDIT Because of the overwhelming interest, I decided to dive into it a bit more:  It is pretty hard to wrap your head around.. Like I said, I'm not an expert in this field, but what might help:   About refraction: when you put a pencil in a cup of water, it looks like it bends. When you would put a pencil in something with a negative refraction index, it would look like it's coming out. It's weird stuff, almost hologram-like. There's a so-called ""far-field"" and ""near-field"" in electromagnetism, and in everything that emits or reflects light (because light is a visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum) Far-field is what we see, they're called propagated waves. It are the reflected, propagated light-waves that our eyes perceive, that a camera can capture, etc. Near-field only exist a few wavelengths from the source (or reflecting/refracting surface), and they die out real fast. They're called evanescent waves. Evanescent waves don't have a typical sinoid shape, they logaritmically decay. So they start high, die out fast, then stay dead. This ""superlens"" is placed within a few wavelenghts from this source, in the near-field. The negative refraction index would bend a propagating lightwave in an interesting way, but it also ""reverses"" the logaritmic decay of the evanescent wave. The wave that died out comes back to life!   Some images to help you visualize the concept:   Propagated and evanescent wave Image taken with a superlens.

What is happening is computational photography.   Cameras move through space and time. Normally we want to capture a single moment. But increasingly, cameras are taking many exposures when you push the 'button' on your camera. These additional exposures taken in series, often filtered, provide additional information about the moment the photographer was trying to capture, and this information can be exploited via mathematics.  By looking at a series of images, even if the images are separated only by microseconds, along with motion sensing, one can infer previously inaccessible information about the scene. This information can be used to enhance resolution and dynamic range, remove distortion, provide stabilization and otherwise maximize the potential of the data captured by the camera. Combined, fantastic enhancements can be made to your photos, all without violating the laws of Physics."

All things equal, more photons landing on the imager generally means the camera can resolve a better picture at a given brightness.  A camera system can only be as good as the weakest link in the signal chain. This is why the ""megapixel race"" can be a negative thing. In some cases, it would be better for manufacturers to invest budget in better optics or sensitivity than in more megapixels. But many consumers just look at the megapixel number and assume that more means better. Sometimes it does, increasingly though, it often doesn't. It's like continuing to increase horsepower in a given car. At a certain point it stops making much practical difference unless the tires, drive train etc are also scaled.  In cameras, other critical variables include the optical properties of the lens (passing more photons or not), the surface area of the imager (more photons landing), the sensitivity of the imager (less amplification of photons required (ie noise)), length of exposure, etc. There are challenging trade-offs that must be made in all these areas in the design of any camera."

The theoretical negative index lens ""enlarges"" or ""stretches out"" visible light? Could you elaborate on how it circumvents the physical limit imposed by the wavelength of visible light? It sounds potentially amazing, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it conceptually.   Edit: fascinating answers, thanks for all the replies. I had always thought that wavelengths imposed a hard physical limit on the ""size"" of information that could be transmitted via electromagnetism. Can anyone comment on how this fits with the wave/particle duality? Are these evanescent waves not subject to the same type of rules or behaviors that traditional propagating waves are?"
science,3du06c,tryptonite12,9,Sun Jul 19 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"There are two kinds of waves that are created when light reflects from an object:  1) Propagating waves, like sine waves 2) Evanescent waves, like exponential decay  It turns out that the first kind of waves (sine waves) carry the low-resolution information. The second kind of waves (evanescent waves) carry the high-resolution information. Unfortunately, these waves also die out within a few microns after leaving the object. If the detector is farther away than that, the information is lost. That is the nature of the physical limit on resolution.  The ""perfect lens"" is made of a material that can preserve evanescent waves. Instead of exponential decay, they grow exponentially within the lens. Some designs can even convert them to propagating waves. That way we can collect all the light, not just the low-resolution components."
science,3du06c,slumberjak,2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:37 2015 UTC,When you say the waves grow exponentially does this mean they're actually getting more energy? Wouldn't that also potentially add noise to the signal you're trying to strengthen?

However, there are very tiny ripples on those ripples.  Meaning sub-wavelength data is there.  There is no way for a lens with a positive refractory index to pull that sub-wavelength data out.  Metamaterials let us manipulate the light much more thoroughly than traditional lenses.   There is no physical limit imposed by the light that is being overcome but rather a limit in our ability to manipulate it is being overcome.

science,3du06c,lolwat_is_dis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is that the solution to the wave equation is just like that.  The easiest way to think about it is with total internal refraction. Imagine a plane wave exiting water into air at an angle. This results in a plane wave with a different wavelength in air at a different angle. You can easily work out the angle because the peaks and troughs of both waves have to match at the interface (that is the ""boundary condition"").  You'll find that at a certain angle you can have a wave in glass that makes a boundary condition for which the plane wave in air just can't exist. Even if it travels parralel to the surface it doesn't make peaks and troughs that are as close together as the ones in the water.  At that point you get total internal reflection and there is no propagating wave outside the water.  In order to see really small features you need to have waves that have short wavelengths on the object surface, but these waves don't propagate so we can't see them.  Evanescent waves are just what you get to satisfy the boundary condition (it still has to be satisfied) when you can't have propagating waves."

science,3du06c,lolwat_is_dis,4,Tue Jul 21 12:16:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this technology can't be used for things like Hubble. The ""super"" resolution is carried by those short-lived evanescent waves, which die out within a few microns of the source.

This article speaks of a lens for radio waves; http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2012/new-metamaterial-lens-focuses-radio-waves-1114  This lens has the ability to see through the surface of objects and actually detect the molecular composition of them; http://scitechdaily.com/metamaterial-lens-ten-times-power-current-lens/  Novel Metamaterial 'Flat Lens' Creates 3D Images in Free Space http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/lens-052813.cfm This lens focuses UV light and creates a 3 dimensional floating image -- not sure if that's achieved by capturing some of the ""surface normals"" of the objects viewed (the angle light is refracted from the object).  Overall, what I get from these articles is that they are looking at ""structures"" more than just a pure lens for various frequencies of light. They are also creating ""active"" lenses -- then 2nd one mentioned uses heated wires to change some electromagnetic properties. What the OP hinted at but did not really explain, is that positive absorption materials can be overcome by either structure or magnetic changes -- and they are getting better at figuring out what these are. But it seems like it's on a ""frequency range"" basis. The perfect lens is going to be different structures and magnetic manipulations for different ranges of frequencies (for the time being).  I've always thought you could super saturate an material with light, and then, like a capacitor, when it can hold ""no more"" light, detect everything coming off of it. It's a bit more tricky than the overview, and would require collimated light, but I still think this would create the ultimate photon detector, especially when the lens is super cooled.

As for your linguistic pedantry, ""meta-"" means ""after"" or ""beyond,"" and in this case describes composite materials whose properties go beyond what is physically possible with a non-composite material. For example, having a negative refractive index, which goes beyond the traditional n=0 limit.  The reason we use the term ""Metamaterial"" instead of ""Composite Material"" is that the term composites already exists, and its use has to do with mechanical properties, like rigidity."

Low loss metals near their plasma frequencies, for instance have n < 1.  This might seem mysterious at first, given the traditional definition of n = c/v. n<1 implies the speed is greater than c! But this speed is the magnitude of the phase velocity, which is only equal to the magnitude of energy velocity in non-dispersive materials. Metals are quite dispersive near their plasma frequency, meaning a slightly different frequency has a very different index of refraction. The energy velocity is strictly related to this dispersion, and is always smaller than c."

Those senses are still around in English technical and scientific terms: think of metamorphosis (a change of form) or metatarsal (after the ankle, i.e. the foot). I don't know for sure, but my guess is that whoever coined the word metamaterial was going for the more mundane sense of meta-, probably something like ""beyond (normal) materials"", rather than in the sense of transcendence or self-reference."

science,3du06c,aphysics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"You're not misunderstanding. The superlens (your first reference) and hyperlens (second ref) are both ways to exceed the diffraction limit. Both are achievable, as far as we've found, only with engineered materials (or metamaterials).   The superlens relies on optical resonances of both the magnetic and electric sort, to create effective permeability and permittivity that are both negative. This is based on structural (geometric) properties. Because both of those quantities are negative, phase propagates in the opposite direction that power does. A consequence of going from a normal material into one of these materials is a weird change in direction, which can be used to bring together light that otherwise starts out diverging. Hence, a lens.  The hyperlens relies on layered materials, the permittivities of which ""average out"" differently in the different directions (an analogy can be made with capacitors in series vs in parallel), creating a material that acts like a metal in one direction, and a dielectric in the other. This allows off-axis states with abnormally small wavelengths to propagate, compared to the wavelengths they would have in free space. This means if the hyperlens is very close to the light source, these small wavelengths allowed in the material dictate the diffraction limit, not the wavelengths in free space."

This points to a possible genetic proof of similarity. If a specific gene can be changed to produce the same behaviors, it shows that the rest of the circuitry in mice is probably quite similar to humans' as well.    Also, think about it this way: most mammalian brains are very similar. Humans have certain ""higher"" cognitive processes layered on top (language processing, abstract reasoning, etc.) but fundamentally, we share many of the same cognitive processes with other animals. These include fear responses, problem solving skills, memory formation, an many more. Again, humans are often more sophisticated in these areas, but most animals possess these abilities as well.   Mice are similar to humans in 2 key ways: they 1. are excellent problem solvers, and 2. are social animals. This is the reason many behaviors studied in mice can lead to reasonable hypotheses about human behavior.   Researchers also understand that sometimes, behaviors don't translate. This is why drug trials tend to begin with mice, move to more complex animals, and then finally are tested on humans."

science,3du1zc,_supert_,6,Mon Jul 20 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Animal testing is important in behavioral testing within the field of neuropsychopharmacology because it allows us to examine functional and structural changes in the brain that occur after certain behavioral and pharmacological (and in most cases, a combination of both) conditions/treatments have been imposed on the animals. For example, in a PTSD stress paradigm using rats, after single-prolonged stress exposure (restraint stress, forced swim task, and ether anesthesia), rats were administered either a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist or a vehicle, and tested on various behavioral tasks. The results showed significant differences in recorded stress-response for the various tasks, and clear differences in GR expression between the two groups was apparent in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.   So how does this translate to humans? Well it has long since been thought that the HPA-axis (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is a term used to describe the main endocrine stress response) becomes dysfunctional in PTSD patients, so modeling this same allostatic shift post-stress exposure in rats is important for understanding what potential drug treatments might help restore proper HPA-axis function as well as proper function in the hippocampus, medial frontal cortex, and amygdala.  Edit: here is a link to the paper I am referencing regarding the PTSD rat model http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645220700718X"
science,3du1zc,Blojangles,9,Sun Jul 19 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"This is a great question, and it is something the field actively struggles with.  My direct experience was in drug addiction research (using mouse/rat models), but we also looked at depression, anxiety, and social behaviors as those issues all seem to be interlinked.    To model depression for example, we used a ""forced swim test"", where mice or rats are put in a bucket with water, and forced to swim for a given period of time.  There is no way to escape, and the measure of susceptibility to depression is correlated with how soon they stop swimming and just float.  In translating to human terms, one could imagine that this represents a person struggling with insurmountable stresses until they simply cannot continue.  Of course what is happening to the rodent is not really what happens to a person with depression, but the reason people keep using the test is empirical: when the rodents are given anitdepressant drugs, they swim longer without giving up.  It is a very valid question to ask whether the forced swim test actually models depression.  It probably doesn't.  But, it seems to work for many drugs that have been tested so far which have gone on to have clinical relevance (whether or not they really address the root cause of depression is another matter.  And recently a possible link between antidepressant use and later brain disorders has been raised which leads me to question the whole strategy.).  I suppose the closing argument for animal models of human behavior are that we don't have a better option for testing new drugs.  You can't experiment on people, primates are pretty expensive and it would be very difficult to get results quickly, and rodents allow for relatively quick results in a relatively similar kind of social mammal (as opposed to cats/dogs).  In other words, it kind of works, and it is the best option of what we have to work with for now.  But of course it is not ideal."

There is plenty of research on how characteristics of researchers can affect human participant behavior (e.g., sex, age, attractiveness, and demeanor of researcher), but normally this is a manipulated variable of interest and I'm not aware of studies that have this for animal participation. It is quite rare for a psychiatric evaluation in the diagnostic sense."

science,3du1zc,Ape1,3,Sun Jul 19 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see.  Again, no it is not common to do continual evaluations on researchers that work the animals.  Typically you are asked about your thoughts on animal research and hopefully you believe that the work that you are doing is ethically justified.  I'm sure there are people that have been turned off to it, but usually the folks that would have a problem with animal research (an extremely broad term), never do the work or see the conditions which animals are raised or why the work is done.  Mice of course have very different standards than primates. This is anecdotal, but it is seems more difficult for folks to separate the work with their empathy for the animal if it is a primate (understandably).  Most researchers are fine with this cost of research and become quickly desensitized to euthanizations of mice, just as a surgeon becomes desensitized to using their knife on patients. This is exactly why Institutional Review Boards are necessary, to act as objective judges of the costs and benefits of studies.    Regarding the torturing animals comment.  In short, yes there is a tendency for those that intentionally and continually harm animals at a young age to grow up to have lower empathy towards other humans.  This is not at all a sure path to psychopathy, just a red flag. Of course, intention is everything.  My brother once killed our bird because he accidentally slammed it in a slider door as it flew across the room (sad stuff). This is different from a child doing it for fun and a researcher testing drugs on mice to create safer chemo treatments for humans, increasing quality of life, and saving untold lives.  The amount of information that we have learned from animal testing cannot be understated.  However, not all research is worthy of conducting on animals.  Is a different smelling shampoo really worth 1,000 (made up number) mouse lives?  How about learning about the mechanisms behind exercise induced Brain plasticity or how to prevent strokes?  Animal Studies are turned down every day for not meeting the impact criteria (the ""why do we care?"") of their institutions or grant organization.  I personally think it is silly to be ""for animal testing"" or ""against animal testing"" and I'm inclined to believe that the person has not had enough exposure to either argument to come to such a conclusion.  Some folks believe a mouse life is worth every bit the same as a human life.  If they believe that and are against testing, I can understand their consistency.  Most people do not believe this (myself included), but also believe that mice lives ARE worth something. So the issue becomes, what conditions are acceptable and what research merits testing with animals."

As far as I know there is no psychological evaluation that people have to do to work with animals, but then again the procedures we use and the oversight programs that exist for animal use are pretty rigorous.  They take this issue very seriously.  I know that occasionally there are issues that are reported about institutions mismanaging their animal care, but this is by far the exception and not the rule.  They lose the risk of losing all their federal funding if they are found to be mistreating animals.  That is not a risk anyone will take.  That may not be what you are asking about though.  From my personal experience working with animals and the people who handle them, I would wager that on average you'd find the animal handlers are actually more sympathetic or empathetic toward the animals they work with than the average person.  I see people exercise great care and affection toward the rodents they work with, especially rats as they are more socially interactive and developed.    The average person I figure is more likely to want to just kill a rodent as a kneejerk reaction against what they find to be icky or strange.  Researchers see the value in their animals, and may even feel a strong sense of personal gratitude toward the animals for the work that they do.  Seriously, we couldn't do what we do without them.

What they found was people who were taken into hospital for depression (say suicide attempt) and put under with Ketamine, they would come out of it feeling extreme relief of their depressive symptoms.   Turned out the drug was impacting an NMDA receptor in the brain and that these have a MUCH greater impact on depression than serotonin receptors."
science,3dsr58,DontTickleMyPickle,13,Sun Jul 19 08:52:28 2015 UTC,What are the benefits of this drug over ketamine?
science,3dsr58,AlwaysBeNice,37,Sun Jul 19 09:44:14 2015 UTC,"Ketamine has serious hallucinogenic side-effects. It's sold on the streets as ""Special K"". Even under medical supervision patients experience feelings of being outside of their own body.  It's arguably one of the explanations for people having ""Near Death Experiences"" while in surgery. They hallucinate these experiences which are caused by this specific side-effect of the drug.  They managed to successfully isolate whatever causes the beneficial impact and remove the hallucinogen."
science,3dsr58,DontTickleMyPickle,9,Sun Jul 19 09:50:06 2015 UTC,But the studies that have been done that showed these affects always had people using an amount that was far below the threshold dose for hallucinogenic effects anyways.
science,3dsr58,AlwaysBeNice,-6,Sun Jul 19 10:03:58 2015 UTC,"I'm unaware of the studies on the subject.  What I am aware of is they removed whatever chemical structure which allowed the drug to cause these hallucinations. Ketamine is not meant to treat depression, Ketamine is meant to be used for anesthesia.  If you use Ketamine for such a purpose you are simply trying to benefit from a side-effect.   Rapastinel/Glyx-13 is made specifically to cause this positive effect. You are not betting on a side-effect with this drug."
science,3dsr58,DontTickleMyPickle,16,Sun Jul 19 15:00:53 2015 UTC,"This isn't quite right.    Glyx-13 is chemically unrelated to ketamine, but both bind to the NMDA receptor complex, albeit at different sites.  Ketamine acts as a negative allosteric modulator at the NMDA-site (NMDA is an exogenous ligand that was used to identify this binding site), while glyx-13 binds at the glycine site (both glycine and and glutamate act as endogenous ligands for the NMDA-complex).  So while their mechanisms are similar, the effects aren't identical.    At this point, it is hypothesized that NMDA-antagonism exerts its anti-depressant effect via a complex causal chain, terminating in increasing hippocampal neuroplasticity.  It seems that both NMDA-antagonism and glycinergic agonism do the trick, albeit with different side-effect profiles (not that ketamine's is particularly bad--the high is typically well tolerated ;))."
science,3dsr58,ebolaRETURNS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:07:06 2015 UTC,Rapastinel/Glyx-13 is made specifically to cause this positive effect.   So it's not just ketamine without the hallucinogenic effect?
science,3dsr58,AlwaysBeNice,11,Sun Jul 19 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"More accurately it's a chemical that interacts with some receptors in a manner similar to ketamine.  The actual chemical structures of ketamine and rapastinel are strikingly different... although if you do a 3D spacefilling model with polarity, maybe they aren't all that different depending on what receptors ""see"". A friend of mine who used to do compound optimization and a bunch of computational chemistry has shown me compounds that had very different chemical structures on paper when you draw them in 2D or pseudo-3D, but when the 3D structure was predicted and spacefilling modeling done sometimes had very similar ""faces""."

All of the interviews I saw suggest they used ketamine as a model for how they could develop a drug which successfully targets the NMDA receptor.  The drug is chemically similar to Ketamine, I don't believe Ketamine is the basis for the drug. That being said I don't believe they have gone into detail about their development processes. Everything they have released currently is about the trials and the way the drug interacts with the brain. Not about how they made it."
science,3dsr58,DontTickleMyPickle,8,Sun Jul 19 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"Rapstinel is a tetrapeptide weak NMDA agonist, similar mode of action, not chemically related to ketamine, more like an artificial neurotransmitter."

science,3dsr58,paulfromatlanta,20,Sun Jul 19 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"There's a lot to be careful of with the existing antidepressants that take weeks before they reach therapeutic levels in the body. People who are severely depressed and have experienced suicidal ideation are most vulnerable in the period between starting an antidepressant and waiting up to two months to get to a point of feeling functionally better. The reason for this is that severe depression is accompanied by such a strong lack of motivation that even suicidal thoughts are deemed too much trouble to act on.   But slow, incremental alleviation of depressive symptoms, regaining a sense of motivation without adequately suppressing the accompanying feelings of sadness, worthlessness, etc. is a very dangerous thing. The energy and  impetus to act upon suicidal thoughts in this period often leads to attempts to follow these plans through.   By eliminating that risk period, lives can be saved without resorting to inpatient stays during medication adjustment periods."

I did find support in a literature review study published in 2009, and this 2003 study notes that elderly suicidal patients require special attention after beginning treatment because of the longer response time. A German study of inpatient hospital programs was able to note a week-by-week increase in suicidality after the start of treatment."
science,3dsr58,WELLinTHIShouse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"I read those papers but I don't see how they support the idea that antidepressants increase suicide because of the returning of motivation. The first paper even directly refutes this idea. Here are a few quotes from the paper:   Thus the data that bear, albeit indirectly, on suicide risk in relation to phase of depression provide no consistent support for the belief that suicide risk increases as patients begin to recover; if anything, they refute it. Schweizer and colleagues (11) wrote, “As superficially appealing as the long-held mobilization-of-energy hypothesis is, it has little in the way of evidence to substantiate it.” We agree.   .   Of the half-dozen suicide experts we spoke to, all said they had been taught the theory and believed it to be true. Although a few thought that there must be some studies that back the idea, none could actually point to any data in support of it. “It’s something clinicians just know,” one said.   .   Without some substantiating data, this hunch does not warrant its long-held status as established truth."

I s'pose being addicted to an antidepressant probably isn't the end of the world if you're depressed, but it's non-ideal.  The article does say that it precisely targets specific areas of the brain, so maybe that minimizes the risk of addiction..?  I'm also assuming the fact that they mention there aren't many side effects means they're not expecting any sort of atony or convulsions in high doses.. [Can't remember right now which direction GABA disinhibition would likely go.]  Anyone know enough neuropharmacology to comment?"

The drug starts to play with GABA receptors, like benzodiazepines, barbituates and alcohol. I've seen some papers comparing Xanax, for example, to crack cocaine in terms of addictiveness.  I entirely agree that an addictive medicine is probably a fair trade if it resolves a major depressive episode, especially on the sorts of time scales this article is talking about. However, in my experience many doctors can be extremely reluctant to prescribe an addictive drug, even it if demonstrably helps the patient, because they have legitimate concerns about tolerances and dosage escalation.  A drug that solves all a patient's problems is all well and good, but if your doctor doesn't want to prescribe it to you because they don't want to spend the next few years trying to wean you off it, it's far from ideal in practical terms."

I was asking if someone with more experience in the area than me had any thoughts on whether it could have these sort of effects.  There are different GABA receptors and different binding sites on each receptor, and there may be differences in how even otherwise identical GABA receptors act in different parts of the brain.  The specifics at this sort of level of detail are beyond my experience and knowledge, at least to the extent that I should be making definitive statements about them in this sub. But yes, the reason I asked the question and am curious about any answers I may get, is because I saw ""fast acting GABA modulating drug"" [paraphrasing] when I looked at the article and immediately thought of Xanax specifically and benzos in general."
science,3dsr58,moonbuggy,5,Sun Jul 19 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a non-expert, but I can tell you from experience that conventional anti-depressants such as SSRI's have withdrawal symptoms, so it's not like you can just flat out stop an SSRI regiment without experiencing some pretty severe (depending on the drug and circumtances, of course) withdrawal. I did not experience a ""craving"" for the drugs like a nicotine or opiate addict would, but missing a dose made me pretty amazingly sick (symptoms of SSRI withdrawal syndrome include nausea, headaches, worsening of deppressive symptoms, sexual dysfunction, etc.).  I don't think SSRIs constitute and out-and-out ""addiction"" though (again, i'm a non-expert), so if these new drugs do cause cravings, etc it could be a new set of problems."
science,3dsr58,WELLinTHIShouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:20:34 2015 UTC,"I believe there's atleast a little bit of debate about whether SSRI's can be considered addictive or not. I've not looked into it a great deal, but my understanding is they are generally not considered  addictive, but there are some people who claim they are.  As I understand it, there's no real evidence of a psychological addiction to SSRIs, though the discontinuation effects may be similar to effects you'd expect from a physical addiction.  The reason I mention addiction in this case though, is that the drug in this article interacts with GABA receptors, which is the same receptor that benzodiazapines and alcohol tend to play with. These are quite addictive drugs, both psychologically and physically, in a different league than any potential addiction issues with SSRIs. It's my understanding that withdrawals from drugs that play with GABA levels are the only withdrawals that can actually be fatal.  So yeah, I'm not quite sure if antidepressant discontinuation syndrome ['antidepressant' because it's possibly even more common from some SNRIs than the SSRIs - Effexor will zap you in the brain, for example] is technically an addiction/withdrawal type deal or not. Maybe someone with proper experience in the matter can bring some clarity to the issue. I'm not particularly concerned about convulsing until I die if I miss an SSRI/SNRI dose though.  edit: I should add that I'm not an expert either. I find it interesting to read about drugs people I know take, and I consider it sensible to read about drugs that I take. So I'm basing what I've said on what I remember from various papers I've read over the years, rather than any formal education or professional experience in the area."
science,3dsr58,ghostdate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between physical dependence and addiction.    Yes. Addiction—or compulsive drug use despite harmful consequences—is characterized by an inability to stop using a drug; failure to meet work, social, or family obligations; and, sometimes (depending on the drug), tolerance and withdrawal. The latter reflect physical dependence in which the body adapts to the drug, requiring more of it to achieve a certain effect (tolerance) and eliciting drug-specific physical or mental symptoms if drug use is abruptly ceased (withdrawal). Physical  dependence can happen with the chronic use of many drugs—including many prescription drugs, even if taken as instructed. Thus, physical dependence in and of itself does not constitute addiction, but it often accompanies addiction. This distinction can be difficult to discern, particularly with prescribed pain medications, for which the need for increasing dosages can represent tolerance or a worsening underlying problem, as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction.   Effexor withdrawal is a special sort of hell, and I've only ever been late on a dose. As little as 8 hours (missing a bedtime dose because you forgot to pick up a refill before the pharmacy closed) can lead to the most debilitating withdrawal symptoms. I keep saying I'll never let that happen again, but it still does, once in a while. It is possible to minimize these withdrawal symptoms by titrating up with Prozac while titrating down with Effexor - as Prozac isn't generally accompanied by severe withdrawal symptoms - and I managed to mask the fact that I missed a dose once because I had to take so much gabapentin for nerve pain."

Barring the joke, this may lead to the use of solar fuel cells as a means of high-intensity power with a hydrogen-based fuel economy. Obvious applications like solar-power hydrogen-fueled cars will become a thing with this.  EDIT: I would not be surprised that, if developed, this can lead to household solar cell usage, with the only limitations are of hydrogen fuel supply, barring the inherent danger of something so flammable (alongside the reportedly higher-than-normal cost of hydrogen gas production). But with the actual real risk, this may hamper such efforts, resulting in a more likely industry-wide utilization of solar cells, so instead of those ye-olde coal plants that generate your state's power, it could be a solar fuel cell plant instead.  EDIT2: Back to the car concept, again. With the risk of hydrogen explosion, I would not be surprised of a sort of hybridization of technologies for future car development away from fossil fuel usage. A combination of today's electric car battery tech combined with solar fuel cell usage (and a much safer and smaller hydrogen supply tank) may be the future.

Hydrogen can leak without anyone knowing and is a very small molecule stored at high pressure so it leaks often. It burns EXTREMELY readily and actually explodes. If you puncture a lithium battery, there will be a great deal of energy released, but it is not a gas explosion like hydrogen. Also, the fire is easy to contain. Teslas, for example, automatically contain the fire in a compartment so people can get out of the car easily. No one has died from a Tesla fire.   To you second point, both hydrogen and lithium is abundant enough to power a car for a reasonable amount of time, both on earth and in a car. The new Tesla gets 300 miles a charge, and it's only getting higher every year. The argument against hydrogen is that it's about 1/3 as efficient to use hydrogen to produce electricity for a car than just storing it in a battery.

It's also rather easy to turn parts of the gas into methane (by adding CO2), at which point you have about the same mix as what's already in the pipelines.  And pipeline networks are the important part, here: Germany can store, at operating pressures, six months of total(!) energy consumption in its existing pipeline network, according to Fraunhofer it's the best idea since the invention of the flywheel.  Round-trip efficiencies aren't particularly high, however, once you've got the gas you can store it practically indefinitely without incurring further losses. As such, that network makes a very, very, nice battery. Bonus: Frequency regulation is also currently done by gas plants, no changeover there. Hydrostorage is still better for short-term regulation because it's comparatively lossless, but gas can buffer a whole season full of energy.  At least in Germany's case the whole network is also designed to work with pure hydrogen, as that is what it started out with when the gas was still synthesised from coal, so we might switch back at some time (which requires replacing all the burners in every single stove and heater).  You can also turn it into liquid fuel, which might come into play as battery technology is nowhere near supporting Autobahn speeds at Autobahn distances, even a Tesla doesn't get far when you're driving 200km/h. And I'm not really comfortable having a hydrogen tank in my car. Trains, maybe, where you can afford the weight of metalhydrite storage, as well as ships."
science,3dq515,barsoap,7,Sat Jul 18 21:23:10 2015 UTC,"The limiting factor is not cost of cells, it's not infrastructure, it's not economies of scale.  The problem is that you lose so much energy in the conversion of electricity to hydrogen fuel that it's not worth it. If you're trying to generate hydrogen from zero-emission sources (so you can have a zero emission vehicle), you might as well just use wires and batteries. It's just a more efficient storage and transmission mechanism than hydrogen.  The math is a little different if you're generating it from natural gas. In that case, it might be theoretically possible to get it down to the cost of battery power, although right now it's still much more expensive even in the most efficient industrial situations.  But it kind of doesn't matter because if if you're generating hydrogen from natural gas, you are still releasing carbon into the atmosphere! Fuel cell travel powered off hydrogen from natural gas powered off releases less carbon than gasoline travel (40-65% less) but it's many times more carbon than, say, wind-power that you transmit through wires and store in batteries. And nanotubes won't help. That's just the C atom that you have to break off the H's that you get from natural gas. And it takes energy to break those bonds too."

You actually can't make hydrogen have as high of energy density power unit volume as gasoline. Not even half as high. That means you need to have a lot bigger tanks of it. Bigger tanks means it's harder to protect and more chance of failure, plus more weight that isn't fuel.   And hydrogen is so damn small that it can leak through solid steel, as well as most metals. It can actually diffuse through the crystal lattice and leak out. While doing this, something called Hydrogen embrittlement happens. This means the strength of the steel drops dramatically, and it shatters when it fails, rather than bends. This means you can't use metal for very long around hydrogen, or it will fail catastrophically.   Both of these are severe drawbacks of using hydrogen as a fuel."

science,3dq515,Svardskampe,6,Sat Jul 18 15:47:49 2015 UTC,Nanowires are incredibly difficult to scale up for production and can be extremely cost inhibitive. While the morphology has a greater surface area and allows for more effective hydrogen production it most likely wont be incorporated into current solar cell designs because much cheaper alternatives with slightly less conversion efficiency can be achieved. Source: I work in the fuel cell industry.
science,3dq515,hairyboobs69,3,Sat Jul 18 22:38:23 2015 UTC,They used nano-imprint lithography which in theory can be lots cheaper than say e-beam lithography but you can create regular periodic patterns also using polysterene lithography (which is essentially coating a substrate with little balls of plastic) which is extremely cheap comparatively to create the patterns for nanowires.
science,3dq515,thatwentwell,2,Sat Jul 18 14:18:44 2015 UTC,It's true that nano-imprint technology is cheaper but I'm not sure polystrene lithography could be used for an application such as this (It would interfere with electron transport and increase impedance of the material causing a decrease in voltage).
science,3dq515,hairyboobs69,6,Sat Jul 18 15:15:50 2015 UTC,"My PhD thesis was on electrochemistry and III-V semiconductors (such as GaP).  H2 production isn't the limiting process, it's O2 production. If you want to make H2 from water you also have to create O2. O2 production is by far the worst bottleneck. Without addressing the O2 production, improvements in H2 evolution are essentially meaningless."
science,3dq515,Hey_Smell_This,2,Sun Jul 19 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the O2 was briefly mentioned in the end of the article. It didn't seem like they gave too much care to that part despite probably realizing that O2 is the bottleneck."
science,3dq515,thatwentwell,3,Sun Jul 19 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"As (yet another) scientist working in the field, I'd be very careful about calling it a breakthrough. This sound like another attempt on solving the photo electrochemical water splitting issue (in a sense of direct photo electrolysis of water using semiconducting electrodes). First of all, GaP is not new material for this purpose, as it was extensively studied for these purposes in the 70' together wi a bunch of other materials (to give justice, nanostructuring is definitely a XXI century thing, so success lies mostly in boosting the efficiency). So far, all these materials suffer from one big issue, which is instability in water solutions. Electrolysis, driven by sunlight or not, still calls for pretty acidic/alkaline solutions, which are detrimental even for standard electrodes, not only semiconducting. Only TiO2 seems to be resistant to it, and even this one not because of the corrosion potential, but by the kinetics (extremely sluggish. I can recommend some articles by H.Gerischer once I'm on my PC). However TiO2 is so wide band gap it's only active in the UV, and attempts on doping usually make it prone to photo corrosion. As I recall, GaP is not stable, and I don't see here anything on its stability, especially long term."
science,3dq515,l00rker,2,Sat Jul 18 17:28:21 2015 UTC,Has anyone done any band engineering (not doping) like they use to make blue GaN led's?
science,3dq515,thatwentwell,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"At least for TiO2 plenty of concepts has been tested, with most promising imho being surface modifications, such as nanoparticles or other features of e.g. noble metals, or multilayers. None of these was sufficiently successful to be commercialized. This is the important part - industry is not going to put money in it unless it beats the existing technologies of hydrogen production by at least 50% (source: my colleagues from pv industry). Hydrogen from water electrolysis has the highest purity, but tends to be more expensive than the one from e.g. natural gas. Yet it is still more economical to hook up traditional PV (photovoltaic) system to ""normal"" elecrrolyser than use extremely sophisticated, unstable systems, due to costs of manufacturing and upscaling. Another thing is the electrodes itself. In a typical electrolyser you would have two electrodes, both of which were mastered for years to gain the highest efficiency and stability, including the overpotentials (for water electrolysis theorerically you need 1.23 V, in practice at least 1.7 V). Without these issues covered calling things a breakthrough is... well, a bit overstatement. In this field during the last 15 years I've seen at least 5 papers claiming breakthrough, none of them made it to the market."
science,3dq515,l00rker,10,Sat Jul 18 22:44:46 2015 UTC,"This immediately boosted the yield of hydrogen by a factor of ten to 2.9 percent.   Whereas commercial electrolysis units that run on electricity have an efficiency of 70%, and commercial solar cells have efficiencies of up to 21.7%, and cheap modules are about 15.9%.  Combining the panel and electrolysis unit we get a combined efficiency of 11.1-15.2%.  Doing research is always good, and combining the Hydrogen generation into a single device would be nice.  But these kind of press releases from the university where the research is done are for publicity value for the University and to help get more research money.  They always leave out a comparison to other commercial solutions, which in this case is 3.8 to 5.2 times higher efficiency.  They also leave out cost and production scale.  One gallium phosphide cell made in the lab is nothing like the scale of 57 GW of solar panels being made worldwide this year.  From a ""how does this affect my life"" or ""does this enable a clean Hydrogen economy"" the answer is ""not at all"", at least not yet."

What makes sense depends on the application you are using it for.    Big ships need their power source to be very portable and stupidly cheap.  So they run on heavy fuel oil, which is the leftovers after making the lighter products like gasoline and diesel.  That's really hard for solar of any kind to compete on."

A few nuclear ship accidents dumping more radioactives into sea water won't make a noticeable difference.  On the cost issue, for your comment to be true, you would have to show some data that fuel cost savings, and weight savings on the ship from [diesel engine + fuel mass]-[reactor mass] (which results in more cargo), outweigh the likely higher cost of a reactor vs a marine diesel engine of the same power level."

Then you have to consider that hydrogen is explosive (like, much more than batteries). It would be a lot easier/cheaper to put a solar array on your roof connected to a battery bank (Tesla's Powerwall comes to mind).  All hydrogen does is create a different means of storing energy that can be turned into electricity. So for a car, it could potentially make it ""charge"" faster, because the tank in your car would be used to create electricity and drive an electric motor. But then you're driving around with an explosive tank of hydrogen that's 1/3 as efficient as just charging your car's battery."

The same view can be taken of a lot of this research.

We usually assume the ratio of carbon in biomass is constant (that's not entirely true, but generally plants are somewhat fixed with this ratio).   So to make new organic carbon, you have to make more biomass (i.e. grow larger or more numerous).

And yes there were mass extinctions before, but always slowly enough that some species had time to adapt. There is no time for evolution at the rates we are destroying the climate.  Ice core records with very reliable temperature and CO2 data go back about a million years and show that CO2 levels bounced between 180 and 280 ppm and never came close to the 400 ppm we have today.

If you meant that they could replace benzodiazapene's, that would be great. Because they have a ton of side-effects from what i've heard."
science,3drapn,jazir5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:37 2015 UTC,"Benzodiazapenes bind to GABA receptors on calcium channels on the ends of neurons which are responsible for making you feel down, or slow. They are used to help stabilize yourself once you get too excited.     Allosteric, basically means that they bind to a part of the protein  which alters the function, in this case, calcium channel proteins, to increase calcium flow and activate the GABA neuron.   So the compounds are similar in shape to benzodiazapenes, but instead of increasing the calcium through the protein channels, it decreases, or turns off the calcium channels by altering their shape, and therefore decreases the ability of the neuron to fire.     Edit: These are chloride channels, not calcium. Sorry, read too many channel papers today."
science,3drapn,ihorse,2,Mon Jul 20 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Is that better for you somehow, to have less calcium flow or would that impact people negatively? I get the functionality of it now, but am still not able to understand the significance."

science,3dohwf,rocqua,3,Sat Jul 18 10:28:22 2015 UTC,IIRC the issue is that the shielding becomes radioactive from absorbing the neutrons.
science,3dohwf,MooingAssassin,2,Sat Jul 18 12:41:25 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Ok, so the problem is that this article makes it sound like having a less dense material is better than the same material that isn't foam. This isn't the case, since they aren't the same material. It makes it seem this way by comparing high-Z metal foam to normal stainless steel. The high-Z material is ""better"" at blocking radiation, but if you would have just manufactured non-foam (just solid) high-Z steel, it would perform even better than high-Z foam. Does that make sense?"
science,3dohwf,cretan_bull,3,Sat Jul 18 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's a problem, per se. Neutron radiation is one of the primary proposed means of extracting energy from a fusion reactor. For a terrestrial fusion reactor, you're not limited in weight in quite the same way as for spaceflight applications, so you can use as much lead shielding as is necessary. Then, presumably, this shielding would be cooled with some sort of working fluid to extract power. This particular piece of research keeps the areal density fixed, and shows that a metal foam can be more efficient than bulk materials by this metric. However, this is trading mass for volume, and shielding volume could actually be an important engineering parameter when designing a fusion reactor."

She then compared the material’s performance to the performance of bulk materials that are currently used in shielding applications. The comparison was made using samples of the same “areal” density – meaning that each sample had the same weight, but varied in volume.""

science,3dohwf,waveswan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"In that case your best option is boron-carbide particles dispersed in solid tungsten. The cross section for gamma absorption increases rapidly with atomic number, so even though tungsten is heavy, it is the lightest radiation shield because you dont need very much of it. Boron-carbide is probably the best neutron absorber that is still practical (Cryogenic Helium-3 would also be very effective, but ridiculously expensive and impractical ). If tungsten is too expensive Uranium is a good alternative (its own radiation is easy to shield against). Lead is a cheap alternative but is less effective than tungsten.  Concrete made from Iron-ore is a good choice when space and weight is less of an issue, since it doubles as a sturdy structural material. Water is a good choice if cooling is also required, as is the case with nuclear waste, but it is poor at blocking gamma rays, so you either need several meters of it or additional shielding.  Finally, Plastic can be useful to block cosmic rays for space applications. Using a heavy material in such situations can produce X-rays as the particles collide with nuclei. This is not a problem if you have additional shielding, but a satellite or spacecraft may not be able to support the weight of additional shielding."

I'm not trying to make excuses, I'm just trying to point out that these things weren't as much of a factor as they are now.  My parents grew up in the country where a lot of the food they ate came straight from the farm or garden.  They were exposed to limited processed food.  While I was growing up our meals were similar in that it was stuff that my mother knew how to cook because she grew up eating it.  But I look at some of my friends and their parents replaced homemade meals with something from McDonalds.  And what they weren't realizing is that while they could eat things like fast food in moderation easily, their children couldn't.  Growing up one of my cousins would cry if she didn't get McDonald's for dinner because it's what she wanted more than anything else.  What I'm getting at is a lot of the issues we're dealing with now were things that came after their generation established their norms, but that's not the case for the current generation.  Things like using a cell phone while driving (where the older generation knew how to drive before using a cell phone the current generation knows how to use a cell phone before they know how to drive), nutrition, predatory lending, all those things have changed significantly in such a short amount of time.  The older generation doesn't know how to teach things correctly because they didn't have the same adoption.  They don't realize that the things that make it common sense to their generation haven't been instilled yet because there's much earlier adoption."

Not all of us are stuck with our heads in the clouds while we raise special little snowflakes. In our family the problem that we've encountered isn't that their is no health classes in schools. It's that there is one. My kiddo brought home no pamphlets or resources for more information after their health segment in elementary school. Kiddo did bring a thick booklet, kids themed and drawn book, resources, pamphlets magnets and stickers after the drug awareness segment. In my opinion and experience it's not that their isn't a health, gym and nutrition requirement and program in schools. It's that it's sadly outdated. There's not nearly as much information shared with parent's. There's teachers who can only teach what they are provided. Bringing in a health professional, a registered dietitian an RN, anyone who has more formal training would be vastly more helpful to the children and teens in conjunction with resources sent home to the parents. All that said, it's not the schools job to teach our kids these things. It's ours, as parents. Working as a team educating our kids, medical professionals, schools and parents is beneficial.

Naturally, I received a lot of agreement and disagreement.  Fact is, beauty is something people can ignore if they want to, and shouldn't feel bad about it. Not only can we live our lives alone of we want to, but love is not always about beauty and people always find more reasons to love someone beyond looks.  The difference is that if you love that person, or yourself, you should want them to be healthy. Health is life, and without it we live shorter and more painful lives. That is what we should be teaching children. Yes, the media's image of beauty is wrong, but you're right, that's completely confusing and fogging the real issue: obesity is unhealthy and that's wrong.

There's a ton of ways to encourage healthy lifestyles; make unhealthy food more expensive and less available, make healthy food cheaper and more available, limit messages that encourage people to eat badly and encourage messages that make healthy food more attractive, provide healthy activity options for more children (which is hugely influenced by schools - No Child Left Behind led to a lot of schools cancelling recess to get more preparation time for testing - which almost certainly is making these problems worse).

Yes, it's a serious problem that healthy food is less accessible than junk food, but the problem isn't that junk food is too affordable, it's that healthy food is to too expensive.

I shouldn't have said we would have to artificially inflate it, but the fact still remains, artificially deflating the price of unhealthy foods allows many people who can't eat healthfully to at least fill their bellies, who otherwise wouldn't be able to do either.  I would trade subsidization of unhealthy food to subsidize healthy food, if it were possible to prevent hunger from increasing overall.  This might prove to be politically unfeasible however - my understanding is that the food we subsidize tends to be subsidized because they're cash crops that we can export, and in turn raise public revenue from. The fact that this makes the prices of these foods cheaper for the general public, regardless of its affect on our health, is only a secondary side-effect that doesn't really play into the decision as to whether the food is subsidized or not.  I'm sure I could be wrong, and I'd love to see a better solution either way."

Like obesity, everyone already knows that cancer is bad, you don't really need to emphasize that.

Instead, it will be a very, very slow death where property will slowly have to be abandoned over the course of generations until eventually entire towns no longer exist (at least where they once did).   At least human catastrophe sends a message. The problem with climate change is that deniers can continue to deny because the average person can't easily wrap their head around the more complicated nuances of climate science.   Then there's the fact that hollywood only hurt us on communicating that with movies like The Day After Tomorrow - where they set this expectation that climate change will be this huge, dramatic effect that will run its course over the length of a few months."
science,3dm6qq,night-shark,44,Fri Jul 17 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will be slow per se..  Th global rise will be slow, but the tipping point for local catastrophe could be pretty rapid.  For instance, the area of the Netherlands at flood risk is protected from being reclaimed by the sea by lots of artificially constructed dykes like this one.  If the sea level rises slowly, it may be easy to predict when the sea level will just go over that dyke and flood everything behind it. There may be time to raise the dyke and save all that land..  However, it isn't easy to predict the weather. An unusually strong storm could come along and because the sea level rise reduced the amount of extra tolerance height available at the sea defenses for dealing with storm surges, a rare storm could cause seas to rise over the barrier and cause a pretty terrible flood.  The global sea-level rise will be slow, but the sudden extra rise caused by weather events will be what tips the balance to cause catastrophe.  The sea isn't just going to rise a meter one night and stay there, but the egress of the sea into land is going to be characterized by a series of sudden floods coinciding with freak weather events. It's not just going to be a slow creep of water.   If a country is on their toes, they'll make sure that the sea defenses are upgraded at to cope with the pace of sea-level rise, but normally catastrophe has to happen first to kick politicians out of complacency and get them to part with government money.

El Nino Southern Oscillation is a multi year cycle that actually 'occurs' in the equatorial Pacific. Right now, we are in El Nino, the warm phase. So, the waters off the west coast of equatorial South America are a few degrees warmer than usual (this is caused by a breakdown in the trade winds). El Nino has a much larger effect on the weather than climate change does, but it is not a permanent thing and cycles on and off over the period of a few years. So, El Nino is known to shift weather patterns but does not last forever. Climate change is still the biggest concern as it can act to enhance some of El Nino's more dangerous features.

science,3dm6qq,BreadstickNinja,70,Fri Jul 17 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Even by the mid-1800s, there were substantial meteorological readings from other parts of the globe due to European colonization, with coverage including what is now Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The authors of the NASA reports did a statistical analysis based on global coverage and empirically demonstrated ability to estimate temperatures with a high degree of confidence for different geographic regions, and found that global coverage was sufficient to estimate global temperatures meaningfully by about 1880. The confidence rapidly increases over the next two decades to a very high degree of confidence by the turn of the 20th century.  So they're not just taking the average of a bunch of stations in North America and Europe. The temperature anomaly that they calculate from the historical record takes into account the location and coverage of different meteorological stations and the confidence of temperature inferences that can be made from their collective readings. It's also worth mentioning that the instrumental record shows strong agreement with other temperature proxies such as dendrochronological data over that time period."

science,3dm6qq,Rohaq,65,Fri Jul 17 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"Ice core samples taken from both Greenland and Antarctica act as proxies for global ocean temperatures based on something called the oxygen isotope ratio cycle. Differences in temperature result in different rates of evaporation for water containing different oxygen isotopes, so the records that are preserved in the ice cores actually reflect the temperature conditions across broad swaths of ocean where evaporation was occurring, rather than local conditions where the ice cores were formed.  We also can corroborate those temperature reconstructions with other data sources, such as the ratio of different types of benthic foraminafera, microscopic creatures that are fossilized in the ocean floor and for which we know the range and temperature tolerance for different species.  On these timescales, we're looking at changes in global average temperatures of several degrees, rather than fractions of a degree.

science,3dm6qq,Senor_Tucan,72,Fri Jul 17 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"Geologist here, this is not entirely correct. Your comment can be interpreted to mean that historic CO2 levels were higher than present-day levels exactly 800,000 years ago and beyond. This is not the case.  Ice core records with very reliable temperature and CO2 data go back about a million years and show that CO2 levels bounced between 180 and 280 ppm and never came close to the 400 ppm we have today.  If you want to go back further in time, there is no more ice core data and the reliability very suddenly drops to almost zero. There are only a handful of studies trying to recreate historic CO2 levels in a 1-30 Ma timeframe from a variety of proxies, mainly by temperature, sediments and plant fossil data. Their conclusions vary wildly. Even CO2 data from only 2 million years ago might be off by a factor of 3 from one study to the next.  Using the best available data and very broad estimates, I would say with about 80% confidence that historic CO2 was never above 400 ppm until some point in time 5 to 25 million years ago."

Thankfully the BAMS report actually gives the error-estimate for the global average temperature for several independent measures: NASA/GISS: +/- 0.05 C HadCRUT4: +/- 0.09 C NOAA:  +/- 0.09 C JMA: +/- 0.13 C    Sidebar 2.1 actually addresses the uncertainty in the measurement and says the following:     Using the “independent” Monte Carlo approach described by Arguez et al. (2013), there is a 48% probability that 2014 was the warmest year and a 90% probability that 2014 was among the five warmest years from 1880–2014 (Fig. SB2.1a).     I would hardly say that this report confirms that 2014 was the warmest year on record, but rather that the measurements imply with 48% certainty that 2014 was the warmest year on record, and with 90% certainty that the warmest year has appeared in the range of 2010-2014 2014 is in the top-5 warmest years on record.    I think this is the more relevant part of the story:     Furthermore, it is very likely  (94% probability) that the 15 warmest years all occurred since 1997, and virtually certain (>99% probability) that the 5 warmest and 10 warmest years all occurred since 1997. Thus, while we cannot conclusively claim that 2014 was the warmest year in the real world when uncertainty is factored in, the 48% probability does not imply that 2014 was anything other than a very warm year, and it certainly does not cast doubt on the unprecedented warmth over the last 20 years.     This is an important point, since climate change deniers have a tendency to worship the 97/98 El Nino for giving them an opportunity to say ""no warming for last X years"", by hiding the warming signal behind a blockbuster El Nino event.  This analysis shows that the warmest years, to very high probability (94-99%), have occurred since their beloved El Nino."

We can model the system with and without the impact of anthropogenic activity. In the absence of human land use and pollution, we should have seen a small decline in temperatures since mid-century, and over the past couple thousand years, we would have seen slowly declining temperatures due to the influence of orbital variations (i.e. Milankovitch cycles).    Could it be possible that we're leaving a primordial Ice Age, and Human pollution is exacerbating the problems? Or is Global Warming purely caused by Humans?   Natural climatic change caused us to begin to melt out of the last ""ice age"" (the Last Glacial Maximum), ~19-26,000 years ago (depending on latitude). This natural warming reached its peak around 7,000 years ago, during the mid-Holocene warm period. Since that point, natural climatic forces should have been causing us to cool slowly over the past couple of thousand years.   In addition to knowing what natural drivers of climate change have been doing, we understand the physics of radiative forcing, which tell us that adding GHGs to the atmosphere will not just cause us to warm, but it will cause us to warm in a way that is very different from natural drivers of warming. Specifically, enhanced greenhouse warming will warm the surface and the lower atmosphere, but cool the upper atmosphere. We can observe this occurring.

science,3doizh,psioni,28,Sat Jul 18 09:38:27 2015 UTC,"Why would a more complex society have more of a need for kissing?     My guess: passionate kissing is a close analogy to intercourse that you can do quite effortlessly even in some public places if you are being polite. Complex societies have much more strict views about intercourse in that it is to be done out of the view of everyone else and in private and especially out of the view of children. Whereas in much simpler societies intercourse is viewed much more casually and often can happen in full view of everyone else (even children) and sometimes even as tradition in front of the family of the virgin woman being impregnated for the first time.    So when intercourse becomes a very private secluded thing, something takes its place."
science,3doizh,DiogenesHoSinopeus,8,Sat Jul 18 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"The fact that with Inuit tribes sexual intercourse is also a taboo and that they have ""nose rubbing"" instead of kissing seems to suggest otherwise.   It simply seems that kissing isn't born out of an instinct (if it was, kissing would be universal across cultural boundaries) and instead simply something that spread across a certain group of cultures purely by chance. And after centuries of ingraining that status, it has become sort of a Pawlow-esque Pavlov-esque reflex to assume the meaning behind kissing. The question is, if we could hypothetically replace kissing with say cheek-licking (as crazy as that sounds; it is just an example) and train humans to see it that way over a few hundred years, whether they would adopt cheek-licking the same way as we have kissing...  Edit: Now with 100% more correct English romanisation."

Trapping those Carbon atoms in the Iron's crystal matrix is how you force the formation of Martinsite, an elongated tetragonal form of the naturally cubic Iron crystals. That distortion creates internal stresses in the crystal structure which makes the material harder, reducing its Toughness, or ability to deform before breaking, while increasing its Strength, or the maximum amount of force it can resist.

I understand the perspective is that condensed matter systems often experience ""emergent"" phenomena, such as quasiparticles, and that these emergent properties...can't be viewed from a reductionist's perspective.  Why would that be the case here? Or ever? As I see it, particle and condensed matter physicists both work with field theory and the kinds of symmetry breaking implied there; ascribing physical attributes to a quark, or even a proton, in a particle field theory, is equally ""reductionist"" as ascribing physical properties to a quasiparticle in a condensed matter field theory. In essence, they both boil down to particle creation/annihilation operators.  I just don't get it. It seems like a trivial argument to hold on either side. Reductionism only applies if you suppose that some quanta exist physically (are measurable???) whereas others can only be seen via extrapolation (quarkonium anyone?).

Similarly, I'm sure we physicists frequently piss off scientists of other fields like biology since ""physics is more fundamental; all biology is because of physics"". But it's important to set up higher-level, abstract understandings of fields that may be entirely invested in emergent phenomena because it's impractical to describe everything in terms of fundamentals. To tie in yet another field, it's like if a computer scientist were determined to only write in Assembly when he could easily write most programs in C.

And there's certainly some truth in that, from one perspective. We know about small things and we know about big things and things in between, so in some sense only the even smaller or even bigger are new regimes of study. Anything in between can be, in principle, ""reduced"" to the standard model; so why study anything but the standard model (and beyond)?  That's the kind of reductionism I would take offense with. Because even ""in principle"", given reasonable constraints on the computing power of the universe, you can't just explain middle-sized systems in terms of the standard model. There is stuff there that you simply can't see from that perspective. OP's remark that ""It may be useful, but it isn't standard model breaking stuff"" seems to take that perspective, that condensed matter is just sort of applied physics or engineering; it's not real physics if it isn't about fundamental particles.

That ""emergent behavior is not fundamental behavior""? I mean, I guess, but that's still a pretty lame perspective.

science,3dkubx,buddhabuck,5,Fri Jul 17 12:04:41 2015 UTC,"That's basically it. Being massless isn't just a property of Weyl fermions, it's pretty much the definition. These terms come from the Dirac equation, which is what's used to describe spin-1/2 particles. The Dirac equation can be represented in a variety of equivalent mathematical forms. The three most common ways, because of certain nice properties they have, are called the Dirac representation, the Majorana (""My-your-anna"") representation, and the Weyl (""Vile"") representation. They are all mathematically equivalent, but each is especially suited to fermions with particular properties. The Dirac representation is good for general, massive spin-1/2 particles with distinct anti-particle partners, so we call such particles (which all known elementary fermions are examples of) ""Dirac fermions"". The Dirac equation also allows solutions of particles that are their own anti-particle (like photons, which are spin-1 bosons, are). The Majorana representation of the equation is especially convenient for studying these, so they're called Majorana fermions. There is strong evidence that Majorana fermions can (with a few wrinkles I'm not going to mention) emerge as quasiparticles in certain condensed matter systems. The Weyl representation is most useful for massless solutions, and so massless spin-1/2 particles are called Weyl fermions. It was originally thought that neutrinos were Weyl fermions, but now we know they have a small but non-zero mass and (as anti-neutrinos are distinct, also) are Dirac fermions. However, this paper is (according to it, and to my own knowledge) the first evidence that Weyl fermions can emerge as quasiparticles like Majorana fermions."

They did some calculations and looked at them from the right perspective and it looked like there appeared some massless fermions in the equations.  Then they did some experiments and who'd have thought: the system also behaved like it contained massless fermions.  I don't really know about the particulars of this case, but most quasiparticle-interpretations only hold for certain parameter ranges. So this is not really a weyl fermion but in the experiments they made, it looked like one."

This can be solved by having relay satellites around the planet that gathers the data from the weatherstations and then sends it off to Earth with their bigger antennas. Cube sats usually don't come with large antennas. Also as Anya said, seismometry with widely distributed measurement stations would be a big advancement for the geologists.

They would be very slidy, because the board would sublimate thin layer of ice and basically ride on the gas ""pillow""."

science,3dm6pv,Shrekmightyogrelord,12,Fri Jul 17 17:32:39 2015 UTC,Why are the North and South poles so different?  It makes sense on Earth due to one being over land surround by water and the other being over water surrounded by land.  But what leads to such a difference on Mars?
science,3dm6pv,nukedetectorCA94612,3,Fri Jul 17 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"Anya: First, martian poles are very different in elevation. North is on average 5 km lower than the South. This means different pressures and consequently different conditions for phase changes of water and carbon dioxide. Second, martian seasons in south and north are different. Southern summer is much hotter and southern winter is colder than northern. So, the poles, like on Earth, develop differently but for different to Earth reasons."

science,3dm6pv,mthirteen,9,Fri Jul 17 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"It's been discussed that plate tectonics has been one of the primary driving factors in evolution of life here on Earth. Without it, do you think Mars or other planets are able to evolve and sustain life?"
science,3dm6pv,nvincent,3,Fri Jul 17 12:26:59 2015 UTC,"I responded to a similar question in another thread (here), so I'll just copy & paste my comment here for you in hopes that it will provide you with further insight:   It's somewhat two fold. Firstly, you need water for plate tectonics, and water also acts as a medium in which to transport elements. Plate tectonics themselves are not necessary for life to develop; for example, life on Earth began prior to 3.5 billion years ago while the onset of plate tectonics occurred roughly 3 billion years ago. However, while plate tectonics is not necessary for life, it certainly assists in the evolution of life. A contributing factor to the rising and falling (transgression / regression) sea levels relates to mid ocean spreading ridges. During times of relatively faster sea floor spreading rates, sea levels rise (and fall during times of slower sea floor spreading rates), and the oceans become dominated by a clacite chemistry (calcite - aragonite seas). You can start to see how rising and falling sea levels, along with changing ocean chemistry would act to generate adaptive pressures for lifeforms to evolve under on long timescales. While we're at it, let's not forget that it promotes diversification as the plates move, continents accrete forming supercontinents (Pangea, for example), and pulling landmasses apart generating more shallow seas which in turn creates more room for life (carbonate reefs, etc). More importantly; however, plate tectonics allows you to replenish the supply of elements to a number of systems on much faster timescales, and on global scale - as opposed to slower rates, and localized events that would be typical of a body in which there was tectonism, but no plate tectonics (all bodies have tectonics, including our [moon](watch?v=zDmEnjwAYIY), but only Earth is known to have plate tectonics). Plate tectonics also acts as a global thermostat (think CO2 draw down and the carbon cycle - silicate weathering, etc.).   TL;DR: Plate tectonics is not necessary for life, but helps promote it through diversification, providing adaptive pressure (changes in ocean chemistry, etc.), acting as a global thermostat, and rejuvenating the supply of elements required by life.   EDIT: Though debated, there are theories that support plate tectonics on Mars not only early on in its geological past1, 2, but currently as well3 ."
science,3dm6pv,carljoseph,3,Fri Jul 17 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"Anya: Just to add to the other answer: there was a recent news about Curiosity discovering a rock from Martian's continental crust. Maybe, if it had that, it also had tectonics."

science,3dm6pv,MyNameIsJules,5,Fri Jul 17 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"Meg - One of the things that would be important for a Mars mission is understanding the Martian weather. Just like on Earth, computer models are used to predict what it will be like and what the whether it will rain and how hot it will be. The same is used on Mars. Most of these global climate models have their origins in the global Earth climate models, adapted to add the different physics that occurs in Mars atmosphere in addition to composition and thickness changes. Unlike Earth we don't have many wind measurements of the surface. The surface is the boundary level of the atmosphere, and our project can help provide ground truth. Both in wind direction and strength. The directions of the wind is the direction of the fans we think (especially since we know that the fans follow topography from regions where we have stereoimaging and were we see channels and hills in the images). Also the length of the fans tells us the strength of the wind, since we have a rough idea of particle size. So we get wind direction and strength at the surface we can compare and check and use as input into these global climate models to validate and improve them which would be important for getting them right. There lots of physics that goes on including how dust in the atmosphere  interacts and heats  that modelers don't have to deal with in the Earth atmosphere."
science,3dm6pv,drones4thepoor,3,Fri Jul 17 17:53:01 2015 UTC,"Michael: Excellent question, as it targets precisely the science goals of Planet Four.   First, when we have mapped everything, and converted the data into measures of seasonal activity and wind directions, there is several lines of science that we will approach. For the wind directions we have won a proposal this year that starts in August (yeehaw) and we collaborate with the atmosphere modeler Tim Michaels to see when and where the derived wind directions match or don't match with the current predictions of modeled climate of Mars. Where it doesn't match, we (I mean he ;) will try to update the parameters of the modeling trying to reproduce the observed wind directions. The modeling business is a very open parameter space business, in other words, it all depends on with which values the simulation starts to run, as we mostly don't have any measurements to put in for the start (hence my above request for cube-sat based weather stations on Mars). Because of the non-constant observations of the HiRISE camera (all data for PlanetFour.org comes from this camera), we have to do this very carefully though, as we can't exclude changes of wind directions in between different HiRISE observations. The modeling of local topography and its effect on the local winds will teach us how variable it is for this location.  For the amount of activity itself there are several open questions that we hope to be able to address with the PlanetFour data set. Basically, we will have a data set that can tell us when where how much activity is going on. We have already noticed that some areas are active at different times, and the PlanetFour data allows us to study this more systematically. Some areas around the pole are also not at all active even so they are covered with CO2 ice as well, we don't understand that yet."
science,3dm6pv,sovereignwill,5,Fri Jul 17 18:32:55 2015 UTC,What advice would you give to someone in the middle of their physics and geology undergrad looking to be involved in your line of work?
science,3dm6pv,carljoseph,3,Fri Jul 17 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Michael: There's never just one road. Keep your eyes open for opportunities, but here some general ideas:   When done with undergrad, for your PhD course change to university that has known ties to planetary science and missions, like UCLA, Brown, APL, UoA (Tucson), Boulder (CO). Or do the swap later during postdoc, NASA/JPL offers postdoc program. If you want to work on space missions, don't focus only on physics, also keep your tech skills and interest high enough to know how a spacecraft and remote sensing instrument work in general. In fact, the more theoretically based physics jobs around space missions are indeed more rare than the more engineering based jobs for it. So if you want higher chances to work in it, maybe visit a space engineering class as well. Never forget programming skills. The amount of data only gets more and more every day. And if you want to be future proof, learn Python, because that is very welcome in industry and much more known that IDL or other more pure science based programming languages. And astronomers now predominantly use Python already, as recent polls have shown. Do undergrad summer jobs for space mission data analysis. This is an excellent way to get 'into it'. Here at LASP we offer summer student interns, and in fact, we most likely will be hiring a summer student in summer 2016 to work on Planet Four data! hint, hint"

One should find out at your local university if they do hire summer students for some work. Here in Boulder you would just email the people that are on the institute's webpage to ask if they do hire summer students. Usually if one of us gets an email like that, there will be a round email to ask if anybody is in the need for one."

It is believed that bacteria can survive deep inside rock slits for thousands of years, brought to the surface by later geological processes. I would say that it's at least not impossible to have deeper down inside the Martian surfaces traces of previous life, considering that the atmosphere at least for some time was rather hospitable."

science,3dm6pv,kudorox,2,Fri Jul 17 12:21:04 2015 UTC,"Michael: One of current setbacks were mostly that we are not being paid for analyzing the data, which changes starting from August. The way it works in general that one has to combine all the citizens data into one answer (a process called clustering), so that we can create catalogs of fans and blotches found. I have finished that part and am currently working on combining the resulting fan and blotch data into one measure, which is necessary, because some citizens might think that something looks like a fan while others see it as a blotch. I need to combine these into a value that indicates to us later in the analysis how 'reliable' a wind direction is. If it shows a high 'blotchiness' value, we would not trust it so much, even so some might have thought they see a fan with a direction. Also the statistics within a PlanetFour tile gives a good indication of the prevalent wind direction. If there were 10 fans within one image tile, and all point to the same wind direction, it's a very safe assumption that this direction is true. If they are all different, then we would need to have a look manually, what is going on with that image.  In general, citizen science benefits from the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect, that is also described nicely by the following example: Image a glass bottles with peas inside, and you ask thousand people how many peas are inside. As the peas are so many in numbers, it's basically impossible for one person to be near the real value. But ask many people, and amazingly, due to the wonderful math of Gauss, the mean value of the result is amazingly close to the real value. This was also nicely shown in the BBC program The story of Math, episode 2 IIRC. In the same way, when 30 people mark the fan position and direction, the mean value of those are amazingly close to reality and very useful to science, after some post-processing and clustering, with the latter being able to reliable filter out outliers that have nothing in common with other markings."

Anderson AS1, Haynie KR, McMillan RP, Osterberg KL, Boutagy NE, Frisard MI, Davy BM, Davy KP, Hulver MW. Author information  Abstract OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to understand the metabolic adaptations to a short-term (5 days), isocaloric, high-fat diet (HFD) in healthy, young males. METHODS: Two studies were undertaken with 12 subjects. Study 1 investigated the effect of the HFD on skeletal muscle substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Study 2 assessed the metabolic and transcriptional responses in skeletal muscle to the transition from a fasted to fed state using a high-fat meal challenge before and after 5 days of the HFD. RESULTS: Study 1 showed no effect of a HFD on skeletal muscle metabolism or insulin sensitivity in fasting samples. Study 2 showed that a HFD elicits significant increases in fasting serum endotoxin and disrupts the normal postprandial excursions of serum endotoxin, as well as metabolic and transcriptional responses in skeletal muscle. These effects after 5 days of the HFD were accompanied by an altered fasting and postprandial response in the ratio of phosphorylated- to total-p38 protein. These changes all occurred in the absence of alterations in insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence for early biological adaptations to high-fat feeding that proceed and possibly lead to insulin resistance."
science,3dqlpo,GWtech,3,Sat Jul 18 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"I've only read the abstract so not 100% sure on the methodology but there's nothing groundbreaking or novel from their results and conclusions here:   Healthy men were given a high fat diet with the same number of calories as a ""normal"" diet. Study 1 showed that after 5 days of being on the high fat diet no changes in insulin sensitivity or metabolism (not sure exactly what they measured) occurred. If you just took this at face value (ignoring the short treatment time etc.) you might think that a high fat diet has no effects on those markers. Study 2 shows that changes are occurring at the molecular level (study 1 is more of a whole tissue measure). In general they are saying that markers of inflammation (endotoxin) increase (which is thought to contribute to diabetes onset and progression). P38 is a kinase (a protein that can phosphorylate and change the behaviour of other proteins) and is involved in many process including insulin resistance, glucose uptake and can be activated in response to inflammation. The phosphorylation (a marker of its activity) of p38 is altered with the high fat diet and may contribute to the metabolic and transcript (gene expression changes) changes. Overall the study is saying that molecular events that lead to impaired insulin sensitivity and/or insulin resistance are started with 5 days of the high fat diet but it's not enough time for it to manifest into actual insulin resistance."

science,3dnhqi,WalterWhitesLeftNut,4,Sat Jul 18 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from my Astronomy lectures, white dwarfs are collapsed (i.e. post super-nova) stars, where a large fraction of the material that made up the sun falls into itself due to there being no more light pressure created internally.  Densitiy wise, I dont remember numbers but: its the mass of our sun - but the size of planet Earth. The surface is a crystal at the limit of electron pressure - i.e. the densitiy is not so high that the gravity would squeeze out the electrons (making a neutron start or black hole) so the atoms are still intact.  From memory - what would be happening here when a white dwarf eats a star, is that the matter accretes on the surface of the white dwarf crystal, and continuously undergoes fission (mini nuclear bombs) as it builds up - creating detectable flashes which would confirm what sort of star system this is."

science,3dnhqi,Lurker_IV,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:25:47 2015 UTC,Yep so what I was saying was: Stars go super nova right when they start to fuse Iron. Fusing Iron takes more energy than it create - thus no more light is created - thus all the matter in the start falls onto itself since there is not more light literally pushing it out.  When a white dwarf cools over the course of many billions of years (theorised to be more than the current age of the universe) it is thought to become a black dwarf - though none have been observed (since they are cold) and none are expected to exist yet since white dwarf cool so slowly.

science,3di2d2,superbad,215,Thu Jul 16 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Having bird-like traits does not necessarily make something a bird. This fossil demonstrates that there was definitely a feathered dinosaur with some sort of wings. While you could definitely draw an evolutionary line between this specimen and modern birds, the specimen in question isn't necessarily a bird.  From the Wikipedia page on birds:   Birds (class Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton.   Basically, by my understanding, all birds have feathers and wings but not all feathered and winged creatures are birds."
science,3di2d2,slimindie,34,Thu Jul 16 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"So we have teeth in what may or may not be a beak (I'm not smart enough to know), potentially soft-shelled eggs, and maybe the heart as differences that would disqualify this from a bird? I wonder how much of the above is known of other dinosaurs."
science,3di2d2,jjness,56,Thu Jul 16 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"There would just be a number of skeletal features that are somewhat obvious to a paleontologist that distinguish Dromeosaurs (raptors) from birds that would be slightly more difficult to explain.  Lots of ancient birds has teeth, and long tails, so that wouldn't really work. The skeletons are actually much more similar than you would think:  http://personal.kyoht.com/Tutorial/Raptor/deinonarch.gif  If you imagined the above one with teeth, the other differences mostly come down to proportions of various bones, and no real obvious striking differences; this becomes very difficult when there are only fragmentary remains available."
science,3di2d2,Zillatamer,14,Thu Jul 16 20:05:35 2015 UTC,Would bone density be a sign too? Or did ancient birds not have as light a skeleton?
science,3di2d2,ImaginarySpider,60,Thu Jul 16 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Dinosaurs for the most part had fairly light skeletons, even the very biggest of them:  http://www.livescience.com/27376-how-dinosaurs-grew-longest-necks.html  Hollow bones are found in most dinosaurs, and this reduces the weight of the bones to such a point where they can grow 10+ meter necks and hold them aloft with fairly minimal neck musculature, and also applies to the weight of their limbs.  Hollow bones predate birds and flight in dinosaurs, so no, that can't be used either.  All of this together is why the distinction of avian and non-avian dinosaur are really only used to talk about past vs. present for the most part, and not so much for distinguishing birds from other dinosaurs. The distinguishing traits are almost non existent when you compare multiple groups of dinosaurs to each other, and then birds to their closest relatives; T.rex is much closer to all birds than it is to Triceratops."

science,3di2d2,ImaginarySpider,25,Thu Jul 16 22:27:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Off the top of my head, I don't think any mammal has hollow bones, not even bats.  http://www.researchgate.net/publication/229054704_A_comparison_of_the_bone_density_and_morphology_of_giraffe_(Giraffa_camelopardalis)_and_buffalo_(Syncerus_caffer)_skeletons  According to this abstract of a paper that I found from googling giraffe bone density, their bones aren't less dense in the conventional sense either.  It's worth noting that long necks in mammals are very rare, and fairly constrained by factors that do not apply to dinosaurs.  I don't think hollow bones are very easy/simple to evolve in any case, so it's unlikely to independently evolve in mammals for one. Secondly, almost all mammals seem to only ever have seven neck vertebrae, and this has something to do with Hox genes and developmental biology that I don't know enough about to explain, beyond the fact that it doesn't seem to be a limitation shared by dinosaurs, as species can have very few or very many neck vertebra, going all the way to the high 30s I think. Building a 50 foot neck out of 7 bones would be challenging to say the least."

The article didn't go into a lot of detail but apparently mammals can't have much longer necks but, because dinosaurs breath like birds, the dinosaurs can.   I also found out sloths are the only land mammal that doesn't have exactly 7 neck vertebrae. My favorite quote was, ""Sauropod heads are essentially all mouth.

After I made that last post there I actually decided to read up on it again, as I had mostly forgotten how this worked, if I ever knew.  Basically the vertebrae count thing goes like this; there are certain genes present in all animals with symmetry called Hox genes. These genes control basically everything about the growth and organisation of tissues, like muscle, nerve and vessel pathways, as well as bone shape and number. Alterations or duplications of Hox genes are for the most part very simple mutations that can occur at random over the lifetime of a species over millions of years. mutations in Hox genes can cause deletions, fusions, or duplication of modular body parts. In vertebrates this would be our vertebrae; think of them as mostly simple repeating structures, so easy to reproduce that a single mutation could add one more identical vertebrae, or delete one, and in most reptiles/birds, mutations of these Hox genes probably have this effect with minimal side effects.   It seems that in mammals Hox genes associated with vertebrae are tied to multiple functions, meaning that a mutation that adds/deletes vertebrae is more likely to fuck up something else, or cause cancer, making that animal less likely to reproduce. It's also worth noting that mammals typically get cancer more frequently than other vertebrates, so the corresponding reptile with a similar mutation wouldn't be much less likely to breed.  The number of vertebrae in reptiles can vary from species to species (within a genus, so very closely related animals), and certain dinosaurs actually show the fusion of vertebrae over their developmental cycle; chicken embryos have 16 tail vertebrae at one point in development, but some sauropods actually fuse neck vertebrae from infancy to adulthood.   In that sense, they're much more plastic animals than we are."

Pterosaurs and possibly orthniscian dinosaurs have these basic bristles.  In therapods, fuzzy bristles begin to adapt to special purposes - display, lift, steering, eventually gliding and flight.

science,3di2d2,Thobewill,70,Thu Jul 16 19:54:42 2015 UTC,Emily Willoughby's paleoart is usually like that.  She really makes some of the most believable dinosaur illustrations given what we've been learning recently.
science,3di2d2,artifex0,34,Thu Jul 16 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. Her illustration of a Deinonychus, which is the dinosaur the Velociraptors in the Jurassic Park movies are based on, shows the difference between pop culture and modern understanding of these animals. It also shows a very birdlike posture and the tucked wings the original commentor was looking for.  She has this to say about the wings/arms (emphasis added):    This was largely inspired by an interesting Facebook discussion with paleoartist Julius Csotonyi about arm-folding in paravian dinosaurs. It occurred to me that people seldom reconstruct paravians, particularly dromaeosaurs, with their arms folded in a reasonable and accurate way. Julius made the fair the point that these animals probably didn't carry their arms out in front of the body, as is so often depicted (in skeletals and otherwise — it makes sense in skeletals, to adequately show the hand and arm anatomy), because such an awkward orientation would leave the hand and arm feathers open to damage and breakage. But they also can't fold them tightly against the breast or back like birds do, because they lack the mobility to do so.  So how did Deinonychus normally carry its arms? Senter's 2006 paper on forelimb function in Deinonychus and Bambiraptor shows that the humerus couldn't rotate much past the horizontal with respect to the scapula. In addition, Sullivan et al. 2010 — winningly translated to layman coherency by Matt Martyniuk — shows that wrist mobility in many paravians is much less than you might expect, given their similarity to birds. The wrist of Deinonychus antirrhopus specifically would not have allowed it to bend its hands even 90° with respect to the arm!  Given these limitations, most of the flexion would have to occur at the elbow, but a fully flexed elbow would mean that the hands would be hanging below the body, not held sleek and secure alongside the body. The arm orientation in my illustration above is based on what I think is probably the perfect configuration for carrying the arms: a fully-flexed shoulder, a fully-flexed wrist, and a nearly fully-extended elbow. A few other people have drawn their dromaeosaurs with the same arm configuration, like Smnt2000 and Pilsator, so kudos to them.   http://emilywilloughby.com/gallery/paleoart/the-terrible-claw"

I don't know how much we know about dinosaurs in this regard, but modern birds are endothermic and the primary function of their feathers isn't flight, it's body heat retention and dissipation.  For these dinosaurs, living on a considerably warmer planet, the wings might have served primarily as big, built in cooling fans when waved as well as insulators when rested against the body, and obviously the ability to cope with variable temperatures is a much more useful adaptation overall than flight or marginally increasing land mobility.  It's also conceivable that the flapping action of flight was a development from this kind of flapping to cool themselves.  Edit: typo"

This means that climbing with the hindlegs is easier, either up steep ground or in trees and bushes, including vertical tree trunks. Juveniles of a number of bird species use their half-developed wings in this manner even before they are capable of powered flight. The thought is that small dinosaurs would have used feathers in the same way, perhaps to access tree canopies, and then this system could later be refined to accomplish true powered flight."

Feathers generally insulate, meaning they keep the temperature within separate from the temperature outside. There is no need for a cold blooded creature to have this feature, since he is already relying on any and all temperature changes to come from the outside environment. A warm blooded creature however creates its own heat. The feathers then help that self regulated temperature remain independent from the outside environment.   I hope that makes sense, i'm just an enthusiast, not an expert."

Lots of fish, and even plants, seem to do a lot more to maintain their body temperature than we used to think, and the different strategies used by different lineages to maintain their temperatures don't clearly have enough in common to give them a unified name.  Back when people thought there was a sharp distinction, they used to think that most dinosaurs were on the ""cold blooded"" side. But now they think that most dinosaurs had some range of strategies to keep themselves warm (size being an important one!), and that many of them were probably more like birds in this regard than like their cousins, the crocodiles, or other living reptiles that are even less closely related."

Going by bone structure, birds repeatedly evolved from dinosaurs and dinosaurs repeatedly evolved from birds over millions of years so this is not really news. In fact, it's probably a false statement.  The line that led to modern birds permanently evolved, with a beak and short tail and  wing arms, from that varying ancestral family about 15 million years before the meteor strike. That family was separated from dromeosaurs by multiple levels through a division stretching back to the jurassic.

science,3di2d2,Redlaces123,4,Thu Jul 16 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"The normal practice these days is to use the concept of a ""crown group"" for taxonomic purposes. That is, you specify a bunch of individuals that should count as birds, and then anything descended from their most recent common ancestor counts too. You get slightly different groups if you start with all living birds, or if you also include archaeopteryx or some other extinct groups. There's nothing that clearly makes one of these crown groups the ""right"" grouping to use.  But at any rate, under any definition of this sort, all birds are dinosaurs, but there are many dinosaurs (probably including this one) that may or may not quite be birds, depending on where exactly you draw the line."
science,3di2d2,easwaran,5,Fri Jul 17 05:44:38 2015 UTC,"See my other reply in this thread, copied below.   Having bird-like traits does not necessarily make something a bird. This fossil demonstrates that there was definitely a feathered dinosaur with some sort of wings. While you could definitely draw an evolutionary line between this specimen and modern birds, the specimen in question isn't necessarily a bird.  From the Wikipedia page on birds:   Birds (class Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton.   Basically, by my understanding, all birds have feathers and wings but not all feathered and winged creatures are birds."

There is a certain distinction to be made between what we call birds and dinosaurs. Dinosaurs, for instance, rarely had beaks and almost always had teeth. They had four limbs with claws/feet on the end, not fully formed wings. Since the accepted definition of a bird is beaked, feathered, winged, warm blooded animal, it would make sense that a distinction should be made between the two, since dinosaurs were missing at least one of those traits."

Limestone isn't volcanic. I learned that in early elementary school. If it would have been a volcanic eruption, likely composition that would have covered it would be ash. I don't doubt the story but I want more information as to how that conclusion was drawn. 2) everybody and their mother thinks all dinosaurs had feathers. Maybe they did. But to draw that conclusion off just a few specimens that have had them is irresponsible science. Plenty of complete skeletons of many other species have been found without feathers. Hell, whole herds of a single species have been found together without a single trace of a feather. If I was going to draw a conclusion off what's been found is that feathers didn't evolve until at least the late Jurassic, if not early Cretaceous. So far, to my knowledge, its been just advanced theropods that have been found within them. Before anyone jumps all over me, I will admit I haven't followed dinosaurs like I used to and welcome knowledge from someone who knows much more on the subject."

And my personal  take is the ridiculous amount of ignorance around diet, weight and health.  With so many fad ""cleanses"" and ""fixes"" and several day to several month crash diet plans it's no surprise people fail to keep the fat off because their view on what the problem is is so fundamentally wrong:  Many people look at their weight as something to be ""fixed"" not an ongoing project.   Just tell someone you have a diet plan that will get them to their healthy weight and the first question will probably be ""how long do I have to do it for?"" and when the answer is the rest of your life it will almost certainly be met with disgust and giving up.  We live in a society of quick fixes... where doing it yourself is less and less desired and every solution should just be something you can buy, then maybe suffer for a bit to get through and the problem will be gone.  The problem is that the solution is very simple but given our available resources and societal norms (especially the Political correctness around weight discussion) can be difficult to maintain.   What people want is generally a solution that is complicated but easy.   So the idea ""eat less and be active"" is simple but hard to pull off whereas some magic interaction with an ancient Chinese berry and eating only at a certain time of day for 2 weeks sounds complex but is relatively easy to pull of so gets a lot of followers.  Selling people fad solutions is a highly profitable market and it's a pretty busy one at that.  As long as people keep trying to deny the simple evidence of calories in calories out and keep looking for magic solutions we will keep seeing failure rates like this.   TL:DR I don't think we see such high failure rates because of some physical reason, but mostly because people lack the will power and knowledge necessary to make the proper decisions and choices."

When you get that under control toss in macro nutrient balance.   There is no such a thing. The balance doesn't matter as long as you get all the essential amino and fatty acids.   Then start fine tuning micro nutrients.   That's what you need to do first, a lack of nutrients is very likely what makes you hungry, but foods may vary in what nutrients they have, so it's probably pointless to obsess over it. For most people, experimenting with different foods and finding what fills you up is much more practical.   EDIT BTW I don't see how you can make a blanket statement like ""if you follow CICO you will be hungry all the time"". considering how many low calorie dense foods there are out there, if you were to limit yourself to the lower end of the spectrum (ie celery, spinach, broccoli etc) a person on a 2000 kcal diet could consume literally gallons of food in a day and be on target.   I suppose it may work to some extent because you are physically unable to eat enough calories with such food, but it won't make you any more satisfied. How filling food is doesn't depend on its size.   Now you may have cravings (like chocolate) but that is not the same as being hungry and arguably even when eating massive surplus of calories it's quite possible to still have cravings (I know I did in my 5000+ calorie a day years)   When you have cravings, it's because you miss some nutrient present in what you crave. It's called ""specific hunger"" and it's well documented."

Again define your goal.    The goal CICO works for is weight management.   It's not a system to manage vitamin levels, hormone levels, or anything else.  It's a simply a truism that says your cannot create mass in your body you do not in some way consume.   So in that sense it absolutely works outside very limited medical conditions.   There is no such a thing. The balance doesn't matter as long as you get all the essential amino and fatty acids.   Now you are assuming goals.  Macro nutrient balance has benefits for certain goals such as body composition management and hormone balance.

For most people, experimenting with different foods and finding what fills you up is much more practical.   If this were true then eating massive quantities of nutrient deficient foods would not be such a common pathway and people eating reasonable portions of nutrient dense foods would not feel hungry.    This statement actually conflicts with your argument that CICO will leave you hungry.  If you get the correct amount of nutrients, by your own logic, you will not feel hungry so CICO shouldn't play a role unless you are suggesting that it is impossible to get a proper amount of nutrients from quantities of food suggested by CICO.   Which again would be impossible since CICO allows for more intake to balance increased calorie burn.  So even if your sedentary TDEE didn't allow you enough nutrients, you would only have to burn a few more calories to allow yourself more calories in or... you know... take a multivitaim.   I suppose it may work to some extent because you are physically unable to eat enough calories with such food, but it won't make you any more satisfied. How filling food is doesn't depend on its size.   I am confused, you are somehow sure that limiting the number of calories you eat will result in being hungry, but you then go on to say that amount of food you eat has nothing to do whether you feel hungry or not.    In the end if you still feel hungry after eating more than your body reasonably needs to sustain itself that is unfortunate and it then becomes your choice of whether you choose to feel good in the short term at the detriment of your overall longterm health.   When you have cravings, it's because you miss some nutrient present in what you crave. It's called ""specific hunger"" and it's well documented.

Some such foods may be surprisingly high in some nutrients. (chocolate is quite rich in minerals) It's also not entirely reliable - a lack of several minerals can cause salt cravings for example.

Obesity rates tie very closely to exposure to marketed and processed foods.  It's no secret that the food industry has become a machine tailored to creating addictive flavors and not healthy foods as they sell better and are more profitable.   So what has happened is almost certainly mostly that our previously valuable survival instincts (such as a taste for fat, salt and carbs which are normally hard to come by in a natural environment) are being targeted with much success by food producing companies.   Pair that with the fact that we now have access to almost limitless amounts of food year round and I think it's pretty clear what the issue is:  The game has gotten harder to win.   It doesn't change the rules of how you win, just the temptations to lose have become stronger and more abundant.   I'm saying it doesn't depend on the physical volume of food.    Then you will have to define your use of the term hunger.   Are you saying your bodies signals that your stomach does not have sustenance to process?  Or are you referring to your mouth wanted to taste something delicious?   Some such foods may be surprisingly high in some nutrients. (chocolate is quite rich in minerals) It's also not entirely reliable - a lack of several minerals can cause salt cravings for example. (probably because unrefined salt is usually a mix of other salts in addition to NaCl) You also probably won't crave food that you don't eat.   Chocolate as it is eaten in todays market is very low in nutrients vs many easily accessible alternatives.   That said with the sheer amount of food the average person eats in develop dcountries it is very hard to be vitamin deficient even with low quality foods.  The studies you have linked to show a propensity in some animals who do not have access to the same food choices we do to to compensate under specific conditions.   Do you have any links to studies showing human ability to do so that isn't conflated with human desire to eat higher levels of salt/sugar/fat?  For instance it shouldn't be too hard to control the diet of a group of people to be deficient in certain eliments and see if they suddenly crave foods specifically high in those items?  Or even better do lab tests on people, identify what they are already low on and see if their food cravings different from a control group that does not have those deficiencies but is in the same environment.   At the end of the day none of this matters as the original claim was CICO doesn't work.   Is your accretion that you can gain non water weight beyond the calories you consume or that sufficiently restricting calories will not will not reduce weight?  Because that's really all CICO says."
science,3dmapv,payik,-5,Sun Jul 19 08:12:23 2015 UTC,"Please elaborate on what is required of these highly theoretical situations. I am curious because I am apparently one of them... along with a handful of people I personally know who manage weight with CICO.    No you are not, it at best made you borderline eating disordered.    Obesity rates tie very closely to exposure to marketed and processed foods. It's no secret that the food industry has become a machine tailored to creating addictive flavors and not healthy foods as they sell better and are more profitable.    Is that some kind of conspiracy theory? What could they do with the food to make it ""addictive""? People have always tried to make food as tasty as possible and IMO most ""processed"" foods are very low on the scale of tastiness.   Then you will have to define your use of the term hunger.    The sensation of needing to eat.    Are you saying your bodies signals that your stomach does not have sustenance to process? Or are you referring to your mouth wanted to taste something delicious?   I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you're asking. Are you trying to say that cheese doesn't fill you up any more than the same volume of watermelon?   Chocolate as it is eaten in todays market is very low in nutrients vs many easily accessible alternatives.    What do you mean by that? It's one of the few non-exotic sources of copper, for example.   That said with the sheer amount of food the average person eats in develop dcountries it is very hard to be vitamin deficient even with low quality foods.   You seriously overestimate the quality of modern food.   Do you have any links to studies showing human ability to do so that isn't conflated with human desire to eat higher levels of salt/sugar/fat?   I'm not sure what you mean by that. I said it is. People think they crave salt/sugar/fat, while in fact they crave something more specific in the food.   For instance it shouldn't be too hard to control the diet of a group of people to be deficient in certain eliments and see if they suddenly crave foods specifically high in those items? Or even better do lab tests on people, identify what they are already low on and see if their food cravings different from a control group that does not have those deficiencies but is in the same environment.    As far as I know these tests were only done with animals, but there is no reason to believe our appetite works in a compeltely different way and focuses only on sugars, salt and fat. What if you tell me what you crave and I tell you what you're likely deficient in?   Is your accretion that you can gain non water weight beyond the calories you consume or that sufficiently restricting calories will not will not reduce weight? Because that's really all CICO says.   That's what it says and that's why it's an useless truism. If you lose weight, you lose weight. What does it tell us about succesful weight loss? Absolutely nothing. You insist you lost weight only because of CICO, but you described several strategies that are not CICO that you use to manage your weight."

Or simply the natural reaction to a sedentary career coupled with a society with over abundance of food sources.   It is not, in itself, a disease. It is caused by a disorder, and may lead to a number of diseases (heart disease, diabetes, neuropathy, etc.). Obesity is a natural reaction to an excess of food intake. If one were to eat endlessly and lose weight, that would signal a disease. Overeating and gaining weight is the healthy process for an animal. Limited food obsession is also fairly common. Over abundance of food sources is really the anomaly with more inactive jobs.   It's environmental influences to blame more often than anything else.

The hormones that regulate appetite, hunger, satiation, compounded by our calorie dense foods has created the perfect storm for obesity. This is why targeting half of the problem with calorie restriction typically fails. The food needs to be removed from the people entirely, or the people need to be removed from the food to simulate a natural famine.   I'm one of those struggling 1 in 210 men to keep off my 150lbs I lost. I can't count every calorie, every day for the rest of my life and constantly live in hunger. It's emotionally taxing and draining on me. I can't stand feeling hungry all day, every day, week after week and year after year.

I think it's probably done through bouts of feasts and famine naturally instead of artificial calorie restrictions.   So how does one that's prone to obesity naturally create the conditions favorable to long life by eating less? It's clear that artificial calorie restriction long term isn't viable for compliance.

Cardio makes your body more efficient, which in turn makes it require less energy. Beyond that, every run burns fewer calories than the last (if you are consistent) as your body adapts to the movements and becomes more efficient in performing them.   Cardio is a great tool for improved health, not as great for losing weight unless you are very strict in diet as well ensuring you stay uncomfortably hungry (which is often difficult to maintain long term).

The reverse diet aspect could very well only work in tandem with a rigorous training regime, which is where the additional energy is going.

The reality is that competitive power-lifters that are naturals, or close to natural (TRT or slightly higher) don't eat drastically more than you or I do. My maintenance is about 2750 to 3,000 calories. I seen Ben Rice talk about his diet. I would  say he is elite natural dead-lifting 700+ squatting 600+ with a lot of frequency isn't consuming gigantic amounts of food. He slow bulks on about 4,000 calories I think. I was actually surprised to see it wasn't much more than be as an amateur. People capable of maintaining of 6,7, or 10,000 calories or more are either VERY active or enhanced and have the lean mass to have their resting metabolic rate very high. The drugs help massively too.   On that same note, my issue isn't slowly reverse dieting, because even if I can improve my metabolism somehow by 10-15%, my appetite is still massively higher. The only way that I find to keep my consumption down, and this seems counter intuitive, but it's backed up by science, is to abstain completely. I fast to drop body fat and it's very easy for me. I create my own artificial famine. It's the only thing that works consistently for me. Once I eat though, it feels like there is no turning off my appetite."

science,3dmp73,texaspsychosis,16,Tue Jul 21 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"Here is the author's explanation... from the study:   Earlier age at first sexual intercourse and having a greater number of sexual partners appeared to account for the higher odds of pregnancy risk found among LGB-identified female students. Considering their participation in these sexual behaviors, these results are not surprising; nearly twice as many LGB as heterosexual female students (42% vs 22%, respectively) had their first sexual intercourse at age 13 years or younger and more than twice as many LGB as heterosexual female students (21% vs 9%, respectively) had had 6 or more sexual partners. These results are also consistent with existing literature in which LGB girls are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to have had their first sexual intercourse before the age of 14 years and to have had more sexual partners.5–10 It is important to note, however, that although LGB female students were significantly more likely than heterosexual female students to report ever having been forced to have sexual intercourse (29.2% vs 15.2%, respectively), forced sexual intercourse was not associated with increased pregnancy risk."

science,3dmomo,e_swartz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"Good insights! They help to contextualize the findings.  The study being done in a narrow demographic category doesn't really bother me too much. Other attempts to find MDD-linked loci had failed with more diverse demographics. The same for enriching the demographic set with melancholia; it increases the likelihood of finding something. It is important to understand that the researchers took this approach when thinking about the implications of their results though.  Interesting that the SNPs are enriched in this ancestry group, but not European ones. Potentially explains why they failed to replicate the finding using a European dataset (the alternative explanation being that the SNPs are an artifact). Also raises potentially interesting questions about how MDD might be subtly different based on genetics.  I think the bit about odds ratios is potentially misleading. ApoE4/E4 is the exception rather than rule when it comes to odds ratios for complex, genetically heterogeneous disorders.  The fact that this high-throughput (relatively unbiased) study identified genes (esp. SIRT1) which had previously been implicated in depression using traditional reverse genetics is what makes me more likely to pay attention."

science,3dlzp8,A_Light_Spark,5,Fri Jul 17 10:33:50 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding the research correctly at all, it's not inherent to the bacteria alone.  It happened when the researchers added feedback from the robot to the bacteria into their theoretical model.  When the robot starts to get close to a food source, it sends a chemical signal to the bacteria that boosts all the signals they are producing. I'm guessing this first drowns out the original food signal a bit, then enhances it if it's a true signal, making the robot ""rush"" forward.  So although they haven't tested this in a real experiment, they predict from their model that this is a natural property that unexpectedly emerged from the two-way chemical communication between the machine and the bacteria."

Example: Company called meeting to let everyone know (really everyone), that there will be no bonus paid out this year, due to failure to reach financial target. Company called about 50 different meetings to make sure every employee can hear it from management, before sending out an email. Everyone could voice their concern, for a month there were phone lines and email addresses set to answer questions. Not a single person (not even managers or team leaders) in my immediate vicinity (~200 employees) said a thing, but bitched about the thing for 3 months. ""When they pay me my bonus, I'll start working!"" - said the person/department, which came up with ~40 hours of lateness PER DAY!  If you let the rudeness to be everyday behavior, it becomes so toxic, normal people, who actually try to enjoy work, will leave. And that's when a company start declining very quickly.

science,3dlxl2,dustofoblivion123,6,Fri Jul 17 09:51:07 2015 UTC,"12 kg (26 in freedom units) in a year is about 2lbs/month.  That is a slow, but very maintainable rate.  However, I have questions about the article.   The enrolled patients have been subjected to VLCK diet (as implemented by Lignaform), a nutritional regimen is a VLCK diet, based on the use of high biological level protein formulation of milk/egg/legumes origin (peas and NO OGM soybeans), with a content of 15–18 g in proteins, 2–6 g in carbohydrates, 3 g in fats for a caloric intake of 100 kcal. Our method is articulated in different stages: in the first step we provide a protein intake of 1.2–1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight [13], in association with low-glycemic index vegetables. Thus, it is a normal-protein regime compared to the ideal  weight, but hyper-protein diet in relation to the others nutrients consumed.   So, low-fat, low-carb, adequate protein... that's not keto.  Keto is low-carb, adequate protein, but high-fat.  What are these poor sods eating if they can't have fat and are supposed to be getting adequate protein?  Lignaform and celery?   Afterwards, the formulations are replaced by naturalprotein foods and the diet is gradually completed with other aliments on the base of glycemic index following a multiphasic scheme.   Okay, good.  Natural proteins and veggies.   Then, only one formulation was replaced by a protein aliment (meat, fish, eggs) and vegetables (stage 2). Immediately after, another formulation was substituted with another protein food (conclusion of stage 2). Eventually, patients inserted, in sequential,fruit, dairy products, cereals and legumes (stages 3–4–5–6).The duration of each stage is proportional to weight loss during the ketogenic periods. The last stage (stage 7)consisted in a re-education to the Mediterranean diet based on patient’s expenditure of energy.   STAHP.  Fruit, dairy products, cereals and legumes are all explicitly outside of the keto I know and follow.  The only dairy that is allowed is heavy cream, and there are very few fruits that are allowed.  How is this a ketogenic diet?  They are getting tons of carbs from fruit and cereal and legumes!   RESULTS:  All the predetermined goals-namely safety, reduction of body weight and CV risk factors levels-have been reached with a significant reduction of body weight (from baseline to 4 weeks (-7 ± 5 kg, p < 0.001), from 4 to 12 weeks (-5 ± 3 kg, p < 0.001), no changes from 12 weeks to 12 months..   No wonder the weight loss petered off completely!  By the end of the year, they were all eating tons of carbohydrates again!   The last stage (stage 7) consisted in a re-education to the Mediterranean diet based on patient’s expenditure of energy  The Mediterranean diet traditionally includes fruits, vegetables and grains. For example, residents of Greece average six or more servings a day of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables. Grains in the Mediterranean region are typically whole grain and usually contain very few unhealthy trans fats, and bread is an important part of the diet.   Oh what in the hell.  So they lost 14 kg (half of it in the first month!!!) on ""keto-that-isn't-keto-at-all"" and then went back to the Mediterranean Diet and now are eating pasta and bread with every meal?"

The diet forces the body to burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function. However, if there is very little carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures.[1]  Posted here because I didn't know what a Ketogenic diet was.  So, to my understanding, it is basically the Atkins Diet.  Right?"
