In addition, the www.paydaymods.com site has some as well (obviously you know this already, as I assume that's where you aquired goonmod.) Any mod can be used with BLT(that isn't hoxhud). The only difference is you create a mod.txt file instead of editing the PD2hook.yml as was done with the old hook system."

paydaytheheistmods,3e1n03,starnuts77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:26 2015 UTC,The one in Gagehud is made by Seven
paydaytheheistmods,3e1n03,Remobit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:16 2015 UTC,Yes I know but this is a standalone flashlight extender mod.  OP probably can't use gage hud since it conflicts with one of his other mods.
paydaytheheistmods,3e1n03,starnuts77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:50 2015 UTC,Is there also a standalone minimap mod? I can't use GageHUD because I have to run at 640x480.
paydaytheheistmods,3e1n03,cluckay,3,Tue Jul 21 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"Most of the scripts in GageHUD are actually standalone scripts to begin with that were just lumped together, and you can fairly easily extract the code from them. The only parts of it I'm aware of that require a bit more effort are the list stuff that is like 4k+ lines of code in several different files, and the custom HUD which was never really designed to be compatible with anything else.  The flashlight stuff in particular is all in the same file, so if you just go here: https://github.com/cjur3/GageHud/blob/master/mods/GageHud/Lua/WeaponFlashlight_ext.lua  you got all the code needed. Just remove the outer if and change the range and angle values to an actual value and you got a standalone script."

Click on the first pastebin and copy all of the code and copy into a new file into Notepad++, save it Hudlist with the suffix being a .lua file.  Now go to the mod.txt pastbin and copy all of the text, paste it into a new file in NP++ then save it to the folder that you made earlier.  Make sure and save it as mod.txt file.  Make sure both file are in the folder you created and drag the folder over to blt just like you would do with any other blt mod folder.

paydaytheheistmods,3cgbpu,Devilz_Avacado,2,Tue Jul 7 22:53:49 2015 UTC,The update? Im currently using it no problem.
paydaytheheistmods,3cehuw,mrpeanut188,2,Tue Jul 7 07:44:28 2015 UTC,"I made a post about this on the main subreddit, when it got released, just saying. But no one hasn't made a post here."
paydaytheheistmods,3cehuw,Tonistanel12,2,Tue Jul 7 12:16:48 2015 UTC,"I check both and couldn't find anything, decided this place was more revelant as most people won't care about until it's actually used for something. The problem right now is we need bone support to actually create stuff that is not static. If we could spawn in models using scripts that would definitely be a step up. It's possible but I don't know how, someone probably does though."
paydaytheheistmods,3cfuce,starwarsian,4,Tue Jul 7 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"HoxHud - most popular HUD, offers anticheat capability and other QoL features. Very good for new players as it teaches them features not explained in the game, such as pager limits, loot count and down counter. Downsides are that it has group DRM, doesn't play well with other mods and often breaks with every update.  PocoHud - second most popular. Much more customisable than HoxHud. More stable, and if it does break then a fix is usually available a few hours later. Doesn't have anticheat but it does solve desync problems. I recommend this one the most.  HoloHud - doesn't give info out like the previous two, just changes colours and moves information around.  DynamicHud - just gives the HUD a new look without adding new info like Hox and Poco.  PDTH HUD - makes the game look more like Payday The Heist's HUD. Very customisable, blends well with Alpha HUD. Also includes features like colour grading and challenges.  Alpha HUD - restores the HUD to look more like it did during the alpha/beta stages of the game. Was released alongside Project Canary which is another mod I recommend."
paydaytheheistmods,3cfuce,LordManders,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"Very good summary: I'll add onto Pocohud: it had a really rough time  regarding stability in the spring break event, which is right when it really picked up speed, which is where so many of the questions I've had regarding stability have come from, I suspect. It had one minor stability issue prior to that event, and one since(both quickly fixed).     It's definitely my top pick as well. And the desync solver is a godsend."

The smaller versions of the main texture that are appearing when you load the texture are the MIP maps. Unticking ""Load MIP maps"" will only cause the main, largest texture to be loaded. These are textures with a single layer, so that's basically all there is; it's not like modding-friendly templates with several layers you might be provided for other games.  Don't forget to render MIP maps when you save a .dds file; unless it's for a HUD object in which case rendering MIP maps can cause blurred images at low texture quality."

I used the dowload PAYDAY2BLT option for BLT.  I then downloaded pocohud and put it into the mod folder from BLT.   I obviously tried deleting them first to no avail.
paydaytheheistmods,3blnd0,xKaillus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:10:40 2015 UTC,"First off, delete IPHLPAPI.dll from your /PAYDAY 2/ folder. Then, follow the steps outlined below.   Download BLT from this link, and install as normal. (Skip if you already have BLT running fine.) Download PocoHud3 from this link. Extract the ""PocoHud3"" folder from the master.zip you downloaded formerly into your mods/ folder. Download the Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable from this microsoft site. Download the x86/32-bit version and install it. Launch PAYDAY, configure as you wish."

paydaytheheistmods,3beeiw,veachh,2,Sun Jun 28 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"I've shifted away from using HoxHud in combination with BLT mods in the hopes of improving performance, but it shouldn't be too big of an issue. If you encounter any problems, try disabling PocoHud first.  So, first you'll need to install HoxHud in the usual manner. Download is here, you'll need to be a member of the Steam group first. Second, you'll need BLT:CSE, which is a version of BLT modified to be compatible with HoxHud. You can get it right here, extract into your Payday 2 folder.  Now you'll need GoonMod and PocoHud. GoonMod is available here, install it in the usual manner (extract the GoonMod folder into PAYDAY 2\mods and GoonModWeaponCustomizer into PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides, though I think you can automatically download the customization files in-game once GoonMod is setup normally). PocoHud is a touch trickier, you'll want this version, extract the PocoHud3 folder into PAYDAY 2\mods. (PocoHud3, not PocoHud3-master, the folder inside the folder in the zip.)  When you launch Payday 2 you'll get a message that GoonMod is out of date. You'll need to manually enable it from the options menu then restart; most features work fine (at least weapon customization for weapons not from the most recent DLC, normalized ironsights, and the GageCoins features).  Crashing may be inevitable because of HoxHud and/or PocoHud, but in the past I've had all three mods working together just fine, and there's no reason why it shouldn't work anymore."

Please remember to tag your posts with a flair in the future! :p  To answer your questions:   Bodhi's Sound Repair is meant to be installed as a mod_override. Go to your PAYDAY folder, open the assets folder, and open the mod_overrides folder (if there isn't one, make one). Then, extract Bodhi's into there. Make sure there's a Bodhi's Sound Repair folder in mod_overrides, and then inside that folder is a folder called soundbanks, and in that folder there are lots of files that have a .bnk file extension. GoonMod automatically disables itself after every patch after the one on which it was originally released. To circumvent this, go into Options > Lua Mods > GoonMod > Ignore Unsupported Version, then restart your game. The PAYDAY Bundle Tool is a tool that modders use to patch in new files that cannot be overridden with the mod_overrides format. It can be downloaded from here.

If you really need to know, you can ask me and I'll tell you if I feel like it. I remember back when I grew up, when we actually talked to people instead of to Google.  Personally I think a far better question is why do you not play with a private profile? Most people don't go around sharing everything about their personal life for no reason other than that they can and I don't see why a game platform profile should be any different.

Let's face it - this saves you maybe about a million spending per switch compared to the profilers that charge you for switching profiles. It's pretty much a non-issue.

At least that's what I've seen people wanting Overkill to implement."

The music on that heist is sooo confusing. There are a total of 68 total sounds in the /music_alesso/ folder. Some are sound files for people cheering and calling out to alesso, but the majority are 3-7 second clip sound files for the main music. The main background you hear during stealth is different from loud. Answering the intercom plays another file... when you hit the 1st button it plays another. Most of the files sound like loops that can play seamlessly from one to the next. Payday uses .stream files for their sound that can be converted to wav, edited, saved, and converted back to stream. I used Official Payday 2 Modding Guide - How to mod sounds to do it. EDIT:Spelling... also, I'm also super new to this"

The focused hip-fire stance, while not perfect for mid ranges, is perfect whenever using the weapon in their best ""habitat"":close quarters. Having most of the screen clear without narrowing the Field of view gives a better idea on where you are spraying your bullets. I rate the LMGs 8/10 in this way  -LMGs with iron sight are something absolutely amazing for medium - long ranges. Hell, i modded the Rpk to reach 18 accuracy, and it's basically an assault rifle on steroids. The iron sight makes it feel quite better for ranges. Now you might argue ""But it doesn't reach > 40 damage!""...but with such an ammo pool, magazine and rate of fire, the Rpk with a particular config and the sight mod can shit on every ""meta"" weapon 's breakfast. I rate the LMGs 10/10 with this mod"

paydaytheheistmods,37wl77,BradPoops,5,Sun May 31 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"TL,DR: Basically a bunch of people started accusing the creator of stealing code, so he took it down. Quick question for the moderators, would it be OK if I put up a download link for it for anyone who wants it? He says in the group post he doesn't care what people do with the code."
paydaytheheistmods,37wl77,Omen267901,2,Sun May 31 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"So first off: Kilandor has taken it down by his choice, and I would like to be able to ask that you respect his decision in that, and be somehow reserved in sharing links.   I'd rather advocate mods that will remain supported. There are some that fill similar roles. I'm a huge advocate of Bodhi's War Repair for features similar to a lot of the QoL features that Hoxhud provided. If users really want unit/loot amounts on map. There are scripts for that, such as Seven's Dynamic Hud panels. And I would far rather support mods that are likely to receive future support, and that haven't been removed by the creator.  Now, with that said: I'm totally fine with a download link for the people that are really seeking that one in particular - but I'll tag /u/xKaillus, for an opportunity if he or anyone else have anything to say on the matter. I'm not sure of what sort of feedback/discussion went on in particular to the creation of this mod past what occurred on this sub, so I'm certainly not comfortable saying that that's mine could be a final decision. The files will always exist, there's nothing anyone can do about that. And while I'd personally rather respect the decisions that were made, I see nothing wrong with linking people that didn't get a chance to download it before it was taken down.      Keep in mind that mod will receive no updates, being that it's no longer supported. So any stability issues are likely to remain unresolved. So it's not necessarily the best modding option in the first place. But until Kail or another mod says otherwise, I'm totally fine with a link being shared to users looking for that mod specifically. But as I said, I'd always rather see support for current mods over dropped ones. And many offer features similar, or parallel to existing Hoxhud features.    Because there is some demand for familiarity that people once had for Hoxhud, I should compile a post tomorrow night with links for a couple of mods that offer the most similar functionalities. That might be a better idea, in all honesty."
paydaytheheistmods,37wl77,ShakeDeSnake,2,Sun May 31 09:59:56 2015 UTC,"That list of mods that mimic hoxhud functionality is a good idea. I will refrain from posting the mod here but if anybody truly wants it, they can private message me and I will send it. Thank you for input."

HudList - Shows more info like possible bags spawned, enemies spawned, etc. Similar to HoxHud's function.   Persistent Filter Settings - Keeps your server filter settings when browsing Crime.net.  Flashlight Extender - The flashlight range is farther compared to the vanilla.   KillCounter - Keeps track of how many enemies/specials killed in a current heist.  MiniMap - Displays a minimap indicated in the bottom-right of the Hud.   PacifiedCivilianMarkers - The exclamation marks above a civilian's head will turn green when they are intimidated. (Indicates that they are on the ground and won't phone the police or run away.)  SpeedUp - Speeds up the EXP Ring and such so you don't have to wait any longer.   Please excuse me if I left some things out. I don't personally use this mod but I've seen these features before."

What's okay or not over there is pretty much a throw of the dice, they have no clue what they are doing. Like I said elsewhere, if HoxHud showing timers and stuff is okay because you can just use a stopwatch to get the same information (yeah right...), then I don't see how a minimap that shows highlighted enemies is any different as you can get the same information by just, you know, looking around and see if there are any marked units."

Problem is, not all filetypes are supported for this operation, and the support for them needs to be added by Overkill themselves, i.e. can't be added via mods. If it was possible - HD weapons mod would fully install into mod_overrides folder from the get go, but unless Overkill implements support for the filetypes that the mod relies on to be overridden - it's not gon happen.

paydaytheheistmods,35x3mt,xKaillus,0,Thu May 14 06:29:54 2015 UTC,"How is it decided how much buffing is allowed? DPS? How is knockdown:DPS considered? It's hard to go directly off of DPS/KDPS too, because heavier hitting weapons can still be a better asset than say the trench knife if you use it exclusively as finisher, even more so with Sociopath.    I've never really been keen on changing values of anything for this reason. I prefer to stick to QoL/appearance modifications. FOV/look radius are fine by me. But the only way you can ensure weapon balance as intended is by directly copying another weapons stats. (say you like the look of motherforker, but want trench knife stats. Because of animation process, it's easier to put the knife stats onto the fork than move the models around). How would you like to ensure that we aren't creating game breaking content?"

First method via lua, but it is very limited as you don't have a whole lot of props to work with. Most of the game props don't sync up with other clients. Second method is via bundles, this method allows for complete editing of levels with any game prop.  I prefer the bundle method, because it provides a much larger palette to work with and it's extremely similar to how Overkill make their levels. The progress on this was being posted here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/15/617329920708259049/ but currently it is on halt because I'm working on Bundle Modder and the model plugin for Blender.

As they would not 'know' where the new walls and things are.    Also what about custom objectives and win conditions?  Is that also possible?

paydaytheheistmods,35o2y7,Antonpup,2,Tue May 12 12:39:04 2015 UTC,"Blender plugin release depends on how fast I can finish it with full compatibility. My plan for releases are as follows: Sometime within next 2 months finish Bundle Modder 1.16, release GUI updates for Bundle Tool and Sound Tool, as well as release BNK tool. After that I will take a break and work on Blender plugin and do general fixes for tools. Around Oct/Nov I will probably begin working on Bundle Modder 1.17, I expect a semi-functional Blender plugin at that time which will be distributed to a wider group of modders for testing. If all goes well, by the end of 2015 Blender plugin should be done. Keep in mind that I am working on all of this alone. If I had more people with me on these things, this'd be a whole lot faster.  I haven't looked at AI pathing, but afaik there's nodes within the map, so it shouldn't be too difficult to make my own.  Objectives are saved in the same format as the levels and other stuff.

paydaytheheistmods,35mk2y,The_BERFA,4,Mon May 11 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Pocohud has some of the features from Hoxhud(kill counters, down counters, stamina meter, etc). But yeah, it doesn't provide all of the same things.    You have a couple options: Kail(xKaillus) combined some of the scripts that Hoxhud had(like auto-skip intro/card/stat screens, and green ! markers on hot civs), and wrote a pager counter to go along with it all under a header of ""Bodhi's War Repair"". It's a chat feature, rather than on-screen. So it isn't an exact mimic, but provides the same functionality. Otherwise, if you want to make Hoxhud work with BLT, Olipro wrote a fork of the BLT he calls BLT:CSE. Some people report problems with it, some have success. So it could be worth a try - that's totally up to you. Link here.    I advise you make sure BLT works before attempting BLT:CSE(to make sure you have the c++ Redistributable packages, and 4.5 .NET framework properly acquired. So that you can rule those problems out when trying BLT:CSE)"

(Planned for version 1.17) Able to add/shift files within the game. This is needed for custom heists and other things. (Planned for version 1.17) Able to install pdmodpacks, which is a bundle of mods that will install at the same time. Including BLT.   mod_override   Allows the game to use certain files in-place of the game files (following filetypes are supported: models, sounds, textures, fonts, material_configs)   BLT   Allows for lua modifications Lua modifications can change game functionality, but are limited to existing game files.   In a nutshell, Bundle Modder allows for complete game file management as well as some utility functions, mod_override allows for limited game file replacement, and BLT allows for changing game functionality using existing game files."

paydaytheheistmods,357hk6,xKaillus,2,Sat May 9 04:22:27 2015 UTC,Can you post your log? PAYDAY 2/mods/logs/(latest-date)-log.txt
paydaytheheistmods,357hk6,mrpeanut188,1 point,Thu May 7 20:24:41 2015 UTC,"Here it is!  Edit- I also tried to follow Le_saint's suggestion, but that didn't same to change anything. Game boots up normally, and it shows in the LUA mod menu, but nothing happens ingame."
paydaytheheistmods,3583rg,fortris,1 point,Thu May 7 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"I assume you ran into the lovely inventory screen bug that Goonmod currently has. There's a fix available right here that'll make it stop exploding when you open up the inventory.  If you've already gotten the latest versions of HoxHud and PocoHud working together, you've got BLT:CSE installed properly. Follow the instructions in that thread and you'll have Goonmod working on top of that. Enjoy!"
paydaytheheistmods,3583rg,X11WindowDump,1 point,Thu May 7 22:52:50 2015 UTC,"Goonmod simply does not show up, at all. I have no idea if BLT:CSE is even installed properly, I'm going to assume it isn't because of my dumb AV deleting IPHLPAPI.dll in the lib/Native folder.  Honestly this whole ordeal is just making me not want to play period, I gave up shortly after making the post. I REALLY despise the fact Goonmod is locked to BLT after using it a year without it, threw a giant monkey wrench into how easy my mods worked before."
paydaytheheistmods,3583rg,Kilandor,0,Fri May 8 00:19:49 2015 UTC,If your AV is deleting that file then yes that is a problem its required for BLT:CSE  Mods are still very easy to use. BLT is very easy to use but the process is complicated due to HoxHud and BLT:CSE.....  It is very easy to know if BLT is loading. Simply check mods/logs for a log file. Also in game you can go to Options > Lua Mods If you have this BLT is loaded.
paydaytheheistmods,3583rg,ShakeDeSnake,1 point,Fri May 8 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"Not the biggest fan of restoring files my AV deletes, and the weirdest part is I had scanned all the files before to make sure it DIDN'T happen.  Again, this whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth and while a new heist is in game, I'll probably just continue my break. Thank you for the help."
paydaytheheistmods,3583rg,ShakeDeSnake,1 point,Fri May 8 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"Have you tried just using BLT to see if any mods work? Currently, Goonmod is force disabled because it's not updated to the current game version. There is a user fix, which I'll link you once you get BLT working. But let's start that as a priority. If BLT works, then you have all the requirements you should need for BLT:CSE. And it should work, in theory. But with the new update, many people have been reporting issues with Hoxhud itself. So that could be your issue.    Edit: Also, the BLT hook is created to help make modding less complicated, it's weird at first, but once you understand it, it simplifies things. First off, each mod gets its own folder in your /mod/ folder, so you know exactly which files belong to what mod. All the mods hosted on Paydaymods.com also offer auto-updates when the mod creator changes any of the files. BLT also adds a mod list where you can hotswap them on and off as you please, without having to modify the files at all. And a hotkey menu where you can view all of your mod hotkeys, and it crosses over with the existing game keybind to ensure there's no conflicts."
paydaytheheistmods,354i68,TheOPOne_,2,Thu May 7 01:08:38 2015 UTC,I'll take a crack at it. Hopefully shouldn't be too hard since the original audio file is in the proper format already. I should have something in a few hours.
paydaytheheistmods,354i68,X11WindowDump,4,Thu May 7 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, I did a hack-ish mod_overrides folder. Using this LastBullet wiki page as a guide, I replaced about 250 of Hoxton's lines with one of two versions of ""don't act dumb."" It's not every line, but it should come up often enough to be mildly amusing.  Get your hands on this .zip file and extract it into your mod_overrides folder.  For something more comprehensive, making a script would probably be best because this wasn't terribly fun. Unfortunately I'm not up to speed on writing Payday 2 Lua scripts, but someone like /u/xKaillus who's spent a lot of time working with Payday 2's voice system for the very lovely PROJECT: Canary could probably tell us more about how this could happen. (Hooking the voice file choosing system, looking to see if it's Houston speaking, then randomly choosing one of the ""don't act dumb"" files and picking that one instead? No real clue about how to go about it.)"

paydaytheheistmods,351r0z,malignousThaumaturge,3,Wed May 6 12:40:13 2015 UTC,"Goonmod has a user fix, which seems to work found here.  You will still have to force enable through the goonmod in-game menu, but this stops it from breaking the inventory when you do.   Olipro wrote a fork of the BLT called BLT:CSE on his GitHub. Which is made to make Hoxhud work with the BLT hook.   Pocohud has its own keybind for the menu in backspace(it was an old functionality from before any mod used the options menus, but it's actually quite nice to have it there, once you know the hotkey)"
paydaytheheistmods,351r0z,ShakeDeSnake,1 point,Wed May 6 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"I tried the BLT:CSE thing. I either installed it wrongly or it doesn't work. The game hangs at a black screen - upon alt-tabbing, a command prompt with a seemingly infinite loop appeared. Only after closing Payday or the command prompt did it stop."
paydaytheheistmods,351r0z,ShakeDeSnake,1 point,Fri May 8 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had some pretty serious problems when I tried BLT:CSE too. I wasn't sure what I did wrong. My first thought is you could be missing. I should really go back and mess around with it to find solutions to my problems with how much I advise others. Sorry mate.     the good news, you aren't alone in having problems. Many users are reporting issues with CSE that BLT doesn't have. :/"
paydaytheheistmods,351r0z,ShakeDeSnake,2,Fri May 8 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"It's alright, it's not surprising for a rather new(?) change to modding to cause problems. I can at least make do with Goonmod working."
paydaytheheistmods,350fgx,Enraric,7,Wed May 6 01:51:26 2015 UTC,We'll be redoing the textures soon to make sure low-settings users don't experience these problems.
