nbacirclejerk,3e203o,plasker6,4,Tue Jul 21 12:05:51 2015 UTC,"It really gets to me that we as a subreddit community pick and choose certain players to shit on. And I mean shit on hard. It's rude, it's unfair, and it's just plain wrong.  Take DeAndre Jordan for instance. Guy just got a great contract. For the first time, he's pursued and courted by multiple teams(in playoff contention i might add). So Mark Cuban of the Mavs compliments him, calling him their soon-to-be franchise player. Now, everyone's shitting on him, insulting him for his free throws, his lack of offense. Basically all his strengths are ignored and all his weaknesses are magnified through a whale-sized telescope.  Come on guys. You don't have to like the player. Hell, you could even hate him. But be respectful! He's a human being just like the rest of us. Some of the comments I read here just blow my mind. It's borderline toxic!  edit: I'm not talking about simple banter over players. It's all fine and dandy if we talk shit about players not being able to make free throws. It's fine if we make fun of them for dating under-age teens. But sometimes, people go too far. For me, Whenever I feel a sharp sting in my chest reading a redditor's comment..thats when I know the dude took things too far. I don't like that, and I feel we as a reddit community shouldn't condone that."

Even he has come to the conclusion that Curry will go down as the the GOAT shooter.  It's not just about the stats, it's the difficulty of the shots that Curry makes, the pull-up crossovers on the fastbreak from 28 feet out and no one in the building has any doubt that it's going in. We've never seen a player that can do the things Curry does."

It's fiscal responsibility per 48 years is terrible right now, and at this point it can't defend the new faster economic collapses like Venezuela.  But you can't overlook the intangibles. Greece is a veteran with championship experience. It was there for Europe's first back-to-back championships at Marathon and Salamis. That sort of leadership in the locker room is invaluable, especially with so many young players like Slovakia and Slovenia on the team.  And Greece is great at recruiting. When free agents like Turkey and Ukraine come in for a visit, Greece drops its laurel wreaths on the table. If you think that sounds lame, then that just means you don't care enough about winning.
