NoFapChristians,3e2dd2,thehague67,4,Tue Jul 21 12:43:04 2015 UTC,"If I offered you $5 million to never masturbate again, could you do it? You almost certainly could.  Well, why? Why can you seemingly go instantly from struggling to quit, to very easily giving it up? Because it's all in the mind. You just needed something to fight for, something to motivate you.   Well, Jesus gives you something better than $5 million. Actually, better than $50 million. Even better than $500 million! What is it? Eternal life with God. That's worth more than all the money in the world, it's worth more than the greatest pleasure and the most amazing joy.  Start thinking about that when you feel like throwing the towel in. It gets tough but you have something amazing. Make the right choice. If you'd stop for $5 million, surely you can stop for something that's infinitely (literally) better than all the money in the world."
NoFapChristians,3e2dd2,asaph23,3,Tue Jul 21 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to push back on this analogy and say on the whole, the hypothetical $5 mil to stop masturbating wouldn't work for anyone here. At some point you'd be too weak. The promise of heaven won't ever even be enough. Both of these are entirely too reliant on our ability to think straight, and to see things from an eternal/long term perspective. Sure sometimes this will be enough to get through an urge, but definitely not every urge. What is enough to get us through it? I'll expound below.  You also didn't even answer his plea for clarification on his salvation.  To OP: If you go your entire life without ""kicking"" this habit, but continually battle against it, repenting, and pursuing godliness, that is about the perfect picture of the sanctification process God promises us. We will never ""arrive"" as Christians in this world.   Now as to how to pursue this sanctification, you must humble yourself to continually ask for His help, to ask for the Holy Spirit to change your heart. There are many different tools you can use, from accountability, to scripture verses, to prayer, to nofap, to blocking/reporting software. One powerful tool I recently read about is a more biblical concept of sorrow. It can be assumed that after you fail in this battle you feel a good amount of guilt and sadness. But we need to understand why we feel sad, is it because of the present, earthly consequences (affects libido, affects relationship, poor example for children, could lose a job if caught, etc.), the fact that you weren't strong enough? While these can be motivators at times, they shouldn't be the reason for our sorrow in our failure. The sorrow should come from a profound understanding of how we have offended God (with a healthy reminder that He sees us as blameless thanks to Christ's sacrifice) This is a tool that is unfortunately easier to use following a relapse, and not as good (in my experience) during those ""911"" urges, but if you can nurture this concept of just how offensive sin is to God and attempt to feel that same disdain for it in your life (with the help of the Holy Spirit) it can be extremely powerful.  I'll say again though, while we need to make sure the guilt and sorrow is rooted in the right motivations, it should not take over. It should not be driving your outlook lower and lower and worse and worse. Because when we think of sin in the context of God, it's always tied to His sacrifice on the cross. And that is POWERFUL! Remember that you are bought with the blood of Christ and nothing you can do will cause Him to forsake you. And be encouraged that as you experience these low times, you're experiencing grace first-hand. He is equipping you with this experience that allows you to empathize and show the grace that He showed you to others in your life. This is so so so valuable.  A great book that goes in-depth to many tools available to us is ""Finally Free"" While it primarily talks about porn (more than masturabation) the concepts can be applied to any sinful habit that you seek to battle in your life!"

Jesus took your hell so you don't have to. This is why we trust Jesus. We trust that our righteousness before God couldn't be earned by us, and doesn't have to be. But that Jesus earned it for us and gave it to us.  God loves you not because you overcome fapping or porn. But because Jesus took your sins and your wrath, thus allowing him to justly love you.

If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.“ ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5:27-30‬ ‭ESV‬‬ http://bible.com/59/mat.5.27-30.esv  „“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.” But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.“ ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭6:12-20‬ ‭ESV‬‬ http://bible.com/59/1co.6.12-20.esv  „And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.“ ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:1-10‬ ‭ESV‬‬ http://bible.com/59/eph.2.1-10.esv  „And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.“ ‭‭Galatians‬ ‭4:6-7‬ ‭ESV‬‬ http://bible.com/59/gal.4.6-7.esv  „For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba!

NoFapChristians,3e4mnd,jacobwdesign,2,Tue Jul 21 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"from my research and from listening to experts i trust almost categorically, secular meditation - especially the kind that repeats mantras, is extremely dangerous. there will be short term gains, but they will be counterbalanaced with later suffering. Malachi Martin, oen of the Catholic Church's most renowned exorcists, emphatically declared that repeating mantras with eastern meditation can result in demonic possession, too. not that it happens every time, but if it is practiced seriously and consistently it can result in demonic possession, which is the worst thing that can happen to someone, although Jesus can cure it.   there is a difference between eastern and Christian meditation, in that in the eastern school, the goal is to empty and calm the mind. this is really good for people who are stressed out or whose minds are an unrelenting ferment of tossing waves and roaring surf. you feel the benefits now, so you say.   Christian meditation on the other hand, isn't about emptying the mind as it is about focusing the mind on what truly matters - on Jesus Christ as the source of all meaning in life, and on what he did, his mission, Abba's nature, etc. It's about getting to know the trinity and spending time with them. Christian meditation is almost like prayer, but it's an experienced prayer, not a spoken one. very mystical it may seem, but totally like what you'd do with a friend you hang out with. it's no big deal.   the reason Christians don't like that stuff, and i'm talking about true Christians and not people who are simply xenophobic, is because the spirit of God is against the spirit that animates eastern religion and all that kind of stuff. that stuff is from Satan, and those people who get all bent out of shape and call that 'extremist' or 'ignorant' really just don't know reality i think. i'll tell you, that i don't have a huge amount of experience myself. but in my line of life, i've learned not to trust people unless they jump through a whole series of hoops ... and my authority on this has.   do not pursue mantras, and do not pursue Eastern stuff. if you are truly Christian, you will be turned off by that stuff from the deepest parts of you anyway, you'll have your doubts and concerns. which is the nature of your post anyway. your doubt comes from a good place."

I've heard of qi or chi, I don't really believe in any of that ""energy new age"" stuff.  I meditate because I believe the scientifically proven benefits (increased gray matter in prefrontal cortex) which improves willpower and decision making.  Your forcing yourself to stay focused or present and not let your mind wander. That's a great thing for a Christian to have self control over their mind. The bible speaks many times about self-control. But it's important that it stay's secular for me and detached from hinduism, buddhism or other conflicting beliefs.   So in and of itself, sitting and breathing and staying focused on your breath, or counting your breaths can't possibly hurt your spiritual life, but the more control you have other your thoughts the better."
NoFapChristians,3e4mnd,MYUTMOST,2,Wed Jul 22 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree, to be honest.  An important element of what you are saying revolves around 'self'. Focussing on breath is a great way to reinforce the ego, the self. But did John 3:30 not say: ""He must increase, but I must decrease."" Indeed, did not Paul say in Galatians 2:20: ""I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.""  Personally I think one of the great distinguishing factors of /r/NoFapChristians versus vanilla NoFap is that we build our house on the rock, on the Lord, not on our selves. Yes we too can learn a great deal from all these self-help and self-improvement things, and likewise can we incorporate meditation techniques from other cultures and religions, but lest it not be at the cost of what is most central in our interior life: to follow Christ."

From what I can make out you're hav some fairly common issues that happen as your brain heals from porn. But I'll be honest in that I may of missed something. It's a long post and a bit hard to follow in places.   And yes. Night dreams are fairly normal at this stage.  Firstly you have prayed and repented and you ARE FORGIVEN. You are free. But that does not change the patterns in your brain. It is always the hardest thing to do to change habits. But that is what we are called to do for Christ.   As far as the extreme sensitivity to female contact including ejaculation. That is in large part your withdrawal from porn. At this stage you are starting to heal but those old patterns of thought are on a ragged edge trying to get satisfaction. Continuing to deny them is the only way to be free of them. It may also be from you being so focused on not thinking bad thoughts that it's a heightened trigger. My advice would be to instead of trying not to think of sex stuff. Simply focus on the God stuff. It's not easy. But we don't really think about fornication while we are chatting with God.   Keep up the fight! You're doing great!  Also I know there a lot of debate on cursing but you may want to read through the book of James. It's fairly short and has some great stuff.

I think there are two pieces of advice I'd recommend you try: 1) One thing to do is to have some ""distractions"" so that when you're feeling urges to fap you can take your mind completely out of it. Now personally i'd strongly recommend you try a visual distraction such as a youtuber you like, something like /r/funny/ or even back on this subreddit to get some motivation. 2) A stronghold breaker. This is one that is great for commitment, and it something that you would pray to God everyday for a given time period (I would say at least 2 weeks) where you can ask God to ""help you resist urges and temptation during the day"" something along those lines that you can keep coming back to everyday and assuring yourself.  A few other things i'd say is that you can do it, I know how strong temptation and urges can feel but you don't need to do it, you just want to. Finally, pray about it, and maybe you could pray about it with your girlfriend, she sounds great and supportive and you'd be surprised how willing people will be to help. I'll certainly be praying for you brother. :)  P.S. I'm a 19 y.o. university student so I can relate."

NoFapChristians,3du8wj,strawhat1995,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"Well so is the internet. Everything you say or do is ""of the flesh"" your church and most churchs are riddled with pedophiles. Masturbation is literally just you. No harm done. This site, reddit is filled with porn left and right. Your clothes were sold in part to make you ""look good"" to others. Therefore, it's of the flesh. If god didn't want you to masturbate,  he wouldn't have made people be able to. You don't rot in jail for masturbating alone. You don't get ridiculed in church because you fap. It's natural. Many animals do it. Do all dogs who hump legs go to hell? No. So this whole idea Iudacris. Where in any religious text does it explicitly say ""no masturbating"" ? Not something you can manipulate to make it seem that way, but actual exact references to masturbation."
NoFapChristians,3du8wj,leftysoweak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:30 2015 UTC,"You sound like an atheist. I'm going to explain this to you as clearly as I can. On the subject of masturbation the Bible doesn't forbid or denounce it. It does denounce all forms of sexual impurity and fantasies that would involve adulterous relationships whether actual or mental. The problem with masturbation is that it not only can become habit forming and addictive, but men and women often engage in pornography and adulterous fantasies in order to reach a climax. Further, the difference in sex drive in a couple is often not the real problem or issue. It also warns against all forms of self-indulgence, adultery of the mind, lust of the flesh, and fornication. One of the problems involved is that though God created sex for enjoyment and pleasure, it is to be confined to the marriage relationship between a man and a woman because it is also designed to express love (not just sexual love), unity, and total commitment. Masturbation is an act of self-gratification rather than a part of giving gratification and pleasure to one’s partner."
NoFapChristians,3du8wj,leftysoweak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"I am an atheist. But regardless of what I believe, there are facts. Priests have been caught and charged with molestation. If god is so great and created everything as you say he did,  why would he make any masturbation possible? And going to hell for that is like a cop giving you the death penalty for a u turn. Just because you say on the Bible you love a woman and marry her, why does that cause such a difference? A ring and some words are all it takes to win god over? People get married all the time without love. Gay men get married to straight women and have affairs. These aren't opinions these are facts. No man it without sin. So being as that's true, no one would get into heaven. Masturbation isn't a sin.  It's natural.  People do it. It doesn't kill people. It's not devil worship. Saying it's punishable by banishment to hell is ridiculous. The Crusades happened. Millions killed for ""god"". Somehow that's seen in god's eyes as the same as a man masturbating? Explain that logic."
NoFapChristians,3du8wj,leftysoweak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"Those priests you speak of don't represent the whole of their or any religion, in any group you're always going to have people who don't always have good intentions, but their actions don't discredit or speak for others in that religious group for example saying all atheists are criminals just because few atheists were  caught in the act doesn't speak for the others. God did create everything from the heavens to everything we know and see on earth, God created man and from man he created the woman. When a man and a woman marry each other they are making vows to one another and ultimately they are making their vows before God in the honorable way God intended for it to be done. Homosexuality is a demonically inspired abomination to Gods plan for his people. God isn't a fool he can't be tricked when he looks at people he looks at their true motives or intentions in what they do, nothing is hidden from God. That's true no man is without sin, in fact sin is our nature as humans but God is a forgiving God when we as people do wrong he wants us to repent our sin and resist and/or turn away from the wrong that we were doing for example if you're addicted to porn God would want you to repent and turn away from porn and resist those temptations and that applies to every struggle in the daily lives of people everywhere. God is always willing to forgive and offer second chances, but like I said God looks at your true intentions and motives and he can't be fooled."

All you have to do so he forgives you is go in to a church, confess to a stranger and do some stupid chant a fee times and bam! All is forgiven my the magic beard man. Quite simple.  And BTW if you think homosexuality is a sin, then you know hate is. Love thy neighbor. If god created everything, he created masturbation, homosexuality, and abortions. You can just give him credit for the good stuff and leave out the bad. Unless you suggest the devil made things as well. In that case you're saying the devil is as powerful as god. But only god can create right? Your religion has killed millions in the name of god. Innocent children are raped by these holy men. Salem witch hunts? You guessed it, religious. Gods loves all his creatures. And you bet he made gay people."
NoFapChristians,3du8wj,leftysoweak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:50:17 2015 UTC,"""All you have to do so he forgives you is go in to a church, confess to a stranger and do some stupid chant a fee times and bam! All is forgiven"". confessions to a ""stranger"" or priest are part of the catholic religion. In Christianity we confess our sin to the Lord when we ask for forgiveness which can be done anywhere at any time. Homosexuality is a sin the Bible refers to it as an abomination it's satans'attempt to twist and pervert the purity of what God intended between a man and a woman. The Bible says we should ""Love the sinner, but hate the sin"" meaning love the person, but hate the sin and evil that they do. The Devil creates nothing but the lies he tells, his goal is and always has been to try to twist and pervert the pure things God created. In the old days and even today satanic devil worshipping cults, pagans, witches, wizards, and covens use human sacrifices adults or infants as homage or tribute to Satan which in essence is what abortion is. when God creates life or anything pure satan tries to pervert and destroy it. Satan has no power like God he only has the same lies and tricks he's be using to manipulate, seduce, tempt, and entice people for centuries. Instead of making us robots God gave us all free will, and he created us above the animals and gave us the intelligence to know the difference between right and wrong, the ability to make our own choices, so all the battles waged in the name of Christianity you're speaking of were not a result of Gods command it was the result of humans making their own decisions. God deals with people individually and can see the pure good intentioned well motived people, and he can see the fake imposters that pretend to be pure of motive, but ultimately have dark intentions and motives. people can fool people, but people can't fool God."
NoFapChristians,3du8wj,leftysoweak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"But if the devil can cause people to have kids out of wedlock and kill, he is almost as powerful as God? And if all you have to do is ask god for forgiveness, you're suddenly allowed into heaven? Just by speaking out loud whole on your knees allows you into heaven? So I can go my whole life murdering people and masturbating but as long as I ask for forgiveness, I'm home free? If being gay is a sin,  god sucks pretty bad at preventing sin. And god didn't want us to be bots? Then why are people expected to devote all of life to the big guy? Why is all we do just to die and go to heaven? Why is it that if a man marrying a man because he loves this man a sin? Why is it okay for a Christian man to beat his wife? A lot of men and women get married simply because ""god"" expects it from them? I know married people who hate one another.  Both straight and gay. But if a man truly loves another man, why can't they be married? Because some magic guy in the clouds says no? Oh wait God didn't write the Bible, MEN DID. Corruptible and free willed men. Men who lived thousands of years ago. You think people weren't gay then? Some animals are gay. Naturally. Will dogs,  cats, and monkeys not go to heaven because they aren't married to the females they procreate with? Your logic makes no sense. You cannot see god. You cannot feel him or hear him. You believing that this guy in the sky is against masturbating is absolutely stupid. If someone said to you that a giant lizard creature from the sky said scratching an itch is against his way and that it's wrong would you believe him?"
NoFapChristians,3du8wj,leftysoweak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"The devil is small potatoes. satan doesn't create, he lies and manipulates he knows where we as people are vulnerable and he targets those vulnerabilities whether it be lust of the flesh, gambling, adultery, fornication, etc.  when he tries turn people away from God which is his main goal. Like I previously stated God gave us the ability to know the difference between right and wrong, and with that God gave us the ability to make choices based on those two principles. When satan tempts someone to cheat, steal, attack,etc. anyone or anything we have a choice we could give in to evil desires of the flesh or, we could resist and turn away from those desires or temptations, everything is a choice. You say ""god sucks pretty bad at preventing sin"" God isn't an authoritarian dictator he doesn't force people to believe in his teaching or him for that matter he gave us free choice so you could choose to be Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or atheist, etc.. Like any multiple choice test there is only one right answer and that is God whether you believe it or not is up to you. Homosexuality doesn't apply to animals because they God didn't give them the intelligence to know what is right and what is wrong they are stuck in to their base instincts. For human beings which God made above animals homosexuality in any form is an direct affront to what God has designed for a man and woman, and if they don't choose to repent and turn away from their sinful ways then ultimately their decision will earn them a place in hell which is what satan wants for all of us. You say "" You cannot see god"" and that's true, but to that I say you cant hear or see gravity, but doesn't mean it isn't there."

Many years ago I fapped, lost a 40 day streak. That night I did not feel Gods presense...I knew I sinned and I felt as if God walked away. I saw faces in my sleep shaking their head very rapidly, I felt the presence of demons...it was reallly scary. I also suffer from sleep paralysis, and this happens when I am stressed...and that night I was stressed, so I don't know if they were really demons or just my sleep paralysis.  What did you feel?"

NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:46:19 2015 UTC,Yes my first post. I started in the /r/StopGaming group 2 days ago and decided I need to stop fapping as well. No my wife doesn't about it. I thought of telling her when I'm fully healed. For now I am with a support group to help each other fight this battle.
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,0,Sun Jul 19 05:04:30 2015 UTC,"Since you posted in NoFapChristiana, I'm going to make the assumption that you are a Christian.   I'm not sure what to say, because this is something I'm really passionate about I, and I tend to come off as harsh.   But I firmly believe God isn't going to let you fully overcome this without you telling your wife first. This sin is also against her and because you two are one in marriage, it affects her deeply.   My husband confessing to me is the best thing that has ever happened to our marriage so far.   Furthermore, there is no ""fully healed"". This is something you will probably be tempted by and deal with on some level your whole life. My husband has been completely clean for a year, and he still gets pornographic dreams. I know others who have been clean for much longer than that and still struggle occasionally.   Look,I know its hard. Because you have sexual addiction in your marriage, your marriage is already broken. Confessing doesn't break it more, it just brings those cracks to the surface where you two can deal with them in the light of Christ.   This is something I wrote, and I hope you both will find it valuable. Bit.ly/letterforchristianwomen"
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,2,Sun Jul 19 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. But I might try it differently this time. I'll get back to you when it doesn't work. I'm giving myself 3-6months of hard mode. Otherwise, if I fail I guess I'll have to try your tip."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"Do you know what hard mode is? I'm not trying to be offensive here - it's just that in this subreddit it's defined as no sex at all, and I'm interested to see how you explain that to your wife.   See my post above to EvilAbed1 - this is not a mere 'tip'."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,2,Sun Jul 19 17:57:34 2015 UTC,Sorry I thought I read hard mode was no fapping and porn and sex within marriage is fine. No offense taken but I would consider it as a tip since there is no biblical scripture saying that it is the one size fits all solution.   Anyway whatever it is I will commit on a life that is pleasing with the Lord whatever it is called here.  Also I do believe that someone can be fully healed. Any wound can be healed I dont think wounds in the heart does not do the same. There are scars yes you remember the battle yes but you have overcome it. I'm hopeful God will do the impossible in my life because he has done in a lot of men I know. Don't give your husband a discouragement by telling him that he can't be fully healed because that will lose his hope in having goals and ambitions to be whole again. I guess that is why he is still struglling today as you have mentioned.
NoFapChristians,3dra23,EvilAbed1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:44 2015 UTC,I've said my piece and all I can do now is hope and pray that God will convict your heart.   I forgive you for the hurtful things you have said to me.   I'll also be praying for your wife to be strong when you do tell her and that she will be understanding and forgiving.
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,2,Mon Jul 20 11:41:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry for that. No offense meant, really. In the end people are different what may work for you and your husband may not necessarily work for other people. I just thought that if the roles have been reversed and my wife is having the addiction not me, to be honest I cannot do anything to help her. I can nag the entire day and remind her that porn/masturbation is bad thing whether I like it or not she can still create opportunities to do her secret sin. She has to deal it with herself because she can hide from me."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,EvilAbed1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"See, and that's where I think you have been mislead. There is a lot she can do for you. She can pray with you and for you. There is SO much power in a righteous person's prayer! You two will build a new intimacy you've never had or imagined before because of the secrets you've been hiding. And oh man - that intimacy is glorious. You think you have it now, but you cannot possibly have this great depth of intimacy that I describe with this sin and secret on your back.   Sure, it's hard and there's a lot to rebuild. And it is possible that you might lose her. (Although, I would wager that probability is much higher if she discovers it rather than you telling her). I won't lie - it was really hard for several months. I nagged some and didn't always handle things well. But I prayed, hard and often. We prayed together and studied scripture together like never before.   After my husband told me, one of the first things I asked was why he didn't tell me sooner. We could have avoided a lot of heartbreak and pain. My husband could have waited to tell me I suppose until he was more recovered - and God would have worked through that too, but am I so glad he didn't. We get to walk through this together. Satan is trying hard to destroy your marriage by attacking you, and you are trying to fight it without your battle partner at your side.  Sure, you could tell her and still do it in secret. Confession is not a cure-all and I never said it was. But it is entirely possible that God won't allow breakthrough until sin is confessed against the person whom it has hurt the most. Think of the Israelites who kept losing their battles because someone in their camp had disobeyed God. Joshua 7-9.   Now, I actually don't believe in having your wife as a primary accountability partner and I don't believe that you should confess every time you fall to her. That is something that does little good. What does do good is her being aware and giving her the opportunity to heal from what has broken her.    I don't know if you know this - but the guy who was responding above in affirmation of waiting to confess is not married, so I would be cautious in listening to what he has to say. Marriage (as I'm sure you know) is one of those things you don't truly understand until you're in it. I may give advice to parents even though I don't have kids, but I give it in full understanding that I am in ignorance of what they're going through. When it comes down to it, wisdom is found in experience, which is what I am offering you."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,2,Tue Jul 21 02:15:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm glad it has worked for you and your husband. I don't want to keep this to myself neither. I'll just try a different route with this for now.  EDIT: I agree with EvilAbed1.
NoFapChristians,3dra23,EvilAbed1,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:20 2015 UTC,"Is there a Biblical basis for your firm belief that God won't let him fully overcome his issue without telling his wife? Because the experience you and your husband had is not the same experience everyone would have. Sorry if that seems rude or like I'm a jerk but I feel there are so many factors that go into that decision. You have a husband that is an addict in more than one way, I have to believe your more patient and more understanding than most women in this world. From what I have seen many women are not that way.   If your serious about stopping and you have the support of men who are able and willing to keep you accountable telling your wife can only complicate things. The stress over coming addiction is greatly multiplied when you struggle and every failure directly hurts someone you care about. On the surface you'll think it will motivate you but it's an addiction.   With your wife knowing of the struggle you will still struggle but you'll experience the heartache of seeing her hurt by the actions you desperately want to control.   Get a group of like minded men together, get an accountability software, talk to a pastor, ""Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you"". James 4:7"
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:16:18 2015 UTC,"Marriage is my reasoning. God makes us one when you are married. What my husband struggles with affects me. What I struggle with affects my husband. Having any part of your life a secret in marriage is a barrier for intimacy.  My wording was probably incorrect in that he won't overcome  - but OP's marriage cannot be reconciled and restored without confession. Which means that the addiction, the secret that he holds, still has a hold on a portion of his life.  Sure, other women may not have the patience and understanding that I do (well, have learned through this process). However - that doesn't mean they don't deserve to be told and that they can't learn patience and understanding. Not confessing to your wife a sin that you have committed against her is another sin unto itself.  ""I can do it without her; I'm protecting her; I don't want to lose her.""   Sure, maybe you can do it without her, but that's pretty prideful of you to say. You're not protecting her! You're not even protecting your marriage from sexual purity! And quite frankly, you need to own up to the fact that you deserve to lose her and it's only by God's grace that you haven't. You have the chance here to confess, rather than her finding out second hand and it being a whole heck of a lot worse.  God can't fix what you haven't brought into the light. Again, Satan doesn't want you to tell her, he wins!  I would rather someone lose their marriage because they were righteous to confess than to keep a woman in a marriage of deceit."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,EvilAbed1,2,Sun Jul 19 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"Marriage is my reasoning. God makes us one when you are married.   That isn't a biblical basis for saying that God will not allow you to overcome the sin of pornography until you confess the sin to your wife.   What my husband struggles with affects me. What I struggle with affects my husband.   Some of the effects of your husbands hidden behavior affect you. When the struggle is known it has a far greater impact on the life of the other person.   but OP's marriage cannot be reconciled and restored without confession.    OP's marriage also cannot be reconciled and restored while he continues in this sin, Confession alone doesn't reconcile or restore anything. He has to confess and repent for reconciliation. Confession before repentance leaves OP in the same place as Repentance before confession. Both need to be accomplished for reconciliation, regardless of the order they are accomplished in.   Which means that the addiction, the secret that he holds, still has a hold on a portion of his life.   The secret he holds still has a hold on a portion of his life. So does pornography....  I would like to point out that I never said he shouldn't confess ever.    that doesn't mean they don't deserve to be told and that they can't learn patience and understanding.   What? no one is telling them that.   Sure, maybe you can do it without her, but that's pretty prideful of you to say.   actually it isn't but saying that your husband can't overcome an addiction without you or that a husband cannot over come an addiction without his wife is very prideful. Your husband overcame addiction by the grace of God. In my first post I told OP that he should have a support system in place. To say that a man, his support system, and God are not equipped to overcome addiction without his wife is just about as prideful as it gets.   If OP decides to not tell his wife and to depend on The Lord and his support group he is acting humbly. He has admitted that he is incapable of overcoming his sin and has turned to a support group that is not emotionally attached and to the only being capable of changing his  heart.   Addiction in most cases happens when a person turns to something to deal with stress or depression. What they turn to causes a change in brain chemistry that relieves stress and depression temporarily.   Addiction is treated by removing what the person is addicted too, reducing stress, and learning healthy coping strategies. No read this:    You're not protecting her! You're not even protecting your marriage from sexual purity! And quite frankly, you need to own up to the fact that you deserve to lose her and it's only by God's grace that you haven't.    This is exactly what a man who has had his coping device taking away from should not hear especially from someone they love. OP is aware of the consequences of his actions, without pornography his brain chemistry is his enemy at least for some time. Hearing these things, watching your wife's reactions, when you have tried desperately to stop, struggled for long periods of time, have had your self-esteem ravished by your addiction, your faith in God affected and all you want is to stop is not only unnecessary but incredibly harmful.  Without porn the dopamine levels in your brain will be lower than you are used to. You will be stressed and depressed, now add hearing things like that to your already depressed state. You should not have this discussion or deal with these things with inefficient dopamine levels because it will harm you emotionally more then usual. Besides that, it increases the likely hood of relapse, now what good is that?  Being told you deserve to lose her is not biblical and if there was ever a time a person was going to crumble and turn to unhealthy coping methods it is when his wife suggests that she should, could, might, or would be right to leave you. What she says out of hurt or out of anger will increase your temptation to sin and prolong the recovery process.    God can't fix what you haven't brought into the light.    First of all yes he can! God does not have limitations on what can do. God created the universe but this dudes sin can only be beaten if he makes God aware of it?   Second he is bringing it into the light. He is telling his community and God. He can tell his wife at a point where it will be easier for him and for her to handle it.    I would rather someone lose their marriage because they were righteous to confess than to keep a woman in a marriage of deceit.   Then praise God your preferences have no impact on the situation. You keep bring up lose of marriage, you know that the Bible condemns divorce? You also keep acting as if he needs to confess this moment or he will not be able too. The two options you listed are not the only two possible. He could overcome addiction and confess his addiction to his wife. That isn't deceitful.  When wrestling with repetitive sin you're only goal should be to kill sin. Confession apart from repentance is worthless. Increasing the stressors in your life while struggling with a sin that is not just hard to overcome but has rewired your brain so that you turn to that sin when you are stressed is counter productive and unnecessary.   The issue here is the sin, if anyone tries to tell you the issue is not telling your wife immediately ignore them. It is not a Biblical command, it is illogical if you have a basic understanding of addiction, and what you owe your wife is confession and repentance neither of which do here good alone."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:49 2015 UTC,"You're not even married - what right do you have to even comment on any of this? What do you know of marriage? What do you know of sexual addiction within marriage? Have you had your marriage on the edge of divorce because of unconfessed sin? What do you know of what happens when there is confession of sexual sin within a marriage?  Don't be the fool who ignores and even argues against the wisdom of those who have been there before. That's also in the Bible.   Yes - the Bible condemns divorce, but divorce is allowed when the marriage covenant is broken by way of sexual infidelity. Matthew 5, Jesus says that a notice of divorce can be given for sexual infidelity, which masturbation to pornography, is part of. So yes, he deserves to lose her. It is by God's grace that his wife hopefully won't. My husband will say that he deserved to lose me.  Yes - confession is a biblical command - James 5: 16 ""Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.""   Now I get you might argue that he has confessed here and he has confessed to other men in a support group - what good does it do to confess to your wife?   I gather that OP is repentant because he has posted here. So repentance (which I'm not sure why you brought up when it is quite obvious that he is repentant) is not the issue. So, if we have repentance, why shouldn't he confess? Your reasoning above about the stressors and dopamine, while it might seem logical, does not stand up in the face of reality and the power of God. You act as if OP will have to relapse if he encounters stress. Again - You know nothing about it. My husband does though, and he would absolutely tell you and every other man he meets that the sooner you confess the sooner your marriage has the possibility of being restored. And restoration goes a long way in helping a porn addiction."
NoFapChristians,3dra23,hopefulwife,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"what right do you have to even comment on any of this?   This is a public forum.   what do you know of what happens when there is confession of sexual sin within a marriage?   Let me get this straight, you are saying that I do not know what would happen when a person husband confesses his sexual sin to his wife because I have not experienced it? And you do know because you have experienced it? That would suggest the only way to know is to experience it and if that is the case you only have one example of it going as you have described. Which is hardly enough evidence to shift anyone's opinion.   So experience vs. inexperience isn't the issue. I a have observed humanity long enough to know that not all women respond positively to their husbands confession of sexual sin.   Understanding people and observing the world around you provides enough evidence for someone to accurately say that there is a good chance that a women may become upset when this sin is confessed.  The idea that you must be married to understand this topic is as senseless as the idea that God ""can't"" kill sexual sin in a mans heart until he tells his wife. Neither claim has an evidence to support it. If there was a biblical basis or a logical basis for your claims you would not need to bring my martial status into the the discussion.    don't be the fool who ignores and even argues against the wisdom of those who have been there before. That's also in the Bible.    I have studied theology and ministry in a one on one environment. My ideas are the result of education and contemplation. I hold the wisdom of the man with a PhD very highly. I do not abandon reason and logic or what I have learned from him and from others because a women on the internet who is married disagrees; if you know of a Bible verses that says I should please share it.   Jesus says that a notice of divorce can be given for sexual infidelity, which masterbation to pornography, is part of.     No it isn't.   Let's just say your right, it is the combination of masterbation and pornography that is adulterous? Masterbation alone isn't adultery and neither is pornography, but when you combined the two you have infidelity?  Pornography is a sin, and masterbation is often a sin. Neither of them or the combination are equal to extramarital sex. Your claim is dramatic but not biblical.    so yes, he deserves to lose her.   No! When we speak we must be careful with our words, we should be even more diligent with God's Word. Read Mathew 19:8 and you will see that Jesus says nothing about someone deserving divorce. All he has said is divorce is permissible, he didn't even prescribe divorce in cases of infidelity. Meaning it isn't even a command, you may choose to divorce an adulteress. It is not a sin to do so or not do so. Just because infidelity makes divorce permissible does not necessarily make it deserved.   Also, Christians our most joyous thanks are given to God because he won't give us the hell we deserve. Even if divorce is deserved forgiveness is the preferred route.    confession is a biblical command    I know that.....  If you read what I wrote you would see that I clearly expressed a need for confession.    (not sure why you brought up when it is quite obvious that he is repentant)    No, it is obvious that he has not repented. Repentance isn't acknowledging that you have done wrong. The word metanoia is the Greek word used in the original language. Metanoia means change of heart or turning away. Repentance as apology or feeling regret is a modern understanding and unbiblical. God wants you to repent (turn away from) of your sin and turn to Christ to Christ. He does not want you to feel bad about what you did and turn to Christ. Feeling remorse and continuing to sin isn't repentance. Even if the command was to feel remorse for sin someone OP wouldn't have achieved it yet. How remorseful can someone be if they continue to do the deed?  It is wise to repent, to cease the sin and then confess to his wife.    your reasoning above about the stressors and dopamine, while it might seem logical, does not stand up in the face of reality and the power of God.    It is logical. Your view of God has me confused. God cannot, he is limited and unable to heal sin without a man confessing to his wife first. However if he confesses to his wife science and logic cannot with stand the power of God. That's what your trying to tell me?   God can do anything, he has no limits. He can heal a man keeping secrets from his wife. He can heal a man who's honest with his wife even if his wife hates him.   So the question becomes do you want to be healed and confess to your wife when you have made substantial progress in your goals?   Or do you want to tell your wife, risk greater temptation, risk adding emotional pain that should be avoided during recover, and still be healed.   The point is both are possible, one is easier, more successful, reasonable, and equally Biblical. you are promoting a more difficult, less successful, and equally biblical method. Which is unreasonable.    you act as if OP will have to relapse if he encounters stress.    No I don't.  I very clearly said that increase stress increases the likelihood of relapse. That is a fact.   you know nothing about it   Yes I do.   I understand sin from a biblical perspective and addiction from a scientific perspective. When someone cannot defend their position with reason and logic they attack the person providing the alternative positions credibility.   We are seeing this here, my position makes more sense. You are now drawing attention away from what I am saying and by directing attention to who is saying it.    my husband does though, and he would absolutely tell you and every other man he meets that the sooner you confess the sooner your marriage has the possibility of being restored.    If all information on this topic has to come from experience, which must be the case because you say I know nothing about the topic since I have not lived it. Then your husband has no reason to suggest that the sooner you confess the sooner restoration happens. His experience is limited, his result cannot be consider the results for everyone.   That last paragraph was just me driving home the point that your experience alone theory is incorrect.   If your husband approached me and said that to me I would say I disagree entirely. I would remind him that his experiences cannot be expected to be replicated in trials carried out by someone else in different circumstances.   This entire thing was done on Mobile please excuse any grammar or spelling errors."

You need to have a more personal relationship with Jesus. You need to read the Bible more, pray more, fast more, etc. The closer you draw to Jesus the more you learn to depend on Him and the more confident and faithful you feel that He will help you. Remember that Jesus is ALWAYS there with you. You just need to call out to Him and have FAITH and BELIEVE that He will follow through and help you. Fasting is a great way to bring you closer to Him. The more you weaken the flesh the less controlled you are by it. Remember  ""This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."" -Galatians 5:16  When you fast, you start to focus less on your flesh and more on the spirit which helps you get closer to God. Praying and reading the Bible is also a great thing to do when you fast as well. Stay strong brother and remember that  ""And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."" -Romans 8:28.

With dying to self i mean not to pmo even if your flesh bombards you with temptation. I think this is a question about motivation and knowing truth. Because truth sets free but its always a death to self when you choose to not give into it. My advice is studying the bible and asking god to show to you what it means and i would give the advice to remind yourself of truth that sets free.   For me, i know that im free because he has shown me the truth to be free and i have found out that it isnt that rewarding to give into it, also i found out that im his, that he is for me with it and i dont have to get rid of it, to be with him. He is not disgusted with me and he is my daddy, who loves me and helps me with problems and isnt wanting something from me. Knowing these truth sets me free. Im free since the 120 days and i knew on day 1 that im free. Its the first time i ever thought that and this was my last one, im free.

NoFapChristians,3dl2o7,MYUTMOST,2,Fri Jul 17 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel my friend. We want so badly to forsake this sin and love Christ... but our will is not as strong as we thought it was.  May this encourage you tonight.  The following is a comment I made to someone here on this forum. My intent was to show this person the Gospel:  ""You talk as if you have let God down. Yes, sin gets in the way of our relationship with God. But that is why Jesus came to earth.  2nd Corinthians 5:21- ""God made him who knew no sin (Jesus) to become sin so that we could have the righteousness of God"".   You stand before God right now, lustfull, wicked heart and all, and you are seen as righteous. Without sin. Why? Because all of your sin was placed on Jesus. Thus, all the punishment you deserved because of your sin was placed on Jesus. Hence why the cross was so bloody. That wrath God had towards you was poured out on Christ. He took your place.  So now, there is nothing but fatherly love. In no way does God want you to sin. He hates sin. He abhors sin. But you, Christian, are not to earn God's love. That love could not be earned by you or your good deeds. It was earned by Christ and Christ alone taking your sins away and giving your righteousness. You are clean because of Him. You don't have to earn His love! He isn't waiting for you to get your fapping problem or porn problem together before he loves you. He loves you NOW! He doesn't love a future, better version of you. He loves you NOW! Fight porn with that. You go to porn for pleasure. Time and time again you get pissed because it does not offer the pleasure that it says it will. Go to Christ! There is pleasure that will satisfy! That is what he means when he says he is the true living water. Drink of Him and you will never thirst again!  Let Christ seem, and BE, more pleasurable than porn. Because he is. God loves you man (or woman). Where you are. Now. As you struggle. He is walking with you."""
NoFapChristians,3dkm05,Beastmodehulk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:00:24 2015 UTC,Don't give up! God doesn't give you more than He knows you can handle. Call on the Lord when you need Him. Sometimes God wants us to get to that point when we don't have any more strength or when we feel that we can't do anything on our own. This is because God wants us to rely on Him and ask Him for the strength to overcome the adversities or challenges that we face. He wants us to know that He is the only reason why we are able to overcome such great obstacles so that we give Him the glory. Remember we all go through trials and tests for a reason. You have to go through the test to have a testimony. When you make it out of a test you can go back and help other brothers and sisters overcome the same adversities that you faced. God is good. Make Him the center of you life and all will be well. Jesus bless you.

I took a communications class last year and I thought about choosing this topic but I was too afraid which is silly when I think about it because I should've relied more on God. But don't be discouraged that you only got 3 responses! Hey the truth hurts sometimes but it still needs to get out there! I pray the Lord helps you break free from this porn addiction and any other things that are holding you back. I also pray that He blesses this presentation and that He helps you speak and helps open the audience's hearts to the truth. Jesus bless you :)

I had some counseling in the first month or two after my brother was killed, but since not much of anything - I rarely talk about it and then even then only with my best friend and occasionally my sister. Sometimes I share it with my testimony but usually I try not to talk about it.   Are you talking more along the lines of an actual counselor or a pastor/elder?"

When you're tempted call on His name and ask for strength and guidance. Ask Him to deliver you from temptation. If you walk in the spirit you won't satisfy the lusts of the flesh. Keep your mind on Jesus and make Him the center of your life. The closer you get to Him by fasting, prayer, reading His word, worship etc. then the more confident you feel in what God is really capable of doing. With God NOTHING is impossible. Remember that.  ""For with God nothing shall be impossible."" -Luke 1:37  Here's a video for a little inspiration. Jesus loves you more than you can ever imagine.

Lust is a poor, weak, whimpering, whispering thing compared with that richness and energy of desire which will arise when lust has been killed."" CS Lewis"
NoFapChristians,3dh0v8,lankydutchman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. I get this.  I just posted elsewhere about what God does ""to"" us by way of consequences for our stuff.  But don't forget to recognize that you can't figure God out. You can obey Him. That should be enough. Sometimes all the mental gymnastics we go through in trying to figure him out become a delay-tactic for simple obedience.  For example, what do you masturbate to? How can you eliminate that possibility? Do you really want to? My guess is prior to me asking this question the answer was ""no, not really. I don't really want to stop.""  I know when I'm ready to stop: I go to all lengths to remove the temptation and I bring others into the conversation between me and my sin.  For example, the other night I had just relapsed and was thinking about going for it again when I noticed one of my good friends called. I decided to call him back and confess to him over the phone--he knows my struggle and we've prayed together about this before. It totally sucked, and believe me, it took the wind out of the sails of wanting to act out again in self-gratification. I went straight to bed like a responsible person. Imagine that.  So, good job posting, but you've got some thinking to do. Feel free to post your plan here to get rid of this thing.  We're cheering for you, praying with you.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

NoFapChristians,3dgo8q,DeerStag,3,Thu Jul 16 03:10:40 2015 UTC,Why do you think God deems lust sinful? Is there a logical reason behind it?
NoFapChristians,3dgo8q,DJ_Pace,4,Thu Jul 16 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"God has never done anything arbitrarily. The more I study his word, the more I realize this is the absolute truth. Do you think your life has been served well by lust? I doubt anyone here on NoFap or NoFapChristians can honestly say that lust hasn't been detrimental to them. God understands his creation and he understands their weaknesses. Remember, he walked the earth as one of us and was subject to every temptation we faced.  I think a big problem that many non-christians have is one of faulty thinking. They think that whatever makes them feel good in the moment, must by extension, be good. God sees much more than we can and he knows that lust will, in the end, damage us. I think of lust as a perversion of the ordained physical bonding between a man and wife.  I have thought, studied and prayed quite a bit about this and I could go deeper but i think that, by and large, God abhors lust because it is bad for his children."
NoFapChristians,3dgo8q,StealthJones27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would agree completely!"
NoFapChristians,3dgo8q,DJ_Pace,4,Thu Jul 16 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"Lust is not just sexual desire. Lust uses your partner as a vessel for your own pleasure, an object of appetite. It doesn't inherently have respect or love for the partner. It just uses that person to satisfy themselves. It's thus sinful.  Sexual desire is a biological impulse when used through love has respect and service to your partner. It makes the sexual act not about satisfying your own lust but as a physical expression of love and your relationship, two souls unified and whatnot."
NoFapChristians,3dgo8q,jfolstrp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:02:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for differentiating the terms a bit more. I think I can picture the difference between lust and love way better. :)

NoFapChristians,3dg6mu,Blueaugustine,2,Thu Jul 16 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you pursuing this line of thinking--natural consequences of PMO relapses, and the emotional echo that results in a disordered, rebellious life, are important to consider.  But also consider that when God moves us out of situations such as the one you may be moved out of, HE does so for reasons that go beyond what we can fathom; the depths of God are impossible to plumb. You may find, if in fact you're terminated, that that environment was toxic to you from a spiritual standpoint; or that it was holding back your career because you were becoming such a sycophant; or that your ""disease"" of sinful and lustful rebellion was actually causing you to operate on the basis of the fear of man, not the fear of God, which in fact is the ultimate downer for upward progress in usefulness to God in this world.  So there's lots of possible layers to consider, not just God disciplining you or you reaping the consequences (so-called) of your sin.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

The competing explanation that I am believing is that God allows consequences to befall me for my behavior. Yes, he intercedes in some areas, he doesn't in others - at least as far as I can tell. He does what he does on his own will. I think he is leaving a lot up to me to do, but he is right here with me helping me, guiding me, advising me, consoling and comforting me."

On the other a flesh desire that ignores all of things we ought to do, and do sinful things anyway.   The way I see it is this :  We are at war with our flesh. We cannot serve both God and Mammon.One always takes over.   Bro, if you truly believe in Jesus- and that he saved you from all your sins , you are no longer a slave. You can say no to your former slave master, Satan.   The problem is, you have been a slave to sin for so long- that even when you are free, you are scared to talk back, or to fight against your former master. But you need to know , your real master now is Jesus- and he has your back.  So tell your former slave master to shut his ugly face, and fight back.   You need to fight."

I pray to God for the transformation of my mind.  For me, past images triggering me have become a rarer and rarer occurrence over the last year.    But, I will say, in my more recent relapses in the past 6 months, I went to the hard-drive in my brain trying to bring back the filth that God had been cleansing me of before ultimately relapsing.  I wouldn't say it was the memories that attracted me (my memories are full of shame and regret), I very much could have and should have kept my guard, but more-so that I became indifferent, drifting from God towards the secular world and all its desires and passions.  Anyways, I would appreciate prayers, I just prayed for you"
NoFapChristians,3den8o,new_life55,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"Love this question. I'm not sure I like the distinction. Let me explain.  ""Urges"" as I think you're defining them are present-tense, in the moment temptations. ""Memories"" as you're defining them, I think, refer to past temptations, things from days, weeks, months, or years ago.  As I see it, ""urges"" are temptations to sin. And the Enemy, and the world, and our own flesh--primarily the latter, in my own experience--uses whatever ""urges"" or desires it will to bring me to a point of rebelling against God.  So, that's normally a combination of things:      urges to be bored.   urges to sleep in.   urges to become angry unnecessarily   urges to anxiety   urges to recall a time when I was ""happy"" or ""felt good.""   urges to explore some pathway that I know in my soul is dangerous.   urges to lie, cheat, steal, or otherwise defraud my neighbor of what is rightfully his/hers before God.   urges to listen to my own conscience accusing, defending me, rather than to the Holy Spirit, my Advocate and Counselor, and what He has to say about my soul.   So memories are one tool used by the devil, but its often a cocktail of tools: memories, plus physical discomfort, mental anguish, and a present- and in-the-moment so-called ""opportunity for sexual sin"" that is the downfall.  Now, blessed are we who know if we in fact do.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."
NoFapChristians,3den8o,Blueaugustine,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I meant. Maybe I wasn't clear enough. I think memories are the basis sometimes. What I'm referring to is when I'm alone and feel the urge sometimes it's more of a feeling of ""Hey, remember when you used to do this when you were alone?""  That's where it starts for me sometimes. I don't always set out to do it, it just comes to mind. You make very valid points, a lot to think about. No matter what it is, I pray through it and ask for strength to resist."

I always make it a point to describe realistically the events of a relapse. You've got to face the problem if you're serious about wanting to defeat it. Anonymity is not going to help. If you're serious, you need a program like Covenant Eyes ($6/mo) as a deterrent. You need a real life accountability partner if you really want to stop.  I've been honest with a few Christian brothers about my addiction and only been met with support. It's such a common issue that you're liking speaking to someone with the same problem. Contact someone that you trust and ask them to be your account admin on Covenant Eyes. I don't get paid to push this, it's just so cheap that if you're serious about change you can't afford not to have it. Take a moment of courage to blurt out your issue and change your life forever."

I assume, while immodest, it's still considered ""decent"" by modern standards... i.e. she'd be comfortable going out like that? If not... If this is because she's ""home"" and she is more modest when going out, I'd encourage you to challenge her on that. After all - she's a guest common areas should be treated as public spaces. But if it's just the run of the mill, way too suggestive clothing that's pervasive among teens/college aged women, I don't know what to say.  Stay strong, the gospel could help her, but don't expect anything to change overnight. Find different ways of dealing with this new temptation. Maybe it means more time out of the apartment for now."

NoFapChristians,3d61c1,Otterbox1,6,Mon Jul 13 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"I'm almost scared of myself, and of my own ability to break my promise to the Lord.     ""Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No ,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one"" (Matthew 5:33-37).  Understand that making a promise to God to never sin again is a promise we cannot trust our-self to keep, you are right.  Praise God for your continual victory over sin, but let your abstinence from sin lead you to a greater trust and understanding of the Lord.    We have broken our end of the bargain.  God is faithful and just, and he will always keep his end of the bargain.  Which is summarriazed in Romans 8:1, ""there is, therefore now, no condemnation for those in Christ"".  and 1 Thessalonians 5:23, ""Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."".

I have to say that I let go of my support  lines a couple of months back at 119 days.It was quite subtle and surprisingly sudden but in retrospect,I look back and realize the  end-results were both stunning and final...within minutes I found myself aghast by being INSTANTLY back at day one.By God's grace,I was delivered from the temptation to binge but the soul-searching which followed my 4 month streak was painfully mind-numbing and humbling.  SO,Otterbox1,congratz on you 4 months,girl! You are looking at a whole half a year,you know...in NoFap-Land,that is a life-time!Several life-times,lol!

NoFapChristians,3d6jj5,_jamesgary,3,Mon Jul 13 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"Welcome James! Super glad you're here. It's a great step.   I'm the wife of an addict. I want to humbly ask you to take a break from your girlfriend. Dating leads to marriage (at least, I hope that's how you are approaching it) and if you are struggling with this, then you need to ask God if you are really in a position to be dating a woman.   I suggest this partially because it's difficult to both recover and keep a relationship together. You need to focus on this with all your might, and having a girlfriend can be both a distraction and a temptation. As you wrestle with losing your current outlet for sexual urges, it can be very tempting to turn them on her.  Personally, as a girlfriend, I wish my husband had said that he wasn't ready to date and worked on himself rather than putting us through what he did. Waiting would have been worth it.  The other reason I say this is because of experience. Because my husband selfishly kept me in the dark throughout our dating, engagement, and even first year of marriage, we have had some unnecessarily rough times. He hurt me far more than necessary because he didn't get himself under control before entering a relationship.   Talk to God what you should do - either way NoFapChristians is here to help!   Also ...I honestly don't recommend confessing to your girlfriend as some might suggest here. This sin is against your future wife, who may or may not be her. I can detail my thoughts on this more if you'd like, but I don't want to give you too much of a wall of text.  Again, We are really glad you're here. God is going to do a great work in your life through you."

And yes, including the calling.  God calls every human soul to repentance in faith, and he has a plan in mind for every human soul.  Maybe we are misguided in what our calling is at times, but God ceretainly created us with talents for good use in His kingdom.    I guess I would ask you why you think quitting pmo is a good thing?  If it is not for God, not for your own health, not to live out your calling, not to fulfill your soul.  You say you are doing it for you, but why?  I guess your language in this post just sounds so contrary to many passages of the Bible, and self-contradicted.

NoFapChristians,3d3sgz,asaph23,2,Mon Jul 13 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"But for a moment, for a few months, I saw a version of me, I would litterally kill to have back.   Would you really kill? Do you really mean that? Or are you just talking? How far are you willing to go to get that goodness back?   In a spiritual sense, you have to kill yourself. This is what 'mortify our bodies' means. To put to death these evil, twisted, wrong desires and instead to live by the spirit. Listen, man, I get the whole 'God is distant' vibe, but even though you might feel that it's true, you're wrong. God is not distant. Jesus' action and love reveals that he is right here right now with you. All thorugh my many relapses, he's been right here beside me, happy I know to know that I'm doing something and still working on this. You might not be the man you thought you were, but I'm pretty sure Jesus is not the man you thought he was, either.  I and you have an alternative, a bank account of protection to start drawing on, even if you can't feel it right now, through the exhilaration of faith. It's going to require you to do something maybe you haven't yet, to risk. But you can do it. Even if it makes no sense, this is what our faith is about, a man who came back from the dead who first came here to tell us how much the creator of the entire universe and ourselves loves us, and that we will not be dead but will live forever if we respond to that.   You have to become a murderer, a murdered. It's evil. This thing inside you is evil, and you have to put it to death. It will hurt. Oh God it will hurt and terrify you immensely like nothing you've ever felt before probably. But getting this out of you, off you, disinfecting ... you will find your health rejuvenating. I remember when I put it to death, it was the most scary thing i ever did. I rejected a girl who was a sure booty call, the sexiest woman I've ever known, who wanted me. Boy did she want me. I rejected her, not knowing what the heck would happen or if i would ever get laid again. ANd a black worm died in me. I spent the next five months insanely trying to bring it back, but that burning lust within me went away, thank God, and that relationship failed thanks to Jesus Christ who calls me and who chose me. It's so shocking to accept. I barely do now. No one ever wnated me my whole life. But he does. How?  Jesus is a healer. Physically, emotionally, spiritually, psychologically ... he is a healer. Just being around him heals. I have had some health scares myself, but he's been here with me the whole way. I know that being in perfect health isn't the point of Christianity, but it's a gift from God nonetheless, something he isn't shy about doing. Paul says that God gave us his own son, what will he hold back from us? Don't believe (cling) to the idea that God let you down physically and that you can't really trust him. I sense that this false belief is at the core of your distrust of him. And that it what is going on: you don't trust him. you don't trust him enough, and i have been doing the same, don't trust him enough to rely on him instead of sexual stimulation in order to deal with character flaws, to feel pain, to risk vulnerability again ...   THankfully, the spirit is right there. Come back to the kingdom, prodigal son. You've wasted your inheritance, but all that he has is yours yet."

Remembering that God is with you always, sees you always, and even knows what you're thinking helps.  It just takes practice to remind yourself since you obviously can't see it going on.  And I always resort to prayer first.  I find it helpful if I separate myself from the situation (going into another room for instance) when I do so.  It's easy to say a quick prayer that lasts five seconds but that'll leave you in the moment when you finish it.  Remove yourself from the situation and get a clean head.

Another thing that has helped me is the ""negative script"": write down how you felt after you last acted out. Anger, disgust, and shame are powerful emotions. Attach them to PMO, and your brain won't be able to pull you as hard. This buys you time when you are tempted, time you can use to cry out to God for help and flee before the balance tips.  Also, I made a habit of firmly saying NO in my head whenever I am tempted. I got the idea from this message. This helps me stop, turn around, and flee before it's too late.  When I am alone and idle and I start to search for random words online, I enter a ""preoccupation stage"" that lasts two or three crucial minutes. An early catch is everything at that point. I have been able to escape that phase by recalling my negative script and telling myself NO."

It's interesting because it's often not (at least for me) as simple as to decide what to do. I so often get overwhelmed by need of entertainment, lazyness etc. that I put aside my ambitions to study a certain subject or achive something that I really would like to achive. A couple of weeks later I sometimes wake up wondering what I've done with my time.  One thing I've realized for myself is that it's helpful to me, when I find something I'd really like to do, to put myself in a position where I'm obliged to do that specific thing. If you, as an example, would like to start write articles, then start by contacting a smaller paper/journal and ask if they'd be interested in you writing for them instead of first trying to produce an article and then find someone who'd like to publish it. That strategy, making sure someone else expect somethings from me, is the best way for me to actually do something. Otherwise it's far too easy to slip back into the entertaintmentditch.  Good luck!"

NoFapChristians,3czrap,RagingMayo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say start with decreasing the chance to fall into temptation, i.e. don't go on your PC without a purpose, if you are used to fapping at your PC. Find the triggers and try to avoid them, i.e. if you are often triggered by pictures and videos on TV, youtube, facebook, etc.. If you start with a badge, don't be discouraged, if you cannot hold the streak longer than a few days. Every moment/day in which you try to lean on the Lord Jesus instead of porn/masturbation is a success!  Just yesterday I told a (Christian) brother from my city that I am addicted to porn. He has or had his problems with porn, too, and once he even openly shared this with many other brothers. He told me that I can write him (on mobile phone) everytime the temptation hits me, and he will pray for me.   You don't need to tell it to your whole church, but finding one brother (or sister, if you are female) who can help you would be a very important step out of this addiction. As soon as you reveal the sin, it loses much of its power. I pray for you and I hope that you can build up the courage to address someone in your church/congregation/etc. with your struggle. Keep on praying and seeking knowledge and wisdom in the bible."

NoFapChristians,3cyj04,Anoian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:38:20 2015 UTC,"That is good to hear :) Too many Christians are lukewarm nowadays. Unfortunately, many are stuck in the mentality where they think that they have a free ticket to heaven just because they accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and they repent here and there. That is not enough. We need to be sold out for Jesus and really live for Him. We need to examine ourselves daily and repent daily to make sure we are living right for Him. Remember He says to pray always that we are seen worthy to escape the things that will come to pass. And these are the times where it is CRUCIAL to get right with the Lord because He is coming back VERY soon. We are the generation to see Him in all His glory! Keep focusing on your relationship with Jesus and make Him the center of your life and everything you do. Jesus bless you!"

I will say that I've been fighting the good fight, and with regard to my counter I did slip ten days ago (MO, no P) which I counted as a victory of sorts. I continue to confess my struggles in RL to APs and to my spouse, and wish that I were stronger by now.  Recently I did confess some of my darkest sins to my spouse and it was difficult, but the advice I was given (keep it general) I didn't follow, I was very specific (though not overly detailed) and it was totally embarrassing to me and to my sin. But in my sin and weakness, I see Him draining the power of my temptations and giving me great hope in the Lord.  Your comment was a real boost to my heart tonight, and I wish I could give you a big hug or high five or whatever, but instead, I'll just pray for you and thank God for sending an angel of mercy to lift my spirits on the ocean of life's troubles today.

While I don't mean to offend or be unduly pugnacious, I feel that there is an endorsement in that group (from what I've read) of abstience without corresponding emotional, mental, and spiritual sanctification; in other words, the Lord requires us not only to be faithful with our sexual bodies but faithful in our sexual minds and feelings / emotions as well.  I also disagree with the label ""Gay Christian"" as the primary identity I believe we are called to is ""in the Lord"" and nothing else. Anything else that we allow to define ourselves can easily (maybe always?) become an idol. ""Jesus and my marriage"" or ""Jesus and my sport"" or ""Jesus and my job"" or ""jesus and my sexual attraction profile.""

Instead, ""I'm going to buy a crucifix and wear it, talk to God about my sexual attachments and disordered desires, and ask him to walk me through healing. Then i'm going to find a woman who is actually safe to take that stuff off while we have sex, someone who may be even better for me than i can possibly imagine right now. God will show me.""   It's interesting how you put it. sin damages that relationship. distrusting God to adequately guide my life, answer my needs, and refresh my soul and gratify my desires ... this is sin. a very basic one. to distrust him who made me and who cares about me."
NoFapChristians,3csnyo,fapstronaut85,2,Fri Jul 10 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"The spirit of your post is very positive but I'd like to bring up two things.  One. The physical object of the crucifix has no significance but if it helps you remember God regularly then why not. God commanded us though in Deuteronomy to make no supernatural image of anything in hell, heaven or earth. Jesus commanded us in the gospel to not display our religiousness in public like the Pharisees but rather let your love, godliness and service to mankind be on display.   Two. Sex is God's gift to married couples. it may be fruitless to go around in search of Christian women who could possibly match our sexual desires but rather apostle Paul commanded us to rejoice in our singleness and to trust God to find you your partner who will post consummation of the marriage become one flesh. Sex is not just recreation but the spiritual act of two bodies becoming one flesh as described by Jesus."

NoFapChristians,3csnyo,RussellASI,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:25:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, the tool of shame is an effective one in the Devils hands to keep us in bondage. And yeah, you're right this compulsion has way more to do with idolatry than it does anything sexual. We have to be real careful tho about calling masturbation sin when there is no place in the Bible that mentions masturbation as sin. I've heard stories of monks, priests and missionaries who have a healthy relationship with masturbation. But I would agree with you but that that isn't most of us here. It's the fantasies and storms of lust that swirled around in our minds that keep us in bondage to PMO or MO for that matter. The porno movies we come up with in our own brains start to call to us when we're trying to keep pure of heart and sane of mind. For me it's been 9 years now. 9 years since my flesh last pulled me to my knees and submission to its dark coping mechanism. 9 years of freedom from the demons that kept pounding on the imagination centers of my brain and hijacking my will.  Most Christians and theologians don't understand the battle and the fish hooks that this digs into our flesh making it a habit we cannot not break by our own free will we need the help of others and if were afraid to approach the very people who can help set us free that's a huge problem. In the American evangelical system there has been a disastrous breakdown of communication on the issue of sexuality over the last 50 to 100 years.  Great points brother! Once we start making up rules that are not in the Bible we fall to the leven of the Pharisees and the sin of toxic religion.   Sometimes the greatest tool for destruction is well meaning religious people who don't understand sexual addiction or compulsion."

But yes Jesus said that anyone who looks at a woman with lustful eyes has already committed adultery with her in his heart which is what porn causes us to do.

Blackberries are good and tasty little fruits but I wouldn't advise anyone planting a blackberry bush in their backyard.   Guilt and shame are two different emotions. If you let your thought life run and fantasize about things sexual situations porno movies in your head and masturbate that is sin. Like blackberry bushes those thoughts tend to take over.  The psychological community has renamed sin dysfunction, disorder and addiction. To use a different word, that kind of fantasy ridden thought life produces the dysfunction of masturbation. Why else would you do it? Some do it for release, but I believe most do it to be released from the burdensome fantasy blackberry bush that is taking over the mind and thought life.  We think we can get relief by rubbing one out, it's like its cutting  the huge tangled thorny blackberry bush back. But the truth is it needs to be pulled up by the roots. Shame keeps us from going after the roots. Because in large part shame is the roots."

NoFapChristians,3csnyo,Blueaugustine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:16:07 2015 UTC,"Sin is misunderstood. It is not the act of rebelling against God's law but rather sin is any act that can damage your relationship with God.   I have been realizing this more and more lately. So many people make claims about what is or is not a sin, but this is truly what a sin is to a true Christian.  We need to evaluate whether our actions and choices strengthen or harm our relationship with God. But, we need to be honest with ourselves about this. <br>  All things are permitted, but not all things are beneficial.  Are my actions beneficial?  This is the question we need to ask ourselves."
NoFapChristians,3csnyo,Blueaugustine,2,Sat Jul 11 01:42:43 2015 UTC,One of the things I was reading about recently was how it is the role of the holy spirit who lives within us to convict of our sin.  The guilt is actually him trying to call you back to repentance.  Of course sometimes we tell him to shut up. Which is what he does and backs off for a bit so that we can partake in our sinfulness.  He also prompts to study the word so that you can better differentiate between right and wrong.
NoFapChristians,3csnyo,krazytennis98,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"Sin is misunderstood. It is not the act of rebelling against God's law but rather sin is any act that can damage your relationship with God.   You're pitting two things against each other (sin=breaking God's law vs. sin=damaging your relationship with God) that the Bible does't pit against each other.  ""If you love me, keep my commands.""  Breaking God's law (or failing to keep it) is damaging your relationship with God. Sinning against God means not loving Him enough to obey His commands in the way, and with the heart, that God requires and commands of us.  The good news is that He gives us that heart.  I do think your post has lots of good things in it, but wanted to emphasize this point as I think it is important to be clear about--especially as we fight temptation for the glory of God.  with great hope in Christ,"

The way we handle it usually leads to a crippling weight of shame and disempowerment. We should realize that sex is one of the best things God created. Marriage is the image most analogous to God and His people, and sex is the image of those two coming together in love and oneness. So at the danger of sounding overblown, it's kind of like the highest act of the highest relationship between the highest forms of creation.   And it's because it's so good that God tells us to be careful with it, not because it's inherently bad or shameful, though it can be twisted to become that."

NoFapChristians,3cvvsi,new_life55,2,Sun Jul 12 05:34:20 2015 UTC,"Sex is great, and it is suppose to be used often in marriage.  That's how God designed the world.    Now, there is a difference between acknowledging one's beauty and fantasizing about having sex with them for the purpose of sexual gratification.  Jesus said that lusting after a women in your heart is adultery.  ""Lusting"" I would say, would be looking/thinking about a girl in a way to bring sexual gratification.  We dont need to do that.  We can say, ""Wow, God sure made that one beautiful"", and be done with it.  The problem for most of us is that this is a porn recovery group and most of us cannot acknowledge a women is beautiful without thinking that means we have to masturbate to her image, fantasize about laying with her, etc..  Focus on God and get involved in his mission.  Live out your calling in life, and you will see that we can live without lust, and it is indeed a better life."
NoFapChristians,3cvvsi,new_life55,2,Sat Jul 11 11:31:47 2015 UTC,"well, i think you have a very good point about fantasizing. i think fantasizing is generally a bad idea. generally. in this sense, maybe always. i think, ""well, she's hot. i can either envision myself nailing her, or i can go talk to her and get this ball rolling in reality.""  one point though in defining lust, and this is a tricky one, i go for etymologies, and in the case of morality and Biblical stuff, i go to Hebrew and Greek. the Hebrew word for 'lust' is the same as 'to covet'. Proverbs 6:25 and one of the Ten Commandments verses (idk why i capitalized those words) are built on the same root.   so, when i talk about lust, i mean do i think about 'taking' her. have i been deceived that what God has put in front of me is not enough? i'm not a theologian, but i think i remember someone putting it this way. desire is like seeing your neighbor's hot red corvette and really liking it. lust is wanting to steal it into your garage and make it yours. one is normal. the other is evil. i like sex, and i like sexuality. it's been really hard to figure this stuff out, and i've been so black and white in the past that this gray area is really touchy"
NoFapChristians,3cvvsi,new_life55,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"I guess when you say ""fantasy"", the only fantasy my corrupt mind thinks of is nudity/adultery/etc..  And, if I play with those thoughts in my head, even though I believe I have no real intent in actualizing them, I am planting a seed in my heart for sinful actions.  I may be nurturing that evil desire, then trimming it, nurturing it, trimming it, etc., but I am only making the struggle harder and stunting my growth in my relationship with God.  So far, my current understanding of scripture is that sin is first grown in the heart before it is ultimately conceived.  James 1:14-15     ""But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.""      Notice how he is first tempted, then he is drawn away.  Then, his thoughts become his actions (whether he originally intended it or not) and commits the action he had been fantasizing about.  The end part is if he continues sinning with no repentance, apart from Jesus, and the result is eternal death.    Our heart is the evil source of our thoughts.  Matthew 15:21     For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.     But Jesus will transform our minds and our hearts.    Psalm 34:7     Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart.     But, back to your original topic, I admit it is hard (as a single guy desiring marriage).  I guess for me, I am just struggling to accept that I am going to have to be patient and wait for marriage.  Trust me, my desire to have sex will not change, only build up.  I hope then, that with my wife, my sexual desire for her will be so concentrated like the Niagara falls, and not like the Mississippi delta, where it as all been spread out of my youth and over several women.    One last thing someone once said to me on here is this:  This desire we have to watch porn, masturbate, etc., is an immoral desire, and your marriage will not fill that immoral desire.  Our desire for sex should be coupled with a desire to deeply connect and bond with our spouse, someone we know an love, not a desire for sex with anyone and everyone.  looking forward to hearing back from you, hope your doing well today!"
NoFapChristians,3cvvsi,new_life55,2,Sun Jul 12 12:02:00 2015 UTC,"temptation isn't the same thing as thinking about something. 'tempt' comes from the Latin 'tentare', or 'to grab'. it signifies something evil reaching out and grasping at me. once i allow it to grasp me, once i listen, obey, etc. then i'm drawn away.   our heart is also the source of good thoughts.   haha great line about the delta and Niagara falls. wow. you're going to ... the first time ... we're going to shoot our wives across the room from all the built-up pressure.   i agree that the desire to watch porn is an immoral one. the analogy i gave you wasn't meant to describe disordered desires, just inordinate ones. do you understand what i'm saying?"
NoFapChristians,3cvvsi,new_life55,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:14:47 2015 UTC,"It is not our faults we are tempted, I agree with you.  Jesus was tempted.  But tempted, to me, is the initial choice I have of,""Should I undress this girl with my eyes, or pass on by"", ""Should I rank the attractiveness of these girls or move on."", ""Should I fantasize in my bed or just goto sleep.""  Once I start fantasizing, then I am drawn away.  I think we are in agreement here.    Yes, our hearts can be the source of good thoughts, but that is irrelevant here.  I mentioned that verse because it yields us the knowledge that we are inherently sinful, and cannot save ourselves, only what Jesus did can.    I think I do understand what your saying.  I just want you to understand that we don't have to fantasize about sex in order to ""nourish"" or ""sustain"" our sexuality.  God knows what he is doing.

Our hearts are good. our hearts especially those of followers of Jesus are ravished in love of Christ, and i'm learning that i am able and supposed to love CHrist, too."
NoFapChristians,3cvvsi,jad_seven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:56:45 2015 UTC,"If our hearts were good, then Christ would not of had to die for us to save us.  If our hearts were good, we wouldn't be addicted to porn.  If our hearts were good, world war 1 and 2 wouldnt of happened.  If our hearts were good, genocide, homicide, and suicide wouldnt exist.  If our hearts were good, there wouldnt be divorce.  I will leave you with just a few of the many times the bible tells us what we already know.    Romans 5:8, Isaiah 64:6, Matthew 15:19, Mark 7:21 + many, many more.    I think we might have a different definition of the word good.  We do have a conscious, and we know we are supposed to do good, but we dont.  We sorta kinda want to do good, but we fail (Romans 7 is very relevant here).  God didnt die for us because we deserved anything, though.  As Romans 5:8 says, he died for us in our sins, not our goodness, to show us His mercy.  What an awesome God! And, he will also transform us minds and santicfy us to his image, so we may become like him in his goodness"

What you don't realize now is that your flirting with sexual sin--and your actual sexual sin--is going to reap long-term consequences.  I think both of you have identity struggles as Christians, based on what you've written. I can't be a judge, that's God's job, but my observation is that you're looking to a human being (this man) to define your self-worth, rather than in Christ.  You succumb to his foolish and sinful behavior and you're rationalizing it to some degree. Now you also say you know its sin, but have you really come to that point? Are you serious about fighting sin? Do you see Christ as the most lovely thing? If you had to choose this man or Christ what would you choose?  I know that's a hypothetical question but if I were you I'd put the relationship on ice for three months and say the reason you'er doing so is so that when you get back together (if you get back together) Christ and His honor and His Word can be central to your friendship, and not illicit and rebellious sexual sin.

Ok, this is the first thing that alarms me, instead on focusing on the fact that you're able to get through three days without relapsing you're going to the negative - however more alarmingly you're declaring to yourself and also to your addiction that it has the power over you after three days. What about the fact that you're a new creature in Christ, and with Christ living on the inside you're more than a conquer.  ""I don't want the 'gift' of sexuality. It's ruining my teenage years, and potentially further on""  Secondly, what you're experiencing is not a gift of sexuality, you're experiencing a warped reality of something that is operating very differently to how it was designed.  Look it's tough, I will not deny that, but what you've experienced is so far removed from sex and what it was designed from it is mind boggling - however because this is all you've known your brain interprets this to be the true representation of how it should be - you're going to have to do a ton of unlearning as you grow older - so start now! I'm 27, married, sexually active and I am still unlearning things that I learned from my diet of pornography and rampant masturbation.  But have hope, it's totally do--able.  Sorry, but this is what I feel, and I'm upset. Rightly so, I can understand exactly where you're coming from - been there.  But please know this, it will get better.  I don't want to go to hell. This is a biggie - and to be honest it's the statement that worries me the most out of all of the things you've said - because you're missing out on the most fantastic part of your faith - salvation through Jesus and his radical grace that he imparts to us. The victory over your addiction has already been won by Jesus Christ, so all you need to do is step into the victory that is yours and claim it. Sure you will trip and stumble along the way, but that's where the hand of Jesus extending his grace and mercy out to you time and again is what makes this salvation so great.  I hope this is encouraging and helps answer some of your questions, there's a whole bunch of practical steps you will need to apply to your life in the battle to overcome an addiction to pornography/masturbation - however this is the starting point in terms of having the knowledge inside of you that you're a child of God and are made right in his eyes by the death of Jesus.  God bless"

For me, I realized that I had previously been ""medicating"" my depression with pmo, so, once I took away the covers (or the drug), the real problem was exposed, and I had to deal with it..  But praise God he rescued from the numbed mindset of pmo and gave me sight to see the problem and courage to face it."
NoFapChristians,3cr3y8,jayjay200,3,Fri Jul 10 02:35:31 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll try to answer these questions as well as I can.  Wall O' Text Alert!  Firstly, I think it is important for you to get a grasp of what Christianity is and what it isn't. A common misconception about Christianity in the modern western world is a belief that Christianity works as a simple checklist of good and bad things. The belief is that if the number of good things you have checked off is greater than the number of bad things then you will spend eternity in heaven and avoid the whole burning in hell bit.   However, this could not be more contrary to what Christianity teaches. The most important point of Christianity is grace.  After the creation of the first man, God gave humanity the ability of free will. With free will, we can choose good or bad decisions. The good decisions are deemed righteous and the bad decisions are deemed sinful. Just as the body can die from a bad decision, such is sin to the soul. So since sin ultimately separates us from God and no one is perfect enough to go their whole life without sinning there is no possible way a human can go to heaven and find salvation in themselves.  This is where Jesus enters the story  God loves humanity so much that he was not content with humanity being forever separated from him so He sent His son, Jesus. Jesus being God in the flesh acted as the sacrificial lamb to cover our sins. In the Jewish faith, you must slaughter a lamb and offer a blood offering to God for him to forgive your sins. This was to act as an acknowledgement that because of our sin we should die however, God has mercy and exchanges our death for the death of the lamb. So just as the sacrificial lamb of the Jewish people covered them of their sins now Christ acts as our sacrificial lamb and has absolved us of all sin.   Now when we accept Christ as our savior we are offered the same cleanliness as Christ had. We are made clean by Christ's sacrifice once and for all  So now the question becomes why should you decide to follow any of the ""rules"" in the Bible anyways. I believe there are 2 pretty good reasons.    We should be so grateful that we have been absolved of all old, current, and future sin that we desire to follow what God asks of us. Just as if your life was saved in a car accident, you would feel compelled to honor and obey what your savior asks of you. The obedience is in NO way determining of your salvation. However, it is our way of thanking God and praising God for what He has done. When we look at the ""rules"" that God commands of us none of them really seem to be mindless rules that don't in some way greatly benefit our own lives. We're called to not overeat so that we stay physically healthy. We're called to not complain because it creates bitterness and disunity in relationships.     Now to answer your questions specifically.   Sex before marriage is seen as a sin because sex is designed to unify the couple. We see this shown through out the book of Song of Songs. This book is all about a married couple and how sex is used within a marriage to strengthen the bond and find pleasure in one another.  God doesn't specify that we need to wait until a certain age to begin having sex. The only stipulation is that sex should be reserved for marriage.  Having sex outside is a sin just like any sin. It is punishable by death just the same as cheating on a test is.  Yes, it is still a sin to have sex with someone before marriage even if you get married later.  This is sort of a false question because if you are letting someone have sex with you then you are clearly doing something to progress the situation. You are never going to find your self accidentally having sex. However, this is not to say that rape (as the victim) is a sin because you are not willfully participating. However, if you are willfully participating in the sex act even if your not moving (or however you want to clarify it) then it's still a sin. No! Sex is an amazing and wonderful thing. Christianity is very sex positive when it comes to marriage. In 1 Corinthians it is actually recommended that a married couple have sex very regularly to continue strengthening the marriage bond. Additionally, there is a whole book about sex in the middle of the Bible called Song of Song (Song of Solomon). This is one of those types of hypothetical questions that can probably never be answered. I have an opinion on it but since I can't back it up with any type of scripture I will not say it. No. Being married or having a girlfriend is NOT going to make issues with porn or masturbation easier. Actually it is probably going to make it more difficult because now instead of dealing with one person's issues, now you have to deal with 2 people's issues. It isn't a matter of twice the issues but x2 amount of issues because issues will arise when your individual issues meet.     I'm asking these questions because of how simple sex was back then, and because of the complexity and all the technicalities of it right now   What makes you say sex has changed?  It's good that at 14 you are asking these questions and figuring things out. Keep doing that. Please let me know what you think.  Prayers, lean on the Lord!"

We cannot control the outside influences, the girls who are not modest in their dress, the commercials and movies that use sex to sell, but we can control our hands.  I remember when  I stopped saying it was an ""addiction"" or ""I had a relapse"", no.     I unzipped my pants  Pulled down my boxers  Took hold of my penis  Stroked it up and down until I achieved orgasm.  There were several places I could have stopped, but I chose not to.  If you sense the enemy preparing, you only sense yourself getting ready to come up with the next ""I relapsed"" post.  The enemy wants you to blame him.

For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. 16Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. 17So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. 18For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. 19For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. 20Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.  21So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. 22For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. 24Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.  Paul struggled with the exact same thing. It's the way it is in this life, constantly warring with our members, fighting sin and losing. But be encouraged, the grace of God teaches us to say no to our worldly passions (Titus 2:11-14), and I say that not in a way to say ""why haven't you learned yet"", but rather to say, ""look how you've learned!"" You have come a long way already, being sanctified through God's grace, and you will continue to be sanctified as you struggle with your members and rely on the fact that your salvation is unconditional. If you fail, it doesn't matter, you can always try again. Just because you sin doesn't mean God is rethinking whether or not to save you. God has saved you already, and is now working on perfecting you.  It is hard, but that is not reflective on your salvation OR sanctification. That is reflective of your sin nature and you will war with it until you die.  But it gets easier. It does get easier."

NoFapChristians,3cn6bt,DallasDwayne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:45:04 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts. I've recently been reading about and noticing the importance of a healthy heart.   ""Above all else, guard Your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.""  I have found I'm most susceptible PMO when my heart is in an unhealthy place. Part of the reason I'm on a decent streak is because a few weeks ago, during a time when my heart was all mixed up and my mind was confused, I felt a call to go up into the mountains. I got a few shifts covered, threw the necessary supplies in the back of my Subaru, and headed to the nearest national park. I only spent a short time up there but during that time I made sure to do things that were good for my heart.  Your heart isn't bad, my friend. It's probably just confused and tired.  What do You love? What inspires You? Dig into that. Spend time taking with Jesus about what taking care of Your heart looks like. Have a pen and paper handy when You do.  Prayers and blessings Your way, my friend. I believe in You, and Your good heart."

NoFapChristians,3cmwxv,Cherubin0,2,Thu Jul 9 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"Obviously, it's not directly about masturbation, since it's about smoking. However, it does teach important messages about controlling passions and how they affect our spiritual life.   If you wish to live long on the earth, do not hurry to live in a carnal manner, to satiate yourself, to get drunk, to smoke, to commit fornication, to live in luxury, to indulge yourself. The carnal way of life constitutes death, and therefore, in the Holy Scripture, our flesh is called mortal, or, 'the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts.' If you wish to live long, live through the spirit; for life consists in the spirit: 'If ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live,' both here on earth and there in heaven."

Of course, usually that is to save the marriage and to be understanding and helpful, but not always. Sometimes a time of separation is the answer because thats what's best for them both.

That's just a fact. I know this very well. My wife can be devastated when I admit to struggling with noticing women other than her, even if I've successfully chosen not to lust.  But, my wife would much rather that I volunteer that information, instead of her finding it out by asking questions. It's much worse when it's the latter situation. You need to recognize the fact that everything will be much much worse if you don't tell your wife about your sin.  It's absolutely better to tell her than to wait longer.

NoFapChristians,3cmrhu,DeerStag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:46:28 2015 UTC,"Very true. At no point do I lose my ability to freely choose. NoFap has simply brought the choice into starker - and more consequential - light and situations.  I suppose what I was looking for was ways of handling the urges now that they're not being satisfied in ""safer"" circumstances. I didn't have this problem with girls until now because I was getting it out of my system. Now I'm having to deal with it. And that's good. But it's also much more difficult. I wasn't expecting that when I took up NoFap. It really sideswiped me. Again, I have no one to blame but myself. But that's why I'm here, coming to You all, my brothers and sisters, to get support, advice, and encouragement in the struggle.  Thank You for Your words, my friend."
NoFapChristians,3cmrhu,hopefulwife,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:40:20 2015 UTC,"What you do is you run towards Jesus! It's not about fulfilling the urge, it's about raising your relationship with him! So when you feel an urge, you immediately pray or open a Bible.   Spend some time being mindful of why you find yourself in these situations. Are you wanting pleasure, are you lonely, are you wanting acceptance of approval? Etc.   Smaller choices lead up to the big ones of sin. You choose to hang out with a girl, then you choose to go into her room, then you choose to get in her bed. Along the way there are plenty of times to stop and flee. So maybe, you need to avoid that very first choice for awhile until God has renewed your mind and he says you can begin to hang out with girls again. Bring mindful of your choices is huge here, but you still need God to help you make the right choice."
NoFapChristians,3cmrhu,fapstronaut85,0,Fri Jul 10 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"it's not as easy as it looks is it! congrats on the newfound attention from women. that's awesome. glad you're finally acting out in reality over fantasy. it's a step in the right direction.   i'm also glad you have a conscience. i'm kind of in the camp that what you've done isn't apocalyptic, but like you said it's a gateway to sex. wouldn't be the end of the world. sex is created to be enjoyed. but the issue is not sex or PMO. it's buried under there somewhere.   check this website out: https://theplacesthatscareyou.wordpress.com/ there's a line from James Thurber in the heading: ""All men should strive to learn before they die, what they are running from, and to, and why.""   i'm thinking that the reason that i've been seeking release in sex is a combination of various factors, but ultimately since i'm now Christian ... that my faith in God to meet my sexual desires is abject.  what some users have written on here sounds judgmental to me. you already feel guilty. just listen to your guilt. listen to God. you don't feel good about these near sexual experiences, so learn from it. honestly i think it's not NOFAP that's making you a bad person. NOFAP is giving you courage to do things that others on this reddit aren't daring to try. i'd like to wingman with you. but we have to think about what actually makes our lives better and what makes them worse. we have to live with the souls and our consciences God has given us, and to give an account before God in the end. and if we end up getting some girl pregnant, we have to be willing to take responsibility for that choice, before we choose it. men think ahead. slaves act on impulse.  i'm still learning some of this. don't take me as a teacher. you asked a question, i answered it as i know how. i don't know eveyrthing; heck, /u/trophenius and /u/hopefulwife might turn out to be right. idk. but what i do know is that God makes all things good to those who love him. even if we screw things up royally. as long as we come back. look at David and Bathsheba. God forgave him. and look at Jesus with that adulteress. he could have hissed at her all kinds of things. but he forgave her. and the whole series of horrible choices i've made since starting NOFAP, and he's forgiven me."

The quote from Mr. Thurber is also to be pondered.  You're right, NoFap isn't making me bad, it's just letting desires rise to the surface, instead of deadening them and handling them in an unhealthy but perhaps ""safer"" way. The past few weeks since this happened have let me dig into this and solidify myself.  As for wingmanning with me, let me know if You're ever in Colorado, my friend.  Thank You again for the grace and for the insight. Your gentle yet wise response was what I needed. Blessings to You.  (Also, I'm sorry You had to take a couple downvotes for Your defense of me.)"

I thought for a long time that it was 'safer' to huddle in the shadows, to eke out a forbidden relationship once every two or three years and then go back to porn when it didn't work out ... but what do i mean by 'safe'? The insanity, brain fog, torpor, and personality disorder that arise from addiction? Is that what safety is?   ""safe"" meant ""away from real people"". I was so afraid of my mom, so confused about women. I still am in many ways. But ""safe"" embraces reality and feels what it feels. I would like to be a hero and say, ""I am done hiding,"" or, ""I am done lurking in the shadows"" and go out and find a healthy sexual relationship with a woman.   but i don't know how to ... lol. I have no freakin idea. i've chosen bad women for so long. but i'm starting to look at things differently. to think about fucking a good woman. i know that's not where morality should be, but it's a step in the right direction. lol. people here will judge me, but whatever. they've turned out to be crazy it seems like. my friends are all gone.

NoFapChristians,3cmrhu,fapstronaut85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"You are right about many things in this post - however the negative tone on calling me judgmental is uncalled for.   As believers we ARE to judge one another's behaviors- not their hearts mind you, just behaviors. The Matthew reference on judgement is not about not judging, but how to judge correctly. A short recap of tmatthew 7:1-6 1) don't give stupid high standards of perfection 2) don't judge on behaviors you struggle with 3) dont bother with judging unnbelievers. Don't make out with random girls is not a high standard. I don't really struggle with lust, so I have no plank in my eye. And he has called himself a believer.   We like to jump straight into the forgiveness and compassion, but if we don't accurately call sin out and show how truly awful it is and then we will never truly understand how costly that forgiveness is. So, some of trophenius rant is justified. Most of what he said was true, and all truth is God's truth. OP may need to have heard some of that harshness. Jesus was harsh at times. However, it is mostly because of point #2 Jesus makes in Matthew that trophenius's remarks fall hollow.   You rounded out our message better than we did (thank you for that, sometimes I get too rushed), but that doesn't make us judgmental. Remember some of the awful things the prophets said of the Israelites behavior!"
NoFapChristians,3cmrhu,ThundorClap,2,Thu Jul 9 11:54:54 2015 UTC,"it was redundant to call out sin like you and trophenius did. and it showed that you were indeed judgmental. why are you upset at being called that? you were that. what is the problem? how can you judge without being judgmental? you need to think about how your words come across, and what definitions mean.   Jesus wasn't harsh to those who knew they were doing wrong already; he was harsh especially to those who were harsh. OP had already said he knew he was going into a bad place morally. Perhaps you missed what he wrote: ""but I've come much closer to crossing the line than I feel good about."" You don't even know OP, so how could you know if what trophenius said was true? OP wrote one post. And you agree with trophenius' reading-between-the-lines into how horrible and lustful and depraved of a person OP is? If that's what you really think, then let me know so that I can block you. That's truly insane.  We need to take a more careful approach to calling things out in this community. Let us not forget that we are not solid, thinking people here. We are recovering addicts in various phases, some of us recovered, all healing. When I am good, I am gone from this place. It will serve no purpose.   But we are not paragons of moral virtue who are worthy of the kind of criticism and scrupulosity that goes on here. A lot of what is called bad and good are completely wrong. And I am not ashamed of saying this."
NoFapChristians,3cmrhu,ThundorClap,0,Fri Jul 10 15:24:22 2015 UTC,"Why are you getting so up in arms about this? OP thanked me for my words - he had zero issues with what I said. I stand by what I said.   And I have no problem being called judgmental - what I have a problem with is being called judgmental in a negative way when my comments were justified.  I made 2 comments about 2 incorrect statements OP made in his post - about NoFap being the cause of his new sexual exploits and about how he was taking NoFap seriously.   His behavior indicates the second was not true and the first statement is just false.  That was all that I said, and you lashed out at me, which is was unjustified, especially considering what you yourself wrote.   Fot example, in your first post, ""congrats! NoFap is giving you courage to try things others wouldn't dare try"". Are you kidding me here?? That statement is horrible. That's not courage, that is selfishness and lust. Nobody on this subreddit should be trying to make out and grope girls. The point is not to get all the attention in the world.   Furthermore. Acting out in reality is NOT a step forward. It is at most a side step. The same fulfillment of the same issues he was having before, just a different manifestation, arguably more sinful because now he is causing other people to sin with him.   Then you broight up david and bathsheba. Do you remember who God sent to David before forgiving him of his sin with Bathsheba? I think David was well aware of what he did wrong and felt bad about it already, but still, a prophet was sent to him to explain just how badly he had messed up and to curse David's first born. You seem to have left that part out.   No, I'm not a prophet, but when I see incorrect things, I will comment about them."

We are all on the same playing field. Now back to the point. He's doing something good, something God wants him to do, which is abstaining from pornography and masturbation. He may not have been ready for the attack Satan would release on him. I myself have had experiences where I was doing the right thing, doing good with NoFap, yet failing in ways I had never failed before. It's because we're caught off guard. Ya it's better to realize it sooner than later, but he's come to our community to ask for help and you point out everything that is wrong. You point out what you believe!

""   this is scientifically wrong advice. go to yourbrainonporn.com and you'll find the truth. neuroplasticity is highly underrated, and claiming that brains never fully reboot begs the question as to how we define ""reboot"" at all. if we think of ""reboot"" as returning brains to the way they were before, of course they won't. there are many other memories, many experiences that were experienced through the mind of an addict ... but you would be surprised at the amount of recovery that is possible even with streaks as long as 90 days. just check out /r/nofap ... rebooting is indeed not just possible, but also a common effect of those who stuck with NOFAP long enough. a few guys had to take it to many months, one to 9; i read another who took 2 years. i read these testimonies often as encouragement. The point is that their brains indeed actually rebooted and they returned to the same smiling, happy, confident, and ruddy boys that they used to be before the dark times and addiction took them over.  and finally, we serve a God who is capable of REAL miracles and who is completely capapble of restoring brains and hearts.

NoFapChristians,3cl8zk,Teatimes55,2,Wed Jul 8 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"In context, it does not mention masturbation itself. This leads to my conclusion that Masturbation itself is not inherently wrong. Don't stone me yet and keep reading. :)  Ok, Many people call it Onanism or the sin of Onan. The problem with that is Onan didnt sin by masturbation, but by refusing to fufill his duty to God and his Brother and his Wife (Gen 38:9).  Truely the most direct answer we have is one posted in another thread by another nofapper here. It's ""But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" (Matt 5:28) That to me is a direct line against Pornography, and so if you could masterbate without such, or following in the spirit of that, without any thoughts outside of your wife then and only then would it be ok. (IE a mutual mastubation in a married relationship. Sex is awesome and God made it for that particular frame).  Now there is one more guiding principle here that we have to me aware of. It's Roman's 14:14 where it says ""I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean."" Dangerous verse and we have to be carefull that we are entirely honest and blunt with ourself when/if we try to apply it.  Basically 1)Do you think it's sinful? If you do then it is. Period. 2) Are you married? If no then any thought towards any woman of that nature would be lust so its sinful. If yes then are you only thinking of her with her knowledge and acceptance? 3) No porn Christ was very clear on that one.  As for me I am married but I've sinned to much with porn for it to ever really be wholesome. and it violates my conscience. When I allow myself to hear it.  Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.

NoFapChristians,3cl8zk,trophenius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:41:30 2015 UTC,"Hi, neither in Genesis 39 nor in 1 Thess 4 is there a reference to masturbation as such. But I want to comment on your other point, Rom 14 (not 4) doesn't deal with issues of sexuality or moral issues, but on points that before God are neutral. If we made that verse into our main guideline, it would lead us astray very quickly."
NoFapChristians,3cl8zk,Aldenrenfrid,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:09:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! That's why I brought it up. Masturbation is not mentioned. That leads me to believe that by itself it is neutral before God. Much like alcohol: the chemical itself isn't evil, only when used badly (IE to get drunk). You're right in that it's a dangerous verse if misapplied. If we want to use it we must be careful that whatever topic does not conflict anywhere else in scripture."

NoFapChristians,3cl8zk,trophenius,2,Thu Jul 9 12:50:15 2015 UTC,"yes, the roman word for masturbation comes from an etymology which quite literally means 'to trample oneself using the hand'. masturbation is a lie. a physical lie. i am lying to my body that i am with a woman, when i am only by myself. it should be her hand. or better."

NoFapChristians,3cljrp,Anoian,3,Wed Jul 8 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think a good question to ask yourself whether you are male or female is... does the way I'm dressed bring attention to my body or to my person/face? There is a difference between objectifying yourself by dressing in a manner that highlights your body or muscles, and dressing in a way that just highlights you and your character. You can look good without being tempting. You can be attractive without being seductive.  Not only do I find my girlfriend absolutely lovely when she wears a dress or a skirt -- I'm talking one that actually covers the thighs -- but I also truly appreciate it because it minimizes any temptation to lust due to outward appearance. But I digress.  Dress modestly and wholesomely. Do not tempt or seduce, but consider others and most of all your Heavenly Father. Glorify Him through how you clothe yourself."

NoFapChristians,3cljrp,krazytennis98,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"It's not quite so simple...  The obvious universal answer here is to not go shirtless. Anything else, though, is very much in the eyes of the beholder. What I've concluded after many conversations with my friends is that we of the female persuasion have widely varying types and find the strangest little things attractive (or repugnant - we do have widely varying tastes!). Attraction does not necessarily equal lust, but sometimes it can lead to it.   Some things that can either be attractive or repulsive (depending on the woman) include: wearing a sleeveless shirt to show your guns, unbuttoning the top two buttons of your dress shirt, wearing a tie and/or suspenders with a newsie/golf cap, or wearing skinny jeans."

NoFapChristians,3cklz2,0degK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"This is easily said than done, but have a quiet time everyday with God through prayer and the Word. I like it to be first thing in the morning. For some reason, it helps me be more energetic. As well as prayer throughout the day.  Also, plan the day out. If you have choirs to do, write them down and do them when it's that time of the day. I also struggle with laziness, and for some reason, it is always at home. Examine your life at home and away from it to find what needs to change to equal those two situations out. I know for me, when I'm at home: I'm lazy, not dedicated and very self centered. But, when I leave I am more energetic, dedicated, always hanging out with brothers or sisters - I'm living more like Christ outside than on the inside. That means I need to make some changes in my life, and what has helped me was a calendar to mark my progress, a to do list, and most importantly, my time with God and my relationship with Jesus.  Good luck and God speed."

Even if you're tired and can't concentrate, read one. You can re-read it the next day if you didn't get anything from it, but you have to make it a habit. I do the same, and I also do the same thing for working out. You will always find an excuse to not do it, and unless you do it anyway, those excuses pile up and turn into you being lazy. That's my experience anyway."

NoFapChristians,3cg221,hub_hub20,5,Tue Jul 7 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe desire only brings with it pain?  I'm not defending porn by any means. But there was a while where I went 104 days without porn, 40ish without fapping. This quote almost exactly described how I felt. As the  desire to look at porn faded away (though never completely though I found it distastful to even think about it) I had this new emotion which I would call desire. I desired a woman, not for some purely sexual reason, but the companionship and relationship, even the things that are inconvenient I desired. I wanted someone who knew I loved them and they were safe and stuff.   But that was impossible, due to some health issues I have the resulted in me looking healthy but being mostly housebound.   The result was that desire was so strong, that it was painful, and inevitably I ended up going back to porn.  I don't say this  as a concession to look at porn, but rather, getting over porn is the easy part as a single man. The desire for a relationship is more powerful than that desire for porn and porn use covers it up. Its a way of running from those problems and when you uncover that open wound that is desire, its going to hurt."

As soon as he finished saying to the children, ""honor thy father and mother,"" he then immediately turned to the parents and said ""do not exasperated your children."" If your mother doesnt have a SOUND reason to tell you not to take this job, then you need to move past it. Work is a biblical concept. Heck, even Adam worked when he was still in the garden.

NoFapChristians,3cebmc,IncognitoFemstronaut,3,Tue Jul 7 06:24:52 2015 UTC,"My idea is that He is kind of like your conscience,    He is not your conscience but he does convict you of sins. I know that you aren't saying that our conscience is the Holy Spirit but if that was so then everyone has him working in us but scripture speaks of a conscience and the law being written on our heart (Romans 2:14-15).  Romans 8:9 tells us that if we do not have the Holy Spirit then we are not of Christ (a Christian).   John 14:16-17  And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  (17)  Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.   I've also heard that you receive the Holy Spirit when you are baptized Christian   No, we receive the Holy Spirit when we are made born again. The fancy word is ""regeneration"". If you read John 3:3-13, you will see about ""being born of the Spirit"". In Act 16:14-15 we read of Lydia ""whose heart the Lord opened"", and she was later baptized.   if Jesus sent the Holy Spirit after He was resurrected from the dead, then did people before the time of Christ have the Holy Spirit?    The Holy Spirit is eternally God, meaning that he has always been a member of the Holy Trinity. John 7:39 does say that the Holy Spirit was not yet given. But in the OT we read of references to the Holy Spirit (search for ""Spirit"" in Kings and Judges for example). In Romans 2:29 we read of circumcision which ""is that of the heart, in the spirit"", and this means that the Holy Spirit is the author of circumcision of the heart, but in Deuteronomy 10:16 we read of circumcision of the heart. God promised his Spirit to his people.  So if the Holy Spirit was present in the OT then why does John 7:39 say that he was not yet given? In the OT, God does not dwell in his people but dwells among them. This is why in the OT God is described as dwelling in particular locations (Bethel, Mount Sinai, the tabernacle, the temple in Jerusalem). However, there is the presence of the Spirit upon certain people (prophets), but that is special.   After the atonement Christ sent the Spirit so that we may come the temple that God dwells in. Ephesians 2 and 1 Peter 2 speak of that corporately. 1 Corinthians 6 speaks of that individually that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit. God made us a tabernacle of the living God. Sin in the camp meant judgement or department. 1 Corinthians 6 speaks of departing from sexual immorality.  In Acts 2, Peter points to the speaking of tongues (when people of other languages could hear them speak) as being a fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2:28. In Joel 2:28 it is written that ""I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh"". The ""all flesh"" part is speaking of all sorts of men, Jews and Gentiles, men of all nations. So we know that the Holy Spirit was not actively working throughout the world before this time.  EDIT: Read 2 Peter 1:21 and you will that the Holy Spirit moved in the prophets of the OT."

NoFapChristians,3cebmc,Fryguy48,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:46:11 2015 UTC,"God exists as three persons, yet He is one God  Biblical teaching of the trinity tells us that all of God's attributes are true of all three persons, because each is fully God  God the Son, God the Holy Spit, and God the Father are all eternal, omnipresent, omnipotent, infinitely wise, infinitely holy, infinitely loving, omniscient, etc.   We can define the doctrine of the trinity as such:  God eternally exists as three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and each person is fully God, and there is one God.    The word trinity is not found in the bible but is derived from tri - unity or three-in-oneness.  It is used to summarize the teaching of scripture that God is three persons yet one God.    Example: Genesis 1:26 - God said, ""Let us make man in our image, after our likeness""  Some say God is using the concept of ""plural of majesty"" but we have no evidence to support that. Rather, it indicates that God is a plurality in Himself.  (Genesis 3:22, 11:7, Isaiah 6:8, Psalm 110:1)  When Jesus is baptized, we see all three persons of the Trinity exposed at the same time, which personally discredits modalism for me. (Matthew 3:16-17)  Summary    God is three persons  Each person is fully God  There is one God   Additionally, no analogy can be made because there is no good analogy that exists to describe the Trinity perfectly.  You may have heard the three states of water analogy, that is just modalism."

That shows great humility in you, and also that you (hopefully) trust in Jesus alone for your salvation, and not in the approval of others.  I hope you found peace and comfort in telling the truth to those who love you.    As far as accountability, I have been there.  I told several of my guy friends whom I knew were Christian (and I knew these guys real well, for the most part) that I was struggling with this.  8 guys in total, all Christian.  Of the 8, 7 immediately came back and admitted they struggle with porn as well (the other guy changed the subject ;) ).  I had talked with these friends before about God, theology, politics, sports, nonsense, so bringing it up wasn't a that big a deal.  Of the 7, though, believe it or not, only 3 have continued to stay committed to sexual purity.  It is with those 3 that I still text after I relapse, or I embarrassingly text when I am alone and tempted, and basically say, ""I'm struggling right now"".

I know the frustration that comes with wanting to change, but finding yourself too weak to change.   The following is a comment I made to someone here on this forum. My intent was to show this person the Gospel:  ""You talk as if you have let God down. Yes, sin gets in the way of our relationship with God. But that is why Jesus came to earth.  2nd Corinthians 5:21- ""God made him who knew no sin (Jesus) to become sin so that we could have the righteousness of God"". You stand before God right now, lustfull, wicked heart and all, and you are seen as righteous. Without sin. Why? Because all of your sin was placed on Jesus. Thus, all the punishment you deserved because of your sin was placed on Jesus. Hence why the cross was so bloody. That wrath God had towards you was poured out on Christ. He took your place.  So now, there is nothing but fatherly love. In no way does God want you to sin. He hates sin. He abhors sin. But you, Christian, are not to earn God's love. That love could not be earned by you or your good deeds. It was earned by Christ and Christ alone taking your sins away and giving your righteousness. You are clean because of Him. You don't have to earn His love! He isn't waiting for you to get your fapping problem or porn problem together before he loves you. He loves you NOW! He doesn't love a future, better version of you. He loves you NOW! Fight porn with that. You go to porn for pleasure. Time and time again you get pissed because it does not offer the pleasure that it says it will. Go to Christ! There is pleasure that will satisfy! That is what he means when he says he is the true living water. Drink of Him and you will never thirst again!  Let Christ seem, and BE, more pleasurable than porn. Because he is. God loves you man (or woman). Where you are. Now. As you struggle. He is walking with you."""

Each relapse is actually a dangerous conditioning of the mind, telling yourself you know it is wrong, but you are going to do it anyway.    1 Timothy 4:1-2     The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 2 Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.     Our conscience is a gift, dont let it dwindle, follow it."

People don't realize that the sin of lust begins way before porn and and the desire to masturbate. It begins with obsessing over something--sometimes, not even sexual--and your heart gets stirred up to the point that normally the only thing you can find that will satisfy your sinful appetite at that point is the sin of self-gratification.  By going Hard Mode, and radically removing all temptations from your life, you'll learn a lot about how this process works.  with great hope in Christ,  bA."

There are so many things that you can do to keep you from going back to sin, and like you said, the most important is accountability. Whether that means getting an accountability partner here, at your church, posting a daily journal post etc. Is the podcast you mentioned called Pornfree Radio? I've started listening to that lately and it is great! I would really recommend it to anyone on here. I know this may sound extreme, but you may need to get rid of your computer/tablet/smartphone. The thing that has really been ingrained in my mind over the years is to do whatever it takes to reach my goals. Personally, I did not get rid of all my technology, however I put K9 web browser on each one of my devices. That way, even if I wanted to, I cannot watch any porn. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to message me or reply to my post. I have been doing nofap for a year now, and I have learned so much. So anything I can do to help, please ask. You are not alone. Just know that God loves you. It doesn't matter what you have done. Jesus loves you just the way you are and he has you in the palm of his hand. Let Go and let God. Give your worries, your anxieties, your fears, your addictions, your dreams, your goals, give it all over to the LORD. He is able. If he can work a miracle in my life, than he can do so for you too! You are not too far gone. There is still hope and that hope can be found in Jesus Christ. Please, if you need someone to talk to, message me and I will do my best to reply quickly. I am usually on here 1x day. God Bless you and remember God loves you!"
NoFapChristians,3c7xuk,persist1,2,Sun Jul 5 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"To tag on to this:  There are myriad methods God gives us to fight temptations to sin in our lives. We have to train ourselves to know how and when to use each. Some days a quick prayer is enough, some days, you have to text/call a buddy, sometimes you need to run, or lock up your electronics...  I'll recommend a great book ""Finally Free"" if you look around at my comment history, I probably mention this every chance I get. It goes so much deeper into the spiritual battle than the ""go-to"" book (Every Man's Battle) It skips over the ""hey this is how bad this stuff is and how you're damaging people and how bad this industry is"" Because we all know that, and it's not enough. We need Him and his Holy Spirit to enact a real heart change.  On the subject of technology:  For Me, blocking software was useless. I'm a tinkerer/techy kind of guy so seeing that blatant ""blocked"" page was just a challenge to defeat. I find monitoring/reporting software to be much more useful. This kind of thing is in the background, easy to forget, but will send a report to a close friend/accountability partner/spouse(when/if she's ready for that) who can challenge you honestly when he/she sees something fishy. Now, unfortunately you can still find yourself relapsing... but I think it just encourages you to really own the battle. I use ""Ever Accountable"" the android app is fantastic, and they also have a PC app (maybe iphone), I think it's like $6/mo or something... WORTH.IT. Pack a lunch one extra day and that will pay for it. It tracks everything from multiple browsers (as well as the default... no janky disabling apps like on iOS) to searches in social media apps, etc. And they're super responsive devs that are passionate about their app.  Maybe someone else can speak to the current state of iOS reporting/blocking apps... when I left the platform years ago (iOS5 era) It was a no-contest win for Android in this regard. It actually felt freeing that I could have so much accountability built in to my phone/tablet."

Wait until your kids are out or asleep, and tell her the truth. Tell her that you are working on your problem, and that you need her help. Not only can she delete the pictures for you (it would be much easier).  Everybody has their fetish. You like gays. I like redheads. We cannot help that! You will be in my prayers.

It gives you low self esteem and makes you feel worthless. You must not quit dear brother! Our Lord is faithful and having faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains!  Think about your life. Is this how God wants you to live? Wasting away your seed on a pix elated screen? God has so much more for you! You need to ask Him for strength and rely on Him for everything. Pray that you don't enter into temptation. Ask for strength and guidance. But you must BELIEVE. Have faith that God will answer your prayers because He will. It took me a while but it took God to really break me down to make me rely on Him for everything. Now I know I'm only on 6 days but I just know that God is going to carry be further.  ""The part I'm most ashamed of, the part that sickens me the most is that my poem of choice is gay pornography"" Don't worry brother we all have our sins. We are sinners at the end of the day but we must DECIDE to turn away from our sins and to deny ourselves and pick up our cross. Have faith and NEVER GIVE UP because the Lord is faithful.

NoFapChristians,3c7xuk,spaceman96,2,Mon Jul 6 08:29:42 2015 UTC,"Hello friend,  I appreciate your honesty. Your desire to change is a very encouraging thing.   The following is a comment I made to someone here on this forum. My intent was to show this person the Gospel:  ""You talk as if you have let God down. Yes, sin gets in the way of our relationship with God. But that is why Jesus came to earth.  2nd Corinthians 5:21- ""God made him who knew no sin (Jesus) to become sin so that we could have the righteousness of God"". You stand before God right now, lustfull, wicked heart and all, and you are seen as righteous. Without sin. Why? Because all of your sin was placed on Jesus. Thus, all the punishment you deserved because of your sin was placed on Jesus. Hence why the cross was so bloody. That wrath God had towards you was poured out on Christ. He took your place.  So now, there is nothing but fatherly love. In no way does God want you to sin. He hates sin. He abhors sin. But you, Christian, are not to earn God's love. That love could not be earned by you or your good deeds. It was earned by Christ and Christ alone taking your sins away and giving your righteousness. You are clean because of Him. You don't have to earn His love! He isn't waiting for you to get your fapping problem or porn problem together before he loves you. He loves you NOW! He doesn't love a future, better version of you. He loves you NOW! Fight porn with that. You go to porn for pleasure. Time and time again you get pissed because it does not offer the pleasure that it says it will. Go to Christ! There is pleasure that will satisfy! That is what he means when he says he is the true living water. Drink of Him and you will never thirst again!  Let Christ seem, and BE, more pleasurable than porn. Because he is. God loves you man (or woman). Where you are. Now. As you struggle. He is walking with you."""

My two cents:     gay porn and same sex attraction are two different things--related, I think, but different.   the bad news is that there is only one way out of this: full confession. But before you get there, you're going to have to ask yourself if you're willing to do whatever it takes. God will direct you where and when you need to confess to your wife.   you are destroying your marriage, your children, and your faith. There is hope for recovery, but you've got to come out into the light in real life somehow, and I would say very soon.

It may stop the bleeding for a moment, but the wound is still infected.  We can avoid sexual sin all we want, but our hearts are still soaked in lust.

My tipp for you, stop seeing PMO as an enemy, as long as you give it position its harder to overcome, because you already overcame it in jesus, why would you have to overcome it twice. Its like saying get behind me satan, it just makes no sense for me, because satan already has no power over you, its just the power you give him that gives him strength, through the position you give him. So just rethink that. Read and believe, i was set free on a day by just finding one verse and understanding and believing it. Since that day i didnt PMO, i had O sometimes at night while sleeping but thats all. I knew from that day on that im free and so i amstill today.   If you are interested in the verse, its romans 8:15  For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” (‭Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭15‬ ESV)  By reading that i realized that hod is my papa and not my judging father and im not meant to fear him like i understood it. Also i understood that he is not disappointed with me.  The fear we are meant to have before god means that we just believe that he is greater then everything, when there would be anything worthy to actually fear it would be him, but we dont have to fear him, we have to know that he is for us and not against us and that he is greater then everything, sovereighn, allmighty.

I see it more as me giving in to the things I'm not supposed to, so I ask God to help me be strong against it all. I hear what you're saying though, and I'll definitely spend a lot of time thinking about it in the days to come.  I can sometimes just smile when God works in His mysterious ways; I've been asking Him to help me with the concept of ""fearing God"". I didn't understand it, since in my mind ""fearing"" means to be scared, and I'm not scared of God since He loves me and only wants what's best for me. Thanks for explaining that to me; the way I see it, God answered me through you :).  Thanks again for your message!"
NoFapChristians,3c7tkd,Anoian,2,Mon Jul 6 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"Just awesome!  i think thats a message god wants to bring to me at the moment, that he works through me where i dont expect things to happen. Because he did that exactly this multiple times in the last days with me and the people im talking to. Just awesome, lets praise the lord for that!   Yeah i really like the concept of it. Because faith teaches us that god is allmighty, stronger then everyone, holy, in hatred for sin, in hatred for sinners, he is absolutely right by sending people to hell. But he has chosen to love us for his names sake. I love god and he loves us. Read hebrews 1:1 - 2:4. it shows which position christ has. God is to fear, but he loves us, we dont have to have guilt, shame and condemnation anymore. He does not break his own word. So yeah he is faithful. I think the whole understanding of that grows the more you dig into that and the longer you are a christian.  Tipp: ask for faith, wisdom, understanding, love, fire and gifts. Thats the stuff paul asks in prayer for others or he tells to ask for. Also its just wise to ask for that.  I love you brother, greetings from germany! :)"
NoFapChristians,3c6gnr,saved316,2,Sun Jul 5 07:50:31 2015 UTC,"I just couldn't keep myself from digging further.     in Christ, YES YOU CAN.  I have been there many times brother.  This week, heck even yesterday, there were about 3 occasions where some image or person ""triggered"" me, and my mind immediately jumps to PMO.  That is how this sin has wired my brain.  God though will gladly do the rewiring.  Each time it came up, immediately end it there.  If it was facebook or tv, move on.  Dont tease the thought, it only gets harder.  Keep the battle easy, dont feed the monster.    Now, as far as lab partners;  I understand man.  I think the main problem here is more so how we have wired our brains, where if we see an attractive girl we think we ought to MO to it.  That's what happens when we watch porn.  When we see an attractive girl in real life, our brains only know 1 thing, ""I want that"".  What a nasty and corrupting sin in our hearts.  But yet, Jesus said ""It is not what goes into a person that defiles them, but rather what comes out of their heart.""  Sure, sin has complicated the problem, but the root is actually in our hearts!  Who will rescue us from this body of death? (asks Paul).  Thanks me to Jesus Christ who delivers us and transforms our minds!.    Submit to God, pray for him to change the desires of your heart, pray that you can treated women as women and not as sexual objects.  Behavior modification over time can rewire pathways in our brain, but it is only God who can change the condition of our hearts."

Christ says that our old selves are passed away and crucified with him, now hidden with him. so what am I now? i feel whole. i feel complete. i feel alive again. i feel more me than i have in over 20 years, and for the first time in my life i'm realizing that i am lovable and even loved.   did Christ take the ego? Or did he take the real me? is my consciousness now ... when Augustine says 'it is Christ whom you see, not I"", what i would say from my experience is that if i encountered the same person (and this is a completely awesome response from Agustine) is, ""It is not the old me you saw, unloved and hated and broken in his sin, but someone pure, loved by Christ, you see me now as Christ sees me."""
NoFapChristians,3c5ppz,jpchubb,3,Sun Jul 5 01:41:27 2015 UTC,"I would first say, just to be clear, that pornography use is just a tool for masturbation and masturbation is a choice ppl make who objectify themselves and others... i.e. use their own bodies and others bodies for short term pleasure that is harmful to themselves and others.  At this point I am getting annoyed by the focus on porn, it matters nothing if you don't use porn but still masturbate, or God forbid frequent prostitutes. Yet there are ppl in the ""nofap"" community who think everything is fine as long as they abstain from porn.  Sorry all that was triggered by your opening sentence ""I have struggled with porn"" ;) To which my response is: Really just porn? No masturbation?  In case you are not aware I would highly recommend a program like nofapacademy.com the guy who makes the videos is in fact Christian, though the the program is not religiously centered. The tips and techniques offered for breaking free from this addiction are comprehensive. I struggled for ten years with this addiction and those videos made all the difference.  I greatly admire your courage and admire your vocation. My hope and prayer for you is that you will overcome this (I am convinced we were given (allowed to fall into) this addiction so in our quest to be free of it we will become better men, or to be more to the point: so we will be men instead of boys in a mans body). And I sincerely hope that once you have overcome this you can use your position of leadership to raise awareness and help others, and be an example to especially young men. We are so lacking in role models and leaders in this respect.  God bless you"

I am very early in my journey to staying PMO free, but my suggestion would be to cut out whatever it is that caused you to act out. If it was your computer, give it away, if it was your phone, get a safe browser or get a dumb phone instead of a smart phone. There is no need for anything that will cause you to sin. I have made my phone a dumb smart phone and I can't look at porn even if I wanted to and tried to. I have no access, and I might not ever go back to a smart phone ever. It's just not worth it brother. And whatever might have triggered you to act, try to eliminate that as well. I have been avoiding aisles in stores where women might be that might trigger me. I look up all the time now even. I just avoid everything at all costs. Better to cut off your hand if it causes you to sin than your whole body be thrown into the fire."

I would recommend this as a very powerful deterrent in learning to overcome addictive behaviors.I was forced to practice TOTAL abstinence and had to be accountable to a 'drill sergeant'type dude...At the end of my AA adventure I had learned to live dry (not quite sober) but dry.Though I 'had' to drink again a few times The fog started to lift and my thinking begin to make sense.In the midst of it all,God found me and healed me with His Word,(PS.107:20), and I have been empowered with His Spirit ever since..  Ok,so this is radical amputation for sure,mebbe you have not reached the point of needing this strict of a plan.My point is,you may need to address your addictive personality in it's various aspects at the root cause.Many churches offer Celebrate Recovery Groups which are patterned on a Christian/biblical Recovery model.A quick perusal of local fellowships may reveal one nearby.Mebbe you should consider your drinking and OCD as a starting point in yr recovery effort and not stress too much over maintaining a 'streak'? Your PMO is more than likely a stress reliever from OCD.I know OCD well,having suffered from it for years.Drinking aggravated all my symptoms.A doctor can help you with medication that really works.PMO is often symptomatic of many other deeper issues,substance abuse being one of the primary ones.Take a look at some of the options that your community offers,life is too short to suffer.Take things a day at a time...Take it all to Jesus,confess your helplessness,trust Him...God heals :)"

If you seek Christ and know Him...and read he Word and pray, you will know if a girl is a Christian because she will be more worried about seeking Christ than seeking you. Also PMO fuels these thoughts more than anything. Your mind has been told it should be easy based on the instant satisfaction you always get from PMO. Well real life ain't that easy brother. It's going to take time and trust. It's going to suck getting to That point. But do not give up.

NoFapChristians,3c2lah,Galnery,6,Sat Jul 4 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"This is a great question.   First, let me say this. Often in my life I get so caught up in the ""counter"" mentality. I ask questions like: ""how long have I gone?"" ""What is my longest streak?"" And my heart begins to care more about how long I've gone; when I fall into temptation I get devastated and ashamed. And it turns out that I am not that devastated and ashamed because I have sinned against God, but more that I broke the streak.   Try and find the root of where these depressing feelings are coming from. Are they godly? I would say usually not. Usually it's from a wrong understanding of God's love and the Gospel.   Onto your actually question. It's a hard answer. We need to make a distinction first though. There is a difference between punishment and wrath. I think biblical ""punishment"" can also be called discipline. Let me examine wrath first, and a correct understanding of that will lead us into a biblical understanding of God's punishment (discipline).   Time and time again you read about God's wrath. In the old Testament:   Isaiah 26:21 ""For behold, the Lord is coming out from his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, and the earth will disclose the blood shed on it, and will no more cover its slain.""  And the New Testament:   Romans 1:18 ""For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.""  Think basic Christianity. The story of Noah and the ark. Why did God send the flood? To kill wicked people. Is God just to have wrath against sinful humans? Absolutely! This isn't sinful wrath. God's people are going directly against God and His word. Think of this in terms of a courtroom. You, one of God's children, are in the judgment seat. You are guilty of all wrongdoing that is brought up. God is just to kill you, throw you into Hell, and cast you away from Himself. Without going into a completely other topic, he does that to some people. Some people are separated from God. We see it in the OT as well as the NT.   Now, I think for most cases in the NT, when ""wrath"" is brought up. It is USUALLY concerning the final judgment. So, how does this work for Christians? We are sinful, we are guilty in the courtroom because of all our sin.   Romans 8: ""There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.""   Romans 8: 31-35 ""What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?""  In the courtroom when you stand there, guilty, you are declared free. You are not condemned by God! How is this so for the Christian? 2nd Corinthians 5:21 - ""God made Him who knew no sin to becomes sin so that we could have the righteousness of God"".   You and I are made clean before God and declared not condemned for our sin because all our sin was placed on Christ! That is why he is called the sacrificial lamb. He took all our sin on Himself, THUS TAKING ALL OUR WRATH! We call this substitutionary atonement. Sinners should have been on the cross. Taking the full brunt of God's wrath for their sins. But Jesus took it, so that we could have the righteousness we could not get on our own. It is this righteousness that allows us, sinners, to have relationship with God.   Ephesians 1:7 ""In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace.""   It is by Jesus' blood (his sacrifice, taking our place, taking our wrath) that we are now free. God is not in love with a future, better version of you. He loves you now! He sees you as clean. You don't have to earn that love, you can't. On your worst day, you don't deserve His love. On your best day, you don't deserve His love.  So, all God's wrath due to us has been poured out on Jesus. There is only one thing left, and that is fatherly love towards us. Now, just as any good father disciplines his children, so God discipline us.  ""It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.""   (Hebrews 12:7-11 ESV)    So, what does this discipline look like? Remember, there is a difference between wrath and discipline (punishment). And there is also a difference between discipline and consequences to our sin.   We know that ultimately God's discipline is for our good. It comes from a place of love, not frustration, or a ""when will you figure this sin thing out?!?!"" mentality from God. So I don't think those deep, heavily dark feelings are from God.  Perhaps this isn't true, and for anyone else reading, please correct me if I am wrong here. But God doesn't want you to fight sin from a ""I don't want to sin because I don't want to be punished"" mindset. That doesn't change your heart.   God wants us to love Him more than our sin. So any feeling of ""God hates me"" or ""God isn't happy"", I would be very slow to attest to God's discipline. Sure, sin is brutal and bad. It is in direct opposition to all things God is for. Sexual sin feeds the human trafficking industry and the belittlement of God's daughters. God abhors sin (Psalm 5) and has every right to kill you and pour his wrath out on you because of the weight of your sin. But he doesn't, as mentioned above, he poured it out on Christ. So yes, sin does in a way get in the way of our relationship with Christ. But I think that is more, unconfessed, unrepentant sin. If you are seeking help with sin, trying to put it to death. I don't think God is taking away his relationship from you as you fight the sin. He is walking with you in it. Guiding you. Helping you. Picking you up as you fall.   I don't have a clear cut answer to what his discipline looks like. But I do know that in no way is it ever condemning. (Romans 8:1 - There is therefor now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.) It is for the sake of your heart change. See Christ as more beautiful than the fleeting pleasures of porn and masturbation. He is so good. He is so gracious. He is so patient. His love is overwhelming. I pray you feel it.  P.S. - Sorry for the book and any error you find within."

BA."
NoFapChristians,3c2lah,DJ_Pace,3,Sat Jul 4 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"Please don't be sorry, this is exactly what I was looking for. You have done such a good thing and I can't express my full thanks through the words typed through the computer, but please know that I really, really appreciate this. Thank you so very much!  Your post has really taught me a lot. It's so amazing, because I never would've thought I could learn more about God and his love from a place other than the church or the bible.   In hindsight, I was so deceived and my way of thinking of God has truly been haunting me. Many times after I relapsed and fell into my usual depression, I always wondered if what I was feeling was truly from God, because those depressive states drew me away from God and everything else in my life. So anyone that knew me would regularly see me happy and normal for one week and then depressed for the next week. It became a normal occurrence.   It's marvelous to know that I don't have to feel this way and it was not what God has intended for me to feel. That's why I want to thank you so much! It's like you've broken these imaginary chains around me. I plan to reread your post many times, until I've absorbed everything.   God bless you."
NoFapChristians,3c2lah,Tim165498523,3,Sat Jul 4 05:48:39 2015 UTC,God is good to us my friend. He is immeasurably good to us.  I am so encouraged to hear He has spoken to you.
NoFapChristians,3c2lah,ozarkakaka,5,Sat Jul 4 13:35:29 2015 UTC,"There are natural consequences to sin. I don't think God punishes us, exactly, but lets those consequences play out. His Holy Spirit also convicts us of our sin, so we should feel something (maybe described as guilt) after sinning. But it should lead to repentance, not excessive guilt and condemnation! That is of the enemy, not of the Lord.   The enemy loves to whisper lies in one ear, convince you to sin, and then whisper in the other ear what a terrible, worthless person you are for sinning."
NoFapChristians,3c2lah,Blueaugustine,3,Sat Jul 4 11:11:38 2015 UTC,"God never works against you. He works all things for our good. He will put difficult people in our life, for example, but we choose how to deal with those people. Guilt is a huge motivator, and I think we all experience that when we knowingly sin. If you feel like your communication with God is being cut off you're falling for a trick of the devil."
NoFapChristians,3c2lah,McQueenz,2,Sat Jul 4 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"I know that's true in one sense, but in another sense, God does withdraw from us when we sin. That's why David prayed in Psalm 51, after committing adultery and murder, ""Restore unto me the joy of my salvation."" And there are prayers he won't hear--we're told that explicitly in the OT and the NT.  As mentioned above, we're talking about the fatherly correction, and in god's mercy, He seems at times to give us what we want, to teach us that it isn't any good for us, if that makes sense.  There is also the fact that sexual sin is a violation of His Word and His law. We should feel guilty if we have broken His Law. Because we are guilty.  The good news is that we can look to Christ who took the wrath of God for our guilt, and with hope in Him, repent and move ahead."

NoFapChristians,3c2lah,SgtZabka,3,Sat Jul 4 05:35:55 2015 UTC,"Months ago I had a post addressing some of these things. Suffice it to say it's a condensed version of what /u/DJ_Pace said (which he gave a great, detailed, scriptural reply). Here it is:   God has wrath against sin. However, we who believe are no longer (as far as I know) under God's wrath, but under His grace. Therefore, when we sin, we are given grace. But that doesn't mean sin is without its own consequences or that we should sin as often as we please. Sin does not just separate us from God or send us to hell, it disrupts God's good order. It has residual effects that permeate our lives and relationships. Here's what I conclude: God does not have wrath against His children for their sins, but He still has us face the consequences of our sins while on this earth, which could be considered a form of punishment (note: punishment is not necessarily wrath). Also, refer to [Hebrews 12:6-11] . The Lord disciplines those whom He loves. In fact, according to the scripture, it is evidence we are His sons :)   To expound a bit and more specifically address you. I don't believe God necessarily punishes you for a relapse. However, as a natural consequence -- which is arguably self-inflicted punishment due to the choice you made to sin -- I do think your sin has grieved the Holy Spirit and at the least taken you out of intimacy with the Lord (note: I'm not saying you are separated from Him). There will likely be additional consequences. In relation, don't make the mistake of thinking your sin, even if done in isolation, only affects you -- it doesn't.  Here is an excerpt from an article. I recommend you read it through fully.   As believers we do not experience separation from God when we sin; however, we do experience a break in our relationship with Him. There is tension in our communion with Him. As a result, we may experience confusion, loneliness, guilt, purposelessness, or the like. This is what spiritual death feels like. For believers, this is not a permanent state. But it is a consequence of unconfessed sin. Read more: http://www.compellingtruth.org/consequences-sin.html#ixzz3evgln4YI   Lastly, I highly doubt the Lord wants your motivation to be negative reinforcement. Instead, let your love for Him be the driving force. Ask Him to work in your heart and mind to make your primary aim and goal to love, obey, honor, glorify, and grown in Him, for Him to be your greatest affection. It is much more empowering to fight the battle as a pursuit of the Lord rather than as mere abstinence from sin. Remember this."

I would suggest trying to find a recovery ministry in your area, somewhere you can be with some people that understand and help you as you help them.  I think God uses our brokenness to help others. Investigate the reasons you were using and the triggers. We as men are not all that different and you may well find a sense of purpose helping guys win this war for their souls. Especially the young guys. Porn has certainly evolved since when you and I were kids. These guys today are seeing stuff right out of the box that can be traumatic. (Different from when we first got involved.)  Don't concern yourself with never being married. I have been married three times and porn never went away. Married, single, divorced, widowed human sexuality is a powerful, powerful thing. Tell your story, it needs to be heard.  I hope you feel welcome here."

For sure I understand that left unguarded I could fall back, but somehow it's not what I worry about. I feel, in this respect, my eyes are opened. When I come across objectified women or instances of porn I don't buy into the objectification, it doesn't trigger me, I look it straight in the face and I see the humanity and the suffering. I see the beauty but the sexuality, I see how it's been forced and exaggerated and enhanced, but I don't even see how ""having it"" either in fantasy or real life is going to be good for me...

I am supposed to go to Florida for vacation with my accountability partner and some other friends at the end of the month.

Having said that you must identify what and when and how you're being triggered, and eliminate that.

The app is free to use with the ability to add your accountability partners to the app and able to send them prayer request at just the click of a button. It features a calender which tracks the days you succeed and the days you have set backs, it also allows you to put in the general time of day you had a set back and what you were feeling prior to the set back so you can begin to map when you most need to be on your guard. For me its late nights generally on the weekends. It also has a journal with 3 basic questions that you can fill out on the end of the day, think of it as an informal examination of conscience. I know not all of you are Catholic, but the app itself is pretty much non specific in religion, unless of course you purchase the book, which has some reading by the saints, former popes, etc. I highly recommend this app to you all because it has begun to help me be more on guard and be aware of what triggers me.

NoFapChristians,3bynvk,O_Matty,3,Fri Jul 3 06:00:26 2015 UTC,"1.)  As mentioned, the ""chaser effect"" may make temptations stronger over the next 2 days.  After your body had a small dopamine release, it wants chase that high again.    Also, sometimes after a long streak and then relapse, I would think, ""Its gonna take a while to get back to there, I did good, a break or 2 wont hurt"".  This is the most dangerous mindset to have.  If you have been feeding thoughts like that, realize it now and move on.  That mindset is really all performance based, and not God-centered. The goal is freedom addiction out of an abhorrence of sin and adoration of God because of his grace.  Streaks and badges are a reminder of how God is transforming us, but when we die, if in Christ, all our badges will just say saved by grace.  Live that way on earth.    2.) Yes.  It usually starts itself after watching a movie, scrolling through facebook, etc.. and I see an image that I don't immediately move past.  I let my eyes linger, I let my mind linger.  Not only by doing so do I endorse fantasizing through my actions, but I am feeding a monster.  The monster grows, and temptation is only harder.  Kill it when its small, and dont feed it.    I am very encouraged by your 75 day streak, Praise God for giving you continual victory over this sin!  Now get back up on the horse of Jesus Christ and return to battle! It is an honorable one."
NoFapChristians,3bynvk,new_life55,3,Fri Jul 3 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your first attempt, I only made it to 29 days my first time out of the gate.

NoFapChristians,3bynvk,malemedusa,2,Fri Jul 3 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"Well your sexual urges are going to increase because now your body is going to want to repeat what just happened. You gave in to the flesh and now it's going to want more. Be on watch because it'll sneak up once again.  Yes temptation is going to increase. You said you thought that you were not going to fall again. This is the problem that most of us have. We think we have succeeded and then it turns out we were weaker than we thought. When the temptations and thoughts come to your mind immediately begin to think about God and Christ crucified. Immediately start praying, even if it's just in your mind, and force your mind to think about God. Do this until the thoughts reside and your body gives up trying to force you back into PMO. Read the bible, read the bible, read the bible. Pray, pray, pray without ceasing. If you aren't doing these things on a daily basis and feeding yourself spiritually then you will fail again. I recently relapsed after a 100 something day period of no fap. It was because my time with God and meditating on Him day and night was not what it was suppose to be.

A few thoughts.      you're not fighting the desire to look at Porn as much as you are fighting the ""high"" or ""thrill"" of obsessing over something that you've decided you need or want but can't have. Repent of this obsession.   you're not fighting the obsession as much as you're fighting a general sense that your life sucks and for whatever reason God's dealt you a bad hand. Repent of this attitude.   repentance in both cases looks like first hating the thing that's killing you and removing it from your life at all costs; and then, in its place, putting something that pleases God and honors Him and strengthens you instead.   the circumstances when your memories become more forceful or tempting are times when you have already been tempted to solve your own problems your old way.   if you haven't confessed specifically in RL to your wife or to an accountability partner or pastor, you need to do so asap.   with great hope in Christ,  BA.  edit: PS: be brutally honest with yourself."

NoFapChristians,3bu8py,HiddenAccPart2,3,Thu Jul 2 04:58:19 2015 UTC,"Don't despair my friend. There's hope for all of us here. Being a christian doesn't mean our sinful nature disappears but rather that we, in our fellowship with Jesus, can live in a kind of ""trading"" relationship with him. We regularly confess and give ourselves and our sins to him and in return he gives us his righteousness and goodness and purity. Jesus said: ""I am the light of the world"". Make sure you're grounded in that fact before trying to be the light of the world yourself. Also, that you have bad feelings for the sins you do is a part of the christian life and is a kind of confirmation that your faith is alive. Read Romans 7...  That's not to say we ought to be stuck in particular sins and that's why we all are here, to help each other grow in sexual purity and abstain from this particular sin, PMO. Some practical advices: 1) get an accountability partner and/or go to confessions reqularly. 2) Be strategic. Write a diary about your fight against PMO. Identify what triggers you and when you tend to be extra exposed to temptations as well as what kind of feelings and moods that are involved in you having relapses. When you've done that, think about how you can avoid getting into situations where you know you're weak and will likely give in. 3) Continue to be at this forum reading and writing. It's good to remind yourself that you're not alone."
NoFapChristians,3bu8py,johannes365,3,Thu Jul 2 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"A couple of questions and thoughts to challenge your current state of mind and help with this battle we're engaged in:  How old are you? Not that this should matter, but in my experience we're able to take more things in stride as we get older, perspective seeps into our mental state. The last paragraph feels like you've lost perspective. I don't know how to best address this other than to say ""It gets better"" (to steal a term from a secular campaign a little while back) And to remind you of the saving grace of Jesus Christ. When you ask forgiveness and repent, God doesn't see you like that anymore, why should you? Sorrow for how we've wronged the Lord is a valid tool, but it HAS to be balanced with salvation.  Are you seeking discipline in other areas of your life? Are you a procrastinator? Do you pick up after yourself? Do you work out? I've found that pursuing discipline across the board allows you to better see patterns of selfishness, things that are insidious that build up to a point of PMO, that wouldn't seem directly related to PMO... shirking even the smallest responsibilities is a good sign for me that I'm trending towards some selfish outbursts.  Back to the subject of guilt/sorrow... It's important to realize that there are harmful versions of guilt and sorrow. If we are only regretful of our actions because of worldly consequences, then our heart hasn't truly changed. We must constantly be asking the Lord for his Holy Spirit to change our hearts so that our sorrow is due to our transgressions against HIM. Similarly, guilt can very easily be due to this satanic idea that ""I should be able to do this""; a feeling exactly as you described can be damaging because we get in a spiral of self doubt. This is a COMMON tactic of Satan. It takes our focus away from God's power and onto our own failings and... pride. Again, we need to implore the HS to come into our hearts and make this a serious change in thinking. You clearly have the ""head knowledge"" of how wrong what you're doing is and how God can help you, but the faith/heart/trust that He will seems to be missing. Only He can make that change in you. Pray for that change. Don't pray to be healed, don't pray for temptation to leave, pray for a heart change focused on Him and his power, pray for guidance in standing up under temptation.  I'll also recommend a great book I recently read: ""Finally Free"" by Heath Lambert  Praying for you now, brother!"
NoFapChristians,3bu8py,SirPribsy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:33:52 2015 UTC,"I am 18. I have all the desire to get more disciplined, but none of the will. Aside from money, I haven't had to work for anything, allowing me to get lazy. I am thin without exercise and book smart without studying, but I know that if I put in the effort I could be more. I could obey more, work out more, study more, do everything better. That is why I hate me, because I could be better in all aspects but I'd rather waste my time doing useless crap or caving into my desires. And with every sin I commit, I could almost see the pained look on his face as he hung on that cross. I can't live with myself knowing that i fail him so often. I don't understand though, what part of my faith is missing? I know Jesus died because he loves me and I know that through my faith in him and repentance I am saved. But I feel like if I have repented, then I should no longer be stuck like this. You say that I need to have the faith that God will help me, (in which I do) but I feel that the only way he will help me is if I myself work to change with him. But evidence by my addiction shows me that I am either not working with him and I am missing something, or God hasn't started to help yet."

But while God's word is clear that only through Him can we see real change, there is nowhere that says how long it will take. Getting to a point of frustration and despair because you struggle with bowing to temptation shows a childish selfishness. ""Dad, you said we could have ice cream, I WANT IT NOW""  God puts trials in our life and he heals on his timeline. It's important to remember that while we are justified in His eyes and worthy of eternal life the moment we accept His sacrifice for us and commit to following Him, the sanctification process of this sinful, worldly body will continue for the rest of our lives. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back, but because of Him we can trend better. Maybe you're in a one step back season of your life... But the way you're reacting to your sin and reaching out for help tells me you could be on the verge of a breakthrough if not in streaks, in mental state.  We have to balance our perspective with the eternal, and hunt the good stuff. It's too easy to see trends of sin and get down on ourselves, and let that prevent us from feeling ""worthy"" to even plead for help from Him. That is the devil, tweaking the good of regret/guilt into a self-serving nasty version of it."

I have had this mindset before.  The fact is, though, that no one is righteous before God, and none deserve his love.  I claimed that I wanted to take my own punishment, but in itself, that was only another form of pride.  You see, God saw the problem we had created for ourselves on earth.  With our sin, He came down and was tortured and killed by His creation to take our punishment.  He didn't have to do this, but he did.     Its like we were on execution row, and a friend volunteered to take our spot.  Sure, we know we deserve that spot, but the only way to honor that friend would be to live in a manner that would please that friend, and show your love for that friend.  Living in self-pity, repeating the same acts that got us on death row, that would all be blasphemy to Him.  Sometimes, I think we want to take our punishment because we really dont want to follow him and accept the fact that when Jesus said , ""IT IS FINISHED"" he meant it.  We want to be able to take control and earn our entrance to heaven, or proudly take our punishment in hell, when really, all we must due is swallow our pride and surrender to Him who did the work for us.    Edit: Its like the final scene from saving private ryan.  Captain John and his team gave private ryan life, and tells him to ""earn it"".  Jesus, though, told us we couldnt earn it.  He did say that we can show our love for the father by following his commandments, by following Him, by giving up yourself to him, by loving others."

I will post this for now, which is something I've posted on this forum before.   A better understanding of the Gospel is our first step in battling sin. When Jesus looks more pleasurable than sin.   The following is a comment I made to someone here on this forum. My intent was to show this person the Gospel:  ""You talk as if you have let God down. Yes, sin gets in the way of our relationship with God. But that is why Jesus came to earth.  2nd Corinthians 5:21- ""God made him who knew no sin (Jesus) to become sin so that we could have the righteousness of God"". You stand before God right now, lustfull, wicked heart and all, and you are seen as righteous. Without sin. Why? Because all of your sin was placed on Jesus. Thus, all the punishment you deserved because of your sin was placed on Jesus. Hence why the cross was so bloody. That wrath God had towards you was poured out on Christ. He took your place.  So now, there is nothing but fatherly love. In no way does God want you to sin. He hates sin. He abhors sin. But you, Christian, are not to earn God's love. That love could not be earned by you or your good deeds. It was earned by Christ and Christ alone taking your sins away and giving your righteousness. You are clean because of Him. You don't have to earn His love! He isn't waiting for you to get your fapping problem or porn problem together before he loves you. He loves you NOW! He doesn't love a future, better version of you. He loves you NOW! Fight porn with that. You go to porn for pleasure. Time and time again you get pissed because it does not offer the pleasure that it says it will. Go to Christ! There is pleasure that will satisfy! That is what he means when he says he is the true living water. Drink of Him and you will never thirst again!  Let Christ seem, and BE, more pleasurable than porn. Because he is. God loves you man (or woman). Where you are. Now. As you struggle. He is walking with you."""
NoFapChristians,3bu8py,0degK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"God's not just seeing this. He's with you, whenever you want Him, whenever you cry out in all the pain and sorrow and guilt you're feeling. So keep crying out; don't hold it in, don't keep it from God.  …And don't ever pray that God will take your life just so you 'could do no more wrong'. He gave you this life- He knew without a doubt what pain it would bring Him and you, but He saw beyond that, that JOY BEYOND ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE was waiting there.  ""Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perserverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1-2).      Paul's a pretty good example here. Before his change, he was BAD. One of the biggest threats to the Church. But despite what he did, God forgave him by Jesus Christ. And there's no doubt he sinned again; he admits that throughout his writings. But God kept forgiving him. And He'll forgive you, too. Jesus brought about the forgiveness of every sin, and a chance for total freedom from it. So even though it looks hopeless, keep 'running the race'. Have faith in the One who conquered death. …and as for being 'killed slowly', ""...do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day."" (2 Corinthians 4:16)     One thing I feel this will help you out, it's really encouraged me, is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOQ16U0i0l4  ...and also, perhaps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVpLCnpuUYA, but definitely watch the first one.

NoFapChristians,3bu8py,McQueenz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"I encourage you to check your attitude. It seems rooted in self-pity and self-loathing. Do you really think Jesus wants you to hate yourself for your sins? I can assure you, He doesn't, nor is He waiting for you to slip up and fail so He can condemn you or look upon you with scorn. Your accuser is Satan and he is a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. He hates you and he wants you to hate yourself. Even if you are born again, he will do what he can to keep you discouraged, debilitated, depressed, and doubtful. He will constantly feed you lies. You need to fight him just as our Savior did, with the Truth of God's Word.  Here's my best shot at addressing what seems to be the underlying issue. God loves you, not based upon anything you do or don't do, but simply because it is His character -- it is His very nature. He has grace for you, you can't earn it or un-earn it, just embrace it and be thankful. If you truly believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the work He has done, there is no condemnation for you. You are forgiven. This doesn't mean you'll never sin again or that you won't struggle with sin or temptation. It means your debt has been erased, eradicated, completely paid for, and you have a righteous standing before God, not because of who you are or what you've done but because of Who Jesus is and what He has done and your faith in Him.  Discipline and renew your mind through the Holy Spirit. Submit yourself to Him. It has been about 261 days for me since I last viewed pornographic material and masturbated. In that time, there have been several moments where I ""just wanted to take a peak"", but thank God that He has shown me that such thinking is ill-advised and helped me to reject it for the lie that it is. I remember my desire to love and obey and glorify Jesus and it breaks my heart, I repent of it, refuse to feed it or give it place, and do my best to think of Him and what He wants. You've got to take back your mind, friend. That's where a large part of the battle takes place. And to start doing that, I think a huge part is having/cultivating a heart that seeks to please and obey the Lord above all else. Do this through prayer and reading/hearing the Word.  I hope this helps in some measure. I'll say a prayer for you."

I kept my laptop out in the living room among others, rather than in my bedroom with the door shut. I prayed, talked with my spiritual mentor a lot, read the bible, and pushed more into Jesus. This of course was all God's grace. I owe it to Him. I still do many of these things and more, just not quite to the extent that I was.  I think the question you need to ask is, what am I doing with my time, what am I dedicating my mind to, what am I using my body and my brain and my abilities for? Don't underestimate the very dangerous state of laziness, whether that is physically, mentally, spiritually, or emotionally. I don't want to assume, but based on what you've said it sounds like you were probably bored or doing nothing stimulating at the time and likely alone or could easily become alone. All of these ingredients are the hallmarks of this temptation. Recognize that. Ask God to show you what went wrong and to help you learn. Filter what you not only feed your mind and imagination, but also what you view with your eyes.  Lastly, don't make the battle about moral abstinence. This is just empty morality and will not ultimately help you. Instead, make the battle a pursuit of love for the Lord Jesus Christ, to obey, honor, and glorify Him, all out of a sincere love in your heart for Him. I believe this should be the ultimate goal for any Christian struggling with this sin. Ask Him for these things. Read His Word and hear it preached. Labor unto the Lord, look for opportunities to serve others for Him, develop meaningful relationships, attend church. In my opinion, you should be doing or seeking to do at least a few of these things."
NoFapChristians,3bsowb,McQueenz,2,Thu Jul 2 02:26:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. Honesty is especially important. One tactic I developed with the help of my counselor is to write a clear description of what happened in my calendar each time I act out or successfully flee temptation.  This account must include what I was thinking before the event, how I was tempted, what I searched for (if I did act out), and how I felt afterward. When I first tried this, I was surprised at how difficult it was. I had become comfortable lying to myself; honesty was a shock.  I think the battle is won or lost well before that 15-minute limbo period. There are addiction stages leading up to acting out. By the time I reach the preoccupation stage of the cycle, my will to flee sin has all but vanished. Proverbs says to stay ""far away"" from sexual sin. By the time I start scrolling walls of random images, I'm already too close to fight effectively."

Okay, so you have feelings for her. That doesn't necessitate a relationship by itself, nor does a lack of ""signs"". I encourage you to temper and evaluate your feelings. More importantly, take some time to get to know her, see if she has changed.   We broke up because she thought I liked someone else but I've forgiven her for holding a grudge against me...   To me this is a huge red flag. It sounds like moderate to severe emotional immaturity and personal insecurity on her end. Granted, we are all sinners and struggle with particular weaknesses and proclivities. So, it would be unfair to dismiss her on this alone. However, as I said, exercise wisdom, even if that occurred in the past. A truly loving, biblical relationship is not based on feelings; it is based on the agape form of love. This is love that is self-sacrificial, love that seeks the good of the other person, love that is rooted in truth, love that endures. It is an act of the will, not a romantic feeling.  My advice is to be patient, wise, and discerning. Ask the Lord for these things. Be intentional. It's ultimately your decision, but if it were me, I would take the time to see if she has matured any. Ask her about her faith. Observe how she acts around different people. See if your beliefs line up and if hers align with scripture. Ask another preferably older, more mature Christian who knows you and/or her what they think. Remember, for the believer, dating is a means to determine if the two involved should marry. Let this inform your approach."

NoFapChristians,3bpny1,trophenius,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"having a weakness or a thorn in the flesh is a far cry from addiction. addiction is about being sold out. it's what the word literally means in its etymology.

OR, I can go to God with those wounds, talk them over with him, expose what i am most afraid to talk about, and he will heal me. he is God. there is no one like him.   addiction is for those who are not made free in Christ, and who have unfortunately sold themselves out to some substance in place of their own feelings, identity, personality, soul, etc."
NoFapChristians,3bpny1,fapstronaut85,2,Thu Jul 2 01:57:16 2015 UTC,I know in AA they say once an addict always an addict... But I think if you let a phrase like that burrow itself as truth inside your head it becomes easier to justify relapse.   A better phrase is that we are still fallen - that goes for any sin. Not just compulsive sin. You have to believe that it is totally possible to completely erase this sin from your life or else you will still fall prey to it.
NoFapChristians,3bpny1,hopefulwife,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:53:05 2015 UTC,fallen doesn't mean that we are addicted. it means we're wounded. and we can either go to a healer or to porn with those wounds. only one heals.
NoFapChristians,3bpny1,fapstronaut85,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:55:21 2015 UTC,"you have to look at the etymology of the word ""addiction"", and be strict about defining terms. psychiatric and professional literature is about as airy and vague as pop culture right now, and defines addiction either as a black and white thing, or a spectrum disorder. you can't be partially addicted based on the actual etymology (= true sense) of the word.   addiction means 'sold out', or 'given over completely'. Essentially if you have lost you ability to decide, to choose, to act, or to do without something evil, you are given over to it. i would say that some people truly are addicted. i was. i would also say that some think they are but aren't, and then there are the majority of people who aren't.   In my experience, Jesus can set me free from anything. he's working on some deep wounds with me. i know a guy who was an alcoholic for more than 20 years, who began to trust God again, prayed while he was sitting in bed with his wife, and never once craved alcohol again. the entire compulsion was gone. i got so mad at him when he said that, and argued with him, but i believe him now, and i am sorry about being such an idiot with him before.   addiction is about being sold out. when we give ourselves to a higher good, to God, then we are not addicted anymore. Jesus, the truth, makes us free."

Let me explain what I mean:  We make many choices in our life, usually based on pleasure. Lets say I want to eat a burger. Why do I choose the burger over salad? Because I think the burger will bring more pleasure than the salad.  If I decide I want a salad. Why did I pick the salad? Because I want to get healthy. And being healthy will be more pleasurable than not being healthy. It is the same with our sin. We choose porn over God because we think it will bring us more pleasure.   So, if Christ looks more pleasurable and beautiful than the sin... perhaps that is how we fight this addiction. Not from the ""I must get on the right track"" mindset.

Here's the thing- God does not cause addictions. My husband tries to play the victim card when he started recovery, ""I don't know why this addiction happened to me"". Sure, when he started young he didn't know better, but as he grew older and realized it was sinful he didn't take steps to eradicate it. At 24 and as a professed Christ follower, there's really no excuse not to be actively recovering and healing.  Giving into temptation is always a choice, internal sin is always something you choose. External sin, like your unfortunate molestation is not, but when you shift away responsibility for internal sin, as my husband was trying to do, trying to claim it wasn't his fault as if addiction was something that happened to him, you remove the possibility of recovery.    Molestation usually require biblical counseling, especially if you haven't really been taught how to forgive. Have you tried to work through counseling before?"

NoFapChristians,3bjynu,asw93,3,Mon Jun 29 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's awesome that you want to turn away from this sin.  The question is: is your heart turning away from the sin?  Without the desire to flee from sin to Jesus, we would be doing this for selfish reasons as opposed to righteous ones.  We all need Jesus, no matter how much we want to try to do things or get through life on our own, so focus on Him.  I have a few tips, and you may already know all of this or do all of this, but here it is nonetheless:  1) Find a good church.  There is a lot that goes into finding a good church, and you should do a lot of research about the churches you consider attending, however the basic idea is this: if you are not growing in your walk with Christ at this church, then you need not be there. 2) Find a Christian accountability partner with the same goal as you.  PMO affects the vast majority of men in the church, so this should not be hard.  Having an accountability partner online works as well, as long as you guys keep in contact often.  Non-Christians cannot understand the importance of what you are trying to accomplish, and probably wouldn't take the job seriously. 3)  Surround yourself with other believers.  Ever heard that surrounding yourself with people you want to be like will eventually make you like them?  Well, that's true, and biblical.  Make sure they are seeking to know and reveal the heart of God, though.  Not just in church for the social aspect, or anything of that nature. 4) Pray every day, multiple times a day.  Not to justify yourself, but to better your relationship with the Creator.  Pray for purity and to be delivered from temptation.  If you delight yourself in the Lord, the desires of your heart will be given to you. 5) READ THE BIBLE EVERY DAY.  This might be the most important thing.  God's word is the key to sexual purity.  Don't know where to start?  Check out one of the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) or maybe the book of Romans.  The more you read, the more you'll hunger for the Bread of Life, and the closer you'll become to God.  I'll be praying for you on this journey.  You will have peaks and you will have valleys, but the Lord remains faithful to the very end.  God Bless you, brother."

NoFapChristians,3bka55,johannes365,2,Mon Jun 29 23:10:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not a calvinist (I'm lutheran) so I understand my viewpoint might not speak to you. Here's my thoughts anyway:  A born-again christian is free from sin but not sinfree. God reached out to us and saved us in Christ Jesus while we were still sinners. God taking the initiative wasn't just that one time on the cross but is like a principle. His love ALWAYS comes first, our love and faith follow from that. What he did on the cross has achieved something that we could never do for ourselves: it has made us, who are baptised and believes in him, free from sin in the eyes of God and free from the judgment of sin. It has not however made us sinfree so that we should expect ourselves to be completely pure and spotless in this life. If born-again christians would be completely sinfree than they wouldn't need Jesus anymore (cause they'd already be righteous), but that's not what the Bible says. Our righteousness and our hope can't be isolated from Jesus. The closer we get to him and the more our love for him and his goodness grows in us the more we will feel sorrow for our own sins.  That you feel so torn up right now is therefore, I would say, a sign of your spiritual health.   Keep turning to God. It's always so disapointing when we fall back into PMO, but the fight isn't over yet. Just remember that we don't have to be holy before we find comfort in Jesus and his love for us - it's unconditional."
NoFapChristians,3bka55,Blueaugustine,2,Tue Jun 30 05:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well dude, you're working through this. As for calvinism, I don't think you need anything but the Bible to see that fighting and overcoming sin is both an event (faith in Christ) and a process (ongoing faith and recommitment to faith in Christ).  Keep working. You'll grow and improve by the spirit's power in you.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."
NoFapChristians,3bka55,denkel,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:48:25 2015 UTC,"Don't worry brother, everything happens for a reason. i had 6.5 weeks streak, so i was halfway to what you were, but.... i fell too, and i also have alot of problems to get back to where i was, but..... i remain happy, even tho i fell like im praying/meditating and focussing less then in my stronger days :D  So i want to encourage you, that all you need is your bible and your faith and hope. The day will come when we will feel strong to go at it again ( i can testify because it happened before) Tho the struggle might get harder (more spiritual pressure) but God will not allow you to be tempated ""beyond"" what you can bear.  And with these verses i want to encourage you also (i encourage everyone on here with this)  Hebrew 12:  Jesus, Founder and Perfecter of Our Faith  1Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.  Do Not Grow Weary  3 Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. 4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?  “My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. 6 For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.” 7 It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? 8If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. 9 Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? 10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.11For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.  12 Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, 13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. 14 Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. 15 See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; 16 that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. 17 For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.  aaaaah better then this i could not say it, Let this be an encouragement to you my brother.  We will be disciplined, even if it may not feel right now, look at Jesus Christ how he endured and gave us hope. Let us run that race too, even if we feel like we are weak now. If we don't fall, we won't get stronger, if we won't be disciplined, how can we be called sons of God? Now let's go!   :D congratulations on 100 days, i hope to remain in Christ and get 100 days too like you :D"

You want joy, but not the associated consequence?    Because let me tell you something, the emotions associated with pmo pale in comparison with the promises of God.  The reason we should abstain from porn is out of an adoration of God, and an abhorrence of sin.  Why should we adore God?  So many reasons. . .He brought us into this life, and we chose sin.  He sent his Son to take our punishment, and we still chose sin.  And yet, God still offers grace.  More over, not only has he already given us this life, he promises eternal life!  Moreover than that, he promises to deliver us from our sins and restore to us peace, joy, love, patience, and kindness.    God also hates sin, as should we, because it seperates us from our beloved Creator, damages families, hurts lives.  Porn is so fake anyways.  It is a candy mirage the devil tempts us with that pales in comparison to godly sex promised in marriage.  Dont take the devils bait, because he wants you to take it, get trapped on his hook of shame, pulling you in further, only ever offering a piece of candy until death.

You stand before God right now, lustfull, wicked heart and all, and you are seen as righteous. Without sin. Why? Because all of your sin was placed on Jesus. Thus, all the punishment you deserved because of your sin was placed on Jesus. Hence why the cross was so bloody. That wrath God had towards you was poured out on Christ. He took your place.  So now, there is nothing but fatherly love. In no way does God want you to sin. He hates sin. He abhors sin. But you, Christian, are not to earn God's love. That love could not be earned by you or your good deeds. It was earned by Christ and Christ alone taking your sins away and giving your righteousness. You are clean because of Him. You don't have to earn His love! He isn't waiting for you to get your fapping problem or porn problem together before he loves you. He loves you NOW! He doesn't love a future, better version of you. He loves you NOW! Fight porn with that. You go to porn for pleasure. Time and time again you get pissed because it does not offer the pleasure that it says it will. Go to Christ! There is pleasure that will satisfy! That is what he means when he says he is the true living water. Drink of Him and you will never thirst again!  Let Christ seem, and BE, more pleasurable than porn. Because he is. God loves you man (or woman). Where you are. Now. As you struggle. He is walking with you."""

It feels fantastic. I was at the lowest point I had ever been in my life, and God became my refuge.

NoFapChristians,3bfwqh,hdaudette391,3,Sun Jun 28 21:37:13 2015 UTC,"HD391, from my point of view, having hit 150 days twice in the last two years, the following pertains:     what you did (and how you did it) to get to 100 days will be the things that help you make it to 101, 102, 103 days etc.   the life structure and emotional weaknesses that led you to medicate with PMO and fapping gradually resurface and can start to eclipse the ""habits"" you put in place to keep the PMO at bay.   the length of time you have ""under your belt"" tends to make you feel or think that you've conquered the thing. But that tends to lead you to a feeling of passivity, ""cruise control"" or even ""boredom.""   You may find yourself lusting in ways that don't violate or cross your ""bottom line"" but that lusting begins a cycle of obsessive compulsive behavior which will/must inevitably be satiated--can only be satiated--by PMO.   the only thing I find that is more powerful than PMO for relieving the pressure or pain of obsessive lusting or obsessive life discontent is radical amputation and OPEN PUBLIC CONFESSION to people who we're embarrassed to share our struggle with.   What I'm writing is the truth, borne out of hard experience. I'm sorry if it is disappointing to you but that's the way this thing works.  I've been fighting it intensely for ten years, and it has been hanging around my neck like a ball-and-chain since I was 7-10 years old.  It doesn't go away on its own. Its not worth it.  BA."

Now obviously I don't know your exact situation, and I can't pretend we're exactly alike, but perhaps your situation will have some similarities to mine.  Once I had a few months down, it felt like I had hit a stride. PMO no longer felt like part of the routine, and things felt so much easier for a while. Unfortunately, though, temptation had ways to creep back in. It can be a bit discouraging, but remember that you were able to make it this far, and you can keep going. It is not, however, because you are strong. It is because God is strong, and God helps us! We don't have to be strong, because God is strong for us.  I have prayed for you, and I'm sure others who have read this have prayed for you as well. Hang in there, and remember that even when we slip up, we can find forgiveness through Jesus."

NoFapChristians,3bfgo9,Disciplical,3,Sun Jun 28 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"Read up on addiction and addiction recovery. (The actual addictive substance does not matter, alcohol, heroine, nicotine, they all have the same problem) Addicts cannot keep promises.  There are many ways to fight this successfully but you are not going to be able to trust your mind or emotions. Your addiction (e.g. the father of lies) is in control of them."
NoFapChristians,3bfgo9,intensive_care,3,Sun Jun 28 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"First off,guilt is not a bad thing,if we are in violation of a promise,we should feel a degree of guilt...God expects this from us,but not to dwell on it but use it as a springboard to repentance, a change of heart and mind.Your guilt is not your enemy,just don't  marry it,ok?☺Now, It's not you that crave this,it is the addict within you.You do have almost an alter ego that is enslaved to this practice,it is not the real you or you wouldnt want to change...Until you practice 'radical amputation' which means complete abstinence you will prolly fail.This, means you will be essentially  powerless over this craving.This kind of demonic activity has to be put to death by the cross.You may need to take this to someone In  RL as well as here.Thank you for your honesty.We also have struggled with this sin.God has done miracles among us,but we have to do the footwork which  would mean NO O at all! So,set your badge today at One, .

NoFapChristians,3bfgo9,trophenius,3,Sun Jun 28 20:38:22 2015 UTC,"Been there and done that. You are not alone! Just know that yes God hates sin, but He loves the sinner. We are all sinners and he loves each and every one of us. He doesn't love someone who is on day 100 more than one who struggles to bet past 1 day. He loves each and every one of us! Keep in mind what christian and motivational speaker, Zig Ziglar once said ""You are where you are, what you are, and who you are because of what has gone into your mind. If you change what goes into your mind, you can change where you are ,who you are, and what you are.""  Read the Bible everyday, such as following a Bible reading plan, pray everyday and surround yourself with great people either in person, or through technology that can keep you accountable for your actions. But first you must decide. Decide that enough is enough and that you are going to go through with this. That even if you fall flat on your face and fail again and again, that you will keep on going and eventually, by God's strength and grace and mercy and by his love, you will overcome your addiction for good! Commit to being a better you. You can do it!"
NoFapChristians,3bfgo9,persist1,3,Sun Jun 28 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"this is a great post. Yes, we are so sinful that we actually love sin. But as /u/intensive_care/ says you need to fight this with information. What you're experiencing is actually a normal part of recovery. You're aware of your need, but unable to surrender the sin.  I agree also with /u/intensive_care that promise-making is an addict's worse nightmare. Whenever I hear a guy make promises like that I just cringe. Can't tell you just why, but it is a sure sign of relapse. I'm sorry to say that but it is true.  /u/trophenius/ is correct: one reason you love it is that you are unwilling to radically amputate. Rephrase: you can't stop loving it until you remove the options to sin, and you won't embarrass yourself by confessing your sin and bringing it out to the light of day.  Confessing here is fine, but it is woefully short from the full-orbed, whole life commitment to removing this thing from your heart and soul.  May God show you mercy; we only hate our sin because He is gracious to give us that hatred.  Today is the day of the LORD, today is the day of salvation. Do not harden your heart. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God.  Ba."

In truth it is not about the negation of your desires but truly going to the source of them... An interesting way to look at this is the basic christian (perhaps mainly catholic, not sure) principle that ""man is good"" all our action start from a point of wanting joy and truth and goodness.... it's just that in our state of ignorance we confuse, subvert, redirect our impulses to something we still think leads to joy... but in truth we should know it does not...   But having this problem, and being able to 'solve' it is a huge opportunity to live a more Christ centered wholesome and holly life. It is not constriction and determination, though something like it may be required to break the bondage, but once broken: it is true freedom."

NoFapChristians,3bczex,DJ_Pace,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the question :).  I started because I was seeking a closer relationship with God, and partaking in PMO made me feel ashamed which lead me to stay away from God because I couldn't face Him. When I started with PMO I didn't know that it was a sin, I was very young, and by the time I was old enough to know that I was doing something wrong, my relationship with God was pretty much non-existant.  After I started seeking a closer relationship with God, I realized that I had to get PMO out of my life, otherwise I'll never be able to feel good about myself or have the relationship with God that I'm looking for. I also realized what I was doing was totally wrong, which is why it made me feel ashamed, and I also learned that that sense of shame was the devil's way of keeping me from God. So now when I relapse, instead of hiding from God, I go straight to Him. Abstaining from PMO has more than just the initial reasoning behind it for me, now; I still abstain because I want a closer relationship with God, but also because I know it's a sin, and when I sin, I'm making the Lord sad. Theres' also a few small personal reasons, but as they are personal, they won't matter to other's, and I'd rather not get in to them here :)."

Wow, very introspective post of you, way to identify areas of sin in your, specifically with lust apart from porn.    My advice would be to don't trust your feelings, trust God and His word.  Our emotions are pretty up and down.  We think we enjoy sin, we hate sin, we love going to church, we get bored with church,  etc..  Dont live your life following your emotions. 1 Peter 5:     Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. 7 Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.  Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. 9 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.     Emotions are fleeting, and the void you think your wife is not filling for you will nit be filled in other women.  Pray to God to change the desires of your heart!    Also, quit fantasizing about them.  I can really relate to you.  I used to fantasize about girls in my classes, so then, once we talked to each other in real life, my brain was filled with sexual fantasies in the back of my head.  I get excited because my brain associates that persons with immorality.  The way to break this is to stop the fantasizing!  We need to view these women as sisters (or potential sisters) in Christ.  That is a wonderful way to view them!  Your wife-she is the one you enjoy intimacy with.  Dont spread out your passion for her like the Mississippi delta!  Channel it, pray about, and enjoy her."

This is not always true and is somthing for people to watch out for.  Sometimes it's the enemy, praying on your weakness.  Listen to that voice in your head that tells you you did wrong.  Did it tell you you are worthless?  That you are ruining your relationship with God?  These are things you know (or should know) are lies, and God does not deal in lies, but someone else does.  So while some guilt is to be expected, and should be dealt with, shame is not of God."

NoFapChristians,3bayz8,New_Wind,7,Sat Jun 27 14:07:18 2015 UTC,"Set feasible boundaries for yourself. Take for instance this illustration: a man wants to stop eating donuts, yet when he passes through his local community's convenience store, he sees donuts; he watches movies about donuts; hangs out with people that love donuts; listens to songs about donuts. Yet he keeps trying to stop eating donuts. What you feed to your mind, suddenly takes over how your mind works.   For this man to truly have the power to stop eating donuts for life, this Man has to remove ""DONUTS"" from his thinking process. What you do not feed on, can not harm you. I believe you can replace this sinful habit you are ashamed of with something more positive and healing, by doing that, you will fill the memory allocated to ""DONUTS"" with other praiseworthy thing(s); such as, when you are hungry, you can try taking apples, you will still get satisfied.   PMO is usually due to boredom .. When you are bored, what can you do that is different? What other thing apart from PMO do you find interesting? Do those little things with pride. Here is Philippians 4:8 ""Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—keep thinking about these things.

NoFapChristians,3bayz8,new_life55,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"Very few fapstronauts recognize that the ""heavy urges"" are themselves ADDICTIVE.  If this is a new thought to you, consider and reflect: we are addicted or enslaved to the obsessive and compulsive mindset ITSELF. Something about real life and engaging in the life that God has given us is distasteful or unpleasant. So we start hemming and hawing (to use a phrase) over other stuff.  I'd bet you'd find you have had non-sexual ""heavy urges"" as well: anger, discontent, boredom (/u/Isaac-is-a-man/ mentioned this), and even anxiety over the past few days.  The reason you feel like crap is that you know you were made for more than that. It is also the appropriate feeling for violating God's law. You are guilty; you should feel bad.  The other element of ""feeling like crap"" is to not take it too far and think or act like an unforgiven child of God. You are a sinner, undeserving of God's mercies--even the least of his tender mercies--but in His grace he forgives. When you dwell on ""feeling like crap"" you actually create a scenario where you have to relapse. I call it ""pond-skipping"" where you bounce along the bottom of the barrel for one or two or five or fifty days while you get back to the truth that you are a sinner saved by grace: nothing more nothing less.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

The assumption is that while I'm being tempted that God is looking down on me angry or disappointed in what is going on.  Especially if I don't notice how tempted I am until after I've already made some bad decisions (looked at a website I probably shouldn't have, things like that).  God understands that we get tempted.  Remember Jesus got tempted, and no one said things like ""Well, if he had been stronger, or hadn't gone out by himself ...""  He was tempted, and did not sin, feeling tempted is going to happen."

This is super helpful for many people for a long time, but not everyone, and not everyone forever. I'm posting every day for a year (if possible) but after that, I'm not so sure what I'm going to do. But this is not going to be a permanent part of my walk with Jesus--yet, I struggle with that if, as I believe He is using it to help me thus far, wouldn't that mean I post every day for the rest of my life?  I don't think so.  Things change, we have to trust the Sprit which is sovereign in the lives of others. That's grace.  No lecture, no sermon, no criticism, but spring-boarding off your good honest post with some thoughts that I Hope will be helpful and pointing all of us to the Savior, and not to one another.

This is super helpful for many people for a long time, but not everyone, and not everyone forever     I look forward going back to college and not really thinking about porn being an option.  Right now, this spiritual training is exactly what I need.  During school, though, with my room mate not being a christian, and really many of my friends, this keeps me on my toes.  How can I ruin the testimony of Christ by inviting my friends to church and then they see me doing it.    Anyways, last summer I was on here daily for 2 months, then went off to school for 4 months without incident.  When I came back, though, returning to my old lifestyle, the temptation came back and I failed.  This time around, I think I am going to do the same, but return before Christmas break and through it all.  I need to be able to come home on a break and not return to the old ways, but instead bring in the new ways.  Anyways, this got much longer than I anticipated ha, just spewing my thoughts.    EDIT:  Also, posting anonymously on the internet for hours makes me feel kinda lonely.  I want to talk to people in my life, I am a quiet guy.

NoFapChristians,3b9a52,new_life55,2,Sat Jun 27 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for posting. Lots of emotion in your post, and as some others have said, only part of the story. Here are some points to ponder:     sex is not only to be enjoyed in marriage, it is commanded.   refusing to have sex or neglecting it even is (in my opinion) disobedient to God.   now that your wife has a desire to remedy this disobedience, you need to take this opportunity obey the Lord and change the unbiblical path you've been on, the ""path"" has been a rut that's leading you away from your wife and away from God.   God never says ""tough luck."" Your trials are part of His wise and loving fatherly plan to train and teach you to love and trust him more. So he gives, and he takes, but blessed be the name of the Lord either way.   Separating PMO from the biblical requirements of intercourse in your marriage is important.    achieving an inner peace about an unhealthy and even unbiblical ""path"" is not a true peace. But I do understand what you mean: you're doing your best (I think) to manage with the lot in life that you feel you've been given.    I would simply say: if that' your situation, you need to be the leader in your home and press for a Christian marriage, which includes a healthy regular sexual relationship.   obedience and love for God go together. We obey even when we don't ""feel like it"" simply because we know God has loved us and we are living in , and living out, our love for Him.   marriage obedience is the same thing, based on the same principles.   with great hope in Christ,  BA."

If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.  Psalm 34 love this... http://bible.com/59/psa.34.3-8.ESV Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!  I sought the Lord , and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.

If you aren't already, reading the bible as much as possible will bring you closer to God and thus provide you with all you need to fight off temptation. * I specifically recommend the videos The Gospel and Forgiveness by Matt Chandler on youtube, but there are gazillions out there.

I am constantly fighting a state of free floating internal angst and discomfort that I want to numb up for or be distracted from, that in some cases will drive me to do crazy things take great risks, in other cases will drive me to get over caffeinated, over eat, listen to too heady music, and in the past: masturbate.... so for me it's been daring to peel the layers of the onion back, and dare to be open to the idea that what really is at the root of this is  a desire for true fulfillment in Him, while at the same time standing up and using every trick known to man to stop the flow of self destructive and distracting addictive behaviors....  I guess where I relate somewhat is in my tendency to procrastinate pursuing fulfilling discipline and activities. There can be a lack of drive there: putting things off, being OK with the status quo. I was no longer ok with the status quo of PMO, and finally after 10 years, I feel I have broken free... the irony though is that it is now no longer that hard to maintain... I have to be careful of course... but my mind will drift down certain pathways that in the past would have ended up in PMO... but now they no longer slip into the destructive cycle... the pull towards PMO has been broken... what is odd here is that when the pull was there, and more of a fight was needed, I was doing better, was closer to God... now things have drifted and the urgency has decreased...

Love the Lord with all your mind by identifiying the PMO-triggers in your life and ask yourself how you best could avoid these so to reduce temptations. Also make sure you develop good and healthy habits like doing excercise, reading the Bible and praying every day.   I wish you all the best in this Furrable. God bless you"
NoFapChristians,3b3av4,new_life55,11,Thu Jun 25 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"Single here as well, so I lack the experience of married life.  Brace for text wall.  I think, in general, the rule to follow is not to find the right person, but to be the right person.  That is, be the type of person that the type of person you want to marry would want to marry.  If I wanted to date/marry an athlete, I would start exercising and playing sports.  If I wanted a relationship with a bookworm, I would start reading literature and hanging out at libraries and coffee shops.  I think the same applies to us Christians, just slightly different because we already are what we all want to marry, if that makes sense.  A woman of God is going to want a man of God, first and foremost, so you've already got that down.  Anything else I feel is just preference.  If you want a woman who puts God fist, then you must put God first, first.  Three things to remember: 1) Be content in the Lord, as this will ""calm you down"" and build confidence.  Girls like confidence.  Don't seem too needy or like you're desperately searching for a spouse.  If you lack confidence then start doing things to start building it, like exercising and eating right.  Taking care of your body and mind is also an integral part of your walk with Christ.  Also, fake it until you make it.  This is more like a skill.  It needs to be cultivated.  2) Girls also want spouses.  By and large, Godly women want Godly men to pursue them.  3) You're more attractive than you think.  Attractiveness is more than how you look, it also includes personality.  I think, by and large, most women will at least be willing to give most guys a chance.  So, be a Godly man who above all seeks his everything in the Lord, and try to improve yourself as much as possible for the glory of God.  I don't think God is glorified when we are overweight and overfed.  I think God can be as glorified on the treadmill or in the squat rack or with good hygiene as much as in the pew.    Practically speaking, get involved with your church and other ministries in your area.  Just be present and serve and get to know people.  Focus on friendship, both male and female.  This will also help you battle PMO, as a huge trigger for many is feeling lonely.  If you feel like you really hit it off with a girl, then ask her if she wants to go get coffee or lunch or something.  Not a date, nothing formal or official, just a chance to get to know someone better.  If you feel like there's chemistry there, then go ahead and ask her on a date (I think it's very important that the word ""date"" comes out of your mouth, it shows intentionality).  Now, while it is important to be intentional, and you date to marry, don't put so much stock into a relationship that you crush it or rush into emotional or physical intimacy.  I have been guilty of this, where myself and a girl would rush emotional intimacy and focus too much on the future.  When you rush intimacy, the end of that relationship will cause immense pain.  Take things slow and just enjoy where you are at.  Guard your heart, and be constantly praying.  And keep it in your pants and keep your hands to yourself.  I'm sure this is a no-brainer, but I myself am guilty of, just 3 weeks ago, going to far physically with a girl.  It became obvious that thing wouldn't work out between us, and because we went too far, the last three weeks have been constant heartache and daily relapses.   Intimacy is wonderful, but in the wrong context it is deadly.    Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters. 1 Timothy 5:2, NLT   Treat every young lady at your church like you would treat your sister.  Guard your own heart, and do what you can to help her guard hers.  If things start to progress into the relationship realm, and you're both up for it, maybe look into not even kissing until you're engaged/married.  Your call, but it might be helpful.  Now, as to where your heart is at.   Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” Genesis 2:8, ESV  He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.  Proverbs 18:22, ESV   God created marriage, and God likes marriage.  When God was creating everything, he announced it as ""good"".  The very first thing he announced as ""not good""?  Man being alone.  Marriage is meant to be an image of Christ and the Church, and is also meant as a means of spreading the Gospel to non-believers.  Do not feel guilty about wanting to find a spouse.  I understand not wanting to turn your church into a dating service, but I think God, by and large, wants His children to marry.  More on that later.  Additionally, many evangelical preachers, Matt Chandler comes to mind here, encourage the men in their congregation to find spouses.  I can't find the exact video, but in one sermon he essentially tells men they should be ""hunting"" for a spouse.  Here's another great Matt Chandler clip   But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion. 1 Corinthians 7:9, ESV   Getting married won't solve your PMO problem, but it may help.  Furthermore, if God gave you the gift of singleness, I don't think He would put the desire for a spouse on your heart.  He may have, just to force you to seek your all in Him, which would actually be a far greater blessing than any spouse.   But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. 1 Corinthians 7:28, ESV   Paul says that marriage leads to many worldly troubles.  But we know that James says:   Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.  And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. James 1:2-4, ESV   And that   we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. Romans 5:3-5, ESV   God makes us look more like Christ through marriage.  Not only that, God has ordained it and called it good.  Do not guilt yourself for wanting to find a spouse, because it is through finding a spouse (and to a lesser extent any romantic relationship) that you mature in your faith, grow closer to God, and look more like Jesus.  Even my failed relationships have been integral in my sanctification.  Hope that helps!"
NoFapChristians,3b3av4,slothsNbears,3,Thu Jun 25 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"wow, thank you so much for this.  I really appreciate your use of scripture as well.  I really needed to be reminded (and learn) many of the truths in the bible about marriage, that it is a good thing, that God is still greater, but marriage resembles in many ways Gods covenant to us.  Thank you for all that!  I am going to come back to this post to reference the scripture you quoted many times.  Much appreciated man, my mind is much clearer on the subject now."
NoFapChristians,3b3av4,hopefulwife,4,Thu Jun 25 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"As a wife, I second the responses about working on yourself. You may have a desire for marriage, but that does not mean that you are anywhere near ready for it, and I wouldn't advise dating seriously unless you could honestly see yourself getting married in the near future.   Great damage is done when you get married to a godly woman and you are nowhere near ready. Unfortunately, that was my story - my husband was nowhere close to ready and its been a hard marriage so far. Refining for sure!  In essence, Be the man you would want your daughter or sister to marry and keep talking to God about it. He knows what he's doing."

Work on that and the woman will show up.  God will give you what you need when you need it, don't worry about that part too much."
NoFapChristians,3b3av4,hopefulwife,3,Fri Jun 26 13:22:45 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that we have made christian dating super weird. Be respectful and considerate, and seek God's heart and you can't really go wrong. It's okay to not want to continue after a few dates, it's okay to get into a relationship that breaks up. You don't have to know if you want to marry a woman when you ask to be her boyfriend, but you do need to know that you'd like to find out. The most important part really is friendships. Made deep, real, meaningful friendships with women you could be interested in and women you'd ""never"" be interested in."

NoFapChristians,3b3av4,Acadaqueue,4,Thu Jun 25 23:01:47 2015 UTC,I want to give the above comment a gold star! Excellent points /u/bozwizard14. It's very important to learn how to be friends with women.   All this gender separation the church typically advocates makes things so hard and sexualized friendships far more than they should be. Learning how to be friends with women and have good boundaries with them is a hard won skill that is SO beneficial.
NoFapChristians,3b3av4,jad_seven,2,Thu Jun 25 23:25:34 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what you said, I would recommend that you have a mixture of gender friendships. For the past few years, ironically the only friendships I had were with girls. But unfortunately as a man you can't always be real with girls like you can with guys. And that can sometimes lead to a lot of frustration, as you can't always say what you want to say."
NoFapChristians,3b3av4,Acadaqueue,2,Sat Jun 27 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"My parents have been happily married for 25 years now. They met by a chance encounter, related to their professions and a mutual friend, and as it turned out, they were both Catholic, liked each other, started dating, and got married a couple of years later. Sometimes you might meet a godly woman outside of church, or you might meet them in church. I would recommend going to a bible study, or some kind of social event outside of normal church services, where you can relate on a more personal level and have some time to talk with other people from your church, but don't be afraid to chat with people who may or may not be christian. Sometimes, you get lucky! I wish you luck and I will pray for you.  Edit, My parents found it important to find a partner who was also Catholic, that was a personal thing, not really important, just as an example that you might meet someone with the same values outside of the church."

Are you saying it's wrong to use the internet if it's a temptation? What is the ""difference"" you're speaking of? Would you please elaborate?  I do agree that changing behaviors and daily habits is key. And oddly enough, though it may seem backward, I've found that changing externals in turn changes internals. For example, getting out more, getting a job and laboring unto Jesus, socializing, attending church and learning -- all these things (seemingly) served to help change my heart as I submitted to the Lord and continue, in His grace, to do so."

It needs to be coupled with the desire to love, obey, grow in, and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. I encourage you not to focus on preventing relapse, but to focus on laboring unto the Lord, serving Him and others, and seeking to learn more about Him and His heart for you. Suddenly, moral abstinence becomes holy service, and the fear (respect/reverance) of God will come naturally."

NoFapChristians,3az0jx,JIVEprinting,2,Wed Jun 24 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"Hi Hotline,  Hormones are indeed one part of the urge towards sex. We all have God given sexual desires. These, in themselves, are not sinful. Try and think on why you specifically act on these urges in ungodly ways.   Is it when you feel lonely? Is it when you feel stressed? What are you watching on TV? Internet?...etc.  All sin is a symptom of a deeper primary heart issue, that being your relationship with God. All sin is rebellion against God and his design. So, perhaps one of the deeper issues for you is that you don't trust God? You don't actually believe he knows what he is talking about when he says to abstain from sexual immorality. You know the law, but you don't trust him.   What we do in life is usually dictated by pleasure. We eat nachos because we think it will bring us pleasure. We don't eat nachos if we have an upset stomach, because not having an upset stomach is pleasurable. You watch porn because you think it will bring more pleasure than not watching porn. And that is our natural tendency.  Does Christ look more pleasurable to you than sin? How is your relationship with Jesus?"

NoFapChristians,3azcfx,Ks50on,5,Wed Jun 24 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"I prayed for you.  I encourage you to ask the Lord to help you discipline your mind, to recognize such thoughts for what they are, and reject them with the truth. I'll offer insight from my perspective.  Example: I see a girl dressed inappropriately or immodestly. There is inherent temptation to lust. Knowing this, I take what action I can and look elsewhere until I am out of sight. I do this not out of moral abstinence, but out of love for Jesus, my girlfriend, the other person involved, and others (sin has overlapping consequences). Don't feed temptation lest you birth a sin.  For what you went through, I would probably get on my knees, pray, and ask God to help me and also pray for others. If necessary, repeat until able to get to sleep. That may sound simple but there's no reason to complicate things. You could also try reading scripture or just reading any appropriate material."
NoFapChristians,3ax906,WatchTheSunset1,3,Wed Jun 24 06:07:03 2015 UTC,"Temptation is everywhere. There's no debating that. However, temptation on your internet device is different than temptation in public. On the internet device, you're likely alone or can easily become alone, which will likely increase temptation further. In public... well, you're in public. The two scenarios are very different, despite both being tempting. Don't minimize the benefits of limiting internet usage simply because ""temptation is everywhere"". That's more or less like saying, ""we all die anyway, so what's the point in living"". I don't view safe internet usage or limited usage as only a covering-up of the problem. I see it as a proactive way to combat a temptation that can easily lead to a devastating and debilitating sin which separates me from intimacy with and growth in Jesus. But I'm not an advocate for mere abstinence anyway. Simply resisting isn't enough. You need to replace the joy-killing affection for pornography and masturbation with an affection(s) which is good and life-giving. Serve others. Read/study the bible and use God's promises to fight lies. Pray, openly, honestly, whenever you can. Do spiritually and practically productive things with your time all out of a desire to love, obey, grow in, and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. This is a good place to start."
NoFapChristians,3ax906,McQueenz,3,Wed Jun 24 10:54:48 2015 UTC,"I feel that we need to strengthen ourselves at the root, as in focusing on resisting urges even when exposed to triggers     This is absolutely true,and Jesus is the source of that healing.  But, that doesn't mean we are suppose to test ourselves by allowing triggering content to come before our eyes.  The Bible says to immediately flee from temptation.  For me, Facebook and twitter are terrible, the struggle is much easier without them in my life, and I have more time.  If I replace internet time with questionable TV time, now then there may be no improvement.  Cutting internet time is one of many ways of battling this addiction;  Its not the end all, but it can help."

NoFapChristians,3ax906,fapstronaut85,2,Wed Jun 24 06:46:15 2015 UTC,"I once did a whole detox of technology. I got rid of my roku, internet, computer. I used a flip phone with no access to internet. I lived by myself and had no access to porn or any movie with nudity in it at all.  And about a week later I walked 3 miles at night to the nearest adult video store.   Porn always finds a way.  I do believe that using blocking software or limiting access are two very important and helpful tools. But they are not a solution.  The solution for most of us isn't in simply avoiding the temptation, because you never can fully. We need to find the root cause of our desire for porn in the first place. For me, I run to porn because of shame and fear that I have built up since I was a child. I run to porn because of stress and selfishness. I run to porn because I am believing lies about myself that are contrary to what God says about me.  So on one hand there can be great strength in taking the discipline to limit your access to porn, but on the other hand, the real issue that is leading you to porn is much deeper and nothing will change until you get to that."

NoFapChristians,3ax855,fapstronaut85,3,Wed Jun 24 07:04:49 2015 UTC,"You have to consciously seek the Lord.

Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth."" (Colossians 3:1-2)      ""Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near"" (Isaiah 55:6)      It is not easy to continually seek His presence and our lives are filled  with endless obstacles we must get around in order to see him clearly. We must flee every spiritually dulling activity. Set your heart on the Lord and pray everyday that He would help you to grow in your love for Him.

NoFapChristians,3ax855,chaos_walks,2,Wed Jun 24 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"We have a lot to learn about the love of Jesus.  Peter writes, those who will be saved, will barely be saved.  Sometimes I think that it is because we are so steeped in sin, we don't even realize how sinful we are.  Yet Jesus still loves us.  He died for every sin you commit.  I often think that if I don't use porn or lust, that it is one less sin laid on the shoulders of Christ.  Fortunately there is no condemnation in Christ, but as Paul writes a seared conscious is an enemy of a disciple possibly compromising your faith.  However, Jesus can soften hard hearts, and he can restore your conscious.  So no matter what happens during this season, remember, seasons don't last forever.  Keep fighting the Good Fight, and The Spirit of God himself will help you.  If you look to Christ to change you, he will.

I haven't found the secret to beating the beast altogether, but I have learned some things. Actions speak louder than emotions. We can't live by how we feel. We have to change our habits. Add a prayer or devotion or meditation to your routine. Try fasting for a day or even for a couple meals. I've found when I'm caught in a binge that daily reading a Christian writer like C.S. Lewis really snaps me out of it. If we rely on inspiration to resist we will fail every time. Discipline and obedience are the keys to winning the day."

God is immutable and timeless, He cannot change, it goes against His very nature.  God is not bound by time, and in my feeble understanding of God, it would seem that He exists at all times, simultaneously.  He does not love some future version of you or the past you, but then despise you as you are now.  If I understand this correctly, God loves you just as much now as He does on the day of Christ, and as much as He did before you ever even looked at porn, and as much as He did as He was laying the foundations of the Earth.  Because to God, all these things are occurring simultaneously.       Take three minutes and watch this sermon jam.

Every week, when I meet with my community  group, at the end we break up( Boys go one way, girls the other) and we say what we need prayer for. We didn't do it last sunday, but the time before I asked for them to pray for me about lust. I don't think that is enough though. I think I too am going to tell someone in my christian group of friends about my problem this week when we meet up. I too am unsure if I really want others to know me that personally, however it is sacrifice I'm willing to make so that one day I can be free from PMO.

I also started to begin and end my days in prayer and reading. Continue to pray and ask God to change/soften your heart. Lastly, get more involved with church throughout the week. Join the men's ministry or an accountability group. Being able to tell the men's group at my church my and knowing that they are praying for me has been very helpful. Trust and believe in God, and your battle will soon be over. Immerse yourself in Christ. Think about him all day. When the temptations come, focus on the cross. Think about why Christ died for us.

The battle belongs to the Lord  When temptation comes, and the fire is really burning, I give up completely. Sometimes the gym is my escape, but sometimes, all I can do is be still because the next physical move I make is gonna be the wrong one. Stillness for me at times is more or less collapsing on the floor and just laying there for a while until I feel physically calm enough to move again.  There is absolutely nothing to focus on but God in these heated moments. The minute you start reasoning to yourself why you shouldn't do wrong you're engaging your own mind and give satan something to use against you.

Maybe in the beginning the temptations were less sneaky because we didn't realize the pit we'd fall into with this, but in recovery, in trying to keep on the path, we get those sneaky ones.  It feels like every struggle with this is different because of the different forms the temptations take.  Once you learn to control and fight back against one, two more takes its place (like Hydra!).  We must be constantly vigilant."

Personally though, I must say, I wouldn't reset my counter for something like that even though I respect your committment to not going back to old habits. I'm saying this beause we can actually expose ourselves to a certain risk in setting too high standards for ourselves. Remember that being tempted is not a sin - even Jesus was tempted - and if we were to treat every temptation as a sin we would soon be cruched under the weight of it. Being cruched --> anxiety --> PMO. Also, if we blur the line between being tempted and giving in to temptations, wouldn't that just remove our will to fight against temptations? For me it would.  Now I'm not saying you do this, but what you're describing is, as far as I can tell, pretty close to it, and I would be careful not to expose myself to that risk. Doing that will just bring you down and take the joy of making progress and fighting sin away from you. God bless you whatever you decide in this."

NoFapChristians,3as7kj,trophenius,3,Tue Jun 23 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"Hi there HF.   I admire the zero tolerance policy you have. But I did want to make a point about the fantasies you described.   The Bible does say to rejoice in the wife of your youth. If I heard what you said come out of my husband's mouth i would be overjoyed.   You see, last weekend he told me that he has gotten an erection from thinking about me and was excited about sex with me...for the first time ever. We've been married for 2 years. I was heartbroken. Immediately the devil came to me and jabbed at all my insecurities and I had to go fight for my marriage against him.   I could have let the jabs take me, but instead I'm working in being grateful for this progress. That my husband was thinking of me instead of just sex with....anyone in general.   So in essence, I don't think fantasizing and anticipating this beautiful reconciliation moment with your wife is bad. There are many good and wonderful things in life that we get excited about and dream over. Why? Because those events and gifts are things from God. Your wife is a gift, and as long as you continue to honor her and love her in those thoughts, ( and don't wreck the car! :p) I don't see a problem.   But this is between you and God and please do what brings you closer to holiness. if my words are a hindrance to you then I am sorry."
NoFapChristians,3as7kj,Blueaugustine,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:40:20 2015 UTC,"They are no hinderance, and I thank you for them.  The reason this is a problem is that we are separated right now, and she is litterally in another man's bed as I type this.  If you would like more info than that I'm willing to share, but by PM.    One of the ... intereresting things for me in this journey is that fantasies of her have been in all my ""close"" moments.  Although I have had the occasional thought of something I'd seen in porn, it hasn't gotten to me anywhere near as much as her.  None of those moments have produced anything more than a ""Satan get behind me.""  On the one hand it means my mind isnt as warped as I was worried about at first, but on the other when she hugs me ... I have gone without any physical affection (which is my top love language) in so long that thats enough to get me going now.    Thank you for your words again."

Whenever we do this,hardmode style,every self-stimulating activity counts as a relapse...you and your wife need to get very clear on this and she needs to recognise her responsibility  here,you are going to have to come to an agreement about triggering your old behaviours...hopefully she will cooperate.

Think of this, too, /u/hurtingfather/ you will be able to look at this reset for what it is, which is (on the order of things) not as serious as it could be, and the sign of some good things to come: both in your life (if she comes back) and in your walk with Christ (you're keeping a rigorous standard of holiness).  What does sex and MO offer us that we ""have to have""? We need Christ, more than anything else. It is him.

NoFapChristians,3aqy99,billybobpoopdeck,5,Mon Jun 22 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"I will pray for you and I will also share with you some wisdom that helped me SO much.   You must realize that in order to overcome temptation, you have to put the problem in God's hands, not your own. Philippians 4:13 says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me, not I can do all things cuz I'm pretty cool and have some willpower of my own.  1 Cor 10:13 says ""No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.""  This is amazing to me. God actually is there with an outstretched hand to help you out of this funk.   Ever since I gave up on trying to keep myself from doing it and asked God to give me His strength through the Holy Spirit, I haven't even been tempted to fap. In fact the thought of it actually disgusts me.  I asked God to put a bad taste in my mouth for it. And He has blessed me for it.   Another thing I want to say is a quote from evangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth: ""If you busy yourself with the work of the Lord, you wont have to worry about your own battles with sin because you won't have time to sin"" I would encourage you to get more involved with your church community if you aren't already. I volunteer doing housekeeping at church two days a week, I play hockey with the young adults twice a week, we have our bible study and prayer meetings saturdays, church league softball twice a week, etc. I am incredibly busy I'm pretty much only at home to sleep, shower and change clothes anymore."

Please take time to ""shop around"" and test out some churches and find one that suits you. I had been roaming for a long time after leaving my childhood church. I must have gone to a dozen different churches in the area before finding Epic Church, where I'm proud to be a part of how God is working in our community, both within and without.   This was the first church Ive been to where I actually felt like part of the church and not just some attendee. My friends and I started a bible study prayer group where we talk and pray together, encourage and inspire each other every day.  I thank God for that relationship every day.

For me, I've benefitted greatly in thinking about boredom and Matthew 6, ""...each day has enough trouble of its own."" Is my boredom a sign that I'm not giving myself wholly to the troubles of today, and instead, a) pretending like they're not there; or b) overly worried about them, or other troubles from another day?  I also think worship is part awe, part fear, part joy.   No parts boredom in true worship. Can you imagine St. John in his apocalypse being bored at the feet of the ""Lamb who was slain from before the foundation of the world""?   hOw can we live in such joy and awe and fear of God that we're never bored? or at least we go to him and beg for mercy and help when we feel bored?  with great hope in Christ!"

NoFapChristians,3aqoay,Blueaugustine,2,Mon Jun 22 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"I think /u/drjellyjoe/ is right that this question could be off topic for our subreddit. But for the record, Judas Iscariot did not go to heaven when he died, but went to the place prepared for him. His repentance was not true repentance, but mere ""worldly sorrow"" that leads to death.  I do not however believe that in all cases suicide is evidence that someone was not truly saved or chosen or elect or forgiven. On the contrary, all sins can be forgiven--and are forgiven, if we take God's ""birds eye view""--even before they are committed.  But these are great mysteries which can lead people astray easily to one of two extremes: despair, or presumption.  For people who struggle with PMO, we should keep an eye out for the kind of despair that would lead us to take our own lives. I think everyone here probably at one point or another has struggled with such thoughts.  I myself had a discouraging day today--not to the point of feeling suicidal, but these kinds of days are difficult, aren't they?  let's put our hope in Christ."

It's amazing just how much you want to feel confident in yourself, that you want to put up stumbling blocks.  The whole time I was thinking, oh, I'll be fine, I can fight this, I don't need to do this, but because of my commitment on here, I felt I HAD to do it.  So I did.  For the most part, it was a beneficial experience.  I couldn't check FB one more time before turning out the light.  And then in the morning after the wife left, I was left alone in bed, with nothing but my books and bible by my bedside.  It was nice really, not being bombarded with visual stimuli (of any kind) upon waking up.  I felt a little restless, and I don't like that.  Meaning, I don't like the fact that I have become accustomed to a way of life, that if I change it up a little bit, I feel on edge.  Anyway, by the grace of God I have made it out of the ""smiley face"" days.  I HATE the smiley face days!

NoFapChristians,3anphp,Matt_5_27-30,3,Mon Jun 22 00:29:26 2015 UTC,Wet dreams are totally normally. They are a way for your body to release sexual tension when it is used to getting a regular release. It happens at varying times for different people.    The part of your post here that really worries me is your speaking of lying next to a special girl in your bed. From looking through your post history I am assuming your not married so that would be someone is not your wife. I wonder if you need to remind yourself what your own verse says that is your user name. [Matthew 5:27-30].   If your eye causes you to stumble gouge it out for it is better to lose an eye than it is to go to hell with both eyes. Is this how you are living? Are you living in a radical manner?  What about the girl that you are sleeping with? Are you treating her like the sister in Christ and daughter of God that she is? [1 Timothy 5:2] teaches us to treat our sisters with absolute purity. That is a big calling. Do you want to be a man that exploits people for their own gain or one who honors the women in his life?  Who do you want to be?
NoFapChristians,3anphp,Blueaugustine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:14:34 2015 UTC,"I agree wet dreams can be a normal biological release. However, they can also be the result of basically storing up feelings, thoughts, and images in your head, and then unconsciously releasing those images in a sexual way in your sleeping mind. The result can be basically self-induced MO while sleeping, which can be different than a wet-dream."
NoFapChristians,3anphp,on-a-journey,2,Mon Jun 22 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I have never seen any science to back that kind of thing up.

NoFapChristians,3anphp,on-a-journey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:29:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, I'm not married. ""Special girl"" implies wife. Perhaps I should have said ""hypothetically speaking"" instead of ""potentially could have"" or something of a mix of words or phrases. There is no wife or special girl, but I just wanted to point to the embarrassment if there were. No worry, if these young ladies knew that I had a habit looking at porn and masturbating, they would stay as far away from my bed as the devil wishes to distance himself from the Lake of Fire. Plus all of my sexual desires are directed a lot more towards porn and masturbating than a real girl and I know that is not the goal of Matt. 5:27-30. Thank you for your concern on-a-journey, but my bevy of problems are not conducive to any woman (wife or otherwise) being in my bed any time soon."

I do believe God has given us free will, but I also know that God knows what choices we will make.  I also know there are consequences, both natural and deserved, for disobedience to God, but I also know that God's offer of redemption is for all those who call upon the name of the Lord.  I also know that God will bring victory to those he has called (or those whom have surrendered themselves to the lord;  Different theological labels, but same basis and meaning).    You appear to have the knowledge of both paths set before you.  Let the fear of the Lord decide your ways.  Let the grace of God decide your ways.

Events and circumstances that have just seemed unnatural. To which the only explanation I can come up with is the workings of providence.  Some people say the purpose is to develop our character. I can certainly verify that. But I don't see the reason as to why God would go through so much trouble to make life miserable for me in order to accomplish that.   There seems to be a lot of contradictions and yet a lot of truth. Sometimes I wonder what really is true and what is not. As the world seems a lot more grey to me now then black and white. I hope you find your answer.

(Nor much effort to make it better, since that is God's promise.) For example in Job, it was God's allowing, rather than acting, which caused Job's misery.   What contradiction do you see? If the purpose is to develop your character (a substitute for many words), is that not reason enough? Have you found that your character develops under any other circumstance, perhaps a less miserable one? (I haven't! So I say...whatever it takes.)"

For many in my generation (early 20's) it's just the sheer access that can ""cause"" the addiction. You don't even really have to seek it out- it just finds you.   My husband for a long time was troubled by the fact that there ""should"" be a wound of some sort that drove him to porn, but he never really found one, which for him mentally seemed to make recovery harder - there wasn't a specific thing to fix that would make everything better.

Unfortunately, it was totally useless. I admit it. I can never change for the better if I put God out of the equation. I realized that. I realized that I can't do this alone. I need help from God and also other people because when I rely on my own strength and my intentions driven by my pride and self-righteousness, I will never succeed in beating this addiction.    Your posts made me realize this. That I can't go alone in this. And I don't have to. I still live a life of hypocrisy where people thinks that I'm ""innocent"" when actually I'm not.

NoFapChristians,3akmhp,Matt_5_27-30,3,Sun Jun 21 03:11:07 2015 UTC,"Unhappiness definitely isn't ""good."" How could it be? Unhappiness is a result of sin in the world, so of course it isn't good, but that doesn't mean it's wrong to be unhappy. In fact, Jesus' unhappiness is recorded at two key points in his ministry. First, at the death of Lazarus. Jesus is going to raise Lazarus from the dead shortly, but still he weeps with the family of the deceased, because he cared about Lazarus. Here Jesus is weeping because of someone's death, and we know death is caused by sin, so his unhappiness is a result of something bad. Again, on the night before Jesus is crucified, he weeps in the garden as he prays about what he knows he must suffer, but does not want to suffer. So, in the Gospels we have examples of Jesus unhappy/sorrowful for what has happened, and also for what will happen.    On a separate note, Paul says that grief can drive us to repentance. 2 Corinthians 7:9-10 ""I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.""    So, if what has happened in Charleston bothers you because you also see the sin in your own heart, then let that drive you to repentance. Sin can make monsters of us all, but Jesus came to show us that his love conquers all sin and death."

I think I went to ""tunnel vision"" because I thought that pmo is what I really wanted, and I chose to ignore that it is wrong.  I had to block out everything to get myself to do it, because I thought it would fulfill me, thought its what I really wanted, but knew it was wrong so had to ignore all else.  The truth is, though, that Jesus Christ is actually all we ever wanted from the start.  We wanted to be forgiven, accepted, loved.  We wanted genuine relationships with other.  We thought pmo promised these things, but praise God we know now how much of a lie it was from the beginning!    Then, as you say, that's when the devil uses his second punch.  Tells us ""Your a porn addict"" ""your trash"".  Watching porn didnt make us sinner, it *is evidence that we are already sinners from our hearts.  Jesus said in Matthew 15:11     it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”     The second truth is that God died for us, even though we were all trash, to display His glory in us as redeemed believers.  We need deliverance from ourselves!  Paul proclaimed in Romans 7:24-25     What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!

The music is so simplistic it bores me to tears, and if you look at the lyrics they're pretty bad. Just look at the song '10,000 reasons' by Matt Redman. Never once does he mention one of his 10,000 reasons, its just the repeated lyrics of ""I'll worship your holy name"" and ""Jesus I will worship your holy name"" and ""sing like never before."" He only gets as close to saying stuff like ""you're rich in love"" which is a weird thing to say when he is love. This kind of stuff plagues modern christian music, and I'd have to say: stick to the old hymns that actually try to give praise to god instead of like this song, the ultimate procrastination song, where he never praises god throughout the entire thing."

You are a child of god, perfectly loved and not hated because of its sin, because you are crucified with him. Deny self, because its dead. If self shouts PMO shout back shut up, im a loved child of god, that it does good to me is a lie, this is his holy temple, i combine my soul with hers when i do that, he is my daddy and wants me to be free.  PMO is not even an issue anymore when you understand the truth about this and who you are. Temptation remains, but its not an issue anymore.

NoFapChristians,3agx08,Lanzy44,3,Sat Jun 20 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings. I draw a lot of my inspirations from these books especially because of its roots in Christianity. I have not been doing well lately. I confess that I have been binging in the past few days, just constantly falling into this sin. Even after prayer and reading, I choose my sin. After all of that, I was immediately reminded of this scene in Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Though this is from the movie, it is also in the book which I suggest reading and where I first come across this scene. I watched this clip and remembered the thoughts I had when I first read this. ""Just get rid of it Bilbo! It's just a ring! Why is he being so stubborn?"" etc, etc. It was obvious Gandalf was trying to help Bilbo, after all he has seen many evils and that ring tops them all. Gandalf knew what was best for the little, feeble hobbit yet Bilbo opposes Gandalf for his ""precious."" I was very frustrated reading this but then a voice in the back of my head hit me like a bag of bricks. ""That is you"" said this voice. I was dumbfounded and I reread the scene and put myself in Bilbo's place. I was instantly chilled. Gandalf has many ties with Jesus and is even the metaphor for Jesus in these books, it is very obvious here. Jesus demands we let go of this sin. It is corrupting, destructive, and fleeting. Like Bilbo and his ring, I hoard my sin not wanting to let go. But unlike Bilbo, I don't let go. After Gandalf shows Bilbo how powerful he can be, Bilbo snaps out of the trance and gives it up because he realizes what he has become. God flexes His power all of the time and, like a fool, I ignore it. I learned a lot here and I hope you all can see yourselves here too. This just isn't worth it. Give up your ring, Jesus is better."
NoFapChristians,3agx08,new_life55,3,Sat Jun 20 02:17:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, I love this allegory.  Gandalf (Jesus) saves bilbo (us) From ""his"" ring (our sins) to something much greater: not only freedom from sin, but an eternal relationship with Him    Edit: p.s., Gollum's death would be akin to ours if we don't give up our sin"

I would not necessarily agree with: ""NOFAP isn't easy. but it isn't impossible either. all you have to do is do it.""  Nofap is for sure not easy nor is it impossible. But, this type of white knuckled attack on it hardly ever produces lasting change. Usually just more guilt and shame when you figure out your strength isn't as strong as you thought it was.   All things we do in life usually center around pleasure. If I study for a test, it's because I think an A will bring more pleasure than an F. If I don't study, it's because I think watching Netflix will bring more pleasure than studying. Right?  The reason I decide to look at porn or fap is because I think it will bring more pleasure than not fapping or looking at porn. So, if this is a game of the affections and pleasures... how are we to fight? With a death grip (no pun intended) approach centered around our will and discipline? Or on the pleasures and affections side?  May the Gospel and relationship with God seem more pleasurable than sin. I think that is how we fight this battle. By re-ordering our affections. I could go on and on.. but just some thoughts. :)"
NoFapChristians,3af9pb,DJ_Pace,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"what you're talking about highlights the anxiety that a lot of starting fapstronauts are strangled with. many rookies think that they can't white-knuckle it, because that's not the ultimate solution. they're looking for the perfect solution to go forward with, and until they find it, they keep relapsing and blaming the old strategies.   the problem is that the addict's mind has been so devastated by addiction that he isn't seeing clearly. what actually is the ultimate solution happens to be the one he is least attracted to, and in my case many times, the one solution he immediately dismisses without even a second thought, automatically.   There are phases to jump through. One is the white-knuckle approach. yOu have to build up some abstinence before you can tackle the underlying problems that have generated the wound, the wound that the addict once medicated with compulsive behavior. once abstinence for a certain duration is achieved, a breakthrough is possible elsewhere.   i don't like the derogatory treatment of perseverance, calling it 'white-knuckling'. often, it takes some real bravery to get through those nights, and it's the pussies who are always waiting for the best solution to pop out of the sky, always wondering 'how do i quit, how do i quit, is there a better way' who make no progress.   one does not simply pursue abstinence, but abstinence is the appetizer to the rest of the meal, and the entree is where the deep work begins. but without abstinence, one is still an addict."

We don't know what that was, but his speaking of it reminds me of your post. 1 Corinthians 12:7-10   7 Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself! 8 Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. 9 And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. 10 Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.

You can tell a mans character by how he does this.  Especially with older people.  I usually am very on my guard about someone who doesn't do this, as it shows their intentions are not clear.     So start with that.  Its not appropriate to shake a woman's hand unless she offers first.  Eye contact  is important so wjat you could do is give a nod when u say hello.   Eye contact is important when you.meet someone . You come off as untrust worthy if you don't look them in the eye when you meet.  Later on during the conversation you don't need to keep eye contact all the time, but make sure to look at them once and a while to show that you are listening.     If you fins yourself lusting of people in front of you, remind yourself that this is a brother/sister.  This maybe someone's mother/father or son/daughter.    Ask yourself, is this showing love for god or people?  If not say scripture to yourself in your head like  -  I've made a covenant with my eyes that I will not look at someone lustfully.

Don't just ban a couple, ban them all, any site you can think of that you ever go to for porn.

NoFapChristians,3aaieh,PMBorisStoke,3,Thu Jun 18 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"One thing we should always remember, every day, is that we are sinners (all with specific sins) saved by the grace of God.  Live with that humility.  For me, I have had 11 months, 6 months, 3 months streaks without pmo.  For 2 of these occasions, it was after I came home from school.  I was tired of work in generall, and my lack of self-discpline and laziness led to a relapse and then ultimately terrible ""breaks"".  I guess, for me, God brought me to points of freedom where it became natural to ignore temptation.  I relapsed more from slowly drifting away from God and being sucked back into the secular world, and the ole devils curosity came.  For me, the most recent wisdom I have come to realize is that curiosity with sin is never satisfied.  It is always cruddy, comes with baggage, and is a sin against God.  He says in his word, don't grow tired of doing good, for in due season you will reap good fruit!"
NoFapChristians,3aaieh,new_life55,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:36:07 2015 UTC,Thank you for this comment.  It is encouraging to me today.
NoFapChristians,3aaieh,Blueaugustine,3,Thu Jun 18 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"absolutely yes I worry about that.  When I feel I'm getting lax, I up the ante and confess some new thing to someone, or go on a fast, or cold shower, or press into some painful part of my life (where I""m tempted to procrastinate). That is usually a good fog-dispeller. Memorize Scripture, for example. Hard to do that ""in a lazy fog.""  Ba."
NoFapChristians,3aaieh,ChosunOne,2,Fri Jun 19 02:55:14 2015 UTC,"Speaking from my own experience in the last 34 days it comes in waves timed about a week or two apart.  For the first two weeks it was relatively easy to avoid temptation, but the third week I was really struggling.  It seemed to taper off about the beginning of the fourth week and I can start to feel some strength of will come to me to avoid lesser and lesser degrees of lust.    One way I have been thinking about it is like pains after circumcision.  I'm still hurting from the operation, but it will heal.  So I look at those temptations as simply aches of my spirit, and God is doing his work in me and my spirit will be healed to the point where it doesn't hurt so much.    I think this analogy matches well, because initially there really was a pain for me to not give in.  At first I missed giving in, but there was real pain.  Rather than give in and try to numb the pain by damaging myself more, I will let it ache so that it can heal.  I think it is ok to let myself feel the pain when I deny temptation, so that I can see ""wow, I still need a lot more of God's grace"".  Thankfully our God is not short on grace!"

I will put MO with sexual immorality if my thoughts turn to lust. Other than that, MOing just seems impure and pathetic. If I MO, I give into the temptations, and I show the world that I have no self control. Lastly in James 4:17, ""If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them."" I know that P, MO is bad, I know it causes great pain in my life and or others. So, with that, it is a sin if I do not abstain from P, MO.   Try not to take everything I say literal, but to keep it in mind.

NoFapChristians,3abdre,CrouchingLynx,4,Thu Jun 18 18:53:18 2015 UTC,"The problem with C.S. Lewis is that he is so highly respected that his quotes are prone to be taken to be of equal truth as the Bible, which is quite dangerous.   If you examine all of his writings, you'll likely find some beliefs he held that most Christians today would balk at. I know there are some works of his I've read that don't sit quite right with me. Some of his musings are purely exploratory, and some people take them to be theological.   I'm glad you are thinking this through critically! And unless you find Scripture that corroborates with him, I wouldn't take his word to be biblical."
NoFapChristians,3abdre,hopefulwife,0,Thu Jun 18 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, I don't recall C.S. Lewis saying that his work is infallible."
NoFapChristians,3abdre,YohanAnthony,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:10:51 2015 UTC,I never said that - but many Christians quote his work as if it were biblical.
NoFapChristians,3abdre,hopefulwife,3,Thu Jul 2 11:48:31 2015 UTC,"Well, this is quite the quote isn't it?  I have to say, it is an interesting one but I'm not sure how biblical it really is.  In one sense, he may be correct, in that being a ""cold, self-righteous prig"" is likely to remove you further from becoming a Christian, even if you are in church, because with that kind of attitude, do you even know the Lord with a saving faith?  But, for us professing Christians, bought by the blood of Christ, resting in the promises and grace that he gives us... there is no room for that kind of attitude, not that we are guaranteed not to have it, yet Paul says, sexual sin has an altogether different kind of affect on us Christians.  It has something to do with the fact that we as part of the Body of Christ, members of his ""church"".  The go to against this would be 1 Corinthians 6:12 -20.   “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.” But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him. Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body."
NoFapChristians,3abdre,Corinthians1013,3,Thu Jun 18 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly ""biblical"" in the sense it's taken straight from scripture. I think what he's saying here is that there is (or was) a tendency in Christendom to look down upon sexual sins as the worst, and to gloss over, miss, or ignore sins like spiritual pride, self-righteousness, and condemning or abusing others -- sins like that, sins that are sometimes hard to notice or easier to cover up. I think his point is that a prostitute may outwardly seem or appear more a sinner than the person in the pew every sunday who is inwardly just as bad, if not worse. And he is likely correct in that regard, as the church-goer is probably mired in spiritual pride, much like the pharisees. In fact this reminds me of [John 8:1-11]. The takeaway is that both people are sinners in need of Jesus Christ and his great mercy and grace. The prostitute is just likely more receptive to this truth, while the pharisee types are often blind to it."
NoFapChristians,3abdre,McQueenz,2,Thu Jun 18 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not Biblical. It's Lewisical.  People have been commenting about Scripture for a long time. Some of those comments are more helpful than others. If this comment draws you closer to Jesus; if it encourages you to think more critically about your own interior life and challenges you to expose more of your self to the control of the Holy Spirit, then in my opinion, that's a good thing."
NoFapChristians,3abdre,HisEdlyness,2,Thu Jun 18 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I also meant to say, the sentence right before your quote here, is an awesome one and very fitting concerning pursuing chastity in general:   Virtue-even attempted virtue-brings light; indulgence brings fog."

As a Catholic, sins of the flesh are terrible but it's important to recognize that many sins are truly far worse, pride being an example.  Please, though, do not use this as an excuse to remain entrenched in sexual sins. Our Lord made it clear: ""Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.""  We cannot expect to be in union with the Lord if we sin sexually and think that merely avoiding other sins will be okay."

I am also encouraged by your transparency, both here, and that you opened up with people at your church and your girlfriend!

There's a tendency where once you admit to someone, you don't ever want to let them know that your still struggling after that.  I pray and am confident that they will respond with grace, and be a huge aid in this battle.  That is great that your girlfriend is on the same team with you as well, and your decision to allow God to be the center of this relationship.  My advice here also would be, if you think you want to marry her, to go ahead and do it, but I am not an expert on marriage ;).    Also, getting rid of facebook/socialmedia/internet usage is great!  All the things you have mentioned are things that I have found to be very helpful in my struggle, and I pray that you will find that to be true for you as well.    From here, there are a few other things I can suggest.  One would be to frequent this subreddit often.  Try to relate to people, ask for support when your struggling, and help other out as well.  Also, trying reading a book about this struggle.  I have found Tim Chester's Closing the Window to be very helpful.  He goes through a really great understanding of our bible with this sin, identifys, many of its underlying causes.  The most helpful thing I found with it is that he uses scripture really well to make me see and believe how worthless this sin is!

Here we are, struggling, many of us too alone, scared, and ashamed to really get out there and receive the help we need; it feels a little backwards. Sure, there's ""XXX Church"" and other such conferences, but why not a Christianity wide populace of groups in every city? Why does the secular SA community win out here? Maybe I'm just not realizing that they are out there, but hushed, like most churches do on this topic anyway I've noticed.

Take hope, the only sin that God cannot forgive is unrepentant sin.    Now, I would like to explain to you my understanding of the ""unpardonable sin"" mentioned in the bible.  It is when the pharisees were claiming that Jesus (pure, holy, perfect Lord) was actually demon-possessed evil.  Read Mark 3:28-30     Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, 29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.”  30  He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.”     Jesus is clear that blaspheme against the Holy Spirit is when you essentially goes as far to claim that God/Holy Spirit is the evil one.  This account is repeated in Matthew 12:24-32.  It is so horribly perverse and wrong, some theologians say that if ones heart is in this condition that they are forever lost anyway.  It is also interesting to note that Jesus said that blaspheme in general is forgivable (refer to Matthew passage mentioned above) (only with a truly repentant heart and faith), but it is specifically blaspheme against the Holy Spirit that is unforgivable.    I have also heard some theologians put it this way:  If you are worried that you may have committed the ""unpardonable sin"", then you probably haven't.  Because, if you had, it means that you had confessed that God was evil and acted on it, and, if you believed that, you would not care about your Creator at all.    Don't get me wrong though, all sin especially blaspheme that you have mentioned is so terribly wrong against our Creator who wishes to save us, but it seems you understand this.  Take hope, though, if your faith is in Jesus Christ, then praise God that you are forgiven!"

But if not: will you pray with Job, ""thou he slay me, yet will i praise Him""?  and, with Paul, ""for me to live is Christ and to die is gain""?  There's normally some reason we sin in this way, and eliminating the ""sin"" normally reveals something deeper, more sinister, more blasphemous.  read St. Augustine, he will guide you in this inward journey, which can only result in two possible outcomes: despair, or surrender to the glory and the mercies of God in CHRIST, which puts all questions about when and where and what and how behind us, and calls us to do all for him.

Every time you get an urge, turn on a worship song, pray for several minutes, or read a chapter of scripture. Even if you have to force yourself to do this, it usually works. I just tell myself, that if you want to masturbate, then fine. I just have to do one of these things for 10 or so minutes. I've never immediately failed afterward.

NoFapChristians,39ynrm,trophenius,3,Tue Jun 16 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"in my experience,during my last relapse,i certainly DID pray while fapping...i prayed fervently for strength to overcome this disease and the sins that inevitably accompany it.i prayed for deliverance and not to allow my failure to drag me into a binging session.i prayed for forgiveness from God,my friends here at NFC and myself.i prayed that God would let me see the full depth of my addiction and not to  pretend it  was not placing me in grave spiritual danger.yes,this poor, wretched  sinner certainly DID pray when he was fapping and thankfully God heard his  prayer and tonight i am celebrating 33 days of hardmode freedom in Christ.thankyou Jesus!  so,yes,some ppl HAVE prayed while fapping,and by grace God hears  their prayers:) Stay strong.   c.f.Ps.139:8b"
NoFapChristians,39ynrm,trophenius,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"yes!!! This is by far the best approach.  I think the notion of ""praying will stop fapping"" is in fact toxic: sets you up for failure and potentially cripples your relationship with God. Because it can hold within it all kinds of assumptions: like you should be perfect, God will save you if you from screwing up (rather than have mercy even if you do), what if you pray before and then fap anyway? Now what? you blame God for not coming through...? or yourself for not praying well enough...? it's all nonsense and sets up all kinds of duality...  The best attitude is to be trying with all your might to do what you know is right, and to keep praying for strength, clarity, chastity, love and truth no matter what your current state of your moral coherence. Not praying to just be more morally coherent... but to learn and grow through your current God given circumstances and weaknesses. This leads to real strength. I believe it has been pivotal for me to keep praying even while I was falling in the early days. Because porn has no effect on me now.... I can look it in the face, not get a dopamine rush, see the layers of lies, see the human suffering and have it have not the least hold over me... it is an utter relief... it is true freedom...   One of my favorite passage of Giussani in ""Why the church""... I have written of this before....  which was utterly scandalous to me on first reading... was some tale of a group of thugs planning to rob a nun.... and before their heist... they huddled together and prayed for a successful outcome... despite the fact that they are heinous scoundrels they yet have a concept of God being present in all things and in all times (so much more religious than the typical pious Christian of our day), not the God of perfection, but the God that accompanies us through everything... every circumstance is an opportunity to grow closer to Him... every circumstance was created, or if not directly created: permitted to occur by Him for our ultimate salvation and growth"

So let me share what I do know--if this seems too basic, forgive me but perhaps basic reminders are what might be most helpful?     brave of you to share this. You're not a horrible person, but you are a sinner in need of holiness and redemption and sanctification and heart-change.   Jesus may never ""fix"" or ""change"" you in this life, but you can learn to find more satisfaction and contentment in him than you do today.   this is going to take time and effort.   no one gets freedom from sexual sin (of any kind) without immersion in god's Word and engagement with people in real life who love you unconditionally.   somehow (this is a mystery) God has allowed this in your life to teach you to depend on him. it is your weakness.   you've got to identify the situations and feelings that lead up to this and bring those into the light of God's Word and under the authority of His spirit: walk in the spirit and you will not be able to gratify the desires of the flesh.   my personal opinion is that every so-called ""fetish"" has a godly component to it that the devil, the world, and your own sinful nature has twisted or twists.

Porn addiction is basically normal these days and you just have a variation on it.   My husband didn't have a trauma or anything though that contributed to it, so for him the question of why he was attracted to it may never be answered. That's OK.

The fact that you have this so-called fetish now is because you are addicted to porn. Here is kind of how I see it. I joined nofapchristians for the reason that I have noticed that the things I view are more and more ""unnormal"". But it is if you will to describe it like watching action movies (wait, I do have a point here). Let's take the Fast and Furious series for an example. With every movie, they had to make a new extreme to satisfy the audience. If all the movies were the same, people would have stoped watching them, so they will make the cars drive and explode and jump out of every weird way possible. Back to your fetish. It is just another way that the addiction to porn is spiraling us down and inward, rather than releasing us from our pain. How can you stand before God when your actions are so sinful and immoral? God wants you to come home. That's it. He misses you. And there is nothing that you can ever do for Him to to call you your child. This is not to take for granted, this is to understand what God truly feels about you. I will pray for you. Know that you are a normal guy who has just gotten caught in something that can be escaped from. EDIT: Lord knows I have my own struggles to deal with now but I came to nofapchristians to keep an open conversation and I hope that by inspiring others I can also find healing in my pain."

NoFapChristians,3a04ma,kaiganz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:13:57 2015 UTC,"It's been said by several people here already, but I'll lend my voice as well: take heart. You want to change and you're talking about your problem. Those are both HUGE steps in the right direction right there that you should not underestimate. Way to go!  I would also encourage you to remember how this came about. Your mind slowly acquired an appetite for this thing. You didn't just wake up one day the way you are today. And thankfully, God doesn't ask us to be completely different tomorrow (and if He does, He'll give us the power to do it). Every day as you battle this, it will slowly begin to weaken. It probably won't vanish tonight or tomorrow or next week. But if you are willing to engage in the hard spiritual work of pushing it away day after day, it will be just like lifting weights...the more you do it, the easier it gets and the harder you can push. I used to have things run through my head that I was not proud of all the time. Am I completely over them? No, not yet, but I've made HUGE strides because as I stopped putting those things into my mind, they've lost their strength and slipped away. One example for that was that I remember when I first started kicking porn I would have vivid sexual dreams at night...then I started having dreams that I would wake up and feel like were sexual, but I couldn't really remember specifics...now those things happen extremely rarely and they're very disjointed and not complete. It's almost like the porn parts are literally breaking down...they're fighting back, but not able to mount a strong defense because they haven't been reinforced for so long.   From a more biological standpoint, be encouraged by knowing that the human brain is amazingly elastic. This is a bad thing sometimes (like when we constantly reinforce a fetish and it begins to take over our minds and lives), but the same thing can work in our favor too. As you work through this, you can shape it too. Every day, every action, thought, and choice shapes us a little. Keep making those little decisions correctly and then you'll be shocked how far you can move in a positive direction over time. God WILL renew your mind as you take the steps that He outlined for how to do that: Meditate on scripture, confess your sins, fast and pray, etc.  Lastly, I know that this is going to sound terrifying, but start thinking about how you can work towards telling another real human being about this. Whether that's someone you know or just a professional counselor, the power that sin has over you is directly related to the secrecy. And even though you've shared it here, it's still your secret (your reddit username is kind of a secret and you added another layer of secrecy on top of that!). This is a great first step, but I think that you need the healing that comes from telling a real person this and seeing that they don't scream, they don't run away, they don't say that you're hopeless. Read about steps 4 and 5 in the 12 Step recovery program. They talk about the power behind making an unflinching inventory of your wrongs...but then also sharing them with another person. It's a big part of recovery.  You're not a monster or a psycho. Porn is powerful. Powerful to the point that it twists our minds. It's like a drug. We're different people when we're under its influence. ALWAYS remember that the ""you"" with this fetish is not the REAL YOU. It's very well known that porn can change us into things that we really aren't. For example, it can cause a lot of guys to develop homosexual attractions, but when they stop consuming porn, those desires fade. It isn't an easy road to walk down. It isn't a short one either. But the journey is good and it leads to a good place...unlike the path paved with porn.  I hope that helps. You can do this. You're already on the right path. Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you."
NoFapChristians,3a03yi,Gridsinister,2,Tue Jun 16 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"GS: good questions. Here's my input:     I've been asked to look into whether or not I have had depression, seasonal affect disorder, schizophrenia, manic-depressive stuff, needed medication, and other anger/emotional imbalances in the past. I've done so and have come up with nothing. For me, I'm just a whacked out sinner in need of lots of grace.   I've thought about going away for thirty days or three months to an in patient clinic--more so years ago when I was involved in the 12 step world than today. I know that has helped many guys, but that's not the path I've been given to take I don't think.   I think our subreddit may be divided on this one, but I believe in degrees of sin. That is, it is worse to look at P than it is to think of an old image of P and simply MO. Likewise, it is worse to MO to images of P than it is to MO without such images.    Yet, my view is that all PMO (linked) is sinful, and the only M that is not sinful is that which is done in some way that mutually satisfies both husband and wife in the context of interpersonal intimacy (not skype, eg.)  I also believe that overly focusing on what is and isn't sin with this thing misses the point. I know you're feeling weak; that's why you're posting here.    I'd rather read your post about how f-ing terrified you are, or how worried you are about something, or angry, than have you asking deep questions about what the ""reset boundary"" is.   addicts obsess over lots of stuff, including ""what is"" and ""isn't"" their addiction. We're really sad that way. :-)   but love you man.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

As far as your second question,the answer is yes...but it inevitably leads to full relapse in my experience.With this disease,the only safe option is total abstinence,no sexual activity at all unless with a married partner and even then,after proper discussion,prayer  and counsel.

I can probably attribute some of my relapses to that kind of thinking. All my better sense goes out the window and suddenly my mind makes whatever fantasy world it has to in order to justify an indulgence.

NoFapChristians,39xnld,Blueaugustine,3,Mon Jun 15 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Good post, good insight. Here's what I liked/gleaned from what you shared:   I relapsed after 12 days (most of my relapses happen around the 2-week mark for some reason. Anyone else experience this?).    Yes. For about a year I was ""two week tripping"" (June 2014-Feb 2015).   It all started out when I came home late at night from my girlfriends house and I just wanted to get in bed as fast as I could.   Okay well why were you at your gf's house late in the first place? How did you feel on the way home? Why did you want to ""get in bed as fast as you could""? That's the key right there, imo.   The thing about dating is that it is preparation for marriage. But we try and steal what belongs in marriage and sneak it into dating, that's not a good idea. So our behavior in dating should respect the fact that we're waiting for marriage for certain kinds of or levels of intimacy.  If I were in your shoes, I'd be tempted to MO when I came home too because my system was so AMPED up on marriage-like feelings, experiences, and passions. Note to self: Song of Solomon, ""Do not awaken love before its time.""    It was the natural end to a series of poor decisions. Luckily, I did learn from the experience.   I agree, sort of. ""Natural"" in the sense that you can see the pattern looking back, but not ""natural"" in that you could have stopped the cycle every time.  Part of my recovery--this is what I'm learning right now, so don't take this as expert advice--is to follow routines and hang my godly living and walking with the Lord and being filled with the spirit in mundane activities that are habitual.  Lord please help me with these things.  Eg, I'm going to try and hit the bed every night this week at 10:30pm.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

You cannot separate the spiritual realm of our existence from the physical and mental.  Not being healthy in one area hurts the others.  So taking the time to simply put your dirty clothes away starts a chain reaction of good choices.    By putting your clothes away and accomplishing that tiny little task, you physically give yourself a tiny dopamine burst that you actually deserve and then get motivated to do even more healthy things.  From an emotional stand point, not leaving your clothes laying around could make you feel more mature/keep you from feeling guilty over being a slob, which would increase your self-esteem.  Often I wonder if I have a PMO problem or a problem with being uncomfortable/lazy."
NoFapChristians,3a0bui,MadameCassie,2,Tue Jun 16 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"First off thanks for being brave and sharing your struggles.  I strongly encourage you not to think of marriage as the solution to the problem.  The problem is not that you aren't married and simply don't have an outlet for those desires.  The problem actually goes deeper than that and is a matter of the heart.    If you marry, do you think it will be easier to resist temptation when you have a beautiful half-naked man lying in your bed who at that time may be unfit to satisfy your desires (due to sickness, fatigue, etc.)?    Marriage will not solve the problems that are in the heart.  A Godly man will pursue a Godly woman, and so if you want to attract a Godly man you must make it your priority to be a Godly woman.  I strongly recommend finding a church, reading the bible, and praying as a place to start.  I know it is not easy to find a church, but community is really vital to our faith.  Reading the bible can be hard to start but I think reading the Psalms is a great place to start.  It is the easiest book to find is wonderful for uplifting me out of places of hopelessness, sadness, and loneliness.    When you pray, you don't need to intercede or petition for things to change, just pour out your heart to God.  If you like any particular praise songs or bands just play a few of those songs and invite God to be with you in that time.  If you don't have any songs that come to mind I recommend Elevation Worship as in these last few months they have really ministered to me.    Finally, if you want a more detailed explanation of the things I have described above, and a targeted explanation of the real issue of lust, then I recommend a sermon from Pastor Benjamin Robinson entitled ""Life without Lust"" (number 270 in the list) that I have listened to multiple times over the last year.  As he is currently responsible for my streak I strongly advise listening to it if you have the time.  Hopefully my post makes sense and I just want to encourage you for reaching out for help."

NoFapChristians,3a0bui,LoudCommentor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:56:30 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why you aren't going to church? You can't expect godly men to be in your life, or even pursue you, if you aren't there.  My answer to your Q is that there is no time. Fighting the temptation is a daily battle, and also a life-long one. You will never be ""over"" the addiction. It will get easier, but it won't go away, as with all sin and temptations.   And even if you have passed your current trials for a certain amount of time, does not mean God will ""reward"" you with a man.  Now, if your question is, ""When should I allow myself to consider a relationship with a godly man ultimately looking to marriage"", it's only a little different. It will be a life-long struggle. Being married does not stop the temptation, though it makes it easier to bear. You should only consider escalating the relationship if it is ultimately looking towards a marriage which honours God.  I would not expect someone to pursue you at a certain time after your trials. I would not expect that once you are over the current trial, it will not come again.   However; Matthew 6:33 ""But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things would be given to you.""  Don't worry about finding a husband. Don't worry about friendships. Don't worry about anything. Instead, seek God first, and he will provide for you what is good and what is best. It may be a husband, or it may be the gift of bearing singleness. It might be a circle of friends, or it may be the gift of being able to go on overseas mission without having to leave anyone behind.  This probably wasn't the answer you were expecting, or hoping for, but you need to go to church, read your bible, and pray more. Only by that can you seek God and know him. And that's not the beginning of moving on to other worries; it's actually everything. God will provide, so don't worry. Seek God first."

Late in college all of my friends stopped attending the church I liked and started attending a church I did not like. So I didn't want to go to church alone so I just stopped going. It was bad decision because I began to lack any spiritual nourishment or investment.   Having a church body is critical and is commanded of us throughout the New Testament. It isn't an optional part of your Christian life. Being a part of the whole Christian church is necessary and we work that out through being a part of our local Christian church. Through our involvement that is where we meet our friends, find fulfillment, and possibly even a spouse. I really encourage you to get involved and I would be willing to bet a lot of the issues you have would be resolved.  Prayers, lean on the Lord!

Things like anxiety, fear, worry, doubt, despair, loneliness, and resentment.

NoFapChristians,39xkhx,HurtingFather,2,Mon Jun 15 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"I've done pretty much everything. In my experience, it doesn't really matter what you do as long as you take a multi-phasic approach.  My guess is a counselor will tell you some combination of these things below--I know because I've been to many--and recovery groups will help you stay on track with these things by hearing other men's success (and failure) stories.  Not to disparage using these, but if you go in looking for these things, it sort of doesn't matter where you find them, as long as you have them.  Back to multi-phasic (is that a word anyway?)--here are four human phases that need to be addressed:  PHYSICAL.     don't underestimate the body-soul connection. regular exercise, regular sleep habits, healthy eating habits (vegetables, protein, not too much caffiene, not too much alcohol, plenty of water)   in other words: regular self-care. make a rigorous commitment to being physically balanced and fit.   MENTAL     are you pursuing intellectually challenging things that align with what you feel called to do in the world? or are you living a safe and comfortable life under someone else's expectations?   do you have outlets for creativity if you're in a pretty narrow work environment?    do you have friendships that challenge you, and make you better?   EMOTIONAL     Are you regularly processing the stuff of your heart outloud, or at least on paper in a journal?   do you have a good relationship with your parents, siblings?   is the crud of your past affecting how you process stress and anxiety today?   are you in any so-called ""toxic"" relationships that actually drain you more than you can find Christ-like strength to serve them?   do you find yourself angry at little things? like what?   SPIRITUAL     Are you immersed in the word on a daily basis?   do you pray: regularly speak to God and take time to hear from him?   are you sharing your faith in appropriate ways with others around you?   what other sins are you needing to repent of?   do you have good fellowship with other like minded Christian men?   are you under the preaching of the word somewhere that's both encouraging, biblical, and challenging?   I'm no expert but fighting this thing for a long time that's what I've found in general I need.  Now, take that list and please pray it for me,  with hope in the Lord,  BA. edit: bullet list"

I felt compelled to reply because I can really relate with you (just a few years behind).  I am very encouraged by your honesty with this struggle, your willingness to ask for help, and your reliance on Jesus' work for your salvation.  You are not alone in this struggle!  95% men admit they struggle with lust;  The other 5% are lying!  In my experience, every male I have ever confessed also admitted that they struggled too expect 1 person.  None of this makes this any better (in fact, it might make the situation look a lot worse) but thanks be to God who chose to save us!    From here, I don't have any experience with a recovery group, though I have considered it.

A few comments:     when I put thirty days together about fifty days ago, I went hard mode: no relations or intimacy with my wife. It was very helpful in focusing my mind on the challenges we face in terms of communication. But I had to have her buy-in, first.   even without this challenge, the ""timing"" issue for marital relations with your wife will always be a matter of difficulty. This means we need to be filled up with God and God's word and not send the message to our wives that we ""need"" them so much that they are like an idol or a god to us. The one thing we ""Need"" is the Lord, not sex.   Stress and anxiety always serve in my life to distance me from the word. It is a slow ""off ramp"" from the highway of holiness onto the streets of sin (sorry for the silly consonantal metaphor, but that's what came to mind). Be careful, you might do well to inject some focus into the system, like fasting, getting away for a 1/2 day of prayer or an hour of intense devotional and journal time.   with great hope in christ,  BA."

I will note, that I've been apprehensive to use the terminology of ""addicted"" While there is a good argument for this being an accurate description, I think it has very strong implications of helplessness. As you said, we will get nowhere on our own, so, yes we are helpless without Him. But we have Him with us, He can change our hearts, He allows us to stand up under temptation. I fear that the temptation of the word ""addiction"" is for our selfishness to grab hold of those implications of helplessness and next thing you know, we're not taking responsibility for our actions.   I saw this play out in a very damaging sense in a confession to my wife early on in our marriage. I was not taking ownership, I was not asking forgivenss, I was shirking that stuff off on the idea of this ""addiction"" and how ""I couldn't help it"" In reality we need to own our sin, because He has given us the tools to combat it."

Not sharing faith doesn't mean you have to live in a home where you are silent.

Thanks so much. I do love you.""   anger over this sin/temptation. I've found that anger is not productive in fighting this. Not that I'm a buddhist, but somehow detaching my emotional response from the thing that's triggering me is important. Moving away from the temptation into more positive emotions like joy, sacrifice, service, compassion, and laughter.   persecution.

I'm not catholic myself, but hearing ba & others talk about it, I wonder if confessional would be a fitting place to find a caring ear and wise counsel. They definitely have a more approachable and confidential-feeling system than most other churches, I think I'd need to book elders time at my church.   Sex is a good thing, He made it for a reason, and with his blessing it's part of the glue that holds a marriage together. It's designed to attach people to each other, to draw them closer emotionally. Inside marriage, that's great - being glued together is the point.   But outside of marriage - imagine gluing two pieces of cardboard together, then separating them again. Then reglue to another, then separate. ""What God has brought together, let no man separate"" that's His glue holding a marriage together, don't waste your stickiness before you get there!  He's in this with you. He understands temptation, he's been there worse than you. He understands the weight of guilt and sin, he took on all you've ever done, from your whole lifetime, all at once. And mine, and everyone else on the planet. But he stood firm, and now the same Spirit who gave Him strength is in you.   Stand firm. For He who has begun a good work in you will complete it in the day of Jesus Christ."

Your first sentence kind of sums this up pretty well:   I am weak, of all the sins that can be committed, this is one that I legitimately cannot control, at all.   As far as another bit of encouragement, giving up is the one thing our Lord forbids his people to do: ""those who persevere to the end will be saved."" Every chapter in Hebrews gives a warning about quitting. You should read Hebrews today.  One more thing: Paul prayed three times for the thorn to be removed and God said ""no."" What will you do if God doesn't remove your desire to sin in this way? Are you going to give up, and turn away from God? Or are you going to give up, and recognize that He is in charge of your life and alone has the power to walk you through the fire that's burning you up?  With great hope in christ,  BA."

NoFapChristians,39ubi0,trophenius,2,Sun Jun 14 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it!  Just hang in there with me for a bit here.  Some of this may sound familiar, some may be new.  I wanna go through this step by step.   The first thing I want you to understand is that Heaven is too good for us to earn.  It can only be gifted to us.  My justification for this is the following (I have several single verses, if interested please go back and reference these for youself to see the full context): Romans 6:23      . . .the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life""     Ephesians 2:8-9     For by grace you have been saved through faith; And not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; Not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.     Its like if someone gave you a rolex watch as a gift, but you tried to give him 5$ to help pay for it.  The gift is so great that 5$ would be an insult to try to ""help pay for it"".  Similary, if we try to act as if we are earning our way to heaven by our good works, the bible descirbes our ""good works"" as mere filthy rags.  Isaiah 64:6     All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.     Making sense so far?"
NoFapChristians,39ubi0,in_the_arena,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:31:16 2015 UTC,Making sense so far?   Yes.
NoFapChristians,39ubi0,Blueaugustine,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"The reason why cannot earn our way into heaven, no matter how ""hard we try"" is because all of us our sinners, and we cannot save ourselves.  The call to perfection is clear, and the evidence of our fall even more so.  Matthew 5:48     be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect     Romans 3:23     All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God     You may want to believe that God will say ""he was good enough, but God is perfectly just, and does not do this.    SO, from here, there are 2 important things I want you to know about God.    1.)  God is perfectly just.  Exodus 34:7     God does not let the guilty go unpunished     2.) God is merciful.  He does not want to punish us, but he must. 1 John 48     God is love.     So, from this, we have a dilemma.  Perfection is required for heaven, and we cannot even come close to that.  God doesnt want to punish us (mercy) but he must (just).  Can I move on?"

NoFapChristians,39ubi0,hopefulwife,3,Sun Jun 14 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest with you...I've been going through some very similar struggles recently. I have not been keeping my thoughts and actions nearly as pure as I should. I've made some mistakes and poor decisions as well. And just like it's easy to ride that good wave when it's months long, it's easy to get stuck in a defeated mood day after day when that becomes a pattern too.  I would recommend something pretty radical to you: No matter how good you are at hiding this, how much you can fool everyone, tell someone that you have a problem. I'm like you. I kept this hidden for a long time. I was smart, a leader at work, got advanced degrees, everything looked great from the outside, but it was rotting away from the inside out. And you know the same thing that I've discovered first-hand: that rot WILL find its way out. You can't fill yourself with bad things and expect goodness to come out. That's planting apple seeds and hoping for oranges. Now I'm separated from my wife and dealing with things that never had to be...if I had only dealt with this sooner and more seriously.   Go to a recovery group of some kind. Talk to a pastor or mentor or someone like that. Bring someone, ANYONE into your journey on this. I've been in a 12-step based program for a little while now. Being able to sit around in a group and know that no matter what you share, the reaction will be encouragement and assistance is indescribable. It will be terrifying at first (not going to pretend that it's all sunshine and rainbows!). But it helps you keep your life in perspective and see what God can do in your life. Even though I'm there because of my problems, I hear things from the other guys that give me the ability to be encouraged at what God has protected me from.  One of their phrases in my group is that ""you're as sick as your secrets"". So take away the secret. It won't be easy. It will be terrifying. I had to go have a conversation with my pastor and not only tell him about this, but apologize for deceiving him about it because in a previous conversation I had the opportunity to discuss it, but avoided it. That's not a fun conversation to have, but a mature Christian man who understands sin will help you fight it.  Getting healthy works a lot like the addiction itself. The further down the road you go, the easier it gets (just like it gets easier to relapse every time you fail). Getting a decade into an addiction is not something that you get out of in a day or a week or even a year. The true test of whether or not you want to get rid of this is whether or not you're ready to ask for help from another human. Yes, ask God for help, but he works through people. He might magically fix everything, but I think that he has already given you a path forward in [James 5:16].  So what are you going to do?  That's not a rhetorical question, by the way. Write an answer to it (whether you post that here or not is not the important part, but it might help). Determine what your next step is. Will you talk to someone? Will you find and attend a support group (Celebrate Recovery is a Christian version of SAA for example)?  You can do this. Allow God to pick you up, dust you off, and guide you on your way. He's waiting for you [Luke 15:18-23]."

The big illusion is that we got to sixty, ninety, or one-twenty days and we can easily get it again. It doesn't work that way in my experience. So welcome to the reality of the struggle.  I've had to come to a place, and I can't say I'm there yet, but I'm getting there, where it is basically a zero tolerance thing.  I can't imagine stealing money from my work place. Nor can I imagine harming one of my children. Some guys probably struggle with these two items, but not me. My prayer is that I get to that point with this thing.  Which means for me it is an uphill battle. I have to work very hard at it and it is easy after sixty or ninety days to get lazy and not even realize it. The trouble is that progress by definition means you're not thinking about it every day anymore.   But guess what? Thinking about PMO was never the problem in the first place. That's why it is so subtle. You think ""success"" is avoiding PMO. Au contraire, the problem is what fuels your obsessive behavior in general. Anxiety. Frustration. Resentment. Pride. Lonlinees. Envy and Greed. Laziness and procrastination.  that stuff doesn't go away without PMO; in fact, it somehow becomes harder to deal with. Look: if you could have addressed those things without PMO by now, you would have, right?  So stop thinking you can clear out your life by clearing out PMO.   God wants your whole heart. This is deep and difficult work; not for the faint of heart.  May God grant you strength to fight with everything you've got, and when you run out of that, you've only got him. Which is how it is supposed to be anyhow.  With great hope in christ,  BA."

But I hope this insight is helpful: it isn't meant to be critical, but hopefully spirit-filled and biblical.  M527, what I don't hear you addressing in the OP is...     how Jesus is greater than your loneliness or need to be in a relationship;    how Jesus is greater than, and more satisfying, than sex with a hot girl, or    how Jesus is better and more satisfying even than hanging out and dating a girl who likes you; and   how Jesus' attention & affection is greater than the attentions or affections or praise of any other human person.   This doesn't mean you're forever ""doomed"" to singleness, that's the wrong mindset anyhow. He taught us to pray ""give us today our daily bread.""   IMO, God wants us to have the mind of someone content in any circumstances, then to add to that tranquil and peaceful lake of obedience and rest and quiet confidence, ADD TO THAT the presence of a woman who will be your soul mate.  And because of how much greater and better He is, we not only MUST NOT go down those pathways, we have power NOT TO, and to call others to follow us as we put both hands on the plow and, not looking back, start working for the kingdom.

NoFapChristians,39rq6n,trophenius,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Vimsyah, great idea. What's your plan? In my experience, I need to set a time and a place that I'm going to do these things. To kick start my scripture reading this year I downloaded a podcast (chapters a day) for my phone. I will sit down and read now more consistently but that's how I got the ball rolling.  Your post also reminds me that I don't have a set time and place for my own bible reading so I need to work on that. I definitely feel ""exposed"" when I'm not reading the word--or if I'm reading it, if I'm not feasting on it and immersed in it.  ""man does not live by bread alone...""  with great hope in christ,"
NoFapChristians,39rq6n,Blueaugustine,2,Sun Jun 14 04:04:42 2015 UTC,Right now I am thinking of sitting down and working on a reasonable new plan. Perhaps at least a few chapters a day with optional chapters in case I really have a passion to read more.

NoFapChristians,39rq6n,PMBorisStoke,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"This is my problem as well in the past.  Reading scripture is a very powerful tool, but life likes to keep us very busy.  Bible reading is going to be most effective if it's on a daily basis, but it's hard to make time.  Personally, though it'll be difficult, I've been toying with the idea of waking up an hour earlier and doing my study first thing in the morning.  I know I'd certainly benefit from it being the first thing I set my mind to in the morning, but with a pregnant wife and a one year old daughter I get little sleep as it is.  Currently trying to squeeze more time for myself after work to study has been difficult.  Writing this out, seems like I already know what I must do and have simply been too selfish to try it out.

A lust that would never be satisfied anyway; I am now in a better spot.  I was certainly heading towards a full-blown relapse, your words helped turn me around.  I eventually skimmed across an image on a social media site I ""didn't want to see"", and immediately came to my senses thinking, ""this is not the life I want to live, This is not the life I want to live.""

Edit 3:  Actually, I am going to reset my counter.  Remember, that list you gave me BA when I posted ""advice sought for singles...""?

I'm not sure if I've done so myself or is it subtly communicated from outside.  This book has shattered much of my view of Christianity. It opened up my heart to new dimensions. It is exactly what I needed now.  Though, with every shattered view, there is always that brief period of re-finding one's self. I do believe however that instead of pausing to settle into a new rut, we should always be looking out to change our world view. There is always something that we've never seen before, even though it was sitting right in front of our faces.  I can't thank you enough for your post, it came just in the right time.  So...

NoFapChristians,39o8mj,FapFreee,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:35:16 2015 UTC,"CS Lewis wrote a great piece of fiction called ""the Great Divorce"". it's about the divorce of Heaven and Hell in the human heart. And deals with the deconstruct reconstruct that you may be going through in your own theology doctrine as your relationship with Jesus grows into something more authentic, real and beautiful. That book also changed my life.  My own deconstruct reconstruct was scary but very eye opening and life giving overtime as I trusted in God and in how his story was unfolding in my life when it came to seeing the fakeness of the ""preacher man"" behind the curtain of religion like The Wizard of Oz, feverishly trying to work the levers and pedals to make himself look more holy and powerful then he actually is but in truth was just as broken and messed up as the rest of us. Doing a sexual addiction ministry will for as long as I have will show you behind the counter stuff in pastors priests and clergy that most people don't see.   These books are great because they are fiction that's true, like how Jesus used parables or metaphors in the Bible to make his point or build an emotional word picture.  Another couple of books that changed my life was The Shack and Crossroads both by Paul Young - I got a chance to interview Paul back in November. The guy is like a real modern day CS Lewis. very excellent writer and interesting Christian thinker.   ""The Shack"" is a metaphor for the human heart.  Both are fiction but very good metaphorical writing about ""where is God when?"" and issues of our secret stubborn sins. If you get a chance to Google beyond the shack you'll see the behind the scenes talks by Paul and his own issues with sexual integrity. as well as some of his motivations behind writing the shack which has now become one of the best selling books in human history.  Many more books on my book list on the website ASI247.org"
NoFapChristians,39o8mj,hubbahubba5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"In my what I call now, past life, I turned to porn for a strange reason. I thought there is nothing else in life is worth living. I thought the springs of life flowed through sexuality. Nothing else made me feel remotely alive as ""The Thrill"".  And in the midst of the darkness, I saw light. I didn't know what it was, or where it would lead me. But I just knew that this is the way to go.  It was the first book I've ever read. Mere Christianity. To say that this book changed my life is a grave understatement. I changed from someone who never reads, to 1-2 books every 3 weeks. There is a world beyond what we can see that I knew nothing about.  It is funny that the more I read, the more I feel like I haven't even started grasp 1% of this magnificent side of us. It seems to me that I can only hold so much information at the one time. My brain feels like a sieve, I keep forgetting what I've learned. I forgot who I am. I forget what I'm here for. In a way it is like our need to eat everyday.  I read somewhere that sinning, is starvation of the soul. When we cut it off the source of life, we start scrapping the bottom of the barrel. We turn our simple life pleasures into our new god. They enslave us.  It is particularly odd to me how much we need that message of love drilled into us. Even though through everything I've learned, I know the love is the essence of life. Yet, I can go through days without feeling it, thinking it or doing anything about it. You would think that it is not the kind of thing that you would normally forget about...  My own deconstruct reconstruct, showed me something very similar to your experience. I started seeing through a lot of statements that people seem to throw around non stop, thinking that they are now religious. When they stumble and fall, they are baffled! ""How could my closeness to god disappear like this"".  The term ""Holy"" has lost almost all of its meaning over the years. I now have my own definition. Holiness is directly proportional to how loving the person is. The way I see it, without love, nothing really ever matters (1 Corinthians 13:2).  In one of John Eldredge's books, he says that stories are the language of the heart. Dissecting a story to know what's behind it, is very much dissecting a cat. We can cut it into pieces, see what each bit does, but what we end up with is a dead cat, what is it good for now?  Oh dear God, look at the size of that reply. I guess I get carried away sometimes. I don't get to share these experiences very often.  I will start The Shack today, many thanks for your recommendation."

NoFapChristians,39phmt,Blueaugustine,2,Sun Jun 14 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"Something that has been helping me lately is I realized that while I was praying for God to take this desire from me, the desire to PMO, I never really believed He actually would. I had no faith. Knowing that God CAN do something and knowing He WILL do something are very different. I figured out that He promises to give us the strength we need, and He promises to renew our minds. I was asking for the strength and renewal, but walking away from it due to my lack of faith and trying to rely on my own strength (which always fails). Now I KNOW God has helped me, and He renews my mind every day, and He gives me the strength to overcome the constant temptation. I think about His promise to lift me up and sanctify me every time I feel the pull of temptation and it immediately recedes. It always returns because our enemy is nothing if not persistent, but I KNOW that God is with me every time. I really hope this helps you, brother. I know that you feel like a failure, and that you aren't trying hard enough because I've been there hundreds of times. God loves you. LOVES you. Do you get it? You are His child, and a good Father protects His children and gives them good gifts. And the great thing about all of this is that He does this WHILE WE ARE STILL SINNERS! Nothing can remove you from the love of God. Be strong and courageous brother. Keep getting up, keep fighting, don't give up, because God isn't giving up on you. Stay sane my friend."

(not sure what ""foyer"" is in German, but hopefully you get the point: if you hang out there, its only a matter of time before you go all the way in.)  Solution: radically facing and addressing the things in your heart that are leading you to obsess over girls (and whatever else you're obsessing over).   Ask yourself: is Jesus enough, or do you need Jesus + something else to be happy?  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

NoFapChristians,39otvq,e1ijah1910,3,Sat Jun 13 09:07:34 2015 UTC,"Staying up extremely late is a bad habit that often leads to relapse. The bible often contrasts righteousness and sin symbolically using darkness and light, but I think that symbolism holds true because we all know it's literally true as well.    Ephesians 5:8b-12 ""Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.""    1 John 1:6 ""If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.""    Galatians 5:16-17 ""But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.""    I don't say these things to discourage you, but because I want the weight of God's grace the the glory of Christ's redemption to be a motivation to live in the freedom that Jesus died to give you."
NoFapChristians,39otvq,1peter317,2,Sat Jun 13 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"Good words, esp. about staying up late. Hang around the buffet table you'll eventually get hungry and grab a biscuit, right?  With hope in the Lord.  BA."
NoFapChristians,39otvq,Blueaugustine,2,Sat Jun 13 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for these, I especially like Galatians and 1 John.  And I often work a later shift into the evening, but I think my new strategy will be a quick shower, prayer, and then sleep, to try and minimize my time."
NoFapChristians,39otvq,jmorin17,2,Sat Jun 13 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Here's a list I put together, hope you find these helpful :)  Christian  1.) Read the Bible every day. Don’t feel pressured to read for long stretches of time or read many passages in one sitting. Even if it’s just 1 chapter a day for 5 minutes. It’s better than nothing. Remember start small and grow bigger.  2.) If you are a young person. Make it a priority to read the Book of Proverbs in the Bible at least once a year. The book is Proverbs is unique in that it’s teachings/advice is geared more towards young people. The style of writing is also pretty straight forward and easy to read/understand in comparison to other books of the bible. Pray over the verses you feel convicted on and that you are not living up to.  3.) Worship is important. If you don’t have one, buy a hymnbook. Sing at least 1 song a day. There is a saying that “when the praise goes up, the blessings come down”. This is crucial. Not only that but you get better at singing.  4.) Prayer. This NEEDS to be done daily. You need to maintain that connection with the Father. Even when it feels all it lost. Even when you feel like no one is listening and you are speaking to a wall. You need to push through.  5.) Memorization of Biblical verses. This is also very important when it comes to refuting the lies the Devil tries to demoralize us. While it is important to learn a broad spectrum of biblical verses, it may help more to initially seek out verses that speak to the particular situation you are going through.  6.) Meditation. As with everything else, don’t feel pressured into having to do this for long stretches of time. Even if its just 5 minutes a day, again it’s better than nothing. It’s a start. And when you feel comfortable with/called to, you can increase the duration. Be sure to not confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation of Eastern Religions. Some Christians who do not know much about the subject tend to confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation. However, there is a significant difference. Mindful meditation is simply focusing on one’s breath in a comfortable position with no association with deities.  7.) Go to Church every Sunday. It’s necessary to maintain that social connection. In many cases, a lack of social interaction can manifest itself in negative ways, leading to us taking on negative outlets (addiction) to meet that need. And so we try to compensate for a lack of social interaction by acting out in bad ways. Also be sure to sing the songs. Do not remain silent as many do. Remember when the praises go up, the blessings come down. Be sure to pay attention to the sermon; who knows you may learn something that really speaks to your situation.  8.) If you are a young person, join your Church’s youth group. It can be a great place to make good friends and learn what it means to live out a Christian life.  9.) You need to fast. In Christianity, this is not an option. It is needed. Some people describe fasting as a means to accelerate the healing process, or receive answers more quickly. Others describe it as the metaphorical “grenade” in a Christian’s weapon arsenal. To be used when it feels like one is in stalemate with the enemy and is not gaining ground, or perhaps very little at a high cost.  10.) Confessing to someone. This can seem quite frightening at first, especially if you have been hiding certain unsavory behaviours. But this is a necessary part of the healing process. It helps relieve one of heavy burdens as you are no longer keeping secrets. It also frees up that energy you put towards hiding the addiction, which you can use to actually fight it.  If you feel convicted to confess to a certain someone, then that is likely the Holy Spirit convicting you. Be sure not to make the mistake of minimizing the situation. As in, make sure you mention the fact that you have an “addiction”. And that what you are speaking of was not merely a onetime occurrence that you are feeling guilty of. This can save you a lot of trouble and heartache in the future. And help others to take you seriously.  Practical Things  11.) Exercise/Working out. You need a mixture of both cardio and weight training to deal with urges and lead a healthy life.  12.) Install an Internet Filter. K9 is effective for use on computers. OpenDNS is effective for use of both phones and computers (this one, however, is installed on your router). Both are free. Get someone else to put in the password and use their email address for the password recovery option so that the software is not easy to bypass. Some other people use Covenant Eyes software for accountability. That, however, is not free currently with a monthly fee.  13.) Find good self help books on the subject and about life in general and read them. (ex. Wild at Heart by John Elredge, 10 Lies Men Believe about Porn by Stephen Kuhn, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren)  14.) Join an online help community. Reddit has many subreddits tailored to many issues (GetMotivated, GetDisciplined, Pornfree, NoFapChristians, etc). It can be helpful sometimes to get encouragement/advice from others who understand what you are going through. You may also learn to look at your situation from a different perspective or even receive guidance on things you didn’t even know you were doing wrong.  15.) Clean up your living space. Organize yourself. A messy, unorganized environment can contribute to a disordered mind.  16.) Cut down on your technology usage. Whether on the computer, television, phone, cellphone, internet, whatever. This doesn’t mean getting rid of all technology. We live in a technological age. While it’s important to not let technology rule our lives, that doesn’t mean we need to escape from it and live as hermits. Analyze your technological routine. What devices you use. What sites you frequent. And ask yourself honestly whether you really need to do those things.  17.) Cold Showers can help a lot in the moment. Some choose to exclusively do these. But others prefer to do them sparingly when they find themselves in the heat of the moment. Find what works better for you.  18.) Take a walk outside everyday for at least 5 minutes. Not the kind you do on the treadmill. The kind that actually gets you somewhere. This can be an effective way of clearing the mind. When you take your walk, be sure to walk at a relaxed pace. There is no need to rush, otherwise you lose some of the benefits.  19.) Positive Affirmations. There are many ways to utilize these. You can either read and/or write them daily. Another way of utilizing these is recording yourself speaking these affirmations to yourself, and then listening to the recording daily. Some people record themselves speaking over music.  20.) Getting enough sleep is very important in preventing stress and increasing willpower. It’s understandable that not everyone can always get adequate sleep. Students and people with certain careers cannot sometimes meet these requirements. However, if it is in your power and ability to get adequate sleep, than do so. Also avoid staying up late after others in your household have gone to bed to reduce temptation to sin.  21.) Use an online website or app like chains.cc to keep track of which days you are successful and which days you fail. Doing so can sometimes reveal patterns.  22.) Look the part. You may have heard of studies that say the more you smile, the happier you feel (and not just the other way around). This is true and not only applies to smiling. If you are a man, shave and keep a clean look. Get a Haircut. Stand tall and not slouched over."
NoFapChristians,39otvq,Blueaugustine,2,Sat Jun 13 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this! I feel like I should make it a checklist and try implementing these things into my life.  I am glad, at the very least, to have all of these ideas down in one place.  Edit: Also do you have an christian resources for learning about fasting and meditating? I have fasted during various strenuous parts of my life and have always felt like it helps me with whatever is at hand, but knowing more would be a huge help for both, thank you so much."

I don't feel quite the same negative effects as I once did either like brain fog and emotional turmoil. I can focus a lot better these days as well.

NoFapChristians,39l31j,insekticide,8,Fri Jun 12 14:06:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I'm the wife of an addict.   It's interesting that she handled it once, but you've deemed that she cannot handle it again. Personally, that shows a lack of faith in your wife and more importantly, a lack of faith in God to take care of your wife.   Are you saying that she would leave you? Because to be honest that is not your call to make, to hide something so that she would not leave you is incredibly deceitful and highly selfish. The choice should be hers, not yours.   Now, if it would drive her mentally insane, then maybe that is an appropriate call, but otherwise the ""she can't handle it"" is usually just a veneer for protecting your pride.   I know its hard to confess again. I personally don't want to ever hear a confession from my husband again. But I also know I have a good God who loves us both and that He will take care of us no matter what. So as long as my husband continues to be repentant and growing in the Lord, then I will continue to stand by my husband and you should give your wife the chance to do the same. Don't hold your marriage back any longer.   There are resources out there to help her- one I really like is journeytohealingandjoy.com"
NoFapChristians,39l31j,hopefulwife,5,Fri Jun 12 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"thank you for your reply. i think it is amazing to hear the voice of a wife of an addict. i know in my heart confession is the right thing to do, yet i don't feel that i currently have the spiritual grounding to do so. i agree that it is mostly a pride thing. i struggle with showing maturity and wisdom and be a spiritual lead in the family. confessing this now is just another thing that would tear us apart, at least i feel so now. your point of me having a lack of faith in her is true. i agree. and it is unfair. but so is the problem we talk about here. i am mindful of everything you said and sure enough i will get there someday. for now, i will keep my eye on this thread and hope more answeres like this will knock me out this darkness i am in. thank you."
NoFapChristians,39l31j,hopefulwife,4,Fri Jun 12 18:36:30 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that confessing this is your first step in becoming a spiritual leader? You can't be one  in your marriage with unconfessed sin.   Fact is, you won't move forward in maturity, wisdom or spiritual leadership until this is out in the open. Any other married man here will tell you that and my husband will heartily agree. He is far more of a leader now than he was before, and it all began with his confession."
NoFapChristians,39l31j,HurtingFather,3,Fri Jun 12 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  I was a much ... weaker man before taking this one by the horns.  Its only been a month, but its been a month of growth and maturing with my walk with God."
NoFapChristians,39l31j,hopefulwife,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:48:38 2015 UTC,how did you go about telling your wife? this weekend has been killing me inside but I know that I have to create an environment of healing for both of us before hitting her with the news. I cannot just drop this on her as we are now. We are currently looking into a church and don't have a pastor we can talk to either. Having moved a long way from both of our homes we also don't have any close people here either.
NoFapChristians,39l31j,hopefulwife,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:33:09 2015 UTC,"I have considered it and I know it would be. The issue I am facing with this is that I want us to both have an environment of healing. I cannot run her over with this news and then tell her to find help. I know that the way I see the issue and how I feel about it will be nothing compared to what she will feel about it. I know that she will need a person that she trust to talk to about this, and we can only find this in a church. Sadly all the people we knew or know aren't those kind of people and we are looking into finding a church at the moment so we also don't have a pastor to talk to about. But to be honest this weekend was killing me inside. Though I know I found forgiveness in Jesus I know that before I open up to her I cannot fully recover from this shame and move towards healing and maturity. Yet this step is the hardest and for once in my life I need to make sure I do this right. Any thoughts? And to reply to your question from the former post, I feel that both would happen, it would drive her insane and brake her view of everything we have built so far and she would leave me. But you are also right that none of this is my call to make and that I should let the Lord take care of her. It's terrifying."
NoFapChristians,39l31j,new_life55,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"You say, ""it's going to break her view"" the things is- things are already broken. I'm sorry to say this, but she will have to create her own environment of healing. This is something she works through as you work through your own recovery. Only God can really heal her. The best thing you can do is be actively working on your recovery, be honest, and start earning her trust back again. Then stay honest. Create check-ins so something like this doesn't happen again.   I wrote this: bit.ly/letterforchristianwomen, a lot of men have found it helpful to send to their wives. At the time we had just moved, I literally had no friends and we had only just found a church. God provided for us, and he will certainly provide for you. There are probably counselors around you and if not, journeytohealingandjoy.com is a great option. My husband and I also worked through a few books together which was helpful.   It is terrifying. Pray hard about it, but don't delay any longer than you absolutely have to."

(though I wouldn't be surprised if there are biblical references to support it)"
NoFapChristians,39l31j,hubbahubba5,2,Fri Jun 12 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"James 5:16     Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.     Confession to others does not earn salvation, (Salvation is confession, repentance, faith to God), but honesty is certainly fruit of the spirit.  Its so hard though.  So hard.  I'm not married, but every time I knew I needed to tell pastor/church for a position in minister, it is so hard.  It broke me down to bring myself to do it, but it was certainly the holy spirit convicting me.  Its a lot easier to ignore it all.  A lot easier to lie even.  But, trust me, living in the dark with shame your whole life is the worse it gets.  The truth will set you free.  Telling her will be the toughest day, then recovery comes, and every day gets better from then on.  I am not married, so I'm sure others will have practical advice here to give, but I can tell you that getting over that hump that is our pride is the toughest part, and then things get better.    Remember, though, that in Christ you are free! you say your relationship with God is #1, so then don't worry about ""not being good enough"".  None of us are good, enough, thats why God sent his Son to die for us.  John 8:31-36     To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. 32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?” Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. 35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."

NoFapChristians,39l31j,PMBorisStoke,4,Fri Jun 12 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"You are not alone in your struggle. I have been married for almost 16 years and have 3 girls. Porn had unfortunately been a part of my entire relationship with my wife. I too was petrified to tell her because I didn't want to hurt her. But I have come to realize that i was hurting her more in NOT telling her because our relationship could never move forward without my confession . Proverbs 28:13 says, ""Whoever conceals their sin does not prosper, but the one who confesses them and renounces them finds mercy."" Confessing to my wife was the absolute hardest thing I have ever had to do in my whole life. My wife was very hurt and I lost all the trust she had in me. We have a long road ahead of us. By God's grace my wife forgave me and we are working on healing our marriage. I am also focusing on being in a right relationship with God. Porn also pushed him out of my life.  You being here is an important first step. This journey will not be easy but IT WILL BE WORTH IT. Its going to take time. Porn screws up your brain like you wouldn't believe and it will also need time to recover or ""reboot."" With God's help you will come out on the other side of this a better man.  There are many people who would love to support you without judging. Lots of us have been or are where you are. You don't need to feel alone. There are lots of articles and books to read as well, including ones for your wife. The most powerful book I read was called ""Finally Free"" by Heath Lambert.

Marriage is, after all, a gift from God and a healthy  marriage relationship is for His glory. He wants your marriage to be about Him and sometimes has to take radical and painful steps to do that."

There are many others who have a spouse, children, looked at weird shit, not in a great church, etc. So you are certainly not alone in that regards.  I think its also a problem that women in this modern age need to understand, that porn is just something that the vast majority of men have to deal with, and just because they struggle with it doesn't mean that they don't love you. Its kind of in our nature as men. Doesn't make it right. But its in our nature, and not something that you can usually just do away with at the snap of a finger.  And so even though I am not married, I have plenty of experience with hiding things. So I can understand how the disconnect between spouses would make recovery a lot more difficult."

NoFapChristians,39l31j,Thatguy32101,2,Tue Jun 16 12:21:25 2015 UTC,"Hey brothers.  I'm a few years older than the both of you but newly married (neaerly five years now).  We have no children and the problem is I met and fell in love with my wife while having DE (delayed ejaculation, or retarded ejaculation).  So I've never had an orgasm wth my spouse.  My DE turned into PIED (porn induced eryctile disfunction).  I turned to masturbation when I was six and I've been doing it for many years.  Internet porn became an issue only within the last ten years.  My deathgrip syndrome was bad (meaning I had increased sexual stamina) and my friend the weird stuff I've masterbated to on the internet if I ever had to describe it would shame me to the core.    I think my condition became worse because my wife become very non-sexual after we were married.  I think a lot of it has to do with the idea that she probably felt that she could please me.  So I want to encourage you both...I worry about children all the time and sometimes I feel like I'll never be able to be intimate with my wife.  You two have children and I assume have normal sex in spirte of your addictions.  Focus on that.  The idea that you're sharing is helpful because I think Satan prays on us in secret places...in the dark but you've exposed that darkness to light by sharing. Good!!!  Your wife is your partner so eventually share with her, unless you feel it will cause her pain, but honestly it is helpful to share things with your wife.  She's your flesh now.  It is awkward and she won't be happy but if she knows then she can help you, you guys fight together, if she doesn't then sneaky things like annoyance and resentment can come in.  Just like PMBorisStoke you can PM me as well.    Thanks for sharing."
NoFapChristians,39l31j,Blueaugustine,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:17:23 2015 UTC,sex was never an issue. we need to find time now with all the responsabilities that come with the child but we do. and it feels so fulfilling too. i know this is how God ment it to be. but i guess thats just what addictions do :(  it's horrifying if i sit here and see who i've become. i am all messed up now. but this is what i wanted. to talk about it. thank you for your time. perhaps i will PM some of you but for now i want to keep this public. i feel a releaf in a way i haven't till now and i hope this will inspire others. why else do we go through trials then?! Thank you
NoFapChristians,39l31j,Blueaugustine,2,Fri Jun 12 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"This is helpful to me, because sex is an issue or has been in my marriage and I always imagine that I wouldn't have my addiction if she (my wife) would just do her part and stop denying me.  That isn't true as your story tells me.  I think it's like medicine.  If the doctor told you to take a pill three times a day to cure your ills you would right?  Why can't we do the same thing with prayer?  lol.    Let's keep talking publically I think it is helpful."

You don't just ""try harder"" because there will be circumstances that are stronger than you, that can break you.  But being in the presence of His spirit?  The bad times will still come, but they cannot break you, because its not your power, or your might, but His spirit getting you through that time.  Practically speaking?

I did repent of that, and didn't act on anything, but it was definitely the sin of lust and a failed attempt at ""flirting.""  I thought about resetting for that, but don't think I should.

You said it yourself right there, there's pain in recovery. Our body doesn't want to change; but we can't ""have two masters"" and please both it and God.  I'm not sure, since your comment I've been thinking about it, but it could've been some things. For one, I hadn't gone to Confession for a while since I was doing so well, which could have something to do with it… with that, I'm currently at odds about how Confession works, and whether it makes sense with my 'core beliefs' if you will…  But also, I had kind of slipped a bit in my daily readings, tending not to read the pretty lengthy old testament bit at the end of each day in the reading plan, and instead doing whatever else… Or just in general playing games or going on youtube instead of reading the bible... That seems more likely the reason."

I am taking it for granted that these things are good for you in and of themselves. I just want to draw your attention that a key aspect to killing this addiction is the frame of mind that is telling you some version of: ""lets not bother with that today""... the part of the mind where this comes from is the EXACT part where the ""let's just rub one out"" idea comes from. It is important to stand in defiance of that mind set on several fronts. And as soon as you recognize it: ""let's skip the full readings today"" you not only sit up straight and do them anyway, but you also go into: ""oh shit I am at PMO risk today"" and start redoubling your self fulfilling disciplines as well as doing several safety behaviors... if you don't have a list of each you need to get to work on that.

What you've written is HARD CORE awesome, and super insightful. Praise God he's given you this sense of things, and its gnawing away at your brain and heart, that's the Holy spirit at work.  Esp. the piece about core beliefs; when we're at odds there, everything is out of whack, know what I mean?  Im a protestant so I can't help you with the Confession part, but to say that even for proddys we recognize that confession to clergy is not wrong per se; we just don't like it to be limited to clergy.   [Galatians 6:1-2]  Meanwhile, the ""playing games"" or ""going on you tube"" for me--that stuff springs out of a sense of ennui or malaise or just even some discouragement about what I'm doing in life and where I'm at at this stage of my life. Not that those things are wrong per se, they aren't, but shoot: what are we thinking, frittering away our time on those black holes of time suck?

NoFapChristians,39g33t,tuxedoburrito,9,Thu Jun 11 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"This may not be the best place for this conversation, but I would like to address your question.  The first thing that came to mind with that phrase, ""help my unbelief"" is the book by Barnabas Piper called Help my Unbelief (comes out July 1st).  I believe your question is a legitimate one.  The answer, though (at least the short answer) is pretty simple.  God chose to allow free will in the world.  God is only good, and allowed free will (my guess is because if he made us to be robots that only could choose good, then we would not really be living in a sense).  Humanity, though, rejected God, and it is our rebellion and sin that is the root problem of death, rape, murder, and abuse.  It all comes out of the heart of man, that chose sin over God.  God hates sin.  He is so completely separate from sin.  See in the old testament how God is a just judge.  The murder, sexual immorality, abuse, greed, etc.. that bring about those things you mentioned is what humanity chose, and God must punish evil.  There are many examples of this in the old testament.  The story does not end here though!  God is also merciful (praise God) and wants to not only save sinners from punishments, but change them and use them for his glory in acts of love!  In ending the physical and spiritual slavery that humanity finds itself in.  I would love to talk more if you are interested."
NoFapChristians,39g33t,new_life55,2,Thu Jun 11 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"God's is not the writer of some great cosmic act.  Or at least not in the way a lot of us may think.  Yes he's Creator, and we are his creation, but that's much more nuanced than an Author and his characters.  Characters don't have a free will, they and the events around them are meticulously planned out.  Characters and their story are entertainment, that is not the story the scriptures tell.  The story the Bible tells is not one of God's will.  Much of what goes on in our broken world is against his will.  And that's why God's kingdom needed to come through Jesus.  ""You're Kingdom come, your Will be done.""  Evil prevails in this world, and it's being wiped out through God's coming Kingdom, which we pray & fight for.  We are the agents of this Kingdom, and we do not blame God as if he is in control of the evil things that happen.  ""God's in control"" is not to be found in the scriptures, at least not in the many of us use it.  Evil comes from our own hearts, and Satan/Evil One is the one the scriptures point to as the one who wills evil into this world, and often people like me and you are his agents instead of God's.  Read Jesus in John 7, I think this is a huge implication of what he says.  God bless you.  I have been graced not to have struggled with this, but I realize this is a sticking point for many people, brothers/sisters and those who do not believe, but I think the scriptures are crystal clear that the evil in this world is not God's will."
NoFapChristians,39g33t,Kraahkan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"One way to look at this question is through Christ's last words.  Mark tells us that he asked, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" (15:34).  Luke tells us that he said, ""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit"" (23:46).  One of the greatest challenges, but indeed one of the most beautiful parts of our faith is to reconcile these two sentiments, to be uncertain about the reason for suffering at times, but to lay oneself down for others and dedicate oneself to God nonetheless."

NoFapChristians,39iv6v,lyricall,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"I know you're frustrated. But have you considered that the real problem is not the ""relapse"" (PMO) but the ""anxiety before the relapse""? The blockers and filters are meant to deter and give you space to make a different decision, not to be fool-proof iron clad defenses. I have found that if I don't address the anxiety, I'm helpless.  How do I address anxiety? Confession. Scripture. Prayer. Fasting. Radical amputation. Figuring out who I'm called to be and being that man.  Keep the faith, keep up the fight, dude.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."
NoFapChristians,39iv6v,Blueaugustine,2,Fri Jun 12 09:34:39 2015 UTC,"You're right. The anxiety is almost ineffable.  In the seconds or one minute before the relapse, nothing else in life matters. I cannot clearly think about getting to sleep early, ending the streak, et cetera. Only the images of pornography actors and actresses, being alone in a room with the laptop...ie my sexual immoral thought-life, being alone, access to porn pushes reality out my mind and view. After the relapse, reality sets in, the anxiety is gone, and I'm left wondering what just happened? Perhaps the question is how can we stay in touch with reality through out the day, especially the times when we are prone to fall. I'm not sure spiritual reality is practical enough. Natural reality is very jolting. I was mourning while watching the eulogy of the pastor that was gunned down in S. Carolina and in the moment I wanted to search for porn b/c my streak just ended and I felt no reason why not to cave. But I did not want porn to be the last image before I went to sleep, so went to sleep immediately. Right now I think I'm still more impressed by the reality of S. Carolina than the fantasy of porn that I missed out on yesterday."

You're right: ""spiritual reality"" is not practical enough. How can you say you love God (whom you cannot see) if you do not love your brother (whom you can see)? is St. John's question.  My paraphrase for no PMO is: How can you claim to love God (who is invisible) if you don't engage with your brothers and sisters in the body of Christ, engage in his word, confess your sins with your mouth to another human being who looks you in the eye and says ""Jesus loves you more."" How can you?  I can't. Even better: I won't. I refuse to settle for such a thin religion. If that's all its about, why would Jesus have to bodily rise from the dead?  He's alive and at the father's right hand. Let's get busy. Dive in, boys.  with great hope in Christ,  Ba."

NoFapChristians,39iv6v,Blueaugustine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:17:37 2015 UTC,"One more thing about the anxiety. It's eerily scary that the same anxiety I feel before caving in and looking for porn is similar to butterflies I used to feel (and sometimes do) right before talking to a woman in real life, especially one that I feel attracted to. In the midst of this enslavement to porn, sadly I don't think my brain or mind can clearly distinguish between my experience with porn and that of a real woman. The anxiety for both are almost identical at this point.  Worst yet, I said that I sometimes do feel butterflies for women in real life, but the truth is I rarely, if ever, feel it for them. That anxiety that would compel me to talk to them and engage them is rarely, if ever, there. I find them attractive physically and personally, yet there is no compelling anxiety to get to know them. Yet the anxiety that compels me to search for porn is always there before I cave and there before I triumph over the temptation. It's so easy for me to ignore real women because there is no anxiety that compels me to recognize them, but it is never easy for me to ignore the presence of porn. So right now I realize how twisted my mind is because I've allowed my mind to twist reality. In a world without sin, except pornography, I would easily ignore the presence of porn and find irresistible to engage a female that I'm attracted to. It really is scary now that I think about it. I would like to think that this realization would make a dramatic impact in my life and my fight against internet pornography.

NoFapChristians,39insb,loveofducks,3,Thu Jun 11 23:55:25 2015 UTC,"I am not a bible fan as I cannot digest much information and I am not keen on reading pages of just words.     I think if you could find a bible study group then that would be really helpful, because you can go through it together!  But I think the problem here may be a bit deeper (could be wrong though).    If I may, the Bible is the inspired Word of God! It contains so much wisdom and knowledge, insight and help.  It contains the answer to your very question here!  If you are a child of God, who has repented of sin and has placed your faith in the work of Jesus for your salvation, then you have a specific role in your local church to fill!  Romans 12:3-13 says:     For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. 4 For as in one body we have many members,[a] and the members do not all have the same function, 5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. 6 Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; 7 if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; 8 the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads,[b] with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness. 9 Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. 10 Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. 11 Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit,[c] serve the Lord. 12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. 13 Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.     Joining a community of believers and using whatever gifts God has given you is what God calls us to do!  It is when I am using my talents for the church that I feel closest to God;  Specifically, when I am serving those who do not of the grace of God!  The Bible tells us all this, I would feel so confused about my role and who I am in Christ if it wasn't for the bible!  You don't have to write a research paper on parallelisms in Moses in Jesus or anything, just sit down, get excited, read a small passage, relate to it, and pray about. lemme know what you think..."
NoFapChristians,39insb,new_life55,3,Fri Jun 12 00:51:57 2015 UTC,"You need to find a time to participate in worship with your fellow Christians. This is necessary.  You also need to read the bible, even if it's just one chapter a day, and meditate on and pray about what you read."
NoFapChristians,39insb,jad_seven,2,Fri Jun 12 00:14:39 2015 UTC,You might try the YouVersion bible - it has bible plans that are in easy chunks.   Also try different versions! I love the New Living Testament and The Message. Much easier reads than other versions.

Honestly, and I know it's not the answer you want to hear, but you need to change your life so you can read the bible and attend church.  I'm not telling you to just suddenly quit your job (we all know how rough the job market is right now) but working towards changing it, towards getting a day position, towards not working on the weekends.... that'll help.  And a bible study group in the mean time is the perfect recommendation I see a couple others have suggested.  What you need is practice.  Reading the bible might seem daunting now but the more you keep at it then the easier it will become.  And pray!  Don't underestimate the power of prayer.  I'd suggest really throwing yourself into it and being very specific with everything you talk about with God.  He already knows your heart so this might seem unecessary, but it will help you get in the practice of constant prayer and it will really help you get more out of it."

NoFapChristians,39e328,loveofducks,16,Thu Jun 11 03:13:43 2015 UTC,"great post, great question.  My two cents is that you will mean it when you love him more. What's keeping you from loving him more?  Sin kills passion and joy. So you've got to stop in order to start. Kind of like a catch 22.  Then there's the whole lag time factor. The sense of delight and joy and freedom in Christ often lags significantly behind the commitment to obey God. Its not a quid pro quo kind of transaction, in other words.  You do it because its right. He blesses in His time and in His way for His own purposes and ends.  I hope this helps you; it helps me to remember these basic truths, knowing that no matter what my feelings don't affect His character.  With great hope in Christ,"
NoFapChristians,39e328,Blueaugustine,3,Thu Jun 11 03:33:45 2015 UTC,"I know I've had times like this.

Try praying to God that He will cause you to feel sorrow because of your sin; not guilt, but true sorrow that will lead to repentance (not just confessing your sin, but also turning away from it).  God bless."
NoFapChristians,39e328,Aphee89,2,Thu Jun 11 06:09:13 2015 UTC,"Just to chip in, I'm reminded of Psalm 51 and the psalmist' desperation for God. He's desperate for God to blot out his mistakes so that He can have His Spirit and to help others. I like to put myself in this psalm and 'mean' what I say. As we experience more of God, we want more to stay pure for His sake and the sake of others. Hope that helps..."

NoFapChristians,39e328,deeschannayell,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:03:29 2015 UTC,"We feel sorry when we've hurt someone. If we didn't hurt anyone, why should we feel sorry.  There was a time when I thought there was nothing wrong with fapping. I didn't feel the least bit sorry about what I did. I thought it was natural and everyone is doing it.  I believe that God couldn't care any less about about what you are saying. He cares about what's in your heart. If you don't feel sorry, what is the point of saying it a thousand times?  Repentance, in it's basic definition, means changing of mind. Our brains, don't see everything for what they are. Things are filtered through your own world view. Sometimes we only have partial understanding of some matters. Sometimes we are completely oblivious to concrete facts.  Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2, NIV)"

Right now, I'm able to use my laptop because FOR ME I've identified the ways in which I stumble with it. and have plugged that ""leak"" in the boat, so to speak, with a filter that sends a report to my friend.

And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. 3 Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 4 perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us."

It can be a difficult text to read, because it says so much of the incredible freedom the believer enjoys, which tend to (at least for me) make me compare my own life with that described in Romans. That often makes me doubt what's written there.   My conclusion so far is that Romans acutally describe the truth for a believer WHEN that believer remains in Jesus and constantly have her eyes fixed on Jesus and his works. As soon as the believer start to put more focus on herself and her own works she is, in her spirit, walking in a direction that's leading away from that wonderful spiritual reality which is described in the letter.

NoFapChristians,395khw,Duck73113,7,Tue Jun 9 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"Before anyone else gets the chance to say this, I want to tell you something in absolute love: It doesn't matter what you think about these women and their standards for beach dress bro. Put it another way, woman will ALWAYS want to look as beautiful and attractive as possible, Christian or not(which is something else to take into perspective here). Look, the revealing way you saw them dressed? Guess what, in another ten years, those ""pieces of cloth"" could become even smaller. ""Ok, so what?"" you ask. Well, your charge as a man, as a pure being, and as a Christian, wholly devoted to a DISCIPLINED lifestyle, is to look away always! Yes, you're going to catch a glimpse every now and then; our eyes were made to perceive after all. But you do understand that the sin isn't in the second, third, and fourth look right? No sir, its from your heart. Jesus said that any man who even looks lustfully at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart. That all taken into account, I'll summarize like this: A womans way of dressing is not your responsibility. Women in todays secular(or otherwise) society are at some point going to have something revealing on that will catch your eye - that's the point of it, if not for them to be able to feel beautiful. Your responsibility is to your heart, which God justly judges your character against.   What I do in these situations is avert, avert, avert the eyes. Men in a weak positions such as us, MUST be vigilant in these situations. You couldn't help being where you were because of your son; totally understandable. But you also CAN'T help how small the bikinis are either! What can you help? Your covenant with your eyes. Look away, pray, and if you can, move elsewhere. That struggle in our lives is not going away anytime soon...  EDIT: Please forgive my lack of spell check, haha!"

I guess I just struggle with the typical response I hear on these situations: There is nothing you can do to change the problem.  Isn't there though?  What if it's my wife or daughter leading many men's minds off the path?  What's the bible say about that?  Should I submit to societal standards?  And doesn't my brother a responsibility to inform me of that which I might be blind to, namely the provocative nature of those in my charge?  Or will the problem just fix itself if we ignore it long enough?"
NoFapChristians,395khw,challengeimust,3,Tue Jun 9 18:22:07 2015 UTC,"I completely understand, challenge. Its absolutely NOT wrong to look away either; that's what we SHOULD do. What I was saying there was simply that at some point you will acknowledge such women, in the sense that by nature of having eyes, this is just how it is; your response however, is what must please God.   As far as your own daughters or wife? I 100% agree there too. My wife is pregnant with our first child. If it is a girl,  I will be scrutinizing her dress and appearance her entire at home life(not overbearingly of course,lol)! I'll be darned if my own flesh and blood is going to unintentionally(or otherwise) cause other - subjectively - weaker men struggles! But here's the thing bro, you and I are two men who agree that their daughters should biblically be modest within reason. It's SO intimidating to think that Gods way of moral living will be challenged with earthly, lawful feminist perspective, and the dangers of a potentially sexist opinion... I mean, I'm gonna run my house how God wants me to, but this matter would have to be taken seriously by A LOT of people in order to make a difference, and not be seen as oppression (just my opinion).  Look, my statement is coming from a place that may seem uneducated, and maybe it is, but it almost does seem an impossible task...That's why I leave it like this: Maintain your eyes, maintain your house, and I guess hope(and pray) for the best,lol  EDIT: I apologize if I offend any of our female partners here in Nofap.

That's the difference between a Christ centered worldview that is rooted in grace, faithfulness and love versus a worldview that's rooted in law and ""other people not making me sin"". We are not Muslims, the heartless reaction to temptations? That is the sin of Shariah law to expect that these women should wear burkas or something like that.  There's a battle going on between our own flesh and our own spirit, sin is not ""out there."" it lives in our Earthsuit (our flesh) like bad malware that was downloaded by the lies and messages we received from the culture at large. But as Christ followers we have a new worldview the old has gone and the new lives in us. It's not a sin to be tempted it's how we react to the temptations of everyday life that we will define our personal freedom and independence.  Galatians 5:16-18 (ESV) 16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.  From the film ""The Matrix"" Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. [Neo's eyes suddenly wander towards a woman in a red dress] Morpheus: Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress? Neo: I was...

I think the solution to the problem is to teach our young men and women the value and importance of their sexuality and when sharing their sexuality is and is not appropriate. Part of that is to teach young women about appropriate dress and another part of it is to teach young men about respecting women regardless of dress.

Part of that is to teach young women about appropriate dress and another part of it is to teach young men about respecting women regardless of dress. I'm not letting anyone off the hook or advocating victim mentality but it is about teaching individual responsibility.   I agree.  So, what's appropriate?   So while I believe you can advocate for modesty that's only a band-aid solution to the bigger problem.   If you mean sin, sure.  If you mean respect--well, I have little reason to respect a porn star unless I believe her to be the creation of a very respectable God."

The way to righteousness is to look away, from anything revealing, from immodest wear and tempting glances at the small pieces of clothing they wear. It's a difficult journey, brother, and with the liberalization (forgive me if you're liberal here) of society, sexualization of our culture is going to become progressively more and more accepted.

Very interesting discussion that it sparked.  cultures that don't clothe the sexual parts of members of either sex are broken and fallen just like any other culture. lust is less about nakedness than covetousness: ""thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.""   meaning: lust is a quest for what is beyond God's boundary. There is no culture that does not covet. That's what it means to be a sinner. And every human, descending from Adam by ordinary generation is a sinner.

Our storyline is the same as yours- my husband thought getting married would solve his problem and it ended up being worse because of the stress of marriage.   Do you have a real life accountability partner? Have you guys tried counseling? Counseling with a biblical couple has been SO helpful for us.   additionally, has she intentionally worked through healing for herself?

NoFapChristians,397iou,hopefulwife,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"""keep talking to each other and keep praying. it's as simple and difficult as that!""    Haha, that's very apt.  I do not have a ""real life"" accountability partner, though I did sign up for the accountability program here.  I've tried unsucessfully to get a real accountability partner, but so far everyone's been too busy or too uncomfortable with the prospect.  Honestly, I'm not sure what I should be looking for in an accountability partner.  Do you have any suggestions on what that kind of relationship should be like?  I've always thought of it as more like AA where you get a ""sponsor"" that is also dealing with everything you have, but I'm open to getting an accountability partner that isn't struggling with the same stuff.  I just don't really have an idea in mind of how to explain to them what that sort of arrangement would entail.  We have not done any marriage counseling yet, although not for lack of wanting.  She's pregnant right now and has been so sick all the time that she hasn't been able to do much of anything.  In fact, right now it usually ends up that I get home and she immediately hands me our one year old and she goes to lay down for a few hours until our daughter has to go to bed.  It's been really rough timing.  We both intend to work something out with counseling after the pregnancy (or if she feels well before the end of it) but I really wish we could do something sooner.  On the subject of counseling, do you have any recommendations?  We met with an elder of our church a couple times (before she began feeling very ill from the pregnancy) but he wasn't exactly a professional psychologist either.  I don't know how necessary you think that is vs talking to a christian.   additionally, has she intentionally worked through healing for herself?    Can you elaborate?  I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm going to lean toward no, though.  No disrepect meant to her in the way I say this, but I feel she kind of curls up in a ball and waits for herself to cool off and doesn't interact with me much for a few days when this happens.  I've never really thought of that as healthy, but when you're in the dog house you don't really get to tell people how to act.  Thank you so much for the comment.  I found it really encouraging."

The enemy can start lying to her and if she begins believing those lies then things can really start going hardwire.   There are several good books out there to help process. There's also a website called journeytojoyandhealing.com which has professional counselors available by phone.   Our church gave ussome money for professional biblical counseling. Your church might have someone they recommend, but dont be afraid to shop around. We meet with a couple once a month, although at first it was once a week. The couple we meet with went through an affair and a divorce, then remarried 7 years later. Their situation wasn't exactly like ours, but no matter the situation, the prescription is Jesus.   As far as accountability relationships go, its up to you to define what you want out of it. My husband's is defined as two guys growing in God. So, they don't really talk much about his addiction, because once you get in the recovery process, the addiction isn't the point anymore, following Jesus is. When he has temptations they dobtext back and forth about it a bit. His mentor is an older guy in the church. He went through 3 other guys before finding this one.

Always, always, drop everything immediately to read (if possible at all. I.e. even take a toilet break to read if you need... just don't bring your phone).  As for what I meditate on, I meditate on what the passage means for me. What is God telling me to do? E.g. Jesus is the Way, and I have chosen him; that means I shouldn't look back at my sin, because I'm not going that way. Or; James 4, ""Submit to God... Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and he will draw near to you."" I have to resist, live in obedience for now.

It's more about how you treated the girl sending them.  Telling her ""to mature"" doesn't help the situation because you are only validating her low sense of self-worth.    On a different note, you need to tell someone about this.  A 13 year old girl sending nude photos to people is extremely serious.  Perhaps there is a pastor you feel comfortable talking to."

Obviously you should be working through reconciliation with her, but counting on her as your only real life support is going to wear her down and put more stress on her than necessary. She should not be your primary accountability partner.  I can explain in more detail my stance on this if you'd like - just wanted to keep it short for now."

From my understanding it usually goes like, ""will you be my accountability partner?"" ""Yeah, sure"", without explicitly stating what you both are going to commit to and what both peoples goals are. My husband and his study partner have a book they're reading through and meet in person for about an hour every week.

This was a problem I struggled with for years.  I grew up in the church and knew that God would forgive all.  What has changed for me is that I'm no longer doing this just because He wants me to and I don't want to disappoint Him.  I am working on my sins because I want to be closer to Him and my sins separate us.

Chastisement is a form of discipline,imho, much like Peter endured after his denial of Christ,or Paul experienced with his 'thorn in the flesh'.Chastisement leads to restoration,punishment, which is reserved for the wicked, does not,big difference.I think we are arguing about words here.Forgive the 'woodshed' metaphor .Sorry the analogy offended you.Thankfully,we are free to use words that work best for us as long as we define what their meanings are to each other,but this thread is going way off topic from the op,it seems.So, perhaps we can agree to disagree?

The hardened heart is,in fact,evidence of judgement already being wrought on the sinner,or the nation for that matter,e.g. the Jews of Christ's time.Whosover will may come...but the one who has heard the Truth and resisted it will become hardened,for example Pharaoh and from that point,there is no return as the conscience becomes seared.By continually practicing sin we begin to stop hearing the pleas of the Holy Spirit,at a certain point which only the Lord knows for sure,the dreaded silence begins.It's not that we can't come,it's that we won't come due to our loving our sin more than God.We have eyes but we dont see,we have ears but we dont hear.From  this point there is only the fearful expectation of  final judgement...""It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a wrathful God"".so,yeah,I think we agree.God forbid it ever happens to us.

That doesn't mean to abuse grace as a license to sin. But it does mean that when we do sin, the grace is there for the taking. You're right, to willfully engage in sin thinking, ""God will forgive me"", is just a veiled form of disobedience. Fear of the Lord is good, but I think love for the Lord is better, as it will naturally produce fear and obedience. If you truly love Jesus, you will seek to be like Him, to be holy and pure, and obedience will naturally occur. Does that mean you will be perfect? Of course not. Even the apostle Paul wrestled with his sin nature. I think you have to examine your heart. Is it penitent, is it breaking for God or for you? Are you pursuing Him or something or someone else? Don't make the fight about abstainment from sin, this is just moralism, and you will never win. Understand God has grace for you even when you abuse that grace. Fight with love for Him, let him be your new affection, your highest aim, the ultimate goal... to grow in Him and to love and honor and glorify Him."

You are a child of god, dont doom yourself for what happened out of the flesh, god is not about changing your flesh, its not going to change anyways. Living with god is about living without self. You are a child of god who does not have to fear him, the fear in the bible is meant like you have to believe strongly that god is in control, that he is sovereign and that he wont break his commandments. But on the other hand he is your loving abba father, your daddy, papa. You know what i am talking about. So lets stop this fear, you are not meant to be fearful. Fear is not holding you back to do what you want to do to please you. Guilt is holding you back to get out of fear of judgement. You are his child, not by your choice, but by his. So stop this guilt/shame thing. I was on the same level like you and god changed my life in 1 step and that is truth. Truth still sets free. I lived a life where i was PMOing at least every week and since one day and i knew on that day that i am free.

NoFapChristians,390jt7,Keyser__,6,Mon Jun 8 10:50:23 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, theres two things we can feed:  The flesh, or the spirit (coming from Galatians 6).  View the flesh as a monster with a big appetite.  Every time you feed it, though, he grows bigger, and gains a bigger appetite.  He grows stronger, but less satisfied each time he is fed, as his appetite only grows bigger.    Every time we allow ourselves to watch that commercial on TV, browse social media looking for an enticing image, play through sexual immorality in our heads, give into pmo [all of which means we believe the devils lies.  We know they are lies, let us live like it], the fight only gets harder.  So, from my experience, here is a list of things that have helped me in the past:     No facebook, twitter, or youtube browsing.  If there is a specific person you need to speak with, or a worship video on youtube, goto the site with your intention in mind and leave.   Have some type of an accountability partner.  NFC is a great place, but I believe accountability with a Christian friend in real life is a whole 'nother horse that's is very helpful.  When you ""team-up"" so to speak, you will hold yourself accountable to a higher standard.   Beware of TV commercials.  I know all the commercials right now on ABC when I'm watching the NBA finals that are enticing to me (enticing as in the devil is tempting me).  As soon as it starts, I turn the channel or deliberately look away.  If I allow myself to indulge in an immoral fantasy in my head, not only would that be sin, but I'm feeding a monster that will want more.   Get an adblocker on your computer.  I just got one through google chrome and it works wonders!   Get rid of your pmo device immediately, if possible.  I have gotten rid of 2 such devices now, and it is ""freeing"" Goto bed early, workout early, have an active day.  Do not sit around and waste your time.  Part of the problem is that we are creatures made to live active (not just meaning exercise) lives to glorify God! We have an amazing calling; when we reject it, we are left wondering ""what meaning do I have?"" and then the devil comes in the front door.   Live out how God is calling you to serve.  Get involved in your local church.  You are not going to be preaching sermons or anything, but God has a role for you in the church.  I had an instance recently that really motivated me.  Prior to service, I was asked if I had viewed porn in the last 12 months.  It broke me down to say yes, but God built me back up, even stronger than before.  Had a great talk with the leadership, and they forgave me and allowed me to serve in the capacity I felt God called me to do.  I now feel accountable.  God will not only save us but use us!  How could I view porn and sacrifice my service to God?  As I write this now, it seems unthinkable that I would pmo today! and that's the position you wanna be in!   Do whatever it is you know to do.  Identify what caused the relapse, and fix it.   Hopefully, this list doesn't sound too hard.  It makes the fight much easier, I promise.  And, with time, new habits form.  In Christ, prayers"

NoFapChristians,390jt7,Blueaugustine,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"It had been building up the last few days and today was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak.   It always goes this way. We ignore and neglect to address the build-up. In fact, most of us don't even consider the build up part of the problem. In my experience, the build-up is the key to dealing with this.  I've suggested before that folks check out Carnes book Out of the Shadows. He makes the case that we're at least as ""addicted"" to the buildup as we are to the PMO itself.  If you're spiritually minded, this should tell you something important about this struggle.

NoFapChristians,39164a,new_life55,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for asking this.  As a Christian, I should be fully devoted to God. I put a lot of time in God, at minimum three Bible studies a day and I pray a lot. What I need to change is applying all of what I read into life, instead of just agreeing with it and forgetting and relapsing. I need to acknowledge that what I am doing is definitely wrong EVERY TIME and I need to stop making excuses. Praise God."
NoFapChristians,39164a,vxlccm,3,Mon Jun 8 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"I've always felt a heavy load of guilt. It can be stifling, though. So, processing a repentance in stages as it were, makes a lot of sense to avoid a downward spiral. The devil would love to choke your spirit into disillusionment and abandonment and hopelessness.  Jesus always teaches us to repent. As I've grown spiritually in life, I've come to understand this as more than mere abandonment of sin, but re-committing to not screw up. For me, this has to feel consuming and like a total change of heart. And, for me, it is not easy meaning it takes time. I respect others who are able to turn on a dime without relapse.  I'd say it's not ""okay"" to relapse. But, it's okay to have relapsed and repented, that's okay."

NoFapChristians,38wz3e,Turtwig476,10,Sun Jun 7 15:30:17 2015 UTC,Calling porn an acid is pretty accurate. It is a killer. It sucks out your soul. I don't think there is anything as damaging to a man as porn. And the only way out is with God's help. There is no human way possible to recover from a porn addiction.
NoFapChristians,38wz3e,hubbahubba5,2,Sun Jun 7 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"It lies about sex and women. It substitutes sexual perversion for intimacy. It makes us feel like men without requiring us to be men. And in true demonic fashion, it always leaves us feeling empty and guilty the moment the pleasure is over.    I thought I'd weigh in on this quote, and post, as it was one of the most popular of ""last week.""  I agree with all three things above:     porn tells likes about sex and women. I ADD: but so also does lust and constant obsessing about sex, dating, relationships, and even intimacy or communication or whatever IN MARRIAGE.  We live this life for Christ and not our own self-centered, and selfish needs/desires/wants/fantasies.   porn substitutes sexual perversions for intimacy. I agree with this, but with this caveat: the substitute is not ""for intimacy"" it is for ""god given intimacy."" There is something very intimate, and therefore very alluring, about strip clubs, hookers, adulterous relationships, sex out side of marriage, and porn. It is all initmate. But it is not lawful intimacy, and therefore it is not ultimately satisfying but ultimately disappointing.   Porn makes us feel like men. I agree with this, to a point. Like the lie of promised intimacy in porn, sex outside of marriage lies and says you can still feel manly, or feel aroused, or feel heroic if you use it. But that's a lie. But I don't consciously feel ""manly"" so to speak when I'm looking at Porn or tempted to lust after women in real life. I think I'm acting out a narrative of masculinity that is false. I'm actively sinning by living out a story that's untrue: real men act on their convictions before God, not on their bodily urges.   May God have mercy on my soul.   with great hope in Christ,  BA. edit: added italics"

U dont think infant baptism is a bad thing to do, but it really comes down to the heaer issue.  Missaley makes good points.   also don't worry about what your parents think in this regards, worry about what got thinks of you, not people.  Relationship with Christ is a personal thing, it shouldn't be dependant on what your family/frienda/culture think.      if u still worrying about it I can see the enemy using this to give you troubles.          pray about it, seek the lord, get baptises and KNOW you are saved and be safe in that security that you've done what's been commanded of you.

The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.   This can be one of the hardest parts battling this sin, but, for me, it has been the second most important.  From my perspective, telling my closest Christian brothers, pastor, and a bible study group that I met with frequently last year has been a huge help for me, and is something that I have not taken full advantage of this time around.  When you really team up with a lot of people that care for, forgive, and love you even though they know your secrets it becomes really hard to throw away all that support.  One reason we may search for porn is because we desire intimacy, love, and relationships.  The accountability relationships I have had far outweigh the counterfeit fake ones I wrongly seek through porn."

Basically it can be used for two things:   blocking sites on all devices If words, sites pop up then a notification is sent to an admin (of the software but probably also of this sub if they are willing)   There are other features too but I haven't looked into them much.  (we could also just do this between accountability partners but that may be more challenging due to trust.)   Personal and Group Pricing  The first Accountability User is $9.99/mo., and each additional Accountability User is $2. Add Filtering to any user for $1.50, and if you are only using Filtering the first user is $5.99.   That is the bit that I thought would be the most useful for me as Blocks can become a Game to try and get around them (maybe that's just me)        I have ideas on how to get the needed money from the people who are joining but I would first like to know how many are interested so I will make a survey [here](not yet but soon) to see what if you are interested in  accountability or filter or both."
NoFapChristians,38z2ld,edibility,2,Mon Jun 8 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"It's humble and contrite to say that the flesh is weak, I admire that. However, when we say that we're weak we're causing weakness.   Try this one instead: The spirit is willing and the flesh is strong. Say it even if you don't believe it, say it until you do believe it.  It's the message of the resurrection. Say it with conviction and power. Pray it. If you 'condemn' yourself as weak, God sees through to your heart and knows better. Affirm it; ""My spirit is willing and my flesh is strong!"". Christ always grants strength, but it comes from having faith. ""Through the power of Christ, I CAN walk on water"" is what Peter has to say, otherwise - he sinks. The flesh is strong! Faith can't help but produce the truth of powerful confidence. Surrender anything weak, let God supplant it with strength. We don't work the NFC plan alone, not even for a minute. We defer and collaborate with God every second of the way. That's and unbroken stream of grace filled strength."

Rather, I will surrender my whole self and not desire any strength of my own, it is all of God.   It's not me who overcomes PMO or anything else, but Christ.

As you can see, he was saved, but he was brought into true sainthood and his words through God were so powerful that they became the Scripture that we read every day. Paul was a new man.

You have been such an encouragement to me and many others on this subreddit;  It gives me such joy to see God working in your life.  It is a miracle God chose us in this fight, sinners.  I wonder how many dads out there hate going to church because of the conviction of their sin, how many wives are left bewildered and isolated because of the hiding of this sin, how many sons live in depression, how many people avoid church, all because of this sin.  I praise God for his faithfulness in my life.    I know a guy who struggled with PMO for 15 years.  He also struggled with doubt too.  Seems like a familiar story for many men today, and, I pray otherwise, but many of these men will reject their calling because of it.  This guy, though, is now a pastor and has been pornfree for over 15 years.  It is amazing to think of the work that God did in his life.  1 Phillipians 1:6     And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ     And, how great would it be if in a few years from today, we meet back up on here and can rejoice in the work the God did in our lives?

I have been in similar situation twice.  3 Years ago I had a streak of 11 months, but, after a relapse, my streak decreased to 1 month, then shorter and shorter.  I did not learn from my mistake this past year.  I had a streak of 6 months, followed by 3, then 1, 1, then a struggle for a month.  There are several reasons behind this rebellion on my part, but the one that may relate to you is that I was a little to focused on ""the streak"" rather than my heart.  The result was that I was discouraged, and felt less motivated, when I shouldn't have been!.  The same faith I had on day 1 was the same on day 300.

NoFapChristians,38syph,unsung8,3,Sat Jun 6 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"It's common. The answer is hidden in your question: simply start up with your spiritual practices again. Start small, a prayer before going to bed or reading a chapter from the Bible when you wake up. Then work your way up. It is probably a good idea to mark the beginning of your streak with a spiritual practice, i.e., confessing your sins in prayer or to your pastor.  In my opinion this is a sign that you were merely containing yourself, seeing how long you could hack it, by brute force of will. In the end something's got to give. Rather, try to relax and let these urges simply go by you, through the help of God. Easier said than done, I know."

And now lets get stuff clear, you heart is right, but the identity you think you have is wrong you are a loved child of god. God loves you as much as he loves jesus.

Even if you have stopped praying, prayer is essential to a healthy relationship with God and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. As /u/MYUTMOST said, start small. Satan has entered you through this channel of pornography and lust, and even a small resistance with the strength of God will render him weak, useless. Build yourself up into the Kingdom of God, brother.  The Lord loves you, and will always give you the strength to help yourself through temptation. There is no temptation that you cannot bear with the strength of God, and if there is, God will always give you a way out.  Being a Day One myself, I may sound a bit hypocritical here but even if you relapse, you have not fallen from God's grace. He loves you and always will, brother. That is what you must keep in mind. Pray on your sins, pray for strength, pray to hear God when he tells you that there is a way out. Man cannot live on willpower alone - but you can maintain yourself with strength through God.

NoFapChristians,38syph,Blueaugustine,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:51:29 2015 UTC,"I was trying to find a podcast I listened to awhile back about a man, who was going through seminary to become a pastor, hid his struggle with porn till he was 27, when his wife caught him.  Take my word for it, its a great story, but its not much helpful since I cannot find it.  Anyway, I seek to encourage you hear.    You say your heart is not in it.  I take this to mean that you must not realize what is at stake here.  To use an analogy from John Piper, if ISIS had your family members held hostage, with a knife to their throats, and told you that if you clicked on the website then they would slit their throats, you would not click.  If someone would give you $1 million to not watch porn, you would not watch porn.  If we think that there is no real consequence with watching porn, and no real reward for seeking the Lord, then we will not really care about stopping.  We may know that it is a sin, and that we are forgiven, and we stop there.  We continue to live in the cycle of porn because, deep down, we actually like it.  We like taking advantage of God's grace, taking pride in a streak, then enjoying our reward.  But do not be fooled.    For several years, I was trapped in this line of thought.  I'd watch porn, feel terrible for 2 weeks, forget about it, then watch again.  And it only got worse.  Eventually, I began taking steps to change this behavior with confession and limiting my internet usage, but the root of the problem was still there.  I believed the porn offered more then God.  I cringe when I write that.  But it is how I lived through my actions.  Once I started believing that God offers so much more, once I realized the severity of my brokenness, the depravity of my soul that was created with the intention of glorifying God, once I realized the damage I was setting up for my (Lord willing) future wife, and once the Holy Spirit began convicting me of my sin and changing my desires, then things got real.  Praise God that I can say today that I am disgusted with PMO.  I couldn't have said that a few years ago, but I am disgusted with porn.  But I still beg God to keep me from it, because I know, by good evidence, how broken I really am.    The story does not end here though.  God is just, and sin is so apart from his nature, but he is also so merciful.  So much that he sent his Son to die for the sons of sin, so that we may become sons of God (CS Lewis paraphrased).  Began seeking God today.  A good starting place is Pslam 51 (after David commited adultery and murder, and prayed to God to change his hearts desires), or maybe you already know what you oughtta do, who you oughtta tell, what changes you oughtta make.

Psalm 51:     Have mercy on me, O God,     according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy     blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,     and cleanse me from my sin! For I know my transgressions,     and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned     and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words     and blameless in your judgment. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,     and in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,     and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;     wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness;     let the bones that you have broken rejoice. Hide your face from my sins,     and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God,     and renew a right[b] spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence,     and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation,     and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors your ways,     and sinners will return to you. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,     O God of my salvation,     and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. O Lord, open my lips,     and my mouth will declare your praise. For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;     you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;     a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;     build up the walls of Jerusalem; then will you delight in right sacrifices,     in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;     then bulls will be offered on your altar."

NoFapChristians,38ornn,fapstronaut85,3,Fri Jun 5 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"David, a man whom the bible said he had a heart ""modeled after God"", committed adultery and then killed the women's husband.  He then probably went the rest of his life without adultery, but that was not why his heart was ""modeled after God"".  It is only because of his repentant heart, his longing for God's mercy, and his adoration of Gods grace.  Listen to his heart as he writes psalm 51     Have mercy on me,[a] O God,     according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy     blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,     and cleanse me from my sin! For I know my transgressions,     and my sin is ever before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned     and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words     and blameless in your judgment. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,     and in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,     and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;     wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness;     let the bones that you have broken rejoice. Hide your face from my sins,     and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God,     and renew a right[b] spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence,     and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation,     and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors your ways,     and sinners will return to you Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,     O God of my salvation,     and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. O Lord, open my lips,     and my mouth will declare your praise. For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;     you will not be pleased with a burnt offering The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;     a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;     build up the walls of Jerusalem; then will you delight in right sacrifices,     in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;     then bulls will be offered on your altar.     God is so full of mercy, greater than any sin, and, if in Christ, we are forgiven.  There is nothing we do to earn this grace, but we live in obedience out of obedience to God because he has given us this Grace.  Congratulations on your streak, just pick up where you left up, but God is more concerned about your heart.  We can go 100 days without ""porn"", but Jesus said looking on a women with lust is adultery in your heart.  We need the Holy spirit for this type of obedience.  I can abstain from porn, but can look on a nonpornographic image with evil intent and MO all the more.  Ask God to change your hearts desire first, and then freedom will come    Moral behavioral changes are one thing, but in Chirst, we are becoming new creations with new desires (and with that comes moral regeneration)"
NoFapChristians,38ornn,new_life55,2,Fri Jun 5 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"Dude I know all about edging and I'm sorry to hear about the relapse. Edging is a trap! A slippery slope. Way to go, keeping up the fight. Remember that while having a high count is nice (really, praise God for that!!) it's not the end goal. God wants to make us like Him.

NoFapChristians,38ornn,lodeezy,2,Fri Jun 5 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"i don't really know how to think about sexuality. about my sexuality. i've always repressed it, or gorged upon it in secrecy and fantasy     I kinda wanted to add my 2 cents in here about this, hopefully it is helpful to you.  I'm going to give what I believe is the right perspective:  That the bible is the Word of God, and has the best insight into our lives, but also that these truths have a scientific basis in the real world.  First, here is a few verses about Gods call for his Sons and Daughter (Note:  These are not laws on how to enter heaven;  These are attributes that grow in believers through the holy spirit, we enter heaven through our faith in Jesus, and this faith manifests itself in good fruit) 1 Thessolonians 4:3-5     For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God;     1 Corinthians 10:13     No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.      Hebrew 13:4     Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous     Matthew 5:28     But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart     Job 31:1-3     “I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin? What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high? Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity?    The call is sexual purity is clear.  I see what your concern is:  That your sexuality is part of who you are, and I agree.  God created women who are beautiful and attractive to us, and he created us with the intent to have limitless sex with one of them through marriage.  Marriage is where our sexuality is meant to used.  Now, maybe your like me and your too young for marriage?    In this case:  We never have to act on our temptation.  A women may walk down the street, and our flesh immediately takes over, yes, but, Paul said:     So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.     So, as believers, we can ignore it.  It is suppressing the desire to act on sin, yes, but it is more so accepting the grace of God and his renewal of our minds.  2 Corinthians 5:17     Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come:[a] The old has gone, the new is here!     Sex is great.  Sexual immorality is terrible.  God calls us to purity outside of marriage.  The call is clear, but it is how God knows the world best works.  In Christ, we do not need to act on our sexual desires, we are now, free from the power of sin!"
NoFapChristians,38ornn,new_life55,2,Sat Jun 6 11:36:00 2015 UTC,"thank you very much for your support of your argument with Bible verses, and for coming to my aid in my confusion. it's hard to figure some of this stuff out! ultimately, what matters more than my relationship to any woman is my relationship with God. unless he and i are tight, i'm going to be controlled by my relationship to her."
NoFapChristians,38ornn,new_life55,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"i think the 'sexual purity' movement, as i understand it, is deeply flawed. i think the movement defines 'purity' as 'perfection', so that you're only pure if you never have that desire for so and so a woman, or if you do experience it you kill it right away before it can ever become a king-size temptation.   the way i look at purity is this: i am going to desire who i am going to desire. what i do with those thoughts, and how i act on those desires is going to shape me. being pure means accepting what is in me and what awakens in the presence of a beautiful woman. being good means acting on that purity in a way that values the woman's humanity, my humanity, and God's fatherhood.   don't you get this sometimes? Like, this woman walked into my job the other day. beautiful body. i mean, just simply gorgeous. i looked. i definitely did multiple times. i would have loved to have sex with her. but then i think to myself, ""it's not just sex. i would wake up to this woman. do i really wanna be involved with her? it's not just sex. what if a child gets in the mix?"" and then there's the reality that she's a little girl inside, and i am a little boy inside. is this what is good for us? wasn't i taught any better?"
NoFapChristians,38ornn,denkel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:40:13 2015 UTC,"i am going to desire who i am going to desire. what i do with those thoughts, and how i act on those desires is going to shape me     I do agree with you here, and I think that this is classic temptation the are bodies are default to, but, unless acted mentally or physically in a way that produces sexual gratifcation, it was only temptation and not sin.     this woman walked into my job the other day. beautiful body. i mean, just simply gorgeous.     I do agree with you here.  It is certainly not wrong to acknowledge that women are beautiful;  God created them that way!  We are called, though, to indulge sexually with only one women, partly because of the nature of the world, and for other reasons.    I see where your coming from now.  I think if it wasn't for the damage that the porn industry did to sex in our culture (or if it wasn't for sinners (us) indulgence in the porn industry) there wouldn't be such a backlash against sex that God created himself.  I guess its just that PMO has saturated our culture, combined with the fact we don't get married till mid-late 20s, that sexual immorality is the main focus, and not godly sex in marriage. As a result, sex in general gets a bad rap.  Anyways, thanks for your encouragement with all your comment replies, I woke up in a bad position and was really encouraged by your other comments, Thanks man!"

Which some couldn't even acquire (me neither since 45 days and has been my max so far. and i relapsed too yesterday (i need to reset also)  And i am aware myself that edging is the same as ""tempting satan to tempt you"" that being said i don't want you to feel even more bad about yourself. I want to encourage you which i'm gonna do now :D  As New life55 said, look at david. What david did is. When he sinned, he ran to God immediately. Like a child who made a mistake ad runs to his dad to confess it. David was standing in repentance after he made a mistake. He trusted on the Lord, and ran to Him even when he made a mistake.  Psalm 16 You Will Not Abandon My Soul  A Miktama of David.  1 Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge. 2 I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you.” 3 As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight. 4 The sorrows of those who run afterc another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips. 5 The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.6 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance. 7 I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.d 8 I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken. 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole beinge rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure. 10 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption. 11 You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.  Even so for us, when we sin, run to God. Even tho it feels rubbish, unworthy. Remember, we need Christ at all times, wether things are going good or bad, when we are happy or sad, when we are healthy or sick, even when we relapse or remain on a short/long streak. Depend on God in every situation in your life.  Ad i want to encourage you with this also which is my favorite and keeps me going wether i fall or wether i stand.  Hebrew 12 Jesus, Founder and Perfecter of Our Faith 1Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.  Do Not Grow Weary  3 Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.** 4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?**  “My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him. 6For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.”  7It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? 8If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. 9Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? 10For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. 11For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.  12Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, 13and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. 14Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord  This... God allows us to go trough discipline, for us to grow stronger, if we don't fall, how will we know how to be strong?? I'm not saying relapsing is good, but God knows our struggle, toughts, hardships. He is patient for us to be build up in character to stand strong. This takes time. But have faith that in the days, weeks, moths, years coming He wil make us stronger, trough faith, knowledge, understanding, falling and standing strong, in our case from PMO.  Don't feel down, but be happy with the 99 days, and now you start again, with new information on how to avoid this edging/relapsing next time. And don't let your situation lead you away from God by feeling down or not praying to him, but rather do the opposite, which might be the hardest.. but do it, if you learn that, you will become so much stronger....   Stay strong brother !"

Also weekends tend to be busy so I apologize for giving crumbs. I wish we could hang out and chat in person, the digital connection thing is hard. Plus every day there are new people who come on, new people who seem to drop off, and it is hard to keep up with the flow. Also having been a part for 45 days or so, and posting almost every day for those days, I'm starting to see the same questions. I wonder if it might help if our sub were a little more organized. Absolutely not a complaint but just thinking outloud.  As for a more substantive comment to your post, brother: I was sad, honestly, and sad not only for you, but that I had crossed ""my line"" around the same time as well.  The heart of your post is this sentence/s:   i've always repressed [my sex/sexuality], or gorged upon it in secrecy and fantasy. and while edging, i would come close, and then back away. but then i would come close again, and then back away again. this dance of danger continued until this morning, when i felt extremely aroused in my shower.   I've recommended Carnes book before, Out of the Shadows. It is quite good and makes the scientific and I think also biblically sound argument that the arousal period (what you call edging) is as much a part of the addictive cycle as the PMO itself.  We're hooked on edging, is the point, I think. Its flirting, questing, seeking, looking, hungering, wondering, spinning, cycling, meditating, etc. All that.  So the put off put on principle of Ephesians 4 (let me know if you don't know that) means we can't just replace PMO with something. The cycle of anticipating PMO (edging) has to be replaced with something else as well. Something of the Lord.

Part of my point in being organized is that perhaps if we label posts as falling into different categories, if our mods could figure out how to do that, we could drill into different themes when we see them posted. Eg., ""newbies,"" or ""just starting out,"" vs. hard mode, vs. philosophy of no fap christians, etc.  I don't recommend the sub due to content that i find objectionable and possibly triggering, but the red pill has a very well organized site.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."

I’m almost 30, I’m too old to be going through this puppy love-sick heartbreak, but I really am.   No, you are not too old to be feeling bad about a break up.  You are not too old to be crying over a girl.  You are not too old to have feelings this strong.  You are allowed to feel bad, you are allowed to cry.   I have being using pornography as my coping mechanism   Welcome to the group, you are not alone.   I tried stopping PMO and got about 34 days and then I fell and started watching porn again. The worst part is that I just feel numb, I’m having trouble being excited and happy about my life (which is objectively speaking, awesome), my friends, everything.   This is one of the signs of addiction.  This is also one of the steps that some people take in mourning.  And you are in mourning over your lost relationship.  Between the one-two punch there it would almost be odd if you weren't dealing with this problem.  I wish that I could now tell you that there is some trick, some ""life hack"" for fixing this.  There is no easy way forward, shoot there is no easy way to stay like this.  So right after reading this I want you to do a few things for you.  The first is easy, I want you to tell God about this.  Remember that he is right there with you, not up in the sky, and he is going through this with you so you don't have to do it alone.  He is in your heart which means he knows how you feel and he is weeping along side you, mourning as you mourn.  Then go contact one of those friends.  You don't have to tell them what you are struggling with if you don't feel comfortable telling them that, but one of the best things you can do right now is some life affirming things with other people.  Here's the catch, you aren't going to want to, especially at first.  Small talk and regular activities might feel off to you, like something is wrong and unnatural.  That is also normal.   I just wanted to post here for some catharsis and also ask for the prayers and support of this subreddit.   Hey, that's what we are here for.  Also congrats on a 34 day streak, that's pretty impressive actually.  I for one will pray for you.  Godspeed"
NoFapChristians,38myua,HurtingFather,2,Fri Jun 5 09:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'll pray for you :)  I know exactly what this is like.  Before I became a christian, I've had numerous ex's where our relationship involved pleasing the flesh and for-filling lusty desires.  These relationships and habits created many addictions I struggle with still. Drugs, alcohol, and sexual addictions.  It's a good way to get lost and lose who you are.  You're trying to fill a void in your heart my friend.  Your looking for love and intimacy and trying to fill your heart with lies.  I struggle with that numbness myself.  However, I have been on a personal growth kick, constantly learning, trying to find new hobbys/passions, exploring things with real cause, reading the bible, building my relationship with God, and about to go back to school to be a teacher.  Find meaning and purpose in your life, learn what it means to enjoy yourself, forget about finding happiness on the outside.  Thoughts are also choices, and we have the gift of freewill.  My thoughts and opinions based on my experience.  34 days is a lot more than I can say.  Good luck!  Anything is possible and it only takes a matter of a second for anything to change."

We all start as defenseless babies in this battle against PMO. But by coming here, discussing, finding new ways, even falling and standing up we get stronger and stronger. And trough faith, knowledge in the word of God, which brings Self-control, prayer, reading scripture, meditating on the word of God and God himself. you will eventually grow into a boy, and mature like a man who is unshakable because of experience..... stay strong and feel free to ask anything..."

[1 Corinthians 3:16]  One of the important things is to learn when you stumble.  Figure out what went wrong and use that so you don't make the same mistake later.  This is very important because without learning there can be no growth.  Failing is not the end of the world, but failing to learn can be the end of your journey.

Learning to prune back on your internet use might not be out of line here.  I know I had to actually remove certain things that I was doing online just because the temptation was there or because it was a huge time sink.

It's amazing how everytime I open the bible or go online I find something new and totally amazing about Jesus :)  I don't really know how I can best help you in a way that is going to benefit you the most. I haven't been in this NoFap-game for too long, but I can share some of my ""secrets"".   Always stay close to God and try get to know him more ""Surround yourself"" with worship. Perhaps add some worship songs onto your iPod, play a worship album in your car or something of the like and just worship everywhere you go(another thing I like doing is taking ""worship-walks"". That means that you go out for a walk by yourself and your main focus is praising God, talking to and praying to him. It just feels so nice being alone with God. And now when summer is coming we have nice weather to walk in. And you as a bonus you get exercise by walking. But keep God in center, always!) This may be hard for some, but this was the turning point for me. I saw one of those ""What would Jesus do""- necklace when I was out shopping and then later when the Devil was tempting me to fap, all of a sudden I remembered ""What would Jesus do"" and in my head I got a picture of Jesus and I imaged him walking the earth and I thought to myself ""Did Jesus fap when he was on the earth?"". I quickly came to the conclusion that he most likely didn't and therefore I shouldn't. Since then I haven't been tempted, not even ONCE! Praise the lord. And if I see a beautiful woman and I feel like these aren't clear and pure thoughts in my mind, I just focus on him and what kind of thoughts he would have had for that woman. When the devil pokes at you, turn your face to God. Because it it always better to focus on the solution than the problem. The good thing with this is that the devil will continue to poke you because he thinks that you will eventually fall, but if you turn to God everytime the devil tries to discourage you he will only push you closer to God!   Sorry for the clusterfuck text wall, but I hope you can read it and understand it and get some kind of help from it. If you want to talk privately or perhaps ""partner up"" against the devil feel free to send me a PM. I would love to have some more christian friends!  Be blessed and know that God loves you, and his love never fails. Even though you may be in deep seas and the whole world is against you, know that he is always with you. And if he is with you, it doesn't matter who is against you because JESUS IS LORD! AMEN  EDIT: One more good point"

After this period, the testosterone is used in other manly traits, such as growth.  I cannot confirm this, though, just what I read.  Remember, though 1 Corinthians 10:13     No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man.

Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,     On our own strength, not only can we not conquer sin, but we cannot enter the kingdom of God.  God is just, and must punish sinners.  The story does not end here though.  God is also merciful, and offers an escape!  Those who repent of their sins and place their faith in Jesus whole heartedly receive salvation, and become a child of God, and God does not let the enemy take his children.  John 10:28     I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.     Additionally, not only did Jesus take the punishment owned to us, but he will deliver us from our flesh and make us new!  Romans 7:24     Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?  Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!     Take hope, Jesus has conquered sin.  The victory is won!  I would suggest you read through Romans, slowly, and learn what it means to be saved.    Additionaly, I would like to encourage you.  I have been in a place where I could not go 5 days without either.  But God has worked far greater than I expected in the last 3 years!  Freedom in Christ is so much greater then the shame and chain of porn!  Prayers brother, would like to hear back from you"

And Christ calls us to have very serious attitudes about cutting sin out of our lives. Is it about what your heart believes, your actions eventuay catch up to what your heart believes.   Your committing sin does not separate you from God, grace covers you, but to say that you most likely will give up means that you down in the depths of your heart you don't believe in his saving power, and victory over sin, which means that you haven't accepted his gift of salvation which does keep you out of relationship with Him.   But there is hope! Ask the Lord to help your unbelief as the man who petitioned Christ for help did and He will have compassion and mercy on you!"

NoFapChristians,38gjj3,Dnomyar7,2,Sat Jun 6 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"see this is a very good question. i am not a theologian, but there are some points that are valuable. for one, if you're worried about it, then you're still probably saved. that's the conviction of the holy spirit. if you stop being worried about it, and just go to meltdown, then God help your soul at that point.   there's a lot of things that i once thought, too. and let me tell you in the blackest hours of despair, when i thought 'how can God still love me, how can he possibly forgive me for all i've done and all the relapses i've done ... i'm such a mess' ... God was right there the whole time. i couldn't have said that then, but i can say that now.   God is with me now. His upward call is pulling my spirit up at this very moment toward Heaven. I know it, I feel it, his power and his love are all around me. God is so beautiful, so healing, so glorious, so winsome, so precious, such a good good dad.   right now you see the possibility of continuing to fail and relapsing your entire life. right now is the key part of that sentence. yeah. you see that possibility, and it is possible. it's also possible you turn your back on Jesus forever. that's the way this thing works, you see. Satan wants to take your soul and imprison you once decision at a time. Malachi Martin, a famous Catholic exorcist, has said that the devil gets you to compromise your will, to give your will over to demons one choice at a time until there's very little left of you that's free. That's when possession becomes a reality.   Remember that although it feels hard to resist, it's actually doable. I remember 2 weeks into a streak i was miserable. absolutely miserable. you have to do what you have to do in order to gain some momentum and make some headway. find out why you want to do this, because lemme tell you i made very little progress when my motivation was guilt or shame. find out a positive why you wanna do this. ask yourself 'why' 'why' 'why' and each answer you get, ask 'why' again.   bottom line is God decides who is saved and who isn't, and i'm so glad he's surprised me by choosing me after all i've messed up with. man, i felt like the worst relapser and hypocrite in the history of the world. the spectacularness of God's great miracles is always greater than the filthiness of our sins. God is God."

NoFapChristians,38g5wc,new_life55,3,Thu Jun 4 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"Except for blasphemy, sin is not ""greater"" than other sin.

Be careful not to build a hierarchy of sin that doesn't exist in Gods eyes."
NoFapChristians,38g5wc,hopefulwife,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"I believe you're right in one sense, HW, and your radar is as always spot on. Sometimes we who struggle with these additive and habitual behaviors tend to rank things and make flimsy excuses based on all-too human (fleshly) rankings that in God's sight are just that: excuses.  However, some sins are greater than others--the testimony of the word makes that clear: John 19, ""he who handed you over to me is guilty of the greater sin.""   And don't forget the parable of the servant who is flogged with ""many stripes"" vs. the one who only receives a few. And there is the Old Testament law which increases penalties for sins that are more serious, or that have more consequences. Even in the NT, Hebrews 12 makes it clear that sins in the new covenant are ""worse"" than those in the Old, because we have greater revelation of who Jesus really is. That' sobering, if you ask me. check it out.  Speaking of flimsy excuses, I've also heard guys saying, ""Well, since all sin is the same, then looking with lust at a woman is no worse than actually committing adultery in the physical reality/body."" But the truth is that actual adultery is worse than just looking with lust.  Both are adultery. God hates both. Both are damnable. Both are wicked. Both can send you to hell if unconfessed. But still, we should try to limit the seriousness of our sin when and where possible.  Honestly I don't know how to reconcile both of these things, but I can't deny that there is a kind of economy of sins that the Scripture lists. I need to avoid all of it, but the fact of the matter is that some sins are worse than others and I do well to stay in the kiddie pool if I can, rather than wander out in to the deep end of sin.  My 2cents anyhow.  With great hope in Christ,  bA."

But when it comes to the eternal devastation- separation from God- there is no hierarchy. Creating that hierarchy  and letting the earthly consequences color our understanding of sin rather than how God sees it leads believer's having feelings of superiority based on which sin they do or don't commit.

NoFapChristians,38bl4b,alphawolfpup,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, very true! We tend to believe the lies that temptation tells us time and time again. We always think, ""This will satisfy me!"", yet day in and day out we are never satisfied, yet continue to believe the lie.  If we look to some created things to give us the meaning, hope, and happiness that only God himself can give, it will eventually fail to deliver and break our hearts.  Only God can satisfy us.  Only He is perfect and will never disappoint us or fail to live up to our expectations.  We need to find our acceptance, hope, value, purpose and satisfaction in Him and Him alone.  Something becomes a counterfeit God when you seek what only He can provide in something other than Him.  Also, we tend to focus on the things we can't have instead of the many other things we do and can have.   Living godly lives isn't just about suppressing the wrong desires, but more so about arousing the right one's."

I have a question: The longer I am on my journey, with the help of Christ, I have seen my ability to fight pmo continue to grow. I believe that I WILL be able to be free from porn. However, will my desire change? I am hoping/praying for more than just never watching porn again; I want to kill the DESIRE to watch porn. I sort of feel like someone who only eats his vegetables to be healthy; not because he LIKES the taste of veggies.   I do not watch porn because I know that it is not God's plan for me.

I'm happy to fight this battle together, and am learning in my struggle against sin that sometimes I can get on a rant or diatribe that's not really from the Lord, and appreciate two things: a) being able to gently express my disagreements (or passionately, as the case may be); and b) humbly being able to hold my tongue and keep my peace, remembering that it is my critical spirit that feeds and fuels my sinful lust so many times.  As for the ""fabulous"" diatribes you speak of, (i.e., those which are mere fables), I couldn't agree more. Love to discuss further in some other context if that seems helpful.

Catholics don't see protestants as non-Christian. They ratify baptisms that protestants perform. The holy spirit ratified my baptism at a local non-denominational church. What the spirit testifies is authority. What the Church does say is that there are concentric circles if you will, ripples so to say, emanating from the center of the church. The further away you are from that center, the less effect you have of ... i actually can't remember! but my priest explained that it's like that with protestants and Catholics."

I am not sure if you enjoy your anonymnity but you mentioned your name in this post...if you realized then cool, if you didn't then you can go ahead and hide it.  The key with any church is to read and know your scripture.  With all churches there are things that are done which are from man...we all as Christians need to focus on Christ's love letter to us...His word.  The Holy Spirit will help with the understanding, but definitely read that for yourself.  Really great post and inspiring to me.  The Lord is with you then who can be against you?  Isn't it interesting with the media?  I was trying to articulate this to my wife that we all have free will, free to accept grace and be saved, and free to be with the world and be damned.  I'm not mad at Bruce/Caitlyn but the media seems to be poised to jump on anyone that doesn't praise Bruce for becoming a woman!  this is up being down, and a complete degredation of society. The bible talks about this though.  2 Timothy 4:3-4King James Version (KJV)  3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;  4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.  The Word is never wrong. :)  Peace be with you brother."

It's been helpful to accept what comes by pulling back from PMO and doign NOFAP, to feel whatever comes without breaking. and to start going to God for life instead of taking the pain and trying to kill myself with PMO."

NoFapChristians,386x7j,haohaoredditor,3,Tue Jun 2 07:51:39 2015 UTC,"I too have wondered about miraculous healing of this sin but I have not heard anyone truly having received it.  The prime example that comes to mind, are the miraculous healings that occur during conversions, such as alcohol abuse.  There are several people who I know first hand who were instantly healed and all desire to drink was taken away from them.  However, this does not always happen, and for some who come to know the Lord, they are not healed but are left with a lifetime of gradual sanctification.  Puritan John Owen wrote on these things in his classic, On the Mortification of Sin.  It's  a heavy quote but here goes:   He does not so work our mortification in us as not to keep it still an act of our obedience. The Holy Ghost works in us and upon us, as we are fit to be wrought in and upon; that is, so as to preserve our own liberty and free obedience. He works upon our understandings, wills, consciences, and affections, agreeably to their own natures; he works in us and with us, not against us or without us; so that his assistance is an encouragement as to the facilitating of the work, and no occasion of neglect as to the work itself. And indeed, I might here bewail the endless, foolish labor of poor souls, who, being convinced of sin and not able to stand against the power of their convictions, do set themselves, by innumerable perplexing ways and duties, to keep down sin, but, being strangers to the Spirit of God, all in vain. They combat without victory, have war without peace, and are in slavery all their days. They spend their strength for that which is not bread and their labor for that which profits not.   Tim Challies also summarizes this concept here:http://www.challies.com/reading-classics-together/you-need-the-power-of-the-holy-spirit  The idea, and I have a hard time understanding this, is that if God were to instantly cure you of this, that would be glorification (which will come brother!).  But he has chosen sanctification, the process of becoming holy, as our journey in this life.  By battling these sins, with the power of the Holy Spirit, we are learning everlasting lessons which will remain with us for all eternity."
NoFapChristians,386x7j,Corinthians1013,2,Tue Jun 2 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"""Process.""  That's the key word for me. I think the OP's desire to be instantly healed (and we all feel that) forgets that this ""disease"" or sin-sickness is not only the work of the flesh, the world, and the devil, but it is the work of God in our lives. Not that HE is the author of sin--far be it. But He certainly allows this into our lives like St. Paul's thorn in order to enable us to learn the joys of creaturely dependence.  ""When I am weak, then He is strong."" That's why the Apostle went on to say ""I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses.""  There's something to our sanctification journey that says, ""Thank you God"" for even these inward struggles and temptations. God doesn't tempt, but He certainly is sovereign over all temptation and uses them for His glory and our good.  with great hope in Christ,  BA."
NoFapChristians,386x7j,Blueaugustine,2,Tue Jun 2 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"I hear where your coming from.  All the pollution the PMO has brought in (pervasion of sex, degradation of women, pride and fantasy, images the devil uses against me) linger in my head.  I too wish it would all go away, but we can praise God this it is going away, it just may take time.  As Christians, we are freed from the power of sin, so we do not have to go on sinning anymore.  Rejoice in that! You don't have to live in shame another day.  It is only the sin in us that still lingers that elicits itself in sinful acts, but it is a still a choice.  As mentioned, there is justification when we place our faith in Christ, sanctification (or mortification of sin) as we live on this earth, and then glorification after death.  We will not be perfect here, but do not be discouraged, we are free from the power of sin.  We can willfully and joyfully choose to trust in Gods promises instead of succumb to PMO.  My thoughts are a bit scattered here as well"
NoFapChristians,386x7j,new_life55,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"While I do believe miraculous healing does happen, God has a pattern He seems to prefer to work with.  When He created everything, he could have just poofed it into existence.  He could have just saved Joseph when his brothers threw him in a hole, He could have just given Abraham a son right away.  But God appears to prefer to work in two ways: He works through a process, and he prefers the long shots.  Some times when things are looking at their worst is when God comes to show us that nothing is impossible through him."
NoFapChristians,386x7j,HurtingFather,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:51:55 2015 UTC,"well. i can say that i have been healed instantly. and i have also been healed gradually.   the effects of childhood trauma and of a history of unthinking evil decisions God healed instantly after I was baptized. God is amazing, and i couldn't have made good choices without him having been so merciful and generous. the healing was spectacular. it's soemthing i've never read in psychiatric literature.   but i have also been healed gradually. idk what you mean by 'healed'. healed from what? i have a hunch you mean healed from addiction. well, addiction is a complex mess. there are attachment disorders, false beliefs, a history of bad choices, a love of badness instead of goodness, and demonic interference. there's more too i bet. but nearest i can say from where i am now (and i'm not always right about everything) is that God loves you and that God wants to help you make better decisions. you might see that eventually. it's there. he's right here in these words talking to you. i was going to type something else, but this is God. i'm not kidding.   i love you jerry."

NoFapChristians,386l76,Blueaugustine,2,Tue Jun 2 05:34:27 2015 UTC,"yes, themes are more important than goals, because themes dramatize the journey, rather than excite the destination. themes capture the overall and ultimate arc of one's story, rather than the realization of a simple goal or two. themes talk about HOW we reach that goal and other goals, rather than glorifying what goal we reach. Like, we have a goal of being wealthier. Are we trying to provide for ourselves and our brothers and sisters, or are we just becoming rich to look good? Are we stealing and cheating and lying to get rich, are we cutting our brothers and sisters down for an extra dollar, are we getting rich quick and die trying? or are we looking for what we need to live, and to give what we don't need to each other?   these are somethings i need to think about, too. i've really struggled with needing an image to survive, with needing to 'look successful' by having THAT career or THAT trenchcoat or THAT body or THAT girlfriend,etc. But God wants me to want him, and to be content with him providing for all the good things he has in store for me."

They can be as simple as ""Help me God!"". A quick ten second prayer to God is valuable and treasured by Him. Today, when you become worried about somebody or anxious about something, why not replace these thoughts with a simple prayer? Simple prayer of thanks  Dear God, We thank you for your goodness, your mercy and your grace. Help us to carry these wonderful gifts in our own hearts and lives. May we minster these to all the world.  Amen. Simple prayer before meal O Lord, Thank you for your goodness in our lives. Please bless this meal to our bodies.  Amen.  Simple prayer for meeting  Dear Lord, We thank you for fellowship and friendships. Bless our time together that we may reflect your truth in our lives, and carry your love in our hearts.  Amen.

Behavior modification can bring temporary change, but attacking the root of our sin (lust, but maybe its actually pride, escapism, anger, desire for control that is grown out in PMO) through the Holy Spirit is what brings about lasting change.  This past week, I began each day by reading a section of scripture along with a commentary, then reading through Tim Chester's Closing the Window (I highly recommend).  Then, that's when I sit down and spend time praying.  I have never been a big prayer, but recently a sermon brought to my attention that it is quite an honor that we are able to speak with God as Sons and daughters! (In the OT, it was a lot different.  With the Holy Spirit and Jesus, we can enter directly into His presence, and His in us).  I pray about PMO, in complete sentences in my head, but I also pray about other things.  Lastly, I watch a worship song or 2 and praise God! All I have is Christ and 10,000 reasons have been my favorites this week)"

Let me say first of all I'll be praying you hit'em straight and long as you work to make it as a pro. May Godspeed be with you.  I'm reading about a dude who feels lonely and isolated and like you're fighting a losing battle almost. But think about it in golf terms. If you're down by a few strokes at the turn, you don't quit just because all hope is lost. How many guys have thrown away their hopes for a win on even the last hole? We can't take anything for granted. Even if you finish last after the first day of a tourney, you'll discover that the leaders after day one are rarely the leaders after the second or third day.   Another golf analogy (sorry if this isn't helpful) is that you've got to play your game, not someone else's. You're coming up to a hard hole and you look and see he's hitting a fairway wood, and you want to lay up with a five iron, what's the explanation? you have to play the hole the way you're called to do so, not the way someone else is called to so so.  Anyhow, I also want to encourage you that reading the Bible and focusing on god is the way we're all making it through one day at a time.

The most dangerous thing for any Christian is when they start to feel less guilt when they sin, because guilt shows that you are still fighting. When you don't feel as much guilt, you will continue to sin and eventually become indifferent to repeatedly committing the sin. It may just be that you know God still loves and accepts you, but if it's you not feeling as much guilt after committing the sin, I urge you to confess and repent with an earnest heart as soon as possible."

NoFapChristians,3848yw,fapstronaut85,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:38:23 2015 UTC,"no, don't hate yourself! That's not what I was saying. I was just saying to not get too comfortable with sinning. I'm not saying you were getting complacent, but it's a warning, because I went through this many times.   When I decided I would stop looking at pornography and masturbating to it, I was full of vigor and ready to fight my sin and lust. When I failed, it hurt me so badly, because I knew God gave me the power to stop, but I went against it anyways. I felt so guilty for sinning, because whenever His people sin, it makes God grieve and makes communication with him difficult. As you make know, once you fall, the lust haunts you and keeps on coming back. I kept falling and slowly my thoughts began to change from ""Oh God, I'm so sorry! I'm a dirty and unworthy soul, please forgive me!"" into ""Sorry God, I'll try harder next time"".   This would usually trap me into a long cycle of sinning until God gave me the power to wake up and snap out of it. That's why I was just warning you to take every failure as seriously as you can."

Your body is used to a certain hormone inducing stimuli and when you deprive it, it lashes out.

While I feel like I could be open with her about PMO, I don't know how she would handle it.  Girls I've dated in the past have been supportive of me and have to some extent held me accountable, but they have all been Christians.  I certainly don't need to risk this girl saying something along the lines of ""I don't see a problem with that, it's natural"" or something.  Otherwise, you're right.  I've said no to relationships with other non-Christians before, so why should this be any different?  And I guess a further thought is that she doesn't come from a Christian home.  From what she has told me of her parents, they seem anti-Christian to some extent.  She told me her mother is somehow an ordained minister through the Unitarian church and that she performs same-sex weddings.  Would I really want to enter into that environment as a boyfriend, where the decrees of my God are mocked and where there is hostility towards Christ?

My knowledge about God and Christianity is quite large ...  ... but shallow.  You see most of those years I was not walking the path that God put me on.  I was not keeping to the straight and narrow.  This is a whole other can of worms then knowing the path.

The rules and knowledge are helpful in keeping you from straying into deceptive emotional or sentimental snares that you mistake for your heart, but not much more.  Porn at this point truly disgusts me, not because I decided it was bad, or read it was bad, or figured out from the bible it was bad. I see the humanity and the abuse and suffering and simply can't stomach it anymore. All the arguments, though very compelling, caused me to live in duplicity, because it still thrilled me at some level.

This is a primary motivation to not PMO.Urges pass quockly,if we don't dwell or act on them,relapses take alot longer..About urges,dismissing them gives us the power to gain strength.We are tempted to sin all the time,  just consider some of the crazy ideas that visit you,right? The thing is,just cuz you see something in a store doesn't mean you have to take it...why?,first,it's a sin,second you might get caught and go to jail.Samething with an urge,you don't HAVE to obey it,if you do you will suffer,if you don't this is one more time to get stronger and gradually the urge will lose some of it's power...resist the Devil and he will flee...Take control in Jesus Name! Stay strong we can do this."
NoFapChristians,37zquv,trophenius,2,Sun May 31 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"That is the short term process that you are describing. The longer term process is that you grow more comfortable resisting stronger urges. Until after a little over a month you have conquered the strongest ones you will ever experience. They'll still come at you, but there is nothing new they are going to throw at you.   In truth the urge is a lie, it's trying to convince you it's unbearable, your body and mind start agreeing (you've always caved in the past so it must be so now). But the grace you have been given is, believe it or not, truly sufficient. You are not being tempted to the point of shedding your own blood despite what your mind and body tells you. So beyond what you already know from being here and what trophenius wrote I suggest 2 additional practical things:   Cold showers. It's a spiritual practice. It is the most awesome way to practice resisting your instant gratification mind and weak emotions. Because they will scream at you that death is imminent if you do not leap out. But it's just discomfort. And it's more discomfort than an PMO urge. So if you can stand in that cold shower you can withstand that PMO attack. Check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvmYINIXN5U Step into the present moment. Meaning tune out of that part of your mind that is trying to put a spin on your current situation. The spin that this moment is unbearable. Ask yourself ""what is really wrong with this moment right now"" and pay attention to your breathing your body the world around you. The physical discomfort in your groin perhaps that your mind is telling you is the size of a mount Everest about to crush you... how bad is it really? ... weight of a pebble perhaps? Often I torture myself with some amazing future sex that I just need to have right now.... but what is really so bad with right now... if i drop the idea of the future sex... if we live in the present instead of the future... and live in reality instead of in our heads... things are quite different. And this by the way is a key component of prayer and being closer to Christ. There is no point doing that with your 'mind' you have to do that with present awareness.   God speed brother"

I am happy for you that you are developing your 'super-powers' by medically induced procedures.What you are advocating probably has great merit.I guess my only issue is,what exactly has this to do with Christ-centered,masturbation-free,living as we try to encourage amongst each other here?Please,don't get me wrong,sir.I am in no way attempting to discourage you in your 'new arrangement' and your medical procedures,perhaps I would just like full disclosure in whether you are advocating for pornfree,soft-mode,as you seem to be?Most of us here primarily feel the Bible encourages us to live lives w/o lustful thoughts and any form of self-induced orgasms,with  anyone except our spouses,hence most of us here,as opposed to pornfree and NoFap,are on hard-mode.  I am also a member of pornfree here on reddit and feel it's encouragement towards a pornfree lifestyle is excellent,however,as folks over there will fully agree...masturbation w/o porn is totally advocated by many.(I know,I used to be in that camp myself.)  Regardless,I am happy that your patches are enhancing your 'super-powers- but I am a bit hesitant  about your sharing of your relationship and 'new arrangement' that,do to your increased testorone,causes you to seek release so you can both 'stay pure'...not sure how this would apply to NoFapChristian,as we generally agree that the practice of fapping is not what we would consider 'staying pure'Perhaps your chemically induced boost in testosterone is causing you to be a bit overly sexually charged?  If I have,in any way offended you or the mods or any one on this sub by my concerns,I heartily apologize,thankyou:)  ..... My best to you in Christian charity, trophenius"

NoFapChristians,380q8k,Blueaugustine,2,Mon Jun 1 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"yeah seems like there is a major dividing line between those who see masturbation as a violation of the seventh commandment and those who do not. I also distinguish as I've said elsewhere between mutual ""masturbation"" between couples in marriage for various reasons--and all the other stuff. I find it somewhat disheartening to think that if I just m to my thoughts of a gf or a wife I'm good. But what's missing there is the fact that sex is fundamentally (in Scripture) a communal event. It involves persons (two) not just a person (one).   ok call me crazy or lame for this example, definitely not intended to be blasphemous:  Can you imagine God the Father celebrating His glory by himself, without the Son and the Spirit in agreement? That's intimacy, that's community, that's fellowship.   I think guys who M to their thoughts sans P are classic evangelicals: they keep the letter of the law but miss the spirit. Self sex is the thing that's prohibited: manually and in isolation from other people making an orgasm happen is basically antithetical to the real design of the THING.  Shullamite woman said, ""do not awaken love till it is time."" That doesn't sound like she can M until she finds Solomon. She's abstinent. She's patient. She's waiting.

Otherwise if say, your smart phone is triggering you, or laying in the bed too long is making your mind wonder, you MUST leave that area, drop the phone, and literally plague your mind with practical thoughts of Christ, and even daily life. Get moving, put a fav worshing song, pray/meditate(of course), talk to someone, go workout, play a video game, etc. Obviously some of those things listed are purely distractions, but you must learn to retrain your mind on what to do in moments of trigger. I dont call them moments of weakness, because God has already made you strong; strong enough to come here and seek His holiness in this area to begin with.

Yet, in the divine mystery of the Trinity, I think there is some grace to married people that actually allows them to get over some rough spaces in life through the instrumentality of physical sex.

I am held back from most ministry outside the home, my kids go to Sunday school but I 'must let them make up their own minds.'

I'm pretty geeky and stuff. Anyhow, I've had a couple girlfriends in the past but nothing serious. My heart ended up getting broke a lot and I just get lonely a lot. During that loneliness/stress I'd turn to PMO to help me relax but soon after I'd feel shameful and gross. I'd then feel lonelier so I'd turn to more PMO and thus continuing the cycle.

NoFapChristians,37v7ts,HurtingFather,1 point,Sat May 30 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"HF, this isn't just for you, or even necessarily for you, but my thought is prompted by your reply. I know that ""purity"" is spoiled by porn, while ""virginity"" is technically only spoiled by intercourse--and that's an important distinction.  However, my focus in thinking about Psalm 119 (above) was that purity comes from being obedient and holy and passionate about Christ in all areas of life--not just areas of sexual purity.  In other words, the problem with PMO is a lack of Holy Spirit purity. I read the other night about Grieving the Holy Spirit in Ephesians 5. Now sexual immorality is mentioned in the context, but so also are a number of other wicked things.  The Pure in Heart Shall See God, is how our Lord put it in the Sermon on the Mount. I want to see God and that means anything within me that is misaligned with Him has to go. [Psalm 139:23-24]  The reason this struggle is so hard is that it touches on our whole lives. It seems like other so-called ""addictions"" can be zeroed in on and addressed by way of removal without necessarily affecting or impacting the rest of life.  So the only preparation /u/jad_seven/ needs before marriage is the purity that enables him to see God.   I think this is an important distinction since, if it is logically true for people who struggle with PMO that the problem is not PMO, but something deeper, then preparation for marriage, while not ignoring PMO tendencies or compulsive behaviors, must not overly focus on those specific sins but press on to the ""weightier matters of the law"" as Jesus put it: love, mercy, etc. Don't stop tithing your spices, but as you do, don't neglect the ""greatest of these"" (1 Cor. 13:13)  Thanks for reading, thanks again /u/hopefulwife/ for posting.

Hours of mental battle and the temptation to just break down and masturbate so I can get some sleep. And I don't know what to do about that.

I believe the solution then, is to not only train yourself to maintain responsibility around these necessary devices, but to do so practically. Yes, Jesus said to the man ""...Sell all you own and follow me..."", but he most certainly never meant to rid us in our present time, of all we need to heal, survive, and communicate. We must learn to be desciples; disciplined Christ followers.   So I say to you then, instead of ridding yourself of your IPod, find a responsible time to use it. Seek God with this. Stop relying on your own understanding here. fill the iPod with Him if it helps. Worst case scenario, only use it(maybe give it to someone you trust extremely well) when there's accountability around.  Just some food for thought. I know I personally don't use my technology when I know I'll be weakest, but I haven't gotten completely rid of it. If I'm wrong in classifying your cas with such simple thoughts, please forgive me.   God bless!"

But that ""install"" takes time. Meanwhile, radical amputation really has to be the way for me. I think of it like an alcoholic not being able to go to parties where there is booze for a while until he isn't triggered or tempted when he does.  Having said that, your input is correct: we should be aiming to be responsible and faithful disciples of Jesus.  Which by the way is a good plug for Covenant Eyes: it doesn't block your computer, just watches/records it for you.  I've also found that targeted deletions and restrictions are the way to go.

There are some programs that can help like OpenDNS (https://www.opendns.com/). I hear Apple is one of the few companies with better parental control options. But since you mentioned that you are savvy when it comes to bypassing them. Perhaps it is better for you to simply rely more on practical methods.  Getting rid of your phone is a bit of an extreme option. But I guess you have to decide if the disadvantages outweigh the benefits of having one.   For me personally, I not only get tempted at night to look at porn, but just to waste time in general by watching Youtube videos or Anime when I should be sleeping. Before I go to bed I just drop my phone off in my parents room which even in my most desperate of moments I would not dare to enter to get my phone back during the night.   So you just have to brainstorm ways and ask help from God of how to avoid your phone. And eventually, as you mature in your faith, even with full access to porn you will find that you don't have a desire for it anymore. And you won't need to rely on workarounds so much anymore."

As for trashing the phone, I haven't found any blocking programs for the phone to be helpful, though I think others have.  Here's what has worked for me: I have turned on the parental controls.   One reason I love the iPhone is that you can use it with having the following restrictions: no internet access; only apps on the phone that are ""approved,"" no access to app store, no access to face time, no access to iTunes store, or iBooks or basically any area of the phone that could pose a threat.

NoFapChristians,37tqhb,ciejer,5,Sat May 30 08:53:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, so first thing's first:  Welcome.  Alright, so I actually dealt with some of this myself some years ago, and it was difficult.  For me the answer was a vasectomy, but that isn't for everyone.  Alright, so I see a few things to bring up here, things that might help you out.   Because of this, I find myself often in a cycle of 'relieving tension' as if it was a good thing, so I wouldn't hurt her.   One of the things to be aware of is that you will feel tension as you go through this, so you need to decide what you are going to do with that.  Find something you devote yourself to in those time.  As a father of two my kids are one of those things, but you need to find something to do with that tension that works for you.  There is no easy or ""absolutely correct"" answer for this, just what works for you.     My wife's libido has been lowered significantly by her current birth control   Don't write this off so easily, one of the ways we communicate love is through intimate physical contact.  I would suggest reading the ""Five Love Languages"" for more information on this if you are interested, so you can also find your wife's love languages.  One of the things you can do as you work on this is find a way to become even closer to your wife, and finding out how she perceives love is a good way to start with that.  Part of my journey in this was to go through a book called ""The Love Dare,"" to teach myself how to express love better  (speaking of which I need to go read today's).  This will give you little snippets of wisdom and things to do for your beloved every day."

I'm sorry to hear that your wife doesn't share your faith and hasn't been supportive in this area. Good for you to confessing to her though! Even though she isn't concerned, it is still sin against her and I'm so happy that you confessed to her.   Have you guys ever been to counseling about this?  When your sexual life is out of whack, it really does affect EVERY thing. My husband came into our marriage with his addiction and once it was out in the open and we started communicating more, it was like we had put glasses on - we realized how much of our marriage had been affected by this. But, we hadn't been as concerned as we probably should have been because we didn't know it could be any other way.   As for the pushiness, just communicate with each other what an acceptable level of average frequency is. If you both have the right expectations, working on your self control becomes much easier. 1st Corinthians 7:4. ""The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife.""

I've also noticed both the busy=no temptation thing AND the on holiday=intense temptation, even without any obvious triggers.   I wonder if the novelty of being on holiday triggers lots of novelty dopamine- we feel good because of the adventure and excitement of doing something good, enjoying good friends, new things, beautiful scenery - all good things that bring Glory to God. But because these things release dopamine, it subconsciously triggers the association with PMO which does the same. And that's why these times can be particularly hard with temptation.

To make this practical you must make a commitment (to Christ and to yourself) to never watch porn again (SERIOUSLY this time).   The only sexual outlet is with your wife.  Some may disagree with this next advice but I'm going to say it. Only masturbate as a LAST resort if for whatever reason you're unable to have time with your wife. But absolutely no porn and absolutely no fantasizing. I think this is in keeping with Christs command to not look on a woman to lust.  This is only when you can't have intimate time with your wife and are so 'full' of sexual energy and have no outlet.  The best of course is to abstain from masturbation completely.

You don't follow your heart, you master it, you lead it.    You might not feel him, but he is right in that room with you, watching what you are doing right now.  THis isn't some ""ha, I can see what you are doing"" kind of thing either.  He just refuses to let you walk this path alone.    I have a recommendation for you and for anyone feeling this right now: talk to God about it.  Don't pray or anything so formal just ... talk to him.  He's already there, you don't have to summon Him.  And ... he probably won't answer you right away, so you have to pay attention.  But at some point when talking to him you will have a thought, it might not be the first time, or the first 10 times you talk to him, but at some point you will hear a thought in your head that you will realize didn't come from you, it came from Him.  God let's us have these times when he feels separate from us for the same reason our parents sometimes backed away while we were learning to walk.  It's the only way for you to get the perseverance you need to grow."

Most of the time I find when I hear someone (or even myself) say something like ""I don't feel God right now"" it typically means one of two things:   They aren't taking time for God to talk to them. They aren't paying attention when he does.   That second one is harder to deal with as it's hard to describe what it's like when God is there with you.  It's just something that when you feel it, you know, or sometimes you look back and go ""Oh, God was there with me..."""
NoFapChristians,37sz7h,garlotch,2,Sat May 30 03:33:38 2015 UTC,"phew, my advice to you is:   Psalm 1  1Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, 2but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. 3That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers.  In this struggle, which i and all the brothers here are fighting with, we will get to the point of getting stronger and stronger to resist. I know how you feel at this moment, feeling like you cannot resist.  Like in my case 11 days ago i relapsed after standing strong for 45 days straight by a stupid email from tumblr porn (wicked trap of satan ugh...).  What kept me strong all those days and if not for that stupid e-mail, more days?  Meditation, focus, singing and thinking about things of the Lord. Discussions in my heart about the word of God. rebuking every wicked tought which is not of God when they come in my heart. In other words ""don't allow your heart to be free"". Remain connected to God else you ""might"" see wicked things coming in, either lustful or hateful. And even if it happens, pray pray pray.   So start reading bible, bit by bit, and meditate on it, so that you may grow and remain connected in heart/mind. By doing all these things i found my own character started to develop. In the same way, the other brothers are growing stronger trough their struggles/focus.  Here another verse to confirm my point (one of my favorites) 2 peter 1 vers 3-11 Confirm Your Calling and Election  3His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, 4by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. 5For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, 6and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, 7and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. 8""For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ"". 9For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. 10Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, ""for if you practice these qualities you will never fall"". 11For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  This verse, speaking about how we escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire (vers 4) This is what we aim at or want to achieve by our characters developed, it takes time. it requires knowledge, self control and the other things those verses speak about.    Also make sure to have an accountability partner, someone who you can trust and talk to at any time. that is really helpful  I hope this helps!"

NoFapChristians,37sz7h,denkel,2,Mon Jun 1 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"If anyone would ask me which books to read, i would always give the same advice. Start with the book of Luke. This book is about the life of Jesus Christ, from his birth on earth, till his death and resurrection. From this we can understand why he came, what he did, what he promised and the hope He has given us all.  After that i advice to read the book of Acts (they also call this the 2nd book of Luke). From here you can see the mission of the Holy Ghost trough the apostles and the struggle they faced against those have the law of moses and for the gentiles who are under the Grace and law of Christ. And how paul was called and became the preacher of the new covenant.  These 2 i strongly advice to read first.  After that i advice the book of Hebrew.It adds up wonderfully from acts in my opinion.  And concerning A.P. if im right people can also become ap from this site or a relative you know or friend..  Good luck"

Letting people into my story involves relational risk. And Learning to trust takes work. I almost didn't take this ministry on years ago for fear what ""some people might think"". I have many episodes up and it's only through Jesus Christ do I boast. Not, shallow behavior modification, not through me being a great guy or ""Holy religious person"". I am the misfit of misfits I am a brokenmess of the broken. I'm welcoming you into my story and that's a vulnerable place for me. I put it out there publicly. I'm sorry you see it as self promotion but I'm really trying to affect the world with the ripple effect of my story. And as all of us here work out our compulsion we will affect the people around us with each of our intimate our stories. I'm in no way some hot shot or guru just another equal brother walking the path of faith and grace and our Savior. I get that it's the risk I take spilling my guts in the podcast. I point Back to the podcast because there's a lot more to say there from this perspective, from my story. I've started this ministry because of the freedom I've experienced and wanting to help others. I've experienced the devastation, sex addiction or compulsive sexual behavior infects, corrupts, and shatters trust. It destroys relationships, families, and lives. Talking about the difference between a deep impactful relationship with Jesus Christ and cold religion is a challenging one. I know some people are going to criticize me for being a self promoter but it's scary position of every artist who put their work out there in order to make a difference isn't it?"

NoFapChristians,37pzki,widge_t,2,Fri May 29 14:09:05 2015 UTC,"One of the things they teach in some forms of recovery is that you must find something to replace the old habits with.  Pick something you've always meant to do, and just go do that thing.  Don't wait, don't put it off, just find something to replace both that idle time and your PMO habit with.  My relapse into looking at porn that my current counter is set at was because of that exact reason.  I was idly browsing Imgur and a gif came up that wasn't even all that bad, but it was from a porno.  When looking at the comments I found the source and, without thinking, clicked.  For me I got back out without doing anything, but it was a close thing.  Now I know I can't just sit on my computer at night to waste time, I have to find something else to do with it."

My advice to you is:  ""If you truly regret having sex with the girl of your own friend. Then hold a meeting with the 3 of you before going to camp and you both should confess to him and explain how it all happened, apologise to him, ask him for forgiveness and pray together asking God for forgiveness, help and guidance.""  You are gonna work on a Christian camp. You are gonna do this because of faith i presume?  Matthew 5 vers 23   23So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.  This.... Reconcile first with her boyfriend and altogether. So that you may go and work for God on that camp without having secrets (in your and her case) where Satan might use you two again or grudges (in his case)  I hope this helps!

As for resetting...if I as a married man kissed a woman (like you did) but then later repented would I need to reset? Answer: obviously yes.    I think it's silly to think that if a guy is ""single"" that he can mess around and it's okay, it's not adultery. It is obviously a violation of the seventh commandment.   Plus she has a boyfriend. You took advantage in so many ways.   Not only that, you admitted you did it for lust. Maybe you should post over on another sub where the only ""problem"" with PMO is that it is hindering your real life ability to ""get girls.""  I thought our goal was God's glory? That's why I think you should reset.    As for ""taking advantage,"" biblically you have a greater responsibility as a man to model Christ like leadership and courage around other sisters in Christ. Can you imagine Adam saying to God, ""why are you blaming me for the fall of Mankind? My wife did it too. We are both equally at fault.""   But here's what God said: [Romans 5:19]   If you want to take this seriously do what I suggest. And while we are at it, call her father. Make an appointment. Invite her pastor and the camp director. Sit down and confess what you did to real men. Let them know why you are so insecure in your faith and that you need a Dad in your life to help you learn what it means to be a Christian man. Put yourself at their mercy. Then you can say you are ""doing your best"" to take this seriously.    If you do this (or something like this), I guarantee you'll start growing in your faith again.

So what did you learn?  You learned that having your phone by the bed is too much of a temptation.  You learned that this is still something you are struggling with.

NoFapChristians,37kkmq,Goku-Doesnt-Fap,2,Thu May 28 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with hurtingfather, that the analogy does not hold up. Crack addiction leads people to murder in order to get their drug; other, just as real addictions - alcohol, shoplifting, nicotine, pot, pills, etc., etc. - do not.  The thing with porn addiction is this: people can and do hold off from fapping, but if they keep going back to it again and again, no matter how often they swear off, they should ask themselves if they are ""really addicted"".

The biggest problem with your argument is that you are making the case that anyone who wouldn't kill or otherwise cause the death of their mother in order to get to their addiction is not ""really"" addicted.  Not only does this exclude a whole lot of people from the label of ""addicted"" it also grossly shows a lack of understanding about what addiction is.  Anytime you habitually do something that you know to be harmful, you are acting out an addiction.  Shoot, that guy who can't start their day without coffee is addicted, and there is no way that they would kill their mom over it.  If you chose to spend time on the computer rather than spend time with your kids, and this happens regularly enough for it to be negatively impacting your life, then you are addicted to the computer.  It doesn't take a large choice like that to show where addiction is, it only takes habit and harm."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,1 point,Thu May 28 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"He is merely pointing out that it is a choice more than an impulse.

NoFapChristians,37kkmq,HurtingFather,0,Thu May 28 15:50:55 2015 UTC,"But that isn't what was actually stated, and the point about killing someone's mother doesn't make that point either.

NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,2,Thu May 28 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"It may have been a bit verbose, but that is what he stated. Addiction is a physiological or psychological need that reduces you to animal instincts. Heroin addicts would do anything to get more, even violence against their own family. Many other things are labeled as addictions that are not. American culture tries to teach that no one is responsible for their own actions. We dont need to fap, we simply desire it. The question is what do we desire more? Addicts cannot make that decision, it is made for them."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,HurtingFather,1 point,Thu May 28 18:38:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, let’s break this down:   But the question is not, ""Are you addicted?"" A better question is, ""Are you really addicted?""   Okay, now this isn’t supported anywhere.  He says this is a better question, but doesn’t actually say why.  So as far as I’m concerned we can take this part of the argument out as it has no support and doesn’t go anywhere.   You mentioned a crack addict.   No I didn’t, and neither did anyone else, but continue…   If a person who is addicted to crack or crystal meth were threatened with the death of his or her mother if he or she took another hit of their hard drug of choice, a true addict would care nothing for the life of their mother and would smoke or inject.   This is factually untrue and is one of the reason’s I labeled this a strawman fallacy.  This shows a gross misunderstanding of what addition means.   But most, if not all, porn users or masturbation participants would not look at that scene or undo his or her pants if it meant saving the life of his or her mother.    Because this is argued from a false premise and a false understanding this sentence means nothing in this context.   So if you were not addicted to porn/fap in that very moment, that begs the question....""Are you really addicted?""   Again, this is not what addiction is.    Alright, so you stated that there is a difference between psychological and physical addiction, and you are right, but this post doesn’t show that, it only shows a lack of understanding for what addiction means.  It also doesn’t go anywhere other than to say that unless you would kill your mom you aren’t “really” addicted.  Which is ludicrous.  Would a nicotine addict kill their mom for another cigarette?  And again, that statement about heroin addicts doesn’t actually describe heroin addicts, it only describes some of them.  So are the rest not “really” addicts even though they have destroyed their lives with that drug?  The funny part is that you stand up for individual choice and freewill in one part of your defense here, but then immediately state that addicts cannot choose.  And again I ask, what is the purpose here?  What does this contribute to the over-all message here?  “You guys aren’t really addicts, so just get over it?”  That is not only insensitive, it’s harmful.  It’s also untrue, as I’ve already pointed out."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,2,Thu May 28 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"The funny part is that you stand up for individual choice and freewill in one part of your defense here, but then immediately state that addicts cannot choose.   That is exactly my point. Addiction is the inability to make decisions. There may be remorse or regret, but there is no free will to change.   And again I ask, what is the purpose here? What does this contribute to the over-all message here? “You guys aren’t really addicts, so just get over it?” That is not only insensitive, it’s harmful. It’s also untrue, as I’ve already pointed out.   The point is that there are different levels of sin, desire and addiction. If we do not take responsibility for our willing complicity in sin, we will never have victory over it. Masturbation is not an addiction, it is a strong desire. Piper made the point that if you offered a pornography ""addict"" a million dollars to never fap again, they would find a way to quit. A heroin addict cannot make that same decision without intervention."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,HurtingFather,2,Thu May 28 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"That's a misunderstanding of what addiction is.  Being addicted to something doesn't mean you somehow lose free will.  So, as the definition of addiction seems to be a sticking point:  Without looking at a dictionary, what does addiction mean to you?"
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,2,Thu May 28 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"Addiction is an acquired need for something that is not actually a need, without concern for the consequences."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,HurtingFather,0,Thu May 28 23:16:07 2015 UTC,So you would consider nicotine not an addictive substance?  Or what about caffeine?  If someone with high blood pressure drinks a carafe of coffee every day are they addicted or no?
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,2,Thu May 28 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"If you needed to, you could quit caffeine fairly easily. Nicotine is harder. It is a physical need your body has, but I have never struggled with it personally. What I do know is that everyone I know that has quit permanently, has done so cold turkey after coming to grips with the necessity of it. After recognizing it as an idol, or developing cancer, emphysema, etc. People who switch to the patch or cut back do not want or feel the necessity to quit. Many people with physical ailments due to tobacco use would rather die of cancer than give up smoking. This is addiction. They are irrationally compelled by their desire for the thing. They do not want to put in the hard work of repentance and accountability."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,DDave1239,2,Fri May 29 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I go with HurtingFather... Masturbation can be an addiction, like alcohol and any others. ""Addiction is a state characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences."" Wikipedia Masturbation stimulats and has got negative consequences. There is only one question: ""Are you addicted?"" I had always the feeling, if I want to stop, I can stop and live PMO-free. One time, a guy invite to stay clean for a month and I thought, hej, I can stop, so try it and I will stay clean. After 2 days I had my first relapse and there were many in the following 4 weeks. This was the point, where I found out, that I am addicted, with a very easy question(""Can you stay clean for a month without any problems?""). I´m now clean for 29 days, the best thing would be, if I am not addicted after that, but who knows...  So in general, addiction starts much earlier, ""before you shout your family""(, because that is a very extreme example). To the million dollar thing: When do you want to give him the million dollars for never fap again? In the best case, if he has proven, that he didnt fap again, so it would be 3 hours before his death. Then he wouldn´t care about your million dollar, because he could satisfy his addiction for years instead of a million dollars. If you give it him earlier, he could fap and what do you do now? Take back the money, which he hasn´t got anymore? Also, he would think of the million dollar for a month/year, 10 years? After that the money is away and he wouldn´t care about his promise. In longterm he would relapse.  Also as long as the family is in danger, almost every addicted person would do everything, that they don´t get hurt, BUT if the danger is gone, then the addicted person will have a relapse. Therefore your family has been always in danger, that you fight against your addiction(as a heroin addicted person). As ""normal"" addicted person( to alcohol, fapping, smoking), where you can quit(, even if it is very hard and rough), you can try to quit without a danger for your family, which forces you to quit."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,2,Thu May 28 22:36:09 2015 UTC,"I had always the feeling, if I want to stop, I can stop and live PMO-free.   Did you actually want to be pmo free or did you just say you did? What did you do to actively work against it? Saying and even sometimes wanting to change is not doing the hard work of theological study and devotion, of seeking Christian accountability, of avoidance, etc. Addicts frequently regret their decisions, but they cannot change on their own. Most people simply love their sin (or pride) and do not want to confess and get the accountability they really need.  Your discussion about Piper's point makes no sense and completely misses the point, it is a hypothetical scenario."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,Teatimes55,2,Thu May 28 23:22:47 2015 UTC,"No human being wants anything 100% nor can decide to stay righteous from now on. This is why the apostle Paul wrote whole chapters about the deceitfulness of sin.  It is Rationalism, not Christianity, that says that people can decide to make decisions, and decisions that stick, once they decide what is their own best interest. Rationalism also says that if people still fap, it's because they didn't really, really, want it. The gospel says otherwise, and my experience certainly does."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,1 point,Fri May 29 00:59:42 2015 UTC,"Sin isnt deceitful, we are. Our flesh wants to tear us away from God. Paul makes it clear that we must chain ourselves to righteousness in order to counter this. We need to take responsibility for our sin and actually hate it enough to make changes. If we dont hate it, we pray to hate it. If we do, then we will actively take steps to overcome it. If you are not overcoming sin, you do not have the correct perspective of sin. Period. Everyone makes mistakes, but a life that hates sin will have victory over it. The only way to hate sin properly is by God's grace and love and also fear of God.  You can play the victim or you can get accountability and actively repent."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,DDave1239,1 point,Fri May 29 04:04:26 2015 UTC,"Stupid quote, but I don´t care. I wanted it and I did much but I need a long time to find the right tools(, like push ups as ""punishment"", respect yourself instead of No PMO, instead of never PMO just the next two weeks no pmo and after that again 2 weeks, and so on).  But in general, I read all the posts and shortcommings of logic, understanding and other things in your posts. Therefore I don´t see, why I should explain anything anymore.  In short: piper´s point is a kind of bullshit, because the definition of addiction is way to short and please notice the other points of HurtingFather. I think about this hypthetical scenario in longterm and for a million dollar many addicts(, I don´t difference here between ""real"" and ""unreal"" addicts after your/Pipers definition. For me, an addict person can be addicted to PMO, Alcohol, Nicotine, Drugs, like Heroin, and so on) would stop their addiction, but they WILL relapse, when they have got the money OR when they don´t think about the money anymore(, it doesn´t matter, if they got the money 2, 3, ten or maybe twenty years earlier OR if they get the money in the future, in 2, 3, ten or twenty years).  And it is harmful to tell an addicted person, ""hej, would you do that, letting your mother get killed for your addiction?"" ""No, why?"" ""Then it is no problem, you are not really addicted."" (Even it is a Strawman Fallacy). It is the same like to tell a suicidal person, that he will not commit suicide."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,TheRealCestus,2,Fri May 29 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"You simply do not understand the point. If the stakes are high enough, anyone can give up PMO. We just dont believe that it that bad of a sin, or we secretly love it more than we love God. We have no fear of God and no understanding of Scripture. So instead we make excuses.  No pushups(?) or punishment or guilt will ever deliver someone from sin. Only the love and grace of God will lead to true repentance."
NoFapChristians,37kkmq,Pericles808,1 point,Fri May 29 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think the original poster is out of line. John Piper stated basically the same thing: ""If tonight you are feeling totally in the sway of sexual desire — more blazing, more powerful than you have ever felt it in your life — and you believe that you cannot resist the temptation to look at some nudity online, and suddenly a black-hooded ISIS member drags your best friend or your spouse into the room with a knife at his or her throat, and says, “If you look at that website, I will slit their throat,” you will have the self-control you thought you didn’t have. You won’t click.""   Often when people think they are addicted, they believe the have no control over their actions, and that they aren't really held responsible for it because   ...well, they're addicted. Moving away from the idea that you're ""really"" addicted and moving towards the idea that you PMO because of sinful desire might be beneficial in realizing you DO have a choice."

NoFapChristians,37k7ny,chaos_walks,5,Thu May 28 07:16:27 2015 UTC,"This is actually a symptom of addiction.  One that is insidious and makes it hard to quit.  Think about what you just said, you basically said that in order to feel ""normal"" you must masterbate.  That is the same thing that a smoker says about their cigarettes.  A lot of the tension you are describing is because you PMO.  And your body starts craving the next fix, making you stress.  If you do decide to try and quit this will be a big issue, as you really will feel anxious when you don't do it.  But that's part of the proof that this is really an addiction.  Part of the reason that you see so many of the ""5 second"" type posts is because they recognize that the tension isn't really them, and acknowledging it is sometimes difficult."
NoFapChristians,37k7ny,HurtingFather,3,Thu May 28 14:50:37 2015 UTC,"I myself know exactly what you're talking about. Sometimes it's like you can't sleep with all the tension and once you get your release you're able to sleep, the same with going about your day, once it's done you're able to focus. As some have already said, it's just one of the deceptions of satan getting you to commit sin, and quite often when I get to such a situation as described, it's because I allowed my mind to linger a little longer on thoughts that I shouldn't, or I allowed myself to glance that extra second longer at something I shouldn't. After a while it builds up where there is tension that needs release. If you make a covenant with your eyes, and one with you mind not to linger on lustful things this urge should no longer arise as often."

I've had to recently face my errors in the way of looking at substitutes for pornography that are yet immoral. I think we're constantly at war with the flesh. Anything else is giving in and backsliding into the clutches of hell.  Of course, no one is perfect and we're all subject to the reality of sin. Romans 6:1-2 and Galatians 2:18 speak to me of not pursuing a course of sin, but stopping. 2 Peter 2:9 reassures that God can help deliver us from temptation. In the Lord's prayer we are shown by example to pray for this deliverance.  In the end, the guilt will overtake you. It will be a tsunami followed by a maelstrom and it will threaten to destroy you. If it hasn't yet, fine. Either way, use wisdom: quit now and work earnestly to do as Christ requests, if we love him, and ""keep his commandments"". (to not lust, not lie, etc.)"
NoFapChristians,37k7ny,vxlccm,1 point,Thu May 28 06:48:30 2015 UTC,"""...the tension I feel....my mind and heart ache...""  This is a heartfelt post and honest. It is also descriptive of an aspect of this struggle that doesn't get discussed as much.   The tension and heart ache that is mentioned in the OP is what's key here and what I most identify with.   Don't you think it is possible that ""tension"" is part of what God gives you as a way of helping you walk by faith in the midst of this fallen world?  I've met people before who abandon their Christian faith because it was ""too much work."" They believe mixing with worldly values and ideas and and people, thus giving up the battle, will finally relieve the tension they feel.   They even said ""I'm just being honest...""   But while denying the Son of God may be honest it is wrong. And unwise.   That's analogous to the tension mentioned by OP. Like faith in the Lord is difficult in this fallen world, it is the same with this PMO struggle. I believe tension is built into the system by the designer.   [John 16:33]  Reminds me of the blue and red pill scene in The Matrix. He wanted to believe the illusion so he went back to his eating steak even tho he knew it ""wasn't real.""

(Treated it as a competition ha ha).   But what I've learned is that PMO is sometimes (often!) a way for me to avoid pain. By willingly engaging in what is painful I am learning to train myself to do other even more painful things. Things in real life that actually matter. (Cold showers don't really matter.) things that are hard for me to do but important nonetheless for my purpose in life.   They also have a ""wake up"" effect. So often when I slip into the obsessive mode prior to PMO (which if u are unaware of you will never beat this thing), I begin to descend into a kind of moral-physical DAZE.  The shower seems to snap me out of that temporarily.   Finally St. Paul said ""I buffet my body...""  [1 Corinthians 9:25-27]   No one really knows what this means but clearly he's talking about Olympic sized athletic exertions, so I'm pretty sure it doesn't refer to talcum powder and cologne...I know that.   I believe it means I am called to take charge of the body's urges by exercising some level of either spiritual or physical leadership over myself, leadership that works itself out in the spiritual capacity to make hard decisions and choices.   This is one way or task or ""Herculean labor"" that has seemed to help others so I tried it for myself.   BA  Ps.

NoFapChristians,37h1qm,vxlccm,2,Wed May 27 22:20:09 2015 UTC,How is your wife taking this?
NoFapChristians,37h1qm,intensive_care,1 point,Wed May 27 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"HE thanks for asking. It really deserves a longer post and is part of my larger story. I will be posting more this week and next along these lines but for now I will say that it is going well.   We came together as a married couple on Pentecost Sunday celebrating the no PMO.   Also while we were abstaining from one another we tried to focus on non sexual intimacy:   1) daily prayer together 2) communication and working through some marriage issues and  3) reading a devotional together at least once a day.   As I said I will share more about her reaction later, but for now I can say this: Pentecost was beautiful. Before we came together I was able to tell her: ""I can honestly say that I have had absolutely 100% only thought of you this past month and there have been No others to occupy my mind but the Lord."""
NoFapChristians,37h1qm,intensive_care,2,Wed May 27 18:42:53 2015 UTC,Hmph. So 1 Corinthians 7:5 actually works?  Cool. :)
NoFapChristians,37h1qm,intensive_care,2,Wed May 27 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"I was going to mention this as well. Probably required to make it work is to have mutual consent. This was not a path ever taken in my marriage for more than a couple days. Psychology aside, I'm pretty sure God ordained sex between man and wife, so I don't view it as harmful, but then again, ANYTHING to break through to a non-relapsing state is worth it, so fight the fight."
NoFapChristians,37h1qm,intensive_care,1 point,Wed May 27 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for mentioning 1 Cor 7:5. To be honest it has never worked for me before now. Not sure what is different this time. I think the keys this time have been that   -we both totally agreed going into it. Also on the time frame.   -we added some positive exercises in the place of normal marriage intimacy.   -She knows I'm trying to have victory here through Christ.   -She knows it will benefit our marriage.   -And she knows deep down that it is a group problem.   That last one deserves a longer explanation and discussion but for now, I will simply say unequivocally that my problem with PMO is MY PROBLEM. Not hers.   Neither is my problem with PMO a matter of not being attracted to her. I am.   But the sin beneath the sin of PMO is a kind of intimacy disorder. And that makes PMO a symptom of a deeper more systemic problem as they say.   The whole family system is sick in some way (ways) and we need to discern together its non sexual roots and sources.   With great hope in Christ  BA"

NoFapChristians,37h1qm,ETERNALLYDAMP,2,Thu May 28 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"woohoo!  Let me jump all over this:  On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Bee  She had a history but she had no past  I have no idea how to interpret the second line, but the 'girl', also based on what comes after, appears to be a prostitute, jubilee street appears to be a strip.  When they shut her down the Russians moved in  Perhaps the ""russians moved in"" is a metaphor for the tougher crowd that replaced the original vice, or what the original vice was numbing.... like eh... a 'dry drunk' phase  Now I'm too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past  Scared of relapse cycle? Scared of that the addiction is escalating?   She used to say all those good people down on Jubilee Street. They ought to practice what they preach  Yeah they ought to practice just what they preach Those good people on Jubilee Street  ...several clients were hypocrites  And here I come up the hill, I'm pushing my wheel of love  I love this imagery... pushing something circular up a hill... carries with it the notion that it will self propel once you reach the top... the metaphor of the wheel: cycle of addiction  I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain  Love in my tummy = dopamine rush   tiny little pain = the minor discomfort in your groin when your fix is due  A 10 ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain  10 ton catastrophe = the weight of importance your mind gives to the tiny discomfort  60 pound chain = Dog leashes / chains typically have the maximum weight of the dog they can constrain specified. The chain is a metaphor for the ability of the mind to resist  And I'm pushing my wheel of love up Jubilee Street  Ah, look at me now  The problem was she had a little black book  Little black book is common metaphor for a prostitutes client book  And my name was written on every page  Well a girl's got to make ends meet even down on Jubilee Street  Some lame excuse that he visits her daily to help her make end meet  I was out of place and time and over the hill and out of my mind. On Jubilee Street  admission that he was ""over the hill"" and out of control  I ought to practice what I preach  regret / guilt  These days I go downtown in my tie and tails  no longer a self indulgent slob?  I got a foetus on a leash  leash / chain metaphor returns. This line could have been ""penis on a leash"" but that is to crass even for Nick Cave also the reference to foetus refers to procreative function of sex. ""He has reigned in his disordered procreative behavior""  I am alone now I am beyond recriminations  no longer seeking illicit company on the strip  Curtains are shut Furniture has gone  voyeurism has ended, mind is cleared up  I'm transforming I'm vibrating I'm glowing I'm flying Look at me now I'm flying  super powers  :D  EDIT: trying to attain formatting perfection"

I'm just really curious as to your reasoning behind it because (assuming you're Christian) I do not at least know of any particular thing against it.

NoFapChristians,37ivpm,Nacke,5,Wed May 27 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"This isn't rejection, so don't treat it like such.  However it does sound like she's a bit of a flirt (which isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing) which you should be aware of.  Give her a little bit of time, and if she's interested, or even wants to continue as friends she'll either make a move to check on you, or at least be receptive when you do.  However, you should also guard your heart here.  You've fallen for her a bit, just from your description, and if she really was just flirting without intent, then it's going to hurt when she doesn't reciprocate.  Just don't let that be an excuse to start ""using"" again.  Whether or not she likes you doesn't change whether or not you are someone likeable.  If not her, there will be others.  Just   DO  NOT  PMO"
NoFapChristians,37ivpm,HurtingFather,2,Wed May 27 23:28:16 2015 UTC,"Just don't let that be an excuse to start ""using"" again.   I am sorry but i didn't quite understand this part. What did you mean?   Also thanks for your response! Yeah it didn't feel like a full on rejection. It wasn't the good old ""I dont want to ruin our friendship"" bullshit. What she said was that she couldn't decide yet because she had not thought about it.   So now what? She is joining a big event in my town starting in about a month. So i will be seeing her there. Even before i told her this yesterday, she had called me and asked if we could hang out a day in about two weeks. I guess i should be layed back and not talk to much about this? Go on as usual?   And no i wont let this put me back into PMO again."
NoFapChristians,37ivpm,HurtingFather,2,Thu May 28 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"I was using the drug analogy for PMO.  This feels like a downer, even if it really isn't, and that's often a trigger to pick up your addiction again.  Do not fall into that trap.  If you really like this girl than she deserves a man who has the discipline to see this through, not a boy who lets a little emotional turmoil upset his goals.  Now as for how to handle being with her after this, I can't help you too much.  I ended up marrying only my 4th girlfriend, and my first as an adult.  But don't push too hard, don't pressure her.  She knows how you feel, the next step is hers.  You just keep enjoying her presence and being a good friend.  If it develops from there, great.  If not, still good as you have a new friend.  Just remember to guard your heart and ...  DO   NOT  PMO"
NoFapChristians,37ivpm,HurtingFather,2,Thu May 28 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"haha love how you finish every comment. I wont use this as an excuse. I am planning on being slightly layed back but still let things go on as usual. I wont be bringing this up and feel sorry for myself even thought things really hurt right now.   I am going to be honest though. It really sucks possibly getting rejected again. I am 19 and have never had a girlfriend. And getting rejected instead of getting ""accepted"" over and over again really makes you think.   How do you guard your heart by the way? I know what it means but i dont know how i can control my feelings."
NoFapChristians,37ivpm,VerseBot,1 point,Thu May 28 14:47:43 2015 UTC,"This is actually an interesting bit of scripture, so I'm going to be getting a little theoretical here before handing out some advice.  [Jeremiah 17:9]   The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?   Now when I first read this verse it confused me a little bit.  If you read it in context it makes even less sense.  The passage starts with God condemning the Jews for their actions, then we get out of quotes and get something that sounds like it's from the author, asking God a question.  But if the heart is ""desperately wicked"" then why is God searching and examining it?  Now if we look back on that verse, into the original translation we find a few thing:  [Note: This is from this website.]   The word deceitful used here is related to the word used for Jacob, and also is sometimes translated as ""overreacher"" or ""supplanter"" like when talking about what Jacob did to Esau. The word translated into ""desperately wicked"" here isn't' translated that way anywhere else in the Bible.  It typically means sick, and sometimes is even translated here as such.     Now what does all this mean for you?  Basically we can't rely on our heart, our emotions, to guide us, we are supposed to guide them.  Some people say things like ""I can't help the way I feel"" but you can if you put your mind to it.  One of the biggest things you can do is control what you put into you, especially the media you consume, as this all goes into your emotional state.  So, when you find yourself getting sad, or having those thoughts about how bad things are you do something about it.  Prayer is good, but I actually recommend something a little bit ... different from what most Christians do here.  Don't stop and close your eyes and start with a ""Our Father, who art in heaven ...""  God is in that room with you.  Watching you struggle with this, wanting to be there for you.  Just talk to Him, tell Him how much this hurts and own up to it. Then you decide to move on from it.  Dwelling on an emotion doesn't help you get over it.  Your emotions are not your master, you are the master of your emotions.  Negative emotions aren't inherently evil or signs of weakness.  It's okay to feel sad, or to cry, or to be angry, but if you are a master of your emotions you won't let those things spurn you to inaction.    This is part of guarding your heart.  The other part is using your head and not letting yourself get caught up in what might have been, or what might happen.  A lot of what you guard your heart with is with your mind.  [Romans 12:2]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.   [Proverbs 4:23]   Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."

NoFapChristians,37ivpm,Blueaugustine,2,Wed May 27 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"my friend,you have one primary objective at this time.Christ-centered abstinence from PMO.Getting emotionally distraught right now in your first week is,to put it mildly,deadly.Your thinking and emotions are far from stabilized and you need to avoid the four great triggers at all costs.don't allow yourself to become too hungry,angry,lonely or tired..i would add also,don't fall in love,yet.i have a vast amount of experience with ladies from before Jesus saved me.i have been the victim several times of this very same behavior. several things come to mind among which are...she is very immature at this time and quite confused about what she wants...she is playing you like a cat with a mouse for who knows why,when this happened to me,i discovered she was trying to make another guy jealous using me as a patsy to get him back (which worked,btw,she got him and i got the shaft and a broken heart) ....she is just sadistic...or who knows what else? sorry for being cynical but ,like i say i have been on your end of this and know all these feminine tactics first hand.  do this,explain to here,you are working on major self-improvement right now which involves a self-imposed bachelor life-style for at least a month (90 days would be better).no need to go into details of why,etc.,just that you would be ok being friends w/o benefits but only at arm's length (abstinence DOES make the heart grow fonder)...this will either make her want you 100 times more,which would be nice or she will quickly tire of playing you and seek more amusing prey.meanwhile,you are learning how to stay free of PMO,which is imperative anyway before you can have a solid relationship and you are becoming stronger in Christ,which will allow HIM to send you the proper mate in HIS time.ya don' wanna get too dependent on a woman's wiles,they can be very confusing and painful. do the right thing...tell her you are only going to be available at a distance for awhile (if she really is interested in you more than herself,she will understand). pray hard,post  here on NFC frequently,get into the Word and form strategies for doing NoFap (cold showers,workouts,meditation,etc.) after all this you will  be truly worthy of a Godly woman and stronger  within yourself (work on YOU)...btw,the 'hard-core flirting' should be  a MAJOR red flag,okay?

But quite frankly I really am not interested in listening to a 30 minute sermon anyway. I hope that's not taken the wrong way.   My problem with the links I see is that sometimes they seem self serving (read my blog! Join my club!) and other times they are posted as if THIS LINK will cure all ills.

Look on all kinds of these threads to get some help/support.  My advice to you is for now, support your partner. don't attack him when he fails. it's a tough struggle which takes alot of time. Especially for us who are suffering; we fall, we stand up, we get stronger, we get weaker, we fall again and we stay strong. It continues untill we get strong enough to stand steadfast.  Your partner needs you the most! And i understand that you will identify yourself with ""them"" even if we tell you not to do that, it's hard indeed to ignore.  This situations will indeed have it's effect on you. But i encourage you to be his strenght where he is weak, to keep the two of you together. And 1 thing, when it comes to this, always be skeptic, but don't say it to him or else there might be war. You cannot trust him, but don't tell him that,  he cannot even trust himself because he is influenced at times (I won't go into detail on that).  You will have to be/become the strong cornerstone in the house on which your partner can build, rely, run to. Pray and ask God to help the two of you, and to show you how to go about these situation, to stand strong for him and for yourself. To help him when he falls. till so far.."

NoFapChristians,37i646,DDave1239,1 point,Thu May 28 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"If he want to change and stop it, it can be a hard way, but with a good end. If he doesn´t want, then... (I don´t know, think about it). If he has got a smartphone with Android, he should install the app Habitbull and start with the fight. He should find out, why and when he relapsed, so that he can avoid all these situations. One big point is to think positive and to set goals. Instead of ""NoFap/No PMO and I don´t relapse"" he should use: ""I respect myself, I respect you, Monroe and I respect our relationship."" (All this ends to No PMO/Fap, but it is positive). Now to the goal: 1. Staying clean for one day. If reached: 2. Staying clean for a week. If reached: 3. Staying clean for two weeks. If reached: 4. Staying clean for a month. And so on... (I don´t need to say, that after reaching the goal, it isn´t ""allowed"" to fap.) For reaching specific goals there could be a reward(, I don´t know, maybe a nice evening for him and you). In the first week, it helped me a lot, when I punished myself with push ups for every thought to PMO.  But HE has to want it, not for you or the relationship. It has to be his own desire.  Don´t compare yourself with the woman he is watching. I hope(and think so), that he doesn´t do it either.  These are the general advice. Other advices are just to be given, if you open your personal matters, relationship, private stuff and so on. I hope(and I think so), that hopefulwife can help you(and with her you should dicuss all personal things, instead of the community)."

Basically I was told one of the big things that I've been wanting to hear for a while now, but on the other hand I confirmed something I've been dreading.  Basically one of my wife's biggest concerns with me right now is that she doesn't believe that I mean this change.  I've tried to quit in the past and didn't make it (I didn't even make it this far before) so she doesn't think I will do it this time.    But along with that has been a resurgence of either erotic or semi-erotic dreams that are making my mornings difficult.  This is leaving me in a weird place because for most of this time I haven't even been tempted, but the last few days ...  But nice going on the lack of drunken mistake.  One of the reasons I've been abstaining from alcohol is for that very reason, I don't want to make a drunken decision to do something I would regret the next day."
NoFapChristians,37g20m,HurtingFather,1 point,Wed May 27 12:47:45 2015 UTC,"My biggest relapses and most serious setbacks came when PMO was mixed with alcohol. If you care about no PMO you have to take alcohol seriously.   •It is a mood altering substance. Our issue is inability to deal with moods.  •It is a substance that decreases inhibitions. We struggle with maintaining our biblical ""inhibitions"" when it comes to risky behaviors.  •It is often served in contexts where PMO is encouraged. We struggle to find people who support our efforts to be free from this sin.   Drinking alcohol is not sin but we are warned about over drinking and the danger and importance of paying attention to what you  are ""filled with"".   I am sympathetic but concerned for you mate. I want you to be all in here with this battle.   Hope this helps.   With great hope in Christ,  BA"
NoFapChristians,37g20m,Blueaugustine,1 point,Wed May 27 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"HF that must be so painful. But as some input for a fellow struggler you have to do what you're doing for His approval alone. ""Walk in the Spirit"" and leave the results to Him.   Also God often uses the people around us to sanctify us. Wives are like that. Her struggle to trust you is depressing because it does reflect on how much more progress has to be made. It's like she is reminding you (reality check) of the extent of the problem and the ripples of consequences that you were hoping were less.   That's the thing about this sin. You know this to be true: we want it done and out of our lives (who doesn't) but it is harder than we expected. So we constantly take short cuts mentally or in our walks with God.   But there are no shortcuts for this thing. None.   And we all have to answer this question honestly: would we quit if nothing else ever changes? Would we stop if the only benefit were the honor of God? If we lost everything else?  I hope I would. Please pray for me.    With great hope in Christ,  BA"

NoFapChristians,37el4f,chaos_walks,1 point,Wed May 27 09:17:11 2015 UTC,"In counseling with my pastor he recommended a pretty simple method of study:  Start by selecting a section of text, not necessarily a whole chapter though it could be. Many Bibles have topical headers that can be helpful in selecting this.   Start with prayer that God would show you something from his word.  Read that passage through several times.  Summarize the passage as completely as possible in six words or less.  Outline the passage as complicated as you are comfortable with.  Seek personal applications. Look at what the passage says people should do in plain language. Also ask God to reveal a more personal meaning for you right now (God wants us to simply obey what the Bible has said but he sometimes supernaturally reveals specific things that he wants us to do through studying the text).   Only once you've done that should you go to the study notes or commentaries. They might have a different understanding of the text than you came to...this does not mean you did anything wrong. Further study will make things clear and you can always go to your pastor and ask if you're confused about something, but there is value in personal study and seeking the word for yourself without immediate input.   Obviously, you should write this all down, the summary, the outline, whatever you learn, and keep it where you can access it again later. Evernote is great for this."
NoFapChristians,37el4f,edibility,1 point,Wed May 27 13:35:47 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on a good study bible! I have been meaning to get that one but haven't been able to just yet.  The HCSB is a very good translation.  Where to begin in studying the Bible kind of depends on where you are both in knowledge and in spiritual maturity.  If you are roughly familiar with the New Testament, but have not read it all the way through in several years, you might want to start there.  Just read it through. You can do that easily in 2 to 3 months.  One tip though, is to break up the ""gospels"" Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Perhaps read one, then two epistles, then read the next.  Only because reading the gospels back to back can be quite a mental exercise in dexterity.  This gives you a nice overview.  Then at that point, I would say, study the epistles in more depth.  Galatians is my favorite.  Read it, then read it again, then read it again.  Read it 10+ times before you even jump to the commentary or study notes.  Read it in other translations (ESV, NASB, KJV, NKJV, NIV, and even NLT).  Read it, and pray while reading.  Read it and meditate on life applications.  Read it EVERYDAY.  Let us know what you are planning and what you are currently doing!"

NoFapChristians,37ep1z,cornbaked,2,Wed May 27 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"how long has it been that you are pornfree?trust me,it takes a long time for your mind/body to reboot.IF you don't trigger yourself,these images will begin to fade over the weeks,generally 90 days is when most of it seems fairly remote. if you trigger urself,you will just continually refresh the images and ingrain them deeper into your 'hard drive'...get on hard mode and stay on hard mode and,in time,if you replace that garbage with positive images,you'll get better...Best wishes."

It can be really tough to abstain when every time you close your eyes you see your fantasies. The biggest way I've found to fight it is to pray. Just repeat ""Lord help me through this"" as your attention shifts from yourself to God you'll find they will go away.  Also as you get further into recovery and look at porn less and less you will find these occurrences will become less frequent.  Prayers, lean on the Lord!"
NoFapChristians,37ep1z,sahlahmin,2,Wed May 27 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"Pretending they aren't there is more damaging to me than acknowledging them and allowing them to pass through. Your mind works in crazy ways, I don't think you can stop a thought (that you weren't expecting anyway) from entering you mind. I'd say, let it go as it came, freely. To that end, I don't wrestle with these thoughts when they come. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. The battle isn't yours. Be still and know that He is bringing you through the furnace. You'll come to be able to endure these moments (if you trust in His peace) and their grip over you will fade over time. And then you'll be stronger for that next stage in your life. James 1:5-8 is a good passage for this issue."

NoFapChristians,37db6s,hopefulwife,2,Tue May 26 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"This! Divert the attention and the focus from you. Ironically enough, by lusting at someone you are prioritizing your desires and fantasies over anything else, one reason it is always popping up in your mind.  Try to do a plan that doesn't revolve around you as well: Voluntary work, help with church projects, etc.  The essential, of course: Focus on God. Immerse yourself in Scripture If you need to. Take them on the phone, posts its, bed stand...  I knew a sister I Christ who would paste simple prayer post-its through the house. When she passed, she prayed on the subject, and was always in communion with the Lord (she inspired my latest post-it adventure btw).  Anyway, these are some of my recommendations.

Every moment that you're thinking about healthy and good things is a moment that you can't be thinking something unhealthy or that you will regret later. One of the best pieces of advice that I received in dealing with my problems was from my pastor who said that we can't define our lives in terms of the things that we say ""no"" to, but that we have to define it by the things that we pursue and say ""yes"" to.  So focus on those things. Do the right things as much as you can (in a healthy way...don't go overboard and burn out!) and the bad things will have that much less room in your life!"

If they say they don't, they're probably liars.  You need to realize it's not a sin to notice a girl is attractive. I struggle with this, too. You can look at a girl and acknowledge she has a nice figure. However, it becomes lust when you imagine what's under her clothes, what it's like to sleep with her, etc. Don't be ashamed for being attracted to women. It's normal.   We're in this fight with you.

Use truth and love to dismantle the lies that your urges are unbearable, they are not, it's another lie we believe as an excuse.   Given all that you still have to get in the dirt and fight, you will have to fight your subconscious mind, your auto pilot, which you have bee training to be your enemy, now you need to train it to be your friend, but for the moment you will not be able to trust your mind.

NoFapChristians,37asp8,intensive_care,2,Tue May 26 13:52:49 2015 UTC,"Community  Community is one the things that God ingrained in us to help us with this type of discipline.

Everything else that people are saying is also good, but they require discipline, which you will need for this struggle.  Discipline is a skill, a muscle, and if you don't flex it from time to time, it will atrophy."
NoFapChristians,37asp8,HurtingFather,2,Tue May 26 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"Here's a list I put together, hope you find these helpful :)  Christian  1.) Read the Bible every day. Don’t feel pressured to read for long stretches of time or read many passages in one sitting. Even if it’s just 1 chapter a day for 5 minutes. It’s better than nothing. Remember start small and grow bigger.  2.) If you are a young person. Make it a priority to read the Book of Proverbs in the Bible at least once a year. The book is Proverbs is unique in that it’s teachings/advice is geared more towards young people. The style of writing is also pretty straight forward and easy to read/understand in comparison to other books of the bible. Pray over the verses you feel convicted on and that you are not living up to.  3.) Worship is important. If you don’t have one, buy a hymnbook. Sing at least 1 song a day. There is a saying that “when the praise goes up, the blessings come down”. This is crucial. Not only that but you get better at singing.  4.) Prayer. This NEEDS to be done daily. You need to maintain that connection with the Father. Even when it feels all it lost. Even when you feel like no one is listening and you are speaking to a wall. You need to push through.  5.) Memorization of Biblical verses. This is also very important when it comes to refuting the lies the Devil tries to demoralize us. While it is important to learn a broad spectrum of biblical verses, it may help more to initially seek out verses that speak to the particular situation you are going through.  6.) Meditation. As with everything else, don’t feel pressured into having to do this for long stretches of time. Even if its just 5 minutes a day, again it’s better than nothing. It’s a start. And when you feel comfortable with/called to, you can increase the duration. Be sure to not confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation of Eastern Religions. Some Christians who do not know much about the subject tend to confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation. However, there is a significant difference. Mindful meditation is simply focusing on one’s breath in a comfortable position with no association with deities.  7.) Go to Church every Sunday. It’s necessary to maintain that social connection. In many cases, a lack of social interaction can manifest itself in negative ways, leading to us taking on negative outlets (addiction) to meet that need. And so we try to compensate for a lack of social interaction by acting out in bad ways. Also be sure to sing the songs. Do not remain silent as many do. Remember when the praises go up, the blessings come down. Be sure to pay attention to the sermon; who knows you may learn something that really speaks to your situation.  8.) If you are a young person, join your Church’s youth group. It can be a great place to make good friends and learn what it means to live out a Christian life.  9.) You need to fast. In Christianity, this is not an option. It is needed. Some people describe fasting as a means to accelerate the healing process, or receive answers more quickly. Others describe it as the metaphorical “grenade” in a Christian’s weapon arsenal. To be used when it feels like one is in stalemate with the enemy and is not gaining ground, or perhaps very little at a high cost.  10.) Confessing to someone. This can seem quite frightening at first, especially if you have been hiding certain unsavory behaviours. But this is a necessary part of the healing process. It helps relieve one of heavy burdens as you are no longer keeping secrets. It also frees up that energy you put towards hiding the addiction, which you can use to actually fight it.  If you feel convicted to confess to a certain someone, then that is likely the Holy Spirit convicting you. Be sure not to make the mistake of minimizing the situation. As in, make sure you mention the fact that you have an “addiction”. And that what you are speaking of was not merely a onetime occurrence that you are feeling guilty of. This can save you a lot of trouble and heartache in the future. And help others to take you seriously.  Practical Things  11.) Exercise/Working out. You need a mixture of both cardio and weight training to deal with urges and lead a healthy life.  12.) Install an Internet Filter. K9 is effective for use on computers. OpenDNS is effective for use of both phones and computers (this one, however, is installed on your router). Both are free. Get someone else to put in the password and use their email address for the password recovery option so that the software is not easy to bypass. Some other people use Covenant Eyes software for accountability. That, however, is not free currently with a monthly fee.  13.) Find good self help books on the subject and about life in general and read them. (ex. Wild at Heart by John Elredge, 10 Lies Men Believe about Porn by Stephen Kuhn, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren)  14.) Join an online help community. Reddit has many subreddits tailored to many issues (GetMotivated, GetDisciplined, Pornfree, NoFapChristians, etc). It can be helpful sometimes to get encouragement/advice from others who understand what you are going through. You may also learn to look at your situation from a different perspective or even receive guidance on things you didn’t even know you were doing wrong.  15.) Clean up your living space. Organize yourself. A messy, unorganized environment can contribute to a disordered mind.  16.) Cut down on your technology usage. Whether on the computer, television, phone, cellphone, internet, whatever. This doesn’t mean getting rid of all technology. We live in a technological age. While it’s important to not let technology rule our lives, that doesn’t mean we need to escape from it and live as hermits. Analyze your technological routine. What devices you use. What sites you frequent. And ask yourself honestly whether you really need to do those things.  17.) Cold Showers can help a lot in the moment. Some choose to exclusively do these. But others prefer to do them sparingly when they find themselves in the heat of the moment. Find what works better for you.  18.) Take a walk outside everyday for at least 5 minutes. Not the kind you do on the treadmill. The kind that actually gets you somewhere. This can be an effective way of clearing the mind. When you take your walk, be sure to walk at a relaxed pace. There is no need to rush, otherwise you lose some of the benefits.  19.) Positive Affirmations. There are many ways to utilize these. You can either read and/or write them daily. Another way of utilizing these is recording yourself speaking these affirmations to yourself, and then listening to the recording daily. Some people record themselves speaking over music.  20.) Getting enough sleep is very important in preventing stress and increasing willpower. It’s understandable that not everyone can always get adequate sleep. Students and people with certain careers cannot sometimes meet these requirements. However, if it is in your power and ability to get adequate sleep, than do so. Also avoid staying up late after others in your household have gone to bed to reduce temptation to sin.  21.) Use an online website or app like chains.cc to keep track of which days you are successful and which days you fail. Doing so can sometimes reveal patterns.  22.) Look the part. You may have heard of studies that say the more you smile, the happier you feel (and not just the other way around). This is true and not only applies to smiling. If you are a man, shave and keep a clean look. Get a Haircut. Stand tall and not slouched over."

Repentence on the other hand doesn't mean asking for forgiveness, but rather admitting you were wrong and truly sorry for what you did. This you have to do even after you get baptised and such.

Matthew 12 vers 43-45 43“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. 44Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. 45Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.”  You know our body is the temple of the holy ghost.  as pentecost was yesterday, and the Apostles were baptized with the Holy Spirit, they kept doing the same as Jesus did. Healing the sick, casting out demons out of the lives of those afflicted. So what do you think about this?"
NoFapChristians,378ziq,EvilAbed1,3,Mon May 25 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"I think that healings preformed by Jesus and the apostles after Pentecost have mostly ceased. Major miracles only occur during 3 periods in the Bible. What God did through Moses and Elijah and what Jesus did.   These miracles accompany the prophets when they are carrying out dramatic changes. Leaving Egypt for the promise land, restablishing a nation of believers and the new covenant.   They were how the people knew what the prophets spoke were from God. Who would follow Moses to the Red Sea with the intent to walk across it if they had not seen the miracle of plagues preformed by God when Moses was speaking.   The way we know the apostles and Jesus were sent by God is because of the miracles that they carried out.   I believe demonic possession is still a reality but I don't believe that the holt spirit would be in the presence of a demonic spirit. I don't believe Christians can be possessed."
NoFapChristians,378ziq,EvilAbed1,1 point,Mon May 25 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"Well i agree with you Evilabed1 to a certain point.   I believe that the promise He made to us, the Holy Spirit that has been poured on us, that God would build our Characters and that one day we may be used to do the same as the apostles did.   I do believe Christians can be possessed. I also believe that Demons will try to break us down on the point of breaktrough, trough dreams or by invading our minds/heart which result in ""relapses""  So some people they will truly possess them, and some they will just come to bring you destruction, and then they go again. but  respect your opinion"
NoFapChristians,378ziq,EvilAbed1,3,Tue May 26 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"2 Corinthians 6:14-16   ""14 Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers, for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? 15 And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever? 16 And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols?....""  This is why I believe that true Christians, Christians with genuine faith, who have the Holy Spirit in them cannot be possessed. ""What fellowship does light have with darkness?"" Our bodies are temples of the Lord and the Lord is present. I don't believe The Lord would share his temple with demons. ""What agreement does Christ have with Belair?"" If Christ has no agreement with Satan it wouldn't make sense that they would both be present in Gods temple (our bodies).   Also there are no references to true believers being possessed in the Bible. People were possessed and then became believers but every case shown in scripture has possession before conversion. There are lots of instructions and warnings in the epistles but no warnings or instructions as to how to avoid being possessed.   John 12:27-30  ""My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 28 And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish ⌊forever⌋, and no one will seize them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them﻿* to me, is greater than all, and no one can seize them﻿* from the Father’s hand. 30 The Father and I are one.”  I agree with you that Demons can impact true Christians. They want to bring us to sin and then accuse us of our Sin. They want our sin to causes us to question Gods love for us. I believe that a true Christian with Spirit in him can be brought close to destruction but I believe God preserves us. ""No one can seize them (his sheep) from the father"".   I respect your opinion as well but I thought I'd explain mine more."

Focus on allowing the Holy Spirit into your heart, allowing Christ to guide your every action, to trust that he is with you always, even in times of distress.  I just had a very good session of prayer.  I left with the feeling of Christ guiding my every step.  I fixed my eyes on him as I walked home and almost felt him pulling my heart by a string to him.  I'm not usually like this, but I like it."

NoFapChristians,378ziq,LoudCommentor,3,Tue May 26 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"Whoa. Whoa. Calm down. Addiction ≠ Possessed. Tons of people, even non-Christians, have beat their fap habit without exorcism. It's easy to read these verses and attribute literally everything bad to demons, but if everything bad is demons, everyone would need prayer to get better, and that's just not true.  That being said, if you really believe you are possessed, a local pastor of an 'untraditional' church can help you much more than this sub ever could. Praying a demon out would be a serious and personal thing, I find it unlikely to be effective via typing."
NoFapChristians,378ziq,a2reno,1 point,Mon May 25 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the case of a Christian and a non-Christian is totally different in this case. This NofapChristians thread speaks about the difference.   These verses are not just to attribute, but to explain my message. i picked them carefully :D  One thing that must be understood is that we only have light and darkness. Every good thing comes from God and every evil comes from the devil himself, who bears that title  ""Satan"" and is the one who inspired people to do bad things. so i don't get your statement? To give proof to that i want to refer to   1 john 5   13I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him.  16If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. 17All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.  18We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 19We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 20We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.  And the last statement you made is kinda weird tho. And untraditional church?? How would you know that?   And it has never been a personal thing for a demon to be prayed out by oneself. Just by looking at the verses i gave that should say enough. ""I do believe in self-deliverance under the guidance of the Holy Spirit""   When Christ sended the apostles to go out, they casted demons out and when he send the 70 out the same happened, people were deliverd by those whom received power and authority from above, which Christ promised us also. not just by a confession but by our characters fully developed in Christ himself. Even if we go trough these lust issues"
NoFapChristians,378ziq,Blueaugustine,3,Tue May 26 21:29:00 2015 UTC,Too much scripture. Not enough description.   Am I a heretic for asking or suggesting this?  BA  PS. We discusses this at length 2-3 weeks ago about the text of the empty house. Can't remember the link.
NoFapChristians,378ziq,Blueaugustine,1 point,Wed May 27 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll go with this:  This is not the sub for your questions. You are welcome to head over to /r/NoFapDebate and discuss your point there. If you post further on this subject, in this manner, we are quite likely to remove your posts.   It is quite reasonable to compare non-Christians to Christians. If fap habit = demon, then no one, non-Christian or Christian, would be able to break their habit without prayer. Both non-Christians and Christians have broken their habit without prayer.  This is not the sub to debate whether or not you are possessed, how to be 'exorcised,' or whether addiction is demon possession. You are entitled to your beliefs, but there is a time and a place. This is neither.  PS: 'Untraditional.' In quotes."
NoFapChristians,378ziq,Blueaugustine,1 point,Wed May 27 08:54:38 2015 UTC,"Well missyaley, then i guess you did not understand when i said that the case of a Christian and a non-Christian is different.  The difference is that christians believe in God and believe in prayer and the help of Christ, we turn to God for our problems. Non-christians don't believe that. simple as that. I never said that a non-christian can't break their habit without prayer, and i believe even Christians can/or have done that without prayer.  but that is the whole reason of this post on itself, it's been posted on NofapChristians for the support of christians, not for bashing non-christians. You brought that up with your comment, which was not needed in the first place. So i didn't post this to bash anyone.   And about the possessed part, i used the example of Christ in the Bible and how he dealt with the people who were possessed with demons; how His attitude was towards the evil spirits, and i was making a reference to ""a way"" of prayer. that is what this post is about. I don't believe Genuine Christians can be possessed, but i do believe that evil spirits can push/possess Christians at a certain point to bring them to do bad stuff, in our case Relapsing. That doens't mean we are possessed. So i hope this clears things up. No bashing on our brothers and sister who fight the same battle, wether they believe or not :D"
NoFapChristians,378ziq,Blueaugustine,3,Wed May 27 19:33:12 2015 UTC,"Imho,if a Christian is truly saved,in other words Spirit-filled,they can not be possessed of any other spirit  save the Holy Spirit,however they surely can be tempted and troubled  by them. Our enemy is an opportunist and will attack us in those weaker areas of our lives such as our sexuality.  I have learned first-hand that masturbation and porn definitely have been demonic strongholds in my life for many reasons which I shan't go into (childhood sexual abuse,excessive promiscuity,occult involvement,etc.) .Of course there are also  many psychological factors in play as well...but demonic influences (sometimes manifestations of remnants from our former lives prior to conversion)simply can't  be denied.Should we seek exorcism? No,not if we are truly saved and if we are not saved, we should seek true Biblical conversion immediately before ANYTHING else.  Frankly,I believe as it says in Psalms 107:20,""He sent forth His Word and healed them.""God has ordained us to imbibe in His Word for all our needs including our addictions.Jesus comes thru the teaching and preaching of the Gospel...before His mighty power all the powers of hell must flee..Be strong in the power of His might. Let Christ fight the battle thru you...for the battle ultimately is not our's but it is the LORD'S...our job is simply to do the 'footwork' and leave the results to Him...amen."

This is merely a suggestion but now might be the right moment to seek counseling both spiritual from your minister/priest as well as psychological from a psychologist/counselor. It sounds like you could benefit from putting all your hardships and emotions into words, trying to get them out of your system, and have a professional guide you to a better understanding of all of this. Good friends could help with this as well, but with professionals you have a better chance being send into the right direction.

NoFapChristians,378b82,MYUTMOST,2,Mon May 25 19:19:38 2015 UTC,"So glad to hear you are doing that! Perhaps your pastor or people at the recovery meetings can recommend a therapist. If you are a student there will be a counselor (often free of charge). If you work there might be a counselor. The latter may not be the right person to take sessions with, but will probably be able to recommend you someone. If nothing above works, you will have to find one yourself. What I can think of (perhaps other people can chip in) is to look for therapists who claim to specialize in couple counseling; they will sure know how to help you. Not sure how it works for you, but you will probably need a recommendation from your GP to have it (partially) covered by your insurance."

NoFapChristians,378b82,TheRealCestus,3,Wed May 27 04:05:32 2015 UTC,"If your faith was wrapped up in a woman rather than God, that is a red flag. Knowledge that your fiancee loved you was enough, but knowledge that Christ loves you is not? Do you actually see the insidiousness of sexual sin and how it separates us from God and from others or did you simply want to stop masturbating for her sake? Are you actively seeking accountability in your local church?  You can change through the love of Christ and the fear of God, but you have to want to change. If you do not want to change right now, pray earnestly that God would bring you to that place. If your church is not a place where you can confess and receive accountability, you need to seek a brother elsewhere.   In my personal experience, I had issues with masturbation when I was dating my ex-fiancee. This was because I had made her an idol and the entire relationship was not done for the glory of God. I had made it about myself and my feelings. I loved her well, but because my relationship with God was so broken from my idolatry, masturbation crept in. I felt like I did not love her properly, that I was a failure, but I refused to let go of the idolatry. The root of the sin was my heart and my relationship with God, not the masturbation or the idolatry. I was stuck in rebellion and because of that, I could get no handle on my sexual sin.  I dont know if this will help you at all, but God delivered me from that relationship and restored me to my first love, Christ. I hope and pray He does the same for you."
NoFapChristians,378b82,Keyser__,2,Tue May 26 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"Edit: I think the real thrust of what I'm feeling is that I lost someone I loved and has written wedding vows for, planned a life together, fully intended to grow old together with and the emotional pain is so extreme that it's all I can do to fight off urges as they come and trusting God is extremely difficult at times when the world seems bleak. I'm leaving the original, harsher reply here because it is also true to what is in my heart and my head.   My problem is that I really thought I was doing it for God and that I really did believe Jesus was enough and I was and am practicing accountability in my church and practicing daily prayer and bible reading. I wasn't doing all these things perfectly but I was improving and doing much more than before I started nofap. I told my pastor and myself that I fully believed Jesus was enough and he would carry me through to a life free of porn and masturbation and a life of serving him even if things didn't work out with her, even if I never married. I was seeking him and her deciding to end it still wrecked me.   My doubts are coming from the fact that if I need perfectly pure motives even subconsciously before God will help me in overcoming sin, then it's foolish to trust in him."
NoFapChristians,378b82,Blueaugustine,2,Tue May 26 11:28:47 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I met the girl of my dreams, she was everything I could ever have wanted in a woman, fun to be around, caring, compassionate, godly and so on. I fell head over heels in love with her, and was sure that I was gonna marry her someday.   As a result of my addiction to masturbation things didn't work out, and eventually I watched as she effectively told me she never wanted to see me again, and drove off out of my life.   To say I was crushed was an understatement. I begged God for a long time to give her back to me. But you know what? He didn't. She moved on into a new relationship, and although we eventually became friends again, it's never been the same.   It sucks when you lose someone you love. I can't honestly think of anything worse. But something I realised was that actually God knows exactly what I was going through. When Jesus died on the cross for us, God was losing his only son who he loved. Jesus willingly died for us, because he loves us.  I don't know what your motives were, only you can answer that. But God loves you, and nothing will ever change that (see Romans 8:38-39). I think now more than ever you need to trust God, hard as it is. But remember although you might have lost something you love, he gave everything for you."

I point Back to the podcast because there's a lot more to say there from this perspective, from my story. I've started this ministry because of the freedom I've experienced and wanting to help others.  I've experienced the devastation, sex addiction or compulsive sexual behavior infects, corrupts, and shatters trust. It destroys relationships, families, and lives. Talking about the difference between a deep impactful relationship with Jesus Christ and cold religion is a challenging one.

Here is my advice to you, hoping it might strenghten you, as it did me also.  **Hebrew 12 vers 4-13 God Disciplines His Children  4In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says,  “My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,  6because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”a   7Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? 8If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. 9Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live! 10They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. 11No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.  12Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 13“Make level paths for your feet,”b so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.**  the situation you are going trough, i been trough it also. The relapses/bondage can become quite hard sometimes. But remember, even tho you are suffering now. We who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, we will be disciplined as sons by our Father in heaven. Disciplined for our own good, for our character to develop. Those who have been going trough the same bondage of lust as us and have the longest streaks at this moment are undergoing in those disciplines now.   Chirst was disciplined, the apostles also, everyone in the bible was disciplined, and their character developed, to he point they became strong in the Lord. Don't forget to run to God even when you relapse.   Satan wants to keep you away from God by bringing you heart/character down trough that which he temptates you and make you feel miserable. Keep thanking God and praying. Pray against those spirit troubling you. those bondages holding you.   And if possible, get an accountability partner to help you.   ecclesiastes 4 vers 8-12  8There was a man all alone;  he had neither son nor brother.  There was no end to his toil,  yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.  “For whom am I toiling,” he asked,  “and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?”  This too is meaningless—  a miserable business!  9Two are better than one,  because they have a good return for their labor:  10If either of them falls down,  one can help the other up.  But pity anyone who falls  and has no one to help them up.  11Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.  But how can one keep warm alone?  12Though one may be overpowered,  two can defend themselves.  A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.  See this.

NoFapChristians,377jj2,trog1999,4,Mon May 25 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, if you look up my story you will see i have these dreams also. in the first 3 weeks i dreamed also about breaking my streak. I dreamed more about having sex with mostly unknown woman. Or dreaming about myself watching porn or searching for it.  As a christian you should know about the spirits that oppress people whom are behind this aka (spirits of lust)...   Ephesians 6 - The Armor of God  10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  and to answer the question if nightmares are going to look like that?? i would say in our case; yes. I ""used"" to dream about losing my streak and waking up so weak.... i would just relapse like a madman. the same would be when i used to dream about myself having sex with woman.  What i do against this? I break those chains, bondages in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ.  Don't let those dreams fool you tho. pray against it. you will get stronger in time.."

I immediately felt a great loss of koininea which NFC had offered me.In fact,w/o God's help via this community I would never have stayed clean more than a week or so.One way this works is,though we are an on-line family,we grow very close in here and when we fail it feels like more than a betrayal of God and ourselves...it feels like a betrayal of the ""brotherhood(sisterhood?)"" and in a way it most certainly is...BUT,we are all quick to forgive and exhort each other,in love,to get back on track,having almost all been, at one time or another, in the identical same situation ourselves,for we all know or are discovering that we have feet of clay and we must stand together or we will perish alone.God is awesome.We all come from different Christian traditions and yet we all share a common enemy as well as a common Champion and we draw strength and power  thru Him to fight this wickedness together thru mutual sharing and prayer...so God bless you bro,you have said good things here.May I be the first to welcome you in the Name of Christ to our humble family?

NoFapChristians,372ekd,garrisonthebear78,6,Sun May 24 05:46:53 2015 UTC,"I get you man.  I usually hate myself too, to the point where I don't feel/comprehend God's love for me or the love others have for me, which in turn makes it hard to love others and God the way I should.  And that's the problem!  See, we're called to love like Christ, and that includes ourselves.  It's this self-hatred that Satan uses to keep us enslaved to sin.  Because when we hate ourselves and feel guilty we turn to sin to self medicate, but then end up feeling worse.  It's a vicious cycle that only ends at the Cross.  Part of our problem is that we look to ourselves.  We say something like, ""I'm not worthy of love because XYZ, I suck.""  But the God of the universe, who is sovereign, all-powerful, and with whom there is no variation has decreed that He loves us.  The fact that God, in all of His omnipotence and omnipresence, loves us, cares for us, knows us fully, and WANTS to be in communion with us means at least these two things:   Others opinions of us do not matter. Our opinion of ourselves does not matter.   The point is, stop looking at yourself and all of your sin, and look to Christ!    It also sounds like you might be a little bit legalist?  You can't earn God's love or respect through all your good deeds, and even on your best days you fall woefully short.  God doesn't love you because you defend your faith or spread the Gospel, He loves you because He wants to!    Practically speaking, maybe that has kept you from coming clean?  Do you maybe feel like others would judge you or lose respect for you as a Christian if you told them?  A main way God sanctifies us is through each other, so honestly, I think it would help you most to come clean to a few Christian friends you can trust, and have them be accountability partners.  They probably need it too.  It's time to stop the navel-gazing and ask for help friend."

The way you beat this is to start loving yourself, as God loves you, it isn't easy but stop beating yourself up, it is just adding to the self-abuse. In terms of quitting I encourage you to practice discipline in other areas of your life: like reading your bible, praying everyday, regular exercise etc. Hope this helps :) I will pray for you!"
NoFapChristians,372ekd,chaos_walks,1 point,Mon May 25 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"ASk yourself this Question. Who is pushing you, to the point of lust/pornography masturbation? Isn't it Satan?   And because of this you are hating yourself?  So what you are saying is: Satan is trying to destroy me trough pmo and because of that i am starting to hate myself. This is exactly how he wants you to feel/think. Because he wants you to forget that Christ died for you and trough ""Grace"" we will be renewed each time we ask Him in repentance.  don't allow your situation to doubt God and run to Satan. Instead of that, run to God knowing you made a mistake, knowing you were pushed by the spirit of lust.   Everyone here is talking about the trigger to stand strong. Pray for that trigger at all times. Thank the Lord at all times, in good and bad times. Because he knows our situations, feelings, when we will fall or stand strong. Trough our failing and falling our characters can be build to be stronger. take an example of those with 90 days streaks and higher :D Stay strong and don't doubt yourself.   I used to feel down after i relapsed, now i keep running to God without feeling down. I dont keep quiet towards God. I advice you to do the same :D   good luck!"
NoFapChristians,3728qy,jad_seven,2,Sun May 24 04:35:40 2015 UTC,"It's definitely something I struggle with. I don't have any scriptures that particularly helped me with it though. A book such as ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns is a lot of help. It really goes over dealing with emotions in a healthy way.  Aside from that, taking time to really think through your feelings (talk out loud even) can be of benefit. Recognizing when you have ""all or nothing"" thinking is a great start. It's easy for us to view things in black and white, ie; X is all bad or X is all good. Realizing that nothing is that clear can help you move past some of the struggles."
NoFapChristians,3728qy,missyaley,1 point,Sun May 24 05:02:17 2015 UTC,"I really like missyaley 's points. Thank you.   You say emotional pressure. I call what I experience anxiety. And I am someone who can relate to what you're saying.   Not a 1:1 correlation, though. Normally ""emotional pressure"" or stress leads me to: 1) worry fear and obsess about how little control I have 2) procrastinate 3) spend idle time and either 4) drink or surf the web which leads to 5) PMO or other risky lusting behavior.   It also runs parallel to these things that I DONT do: 1) pray 2) read gods word 3) call a friend or make a cry for help 4) confess 5) do something positive while 6) embracing the pain.   As for me when in a healthy place spiritually I constantly go to these three verses:  •""Each day has enough trouble of its own..."" (Mat 6) •""Whom have I in heaven but you? And. Earth has nothing u desire but you"" (Ps 73) •""My peace I give you my peace I leave with you not as the world give do I give to tou therefore do not let your hearts be troubled"" (John 16)  With great hope in Christ  Ba"

The fog that comes from these stressful events can often make us blind to what is good an bad. I really think here is when having God's Word engraved in our hearts that it really helps.   I think we don't proclaim the Word of God out loud enough, If we are being completely honest. I'm going to start doing this more often, even recurring to post-its layed throughout my house.  Jesus manifested the power through his words. When He was tempted by the devil, He actively fought with the Word, so there's power in it (even the enemy tried to use it!)  Matthew 4:4  4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’""  Worth checking as well (Romans 10:9; 10:10)  Blessings,   Moon"

It's good that you feel guilty, because that means you still have your faith. Sinning should cut us to our heart, because we are making God greave. But the most important thing to remember is that he still loves you just as much as he did before you relapsed.  Just pray and rely on God to cover us with his love and protection, because we really can't beat it alone. I know, because I was on a five month streak and was feeling really proud of myself. I became prideful and thought to myself, ""I'm strong, I can't be tempted anymore"". Boom, right there God humbled me and lifted his cover that was over me off, and I was so weak. Fell right there. I spiraled into multiple relapses after that until I REPENTED and just prayed for him to give my strength and cover.   Remember, we are nothing, but He is something. It's always good to remember to stay humble."

The fact is that repentance is truly trying not to do it again - I know you are doing this, and I respect that, and God loves you for this. There is not a problem that cannot be solved with God. God has your back in every situation, God is omniscient, God is all-powerful. You've given your life, mind, soul, spirit, and body to God and I understand the struggle. That's Satan trying to get to you, trying to attack your soul. What else could possibly try to drag you away from righteousness under God? Every time you get an urge, rebuke Satan, rebuke the demons. I truly hope my advice can help you.      Praise God"

It takes a choice, and some action. lean on Jesus if you don't think you can do it on your own. the more broken I from trying to do it myself only brought me closer to Jesus, as paradoxical as it sounds.

For sure you are right, you have to be present to life, and that's key to not being an inward, absent addict. However you phrased it ""the good things in life"". What if life is not good?

Then when things took a long turn for the worse, i started fapping all the time. After a while something happened that filled me with hope, pulled another nice streak. Hope gone: streak over.

There is no universal step by step instruction manual on how to build a better life.  I used to (and still) struggle with this notion. Though, as I got used to it, I'm starting to grasp the beauty of it.  There is a certain appeal to uncertainty once you get past the vague fear that surrounds it.  And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28, NIV)  There is no reason to be afraid.

Your thoughts and feelings are at the beck and call of this unseen master which is tugging their chain from your unconsciousness convincing you want what you do not. You catch my drift: PMO is not even the real problem. If you could say a prayer or take a pill or snap your fingers and PMO would go away you would still have this problem. I believe we were given this problem by God so we could overcome it. It's training. We are not called to instant perfection but to trying our utmost to get stronger. Maybe for you that means a specific thing, more serious commitment to prayer, getting a spiritual director, more focus on the needs of others. For me it meant large front of issues, such as understanding and unraveling some of the beliefs I took for granted about life and women and sex, and I also needed to do some basic mental training. Learning how to commit to, and persevere with regular exercise, healthy diet, cold showers was really essential for me.

When David threw that stone and killed Goliath, the unconqueorable fighter that has slaughter many brothers (sin), the Isrealites rallied together and destroyed the  Philistines. With the fall of sin, we see the giant fall at the hands of our Christ and we scream ""fall Goliath"" and we charge forward to kill our sin. It just chills me to the bones.

Something I've noticed in my own life that maybe you can relate to is that I find it easy to say ""I'm sorry"" to God but then within an hour I can be back lusting after a girl I've seen or whatever.   The problem is that while I've said sorry I haven't turned away from sin and towards Christ. A full 180 degree turn is needed. I think it's also important to remember that you are forgiven and that you don't have to be ashamed of the stuff you've done, because God isn't ashamed of you. To quote Romans ""there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ"".  Hopefully this is helpful. If you need an accountability partner I was also looking for one. Am 21 and can do PM on this."

If god wants you to preach he doesn't want you doing that in or thru your own power does he? [2 Corinthians 4:6-7]  Second thing. What is true is that God warns that ""not many of you should be teachers because you will be judged more strictly"". If it is his will that you preach then this makes your struggle more important in some ways than others.   Third thing. I like settingcaptivesfree dot com. It is free and they provide a mentor for you and there are lots of good resources to help as well.   Fourth, I've struggled with incestuous thoughts as well. It feels shameful and embarrassing even beyond the fact that we already are ashamed of this stuff. And it is dangerous. But when you start to learn about this sin you'll find that the sin cycle is the same no matter what you are obsessing about. And that the problem is deeper than PMO. ""The heart of the matter is a matter of the heart""  Fifth. This is only my opinion but... preaching at 19 seems young to me. Tho I'm not in your situation, there are warnings about novices becoming elders and teachers in the Bible. You may be feeling some pressure in this way that is adding to your temptations.   Lots more to learn about this thing. Praise the Lord that you are serious about it now.   It won't get easier. We are glad to have you on the team. What /u/trophenius said was excellent.

Indeed that is a core step in ""offering up"" and ""carrying your cross"".  Analysis of where the pain / anxiety comes from sometimes helps.... especially if you are holding on to some childhood complex / assumption that your adult mind would drop without a thought if it actually was conscious of it... but in truth:   pain/anxiety/separation/disappointment it is a constant in our lives... and awareness of it, which allows you to put it in the context of your relationship with Christ, makes the yoke much much easier to bear than either (un)consciously reacting to it, being fearful of it, seeing it as an obstacle etc. etc.  congrats on the 4 weeks badge ;)"

As far as I am concerned he says nothing new. But he does offer a particular clarity of how our mind, emotions and ego mute our awareness and make our pain seemingly unbearable...  And the PMO battle helps so much here because talk about an amplifying a little physical discomfort into godzilla... ...that reminds me of one of my favorite lines in a song I swear is about being unshackled from sexual addiction ""Jubilee Street"" by Nick Cave:  ""I've got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain: A ten ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain""  And of course the tiny little pain can be held in check with a 1 pound string, it's our imagination which inflates it to the 10 ton catastrophe :p  Here is the music with lyrics (no triggers) in case you're curious https://vimeo.com/57203089  btw steer clear of the official music video as it does have explicit stuff in it  glad to see you back troph :)"
NoFapChristians,36trep,JITTERdUdE,4,Fri May 22 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"Dude, God already knew you were going to screw up when you told him you wouldn't. He knows your heart. He could see that you were sincere. But he also knows your future. He knew you couldn't live up to your own standards. Nothing changed between you and him when it actually happened.  I understand that you can't psychologize yourself out of having an actual medical condition. But to whatever extent possible, you need to learn to rely on God's own power rather than your own. You can't do it yourself, as you say, no matter how hard you try. Give it to God, and let him direct you in what you need to do next. And don't expect it to happen all at once.  You need to be honest with God. Read the Psalms a bit; you'll notice a pattern. Nobody is fake with God in them. People complain, they accuse him of being unfair (even if they retract it later on), they talk about how good they think they are and how bad they think they are. They tell him exactly what they want and don't add any sanctimonious stuff like ""But only if it's your will, Father"" while in their hearts they wouldn't have meant that.  I've been trying seriously to quit PMO for six months now. I haven't been completely successful, as my counter shows. But I've been doing better. It all started with me admitting to God that I needed his help. And he has been helping me. Every time I fall, and come back, God adds something to help me do better next time. The first time it was praying more. The second time it was reading more Scripture. Most recently, it was being thankful to him for whatever success I do have.  But the one thing I've noticed is that no matter how many times I fail, God never leaves me to my own devices.  God works with us where we are. He knows our future; he knows whether we will succeed or fail. He doesn't expect us to succeed when he knows we are too weak. He waits until we're ready to work with him. And he also knows that's a decision that may take some time."

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.    God sees us as blameless before him thanks to Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. He sees no fault he can charge us with. It's like we haven't sinned.   This becomes even more comforting, I think, when we realize that God ""chose us in him before the foundation of the world."" God chose to see us as blameless before the world was even created. So God saved you even though he knew how nasty you would feel and the awful things you would do. He chooses to love you anyway. You didn't earn his love, so you won't lose it.   I hope that helps. I find it comforting."

I sense or perceive that you are focused on the dreams--and the spiritual battle described in Ephesians 6. Is that your main fear or concern or question?  If that's the case, I would agree that this sinful practice is definitely like the devil's playground. But it is also (equally) true that with such long stretches of adulterous and immoral behavior (PMO) (with only short periods of purity and holy living), your mind will definitely take time to become renewed.   [Romans 12:1-2]  But tho it will take time and require lots of ""Ephesians 6 warfare"" it is well worth it.   As the apostle Peter says elsewhere, ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you.""  And if and as he does flee you will be free to fill your life with new dreams and new thoughts. New hopes and new love.  Think about it: soon, if you keep fighting, six and a half weeks will seem short! That month and a half is but a small taste of the freedom and joy that you can have with Christ battling for you and this sin more and more behind you. You open up your heart for so much more joy.   But it is hard work and we all are here because we need each other.   With hope in the Lord,  BA"

NoFapChristians,36s641,fapstronaut25,2,Thu May 21 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the group! Taking a step like deleting your stash is a big first step. It was hard for me to delete some of the stuff I had saved. To be honest they were some of my favorite possessions because they ""helped"" me through some tough times. I can assure you that it is way way better out here without the porn as a crutch.  Here's my take on masturbation and whether it is a sin or not  The key takeaway is to ask yourself if what you're doing is Christlike or not. Additionally, is this something that is bringing you closer to your wife or driving a wedge between you two. Sex is an incredible part of marriage and has a really unexplainable way to bring two people together. It is not just some animalistic activity that we should do when we're bored and there isn't anything good to watch on TV.   So I do believe there are exceptions where traditional penetrative sex may be difficult/impossible for one of the members so mutual masturbation is a way to enjoy each other. However, masturbation should not be used when one of the members doesn't feel like it and the other just wants to get their rocks off. It should be something that brings the two together, not separates.  Congrats on deleting that stuff. Each step is huge and is headed towards positive living and becoming the man you made to be!  Keep going!  Prayers, lean on the Lord!"

NoFapChristians,36s641,thederekmast,2,Fri May 22 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting question.   TL/DR: masturbation is sin because it is a form of adultery. And adultery isn't just what you do with your mind but also with your body. But I also agree with OAJs exceptions.     I would come at the question starting with an assertion:  We are ""Christians"" not just in our hearts but also in our bodies. It isn't either the action or the heart, it is both/and.  Proof of this is that Jesus rose bodily from the dead. Not just ""in his heart."" He is alive at the Fathers right hand in the flesh. Not just ""spiritually.""  And we pray for the new heavens and the new earth. The meek will inherit the earth. That is, his return will be bodily and he will Renew the CREATION in the palin-genesis of all things.   True: the heavens and earth will be ""destroyed"" by fire but that is a kind of cleansing or renewal. What remains will be a redeemed and repaired cosmos. A new and perfected Eden if u will.   In the OT, shalom means peace. Not just the absence of war but full vats of oil and wine, lots of kiddos running around, and laughter joy and worship. So we lift our hands and shake the tambourine. Not just ""sing in our hearts.""  Point being; what we do with our bodies does matter. It isn't just what you think or don't think about.   Not to be too gross but if you had sex with an animal and said you were thinking about your wife (or about nothing at all) would that make it ok? I hope you'd agree the answer is no.   Now just because sex with animals is prohibited in the Bible and masturbation isn't expressly forbidden does that make a difference?   I would say that the answer is no. Sex with animals is wrong because it is adultery. Jesus said that adultery is more than what you do with your body, but not less.   I believe the implications of the command prohibiting adultery is that sex outside of marriage is forbidden. That would include sex with self (which is technically outside marriage) also being forbidden.   You get to have sex in covenant with your wife. That's it.   My reasoning is based on the Christian view of creation stated above. But I will add I do agree with the ""exceptions"" that OAJ listed as well.   I've been specific and detailed because you're a hard core dude who can handle Hebrew so I think you'll grasp the picture I'm sketching here.   Hope this helps.   With great hope in The Lord  BA"

My suggestion for you would be to find a spiritual father, or somebody you can talk to with full trust, and connect with them. Talk to them about your problems, discuss what might have potentially led you to this addiction. Reading the New Testament as well as praying can both definitely help you. Make sure you go to church as often as possible and try to talk to people in real life as much as you can. Take on a new hobby, such as a sport or watch movies and series online.

NoFapChristians,36qgdo,Blueaugustine,2,Fri May 22 03:22:09 2015 UTC,"To me repentance is turning away from my sin and towards Christ. So saying sorry and asking for forgiveness and then asking that Christ would help me learn from my mistakes and become more like him.  The problem I have is that sometimes after I relapse I feel pretty great, and it's hard to apologise for something that makes me feel so good. I can say I'm Sorry but it's not from the heart and 5 mins later I can be lusting over the next attractive girl that walks past.   True repentance often comes with sorrow as I realise the error of my ways and that I have been living in sin rather than living in the spirit."

So in your religious life you know it's wrong but where your heart is you ""love it"" because ""it feels good."" True repentance means having a ""true sense of your sin."" Do you really think you have a true sense of your sin?  ••to me repentance with this thing involves two aspects: radical amputation or removal and radical pursuit of God, with a plan to address weaknesses in your relationship with Him. I'm not sure from what you wrote if you have fully planned to not go back.   ••there may be a separation between your faith and practice/lifestyle. If so, repentance has to address that separation with brutal honesty.   With great hope in Christ,  BA"
NoFapChristians,36qgdo,Blueaugustine,2,Fri May 22 12:35:52 2015 UTC,"Yep that's pretty much the problem I have. Before I was a Christian I would fap my problems away, leading to feelings of guilt and shame, but also a deeper sense of feeling that I could never be love or be loved. These feelings came to a head when I experienced the breakdown of a relationship and the rejection that came with that.   Now I am a Christian I know the truth that I am loved, valued, accepted, set free from sin and so on, however Part of me still believes the lie that ""you will never be loved"" and so I turn to masturbation as a way to feel something.   I have a tendency to over think and over analyse the simplest things, for example, there have been times when a girl hasn't replied straight away to a text Ive sent, this small rejection can quickly snowball into making much more than it is, and I fall into sin.  Another struggle might be with my own human desires. I find women attractive, and I struggle to control my desire to have sex. Since I'm not married fapping is the easy way out, rather than waiting for a wife."

Something deeper is the problem.  2) if we are correct then simply having a lawful ""outlet"" for O doesn't eliminate the problem. In many ways it will exaggerate the problem because now you feel guilty for having a biblically lawful outlet for your urges but that outlet doesn't satisfy.  3) why not? The relief of an O didn't satisfy before marriage. Neither will it satisfy after marriage.  4) The only thing that satisfies is Christ poured out like oil into the broken cracks of your soul. believe it or not I is true. That's when sex in marriage becomes ""secondary"" and when no sex outside of marriage is ""tolerable."" 5) it's not about sex. It's not about PMO. It's about Christ.

NoFapChristians,36pacy,Blueaugustine,8,Thu May 21 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'll tag on as a married folk. I'll try to think of an analogy while I write this. Here are my experiences as a married guy who has a history of PMO:  I've been married for 3.5 years now. Revealed my struggle while dating, a month or so before proposing. We had premarital sex while engaged... SHORT ENGAGEMENTS PEOPLE! Thankfully I was in a state of fighting my PMO even then. I hadn't made a lot of the bigger breakthroughs, but I also wasn't so far gone that the pre-marital relations were a result of me being forceful in any way (we've talked about it since and both asked forgiveness of eachother/the Lord). Now about those breakthroughs I've made since. Well there's a big part of your answer, why would I need to make breakthroughs if marriage fixed everything?! Well it doesn't!   I had a pattern of putting my priorities on the battle against Porn. Once I was married I felt like M could be justified in those times when we were away, or when she was on her cycle, so long as I was thinking of times with her during M. This was just a vicious cycle, as I would swear off of everything for a month or so, slowly M would creep back in, then after months of no P but occasional-to-frequent 3/wk? M I would find myself looking up the wrong stuff. Honestly, it wasn't until last summer that I saw this pattern really for what it was and completely swore off M as well.   I started to view M through the lens of ""I'm a selfish person by nature, this act is probably wrong, how does the bible tell us this is wrong"" And came to conclusions pretty much exactly as BA said above. I was still using sex in marriage as a release. In fact, I'm still struggling with that. And truthfully, it's the most confusing and difficult thing for me to grasp. I want sex, so how can it ever be selfless? I think the important thing is what you want in sex. Do you just want that release? or do you want to serve your spouse in giving her pleasure? But then I think - wait but I really enjoy when she displays pleasure in love-making - so is that even a selfless desire? Is it even OK to initiate these times, or does that belie that my heart is in it for me?  I think my personal goals to combat these feelings are to: seek ways to serve her in all aspects, learn more about her and how to tell if she's even remotely in the mood, show physical affection without the expectation of sex (this is so hard because it's a wall that has to break down in her mind and frankly my body shows signs of being ready despite me having a mind set on other things)"

NoFapChristians,36pacy,missyaley,9,Thu May 21 04:46:27 2015 UTC,"No, and in fact for some it gets worse especially if you're using it as a stress release mechanism.   Marriage is hard and it will NOT solve any sexual problems. My husband didn't bother trying to work on his addiction before getting married because he believed marriage was the answer.  Instead, it got worse.   Work on yourself now before you drag another person into it."
NoFapChristians,36pacy,hopefulwife,4,Thu May 21 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"If you M very occasionally, maybe. If you're a fapstronaut because you have a once-a-day or worse habit, no. Your PMO isn't about sex any more, you're using porn as a crutch and having sex with another person won't fix whatever it is that is causing you to need a crutch."
NoFapChristians,36pacy,NoFap_Newb,3,Thu May 21 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"It helps a little, but the experience of masturbating is different and your addiction to it isn't just about having a climax. I'd say being married helps more in that it gives you a specific person in your life who you're hurting."

NoFapChristians,36pacy,mycourage,2,Thu May 21 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"In my circumstance ... not, not really.  When I was single there were many times when I would PMO multiple times a day, and that more or less stopped (or at least subsided) while married, but that was more an aspect of just being less ... bored.  But when I traveled and was in a room by myself, even for just one night ...  It's why the upcoming times when I will be alone, by myself, worry me the most right now.  As long as I have something to do, I can distract myself, but ..."

These people that you get creeped out from are.... us, yourself included.   I guess, We either die fighting, or live long enough to see ourselves become the villains.  Your looks, just like everything, is a gift from God, a talent. It is no longer about accepting the situation, its about seizing the opportunity. Just imagine what you would've felt or perhaps still feel if a person you are attracted to you smiled back.   Your great responsibility, is to make these people wanted and loved.

NoFapChristians,36kl23,frankyfank,3,Wed May 20 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty hefty list of songs you got there :)  I will have to save this and come back to go through the songs individually. To be honest, I don't like too many Christian bands. I think a lot of contemporary Christian music sounds the same and kind of depressing :/  It was only recently that I discovered 2 Christian bands that I really like. The first being Newsboys. And the second being DC Talk as their music is very soulful and they cover a lot of music genres (TobyMac used to be a part of this one).  My favorite Christian song would have to be DC Talk's ""Consume Me"", which I think perfectly gets across how a relationship with God is supposed to be and feel like:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVlod4SdLD8  I also like U2. They aren't necessarily a ""Christian"" band. But I believe all the members are Christian. I personally think their ""Joshua Tree"" album is by far the best and most spiritual."
NoFapChristians,36kl23,jmorin17,4,Wed May 20 02:01:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting.. very different than most of the Christian music you here.  I agree with how the music is becoming a little overproduced and oftentimes I get the feeling they are trying to be exactly like today's pop music, except throwing the word ""God"" in the lyrics a few times.  I'd have to say from that list, my absolute favorites are 10,000 Reasons and Come As You Are.  I've cried to 10,000 Reasons a couple times, I'm not gonna lie."
NoFapChristians,36kl23,on-a-journey,2,Wed May 20 02:10:20 2015 UTC,I love u2!!! I know Bono is a Christian and I want to say the Edge is to but I don't believe Adam or Larry are. Joshua Tree is one of my favorite albums of all time. Each song is a masterpiece. They have a lot of other great stuff too. My favorite song is Beautiful Day. I saw them in concert a few years back for the 360 tour and it was incredible. Great choice in music :)
NoFapChristians,36kl23,iluuu,1 point,Thu May 21 05:02:13 2015 UTC,I don't like too many Christian bands   Then you're missing out on a lot of good music :)  I don't many of the mainstream pop/rock bands either but there are some phenomenal rappers and metal/post hardcore/rock bands out there.

I wouldn't be greedy and slam a wall of text up every day but why not at least post a brief meditation?  It might help you and if you see others reacting or feeling blessed by your godly example it might really encourage someone else as well.

What gets you closer to God is having a clean heart. You know God loves you, he died just for you. You have to read the Bible each day and pray for his power. Forget about that you are in day 1, God is eternal, He does not count days, what he looks at is your heart. Pray each day, multiple times if you have to, ask him for wisdom, read the bible, ask him for power to protect you from this world and the sinful desires of this world, ask him to clean your heart...Watch this video...see how Jesus prays, he is our example, see his face in the end...He is the power you need. The acting in this film is amazing, Look at Jesus eyes in the end as he looks right to Satan, look how he steps on the snake, we need to follow Jesus example. Think of the snake as porn. Step on it with conviction. Stay strong, we have to pray and read the Bible for strengh that is beyond human. May God bless you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkROLJjYCpo"
NoFapChristians,36kujr,sfumato1002,3,Wed May 20 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Do not forget that even if you never manage to overcome this addiction, God is still able to see that you have been trying and struggling to come close to Him. If you take a step towards God, He will take many more to come to you. Just believe, pray and have strong faith, then everything is possible. Another suggestion I have for you is to try to focus on getting better on as many aspects as possible at the same time. That way, you will care less and less about overcoming a PMO addiction. An amazing resource is the Hymn To Love (1 Corinthians: 13 https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13). God bless you!

NoFapChristians,36inx9,Maestro2619,3,Tue May 19 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I just said a prayer for you. Hope you are doing better now.   Here's a list that I put together of things you should do that help with recovery. Its certainly not a be all end all, or even complete for that matter since I'm always adding more stuff to it. But all of these things have helped me significantly in my own journey and I hope they can help you as I wish I had known many of these things when I first started out :)  Christian   1.) Read the Bible every day. Don’t feel pressured to read for long stretches of time or read many passages in one sitting. Even if it’s just 1 chapter a day for 5 minutes. It’s better than nothing. Remember start small and grow bigger.  2.) If you are a young person. Make it a priority to read the Book of Proverbs in the Bible at least once a year. The book is Proverbs is unique in that it’s teachings/advice is geared more towards young people. The style of writing is also pretty straight forward and easy to read/understand in comparison to other books of the bible. Pray over the verses you feel convicted on and that you are not living up to.  3.) Worship is important. If you don’t have one, buy a hymnbook. Sing at least 1 song a day. There is a saying that “when the praise goes up, the blessings come down”. This is crucial. Not only that but you get better at singing.  4.) Prayer. This NEEDS to be done daily. You need to maintain that connection with the Father. Even when it feels all it lost. Even when you feel like no one is listening and you are speaking to a wall. You need to push through.  5.) Memorization of Biblical verses. This is also very important when it comes to refuting the lies the Devil tries to demoralize us. While it is important to learn a broad spectrum of biblical verses, it may help more to initially seek out verses that speak to the particular situation you are going through.  6.) Meditation. As with everything else, don’t feel pressured into having to do this for long stretches of time. Even if its just 5 minutes a day, again it’s better than nothing. It’s a start. And when you feel comfortable with/called to, you can increase the duration. Be sure to not confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation of Eastern Religions. Some Christians who do not know much about the subject tend to confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation. However, there is a significant difference. Mindful meditation is simply focusing on one’s breath in a comfortable position with no association with deities.   7.) Go to Church every Sunday. It’s necessary to maintain that social connection. In many cases, a lack of social interaction can manifest itself in negative ways, leading to us taking on negative outlets (addiction) to meet that need. And so we try to compensate for a lack of social interaction by acting out in bad ways. Also be sure to sing the songs. Do not remain silent as many do. Remember when the praises go up, the blessings come down. Be sure to pay attention to the sermon; who knows you may learn something that really speaks to your situation.   8.) If you are a young person, join your Church’s youth group. It can be a great place to make good friends and learn what it means to live out a Christian life.   9.) You need to fast. In Christianity, this is not an option. It is needed. Some people describe fasting as a means to accelerate the healing process, or receive answers more quickly. Others describe it as the metaphorical “grenade” in a Christian’s weapon arsenal. To be used when it feels like one is in stalemate with the enemy and is not gaining ground, or perhaps very little at a high cost.  10.) Confessing to someone. This can seem quite frightening at first, especially if you have been hiding certain unsavory behaviours. But this is a necessary part of the healing process. It helps relieve one of heavy burdens as you are no longer keeping secrets. It also frees up that energy you put towards hiding the addiction, which you can use to actually fight it.   If you feel convicted to confess to a certain someone, then that is likely the Holy Spirit convicting you. Be sure not to make the mistake of minimizing the situation. As in, make sure you mention the fact that you have an “addiction”. And that what you are speaking of was not merely a onetime occurrence that you are feeling guilty of. This can save you a lot of trouble and heartache in the future. And help others to take you seriously.  Practical Things  11.) Exercise/Working out. You need a mixture of both cardio and weight training to deal with urges and lead a healthy life.  12.) Install an Internet Filter. K9 is effective for use on computers. OpenDNS is effective for use of both phones and computers (this one, however, is installed on your router). Both are free. Get someone else to put in the password and use their email address for the password recovery option so that the software is not easy to bypass. Some other people use Covenant Eyes software for accountability. That, however, is not free currently with a monthly fee.  13.) Find good self help books on the subject and about life in general and read them. (ex. Wild at Heart by John Elredge, 10 Lies Men Believe about Porn by Stephen Kuhn, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren)  14.) Join an online help community. Reddit has many subreddits tailored to many issues (GetMotivated, GetDisciplined, Pornfree, NoFapChristians, etc). It can be helpful sometimes to get encouragement/advice from others who understand what you are going through. You may also learn to look at your situation from a different perspective or even receive guidance on things you didn’t even know you were doing wrong.  15.) Clean up your living space. Organize yourself. A messy, unorganized environment can contribute to a disordered mind.  16.) Cut down on your technology usage. Whether on the computer, television, phone, cellphone, internet, whatever. This doesn’t mean getting rid of all technology. We live in a technological age. While it’s important to not let technology rule our lives, that doesn’t mean we need to escape from it and live as hermits. Analyze your technological routine. What devices you use. What sites you frequent. And ask yourself honestly whether you really need to do those things.  17.) Cold Showers can help a lot in the moment. Some choose to exclusively do these. But others prefer to do them sparingly when they find themselves in the heat of the moment. Find what works better for you.  18.) Take a walk outside everyday for at least 5 minutes. Not the kind you do on the treadmill. The kind that actually gets you somewhere. This can be an effective way of clearing the mind. When you take your walk, be sure to walk at a relaxed pace. There is no need to rush, otherwise you lose some of the benefits.   19.) Positive Affirmations. There are many ways to utilize these. You can either read and/or write them daily. Another way of utilizing these is recording yourself speaking these affirmations to yourself, and then listening to the recording daily. Some people record themselves speaking over music.  20.) Getting enough sleep is very important in preventing stress and increasing willpower. It’s understandable that not everyone can always get adequate sleep. Students and people with certain careers cannot sometimes meet these requirements. However, if it is in your power and ability to get adequate sleep, than do so. Also avoid staying up late after others in your household have gone to bed to reduce temptation to sin.  21.) Use an online website or app like chains.cc to keep track of which days you are successful and which days you fail. Doing so can sometimes reveal patterns.  22.) Look the part. You may have heard of studies that say the more you smile, the happier you feel (and not just the other way around). This is true and not only applies to smiling. If you are a man, shave and keep a clean look. Get a Haircut. Stand tall and not slouched over."

What new folks don't realize is that their first request for help immediately helps others. Amazing if you ask me.   Meanwhile as a first step you can share your last temptation to PMO and how you reacted and how you felt before and after.   Many of us struggle in many ways, but some of us struggle just like you do.   As for what to expect from our team, here's what I've learned after three weeks: you can expect to be challenged and encouraged in The Lord. I'm still pretty new but that's what I've had here since day one.  I've also made an attempt to engage honestly with a post or a comment every day. It's part of how I'm on hard mode (trophemius' Pentecost challenge) till may 24.   Praise God for his grace.   With great hope in Christ.   bA"
NoFapChristians,36ibb6,fapstronaut85,7,Tue May 19 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"Yes I believe I understand, but I still think there is room for growth and change. I don't think you need to fight sexual desire but I think you can continue to transmute it. I am astounded to find that I am in reach of what I never thought possible: a non-disordered sexual desire. I don't know if I will get there but just having fapped so little the last 6 months while paying more attention to resting in Christ has made a huge change. I notice the curves that used to put me in a sub-psychotic trance, but they don't have much effect over me. My whole concept of femininity and romance has changed. I want love, but I don't want to score. Platonic relationships are looking really good to me now. And if i were ever somehow in the situation where I would need to produce some more kids I would enjoy that and perform just fine, it's very unlikely that would happen and it maters not. But now it's more about real beauty, true relationship and love... at least my desire is.. and I slowly am recognizing that this more platonic desire of femininity is the desire for Christ. My actual given desire for Christ is what has been transmuted into sexuality for most of my life, held in bondage by PMO... it feels more real than ever now to be romanced and won over by Christ through my day to day life and especially by several of the people in it."
NoFapChristians,36ibb6,intensive_care,2,Wed May 20 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"beautiful. so much wisdom here.    but i don't want to score.    Powerful, IC. Powerful. I'm leaning the same way. I mean, I have this fire now. Why would I want to just extinguish that into a woman, and lose it? Only for love. Lust is a drain. Lust is a trap. It's a hell. Love, I am having faith in (because I haven't loved or been loved by an SO before), will transmute that explosion of energy, so I won't be drained.  At least that's the hope.   Do you find that you're really just in the mood to be on your own? That when you see a hot girl, you think to yourself, ""yeah, but would I really wanna spend time with her? I mean, what if she's really boring?"" I ask myself, ""Would I spend time with that person, if she were a guy?""   I am really glad that you've found something new in Christ. Christ is a transformer. He is the word of God. He is powerful. He makes all things new."
NoFapChristians,36ibb6,intensive_care,2,Wed May 20 23:21:02 2015 UTC,"I long for love, companionship and relationship, the ""hot"" part is not really doing it for me. I see a hot girl and I notice more how out of proportion she is on her high heel heels, how uncomfortable her tight pants look, how silly her aloof over confident gaze. I see why she is hot... but the heat is not effecting me... However I do still have a long way to go, today I was struggling with weird dreams, fantasies again, where a loving beautiful platonic relationship suddenly turns into sex... my Gremlin is working overtime to weasel his way into my thoughts and feelings... it's ok tho... I mean yesterday is when that fantasy started, I didn't stop it because I think I was putting a face on my longing for connectedness, my loneliness, it was truly platonic, I was looking at it, yeah sure I want beauty and romance for sure, what to do with it... and I was able to get up walk over and pour it all into my guitar... the longing / the pain / the desire it transmuted into beauty. The music just streamed out of me, or through me rather. It's pretty rare for me to pull that off..... in truth I didn't pull it off... it came from Him... It felt really good... but this is also where I fell... I took the credit... I felt I had done this.... And I know in the past where I played like that (back then required a good trip on soft drugs) I could really impress women... and for sure pride entered and the fantasy turned bad.... I was playing mind games with myself.. no longer trying to learn something... now trying to get something...really unhealthy  OK lesson learned. I believe that I hit on transmuting my wound into beauty for a bit. That is what I need to focus on. The fact that my human nature (aka Gremlin) started sidetracking and disordering that process was too bad, I let it go on too long, but it didn't derail me, I was able to shake it off and get to my senses.   All this is so much more free than I used to be. I am so grateful for this grace. Because I am sensing that with more prayer, more stillness, more awareness, I can let my feelings be and transmute them, accept my circumstances and pain as the vehicle for His beauty and love and truth to enter me... and offer Him back my little gifts of beauty... I don't know how this going to happen... but it feels somehow possible..."
NoFapChristians,36ibb6,iracundiarock,1 point,Thu May 21 00:37:17 2015 UTC,"i hope that it is. i'm at this point where i'm accepting that i have sexual desire, and where i can appreciate a woman's physical beauty, but at the same time recognize them for what it is. i mean, it's not all just an uncomfortable look. yeah, it probably is. those heels may be burning her bunions bad. i'd wonder if my little sister is okay dressed like that, like, who's attention is she trying to get?   but at hte same time, women are beautiful, and i am happy with being sexually turned on to them."
NoFapChristians,36ibb6,Blueaugustine,3,Sun May 24 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between admiring beauty and lusting. A fine line divides the two. I'm of the opinion that this line is wanting coition with the person without immediately stopping yourself from having that thought, which is lust, and that's definitely a sin. I think it's a little weird that you're not immediately trying to avoid coitionally desiring young girls, but I'm not going to judge. Men are separated from the animals by their control of themselves. The less control over my evil instincts, the more like an animal I become."

There is always a reason behind the lust. if you stop asking, ""Oh man, I have lust. Now, what do I do,"" and instead ask, ""Why am I lusting for this right now? I know it's wrong, so i won't do it, but why am i wanting this? What am I running from?"" That's a big step. if you can do that it could be a turning point in recovery."

NoFapChristians,36i0x9,intensive_care,3,Wed May 20 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"Your struggle is totally normal. Ppl who can just walk away from this are rare and are likely not addicted in the first place, who knows: they prob have other challenges where you or I have no problem.  Of course you have a chance. Your victory is assured as long as you do not stop loving Christ. And who cannot but love Christ? We all try and take shortcuts and grab for our favorite cookie jars, but we all really want true joy and true love and truth, it's just people are fooled into thinking they need what they want and can get what they want by their own devious devices. But in truth it is just confusion: we all want Christ no matter what we say or do or have done. Really despite all the confusion we are all in the state of being Peter, and Christ is constantly reminding us that we do truly love Him [John 21:15-17 NRSVCE]  Look it took me ten years, which is absurd, no way, now that you met me, is it going to take you ten years. Cause you can learn everything I learned the hard way in ten years in probably a couple months. Still we are all different, and the root of our problem may be different. I have no silver bullets, a bag of rusty nails, but used together, they will work. It is nothing unique.   Christ enters through our wounds. In that sense our wounds are a blessing. THe problem is we do not endure our wounds well and put poison ointment on them which numbs the pain for a while but ensnares and distracts us and blocks us from allowing Christ to enter.  Christ is Truth and Love [John 14:6 ] there is no truth or love in this world but what comes from Him. Getting to the root of your PMO addiction is getting to the root both of how you are dealing with your own wounds (these can be lies you are subconsciously clinging to since childhood, or from the common mentality, or who knows what) and also how you are perceiving the world around you. You are going to have to learn to discern when your mind is telling you the truth or when it is telling you a lie. You should try your utmost not to fall, but if you do fall even then continue to resist, by which I mean pray, fight to be aware, pay attention to what is going on in your mind, pay attention to what is really going on in the P. Falls are terrible but if we just go limp and fall into unconscious satanic reverie they are much worse, instead learn from them.  The truth is people are being brutalized and used in porn in ways you could likely not stomach if you were there to witness it, they are often very wounded people who have given up on life far more than us, care even less for their own true joy than we do, are broken children who came from God, in his image, and belong with God.... are somebodies child, sibling, parent... every attempt to shine a little light and truth on that darkness will help... in fact porn can lose it's hold on you... it becomes a disturbing disgusting abusive thing that you are no longer drawn to...  I would also recommend the nofapacademy.com, news letter and some vids are free, the course can be done in a month if need be, though it is better to take it slowly and meticulously.

I was forever clinging to that, somehow imagining that if I could pull amazing sex from my fantasies into the present I would be free. It's unbearable torture. We can let it go.

Freedom requires you to take responsibility for your life. Slavery just requires you to do what you're told.  Fortunately, we don't have to assume the burden of freedom alone.

NoFapChristians,36ijxg,Blueaugustine,2,Fri May 22 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"Roughly 36 days. I know it was more than a month, but not by much.  It was my first month of college. I had real friends for the first time in my life, I was doing things because I found them interesting instead of because I was told to, and it just seemed like a complete new start. Then it got old, and I got bored and frustrated, and went back to a lot of old habits; not just PMO.  It happened when I went home one weekend. This was before the ""P"" part of PMO was really significant. Our internet was filtered effectively where I went to school, and my parents' internet was really, really slow. I didn't start having real trouble with porn until my parents got broadband a few years later; not because I wasn't interested in it, but because I didn't have the patience to wait for the websites to load. But I remember that time as a significant event because I found a website that matched a particular interest of mine, for the first time. Nothing really weird or anything; just what I happen to like. Like a kind of diabolical coincidence.  So I gave in, and it was years before I even tried to quit again.  As for what I'm afraid of: I don't know that I'd call it fear, exactly. I just know that I am liable to fall. And there has been a strange lack of temptation these past two weeks. It feels like the calm before the storm."
NoFapChristians,36ijxg,advent2014,1 point,Fri May 22 08:41:41 2015 UTC,"That's helpful. I know the fear of a lack of temptation. That may be a partial flatline. Have you read about that phenomenon?  Also in the last ten years how have your interests developed? That's what was key in your first 36 days it sounds like: you were pursuing your passion at school. What are you passionate about today?  Last thought from reading your account. Boredom is a killer. Most people don't realize how deadly it can be. I take that to be a sign  that I have ""dissatisfaction with Gods will for me."" Obviously, for a NFC group, that's going to be super important, don't you think? So I wonder: is there any boredom in your life right now that you need to deal with?  With great hope in Christ  BA"
NoFapChristians,36ijxg,Blueaugustine,2,Fri May 22 12:23:14 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not a flatline. I still get erections fairly often, especially at night when I'm having trouble sleeping and my mind wanders to places it shouldn't, however briefly. It's just been a lot easier not to respond to the associated impulse than I'm used to.  My passions have definitely developed a lot since then. I'm writing a novel and a nonfiction book (on Christian ethics). Also, I've been writing worship music for years, but I'm only now at a church where I've been permitted to pursue it as a vocation. My previous church leadership thought that I was just showing off, and I rarely got the opportunity to share my compositions. So those are some big differences.   Boredom: not so much. Loneliness is a big problem, though. I live with a bunch of extreme introverts who find my need for interaction ""taxing"" to use their word (which seems unfair because I'm an introvert as well). I probably need to find a group of Christians to hang out with more often than once a week at church."

NoFapChristians,36fzxp,breakfree123,3,Tue May 19 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that. A big reminder is that you haven't lost until you give up. Don't give up. Keep powering forward. Analyze areas in your life that are triggering. Start new habits like daily exercise. Get into Scripture regularly. Pray constantly through the day. It is tough but keep striving after Christ and you will keep growing.  Prayers, lean on the Lord!"
NoFapChristians,36fzxp,on-a-journey,3,Tue May 19 04:54:19 2015 UTC,Just remember that through Christ all things are possible. Keep praying for God to give you the strength to overcome. Replace the temptation with Good. The bible says for us to flee this temptation - avoid all triggers and seek after God.
NoFapChristians,36fzxp,dungel78,3,Tue May 19 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"Christian  1.) Read the Bible every day. Don’t feel pressured to read for long stretches of time or read many passages in one sitting. Even if it’s just 1 chapter a day for 5 minutes. It’s better than nothing. Remember start small and grow bigger.  2.) If you are a young person. Make it a priority to read the Book of Proverbs in the Bible at least once a year. The book is Proverbs is unique in that it’s teachings/advice is geared more towards young people. The style of writing is also pretty straight forward and easy to read/understand in comparison to other books of the bible. Pray over the verses you feel convicted on and that you are not living up to.  3.) Worship is important. If you don’t have one, buy a hymnbook. Sing at least 1 song a day. There is a saying that “when the praise goes up, the blessings come down”. This is crucial. Not only that but you get better at singing.  4.) Prayer. This NEEDS to be done daily. You need to maintain that connection with the Father. Even when it feels all it lost. Even when you feel like no one is listening and you are speaking to a wall. You need to push through.  5.) Memorization of Biblical verses. This is also very important when it comes to refuting the lies the Devil tries to demoralize us. While it is important to learn a broad spectrum of biblical verses, it may help more to initially seek out verses that speak to the particular situation you are going through.  6.) Meditation. As with everything else, don’t feel pressured into having to do this for long stretches of time. Even if its just 5 minutes a day, again it’s better than nothing. It’s a start. And when you feel comfortable with/called to, you can increase the duration. Be sure to not confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation of Eastern Religions. Some Christians who do not know much about the subject tend to confuse mindful meditation with religious meditation. However, there is a significant difference. Mindful meditation is simply focusing on one’s breath in a comfortable position with no association with deities.  7.) Go to Church every Sunday. It’s necessary to maintain that social connection. In many cases, a lack of social interaction can manifest itself in negative ways, leading to us taking on negative outlets (addiction) to meet that need. And so we try to compensate for a lack of social interaction by acting out in bad ways. Also be sure to sing the songs. Do not remain silent as many do. Remember when the praises go up, the blessings come down. Be sure to pay attention to the sermon; who knows you may learn something that really speaks to your situation.  8.) If you are a young person, join your Church’s youth group. It can be a great place to make good friends and learn what it means to live out a Christian life.  9.) You need to fast. In Christianity, this is not an option. It is needed. Some people describe fasting as a means to accelerate the healing process, or receive answers more quickly. Others describe it as the metaphorical “grenade” in a Christian’s weapon arsenal. To be used when it feels like one is in stalemate with the enemy and is not gaining ground, or perhaps very little at a high cost.  10.) Confessing to someone. This can seem quite frightening at first, especially if you have been hiding certain unsavory behaviours. But this is a necessary part of the healing process. It helps relieve one of heavy burdens as you are no longer keeping secrets. It also frees up that energy you put towards hiding the addiction, which you can use to actually fight it.  If you feel convicted to confess to a certain someone, then that is likely the Holy Spirit convicting you. Be sure not to make the mistake of minimizing the situation. As in, make sure you mention the fact that you have an “addiction”. And that what you are speaking of was not merely a onetime occurrence that you are feeling guilty of. This can save you a lot of trouble and heartache in the future. And help others to take you seriously.  Practical Things  11.) Exercise/Working out. You need a mixture of both cardio and weight training to deal with urges and lead a healthy life.  12.) Install an Internet Filter. K9 is effective for use on computers. OpenDNS is effective for use of both phones and computers (this one, however, is installed on your router). Both are free. Get someone else to put in the password and use their email address for the password recovery option so that the software is not easy to bypass. Some other people use Covenant Eyes software for accountability. That, however, is not free currently with a monthly fee.  13.) Find good self help books on the subject and about life in general and read them. (ex. Wild at Heart by John Elredge, 10 Lies Men Believe about Porn by Stephen Kuhn, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren)  14.) Join an online help community. Reddit has many subreddits tailored to many issues (GetMotivated, GetDisciplined, Pornfree, NoFapChristians, etc). It can be helpful sometimes to get encouragement/advice from others who understand what you are going through. You may also learn to look at your situation from a different perspective or even receive guidance on things you didn’t even know you were doing wrong.  15.) Clean up your living space. Organize yourself. A messy, unorganized environment can contribute to a disordered mind.  16.) Cut down on your technology usage. Whether on the computer, television, phone, cellphone, internet, whatever. This doesn’t mean getting rid of all technology. We live in a technological age. While it’s important to not let technology rule our lives, that doesn’t mean we need to escape from it and live as hermits. Analyze your technological routine. What devices you use. What sites you frequent. And ask yourself honestly whether you really need to do those things.  17.) Cold Showers can help a lot in the moment. Some choose to exclusively do these. But others prefer to do them sparingly when they find themselves in the heat of the moment. Find what works better for you.  18.) Take a walk outside everyday for at least 5 minutes. Not the kind you do on the treadmill. The kind that actually gets you somewhere. This can be an effective way of clearing the mind. When you take your walk, be sure to walk at a relaxed pace. There is no need to rush, otherwise you lose some of the benefits.  19.) Positive Affirmations. There are many ways to utilize these. You can either read and/or write them daily. Another way of utilizing these is recording yourself speaking these affirmations to yourself, and then listening to the recording daily. Some people record themselves speaking over music.  20.) Getting enough sleep is very important in preventing stress and increasing willpower. It’s understandable that not everyone can always get adequate sleep. Students and people with certain careers cannot sometimes meet these requirements. However, if it is in your power and ability to get adequate sleep, than do so. Also avoid staying up late after others in your household have gone to bed to reduce temptation to sin.  21.) Use an online website or app like chains.cc to keep track of which days you are successful and which days you fail. Doing so can sometimes reveal patterns.  22.) Look the part. You may have heard of studies that say the more you smile, the happier you feel (and not just the other way around). This is true and not only applies to smiling. If you are a man, shave and keep a clean look. Get a Haircut. Stand tall and not slouched over."

NoFapChristians,36fzxp,Blueaugustine,2,Wed May 20 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"Yes I know this well. Basically I used PMO to help with my emotional issues. When other aspects of my life were going well pulling PMO-free streaks was easy, but when things were not going well I was completely at the mercy of my urges. Anyway you should use anything you can to train yourself to get comfortable with the discomfort of your emotional issue and as well as the discomfort of PMO. (exercise, diet, cold showers is a great way to practice this outside of the PMO arena, and all these things will make you feel better so it's a double whammy). But you also need to unravel all the lies that are at the root of these urges. For that do what BlueAugustine says"
NoFapChristians,36fzxp,intensive_care,2,Tue May 19 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"Might I also suggest, if you haven't, go to Church.  For years I just went to the same old Catholic church that my parents went to.  To me, mass meant nothing, did nothing.  I fell away for a while mostly because I didn't feel a connection to any community.    Fast forward a bit.  I was lucky enough to have found a different church that felt more like home.  In this case, it was a Methodist church.  I don't care so much about denomination- what is important to me is that sense of community, a sense of belonging.  Finding that really helped me focus on Christ.  For one reason or another I stopped going for a period.  Low and behold, I went back to my old ways.  Then, once I reconnected, I was once again focused.  Having that community is important imo."

NoFapChristians,36fbs6,DeXiZ,1 point,Mon May 18 23:08:38 2015 UTC,"Great. Yeah it's the nature of addiction: you are at war with yourself, part of your brain is working overtime to convince, lie, trick you, that you will be better to get another fix. At the same time you likely have a very low tolerance for discomfort and you are used to giving in.   The good news is that as impossible as it seems it really is doable. And getting a handle on that part of your brain that is a weasel and keeping you down is a very good thing to learn. But it is a process you need to keep at it, keep on getting up if you are knocked down, and over time you will find truth and freedom and feel closer to Christ.  beware tho: guilt is part of the addictive cycle. It serves as a signal something is wrong. But it is dangerous to rely on it to get you out, because the initial impetus it gives will, in time, become an impetus back into falling.

NoFapChristians,36euqu,vxlccm,2,Mon May 18 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"Wanting repentance is a good Step 1. Jesus paid the price and walked the perfect walk. Lean on Him, reach out and take His hand; He'll carry you if necessary. You must, though, have strong faith and seek after that personal relationship with your Savior and mine.  Wouldn't you say is what you want is forgiveness, though? So, the step of forsaking sin and not doing it ever again is crucial in terms of not adding more baggage. Maybe you can't do it all at once. But, be working on it while also strengthening your prayers and relationship with God. It will happen. The devil is real and has scary power, but he can't ever win against our God."

One thing that I just noticed in your post was when you said that the people you were living with went away. Don't underestimate the human need for intimacy.   When I say intimacy, I don't necessarily mean only the sexual kind of intimacy. You can have intimacy between close friends and family. Even God doesn't underestimate the need for human connection in the bible, don't make the same mistake yourself.  Don’t stop meeting together with other believers, which some people have gotten into the habit of doing. Instead, encourage each other, especially as you see the day drawing near. - Hebrews 10:25  The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone.

I've gone long times without fapping and I've had times (like now) where it is incredibly hard. Something that I've come to realize is that we never really get over our sexuality and that's a good thing! We are sexual creatures by design. God's first command for humanity was to have sex essentially. So it will never go away completely. However, that doesn't mean you are going to struggle like this forever. Just like anything other training it starts out slow and day to day growth isn't very measurable but over the long term huge things are happening!

But, man, do I wish I would have listened to ANYone, and stayed away from this evil so many years ago as a youth.  As part of Christ's atonement, though, He took on our burdens. He also took our stripes and paid the price. He understands perfectly. Best to put our trust in the Lord than in any man who may very well be working on good things, but of course isn't perfect.  The cycles and spirals you are in are so very common. You really are not alone. Just do it. Break out, get motivated any way you can. Get better habits. The journey for me has been very long. I'm realizing even this year (even after 3 years of no PMO or MO), that I've still wandered into Psubs way too often, so I've made a renewed effort to kick that in the rear, to STOP. In church, we talk about repenting of sin pretty often. Mentioned often as first steps for SA / AA or anything else is to know it's wrong, feel bad (2 Cor. 7:10), and stop doing it. Those steps all come before forgiveness. My repentance always feels difficult until that step of stopping is well underway."

A few months ago, I was just where you are.  I had a few decent streaks under my belt, but significant progress seemed unattainable.  I told myself that I wouldn't let myself graduate from college without making major progress on this problem.  I told myself that fapping was not an option at this point.  I tried to simply dismiss urges as much as possible.  And it worked.  Read my 90 day post for more details (seriously).  Now, I feel quite confident that I can go for a very long time.  In short, you do have the power, and you need to stop kidding yourself by saying that you can't.  ""Go and sin no more."""

After that, the rest is 'real life' and not 'surreal' being bound in chains. Trust me, I did /not/ have the power, but Christ did. Some days, I do okay on my own, but often I still don't have the power, but He always does."
NoFapChristians,36euqu,jmorin17,2,Wed May 20 04:57:16 2015 UTC,"some good methods   The Joseph Method- physically remove yourself from the temptation, and run towards people that you wouldn't sin in front of. Desert Response- Like Christ did in the wilderness, use a short but effective portion of the bible to avert temptation. Requires a good fear of the Lord Prayer and fasting Christian support- confessing your sins to a bro/sis in Christ. Being around them when you are tempted. Reciprocating as an accountability partner. Ceremony- do something out of the ordinary to mark your first day. Maybe create a new arbitrary ritual that reminds you of your nofap dream."

When you have that urge and put it aside, even just for one more day, He doesn't get upset that you were tempted, He exalts that you didn't give in.  God isn't some presence from on high, watching you from a distance, He is right there with you, going through this hard time along side you.  There will be times you will feel alone during this part, but don't let yourself believe that for too long.  And from a guy who was dealing with this problem throughout a marriage, see this as a wedding present to her.  You will get this other presence in your relationship out before you get married.  Because that's what this particular addiction is in a marriage, it's like having a third, destructive party in the marriage.

Covenant Eyes has helped greatly tho (and I can improve the software be reporting adult sites that the program hasn't picked up), slowing down my actions enough for God to edge his way into my mind and remind me what I should be fighting for. I'm not going to pretend at all that one day on my own I'll have the strength to overcome this, no way. It's gonna take some good software measures and a devoted spiritual life to tackle this one.  As far as shame goes, I'm over it. No temptation has overcome you such as is common to man. I encourage you to find a Christian brother that you trust to confide in about the issue, or a support group. If you keep this thing to yourself you'll just implode over and over again."

OK, Any 12-steps is good, they are all based on Christian principles but worded in such a way as to be accessible to anyone (it's easy to map them back to our faith explicitly).   I would cast as wide a net as possible. It's easy to go through a handful of pastor's / counselors / therapists each and get little or nothing, and you might hit one who really helps you, most likely all will help a little in some different way. You have to develop a sense of when you think you've made as much progress as you can with a particular professional. But there is no reason not to double up. Therapists at their best, tend to have little in the way of specific help to get out of this addiction, but they can be very good in helping you dig up emotional issues that are likely at the root of this.  Anyway I just wanted to convey my urgency to you to get as much help as you possibly can and do as much work as you possibly can. It took me 10 years to get to where I am now because I was just fighting symptoms.

I tend to wait with the push ups till the muscle soreness is mostly gone, which can be 2 or 3 days, then I try to do more than i did previous time, usually around 10 percent more. I also don't make the goal to do them all in one stretch. Rather I take 5 minute breaks. So while I am getting up in the morning I hit the deck every 5 minutes for 5 times. So in a couple days try and see if you can do one proper pushup, wait 5 min do another... gradually work your way up.

The first week or two you have the surge and sexual desire is really high. After that sexual urge stays fairly constant up until 2-3 months. Then a lot of people go through what you are which is referred to as the flat line. This is when you loose most sexual motivation. This has it's own set of problems though because you start to feel numb. You worry that you are never going to feel sexual again. However, this too passes and you come back into a normal sexuality. I think it's all part of the rebooting process and you have to power through the different stages and adjust your battle plan.  Keep going!  Prayers, lean on the Lord!"

NoFapChristians,36bfix,trophenius,1 point,Tue May 19 08:34:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. So your current streak is how long?  Earlier someone talked about not ONLY counting streaks without failure or slips. But counting the whole year, how do we look as for the trend of the whole year?  Eg, if you have two 90 day streaks in a row with a two day break/reset in between that's 180 days with only two fail days.   Problem is that it is harder to bounce back than people realize. At least it has been for me.   But in the end as others have said it is all about one day at a time. ""Each day has enough trouble if it's own."" (Mat 6)  With great hope in Christ  BA"
NoFapChristians,36bfix,Blueaugustine,2,Mon May 18 12:16:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting...BA.I have considered the clean time as opposed to the 'down' time and the clean time far outweighs the relapse time...It's quite helpful to consider that even after 100 day streak and a two day relapse,we are still way ahead of where we were at the beginning.Sure the badge honestly reports increments of time in which we were successful in our struggle but we should try not to let the miniscule relapse time begin to overwhelm us.It's quite helpful to think that yes,i relapsed and reset after a two day foray into the darkness,but before that i had accomplished way more than my original objective of 90 days...this encourages me to add another day to my over all clean time and say ""no"" to another day of my relapse time...in the end,we look better than we think,which is not to give us an exaggerated sense of 'self' but a realistic one..if we are back,doing NoFap a day at a time,regardless of a brief failure,we haven't lost anything other than a few days and we have gained a world in humility and love for the merciful Christ...do you agree? If we learned to do this,i believe it would be more  honoring to God and cause us less of a maudlin sense of failure and self-accusation making restoration far less difficult in the long run.stay strong."

And though my counter will still read Day 1 with the happy face even after tomorrow, I believe each hour can be a time of growth and strengthening...which means I cannot dwell on my past failure....as hard as it will be to do.

In a way you get out of it what you put into it.   The obsession over porn and lust and masturbation works on a spiritual and a physical level to eat you up from within. It takes time to eliminate those urges and requires hard work of figuring out the idolatry and satisfaction you are really seeking.   But the work Is worth it.   Make a point to post every day for a week. Good, bad, or ugly. You are worth it. But even more, the glory of God and the beauty of His grace is far more worth it.   You asked me about my 2 days. I remember in this current run of 30+ days that the first two days seemed almost pointless or meaningless. But i didn't think about it.  I just did it. But I was doing more than just noFap. I was actively seeking to put pieces in place to prevent going back again.   Confession to Christian friends. To my wife.  New blocks in the computer and phone. Restarted reading my Bible.   Not rocket science, but not easy either.   With Great Hope in Christ, BA"

I pray this,the third time, will be different. All I can say is that right now as I am typing this I feel stronger and more prepared as I approach 5 pm and the rest of the night. Interestingly I just saw and walked by this beautiful young lady who I passed up partly or mainly due to my sexual sins. I think she has given up on me and has moved on. It's been a whole school year and she's about to graduate. Any way I'm feeling great on Day 9 and I believe this is it! I hope that you are walking the straight and narrow as well.

Sheen  It's easy to fall into a thinking pattern where you feel God won't do you any favors because you have offended Him but you are missing a crucial factor of our faith. God's love is UNCONDITIONAL. This means His love for you is not dependent upon your actions, behavior or sins.  Now, it's vital to understand that God's unconditional love is NOT license to sin. Sin is a grave action against God and ""the wages of sin is death."" But do not allow yourself to be convinced that God loves you less because you have failed. He sees, and knows, that you are earnestly attempting to rectify your life and abandon your sinful ways.  I'd say 83 days is a hell of a good streak. Be proud. Sure, you faltered and failed, but run right into the arms of the most merciful and take comfort in knowing that God loves you, is by your side and will NEVER abandon you."

NoFapChristians,36ae55,Blueaugustine,2,Tue May 19 20:21:11 2015 UTC,I like your instinct. Of course what is here attributed to the Word is elsewhere in Gods word attributed to the Holy Spirit.   I take that to point to the relative ambiguity between the author of grace (our triune God) and the means of grace (the scriptures). Sometimes what is said of one and what is true of one is attributed to the other.   Thoughts?  With great hope in Christ  BA

Do you mean others who are lost salvation is on the line because we need to tell them? Or ours is? Because I'm pretty sure when I confessed my sins and said Jesus was Lord I was saved and no sin can take that away. I totally agree one sin leads to another.

Really hear the desire there coming thru and besides, there is nothing like making ourselves ""pay"" for the sin.   KrazyTennis made a good point about salvation: the anxiety and depression it brings on us is a real robber. It steals assurance of salvation but Jesus Christ fully paid for my sin and therefore my salvation rests in him not in my performance.   Still Hebrews is full of warnings against presumption as are the seven letters to the churches in revelation. We must be careful to presume upon gods grace. But still strive to walk by faith in him who rose from the dead.  Last thing: I learned this thing is a lifelong battle. Make progress now. You may need to keep pressing in to this in the future. But don't let that keep you from pursuing Christ 100% today.   But don't quit.

I'm 22 now and a few years back I would have lied my ass off before confessing any of this. But remember that every guy you know goes through the same thing.

NoFapChristians,3683i4,overcoming_porn,1 point,Mon May 18 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, I understand how you feel. I hid my addiction for a long time because I was so ashamed of it. I can't tell how relieved I felt when I started opening up to strong male christian men in my life about my struggles. I know have a group of guys who I can share with. Some who have never struggled in this area, some who have struggled in the past, and some how are struggling in the present like myself. You don't have to open up to every person in your life, but hiding behind the shame of the addiction will only continue to give it life. I'll be praying that God will give you the courage to open up and talk about your sin with someone who will listen and accept you irregardless of your sin."
NoFapChristians,3683i4,dryay003,3,Tue May 19 19:05:25 2015 UTC,"It's awesome that you are a teenage christian trying to live a Holy life. I applaud people like you. When I was 16 I wasn't a christian that was the furthest thing in my mind. I was obsessed with sex. The advice I can give you is to not be to hard on yourself. The road that you have chosen is a hard one but the bible says we must endure and persevere. I know it's easier said than done my friend but believe in God. Believe that He will set you free. What I find helps is if you start lusting, or thinking lustful things immediately start praying or read the bible. It will bring a Holy conviction upon you and hopefully prevent you from watching porn.  Edit: also avoid temptation bro! don't go looking at a certain persons profile on facebook or instagram or whatever and start lusting. stay away from Jezebels! keep your eyes on God. Let Him consume your thoughts."

NoFapChristians,3683i4,Orthodoxical,2,Sun Jun 14 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"Something that I think helps is talking to God not just about being sorry for looking at porn. But really talk to Him about what you saw, for how long, how it made you feel (both good and bad), your state of mind and emotion leading into it, how you felt afterward. I think it'll be cathartic and may help you work out some of your own issues as you really try to explain to God what is going on in your life."

NoFapChristians,3683i4,Boomer1991,2,Sun May 17 03:35:58 2015 UTC,It's better to get things like that off your chest man. You need to be real with God and explain in detail of the sin you've committed.
NoFapChristians,3683i4,Orthodoxical,2,Sun May 17 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yup. Because let's be real, God already knows. It's you that needs to be able to talk about it to Him."
NoFapChristians,3683i4,danielbryan22,2,Mon May 18 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"There's a saying by Henry Ford — 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.' Bible also says 'as he thinketh in his heart, so is he'. (Proverbs 23)  Thing is my friend, you absolutely can stop watching porn for a lifetime. No doubt about it. There is no-one physically pulling your eyeballs to a screen... But mentally, we have a tug of war happening. Coming out and saying you feel like you'll never do it is settling to let the wrong side win the tug of war.  The fact that you have done it for one or two days tells you there is potential for more by God's grace. 3 days, 5 days, 1 week, 1 month... Do babies stay under a foot long forever? You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you. (Philippians 4)  And from my experience, try and get over feeling you can't go back to God. Frankly, that's the endgame of porn, to separate you from God. But Jesus came for those who need to turn away from sin. (Luke 4) He has a throne of grace that we must seek mercy from and ask for help in our time of need - fighting back against this temptation. (Hebrews 4)  Edit - I feel you on the 'everyone thinks I'm a good Christian'. It's hard to have anyone look up to as someone with integrity and know it's not the same in reality. But Let's work toward making the real you and the image of you the same.  Sorry for the long post but there are certain moves you got to make to break down this thing forever. The first move is believing it's possible with God. Before accountability, before setting boundaries... Know it can be done. God will hold you together."
NoFapChristians,3683i4,chaos_walks,2,Sun May 17 06:37:44 2015 UTC,"I was where you are now and I know it seems hard and almost impossible but God can and will help you and you will conquer this sin! I found that dwelling on the sin is bad, stop hating yourself, the guilt will eat at you. Instead focus on the Lord and all things good, focus on living a Godly life.      I would recommend making sure you are disciplined in all things because this will help you be disciplined to not watch porn and masturbate. Pray regularly, read your bible regularly, exercise regularly, make sure you are sleeping and eating well, be disciplined when you use the internet (maybe switch off all devices after a certain time?).      In the book of Matthew Jesus describes how we should pray: ""And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."" So pray that. Everyday. You have the strength for this! I will be praying for you."

NoFapChristians,3683i4,BLoyola,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"It's hard.  The only way to stop is to really be in that constant prayer with Jesus, and to ask Jesus how to spend your day each morning.  I've been there too (and I'm a female) but if you feel regret that's good.  It means you're not too far gone.  Your heart hardens when you take yourself away from God, so eventually if someone sins so much they won't even feel any remorse or anything anymore.  They'll know they're destined for hell and will just be apathetic.  Remorse is a good thing.  It's a one day at a time thing.  Christianity is dying to self.  That's the struggle.  Self-assessment.  Figuring out, how can I put OTHERS first today and not live for pleasure?"
NoFapChristians,3683i4,Kraahkan,1 point,Mon May 18 08:01:05 2015 UTC,"Hey brother, I know how you feel.  I'm 18, and after a year of freedom I feel back into this mess.  I'll give you some things I've learned the hard way, but always remember, there is hope, and his name is Jesus.  Jesus died for our sins, so we don't have to feel condemnation over what we've done.  Guilt is from the Enemy (Satan), and as followers of Jesus we don't have to live in it.  Our sin is so bad, Jesus had to die for it.  But the good news is that he loved us so much that he died in our place.  It is finished, and we are not alone in our fight.  Through Jesus death the Spirit of God has been made available to us. If we have been baptized in the name of Jesus, the Spirit is with us and in us. So if you haven't been baptized, do it.  We need the presence and power of God in our lives if we are ever going to live in holiness.  I'm not there yet, I am getting baptized soon but delayed it for the longest time.  Now I know that fighting on my own is impossible.  Surround yourself with godly men, particularly your own age.  This was a big mistake I made. Paul tells Timothy, a man who probably wasn't a lot older then us, to ""flee youthful lusts,"" and to pursue godliness with other believers (2 Timothy 2:22).  We can run all we want from sin, but if we don't have a destination (Jesus), and people to run with (brothers & sisters in the Church) our struggle is hopeless.  Don't fight sin, flee from it, and don't do it alone.  Also, remove temptation from you.  In James' letter, he talks about how we have a say in how much we are tempted.  God doesn't tempt us, he always may give us a way out when we are tempted (1 Cor 10:13), but we often have a say in the temptation in the first place.  So remove temptation from your life.  I never sleep with my phone any more, or any electronics in my room.  I read the scriptures before bed now, and endeavour to do the same as I wake up.  Accountability is good too, because it can lessen the temptation in some ways.    We need to live in truth, so confess this to people you really trust and know will be there for you.  It's hard and good, and though it can be hard to find brothers who will join with, it is the best when you do.  Fill your mind with truth, read the scriptures, make sure the Kingdom of God is having more of an influence on your life then the bits of our culture that are against his Kingdom ('the World').  TLDR;  Don't give up, trust in Jesus for your sin, depend and live by the Spirit, read the Scriptures, and fight the good fight (or flee sexual sin in this case) with brothers/sisters in the faith.  Don't be discouraged, there is victory to be had!  Sometimes all we see is defeat, and we begin to believe that is all there is.  But that's a lie the Enemy would have us believe.  God's Kingdom can be hard to see sometimes, but that doesn't mean he is not there.  We are not living for this world, but in the hope of Jesus resurrection.  Grace & peace, God bless. Joshua"

Listen, I know this might be a fun little joke for you and your immature buddies, but this subreddit is for people who are truly trying to better themselves.  It doesn't matter what your religious background is, the fact of the matter is that Porn is completely negative.  The discrimination against women, the objectification of sex, and the instillation of lust into the minds and hearts of all viewers is destructive.  It doesn't matter how ""sexual"" humans are, porn is completely counterproductive to a society many people are struggling to create.  So Please, continue twiddling your little dick to whatever floats your boat, keep chastising those who recognize their iniquities, and hopefully by the end of the day, we will see you back here asking for guidance rather than spewing garbage.
