rickandmorty,3e17y7,Balevant,7,Tue Jul 21 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly recommend Bojack Horseman on Netflix. It's an extremely well written comedy in the same vein as Rick and Morty, in my opinion."

rickandmorty,3e17y7,scratcher-cat,4,Tue Jul 21 12:11:56 2015 UTC,I have trouble with the current state of the past 2 seasons of Archer.  There have been a lot more MISS episodes than hit.  the show is actually developing backwards a lot of the times.
rickandmorty,3e17y7,Adventuredditor,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:33 2015 UTC,"Just hold out, it's gets better. Additionally you can stand the first two seasons of Adventure Time it develops into a beautiful story with a chaotic timeline and dark notes in the humor.  Steven Universe is also well worth a watch, through a whole season. The art alone is well done enough to enjoy."

I got into Adventure Time a while back, followed by My Little Pony, Steven Universe, and now this. I'm pretty close to checking out Gravity Falls too.   Far as I can tell, they're all good for different reasons. Though, if you want more Rick and Morty, watch Back to the Future. It's basically this, if Rick was generally a nice guy."

rickandmorty,3e2z1v,DjCbal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:29 2015 UTC,I think that eye-patch Morty is going to play a large part in the drama of the second season. Could he be the robot Morty from the opening sequence of the show? I guess we'll see...   I'm also hoping that we get more of the gang's home life since it was pretty absent in the first two episodes of season 2.

At the time (October 2006) I had nothing to lose and my original intention was to call this ""back to the future: the new official universal studios cartoon featuring the new Doc Brown and Marty McFly"" and then I'd just sit back and wait for a letter from their lawyers to arrive. That's actually why it's so filthy. I was just looking to ""troll"" a big studio. Then, as I began editing the radio play and boarding it, the two characters ended up becoming something different than just a bad impression of Doc and Marty from BTTF. They slowly became two of my favorite characters that I've ever voiced. I backed down on the cease and desist bait and changed the spelling of their names and whatever else I could still change. I mean, it's still ultimately a back to the future joke/ (parody?), but to me all these years later, these two characters have become something of their own.

My favorites aside from Rick & Morty commentary have always been Venture Bros commentary with Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick and the Batman: TAS/Batman Beyond commentary just because it was odd listening to their thoughts on everything when shit got way too dark for a kids show and in the case of TAS, understanding why things were as tame as they were at times/what limits they had on them."

rickandmorty,3dvtch,Spenc33,2,Mon Jul 20 00:04:35 2015 UTC,I think Rick has always hated Jerry for being an idiot. I think part of the reason he hates him is part of his love for his daughter... he sees that his daughter has sacrificed her dreams and he blames Jerry for that. His paternal insticts are just kicking in. You can also see that in his love for his grandchildren. You can tell he doesn't blame any of them for Beth's unhappiness... just Jerry.

rickandmorty,3dotfg,BeerMeAlready,2,Sat Jul 18 13:24:45 2015 UTC,PVR counts too. So everyone record it and help the show.
rickandmorty,3dotfg,ranger2408,0,Sat Jul 18 18:01:12 2015 UTC,Pretty much every cable or satellite box is a Nielsen counter nowadays.

rickandmorty,3dotfg,seanachan,4,Sat Jul 18 14:45:40 2015 UTC,Note that the special boxes with actual tracking are just a small subset of their survey. The bulk of it are these self-reporting journals they mail out with a bit of cash.

rickandmorty,3dmf2k,HaikusfromBuddha,10,Fri Jul 17 23:42:49 2015 UTC,WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANTS ON YOUR EYES!?
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,RuthlessGreed,10,Sat Jul 18 02:17:38 2015 UTC,"""Our Rick"" (a.k.a. the one that appears in the show) is the Rickest Rick He is referred to by the Council of Ricks as being from dimension C-137 The Rickest Rick does not reside in the dimension he was (as far as we know) born in.  That originating dimension was totally Cronenberged by Rick in a bit of an accident.  So he found a dimension that was nice but the Rick and Morty had recently died in (but the family wasn't aware of the fact) and he and his Morty moved in   So the question was is the dimension that is classified as ""C-137"" the originating dimension (the one in which the Earth had been Cronenberg'd) or the one that the Rickest Rick now resides in (leading to the twin questions of is the Council of Ricks aware of the switch, and if they classify you by your originating dimension or the one you currently call ""home"")?"
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,Nymaz,3,Sat Jul 18 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"I figured Cronenberg'd is C-137 since Rickest Rick mentioned he had troubles in the past with the Council of Ricks and it seems they have a pretty good system to identify Ricks, so it would seem poor form for them to not be able to identify what ricks are what."
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,TheMightyBarbarian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:13:16 2015 UTC,What was “cronenberging“ again?
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,HubertTempleton,3,Sat Jul 18 10:14:22 2015 UTC,"In Rick Potion No. 9, through a series of virally induced mutations, Rick ends up turning every human on Earth (save Jerry, Beth, and Summer) into blobby creatures.  He calls them Cronenbergs, after the director David Cronenberg who has made several films in which people are transformed into monsters.  Rick realizes he's gone to far to fix things and they bail on the dimension.  Subsequently a blobby monster Rick and Morty move into the dimension commenting how glad they found a good dimension after screwing up and turning all the blobby monster humans on Earth into normal humans."
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,Nymaz,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:17 2015 UTC,I think it's when they turned the everyone into monsters.
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,s2514,0,Sat Jul 18 10:52:35 2015 UTC,I think this is a better nocontext post than the one you're explaining.
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,PBborn,13,Sat Jul 18 09:36:08 2015 UTC,Has it even been established that we're looking at the same Rick and Morty each episode?  Edit: I guess there are occasional references to past events. Is that enough?
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,verticalfuzz,17,Fri Jul 17 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've talked about their past adventures before. Morty also told Summer about how him and Rick ""died."""

rickandmorty,3dmf2k,TheOnlyArtifex,7,Sat Jul 18 00:07:10 2015 UTC,Seems unlikely that both of them would refuse to join the council of ricks. But it might have been one of the paremeters rickest rick was using when selecting a new earth.
rickandmorty,3dmf2k,lolloboy140,5,Fri Jul 17 21:29:29 2015 UTC,"are you accounting for the likelihood that ""our"" rick came from another dimension to replace a dead rick? he has memories of morty as a baby but ""our"" beth thinks he's been gone for longer than morty has been alive.

Rick was not in their lives for a long time, suddenly he shows up and he decides to return to his family? Why? I think something happened to main Rick, and he chose to enter a different dimension where there was a Morty without a Rick, and just kinda took his place. So to them it was Rick coming back, and to Rick, it was about staying where he's always been."

I think the idea of a more Morty-centric episode, where he really takes over the development of the episode (similar to Meeseeks and Destroy) wouldn't be a bad thing.  Don't get me wrong...I like the Rick, but part of his role is covering for Morty. It'd be interesting to see what Morty can do if left to his own devices with Rick's tech."

rickandmorty,3dp785,Muntberg,6,Sun Jul 19 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"They've basically said it won't be touched upon in Season 2. The idea is not to rely on call-backs to Season 1 but instead create a season of mostly new, original ideas that will grow the R&M universe.   They did say they'll be coming back to it at some point though. Which I think is great because we're pretty much guaranteed more seasons of Rick and Morty at this point."
rickandmorty,3dp785,Vermillion-,3,Sat Jul 18 04:57:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I think it'd be worth circling back to every once in a blue moon, even if its a random reference back to evil genius Morty monitoring Rick and Morty during an episode, say in a crowd or something. But, then again, that's why I'm not in that business.  Hopefully when they finally make that reference back to evil genius Morty they give around 15 minutes of back story about what happened... I mean, did he lead a Morty revolution or escape and use a bunch of lost Ricktech? Inquiring minds want to know!  Either way, as long as it results in more episodes and seasons, I'm good with it."
rickandmorty,3dp785,Firebat12,2,Sat Jul 18 05:07:09 2015 UTC,It could even have been a Rick that made himself look like a Morty... who know? There are infinite realities and therefore infinite reasons why a Morty could be smarter than a Rick.

rickandmorty,3dk4nd,Gunmansam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:20:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of like the fact they started s2 off with continuity. For this show it seems rare, but the way they handle it is pretty good."
rickandmorty,3dk4nd,FreeRange_Seacows,-7,Fri Jul 17 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"It occured to me the other day, it would be better if there was only the one and only first season. There's no way they can do better. Everything else will pale in comparison. Expectations are way too high. They're going to overdo the burping/belching, repeating phrases, stammering, in an effort to try and keep it authentic, but they'll just become annoying. They'll try to come up with more odd, nonsensical stuff like ants-in-my-eyes Johnson, but the appeal of that was the originality and absurdity. There's no real joke there. But they'll try to ""redo"" it, and it'll just come across as ""already done"". And finally, they'll reskin the chairs ordering pizzas, one large phone with extra phones, please. Cellphone! No, no, no, rotary, with payphone on top. But it'll be about something else, but with the same beats. And then we'll know it's over."
rickandmorty,3dk4nd,IdentifyingString,7,Fri Jul 17 03:26:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I'm not sure if you watched the leaked episodes but the second episode was very unique with a lot of parts that have not been done before and better yet, were unexpected.  Also i would recommend going into the season with a positive attitude about it, if you're going to be negative you're going to force a negative reaction out of yourself."
rickandmorty,3dk4nd,Morty777,2,Fri Jul 17 07:12:22 2015 UTC,"yea, i thought they might run out of ideas until I saw the leaked episodes.  then it hit me, when your plot takes place in infinite dimensions with infinite possibilities, it is kind of hard to run out of ideas, seeing the direction things are going, they hopefully will keep the good flow of ideas coming through"
rickandmorty,3dk4nd,ElFlame,2,Fri Jul 17 10:13:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they have so many possibilities to explore and the writers are so clever I'm not worried about them running out of ideas for a long time.

""Clearing the neighbourhood around its orbit"" is a criterion for a celestial body to be considered a planet in the Solar System. This was one of the three criteria adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in its 2006 definition of planet.[1]  In the end stages of planet formation, a planet will have ""cleared the neighbourhood"" of its own orbital zone (see below), meaning it has become gravitationally dominant, and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its own satellites or those otherwise under its gravitational influence. A large body which meets the other criteria for a planet but has not cleared its neighbourhood is classified as a dwarf planet. This includes Pluto, which shares its orbital neighbourhood with Kuiper belt objects such as the plutinos. The IAU's definition does not attach specific numbers or equations to this term, but all the planets have cleared their neighbourhoods to a much greater extent than any dwarf planet, or any candidate for dwarf planet.   These people have no idea what they are talking about.  Thank you wikipedia"

rickandmorty,3denff,Mentalpatient87,4,Wed Jul 15 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"Rick searched through the multiverse via the goggles seen in ricksty minutes to find a universe that was similar to his in which he found a cure he and one in which morty die shortly after arrival. There is an infinite number of universes so the possibilities are endless. I would like to think that taking the place of a Rick in his home dimension would be frowned upon by the council but they never really mention it, so maybe it happens all the time and is a known ""out"" for ricks. I also have a feeling that we haven't seen the last of evil morty."
rickandmorty,3denff,Halfonion,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"Not to mention too, Rick afterward says to Morty ""We have to be more careful. We only get like... 12 more of these."""
rickandmorty,3denff,noahfischel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:45 2015 UTC,"""three maybe four tops!"" Alot of people on here think thats Rick speaking directly to the audiance stating that we wouldnt like it if they kept on using that method to get them out of their messes."
rickandmorty,3denff,Halfonion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:12:15 2015 UTC,Except Evil Rick told Rick he wanted him to find them. That wouldn't make sense if he killed off the Rick who died in Rick Potion #9.
rickandmorty,3denff,Psyladine,6,Thu Jul 16 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"There are 2 possibilities:   It is the Universe that got Cronenberged It is the Universe that Rick is originally from. Rick was gone for a long time. Its possible that he destroyed his original universe, and just joined the one from the pilot episode so he could get a new Morty.    There is a hint in the background of one of the leaked episodes that suggests that the current universe is not C-137."
rickandmorty,3denff,CronenbergLincler,3,Thu Jul 16 04:47:13 2015 UTC,That 2 is really sad to hear. That mean the Rickest Rick isn't hanging out with the Mortiest Morty.
rickandmorty,3denff,somefish254,5,Thu Jul 16 05:51:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe he picked ""our"" Morty's universe BECAUSE it had the Mortiest Morty."
rickandmorty,3denff,ignoramus012,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:16:04 2015 UTC,Or evil genius Morty is the mortiest Morty and Ricks warning about being cocky is actually a memory he had with him.
rickandmorty,3denff,velocity010,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:53:40 2015 UTC,Why can't that be the case?
rickandmorty,3denff,Bobblefighterman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:44:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely think Rick isn't from the same dimension as Morty.   Rick seems to be pretty familiar with the procedure for burying yourself and taking over your own life. In Close Rick-counters, when Rick's memories are being downloaded, a memory of a toddler Morty flashes by, and Rick starts tearing up. I've heard a theory (which I like) that that's Evil Morty. Something happened which caused Rick to leave his home dimension, and which motivated Evil Morty to take revenge on our Rick."
rickandmorty,3denff,hjfreyer,6,Fri Jul 17 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"what always freaked me out is that that number is a reference to our world. it might be OUR dimension. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/137_(number) a little offtopic, it just always perks up my ears when I hear that number."
rickandmorty,3denff,KyrtD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:18 2015 UTC,it's cronenberg...
rickandmorty,3denff,parmesan22,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:27:48 2015 UTC,Before cronenberg even happened rick is labeled c137. This is his original dimension.
rickandmorty,3denff,diejetty,2,Thu Jul 16 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"Since Rick Potion #9 (Cronenberg) precedes Rixty Minutes (Morty referring to his dead body), there is precedent with the production numbers being sequential. Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind is then the 10th of 11 season 1 episodes, and should be considered to be following Rick Potion #9 (which is the 6th)."
rickandmorty,3denff,Psyladine,0,Thu Jul 16 14:09:11 2015 UTC,"""Our"" Rick's origin is C-137, but that doesn't mean their current universe OR the Cronenberg universe is C-137. In the pilot Beth says they haven't seen Rick in a long time. My theory is their Rick died, and our Rick's Morty died, so our Rick came to the universe that is now Cronenberged (before it was Cronenberged, obviously) to get a new Morty. For all we know, the Morty we meet in episode one may not be the same Morty we've come to know by the end of season 1.  Proof."

Even if Pluto is a bit bigger, it's still part of the Kuiper belt, and that's why it is simply not a planet. But this episode makes it all about size. I don't care that they say it's made of plutonium, that there are somehow 4 bil ppl on the small piece of ice & rock, that they speak english, etc. I love R&M's goofiness and silly jokes! But to center the plot around size reinforces bad science.  Edit: wording and sorry to be a buzzkill here and this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_2gbGXzFbs"

rickandmorty,3czgyc,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"Dopamine:       Dopamine (contracted from 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a neurotransmitter of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays a number of important roles in the human brain and body. Its name derives from its chemical structure: it is an amine that is formed by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of L-DOPA.  In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior. Most types of reward increase the level of dopamine in the brain, and a variety of addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity. Other brain dopamine systems are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of several other important hormones.  Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, has been related to the loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in the midbrain area called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves highly altered levels of dopamine activity, and the antipsychotic drugs that are frequently used to treat it have a primary effect of attenuating dopamine activity.  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are also believed to be associated with decreased dopamine activity. [citation needed]  Outside the nervous system, dopamine functions in several parts of the body as a local chemical messenger. In the blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems has a ""paracrine"" function: it is synthesized locally and exerts its effects on cells that are located near the cells that release it.  A variety of important drugs work by altering the way the body makes or uses dopamine. Dopamine itself is available for intravenous injection: although it cannot reach the brain from the bloodstream, its peripheral effects make it useful in the treatment of heart failure or shock, especially in newborn babies. L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does reach the brain and is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's disease. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. Conversely, many antipsychotic drugs act by suppressing the effects of dopamine. Drugs that act against dopamine by a different mechanism are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents.  Preparations containing dopamine hydrochloride are used in the treatment of acute heart failure, kidney failure, myocardial infarction, septic shock, etc. and are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines (WHO-EM), a list of medicines that are essential for a basic health system.

rickandmorty,3cwmjn,pepperjohnson,3,Sun Jul 12 12:44:40 2015 UTC,Morty also sounds like lemongrab.
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,AdamBall1999,7,Sat Jul 11 12:26:58 2015 UTC,Morty sounds like Lemongrab like Jake sounds like Bender.  Same guy doing a different voice.
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,PM_ME_YOUR__EYES,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:03:37 2015 UTC,But I think Morty's voice is very similar to Lemongrab's.

rickandmorty,3cwmjn,Rabble-Arouser,5,Sat Jul 11 16:27:33 2015 UTC,He's a character from the cartoon Adventure Time. I haven't seen it but I know that it's a children's show that's popular among teenagers and young adults.
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,SDJ67,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"It's just a ""children's show"" in the sense that it doesn't have the adult themes or language like in Rick & Morty. It's kid-friendly but not really created with kids in mind like true ""kids shows"" are."
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,efgi,2,Sat Jul 11 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"It definitely has adult themes in it, though. Princess Cookie tried to commit suicide. We see all sorts of complex moral issues arising among the leaders/rules in the land including the ethics of surveillance, espionage, and covert military action.   It's just presented in a kid friendly and (mostly) lighthearted way."
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,SDJ67,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:15:39 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. Princess Cookie is one of my fave episodes. Love how Jake stepped up in that one.   I was more thinking like the sex stuff in Rick & Morty. But yeah it's awesome thinking about what a range of moral issues and the like Adventure Time has dealt with. Such a good show.
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,efgi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:21:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, THOSE adult themes. Lol. Well along those lines, they've done a lot with Finn going through puberty including allegories of wet dreams and a fade-to-black which has been largely interpretted as rape.   In general, the show often uses symbolism and literary elements which go right over kids' heads."
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,owl_party,2,Sun Jul 12 06:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yo, you're allowed to enjoy kid's shows without being pedantic about the term. You're not going to lose adult points for watching a kid's show, I promise."
rickandmorty,3cwmjn,SDJ67,2,Sun Jul 12 03:35:45 2015 UTC,Haha okay thanks. I still catch a spongebob ep every now and then. I do legitimately think AT (minus the first season maybe) isn't targeted towards kids tho.

In the Council of Ricks episode he created a means to retrace the portal gun's tampering to the home dimension.  In the episode Morty is the leader, he uses a Soul-trapper device to capture the demon souls.  In the Devil episode he creates a device to uncurse items.

In >Season Two, we didn’t focus so much on the inventions – we looked towards more concept-driven ideas. There was less influence from pop culture – there’s a lot more original ideas here. Season One, we used things that inspired us, like the Inception episode and the Needful Things storyline where we subverted those concepts.   Dan: There’s a finite supply of any of these approaches, right?     Interestingly, Frank Herbert said you could make a career of subverting assumptions in bestselling scifi.

rickandmorty,3cqdef,downthecrop,15,Fri Jul 10 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"In the first scene Rick says something like ""ooh responsive too! You really out did yourselves this time guys!"" after Morty comments on how nice of a day it is.  It's a really fun episode to rewatching knowing Rick is just fucking with them the whole time!"
rickandmorty,3cqdef,diejetty,9,Fri Jul 10 01:13:24 2015 UTC,He knows right away. Within the first minute Morty is leaving and trips. Rick gives him a serious stink eye. This is when he starts figuring it out.
rickandmorty,3cqdef,Frank_the_Great,15,Fri Jul 10 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"Nah. Rick is smart but I don't think that's what happened. He was suspicious at that point because ""Morty"" was acting normal while the rest of the simulation wasn't. He assumed ""Morty"" was a simulation, like everything else, but the present evidence suggested otherwise, which was suspicious.   It's been a while since I've seen the episode but I recall a point where Rick could have figured it out. Transitioning into the final layer of the simulation, ""Morty"" was holding the simulated crystals, which should have disappeared but didn't. Then there is the more obvious scene where they just so happen to need concentrated dark matter to escape, which was a big red flag for Rick.   Also, there's the post credits scene where Rick reveals his doubts by drunkenly threatening Morty."
rickandmorty,3cqdef,Tinfoil_King,3,Fri Jul 10 02:13:44 2015 UTC,"Also don't forget the section with endless simulations roaming around the ship near freely.  That can either help or hurt the crystal thing you noticed.  Either  the final layer was breaking down and Rick would have noticed, or the Shaymliens can freely have their artificial things outside the simulation.  The latter would mean the crystals by themselves would prove nothing."
rickandmorty,3cqdef,tmrxwoot,2,Fri Jul 10 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"Wait what episode?  Edit: nvm,   But no, I believe he was tricked for a bit, but after they revealed morty was a rendering, Rick assumed there was one more level of simulation before they'd be done. That's how he knew to give the wrong formula."
rickandmorty,3cqdef,murder_nectar,3,Thu Jul 9 23:26:15 2015 UTC,"But they reveal he's a simulation after he's already given them the wrong formula. Before that, when the Zigerions reveal to Rick he's inside a simulation, inside another simulation, Morty is still there.   Am I missing something?"
rickandmorty,3cqdef,murder_nectar,2,Thu Jul 9 23:39:44 2015 UTC,K so at the beginning of the episode Rick knows he's in a simulation and assumes Morty is part of it. But they did such a good job simulating Morty that Rick was convinced it WAS Morty. Mostly because they simulated Morty's Little Morty.
rickandmorty,3cqdef,str8killinitdawg,3,Fri Jul 10 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"But if that were the case, if Morty added the water bottle to the bucket, Rick would be blowing up himself along with Jerry."
rickandmorty,3cqdef,murder_nectar,5,Fri Jul 10 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"Fact of the matter is those aliens wouldn't have those 3 things just sitting around in their escape pod. Which is why Rick says ""Who, lucky break Morty!"""

rickandmorty,3cqdef,ClassyQuinn,2,Fri Jul 10 10:36:37 2015 UTC,"No because the water bottle he'd be pouring would be simulated as well, so it wouldn't have actually hurt Rick. But it's obvious that Rick knew Morty was simulated by then."
rickandmorty,3cqdef,ChRoNicBuRrItOs,2,Fri Jul 10 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"I believe you are correct, right after Rick yells out the recipe the simulation stops and morty is shown to be stimulated. Rick must have known it was a stimulation and morty would never poor in the water"
rickandmorty,3cqdef,ClassyQuinn,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:27 2015 UTC,"I always saw it that Rick knew the last simulation he was in was a simulation (because of Jerry's outfit) but didn't know that Morty was simulated which was why he was like ""oh no"" when he found that out.  Then again I haven't seen the commentary of the episode"
rickandmorty,3cqdef,ChRoNicBuRrItOs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:24:00 2015 UTC,He knows Morty's a simulation from the very beginning. Watch how he reacts to him.

rickandmorty,3cv0vo,rick_is_god,17,Sat Jul 11 00:24:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly meant as a joke. The show can only do this three or four more times, and every episode every week as it would make every dangerous scenario very anticlimatic."

rickandmorty,3cq3bp,Katsup-doo-doo31,16,Thu Jul 9 21:35:08 2015 UTC,My opinion is that starting them on pilot is best because so much of the show's humour is contextual and so you might as well start from the beginning to learn the characters. The pilot introduces probably gives the best outsider introduction to the characters.
rickandmorty,3cq3bp,jrebs,2,Thu Jul 9 21:37:40 2015 UTC,I guess I should. My original plan was to show  meeseeks because it's funny enough but still has the dark elements and that jellybean scene so they know what they're in for with the rest of the show. Then go on to the pilot and show everything else in chronological order. But the pilot does a good enough job at that so I guess it's unnecessary.
rickandmorty,3cq3bp,jrebs,8,Thu Jul 9 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea, make them watch eps 1 and 2 in succession instead of just one. :) The pilot paves the way and then the second episode is, I think, the one where Snowball becomes intelligent and leads the dogs against mankind. Anyone who isn't hooked after that episode probably isn't the right kind of person for the show anyway. :)"

I was blown away by their solid jokes about pop culture, their timeline that actually made sense (despite how complex and utterly ridiculous it was), their use of joke continuity, and their absolutely hilarious one-liners (""Sex is SACRED!""). I was hooked from then on.  I cannot recommend episode two enough."
rickandmorty,3cq3bp,HowBoutNope,6,Fri Jul 10 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say show ""Rick Potion #9"", then ""Rixty Minutes"" immediately after. That's how I got hooked."

rickandmorty,3cq3bp,andysaurus_rex,2,Fri Jul 10 01:54:36 2015 UTC,"Solid advice here.  Rixty minutes is what hooked me because of Morty's speech at the end about being dead and nothing mattering, plus the awesome song that plays in the background.  On the other hand, I've hooked many/most of my friends by showing them clips from Rixty Minutes, like Real Fake Doors and Gazorpazorpfield.    Depends on attention span and situation - if the plan is to watch a full episode, then Rick Potion #9 is pretty solid.  If you just want to show them real quick in person, or send a link then I'd go with a TV show from Rixty Minutes."
rickandmorty,3cq3bp,Ghostronic,9,Fri Jul 10 07:45:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do the Meeseeks one. That one, while hilarious, always makes me uncomfortable when Morty is nearly raped.

But yeah, early retirement - more communication. You can get into that whole weird elderly swinger phase; also if you play your jersey number from football on the lottery every week you can win enough money to buy the condo in Florida. Can never seem to get past 70 though, last time I died of malaria (long story).  Anyone know a decent walkthrough?"

BTW, have you tried Roy 2 with the Jewish DLC? I've heard it's good but I'm not sure if it's worth wasting my flerbows on it."
rickandmorty,3clme9,Ocisaac,5,Thu Jul 9 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you can live past 70 if you go to the home? I always thought that recurring dream I had about being stuck in a bird cage was a warning against going for the home? I'll need to get another playthrough on the go next time I'm at B & Cs. Thanks for the tip on the buff against Malaria too, I'll look into taking that around the world trip (last time I bought a motorcycle during my mid-life crisis instead, it was pretty lame).   I've heard the Jewish DLC pack for Roy 2 is just a reskin, but there's an Orthodox Jewish patch that makes it a lot better"

I think that if you put your assets in your son Dave's name, instead of your wife, then you can avoid getting caught and beat cancer, not sure though, I'm gonna try it next time I get over to Blitz and Chits.

With only certain decision points like if you cheat on a test or not. It would be as detailed as current computer memory would allow and probably have a lot of early deaths to try to keep some scenarios short, and a very very low possibility of a long lifespan. And where to make the decision points would matter a lot. Oh dang I like the 1 hour=1 day idea. Ooh! Like you have to make a decision quickly or else time runs out for that choice, instead of cheating or not cheating on a test, the teacher says you ran out of time and you get a 0. It would have to be like one set of decisions per year, like you only get to be 12 for one day, which is one hour of play-time. It would take years and years to develop."

It seems like he moonwalked on a carpet while holding a toaster and the shock messed with the game. It's not worth it though, I am sure the devs didn't expect such life expectancy and Roy's 50s-80s are pretty boring and unprogrammed.   Besides, there are no new quests and no way to level up anymore. You are stuck in this sandbox with nothing to do but eat through a straw and watch your wife knit. If anything, you should try making Roy fail High School to ensure you play through it again, feels like NG+, I have no evidence, but I am sure the game is programmed for Roy to peak there, at least I have sensed a luck increase."

And Rixty Minutes is pretty great, but like Rick mentions himself in the episode, the tv shows are pretty 'improv' level rather than hilariously planned. I wonder how much effort went into thinking them up..."

I assume a cursed monkey paw works with ambiguity and double-meanings  I wish this desk was lighter  I wish this knot was looser  I wish I knew cpr  Monkey paw doesn't have much to work with...
rickandmorty,3cmxtt,Backhorn,3,Thu Jul 9 13:06:51 2015 UTC,It usually does but CPR could have been turned around pretty easily. I Mean simply make the letters stand for something else and bam. The desk could have been made lighter by making it loose its legs or having drawers fall out. The knot being looser yeah I got nothing.

I hope that one day there will be a short segment on Rick and Morty where they enter into the dimension of The House of Cosby's.  M - ""He- Hey, Rick. You think maybe I could try out the portal gun?""   R - ""I don't know Morty caa-burp-aan you? The answer is no. You can't.""   M - ""Come on, Rick.

(Rick stands, uninterested) You're always pickin' on me, man. All I ever do is help you.

M - ""Jeez, Rick, that's kinda harsh.""  R - ""That's life Morty. Life is harsh in every dimension. So hee-burp-ere you go, Morty. (Tosses him the portal gun) Just don't come running to me if you die a slow, horrible, painful death.""   M - ""Uhh. Yeah, Right. Well, Here we go I guess."" (Shoots portal)   They both enter the portal as they end up in the living room of a seemingly empty living room of a house.   M - ""Hm. Looks like we're in a living room. See Rick, we're not dead. We're completely fine.""   R - ""Don't get a big dick, Morty, but I guess I don't need to tell you that.""   M - ""Dick jokes? Man, I thought you were more clever than that.""   R - ""I don't need to be clever. I'm already a genius... Hm.. this place looks kinda familiar.""   ""THEEOOOOO!""   R - ""Oh, shit.""  ""What was that?""   R - ""That... was one of my earliest inventions.   A group of Cosby's enter the room.   M - ""Are those...""  R - ""Bill Cosby's, yes.""   M - ""You made Bill Cosby?""  R - ""No, moron. I made a cloning machine. The cloning machine made Bill Cosby.""  M - ""Isn't that kinda on the nose, Rick. I mean, he's a... well...""  R - ""A rapist?""  M - ""Yeah.""  R- ""N-N-Not In this dimension, Morty... Well, except for Cosby 78, he's totally a rapist.""   Cosby 1 - ""Ruuudyyy, now lisssteenn too your father... The 100th cosby, you see, has taakkeenn over the rest of the planet... you see.   Cosby 3 - ""Theeooo, it's past your curfew and as your father I'm gonna have to ground you.""   M - ""So they all just act like different variations of Bill Cosby from The Cosby Show?""  R - ""Yep. It was the perfect invention. But even perfection can still be followed by a want for more perfection...   M - ""That was beautiful, Rick.""  R - ""And thanks for ruining it, Morty. Now get us out of here before I'm roped into saving another pointless dimension.""  M - ""Alright."" (fiddles with the portal gun and shoots it)   R - ""That heroin dimension is starting to sound pretty good right about now.""  M - ""We're not going to the heroin dimension Ri-"" They both enter the portal. The camera zooms in slowly as, from the darkness, The 100th Cosby creeps into frame.   100th Cosby - ""Finally. My escape has come to fruition...""   He enters the portal and it closes behind him.   Fade out"

rickandmorty,3cgsyw,semajay,10,Wed Jul 8 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"Actually this is a lot more common for animated shows, especially hand drawn shows. This way production companies will be able to handle a longer season too, so expect more than 8 episodes from R&M next season. It's happening even more frequently with how strong animated television has been the past few years. I remember Bob's Burgers was purchased for 2 full seasons halfway through their second or third season and that was crazy."
rickandmorty,3cgsyw,adamhart,3,Wed Jul 8 05:23:22 2015 UTC,10 episodes
rickandmorty,3cgsyw,Riztonium,-3,Wed Jul 8 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"That isn't really crazy, cartoons are regularly picked up for multiple seasons at once.  It happens to south park and Simpsons all the time.  It happened to regular show when they picked it up for 4 and 5 at the same time.  Nickelodeon cartoons were commonly signed for large episode amounts that would be broken up over multiple volumes or seasons.  It's much rarer for a this to happen with a live action show, though it does happen every now and then with sitcoms.  Also, season 1 was 11 episodes and season 2 was 10.  Where are you getting the number 8 from?"
rickandmorty,3cgsyw,Scapone22,6,Wed Jul 8 06:36:50 2015 UTC,It's slightly crazy for a show to get two especially that early.
rickandmorty,3cgsyw,adamhart,-4,Wed Jul 8 14:12:29 2015 UTC,No it isnt...that's kinda the point of my post.  Animated shows regularly get the multi season pick ups.  Sometimes before they even debut.  Rick and Morty is amazing but not reason to overblow it's accomplishments.

Really tough to line up the rest of it though, I think the one where Homer joins NASA is up there(I for one welcome our new ant overlords, the inanimate carbon rod, all sorts of great moments), I've always loved the one where Lisa becomes a vegetarian(if for no other reason, than the awesome educational video with Troy McClure), and like I said Homer's Enemy is also great.

Dips a little from season 5-7, then really picks up again."

rickandmorty,3cft3u,comment23,5,Tue Jul 7 20:00:02 2015 UTC,So is Roiland just good at burping on command or does he drink a ton of soda beforehand or does he suffer from GERD or  Also does he just burp whenever natural/funny in the recording sessions then the animators have to go back and add it?
rickandmorty,3cft3u,Jreynold,4,Tue Jul 7 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"From some behind the scenes stuff I saw, he definitely drinks carbonated beverages to get the burp. Sarah Chalke (Beth) however, can do it on command. As for the second question, I don't know, but I'd imagine a bit of both."
rickandmorty,3cft3u,ignoramus012,2,Tue Jul 7 18:50:39 2015 UTC,I remember hearing him describe it on a panel or something like that.  He drinks a light beer then jumps around until he has to burp and then I believe the sound editor edits them into the normal-spoken lines.

rickandmorty,3cj25o,thedude2618,4,Wed Jul 8 08:18:39 2015 UTC,I haven't spotted any. I think its mentioned that they actually combed the season for continuity errors before broadcast.
rickandmorty,3cj25o,fatfatninja,2,Wed Jul 8 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"It was produced in a very different order (I think love potion #9 was actually production order 02) but it all seemed to make a lot more sense when you watch them in the order they were aired. The writers are meticulous about things like continuity so unless there's just an off-hand mention of something that hasn't happened yet, I doubt there's anything major."
rickandmorty,3cj25o,elastical_gomez,2,Wed Jul 8 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thinking about it Love Potion #9 had to come before Rixty Minutes whichever way as its events are specifically mentioned."
rickandmorty,3cj25o,InfantStomper,3,Wed Jul 8 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"And they also reference Raising Gazorpazorp while watching tv in Rixty Minutes. Honestly I didn't even know they were produced out of order and after several rewatches I never noticed a continuity error. Most of the episodes are pretty standalone, the only ones that need to be in a fixed place are the pilot and the final episode as season 2 opens with everything still frozen."

You took a hit I'm guessing and decided that I, the person behind the screen writing this up, has wholeheartedly believed that you, the other dude behind the username is close-minded, which, I assure, I haven't done. Judging is not my type of thing, or I try not to do it that often, (as our favourite Rick suggests all the time, it's bad to judge). And yeah, I admit, I was on 9gag for a while until I saw the patterns that started to piss me off, (and honestly I'm seeing similar next-level patterns here on reddit too) people jerking each other off and using cheap humor to get along, I left that place very disappointed, and whenever I see things that remind me of 9gag (people calling strangers on the internet ""sir"", for example), it's a bit off-putting for me.

The development of the jerrycan was a significant improvement on earlier designs, which required tools and funnels to use. Today similar designs are used for fuel and water containers, some of which are also produced in plastic. The designs usually emulate the original steel design and are still known as jerrycans.

Plus in the same episode we see him start to shed some tears for Morty. Obviously he doesn't care too much about Jerry, but maybe he has his own reason to keep their marriage together.   Edit: or maybe he was trying to split them up and it backfired. Seems like the goggles being set to Jerry's timeline is a strange coincidence, but it could just be."

rickandmorty,3cdd6y,feebos,3,Tue Jul 7 06:34:27 2015 UTC,Lol true that. I was just saying your theory is possible if he had his own motive. Most likely he just dgaf and its nothing.

rickandmorty,3c9pzn,SDJ67,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:01:13 2015 UTC,"How is watching the show again online going to show any more support than simply watch it? Unless you're paying for the privilege I can't see the point. You're not paying to watch the shows online.  This is even more true if you're using an ad blocker like AdBlock or uBlock because then the publishers don't even get revenue from any of it.  It's like worrying about pirating music when you want to support musicians when buying albums isn't the best way to support your favourite artists directly, going to their gigs and buying their merch is. At best supporting the studios gives more incentive to continue paying the artists to make more songs (which is my main argument against piracy in general)."
rickandmorty,3c9pzn,MrTastix,9,Mon Jul 6 15:52:59 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're being down voted. Unless you're a Nielsen family you don't affect ratings for shows (at least from what I understand)
rickandmorty,3c9pzn,122ninjas,7,Mon Jul 6 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. There is literally no way for the cable companies to track what you are watching- unless they do it secretly, and even then, it wouldn't affect the ratings they make public, and is a hypothetical moot point.   I don't understand it at all."
rickandmorty,3c9pzn,OnSpeakerCrab,2,Mon Jul 6 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"It's not like I'm not going to support the show anyway I can. If they release a DVD copy I'd gladly buy it, but watching it online doesn't exactly do much."

rickandmorty,3c9pzn,Morty777,5,Mon Jul 6 19:22:34 2015 UTC,I tried to abstain (it's only a few more weeks)  but couldn't. On the flip side the first two episodes were hilarious and only makes me want to buy the series when it's out because it deserves as much support as possible.

rickandmorty,3c9pzn,Ginger-Nerd,6,Mon Jul 6 08:42:14 2015 UTC,"I partly agree and partly disagree - with GoT i generally have a 2 day rule with it (if you havn't seen it 2 days after its aired, you're shit out of luck...) However with the leaked episodes i didn't really talk about them at all until they were properly out.   However, if i was someone that had held off watching them - I wouldn't of hung around the game of thrones subreddit. I sort of feel the same with this.   also spoilers? Rick and Morty is hardly a show that is ruined by spoilers, (oh my god, you won't believe who was killed off) If you are complaining about spoilers to a show like Rick and Morty, (regardless of how soon after its aired) its so absurd that you would complain about that, that i am just going to assume you're a guy that eats shit."
rickandmorty,3c9pzn,sirgraemecracker,12,Mon Jul 6 13:51:07 2015 UTC,Rick and Morty is hardly a show that is ruined by spoilers   For the most part. I'd never tell someone the ending of Rick Potion #9.

rickandmorty,3c7y54,KasesWorld,9,Mon Jul 6 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"I know those points, but I don't have the same takeaway.  She had a lawsuit against her former employer - so? None of my business. And it's not like she has a history or pattern, it was one suit, ever. I don't care that she had a suit and lost, one time.  One employee SAID he was fired ""for having cancer"", no other proof available. I remain unconvinced.  Your last point is not something she said, it's a rephrasing of something she said to make it sound terrible.  For my money, there's little actual proof that she's done anything terrible. There's a lot of circumstantial evidence and assumption, though. So much assumption."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,lasershurt,-4,Mon Jul 6 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"Fair points on a few things. Some more shit that makes me hate her though:  She is married to Buddy Fletcher who stole hundreds of millions from a firefighters pension fun, and don't tell me she didn't full well know about that shit.  She cheated. Fuck people who don't have the guts to break up with someone before moving on.  Her lawsuit held no grounds and she tried to pin it as gender discrimination, this is just as bad as those women who claim false rape.   When she joined reddit she took away the opportunity for pay negotiation because apparently that is sexist towards men.  Theres more but I am leaving work now so if you want to hear more just reply and Ill answer when I get home"
rickandmorty,3c7y54,KasesWorld,6,Mon Jul 6 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Buddy Fletcher's never been charged or convicted of anything, has he? I know that's the common line on him, but AFAIK it's never been proven in any official capacity. Let me know if that's wrong, because trying to Google it the signal-to-noise ratio is all out of whack.  You don't get to decide that her lawsuit was baseless or anything akin to ""false rape."" She may have felt that her suit was 100% justified; the court did not. End of story. Like I said, I can't take a single suit as evidence of anything.  It's just all so limp, and circumstantial. I can't get up the dander to hate her for any of that. And there IS a weirdly gendered part of the hate for her that makes me very uncomfortable."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,lasershurt,0,Mon Jul 6 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"Yes he was charged with close to or over $2 million in damages from his ponzi scheme so he did do it, it was proven. And the exact amount he has to pay was what Ellen tried to get on appeal when she failed to make any proof that her lawsuit was legit. By the way her original lawsuit was $16 million because and I shit you not ""she was left out of conversations and treated poorly because of her gender"" which is bullshit because her women co-workers said she was a terrible person and there was an incident where she threw one under the bus so she could get ahead proving she isn't a feminist she hates other women in the workplace if they are ahead of her(I will try and find the source of this if you want). I don't hate her for her gender, I hate her because she is using her gender as a bunch of feminism bullshit in technology to get ahead, meanwhile she is throwing other women under the bus because she only cares about herself. She is actually making it worse for all other woman because she thinks she can get away with anything, and I don't blame her, being a complete bitch has worked out for her just fine and dandy and she's going to go on being a complete bitch in another company until she's fired again.  edit; Her husband also tried to sue over racial discrimination issues and lost by a landslide, please tell me you think something does not add up there. All I'll say is I can't make you hate her if you don't but there is a lot to hate about her and if you want to know more on why I don't like here you can read some of it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2zcbyq/what_is_going_on_with_the_drama_towards_acting/"

The mods knew it happened but made no attempt to stop it because since it wasn't directly called brigading and they weren't endorsing it on a stickie they thought they were safe.

rickandmorty,3c7y54,MisterMeeseeks47,24,Mon Jul 6 17:03:34 2015 UTC,"You can check out /r/hangryhangryfphater for more but here's a few infamous reasons curated by /u/IAmAN00bie   FPH would often post pictures of random people they saw in public to shame them. Or they would cross post something from a sub like /r/skincareaddiction or /r/makeupaddiction and then harass the OP based on their looks. Or the one time a woman posted in /r/sewing about a dress she made and that got harassment. Or when a couple met over GTA5 and that got cross-posted.      Alright, let's start linking actual examples of harassment and chronic toxicity that FPH has done.    Thread 1: An open letter to all the fat fats who may be lurking here...    Thread 2: Drama in /r/progresspics when OP's pictures get crossposted to /r/fatpeoplehate.     Thread 3: /r/fatpeoplehate is mentioned in a video by youtuber Boogie2988. Brigade happens on a comment he made in the the sub yesterday about his face.    Thread 4: Big girl on r/unexpected is compared to a planet. Comments are apparently gatecrashed by redditors from r/fatpeoplehate .    Thread 5: Redditor from /r/sewing posts pictures of herself wearing her new dress. Someone cross-posted those pictures to FPH and a drama wave happen.    Thread 6: This is a thread where a FPH user celebrates his co-worker's death    7: /r/fitshionvsfatshion: an entire sub dedicated to bullying how fat people dress and showing how it ""should be done""    Thread 8: Here's a post where a FPH user posts a dead woman's photos to mock them    9: Here's a sub they made to make fun of fat people at weddings    10: Two users met over GTAV, one of them was fat! This led to /r/FPH brigading the sub.    Thread 11: FPH brigades /r/suicidewatch and tells a suicidal redditor to kill himself."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,NCR-Patriot,7,Tue Jul 7 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Again, I didn't like FPH   ...   The only reason people think that is because the majority of this site's users are fatties and they got their feelings hurt.   I don't think you're being entirely honest here. You clearly loved it.  But again, the differences are clear: SRS tells people not to brigade in the sidebar and to keep things within their own sub, and they have never had any doxing issues afaik. FPH on the other hand directly encouraged both brigading and doxing of fat people, both of which are against reddit rules, and organised all sorts of other harassment outside the bounds of their own sub.   ...frequently post stuff without permission of the subject, purely for the sake of mocking them and even sometimes linking to Reddit posts.   None of this is against the rules."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,eliasv,11,Tue Jul 7 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"exact same thing   Ehhhhhhhhhhhh, no they don't. Not even mentioning the fact that SRS is a shell of what it was a few years ago and barely has enough active users to impact pretty much anything on reddit, I can't think of a single time they did something rivaling even the tamest of FPH's evidenced incedents of harassment. If they did please by all means point me towards some proof.  Subs like /r/cringe and /r/cringepics certainly aren't great, but once again I can't think of any huge examples of them doing anything as ban-worthy as FPH.   I honestly just don't see why people who weren't members of the community try to defend FPH, it was a hectic and hateful community of hateful immature assholes who constantly tried to start trouble. As for the free speech defense, FPH was probably the most anti-free speech community I've ever seen on reddit, if they had their way they'd ban the speech of ""fatties"" and ""fattie sympathizers"" any and everywhere they could."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,NCR-Patriot,4,Tue Jul 7 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"FPH were doxxing. I don't give a shit about the content, they were doxxing.  Fuck them, they deserved to go."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,cowboyvenus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"They weren't doxxing, they were posting public pics of imgurs staff because imgur wouldn't let FPH link to imgur. Not really cool, but definitely not doxxing."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,dills,4,Mon Jul 6 01:03:14 2015 UTC,"Fph was banned for bregading, not being assholes."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,shitterplug,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:20:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, then explain why SRS is still here"
rickandmorty,3c7y54,MrBoobieBuyer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:21:09 2015 UTC,SRS warns users against voting in linked threads. An admin has said that they aren't any worse than other meta subs. They also don't tell people to kill themselves.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,DrFilbert,-7,Mon Jul 6 09:33:07 2015 UTC,Because it's a legacy sub. They're hard to ban.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,shitterplug,0,Mon Jul 6 03:44:53 2015 UTC,That's a terribly shitty excuse. I think people just don't want to admit that FPH was banned specifically because they were reaching the front page and that made the site look bad which in turn would make Reddit harder to sell. It's no secret that Reddit is getting primed to be bought off by someone else.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,MrBoobieBuyer,-7,Mon Jul 6 01:59:44 2015 UTC,"Regardless, I was glad to see it go. It was a cesspool of neckbeards contributing nothing to the site. Hopefully SRS is next."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,shitterplug,2,Mon Jul 6 04:39:21 2015 UTC,SRS doesn't actually promote brigading... They ostensibly link to stuff to complain about in their own threads. FPH actually promoted brigading in the sidebar.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,eliasv,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"What the fuck are you talking about. You obviously never visited either. FPH was vehemently against brigading since they knew that's what they would get accused of. Nowhere on that sub was brigading encouraged. In fact, anyone even suspected of brigading was banned. Any rule violation was an instant ban. They did not fuck around. SRS, however, flat out refuses to post np links or edit out usernames, posts FPH would remove instantly."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,ambivilant,16,Mon Jul 6 04:40:50 2015 UTC,Why the fuck does anyone want to ban ANY subreddits provided they aren't doing anything illegal?
rickandmorty,3c7y54,Sir_LoudMouth,12,Mon Jul 6 04:50:00 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I said about my subreddit!: /r/SubtlyUnderminingBulliedChildrensSelfEsteem
rickandmorty,3c7y54,thebeginningistheend,12,Mon Jul 6 17:31:27 2015 UTC,That could have been a really good sub if someone competent had been in charge of it.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,milesunderground,4,Mon Jul 6 04:54:36 2015 UTC,Brilliant.  Almost too subtle to catch.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,gamemaniac36,2,Mon Jul 6 04:59:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Expression isn't illegal, action and danger is. FPH was basically accused of targeting a specific person, or people on the subreddit anyway. The other subreddits express their views they don't act on them or hatefully target individuals and that is why they are still active."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,Matthew_McHiniNini,0,Mon Jul 6 05:02:06 2015 UTC,I feel like FPH was pretty explicitly hate speech.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,avo_cado,4,Mon Jul 6 09:28:18 2015 UTC,They were also doing lots of horrible things. Doxxing imgur employees ad making their info public. Venturing out of their subreddit to traverse Reddit and abuse other users. Lots of them would go into /r/suicidewatch and spam overweight people with messages that they should kill themselves. Admins told the mods of FPH to reel in its users but the mods encouraged the harassment. So the sub was shut down.
rickandmorty,3c7y54,Radi0ActivSquid,7,Mon Jul 6 13:20:23 2015 UTC,"Doxxing imgur employees ad making their info public.    To be fair, that info was already public. All they did (AFAIK) was stitch together publicly available profile pics of the Imgur admins and put it on their sidebar, no names or contact details.   Dick move? Sure. Doxxing? Hardly."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,darth_static,2,Sun Jul 5 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean the sub was fatpeoplehate which is pretty easy to see is explicitly for hate speech"
rickandmorty,3c7y54,avo_cado,-2,Sun Jul 5 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"People are free to be insulted and influenced by whatever they choose. Reddit's policy is similar to the whole freedom of expression. Say what you want, however do not act against others and do not target others specifically. FPH targeted people, the other (incredibly shitty) rubreddits aren't attacking specific people, just a group of people. Honestly, I think that fucked up that people think that way, but they are free to do so. They are not free to target an individual or cause harm to the people they are hating. They are only allowed to express their opinions on them.   All this being said. Reddit isn't a government, they are a private organization and banning all the ill mannered subreddits are within their legal power. However, I believe people, no matter how bad or wrong, should be able to openly express their opinions."
rickandmorty,3c7y54,Matthew_McHiniNini,4,Sun Jul 5 23:35:17 2015 UTC,"Actually this is my 4th account. Though only two are active now, the old one is u/Homeless_Hommie  After about a year of using it someone pointed out that ""homie"" is spelled incorrectly so I said fuck it and created u/Matthew_McHiniNini because I had just bought the Interstellar movie  EDIT: By the way if you go through the other account all you're going to find is Lord of the Rings, Video Games, some techy stuff, industrial design, and a few askmen posts/comments."

rickandmorty,3c5u09,cewh,7,Sun Jul 5 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"Tartrates are a real thing, certain tartrates are used as food preservatives. Chlorified just means ""having had chlorine added to it"" (pool water is typically chlorified). Chlorified tartrate is not a thing, but probably could be if there was another chemical added, like chlorified sodium tartrate could probably be a real thing (just because ""tartrate"" isn't a chemical or compound by itself, it's a type of chemical).

rickandmorty,3c35bp,thebeginningistheend,19,Sun Jul 5 16:31:40 2015 UTC,Yup with Bart. And Maggie is what caused him to give up his dream job and have to go work at the plant.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,I_SPLIT_INFINITIVES,16,Sat Jul 4 15:38:01 2015 UTC,Homer and Marge are 36.  Bart is 10.  Typical High school Graduating age is 18.  I see a flaw in your theory.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,DarkChili,27,Sat Jul 4 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah they got together at the end of high school when Marge picked Homer up on the side of the road after her bad prom date with Artie Ziff. They stayed together until Homer got Marge pregnant, which is when he proposed to her and got his job at the plant. (He then quit the plant 8 years later to work in the bowling alley, but had to return to the plant when Marge got pregnant with Maggie.)"
rickandmorty,3c35bp,Tonkarz,9,Sat Jul 4 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Homer is 40 as seen in Homer Votes 2012, though he did start at 36. Bart has remained 10 the entire time, despite being born in 1980. Which would've made him 9 years old at most in the first season of the show, and so the only ""accurate"" season with regards to his age is the 2nd. The actual circumstances are also contradicted from The Way We Was to I Married Marge to That '90s Show.  Come to think of it That '90s Show has Lisa explicitly retcon the early Bart pregnancy thing, noting Homer and Marge dated far longer than we've previously been told before Bart came along. I guess a shotgun marriage kind of put a dark note on Homer and Marge's relationship the writers wanted to get rid of.  My fault for not remembering later Simpsons seasons I guess."
rickandmorty,3c35bp,MechaSixVII,9,Sat Jul 4 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that episode was like the worst episode of all time, not even Weird Al could save it."

rickandmorty,3c35bp,Jajarz,24,Mon Jul 6 17:24:25 2015 UTC,This is why I like this show. The characters feel like parodies of real people instead of just caricatures.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,Hybrid351,48,Sun Jul 5 00:28:30 2015 UTC,I agree. We need more parodies of real people like Homer Simpson.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,makemusicguitar5150,9,Sat Jul 4 14:07:16 2015 UTC,I think another big difference between Homer and Jerry is their place in the plot. Homer is the one driving the insanity in the typical Simpson's episode. Jerry is the one who is attempting to be the voice of reason against Rick.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,znoby,9,Sat Jul 4 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"To go even further, it's the fact that Jerry is so aware of, and insecure about his shortcomings that makes him so funny. It was hilarious seeing him realize that his advertising idea was crap, even when nobody around him was giving any opposition. His wife could leave him for basically any other man, his son only seems to look up to and interact with his alcoholic sociopath of a father-in-law, and there's nothing he can do about it. Even Homer Simpson has saved the day before, but Jerry's got no hope."
rickandmorty,3c35bp,ledfox,2,Sat Jul 4 21:01:41 2015 UTC,Jerry kinda saved the day in Rick Potion 6.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,1brokenmonkey,13,Sat Jul 4 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jerry is employed. He gets fired in Shyamaliens, and there is a throwaway line in a later episode about being ""between advertising jobs"" - hence his spare time to Jerry around."
rickandmorty,3c35bp,bowtochris,11,Sun Jul 5 13:38:01 2015 UTC,Yup! Came here to say this. Rick and Morty canon has Jerry unemployed (unless he found a job off-screen).
rickandmorty,3c35bp,Duckysaurus,2,Sat Jul 4 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"He could be a freelancer. Not sure how that applies to the world of advertising, but that was always my thought."
rickandmorty,3c35bp,ThumbtackGlove,9,Sat Jul 4 23:26:47 2015 UTC,Jerry is not a dumb guy. He must have a degree in marketing or something. He's probably just in the wrong field.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,achesst,21,Sun Jul 5 19:20:32 2015 UTC,Wasn't there an episode where they say he was a Civics major or something? He starts monologuing and they say that just because he was a civics major they shouldn't have to suffer too.
rickandmorty,3c35bp,ThingsIveSeenandDone,16,Sat Jul 4 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was in Raising Gazorpazorp, when Jerry is trying to justify Morty Jr's right to live, being born a US citizen, only to get shot down by Beth then Rick quickly followed by one of my favorite Jerry quotes, ""Life is effort and I'll stop when I die!""  And Jerry is definitely an idiot, mostly out of his personal insecurities and dullness, but an idiot nonetheless. Pluto's a planet pfffff."

rickandmorty,3c92z3,UnluckyLuke,3,Mon Jul 6 11:08:57 2015 UTC,"ah, you are right.  I went and looked at some stills and the languages are quite different.  still i do feel like i've seen that style of alien languages somewhere before."
rickandmorty,3c92z3,slicer4ever,2,Mon Jul 6 20:41:30 2015 UTC,You would have to a fucking blind eyeless donk to miss it
rickandmorty,3c92z3,Bithorp,-1,Mon Jul 6 04:42:11 2015 UTC,The female alien also bears a resemblance to Petunia
rickandmorty,3c3e77,alexshatberg,43,Sat Jul 4 11:10:58 2015 UTC,Was Devin going to rape Beth or just do to her whatever Cronenbergs do to people? What did they do? I don't remember.
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Viney,21,Sat Jul 4 11:50:12 2015 UTC,"since pretty much everyone around got Cronenberged it's hard to say for sure. It's probably the least rape-y of the scenarios above, but it still has that vibe to it."
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Viney,39,Sat Jul 4 11:58:13 2015 UTC,"I guess so.  You could jot Jerry down twice if you want to count the ""Slavic man"". And then there was Summer's boyfriend whose brother took him into the bushes and made him ""be the girl""."
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Flywolfpack,5,Sat Jul 4 12:06:43 2015 UTC,Slavic man? I think I missed something.
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Viney,25,Sat Jul 4 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"After the whole Titantic incident, Beth ask what a rapist looks like. Jerry's response is a little too vivid to be completely fictional and it involves a ""Slavic man in a denim jacket with the scent of cheap wine on wafting from his lips""."
rickandmorty,3c3e77,leinappropriate,-10,Sun Jul 5 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"It's vivid because that's like, exactly the rapist stereotype. I think you read into that a bit too much."

rickandmorty,3c3e77,Viney,8,Sun Jul 5 00:30:50 2015 UTC,Anatomy Park.
rickandmorty,3c3e77,dat_was_me_tho,3,Sun Jul 5 00:42:11 2015 UTC,"It was mentioned in the episode Anatomy Park, like/ u/Viney stated, but it wasn't shown."
rickandmorty,3c3e77,BynX_,12,Sun Jul 5 03:54:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, he was just mantis at that point. He wanted to mate with her, and then eat her head."
rickandmorty,3c3e77,ctornync,8,Sat Jul 4 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"Totally different, totally fine."
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Flywolfpack,3,Sat Jul 4 20:56:08 2015 UTC,Female mantis eats the male's head tho
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Hob-Bope,9,Sat Jul 4 20:40:22 2015 UTC,No he was being very forward with her before being Cronenberged.
rickandmorty,3c3e77,Viney,4,Sat Jul 4 15:49:40 2015 UTC,Hmm. I suppose I remember that as more creepy seduction than attempted assault but the theme seems to be present throughout a number of episodes so there's probably no disputing it outright.
rickandmorty,3c3e77,forkandspoon2011,22,Sun Jul 5 00:47:20 2015 UTC,"Justin Roiland was raped when he was a kid, he brought it up in the HarmonTown podcast. He was like 6 or something and there was a 16 year old girl that raped him."

rickandmorty,3c3est,JDoobz,2,Sat Jul 4 18:57:50 2015 UTC,I tried. I made it a whole 8 hours after the leak
rickandmorty,3c3est,charizardsnipples,2,Sun Jul 5 02:33:03 2015 UTC,I don't have a Neilson box. Does it matter if I watch it live or not?

rickandmorty,3c3est,_JustToComment,3,Sat Jul 4 12:14:51 2015 UTC,Yes but its about the principle of waiting for the real thing and not something someone leaked.
rickandmorty,3c3est,hopsonpop,20,Sat Jul 4 12:45:28 2015 UTC,what the fuck are you talking about? you're gonna try to high road us on moral grounds when we're talking about a show with central themes of total moral relativity? the whole point of freezing time was to not give a fuck. you're the Red Grin Grumble of false integrity.
rickandmorty,3c3est,_JustToComment,12,Sat Jul 4 12:56:53 2015 UTC,Do you really think guys like roiland or Harmon would care about leaks?
rickandmorty,3c3est,madcaplarks,-12,Sat Jul 4 21:22:05 2015 UTC,They will if they ultimately get cancelled because ratings were 5% too low
rickandmorty,3c3est,_JustToComment,15,Sat Jul 4 13:23:06 2015 UTC,It's adult swim... And a person only contributes to ratings if they're a Neilson family
