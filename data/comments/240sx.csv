I wouldn't buy it, you will probably need to drop another 1k to get that car running. if you can sell the motor and drop a sr20det in there for a reasonable cost then go for it. I don't see a point to turboing a sr20de, it is probably harder than a ka to turbo. Does it have coils or any suspension parts, 300zx brakes, 5 lug? you are still going to need turn signal lights to get that on the road as well. a little confused as well why it has no wipers? cars like this were probably never actually taken care of, at least in the last 5-10years.

That brings it to $3k-3.5k and then the body looks like crap primer, missing signal light, and high mileage na s14sr20. Unless you know s13s' pretty well don't buy another person's project car.

When the dot on the crank lines up the screw driver is at its highest point. What ever way I turn the crank after that the screw driver always goes down. It is cylinder 1 that has to be TDC right?   The CAS I have rotated it a few degrees each way and it seems to help a little bit until you turn it to a point where flames came out the intake. The flames may have been fuel left over in the manifold from when it was flooded too. I've read a few guides on forums like Skylines Australia and as far as I can tell, the timing should be fine. I'm not expert however, this is my first time diving into timing especially on a RB25. I may be wrong"

Even though the mileage you're looking at for this one is low, you can probably get it for less considering it's not much of a collectors item because a lot of people don't really go after them.   Also, the aftermarket is very small for this car. Megan sells a coilover kit that uses s13 coils for the front, and some heavy modding for the rear(welding/cutting if im correct)  If you have the skills to turn it into something pretty, or just want a RWD Hachi roku-style car, then I would snag it.

Parts are a little harder to come by compared to later models, but in my opinion it's worth it to have something a bit different. Engine swaps are easy, with ca18 being a direct bolt in, or you could find a vg30 model. SR20 is an easy swap too if you can get one, and theres more than a couple of S12s with RB swaps (including a very nice RB26 powered example).

The city is tough on cars and my financial situation was up in the air at the time so my parents agreed to let me leave her in their barn in Vermont.    Since then I got married, had a kid, and bought a house (with a garage) but she has always been on my mind.  I finally have the space and the means to restore her so tomorrow morning she is being towed back to NY where I'll begin her transformation. She deserves it.  She's a 1998 SE. I swapped in a '96 VH45DE back in '04 but I've never been pleased with it. The engine was from a wreck and it's always had serious issues. I still have the original KA as well, probably looking to sell both and switch to an SR or LSX.    Other plans include PBM coilovers/CAs/tierods/endlinks, an S15 HLSD, and replacing every bushing I can. She needs some cosmetics too including a new passengers side head light and fog light (rock hit both on the highway), a little rust treatment on the roof (air foil around the sun roof left some scars) and a new interior (fuck mice).  It already has a complete Apex'i exhaust, tower braces, Z32 brakes, and Whiteline sway bars.    Edit: And a BATH. OMG a bath. And then after the bath ANOTHER bath, just for good measure.

If they told you that, I believe it to be a lie. You also mentioned that you don't have money as of now to put into it. Keep in mind that some RB replacement parts can be pricey and hard to get a hold of sometimes depending on the part. Besides that you're buying a modded car. You don't know what problems the car will have. If this is your only car and main mode of transportation, I would advise against it. But thats just me.

Hatches don't look great but I also don't like sil80's and the s14 front has a similar shape.   Anyhow, your gonna need conversion fenders with headlight brackets, kouki hood, kouki bumper, kouki headlights, kouki turn signals, s14 hood hinges and you'll need to do some custom wiring for the headlights. A s14 radiator support is optional but you'll need to cut some to fit the headlights if you don't use it.  There aren't a lot of conversion fenders because the swap isn't that popular. I think ait and extreme dimensions may have some but they're fitment is spotty to say the least.  You could try to custom make the fenders by cutting the ends close to the doors and welding them to the s14 fenders. Not an easy job but possible.   If I were you I would pass, it's very expensive and not a bolt on. If your car doesn't have much done to it there are better areas to spend money.  If your dead set on a crazy front swap, try looking at odyvia swaps too. They're much more expensive but I've only seen 1 in the usa and it didn't get finished. I think there's only like 5 in the world."

Although there's a lot of them on the internet and if you go to your local car meet or drift track you will probably see a few of them. They are definitely the best ""conversion"" out of all of them for a hatch. you could also save a few bucks and don't run a typex wing, like the yashio factory white s13. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWVRUAUbu3E"

240sx,3dgs3m,LancerAL,3,Thu Jul 16 03:45:11 2015 UTC,"That's not a '94. They only imported the convertible to the US in 1994. So if the title etc says its a '94, something is fishy.   It might actually run if you swap the fluids and put a new battery in. Pull a battery out of a friend's car and drop it in before you buy it. See if it turns over. If it does, get a loaner compression tester from autozone and check it out. Hell, change the oil and try to start it.   Why has it been parked for years? Usually something broke and the owner never fixed it.   This car costs $1000? If you decide it's a good buy, have another $1000 ready for all the broken shit you're about to replace. Have you ever driven a stick shift? If not, have another $200-1000 on hand for the clutch you're going to burn up over the next month, depending on whether you swap it yourself or pay a shop. That is, if there's anything left in there to begin with.   The transmission will shift smoothly when it's just sitting there. On the road is a completely different story. You'll have to actually get it running before you'll be able to tell if any of the synchros are messed up. A replacement tranny will run you around $200 usually.  Get underneath and check the frame rails for rust. If anything looks rusty, scrape it, stab at it with a screwdriver, see how rusty it is. The joints between the floorpan and rear wheel wells rust out also, so check them out too."

240sx,3dgs3m,speedsk8x,2,Thu Jul 16 07:01:14 2015 UTC,It's a 92'. I just messed up when deciphering the VIN.
240sx,3dgs3m,jut_taro,3,Thu Jul 16 18:54:56 2015 UTC,The 10th letter (N) in the VIN you posted would indicate that is a 1992 model.  This link has info on decoding the S13/S14 VIN: http://garage.projectraine.com/content_guides/240_vinmid/vinmid01.html
240sx,3dgs3m,Lakerz24Life,2,Thu Jul 16 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"Check the rails for sure, as well check inside the trunk where the spare tire would be. Even though it has a nasty hole in the trunk, it actually look relatively clean and unmolested. It doesn't look like a single kid had touched that car. Only thing else I would say is get under the car and have a look around, as well check for any wheel bearing and tie rod play which can both be checked at the same time. also i would check the brakes aren't leaking. Otherwise for a thousand bucks it would be hard to find something else in better shape even accounting for that rusted hatch. I live in the north east so I have seen some pretty bad rust, when I looked for my car. Oh also another reason to get under the car is to check the floor pans. I believe that the underside of a car is sometimes more telling about the condition of the car than the exterior."
240sx,3dgs3m,GordanRedwood,2,Thu Jul 16 14:30:48 2015 UTC,"With the money you're gonna spend to get it running great, might as well find a running 240 in decent shape for $2500... and avoid the head aches, if any.

240sx,3dgs3m,ItsSeanP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:30:50 2015 UTC,For 1000$ not a bad purchase at all in my opinion if those are actually the only rust spots. I live in the desert and haven't ever really had to worry about rust but I feel like the trunk lid is an odd spot so I would definitely check out under the car before you do anything.
240sx,3de6gv,sora0314,3,Wed Jul 15 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"That's the difficult way to do it. The best way is to pick up an in line fuse, momentary switch and 2 spade connecters. Find the fuse for the headlights under the dash and remove it. Then wire in the fuse holder and switch where the original fuse use to be. Put the switch someplace convenient. You are now done. To work them turn on your headlights. They don't pop up unless you flash your high beams. To lower them into position turn off your headlights then press the momentary switch until they are in the position you like.  This is the easiest way with no wire cutting and it is less than $5 in materials. And maybe 5-10 minutes of work."

The short version is that you need DOHC: * Engine harness/ecu. The SOHC harness has a different connector then the DOHC, which you will have to transfer over. Most people are going to tell you to cut and solder, matching color to color. personally I think that's jenky as hell and I would just de-pin and re-pin the connectors, again going color to color. The colors are all the same but in different spots, so you just need to transfer each wire one at a time over to their respective position on the SOHC connector. If that confused you, this guy has a series of videos explaining it. * PS pump/lines * AC pump/lines (if you're gonna have AC) * Tach. You can swap the whole cluster but the DOHC temp sensor reads higher then the SOHC, if you not you can remove the tach/dial from the DOHC motor and put in the SOHC cluster. * The rubber boot thing that goes from the throttle body to plastic intake tube. The DOHC throttle body sits lower so the SOHC one wont work. * Throttle cable, SOHC is shorter. * MAF"

240sx,3ddyjw,CommodoreDan,2,Thu Jul 16 06:07:27 2015 UTC,"If I were you I'd save my pennies. I've never done a Sohc to dohc swap but I believe it's a little wiring and a new gauge cluster and your basically done. But it's a lot of money for not much more motor. There's only a 15 horsepower difference between the two and virtually no reliability difference. A rb20 or ca18 swap is only 400-500 bucks more than the Ka your looking at and gives you more options. A sr20 is another swap to look at. But if your drifting, the Sohc is more than enough. I used it for a year and a half and could drift circles around guys with Sr swaps. Long story short, save the single jingle until you can afford a better motor."
240sx,3ddyjw,jut_taro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:44 2015 UTC,My original plan was to keep the single slammer bammer and save for a sr swap but from what I know once your oil pump goes out you basically need a rebuild which is what happened to my ka.

240sx,3d8a29,Griffin-dork,5,Tue Jul 14 21:42:11 2015 UTC,Its a dealership. They kind of make up prices. A CLEAN low mileage kouki like that (Im also assuming its a 5 speed) will command a high price. If its really as mint as you lead me to believe I could see them getting 8k for it. But who knows.   Should be noted I dont pay a lot for S chassis. Drift tax is insane anymore. If its still got a KA in it and its a 5 speed with no rust (the rest of it I couldnt give a shit about. Im replacing it all) Its a $2500 or less car to me.
240sx,3d8a29,SharkBait69,2,Tue Jul 14 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with your assessment (apart from a low mileage minty kouki being worth $2500, but that's what you said it is worth to you so that's that)...  Paying $12K for a stock 240SX seems outrageous.  I think I paid $7800 for my Zenki with 39K miles on it, and that was back in 1999."
240sx,3d8a29,Griffin-dork,2,Tue Jul 14 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"A kouki is obviously something special. I love kouki's but Im not after a mint low mileage one. If I were to get one I would want one already with a swap and such and wouldnt give a shit about miles. As it sits I wouldnt want it at all. Its just not for me.   Its definitely worth more than $2500, just not to me. It may go to someone who will really enjoy it. Or maybe some kid will have his parents buy it for him and he will wreck it trying to be ""The next DK"".   The way prices are for S chassis currently, I would rather import something or move to a different chassis altogether."

Beyond that a lot of people don't know about a lot of the cars. Laurels are sweet. Hell, import a chaser. 4 door luxury car with a 1J in it. We got the same chassis here I believe but its a very far off shot of what a chaser really is.   Sadly I have my heart set on an R32 skyline. So ill have to pay the premium. Luckily I don't want a GTR. Just a GTST. So they can still be had on the cheaper side."

240sx,3d4b1t,PoorMans180sx,3,Mon Jul 13 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"Make sure you get the surface on the plate cleaned as best as you can. when I resealed my transmission, I didn't get a good seal and I have been leaking fluid the last 3 months. I would try cleaning the inside of the the bell housing and the rear case. the issue I had was when I put the rear case back on there was some residual oil that was dripping into the gasket maker preventing a good seal.  So make sure you get that thing as clean as possible before you wiggle it back together. Also if you never dealt with transmissions before I would suggest to do a few dry runs putting the bell and the rear case on before you attempt to put the gasket maker on. Transmissions are a bit tricky to align back together properly and take some finessing. if you practice and find a way that you can get the selector fork aligned properly into the gates, which works every time you bolt it back together. and you obviously need to check that it shifts into gears so you know that it is aligned properly. Good luck and I hope you have better luck with it than I did."

You might have some regrets from time to time but you can always get back into a hobby car later. Keep the S13, spend a little on a more comfortable daily. Like an older civic or something. Boring, but cheap and comfortable. Then you can keep the S13 for any fun or track stuff, and comfort is no longer an issue.  Convert the s13 back to a comfortable daily driver. Swap in S14 seats, softer springs in the coilovers, new bushings or whatever is needed to reduce the rattles."

I would suggest something better than S14 seats (I have an S14 and the seats are not so great for track use).  The springs may not be the issue; quality dampers go a LONG way to making a ride comfortable. I would expect an IS300 to have a nicer interior and more power (well, I expect a lawn mower to have more power than a stock 240).

I might need to just swap it in when i'm not at the track, might make me more willing to drive the car around then I have been lately. Thanks for all the suggestions. I'm not in a huge Financial dilemma and maybe I made it seem like that, but current job/internship I have pays well, but I wouldn't have too much left for spending money or track days after doing a swap.

A friend of mine is 6 foot and 250ish, he cannot fit in my seat. I would not suggest getting a bucket seat, they become fairly uncomfortable on long rides and usually don't provide good lumbar support. Also highly suggest what ever you do for seats buy bride rails, they fit like a dream, they are worth every penny. I have a friend with a s14 he is 6' 2 ish and he doesn't have and issue fitting in the car at all, but he is pretty skinny. Another reason I would say not to get a bucket seat is they enclose your body so tightly that your sides never get any ventilation, so unless your ac works really well be prepared for swamp ass and a sweaty back. I know you didn't say you want a bucket, but just things to keep in mind as they do make larger sized bucket seats so it could've been something you were thinking of. I would say when it comes to seating I wouldn't cheap because besides your hands it is the main contact point between you and your car and if you are uncomfortable sitting in your car you won't want to drive it."

Got it in 2006, finally had to replace it in 2013. I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did, since I rarely drove my 240 at the time, and the car got very cold every winter.  Since then I've been using the WestCo 12V31M. No problems with that one, and I've been daily driving it since early last year.  The WestCo has a slightly higher CCA rating, the Marathon is a little cheaper, but I never really had an issue with either.

240sx,3cdo9b,I3emis,2,Fri Jul 10 01:51:03 2015 UTC,93 running 16 psi on a sr20. Thinking E85 cause it's only $1.85 down here...

240sx,3cdo9b,soggysecret,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:37 2015 UTC,"For me it does. In the winter I can run straight 91 and the SR doesn't complain too much. When it's 110* or more though, it falls on its face and spits/pops so I put a couple gallons of 100 in to shoot for 93-95 octane overall."
240sx,3cdo9b,mybyull,0,Wed Jul 8 03:34:09 2015 UTC,So during the summer premium and  in the winter reg pretty much? To dumb it down haha
240sx,3cdo9b,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:21:25 2015 UTC,More like premium in the winter and premium+ in the summer. That's for an SR with a factory ECU that's meant for 93 octane equivalent in Japan. That's not necessary in a KA.

240sx,3cb863,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"I have looked into this before, but looking to go with a higher gearing. From my understanding, although nissan used r200's in almost all their cars in the 90's era the final drive ring and pinions are not interchangeable between the diff's at least easily. From what I have read on drift works is that you will have fitment issues with the ring, pinion and the rear cover. I have yet to find any information regarding any companies that make a aftermarket final drive gear. I may be mistaken so you might have to look further, but you're probably better off looking at another transmission. I would say that you have a huge limiting factor that the 302 doesn't rev as high as a ka/sr so your not getting all the top end speed you could, but I'm also surprised to hear you are topping out at 130. although I don't really drive at 100mph often I'm pretty sure the top of 3rd gear I have reached at least 90. but the trans has a close ratio  3/4.  I would say try getting that G-force T5 or a T56. they go for about the same price. It really seems like you need a 6th gear. You probably could get something made for less than a new t56 though. Good Luck!"

Late-model Q45 diffs have stock axle patterns and are 3.69. I believe they have ABS sensors in the nose though.  There are a couple r200 final drive sets for sale on Zilvia right now. One 3.69 I believe.   Just make sure you have the diff setup properly and any r200 short nose ring and pinion will work fine."

240sx,3bvr8f,weebabyjanos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:09:48 2015 UTC,It is from enjuku and unless you wanna wait the 3 months I had to for this thing then go for it but they shipped it right to my door but if you know a shop you can get it delivered there as well and if that shop is already well connected through enjuku then even better because they'll probably get it sooner and in some cases cheaper and you won't get wierd looks of suspicion. Source: I know a a jdm shop in town  that's well connected but chose to ship at home.

240sx,3bx4q8,SirUnicow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:11:16 2015 UTC,I'll give some estimates on what I paid.   Coolant - 11  Thermostat and gasket - 14  Oil - 26  Oil filter - 7  Distributor cap and rotor - 19  Air filter - 7.50  NGK spark plugs + NGK wires - 42  Fuel filter -  12  Gear oil gl4 - 25  I forgot to add in the original post that a new o2 sensor would also be a good idea. My car went into limp mode when I was driving it because of a bad o2 sensor. Not fun. They're like 25 bucks.   So probably around 200ish depending on where you buy and what brands you choose. If you can't afford to buy this then you shouldn't drive the car until you have the money to do so. Not worth the risk imo.

240sx,3bqrt1,JoeyBigDick,6,Wed Jul 1 11:49:59 2015 UTC,"I did my swap on a 92 hatch, with a brand new clutch and flywheel.  The major thing to consider is your time. The first time i did it took me a few days, as opposed to the 12 hours most people suggest. This is probably the biggest con of the whole job. Seriously having the right tools for the job such as extensions and swivels will make your life alot easier when doing the bell housing bolts. The AT bushing you have to take out can take a while aswell, i suggest don't even try using a bearing puller just start drilling it out. I wound up using two different ones neither worked and i broke one.  If you plan on or have the money to do an sr swap in a month or two. I suggest waiting to do that. It took me almost a week and i was on spring break.  Another thing that can take a while is lining the manual up onto the engine.  Just things to consider. Also regardless of what anyone says, you have to use redline 75w-90 gl4 gear oil. Anything else will mess you synchros up. Don't use gl4/gl5 compatiable oils. The redline is 15 a bottle and u need 2.4 liters.  Lastly you can use your auto ecu, and you cannot use the auto drive shaft with the manual( I know that seems obvious but people said you could and I tried, it won't even line up), the wiring is simple you wire the reverse lights to the reverse switch on the trans and you have jumper a cable, but that is it, there is some guides on this stuff online, they will be missing some stuff, if you have questions message me and I will try to help you out.  Also if you have a 96(ODBII) or above be careful as you will run codes on your ecu if you don't switch to the manual ecu."

240sx,3bqrt1,drawspenisesonthings,2,Wed Jul 1 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"Don't drill out the spigot bush. That sounds like a nightmare. The best technique I've found is to hydraulic it out.  Pack the cavity behind the bush with as much grease as you can until it's full to the outside edge of the bush, then get a punch that's as snug of a fit inside the bush as possible and start hammering it into the grease. It'll usually bounce a few times and then the bush will start to come out. Keep hammering and repack with grease if you start bottoming out the punch.  If your like me it's unlikely you'll have the correct diameter punch so use a 3/8 extension with a socket that's a snug diameter. Put the socket on the extension backwards if you can otherwise you'll have to fill the socket with grease too. Any air in the bush or socket will make it bounce and you won't be able to make enough pressure"

I have done about 4 autocross sessions with HICAS and stock subframe bushings and boy oh boy does it hurt performance. Exiting any sort of corner while accelerating I get crazy vibration and loss of traction in the rear end. At this point drifting isn't even an option until I fix both problems.  HICAS delete requires either a bar you can buy or brackets that you bolt your toe rods to. After that I think you plug a couple power steering lines? I would say you can do this for under $150  Subframe bushings are a little harder as you have to remove the entire subframe. You basically burn out the old bushings and hammer the new ones in, that's about it. I'm pretty sure my subframe bushings were under $100.

It isn't constant though. Acceleration sounds cool.  But man, the ass is tight. I love it. Cornering is way better. It also got rid of the twerk steer.  I think the horrible 4th gear sounds is coming from the diff bushings. They might be a little too small. I was able to just slip the diff bushings in. I had to freeze and hammer in the actual subframe bushings. ISIS kit btw. I'll throw a little bead of window weld on the edges and report back.  If you have boost or a V8, you should definitely do something about the, probably broken, rubber bushings. Kaaz with stock bushings would twerk steer hard.

Spray lots and lots of carb cleaner through those fuel lines starting from the tank area and let it go through the whole line until it starts coming out right before the fuel filter.

Learning a little maintenance wouldn't hurt would it? Except maybe your pockets if you fuck up. ANYWAYS...  Ask why the engine was rebuilt.  Check the oil cap for sludge or old smelling oil.  Check for rust (frame rails!!!)  Check if belts are tight.  Look for any leaks or sludge.  Check to see if hoses are cracking or leaking.  Check wheels bearings and bushings for play.  See if it's missing any fender liner.  Do all the electricals work without hesitation?  Are the other fluids fresh?  Is the interior worn down? Drivers seat most likely will be.  Does the clutch feel tight?  Pull the spark plugs and inspect.  How much gas was in it? If it's near empty it might be a bad habit of theirs.  Rev up the motor and listen for any abnormal sounds, knocking, and ticking.  Drive it pretty mildly. Does it clunk under acceleration?  How are the brakes?  Does it clunk when you turn?  Does it have a spare?  Is the oil pan fucked?  Check the subframe and arms.  Does the engine bay look like a hack job?  I'm missing a lot but these are things I always check for in any used car.  Don't be swayed from a car you like because some people have had bad experiences. That happens with every car, but even more so with S chassis because of drifting/racing/cheap owners.  Take someone knowledgeable with you to inspect it."

240sx,3bd015,lukeskywakka,2,Mon Jun 29 05:19:28 2015 UTC,"It all depends where you live and the mods that will come with it. just to put it in perspective I paid 3500 for a s13 ka 140k miles second owner with kts coils, spl rucas,  z32 brakes front and rear, 5 lug swap, cusco struct bars front and rear, isis rad, s14 seats, magnaflow exhaust. It was an auto but the guy included a ton of parts, motor, trannies, brand new clutch and flywheel. another set of 300zx brakes/knuckles/5lug.  So I did the swap and got a very clean 5speed hatch.   I passed that car up on craigslist and zilvia maybe 4-5 times in my search for a 240, and I eventually went back to it. The more you learn about these cars while you look at them the more you will understand what you are paying for and what is worth paying for. Some people may look at what I bought and think it is over priced. But I was looking for a chassis with no rust, which I got ,But in the northeast it is very hard to find. So even though in some ways I over paid for a auto I got about 1k back in the parts I sold off and saved my self a good amount of time, buying it with those mods.   I wanted to buy something lightly modded, that has a rust free straight chassis. Unless you have the dough to go up in the 7-8k price range and buy something with a sr that has actually been properly done.   I do know someone who bought an auto zenki 95 that came with a 5 speed off ebay for 3200, but that was completely stock. You have to consider if there are mods on the car that you are definitely going to keep then consider that time saved and money saved. but if it has holes in the floor pan and rotted frame rails but still has all those mods, you are going to need to eventually go back and repair those pieces, which I don't think will be easy unless your some what skilled with welding thinner metal.   At the end of the day, I turned out with something that when I bring it to the track I get tons of compliments on the car just based on how clean it is. But like I said Know your goals because that can wind up saving you time and money, if you can save up a bit more money before you buy your car. Also I don't suggest asking what they go for on forums or reddit. because you are gonna hear people say some one over paid for something and then your gonna hear the stories where people got ridiculous deals. if you put the time in searching for one you will get a good one. It took me 4 monthes to get one and looked at about 7 of them. My suggestion to anyone is buy a set of stands and a jack, that way you can look underneath the cars you look at. The bottom of the car can tell a good story."

240sx,3b93xj,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Sat Jun 27 00:45:56 2015 UTC,"There is a good post on zilvia about suspension geometry and parts made for s-chassis with their functions. Also MotoIQ has I think a 8 part series about suspension modification overviews. Doing a full Suspension upgrade is not cheap, but you are going to want to buy quality parts, you will only have to buy it once and it beats spending lets say 350 on arms and going back and buying something better for 800, so you would windup spending 350 + 800 + 2 alignments. Also if you want to put wheels and lower your car I suggest doing it with at least your coils and arms that way you are only paying for an alignment once. As opposed to possibly 3 times. I know a friend who got a lifetime alignment from firestone for 130 dollars and he has gone back to them about 4 times, in  the last 4 months because every time you adjust something or put a new part you are going to need it to be aligned. You can do an alignment yourself but seriously for 130-170 for a lifetime alignment, the time and money pays for its self. If your wheels are gonna stay the same size than don't worry too much about that. One thing to note is depending on what type of rack alignment shops have, you can only lower the car so much until they won't put your car on the rack, just keep that in mind. I would suggest something like PBM coils they have pricey shipping, but they are high quality. Also Fortune auto from what I have heard is relatively good. remember Coils are a moving part and under high stress. you don't want to cheap on things of that nature."

I know the clocking of the flywheel is important on the OBD2 KA24DE because their crankshaft position sensor reads the teeth of the flywheel.  I'm pretty sure the older KA24 (like your car should have) only has a position sensor in the distributor.  EDIT: I remember now I've seen a '93 engine with the pin on the crankshaft.

240sx,3ad06c,the-ferris,4,Fri Jun 19 04:17:08 2015 UTC,on the back of the block right in front of where the transmission mates to the block. on the drivers side there is a shiny metal polished surface.  it will say RB20 or RB25 but it will be hand chiseled so quite rough.   its most likely an rb20 haven't seen any rb25det without the step up on the back of the cam covers.
240sx,3ad06c,I_Like_Cars,0,Fri Jun 19 03:00:54 2015 UTC,Also it doesn't have VVTi so unless its the incredibly rare series 1 rb25 I am about 90% sure its rb20det.
240sx,3ad06c,I_Like_Cars,6,Fri Jun 19 03:02:37 2015 UTC,You mean VCT which all rb25 has and Series 1 isn't rare at all.

240sx,3ad06c,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,3,Fri Jun 19 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"That'd be an RB20DET. The 25 had a divided crankcase breather hose fitting on the intake side valve cover. The 20 had a single shared breather in that location.  Another giveaway is the brass ""freeze plug"" on the forward plenum end. Unless the Intake Manifold was swapped, which would be dumb.   http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v613/dmargrave/enginebay-rb20.jpg  http://www.gtrcanada.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/rb25det1.jpg"

240sx,3ad06c,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:12:52 2015 UTC,It's definitely a 20. The lack of VTC on the intake cam gear is dead giveaway. And the 25s have bumps in the back on the valve covers.

240sx,3af20i,Shazbot24,2,Fri Jun 19 16:33:53 2015 UTC,"How do I test the car?   Maybe build a pressure tester to help track down any intake leaks. Use a source of compressed air to make sure the wastegate opens. Turn it on and check for oil/water and exhaust leaks.   I was thinking of setting with getting Slotted Rotors spec-ed for a S14 and reuse my current calipers. Would that be sufficient?   Sufficient for what? The stock brakes are perfectly fine if you don't do a lot of repeated hard stops. Heck, the stock brakes with upgraded pads are probably fine for a lot of aggressive driving. The only performance reason to go with larger brakes is heat capacity -- the larger rotors will heat up less, meaning you can go with a less aggressive pad compound and still have fade resistance.  Also, FYI, if you want Z brakes, you can put them on without doing a 5-lug swap. Lots of people (myself included) just drill 3 extra holes in the Z rotor, using a stock rotor as a template."
240sx,3af20i,asad137,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:03:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. Definitely gave me answers I was looking for. I actually got the hubs a while back because of the rims I planned to put on. I won't be doing the Z32 brakes. Maybe just go for better rotors (mine are slightly warped).   As for the test run. It turned over fine. But I have a coolant leak due to a bad fitting. Gah

240sx,3a9g6c,Tacos666_,3,Thu Jun 18 08:28:53 2015 UTC,Atleast you have some freedom for modifications. Your pretty limited to whats legal in Aussie.
240sx,3a9g6c,drawspenisesonthings,3,Thu Jun 18 08:46:36 2015 UTC,"Fairly sure they have stricter emissions control laws in cali then we do in Aus, though that may just be conjecture."
240sx,3a9g6c,mowbuss,3,Thu Jun 18 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know what Aussie emissions laws are, but CA emissions controls are indeed extremely strict. Everything between the air filter and catalytic converter is regulated. You can't swap out any regulated component unless the manufacturer has been granted an exemption for that component from the California Air Resources Board. Getting an exemption requires the manufacturer to do full drive-cycle testing to show that the replacement part does not produce higher emissions than the OEM part it replaces. And the biennial emissions tests include a visual check to look for non-exempt components."
240sx,3a9g6c,asad137,3,Thu Jun 18 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"This is why I dont understand why California is such a car haven. Im over here in PA and they could give fuck all about modifications. Its technically illegal in some respects. But you wont ever be pulled over or cited for it. Engine swaps, suspension mods, wide body, whatever.   Friend has an S14, SR swap, full suspension with modded knuckles, 2 inch extended lower control arms, and about 8* of camber in the front. A well sorted drift car. He got it fucking inspected lol. And it managed to pass emissions without a cat on it (engine runs perfectly and is super clean).   He drives it on the street and never gets bothered. Gets a lot of weird looks but never any trouble from cops."

240sx,3a9g6c,GLchrillz,2,Thu Jun 18 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"This is why I dont understand why California is such a car haven   A lot of it is historical - Southern California was arguably the birthplace of hot rods and the culture that surrounds it. It doesn't hurt that the weather's good (no snow, not much rain) so driving and working on modified cars can be a year-round activity. But I agree, it's not very friendly to cars that are subject to emissions control, even more so since they suspended the 30-year rolling emissions exemption."
240sx,3a9g6c,asad137,3,Thu Jun 18 19:16:18 2015 UTC,So what have the hot rod guys done? That essentially makes their cars all illegal doesn't it?
240sx,3a9g6c,Griffin-dork,2,Thu Jun 18 19:46:51 2015 UTC,Cars 1976 and older aren't subject to emissions regulations.

Mild camber -2 or -3, some toe out Rear with stock style knuckle     Positive .5 degrees camber, a lot of toe in.  Also we run relatively soft spring rates and medium size sway bars depending upon the track, that way you get a lot of suspension travel, and as the car squats you will get to around 0 camber or slight negative camber, and also the toe in promotes good forward grip and side bite in drift.  With that being said, our cars make a ton of power and run a relatively large tire, if you havent done a lot of drifting, setting a car up like that with a good tire and not a lot of power it may be difficult to drive.  Also you dont want a 215 on the front, its going to suck most likely. Go with a 235/40 or something along those lines so you actually have some grip."

Other than that just plug it all in and go. Stock ECU, Stock wiring, everything. Just use stock SR engine and transmission mounts. As for 5 speed swapping its the same as doing it to any other car. You will need to add a clutch pedal, and replace or modify your brake pedal as well as add in a clutch slave cylinder.   http://www.enjukuracing.com/ has a ""5 speed swap"" section for 240sx's.

240sx,39zgkr,frsh2fourty,4,Tue Jun 16 06:26:56 2015 UTC,"They're unnecessary luxuries for a car purpose built for drifting. Removal of the ac compressor and ac components not only sheds weight, but takes away the vampiric effect on the pulley system. It's a big enough benefit to take advantage of considering that it's free"
240sx,39zgkr,samdamanzo,2,Tue Jun 16 07:40:13 2015 UTC,"It depends. When you get to the competitive level, all weight matters. When you do a cage you have to pull deadening at least around the mounting points for the cage."
240sx,39zvjh,Apply_Juice_45,3,Tue Jun 16 03:16:38 2015 UTC,Do an LS instead. More power with less effort on the motor. Can push it harder that the others
240sx,39zvjh,allboutnuthin,4,Tue Jun 16 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"Can concur. I went SR. Like it, but sorta wish I went v8 because of how easily accessable parts are along with loads of power for not much effort."
240sx,39zvjh,purovida94,3,Tue Jun 16 06:53:52 2015 UTC,I don't want to go out of country with the car. I just feel it's not right.
240sx,39zvjh,TwoDeuces,2,Tue Jun 16 07:48:10 2015 UTC,"For a daily, though, the piece of mind of the LS is worth it."
240sx,39zvjh,harris101,3,Tue Jun 16 10:34:09 2015 UTC,"I hear people say this all the time, but neither me or any of my friends with SR's have any reliability issues at all.. What exactly are people referencing when they say that an LS is more reliable than an sr?"
240sx,39zvjh,TwoDeuces,3,Tue Jun 16 12:06:32 2015 UTC,"Domestic engines are much easier to source parts for. Forced induction introduces a number of factors (more parts, more heat, etc) that shorten the life of many parts. General age is also a factor, the last of the SR engines was produced around 2002.    I'm sure there are more points, I'm not shiting on the SR, it's one of the best engines ever produced, but I think it's life is sunsetting, where the LS series is still thriving."
240sx,39zvjh,harris101,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:27:15 2015 UTC,"I guess.. Is it really that hard to get parts there though?  I suppose being in Australia I have easier access to parts, but I know probably 20 people with SR's, alot of them old like early 90s,  and they are ridiculously reliable as long as you don't chase mad power or drive around town on limiter..    How much are SR's vs LS engines over there? You can get SR's with a box for about a grand here, but ls's are about 3 with an auto box, and around 4 with a manual box.."
240sx,39zvjh,TwoDeuces,2,Tue Jun 16 13:05:01 2015 UTC,"being in Australia   That is a great point. I just assumed you were in the States, sorry. Here in the US the SR was only originally imported in extremely limited quantities (the only car I can think of that came with one was the Infinity G20, and that was the DE, not the DET, and FR setup, not RWD that we want) so every single swap here is imported from Japan.    The vast majority of engines imported are purchased by... unreliable... auto parts companies (usually Chinese owned) from Japanese auto recyclers. The engines are not tested, not shipped very well, and generally a mess. There are some exceptions but the really reliable guys charge a premium for a good product. Even so, we generally have no idea about history or mileage of any of the parts we're buying and, because they're usually removed from the cars, a lot of people buy a set, get it here, and then discover that they're missing all the dressing you'll need to get it installed, no ECU, no wiring harness, no mounts, and sometimes no A/C, no alternator(!!!), no starter, etc.    As far as price, I wouldn't advise paying less than $2500 for a red top, and $4000 for a black top, and I would be very careful about where I got them from. No eBay, that's for sure.    For $7000 you can buy a domestic LS2 + Tremec T56 (6 speed trans) with low miles, and you'll get a complete history of the car it came from.    You can get even cheaper if you're willing to go to the salvage yard and pull the engine and trans yourself, probably as little as $5500, maybe less. Those will generally come with almost everything you need to complete the swap, sans subframe/mounts/shaft."
240sx,39zvjh,TwoDeuces,2,Tue Jun 16 13:57:49 2015 UTC,I live in California . Not many cops can tell the difference between an sr and a ka. But the difference between an ls and ka is huge.
240sx,39zvjh,TwoDeuces,4,Tue Jun 16 11:40:14 2015 UTC,"Why does that matter? As long as the engine is newer than the original engine and meets CA emissions it should be legal. In fact, any Kouki owners that went SR would be 50 state ILLEGAL, but an LS2 or LS3, with connected emissions would be 50 state LEGAL."
240sx,39zvjh,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Tue Jun 16 12:30:34 2015 UTC,I don't have 7 grand to drop in an ls motor now the fab experience to get it correctly in there. Also if I did somehow get an ls motor for cheaper. How would I go through bar with it?
240sx,39zvjh,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"BAR wouldn't be a problem. You'd need to have a specific inspection done for the engine replacement which would, if passed, result in a certificate from the State of CA approving the modification. Then you would simply go about the normal BAR process.    In order to pass the inspection all of the emissions equipment that was OEM for the engine you swapped in would have to be connected and working. This isn't really that difficult. But yes, the initial cost is steep. However the end result is a 50 state street legal mod. AFAIK there is no legal way in California to swap in an SR/RB. You gotta ""know a guy"" if you know what I mean."

ACTUAL Navan aero will need to be more than likely pieced together by either you, or the person you're buying the Navan kit from. The limited amount produced and available makes this process both VERY expensive and time consuming for the person sourcing the pieces.  That said, the Navan Aero Kit is pretty hot.

Drifted and dailied, and never had an issue. I would be worried with anything over 7mm that wasnt bolt on.  You want as much theead contact as possible.  But my works were wide rims, so the threads disapeared fast.  If your rims are thinner, where your lugs are, you might be able to get away with wider spacers.  But 38.. is bolt on time. You can also upgrade to extended nizmo lugs, but if you are on a budget, that might not be an option."

It just doesn't look right on an S14? Now the S13.4 Coupes create the perfect match of body lines and headlight shaping.   The perfect match of body lines and headlight shaping short of the R34 Skyline of course. Which, as we all know IS the most beautiful car ever manufactured."

240sx,39jjg5,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Sun Jun 14 15:42:02 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Aren't they both 13.4's?
240sx,39jjg5,SPVCEGXXN,4,Fri Jun 12 16:30:43 2015 UTC,No. The green one has a Silvia front end.
240sx,39jjg5,THAT__guy_,3,Fri Jun 12 17:08:50 2015 UTC,just noticed it's right hand drive. It is a Silvia lol
240sx,39jjg5,THAT__guy_,2,Fri Jun 12 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"Oh gotcha. So excuse my ignorance, but are there Silvia versions of all the s-chassis?"
240sx,39jjg5,SPVCEGXXN,3,Fri Jun 12 17:27:45 2015 UTC,S(ilvia)-Chassis
240sx,39jjg5,eejjkk,2,Fri Jun 12 19:44:02 2015 UTC,exactly. Silvia's are just the jdm counterpart. Aka right hand drive versions. It's only a Silvia conversion if it's put on a left hand drive.
240sx,39jjg5,THAT__guy_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:31:49 2015 UTC,So then the front end on the green one is from an s14? Also do the Silvia's not have different engines?
240sx,39jjg5,SPVCEGXXN,3,Fri Jun 12 22:45:29 2015 UTC,No that's an S13 Silvia front.
240sx,39jjg5,soggysecret,2,Sat Jun 13 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"THESE specific Silvia's, not sure on the selected engines. They are right hand drive and upgraded in the JDM-ish style though so i'd say SR, JZ or RB probably.  In general, the factory S13 and S14 generation Silvia's came with 1 of 4 different engines. N/A and DET variants of the CA and SR motors.  That being said, putting a different front end on a USDM S13 or S14 chassis 240sx, a ""Nissan Silvia"" does not make. This would be why I did NOT include the KA motor in the above Engine Options. The Nissan 240sx shares a majority of its CHASSIS and many of the Chassis related parts with the Nissan Silvia, but it is NOT a Nissan Silvia.  It can however be modified and easily accepts each and every part that the Nissan Silvia came standard with. 100% of them will, (in a specific install order obviously) piece for piece swap onto a 240sx. But the end result will still be a 240sx."

240sx,39jjg5,lordlurid,-10,Fri Jun 12 08:39:55 2015 UTC,Lol..lambo killer. Someone's kidding themselves.
240sx,39jjg5,Sir_Smashing,10,Fri Jun 12 07:51:47 2015 UTC,"2014 Lamborghini Gallardo: Curb weight; 1954lbs (lightest trim) (edit: derp, 2954) Power; 562 HP (most powerful trim) 562/2954= power to weight ratio of .190   1993 240sx coupe: Curb weight; 2700 (92' coupe) 2700x.190=513.7HP in order to match the power to weight ratio of the Lambo. So, all Mr.2j has to do is beat ~515HP and he is, on paper, faster then the lambo. If he's making 550 or more he shouldn't have too much trouble.  Sorry to be a dick, but anyone who spends ~$200k on a Lambo thinking they'll be the fastest thing on the road is a moron. Anyone with $25k a little creativity can mop the floor with that car."
240sx,39jjg5,lordlurid,3,Fri Jun 12 08:39:03 2015 UTC,1954lbs my ass. I'll eat a sock if the Gallardo weighs less than a tonne. I think the Sesto elemento is just under.  A gallardo is way over 3000lbs with the 4wd system and all.
240sx,39jjg5,Cmon_Just_The_Tip,3,Fri Jun 12 09:23:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I messed up typing it in, 2954lbs."
240sx,39jjg5,lordlurid,-5,Fri Jun 12 09:33:48 2015 UTC,"Mate, your maths doesn't check out.  562/1954 = 0.29 So the 13 would need 783hp to get the same power to weight...no to mention its gonna be heavier than stock with a 2j in it.   In any case, there's a lot more to how fast a car is than just power to weight, and I'm also sure that there are many, many lambos out there that would absolutley destroy this car, to mention a lambo is a fucking lambo. Not a fucking 20 year old cheap entry level jap sports car.  I will give praise where praise is due and love seeing a nice s-chassis that has been looked after and isn't your average drift pig or stance junk. However, calling it a lambo killer is just stupid."
240sx,39jjg5,Sir_Smashing,6,Fri Jun 12 08:59:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, that was a typo. The curb weight of a Lamborghini Gallardo is 2954, not 1954, so my math is correct. Google it if you don't believe me. KA weights ~371lbs fully dressed. 2jz weighs ~594lbs fully dress, and that's with the stock turbos/manifold which a swapped motor won't have. So that's 220lbs to account for, if we're generous. That puts the 240 and the lambo right around the same weight.  still, 783hp is perfectly attainable with a 2jz. Also, you're right, power to weight oversimplifies it. My whole point is that if you want to go faster then a stock lambo, that's not exactly the highest bar to set. You don't buy a lambo cause it's fast, you buy a lambo cause it's a god damn Lamborghini. And yeah, the tuning potential is much higher for the lambo then the 240. I just find it funny that people will look at beating a lambo like it's some kind of impossible feat of engineering. Anyone with money can do it.  I agree that ""lambo killer"" is dumb. I don't care if my car can beat the god damn space shuttle, I'll never call it ""my ____ killer"".  That doesn't mean I don't want to see the look on his face when you smoke is his super car in your 20 year old Nissan."

I don't doubt it's fucking quick with that 2j in it...but just because you beat one lambo in a straight line doesn't make it a lambo killer. I can appreciate the car, but whenever I see someone call their car a  ____killer, I just think its a vain attempt at convincing themselves their car is more than what it is."
240sx,39jjg5,Cmon_Just_The_Tip,4,Fri Jun 12 09:07:19 2015 UTC,"What would make it a Lambo killer then? He clearly smoked it in that video.  Of course you can argue that design wise and prestige wise it can't compete, but I think that's besides the point.  Bottom line is, it's quicker. The Lambo might best it from a standstill being 4wd. I'd feel safer in the Lambo at 200mph, but that's it.  I'd bet money that with the right suspension and tyre setup the s13 would flog it on a track too. In my books that's quite a respectable achievement."
240sx,39jjg5,Sir_Smashing,-12,Fri Jun 12 09:31:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe if it beat the fastest lambo there is :P There's plenty of slow lambos out there. Fuck, I reckon my old n/a s13 could have beaten a lambo if I picked the right one ...doesn't mean I'd call it a lambo killer afterwards."
240sx,39jjg5,soggysecret,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:41:13 2015 UTC,Nothing is an anything killer until it beats the fastest one? That's fucking stupid.

I've used ""Great Stuff"" spray foam to remake by own foam bumper cover support inserts. Fill the backside of the bumper cover where you have the sagging with Great Stuff. Let it set.

I just searched my local craigslist and eBay, and there are still plenty of cheap s14's popping up for sale. And they still run! I'd say the average around North Carolina looks to be about 4500$ for a decent s14. Buy one somewhere else and ship it. Who cares if it runs, you're gonna swap the motor anyways. Just make sure the frame is straight and rust free, then move on with the project."

Youre buying more than the shell unless you trash all the extras. So you're gonna form the doors, roof, quarter panels, trunk, glass, not to mention all the interior cuts like the dashboard support. I think your project is wayyyyy out of the scope of this sub and I also think the amount of time you'd spend recreating an existing shell is worth more than $4-6k to buy one."

Are the possibilities limitless or do you need it to be reasonable? I can guarantee you a jet-fueled turbine car with electric assist would really impress people at the local import meet.  And honestly, what's the point of coming to a 240sx subreddit and asking for advice? The only thing about your car that will be even 240sx-related is the body kit that was designed for one. And designing a whole car around a body kit is pretty much the stupidest thing I've ever heard. If you can make everything else, why not make your own front body panels too? Why constrain yourself to designing within the parameters of that kit when it's by far the least important part of your planned build?"

I'd probably have to custom press my own cv joints as well. 0_0   Like I said before, having access to this stuff is only a small part of the problem. Throw enough money around and you'll find someone who can make anything. The issue is designing all of this stuff, and designing it so that it can actually be manufactured. Given your background I assume you understand the latter point, but the former is probably well beyond your scope. Your creation will not be better than a stock 240SX chassis simply by virtue of it being custom made. You have to understand Nissan has hundreds if not thousands of people involved with the design of any given car. You can cut out some of the fat because I assume you are building this thing as a (street legal?) race car, but you still need to tackle the most difficult parts including the actual chassis and suspension. To be clear, what are your intentions for this thing? If you just want something cool and custom made to show off at at your local car show then you can probably do that. Fab a simple tube chassis, bolt and weld on everything you can from a 240SX, shoehorn in your engine of choice and you're pretty much there. It won't be safe, it won't be fast, and it won't ever be allowed on a track, but it'll look cool in a parking lot.  If you are actually planning to race/track day this thing then whether you like it not safety is paramount. Second, the car actually needs functional suspension, durability, and reliability. That is where you're going to run into problems. The best thing you can do is find someone who knows what they are doing and pay them a lot of money to figure it out for you. Short of that, I'd suggest modeling the entire S14 stock suspension as a starting point. Making small modifications from there will save you hundreds of hours compared to starting from scratch even if you did have the knowledge to do it. You could even just bolt up the entire S14 subframe and crossmember but that's almost entirely defeating the point of building a one-off car. If you want to go double A-arm on the front the easiest way is probably taking the entire setup off a Z32 or Skyline and figuring out how to mount it. If you're going mid-engine you will have a lot more room to work with in front.  You can do this, I don't doubt that. The question is what you want out of it. I assumed you want a custom race car built from the ground up, but I see that may not be the case. If you take shortcuts by bolting on S chassis parts or copying them where possible this is feasible, but leads me to further question why you wouldn't want to just start with the Nissan chassis. Anyway, you don't have to justify yourself to me. I think the best first step would be to outline very specifically what you want to do. What are your goals for the car? What is going to be custom fabricated? What is going to be used off a 240SX? What can you source from the aftermarket? Start with the big stuff: subframe, crossmember, engine, etc. For each part that must be fabricated, why are you fabbing it rather than using a stock/off the shelf part? What do you want to change? The answers to these questions will dictate the build and give you a much more clear picture of the work ahead of you so that's a good place to start."

The slave is on the passenger side of the trans and the damper is just across from it in the frame rail. Personally, I would flush all the fluid, remove the dampener (it's two bolts and bending a hardline), the refill and bleed that well.  The dampener is useless and makes it a bitch to bleed. I had all these issues with my Sr.  If you want you can use a braided line to replace the whole hardline and makes it easier to bleed. I used the ISIS auto to manual one because it's much longer than just a manual line. Cost like 50 dollars."

You still need a bunch of more shit. Without this knowledge, believe me, you'll be in for a headache.  If I had to answer the question though? A stock KA will only hold so much boost.

Bigger pipe, is not automatically more power, better flow, or necessarily good at all... and never straight pipe anything without a turbo on it.. the lack of back pressure will usually cost you power rather than gain it, and your valves will burn up much, MUCH quicker...their is actually a lot more science to exaust systems than most people realize (Honda drivers).. and function should always be a higher priority than looks or sound..  that's my exaughst tip (pun intended) and good deed for the year.

240sx,386pr5,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Tue Jun 2 16:54:45 2015 UTC,What's the benefit of having the 4-2-1 header? Seems like that's only about $50 or so.
240sx,386pr5,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,3,Tue Jun 2 17:12:12 2015 UTC,It tunes the exhaust flow differently and moves the power more into the midrange.
240sx,386pr5,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Tue Jun 2 17:39:04 2015 UTC,So the header is generally just to give more power or power efficiency is what I'm understanding?
240sx,386pr5,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,3,Tue Jun 2 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"Not really. The header, otherwise known as the exhaust manifold, exists to get burned air/fuel out of the engine and into the exhaust, but the way the manifold is designed can have an effect on the way power is made and delivered. If the engine can ""breathe"" more easily, it will then be more efficient and therfore more powerful. N/A engines are very sensitive to exhaust setups, specifically, the style of collector, and the length of the header pipes. By altering the way the exhaust gasses leave the engine, you can alter the power and delivery of the engine."

That's why when I was researching I didn't necessarily pay attention to the parts about the diameter of the exhaust but yeah I'll be returning the one I purchased. I honestly DO have about $600 to burn but I was hoping that I could get one fairly cheap and $110 just sounded too good. I guess I'll take /u/V_WhatTheThunderSaid 's advice and get the ISIS blast pipes and the 4-2-1 header which seems like it'll ring me around $300.

You could manually move it with the hand.  The comment I want to make is that your missing 2 adjusters that are crucial for lowering, and raising the ride high and locking it to the bracket seen in 2nd note. Without those, I could you could adjust the ride height by grabbing ahold of the first note that I point out and spin it. Or taking the piece off and spinning the bracket in my second note, then reinstalling it. Which would be a painfully annoying procedure so measure twice the height/drop you need and do it once.  (you might be able to find those adjuster spinner things and a spanner tool online, I think that would be ideal for safety/easier down the road reasons.)  Good luck and let me know if this helps!"

240sx,385c8m,SirUnicow,3,Mon Jun 1 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"A gigantic exhaust like that would only really provide noticeable gain with a turbo setup. You'd probably be better off with a smaller diameter pipe and a tuned manifold.   But if you just want your car to loud af and rhaspy, it'll get the job done."
240sx,385c8m,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,2,Mon Jun 1 23:58:10 2015 UTC,I actually had no idea previous to me buying it that the size would affect the car's performance or such.

240sx,385c8m,V_WhatTheThunderSaid,3,Tue Jun 2 00:01:34 2015 UTC,"On the stock exhaust manifold, you'll probably lose a little bit of power. Maybe 5-10 at the most.   The reason is that N/A engines need a little bit of back pressure to keep the exhaust gasses flowing properly. This is why the length of the headers is important to N/A engines. On a turbocharged engine, it doesn't matter, because the turbo is in the way of the exhaust gasses exiting the engine in a pattern. I'd go for a 3 inch pipe and a 4-2-1 style header. That will pick you up some power instead of losing it."

240sx,37w39v,AbandonedTeddy,8,Sat May 30 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"There is no other way to learn than to practice. And not on the street either. Go to an event. Besides seat time, find someone who knows what theyre doing and ask for a ride along. Or even better get them to ride with you and tell you what you are doing wrong. If your event has a skidpad try this: Do tight donuts, then edge larger until you get the feel of sliding. Then start learn figure eights, wide at first then tighter and smaller. It'll help with your transitions. Eventually you start practicing with the ebrake and clutch kicks.  One of the issues I had when I started out was thinking I needed to manhandle the wheel. When you start to slide, just let go of the steering wheel. You cant turn the wheel as fast as you need to and the car will fix itself."
240sx,37w39v,CommodoreDan,3,Sat May 30 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"Dont stop the car from steering itself. What I mean by that is let go briefly after the end starts to swing to allow the car to countersteer itself. if you force the car to steer into the turn too long it will cause a spin. Instead try and feel the sweet spot before you spin and let the momentum of the car point the front wheels where you want to go by letting the steering wheel spin in your hands. Also, dont go full open throttle the whole corner (if you can help it). Other than that its practice. Be smart and don't endanger innocent people, and dont damage peoples property either."
240sx,37w39v,KBoMb240,2,Sun May 31 04:34:41 2015 UTC,It seems to me like it takes a lot of natural talent. Some people just don't understand it like math.  Try a ride along with someone with a manual.  Clutch kicks are the shit and it's very rare to see someone accomplish a sustained drift in a slushbox.
240sx,37w39v,bmcnult19,1 point,Sun May 31 09:24:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know that to be the case. I've given quick lessons to unlikely people (two girlfriends who were not especially good at driving) and both of them could execute a chicane turn after a few times out getting the feel of the car.    It sounds really corny but if you can find a big open place like a parking lot, close your eyes or at least don't pay attention to what you see and actually concentrate on the feel of the car, how the weight shifts during lateral pitch, feel how the suspension naturally reacts."
240sx,37w39v,TwoDeuces,2,Sun May 31 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"Only way to do it is to practice. And NOT on the street. Go to events and do it there. Trying to learn on the street or even in lots is idiotic.   Oh, and your friend who ""drifts"" his automatic open diff S14. Yeah, that doesn't happen. He has to at least have an LSD in it or something. 3 things needed to drift. Manual transmission, rear wheel drive, and some form of locking diff. But welded is best/most predictable."

If you want to street drift, go for it, just don't put other people in danger if you don't know what your doing. Your best bet is to practice in that empty lot when no one is around, or scout out new spots on the weekend.  As for actual driving tip, just practice initiating a e brake turn at 25-30mph in the rain, and maintaining the drift with a combination of gas and counter steering. As you do it more often, it will become more natural and you'll start to understand how the car behaves. If the spots really open, practice in the dry as well.  And you will crash, eventually. Its just part of the learning process. Keep it in empty, open areas, and the worst that will happen is you'll smack a curb, break some suspension."

Tore the engine down to the shortblock, dropped the front crossmember, removed just about everything I could stand to and started stripping it down to metal. This served a couple purposes because I wanted to fix some leaks between the block and upper oil pan so it made sense to do it all at once.  Once I got it down to the bare metal I did some minor hammering and fixing holes and damage. Then it was time for a couple coats of epoxy primer, I went with the Summit Racing DTM Epoxy primer, same thing I used on the body a while back and it worked pretty well. Easy to shoot, easy to sand, great since I'd never done any sort of automotive paint before.  Tonight I did some sanding and filling to fix the few runs and drips I had but i'll be laying the paint down either tomorrow night or monday night. I'll be using the Summit Racing Acrylic Urethane Single stage paint in Pure White.   Sorry for the cell phone pics but I don't have a fancy camera."

240sx,3711z7,EM1N,5,Sat May 23 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"Don't cheap out on the gauges, go with electric sensors so you don't have oil running into the cabin. Autometer should be the cheapest you're considering, don't even look at Sunpro or whatever other cheapos are still out there.  Keep up with maintenance, a good flush and fill on all fluids (including brake fluid), check suspension bushings, lights, etc. At this age its more about identifying problems early than preventative maintenance. You'd drive yourself crazy and broke replacing everything.  Oil cooler is sort of a waste unless you know its overheating or causing problems. Running the proper weight is more important than a cooler at first."
240sx,3711z7,abductee92,2,Sat May 23 23:22:52 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the oil cooler help the car run smoother? Im also getting a baffled oil pan so it can hold more oil
240sx,3711z7,abductee92,2,Sun May 24 00:25:31 2015 UTC,"Smoother? Not really. I mean if you're running it hard on the track all day then it would help. I would install the temp gauge first and get an idea of what your temperature is now. I have the baffled oil pan and a filter relocation setup and with the increased capacity my oil temp rarely registered on the gauge, even in Georgia in August, so I converted it to a water temp gauge. Still have the oil pressure gauge but my temps were never high enough to sweat."
240sx,3711z7,ryansx,2,Sun May 24 00:46:54 2015 UTC,What if i get a cooler gauge? And does the oil pan from an sr fit on ka? I couldn't find a bigger baffled oil pan for ka
240sx,3711z7,abductee92,2,Sun May 24 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"if the car is going to be nothing but a daily with occasionally running it hard, you wont need a baffled oil pan or an oil cooler. Never had an issue with mine and 100*+ days. Get a coolant temp gauge instead because the factory gauge is garbage"
240sx,3711z7,Nismo240guy,2,Sun May 24 01:12:23 2015 UTC,Thanks!
240sx,3711z7,whyteboi,2,Sun May 24 01:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah just run the temp gauge, I doubt very much that the SR pan fits a KA. I also agree with /u/ryansx, these parts seem sort of superfluous on a daily or mild street car. So look into an oil pressure gauge, water temp gauge, and if you're really feeling crazy then you can get an oil temp gauge. Grab a set of gauge pods, frog eye mount or one of the center vent pod setups just to keep an eye on things. New parts are cool and exciting but I'm sure there are better places to spend money. They may not be as flashy but they'll keep your baby on the road and off the jack stands."

240sx,36xv0n,Smellylegmeat,2,Sat May 23 02:31:06 2015 UTC,"Wait, isn't it illegal to swap engines in California?"
240sx,36xv0n,Smellylegmeat,3,Sat May 23 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"Nope, common misconception. It's perfectly legal to swap engines in California provided that you: 1) Swap a motor that was, at one point, sold in the US. (So the SR20DET is out, 1JZ is out, etc.) 2) The motor you plan to swap is newer then the chassis it's going into. So a '92 s13 would need a motor from '92 or after. 3) You can't swap motors from one ""class"" of vehicle to another. I believe this goes by weight, but the gist of it is don't put a truck motor in your sports car. 4) The new motor must maintain all smog equipment. Also, you'd have to fallow the same rules with aftermarket mods, so only CARB legal stuff. For the 2jz I believe all you need is the EGR and a cat.  There might be 1 or 2 more rules I'm forgetting but that's basically it. There are no rules about swapping motors from one make to another, or anything about motors ""intended for the chassis."" Which is all stuff I've heard people say."

I'm honestly not sure something like that exists for a stock T25. Even searched a bit for you and came up empty. You'd probably have to custom make something out of stainless and AN fittings. Not sure how you'd affix the engine side though.
240sx,36waxl,omgwtfitsandrew,2,Sat May 23 00:14:36 2015 UTC,Thanks man. I have done plenty of searching/ordering. AN fittings don't help much because the turbo side hole isn't threaded.

When I'm at full lock I'll rub only on the driver side, but I just changed to SPL tension rods and that seemed to help out a bit. Dem anniversaries bro!"
240sx,36sm8l,futility_jp,2,Thu May 21 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"At that ride height you are going to damage the harness during hard cornering. I wouldn't bother trying to bandaid the problem by raising the car, do it right and get the harness out of there. The easy way is pulling off the fender and running it along the outside of the upper chassis rail (there is a lip it will sit that also prevents the fender from crushing it). This only takes a few minutes and some zip ties, but if you have any collision on that fender it will likely destroy the harness. The other option is cutting the harness, running both ends into the engine bay, then extending it to connect the two sides again inside. this will keep it well out of harms way but is obviously considerably more work. Either way is much better than the stock location. The harness on the passenger side is much smaller but I would at least route that one along the chassis rail as well.  You can see the lip along the bottom of the chassis in these pictures. If you go the easy route simply pull the harness on top of that lip and secure it up there, then put the fender back on. This works on both sides. https://scontent-atl1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/1184872_10101150870912279_1864501515_n.jpg?oh=a73ee8f47ce8f52887e0dec4e8332b47&oe=56081C6B https://scontent-atl1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash2/v/t1.0-9/1011584_10101108020454939_1541742396_n.jpg?oh=05ff5a3b3ee324687097900c3f6b9b9c&oe=55F8EEC5  As you can see I routed the driver's side harness into the engine bay but I left the hood release there. If you're not rerouting the harness simply run it along where the hood release is. I bent a piece of brass around the seam as you can see to prevent the sharp edge from cutting through it. If you're putting the harness up there you probably want to be very careful about this."
240sx,36sm8l,mowbuss,1 point,Fri May 22 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"So, when you pull that fender off, the harness will stay in place pretty much? Then just kinda pull it into the rail?"
240sx,36sm8l,eejjkk,2,Sat May 23 01:53:44 2015 UTC,"The harness is secured inside the wheel well above the liner with zip ties from the factory. When you pull off the fender you should see it secured in there after you remove the liner. You just need to remove/cut the factory ties, then you can pull it up alongside the rail without too much trouble and secure it there. In my picture of the driver's side fender you want to bring it basically right along where I have the hood release cable routed. There is a lip sticking out on the bottom of that chassis rail. Just pull the harness up along the rail and let it sit on that lip. The lip is even easier to see if you look at my pic of the passenger side; it's the same on both sides.  One other thing I forgot before: once you remove the harness from the wheel well you will see there is a seam pointing straight down at a 90 degree angle. There is a very good chance at the ride height pictured in the OP that the tire will hit that seam when cornering hard and it will eat right into the rubber. Fortunately it's another easy fix. Just get a 5 lb sledge hammer from harbor freight (a normal hammer will not do the job) and smash it up flat so it's flush with the top of the wheel well. Problem solved."
240sx,36sm8l,mowbuss,1 point,Sat May 23 05:07:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool. I might do that this weekend as well then. I've got that liner already removed, as well as the stock airbox, it rubbed on that a little as well. I wasn't exactly sure how that fender would come off and if it the harness was secured to the actual fender or not, couldn't tell. But thank you though, that's a really big help. I came across that seam already, and bent those up on both sides. Just grabbed it with a big pair of channel locks to get it going then just started wailing on it lol. Thanks a lot buddy, I really appreciate it."

240sx,36q7nc,Dark_Egg,1 point,Thu May 21 08:08:44 2015 UTC,"Does the interior have anything? or just a metal room with a hole in the floor where the shifter sticks out. If it has seats that's a lot better because getting aftermarket seats into that S chassis is a pain in the ass. You'd have to order specal S chassis compatable seats, or find original 240 seats. I think R34 seats fit but I am not sure."
240sx,36q7nc,abductee92,1 point,Thu May 21 08:15:45 2015 UTC,It has seats but they're not attached to the chassis for some reason. Not 100% if they're original or not. Most likely not. It can drive but I think he mentioned it needs a new alternator.
240sx,36q7nc,FluroBlack,2,Thu May 21 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Well I guess it just comes down to personal preferance at this point. I love a good S chassis but for $6,000 you may not be getting the best deal and you could use that money to really beef up that BRZ and make that into a great track/drift car."

240sx,36q7nc,soggysecret,1 point,Thu May 21 09:05:17 2015 UTC,"As an s13 owner, that price is a little high. I'd be more comfortable at $4500-$5000 Sounds like he's trying to get his money back out of the swap instead of putting more in to finish it. That price would be reasonable for a perfectly running (doesn't need an alternator) if it also had wheels and coilovers or something else of value installed. Seats not bolted down is weird, there are a handful of interchangeable seats for the s13 and the 4 bolts that hold each one are very easy to get at, no excuse for that."

240sx,36mu20,SgtPepper1313,3,Wed May 20 15:29:59 2015 UTC,Op did say money wasn't a big issue.....  Might be worth it.
240sx,36mu20,Caracharias,4,Wed May 20 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"For a missile just keep it cheap. If you find one with a running KA just leave it.  Overall reliability a stock LS1 or 5.3 would be good with just headers and maybe a cam/intake mani, and make mid/high 300s. The only issue is the high cost of the T56's, and some people have bad luck with oiling..  KA-T's are pretty rad, you can build a bottom end for around 1k that will hold anything and they make a ton of torque and parts are readily available. I would probably do that for a missile car."
240sx,36mu20,prok0,2,Wed May 20 15:59:43 2015 UTC,The ka-t is what I was thinking but figured rb series UST be infinitely better since that's what everyone rants and raves about.
240sx,36mu20,prok0,1 point,Wed May 20 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"RBs are really not that great. They have some oiling issues, parts are sometimes difficult to come across, you'll run into fitment issues with the length of the motor, and a host of other things.   Dont get me wrong they can be cool, but if I were doing an inline 6 I would get a 1J, parts cross with 2JZ for the most part, if you pop a motor you can just get a .5L upgrade and put a 2J bottom on it, and it seems generally easier to make good power. Also they seem to be on par if not slightly cheaper than RB25's, at least here in FL."
240sx,36mu20,stiveno5,4,Sat May 23 02:04:38 2015 UTC,Why would you want your car to be a POS? because thats what missile means

240sx,36mu20,JS_kun,3,Thu May 21 02:46:29 2015 UTC,"Bad advice in my opinion. Why risk losing one more good 240 when there's plenty of 100% missile-able cars out there? We're running out of clean ones, and they're never going to make more.  If OP doesn't trust his driving or just wants something to throw around that he doesn't care about, he should absolutely build a missile and not a nice car. Hell... if money is really no object he could get a true missile and throw on some over's and call it a day (it'll hide most of the typical damage anyway) because he'll have a car that's a missile but looks nice from 20 feet."

It was in a front end accident and the frame rails were bent and the radiator support were destroyed as a result. The rails are now straightened and i pulled the quarter glass and hatch glass as well that day. I intend to cut the roof off another car that has less rust and put that on, and weld the radiator support from that car on as well. I posted the three s13s I have recently. If you've seen them, the black pignose has terrible rot on the frame rails and is now beyond savaging, so it's now a designated parts car for this one, which is nearly flawless aside from the roof."

That car has a Tomei 224G which is new, improved, and worth what..like 15 grand?  The SR is 20 some years old now and worth like 2 grand depending.  Mods are just fine and dandy, but that's not a modded engine, its a swapped engine.  I feel like that's pretty sound logic.  Also...damn dude don't take this so seriously.

The problem with installing smaller headlights is usually less light output.

My car would LOVE to look like yours. I do body work often, and I honestly cant tell what is out of whack that is causing the body panel spacing to be like that? All the metal ""appears"" to be straight, It looks like it should line up pro? Its just not? Maybe the intercooler is pushing up on the center of the front bumper and pressure is transferred to the headlights and in turn to the brackets that secure the front bolt brackets for the fenders up near the corner lights?

240sx,363y6n,lordlurid,1 point,Fri May 15 22:28:01 2015 UTC,Im not an expert but I dont think your gonna find a rebuild kit out there for most coils. The biggest issue is with blown dampers and there is not a cheap/at home way to refill the gas if the coils are blown or leaking. Ive also heard about people going to offroad jeep or motorcross places can do it. I think the cost ends up being like 50-150 bucks per coil. Unless you got them for cheap cheap or free then Id pass. There are a few places that you can get used name brand coils for 500-600 bucks. JDM Hookup used to have a bunch but they seem to be sold out atm.
240sx,363y6n,CommodoreDan,1 point,Sat May 16 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, the only reason I'm interested is cause I'm looking at getting them for cheap cheap, like $400 cheap."

240sx,363y6n,CommodoreDan,0,Sat May 16 00:56:21 2015 UTC,"$400 is still not cheap cheap for me. If they were not needing a rebuild then thats a steal. If your spending any where from $200- $600 bucks to get them running then you might as well start looking at new entry level coils. Now if they were 200-300 range, then id start considering it. Even then the hassle of getting them rebuilt is too much for me. But you can judge what is gonna work for you, maybe go to some local shops and get a quote."
240sx,363y6n,wowoall,1 point,Sat May 16 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"And them being 400 isn't a bad deal, it's the rebuild that gets expensive. I got a set of tein super streets for 380.

I dont I'd that helps or not. I'd put the head on first and set timing and then put the covers on. Just my 2 cents"
240sx,35zdwx,kyle_henshaw,1 point,Thu May 14 21:43:36 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. The problem with the SR is the front cover gets sandwiched between the head and upper oil pan so youre either hitting the head gasket or the oil pickup tube trying to put it straight in. I'm gonna do more research in the meantime, I just really want to get the timing sorted on the first try for once."
240sx,35zdwx,prok0,1 point,Thu May 14 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"You need to put the front cover on first. On an SR the cover does have some small pieces of casting that 'catch' the chain so it cant really fall completely off but it is possible to have the chain move droop and then when you pull it up it could shift.  The thing to remember is that it doesnt matter. If your number 1 cylinder is on TDC when you set the head on, your chain marks can be anywhere and it doesnt matter. You would need to just make sure that the physical cam timing is correct and you can count the links between the top surface of the head and the timing mark on the cam gear, and inbetween the timing marks on the cam gears.  A chain is a chain, its always going to have the same number of links, so the painted marks on the chain dont matter as long as the piston is at TDC and the cams are physically in time.  If you try to put the cover on after a lot of times the headgasket gets pinched or does not set properly."
240sx,35zdwx,prok0,1 point,Fri May 15 15:16:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks i appreciate the advice, I've had trouble with the cam timing in the past so I had my fingers crossed that I could get it all lined up this time around.

240sx,35opu1,AbandonedTeddy,3,Tue May 12 07:11:08 2015 UTC,"Almost any shop you send it to is more than likely going to get the mounts from O'Reilly, Autozone, Napa, or something. I work at O'Reilly and practically every shop in the area I deliver to em. If you want good mounts, get Nismos and find a shop that'll work for you. If you don't care so much and are fine with chinese made stuff (currently what i have holding my SR), then just send it to a shop. They're not terrible parts, just not great.   It'll cost the list price for the part and however much the hourly rate is for the shop for like 2 or 3 hours. I'm going to guess somewhere between 200-500, but remember, I don't actually work in a shop so I have no idea. It may take them longer than the 2 or 3 hours since they have to get em either delivered or picked up.   I say just wait. Drive easy and keep in mind they're not perfect. Either deal with it when you get back or inform whoever you sell it to that it needs to happen. My mentality is that you don't want to have perfectly good rubber pieces just sitting around and festering in a garage or outside environment while you're gone. But it is good to just get shit done the right way to just be done with it and not have to worry about it again. All up to you."
240sx,35opu1,purovida94,2,Tue May 12 07:36:42 2015 UTC,"What a beautiful comment, thank you for taking your time to inform me of all this. I am putting the car into storage in 30 days but like you said why not just get shit done to not worry about it later. I do think the price range is around their but tomorrow I will be calling my uncle to make sure what's a good price for that since he owns a shop. One more thing if I drive it for these last 30 days what are the chances of something messing up on the car with the motor mounts that need to be replaced in. I might wait to put them in after I get back if you said the car will prob be ok if I'm just driving to and from back work."
240sx,35opu1,frsh2fourty,2,Tue May 12 08:04:18 2015 UTC,How bad is the vibration? If its just 30 days going to/from work I don't think you will have a problem unless you're hooning the shit out of the car. I've seen mounts almost completely deteriorated that people drive daily and you can see the motor physically moving several inches
240sx,35opu1,purovida94,1 point,Tue May 12 19:23:04 2015 UTC,Its pretty bad at like 60 mph but if I accelerate a little more it get less or if I slow down

And that comes from a self proclaimed coil elitist. Things I've heard from friends and the Internet is that they're pretty soft and don't go very low.  For a daily that's probably a plus. Also keep in mind these are not damper adjustable and use your stock top hats. No camber plates up front. If none of those things bother you then I think they're pretty sweet for the price.

Locate the wiper motor bolt assembly near the bottom of the windshield.  (Now this part is key, and also requires the help of a friend or neighbor.)  Look straight downward and get line of sight position REALLY close to the strut tower where the upper strut mount is bolted to the chassis.  Once you have a really close up view of the top nut that bolts the strut to the strut mount... have a friend or neighbor QUICKLY (while applying alot of force) close the hood in a sort of SLAMMING motion.

There are some problems with it, not too bad though. The transmission is shot but that's okay because I have a 5-speed in storage. The head gasket needs to be replaced, the brake lights stay on, a minor dent and I think there is water leaking in the trunk.   It's had two owners, the second one moved out of the country so his sister has had it for a few years. It's been sitting under a car cover which probably explains the lack of cracks in the dash. Picked it up for 1800 bucks. Fucking score."

It should work well for OP because he switched to a MAP set up, but an atmospheric BOV on a mass airflow sensor setup causes a hyper rich condition when it releases pressure, because the ECU has accounted for air that isn't there anymore. A recirc valve works much better.   Also, SSQVs are notorious for leaking vacuum at idle, which is what's happening with mine."
240sx,3551fx,ImmoralKiwi,1 point,Fri May 8 19:01:57 2015 UTC,Hmmm interesting. Maybe I'll put my stock one back on or custom make some hose to use the SSQV in re circulation mode.

240sx,34pzbd,Devoidus,2,Sun May 3 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"What other suspension components do you have? If you have solid bushings or poly urethane all around, you're likely to have a less than pleasant daily driver on top of a coilover system that is design for ""off-road use only"".   In terms of your coilovers, you should be able to bounce the car slightly with 8/6 kg spring rates. I can't personally speak for Stance but for every brand that I've owned, the instructions had a sort of ""break in"" for the dampers. For example, Fortune Auto suggested that you turn the knob from whatever it was in when it was in the box to full hard and back to full soft before setting it to your desired damping and before driving. When I bought PBM comps (which are 10/8 kg), I did the same and found the ride to be compliant and not ""rough"" or jarring.   Other possibilities could be any additional preload of the spring. Generally everybody says they don't touch it but it doesn't hurt to check.  Also, I'm under the assumption that you recently purchased these or had them sitting and then you recently were able to get the car running and are now trying them out, if that's the case, allow for a break in period for the springs and dampers.   I'm unaware of how many ""levels of damping adjustment"" there are but generally speaking the lower the total number, the more different each click will be from each other. So for example, if there's like 16 clicks, keep it within full soft or 2 clicks after full soft.   It's hard to diagnose things with the way you've described things. Even if you list your parts out, I would need to drive the car to tell you what to look at.  But try the things that don't cost any money to fix first. So if everything above checks out, then you should give Stance a call or disassemble, take the dampers to a shock dyno, maybe have them revalved. Stance SS's are a replacement of the GR+ Pros and those were stiff and jarring on public roads when I used a pair but since the release they said they've revised their valving so who knows?"
240sx,34pzbd,JS_kun,1 point,Sun May 3 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"That's the only suspension changes I've made.  It's pathetic I know, but I have not done an alignment on them yet.  I simply ran out of money for it.  About 600mi on them so far, so I think the break in is done at this point.  I haven't changed the preload at all, it's equal on both sides for front and rear.  Maybe the alignment could be causing the issue.. I know it's off a bit but doesn't seem drastic.  I'll get that done anyway. Thanks for the input"
240sx,34pzbd,JS_kun,1 point,Sun May 3 23:04:59 2015 UTC,"Because you've still got stock worn rubber bushings and old ball joints etc., your ride should be more on the ""comfortable"" end. So hey, I guess we can point at one less thing and focus more on alignment as well as your coilovers. Forgot to ask, what kind of wheels are you using? Low profile tires tend to accentuate road blemishes and have a ""rougher"" ride.   Like others have said you may want to check the preload. One way you could go about this is by completely drooping the spring perch (which releases the preload on the springs) all around then raising the perch again to meet the bottom of the springs and then giving it maybe 1/8"" of preload. If there aren't any changes to the ride quality, then you may have bad dampers."
240sx,34pzbd,soggysecret,2,Mon May 4 02:40:28 2015 UTC,Are they new or used? Did you preload the springs? Did you get an alignment?
240sx,34pzbd,doscomputer,1 point,Sun May 3 16:08:54 2015 UTC,"New, didn't adjust preload because everything I've read (incl the instructions) said don't.  No... no alignment yet.  It definitely needs to be done but I'm just plain out of cash at this point.  That'll be my next non-free step."
240sx,34pzbd,eejjkk,2,Sun May 3 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"When I bought my stance SS+D coilovers the preloads were different on every single coilover. And me being naive and trusting the people on the forums who say never fuck with the preload I went and slapped them on anyway and the car felt like donkey. So I decided it couldn't really make it any worse if I made the preload the same on each pair and then the car felt great.   And if the preload is the same on both of your fronts then I would reccomend just lowering(or raising) the preload, and just take note of where the preload was before in case it gets worse or if you make it too soft/too hard or w/e."

240sx,34ngu6,awwyisss,2,Sat May 2 20:00:55 2015 UTC,All convertibles will be more floppy and sloppy than their top-having counterparts. You probably don't want a roll cage if it's gonna be daily driven but you could reinforce your subframe connectors (frame rail like things). You could search for some or get it custom made but I wouldn't be too worried about it. A good idea would be to look up some S13 vert build threads and see how/if they addressed rigidity.
240sx,34ngu6,YouCantBeThatDumb,2,Sat May 2 21:28:11 2015 UTC,Thanks dude!
240sx,34ngu6,doscomputer,1 point,Mon May 4 20:24:59 2015 UTC,Rigidity is actual taken care of from ASC when they were made. Fender bracing and rear strut work to name a few.
240sx,34ngu6,awwyisss,2,Fri May 8 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"People talk about the verts being more floppy but neither me or my friend can feel too much of a difference between my vert and his coupe so I wouldn't worry about the supposedly more flexible chassis. But if you want to to mods to ""help"" then a front strut tower brace and a nismo power brace are probably your only non-roll cage/welding in plate options of chassis stiffening.   The only real problem with the vert is that ASC did a terrible job of welding all of their stuff in and you're almost guaranteed to get rust  on the chassis under the front fenders, behind the back seat, on top of the windshield trim/weather seal, and under the interior windshield trim. Also the quarter windows have a near 100% failure rate so if they're the original guides and motors they will fail eventually and have to be fixed if you don't want crooked immobile quarter windows"
240sx,34ngu6,doscomputer,2,Mon May 4 09:01:41 2015 UTC,"For the most part you won't feel it, but the roof of a car really helps with rigidity and they have to reinforce the floor to compensate. Some verts are more floppy than others. I never really heard anything bad about the 240 vert but it's just a general thing with convertibles."
