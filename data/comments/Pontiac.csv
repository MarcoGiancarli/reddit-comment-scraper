Pontiac,3e6k9f,elochai98,2,Wed Jul 22 10:05:57 2015 UTC,"Physically, yes, they fit. It's not a straight swap of just motors. You need the engine wiring harness, PCM, custom engine mounts... depending on what trans is in your car now (if auto, probably the 4T40E) you would want to swap in the trans from the car the engine came from, or one similar (the 4T65E-HD), and you'd need custom trans mounts as well.  It's not a simple swap, but it can be done. Shit, people have stuffed L67's in Cavaliers!"
Pontiac,3e6k9f,cinosa,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:28:51 2015 UTC,"How easy would it be to get custom engine mounts?    Also, I don't believe it comes with the tranny.  If I we're buying a tranny with it, I would opt for manual.  Which tranny would be best?"
Pontiac,3e6k9f,cinosa,2,Wed Jul 22 11:53:58 2015 UTC,"If you want to go manual, I believe the G6 GTP trans (F40?) bolts up to the L67. There have been several Grand Prix GTP's that have done manual swaps, but you'd need to google that. I can tell you this: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  As for engine/trans mounts, you could take a pair each for your car and a pair from the junkyard of the model the engine is being donated out of, and speak with a fab shop local to you, they can probably come up with something. These might also already exist that you can buy, but you have to search, and reddit is not the place to do that. I'm going to suggest you spend some significate time over at:  http://www.motorswap.org/  They specialize in swapping L67's into just about anything. They'll probably know where you can get all the parts you need for what you're looking to do."

Pontiac,3dzhzr,no_tolerance,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:30 2015 UTC,Register it as an Antique and deal with the paperwork that comes along with that.   Any car after 73 also needs an EVAP system among other things that were required by federal law. By the 80s you need an ECU. Your motor doesn't support one so it can't go through emissions without dropping in a modern engine.
Pontiac,3dzhzr,MechMeister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can't register it as an antique yet in my state (35 years).

The rebuilt title scares a lot of buyers, and I completely understand the skepticism (I too was very hesitant about it when I was checking out the car) - but the car was involved in a light hit (the mechanics showed all the photos of the accident) and ultimately, it might even be in better shape than it would have because of the work done to it. It's a great car!"
Pontiac,3dc9a1,the_ganj_father,5,Wed Jul 15 03:36:28 2015 UTC,"It's worth it because this era of car has been on a downward spiral of valuation since, well, 85... But now they are starting to climb back up as nostalgia and 30 years sets in.  They are getting harder and harder to find and when people do see them they usually say something.  Keep it clean, keep it original, and only replace with OEM parts and you will have something worth closer to 5-6k in a few years. Just look for rust and leaks, everything else is easy to fix/repair your self"
Pontiac,3dc9a1,BTV-Texas,3,Wed Jul 15 12:04:20 2015 UTC,"Pennock's Fiero Forum is going to be your friend.  There are a few spots that you'll want to check for rust (other than the typical ""underneath""). The most noticeable (and easiest to check) fiero-specific spot is in the trunk, in the top two corners. There is a bit of a shelf at the top left/right of the trunk. Pull the carpet back and have a look. Your view on the right may be obstructed by a blower fan, but you should still get a decent view.  Another other spot is the rear upper frame rails. Unfortunately, I think you'd pretty much have to remove the wheel liner to get a look at them. There are other things worth checking as well, but none come to mind right away.  The rust check is somewhat important. Because the body is entirely plastic, there could be a fair amount of rust on an otherwise decent looking car. Not to say that any rust should totally turn you off: The car is 30 years old, there's probably going to be some, somewhere, at least a little.  I own an 87 GT, and love it."
Pontiac,3dc9a1,sequentious,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think you'd pretty much have to remove the wheel liner to get a look at them.   Pop the trunk and carefully (use a flashlight, and a mechanics inspection mirror if you have one) look for rust damage under the battery and the air filter canister.  If the spots you mentioned look good, the likelihood of rust damage hidden elsewhere is pretty low, since these are proven highly susceptible.  Very unlikely that any major rust will be absent there and present elsewhere.  Except maybe in a sunroof/t-top.  In that case I'd also go nuts inspecting the passenger compartment and try to get a peek under carpets and such.  Most sellers probably aren't going to let someone pull up carpet, but it would be one of my conditions for a fiero without a full hardtop.  Edit: Obviously, none of that says don't inspect the undercarriage.  Always inspect the bottom, no matter the car.  Edit2: Oh and make sure you don't mistake the battery tray (which is virtually guaranteed to be rusted out on an original car) and the frame under it."

Please take this with a grain of salt, I have removed many gm radios but never tried to install them into another car.  Personally you are probably better off going for an aftermarket radio. You will have better sound quality, added features, and the knowledge that it will work (with the proper wire harness and adapters)."

Pontiac,3dbq16,Shatophiliac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:55:26 2015 UTC,How is that possible and why would they do that? Is there a code or something the car sends it to turn on that's unique? And is it to deter theft?
Pontiac,3dbq16,CrookedStubby15,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you have ever installed a car radio so let me give you a quick run down.  The most basic radio only needs power in and an antenna in.  Radios have two power inputs. The main 12v power that runs the radio and an accessory 12v that turns the radio on.  Now most gm radios from 2002 and up do don't use two power inputs.  They only have  only a main 12v power.  The radio powers on from a data link between the ecu. This is why you have to buy an interface box when installing an aftermarket into a modern gm car.  This data link is what the radio checks to see if it is installed in the original car.  I believe it works this way to prevent theft. Like I said before, I do not know if this is true, this is what I understand from replacing many gm radios."

Pontiac,3d5024,XsMagical,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure GM went to using a single key in 1997 on most of their cars. I know Chevy cars like the W-Body ones were split on that, some had 2 keys, some had 1 on 96-99 and 00-06. But Pontiac changed almost all keys to single in 1997+ I had a 98 Grand Am and it had one key for all...   Edit. see the tumbler for the 01 grand AM, the 97+ Grand AM and Grand Prix both used a single key for doors, trunk and ignition. The F-Bodys still used the older style chip in the key.   http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/915RhsNhq9L._SL1500_.jpg"
Pontiac,3d5024,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,3,Tue Jul 14 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"2001 Grand Ams use the old VATS theft deterrent system. My 98 Firebird has it too. There are two keys that came with the vehicle: one that has a black head and a black resistor chip in it for starting the vehicle only. This key will not unlock doors/trunk/glove box. The other key is a plain silver key that only unlocks the doors/trunk/glove compartment. I took a pic for you. The top key is the one you need. If you go to the dealer and ask to have that made from your VIN, they can do that for you. It's probably pretty cheap because it's just a key; there's no tech/chips in that key at all, it's strictly access-only.  PK3 keys look like the one on the bottom left (from my 05 GP) in that pic. They are a one-key-for-everything system.   Honestly, I never use that access key for my 'bird. It's just so much easier to press the buttons on the fob. It would be good to go get one of those access keys made though, in case you end up with a dead battery. You wouldn't be able to enter the vehicle using only the fob after the battery has been dead for a bit."

Pontiac,3bs662,XsMagical,5,Wed Jul 1 18:40:12 2015 UTC,I almost bought one of these. I really regret not doing it.
Pontiac,3bs662,terminateMEATBAGS,2,Thu Jul 2 14:21:32 2015 UTC,There are still a lot of them out there for sale.
Pontiac,3bs662,terminateMEATBAGS,2,Thu Jul 2 18:13:28 2015 UTC,My first car was a 96 Grand Prix SE. Loved the car but the car being from northeastern PA made it not worth keeping. Lots of rot. Maybe I'll buy another from somewhere more south.
Pontiac,3bs662,terminateMEATBAGS,2,Thu Jul 2 18:17:19 2015 UTC,I want a 96 GTP in burnt orange.
Pontiac,3bs662,AntiochusLaetus,2,Thu Jul 2 18:25:30 2015 UTC,Beautiful car. If I'm correct a couple of those came stick?

Pontiac,3bs662,ledzepp3,2,Thu Jul 2 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"None came stick, the se model did from 89 to 93 but not the tgp. I'm using a new venture transmission from a 94 cavalier because it has a hydraulic throw out bearing. I have the stock automatic in the garage with 60k on it."
Pontiac,3bs662,Floe44,2,Thu Jul 2 23:13:17 2015 UTC,Don't mind the tag being exposed. its got FL tags now... Pictures are a bit old as I'm currently restoring the car but I will have updated ones sometime late this year.

Pontiac,3bk65v,Misplaced_Sock,4,Mon Jun 29 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"I love those wheels, something about decent thickness 5-spokes just look good on most Pontiacs. Also digging the trans choice, I've hardly ever seen any manual G6's."
Pontiac,3bk65v,ledzepp3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:32:14 2015 UTC,Thanks! I also like those wheels as well and Im considering plasti-dipping them black (and the brake calibers blue) but I haven't made my mind up on that yet. And I was shocked to find a manual in my area as well!  Only bummer about the car is the CD player can't eject CDs anymore but I plan on replacing it with an aftermarket one anyway!
Pontiac,3bk65v,PoseidonKangaroo,2,Mon Jun 29 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Uhh..... to each their own, but I have the same rims and they don't need plasti-dip, that would make them look extremely cheap (in my opinion) and as for the calipers, I have never seen blue, but I would always go with red (I am looking to get my Black G6 GT Convertible fitted with red calipers) But hey, I love your car it is absolutely beautiful and blue is an amazing color!"
Pontiac,3bk65v,PoseidonKangaroo,2,Tue Jun 30 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"After some thought I agree, it would look cheap. But red calibers and black rims may look good. I didn't plan on adding cosmetic touches soon but I find out Friday if I get a promotion or not! If I do I'm gonna treat myself, if not I can wait. She looks gorgeous as is anyway"

Pontiac,3bgs3s,Mell0fell0,0,Mon Jun 29 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"We'll like I'll see a base with just a straight 3800, then see a newer year, still base, but has a blower..."
Pontiac,3bgs3s,Mell0fell0,2,Mon Jun 29 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"In 2006 they started putting the SC 3800's in the GT models, before that you had to get a GTP if you wanted a supercharger. The Comp G cars came with tapshift and HUD's and everything else including supercharger. I have an '06 GT (maroon, supercharged, 5 button DIC, no HUD, cloth tan interior) that I love. If the supercharger is a requirement then I would look for an '06-'07 GT. they should have most of what you want and should be cheaper than a comparable GTP. Most of the '04-'05 cars have the NA 3800 because that's what came with the base/gt1/gt2 packages those years."

Pontiac,3bav95,CrazyLittleSakura,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:33:18 2015 UTC,that's why I hope the Saturn dealer succeeds in suing the the advisory firm. It won't bring back the Pontiac brand but at least we'll get affirmation that Pontiac was shuttered when it was making the best products in its history.
Pontiac,3bav95,MechMeister,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:22:15 2015 UTC,that description is a bit misleading. The ute is called the Holden Maloo and the guy in USA is importing the chassis then puting G8 dashboards and front fascia so that he can stamp it with a G8 VIN.  it's a pricey build but that's all we can do since our 25 year import law is garbage.
Pontiac,3bav95,MechMeister,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:24:47 2015 UTC,Fuck that law. Why can't we lobby to change it?

Pontiac,3b8df1,TheyCallMeShitHead,2,Fri Jun 26 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"To be honest it's technically illegal( at least in my state) ,  but it looks so much better than the stock orange bulbs.  These are pure white LED's I grabbed from Autozone for $12. They have amber LED's available also. Your dad might like those better.  And install is a breeze,  I swapped them in the parking lot in 5mins ."
Pontiac,3b8df1,TheyCallMeShitHead,2,Sat Jun 27 00:11:53 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I'll have to look and see if they are legal here. He doesn't really care though about if it's legal or not though.

Pontiac,3azgje,mbow1982,2,Wed Jun 24 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"My 07 Convertible does this too, and a ""service airbag"" message pops up on the radio display as well. As far as I know there is no recall on it, and I've checked my VIN numerous times to make absolute sure. I think it is just one of those annoying problems that you have to ""catch"" in order for the mechanic to see exactly what is wrong. It comes and goes for me, but I have no doubt in my mind that the airbag will fail if needed. I'm hoping when I go for my next oil change I get an answer as to what is causing it, and if he can do anything about it! I'll keep you posted!"

Pontiac,3ayg0e,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"Hi thanks for your reply. Yes sorry I should have mentioned the TSB. Our mechanic gave us a second opinion and thinks it's the actuator. Said there was  no metal in the oil so it's doubtful it's a grinding engine bearing.   However, I have unplugged the actuator and started the car and it still makes the grinding noise. Actuator replacement is about 1k. I will have to trust the TSB and hope that's the issue and have it replaced.  Thanks again for your help."
Pontiac,3ayg0e,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,2,Wed Jun 24 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think a main bearing issue would cause other problems that you would definitely notice (shaking, knocking).

Pontiac,39xox3,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,3,Wed Jun 17 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"Well, as a matter of fact, I have! I have '98 Firebird droptop as well.   First off, sorry that someone slashed your top. That really, really sucks. :(  Second, I'll start off by saying if you're not mechanically inclined, then hire someone to do it for you. Even for someone like me, who has been working on cars for decades, it was quite challenging.   As far as equipment goes, there are 3 pieces to this top. If they did not slash the back section (with the window in it) then you can just replace the top cover and the headliner and be done with it. It is cheaper that way. I highly, highly suggest getting new hold-down cables, because while you're in there, you may as well replace them and they're only like $35. They will keep the top looking great (no sag, no bubbling). Also, you're going to need tack strips, a heavy duty staple gun and heavy duty staples, contact cement and a brush for it. You're going to need tools like either body panel tools or a couple different sized hammers, screwdrivers, etc. The OEM top is made by Haartz. It is called Stayfast canvas. ALL of our 'birds came with canvas tops OEM, not vinyl. You can do it cheaper by putting a Stayfast vinyl top on it, but if you're only doing the top section you're going to want to stay with the same material as the back section. A breakdown of costs:   Haartz Stayfast Canvas top section only - $359. Haartz Headliner - $159 Hold down cables - $35 Heavy duty staple gun and staples - $60 Tack strips and glue - $30   So you're looking at about $675-$700 doing it yourself. A (good) shop that specializes in doing this work will charge about $1200-$1400 before tax. You're also going to take a while to do it. I replaced all sections of mine, and it took me roughly 14 hours, broken up over 3 days. I also put a new window in, and that took a lot of time. I am fastidious in how I do my work though, so it will probably take you substantially less time, especially if you're only doing the top section. Plan on 5-7 hours if you're prepped and have all your tools. I suggest buying a book that shows how to do the replacement. They are about $30.  It can be done, and you can do a good job with it, but you're going to be challenged. Getting the top off is not so bad. Getting the new top on and getting it aligned and tacked down properly is a bitch.  So, if you're interested in saving about 600-700 to do it yourself, go for it. For me, I've owned my car since it was brand new and have done all the work on it, so I wanted to do it myself as it is also not my daily driver. If your car is a DD and/or you don't have that type of ownership experience like I have with mine, or if you're not into being challenged, then just pay a good shop to do it for you and save yourself the frustration. Because it is frustrating work to do, not gonna lie."
Pontiac,39xox3,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"Holy cow! Very awesome post, I really appreciate you breaking it down. I actually looked more closely at it and even saw videos online. It is something I would've liked to tackle on. I'm sort of handy with things like this. But since it is my primary car, I unfortunately have no time to work on it. I only get off two days a week from work and having a hole on the roof of my car is not asthetically pleasing. Not to mention if it rains.   I took it to a local shop owner instead. Had a solid website and fantastic attitude. Roughly will end up costing me around 1,000+. Which was the cheapest I could find. Others would say 1,000 plus labor of around 500. I visited his shop and he even ordered the roof same day. He showed me his work and had a car that he just fixed so I could see the end result. Plastic window instead of glass because its cheaper and what not.   Overall, I'm paying what I roughly expected to pay and should have the car back again within 2 days.   Lessons to be learned from my experience is to never take this car to a bar at night again. I'm also thinking about selling it. I've had it for a good 8 years and, although I want nothing more than to keep it, things are starting to go bad with it. I don't want to say goodbye, but I don't have the money to fix the radiator/engine/lights etc.  It's awesome you've kept yours running so long though. Cheers for that! Thanks again!"
Pontiac,39xox3,kscannon,2,Wed Jun 17 04:54:43 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help you out a bit! Sounds like you made a great decision taking it to a reputable shop. If it's your daily driver, this would be one of the few occasions where I would suggest bringing it to a shop instead of doing it yourself.  I've had my convertible 17 years, bought it new in 1998 with 5 miles on it. I have about 180k on it now. Since I stopped using it as a daily driver I've done a lot to get it back to ""new"" condition, the top replacement being one of the things I've done. My back window actually fell right out into the back seat one day. I think it's due to the Florida/Texas heat it has been under since the day I owned it, and the adhesive just finally gave out.   As far as security-wise, back when I used to take it out to bars/whatever, I would just put the top down and leave it that way. Yeah, it got rained on a few times (always keep towels in the trunk!), but that's easier/cheaper to deal with than replacing a top because some idiot thinks there's something in there that he wants. Plus it made me keep the interior clean and free of clutter. :)  After you get the car back from the shop you should post a couple pics of the work. I'd like to see it!"

Pontiac,388b57,mylastnameschampion,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:38:30 2015 UTC,I have an 06 I bought in 2007 i don't regret buying it. I usually get bored with cars pretty fast like within 2 years or so and I still have her she's my baby lol. I recommend it 👍
Pontiac,388b57,Ferris419,0,Thu Jun 25 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Drive one before you buy one for sure. But, if you have ever driven a 2000 or so camaro ss or z28, it's pretty similar. The GTO weighs more but has a little more horsepower. The GTO also had an IRS instead of the live axle like the Camaro. So it's a smoother ride. I prefer the 04 with the LS1 with manual trans, since they can get like 29 highway miles to the gallon if you baby it."

Pontiac,382x5b,JustCallMeNasty,3,Tue Jun 2 06:35:46 2015 UTC,Thank you! Scan says one misfiring cylinder. Probably a plug :)
Pontiac,382x5b,pibroch,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:13:38 2015 UTC,"If your SES light is flashing when it's making these sounds, the engine is misfiring. Likely it's not a huge deal - maybe a bad spark plug or wire, or a bad Ignition Control Module. All of which are fairly cheap and easy to fix on the 3400 motor in your Aztek.  Not to say that it couldn't be more serious, but I wouldn't bet on it."
Pontiac,382x5b,bumpty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"My dad says it's some sort of control module that regulates gas flow to the engine, causing it to misfire and leak air or something.   Thank you. I feel better."
Pontiac,382x5b,bumpty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:21:35 2015 UTC,Take it to it autozone and get them to check what code its spitting out.  Likely an ignition module.  Pretty easy to swap out.
Pontiac,382x5b,bumpty,2,Tue Jun 2 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"I have a tester on hand. I'm getting cylinder 5 misfire, meaning bad ignition coil / spark plug probably. Right? Unless the piston itself has dislodged from the engine, which I think I'd notice.   Or bad fuel pump. That's all I can find."
Pontiac,382x5b,DUIguy87,2,Tue Jun 2 04:11:01 2015 UTC,Bad coil or plug.   I would start with those.  Might as well replace all the plugs while you are at it.  Wouldn't hurt.
Pontiac,382x5b,michaelm8,2,Tue Jun 2 04:14:39 2015 UTC,I know nothing of cars. Can I just go pick up six plugs and pop them in and out as needed without jostling too much?
Pontiac,382x5b,Wincest333,2,Tue Jun 2 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"Well, you'll need a plug socket, an extender, and a ratchet.  Probably a plug gapper too so you set the gap to spec.   Sometimes plugs are hard to get out, so a magnet on a stick helps.  Not really needed though.   Get a repair manual for the ole Aztec!  Changing plugs is a great way to start learning how to work on cars!!"

Pontiac,3807du,DedHed8285,3,Sun May 31 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"I have an 05 GP GT, which I bought in December last year. I also have a '98 Firebird (with a 3800 SeriesII), and prior to that I had a '97 GP GT.   The '05 had 89k when I bought it, now 95k. I took it from TX to FL within a couple weeks of buying it, and it drove great with no issues and was very comfortable. The vehicle was a 1-owner car, and the prior owner maintained it very well. I had a pre-purchase inspection done on it, and beyond a few minor interior cosmetic items (broken door lock knob, cig burns in one floor mat), the main issue was a torn sway bar link boot. $33 item which I replaced myself a couple days after buying. The vehicle drives perfectly, is straight as a rail on the road, and there is very little road noise. There were no other driveability issues. I do most of my maintainence myself, so I've done a few things like PCV valve, put a new belt it, new plugs/wires, changed fluids, etc. This is basically because I wanted it to be as ""fresh"" as possible from the get-go (not because they necessarily needed to be done), and without relying on the prior owner/dealership doing that work.   The 3800 setup in the vehicle makes things easy to work on, in ways that aren't readily apparent. For instance, changing the headlights is very simple (as it should be), things like PCV valve and air filter are easily accessible. A lot of vehicles now are difficult to work on due to the restricted space under the hood, but not with the GP. I'll make an exception for the back plugs and wires... they're a bitch.  A few things I've come across while researching stuff are: 05 and later do not have the access panel in the trunk to get to the fuel pump, so you have to drop the tank to get to it. That sucks. If you're looking at a high mileage GP, you're gonna end up replacing that sooner than later, so be prepared to shell out $600 or so. Also, remember that 07 and newer vehicles are mandated to have TPMS. Pre-07 GPs have it, but it is not the same and it is way better. The computer calculates when one tire is rotating at a different speed than the other 3, and sets a warning on the DIC, which you can reset yourself. You don't need valve stems, sensors, all that bullshit when you change a tire. In all 07 and later vehicles the TPMS is different and it will be considerably more expensive to do something simple like change a tire, and the TPMS in those vehicles always has problems. In 6 months I've had not one bullshit warning about tire pressure, but in my friends' 14 Hyundai, the stupid light is on all the time and he can't reset it without a trip to the dealer.  If you notice a hesitation when you press the accelerator (very common on these 3800s), or if your engine stumbles and stalls when starting, you're going to want to pull the air intake, clean the MAF sensor, and clean the throttle body. The throttle bodies tend to get gummed up on these vehicles. If you go to test one of these cars, pull the air filter and if it's dirty then rest assured you'll need to clean that throttle body up.  Don't know if you have a code reader or not, but if you get a P1811 code (transmission hard shift), just walk away. A lot of people have had issues with this code coming up on this trans and there isn't a reliable fix for it. Mine is fine, but that said, when I pulled the trans pan to check the fluid and change the filter, I also pulled the accumulator and installed one of these shift kits. Honestly, it shifts like a brand new trans now, and it was relatively easy to install. I highly recommend doing this.  Well, anyhow, this is probably more info than you really need. When you find one that you like, make sure you pay the $100 or so to have a professional company come out and do a pre-purchase inspection. They will evaluate the vehicle and you'll have an opportunity to see what's wrong on it and have the dealer address it or adjust the price accordingly. Plus, the company that did mine gave me a really nice report on the issues they found. A few issues I didn't have the dealer address pre-purchase, and I used that report as a repair checklist. It's well worth the $100 they charge, as they also do a title search and will find out all the things/issues reported. Don't waste your money on bullshit Carfax."

Im about 95% sure that im going to go with probably a 05 or 06 Grand Prix, them are around my price range that I set. And I think getting anything else, I'd be disappointed with myself now.
