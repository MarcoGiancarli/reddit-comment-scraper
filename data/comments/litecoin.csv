litecoin,3e3p7r,NattyLiteCoin,2,Wed Jul 22 02:21:25 2015 UTC,"I think we're underestimating how gargantuan this could be for Litecoin. Sure, there are other coins that boast resolution to Bitcoin challenges, but it's only theoretical as there's not enough transactions to empirically upport the theory. And those coins aren't being massively accumulated by ""someone(s)"" as we've seen recently with the LTC.  I'm probably wrong, but it certainly seems as though there's a storm on the horizon.  /Removes pants, grabs umbrella."

It seems more like a cumbersome limitation which deter spam in one situation, but makes tiny transactions infeasible expensive in other possible innocent situations. It seems a judgement call with pros and cons not an obvious mistake as portrayed."
litecoin,3dxyy4,SoCo_cpp,8,Mon Jul 20 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"You make a great point, however it's hard to build a product that serves two different use cases. I think this is one of the bigger challenges BTC faces. Is it a currency/commodity/store of value or is it a settlement network? Based on which side you're on, you will make different decisions when setting up the incentive structure which secures the network.  One of the reasons why I find LTC interesting is that it's pretty clear what it's purpose is. With a 'fee market' solution to scaling it's pretty clear LTC's blockchain won't be used for settlement of other assets. That's ok and it should result in a much more manageable blockchain (smaller size).   Great products come from having clear focus with regard to what problems they are solving. To me, LTC does a much better job with this than BTC but that's also because it's much smaller and has clear dev leadership."

litecoin,3duurk,rand000m,3,Sun Jul 19 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"It's going to be interesting to see what happens after this halving. Part of me wants to think there's a chance that the media picks up on a large appreciation in value of litecoin and talks about how it's like bitcoin but not bitcoin.   Bitcoin has suffered from a huge branding issue in the eyes of the mainstream consumer. Now what happens if a new cryptocurrency appears to appreciate in value suddenly but this time the media better understands how blockchains work?  People don't remember tablets before the iPad (remember Microsoft tablets?), the Hard Drive MP3 players before the iPod (remember the nomad), social networks before Facebook (myspace, friendster etc.). All those products had the right idea, devote users/followers but didn't time the market right (or had poor marketing)."
litecoin,3duurk,meshekk,0,Sun Jul 19 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"nothing will happen about the halving.  30% inflation rate -> 15% inflation rate.  inflation is still high, price will not go to moon.  the reduction in supply has already been priced in that's why LTC is now at $3.70 instead of $1.80"
litecoin,3duurk,DogeBets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:26:24 2015 UTC,"I love the confidence. We'll see.  The other dynamic here is how coblee and the other litecoin developers show how you can improve a coin through leadership. Contrast that with how BTC is being developed and I think that's potentially a big competitive advantage. It won't be like this for long, but if you can get the important changes in early (i.e. scaling) it may make a big difference in the long term."

litecoin,3duurk,bossmanishere,2,Sun Jul 19 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"So the most obvious advantage is Bitcoin gets to do the heavy lifting of forging a new path that Bitcoin-like alts follow. It's one of the reasons I discourage the idea that altcoins (generally) should compete vs Bitcoin, unless any alt is going to get enough funding for a dozen developers (plus costs), Bitcoin is simply going to move faster. It's actually more efficient (IMHO) for altcoin devs to push new features into Bitcoin and then merge them when they catch up with the relevant Bitcoin release.  There's a subtler aspect, too. Bitcoin has momentum, but also inertia. This is visible in the block size debate, where it's been deadlocked for months (at the cost of more developer time than I want to think about), and unless there's a methodology shift (such as introducing an annual/6 month maintenance window in which hard forks are expected), it seems likely this will get worse in time. The BIP 66 (non-controversial security improvement) soft fork caused disruption for days to Bitcoin, and as the network grows, the difficulty in Bitcoin adapting will also grow (again, excluding some change in methodology). Litecoin (and in fact all altcoins I'm aware of) have more cohesive developers, which does mean they're a lot more able to change direction."
litecoin,3duurk,SD7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"As someone who has followed BTC the past few years I don't think many people have this perspective (I'm glad someone else sees it the same way I do). What matters is getting the core features right. To me, these come down to speed (confirmation time) and scaling (fee market and/or block size).  I strongly believe LTC has the better user experience with it's shorter confirmation times. Traders choose to use LTC as a way to move value between exchanges because of this (real world utility. As for the scaling aspect, it appears the BTC devs want to increase the block size, keeping fees low. It seems coblee has other plans and I think this will appeal to some BTC early adopters and serve as a clear differentiating feature for LTC."
litecoin,3duurk,iseeyoulookinghere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's worth saying that Litecoin starts with 4 times the throughput of Bitcoin (1MB blocks every 2.5 minutes vs 1MB every 10 minutes), which somewhat cools the need to expand blocks. Personally I don't think 1MB/10 minutes is enough even as a clearance network between faster technologies, but 4MB/10 minutes at least gives a lot more space to work with while solutions are tested."
