If you bake, grill or fry them, they'll lose a lot of the liquid in them and shrink down a fair amount. That's why so many people are poaching elephants nowadays rather than any other method, however it's pretty much impossible to cook an elephant without losing a little bit of the raw material so yes, the elephants are declining. The only solution is to stop cooking elephants but honestly, who wants that?"
shittyaskscience,3dxv32,DarkAlliGator,19,Mon Jul 20 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"I believe this is in fact the origin of the term ""the elephant in the room,"" meaning something that is actually quite large but has shrunk down to a smaller size due to fluid lost in the cooking process, and something therefore people do not want to discuss as it implicitly criticises the chef."

The problem is so many elephants are now in poke balls but not enough are in the breeding centers. This causes a disparity in their population."

shittyaskscience,3dx3s5,justaquicki,68,Mon Jul 20 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"I believe that Hank Hill is one the most complex and realistic characters in Animation. Although on the surface he appears to be nothing more than a redneck, if you actually watch the show and read between the lines, he's a lot more.  Hank Hill, and by extension King of The Hill as a whole, is at its core about showing that one group is not always right, and one group is not always wrong. It's not just blind Liberal bashing by some angry Texans, or angsty Liberal bawwing like Family Guy, it's somewhere in the middle.  Hank is a man who represents traditional family values. He works a just-above blue collar job, has an ugly wife, and a kid he fails to understand. He enjoys working on his lawn, grilling, and selling propane (and propane accessories).  because he represents traditional values, he often butts heads with newer, more liberal ideas. Now about half the time, he will have a hard time adjusting, but ultimately realize that it isn't that bad, or is even correct. But the other half of the time, he exposes it for the bullshit it is and tries to save those who have been brainwashed.  And that's the thing, Hank isn't a racist or Homophobe, or even a devout Republican. If that was the point of the show, he would have voted for Bush in that one episode. No, Hank is a good man who just has a hard time adjusting.  Hank stands by his family, his friends, and his family values, and this is why he is a good character. He has a hard time understanding his son, like a lot of parents, but ultimately loves him and accepts him for what he is.  When you really get down to it, Hank is so much more than your average sitcom father. Unlike the bumbling Homer, he is a very real man who many people can relate to THEIR fathers. he is the next progression in mature cartoons and sitcoms, a complex character, not a 1 dimensional caricature.  In short, he is the Average Joe the typical person represents, and that's a good thing."

So unless the weed increases your munchies faster than quadratically, you'll feel full after some number of pot brownies.  Not having any first-person familiarity with modern munchidynamics, I asked a local pothead how fast his munchies increase when he eats pot brownies. He responded '420, maaan...'. I assume this means that the derivative of the munchie level is a constant (specifically, 420), implying that munchies increase linearly. This suggests that yes, if you eat enough pot brownies, you'll eventually stop being hungry. However, since 420 is a relatively large constant, it's likely to take more than two brownies to reach that point."

It gets this name because the Tea-rex is known to be the first animal to cultivate tea.  To this day it is also very important cultivating many different types of tea where the bones of the rex must be planted next to the T-tree.  Now for the other 25 different letters I am not sure what happened to them but have heard of the Bee-rex.  Correct me if I am wrong (I do not have a major in Beeology) but I believe that it has been shown that the declining level of bees has been connected with the dwindling Bee-rex bone reserves.  Many scientists see this as a greater problem facing our society today than that of the falling oil reserves.

You see, our clothing soaks up most of the water when you're in the rain without an umbrella, so if you wanted to soak up all the water you needed, you'd have to go completely naked. What I do most of the time is just go to the local pool (this way it doesn't even have to be raining), strip down, and hop in.

Often, the wrinkliest and richest of society, most notably the white walkers of 14th century Westeros, would strike deals with professional baby makers. These baby makers would breed with their own daughters and give the males up for baby oil production. This was in an effort to standardise the genes and thus baby oil quality. It was also said that a male baby would provide the superior oil. The process was highly illegal even from the start however.  Nowadays, scientists have learned to synthesis baby oil, so that no babies are needed for production. The process is still highly controversial however, since many babies were used for harvesting oil in order to mimic and create the first synthetic design. The name of the baby breeder who provided the 20 or so male babies for the project was Johnson, and that is where the name ""Johnson's baby oil"" comes from.  Nether the less, there are still rouge baby breeders who produce ""Organic"" baby oil, which sells for £10,000 per 100ml bottle on the black market. Efforts to quell the illegal trade have been hampered by poor US-China relations, as the US feels that China's objections to the trade are an interference in it's national sovereignty."

One thing you can use to your advantage - for the average human body, gravity stops affecting it after a certain point.  After around 50 floors, buildings are required to have gravity enforcing machines.  you can head to any >50 floors building, go to the nearest window on any floor 51+, and just step out. you will literally just float there.  from there, you can begin climbing up. Around 2000 ft or so is where the asteroid will make it's brush past earth. just use the old thumb trick (stick your thumb up, to indicate you'd like the transportation to stop), they'll let you hop on you can collect some platinum (put it in your bushel), pay the conductor and hop off.  MAKE SURE YOU GET BACK TO THE WINDOW ON YOUR WAY DOWN. too many people forget to return to the window, and stroll down ... and suddenly they're at 49 floors and gravity is back and they get hurt on the way down."

So I'm gonna bet money that much platinum would cause a crazy decrease in value to the point that they'd make a loss. Therefore I think the best way to get it would be to fund a intergalactic portal, blow it up on purpose, then use the one we secretly built in China to teleport to the asteroid and use a giant crane to pull it through the portal. Thereby the majority of people think the plan was a failure and we don't crash the platinum prices."

shittyaskscience,3dtwyt,sterling_mallory,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:01 2015 UTC,Similar things attract eachother. What we need to do is to strap a bunch of lil' waynes by their feet at the end of a very long wire. We then send the rose of rappers with their platinum teeth to space and tether them to earth. This way when the asteroid passes earth it will attach to their front teeth like a magnet. It will then follow earth orbit and we can harvest it like a giant piñata. Everyone on earth will be given platinum grills.

shittyaskscience,3dtwyt,Leovinus_Jones,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"This has happened before. You know how when a musical album sells a million copies, it goes platinum? It just turns out the element Platinum is attracted to the quantity of millions. If we embrace enough forms of the million, it's path will change enough to allow us to send craft up and harvest some platinum from it.  Here are some simple ways you can help:   Wave platinum albums, such as 1989 or Adele's 21 toward the asteroid Enjoy media that embraces the million (Slumdog Millionaire, ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"", A Million Ways to Die in the West, Lil Wayne's A Milli, etc.) Transfers of currency in the millions do NOT work, so Nigerian princes and other millionaires must stick to the above options (scientists have yet to explain this phenomenon) Writing ""1,000,000"" on anything and waving it around in the air helps a little. Do it if you cannot participate any other way.   There is the Zuckerberg method, but it's nearly impossible. If a single status on the Facebook gets one million likes, that will have more than enough power to bring the asteroid close enough. (for the math geeks, that makes each like on the successful status worth about .8675309 PMU (Platinial Magnetism Unit).

I'm not afraid of armageddon from an asteroid impact, I just want dat cash money, with 54 trillion, or even if I sold it for a couple hundred BILLION, I'd be set for life. since nobody would buy it for 54 tril since theres only around 60-75trillion dollars on earth. So selling it for one trillion or a couple billion, hell I'd send as much as I could to starving people then buy my own country, one with plenty of natural resources(read: Oil, Diamonds, whatever, and yes I know diamonds are worthless because theyre not really rare but if I bought all the diamond mines I'm sure the diamond cartels would pay a hefty price to get them back, and if they started a civil war, I'm pretty sure I could pay more to PMC's than the diamond companies to secure my holdings--I'd settle for 750 billion dollars, enough that I could feed every starving person and make medical schools free, or at least hire my own physician to get some awesome drugs since he's getting paid half a billion a year, then lobby the US government with some SERIOUS cash to make the DEA go quietly into the night). FFS this would be so amazing to some how get ahold of but it appears it's just gonna be a near earth pass, the article says halfway between earth and the moon, kinda outta reach for..well everyone. Shame too cuz i'd just use it to get richer and richer, I'd fund renewable energy, buy the big 3 so as to have a good effect on global warming, build bullet trains, everything...but mainly I'd be hedonistic on a level never before seen and be dead by age 30 from living such an awesome life.  EDIT: I apparently need my glasses repaired more uregently than I thought, read it as 54 tril, apparently it's a mere 5.4 trillion dollars, still, that's enough to build the most powerful military in the world easily. But that's not what I'd use the money for, I'd hire PMC's to guard my little private nation but aside from my own debauchery, which would likely kill me at some point(therefore I'd set up a foundation upon my death, and still would settle for 750billion to 1 trillion dollars, more than the US spent in Defense funding last year, and more than they will have spent for the whole of 2015 as well) to make sure nobody goes hungry, nobody goes homeless, people with diseases are treated(everything from things that are easy to treat like Malaria, which is easy to treat and prevent, the sad fact is of course most people who die from it cannot afford or do not have access to treatment, some of them also still rely on which doctor type people, shamans, whatever you wanna call them) to things like HIV/AIDS/Cancers(of any kind)/any form of hepatitis/etc, I'd make sure they were all getting the best treatments possible, I'd make sure that areas with dirty water have industrial purification systems similar to what the military uses when they are doing humanitarian missions or simply haven't set up water treatment facilities in nations they've just invaded(e.g. the early days of the Afghan Invasion, they had to use a water purification machine at Bagram, but that machine can extract water from mud and it's drinkable, I'd make sure those were everywhere that needed one), I'd fund better orphanages, I'd fund PMC's in nations that struggle to get their governments functioning due to terrorist/warlords always trying to start Coups(Somalia comes to mind, Law and Order would be possible with the sort of fighters PMC's provide, many of which are ex army rangers, seals, green berets, marine force recon, even delta force and the SAS, I'd also use them to guard my little private nation where the debauchery happens). I'd say I'd keep 60 billion dollars but the rest would go to charity(once my family is taken care of for life, although I'd still want my own(I have none of these yet) children to go to college and get good ambitious jobs, their inheritance would be contingent upon hard work, same with my nieces and nephews, my sisters/brother in laws/parents/cousins/aunts/uncles/grandmothers(both grand fathers be dead) would also be well taken care of). I'd do my best to help out with global climate change, if that meant bribing chinese officials so they stop doing all the shit they're doing, and of course,  with western companies I could just buy them out, making it so they have a mandate to design super fuel efficient vehicles and electric(or develop reliable hydrogen cars, one of which would be shaped like a Zeppelin and named the HIndenburg for the lulz--but it'd not be a rigid airship, nope, it'd be like a greyhound bus type vehicle, just shaped like a rigid airship).  And for those asking what I'm high on the answer is a cocktail of oxymorphone(a potent opioid) along with benzodiazepines."

Anyways, you wouldn't normally use sig fig in pure math, but when applying it in a science, at least in my experience, you always have to adhere to the same number of sig figs, we always use 3 for anything unless specified otherwise. So no matter what you're doing, the answer is always in 3 sig fig unless specified otherwise."
shittyaskscience,3dpxcp,Hic142,6,Sun Jul 19 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, you use sig figs in science. The reason this is done is so that the results don't appear more accurate than they really are.  For example:  Let's say you're calculating a substance's concentration.   The formula is concentration = mols (6.02 * 1023 molecules) / volume (L)  If you know that you have exactly 1.323 L but you only know that you have approximately 4 mols then your calculated concentration would be 3.023431594860166...  But that gives the impression that your calculation is super accurate when in reality you do not even know the amount of mols to 1 decimal place. Therefore, to make sure you are not deceiving the reader of your paper by making your results seem more accurate than they really are, you use sig digs and in this case you would say that your concentration is 3 mols/L.  When you are adding and subtracting however, 3.4 + 7.23456789 is 10.63456789. This is 100% accurate so no need to reduce this to sig figs.  Sorry for the wall of text."

And in movies you can actually do what you want, you can make something that doesn't work in real life appear as though it works.   So let's look at these two important key point's and see if if we can come to a conclusion.  We now know they are only in movies, and we know that in movies you can make something that isn't real appear real, so that means that most likely the skeletons only appear to be playing trumpets, while they would indeed not be able to in real life.  So let's also look at 'what if skeletons are real', would they be able to play trumpets? Well, the definition of a skeleton is that its just the skeleton of a creature(most commonly a human), without the organs.   To play a trumpet, the first requirement to do so is to be able to blow air into the instrument. Since skeletons don't have lungs(an organ) in this case, they are not able to blow the air required to make music.  that's what the current theory says.

shittyaskscience,3dqllc,Wafflesaregr8,8,Sat Jul 18 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"""Is it called third degree murder because it's killing in cold blood?"""
shittyaskscience,3dqllc,An_Image_Of_Mohammed,9,Sat Jul 18 14:50:16 2015 UTC,"It's actually in Kelvin, as Lord Kelvin was the first to murder someone in all ways possible."

shittyaskscience,3dqllc,tamadekami,2,Sat Jul 18 18:34:36 2015 UTC,It was right in everyone's face. Celsius just made it visible. It was on the tip of everyone's tongue. Celsius just gave it a name.

shittyaskscience,3dqllc,charredgrass,2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:51 2015 UTC,It depends if it was a hot or a cold murder.
