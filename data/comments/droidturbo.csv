droidturbo,3e6lfv,Tomahawk92,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:21:28 2015 UTC,"I just got mine about a month ago, switched from Note 3. I love it. It does everything I need it to, with a battery that can hold up to always being on the go. I regularly work 10-16 hour shifts as a bartender, and this thing is still usually above 50% when I'm done.  Interface is smooth, even with Nova Launcher. Probably the best phone I've ever had."
droidturbo,3e6lfv,vandutton,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:47:39 2015 UTC,It's the first phone I've ever owned that I would fully recommend. You can use the phone as much as you want without worrying about killing the battery.  Charge it too 100% once a day and forget it.  I charge mine after work so i can unplug it when it's done.
droidturbo,3e6lfv,SkullFoot,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:02:51 2015 UTC,"It's a great phone and you can disable most of the junk, except Voicemail, which you can disable with debloater. Battery and screen is excellent.  Camera is very good.  Love the Moto features like automatic hands-free when driving and ""breathing"" notifications on lockscreen and gestures like twisting for camera and chopping for flashlight. Perfect size.  I don't like the ballistic nylon as it's more slippery than the regular back, if you don't use a case. Right now, we can get these on our business account for $19 and that's a STEAL for this phone."

You appear to have a massive wakelock issue (shown by the bar for time awake in comparison to screen on in the graph).  Try clearing the cache partition in the recovery menu.  Can you provide a screenshot of Google Play Services? I've noticed that with the new addition of ""Mobile radio active"" in the detailed stats, Google Play Services often shows up high when using location services. However the true drain is when ""CPU/Keep awake"" time is in the hours. I normally have ""CPU times"" of 3 mins, ""Keep awake"" times of 1-2 mins, with ""Mobile radio active"" times of 1-2 hours. I've restricted background data for Google Services and that seems to have taken Google Play Services off of the battery page. So far I haven't seen/experienced any ill/crippling effects."

Try the clearing the cache partition in recovery, and wait 1 to 2 charge cycles to see if it clears up. If it's still there, you could disable Google Play Services, and re-download it.

At the bottom there will be a toggle switch to restrict background data (on mobile networks). I also suggest looking through the upper portion of that list (where all of the high data using apps are) and restricting background data for apps you don't want to use background data.

droidturbo,3e04o7,yensid78,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"So far, I haven't seen anything change. From what I've noticed, Google Play Services keeps the Mobile radio awake more when location services is turned on, so I assume that time keeps going up because it is polling for your location in the background. When enabling location services, there is a pop-up stating something about anonymous location reporting, so I believe it is that."

droidturbo,3dhokf,_flea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:33:42 2015 UTC,"If you have a screen lock set, tap the back button to get the notifications screen. The media controls are on the new notifications screen Lollipop introduced.   Or go to Settings -> Security -> Power button shows lock screen and turn that off. With that off, pressing the power button will bring you to the notifications screen, instead of straight to the screen where you input your unlock PIN/password/pattern. However, unlocking from the swipe down on the Moto Display screen will not bring you to the media controls screen. The back button is needed if you unlock that way. (I think unlocking through Moto Display on KitKat did the same thing, but I don't remember.)  Some apps don't have the locked phone media controls on Lollipop, but I do know that Google Play Music has the controls. Pandora currently doesn't have the controls on Lollipop."
droidturbo,3dhzy2,craigkearney,10,Thu Jul 16 12:51:55 2015 UTC,"I just checked. The claim isn't 80% in 15 minutes, it is 8 hours of battery life in 15 minutes. Obviously this number will be different in different use cases, but it seems to match up with their idea that the phone will last 48hrs with a full charge.  The turbo charger has worked very well for me. If you try using a standard charger you should notice a massive difference."
droidturbo,3dhzy2,mivagina,5,Thu Jul 16 14:42:41 2015 UTC,I can usually get 1% per minute using quick charge.

droidturbo,3dhzy2,pr0grammer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:09:22 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are using a quality USB cable. Not all USB cables will support Turbo Charging. If you don't see the prompt ""Turbo Charger Detected"" when you plug in your phone, you aren't turbo charging. Also, Turbo charging is throttled the closer your phone gets to 100% charge. It will charge much faster the lower the the battery is, and slow down as it approaches 100%. This is to protect your battery."

droidturbo,3dgic6,Dmaster223,2,Thu Jul 16 02:19:08 2015 UTC,I believe it depends on the app you are using. I use Textra and it has the ability to quick reply by tapping the notification.

It just kinda went pfffttt, and went straight down to ~5%  Was your phone actually at 5% or so, and did you power off your phone to confirm it? It's possible your phone had a terrible miscalculation, read the voltage way, way, way to low, and registered your battery to be at 5% or so.   Try clearing the cache partition in the  recovery menu. Write-up on how to do it. Residual KitKat system files are most likely to blame. Or a faulty battery. Since there was no discharge, nor any one item on your battery list using an obscene amount of battery, I believe it was a calculation error/battery issue, and not a drain of some sort."

Combined with a iffy signal, and Snapchat is draining your battery.   Aside from the low on battery time, things look pretty normal in terms of Android System, and Android OS. Google Services is high, but that could be because you phone is new and is syncing up your Google data from your Maxx.   For the amount of on battery time you had, your SOT was pretty good, so its most likely Snapchat draining your battery. I'd suggest clearing  Snapchat's app data, and force stopping it, and uninstalling Snapchat to make sure.   Edit: Found the thread, and specific comment chain I read yesterday. It looks like Google Services being at 5% is a result of the new Snapchat update as well."

Never got the 'camera restart' error until just upgrading to Lollipop last week.  It seems to be only the back-facing camera (can't use front-facing in regular camera app, but can in Instagram) and the issue is on-and-off, totally unpredictable.  During times when it hasn't been working I've cleared cache/data, used safe-mode, and factory-reset my phone.  None of these proposed solutions seem to work.  In my mind, it's either a transient application issue with Google/Moto/Verizon apps (as problem persists in safe-mode) or a physical problem like a loose wire or contact inside the phone.  Either way this problem is bugging me the fuck out.  If the phone wasn't such a good wifi hotspot, it'd be in a million pieces right now."

For example, there were times I would try to use the hands free response to text while driving and it would start typing it's own voice that it must have picked up playing over the speakers.

droidturbo,3cvkeo,donteatthedog,12,Sat Jul 11 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"That's Priority mode. It's like a selective silent mode. You can pick a choose certain apps, and contacts that will make noise when a notification comes in. Moto Assist's Sleep function puts the phone into Priority mode now, instead of KitKat's silent mode.   If you tap one of the volume keys, the on screen volume controls will appear. When All is selected, that's like regular ringer on. With All selected, tap the Bell icon (left of the slider) to get vibrate only. Priority makes it so that it's ringer on, but notifications only from user specified contacts/apps. None is completely silent mode, no alarms will go off as well. Priority can be set up where no contracts are ""whitelisted"" so alarms will go off, but the rest of the phone is on silent, just like KitKat's silent mode."

droidturbo,3cvh76,Daguvry,2,Sat Jul 11 02:53:35 2015 UTC,I usually keep the screen brightness about halfway and the adaptive brightness off and usually get 4-5 hours screen on time.
droidturbo,3cvh76,MisterRandomness,2,Sat Jul 11 02:55:03 2015 UTC,"The fact that you turned brightness up all the way is irrelevant. Adaptive brightness simply adjusts the brightness to a comfortable viewing level. Some parts of your day may not require 50% brightness, such as being in a dimly lit room, so it knocks it down to say 15%. Instantly saves battery. Also better for your eyes. If your screen is too dim, it's hard for your eyes to focus on it. On the other hand, if it's too bright, it's also bad on the eyes. Computers are extremely efficient at determining the correct level of light. I'm assuming you didn't need 50% brightness all day. Do you tend to be in relatively dim places?"
droidturbo,3cvh76,gapost,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it helps on battery life. But personally, the adaptive brightness on the Turbo does one of the best jobs of any phone I have used.  Others would switch from dimmer to brighter too much or be too bright or too dim. Turbo adaptive brightness works good."

The bonus for root and flashing lollipop is if you don't like it, you can always downgrade. Root is 100% the way to go."

You could root it and not use any apps that require root permissions and it would be the same experience as stock. So if you chose to stick with 4.4 you flash and your done. If you want 5.1 you have to run some fast boot commands. Its very simple the guide explains everything. And I successfully attempted to downgrade from 5.1 to 4.4 so let me know if you have any questions on that.( http://www.theandroidsoul.com/update-droid-turbo-to-android-5-1-1-with-mofo-root-retained-yes-its-possible-now-81652/)"
droidturbo,3ct2kh,andy85333,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:02:13 2015 UTC,"The problem with root is the lack of ROMs for the Turbo. You won't get CyanogenMod, or any other custom ROMs like you see for other phones. And you don't get to modify your rooted system after it's installed. What you do get, is stock that is debloated, and typically has xposed and adblock installed. If you're technically minded you can modify you're own stock image, then install it. I never got that confident.  I went back to stock so I could take 5.1, and I don't miss the xposed modules or adblock much. Of course, 5.1 is not a huge world changer, either, but I do like it."
droidturbo,3ct2kh,clt829,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"I want to root just because I don't like them limiting what I can or cannot do. and because I haven't accepted lollipop, it sounds like this is my only chance. 0.0  And on the other hand, I routinely screw up my phone just by changing a setting or disabling an app, then forgetting what I changed when it mysteriously impacts something that seems unrelated. (example: disabled google now on old razr maxx hd, lost the handy microphone on my keyboard. how was I supposed to know? lol)   hearing people talk, it sounds like ""you really need to know what you're doing."" I think I can learn enough, I just don't know if I should. I saw a link to rootjunky.com with scripts that allow you to disable the bloatware. is that okay?    other than that ... well, I use my phone mostly to read (coolreader! - screw kindle) and surf and write things. I crash chrome by demanding it to work as a desktop at all times. I refuse to use apps for imdb, youtube, yahoo etc because I don't like surrendering functionality and zoom.

droidturbo,3ct2kh,Threadingemu,2,Fri Jul 10 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"If you have a screen lock set, tap the back button to get the notifications screen. The media controls are on the new notifications screen Lollipop introduced.   Or go to Settings -> Security -> Power button shows lock screen and turn that off. With that off, pressing the power button will bring you to the notifications screen, instead of straight to the screen where you input your unlock PIN/password/pattern. However, unlocking from the swipe down on the Moto Display screen will not bring you to the media controls screen. The back button is needed if you unlock that way. (I think unlocking through Moto Display on KitKat did the same thing, but I don't remember.)  Some apps don't have the locked phone media controls on Lollipop, but I do know that Google Play Music has the controls. Pandora currently doesn't have the controls on Lollipop."

From what I've read on this sub about the Best Buy blue Turbo, I get the feeling that Verizon doesn't want to deal with the Screen Assurance claims because it's a Best Buy special, and they'll try to pass it on to Motorola.

droidturbo,3cpxv4,pajkb31,3,Thu Jul 9 22:26:15 2015 UTC,+1!  I have the white version of the Tudia case. It's definitely protective but adds a bit of thickness to the phone. So when I (rarely) take the phone out of the case it seems so thin. I'm looking to get a thinner TPU case to switch it up.
droidturbo,3cpxv4,kadaj21,4,Fri Jul 10 01:08:34 2015 UTC,I've got the tech21 case and I love it.  Read up on the technology of the orange stuff they put in that case.  Thats what sold me on it.  It doesn't add much bulk to the phone either (which was a big deal for me) unlike the otterbox or lifeproof cases.  I have dropped my phone a couple of times and so far so good.  The phone has 1 free screen glass replacement so I don't use a glass cover.   The glass they use has become so hard that it's going to shatter vs scratch.
droidturbo,3cpxv4,RobotJiz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:42:23 2015 UTC,Love this case.
droidturbo,3cpxv4,bigblue36,3,Fri Jul 10 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"I got the Tudia case.  It does the job and looks pretty nice.  Also it is a great price, I think I got mine for a few bucks on amazon.  My only complaints are that it is a little bigger than I was hoping for and the back can be a little bit slippery at times if it is sitting on a slick surface (like a granite counter).  I would love to hear what other people have found though.  I wouldn't mind having a second case that would let me switch things up from time to time."
droidturbo,3cpxv4,bbauer09,2,Thu Jul 9 21:47:02 2015 UTC,Would you say it would protect your phone from minor drops?
droidturbo,3cpxv4,bbauer09,3,Thu Jul 9 22:03:40 2015 UTC,Yes.  I feel really safe with my phone in this case.  It is a soft case with a hard back.  The screen corners are completely protected.
droidturbo,3cpxv4,PEBCAKuser,3,Thu Jul 9 23:03:25 2015 UTC,"I've tried many cases, but I keep coming back to incipio cases."
droidturbo,3cpxv4,whatdc,3,Fri Jul 10 00:39:35 2015 UTC,My incipio has broken two corners off while in my pocket and a third is already cracked. Do I just have one from a bad batch?
droidturbo,3cpxv4,xshare,3,Fri Jul 10 00:55:53 2015 UTC,Mine broke a corner too! Really bad design flaw
droidturbo,3cpxv4,PEBCAKuser,2,Fri Jul 10 01:49:43 2015 UTC,"I've had one on an s3 since it was new with no issues.   Dropped my turbo a few times and cracked a corner off.   Tried multiple different cases, and none seemed satisfactory, so I am back in an incipio case again."
droidturbo,3cpxv4,RegularJackoff,2,Fri Jul 10 01:03:45 2015 UTC,"I'm using a Life proof on mine.  I work construction and use my flashlight a lot.  It seems to be overkill for what you are looking for,  but I have dropped it on various surfaces and it is completely fine.  Most drops have only been from a few feet,  but I've dropped it onto concrete,  wood floors,  pavement,  mud puddles,  and a toilet.  I probably sound like a Life proof shill,  but I can't recommend the case enough.  It is not too bulky either.  However,  since it is a sealed case,  the sound from the speakers is noticeably quieter but still loud enough to listen to music or for the alarm to wake me up.  But the main con is the price,  mine cost 80 dollars,  but if you want a case you can put your phone in and pretty much not ever worry about breaking or getting it wet,  then it's the way to go,  in my opinion."
droidturbo,3cpxv4,NickShevy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:51:42 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know of any good wallet cases? I'd prefer one without a flip front, basically a case with a credit card holder or two on the back or something."

I used my stock Droid Turbo wall charger which goes up to 1.6A output, but I noticed the input of the Aukey portable battery can go up to 2.1A. Will I recharge my portable battery faster using another wall charger like this that outputs up to 2A - http://www.amazon.com/Qualcomm-Certified-Aukey-Charger-Included/dp/B00QEX83LA?  Also, will my Droid Turbo charge quicker with the above linked wall charger since it outputs 2A?"
droidturbo,3cpjra,scottymtp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"Not quite. If you look at the specifications, the input can charge the power pack at 5V/2.1A OR 9V/1.8A, the latter of which is part of the Quick Charge system (and is therefore faster). The Droid Turbo's included charger should be capable of charging this power pack at the maximum rate since it can provide either standard."

droidturbo,3clfnw,SkullFoot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:04:50 2015 UTC,"Ahh well in that case your battery life is to be expected.   I don't see how you can keep it at maximum brightness. The stock auto brightness was WAAAAY too bright IMO. I use Lux with a -45% offset to the normal auto brightness range and now it's perfect. Still bright enough to read in direct sunlight too. I normally manage just over 6 hours SOT per charge on LTE with Bluetooth on, no WiFi. No streaming though."

One of my friends with a Turbo has very different battery life stats. We live in the same town, so we're obviously on the same towers but his Turbo has Cell Standby as the number one battery drain. Mine is always Google Services. His Turbo has apps still running even though they're disabled.   Edit: to clarify, I meant to add that his Turbo has terrible battery life whereas mine is almost DROID MAXX levels(best battery life of any phone period. 8+ hours SOT). His is always on WiFi, mine is never on WiFi and I have it connected to my Moto 360 all the time. Doesn't make sense."

The camera is pretty good, but I'm not a pro photographer and don't take a lot of photos, so my expectations for a phone camera are lower than some people.

droidturbo,3cm56x,racecar-acecar2,2,Fri Jul 10 00:54:42 2015 UTC,I concur. I really like this phone despite all the Android L delay hate.  However I can not recommend it because of its age. Get a different flagship or wait for the next one.
droidturbo,3cm56x,jjossie,2,Sun Jul 12 16:14:04 2015 UTC,"What's the most important feature of a smartphone in your opinion? If you're coming from the GNex, any flagship will be a HUGE step-up in every way imaginable.  Coming from a GNex and a G2, the Turbo (in some ways) will feel natural since it uses vanilla android, but you may find things you don't like about it (non-removable battery, capacitive off-screen buttons). If you go with the G4 or the Galaxy S6, you might find their skinned UI is a turn off.  Edit: You're probably used to this if you came from the VZW GNex (Toro) but Android M is probably going to be delayed by nearly a year after most phones get it (if it's even released for the Turbo)."

droidturbo,3cia66,mlw4428,0,Wed Jul 8 15:00:18 2015 UTC,All it means is giving yourself root level permissions.
droidturbo,3cia66,Astray,0,Wed Jul 8 15:10:19 2015 UTC,Kind of? Literally root on Android is root access to the underlying Linux system as well as any Android specific permissions.   Those app root managers act similar to sudo in Linux and grant file permission/OS permissions as well as any Android (whatever those might be) permissions.

droidturbo,3cgy1x,setthehook,2,Mon Jul 13 02:31:04 2015 UTC,"Nope. It's pretty beneficial. It's like brushing your teeth (or going to the bathroom).   It just cleans out cached system files, which help your phone run smoother and more efficiently. Sometimes too many cached files can bog down your phone, and sometimes they are simply unneeded. In the case of going from 4.4.4 KitKat to 5.1 Lollipop, some of the files cached for KitKat serve no purpose to Lollipop. Clearing the app cache in Settings -> Storage ->tap Cached data and clear it, also removes old cached data for your apps. Clearing your cache partition in recovery, and cached app data in settings does not remove any of your stuff.   It may take a couple charge cycles before things start to level out in terms of battery life. After clearing the caches, your phone needs to build up new cached data."

If the phone won't charge or turn on at all, you're pretty much out of options (unless the problem is with the battery or its connection to the motherboard). :(  Even if the hardware looks intact, the pressure could have damaged/destroyed the motherboard or some of the chips.  The only thing I can think of would be to have a data recovery lab remove the flash memory from the motherboard and try to get the information off on a different board, but that's likely infeasible/impossible (and even if it were possible, it'd cost a LOT more than $5000)."

Like another user said above, the motherboard itself is cracked, the battery might be messed up, or god knows what unless you crack it open. And if the memory chip is still good, Im not even sure if you can unmount and remount.   The other other thing I could think of is why the phone wouldn't register is if the battery is dead. (Plugging it in would try and charge it.) So, if everything happens to be still intact, try and give it a charge for 15-20 minutes(that should be enough for 15% or more) and try and plug it in. Mind you, that you should probably keep an eye on it incase if there are any short circuits that may ruin the phone or potentially cause a fire.

droidturbo,3cbop0,racecar-acecar2,4,Mon Jul 6 22:14:12 2015 UTC,It looks like the S6 is rootable and it's an all around good phone.

droidturbo,3cbop0,LittleBrownPipe,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"Verizon   Verizon doesnt like people with root or boot for most phones. Free wifi teathering and whatnot, so on and so forth."
droidturbo,3cbop0,systemhost,2,Mon Jul 6 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, long ass reply, idk why feel free to ignore this I'm just rambling.  WiFi tethering only really concerns those who are still grandfathered in on their unlimited data plan, everyone else have free tethering enabled by default. But that was a valid reason for them bring very pro locked bootloader several years ago.   Today I think they're just control freaks, they want absolute control over our devices and don't want to deal with users modifying their roms, disabling preloaded apps and possibly bricking their phones.   But since I've ditched my unlimited plan last year I haven't had too much of an urge to root my phone, but that's probably because this phone is a Verizon exclusive and even with full root and unlocked bootloader there won't be many devs actively working on roms and comparability.  I did root my Verizon LG G pad for system wide ad blocking mostly. But overall Android had improved enough that I don't feel the need to root and flash various roms and mod settings like I did back with my OG droid. Still wish we had an unlocked bootloader but I don't really miss all the hours spent tinkering and occasionally messing something up like a soft brick."

Given that, as others have said, the camera is only good, not phenomenal, also while the front facing speaker is nice, the quality is not that great. It's passable, and I'll take it over the higher quality, but back facing speaker of the droid maxx I'm coming from, but it would have been nice if the speaker was of the same quality and front facing."
droidturbo,3cbop0,systemhost,2,Mon Jul 6 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"Same here, I rode out my RAZR maxx for three years with custom roms for minor overclocking and such and was content with it most of the time but was very curious how much the technology had advanced over the previous three years. Compared to the RAZR I'm very happy with this phone. Slow updates are annoying and disappointing but I'm content with lollipop now.  Camera is high megapixel but that doesn't equate quality, so it's not really all that great but still a huge improvement, battery life I similar to my experience with the RAZR maxx which is great considering the screen size and pixel density on the turbo. Plus the CPU/GPU power is so much more than we had previously.   Sure there's better phones out there, and there's different phones for different people depending on what their wants and needs are, but I got this phone free plus $100 credit with Verizon for dropping my unlimited plan and I'm happy with that."
droidturbo,3cbop0,hotpuck6,2,Mon Jul 6 21:31:04 2015 UTC,You're really not going to beat the droid turbo for free. It's definitely a great flagship with only minor compromises.
droidturbo,3cbop0,systemhost,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I felt. Looking at the new huawei phones that have been coming out lately makes me feel like my next upgrade will be off contract and maybe bought from china.   But over all the simplicity of getting a reliable phone that's pretty much cutting edge subsidised through my cellular provider is just too tempting. I don't travel nearly as much as I used to so I see less and less value in paying for Verizon's nationwide coverage when I seldom use even a fraction of it.  I'm tempted to try T-Mobile and take them up on the buy me out of my contract etf refund deal but my research shows that the turbo isn't completely comparable with T-Mobile's  LTE bands. But hey, all things considered I'm happy with my phone and service. It's just Verizon's pricing that gets to me but part of that is the phone subsidies and the other is their huge investment in coverage which makes them arguably the most reliable America cellular provider and they know that."

Picture quality is OK, but I think a step down from other flagships External speaker is meh. I'm not happy with sound quality on phone calls - but I'm not this isn't just my phone's problem. Battery life isn't as good as I hoped. I think the super high res screen kills battery life. No fingerprint scanner"
droidturbo,3cbop0,systemhost,3,Mon Jul 6 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds quality or sound volume? Because quality could be improved by enabling advanced calling though there's some occasional issues with LTE coverage and call volume can be greatly increased by changing an option in settings.   Battery life for me is very good, not amazing but it all really comes down to having too many background apps/bloatware that keeps the phone active and of course the biggest drain being the 1440p screen and backlight. Using auto brightness really helps your screen on time and overall battery life but I use lux to take it even further and have actually managed a little over 10 hours of screen on time on a single charge without dimming my screen too much where it's hard to see.   Anyways, I know this thread is asking for all the cons and negatives for why someone might not want this phone, but I just figured I'd see if I could offer any help for those two issues you listed."
droidturbo,3cbop0,_Aardvark,2,Mon Jul 6 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Sound quality is my complaint. Sounds tinny. I have enable advanced calling, in fact I think it sounded better before that update. Most calls are from the center of a major city, so I suspect I'm getting a pretty good LTE connection. I wonder if I have some dust or something in the speaker.  I had to use only my iPhone 5 (work, I'm a mobile developer) for a week while I lent the Turbo to my son. I was surprised that calls sounded much better. (iPhone is AT&T, and obviously the Turbo is Verizon).  Call volume isn't great, usually due to the off center speaker. This isn't just me, right, call sound only comes from the right side of the top grill? That's another con.  Battery... well, the jury is still out after the 5.1 update, it's looking better for me. I'd lose like 20-30% of life with the phone stilling unused on my desk at work. However looking at the battery stats today looks better. Maybe I'm just looking for the advertised 48 hour life (ha!)."

The turbo charging feature is nice, but you'll find that with other flagships these days. If getting the latest software in anything resembling a timely fashion matters to you, look elsewhere (although if you're coming from a MAXX, it doesn't seem like it does).

droidturbo,3cbop0,racecar-acecar2,2,Tue Jul 7 09:55:21 2015 UTC,"I personally don't have a preference as long as it isn't a modified button layout/physical button like Samsung. I used to think the argument for them was the ability for manufacturers could make smaller bezels, but I think the bottom bezel size for the Turbo is great. If anything, the capacitive buttons help with AMOLED burn in.  It sort of matters now since there's the new feature with Chrome on Lollipop with the tab count. Not a big deal but a gripe nonetheless (I could change it back so tabs are within Chrome but then the nav bar loses its color change feature)."

You'll be hard pressed to find a solution for this, with the trend of Android phones going bigger.  I frequently have to operate an iPhone 6 for the surgeon I work with, while they are stuck in a sterile field. Even with the phone in it's case, it is the sweet spot of sizes for me.

Utilitarian design. Off screen buttons. Crappy speaker, even if it is front facing. No sd card. No removable battery. Apps force close a lot. Fussy wifi. Fewer LTE bands, causing a constant signal drop or very slow load inside buildings. Verizon took what could have been a major draw for the carrier and Motorola and in the end, cut corners. It's not a bad device, per se, as it's probably better than most, but it got tiring always having to manage it.  Alright, let the hate train roll because I gave an opinion based on my experience."

droidturbo,3c7xv1,Remy45,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"I was having major issues with Google Play services taking up 10-20% of my battery itself and keeping the system awake all the time.    Yesterday I uninstalled all of the Google Play services updates (Settings -> Apps -> All -> Google Play Services -> Uninstall Updates; you may need to first disable the Android Device Manager [Settings -> Security -> Device administrators] first, but can reenable it afterwards).  Once the updates are removed, you'll be prompted by other programs to update GP services again.  There are a bunch of settings that you'll need to reset afterwards, and if you have an Android watch attached, it will require a reset.  It's made a significant difference in my battery life (5 hours of heavy use and I'm at 83% battery power).  Up until yesterday the battery had been at 40-50% at this time of the day.

Search cached data in settings, tap it, then tap on the part of your used data that says cached data and say OK to deleting all cached data. Maybe the reason why it helps is because it still has cached data for android 4.4.4 related things, that aren't necessarily the most efficient under android 5.1."

It does not instantaneously do that. Yes, the button takes you ""instantaneously"" to the settings page but it's still two more button presses with Extended Settings, or one more with the built in app drawer widget, than it was previously. Also, Extended Settings sits in the app drawer just like the stock controller, unlike the old one which was on the home page. So instead of unlocking the screen and pressing one button with the stock controller, its unlock, swipe, press and press again with stock or unlock, swipe, and press three times with the app. That doesn't solve my problem or the problem of the guy who asked you that question."

I have big hands but don't want to always have huge pockets lol  I was thinking if I really wanted to moto x that I would just leave verizon and go to T-mobile.   Having July as my upgrade month sucks because it's on the outside of all of the good releases... October-April.
droidturbo,3bv9so,whatdc,2,Thu Jul 2 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"Fwiw unlocked nexus 6 have been on sale from moto and Google for like $150 off recently. You might buy one if the hot models on contract and then swap it for the nexus 6. Alternatively just call and have them lower your monthly rate for being off contract, either $10 or $25 off depending on your data plan selected ($25 off for 6 gig data plans or more)."

droidturbo,3bv9so,pandroidgaxie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:16:27 2015 UTC,I certainly is and that is probably the only complaint that people have for it.
droidturbo,3bv9so,thepocketnerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"definitely contact verizon and make them lower your monthly bill now that your contract is over. Tmobile has forced carriers to admit how much of our bill goes to paying off the ""free"" phone. And your phone is all paid for. like whatdc said, the discount amount is determined by your data plan."
droidturbo,3bv9so,thepocketnerd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"You don't have to upgrade right away, you could wait to use your upgrade until the fall.   Edit: That being said, the Turbo is a fantastic phone, especially now that its been updated to Lollipop. Though if T-Mobile is good in your area, moving to them would be a great move, too."

droidturbo,3bu1s4,ss4444gogeta,5,Thu Jul 2 04:06:10 2015 UTC,If you hold power off button you can restart in safe mode. But yup that's it.
droidturbo,3bu1s4,andrsg,6,Thu Jul 2 08:31:22 2015 UTC,So they got rid of the quick volume buttons? Dang. I liked those.
droidturbo,3bu1s4,loganlightcap,3,Thu Jul 2 12:37:06 2015 UTC,"Tap one of the volume keys, and the on screen volume controls are there. When All is selected, that's like regular ringer on. With All selected, tap the Bell icon (left of the slider) to get vibrate only. Priority makes it so that it's ringer on, but notifications only from user specified contacts/apps. None I believe is silent mode."
droidturbo,3bu1s4,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:00 2015 UTC,I don't have lollipop yet. I'm waiting to make sure everything is good before I update. But my friend said that on his galaxy 5s you cannot put the phone on silent and still have alarms go off. Is that the case for us as well?
droidturbo,3bu1s4,loganlightcap,2,Thu Jul 2 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"I believe Priority is the setting to use so alarms go off, but the rest of the phone is on silent. I think Priority can be set up so that it basically functions as regular silent mode, with alarms. I'm not too sure though, as I don't use my Turbo for alarms."
droidturbo,3bu1s4,iiWoodstocK,3,Thu Jul 2 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, you got it. In Lolllipop, silent means silent. In Priority mode, you can choose what gets let through. By default, only Alarms and event reminders will sound in priority mode while everything else stays silent.  You can also choose to let through all calls, messages, or only those from specific contacts in priority mode. This is the new piece in Lollipop that wasn't available in KitKat."

I messed with the brightness slider that's in the notification drop down, and there doesn't seem to be a way to switch it back to auto brightness.  If I go into Settings > Display, there is a toggle for ""Adaptive brightness"" which is set to ""On"", but the brightness still seems tied to the slider setting. What am I missing?    Also, on an unrelated note: this kind of makes it hard to see what you are typing when commenting here."
droidturbo,3brm1j,BIGpimpSPENDcheese,8,Wed Jul 1 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, There is this explanation (from David Ruddock, the guy that claimed the Turbo would get 5.1 on 6/10):  http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/06/26/android-l-feature-spotlight-auto-brightness-is-gone-adaptive-brightness-takes-its-place/   In short, adaptive brightness is like quasi-autobrightness. You're essentially setting a ""range"" of available brightness levels when this feature is turned on, so that if you have display brightness set to 50%, the phone may only actually adjust itself between 40 and 70% brightness in a given situation. This is as opposed to completely automatic brightness, which typically gives you the full spectrum of brightness adjustments depending on the ambient light. The problem with fully automatic brightness is that's it's often slow and a poor judge of what level of brightness your eyes really need. So, this adaptive mode allows you to set a baseline brightness that the phone will then adjust from based on your surroundings.   In the comments, someone replied to hims saying:   I doubt the adaptive brightness works the way you explained it. I think it adjusts it's auto-brightness algorithm like Lux did. When you adjust the slider to + or - from center, it simply decides if you want your auto brightness to be on dimmer side or brighter side.  Let's say you set the slider to 30% (-20 from middle point), then it would keep the brightness to 20% dimmer than usual auto-brightness. If you set it to 70% (+ 20 from middle point), it would set the brightness to 20% brighter than usual auto-brightness.  The slider decides how dim or bright you want your auto-brightness to be from their usual algorithm. So on Nexus 5, I've set my slider to be on dimmer side as their usual auto-brightness is too bright for my taste.   Seems to be as clear as mud!"
droidturbo,3brm1j,ANormalSpudBoy,2,Wed Jul 1 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Adaptive is still like auto, but you can control the base brightness level. So the brightness still changes in different lighting, but you control how bright you like it."

droidturbo,3brm1j,xxile,3,Wed Jul 1 19:02:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, I answered my own question by trial and error. Yes, unrooting is required before taking the 5.1 OTA update. All the posted methods for unrooting require wiping userdata, although I was able to do it without losing any data. Here's my process:  (I already had ADB installed on Linux. Your process might require that first.)    Download stock image VRZ_XT1254_SU2-12_12_CFC.xml. Don't run the included batch file, as that has a command to wipe userdata. Unzip. Reboot phone into fastboot: sudo fastboot reboot-bootloader Flash boot, recovery, radio, and system: sudo fastboot flash boot boot.img sudo fastboot flash recovery recovery.img sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk1 sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk2 sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk3 sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk4 sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk5 sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk6 sudo fastboot flash system system.img_sparsechunk7 sudo fastboot flash radio radio.img Hit power button to boot (""Start"") Check for updates, accept 5.1 upgrade. Wait. This thing takes forever to install and it'll look frozen.   Edit: One more thing: After upgrade to Lollipop, the bootloader now shows ""software status official"" (before it was ""modified""), so I look good for warranty service again!"

droidturbo,3brm1j,Remy45,2,Wed Jul 1 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yup! This process allowed me to upgrade smoothly, and as you notice there's no step that touches the userdata partition.  I'm pretty happy with the update. My primary reason for wanting root in the first place was to use GravityBox QuickTiles for a hotspot toggle.

droidturbo,3br2d4,ShockingLegend,6,Wed Jul 1 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"You can just install the update from the 'OTA available' thread - it's the real deal. I installed it last night, everything is smooth sailing.   I charged my phone to 100% after installing, took it off the charger and let it sit on wifi while I slept - woke up with an 11 day battery estimate. 9 hours and it had lost 3 percent.  Be aware that installing/updating apps takes a bunch longer now, since ART is performing full ahead-of-time compilation, with more optimizations. After downloading it took google play services at least 3-6 minutes to install. Be aware that while play services is updating, the play store may wig out a little bit - ""you're not signed in"" errors, etc. It goes away once play services finishes installing.  Also, I recommend installing on the charger, while the phone is charged to 100% - reason being, that the phone does get considerably hot while doing the install and app optimizations during first boot, and then you'll have a few apps (play services) to update from the store. I recommend having it on the charger so it doesn't eat too much battery. Joule-for-joule, the phone heats less when draining from the charger and not the battery. I recommend having it charged to 100% before installing otherwise it'll try to charge the battery while installing, in which case the charger and the install are both contributing to heat and the damn thing will get seriously hot.  So charge to 100% so it won't charge while updating, and install on the charger to be nice to your battery.  Edit: screenshot of the version info: http://imgur.com/jUcYR3b"

So far everybody I know (a handful of folks) have installed it and had no trouble.   We'll see once the regular OTA process starts, because then we'll be able to compare the timestamps etc to figure out whats what.  Also, if you're leaving the country without a computer, I might not apply the update at all until you get back - the soak was very short so I don't think anything got changed (I think the soak build is the final build) and there were reports of soakers having to factory reset - https://www.reddit.com/r/droidturbo/comments/3bn2mr/where_do_we_talk_about_soak/"

droidturbo,3btas3,einyv,4,Thu Jul 2 00:23:10 2015 UTC,Automatic brightness is not adaptive brightness. Turning off adaptive brightness is manual adjustment. Please see below  https://www.reddit.com/r/droidturbo/comments/3brm1j/slug/csozre0
droidturbo,3btas3,einyv,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"I read it, it is saying it is a quasi- brightness. So with it on, just set the control to the highest end instead of having the default to be in the middle so that might work for you.  Otherwise the only thing I can think of is perhaps some 3rd pay app.  Good luck and I apologize if my answer doesn't help."
droidturbo,3btas3,einyv,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"From the second quote on the linked comment.... Setting it to maximum will make your brightness at any time be 50-100%, let's say."

droidturbo,3bn0i0,imsoupercereal,2,Tue Jun 30 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"Buttons on the back, acting as a pocket warmer, GPS that effectively didn't work, abysmal battery life, the most fragile screen ever made, and there were more things.  The only redeeming thing was knock-on, but Moto has that well covered with the Turbo.  Droid Turbo even on KitKat is 10x the phone of the LG G2."
droidturbo,3bn0i0,turbodude69,2,Tue Jun 30 19:36:16 2015 UTC,maybe you had a defective phone.  i didnt really have any of those other issues.  except the battery life sucked when i updated it to LP.  which is why i'm gonna hold out with KK as long as i can on my turbo.
droidturbo,3bn0i0,Ravanas,2,Tue Jun 30 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say Moto has knock on covered well enough, but damn if I don't still miss that feature.  Also, the LG task list worked better for me than the third party options I've tried.  (Ties in with Exchange, but also has phone only tasks, and was a nice simple to-do list without all the extraneous-for-me features 3rd parties tend to go for.)  That said, I still think the Turbo is a better phone.  But knock-on is still badass, and while Moto has a decent enough alternative, it's not quite as good IMO.  The rest of the phone more than makes up for it though."
droidturbo,3bn0i0,racecar-acecar2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:43:14 2015 UTC,Did you buy it used? I just came from a G2 and I would say it had comparable battery life to the Turbo (at least heavy usage cycles).

droidturbo,3bn0i0,turbodude69,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:14:01 2015 UTC,do you think maybe my battery life was so bad was just because the battery was old? the phone was prob close to 2 yrs old
droidturbo,3bn0i0,racecar-acecar2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:38:38 2015 UTC,Most likely. Li-Po batteries have a limited life expectancy and max capacity decreases after numerous charge cycles.  I know OTA updates sometimes cause issues (slowdowns and battery drain) that factory resets usually help with. I would say it's a combination of factors but the biggest would be the decrease in battery capacity after 2 years of charge cycles.
droidturbo,3bn0i0,turbodude69,2,Tue Jun 30 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"yeah i considered swapping out the battery, but then i realized i had an upgrade, so i decided to just go with the turbo.  its waaaaay faster, i'm definitely happy with my purchase. lets hope LP doesn't kill it"
droidturbo,3bn0i0,akmjolnir,2,Tue Jun 30 22:44:43 2015 UTC,Is this only for the soak test?
droidturbo,3bn0i0,driscoll42,5,Tue Jun 30 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"These release notes will apply to the full release as well, which starts tomorrow."
droidturbo,3bn0i0,akmjolnir,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:29:07 2015 UTC,Thanks.
droidturbo,3bn0i0,gapost,2,Tue Jun 30 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"I like Moto Assist a lot.  And love the twist to open the camera.  I see in the notes you will be able to ""chop"" to turn on or off flashlight.  That's cool!"

droidturbo,3bpo5f,Joeblow7070,2,Wed Jul 1 03:38:43 2015 UTC,That's from my turbo.
droidturbo,3bpo5f,jaz0n1984,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:03:12 2015 UTC,That's how mine looks as well. I'm just curious as to if the option is going to make rooting actually possible in the future.
droidturbo,3bpo5f,mec287,2,Wed Jul 1 04:14:39 2015 UTC,Nope. It's a security measure in 5.0 to prevent theft and wiping. You still need a code from Verizon or Motorola to unlock the bootloader
droidturbo,3bpo5f,_flea,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:25:44 2015 UTC,Ahh OK. I figured it wasn't as simple as just unlocking it. Thanks.
droidturbo,3bpo5f,jaz0n1984,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:10:08 2015 UTC,I'm might call verizon and moto and ask for the code once the update goes live.
droidturbo,3bpuj0,Datdamdavid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:38:43 2015 UTC,I just dealt with this. When your looking at the dead Android guy press the power button for 1 second then the volume up rocker then let go.  It took a few tries but it worked.
droidturbo,3bpuj0,jaz0n1984,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:20:15 2015 UTC,"Worked like magic on the first go. Thanks, helped out quite a bit!"
droidturbo,3bpuj0,mec287,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"Turn off the phone. Hold volume down then, while still holding volume down, hold down the power button until the screen comes on. This should get you to the bootloader. Use the volume keys to scroll the bootloader menu. Press power to confirm. When you enter recovery you'll see an android with an exclamation point. Hold the power button down, then while holding the power button, press the volume up button. You should be able to now see a list of commands."
droidturbo,3bp3kh,DireWolf214,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:20:29 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Try rebooting, and charging back to full to see if it appears again. Also clear your cache in recovery. There's a link on how to get to clear your cache in the thread I linked.  I also created this thread which contains some other possible remedies."
droidturbo,3bp3kh,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:17:38 2015 UTC,I just cleared my cache in recovery. Should I wait till the phone dies to charge it back to full?
droidturbo,3bp3kh,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:21:13 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter. Charging to full will just clear out the battery page so you can see if it appears again.
droidturbo,3bp3kh,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:28:19 2015 UTC,Doing that now. I'll post the battery usage tomorrow

droidturbo,3bosfp,gabe1989,3,Tue Jun 30 22:55:57 2015 UTC,Mine has held up spectacularly. I would definitely regret not having gotten it had I not. It pretty much nullified the need for a case for me.

droidturbo,3bkgdr,iiWoodstocK,-2,Tue Jun 30 00:48:51 2015 UTC,If you're truly testing something a larger sample will give you better indications of issues. Your logic makes no sense. Also they don't need you to submit feedback they know if the software installed fine and most people have the check box to send them diagnostics set. I honestly think it's pretty stupid - no other company including Google does soak tests and I don't see phones dying due to updates
droidturbo,3bkgdr,mobilehavoc,2,Tue Jun 30 01:08:26 2015 UTC,"Not my ""logic,"" it's Moto's. I agree with you, though. A larger, but controlled sample size yields a better representation of what to expect when the public release gets pushed to an even larger sample size, but Moto says the only way to stay in good standing for soaks is to make posts when in the soak. So they want people to voice their findings, and the only way to keep that manageable is to limit the sample size.   If you are included in activity, provide feedback! If we ask you to provide your feedback on software, for example, and you don't post observations or respond to surveys, we will notice. If that is a habit, we’ll stop including you at all.  It is our goal to include every member who fits our target profile for an activity and who completes the registration survey. However, there are limits to how much feedback we can absorb, so we do limit how many can be included. There are some target groups where we have far more interested candidates than we can use, so some are left out.   https://forums.motorola.com/posts/77d4221775"

droidturbo,3baybw,n0tj0sh33,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:09:08 2015 UTC,There isn't much running.  I recently ran through a battery saving thread on here and changed most of my settings to preserve battery life.  My battery usage is average at most times.  I get maybe 12 hours of moderate usage on my battery.
droidturbo,3baybw,n0tj0sh33,2,Sat Jun 27 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"Holy hell, that's aweful. With light use on wifi, my phone will go 40-50 hours on a single charge.  Can you post your battery stats (and list of battery-using applications), along with a list of your installed applications (if you don't mind telling us)? Also, take a look at your data usage tabs - both the cellular (mobile) tab and the wifi tab. If you have some app, background or otherwise, that is eating tons of data (like wifi data) then that would explain the massive power draw.  Also, I recommend an app like SystemPanel (the lite version is fine) to get an idea of what is actually running.  There's definitely something wrong with your phone. Do you spend most of your time on cellular, or do you use wireless? Is your cellular signal strength strong, or is the cell radio having to chew through battery to keep the thing in touch?  One good test is to charge the phone, put it in airplane mode and then manually re-enable wireless - this will disable the cellular radio entirely, but still let you use the phone (except for calls/messages). When run like this, the phone should last a lot longer, probably about 60 hours. If it doesn't last 40-60 hours, then that means that there's some app causing the phone to chew through CPU.  Do you have ART as the runtime, or dalvik? If you've not changed the settings (and you have to go out of your way to do so), it's dalvik, which is fine."
droidturbo,3baybw,n0tj0sh33,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:33:47 2015 UTC,"I will get you a screenshot of the battery usage right now.  Mind you I charged last night to 100% and was already below 50% as of 10am.  I can manually type the list of installed apps but it may take a while, is there something faster to do this?  I am on cellular 95% of the time during the day and I drive all over the place so cell signal can go from good to bad.  I would love to see how long the battery lasts using airplane mode with WIFI enabled but I can't do that as my phone is constantly getting important work related information.  I have not touched any ART or dalvik settings."

Personally, I'm a huge fan of the hover to wake and then the notification previews at the wake screen, for example.  Camera difference is marginal, finger print reader isn't 100%, SD cards don't really matter as I don't swap phones and I got a 64GB Turbo, be careful with that 'water resistant' not -proof body, and removable battery is trivial with turbo charging capabilities plus the proliferation of good portable battery packs."

droidturbo,3b5ipn,imsoupercereal,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't had camera issues, but I also have realistic expectations of a phone camera vs my SLR.  Do you keep phones for 2 or more years?  I'd suspect not if you're caught up in this Lollipop upgrade madness.  Because by the time the phone degrades to the point of needing a battery, you likely won't be using it, which makes this a moot point.  Besides that, the battery is still serviceable.  The main advocation for removable batteries was when smartphone battery life was much poorer so you could have multiple batteries to get you through the day if you needed.  Basically, you're saying that a service that might need to be done after 2-4 years mandates a feature that you can access every day, and makes the phone design more complex.  I've had phones with removable backs, and phones without.  I don't miss the removable back."

Your phone is still signed into the cell tower even when you're connected to WiFi - it's just the IP networking data that goes over WiFi. The cell radio is still on and is still getting alerts for voice mail notifications and incoming calls.   You don't need to have a cell data connection, but you do need to have a cell connection."
droidturbo,3b4qgg,antiduh,2,Fri Jun 26 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"He's saying you do need a data connection for the voice mail notification, which I find believable.  Maybe Verizon just sends a standard push notification like any other app when the voicemail is left.  I don't really know, but it sounds plausible.  Either way I haven't had any issues using the Basic visual voicemail.  I only get a handful of voicemails per month anyways, and half of them are from my dad ""hey it's your dad, call me back""."

If I have cell data connection turned off and am on WIFI, I receive no voice mail notification for new voice mail waiting. If I open voice mail by icon and click on refresh it will say I have no new voice mails. If I then turn on cell data connection, the voice mail will become visible and I can access it.

Here's the detailed desc. just for the Ballistic Nylon Model for those interested.  -Ballistic Nylon. This version holds to the Air Dock fairly well. The back of the phone is not smooth, so the entire hold is from the magnets in the Air Dock. The magnets only make for a decent hold. Because the back cover of this phone is so textured, the magnetic sticker provided with each Air Dock won't stick to it. It isn't possible to use the magnetic sticker to increase the holding power of the Air Dock on this phone. We highly recommend that this phone be used inside a glossy case. If you intend to use your Droid Turbo on the Air Dock with a case, the case will need to have a flat glossy back, and be 2 mm thick or less, and made of plastic. The use of the magnetic sticker (provided with each Air Dock) may be necessary if the case used is not glossy. The sticker is placed on the outside of the case to make it more glossy and allow better attachment to the Air Dock.  The Droid Turbo is meant to be used on the universal version of the Air Dock. - See more at: http://www.theairdock.com/pages/droid-turbo#sthash.7MikaAlh.dpuf"

Lollipop literally ruined my phone. It made it run slow, lag, sometimes the keyboard doesn't pop up when it's supposed to, my lock screen shows a bunch of weird symbols all the time where the normal numbers for the pin is supposed to be. My battery life also got cut in half (approximately... it's awful now).  It basically turned it into a phone full of the same sort of reasons I ditched iPhones a few years back in the first place...  If we skip lollipop altogether I consider that a win."
droidturbo,3atnsi,Sletts,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"1) The S5 doesn't have 5.1, which is much more smooth and stable than 5.0.  2) Your problems sound like you got a bad upgrade (which is annoyingly common on Android). If those problems were happening to everyone on the S5, it'd be all over /r/Android. Lag and battery issues after an upgrade are fairly common and almost always fixed by a factory reset, and the PIN issues sound like a glitch (which again should be fixed by a reset).  If you're ditching the S5 anyways, then that might not matter, but it's worth keeping in mind that if you run into that sort of problem in the future then you should try a factory reset before giving up on the phone."

(I'm using a 2560x1440 monitor.) http://i.imgur.com/Og0RaQn.png http://i.imgur.com/Wkie68N.png  The fact that the background is vertically centered means that it's incorrectly offset on any window that's not 1080 pixels tall. Shorter windows will lose the kevlar texture, and taller ones have white text on a white background at the top of the page: http://i.imgur.com/7BkvXR4.png The background should be aligned with the top of the page (e.g. ""no-repeat fixed top center"" instead of ""no-repeat fixed center center"").  Personally, I think the giant image of the Turbo in the background is pretty distracting and doesn't contribute too much. It might make more sense to put it in the header or the footer, and then do a kevlar pattern in the header that then scrolls down to a solid grey. If you keep a dark background, you should also make sure that the comments are themed to match it -- right now, the white comments with slices of the dark background between them are really jarring."

droidturbo,3abgl2,Wood_Wine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"Because the current root method for the Turbo does not disable write protection for the system. We still have access to full system writing when creating images, just can't do it on the fly. So it's not ""true"" root.   Pretty much means we can modify the stock system image to our liking, but we can't flash other AOSP roms.   For example, you can't install xposed or adblock apks, but we can flash a system image that already includes them.  Hope that makes sense..."
droidturbo,3abgl2,hitemp,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:50:23 2015 UTC,I've never rooted really. The one time I did I had someone else do it... And they removed Google Play Services. And basically bricked. I'm afraid to root it in fear I'll mess something up.  Do I need to root? I currently use Smart Launcher instead of Google Launcher
droidturbo,3abgl2,Wood_Wine,3,Sat Jun 20 01:02:34 2015 UTC,"No, you absolutely do not need to root.  I feel like people often start the root discussion with ""Well tell me why I should root?"". It's more of a thing that you should look into on your own, and most of the time it happens naturally.   Root gives you more control over things that most people would find unnecessary. And you will mess stuff up, maybe a lot of stuff if you enjoy tinkering. The thing is, you can fix all the stuff that you mess up, and learn a lot in the process.  Does that sound interesting to you? If so, maybe check it out.  Maybe this example will help:  Some people are in to cars. Some of these people are also wealthy. They could easily afford to go to a dealer or mechanic and pay for new spark plugs and wires or an oil change. Instead, they do the work themselves. They go to the auto parts store, get greasy hands, deal with the disposal of their old oil, then go back to the auto parts store because they fucked something else up in the process.  To some people this sounds incredibly stupid, but they do it because they enjoy working on their car, and the same can be said for a smartphone.  It's not hard, but there is a lot to learn in the beginning.   Some people aren't even into their phones, but they root just so they can block adds or get wireless tethering on their unlimited plans.  IDK man, take that for what it's worth. Either way I am happy to help with any other questions :)"
droidturbo,3abgl2,hitemp,2,Sat Jun 20 01:37:33 2015 UTC,"That definitely helped me out. :-) I am not really one to tinker around. I like learning but don't see rooting at something I need now. I barely use my data, and I have WiFi access at home. No need to tether. For blocking ads, that's why I use Firefox mobile and ABE. I don't care about ads in apps though.  What I hate most is when people push rooting down my throat. Like, I said I don't want to root, but every week they are all ""oh man but you can do anything"". If I want to root, I'd ask first, like I did in this thread. Thank you for taking the time to answer"
droidturbo,3abgl2,hitemp,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:36:28 2015 UTC,Another question. Why do you half root? What do you get out of it if we can't fully root our phones yet?
droidturbo,3abgl2,Wood_Wine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I just really enjoy flashing my phone with new roms. I did change my system dpi to 491, which makes everything a bit smaller, and I love customizing with xposed.  Really for me it's the process more than anything, I don't know that I can explain it more than that...  It's not really half-root , I just kind of put that as a joke. But we don't have the same privileges as a fully rooted phone. I don't know what the official term would be but this post explains the current Turbo root condition.  I enjoy checking the forums to see when a dev has updated his image... Often the changes aren't even noticeable on my end, but I enjoy flashing the new version anyway.

droidturbo,3a9vsk,imsoupercereal,5,Thu Jun 18 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"One person left this comment in his review:   It works, but... Only because the user is told to manually disable location and sync. I decompiled the apk and checked. It does nothing else.   And in another review:   Artfully constructed to do nothing but collect ad revenue and trick the user into rebooting their phone, but does nothing malevolent that would kick them off Play Store. Rebooting your phone helps temporarily, which tricks people into positive reviews. Uses review site echo chamber to leverage good reviews. Telltale signs: they don't actually tell you what the app does, and screeenshots don't show double ad bars. Desperate people try the app given mostly good reviews and no real alternatives. Google is the real responsible party, for not fixing the problem, and then allowing the app to flourish. Makes me want to defect to iOS.   Do you have any evidence this app does anything? Or are you blindly recommending that people run it based on what may be nothing more than placebo or coincidence?"
droidturbo,3a9vsk,mistrbrownstone,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"It's not placebo or coincidence that both my phones were running 30-40% battery for Google Play Services, even after restarts, even after disabling those things manually, and that afterwards Play Services was typically 10-15%, and the phone was running much cooler.  I turned locations back on with high accuracy, and I run plenty of other hungry things like Google Now with no additional problems.  Personally, I think some apps get stuck in some kind of loop asking for location, etc way more than they should.  Maybe something different happens at the application layer that isn't exposed at the user layer when location, etc is turned off and on again.  I have 0 affiliation with the app.  I tried all the other things short of a full restore that people talk about on forums, etc with no luck.  I'm pretty sure on the G2 I even did a full restore only to have it returned to the state.  This fixed the issue for me, so take what you want from me, or random app store reviewers.  Yes, it's Google's problem to fix, but in the mean time I'd rather have a usable phone than a pocket warmer."

Yes, the price was lower ($30 on Cricket vs my now $45 Verizon Prepaid post-paid VZW before was far more). And AT&T service on that was fine. T-Mobile was useless though didn't work in buildings, and a little bit out of town zero service.  I did really like my Nexus 5 though, but come Lollipop it was basically a unusable mess. My battery life went from nearly all day to recharging 2 or 3 times a day. The phone had to be rebooted multiple times a week because of a persistent memory leak issue, which Google refused to acknowledge or patch quickly even though developers narrowed it down.  Texts and phone calls stopped working because of another little bug that cropped up in one of the OTAs Google pushed out and weren't fixed till a day or so later. All of this was while my Father was super sick in the Hospital and I needed reliable phone service, hence dropping it and going back to a Verizon phone that worked.  All of these issues were fixed slowly over a period of months. If that's acceptable for you then by all means drop Verizon, and grab a Nexus device. But things aren't always rosy. After quite a long time of feeling how much of you feel about delayed updates on phones thanks to Verizon, I'm now very happy their review process takes so long, as long as the end product is stable."

You knew that an official release date for 5.X hadn't been announced. You knew there had not been a soak test for 5.X, nor had a soak test been announced.

Android Auto only runs on 5.x. Since my Droid Razr Maxx was so awesome and Droid Turbo was suppose to be getting 5 last week. Why not get another droid. So I did last week. Don't get me wrong. I like the device it's a great overall phone if you're happy running 4.4 and don't care about lollipop. But I want to run lollipop so I can run my Android Auto that I paid for.  And no lollipop release date plus the Verizon games is making me think I might as well get a device that HAS lollipop already.

Apparently Facebook also changed their API rules so there seems to be some additional security measures for peoples' profiles that can keep their info safe from third parties.  It grabbed most people, but missed a few for some reason (my guess is a privacy setting on their end).  Also, great to hear the phone is pretty good.  Came to this sub and saw a lot of people upset with the phone / lack of 5.0 update and got a bit worried, but it's been doing great for me so far; only had issues with the Facebook thing and the ""ME"" contact syncing with my google+ photo.  Thanks again!"

droidturbo,3a25re,mlw4428,27,Tue Jun 16 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's not just the update, it's the principle of it. Every other major flagship has 5.0 or 5.1 already, and a lot of phones from a few years ago (e.g. Galaxy S4) have also had it for a while. When we buy a top-of-the-line phone, it's really frustrating to see all of the other companies pushing updates quicker, and Motorola pushing updates to all of their older and lower-end phones before us.  One of the things that I think is contributing the most to the frustration in this sub is that Motorola's never said anything besides ""it's coming soon"". In October, this meant November or December, and since early this year it's been ""literally any time"". Combined with the constant rumors that we're about to get it, everyone who's excited for the update keeps getting hyped up and then quickly disappointed, which contributes a lot to our frustration. If Motorola had more transparency and kept us updated on the status of the update (like HTC does: http://www.htc.com/us/go/htc-software-updates/) then I don't expect people would be nearly as angry."
droidturbo,3a25re,pr0grammer,-31,Tue Jun 16 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"I bought this phone for the features it had at the time of launch. Not for what it might be able to do in the future.  If I thought like you, every phone I ever owned would be shit, including my Nexus One."
droidturbo,3a25re,pr0grammer,13,Tue Jun 16 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"It's far from a bad phone, but I feel like if you buy a flagship phone, it's reasonable to expect reasonably timely updates for at least a couple years, and almost every phone provides that. (For comparison on the other side of the fence, the iPhone 4S is going to be getting at least five years of day-one updates.)  Not getting the update doesn't make the phone any worse, but we're watching other phones get better while ours is stagnant, so for someone who cares about Lollipop, the Turbo isn't as good compared to its competition as it was when it was released. If you don't see any benefit to Lollipop then it's a moot point for you, but there are a lot of people who would really appreciate the new features, and it stings to see every other phone getting them while we just keep waiting without any substantial communication from Motorola on when we might get the update."
droidturbo,3a25re,beertastic,10,Tue Jun 16 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"That's not true, one of the main reasons I bought this phone was it was believed by practically everyone on the internet that it would be receiving lollipop by the end of 2014.  I buy flagship phones because I want the latest and greatest.  If I wanted old tech I'd buy an old phone."
droidturbo,3a25re,Flowah,18,Tue Jun 16 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"If you want to leave Verizon because they haven't done what they haven't promised then do so.

droidturbo,3a25re,Flowah,9,Tue Jun 16 18:38:24 2015 UTC,It is always astounding to me how people can feel that they need to defend mega corporations' feelings. All while not being paid to do so. It's like some kinda variation of Stockholm Syndrome + fanboyism + utter stupidity.
droidturbo,3a25re,cbass717,25,Tue Jun 16 18:46:23 2015 UTC,You weren’t promised any updates   Motoralla made a press release back in Nov/Dec saying the Turbo would receive Lollipop before 2015.

droidturbo,3a25re,terroh8er,8,Tue Jun 16 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"Even if there was never a firm definition of Motorola's ""Soon(TM)"", it's an industry standard that flagships get updated in a timely manner, especially ahead of older models. Seeing the Moto E get 5.1(and lollipop in general for that matter) ahead of us is like Samsung updating the Galaxy S4 ahead of the S6. It's ridiculous to pay for a top tier device and be treated lower than Motorola's budget phones.   Motorola has lost my business for my next upgrade."
droidturbo,3a25re,upnorthbubba,7,Tue Jun 16 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"You weren't promised any updates.   The Turbo, stock was a pretty good device.  After each of the updates, the experience has gotten progressively worse with more bugs, slower response, and worse battery life (tested on two stock devices with no apps installed).  For a $600+ phone (plus the $2400 in cell phone bills over two years), I'd expect to at least see some bug fixes to address the big system issues - battery, wifi, capacitive buttons wonky, home screen bug, etc., instead of Motorola waiting to bundle them all in one large fix that's now 7 months delayed.     Down vote me now   Since you asked...."
droidturbo,3a25re,MilitantNarwhal,5,Tue Jun 16 18:26:44 2015 UTC,If OP doesn't think that Google requires manufacturers to update the OS for 18 months to get Google play services available.   So Motorola AND Verizon should have updated the OS by now.
droidturbo,3a25re,upnorthbubba,5,Wed Jun 17 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"People pay a lot of money to get the latest and greatest and have every right to be upset when they don't get it.

Try rebooting your phone, then charging to full to see if Google Play Services is still using a high percentage after the reboot. As I've learned while helping /u/jamaall, location services might be causing your Google Play Services to run constantly. It could also be a result of using Google Fit, but I personally don't know as I don't use it.  If it continues to show up, clear your cache partition in recovery.

droidturbo,39vt04,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:03:26 2015 UTC,I didn't do that but I just didn't because it seemed like it had worked. Today it drained from full to 20% from 8 am to 1pm.

droidturbo,39vt04,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Charging to full will clear out the battery page so you can accurately determine whether or not any remedies performed worked. If you don't charge to full, Google Play Services will continue to be listed, but charging to full will clear everything out and if it pops back up, then you know it didn't work. Otherwise you have to make note of the CPU, keep awake and total times to see if they've increased.  Also, do you use Google Fit? Or is it just showing up without you using it?"
droidturbo,39vt04,iiWoodstocK,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:09:02 2015 UTC,So I charged to full and play services is still at the top. I do use fit but its lower then yesterday.

droidturbo,39vt04,Bathroomdestroyer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:35:48 2015 UTC,It's possible that your Google Play Services drain is being caused by Fit. I unfortunately don't have any other suggestions.

In an added note: Google Maps no longer crashes on launch and is actually usable again!  Also, I had already tried rebooting phone, clearing cache partition, uninstalling Android Wear.

droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,7,Sat Jun 13 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"ART, because it brings ahead-of-time compilation.   Apps are compiled down to java bytecode. When you install the app to you phone, the bytecode has to eventually be compiled down to native machine code so it can be run on the CPU.  On every version of Android previous to L, this happened when you launched the app - just in time compilation.   JIT works, but it sucks. Because you're doing the compilation when you're launching the app, you can't take too long to do it, or the app launches slowly. Since you don't have too much time to do it, the app is missing all but the easiest optimizations. It slows down startup, eats CPU doing throwaway work, and makes apps run slower. All of this means more lag and less battery time.  ART brings AOT. It performs the compilation, only once, when you install the app. Now you can spend a bunch of time doing the optimizations, you're not doing them while waiting for the app to launch, and you're not doing them every time the app launches. Faster, more responsive, less battery. Everybody wins.  I can't wait for L because I really want ART."

Why in the word wouldn't it be compiled to begin with? Are Java based programs on desktops not compiled ahead of time? I thought compiling happened before a program was shipped.   From your description it sounds like it is compiled on the machine no matter what because of difference in the machine OS's? I guess I need to go learn java, I don't like not understanding something like that."
droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,2,Mon Jun 15 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"From your description it sounds like it is compiled on the machine no matter what because of difference in the machine OS's?   Not only the OS, but more importantly the machine.   Java: write once, run anywhere. C# is the same basic idea. As a developer, I can compile one executable, one library, and have it run on every machine that Java has been ported to.   How many different cpu architectures are there for smartphones? Servers? Desktops? Java runs on all of them, and I only need to compile my app once. x86, x86-64, arm, sparc, mips, alpha, itanium, and not to mention all of the Isa variations in between (mmx , sse, etc).   The Java runtime can add support for each of these architecture and extensions, and now my program will automatically get vectorization optimizations on a cpu that supports it. And I don't even need to recompile my program.   This is an awesome strength, but it comes at a cost. The cost is that building a runtime that can do ahead of time compilation is incredibly complicated. Both Java and C# are starting to see support for this, but this is only after these languages have been around for a very long time."
droidturbo,39mrpj,antiduh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:20:28 2015 UTC,This is interesting.   I can't say I quite understand the benefits of this over dynamically typed languages. Is it more efficient? Or does it more so just allow for more in depth applications without needing to take CPU architecture into mind?
droidturbo,39mrpj,pr0grammer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Dynamically-typed languages don't tend to be fast; though, that's often not a goal for such languages, and not all dynamicly typed or otherwise dynamic languages are terribly slow.   One reason is that dynamic method dispatch requires more overhead - for every function/method call on an object, you have to do a bunch of lookups to find out if that function is defined at all, and what address to call to dispatch that function call. Compare that to just dumping a literal raw instruction that says ""call the function at address 1234"". No lookups, the CPU can do better superscalar execution, less code size so better CPU cache performance, etc.   Dynamic languages tend to give you more flexibility, but tend to have higher performance costs. Whether or not that matters depends on your goals.  It's been a while since I've played with it, but iirc, python allows you to add methods to objects at runtime; so I could have two concrete instances of a Person object, but one of those objects has a method Immortalize() while the other doesn't. I really don't like this idea because I tend to concern myself with long-term concerns of software development; most of what I work on lasts a long time and tends to be very large. I'm sure my opinion might be unpopular, but I'm not a huge fan of maintaining large, long-running software development projects that use dynamically-typed or otherwise-dynamic languages.  I do most of my work in C#; while I know a bunch about Java, I'm actually not a huge fan of it, for many reasons, but for one big reason: how they implemented generics, which takes a page from dynamic languages.  Generics allow you to build statically-typed objects that take a type parameter; a List<T> class is probably the most common example - it could be a List of ints, or a List of strings, etc. In C#, when I instantiate such a class, I'll get a List<int> that underneath the hood has a int[] array to store its elements. That's important, because an array of ints has all ints packed together sequentially in memory, which means that iterating over that list (especially if it's long) will go faster because the elements are all co-located in ram, reducing paging demands and cache demands on the CPU. C# will create a special version of List<T> for each way its used - ints, doubles, strings, whatever. All of the reference-type versions can use the same underlying code because its really just storing a pointer which will always be the same size. But the value-type versions - List<int>, List<double> all need special code - because, for instance, the size of a int versus a double is very different, and so now the math that the compiler has to insert to jump to the next element in the list is different. In the reference-type case, the math is the same because all pointers to any object are all the same, 4 bytes on 32-bit computers and 8 bytes on 64-bit computers.   C#'s compiler went through the trouble of all this. They implemented reified generics. The type parameter information for the class is preserved in the byte-code form of the class, which means that if I publish that code as a library, any user of that library will be able to complete the compilation for their particular type parameter and get the fully-defined behavior.  In Java, they implemented generics using type erasure. Everywhere where the 'T' variable is used, they replace it with object. This means that it generic classes in libraries can't be distinguished from non-generic classes as far as the compiler is concerned, and so when you use them, then compiler has to treat it the variables as objects - meaning it has to insert run-time type checks everywhere for you. This sucks.  Even worse, because they use type erasure and store everything as an object, value types have to be boxed. This now means that for a List<int> that's 1 million elements long, I have an array of one million pointers pointing to one million objects that each store one int. It's a huge waste, and it's awful on performance. Those objects could be allocated all over memory, and to get to them, I have to read through a pointer. It may easily double or triple the amount of memory you need, and it will be horrible on the CPU data cache and page-table cache (TLB). If they're scattered, then I may read one value, then the next would be in a completely different page and so I have to evict a page table cache entry, and then read the next value, which might be in a completely different page.. it could turn into a page fault per item, which absolutely destroys performance.  So here's one example where Java has a more.. dynamic language kind of behavior, and it turned out to be terrible for performance."

It hangs for everything. And forget multitasking. Memory leak is real.   I'm hoping 5.1 cleans it all up. It's nice to have lollipop but not at the cost of functionality. Glad the Turbo is skipping 5.0. Wish they would hurry, sure...but its not nearly as big a deal as releasing unfinished software."
droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,4,Fri Jun 12 22:39:51 2015 UTC,The S5 was like that on kitkat too.  It's a major criticism of touchwiz in general.  Not sure if lollipop makes it worse or not.

It would be awesome to have it. But not at the expense of new bugs for something that won't feel shiny in a few weeks or so regardless.
droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,3,Mon Jun 15 01:43:22 2015 UTC,I just switched from the Moto X 2014 Pure to the Turbo because I had to switch from AT&T to Verizon when I moved to a new town a few weeks ago.  Lollipop was terrible on it.  It's been so refreshing to go back to having a phone that doesn't have to redraw everything anytime I go back to my home screen and isn't laggy as hell.

droidturbo,39mrpj,Rojo623,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"Now there's all notifications, priority, and none. Priority will just allow notifications from specified contacts.  None just blocks all so it's similiar to silent mode, but it also keeps alarms silenced.  What bugged me is that I used Moto Assist to keep my phone silenced during meetings at work completely but then allow alarms and calls from my family during sleeping hours.  With lollipop, Moto Assist can only put it in priority mode so it wouldn't have the separate settings for the two time periods.  Not a big deal, but I never got why they thought they had to change it in the first place."

droidturbo,39mrpj,Rodeeo,5,Sat Jun 13 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"Seriously? How many people have nothing better do with their lives than cry about an OS update?  The whole reason it is taking so long in the first place was because 5.0.x caused issues. And now they're just running tests to make sure all is peachy under stree with 5.1.  You'd be bitching about the problems you had if they released it too soon.  I'd rather have a well operating phone, than the latest OS - because it's hardly worth calling it a latest public OS release if the shit doesn't work."

droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,3,Fri Jun 12 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure 5.0.x caused issues with the phone.  As long as it's been there's no reason these issues shouldn't be sorted out by now, except from lack of committed resources.  In other words, priorities lie elsewhere.  Which is why people are so upset after paying as much as any other flasgship on the market."
droidturbo,39mrpj,whatdc,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"In other words, priorities lie elsewhere.   That's a definitely a valid thought. But it's a potentially tough assumption.  For example, 5.0 might be such a turd that they decided to skip it and let the main issues resolve themselves in 5.1, instead of deviating their code from the standard.  Now, maybe not all the bugs they hoped would be fixed are fixed in 5.1, so they've got a little bit of work to do. Then, they want to put it through some solid tests to make sure it all works very well.   Maybe they're just assholes. But either way, it's tough to really assume.  FWIW, from some other comments I've seen, the other flagships that have 5.0.x aren't working as well as they could be. So those guys don't have it sorted either."
droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,3,Sat Jun 13 05:01:31 2015 UTC,"Every release has bugs, it is just a part of software development. The current 4.4 Kit Kat software sucks with wifi. Moto stated that they had submitted the 5.0.2 to carriers, those outside the US pushed it and I haven't heard any complaints so far.   Verizon put the priority on VoLTE and decided to skip 5.0.2 because it was going to be baked into 5.1. That being said the lack of transparency and acknowledgement of the lack of an update in a timely manner rather sucks for us those of us who bought the device expecting timely updates.   We have every right to complain just as you have every right to not update you device. Don't judge others by their priorities."
droidturbo,39mrpj,timworx,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"You bet I'll update my device when it comes out!   I'm just a bit more understanding of the process (assuming it's user-experience quality based and not marketing based - in that case, fuck them.) I like that brand I purchase from is willing to take flack for making sure they're providing a quality experience. Rather than pandering to a need to just have the latest stuff out - whether the latest is any good or not, but just for the sake of something new.  I think what bothers me more about it is that in a few weeks or months it's just going to feel like your same old smartphone again. That doesn't mean it won't have some great additions, don't get me wrong. But once most users get used to 5.1, they probably feel about the same as they did when their phone was running 4.4. And all this ""excitement"", the idea that a class action lawsuit was once a valid solution, will seem embarrassingly trivial. I mean, I really have to think /u/f_8 was just kidding anyways. But the fact that anyone bothered to reply in the comment chain is making me wonder.  It's just that consumerist - gottahavethelatest! mentality that irks me. Because once you have the latest it's all the same shit. So you might as well wait till that turd is nice and polished, rather than getting it now and causing more headaches then joy.  I get the excitement over it. I would like lollipop, I would. It seems like a neat update and will bring some good stuff. But I'd be a lot more pissed if I got it and it messed with my battery or something else that worked fine previously.   With all that said, to each their own.  But, a class action lawsuit for not getting an OS update when you want it when they're just trying to work shit and make sure it's all as reliable as it should be, not introducing bug?

Personally I thought my iPhone 5 and the Moto X I had for awhile sounded much better.  Enough to notice.    I listen on Sony mdr-v6 for headphones.  Why not bring your headphones into the store?

I came to the Turbo from a Note 2, which I absolutely loved, size and all. I was strongly considering the Nexus 6 (not too deterred by the size but still wanting to hold one first), but since there was no word about it arriving on Verizon at the time (very late November) I went ahead and got the Turbo, fully expecting Lollipop relatively soon. Of course, no dice, and now the Nexus 6 has been available from Verizon for three months. So still love the phone, but definitely some second guessing. And whenever we get Lollipop, Android M will be at least right around the corner and the Turbo will be behind the latest yet again."

droidturbo,39h1mf,GGKoul,2,Fri Jun 12 03:50:41 2015 UTC,"Android Auto:       Android Auto is a telematics standard developed by Google to allow mobile devices running the Android operating system (version 5.0 ""Lollipop"" and later) to be operated in automobiles through the dashboard's head unit. Android Auto was announced on June 25, 2014, at Google I/O 2014. The Android Auto mobile app was released on March 19, 2015.  The standard offers drivers control over GPS mapping/navigation, music playback, SMS, telephony, and web search; both touchscreen and button-controlled head unit displays will be supported, although hands-free operation through voice commands is emphasized to ensure safe driving. Compatible apps include Google Maps, Google Play Music, MLB at Bat, Spotify, Songza, Stitcher, iHeart Radio, and TuneIn.  Android Auto is part of the Open Automotive Alliance, which was announced on January 6, 2014, and is a joint effort with 28 automobile manufacturers and mobile tech supplier Nvidia. In May 2015, Hyundai became the first manufacturer to offer Android Auto, making it available first in the 2015 Hyundai Sonata. Customers may update their current 2015 Sonata at a dealership or via self-service starting June 16, 2015.

droidturbo,39h1mf,raymondspogo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. To the standard user, it's useless. When a camera captures an image and saves it as a jpeg it processes the data from the sensor and applies color processing unique to the software and then is compressed into the right format. A RAW file is what comes straight from the sensor, uncompressed and unmodified, and also unreadable natively by most software. They are already heavily used by photographers and allow magnitudes more leeway in editing photos. As to how much we'll be able to do with the Turbo's camera, I'm not sure.

Motorola told us to expect a jump straight from KitKat to Android 5.1. Has something changed? Sources of ours yesterday actually told us that the update that has been approved is Android 5.0.2, not 5.1. We haven’t been able to receive a second confirmation on that, so expect one or the other, just don’t be shocked if it ends up being 5.0.2.   Wtf??"

droidturbo,39gcas,mistrbrownstone,4,Thu Jun 11 15:24:15 2015 UTC,I thought the whole point in waiting for 5.1 was that 5.0.X builds didn't support VoLTE.
droidturbo,39gcas,miketoasty,3,Thu Jun 11 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"They could have patched it in just like 4.4.4. No one really knows for sure right now though, and an update hasn't been pushed yet."

droidturbo,39gcas,mrlightyear22,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"You have to remember 5.1 wasn't released until March, which meant before it was released Motorola was patching 5.0.x to fix the issues that arose. There may have been bugs in the 5.1 build that couldn't be resolved and with Motorola I'm sure getting hate from every direction would probably rather just push out a more stable build of Lollipop at this point than keep people waiting.  Just my speculation though, could be something completely different."

droidturbo,39dqpi,jamaall,2,Fri Jun 12 01:03:34 2015 UTC,Bought mine on launch day. Went to a Verizon Authorized Dealer near me and asked if they had the Turbo in stock. They looked at me like I was stupid. I pointed at the poster they had and they said they hadn't even heard of it. One employee knew about it and said her husband was trying to choose between the Turbo and Note and that I could find them in stock at the Verizon Store 15 minutes away.   Picked this puppy up day one and immediately loved it. That display was so crisp. I am a patient person but this update is starting to get frustrating considering the money spent on the device; you'd figure we would be a priority. Better stable than ever I suppose.
droidturbo,39dqpi,baneoficarus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:57:28 2015 UTC,That's surprising.  I bought mine maybe 2 weeks after launch and the employees were practically shoving it down the throats of every customer in the store.
droidturbo,39dqpi,beertastic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:28:45 2015 UTC,The people at the Verizon store knew EXACTLY what I was talking about and got me set up quick since I knew exactly what I wanted walking in. That was day one of the Turbo and I gave them no chance to sell me on anything anyway so it is possible that they were upselling the Turbo that day.
droidturbo,39dqpi,baneoficarus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:41:49 2015 UTC,"I work for a premium retailer, not gonna say which one but I'll say we are one of what Verizon considers the big 6, when the turbo launched everyone and their mother had a special edge upgrade to the droid turbo and we had 10 in stock. I bought my wife and I turbos on that same upgrade. We were forcing it down because Verizon literally set us up to make a killing on the device.  I told people a lot of things that I thought were true like the fact that lolipop was literally right around the corner and that this would be one of the first phones to get it seeing as how it is Motorola they are usually very quick to update. I am disappointed that we still have yet to receive lolipop and every phone I sell everyday has lolipop... It's sad.  TLDR,  Work at vzw retailer. Everyone had turbo upgrade. I'm sad."
droidturbo,39dqpi,acallis1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:28:07 2015 UTC,"I picked it up in February, as soon as I possibly could, because of said assumptions and hopes and dreams lol   Previously I had the note 2,which I had rooted and was on lollipop as soon as a rom was made for it, like several months before... I was addicted to flashing roms and had them on the note since day 1 for two years. My work decided to not allow rooted phones access to email so I  had to pick the most likely phone on Verizon that I thought would be updated and have good hardware."
droidturbo,39dqpi,clt829,3,Thu Jun 11 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not disappointed in KK either; it works great! But so did my LG G2 and my Galaxy S3 before that. I just happen to like being on the leading edge of tech, and I hoped the Turbo would be that for me. If I at least had an unlocked bootloader, I could be happy swapping ROMs every other week, but I can't.  I'm sure 5.1 will drop soon, and I appreciate not slogging through the mess that seems to have been 5.0/.01/.02 etc., but waiting so long on a flagship phone is frustrating."

droidturbo,398bm7,mobilehavoc,6,Wed Jun 10 01:26:28 2015 UTC,This is not happening today. Either there would have been a soak test or VZ would post some sort of update that there was an update. Neither has happened so don't think we'll see anything today.

droidturbo,398bm7,jenkag,3,Wed Jun 10 14:05:41 2015 UTC,It does seem aggressive to go straight to OTA for something as big as a major OS update.
droidturbo,398bm7,mrbig012,3,Wed Jun 10 14:08:25 2015 UTC,I've read Verizon has had it on 2000 devices internally being tested. Maybe they went that route instead of a soak.
droidturbo,398bm7,cj250mills,2,Wed Jun 10 14:36:43 2015 UTC,It does. Someone else mentioned they may have done quite a bit of internal testing since so many vzw employees are stuck on the turbo
droidturbo,398bm7,mobilehavoc,2,Wed Jun 10 14:20:36 2015 UTC,Fair enough but there would still be some announcement. VZ is good about getting the word out when there's an update.
droidturbo,398bm7,Fuh_King,3,Wed Jun 10 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"Will there be any issues with ota updating 4.4, rooted with moforoot? Would that cause any trouble?"
droidturbo,398bm7,DeadRinga,6,Wed Jun 10 03:05:42 2015 UTC,normally OTA upgrading while rooted causes bootloops. If you can unroot it somehow with moforoot that would be ideal. Did anyone ever release full factory images for the turbo to flash back to stock with?
droidturbo,398bm7,auralucario2,3,Wed Jun 10 03:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are stock system images floating around on XDA that you can flash. If it does come today, I'll be doing a factory reset as well just to make sure the update doesn't cause problems."
droidturbo,398bm7,pr0grammer,2,Wed Jun 10 10:48:47 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely that you'll be able to take the update at all. If it gives you the option, I strongly recommend not taking it for now, since it might break things. Most likely, you'll have to revert back to a 100% stock system image (in general, updates won't install if the system partition is different from stock). There should be procedures for upgrading from a rooted system posted on XDA soon after the update, but I wouldn't expect to be able to take the update tomorrow."
droidturbo,398bm7,DM003,3,Wed Jun 10 04:21:14 2015 UTC,"Are the chances still the same as any other upgrade that there may be a rather large bug in this OTA? Or does 5.1 have safer odds?   And is there a method to downgrade to the (so far, pretty solid) kit kat firmware if we upgrade ""tomorrow""?"
droidturbo,398bm7,homelesspieceofshit,6,Wed Jun 10 05:24:38 2015 UTC,The idea of waiting so long was that it was supposed to be relatively bugless. If its fucking borked its time to get out our pitchforks.

It semi-recognized the device and showed three steps of progress (""step 3 - profit!"") but was still whirring away when explorer popped a box asking what action to take. So I got there in the end. Thank you for posting the link; I may need to go back there again to try to get my own desktop to work."
droidturbo,399x45,antiduh,2,Wed Jun 10 18:33:00 2015 UTC,I just use Airdroid (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid). MTP has never worked right for me.
droidturbo,399x45,_Aardvark,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:01:50 2015 UTC,"I had given up on USB. It's a shame, because there's no reason why USB can't do something more sophisticated - when you boil it down, USB is just another network protocol and physical layer, not much different than IPv4 and Ethernet. There's no reason why something like NFS couldn't be run over USB, and now every operating system could mount the share like a normal drive letter or mount point and standard sync tools would apply as normal. Instead, MTP half-assed this, required that files only be written-in-whole, and added a bunch of content aware shenanigans (like transcoding media that's not supported by the device). It's a shame, and obviously a stop-gap to get off of the flawed multi-master problem with mass storage. They really need to do something better, but that'll probably never happen now.  Instead, I've taken to working from within the device. If you want direct access, I've been using samba servers or ssh servers to mount the device over wireless. For syncing my music, I've taken to using BTSync or Sycnthing to do it automatically, though neither of those are a perfect fit yet."

droidturbo,397q4m,mattthemobile,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:49:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. I love the new camera update
droidturbo,397q4m,jamaall,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:04:05 2015 UTC,When did the update arrive?  Version# 5.0.21.4?
droidturbo,397q4m,mattthemobile,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:42:51 2015 UTC,It was when they added adjustable exposure I believe. That was about a week or two ago.
droidturbo,397q4m,mattthemobile,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"Right, just making sure I had the camera that looks ""A LOT"" better."
droidturbo,397q4m,SergeTheVerge,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:47:29 2015 UTC,Yup. Here's a comparison shot from a week ago I have a before from a block away  http://imgur.com/930R3X4
