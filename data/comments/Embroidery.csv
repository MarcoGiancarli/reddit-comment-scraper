Embroidery,3dwx6n,MundiMori,2,Mon Jul 20 11:23:07 2015 UTC,Besides the beard that part took the longest! I basically stitched in a way that it slightly overlapped on an angle. I'll post a closeup of the hat to get a better idea
Embroidery,3dwx6n,MundiMori,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"Please! I love the fullness and different textures in this (I actually parred down my question, which originally made guesses at French knots for the beard and velvet tufting for the shirt. Am I close?)"
Embroidery,3dwx6n,MundiMori,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:41 2015 UTC,French knots for the Beard! And for the shirt I just did layered stitching! I'll see if I can find a closeup of the shirt but I did add a closeup of the hat in the album! Do you embroider?

Embroidery,3duszq,hazillius,6,Sun Jul 19 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really working. When I think of shock at least, I don't think of sagging shapes. I think tightening them up to stick straight out, using knots, or shorter beads would be more effective. The placement is also a bit random and not in the ""on purpose random"" way."
Embroidery,3duszq,araradia,2,Sun Jul 19 20:55:29 2015 UTC,Yes I thought that about the sagging too. Looks more like disappointment.  It just put them as I was going so how would you randomise them more effectively?
Embroidery,3duszq,araradia,3,Sun Jul 19 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Maybe take some paint with a paint brush and flick it with your finger on some paper and get inspired by that splatter? It's a random splatter, but it is more controlled and realistic. I hope that makes sense."
Embroidery,3duszq,Kaydince,5,Sun Jul 19 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"I think what your missing is that shock comes from a sudden change. If you had a consistent pattern then deviated from it you might be more successful.   Thinking about it more if you had a single line that dropped or ascended sharply, or became jagged, that might convey shock."

Embroidery,3dnqro,SesuRescue,3,Fri Jul 17 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"I personally like a piece that has a few ""mistakes"" here and there, it gives it character and shows that someone worked on it instead of it being fed into a machine."

Interfacing goes inside clothes and breaks when you stitch over it whereas stabiliser is usually more meshed and will adhere for longer.  Are you sewing in a frame using a Cad CaM?

I usually work from the backing/bobbin side of the garment, the backing provides a bit of material between the eraser and the garment.  Still you can end up with a hole in the fabric if you're not super careful.  You're still gonna have some telltale signs of the previous embroidery since it looks like it was a stitch-heavy design though."
