A bit of advice: that 690 will climb those rutty hills no problem - but you need to carry more speed into the hill.  Stand up on the pegs, shift down a gear, and give it a decent and steady twist of throttle.  You can always slow down if you need to, but it is difficult to speed up while climbing.  Go in hot (not too hot, mind you), and let your inertia get you up the hill."

Going forward as far as you can (in my area would be less than one carlength, too clogged up at stoplights) could also put you in danger, no? Say the car that was in front of you gets hit couldn't it end up hitting you or getting glass shards all over you?

Dualsport,3dyhyu,MuddyDirtStar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:27 2015 UTC,It's essentially lane splitting at stop lights to get to the head of the stopped traffic and shield yourself from approaching cars from the rear.
Dualsport,3dyhyu,destroyer713,3,Mon Jul 20 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"I always keep the bike in 1st when I'm stopped.  I also watch my rear view and when a car is coming up behind me I tap my rear brake a few times to give them something visual in front of them to catch their eye.  If they still look like they are coming on and haven't started slowing within 50', I move back to the throttle and ready myself to get alongside the car in front of me.  Usually the flashing brake light gets their attention."
Dualsport,3dyhyu,Drewshua,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:23 2015 UTC,I do this plus angle my bike so that I am able to get beside the car in front of me at a moment's notice. I think the flashing the brake lights whenever I have a car coming up behind me at a stop light has more to do with them seeing me than anything else.

I was in left lane, driver in right.  I was on a XT350 with supertrapp.  After the accident the driver mentioned that my bike was ""obnoxiously loud""  3) light turns green.  I accelerate and put my signal on to move right, to turn right at the next light.   4) next light was red so I come to a stop and prepared to make my right turn (blinker was on).   5) I'm looking at blue sky all of the sudden, then land with a thud on driver's hood.   Bike is totalled. I'm shaken up but surprisingly not badly injured.  They took me away in an ambulance to be evaluated at the hospital anyway.   Driver was ticketed with following too close.   I remember being livid and cursing driver out as I slid off their hood.  Calmed down once I realized I was OK.   Driver looked annoyed more than sorry she hit me from behind.    Witnesses said driver rear-ended me at speed, which was around 25mph.    I should have sued, especially with their comments about the loud exhaust.   More importantly, I should have paid closer attention to what was going on around (and behind) me..

Dualsport,3dwdqx,two-wheeler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:17:00 2015 UTC,Very cool
Dualsport,3dxnhx,Sgt_Alexander_Dank,4,Mon Jul 20 11:30:54 2015 UTC,"Good: It's short and confidence inspiring. It's easy to work on. It's very unique.  Bad: it's slow, and with your weight probably very slow. Limited rear tire options given its unique size. Bad ground clearance due to it's size. Technology is outdated.  They are toy bikes, and pretty silly. I still want one though."
Dualsport,3dxnhx,ImGoingToMakeYouMad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:31 2015 UTC,Agree. I still miss mine though. It is a badass 2nd bike.
Dualsport,3dxnhx,jtrez,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:40 2015 UTC,They are great for putting around property
Dualsport,3dxnhx,two-wheeler,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"My friend has one and I rode it and rode with him a lot. I'm 6'3"" 170lb and it took me up hills with ease.  It didn't rocket me off the top of them but it had enough power for sure.  It is a very fun, excellent, functional trail bike.  My friend is 5'10"" 200lb and he rides it to work every day, down a 50mph ""highway"".  He loves it. Sometimes I get my klr250 stuck and he gets through and sometimes he gets stuck and I get through the muck.  I suggest buying it used because it'll cost half as much and they'll take a beating from the previous owner at no cost to functionality.    Pros: perfect for your size if you want to ride it around roads that are under 50mph.  Perfect trail bike imho. the stock exhaust sounds cool.  It's good for pillion for short distances (rip suspension).  Gas saver.  Looks badass.  Cons: top speed is like 60.  If you go faster you are stressing the engine.  It's not a motocross bike."
Dualsport,3dxnhx,somaganjika,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:35 2015 UTC,I'm 5''6' and 165lbs. Fits me great. My 1987 Tw is currently my only bike. I got it in April and already want something more highway worthy. I put it on a hitch rack to take it to my motorcyle license test. Seems sorta goofy to do that sometimes but I do like it a lot. I'll prob never sell it. I would however reccomend something with 6 speeds if you only want 1 bike. It's a two wheeled 4 wheeler.
Dualsport,3dxnhx,Taintmash,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:17 2015 UTC,"I had a 98. Loved it. I'm 5'10"" and was around 250 at the time. It hauled me around just fine. So it'll be even better for your size. Slowest bike I've ever owned, but the one I regret selling the most. Mine had an off road only atv tire on it and it would go through just about anything. I picked mine up for $1700 and sold it for the same at the end of the season. Awesome little bike, just as long as you know what you are getting."
Dualsport,3dxnhx,mrprikei,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"It's a solid little bike. The suspension is uninspiring and mediocre, and if you want to really hit anything hard it'll bottom out, but they're comfortable. They're very easy to start moving, and have enough power to feel fast without being fast.  The old school tech means it's really easy to work on. Take from that what you will.  I'd recommend giving the XT225/250 a look as well - they're not much more expensive, and provide better suspension and comfort. Also, somewhat better top speed. You'll handle either bike's size quite comfortable.  Good luck, Sergeant Dank. And Godspeed."
Dualsport,3dvl8b,Suptzs,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:20 2015 UTC,"That look. (I'm not exactly sure what you're telling me, but it's something.)  EDIT: Now in GFY form!"

Dualsport,3duwu1,fraunzonk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:40 2015 UTC,KLR650 would be in that range used.
Dualsport,3duwu1,Flypflap91,2,Wed Jul 22 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"The seat ”may "" be a little more comfortable, but over a distance even the most comfortable seat is going to hurt.  Sport bikes you'll be leaning over your tank though too, putting strain on your back and arms.   I find 200 miles to be a good stretch to warrant taking a break on almost any bike I've been on. I think the sport-tourers sound like the type you're looking for. Go out and ride a bunch of different bikes. Usually dealers will let you test ride any and all of their used inventory. New bikes may be harder to ride because they only have so many demo models available."

Dualsport,3duwu1,goose38,2,Tue Jul 21 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"Well, for your long trip, did you just want to blast around on the highways, or take the backroads.  I can't say that any long highway trip on a dualsport is usually a lot of fun.  At least out West here, the freeway speeds are fast, ~80mph, and the lack of wind protection when you're sitting upright on a dualsport gets old, at least to me.  I'd say for sure, a dualsport is the ultimate in versatility.  Have knobbies, go anywhere.  Throw on some Distanzias or Gripsters, and go into hooligan mode.  If you put a small windshield on the XR, you really can go anywhere.  This book, http://www.aerostich.com/aerostich-lightweight-touring-book.html, was written by an author with an XR650L."
Dualsport,3duwu1,desker,2,Sun Jul 19 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought about the dual sport, on mine my back and ass hurts after about 1-2 hours of straight riding. And I want to be able to go the ""the city"" with is 2 hours away. I want something with good speed too. I can't find a actual top speed for the xr anywhere. And an other thing with the cbr is the efi, I have had nothing but but trouble with carbs."
Dualsport,3duwu1,desker,2,Sun Jul 19 19:29:01 2015 UTC,"The XR will do freeway speeds no problem.  What it's actual top speed is will be based on gearing.  Like most things, there is a bit of a compromise.  If you want to do a fair bit of offroad, you might want it geared a little lower, meaning lower top speed, or gear it for a sweetspot at higher speeds, and suffer a little offroad.  If you really plan to do mostly pavement riding, and you know where you want to ride, then maybe a streetbike makes more sense.  I would think Nova Scotia would have a ton of cool non-paved places to go explore though.  Not sure what your price range is.  There are bikes like the Husky TE610, that kick all kinds of XR ass, have FI, and I've seen for sale at what I thought were bargains."
Dualsport,3duwu1,desker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"I have never seen a husky around ever. There is lots of amazing placing to go in Nova Scotia, tons of dirt roads. Also, I love Hondas, I have never had trouble with any I have owned or my friends owned. So I don't think I'll buy anything but one."
Dualsport,3duwu1,two-wheeler,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:33 2015 UTC,rpm cycle in dartmouth is the only husky dealer in ns
Dualsport,3duwu1,two-wheeler,0,Sun Jul 19 20:27:05 2015 UTC,Top speed on the XR with stock gearing and 82KG rider is right around 209kph if you're feeling brave. But will ride quite comfortably at 130kph.
Dualsport,3duwu1,two-wheeler,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:46 2015 UTC,YES!!!! Finally a straight forward answer on the top speed of the xr. Thank you very much
Dualsport,3duwu1,drive2fast,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"You can make them faster with a different cam an CDI, but then you're dealing with a really fast bike with a high center of gravity. The carburetor is actually really easy to deal with, just run high test and some type of upper cylinder lubricant as well as run the engine regularly. I've run the 650 on Interstate in orange county California, she has all the power I needed to feel comfortable in traffic. All Honda dirt machines are evil handling bastards, but respringing/revalving the suspension makes a world of difference just don't expect to be winning MX events, desert races on the other hand....."

Dualsport,3dlqkl,desker,3,Fri Jul 17 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"That LC8 v-twin motor keeps weight really low compared to an inline motor. They also use higher quality components, which weigh less, over the entire bike. Think aluminium and proper structural engineering to keep weight down.  Honda is more budget oriented. They'll slap a bunch of steel together and call it done if it meets accounting's needs. This usually results in a basic motorcycle that weighs a bit more and feels a bit cheaper than something like a KTM. (But it costs far less) Once you upgrade a cheaper Japanese bike you're usually at the KTM price-point, however.  Words of wisdom: stay on top of the maintenance schedule and the thing will last forever."

Dualsport,3dlqkl,Riddick_,4,Fri Jul 17 12:04:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I know it's new and my last bike was a CBF600, so my opinion might be biased but:  It's AMAZING. Loads of power!   It has a lot of technology: Traction control, ABS (with leaning sensor), electronic suspension, wheel air pressure sensors, different riding modes and a lot more. Everything integrated nicely in a easy to use onboard computer.  You can't notice in the pictures, but the bike is GIANT. I'm fairly tall and I just reach the floor on tiptoes.   It has one drawback though: I'm in Madrid and right now its 40ºC (104ºF) and the amount of heat generated by the engine (specially when the electric fan goes off) is almost unbearable when driving in traffic. Anyway, I've heard that the same happens to all of this kind of bikes. I just hope the weather gets better soon.  I'm really happy and impressed. It's a spaceship :)"
Dualsport,3dlqkl,lumberjackninja,3,Fri Jul 17 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"I have a 990 SMT, and I recently rode the 1190: I loved it.  The 990 was lacking in the bells and whistles department, but the 1190 delivers.  The d-pad style control on the handlebars is genius.  I did notice the heat, my 990 doesn't have this problem.  I think the 1190 has a little too much plastic over the top of the engine, and it makes the heat spill out onto your legs.  I bet someone will solve this...  The 990 seems a little more wheelie-prone than the 1190, but then again I've been riding the 990 a long time.  In any case, it is hands-down one of the best bikes out there - have fun!"

It consists in a pair of deflectors for the sides and some plastic case for the electric fan to point away from you. People says it works, so I'll get it installed when I take the bike for it's first service.  As for the wheelies, you should try the bike in «Sport» mode ;)"

Or is it a windshield that actually offers protection from the wind?   My point is, is that we are all motorcycle lovers and are going to have different price points and different purposes for our bikes. There is no need to call someone elses post out saying there bike is a certain way when it is their bike, that fits their needs."

No issues with my shock. Maybe check the damping and check the preload on the spring?   Other than that maybe the previous owner really abused it. Sorry if this doesn't help. I can get a pic of the clymer pages and PM them to you if you need info on them.

TONS of airflow. I usually just wear basketball shorts under them.    I use Alpinestars Octane S-Moto gloves  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YW7668?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Plenty of armor and airflow for summer but still free enough for dualsporting.    As for Jacket, I use a cheap one with vents. Seems to work okay. I'll be buying Klim Badlands soon.    Assuming you're doing the entire TAT eventually, I really want to point out that even though it's going to be hot/humid in TN you're going to need some solid gear the further west you go. By solid I mean protection from rain and cold. When you're up in elevation the bottom is going to drop out and you're going to be cold (even in the middle of summer). Good gear is the difference between enjoying your trip and wishing you had good gear the entire time.  Best of luck on your journey!

I'd look around craigslist for the stock wheels for the WR250R, maybe someone is selling theirs from a conversion? There are many years that use the same wheel, and I think a lot of the YZ250 dirt wheels match too. It should be easy to get a dirt set!

I have one on my bike and the seat dries pretty quick after getting wet in my experience. It definitely soaks in some water so your ass is gunna be wet for a little bit but I think it's worth it over the horrible stock seat. Plus it's like 12 bucks at walmart.

I originally got an airhawk, but I didn't like it.  I bought some foam online and put in the airhawk's cover.  It works really well for me.  I've also heard good things about Seat Concepts.

Picked up a VStrom 1000 in New Hampshire and rode it back to Colorado. 800 miles to Sandusky, Ohio on the first day, York, Nebraska on the second day, and home the next afternoon.   I have a set of those new Shinko 804/805 tires on the way to get it a bit more dirt worthy. The rear Metzler is destroyed after the trip."
Dualsport,3czdlo,exploderator,14,Sun Jul 12 04:14:44 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're happy with a big beast of a bike, but a little hesitant when you call a 500 pound bike a ""dual sport"".  With good tires, I'm sure it will be OK on some gravel roads, but seriously, what would you do if it falls over leaning even just a little down hill while out in the middle of nowhere?  Walk back out 100 miles and call in a large helicopter to lift it back upright?  I don't mean to be a dick, but a bike like that is a touring bike, that might be passable on good gravel roads.  That seems to stretch the idea of dual sport, and I simply urge you to remember how much trouble you could get into if you push the limits on such a heavy beast.  And I will also be jealous at the miles you can cover not just in comfort, but in grand style :)  Such is the difficult balance we face between truly dirt-happy and truly long distance happy.  Happy riding, two wheels in any form is better than any other number of wheels :)  (except for long hauls on snow highways)"

The suspension will bottom on any jump and like an earlier comment, it's just too heavy. I live in the mountains, on any gravel decline, you will slide. Even with the best braking skills.  I made the mistake of thinking it could be dual sport as well, but one day 30 miles in gorges st. Park, I stuck it in red clay mud.  After trying to get it out for about 45 min I panicked. No cell service, no water, just panic and sheer exhaustion.  Saved only by some hunters on a gator, met them after walking out about 4 miles...in riding boots. No fun.   So I bought a klr. Problem solved.  Now my vstrom is a reliable, gas sipping, comfortable, inexpensive  touring bike.

I have also done some goat trails etc. No worries. (running Mitas e07 tyres).  On road it really do needs a 6th gear once you hit 130kmh. Suspension on dirt is not as advanced as the F800gs, but better than the old and new vstrom imho.  Fuel consumption is 18kml when lane splitting in traffic, 20kml when doing highway cruising.  Vstrom: got 2 mates with them. Old model and new model. Fabulous on road bikes. Light on fuel, easy to handle, 6 gears.  On dirt... not as great. They both ended up selling them to get F800gs bikes, I still ride my alp ... (given the funds I would get a 800gs in a heartbeat though)  The 650 alp is a dirt beast. 21"" front ftw. Tempted to do the 'upgrade' on my Alp  to 21"" :)  So will I swap my alp for a strom? No, but this is a nice problem to have, both are bikes that 'punch' above their weight.  Oh and the vstrom (2013 model) has the most amazing gearbox/gearshift (butter smooth) on any bike I have ever tried.  Edit: wanted to add I ride every day (rain, wind, whatever) and do around 20 000km per year commuting on the alp and so far no issues at all.

I don't know how the valves on the Transalp work.

I haven't any experience with a transalp, but not all alloy wheels are built the same either. I did a 6k mile trip on my Husky TR650S with alloy wheels and around 4k of that being forestry roads in the Rockies. I wasn't going slow, averaging 400 miles/day in all sorts of terrain.

Because the hill was slanted, my feet weren't able to touch the ground. I panicked and dropped the bike. I decided then and there that I needed to lower the bike. I didn't want to sacrifice any of the suspension travel, so I considered a few options: DRZ gel seat/Corbin seat($300), lowering links (~$100), or cutting the seat manually.

I wouldn't recommend it if all you do is commute highway, but it can handle those long drones if you're up to it. We tried to stay off major highways, but it's easy to find yourself approaching those speeds on it with no effort. Passing ability is there if you need it and I've never felt uneasy riding it up above 80.  I really need a seatconcepts seat, though. I could barely sit down that night."

Dualsport,3cgwn1,Apollo704,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:04 2015 UTC,Just get a new front with the P rating. It's cheaper and it's better to get one rated higher.
Dualsport,3cgwn1,desker,2,Wed Jul 8 04:56:13 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I want to replace it. I was more concerned with having tires with mismatched tread while in the dirt. I don't want a more aggresive front tire because if the street riding, which is why I was looking at the Shinko 700. But it has a less aggressive tread design, meaning the rear would have more traction in the dirt. I was wonder if people had experience with that. Is it bad to have more traction in the rear in the dirt specifically?"
Dualsport,3cgwn1,Apollo704,2,Wed Jul 8 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"Also, they don't have that size and model in a p rating"
Dualsport,3cgwn1,desker,2,Wed Jul 8 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"Mix brands and tread pattern all day long,  it's fairly unsafe to mix speed ratings on pavement.

I use mine for backpacking as well so 1/2 pound is a big weight savings for a luxury item.  I like being able to lean backwards or forwards with the Monarch as well.

The first Bike I converted I ran the AC head/tail light and then used DC for the Horn and turn signals as they are the only things that require DC. My current one is Full DC with all LEDs  Id imagine the other XRRs would be the same way, the XRLs were a street legal bike from the get go and probably all DC"

If they run AC, how do they regulate the voltage to avoid blowing bulbs? Normally you use a single zener diode on the rectified current."
Dualsport,3c76p9,ctesibius,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"They just have a voltage regulator that shorts to ground the same as a DC system does with the regulator/rectifier, only the DC system has that rectifier part that converts it to DC. I never researched what components it uses to do the actual regulation with.   They are actually super simple systems. The Stator has ignition coils and lighting coils same as any stator. engine is powered off the ignition coils again same as anything. the lights get power from the light coils, and wired parallel with the lights is the regulator that dumps any excess voltage above the set amount to ground.   The only difference between the AC system and DC system is when the power comes out of the lighting coils it goes into the regulator/rectifier, gets regulated and converted to dc and then goes into the battery. the battery then powers the system."

Does it run on AC or DC?  If its DC then LED is the best way to go, way brighter for the same draw, and they last longer.  If its AC then you have to run a traditional bulb as a LED bulb would only be powered half of the cycle and therefore be half as bright as its rated output.   You can also go aftermarket as there are plenty of modern options out there. I personally modified a CRF450R fender to fit my XR600R and run a under fender light setup Super bright, hardly pulls any power, and its cheap"

I test rode every bike I could get my hands on, almost paid cash a couple of times, and then discovered the ""old"" KLR. 1/4 mile down the road I was like ""holy cow"" this bike is FUN. I've put 30K on that and picked up a WR and added 20K to it so far. I've been on the road for as much as 3 months at a time. I like to ride.  Possibly I look at little too rough for most BMW's, I understand, I'm not a harley dude, just that DRZ and KLR people seem much more engaging.  The balls thing, is more stupidty I'd say, had a guy on a boxer try to hang when I was riding 2 up, he'd stay with me in the straights and take forever to catch me after a nice set of twisties.

Now if it's an Ohio state park they may be able to get you for not being double tagged.

Dualsport,3c2pr1,lumberjackninja,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"In Montana, you basically have to register the bike twice- once for on-highway use and once as an OHV. The registration is permanent (as are all motorcycle registrations here), but you have to explicitly ask for them to give you both. They'll print off two separate receipts, and you get a little sticker for the OHV registration that you need to put somewhere visible.  I've done this with my KLR, but I forgot to do it when I registered my girlfriend's Sherpa. You're supposed to have the OHV registration when riding on state land, but I've never even seen any law enforcement when I ride. There's a level of reciprocity with many other western states (except Idaho, you have to buy a visitor's tag for like $15.00)."
Dualsport,3c1ip5,JO2W,6,Fri Jul 3 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Don't know if they make that tire in a size for the CRF250L. I used to have that bike - one option you should consider is the Kenda K270. They last a long time, are decent on road, and are way cheaper than the Heidenaus. Pretty good off road too. I liked them so much I put a set on my DR. I ride about the same as you - lots of commuting and off roading on weekends."

Dualsport,3c1ip5,croy_00,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:24 2015 UTC,"It's ok at moderate corners, but if you try to get a knee down or get into any sort of twisties you'll have some trouble. The side knobs on the k270 are pretty soft of fold over when you get leaning on them. So the rear tends to jump out of line a few inches of so sometimes.   butt they are a decent tire for the price. Decent mileage if you don't wheelie and lock up the rear a lot like I do. haha. I'd call it a really good off road dually too (unless your got some mad skills at whipping through single track)."
Dualsport,3c1ip5,Mr_Braaap,2,Mon Jul 6 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, gotcha. I just passed my MSA yesterday, so highly doubt I will be dragging knee's or pushing mad skills on any single tracks soon haha."
Dualsport,3c1ip5,croy_00,2,Mon Jul 6 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"With that being said, I think you'd still like the tire. little noisy at highway speeds, but as long as you're not pushing the tire it's good valvue for the money. You can even replace it as 60% tread left and still be less than the value of other dual sport tires.   NINJA edit: And it will perform better for your bike anyways, I had it on a big 650L."

Find what works for you and your machine the best and try not to let cost effect your decision. I always say this in tire threads; Tires are way cheaper than hospital bills.

Dualsport,3c1ip5,RudolphDiesel,2,Sat Jul 4 02:13:26 2015 UTC,"Each size k60 is a different tread pattern and has different grip and wear characteristics.   You're probably running 150s on the 800 at least, I have a 140 on my TR650S. The center strip is significantly narrower on the 140. When you get to the 18 inch sizes, there isn't necessarily a strip. That strip is what gives the excellent range. I've heard for the more dualsport, less adventure bikes that it's not a good option as reports show closer to 3k miles."

Dualsport,3c1ip5,RudolphDiesel,2,Sat Jul 4 12:35:54 2015 UTC,"I'd pass on the K60. Looks like they don't make it in the right size anyway, and it's really intended for the heavier bikes like V-Stroms and GSs. Plus they're way expensive compared to the tires usually used on lightweight dualsports.  K270s, Shinko 244s, etc. are probably the best balance for what you want to do. There are tires out there that will last longer on the street, but they won't grip as well off-road, e.g. Bridgestone TW41/42. I have the TW41/42 on my XT; they came with the bike (bought used) and in the 3500 miles I've put on it they show very little additional wear."

Dualsport,3bzjir,shaggypants,3,Fri Jul 3 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"Look in to Garmin's Montana or Oregon.   They're both waterproof, can do offroad tracks (what your TAT trail is going to be) and also Nuvi style road routing.  I picked up an Oregon 600 a bit ago from REI for $215, so deals can be had."
Dualsport,3bzjir,The__RIAA,2,Fri Jul 3 13:38:48 2015 UTC,That is a great price on the Oregon. Were you able to compare the Montana side by side? I am curious how the different screens compare.
Dualsport,3bzjir,Dweller,3,Fri Jul 3 17:22:22 2015 UTC,The Montana is definitely bigger.  But screen is pretty nice on the Oregon though.  I have it mounted on a wr250r so it fits the bike nicely.  I have no problems seeing the smaller screen while riding.
Dualsport,3bzjir,The__RIAA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:06:03 2015 UTC,Preloaded with topo is a nice touch... but did you need to buy another map package to do road navigation?
Dualsport,3bzjir,WolfKunt,3,Fri Jul 3 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"In the $200 or less range it's going to be tough to get both topo and the City Navigator functionality.  Topo takes up a lot of storage, and can slow the unit down as well.  My older Garmin really chokes on it, map updates take forever, etc.  It might be useful on the TAT though, even if you're mostly going on tracks, you might need to find a way around a closure for example.   Are you taking a computer to load new maps on?    Here is just a thought...have you looked at just using something like a Samsung S3 or some other beater cellphone?   I know after dicking with Garmin products for many years now, and after playing with a friends phone that he uses on dualsport rides, I'm really tempted.  Just get one, no cell service, and load it up with maps.   Otterbox case, RAM mount, should be good to go."
Dualsport,3bzjir,WolfKunt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"The rub is that the Garmin basemap that comes preloaded on the nuvi 2557 I had sitting at the house don't show crucial things like fire roads, farm roads, whatever. I bought the maps from Sam and uploaded them to Mapsource, but the area they start in shows nothing on the basic Nuvi."
Dualsport,3bzjir,juda5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:42:57 2015 UTC,"The topo would have that covered.  For a lot of the riding I do, it's really the only thing that has trails on it.  Can you load topo on a Nuvi?  I didn't think you could do much with those, but have never owned one."

You can download 24k topo maps (higher res than the pre-installed 100k maps) for free at several places on the net.   edit: You can also download free navigable maps from the Open source maps project for routing.

But you have to be open minded too and think of their point of view. I always shut of the bike and get my helmet of, so they see I'm clearly willing to discuss this and don't fuck off at the first posibillity..   You have to also say you know most of these guys, if not personaly then just by sight.. I live in a village of 1500 people and we're one of the bigger towns..

In Pittsburgh, we ride next to as many train tracks as we can get away with. Rougher neighborhoods tend to have more delinquent and abandoned warehouse property that you likely won't get yelled at for riding on. I can imagine there are plenty of fun places to plunk around up near the tioga marine terminal, hog island (come to think of it, I saw dirt bikes right by that entrance often), and north Philadelphia.  It turns more into trials type riding than actual dirt biking sometimes, but select your bike based on that. Something like a KTM free ride (yes, I know they aren't street legal) will be more at home than an open class xr650r, but ride whatever you want. The challenge can make it fun."

I couldn't have used the bivy comfortably above around 50 F though.   I really considered a Hennessy hammock as well, but I'm glad I didn't. A couple times I had to tie my tarp off of  picnic table as there weren't any trees, or no trees substantial enough for a tarp, let alone a hammock. I hit some bad storms and just didn't get the option to find a prime spot every night. But the hammock would be damn comfy in the summer/spring/fall."

Dualsport,3bkt9z,ut-da-fror,2,Tue Jun 30 20:12:13 2015 UTC,The hammock is nice in theory but if you don't have any trees/posts/etc to tie it to you are kinda screwed. They also tend to be pretty fair weather camping oriented unless you bring a tarp to put over the top and a sleeping bag specifically designed to go around the hammock (and maybe a bug net?). Since you are planning on being gone a while I think the most versatile option that would take up the least amount of space would be a two person ultra light tent. I've got one of these which is perfect for one person with a little extra room for the gear that you don't want to leave outside. It also folds up small enough to easily fit in the bottom of my panier.
Dualsport,3bjgby,andyb3d,3,Mon Jun 29 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"I think the 250 is way too small for you, especially if you've been able to ride your 800 on trails!   Why not just get a WR450 or plate any of the higher displacement KTMs like the 500? I don't know much about the 690, but it seems like too much bike for me on the trails.. But they do ride it on the Dakar with an adventure kit... So maybe it's an option.   Also, how far are trails from you? The 250 isn't the most highway capable bike."
Dualsport,3bjgby,happy_folk,5,Mon Jun 29 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"Maintenance is a major factor youre not considering.  The KTM's are always in the shop being maintained, the WR450F is at least a little more reasonable with 1000 mile oil changes and 5000 mile valves, but the WR250R is 3000 mile oil, 25,000 mile valves.    250 is absolutely highway capable.  people who say this have no idea what theyre saying.  its no KLR or BMW tank, but its absolutely fine if youre not a puss and dont tremble at the thought of getting a little blasted from gusts."

I'm curious how long you've actually ridden a 250 on the highway for? I'm sure you'll pull some high number out of your ass, but in my experience even a DRZ 400 was unenjoyable after about 2 hours at highway speeds.   I recently just rode a KLR 650 4000km through Chile and Argentina. Wind gusts are nothing to scoff at and be called a pussy over.

I think the guys that are harsh on the wr250r reviews are coming from full dirt bikes and also have great skills that need a bike that can handle some crazy antics!  Coming from a almost 500lb bike it's going to be great.   First upgrade is going to be 606 tires, bash plate and hand guards - after I've got to know the bike maybe a full FMF exhaust with computer to drop a few lb and gain a few hp."
Dualsport,3bjgby,Dr_Monkee,2,Mon Jun 29 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"NO... dont do the 606's.  Please god no.  Spend 1/4 the price and get MX907HP's and a much much better tire.    change gearing up before you do anything to the bike, then do the rest of the power mods.  the 13/43 is not dirt capable.   Edit:  Ive had D606's, and mx907hp.  I currently am running a sedona 907hp front and pirelli mt 43 rear.  The 907hp lasts the longest, and is definitely the best in the dirt and i notice no difference between the 3 on the road.  I will say however the D606s were the most expensive and wore out the fastest by far.  Worst investment ive put into the bike."

There's a bit of an adjustment you can do stock (google it, there's a tuning mode if you jump one of the wires under the seat to ground) to dial things in.  Not saying that a computer won't be an improvement over that, but you don't have to buy everything at once.  Also, +1 on the 606 tires.  I just swapped my street tires for that and wowee.  Handles well everywhere at the cost of humming noise on the street."
Dualsport,3bjgby,scuba7183,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:22:34 2015 UTC,Handles well everywhere at the cost of humming noise on the street.   But still handles well on the street?
Dualsport,3bjgby,xanderick,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I was expecting a huge difference after the Shinko 705s, but mostly got the humming and maybe a bit more rolling resistance--essentially two things you're never getting around if you put knobbies on.  Surprisingly didn't get any wobble at 65mph either.  Experience tells me that knobbies and wet pavement aren't a great combo, and I assume it goes for these as well.  I try not to test those limits anymore, though."
Dualsport,3bjgby,xanderick,2,Tue Jun 30 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"Got a WR250R and I'm always a little bit sad at the lack of torque.  The weight and the suspension feel just about perfect, and it's arguably a better bike overall than the DRZ400 (closest competitor), but you may prefer the low end grunt that the DRZ would give you."
Dualsport,3bjgby,ctesibius,2,Mon Jun 29 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"I have the earlier Yamaha TT250R, an air-cooled four-stroke-single originally built as an entry-level enduro bike.  I weigh about 195lb, I think. I ride on English ""green lanes"" - basically tracks, sometimes muddy, rutted or stony, but not sandy. Some of them can be technically quite difficult, passable on foot but not in a 4WD. So far I've never run short of power. My bike will probably do about 75mph on the road, but there's no way I'd be able to control it at that speed across country. I think the only reason why more power might be useful is for lifting the front wheel to get over obstacles, but that's not really something I need to do often. Your situation may be different if you have lots of well-surfaced open tracks.  What is more important is weight. I dropped the bike three times in ruts on one 70 mile run while trying to keep up with faster riders, and the fact that the bike is very light to get back up (and to lift out of ruts where necessary) is very important.  The other vital thing for me is low-down torque, which the TT has in abundance. That allows me to choose what speed I want to use to address a section. It's also why I didn't go for a more modern bike - they tend to be very enduro-oriented, stressing high-rev power more than I wanted. The WR250R reviews seem to indicate that it has more low end torque than the WR250F, which could be good."

Dualsport,3bjgby,Aedelmann,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"If im not mistaken the stock chain is 108 links and that would absolutely not fit a 13/52 set up.  I currently am using a 112 link chain for the 13/52 and the tire is as far forward as possible.  Realistically i would recommend getting a 114 link chain for that gearing.  And dont be fooled, that gearing can still ride highway, you just have to be willing to sit at 9500rpm's in 6th gear the whole time."

Everyone seems to love the 250R as well.  Most of them usually end up getting an exhaust, header, fuel programmer, and doing a few mods (air box mod) to get some extra power out of it.  I will be going with a big bore kit on mine eventually but love it as is.  I currently run the FMF header and exhaust, fmf programmer, air box mod, 47 tooth rear sprocket, and its plenty of fun off road and on.

The WR isn't boring by any means. It can handle almost anything I throw at it offroad, just not necessarily as quickly or smoothly as the Honda or KTM. Going over whoops and over rough terrain is harder because you'll have to move a lot more - you won't be able to just use the throttle to get the front end up. You'll also be a little under powered when trying to swing the rear end through loose corners with the throttle - it's probably doable by playing with the clutch but I've never gotten that nailed down.  The only real problem I've had with my WR is the front wheel basically exploded one day in the middle of a washout. I lost 4 spokes and the whole thing was warped. It could have been my bad letting the spokes get loose not checking them often enough.  Overall, it's fun bike offroad, and still street legal, I love it and have kept it for the last 4 years but still like having a ""real"" dirtbike.  On the highway, fully pinned in 6th gear I can get up to about 85mph - but that's not really sustainable and quite uncomfortable on that bike. Cruising around at 60-70 is fine."

Great suspension travel, super light, good power. It handles great. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. It's significantly more expensive than the other 250 dual sports, but the price is definitely worth it. It will go anywhere I ask it to."

Suspension is good out of the box (probably not in the same class as KTM, but much better than most japanese dual sports). There isn't much low end grunt, the power is made on the higher end - needs to rev. Overall, the power to weight is pretty good. I miss mine, but a V-strom fits what I do much better (i.e. street)"
Dualsport,3bjgby,Vroonkle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:36:38 2015 UTC,"Even if you mod it to hell, a 250 is still a 250 (well, unless you put a turbo on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYbiTKtlFd4)  It doesn't really have torque down low, you have to rev to motor a lot. One guy on ADVrider put it pretty well, the WRR has 2 throttle positions, fully closed and fully open. The suspensions is allright, but a good tuning always helps a bunch. Another bike to consider could be a DRZ 400, used one can go for pretty cheap ( not here on Finland)  But it's the best of the jap 250 dual-sports, and overall probably a pretty nice bike, blessed with a godly gearbox. It will probably serve you well.  I'm hoping for a dual-sport version of the Katoom 390.  Disclaimer: I have not ridden the bike myself, these are things I have gathered over the interwebs."

The stock tires are crap too, I slid all over the place in the mud. I was riding on old quad trails so they were a little rough. Just kept picturing myself getting impaled by the broken sticks along the trail lol.    I changed the rear sprocket this year and it helped tremendously with first gear. Haven't gotten 606s yet, but plan to soon. I may take it out to the trails in a couple days and see if I like it better with the new sprocket. I still think I will prefer my quad for trail riding though. Definitely a fun bike, I don't regret getting it at all"

People say to me that a person being a Dualsport is impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m sexy. I’m having a plastic surgeon install a Baja Designs dualsport kit, brush guards, and a windscreen on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Dually” and respect my right to killing it in the dirt and street in any conditions.

Stock to stock, the WRR is much sportier imo.     With stock gearing I had no problem going 70-80 (with a little more to go) according to the stock speedo. The front wheel gets a little wobbly and takes some getting used to but it's definitely manageable. I had a 20 mile commute each way on the highway (70mph) each day and it did fine. No real high speed passing power though. I've passed folks on the highway, but it's because they were going at/under the speed limit.     I've changed the gearing (13/48), put a 4.7 gallon tank on plus a few other non performance things. I really like the bike for what it is: a 250 dual sport.

Depending on what type of case... the 1500 is big enough for most bikes. 1430 for small ones.

Dualsport,3b9j1k,El_Al_Erfainsht,2,Sat Jun 27 10:34:30 2015 UTC,I concur. Didn't care for this tire off road or on wet asphalt but if I had to travel 6000 miles with off-road sections I would still consider it as it is a reasonable compromise for a long lasting tire.
Dualsport,3b9j1k,smeee,2,Sat Jun 27 14:58:37 2015 UTC,Compromising traction for longevity is compromising your safety for a few bucks. Hospital bills cost a lot more than a tire.
Dualsport,3b9j1k,desker,6,Sat Jun 27 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"Be aware of the capabilities of your setup and ride accordingly. Everything is a compromise. You could run a more aggressive off road tire on a long road trip with off road sections to get better off road traction, but you would be giving up on road traction. The K60 was decent on the road (albeit not fantastic on water), I just didn't like it for off road use as it didn't have enough bite for my liking."
Dualsport,3b9j1k,smeee,2,Sat Jun 27 16:04:46 2015 UTC,I hear you. I need to know what my equipment will do and that it will do what I need it. Longevity is not something I'm willing to allow as criteria. Let's say my rear tire bites like a mother fucker and the sidewall holds true on a tight asphalt corner but only gets 2200 miles before it's bald; I'm not going to get a different tire that doesn't do the first two but gets 4k miles before bald.
Dualsport,3b9j1k,desker,2,Sat Jun 27 16:17:53 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Looking at the Dunlop D606 to fill these criteria.
Dualsport,3b9j1k,Zappafied,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:55:22 2015 UTC,I've been digging the k760 on the rear. Don't hesitate to use different tires front and rear.
Dualsport,3b9j1k,desker,6,Sat Jun 27 23:06:18 2015 UTC,"As a road tire they are great in corners on my KTM 990 adventure, as in peg dragging good, they warm up nicely, but she'd the heat fast in the front. Decent for a fire road or hard pack, but that highway lug down the middle really prohibits any hard throttle and is quick to lock the rear.  I cut the center block into lugs with a tire cutter and it really woke the tire up in softer terrain.  This tire does not like wet tarmac.  The front is infinitely better than the rear in the wet, so you should be prepared to hang the tail out if you aren't silky smooth on throttle input.  Front holds up really well under hard braking for a dual purpose tire, and resists cupping way better than expected.  As for lifespan, I am about 2.5 rears to a front, and average 4000km on a rear.  Granted I am rougher on tires than most of the people I know.  I ride about 70% tarmac with super sports and 20% fire road with about 10% light single track."
Dualsport,3b9j1k,synkt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:31:33 2015 UTC,wow what a comment. I still want them and look forward to hanging the tail out a bit. Your info is great on what to expect.

Dualsport,3b8bc2,onmybike,2,Fri Jun 26 21:51:16 2015 UTC,What do you mean by a ground up build?
Dualsport,3b8bc2,chiefkeif,9,Fri Jun 26 20:57:31 2015 UTC,I mean last month she looked like this: http://imgur.com/09RtH1U

Dualsport,3b8bc2,chiefkeif,2,Fri Jun 26 21:08:05 2015 UTC,Yup. May 27th is what the tag on the photo says. What can I say? I can be obsessive.
Dualsport,3b8bc2,happyshlappy,2,Fri Jun 26 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"That's awesome. Did you buy all the parts individually or what? I really want to get a dual sport, one that possibly needs a tad bit of work, but I'm having trouble finding something. Any tips?"
Dualsport,3b8bc2,Im_Currently_Pooping,2,Sat Jun 27 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"I got what was advertised on Craigslist as a ""complete bike in pieces"".  Of course we all know what that means. Luckily it wasn't missing much, and the stuff that was missing wasn't hard or expensive to get. And most of it was stuff I wanted to replace anyway(lighting, fenders, etc.)   As far as tips, I'd suggest looking for a parts bike/complete bike that's not running. Easier to keep track of what you need to replace. I'm also lucky to be in Southern California where there are always tons of bikes for sale."
Dualsport,3b8bc2,Im_Currently_Pooping,2,Mon Jun 29 04:56:22 2015 UTC,what brand chain is that?
Dualsport,3b8bc2,hausi22,3,Sat Jun 27 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"Sks? Srs?  Not DID that's all that I noticed. Only thing I could get on short notice. Sprockets and chain were a last minute addition. I had planned on using the sprockets that came in the parts bins, and using a cheapo chain for a week or so to see how I liked the shorter front gearing. But the sprockets weren't stock width to match the chain I had ordered and to top it all off, one was 525 and the other 530. So I ended up going all back to stock with a 14 up front, 48 in back with the standard 520 chain."
Dualsport,3b8bc2,hausi22,2,Sat Jun 27 03:28:10 2015 UTC,"Eh I hated the short gearing on my thumper, 1st and 2nd were practically non existant, and it SCREAMED at 55mph in 5th."

Dualsport,3ba1do,billgoldbergmania,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't exactly call them cheap. Here in Europe they are about double the price of the cheapo tyres  If you want megacheap, try Goldentyre :) I don't know if they have them around where you live though"
Dualsport,3ba1do,chewb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:39:20 2015 UTC,70-80ish euro for a tire is pretty cheap. I realize you can get 35 euro tires but I wouldn't feel at ease.

Dualsport,3ba1do,chewb,2,Sun Jun 28 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"I swapped from Shinko 705s (great street tires) to a Dunlop D606 rear and Michelin T61 front.  Street performance was impressive on the knobbies--I was expecting them to feel far worse than the Shinkos I just pulled off.  Good bit of hum from the knobs, but they handled well on-road and really impressed me off-road."

Dualsport,3b62qd,happy_folk,7,Fri Jun 26 12:22:00 2015 UTC,Black bears are afraid of everything. Geese will chase them away from their Cubs.

Dualsport,3b62qd,happy_folk,2,Fri Jun 26 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"True and same here. They maybe got 50 to 100 pounds on me full grown, but I'd probably be scared shirtless standing in front of one.   Was camping one time and there were fresh prints all over the site but never actually saw any.   At least in Florida there are no recorded deaths from a black bear attack, so if I do die I'll make the history books."
Dualsport,3b62qd,thirsty904,3,Fri Jun 26 14:00:59 2015 UTC,"I think the tip is to stand your ground, make loud noises, jump around  and fight back against a black bear and they usually run away.   A grizzly bear though.. They recommend covering your neck and playing dead, but frankly, if you piss one off you're dead."
Dualsport,3b62qd,happy_folk,10,Fri Jun 26 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"With a grizzly bear, they tell you to play dead for a good reason.  Many people say it's because you stop being a threat to them, and since you are not usual prey, they lose interest.  But really it's so that you have more time to get used to being dead, because that's how you're gonna be permanantly soon."
Dualsport,3b62qd,zalifer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:08:08 2015 UTC,Which would be pretty easy with the dirt bike.   Also make sure you aren't preventing the only area of escape. If you're standing between a wild animal and freedom it will choose to he through you.

Dualsport,3azx8c,wheatola,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that I knew - I would order 140's on my previous KLR (stock is 130's) because they get the centre strip and would last longer.

The only issue I have with them is on wet pavement their harder rubber compound doesn't provide as much grip as the TKC's - not that I have had any significant problems, but my 1150 will spin the rear tyre under accel much easier. For the significant wear improvements (I have 16,000km on this set of K60's and should get 1,500-2,000 more - on a big GS that is usually fully loaded/2-up with a heavy throttle) its something I am willing to sacrifice."

Dualsport,3b0emd,TamlandBrick,4,Wed Jun 24 23:30:40 2015 UTC,It might be a speed weave/wobble.   If you test ride it and hit 60mph and it starts to shake push your weight up to the front and lean your head over top of the bars and maintain that same speed. If it goes away it is a weave. If it does not go away then the rim might be out. It might be an unbalanced rim too. Typically you can tell a rotor is warped only under braking. If you brake and it vibrates then it's your rotor

If you have little/no mechanical experience, you may want some help to rebuild the shocks -- it is fairly easy to remove them and bring them to a shop for rebuild.

Dualsport,3ar9ws,BadGrammarSucks,3,Mon Jun 22 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"UPDATE:  My final assessment is that the fuel was in the oil due to a bad petcock and/or bad float needle situation, which I repaired/cleaned/replaced.  What I thought were gaskets was extra RTV silicone that was used to seal the crank case, eaten away by the fuel in the oil.  After all that, I just needed to change the spark plug and she runs like a champ.  Thank you all very much for the help, even ""Mr. Doomsday.""  Ha ha."
Dualsport,3ar9ws,savethemolarbears,2,Wed Jun 24 05:05:48 2015 UTC,"Well you can listen to Mr. Doomsday or you can just check your float needle/seat. MOST times gas in the oil is from that little bugger. Easy to replace. About $10-20 part. Gasket material in the oil is another story. What's your history with the bike?  Did the last person to pull the side covers put it on straight?  There's usually some overhanging gasket into the case. Maybe some finally broke away?

I don't know how it was maintained before me, but I've replaced the petcock and rebuilt the carburetor recently.  I've been driving it for about 5 minutes a day, but I only just now got around to changing the oil.  It runs.  I'm really just trying to figure out what those gaskets are, and how to look for them.  Do I just take this thing off and poke around?  And I'll probably have to order the new gaskets online, so I was wondering what they're called, if anyone knows.  I should point out that it's at least one entire gasket, not just a small portion of one."
Dualsport,3ar9ws,savethemolarbears,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:47:13 2015 UTC,Yup pretty much. You're going to have to drain the oil again unfortunately if you've already done an oil change.  But if it's still empty do it now. Pull both side covers off. I'm not sure about the OEM official name but one is called a stator or left hand engine cover.  The other a clutch or right hand engine cover. Replace both gaskets obviously when reassembling.  Any chance you have a photo of the gasket that came off and exactly where you found it???  It seems kind of impossible that an entire gasket would make it through the oil drain plug!
Dualsport,3ar9ws,savethemolarbears,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"I already threw it out, but it was in the oil/fuel that I dumped out.

Dualsport,3ar9ws,savethemolarbears,2,Tue Jun 23 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"I'm gunna take an educated guess and say that PO used rtv to put the side covers on instead of the proper gaskets and the gas in the crank case ate up any excess and floated it into your oil. I'm thinking WORST case scenario it ate through anything used to mate the two halves of the case together. But unless it was leaking you can almost certainly rule that out. Gas would be thinner than oil and it would have been extremely noticeable pre oil change. I'd replace the gaskets and keep an eye on your oil, but you're probably ok.   Ninja edit: also it would be a good idea to change your oil pretty quickly again to make sure you flush everything out. An inexpensive option for oil is rotella T, 15w-40. It's ok for bikes and about 1/4 the price of motorcycle oils. Been using it for over a decade on all my bikes."

Dualsport,3ar9ws,desker,0,Wed Jun 24 05:01:23 2015 UTC,Gas would be pissing out of the overflow if it was filling the bowl enough to pass into the crankcase.
Dualsport,3ar9ws,xanderick,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:50:15 2015 UTC,Not really. It's actually extremely common for gas to overfill the float bowl and get into the cylinder and wash past the rings. I've seen it too many times to count.

Dualsport,3ar9ws,desker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:04 2015 UTC,"If left for long enough, totally. Realistically that's the only explanation for that much unused fuel to get into the bottom end. During a combustion cycle, if there was that much extra fuel in the cylinder it would be forced out through the exhaust.  But I think he might have been exaggerating or just misspoke when he said ""full"" of fuel. Usually it only takes a little bit of gas in your oil to have a noticeable smell and to show any kind of separation. Either way ANY amount of fuel in the oil is bad and needs to be addressed immediately."
Dualsport,3ar9ws,juda5,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"Two quarts came out.  It only holds a quart of oil.  So it was a 1/1 fuel/oil mixture.  The bike's been sitting for at least a year with a bad petcock, so perhaps that's why."
Dualsport,3ar9ws,desker,2,Tue Jun 23 19:57:34 2015 UTC,Yea. It's a combination of bad petcock and float needle/seat. Did you replace that when you rebuilt the carb?  They usually come in the rebuild kits. If the petcock doesn't shut off (or if you leave it on for non vacuum actuated) it puts an extra strain on the float needle. This will lead to premature wear and eventually gas in the oil.
Dualsport,3ar9ws,desker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"I replaced these two things and the o-ring there as well.  Those is the float needle and seat, correct?  edit:  Those is?  I meant those are..."
Dualsport,3ar9ws,desker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:17:58 2015 UTC,Yup. Perfect.
Dualsport,3ar9ws,desker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not always the case.  I lost not one, but two Ninja 250Rs because the overflow never pissed out the gasoline coming in through the stuck petcock + stuck float valves.

Dualsport,3aqj4k,RagePoop,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:29:51 2015 UTC,I saw a group of 4 or 5 dual sport riders sitting at the San Antonio gate as I drove past. When we got to FR144 and were unloading the bikes they rode past us. Were you were one of those riders? We ran Mainline trail from the cattle guard to popovers then took a left at decision meadow and rode teakettle back to FR315 then took FR144 back to the truck 32 miles of single track and 12 miles of forest road. Never did see or hear another rider once we mounted our bikes.

Dualsport,3anxd9,uniteskater,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:51:17 2015 UTC,I think that ride definitely requires a light dual-sport bike like a WR450F or KTM 350EXC. The technical sections would be next-to-impossible on something as big as a KLR. But still it would be fun to do it on a KLR if you could skip the worst of the tight stuff.
Dualsport,3anxd9,williamtbash,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:29:52 2015 UTC,How do you get your DVR to record shows by keywords?
Dualsport,3anxd9,williamtbash,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:03:31 2015 UTC,"I have DirecTV, so I can only explain for a DirecTV DVR. If you do a Smart Search by keyword for Motorcycle Racing, any shows currently in the guide will show up in the results. When you see the results list, you should also get an option for ""autorecord"" on the left. This option will set up an autorecord across all channels.  If you pick ""record series"" from the info on a single ""Motorcycle Racing"" program (most of them show with this as the series title), it will usually record all of the shows on that same channel only. You can check by looking at the item in the Series Manager. If a channel is listed there, then it will record only the episodes on that channel. If it says ""All channels"" then it will find and record the shows on any channel that you receive."
Dualsport,3anw8d,Sliger,6,Mon Jun 22 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"Well first, if you can only go 30 or 40 miles before things start to suck, you gotta fix that seat. No underwear is gonna fix that.  That aside, for long rides, I bought a pair of Moto Skiveez to try out and really really like them. The additional padding helps, but mostly the fact that the seams are better arranged so as not to cause a problem with motorcycle use is what I like. Nice and wicking/breathable too.  http://motoskiveez.com"

Dualsport,3anw8d,RaveDigger,2,Mon Jun 22 14:13:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. Fixing the seat will probably help your issue. I ride bicycles a lot and can usually ride for 2+ hours without discomfort. I was surprised when I bought my WR and started feeling pain after 45 minutes. The seat was agitating a tailbone injury from earlier this year. I thought it would go away. Maybe I just needed more seat time.  After all, my bike seats weren't causing problems. I put a bunch of time in and tried wearing cycling shorts. Nothing worked. I finally broke down and installed the Seat Concepts kit. The extra width makes a huge difference. There's way more real estate for your cheeks. I no longer experience tailbone pain. Wish I would've bought it earlier.   Edit:  Is the pain you are experiencing from chafing or impact from the seat? If it's chafing, I agree with the folks recommending compression or cycling shorts. Avoid cotton, it can be abrasive when it's saturated with sweat."

It's all about suspension and ground clearance. I had a 79 XS750 that I used to tear up the no winter maintenance roads on. It was a big heavy on road bike but it was a blast to crank on in the mud. The big thing with that is you have to watch smashing your exhaust up a little. As long as you won't be heart broken if you drop your bike or bang it up a bit then I say go for it.

The stock suspension was way too soft for me (200#) and I was beat up after a mile. The stock front suspension only has 3 inches of range I believe where a klr will likely have 7+.  If your lighter than me and with some good tires it would not be bad for the occasional gravel road. You will want to get a front fender extender to protect the headers.

Traded it for an XR650L with no mileage but I never felt as comfortable with that bike as much as I did the DR.   I hit canyons every day after work, desert rode it, took it wide open throttle across an empty dry lake bed a few times, ripped through an MX track bottoming it the whole time, lots of urban riding and took it on a crazy 400 mile offroad camping adventure. All in the year I had it!   Find the zerk fittings and inject grease in them. Change the air filter and the oil and rebuild the forks. Not much else to do unless it needs the brakes bled or the battery replaced."

Dualsport,3afy74,ControlRush,3,Fri Jun 19 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Checked the VIN, its apparently a '91. Hmm  Paid 750 for it and probably put in another 50 bucks to get it to where it is now. Had 13800 miles on it when I got it last Friday(has 14300 now :D).  So, it would start and idle for 20 or so seconds before dying, so I cleaned the carbs and bored the cover off of the emission screw thing that I can't remember the name of. By then it would start and run, but the acceleration and deceleration was sluggish, so did some snooping around. Turns out, whatever dufous that did the work on this bike previously connected the two lines that go to the fuel tank the wrong way around(and did a lot more wrong besides). Fixing that fixed the accel/decel issue.  The chain is cheap and was worn out, so I had to file a link off by hand which was a pain in the ass.  Screws and bolts were either in the wrong spots or missing entirely(or stripped...sooo many stripped threads).  The LED turn signals don't trip the sensor that flashes them, so they're in manual mode until I can get that done.  The suspension had WAY too much travel, so I took some PVC and cut it to size to increase the preload, works great now.  Needs a new top end. Once I can get that done, this thing will be a beast. Even as worn out as it is, it still runs pretty good.  Major oil hog when going highway speeds. 1 quart every 70 miles or so, it seems. In town its fine.  Its a pain to work on due to the cramped little space Kawasaki decided to shove everything. Basically have to disassemble the entire bike to get to most things.  The water cooling works like a charm(which is great considering I live in southern California).  Probably some stuff I missed, but you get the gist.  Solid bike, worth the cash!"

Just watch for a slipping clutch because I believe it has lubrication additives. I just left it in for a couple of weeks and then changed the oil. Also check your crank case breather hose, if they are plugged up it will burn oil more. As for the turn signals I put a relay in mine and it worked great for super cheap. I tried the resistor method first but they get pretty hot.  http://www.autobarn.net/ch00011.html?site=google_base&gclid=Cj0KEQjw-46sBRD7x6P0stibwbsBEiQAoMi4ZuJggp0dg6DyyB9Y60hQpNv8gPwO0F-Kuwdk9qpDUm0aAmR-8P8HAQ  http://www.amazon.com/CARCHET-Signal-Flasher-Motorcycle-Indicator/dp/B00CMO3V0S"

I used a kit from Tusk on my 2006 WR450F and I was really happy with the results. Here's the version for your bike, although it's showing as not in stock now.  On my bike, I also replaced the stock rear fender with an aftermarket one without a light, since the plate-holder/light assembly that came with the kit had the integrated tail/brake light.  I remember that I had to fabricate some mounts for the front turn signals because I didn't want to drill holes into the number plate. I just bent some strips of aluminum I had laying around.  Also, I don't know if it's still the case, but part of what the kit did for me was add the switch to allow me to use the high-beam on the bike.

Dualsport,3a8pfe,Bucky_Goldstein,9,Thu Jun 18 16:25:46 2015 UTC,500 EXC is too high strung. You can't commute on one to work each day without spending all your evening wrenching on it. That's not what it's designed for. It's designed for racing and doing short liaisons on the road legally followed by having a mechanic overhaul it every night.  The adventure line of bikes from KTM are designed for doing big kilometers on and off the road with much longer service intervals. Better handling for luggage with stronger subframes and pegs so you can take a passenger.   While the adventure might be based on the same engine as the duke it will probably be tuned differently to build power down low and reduce internal stress/wear so it will last longer.

Dualsport,3a8pfe,metal_fever,9,Thu Jun 18 09:46:52 2015 UTC,"Looks great.  An under 400cc medium range offroad bike to compete with the wildly successful DRZ400.  Something comfortable on the highway, but able to do single track if need be.  If it has a 6th gear, that's the selling point for me.  Of course after a few years when a good 2nd hand one is possible to obtain.    Hopefully it doesn't come with a massive spiderweb of complex electronics, like some modern bikes these days.  Simplicity has it's merits.  Then again, KTM's aren't known for electrical problems, but I'm not a KTM expert, I'm a DRZ400 expert."
Dualsport,3a8pfe,huebort,3,Thu Jun 18 08:04:28 2015 UTC,I guess it would have the same electronics as the other 390 bikes. They seem to not have any problems so far.
Dualsport,3a8pfe,_I_Have_Opinions_,2,Thu Jun 18 12:31:33 2015 UTC,"Ok Mr expert if you don't mind I'd like to pick your brains a bit then.   DRZ400SM.

Question: I've got my hands on a Keihin 39 FCR (non MX) carb and have little clue about jetting for these beyond what my internet research has turned up. Could you help? I ride at sea level or thereabouts.   I'm thinking the following would make a good start: Main: 160 Needle: EMN 3rd clip Pilot: 45 Fuel: 2 turns out"
Dualsport,3a8pfe,ratatooie,3,Thu Jun 18 13:25:54 2015 UTC,Go on thumpertalk and find the DRZ jetting thread and ask eddie sisneros I think it is.
Dualsport,3a8pfe,Dlichterman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:29:48 2015 UTC,Already looked though that and DRZ UK forums. Just wanted to bounce it off someone else. Also the RS4s are pretty rare so jetting might be interesting.

I haven't hooked it all up yet but it's all laid out with wires run (just need to go grab some more connectors). My wire colors are different but here is what I have. First I took the ground off the lighting coil, and soldered a wire lead and ran it out with the two existing leads, one lighting, one ignition. So now I have a total of three wires coming off my stator. The two lighting coil leads run to the two yellow wires on the reg/rec.  Then I have the black running to the ground/negative wires for the lighting system. Not a frame ground. The red runs to a fuse box then splits up my lighting from there."
Dualsport,3a8qyy,savethemolarbears,2,Thu Jun 18 11:54:12 2015 UTC,Tried that; 2.3 volts. I'm starting to wonder if someone installed a TRX400EX stator on my machine. I guess I'll just need to get a gasket and pull the cover.

Dualsport,3a8qyy,savethemolarbears,2,Thu Jun 18 12:03:23 2015 UTC,Hey I came across a couple of things that might help you out. First are you running a battery?  And which model R/R do you have? Apparently these guys don't like to run very smooth off just the stator. They need a capacitor or battery in line.
Dualsport,3a8qyy,savethemolarbears,2,Sat Jun 20 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"No battery yet. Was waiting to verify at least 12.6 coming off the r/r. It's the trail tech one. I'll try adding a battery. I've got a resistor sitting around. .   Please forgive my retardation, I injured my back this morning and am waiting for my drugs."
Dualsport,3a8qyy,savethemolarbears,2,Sat Jun 20 19:03:29 2015 UTC,No worries! Been there before too!  Get well and let me know if that sorts you out.

You'll probably want to adjust chain tension after the swap anyway, but if you move the adjusters in I imagine you could do it without removing the rear wheel."
Dualsport,3a38gy,ohmyohmeohmy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:10:36 2015 UTC,"You can do it without removing the rear wheel, but you still need to loosen the axle and slide it forward with the tensioners in order to get enough slack to get the old sprocket out.  However, step 1: Loosen the nut before you go and loosen the rear wheel. You'll also need something to hold the rear wheel in place (like a friend mashing on the rear brake as hard as he/she can), unless you have an impact wrench.  Also to note: A 14 tooth won't fit with the stock case saver, you'll need to get a sandman one (relatively inexpensive and a quality piece of kit). I think the highest you can go for the rear is a 52 tooth."
Dualsport,3a38gy,646bph,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's possible on the WRR, but on the KLR you can stand on the right side of the bike, put your right foot on the rear brake, reach over the seat with a breaker bar and socket and then break the front sprocket nut loose while stepping on the rear break."
Dualsport,3a38gy,ohmyohmeohmy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"It is, but it's quite difficult to get that much leverage on the brake and the nut at the same time. It's on there tight.  What I usually end up doing is finding a wall, put the breaker bar/socket on in a way that I can get leverage with my foot and not have it fall off the nut due to angle, put my foot on the brake and lean the bike up against the wall with me on it, not on the stand. Tends to be the best thing that works, for me.  On the V-strom I just stick a board in between the wheel spokes, as they're cast (not spoked) and very strong."

Dualsport,39zfc0,Glockamolee,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:34:08 2015 UTC,How much fucking oil goes into a KTM? Oil change on my bike is $15.
Dualsport,39zfc0,desker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:21:43 2015 UTC,It takes about 1.6 liters of oil and the oil cost $20 a liter. And a filter is $10 so it's about $50 ish and they have fast intervals
Dualsport,39zfc0,Glockamolee,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:57:22 2015 UTC,Holy shit! Wtf is so special about KTM oil? I get Honda GN4 for $5 a liter and could get away with Rotella or Delo if GN4 wasn't available. Do some oil research and save yourself some money man I think your getting gouged on packaging.

Dualsport,39xwka,NelsonTethers,8,Mon Jun 15 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"So guys,  first of all the mandatory: sorry, I am not an native so there might be some mistakes. Please correct me ;-) But lets start!  I drove her for about 200 km.  But first, a little bit about myself to give you an view about my background: I am driving a Transalp 600 with street tires. So most of the kilometers I drove were on street and I never  drove a small dualsport before. We don’t have much trails around here, lots of wood but also lots of hunters who get very angry when you  ride just a mountain bike through their precious area.  Also we got lots of rain the last few weeks so its wet. its SUPER-wet. Mud is around 90% water, 10% soil. So not much to drive in.  So, thats it for the beginning.   About the bike:   Frame and Brakes:  Same frame (and I think suspension) as the other KTM Freerides. Really smooth, very very good brakes, front and rear. The rear brake isn’t a pedal, its left hand lever instead of the clutch. I never brake with the rear on the street with my bike (trying to brake as few as possible, to ride smooth) but I used the rear brake very often instead of the front brake on the KTM.  I drove a 2 stroke 250 cc KTM from a friend that weekend for the first time and I have to say: The EXC is so tiny. It is so slim and it handles more like a mountain bike as the „big“ 250 cc.  Fun story: I sat on the 250 and though:  ""I have no power. Why is there no power?“ I was so used to the EXC that I forgot I had to shift.  Torque and Battery:  Around 260 V, 28 kilograms. Thats the data. I drove about 30-35 km with one load on the highest torque level (level 3). The other two levels are… boring. On 1 there is nearly no torque, the acceleration feels a little bit like on a mountain-bike. On 2 its better, but we all know, everybody would drive with the most torque they could get. Back to topic: 30-35 km with braking before each corner and heavy acceleration after but not much speed (average around 40 km). Torque is really, really good. Till 80 km/h. Then the control closes.  You got 5 charging indicator lights. When loosing 4 of them the torque is still the same, topspeed remains about 80. With low battery (last indicator light flashing) you lose on torque (it feels like torque level 1) and speed (I drove home with 50 km/h topspeed). Driving with 80 km for an longer time uses a lot of energy. So I got 30 km before it stopped. I was a bit disappointed and exhausted afterwards because the bike is hard to push (No neutral). Luckily my dad drove right behind me and I stopped 300 m away from a house.  Sound:  Like a tram. Thats it. Its not really silent and with the nopped tires it sounds like a quiet bike.   All in all:  Fun bike but for its really expensive just for a fun-thing. It is not very practical for commuting, the charger is as big as the battery and 30 km isn’t that much.   So, thats it. Sorry it took so long! Please feel free to ask anything ;-)"

Dualsport,39wlyt,desker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:29:32 2015 UTC,Dual sport is pretty much the legal status of a dirt bike or the tire/suspension configuration of an adventure bike. No engine likes to be wrapped out regardless of the vehicle.
Dualsport,39wlyt,oSOMTo,2,Mon Jun 15 21:56:06 2015 UTC,False. A street bike 250 is much different compared to a yz250 for example. One will reach speeds of up to 120 and the other tops out at 65.   So when I say dual sport I think we all know what I mean
Dualsport,39wlyt,inspectormac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"A street bike also has different gearing. I'm talking about mechanical principals, even an F1 race car doesn't like spinning at 10k that's why they blow up."
Dualsport,39wlyt,desker,2,Mon Jun 15 22:29:23 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm saying  65 on a dual sport is going to be about topped out. 65 on an equivalent sport bike is probably 5k in 4th gear

He also noted that dual sport is a description of the tires/suspension setup on a bike, not only the engine.  It has nothing to do with dual sports, it has to do with engines.  You're making a different point entirely, which is that a 250 dual sport will be wound out at 65, while a 250 street bike won't.  While that's true, it doesn't invalidate the point that no motor likes to be run wound out for any length of time.  You're right, he's more right at the same time."

Dualsport,39um62,RagePoop,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"After you take care of the thing I mentioned in the other post, there are a few more things you can do. Set the suspension damping however you like it (manual says how to adjust compression/rebound front/rear, there are screws that click to indicate settings, I prefer is much stiffer than the default setting), open the airbox (keep the flap permanently open, it closes at low RPM to pass sound tests, but it makes the bike very slow), and get a better muffler if you're willing to spend a bit (FMF Q4 is good). The stock one is heavy and restrictive. The stock tires are also pretty bad. Shinko makes good budget tires. If you want to spend more look at Dunlop D606 or Continental TKC80. Yamaha says 3000 mile oil change intervals, but I would recommend doing much less than that with the Yamaha oil (1500 or less, it looks nasty by 2000). My preferred oil (for everything basically) is Shell Rotella T6. It's a cheap synthetic that is safe for motorcycle wet clutches (meets JASO MA spec, and is not energy conserving), and it's very durable/shear resistant.  Once all that is done it's pretty good.

Mine was pretty early, and had the tell tale signs of fuel pump seizure twice. Covered under warranty once, bought another pump and installed my self the second time. Don't ride in the heat or leave the tank in the sun if you have it happen. You should be able to make it where you are going, but if you stop, you will be stranded until the tank cools down the pump."
Dualsport,39ty6u,tomtomrivers,2,Sun Jun 14 19:15:15 2015 UTC,Might sound obvious but did your chain or sprocket break or come off?
Dualsport,39ty6u,johnaldisdabomb,2,Sun Jun 14 21:20:24 2015 UTC,That was the first thing I checked. I figured the chain had just popped of from hitting a rock or something but no.
Dualsport,39ty6u,Mugenski,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:45:25 2015 UTC,You'd REALLY have to work that clutch to burn it up that fast. I don't know what else it could be though because if the clutch cable snapped or got out of adjustment you would be stuck engaged not disengaged. Check the cable connetion/lever that runs into the case for the clutch. Did it get stuck open somehow?
Dualsport,39ty6u,Mugenski,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:29:25 2015 UTC,I readjusted everything.  Even tookthe clutch arm from where it goes into the engine.  And nothing can still shift into gear even with the bike running

Dualsport,39ve19,Frreed,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:58:02 2015 UTC,I love my DRZ400 for off-roading. It's great offroad and super snappy and with a front sprocket change its not too bad on the road. When I go to the store or just want a relaxing cruise and don't plan on wheelying too much I usually take my wife's DR650 because it's much more comfortable and gently to ride. My DRZ is harder and much more aggressive. It depends on what you want.
Dualsport,39ve19,WakingJoker,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:17:59 2015 UTC,"The CRF230? From what I remember, that thing vibrates like it's going to fall apart, and barely hits 40.  If you want something that'll keep you entertained longer, you could get a WR450. Keep in mind you'll have to put some effort into modding it to be what you want, but the mods are easy to find and are affordable.  If you're not comfortable with modding, a DRZ is good."

Dualsport,39qind,Iwentfishing,3,Sat Jun 13 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"My opinion would be that this bike falls into more of the adventure class of bikes. Such as the big 1200 GS or KTM. Great on the freeway. Ok on the fire roads. Difficult on the single track. That is why the front fairing area is so big. Keep the wind down.   Sport bikes are a whole different breed of bike. I don't own one, so I have no idea the break down of differences between the two."
Dualsport,39qind,desker,2,Sat Jun 13 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Suspension, center of balance and riding position. Sport bikes are designed to do one thing very well and that is, go very fast on dry pavement. Also sports bikes are designed around a certain rider to be used to their full potential; 5'5""-5'9"" 110-150 lbs. Adventure bikes are really good all around touring machines, but will always be out shined on the highway by full dress touring bikes and in the dirt by dirt bikes."

I was at a river crossing in Guatemala once, my first one ever, and my wife (pillion) and I were stopped and discussing our options, how to approach it, how to check depth, etc etc. While we were standing there, a VW Bug comes along, packed full of people and just barrels right into the water without even slowing down and drives straight across the thing. My wife and I looked at each other, shrugged, and proceeded to ride across unscathed.   Later on, we met a local who had crossed that river many many times. He got so bored with it that he had decided to make a challenge to himself to try and cross it as slowly as possible every time.

I basically drilled holes in the top of the foam.  I did an even grid, using something like a 3/8"" bit.  Helps to put the foam in the freezer overnight.   I think it was a 1"" grid, but you can try it and see.  Once the seat was recovered it was much better.  Zero cost.   I currently have a Seat Concepts seat, and it was worth the money."

Dualsport,39lja6,WolfKunt,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"There are places that will modify the foam and make a custom cover for anything.  Sargents for example.  Might not be worth the cost, but there is a lot you can do on your own."
Dualsport,39lja6,exploderator,2,Fri Jun 12 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"A few of points:   The covers are stapled in place, you will need a staple gun to re-staple.  I used a regular Bostich T-50 staple gun (normal carpentry style), it worked fine.  The staples  are a bit thinner metal than the factory wire staples, and if they don't last as long, so what, just put new ones in.  I think I used either 1/4"" or 3/8"" staples, as long as they aren't too long and poke through. I replaced the old dead vinyl cover on my 1980's bike with some soft leather.  The seat wasn't a complex shape, I just stretched the leather into place and stapled it down. If you want to narrow the front, you can probably just pull the cover a little tighter to take up the slack, before you staple it back down. Going off the comment above, about freezing the foam before drilling, you could also get it wet, then freeze it, which would allow you to drill it and/or carve it away with one of those super sharp rasps (they use them in the kitchen for hard cheeses as well as for woodworking, they are stainless steel, and look kind of like a cheese grater, but with a little blade formed at the edge of each hole, and I've seen them for $2 in the dollar store). Playing with foam isn't rocket science.  Be brave :)"

Long time ago, I had a BMW seat redone, and the company used a sandwich of three different densities of Confor visco-elastic foam.  You can Google it.

Dualsport,39ikj7,onmybike,2,Thu Jun 11 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"Looking at the forks, I'd take a guess that the seals might have blown because there are no fork gaiters and the fork tubes might be damaged. Make sure the chrome is free of chips or sharp points before you put everything back together or you might end up back where you started pretty quick. Daystar makes replacement fork gaiters. Skip the velcro ones even though they look convenient unless you are OK with washing them all the time.   I usually use a very fine sandpaper (1000? can't remember) to carefully smooth out any imperfections or rust in the chrome.    EDIT: i'd like to add that these bikes are undersprung. Depending on your weight you might want to change the spring rate. I see heavier fork oil recommended all the time and I do not recommend it if the spring rate is too soft. You will firm up the forks (it's a bandaid fix) but still will be sitting too far down in the travel. You want a correct spring that allows you to have the right sag so you utilize the most travel possible when you need it.  Progressive forks suck too (also recommended all the time) - they create weird handling quirks when pushing your bike hard. You don't want the spring rate changing under heavy braking or aggressive riding. You want smooth, predictable action. Eibach forks are drop in for these and don't require PVC spacers."

I don't feel like it affects handling that much but I am a newbie so I don't know what a new bike feels like. I will inspect my forks very close before sliding new seals on. As for the undersprungness of the bike I can see what you're talking about there. I'm 175lbs 6'0 so I might try heavier oil and a heavier spring?"
Dualsport,39ikj7,SuperTuff,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Start with getting it as close to stock as possible with new clean factory weight oil and fresh seals, then go from there. The many owners who owned the bike before you might have changed the spring rate - I am operating under the assumption that they are stock but they might have been changed.   Look for any spacers or extra valving to indicate whether or not they have been modified. Check for any branding or stamping on the spring. Start from a base and change only one thing at a time. You can swap springs out of the top caps without changing the oil. Just be SUPER careful not to strip the threads."

I kinda lied and told them we were more experienced, but we drove very dangerously. Contact them ahead of time about renting. The foreign staff started like Motorcycle Adventure Tours Antigua or something. Maybe check that out...Guatemala was very nice. No theft problems. Make sure you keep abreast of local travel warning and suggestions, highest chance of being robbed are in major cities and in rural tourist attractions.

Dualsport,39e6ua,Zappafied,3,Thu Jun 11 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there are limitations.  I have mine installed on a Bell Star Carbon, and my friend's is on a Shoei GT-Air. I ride a Triumph Speed Triple with the front fairing removed (completely naked), and both of his bikes have fairings and windscreens. He uses ear plugs when he rides, and I do not.  So with these setups, his quality is much better than mine. I can still hear him at 80 mph, but not above 81. On the other hand, he can hear me up to higher speeds.   The ear plugs eliminate much of the wind noise, yet you can still hear the earphones, but with the loud squelch removed. The volume gets loud enough to be heard over the noise, but it sounds like a CB radio or walkie talkie at high volume. Many guys solder in new earphones to improve sound quality.  On dual sports, the main problem that you'll run into is the distance between bikes. I found that over 50 yards between, or through a set of switchbacks, the reception cuts out. But if you're riding close together, or with a passenger, the sound is 90% flawless.  I plan on getting another unit for my Bell MX-9 Adventure dual sport helmet, but it's less of a priority due to typically riding trails alone. For music and phone calls, the technology is awesome. It makes for a different riding experience."

Dualsport,38y2kc,MrPremium,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:00:50 2015 UTC,"They're different bikes, so it really depends on what you want to do.  TWs are fun, especially because of the fat tires. But if you have to ride highways to get to the trails, you might hate your life. They're also fun to blast around the city on, and they're a good bike to let newish riders play around on.  XT350s are fun bikes too, but they're not that different from your XRL.  XT350s are all kick-only; TWs were kick-only in the 80s, then dual start for a while and are now electric-only. If you like accessories, the XT uses a separate AC winding to run the lights and has very little DC power. The TW has a standard 12VDC electrical system.  Both bikes are virtually indestructible. I'd also recommend considering the XT225/250--similar to the TW but with ""normal"" tires."

Think traffic, curves, and non-direct routing. It all adds up. I would keep your daily mileage below 500 or below 9 hours.

CDI units are a bigger pain in the ass, since they are not user serviceable, and cost a bunch. Still, I don't know a bike with a CDI unit that isn't capable of making it burn out without warning."

Cutting down on the vibration seems to keep them from dying prematurely. The carbs are a bitch to get at, but once they're adjusted it's not like you will need to get at them frequently. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, I have all the records since new on mine, so I can look back for particular issues."

The fact is a motorcycle can go up practically a vertical wall with only rear wheel drive, and you aren't gaining anything by spinning the front tire."
Dualsport,38psfq,Dax420,14,Fri Jun 5 23:54:36 2015 UTC,That's a very limited view of the technology. There are many advantages to AWD on a motorcycle. Traction control gives you a greater ability  to power through different types of terrain. Worth mentioning also is the extra advantage of enabling power in the front wheel to get out of many situations where your bike might get stuck. I think the video at the 32 sec mark where the rider turns on AWD is a great example. Also it is nice that the AWD can be turn on and off as needed.

If it is shorter, a KLR, 250L, 650L, DR should work well and will do better in the dirt.  I am looking at some longer trips and have heard the above model wear on your butt faster.  The previous owner showed me the receipt of the 12K mile maintenance and it was ~$1,200. You can do it yourself but if you plan to take it to a dealer, be prepared to pay."
Dualsport,38ono7,jester8113,3,Fri Jun 5 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"I went through this exact thought process and I ended up getting a much much newer KLR for about the same price. Where it's your first bike, I would recommend getting something cheap, several parts readily available, and several others that have experience riding the bike. BMW makes a superior machine, but the maintenance/accessories may burn you on the back end with a more expensive bike. Just my 2 cents."
Dualsport,38ono7,AN_OUTRAGE,3,Fri Jun 5 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"I have a 2003 f650cs with 10000 miles on it. It's a great commuter bike with lots of torque. I've always liked the look of the GS Dakar but I was able to find mine for $3000 and I never looked back. It is comfortable and fun to ride. These are decent short range adventure bikes if you want a few days in the Sierras  I can do a lot of my own maintenence, but these bikes are computer controlled, fuel injected, tuned machines. If there are any issues or need for diagnostics then it can become expensive. With all that said I still wouldn't pay $3900 for your first bike.   For your first motorcycle it's a very nice bike, but you will crash or drop it and if you are happy because it looks clean then you will be said if it doesn't.     I had a DRZ-400 and the reason I sold it was lack of dual sport trails close by. I use the BMW for roads and my xr250 for the trails.   My 2 cents. Get something less expensive that won't be afraid to learn and make mistakes on. If something happens and you can't afford to fix it then you have a beautiful garage decoration.   Safe riding"

Very easy to work on.  I did all maintenance myself once the warranty expired (yes bmw maintenance is expensive. $90 for oil change, $250 for a simple service. 650 if they check the valves  ) .   Engine wise you will just need to check the valves and maybe adjust once ever 20k miles.  Maybe.  Water pump impeller needs to be replaced every 10k or so.  Easy too.  Very simple bike to work on.    Off-road it is pretty good much easier to ride than my F800GS now.   I liked it a lot and my boyfriend has a Sertao now.  I still have my 650 and it is my little sisters first bike."

I took mine to South America.  However, it did end up giving me issues.... I had a head gasket go, water pump broke, and as I was somewhere in the middle of nowhere and didn't notice right away I burnt out the piston rings. Parts are expensive, maintenance... it shouldn't need much. The water pump is a known issue, but wear parts shouldn't be anymore than the KLR.  Overall... great bike, has great mileage, and it is small enough that it is still somewhat nimble for some light trail riding with the right tires."
Dualsport,38ono7,deus216,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"I've had this bike for several years, the latest model. All in all it's great. No problems apart from the battery that needs replacing, which is probably my fault for not putting it on a trickle charger.  I used it for several years as a daily commuter, in the city. Also taken it all over Europe, in to Morocco and further in to Africa. And I've joined some enduro clubs on days out on single trail. Those guys loved it, couldn't believe a bike that bike could keep up with them. In Morocco I was with a bunch of 1200's and never had problems keeping up with them on twisty roads.  The only time when it doesn't shine is on the highway. With an ""adventure"" helmet, the wind catches your head & neck so hard that it becomes really unpleasant. I don't know, I guess it lacks aerodynamics?  Never got it serviced at a BMW place but here in Belgium any garage charges you up the ass.   ABS and heated grips are nice. Those panniers are quit costly, so looks like a good deal.   Especially in the US people rave about a KLR so it must be a good bike. However you'll have a hard time finding something sexier than the F650GS Dakar."
Dualsport,38ono7,octave1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:19:36 2015 UTC,Seat height might be a bit high for some people not used to putting a toe down.   Otherwise the 650 Rotax motor offers good power and reliability. Like another guy said the water pump is the thing to watch for every 10k. The Dakar is a great ride and you will enjoy it for years.

Dualsport,38ono7,FullFiguredRhino,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"My first ""real"" bike was, and 5 years later, remains a 2001 F650GS.  There are some differences between the GS and the Dakar, but they are relatively minor.  I absolutely love my bike.  I commute almost exclusively except for very cold or snowy days (Colorado front range), and have also made several trips to the left coast on it.  You can haul a shocking amount of stuff with relative ease, and commute in traffic just as easily.  IIRC I paid 5000 for mine, it had just under 20k miles and came with ABS, heated grips, and a full compliment of GIVI bags, so the price your quoting seems about right, maybe a tad high.  The BMW is a great, reliable, comfortable bike, and I love mine.  I'm an aircraft mechanic by training and I do all of my own maintenance.  I can't speak for BMW shop rates, but I can tell you that BMW does think an awful lot of their parts, so don't expect them to be cheap.  The water pump is a know issue.  I've replaced it once when I had to do the head gasket (my own fault, not a BMW issue).  Another comment called it easy, and either I did something wrong, or I have a very different definition of easy.  That job sucks.  Check the forks carefully, I don't recall if the Dakar had beefier forks vs. the GS or not, but there is a somewhat controversial issue of cracking around the lugs for the front wheel on some of the earlier models.  IMHO, and some here may disagree, but ABS should be mandatory not just on all bikes, but especially for new riders.  This is actually why I would't recommend a KLR.  Yes, the KLR is a great bike, that can do damn near anything and hardly cost you a thing, and has TONS of farkles to go with, but I just can't in good faith suggest a bike without ABS to a new rider.  Be sure to check out F650.com for all things F650GS, CS, and Dakar related.  Super helpful and knowledgeable group people who can tell you more than you ever wanted to know about the bike."

Dualsport,38kcry,wagigkpn,2,Fri Jun 5 15:24:35 2015 UTC,The reason the bark busters are rounded at the edge is so brush and trees smoothly pass by without catching and tweaking your bars. A tree will come full stop on that bolt and wrench your bars out of your hands. Granted if your not actually using the bark busters for what they are intended then it's not a problem.
Dualsport,38kcry,number_e1even,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"dude that bolt is 1 1/2 inches wide at most, it would bump a tree but not hook in and crash the bike."

Dualsport,38jlr9,redszitall,4,Thu Jun 4 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"Professional editor here!  I use Avid primarily for work stuff, but honestly it is a bit of a chore to set up, learn, and maintain (especially for a novice at a home setup). Not to mention expensive, if you go the legal route. It is what we use on everything at our studio, features primarily. The reason we use it is that it transcodes all footage on import, so after importing there is never any worry about formats, frame rates, etc. Everything is transcoded to the same proprietary format (MXF). Avid is not great at dealing with non-standard frame rates though (think high frame rate or non-broadcast frame rates). You're very limited to what you can edit at. Since we deal in features primarily this isn't an issue (24 fps).  The best software package for 'pro-sumers' (the mid-range step between professional and consumer) would be Adobe's Creative Suite, but it isn't cheap either. Adobe has gone to a subscription model now though, and instead of paying up front for the entire cost, you pay monthly ($30/mo I believe). This is great if you need it randomly, and you just want to buy it for a month. Personally, I've just stuck with CS6, as it was the last version without subscription. Adobe Premier is the editing suite offered with Adobe's Creative Suite, but you also get Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator, etc. All of which I use almost daily for work and personal projects. Most of the time, I actually use Adobe in conjunction with Avid. This is primarily because I know Avid well, and am most comfortable with it. Not to mention I like it.  Most editors use either Avid or Premier, with some still holding onto Final Cut Pro 7. Avid and Premier are cross-platform, meaning they run on Mac and PC, and FCP7 is Mac only. FCP7 also does not get updates anymore, and for the most part is completely abandoned by Apple. Premier has definitely filled the gap that FCP7 left, most freelance and non-professionals I know use it.  Hope there's some useful information in there for you. I think Premier is probably your best bet, as it is the most user friendly and versatile. Don't expect to just jump in and start cutting though, the learning curve is still fairly steep. Learning all of the tools and their purposes is the first step.   Good luck!"

Dualsport,38jlr9,Jeemdee,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:25:03 2015 UTC,I'd go for Adobe Premiere. All the tools you'll probably need and an intuitive workflow which talks with other programs like After Effects and Photoshop.

Dualsport,38dilg,WakingJoker,5,Wed Jun 3 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"It's a 99, have you taken out the carb and cleaned it? Does acceleration feel linear? How is the clutch, is it slipping at all?  I mean, the things a pig and will need some more convincing than a DR-Z to get up in the air. I own a DR, and my girlfriend owns a DR-Z SM. Her SM feels sooo much lighter and quicker than my pig of a DR. That being said, I haven't lofted the wheel on either yet.  Performance: Cut the airbox, jet kit, exhaust. Those are the performance mods unless you get a pumper or start opening the engine and putting a new cam, crank, high comp piston, big bore...etc."
Dualsport,38dilg,crazed98camaro,2,Wed Jun 3 14:59:34 2015 UTC,I have a ktm FCR carb that will fit on the bike but it seems like a lot of work to get it up and running. Clutch is fine but it has been sitting around for a while so a carb cleaning might do it some good.
Dualsport,38dilg,VFR8,2,Wed Jun 3 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"I have an '02 and have ridden DRZ400s.  The DR650 should feel much more powerful and wheelie effortlessly in 1st, easily in 2nd, and possible in third.  Mind you that 3rd on a DR650 is a little different than 3rd on a DRZ.  3rd is good for like 50-60 mph with your gearing.   Anyway.  Look into opening the airbox, rejetting the carb and getting free flowing exhaust on there.  The DR is a wheelie machine when running correctly.  I personally have an opened up airbox, KN filter, FCR39 carb set up like MXROB, and a 2001 GSXR750 muffler.   This set up is good for a true 100 MPH and wheel loft power wheelies in 2nd gear without even trying.  I run 14/42 gearing BTW"

What you can't see in the photo is a 30' drop 8' in front of me. I had to put on the brakes in the middle of that sticky skeg. After a three mile walk out from the river valley I found a kind farmer and his son to pull me out with their quad. It was the height of the seeding season so they went way out of their way to yank me out. I'm actually going to stop by their farm this Friday and give them a dinner for four gift certificate at a nice local restaurant.

Dualsport,3889ep,darknexus,3,Tue Jun 2 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the reason you went down was because you chopped the throttle coming out of that mud puddle and transferred all the weight of the bike rapidly to the front tire.  Looks like that caused the wheel to veer into the side of the rut and you lost the front end.  Also you said you were ""going a little too fast.""  I think you were actually going a little too slow, momentum and speed can make easy work of that kind of stuff.  When in doubt, throttle out!"
Dualsport,3889ep,darknexus,2,Tue Jun 2 22:17:53 2015 UTC,Chopping throttle where I did certainly didn't help matters.  I think I would have been better off just staying in the rut instead of my half assed (failed) attempt to climb out.  Thanks for the tips!

Dualsport,3889ep,Coyote-Morado,2,Tue Jun 2 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"I too ran the 270's, but only once. They clog up badly and don't clean well at all. I've tried a bunch of different combos on my DRZ400 and I stick to full DOT knobbies now. I now run a Pirelli Scorpion front with a Kenda K760 rear. (Tried the 760 front, head shake at speed on pavement)   I have never lost it on pavement with this setup and they last a decent length. Plus, the Kenda rear is pretty cheap. I buy two rears per front."

I live in AZ which has 1000's of miles of dirt roads that can be explored, but your bike needs to be road licensed to ride on them. To be road licensed the bike needs a headlight, but there is no DOT headlight requirement.  That is the goal here, not to actually ride the bike on the street at night. Just to be able to explore the back roads of AZ or to ride to a trail head."

Dualsport,383p1z,Balugasnap1992,2,Tue Jun 2 14:07:19 2015 UTC,"Wish Suzuki still made these.. they could be sold in the states since these are only 50cc.   The moto inspired frames were large - but the engines were tiny like a scooter.    So much is put on the larger and mid size bike market, but there are virtually no entry level bikes like this (ones that a teenager working part time jobs could realistically buy with their own money)."
Dualsport,383p1z,stickyricebndt,2,Mon Jun 1 17:06:29 2015 UTC,There's a lot of 50cc dualsport/supermoto's we don't get that I'd ride for sure.
Dualsport,383p1z,faxfinn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:10:37 2015 UTC,My step brother had one like those. Probably the easiest bike in the world to steal as it had a very puny steering lock and you only had to disconnect one easy accessible wire under the tank to hot-wire it...
Dualsport,383p1z,desker,3,Mon Jun 1 18:01:25 2015 UTC,XR650L takes about 3 minutes and a 25 amp switch. Source: We let some asshole store his in the shop and he parked it in the middle with the steering lock engaged.
Dualsport,383wii,Weebs750,3,Mon Jun 1 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're missing bourbon. It packs small. You'll sleep even better after a long day if riding. Mix with your vicodin and you're set.   Also, I'd suggest something that covers the toes, rather than flip flops. You might not want to wear your boots after you get to camp and are walking around. But tree roots can be a bitch with open toes. Source: I'm an eagle scout. Low top chucks pack small, as do the water shoe type teva/keen/etc sandals.  Oh and rotopax mount. I hope you don't have that Kilpin knock off mount. Mine made it from KC up to Glacier and then down the CDT to just inside of NM before it jettisoned my 2 gallons spare fuel."
Dualsport,383wii,number_e1even,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:09:34 2015 UTC,I have a Kolpin mount that I'm using for my rotopax. looks like I'll be changing that out! Luckily 4wheel parts has them locally.   It seems very solid as is. I ran a couple wraps of duct tape around it to soak up the slop.   Hello fellow Eagle scout :) You're totally right about shoes. At the very least a pair of chucks can be tied onto the gas can to avoid bag space.
Dualsport,383wii,number_e1even,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:38:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I should go to more detail. Do you have the one that is like a giant L-bracket? That's what I had. It was bolted to my rear rack, under my seahorse case then the rotopax was out over the tail light. It snapped off along the bolt slots. It wasn't the actual spin mount piece. So, it depends on how it was mounted.   If you have the same, I'd say you could risk it, but my Kolpin fuel can did break on the short fall. Yeah, I'm lucky I didn't start a fire and burn down a national forest. By the time I realized it fell and backtracked to find it, it had already emptied.   About the shoes I strap mine on top my Wolfman soft saddle bags and it works really well, if the shoes are OK to get wet."
Dualsport,383wii,FullFiguredRhino,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:49:30 2015 UTC,Ohh mine is more of the cam lock style. I might still go get the actual rotopax mount because it's more of a proper fit. I updated the original post with a picture of the bike loaded up so you can see how I have the spare gas mounted
Dualsport,383wii,FullFiguredRhino,2,Tue Jun 2 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"Ditch the 'rear' tube. Buy another 21. You can stuff a big tube into a small tire, but not the other way around. Also maybe get a tire iron that has an axle wrench on the end. Saves weight, and space."

Dualsport,383wii,desker,2,Tue Jun 2 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"I've done chunks of Oregon and Washington backcountry discovery routes a couple of years ago and all I can think of to add would be some lightweight  jumper cables (or wire to use as makeshift cables in a pinch) and a small strap that could be used to tow a dead bike. Maybe an offline gps map app for your phone to have as a backup.  And don't forget a camera!  Most important thing is just to go into it ready for an adventure - even if the ""adventure"" is being stuck in the middle of nowhere with a broken bike a day or two in and working together to come up with some kind of creative solution that gets you and your stuff back to civilization. Journey not the destination yadda yadda.   PS - I always recommend AAA if you do a lot of road trips. Mine pays for itself nearly every year. You need the +RV to cover bike towing."
Dualsport,383wii,LimecatApproves,2,Mon Jun 1 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"Whoops, yeah I forgot to add straps. I've got that on another list.   I hadn't considered jumper cables though. I'll throw in 2 long lengths of wire.  We have topo maps for the whole trips but not the offical OBDT ones. The price they're asking is painful... probably worth it though."

Dualsport,381l1x,Ragdollbjz,3,Mon Jun 1 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"Ya it does well on the road.  For reference a bit ago I rode the continental divide trail.  I got fresh tires for it, rode north from boulder, colorado to Canada on trail and back on the interstate and still had enough life on the rear to ride a few hare scrambles and trails for another six or eight months before finally figuring it was time, honestly could've gotten some more miles out of it.    Taking interstate from Canadian border to boulder took us two full days on our 250s and my ass was sore at the end, but I'm pretty sure that would've been the case regardless of tire choice."

I had no idea what it meant. About the time that I started to maybe figure it out, the pavement ended and I hit the gravel still doing 75mph. An unloaded pickup at 75mph on washboard gravel is enough to make a young airman pee a little.

When I had the CRFL, Wolfman Luggage was still selling these racks for both bikes. Their supplier drop out so they stopped selling them.

Gives you oil temp, outside air temp (which wasn't always accurate, but hell), and you get a speedometer. You can also program the thing with the odometer miles that you started with if you want.

I'm sure you are aware, but you will be dropping it, revving the balls off it and generally abusing it.   Basic things like bolts not shearing or coming loose aren't a given on Chinese bikes at the best of times and on tarmac, let alone going over baby head rocks. The metal generally isn't as good quality as it should be.   What I'm trying to say is that I'd happily have a road going sumo Chinese bike (Sinnis Apache, Pulse Adrenaline etc) but wouldn't take it off road in any serious way.  Take a look at which brands actually compete (and are competitive) in enduro events and you will have a good idea which are worth while.

It's a thing you have to feel for yourself to understand.   Standing still is a different story. You really feel the extra 200lbs walking the bike around.

Dualsport,37ivqv,Pugnax88,2,Thu May 28 03:39:25 2015 UTC,Yea it started popping a little more during deceleration so I adjusted the mixture a little and now it seems to run fine.
Dualsport,37ivqv,downhillcarver,1 point,Thu May 28 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"Cool, glad you're having good results! People often fault the KLR on it's lack of power, but on the flip side the fact that it's so detuned lets you get away with doing mods like this without stressing too much. Mine pops a bit on deceleration as well, but I also have it set a little lean as I was doing some high altitude rides a while back. Great job on the bike btw, looks great!"

The last thing I want to do is a #130 main jet and needle shim mod.  It'll do 70 if I want it to, but it sounds like nuts and bolts in a blender. Seems real happy at 55-60. Awesome (even with the TW203/204 tires) on the trails. Fantastic bike all around. Once it's a few years old and I've damaged the plastics, I'll remove them and do the hollow mod like this fella did."

What would make them favorable over the more normal looking dual sports/dirt bikes for trail riding?   They're really an ATV with two wheels. I wouldn't want one for trail riding, but I almost got one for a hunting rig. They'd also be awesome for taking on a backwoods day trip/camping trip. Tons of room for gear, low, and easy to handle.   Where's the demand for it?   They're touted as a ""good starter bike."" They're a little lethargic, but they're easy to ride, and will conquer just about any terrain.   I like the fat rear tire.   The front tire on these is actually a rear sized tire. Moon bikes!"

Dualsport,37hbsk,Mentioned_Videos,1 point,Wed May 27 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"It's always a little hard to judge really how bad a trail is from these helmet cam vids.  The perspective always makes it look like you'll fly into an infinite void if you sneeze.  I can imagine riding a trail like the one you posted under certain circumstances.   IF it was a section of a much longer ride that I wanted to make anyways.  I wouldn't go just ride that kind of shit all by itself, but I would brave it instead of letting it be an obstacle I refused to pass. I would go as slow as I needed to in order to feel comfortable. Depending on conditions, even going quite slow might look a lot faster than it actually is when seen on a helmet cam. When you're comfortable, really experienced on your bike, you might actually be just as stable, and actually as safe as you would be walking.  It depends.  I understand the fear."
Dualsport,37iren,parttimeninja,3,Wed May 27 22:51:34 2015 UTC,Personally I think so. I used to have a 650 Honda dual sport and never liked if off road except larger dirt paths. I now have a Honda xr400 and would not want anything larger in the dirt. I just got the xr Street legal and it is a bit slow on the street  but I'm about so change sprocket sizes and think that it will be fine.
Dualsport,37iren,XR400,3,Wed May 27 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"Are you me? I just came here to post the same question!

For a little input my sister has a Yamaha XT250 and it's fun on the trails and I can literally pick it up and carry it. However, I'd go for a 400cc minimum if you wanna have fun.

Dualsport,37iren,BraapTasticMotoVlog,3,Fri May 29 01:16:12 2015 UTC,"The drz is still sort of a compromise that might not be as agile as you want for tight trails.  If you really want a more capable single-track bike,  look at at a WR (250 or 450) or a KTM EXC350.  Not sure if they're hard to make Street legal in NJ, but if you can,  they are excellent for the woods.   Size - wise,  yes there's a huge difference between the KLR and the drz.  Performance - wise,  not as much as you might expect."
Dualsport,37iren,A_ron,3,Thu May 28 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say, if you really want something for trails, go with a 250 or 350. I just bought a Yamaha WR250r and it's quite light. Fun on the dirt/sand and still usable on the highway. I can crawl along trails or run 110kph (70mph) on the asphalt..."

Dualsport,37ffpa,DumbFuckingUsername,1 point,Wed May 27 06:03:32 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering about dirtbikes with Rally/Dakar fairings. How do you like it? Does it removes a lot of wind? Also, how did it change your riding conditions while riding on hi-ways/long distances?"
Dualsport,37ffpa,Spoooooooooooooky,2,Wed May 27 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"Well I just got the fairing on a couple weeks ago but I'm loving it so far. It does re-direct a lot of wind but it's not perfect for all heights/speeds/winds. Currently I get a bit of buffeting right about the goggle height so it can get a bit annoying at higher speeds with just the right wind speed. I think I'm going to try and add on a small piece to the top of the fairing to help re-direct that air up an inch or two, that should make things just perfect.  It definitely cuts the air on your body as is, but since you get used to that clean air hitting the helmet, any little bit of buffeting is super noticeable. I'd say it's currently great at 80km/h or so, especially on backroads with more closed in trees. That's where it feels best right now, and luckily that's what I like to ride the best. I prefer 80-90km/h rather than 100-110km/h open highways anyways. But I'd like to extend the top enough to make it a little less annoying at those speeds. Even a little visor thing at the top that couple angle the air up a little bit more.  Hopefully that helps, let me know if you've got any more specific questions."
Dualsport,37ffpa,Spoooooooooooooky,1 point,Thu May 28 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"awesome thanks for the reply! I was just thinking about that most dual sport bikes are pretty crappy offroad because of the weight, and most offroad bikes are crappy because of the long distance riding.   adding the fairing and some other minor tweaks (seat? gearing?) might make a dirtbike a great lightweight long-distance dual sport machine?"
Dualsport,37ffpa,desker,2,Thu May 28 13:24:40 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, my last bike was a Super Tenere and though it was extremely comfortable and I loved it, it opened the doors to three trails for me and I reached a point where it was limiting for sure. People who are really skilled can still throw the big bikes around pretty good but they definitely make it harder to learn the offroad skills at the beginning. I decided to give up some comfort and highway stability to get more out of the bike offroad and on trails. I think with some well placed wind protection, some extra fuel and some other little tweaks, something like a 690 can be a formidable all around weapon. If you lean to even more single track then maybe something smaller like as 500 exc but then that nice balance slips a little further away from highway. I think there's no perfect bike for everything, but in my mind the 690 is a great balance point and it really is incredible offroad and still holds plenty of power in reserve at the highway speeds I like to ride at. A big defining factor for longer trips can be maintenance interval and that's where something like the 690 is just enough of a real bike engine to not have super short dirtbike-like maintenance intervals."

Full kit: ram-b-149z-ga48u  or if you buy separately, the ubolt mount ram-b-149zu, and the eTrex holder ram-hol-ga48u  As for maps, I just used garmin.openstreetmap.nl to generate a free map of the area I intend on riding in. I prefer the ""Generic Routable (new style)"" map type, and it included a lot of my local trails. Get a microSD card to put your maps on and you'll be set. Being able to select a specific area will keep the map size small.  And I was lucky that my local trail association actually publish the .gdb of our trails. I just copied it to my GPS using BaseCamp.  Another option for maps is www.openmapchest.org."

Dualsport,379rpz,Dr_Monkee,3,Tue May 26 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"I  would say that whichever is further from the recommended spring rate would be the one to do first. Sounds like that might be the rear for your situation.    Otherwise, you have to determine which is more of a problem/weakness for you when you ride now.  I think the rear tends to impact the overall ride, while the front is more critical for control and stability."
Dualsport,379rpz,TwoMinuteMinor,1 point,Tue May 26 03:29:27 2015 UTC,"So i'll feel more of a difference from replacing the rear first you say?  Which will affect the ride the most?  Also, can i just buy the spring or do i need to buy valves or seals, bearings or anything else?  is the spring just enough?"
Dualsport,379rpz,TwoMinuteMinor,2,Tue May 26 04:28:38 2015 UTC,"I think Dirt_Bike_Zero already answered your question about rear vs front pretty well.  Yes, changing the rear spring will have a more noticeable effect on the overall ride and ""feel"" of the bike.  As for re-valving - that is really just a matter of what the stock valves can handle. If you're not changing the spring rates too dramatically, then the stock valves will probably be fine. If the stock valves are inherently weak, or if you're a heavier rider making a larger change to the spring rate, then you would need to revalve or replace the shock, too, to cope properly with the heavier spring.  I can tell from experience as a heavier rider that I once changed the springs in the front forks on a street bike, but I couldn't afford to get the forks re-valved, and the result was twitchy front-end response. If I manually compressed the front forks, the rebound would literally bounce the front wheel off the ground - and that was with the damping set as high as it would go. I probably would have been better off with the all-stock, softer setup.  So... you could change just the springs, but there are limits to how far you can change them effectively. And as others said, the numbers/calculators are just guidelines. For the best results, talk to a suspension specialist so you can explain how you ride and what you are trying to accomplish."

Dualsport,379rpz,metal_fever,2,Tue May 26 04:25:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert but a lot of things point to the front fork being the most important. I did a visit to a Kayaba center for a school project a few weeks ago (KYB is the popular brand in the MXGP and they did the adjustment for the MXGP riders, they are also rising with the onroad models (new R1 and H2).  Front suspension has a huge impact on cornering and most adjustments there are done on the front suspension, rear suspension is mostly left alone. If I would follow my own logic I would look to a mountain bike, they usually have only a front suspension so that would also make me think front is most important."
Dualsport,379rpz,metal_fever,1 point,Tue May 26 04:43:37 2015 UTC,Actually any serious mountain bike has a full suspension. also you're talking about street bikes that's a completely and entirely different sport and trail or enduro riding.

Like I said I'm not an expert when it comes to suspension but from what I experienced from my project about suspension and the visit to the KYB center was that the front was still the most important in the motocross. I might not be the best to follow advise from though because I'm still pretty unknowledgeable about suspension."
Dualsport,379rpz,desker,1 point,Tue May 26 13:31:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, any time you see a redbull or downhill mountain bike video.  or you see people doing serious downhill races, they're on a full suspension.  i'm also just doing trail/enduro riding not motocross so i dont need to hammer any turns super hard.  i do ride single track, but thats like 1/5 rides.    i'm going to probably end up doing both rear and front but i'm just curious which i should do first.  or is it like, if i do one i have to do the other because the bike will be all out of whack."
Dualsport,379rpz,desker,2,Tue May 26 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"True, MX is still different then simple enduro/trail riding. Can't you ask for more info with your supplier? I also don't think you need to change both at the same time, I would still do front first since I think enduro/trail riding falls in between MX and road riding where front suspension is the most important."

Dualsport,379rpz,Dirt_Bike_Zero,2,Tue May 26 16:27:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of riding you do. Are you jumping or doing gnarly single track? Are you bottoming out because you are a fat bastard? What exactly is your GOALS here. Suspension is about tuning to YOUR NEEDS, not what a genetic online calculator says. Are you racing or just goofing off? Optimum for someone is too stiff for someone else.  Have you played with compression and rebound? Try a different weight of fork oil, or the adjusted fork oil level (maks a bigger difference than you think). A higher fork oil level causes an air pressure increase, giving you more spring rate closer to the end of travel. This gives you a more progressive spring rate. Great for single track/trail bikes that are bottoming out. Too much and your fork seals blow out, so don't get greedy here. Too stiff a spring on trail bikes beats you up, you want mushy suspension.   Also, high speed cameras are available now. The iphone 6+does 240fps. I even have a crappy casio that does 1000fps (I use it for tuning high speed process machines). Try shooting the wheels going over a bunch of whoops and bumps. Tinker with compression and rebound, try again. Observe what is going on. Wheel hopping? Give compression a click or two and film again. Bring tools so you can adjust the rear spring preload too. Bring a laptop and a set of calipers. Play the video on the laptop, pause during critical wheel hop or compression momments and measure the gaps on the screen. Adjust, measure again. Take very detailed notes. Write down what you FEEL first, then measure/record numbers.  (i am 10 years out of date working on dirtbike suspension, assuming suspension is the same)"

In fact unless I'm way out in the desert and its pitch black I cant even tell when I turn it on since the Rigid is so bright. When I can tell its on the beam only adds maybe two feet to each side of the rigid beam for the first maybe 5 feet, after that the rigid over powers it.

Not liking the looks is what is keeping me from dropping $100 on a better light for the high beam.  knowing that the high beam isn't that important in my setup and I want a housing I have been looking at the Squadron sport or pro headlight in the polisport housing but I cant seem to find any real world reviews about it. Mostly just advertising threads and a few people who said it was bright.here is an example on a xr"

Dualsport,375yh1,mattfromtelevision,1 point,Mon May 25 19:13:54 2015 UTC,Cool! Do you know what the difference between the rm & DRZ400SM forks is?
Dualsport,375yh1,Leonardj4,2,Mon May 25 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on the year for each, but I'm not really sure of the specifics. I think the SM forks are similar on the outsides but the RM 250 forks have different internals, different diameter tubing, and I believe slightly more travel. Mine have little buttons at the top of each leg to release pressure that builds up, but I think that's an aftermarket addition."

Dualsport,375xz0,jim313,2,Mon May 25 11:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard about that too, I guess procycle makes a mid pipe for that set up so you don't have to fabricate much. I'd like to keep it pretty quiet, just let it breath better and make it sound a bit throatier."
Dualsport,375xz0,gisdood,1 point,Mon May 25 13:15:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the GSXR/'Busa pipe option is the best fit for what you want.  Even the FMF Q4 is a substantially louder than stock, and the decel pop is obnoxious (if you're still running the BST carb).   The Gixxer pipe is getting harder and harder to find, but the Hayabusa stocker option is pretty widely available still.  Procycle and Keintech both sell great midpipe/bracket sets for either option."
Dualsport,375xz0,gisdood,2,Mon May 25 18:57:27 2015 UTC,Stock carb but I've done the jetting and airbox mod. Will it still pop like crazy on decell with the q4 even with proper jetting?
Dualsport,375xz0,mercenario27,1 point,Mon May 25 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"The popping is not going away with the BST.  Even in stock jetting, it would pop with a louder can on, the stocker just does a great job of masking it.  Its just an operational characteristic of a CV carb.  The stock muffler just does a great job of muting it.   The GSXR and Hayabusa cans both do a good job at bringing that harsh pop down to a nice throaty gurgle, tho... more than tolerable noise levels.  *Edited to add - my initial modded setup was running a Q2 which is likely not as quiet as the Q4, but it was loud enough that I seriously disliked riding without earplugs even on short commutes.

Dualsport,36xlx7,mhuff45,2,Fri May 22 23:27:02 2015 UTC,Slather a bolt in some silicone and turn it in if you're worried.
Dualsport,36xlx7,desker,1 point,Sat May 23 00:46:54 2015 UTC,Yes your frame will rust from the inside out. How fast that happens depends on your environment. If i were you i would SERIOUSLY consider putting a bolt in there. cover the threads in grease so it doesn't rust and torque it down. If it were my bike i would also spray some CPC like Fluid Film before i put the bolt in. I work on helicopters in a marine environment and we spray that shit on everything to stop corrosion.

Dualsport,36t0gg,shaggypants,2,Thu May 21 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"Took my first dip in the water hole pictured above today, went over on the left side.  Got it home, charged the battery, it now rolls over but won't catch.  Other symptoms: neutral light seems to be stuck on. Feels sluggish when trying to roll it in gear with the clutch in. All other electronics seem to be working fine.  I have the service manual, but am still new to the motorcycle maintenance game. Any tips for troubleshooting or possible solutions? Just getting it to start would be a win at this point.  Total time in water probably 20 sec or less, didn't submerge the gas tank but I can't absolutely rule out water entering the tank."
Dualsport,36t0gg,JLD333,3,Thu May 21 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"Check your air box, if it got wet then you will need to pull and dry your air filter.   If that got wet you may have sucked water into the cylinder.   Pull your spark plug, and turn your motor over by hand or by the starter.   If water shoots out then you know water got in.  Water in the cylinder can cause all kinds of problems like bending valves and blowing holes in pistons.  If you do get it to fire,  since your working on it,  I'd change your oil."
Dualsport,36t0gg,JLD333,1 point,Thu May 21 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, the air box was filled with water. Just pulled the plug and turned it over, there does appear to be water in there. Best bet for getting it out? Shop vac with a small nozzle?"
Dualsport,36t0gg,JLD333,2,Fri May 22 18:50:37 2015 UTC,"Just crank it over with the spark plug removed.  I'd put a new or dry airfilter on before you start the process.  It shouldn't take long to get the water out of the cylinder.   Reinstall your spark plug,  turn your motor over by hand to make sure , one you have removed enough water to prevent hydro locking,  and two to check and see if your connecting rod is still straight.  It will be some what hard to turn (put your bike and gear and spin the back wheel by hand,  while your bike is on a stand) but you should never feel and binding.   If it doesn't feel right and you sucked that much water into the air box,  you may not like what happened to your engine..."
Dualsport,36t0gg,danhalen1,1 point,Fri May 22 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"Stuck a shop vac in the opening and cranked it until dry; due to the vertical orientation of the plug it kind of creates a self-feeding fountain, water spurts out but largely just falls straight back in. With the help of some starter fluid I got her running, and she starts first try every time now. I haven't been able to turn the back wheel by hand, but when I slowly engage the clutch in first gear it rolls smoothly.  Trying to change the oil now, but apparently every stock bolt and screw is made of a play dough alloy, so I'm having to drill out the drain bolt and use an easy out tool to remove it."

Maybe a shallow water crossing or bombing through some mud puddles or anything?  Although, I live in the darn desert, so it's not like I'd get it wet very often anyway.  Also, is the interface pretty intuitive, or is it a pain to cycle through the information?  Lastly, can you use the hour meter as a clock, so you can tell how much time you have to play before going to work?"

Got a little condensation showing up inside the outer glass but it kept running just fine.    The interface isn't immediately intuitive, but its fairly simple to figure out.  Once its all set up, you have three default modes that you can cycle through, one of which shows the actual time, and another shows run time.    All in all, I've found it to be a huge upgrade from the stock speedo, very versatile and useful, definitely worth the expense.  **Edited to add installed photo"

Ray took us on ""one of the easier rides"" and it kicked my ass. We made it, but damn.

Dualsport,36gax7,Dr_Monkee,2,Tue May 19 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"No. That's adding another 18 watts into your high beam circuit. Now, what you can do is run a lead to the switch, allowing that switch to turn on and off the light. You will wire the light to a 12V source (aka directly to the battery for simplicity). Use a relay and a fuse for the light as well."

Dualsport,36gax7,desker,2,Tue May 19 13:27:45 2015 UTC,im running the stock headlight.  my question is more so about the actual installation.  is what i stated correct?  where i just clip the line and wire the led bar into the clipped line and then just solder or twist it all back up together and done?

Dualsport,36gax7,swaggler,1 point,Tue May 19 07:10:12 2015 UTC,I doubt you can add 18W to a high-beam circuit. You'll need to use a relay. You need a professional to install it.
Dualsport,36gax7,pauly7,1 point,Tue May 19 10:42:07 2015 UTC,"You should be able to just tap it in, but it isn't advisable. The headlight wires are already running close to 70w, and the wires should be able to handle that and more without heating up too much, BUT it is always advisable to wire lights up via a relay.   If you just tap into the headlight wires, and something goes wrong on a ride, you may lose all lights. Not ideal if you are 60-miles from home at 11pm. If you wire them in using a relay triggered by the headlight wires, you vastly reduce the chance of ending up blind in the middle of nowhere... if the LEDs fail catastrophically, you still have your main headlight."

Dualsport,36eska,Dr_Monkee,1 point,Mon May 18 20:47:01 2015 UTC,Be sure to check the manufacturer's measurements for the tire if available.  A 120 can be quite different between brands.  Also for some tires there can be clearance issues with the mudguard if you try and run a slightly larger size.  A 4.00-18 will fit the rear rim.  I have a IRC tr8 in that size on my wr250r now.
Dualsport,36eska,BishopDMJ,1 point,Mon May 18 22:40:55 2015 UTC,Sick with what you run stock.  Sure you can put on wider tires but that makes the tires especially curved which will reduce performance and increase ware  down the middle
Dualsport,36eska,SenorTylerDurden,0,Sat May 23 08:58:50 2015 UTC,Measure the rim width. I have a ktm 500 exc I can fit a 150 wide tire on a 3 1/4 inch rim lol

Dualsport,369c2o,LimecatApproves,1 point,Mon May 18 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"The max was 17.9 and since Caribou point (45.764526, -62.680704) is surrounded on three sides by ocean it tends to be several degrees cooler than inland. It hit around 22 at my house on Sat.  Also it's worth adding that we haven't had significant snowfall for at least a month. Snow takes a really long time to melt if it's in the shade and in a thick layer."
Dualsport,369c2o,zigzaghd,1 point,Mon May 18 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"You presume that snow only exist when is under 0 and completly evaporate or turn in water the minute the weather hit 1. But, here in Canada, when we receive a couple of meters of snow in the winter, it's take some time for the snow to melt in the spring."

Dualsport,36ap12,gmailangel,1 point,Sat May 23 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"KTM 450 or 500 EXC is an excellent choice.  It has plenty to power to make it exciting.    My advice on gear is good boots, knee and elbow protection, gloves and a helmet at a minimum.  If you are pushing your limits, real riding pants.  The goal is to not go down on the street though.    You should take a riding instruction class to get the basics before you buy anything for yourself though.  1st things 1st."
Dualsport,36ap12,Dirt_Bike_Zero,1 point,Mon May 18 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, im in the military so there are plenty of rules and things that go along with riding on base, like all personal protective equipment is required. helmet, gloves, goggles (if not full face), boots that at least cover your ankles, a bright neon vest (like ones that construction workers wear) and that is the minimum, not to mention all of the basic courses to be able to legally ride one, but a military course as well :)   I shouldnt be pushing my limits for awhile, but i appreciate the advice on the pants! What about shirt/jacket? i dont intend on hitting the freeway with my bike often, hopefully not at all if i can avoid it as the drivers here are terrible. so i shouldnt take any falls above 45mph.  I am all for investing into quality protection. Its way better off to be alive than save a few bucks :P  I appreciate the tips and advice, KTM is definately my favorite brand and they make some very quality bikes! Thats probably the one im gonna keep my eyes on, however for my first bike im just looking to get anything that i decently like the look of and can get pretty cheap (due to the nature of beginners and their first bikes)"
Dualsport,36ap12,Dirt_Bike_Zero,2,Mon May 18 02:24:14 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who's knee has met the pavement before, I won't ride without these knee / shin guards.  http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/39962/i/fly-racing-knee-shin-guard?WT.ac=SLIsearch  They can be worn underneath your jeans or whatever and just take seconds to put on.  I consider it cheap walking insurance.  The only items I feel are more important gear-wise are helmet and riding boots.     For gloves, I generally wear 100% rawhide work gloves.  They are very light tan in color and are highly visible when making hand signals, or waving to other riders.  Besides, they're cheap and will protect you from rash as good as anything else.    Jackets are broken down into two main categories - leather and textile.  I personally own a leather jacket and a mesh textile that I wear when it's warm outside.  And dedicated motorcycle jacket will have some elbow armor in it and provide minimal protection in the event of a get-off.  You can decide what type/style is right for you.  You would be smart to just go to a parts and apparel retailer to try some on and see what you like."
Dualsport,36ap12,Dirt_Bike_Zero,1 point,Mon May 18 02:40:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! A lot of really good information here :) Are those the knee/shin gaurds that your knee met pavement in? because that would be impressive! Or are those the ones that now keep your patella from sliding across the road? Ive also seen some pretty good things from that store, do you recommend them (i would assume so because you linked from there, but doesnt hurt to ask)  As for gloves, and other biking gear, as for apparel i really like the company Fox. I know they are a very known company but the ""type"" of gloves that i have in mind are ones like these but in red. Im young and i like colors and flashy, but in the case of needing to be seen thats not always a bad thing!!  On the jackets, ill definately take a look and figure out what i like best, and fittings are always better when you can try them on in person rather than order them online, ill definately take that advice! Much appreciated :)"
Dualsport,36ap12,Dirt_Bike_Zero,2,Mon May 18 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"Those shin guards are very similar to the ones I wear under my pants.  The cheap $15 ones will be infinitely better than not wearing any protection, but you can get whatever style you prefer.  The gloves you linked are dirt racing gloves, they are thin, light and the absolute minimum in protection.  Good for the trails, not so much on the road."
Dualsport,36ap12,professorsyr,1 point,Mon May 18 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"Makes perfectly good sense about the gloves to me, mx and trail gear doesnt seem to be suited for high speed collisions with metal boxes. tis a shame :P Thanks for the tip, ill look for some more heavy duty gloves that will protect me from not being able to count to 10 with my hands :)"

This is what I have, and It has all-ready done some pretty good work in keeping my back in one piece. thou I am not the most careful beginner out there. I tend to go a little too fast for my TT600 and skills on off-road tracks.  Also, I am happy with Yamaha TT600 as my learning bike. Thou I am keeping my eyes on KTM 690 Enduro R.  For first bike I think you should have something that will not make you cry when you are breaking it. (I am going trough my levers at alarming rate).  For good on-road and -off i would suggest having these.  They actually work really good on tarmac and are pretty nice for going off from it. Sadly they do about 6k km on tarmac.   Also remember that I am not a pro but just another beginner. I just wanted to add my two cents."

Dualsport,360y41,pedantic_guccimane,3,Fri May 15 04:14:59 2015 UTC,Just a guess but it looks like that power port mounted to the handlebars has flat connectors on the bottom that are not hooked up. They possibly became disconnected.
Dualsport,360y41,Wezitar,1 point,Fri May 15 12:11:54 2015 UTC,Oh is that a 12vDC adapter mounted there? Nice! I was just wishing I had a power port on this bike. I guess this is what happens when you buy a motorcycle without knowing anything about them.   So those two connectors might attach to the bottom of that power port somewhere?
Dualsport,360y41,Wezitar,1 point,Fri May 15 18:36:23 2015 UTC,Yea they probably just slip onto the flat pieces on the bottom and then you squeeze them with a pair of pliers to attach them
Dualsport,360y41,McGrude,1 point,Fri May 15 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to pull up a wiring diagram from the same year as your KLR.  In some cases you may need to pull up the wiring diagram for the same region it was sold (if there were differences).     My Suzuki DR650 has an unused pair that in some markets were used for parking lights on the front of the bike (or something like that).     Based on what they were intended for, how it is switched, and what rating the fuse has it might be quite useful to power something, such as a cigarette lighter to USB power adapter.  I did that to charge my phone (which I had mounted to my handlebars using a bike phone mount)."
Dualsport,360y41,McGrude,1 point,Fri May 15 04:29:53 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks. I see the residue from something mounted on the bars. Hoping its GPS. I feel like I should at least wrap the exposed metal if I dont connect something to it."
Dualsport,360y41,SithLard,2,Fri May 15 04:53:28 2015 UTC,"Do you have a volt meter?  If so, do this initial test.  With the bike off set the volt meter to the 20 volt range.   Hold the black/negative lead from the volt meter to the frame or some bare metal piece -- the motor is a great one for ground.   Now touch the red/positive lead to one terminal connector and see if it's hot.   If so mark it (like with a piece of tape or something temporary).  Now do the same with the other terminal connector, mark it too if it is hot.   Now turn the bike on and do the same test.     My bet is that one is hot and one is not (it is likely ground) when the bike is on.   For now shield that one ( just tape the end with electrical tape ).  The ground one usually doesn't matter -- the whole bike is basically supposed to be electrically ground.    Based on a second look these connectors are not original (they're flat connectors, while they should be the little bullet ones if they were factory).   Hopefully the person that added these at least used color coded wires ( red for hot, black for ground -- can't see the wire color of one of them in the pic).  If not make sure to keep the hot one labelled.     Trace them back to where they added these to the wiring harness.  Inspect where they were added.  If done right the would at least have soldered the new wires in and correctly protected them with heat shrink tubing or electrical tape (hopefully heat shrink tubing).    If they aren't soldered in then consider doing that, and properly shielding them.    Take note of the color of the wires they had tapped into and now consult the wiring diagram to figure out which circuit they're on and how much current they can provide."

Dualsport,35vxv6,pedantic_guccimane,27,Wed May 13 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"Skid plate is an add on. Exhaust is after market. Possible it was rejetted and/or air filter upgraded when the exhaust was swapped. Other than that it looks like it has non stock tires and of different calibers. Looks like you have a somewhat aggressive off road tire on the rear with a street centered tire in the front. I would consider going with the same pairing of tires. 60/40, 40/60, 80/20, 50/50...whatever your preference, but mate them."
Dualsport,35vxv6,Bernard_schwartz,8,Wed May 13 23:35:05 2015 UTC,Everything this man says is correct.
Dualsport,35vxv6,just_mosin_around,2,Thu May 14 01:11:56 2015 UTC,"thank you both, I want this bike even more now. I'll find out tomorrow if I get it.  The skidplate was something I was going to add. I'll ask about pairing the tires. What disadvantages should I expect from riding with them as they are now?"
Dualsport,35vxv6,Bernard_schwartz,1 point,Thu May 14 02:22:21 2015 UTC,The problem is different tires is that they may respond differently in certain situations. In rain for instance your front tire will grip well while your back tire will just allow water to pass through. In my (limited) experience this creates uneven surface tension so when you feel like front tire will go one way back tire might react differently. I replaced my first set with the shinko 705. Cheap. Long lasting. Good street traction. Decent off road traction. Once your burn through that pair be a bit more picky. I think I picked up my last set for about $110.   Other than that look into crash guards and brush guards if you go off-road. No reason having a busted radiator or cowling when a few hundred dollars could have staved it off. Brush guards keep the levers from breaking if you crash in the back country.
Dualsport,35vxv6,DrRazmataz,1 point,Thu May 14 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I asked the shop from where I'm buying it to install the brush and crash guards. The salesperson seemed hesitant to comply, citing a long waiting period due to the volume of work their garage has. That probably wouldn't bother me, because I've never driven a motorcycle and my MSF course isn't til the weekend after next. Perhaps the real reason was they aren't a kawasaki dealer/r Anyway he agreed to consider a bundle package with some accessories and installation, and said he'd call me back. That was 8hrs ago. Not that I'm concerned.   Its amazing I didn't get into this hobby sooner. I rode pedal BMX everywhere as a kid, including proper BMX tracks sometimes, but loved to just cross town on it. I preferred the nimble, sturdy nature of a 20"" single speed over the bigger, more complex mountain bikes. Reminds me of a scaled down version of comparing the krl vs the big liter+ adventure bikes.   I bookmarked those Shinko 705s on Amazon. They remind me of the Continental TKC 70 which I also have bookmarked. I rode Maxxis on my BMX and loved them, and I'd probably prefer a >80% off road tire, so I'm leaning towards those. Glad to have a legitimate reason to upgrade actually. Other dirt oriented tires I am considering: Continental TKC 80, Pirelli MT 21, and the Kenda K772. People rave about the Pirelli's street performance despite all the knobs. However, there's a youtuber who is very vocal about how the Kenda's never lose lugs (which sounds annoying, I gotta admit).  I had my heart set on a Ducati Hypermotard outfitted with stuff like knobbies and a big tank to make it a long distance adventure bike, but I couldn't deny how illogical that choice would be for my first bike, or in general, so I'm saving that for later.   My long term goal (1yr out or more) is a cross country trip outside the US (hopefully europe) so I'm also trying to think ahead. I just wish the KLR was faster.   TL;DR: thanks for the reply, I will get the brush and crash guards installed. Additionally I will consider your tire recommendation, but I think I want more off road capability than 70%."

Properly jetted, you simply won't notice any significant difference over stock other than noise. Which, depending on the pipe and baffle can be significant.  Particularly on longer trips - the stock exhaust is really, really nice. No drone, no vibes.  The good news is, if you find the aftermarket exhaust annoying - you can easily sell it, or find somebody with a stock setup interested in a swap."

Do a once over, but as a constant, check your chain and tires pretty commonly. Buy chain lube, a rag, and something to clean the chain with (I use kerosene, look up various methods) and be sure to lube the chain up about once a week, and directly after it rains/gets wet. That's bike maintenance 101 :)"

It's a long read, but worth it if you can maintain the interest.  You have a more maintenance intensive bike than most people start with. It could get pretty expensive if you're not willing to do regular things on your own (mostly oil and valves in your case, I think)."
Dualsport,35wus5,ejs989,2,Thu May 14 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be worried less about blowing up the bike in the beginning and more about not understanding how powerful the bike you just purchased really is. That was my first motorcycle purchase as well, and I was 25 when I bought an '09 crf450r. Until you learn the clutch throttle balance, be super careful. Even with stock gearing, on the street, it will be hard to not get that front wheel off the ground. ...and if you don't know what that feels like, you could easily panic to hold on, which means you twist the throttle more, which means your bike now becomes a torpedo. My 2 cents...just be careful, take it slow, and learn your bike first, preferably on dirt.  Once you get it, then plate it and take to the streets.    Good luck...and for mechanical info, go to www.thumpertalk.com forums. Or buy a manual."

Dualsport,35oyle,battle_cattle,1 point,Thu May 14 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"What math are you using? A new 800GS weighs 472 lbs fully fueled, and the 800GSA 505 lbs. If the Africa Twin actually comes in at 440 lbs wet (rumored), that's a difference of 32 lbs and 65 lbs, respectively. However, I have my doubts that this rumored weight is accurate.  Considering the Africa Twin has a larger engine, and Honda has made claims regarding the Africa Twin's weight versus the 1200GS (not the 800GS), I would sooner expect the 440 lbs figure to be the dry weight. Even then, that means the wet weight would be about 470 lbs, which is still 55 lbs lighter than the 1200GS pig (525 lbs).  If the Africa Twin really did come in at 440 lbs wet, why didn't Honda compare the bike to the 800 GS weight-wise? That'd be a much more notable claim, since beating the 1200GS on weight isn't that impressive for a bike carrying a smaller engine."

Dualsport,35oyle,da1hobo,4,Tue May 12 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, my guess is around 475 lbs. Either way it should be a nice touring bike and I do want to test ride it."
Dualsport,35oyle,battle_cattle,3,Tue May 12 14:35:12 2015 UTC,As long as it's under 500 I'll be happy.
Dualsport,35oyle,da1hobo,5,Tue May 12 14:47:48 2015 UTC,That should be a safe bet. I will stick with my 300lbs bike unless I want to slab it.
Dualsport,35oyle,battle_cattle,1 point,Tue May 12 14:56:18 2015 UTC,If you strictly want to ride dirt why not get something considerably smaller?
Dualsport,35oyle,mergeforthekill,2,Thu May 14 00:21:50 2015 UTC,I have one of the lightest production dualsports out there. Only bikes lighter are the 250s (crf and wr) and drz400 is close. Riding between trails on a 250 loaded down isn't the most fun.
Dualsport,35oyle,battle_cattle,2,Thu May 14 01:00:26 2015 UTC,"Very true! Didnt know you were connecting trails, makes a lot more sense then. I take it you've been happy with the bike? Been looking into getting a commuter/bigger bike for longerish motocamping stuff."

Dualsport,35oyle,zalifer,7,Tue May 12 14:01:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I was praying it would be a 750 twin.  Oh well I'm still excited.
Dualsport,35oyle,da1hobo,8,Tue May 12 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Probably get downvoted, but this just looks like another ""too heavy to be a dirtbike, not enough power to be a true adventure bike"" bike."
Dualsport,35oyle,Mr_Donkey,12,Tue May 12 19:11:07 2015 UTC,"I'd agree on the you'll probably get downvoted.   Too heavy to be a dirt bike? Well, it's a liter adventure bike. It's made to haul man and gear over long distances over questionable terrain. That's going to be heavier than a bike designed for one man only over a short distance, and it's going to have a lot of gyroscopic effect as well compared to a dirt bike. It's physics. Even a 150 lbs bike with a 1000cc twin will feel heavier than a 230lb 125cc.   Not enough power to be a true adventure bike? What are you trying to say? It's completely opposite your first statement. You really wouldn't want more than 100hp in any situation that you'd be on dirt. I know the limits of usable power offroad, I ride an open class 2 stroke. You'd be feathering the clutch and lugging the engine as is.   What you're looking at here, is a liter adventure bike that will feel more like an 800 class adventure bike, than the current crop of big adventure bikes."
Dualsport,35oyle,number_e1even,-2,Tue May 12 19:34:29 2015 UTC,Agreed. No idea why they went with 1000ccs.
Dualsport,35oyle,caliform,5,Tue May 12 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"To compete with ktm, bmw, triumph 1000cc adventure bikes."

Dualsport,35oyle,caliform,2,Tue May 12 20:33:07 2015 UTC,Just to make a point:   XRV750: 481 lbs wet with 61 hp  CRF1000L :441 lbs wet with 100 hp.    So I don't see what about this bike flies in the face of the original Africa Twin.

Dualsport,35oyle,zalifer,7,Tue May 12 12:00:39 2015 UTC,The article says optional DCT.
Dualsport,35oyle,drive2fast,7,Tue May 12 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, it's an option, but even if you have it, you get manual changes on the left hand switchgear, as up down buttons, and can fit an optional gear lever, if you prefer it to the buttons.  As for me, I'd probably just leave DCT off altogether. It's just one more thing to break down, or go wrong."

Dualsport,35oyle,da1hobo,4,Tue May 12 20:01:11 2015 UTC,These giant dual sports are good for hauling luggage but they are ever any good on the easiest trails.
Dualsport,35oyle,somaganjika,2,Tue May 12 20:23:28 2015 UTC,At the very worst it will be better than a KLR on trails.
Dualsport,35oyle,da1hobo,2,Thu May 14 16:26:58 2015 UTC,Better than a KLR250? No way.  If they both had the same rubber... The Africa will have about 120 lbs more than the KLR 650... Any more horsepower on moderate to hard trails is redundant... depends on how strong you are I guess.
Dualsport,35oyle,somaganjika,2,Thu May 14 17:45:40 2015 UTC,Where are you getting 120lbs over the 650?  Rumored specs of the AT have it at 441 wet.
Dualsport,35oyle,da1hobo,2,Thu May 14 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"""competing with the multistrada, 1190 adventure, GS,"" etc, are around 470 - 540 average 120lb more than klr650"

Dualsport,35rx7v,LimecatApproves,2,Wed May 13 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"Hey guys and gals, I'm looking for some feedback for a trip I'm trying to put together.  I'm going to take 5 work days off and have nine days off (Friday-Sunday) to go on an offroad adventure to Yellowstone National Park. The route I've planned is roughly 60-70% dirt roads on the way there and then interstate on the way back (depending on time). My buddy and I will be on DR650s so we have no problem doing interstate on the way home, even though it won't be very fun. We'll be camping/couchsurfing the entire way and will have all of the necessary gear for that. We will probably need to pick up an extra gallon fuel tank each to make sure we don't run out of gas (I have an IMS 4.9gal and he has an Acerbis 5ish gal tank).  I was thinking some time around late July to early August to ensure that we won't run into any snow.  Thoughts? Think it's a terrible idea? Let me know!"
Dualsport,35rx7v,Mr_Donkey,1 point,Wed May 13 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like fun, but personally I would interstate it there and then ride dirt back.  Those freeway hours are gonna suck either way, but they will suck a lot less knowing that you have an amazing ride waiting at the other end."
Dualsport,35rx7v,jedibob,1 point,Wed May 13 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, both are valid options. I was thinking start with the offroad stuff in case the bikes decide to die we won't be AS far away as we could be if we motored all the way out to Wyoming. I'm a little concerned about how many miles we will be able to accomplish per day but I guess we'll just have to see!"
Dualsport,35rx7v,jedibob,2,Wed May 13 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"Rather than taking I-90 back, consider riding Highway 12 south of Missoula back into Idaho. It's an absolutely amazing road."
Dualsport,35rx7v,CodeBlue_04,1 point,Wed May 13 00:48:09 2015 UTC,That's a great suggestion. Being paved it shouldn't add too much time to the trip (which was my main reason for taking I-90 back). Plus it puts us in the middle of a national forest so camping should be easy to come by. Thanks!
Dualsport,35rx7v,CodeBlue_04,2,Wed May 13 02:52:40 2015 UTC,"There are several National Forest campgrounds along that road, but keep in mind that there aren't places to refuel between Lolo, MT and Kooskia, ID. It's honestly one of the best roads I've ever ridden for high speed sweeping corners and the scenery is beautiful."
Dualsport,35rx7v,argentcorvid,1 point,Wed May 13 04:53:34 2015 UTC,Nice! Looking at the maps it is 132miles between Lolo and Kooskia. My bike with the smaller tank seems to get 160ish miles to reserve so we should be good on the gasoline aspect. I'm definitely planning on picking up a Rotopax can also.
Dualsport,35rx7v,argentcorvid,2,Wed May 13 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that the road is open to the public past Kanaskat Palmer State park.  Once you get a little ways up the headworks road I think it turns into Weyerhauser, but again I'm not sure.  If it's closed you can always detour down 410 to just past Greenwater and head back up over Naches Pass."

I'm already on the inside fairly close to the edge of the road (which has about a foot of drainage ditch, and then solid rock,) we make eye contact for a split second, both of our eyes the size of dinner plates, neither of us expecting eachother to be there. He jerks right, I jerk right, all ends well with a brief look at death. My dad pulls up next to me on the straight, and gives me the dad look of ""that was fucking close."" And we rode on.

Dualsport,35nlko,zalifer,1 point,Tue May 12 11:37:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure if OP did it, but you can replace the stock battery with a lighter weight shorai lithium ion battery, which provides more cranking amps, reduces weight by a few pounds, and is smaller. Many xr650l riders place the new battery in the airbox, which centralizes the weight. This mod requires the rerouting of the wiring harness and the cdi as well. Once the relocation is complete, you can remove the battery box, or you can use it for extra storage."

Dualsport,35l1wd,sp0rk_,1 point,Mon May 11 22:01:36 2015 UTC,Haha yeah it's just that being my first bike I.was thinking more of the 250s cause of the weight and enough power to have fun and learn on :)
Dualsport,35l1wd,random_opponent,1 point,Mon May 11 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"I bought a XR250 for my first bike and it was good to learn on, but I soon became bored with the power (or lack of) and moved up to a XR400 less than a year later. Not a big difference in power but a lot more torque. I would strongly recommend looking at a 400. Either an XR or DRZ. Both solid and reliable with the biggest difference being an electric start on the DRZ. A friend of mine recently bought a DRZ400 as his first bike having never ridden before and he's fine on it. Very easy bikes to learn on.  Edit: Specs  XR250 28hp 25Nm (torque) 110kg (dry)  XR400 34hp 34Nm 121kg (dry)"
Dualsport,35l1wd,ozhank,1 point,Tue May 12 06:38:22 2015 UTC,"I rode a 250 for a while, and while great fun, was underpowered for road riding. I am now on LAMS approved Yamaha XT660Z which is great for on road/gravel and off road. Not the best for single track as pretty heavy to pick up, but still good fun. I have spent a fair bit of time standing it back up!"

Dualsport,35jqzo,RunningMoto,2,Mon May 11 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"It is indeed a gravel road, in fact one I've ridden many times. I saw that curbing and just assumed the water would only be a few inches deep at most.

Dualsport,35jqzo,AWESOM-O_jed,3,Mon May 11 11:27:57 2015 UTC,"Was just talking about this on another thread. I think I'm going to start keeping a ratchet strap wrapped around my luggage mounting plate. I've got a couple of 27' x 2"" straps rated at 10k lbs, hopefully that would give me an edge in recovering the bike should I lose it down a hill or in the muck."
Dualsport,35jqzo,smeee,1 point,Mon May 11 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"Only thing that would concern me with that is that ratchet straps, by the time you've put a loop on both ends (anchor & bike) that you're going to have some limited distance to work with.  Might want to still consider packing something to give you something to work with to cover reasonable ranges.  I think logically, you could possibly be as much as 30 feet from an anchor, or worse."

Dualsport,35jv6c,thetrooper424,1 point,Mon May 11 04:31:06 2015 UTC,Well unfortunately there's a lot of sugar sand here in Florida.

Dualsport,35jv6c,inspectormac,1 point,Mon May 11 04:53:17 2015 UTC,"It just takes some getting used to in the loose stuff.  It is definitely heavy, but I ride mine in straight up sand and do OK.  Just take it slow and learn how to slide the beast around in the loose stuff and you'll have a blast."
Dualsport,35jv6c,desker,1 point,Mon May 11 05:36:18 2015 UTC,"up, down, up, up, down, up, down, down, etc. And don't forget you have legs to pressure the pegs and a throttle to move the tires around.

Dualsport,35jv6c,inspectormac,2,Mon May 11 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, straight up sand takes practice, and usually purpose built tires.  I've done it on straight knobbies, on the DR, and it sucks.  It's a lot more fun on any bike, but especially a heavy bike, with a purpose built sand tire."
Dualsport,35jv6c,desker,1 point,Tue May 12 00:25:53 2015 UTC,I tried a paddle and a pizza cutter in dunes on my YZ250 and still looked like a monkey fucking a football. I've never in my life high ended and laid over so much in one ride.
Dualsport,35jv6c,inspectormac,2,Tue May 12 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"Really?  I've had pretty good fun with sand tires on my bike.  You just have to keep your weight back on the bike, so the front tire doesn't wallow as much, and stay on the throttle.  That and be smooth.  I love sand."

Dualsport,35jv6c,ender_wiggum,1 point,Tue May 12 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"Florida Sand HOWTO from a Florida hare scrambler:   Stand up (this is mostly for the straights). Squeeze the bike with your knees, it will help with stability. Shift your weight a little to the rear; you want the front end a little light so it doesn't bite into the ruts and toss you off. Be steady with the throttle; letting off the gas is like braking, it will shift weight to the front and make it dig in (sure-fire way to crash). Super-slow is the hardest to maintain - try speeding up a little.   The bike is going to be a little squirrelly, don't freak out and chop the throttle or jam on the brakes."

Not only do they just toss the old spikes aside when they pull them up, but they drop loads of new ones just from how they work. Also, have you seen how steep a rail bed usually is? Riding on the edge of one will be a massive pita and if you clip the edge of a tie the wrong way you are going to have a bad time. But all of this pales in comparison to the whole train killing you thing. Don't ride on the tracks."

Dualsport,35iwnr,inspectormac,6,Mon May 11 08:34:02 2015 UTC,"We used to ride dirtbikes on old inactive rail lines in PA, and there was tons of garbage left over from the years of active railroading.  I can't imagine that active railways are any cleaner.  We found spikes, huge splinters off of ties, spears of metal that had torn off of something or other, and all kinds of other stuff.  I lost a few tires and even more tubes, and it's always a pain to change them in the field.  I will say that riding a bike across a highway on an abandoned trestle bridge is one of the more exciting things that you could ever do, but I wouldn't say that it's one of the more intelligent."

Dualsport,35b2kr,Woodlow,3,Fri May 8 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"Looks like a cool bike, probably nice for pavement and some dirt roads. For a true dual sport I'd want something lighter, I ride a dr650 and even that has a pretty noticable girth on softer stuff. I'd say it would be a good adventure bike with the right armor and whatnot. In that category I'd rather have a vstrom 650 though. I think for a true all arounder there are better options. I'm sure they will sell a few though. It does seem like the adventure sector is growing which is a plus for people like us, it means more options in the future. I personally would like to see more lightweight and modern bikes in the 450cc category here in America. Something like a wr450r amd wr450x I think would sell and I'd definitely consider buying one."
Dualsport,35b2kr,airshow_announcer,2,Sat May 9 01:28:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you consider dual sport capabilities. Most people just want a nice road ride that looks the offroad part and very few dual sport bikes really get rode hard.   I have a dr650 and ride it both commuting in town and offroad both in woods and exploring fields and things. I couldn't imagine riding a bike with fairings, windshield and other expensive breakable parts in the woods.   I have had many bikes in the last 10 years and have found there is no one bike that does it all great.   Source: owned 650r, crf250x, cb550, versys, xr200r, cbr600rr, drz400, klr650 and now dr650"
Dualsport,35b2kr,Tyfornothing,3,Fri May 8 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"I rode my DR650 down to Argentina, which is what most people imagine an ""adventure"" bike for.  If I do it again I'd use a Honda XR400 or XR250. Lighter is better because you can go more places. It's also more fun to go slow. Honda because there are dealerships everywhere and spare parts are easy.  Luggage would be the GL Coyote saddlebag in this case."
Dualsport,35b2kr,lichlord,1 point,Fri May 8 23:15:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I have a BMW F700GS which is great for North America, but I would want something in the 400 or 300 range for traveling in central, south america, asia or africa. Having said that, I have no problem getting down the forestry roads or ATV trails on a bigger bike."
Dualsport,35b2kr,floppysausage,1 point,Sat May 9 03:59:48 2015 UTC,I would put it into the same category as a Kawa Versys. Nice fun bike that can be made into a tourer easily and can do some offroading with new wheels and enough armor.  It's not a dualsport at all. It is capable of adventure biking but not in factory configuration.
Dualsport,35b2kr,Coyote-Morado,1 point,Fri May 8 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"I liked mine so much I actually bought a second one. When I first got it, I didn't think I'd like it, but after owning it for a while a really began to appreciate it. It's comfortable, it has a nice seat instead of the hard 2x4 seats the dirt bikes like the XR650L have, so I can actually ride it for more then half hour without my ass getting sore. It's parallel twin engine is very smooth, and has a beautifully wide power band, it handles crawling traffic as well as wide open freeway easily. I've taken it in 3 inch deep slush and snow, as well as some trails most people would only take a dirt bike, and after doing that, I can safely say I too would only do it in a dirt bike. It's stock tires are 95% on road, and really aren't capable of doing much more then packed dirt roads and such. Delicately maneuvering that beast was a hassle without knobbies. And speaking of maneuvering, it handles extremely well, and it's tiny (and adjustable) windscreen actually does wonders to keep the brunt of the wind of your torso, shoulders, and even head depending how tall you are and seating position. The suspension also soaks up bumps on the road beautifully as well, the extra inch or so of travel it has over the CB500F and CB500R definitely makes a difference. This bike is definitely more road orientated though, and I wouldn't recommend taking it on real trails without engine guards and proper tires, the fairings cost about 30-60 if I remember right, and the engine covers cost about the same, so getting some armor is definitely a good idea."

Have someone try to start the bike and you'll see if it has a little blue spark, or shocks the shit out of you.  Either way works."

Dualsport,34uklw,shmaltz_herring,1 point,Mon May 4 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"I know that the klr is the default answer, but I'm going to disagree. If you're looking for a woods bike, you want something that's going to be easier to pick up, and given your stated weight, you'll likely want to stay in the 650 class.   While the KLR is good for getting you to the woods, once you're in the woods, it's going to suck. The xr650l is going to suck a little bit getting you to the woods (due to gearing and the board of a seat), but will be better in the woods (it's lighter, and isn't a fuel tanker). The dr650 is a happy medium.   There are bikes like the Vstrom, which are good in the street, fine on fire roads, and will be a pretty cumbersome in the woods, if you can get it up a muddy hill at all. Then there are the 250 class bikes, which will struggle to move you, but tend to be easy to pick up and cheaper to find. This depends on how much of a hurry you're in to get where you're going, as well, as they're not fast on the street, but usually have enough low end torque to be fun.   Hope this was helpful."

Dualsport,34mb6n,kevan0317,2,Sun May 3 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"You're on the wrong subreddit.  Everyone knows that real off road quadrupeds have long ears. Horse brains are prone to going haywire, the fuel system only runs on high quality feed, the suspension is refined and delicate, and the animal lacks any useful self preservation system!  Imagine for a moment the responses of a horse and a fine specimen of the long eared master race when confronted by a overweight redneck on a scary quad ""bike""  The horse (Undoubtedly named something like ""Gaffer's lucky Pegasus III"" aka Peggy) will immediately buck it's rider directly into the path of the oncoming ATV, and run off the nearest cliff with the first aid supplies still in the saddle bags.  The Noble Mule on the other hand will recognize the danger posed by the ATV, kick the redneck off his machine, and jump on the quad bike until it has been bashed to tiny harmless pieces. Alternately it may choose to run straight up or down the mountainside, going around rather than over the cliff where Pegasus failed to fly.  On top of this the Noble Mule will grow fat on scrub brush while the horse starves, it's bones are twice as strong, and it's smart enough not to walk by that rock where the rattlesnake is hiding no matter how hard you try and force it to."

I wouldn't want to be stuck in winter weather that far from home.   I backpacked/bussed through Morocco and thought that was great. I think if you picked out the right locations (esp Atlas Mountains and then along the coast) you could have a great route. A lot of the rest of the country is kinda flat desert though.   SE Asia is a good call... And it would be cheap I bet!   Well, hopefully I get to the point of doing a trip and can post some photos!"

Don't get me wrong it was an amazing trip but it can be a logistic nightmare at times doing such a long ride. I actually know a guy who used to rent bikes out of Mendoza and do a little guiding as well. Let me know if you want that info.  Morocco makes that list as being fairly easily accessible while still exotic enough. I also backpacked through there many years ago and I agree with you, maybe start in the Atlas and hit the dunes for a bit then head out to the coast would be an awesome trip."

Day 2 was torrential downpour.   For what I paid, the helmet worked well. You should note that you cannot close the vents, so the headliner did get a bit damp after hours of riding in the rain, but it wasnt too cold so not a huge issue. After the 2nd day it started to feel more comfortable and by the end of the day I'd say ""comfortable."" The visor fit over my 100% goggle straps like a champ so that was great.  My 100% goggles fit inside the view-port quite well.  I have also tried on an Arai xd4. That's the most comfortable DS-helmet I've ever tried on. But the pricepoint is too high for me, personally."

UTBDR was more fun as there was more dirt. I keep the bike in San Diego for winter Baja trips.   Would love to get an EXC 500 but the klr has been heaps of fun.

Dualsport,34a62m,shaggypants,2,Wed Apr 29 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't ridden it yet but I live close to where it starts in Tennessee. As you probably expect, it's going to be pretty hot during June/July. It will be hot and humid in the southeast portion through TN and MS, then should get drier as you move west. It rains hard and pretty frequently here too so be prepared for rain, though in summer it doesn't usually last too long. Your best bet is probably wearing mesh or vented textile gear with a rain/cold weather liner you can put in when things get bad. Wearing armor over normal clothes is an option too that may allow you to just wear a rain jacket."
Dualsport,34a62m,futility_jp,2,Wed Apr 29 21:42:42 2015 UTC,-Any mesh jacket with a removeable liner is fine.   -Long underwear (for when your jakcet and liner aren't enough)  -frogg togs for waterproofing http://www.froggtoggs.com/mens/mens-jackets-all-weather.html  -Spend money on a good pair of jeans and knee pads instead of motorcycle pants. Adventure motorcycle pants suck unless you spend lot of money.  Protip: dont go textile in humid places unless you spend good money on the product. Low cost textiles with removeable liners have a horrible uncomfortable inside when you start sweating.

Under the jacket, I had a chest protector and neck brace. A comp suit would have been nice. My riding buddy had his ripped open by a tree in Oregon.  Mx pants are good with knee braces and full MX boots. It's nice to have a jacket with pockets so I did't need any pockets on my pants.  I wasn't too hot for most of the ride. I took off the jacket when I was but because of the speed of most of the trail, I liked the jacket incase of a crash.   I would bring Frog Toggs if you don't have waterproof gear. Consider a heated vest if you have room.  Have fun! I want to go again this summer."

Dualsport,348y2t,vinnard,2,Wed Apr 29 07:18:30 2015 UTC,With a compression tester:  http://www.amazon.com/INNOVA-3612-Compression-Tester-Piece/dp/B000EVU89I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430329454&sr=8-1&keywords=compression+tester  if the rings on your piston are blown they'll let oil up into the combustion area causing the white smoke and bad compression.
Dualsport,348y2t,fitfastfreddy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Well, it's probably not the compression because now the thing runs, somewhat.  I cleaned out the petcock and the carburetor.

Dualsport,345ybh,ut-da-fror,6,Tue Apr 28 15:48:51 2015 UTC,"On a KLR650, Dirt wheels: Michelin T63, street wheels: Michelin Anakee 3. Both are fantastic."
Dualsport,345ybh,S2000,2,Tue Apr 28 18:24:31 2015 UTC,Tell me about these street tires. Experiences with them? Do they go off road at all?
Dualsport,345ybh,DrRazmataz,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"They're as fantastic as my other experiences with Michelin tires. First set I got is the Pilot Road 3 for the BMW, which impressed me right from the start. Then I got the T63 for the KLR which was a great step up from the stock tires at the cost of some of the extremes of street performance, at which point I decided to get a second set of wheels and stuck with Michelin again with the Anakee 3.  I'd say that they're in the realm of the closest you can get to a sport touring tire in the KLR's tire size. Much lower rolling resistance than a knobby, much quieter, excellent braking and cornering grip and transitioning. At more substantial lean angles, the T63 feels like it wants to let the bike fall into the corner...hell, it probably would if you let it, not the case with the Anakee. Very confidence inspiring and makes the bike feel much more stuck to the pavement than the wobbly feeling of the T63.  Michelin claims the tread pattern is good for gravel and whatnot. I wouldn't be against taking them on gravel, I have, but I wouldn't be riding aggressively or take them any deeper off-road than that. I definitely err on the side of caution though. Haven't had them in the rain yet.  As far as a street, or a 90/10 tire goes, they're phenomenal. The front tire, as I've read were other people's experience, can be an absolute bitch to mount. Not impossible, but difficult. It took a lot of tire lube and an insane 75psi to get the thing to finally seat properly. The size the KLR needs means you get a tubless tire, so they're definitely overbuilt for that application, probably why they need so much work to get on. It'll work, eventually, and they'll definitely be worth it!"
Dualsport,345ybh,S2000,2,Wed Apr 29 18:42:51 2015 UTC,Also rolling the t63's full time. I'd like to get another wheel-set and have a set for the road specifically.....I miss corners on the road :-\
Dualsport,345ybh,Texaz_RAnGEr,2,Tue Apr 28 23:52:40 2015 UTC,"That's what I did. The T63's do a decent job on the street, especially considering their commendable off-road traction and their much better handling of sand than the stock tires. You can still go around corners at a decent pace, however the bike does feel fairly wobbly and the braking grip is certainly less than a street-oriented tire. They also like to howl right around 50mph. You can still have a spirited street ride, but you do need to be mindful that you're not on a super bike tire! See my other reply in this thread about the Anakees."

Dualsport,3422nd,LittleBigHorn22,2,Mon Apr 27 23:02:33 2015 UTC,"It will almost certainly be the next ""big thing"", in my opinion as impacting as the advent of the computer. Perfecting a certain sport, hobby, job or skill that involves any danger, risk, or money loss will be able to be perfected by millions. Workplaces could simulate disasters for training courses. Soldiers could get the most realistic experience possible, without anyone actually dying, allowing recruiters to be able to hopefully avoid, or at least reduce, the possibility of getting ptsd.   Although if we have that level of virtual reality, I imagine by that point we'll have perfected renewable energy, so honestly I don't know what there would be to even ""war"" over.   Things will get weird. It will be strange having sports with so many pros. And as you said, if it was realistic enough, why would you ever leave? If you could have all the money in the world, the most beautiful girlfriend, and all your family around you, why would you ever want to leave?   People will hole up for days at a time. People have already died just playing video games, deaths will start occuring in virtual reality. Companies will start manufacturing feeding/watering/waste removal systems to allow people to permanently reside. Similar to the matrix. But there will be protesters, aiming to avoid such isolation of the human population. ""You're not even experiencing real life!"" they'll say. It will be countered with ""if you can't tell the difference, then why even care?"".   But then reproduction has to be factored in. You won't be able to actively reproduce in virtual reality and have it affect real life. Unless they fitted some weird semen to vagina transportation device. So naturally people will have to exit virtual reality, but the true addicts will be out of shape and unhygenic, unless they figure out a solution to that. So the people who play less will be naturally selected to breed more. But the people who never play will probably not succeed as much (evolution wise) because they aren't able to perfect skills like the others. There will be a balance between the two worlds.  Who will be the big manufacturer? At first you want to think a company like microsoft, or playstation, would be it. but then you see companies like Tesla, who rise to power through revolutionary ideas. Whoever it is, you can be guaranteed I'll buy as much stock in their company as possible, because they'll likely be the richest company on earth.  wait what are we talking about again?

Dualsport,3422nd,LittleBigHorn22,2,Mon Apr 27 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah very off topic already. There's so many possiblities though with virtual reality. Honestly I think the lack of exercise will be delt with by making games that you physically have to move around in order to play. It will become an extra type of game where actually being athletic will give you a leg up. Ironically it will basically be ""reality"" but through virtual things. As for wars and stuff, I'm sure by the time virtual reality is good enough to seem real, we will have robots to do things anyways so wars will either be  simply annihilations of robots controlled vs non robot controlled, or there will be no wars, or we will all be dead by this point.   I can completely see us eventually being ""downloaded"" into a computer system where either robots control the outside world or maybe actually become robots. So many trippy ideas that could be possible and frighteningly close to our time period."
Dualsport,3422nd,overgrownmoose,2,Mon Apr 27 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, funnily enough the virtual reality may actually advance us physically if people knew that the effort required rewarded them with beautiful women and loads of money. Which is indeed very ironic.  And on the subject of wars, I agree, we'll either be dead, happy, controlling the ultimate proxy war, or fighting 100 hundred duck sized horses.  ""Downloading"" memories and personalities will make things very interesting indeed, and will likely help give us a far better understanding of what ""consciousness"" is. Which will of course have huge impacts, very seriously on various religions. Which again, would help reduce the potential for war, especially in the middle east.   Whoever is responsible for the creation will likely get a nobel peace prize due to the amount of good it can serve. Another idea I had was training simulations for surgeons and paramedics. Or rescue workers.   As you say, it is frighteningly close to our time period. With things like this on the market already, and the virtual world in video games constantly being improved upon, I don't think it's far off. I've never programmed a game, but I know a little fortran and c++ coding, and I can totally see how easy it would be to program in various physic equations. What I'm unsure of though is AI, which I think will be one of the biggest hurdles. Although we're already getting close to that as well.

Dualsport,3422nd,mookymix,2,Mon Apr 27 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"Just break your rear loose a lot when accelerating from a stop at first. It will do plenty of slipping and sliding to the side. Gradually add more lean until comfortable. I would warn you not to start on a surface that is too slippery. Basically no loose sand or dirt on top of hard pack. Gravel sorta fits this description. It is easier to learn on solid hard pack, IMO. The slide is more predictable."
Dualsport,3422nd,sldx,5,Mon Apr 27 23:00:11 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer I'm not very good either. Just had the chance to learn this from a rider that has won Redbull Romaniacs.   You brake into the corner,  weight back (standing)  up to the apex(downshifting here as needed) . At the apex you sit down,  so you only see a little front seat,  ass cheek hanging  a bit off on the outside. Inside leg out. Weighting the outside peg. Keep dragging the front brake slightly. You pull up on the inside bar/push down on the outside. Once you're past the apex,  you get off the front brake and immediately back on the power. I usually feed it out with the clutch. Posture is probably 50% of this.  The rest is probably balls lol.  If you look up Chris birch on youtube you can see him doing these things.  I did a training day with him last year,  and he had a couple of corner courses setup to do this on. If you start slow,  the gradually get faster you can sorta isolate each part then get them working together. It's made me a much faster rider(still not saying much lol)"

Dualsport,341ldk,KifBox,2,Mon Apr 27 16:17:08 2015 UTC,"5900 could be high mileage if 5500 were dirt. A new seat cover from One is going to run you about $150. If that bike were in my area I'd offer dude $1100 and settle if he'd take $1200. Look at the price point in your area, every market is different. Where I currently am you can pick up an '07 CRF250L for $2500 because it's getting to be PWC season. As for checking the bike; If you're 160 lbs. or lighter, bring the bike around to compression put it in 2nd and stand on the kicker. If it will hold your weight compression is good."

Use the lever until you feel compression, then gently press the lever until it moves just a little more.  At this point you are partly through the compression stroke.  Now lift your foot up and let the kickstarter return so you get a full kick on it.  You really don't need the full stroke to start it.  Done correctly, it can be practically kicked in bare feet."

They have decent facilities at the actual camp ground if you want to stay there but I think you can camp outside the campground pretty much anywhere for free. There are some cool water holes and clearings that would be great for camping if you search for em. I've stayed at the camp ground a few times and had a blast.

I bought a Ducati Hyperstrada, which has a similar upright seating position to my CRF, but is light years better on pretty much all the riding I do. I like the CRF and I think it's a great bike. I'm sure I would keep it if I still lived in Seattle. But for around here it just isn't that good."

Dualsport,33tvqf,johnaldisdabomb,3,Sat Apr 25 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"Had a later model LC4 in a 640 Adventure (2007). I think they went through some upgrading in 2003 or 2004 for higher exhaust flow (dual header system). It wasnt fast by any means, but it was efficient on fuel. Shook like a paint mixer. Was reliable while I owned it but I sold it after putting on 18,000km (11,000 miles). The stock carb setup was a CV carb which was ok but had poor throttle response as any CV carb does. General maintenance was a bit of a chore because of the design though this may be more model specific than engine specific. As I recall oil changes were quite the process as the design used the frame breast pipe to hold oil. Overall a decent bike, but I wouldn't buy one again, mainly because the later 690 lc4 engine is superior in every regard, but they are spendy as well."

Dualsport,33tvqf,FullFiguredRhino,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"Brilliant bikes. I have a later model SM variant which is substantially the same bike with different clothes on. The older bikes (with the black engines) had some issues I seem to remember and went on to have a redesign to the grey, high flow head engines.    Mine can hit about 117mph and isn't too bad at motorway speeds, but is more fatiguing than the DRZ to ride.   As a platform they are great fun. Yes a little on the vibey side, but then that's older tech single cylinders for you! They also sound like a bag of bolts.    Just look after it with maintenance and you should be fine. Also bear in mind the tech is 13 years old so don't expect miracles. Depending on price, it would be a good buy.   If you want really good advice, head over to advrider.

Did a bit of off-roading around Rockport last summer, and Cle Elum a few weeks ago, but the trails were too slushy for riding two up so I ended up turning back early.

Dualsport,33ngdy,DrRazmataz,3,Fri Apr 24 02:14:30 2015 UTC,It is quite literally a DRZ400 badge-engineered to be a green Kawasaki.
Dualsport,33ngdy,McGrude,3,Fri Apr 24 04:58:19 2015 UTC,"So, not even a Kawi engine?"
Dualsport,33ngdy,DrRazmataz,4,Fri Apr 24 05:16:10 2015 UTC,"From what I read several years ago it is a Suzuki, built by Suzuki under contract to Kawasaki.  Suzuki had a viable, reliable, established platform and production pipeline that would fill a niche lacking in Kawasaki's product lineup.   I'm a fan of both companies bikes, but have owned more Kawasaki bikes than Suzuki over the years."
Dualsport,33ngdy,McGrude,2,Fri Apr 24 05:24:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I don't have anything against Suzuki bikes at all! I replaced my GS500E with my recent KLR650 :D and my goal is to one day own a nice, shiny, new WeeStrom 650. And I've always wanted to ride a DRZ. I'm just kinda starting to experiment with dual sports and the like. My 2nd bike was a 1973 Honda XL250. Kinda wanted more :)"
Dualsport,33ngdy,DrRazmataz,5,Fri Apr 24 05:31:22 2015 UTC,"Have a look at the DR650.  It's just a wee bit smaller feeling than the KLR650, while retaining the highway going capability of the larger displacement 650cc motor.  The DRZ400 gets quite a bit 'buzzy' at freeway speeds, especially for sustained periods.  Of course if this isn't a concern then the smaller bike in offroad-mostly conditions is likely the better choice.  The DR650 has been the same platform for almost 20 years.  There are parts, lots of them."
Dualsport,33ngdy,McGrude,2,Fri Apr 24 05:37:06 2015 UTC,"I looked at it, but I think I prefer the KLR, if for the fact that I'm a highway rider. I like to be able to go wherever the hell I want (I rode home 100 miles just today, on a stock KLR, after already riding 150 yesterday). So, with some mods, my KLR should be pretty adept at highway comfort, but still capable of trails pretty well. At the same time, a nice 250 or 400, small framed dual sport would be excellent for more dirt-ey stuff. Maybe I won't get stuck in the mud xD   Hopefully, I can just get my Honda running again soon... although it won't be an excellent dirt bike, cause weight."
Dualsport,33ngdy,DrRazmataz,2,Fri Apr 24 05:44:02 2015 UTC,The two companies did this on a few other occasions. The Kawasaki KX65 and suzuki RM65 are the exact same bike. Well they were for some years and then they diverged a bit.

As far as your next bike though, I'd suggest another WR250R. Still makes healthy power, very light, 6 speed box, and it's a more modern bike (if looking at new). If shopping a few years back, a DRZ is unbeatable. Best of luck."
Dualsport,33oz7e,kDiqq,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"What sucks is that it was a 2014 and mint. In order to get it replaced ie buying a new one from a dealer, it's going to cost me the price tag plus the government fees, taxes, crate fees, setup fees, etc.   I have a feeling insurance won't factor in those fees and taxes when they write me a check. Or am I wrong?"
Dualsport,33oz7e,kDiqq,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:08:48 2015 UTC,It all depends on coverage. Some providers have a 'pay what you paid' if the bike is new enough and isn't more than X MY old. Sometimes they pull up ads for the same bike and pay you what others want for theirs (what happened with my wife). Sometimes they pay you the bottom end of book value.. best of luck though!

Dualsport,33oz7e,LimecatApproves,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:54:59 2015 UTC,There are other gps security devices that you can monitor remotely. However I'm not sure as to how taxing that would be on a battery. So I suppose you would need to mount a dedicated battery somewhere.   You could do something like this but that is designed to only be active when the bike is turned on(though that's just a matter of how it's wired up I'm sure). Preferably the gps unit would be on when the bike is off though.
Dualsport,33oz7e,happy_folk,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:46:01 2015 UTC,"If you gotta get a replacement, I'd get a WR. The DRZ is heavy and dated.  Sucks to hear about the bike, man. If you do buy another one, and the original comes back, then you have two bikes and winner is you."

Dualsport,33m3kv,rottenpossum,2,Thu Apr 23 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"Guess which one got stuck more :)   But yeah, it was actually excellent. We did more strenuous and dangerous stuff with my KLR, and the Nighthawk kept up without issue because it was so light. Even with street tires, it was fine, haha."
Dualsport,33m3kv,Wezitar,2,Thu Apr 23 17:22:27 2015 UTC,What tires are those on the KLR? They look like a nice light dirt/gravel and road worthy.
Dualsport,33m3kv,sandalscout,2,Thu Apr 23 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"They're pretty adept at that, actually. They get me my highway miles, but they did pretty okay in the dirt. Mud was not fun, however.   Says Kenda on the side, but I don't know anything else about them."

No regrets, the experience taught me how to ride in the rain (something I had never done growing up in parched CA).  The following year we rode to Sturgis - and it rained much of the way but I was way more confident."

Dualsport,33hgbb,octave1,2,Wed Apr 22 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"So great!  I had brought my helmet and jacket but found it was more expensive than I had budgeted for a the time, and figured I'd just do a day or two.  At my cousin's wedding reception met a friend who had a tiny little motorcycle repair shop in Bavaria, and he rented me his personal GS1200 for the week for a pittance.  My mom had a time-share in the Austrian alps.  Everything just came together at the last moment - but then the rain.  But it was still glorious.  And I'm jealous I never got off road much."

Should try going into Saguaro Lake at Butcher Jones, then through the OHV area up to Cline Cabin Road (4 peaks road), and take it across the peaks.  You come out on El Oso road just above lake Roosevelt.  Then, you head towards the dam, and take the back way by Apache/Fish Creek/Canyon, and back into town.  Such an awesome ride, and if you start in the morning, you don't have to ride behind traffic in the twisties.  There's also the sheep's bridge crossing of the verde river that is AWESOME.  But you'll need some help getting up or down the trail by the bridge."
Dualsport,33jheh,Rastamur,4,Thu Apr 23 00:40:00 2015 UTC,Drill holes in the bottom and hard mount it to your rack.
Dualsport,33jheh,Pete3,2,Thu Apr 23 01:53:55 2015 UTC,This works well. I used the existing rack mount points with longer bolts and drilled two additional further apart for stability. Been running it for years without a problem. Use locktite!

Dualsport,33jlwe,Haw-wy,7,Thu Apr 23 01:17:48 2015 UTC,I don't think it would be a comfortable ride at 115kph. It will be rung out. A WR250R is probably the only 200cc class that will do it. A drz400  or even dr650 may be more suitable.
Dualsport,33jlwe,ImGoingToMakeYouMad,3,Thu Apr 23 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"The 250L can handle those speeds perfectly fine.  I'd actually recommend a 13t over a 15t, especially if you want to do more 50/50 stuff with it.  Even then, I'd recommend replacing the stock tires over a sprocket change.  The stock tires are a bit crap in the dirt.  It doesn't get much love around here, but it's mostly by people who've never ridden one."
Dualsport,33jlwe,behohippy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:43:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks Man, ill look into a 13t sprocket. Do you ride a crf250l?"

Dualsport,33jlwe,dudeonweb,2,Thu Apr 23 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"I hear the Honda is heavy, underpowered an has shitty suspension. A used WRR would be the beast 250, but I also suggest looking at bigger bikes, DR, DR-Z, XR, maybe even a 690 if you have the money."
Dualsport,33jlwe,fitfastfreddy,4,Thu Apr 23 09:41:52 2015 UTC,It's not gonna blow up. It probably won't have any passing power. But that's probably about as 50/50 as you can get.
Dualsport,33jlwe,ozhank,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:00:21 2015 UTC,"I am a pretty big bloke, and I tried a 250 once - not enough grunt for those sort of speeds. IMHO > 450 to do it comfortably, but depends on commute distance"

Dualsport,33hhwc,ratatooie,2,Wed Apr 22 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"Split the water pump cover, and cracked the right case cover (the piece the water pump cover bolts into.)  Had to trailer it back to camp.  I was able to get all of the parts I needed from the Rocky Mountain ATV/MC warehouse in Payson, UT (about 200 miles from Moab), and we were able to repair the bike in camp.  Luckly, I was able to ride 6 out of the 7 days I was there (two days were on borrowed bikes) - the road trip for parts took nearly a full day."
Dualsport,33hhwc,ratatooie,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:51:36 2015 UTC,That doesn't sound cheap. A few hundred $$ at the least I would have thought. Glad you got most of your time there though!
Dualsport,33hhwc,sandalscout,5,Wed Apr 22 23:06:55 2015 UTC,"It ended up costing me about $350, plus I bought a few dinners for friends who loaned me bikes and helped me fix my own.  Probably a little over $400, all told.  Yeah, not cheap, but you gotta make the most of time off from work, and sitting around in camp wasn't going to do it for me."
Dualsport,33hhwc,sandalscout,2,Wed Apr 22 23:12:05 2015 UTC,So.... you were able to go directly to RmAtv/mc and get oem parts? That is awesome to know if so.
Dualsport,33hhwc,fitfastfreddy,2,Thu Apr 23 05:18:10 2015 UTC,"YES!  They actually have a small storefront at their main warehouse - I just walked in with a parts list, and they hooked me up.

Dualsport,33hhwc,sUpErLiGhT_,2,Wed Apr 22 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"I had to watch the video again to try to figure out where you figured that out, since the camera is mounted on top of my helmet, I was wondering how the heck you saw that.  You probably saw the quickstrap on one of my riding partners, who helped pick up the bike after I dropped it on that ledge.  Anyway, I do use the quickstrap as well, and I love it.  I haven't had any issues at all.  The goggles stay on securely, and are really easy to get on and off, and as an added bonus, I NEVER lose them, now!  As an eyeglass wearer, I really like anything that decreases the complexity of my helmet/glasses/goggle process."

Dualsport,33ejhd,sli,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. On the rebound, I can get it up, and the thing about a motor moving quickly, and the much heavier motorcycle wheels spinning, is that the motorcycle truly does want to continue moving straight. Same reason it's easier to balance a mov my motorcycle than one moving 1mph. Go into second, go about 10 mph, bounce hard down and get n the rebound just give it a little bit of gas. Practice this till you can get the wheel up a few inches each time, then start moving higher and higher. This is how I've gone from no wheelies to 50% of the time wheelies! Not big, not long, but wheelies none the less. I also went to a long narrow unused parking lot and just spent a ton of time doing it over, and over, and iver"
Dualsport,33ejhd,Dirt_Bike_Zero,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:46:28 2015 UTC,"However you are most comfortable is the right way.  Standing up, you can stop the wheel from coming up by pushing the bars away from you while you cut the throttle a little."

Dualsport,3389id,Ras_Giggla,3,Tue Apr 21 17:56:23 2015 UTC,2013 Yamaha WR250r 2013 Suzuki DR650se 2015 KTM 690 Enduro R
Dualsport,3389id,wwalker006,2,Tue Apr 21 17:58:26 2015 UTC,how do you feel ridding along much bigger bikes? I have a honda CRF250 and my buddy has a suzuki dr650 and he keeps bugging me to trade my bike in asap to get at least a 400 (litterally bought my bike a few months ago). Then once we hit some mud I'm riding circles around him while he's focusing on keeping that behemoth upright. But when we get on roads to get to other trails I obviously fall behind. But I don't care I would rather not be going 100 on the highway anyway.
Dualsport,3389id,onmybike,3,Mon Apr 20 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"My friend rides the WR250r and hes in the same boat.  Hes trying to decide if he needs more or not.  We live in rural Iowa so we need to travel 55 mph highway to get to each others houses/work/trails/etc.  So there he is pushing it pretty hard to keep up.  On the level B roads/gravel/off road it does really well.  He for sure has a more dirt bike feel where as my 690 and the dr650 feel more road worthy.  If you want to keep the dirt bike feel but have more power for the roads, check out KTM's 350/500 excs.  Lightest dual sports they make, with plenty of ponies for the road.  Might consider a sprocket change though."
Dualsport,3389id,Pete3,3,Mon Apr 20 16:17:01 2015 UTC,I always see people recommend going out and spending crazy money swapping bikes which is totally unnecessary. 55 isn't really pushing hard for a WR. Just rev it out - motor is fine with it.  I had a DR350S and my cousin has a WR250R. We cruised massive SoCal interstate freeways all the time. I'm sure it'll be fine in rural Idaho.
Dualsport,3389id,bombidragon,6,Mon Apr 20 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly, my crf250l with happily put up with WOT all day in 6th gear. I on the other hand will not."
Dualsport,3389id,inspectormac,2,Mon Apr 20 18:34:28 2015 UTC,I ride with a friend that has a wr250 and his bike cruises at 75 easily.
Dualsport,3389id,daywat,2,Mon Apr 20 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Not too many bikes will run 8,400rpm at 75mph ""easily"", although I don't doubt that it will do it for a time.  If riding 75mph is really a big part of your riding, I don't think a 250 is for you.  If it's a small part, and your normal riding is down around 55mph or so, then I'm sure it's fine."
Dualsport,3389id,riqk,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:43:10 2015 UTC,i'm in the iowa city area.  Are there any b roads or trails you recommend?
Dualsport,3389id,wwalker006,2,Mon Apr 20 20:46:38 2015 UTC,We are near Pella/Knoxville area about about 45 minutes southeast of Des Moines.  Lots of miles here and there of level B's in this area.  I am about 5 miles from Bluff Creek which I think is the best ATV/Dirt bike park in Iowa.  Very easy to just ride right into the park and hit their trails.

Dualsport,33bile,ThoseSickBastards,2,Thu Apr 23 05:10:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this translates to the FX41, but I have an AFX-140 (modular) and find the quality to be poor.   The FX41 has simpler construction so it might not be a problem, but I'll offer the thoughts on the 140 just as a reflection on potential design/construction issues.  The modular hinge screws (where the chin guard hinges on the helmet) tend to loosen through normal use.    It has become detached on one side twice while riding.  I've put locktite on the screws.  Also the snap on hinge covers are loose and create noise under speed/wind.  I've put silicon gel at the attachment points to quiet it.   All in all, they offer great value but maintenance on the helmet is a pain."

When he stopped, he had to basically move his ass to one side and could only touch the ground with one foot.   His form on the bike was perfect, very smooth and fast.    My point is, touching down with both feet is over rated.  Sure, it's not easy and the bike will fall down a bit a first - but it's a dirt bike, they fall down.    If you leave it high, it will force you to keep your feet on the pegs and you'll be a better rider as a result.  My vote is deal with the inconvenience and enjoy your new found ground clearance"
Dualsport,3394a6,Dirt_Bike_Zero,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This was the reassurance I was looking for. I'll give it another month or two before considering lowering again. I don't necessarily want to touch down, but it would be nice to get a tad bit lower.   My main concern is when coming up hills. If I come to a stop, the bike essentially has to lean on its side. It can get pretty difficult for me to get it back up again. This will be my first year trail riding, so i wanted to make sure everythign was setup correctly before I headed out."

Dualsport,333e4k,killbears,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:36:53 2015 UTC,It's fairly common among dual sports because all the over 175cc bikes require A2 licenses which are difficult for foreigners to get right now and the bikes are usually smuggled from Cambodia to avoid tax so they just use fake Viet 125 or 150 papers and stickers to make it look legit.

It's called 'Mjesečeva staza'(Moonpath) because it looks like you are on the moon :)  I'd recommend going from the town of Vrbnik (behind the hilltop) to Baška (the little green valley left of center on the pic). The tracks are used by sheep herders.  There is a natural spring with drinking water on the main road that makes the valley green, but be sure to take a few liters of water with you, it can get very hot on that barren landscape. It has great views when you come to the ridge.  http://www.adrenalina.hr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6&Itemid=7  (F3 'Mjesečeva staza')  Also, the Košljun monastery is like 10 min from there https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3509/3971371985_6a96cfc55b_o.jpg  Well, that's if you are still there and not on your journey hehe   Source: have a house there"

Dualsport,32vxqz,vinnard,5,Fri Apr 17 03:53:35 2015 UTC,If you really want to take your jumps to the next level start preloading the suspension. You can get air off of even the smallest of kickers if your preload your suspension as hard as possible.
Dualsport,32vxqz,overgrownmoose,2,Fri Apr 17 07:55:10 2015 UTC,"Hey can you elaborate on that? I sorta understand the idea of preloading from snowboarding where you wanna try and pop off the tail, but do you wanna focus on compressing the front or the back before you go off?"
Dualsport,32vxqz,uniteskater,4,Fri Apr 17 12:51:29 2015 UTC,Both. You bounce onto the foot pegs like you are trying to jump extra high on a trampoline when you hit the face of the jump. If you time it correctly the suspension will be rebounding as you go off the lip of the jump and give you extra pop.
Dualsport,32vxqz,overgrownmoose,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"Ya, I was trying a little bit but that shit gets tiring haha Giving it gas coming up the jump helps preload the suspension, too."

Dualsport,32r1js,maatismoot,2,Thu Apr 16 19:49:22 2015 UTC,"Super cool stuff DBZ, really neat to see another cool independent craftsman in textiles.  I have a longstanding appreciation for the practical art of the field, that probably started when I was a young kid, literally watching my mom sew me new jeans on an old treadle Singer, which I still have (the machine that is).  Needle down, lift foot, turn 180, you have no reverse ;)  To this day, after growing into a complete tech geek and lover of all things mechanical, electrical and programmable, it is still sewing, textiles, and the machines that make it all happen that is one of my favorite fields, even though I don't really sew much, more just fix machines for friends and family when the need arises.  My mom is an artist with leather and a Sailrite Ultrafeed, making amazingly high end purses for the ladies.  One of my EX's has her own line of hippie clothing, sells it at festivals, has made good money for over 10 years.  My other EX is just starting up shop in our small town, with a great guy who's a long time master at doing boat canvas and other commercial sewing.  Another friend runs a cottage industry sweater making company, using a big double knit machine, and sewing + serging all the parts together into rugged wears.  You could say I'm surrounded on all sides:)  I like it, and I think you're in a cool niche doing biking related gear.  And a damned fine stable of machines you have there :)  On the meta side, I'm glad you took the liberty to shamelessly (and tastefully) self promote on the sub here.  I think it's great to see real artisans offer unique quality work, in a world too full of cookie cutter big business, all made in Asia and throwaway and priced at top dollar to make money money more money.   In a small-ish special interest community, it's good to have people share their talents as resources available to all.  I'm not asking for permission for anything here, I'm not even vaguely in business, but I hope you mods are generally accepting of people making well merited offerings like your own.  It makes sense for talented people to offer their help to others who might specifically need them, but have a hard time finding people who know the dual sporting application from personal experience, as I assume you do as a mod here.  Cheers, good luck in business, and happy riding :)"

I think the only important rule is that you participate in the forum first, and plug yourself second - not the other way around.

Dualsport,32sc94,ochuter,7,Thu Apr 16 09:10:32 2015 UTC,Are you going to be doing your own maintenance? The KLR is going to be a lot easier and less expensive to work on.    How tall are you? The KLR has a higher seat height.   The Bmw is going to have more power because of the fuel injection.   The KLR is far less likely to have something debilitating go wrong with it.   The KLR is a lot cheaper on the used market and still substantially cheaper new.  It has an aftermarket community dedicated to finding the cheapest way to do stuff. There is good reason its the best selling dual sport in America.   If you are a bit shorter and money is not an issue get the BMW. You'll like it.

Dualsport,32nvu4,Purposeful1,2,Wed Apr 15 13:58:27 2015 UTC,Seriously. I want it!!!
Dualsport,32nvu4,CivilNassar,2,Wed Apr 15 18:03:06 2015 UTC,I've not seen anyone else local with an XT in the Lakers colors.
Dualsport,32nvu4,fake_tea,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:08:05 2015 UTC,My dr had a purple frame but the previous owner painted it black with spray paint and now it's chipping.

Dualsport,32nvu4,El_Al_Erfainsht,2,Thu Apr 16 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"It's slowly regaining control, few thousand more miles and hopefully the rest of the black will vibrate off."
Dualsport,32nvu4,dagormz,2,Thu Apr 16 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"www.ktm950.info/how/Suspension Shop/Suspension_shop.html   sorry, I'm on mobile and forgot how to link. before spending any money or time on suspension, I highly recommend you read and understand the top 4 (non model specific articles on the page above."
Dualsport,32nvu4,dagormz,3,Wed Apr 15 13:31:36 2015 UTC,Link I don't know if i can trust a website that uses that much comic sans.
Dualsport,32nvu4,dagormz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"Appreciate it, main reason for changing it is just how much travel I have lost with the stock suspension and being a big guy."
Dualsport,32nvu4,dagormz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:03:19 2015 UTC,It's a 95 I bought from my uncle for $500 it only had 1800 miles when I got it. This is hands down the best bike I have to date. I live in SW MO and looking for places to ride. I go to Chadwick quite often But wanting to ride some other places.  Anyway going to do some removable panniers for it.  Does anyone have any experience with stiffening the suspension on these? I have read a bit on the XT forums but I am totally new to dual sports. I found race tech can build me a  stiff rear spring but what can I do about the front. I am about 250 pounds and the 20 year old suspension is just too sloppy.
Dualsport,32nvu4,dagormz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:07:47 2015 UTC,Just bought a 98 yesterday. I was also looking at stiffening the rear suspension.  I guess the suspension from the ttr225 is stiffer and should fit on the xt225.
Dualsport,32o901,awp235,3,Wed Apr 15 11:23:22 2015 UTC,Pics?
Dualsport,32o901,klonk,3,Wed Apr 15 13:46:02 2015 UTC,I've torn plenty of knobs on newer tires with aggressive street riding. Harder compounds show better resistance.
Dualsport,32o901,fitfastfreddy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:25:41 2015 UTC,Probably just old. There should be a date stamp somewhere on the sidewall.
Dualsport,32o901,HyperTraveler,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like old tires.  I've had newer knobs that didn't like the street very much though, and higher speed runs can definitely tear some of them up.  What air pressure were you running?"
Dualsport,32o901,HomebrewDad,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"i would say its hard rubber from age many t63s spend the majority of their life on pavement, i have friends that have run it on bigger heavier bikes with no cracks or chunks until it was past bald. that said if your trails have a lot of sharp embedded rocks you could be putting slices in the knobs that then rip off on the higher traction surface of the road.its not typical of what ive seen for that tire though."
Dualsport,32o901,zaqu12,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:07:56 2015 UTC,they are aged or have seen too high of speed on pavement
Dualsport,32o901,ride365,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:25:21 2015 UTC,I have found some brands chunk more than others - altho I think they ultimately just get old and dry.  I seem to have the knobs fall off before I wear them off.

Dualsport,32pyzt,dagormz,5,Wed Apr 15 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"First off, the laws change by state. It could be totally cool in Texas for all I know. And probably illegal in california. But as a california resident, most aftermarket exausts are illegal. Especially ones that came from an off the road vehicle. But nobody cares at all. I've been riding with an ""illegal"" exhaust for four years and nobody even looks twice."
Dualsport,32pyzt,HyperTraveler,2,Wed Apr 15 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool. I live in Ohio. I was guessing no one really cared. I have a feeling it's a law they pull if you are being a douche."
Dualsport,32pyzt,huzzaboot,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:28:50 2015 UTC,I wouldn't even say that man. I got pulled over by a cop for doing a wheelie and he never even notice the pipe haha

Dualsport,32livu,exploderator,8,Tue Apr 14 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"OK, that was a hilarious and excellent bait and switch :)  I was watching the speed, and cringing about the looooong grind to slow down across the ice, and wondering how many inches of flesh (pounds of human hamburger) that was going to amount to.  I was very very pleasantly relieved and entertained.  Thank you :)"

Dualsport,32oyrx,nichlas482109,2,Wed Apr 15 15:23:16 2015 UTC,Look at how the rear brake is holding together.
