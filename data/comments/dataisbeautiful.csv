These are the ones who others complain about when they say ""individuals dominate"".    Unfortunately (or fortunately, as the case may be) these same people -- the Talkers -- are rarely the ones who actually implement the processes or products they discuss in meetings.   They just love talking about how it's meant to be done, then point the finger at someone else and say ""make it so"".    The challenge is that the Implementors have better things to do with their time than sit in a meeting with the Talkers, but in those meetings the talkers make decisions about how things will be implemented, so they kind of have to.  In a good organization, much of this would be handled with proper documentation.  Unfortunately even a good organization can have bad managers, if they are also Talkers."

The other type is the ""senior staff member has a series of very specific 1-on-1 conversations"", these typically happen daily, or every other day.   The second type is the reason that the majority of people find meetings horrifically inefficient, and why managers find them so brilliant.

It's not that they aren't ""beautiful"", it's that the pie chart actually had to have a sentence in the middle to clarify what should have been obvious from the graph.     Edit:  While I'm at it, why does he use circles to compare one dimensional data?  The area of a circle is very deceiving, as a circle that has twice the area has only 1.4 times the radius.  That's data visualization 101.  There's a pyramid chart that has no reason to be a pyramid (unless the author was shooting for the irony of incompetent managers using pyramid charts).  The participants chart is completely pointless, showing nothing that can't be conveyed in a simple sentence.  ""America Meets a Lot"" is similarly pointless, but it's not even trying to be a graph so maybe we should let it off the hook.  My point here is that we're not asking for ""beauty"", we're asking for visualizations that effectively convey information.  Per the sidebar.

dataisbeautiful,3e2l2u,liquidpig,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"It doesn't identify the two types of meetings though, nor does the article properly cast meetings in the correct light and context.  First type of meeting is your typical Monday morning meeting. This is nothing more than a reminder to everyone that Bob is still the boss and he's still paying attention (even if it doesn't seem like it). Our company has this every week, but we make sure to condense it down to 15-20 minutes. Good things to bring up here are potential things coming that week that might affect several other people like technology.  The other meeting is to actually troubleshoot a problem. For this, you two things - the people involved need unrestricted access to immediate information, so they need to bring it with or have tech handy that will let them get info on the fly.  Second thing you need is a competent manager that's going to reinstate clear objectives as the meeting progresses, with due dates and times for each persons involvement. This is harder than you think, and most of the time it's a complete failure due to company hire practices... Like hiring people to manage departments that have no experience in that field. If your company is doing this, leave. Tidy up the resume and get the Fuck out. Ship is gunna sink.  In the end, meetings aren't a waste of time... You just have to know when it's appropriate and competent people to run them."

It's difficult to tell without looking extremely closely, the difference between the GTAV red, and the Team Fortress red - they're about 6 inches apart on my screen, and the eye is terrible at judging similar colours at that distance. Especially with so many other colours in between.  The solution here is to have the key vertical, and have similar colours next to one another in the key, so you can tell the subtle differences between them."

The US held the largest amount of Gold reserves, which was the international trading commodity at that time, and used it to lend to countries that needed to rebuild themselves (Bretton-Woods linked US $ & Gold in 1944). Also, the US came late into the war and didn't really have to spend as much as others. That allowed the US to lend cash against Gold which let nations fight the war. But then, the delinking between Gold & US $ by Nixon in '71 brought down the value of their Gold by the time they were ready to buy it back from the US - Nixon Shock.

dataisbeautiful,3dxqtm,The_Town_,149,Mon Jul 20 15:35:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like I just wrote about this the other day.... well I did actually, yesterday. It just seems like every thread regarding NASA funding inevitably evolves into a debate on NASA vs. defense.  Anyways, for OP, first a critique since this is /r/dataisbeautiful: logarithmic scale can be very misleading so be careful with its use. The WW2 peak gets diminished (and at over 50% of the GDP during the war years, it goes to show you what total war really means), and the seemingly small differences on the chart are often major differences in a non-log chart.   Even then though, you'd run into the problem that the log chart won't show the vast changes in defense spending since the Korean War, like it does here from 1948 to today or even better yet, here from 1988 to today, which shows the 8% to under 4% drop in the past two and a half decades. To make the log-chart a little better, consider removing the data before the Korean War - that would help make the fluctuations and changes more noticeable.  Also, I'd check your sources on defense spending, or at least come up with how you calculated total defense spending. The US is at 3.5% of GDP for 2014, not the ~5% you have in your OP chart and non-log version you linked.    Now for the political side, let me preface this by saying that I'm a big supporter of NASA getting more funding, and would love if NASA had a more focused manned exploration mission plan on board instead of becoming the political battleground it has become for Congress and the President. With that being said, a lot of the discussions regarding their budget make it sound like it is an either-or situation regarding funding, and they're often laden with incorrect numbers or statistics that make the supporters and detractors sound even more biased, much like the debate over NASA's funding itself.  For one, as big as the US military budget is (around $600-640 billion this past year), it's not even the second largest budget item on the federal budget. In fact, it is the third largest, behind Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid. At this point, the whole talk of it being mandatory vs. discretionary spending is semantics - Congress has routinely raided the coffers of the Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid taxes, and it's still tax dollars removed from our paychecks to pay current beneficiaries, whomever Congress changes eligibility for or lends to.  People bring up education too and highlight how little the federal government spends on education. It's true, the US federal government spends very little on education - but that's because state and local government spends money on education. In fact, state and local government spends the most on education, putting the US at over 6.9% of its GDP on education alone per the NCES (nearly twice that of the military too), far more than most nations in the world.  The US is only behind Austria, Switzerland, and Norway in terms of money spent per student, and the most in terms of money spent on postsecondary education, and the US has had better scores than Austria but worse than Switzerland and Norway.  Furthermore, people all too quickly forget the connection between NASA and the US Military. The peak in NASA spending in the 60s is no coincidence - this was the height of the Cold War, and both the US and Soviet Union wanted to show their technological dominance, and space was the obvious area to demonstrate. Both saw military considerations from space, and saw it important to demonstrate their capabilities since dominance of space means dominance on Earth.  The first astronauts were all sent into space on converted ICBMs originally designed to launch nuclear weapons around the world at a moment's notice. The first astronauts were all military officers as well. Alan Shepard? Navy pilot, retired as a Rear Admiral. John Glenn? Marine Corps pilot, retired as a Colonel. Neil Armstrong? Navy Korean War fighter pilot. Buzz Aldrin? Air Force pilot and Colonel.   And, many of NASA's aerospace projects have been related to military aviation. It's a part of the reason why NASA only hires US citizens - space has many dual-use technologies shared with the military.  Furthermore, the US space budget is more than just NASA. There is considerable overlap between the US agencies and departments when it comes to space. For one, the US actually spends over $60 billion a year on space: over $40 billion of which goes to defense-related agencies.  However, that budget has huge applications outside of the military:   The US Air Force Space Command monitors space debris in orbit, something critical for every NASA launch of every type. The ISS orbit is changed periodically, for instance, to avoid debris in orbit. The US Air Force is also in charge of operating, maintaining, researching and testing GPS satellites (including the new GPS-III satellites), each of which cost over half a billion each. GPS is free to use for civilians so long as you have a receiver - no corporation owns it. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency isn't just a spy agency - they also print aviation and nautical maps and charts for the millions of planes and ships in use every day, civilian or military.  This includes aviation instrument approach plates for the safe flying of aviation of all kinds of instrument conditions. For instance, this civilian instrument approach plate for Florida shows the FAA logo at the top. What's it say at the bottom too? Department of Defense. Also, here's a photo of a DOD Terminal Instrument Approach Procedure cover. Look who printed it? The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The US DoD does joint projects with NASA on aviation. For instance, the X-51 was an Air Force project that had collaboration with NASA and DARPA to demonstrate hypersonic flight - its implications for both the DOD and NASA are obvious. Speaking of budget overlap, the US budget is often spread amongst agencies depending on the role they take. For instance, the US DOD may need a weather satellite (important for aviation and nautical assets) that is purchased and launched on the DOD budget but maintained under NOAA's budget. Also, there are indirect benefits. For instance, the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets were originally purchased/designed under the DOD's budget for the DOD exclusively. However, New Horizons was launched on an Atlas V rocket - that project would have cost a lot lot more if NASA needed to design its own rockets. Most of NASA's astronauts - past and present - have been military. NASA utilizes a lot of DOD training facilities to train its astronauts, such as the gravity centrifuge in San Antonio, which was once an Air Force centrifuge on an Air Force base (recently divested to civilian contractor control). There are in fact photos autographed by astronauts on the walls there after they came through, but I digress. In fact, all NASA astronaut candidates with non-military-aviation backgrounds go through abbreviated flight school syllabuses with the US Air Force and US Navy to familiarize them with aviation knowledge, terminology, and experience.   It's no coincidence that the three nations with independent human spaceflight - Russia, the US, and China - have historically had the highest military budget on Earth.  edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"

The US DOD R&D budget is at around 12% too, which means the US spends more on R&D alone than India spends on all its personnel and equipment"

dataisbeautiful,3dxqtm,mtwestbr,10,Mon Jul 20 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yah, they did the recent robotics competition, and they recently announced plans on terraforming planets with micro-robots  That's how a lot of R&D works with them - the US government uses agencies like DARPA to manage the funds they give them. DARPA says they have an idea and they ask people, research labs, and companies to give proposals and they hand out grant money to the best proposals.   That's how a lot of grad students in university research labs get funding from DARPA or DARPA-contracted groups"

Aren't there a lot of DoD programs that work alongside NASA, but isn't shown in our ""space"" budget? the DoD has a ton of space programs and black projects going to space that Nasa has a hand in. It seems like people think NASA are the only government agency doing space R&D.   Lots of data is shared from Dod>NASA which, although not direct funds to NASA, adds to their budget in a sense that they aren't spending money building the whole X-37 program.   X-37C in particular (being planned to be about 175% the size of X-37b) which it says is to increase size because of crew, could easily be used for much more.  Very well could be out next Shuttle, and I don;t think much of it is in NASA's budget.   And this is just one project the PUBLIC knows about:  The Boeing X-37, also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), is a reusable unmanned spacecraft. It is boosted into space by a launch vehicle, then re-enters Earth's atmosphere and lands as a spaceplane. The X-37 is operated by the United States Air Force for orbital spaceflight missions intended to demonstrate reusable space technologies.[5] It is a 120%-scaled derivative of the earlier Boeing X-40."

dataisbeautiful,3dxqtm,katushkin,6,Mon Jul 20 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"This data is extremely interesting from a dynamic response perspective. The plot could use some touching up if I had my druthers, I'll put my comments about this at the end.  Consider that funding changes are a reactionary measure taken by policy-makers. Remember your second-order ordinary differential equations? Anyone that took a higher-level physics course must have seen RLC circuits or a mass-spring-damper system.   The red curve (defense spending) illustrates an underdamped step response. The sudden increase in spending in the 40's corresponds to the ramp-up to war. As aggressions died down, there was little understanding as to how the defense budget should adjust consequently continued to over/under compensate over time. Here we see oscillations with some mean decrease to the modern day. Social security spending represents and overdamped step response. This indicates a reluctance to spend. It's like there is a constant force preventing funding increases. This corresponds to a damper in a mass-spring system or a resistor in an RLC circuit. NASA spending represents an impulse response. The objective of NASA were an immediate consequence of the cold war. We see a huge leap in spending followed by an oscillating decline in spending. An impulse response is like dropping a bouncy ball -- with its height moving to zero in time.     As for the plot.   Excel plotting helps the bottom 15% and hurts everyone else. Look at a figure in a modern technical publication. the x-axis should have tics marks and labels. You can put tic marks on the upper X axis but keep the labels below. I think the semilog scale was a good choice. I'd recommend against semilog only if you need to visually integrate the quantity to get a better picture of things ( e.g. energy vs time).   If you give me the data, I'd be happy to make a publication-quality figure that you can use."

dataisbeautiful,3du1w6,trenescese,73,Sun Jul 19 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm shit at ELI5, so I'll just explain best I can.  Higher voltage generates more heat and puts the chip under more stress. That's why when you overclock, you start adjusting the multiplier first until you hit instability, and only then increase voltage to see how much more headroom you have. At some point you'll hopefully have the highest possible overclock with the lowest possible voltage.   Stock voltage is often around 1.1 or 1.2v at something like 3.3GHz and you'll often have to go higher to hit 4.5+GHz. That's why a 4.5GHz overclock at 1v is quite an amazing and unlikely feat. However, if you're the (literally) unlucky SOB who runs at near stock frequency with a blazing 1.5v, you've pretty much ... I don't know, anti-won the lottery?  edit: That 1.5v CPU should've been binned if the data is accurate.

dataisbeautiful,3du1w6,billyesq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"It depends. If the system boots at all, it might crash once you're in Windows. If it doesn't, it's time to stress test using something like prime95. Then it'll crash or throw out errors if it's unstable. It's just a lot of tedious experimentation really.  Ideally, you want a rock solid overclock for when you're gaming or rendering or whatever you use your PC for, so you put it under as much stress as possible for as long as you think is necessary and see what happens."
dataisbeautiful,3du1w6,jplayer01,6,Tue Jul 21 09:25:05 2015 UTC,"GHz is the frequency of cycles; the higher it is, the faster the CPU will be (only if you compare two CPUs of the same model). Voltage is the amount of power it uses. Lower voltage is better."

In general, you only need to increase voltage when you are experiencing instability with your overclock settings, and increasing voltage by small amounts (0.1v) can significantly increase temperatures.  So, that guy has a 3.6 GHz boost clock (he's actually turned down the speed on his CPU), and an incredibly high voltage of 1.5v.

Short story: I work at an organization related to Overclocking (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking). Through one of our partnerships, I have access to extensive data on the overclocking experience of end-users. This visualization represents the distribution of overclocking results of a specific CPU (Core i5 4670K) related to its frequency and operating voltage.  The larger the bubble, the more a certain configuration is used. This visualization represents the ""average overclocking capability"" of the processor.  Just something I enjoyed researching in my spare time. The data is simply gathered from mining our database and importing it in excel. Nothing special.  // edit //  Wow, I'm surprised so many people are interested in this.  To clarify some points:  1) It's the Core i5 4670K (this typo is really embarrassing) 2) Data is gathered via the XTU integration. For those who don't know, XTU is a software overclocking tool built by Intel and features a short Prime95 based benchmark that you can use to compare overclocking results online. (was trying to avoid self-promotion). The benchmark result includes an XML profile containing information such as processor frequency and voltage. 3) I will definitely improve the data visualization next time around! 4) Size of the dot is sample size.

BCLK can be turned up to 200Mhz on some boards.  *edit: I'm really surprised how many people upvoted the previous comment; all of whom apparently have never overclocked before. OCing the bus has been common practice for many years. A good OC builder knows to look for a motherboard that supports this and allows modification of RAM and bus voltages, as well as a GPU that can handle it and supports modification of its own voltages. Just sitting there turning up the CPU multiplier is really basic when it comes to overclocking, and it's pretty unlikely that OP's dataset consists entirely of 100Mhz bus speeds."

A properly configured computer running a 125Mhz BCLK with a 32x CPU multiplier is almost* always going to perform better overall than the same setup running a 100Mhz BCLK with a 40x CPU multiplier (both result in 4.0Ghz processor speed). As you may already know, increasing the CPU multiplier usually requires being able to increase CPU voltage, otherwise the processor will crash. Turning up the bus speed also may require voltage increases, which is why you need a board that allows you to adjust this. A Rampage IV Black or Extreme does. I'm not sure if there are other variants?  *I say almost always because this is dependent on the motherboard. Some boards perform better in specific Mhz ranges; not necessarily higher ones. You could have a board that doesn't boot at all with a 125Mhz BCLK, but seems to work fine at 133Mhz. Part of the fun of overclocking, and the ideal goal of it, is discovering what those maximum sweet spots are and getting the computer to run stably with as little voltage as possible."

The presentation is nice, but it leaves a lot to be desired:   It is most prevalent by revenue, profit, number of item sold yearly, number of transactions yearly, marketing survey, or number of stores? Whole Foods tends to be HUGE stores while Trader Joe's is much smaller. You can't really say that Trader Joe's is more prevalent if it has 20 stores in a state where Whole Foods has 19 because the size, customer volume, and revenue of the stores can be so different. The hex really doesn't add much to the data, though it does make it easier to read the northeast Only very shallow data is presented. This means it's impossible to tell certain things:   A state where Whole Foods is more prevalent by 99:1 would be represented no different than a state where Whole Foods was more prevalent by 51:49 A state with 100 Whole Foods and 99 Trader Joes is shown no differently than a state with 1 Whole Foods and 0 Trader Joes A state with a large population (Texas, California) is shown no differently than a state with a low population (Rhode Island).    I can think of a few different ways that could be better:    A heatmap where each store emits a ""glow"" proportional to it's yearly revenue. Red = Trader Joes, Blue = Whole foods - White = nothing.

I always yielded to Harvard University, which states that Boomers were from 1945 - 1964, Gen X was 1965 - 1984, and Millennials were 1985 - 2004.  But places like the Pew Research Center seem to define a generation as 20 years for Boomers, and then inexplicably truncate it down to 15 years (1965 - 1980) for Gen X-ers.   Even more confusing, Jon Miller at the University of Michigan says Gen X was from 1961 - 1981. But doesn't that logically imply that the ""Baby Boom"" started in 1941? A glance at any population growth chart for the US in the 1940s shows you the answer is most definitively no. That's why I go with Harvard on the matter; it's the only consistent one.  In short, it would appear there are a lot of sociologists at Universities and research institutes who don't have access to dictionaries, since when you open any one up it clearly states a generation is 20 years in length."

Not being able to compare magnitudes of sexes is a huge flaw, as that's literally half the information contained viz. As the author said, it was a choice made simply to make a pyramid shape, not because it functions better.   often in comparison with many other populations.   You mean comparing separate pyramids to each other? Or two populations on the same pyramid? If the former, I'd argue again the author's version is better, for the reasons he states and mine above. In the latter case, I could see the pyramid potentially being useful since it disperses the visual area of analysis allowing for two data sets and more density of information, but I'd imagine the end result being worse than side by side viz.

Talk about missing the forest for the trees.   One of the biggest strengths of the original formulation is that you can stack up a bunch of countries next to each other and the differences are immediately apparent. If you switch to the x-axis format, those differences suddenly become harder to see, because you can put fewer per row, and because at least in this instance things have become more stretched out. The second formation then goes further into stressing local male/female differences (the trees) than the overarching shape of the structure (the forest). Population pyramids are used like this.

Making a stacked bar graph does not improve that readability in the slightest, and instead focuses on the detailed differences between genders within the same population."

I thought it was kind of obvious that different charts would be used when the focus is what OP made it out to be. Is that accurate, or have my educators failed me?"
dataisbeautiful,3dqesa,TigerVert,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily inaccurate. With any chart there's a point that's trying to be made, or a statistic that is being illustrated. In this case, OP wanted to highlight an age-gender disparity. The traditional chart does a good job of visualising which age bracket has the most people. For example, the baby boom generation is easily visible.   Here is where things get interesting: why display genders if one can't reasonably observe differences? That's the reason for OP's new chart. The final chart removes the dimension of ""gee, I wonder how many people are 55-64 vs 25-34"" and purely illustrates gender  As a teacher I do spend a lot of time expanding on the simplifications we were taught in school. Most of the time the story is more complicated, as opposed to the opposite of what was taught  Hope that helps!"

The lower ranked player on the other team had asked another player on their team for advice on a shot that was very difficult and required a lot of backspin to not scratch in the side pocket.  When he finally hit the shot, the ball shot up in the air and took off like a gosh dang rocket and hit my Mother square in the forehead.  Knocked her out for a few minutes and had a bruise that swelled up to about half the size of a baseball.

dataisbeautiful,3dqa13,newuser7877,6,Sat Jul 18 12:20:44 2015 UTC,"Mostly through environmental legislation. The air pollution law was introduced in 1986 and the limits have been tightened multiple times since then. All three pollutants are mostly caused by burning fossil fuels (cars, industry). Legislators in Switzerland (and Europe in general) have placed limits on the emissions and the ammount of pollution per car/factory/... has significantly decreased since then. On the other hand some of the improvements are offset by an increase in traffic."

She kept telling me that they bought their first home and their monthly payment was like ~$80, and their monthly income was ~$500. The ratios nowadays are just way different. We spend way more each month to have homes that they lived in (I currently live in their home, I bought it from the family when she passed away).   EDIT: my monthly mortgage payment is not 16% of my monthly income...and they bought their home new. Point being that people buying their first home have less money each month to live the same."

People don't have to keep buying larger and larger houses and if they bought houses the same size as their parents did they wouldn't be spending so much more of their income on them. Taken with the context of a graph like the one below showing average house sizes it seems like people weren't getting less value, they were just getting more house.  http://www.roostinmadison.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Average-Home-Sizes.jpg"

Everyone was terrified of getting polio.  The thought of public swimming pools brought shivers of fright.  People remembered FDR's polio and knew of people who had polio.  People didn't have to be persuaded to get polio shots -- they ran for them.

They both got exposed to kids who later got polio (one died I believe) and my grandma was shitting herself having to quarantine my uncles and just waiting to see if they got polio, there being nothing at all she could do about it.  Neither of them ended up getting it, but I think it just shows these anti-vaxxers can't really conceive of a society where these vaccinations don't exist and there's nothing you can do other than hope your child doesn't get sick and die.     Found an interesting piece on the public's reaction to Polio in the 1950s. Apparently it was brand new, and no one really knew where it came from.  A neat theory is improving sanitation practices through the beginning of the 20th century actually played a large role. Kind of long but gives a good perspective on the times."

I'm on the spectrum myself with Asperger's, though very high functioning.  The first symptoms of these things usually coincide with routine vaccinations which is why they correlate them.  But many parents notice signs even before these signs that tip them off to their child being different.  And these things happen long before any vaccination.  For me, even though I'm mildly affected today, my parents first noticed I was ""different"" around 2 months old, and even then my mom only noticed because she'd had a child from another marriage. I was my dad's first and he wouldn't have noticed anything likely.  My mom picked up right away things like my skin being more sensitive than my sister's was, I seemed to have more nightmares, etc.    But yeah, even the most severe autism in my eyes is better than a child being permanently crippled or possibly dead from any number of these illnesses.  Far more disabled than any autistic person, especially in a physical sense."

What they ignore is that we had that in the 2000's and no progress was made.  And so far, though there's been some talk in the current congress, no progress has been made on Yucca mountain.  (Reid was the main impediment to progress on Yucca, and now he's out of power.)   So what I always tell them is that I'll believe conservative support for nuclear when I see actual action."

Polio is spread fecal-orally, and cultures of the US septic system continue to show positive PCR data on polio, which suggests that even with optimal vaccine the disease is still around, just not causing clinical disease (poliomyelitis).   Syria would be the prime example. Like the US polio had been pretty much nonexistant and they were using the inactivated virus vaccine like us. However once the civil war broke out, they had a fairly rapid resurgence in polio cases as vaccination rates precipitously dropped due to the social disruption."

dataisbeautiful,3dhn08,sailfaster,32,Thu Jul 16 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest hurdles to subunit vaccines is creating local inflamation to recruit dendritic cells to the injection site. You want enough inflammation to create an immune response (starting the Bcell activation and anitbody creation cascade) but little enough inflammation to keep side effects to a minimum. Dendritic cells do not discriminate at an injection site, they are going to eat pretty much anything that isn't recognized as ""self"" and present it to B cells and T cells, taking up both polio and any other bits of vaccine for other pathogens.   Inactivated polio vaccine is surprisingly effective at getting dendritic cells to an injection site, as much or moreso than most aluminum adjuvents (aso4 and similar components). Since inactivated polio is already approved and relatively cheap to produce at this point it makes economic sense to use it in combination vaccines."

I just basically handwaived it and said ""yes yes, whatever the normal thing is""  I mean - I get that there's a risk of bad reactions to a vaccine.  But there is a risk of a seat belt choking my toddler if it gets caught around her neck and locks..  I'm still going to have her wear her seatbelt in the car.  A lot of parenting is weighing risks.  She might choke on that blueberry!  What if she suddenly fell off that slide and broke her neck!  On and on, a constant stream of worry and it's awful.  But as the adult it's my job to measure the actual risks, provide remediation where I can, and encourage my kid to grow up without fearing every snowflake.

My results were markedly different. I still used the code with the + s.score error, so I'm running it again now.  In short: For any 1.0 submission karma in coontown a the sampled coontown users receive as a group, they'll receive 0.026 submission karma from KIA  For any 1.0 submission karma in KIA the sampled KIA users receive, they'll receive 0.00003 submission karma from coontown.  The only user that showed up in both KIA and coontown in my sample is the automoderator.  post on another forum I made about this.  edit: There was a reply here before asking about the automoderator. It was deleted before I finished my reply, which was more of a followup comment to my first post.  On automoderator being included: It would be entirely reasonable for OP to remove it. It doesn't contribute much to karma score totals as far as I can tell.   The link has been updated to include OPs followup, which agrees better with the second set of data I collected today at a glance. The larger subs are represented more. He there uses a larger sampling of users than I do, and he is obviously way better than I am at making visualizations, and indeed at using the reddit interface, which I'd never used before. Good think I could just copypaste. He also collects some interesting other data. I'd really like to see a bar or pie chart though. I find that the tree map in this case isn't that suitable for displaying the long tail of subs where people comment. The dropdown gizmo which I think should allow me to select that don't work for me. (Just gives a black bar)  In my second collection I did get 8 users (besides the moderator bot) with overlap out of 765 and 1648 ct and kia users respectively.  Since coontown itself is missing from OPs visualization that removes a baseline by which to compare the size of the other shown values. I didn't do any kind of serious analysis of this data, but at a glance it seems to me that both coontown and kia are very insular. Circlejerk-y echochambers if you will. One would have to compare its ""degree of insularity"" somehow, when compared to other subs to make a definite statement on that. This might well be because they tend to use alts. Or not.   If OP happens to read this and is willing to do another followup, I recommend he also shows how this looks with data from kia. That is, sample kia users and see if the overlap towards coontown still holds. Or indeed from some other subs, so we can see how subs usually cross-pollinate."

dataisbeautiful,3djweu,MisdemeanorOutlaw,3,Fri Jul 17 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this very interesting analysis. It's not surprising that a large segment appear to be teenage and male. Teenagers are often underexposed to different viewpoints and people, and harbor the unexamined hatred adopted from their parents. Hopefully they will lose these hateful attitudes upon going to university or just with more real world experience and maturity. We can hope.  It would also be expected that a large number are male as reddit is overwhelmingly male.  I was surprised at the large international cross-section, especially Sweden, but also realize people in other countries may not have a lot of exposure to people of other races and skin colors.  I wanted to point out that /r/fatlogic is not a ""hate subreddit"" although it has been falsely conflated with /r/fatpeoplehate. The subreddit disputes the ideas that cause or celebrate obesity, and is not tolerant of those that hate individuals or the obese.  Again, thank you for a very interesting analysis."

This data is based on people who post in the CT subreddit, but does it doesn't appear to account for what they post. (Maybe I'm missing something?) For example, if someone was in the CT subreddit trying to educate or argue against the racist posters, wouldn't  that user's data also be included in this type of sample? Or another example would be the data about the crossover with /r/teenagers - do we know that all the posters on that sub are actually teenagers?   Don't get me wrong, I suspect the assumptions you are making are probably correct. It wouldn't be a huge surprise to find out that teen trolls are a big userbase for hate subs.

dataisbeautiful,3djweu,nonplayer,-3,Fri Jul 17 05:48:42 2015 UTC,"Precisely what is this data supposed to represent? When someone submits something to a subreddit, do you search the users post history to see everywhere they've posted before upvoting or not?   Yesterday in KIA, one of the top submissions was a moderator for a sub being shadowbanned after asking if his sub could be reinstated. This was interesting because recently the new CEO said that shadowbanning shouldn't be a measure taken against normal users, only spammers. Yet he was shadowbanned all the same.   The user who made that post, I learned via a screenshot he posted was incredibly antisemitic and posted in coontown. That's where at least 4k of that karma in the screenshot came from. It had absolutely nothing to do with his repugnant ideology. I'd be surprised if any of the submissions did. So, that being the case. I'm curious what this data is supposed to represent other than as an added way to demonize subs you don't care for in some way or another.   Is it supposed to tell us that racist people have their own interests? That there's a link between lacrosse and racism? Looking at cute pictures an racism? I see on there that via comment karma per subreddit that the cigars subreddit had some overlap as well. Should I now say there's a link between smoking and racism?  This is just silly.   edit: thanks for the downvotes. feels b4 reals"

This starts to sound like you're rushing to add context that wasn't presented in the data post in an effort to pre-defend. That's identifying yourself as a victim, no?

dataisbeautiful,3djweu,wingchild,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:32:39 2015 UTC,Additional analysis wasn't given    it was by people in this thread. Which is what I was addressing.

KiA is one of those places that people will jump to attack or defend pre-emptively based on what they believe goes on there. Happens every day in a great many posts on a great many subreddits. Not worth being worked up over, imo. =)   Just my opinion, though. I think KiA works hard to argue that folks should be skeptical of slanted views or skewed information. What KiA hasn't figured out how to do well is to convince people that hold diametrically opposed points of view. KiA hasn't figured out how to do it because it's not entirely possible; at a certain point a person's belief in their opinion can transcend data and becomes a faith issue. At that point it's not subject to debate any longer and attempts at debate further reinforce belief in their position.   Anyway, I follow your intent, but I think stepping up to defend KiA is more likely to make you a target for criticism than to help anyone see the sub differently. Rational folks will stick with what the data actually says - which at the moment, is only correlations on a handful of points. (... 'course, correlation != causation.)

What KiA hasn't figured out how to do well is to convince people that hold diametrically opposed points of view.   I've never personally been one to think it's my duty to convince anyone of anything. People are individuals and are more than free to believe what they want. Yesterday though, while browsing kia. I noticed the OP posted a screenshot of their post history. About halfway down that image I noticed there were comments in coontown and turns out he's a antisemitic racist.  Then today I see this collection of data. I figured I'd put that out there and you guys would make of it what you would.   Those that think kia is a racist sexist sub will continue to think that. I've learned by now people get set in their ways of thinking and search for things that reaffirm those beliefs so I stopped trying to convince people of anything months ago.    at a certain point a person's belief in their opinion can transcend data and becomes a faith issue. At that point it's not subject to debate any longer and attempts at debate further reinforce belief in their position.   I agree with that wholeheartedly. well said.    Anyway, I follow your intent, but I think stepping up to defend KiA is more likely to make you a target for criticism than to help anyone see the sub differently.   I don't mind. I've been in this mosh pit since last august. There are a fair amount of things to be critical of kia for, but using this correlation to imply racism (as some commentors have, I'm not talking about OP) threw me for a loop as I thought this sub would be more logic based than 'faith based' as you mentioned above. I haven't lurked here much so I could be wrong.    Not attacking, just thinking aloud. Hang in there. =)   I will, thanks for being reasonable. It's refreshing to get that."
dataisbeautiful,3djweu,Danielle_S,5,Fri Jul 17 07:10:36 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what this data is supposed to represent other than as an added way to demonize subs you don't care for in some way or another.    why attribute malice to the original poster? this is what they said:   Processing the last 5 submissions took nearly an hour, which gave a sample size of 225 of the most recent users (whose posts elsewhere spanned across thousands of different subreddits, with hundreds of thousands of comments). I plan to do another run through over night while I'm sleeping, for hopefully a sample size of at least 1000 users (which will also save the users).  The results I found were still pretty surprising, even with such a small sample size. Let me stop typing and just show you the data.  Wait, no, not yet.  So let me explain what this is. This is a brief analysis of the subreddits that the most recent 225 posters of CoonTown frequent, sorted by total karma for each subreddit, for both comments and submissions, inspired by a cross-posted datavis post @ /r/blackfellas I saw a few days ago (cross-posted with dataisbeautiful). We omit /r/coontown.   i see no reason to doubt the person on this. The data is simply the data they got. the data was never intended to ""prove"" anything, instead it was a snapshot they were going to improve on tomorrow. What it did was take all posters from 5 recent coontown submissions and compile their comment karma and submission karma.    I'm curious what this data is supposed to represent other than as an added way to demonize subs you don't care for in some way or another.    interpreting data is different from creating data. don't attack someone because they created data you dislike. data does require interpretation, what it doesn't require is ad hominem attacks on the creator  that you don't attempt to substantiate.   i don't think the KiA numbers make conceptual sense and posted as much given the gap between comment karma and post karma."
dataisbeautiful,3djweu,chicagofirefifa3,-2,Fri Jul 17 07:19:22 2015 UTC,"i don't think the KiA numbers make conceptual sense and posted as much given the gap between comment karma and post karma.    The numbers make sense once you look at the poster's comment history.   He/She spent the day posting about GamerGate, MRA's, KiA, etc. on /r/announcements trying to link it to racism and /r/coontown. Pushing the argument that KiA should be banned. Most of those posts are abrasive and got heavily down voted. Before that it's a whole bunch posts to GamerGhazi, an anti-KiA sub.  I think it's pretty clear that this person hates KiA and is upset that this opinion wasn't shared on /r/annoucements. Now they have published ""proof"" that KiA is linked to coontown, even though the results don't make sense? How convenient."
dataisbeautiful,3djweu,inhuman4,2,Fri Jul 17 07:39:39 2015 UTC,no all you've done is accused the person of faking the data despite being up front with the program they used. where is the code error/is it repeatable?
dataisbeautiful,3djweu,chicagofirefifa3,2,Fri Jul 17 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"and again why this argument is so flawed is that they did the second run of analysis as they already said they were going to and with the 1000k commentors KiA is no longer a huge percentage of the list (with a massively smaller submission karma despite being 4x the sample size).  There are two different points: this person hates KiA/is possibly what you'd call a ""SJW"": it's probably true given quick glance at comment history or 2 they are a dirty no good rotten liar. Your post goes ""given 1, 2 must follow"" and this just isn't earned. there are lots of criticisms you can level but given op is open with how they got their data i don't see your argument being valid"
dataisbeautiful,3djweu,chicagofirefifa3,0,Fri Jul 17 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that you are trying to be logical about this. But that is not what I said, and that is not how claims and credibility work.   First, I didn't say OP lied. I said his claim was too conveniently aligned with his own beliefs to be credible. If the leader of the KKK comes out and says ""Blacks commit 90% of all crimes"". You would reject his claim out of hand, not because he is wrong, but because he isn't credible source on this topic. His claim alone doesn't cut it.   Secondly, you don't have to lie to mislead with statistics. If I poll /r/coontown and they all claim to hate black people, I can claim that I put a poll on reddit and that 100% of responders hate black people. That claim is 100% true. I can run OPs code on sub that SRS has brigaded and claim that SRS and that sub are linked."

In my opinion, it's clearly the latter.  The attitude of finding facts to support conclusions instead of coming to a conclusion through the use of facts is the type of thing that is plaguing intellectual discussion nowadays, and should be quickly pointed out and discouraged no matter the viewpoint."

In Excel, I first plotted the Doing Business rankings and sub rankings for the USA, UK, Canada, France, Germany and Italy for all but the cost of shipping containers across their border. The cost of shipping container across the border was plotted in a separate chart."

dataisbeautiful,3dlw47,fiat_sux4,2,Fri Jul 17 10:08:30 2015 UTC,It would be interesting to see a similar chart of what the media were covering in each story. I imagine their influence would be quite significant. Particularly in countries where priorities seem to be a little strange.
dataisbeautiful,3dlw47,SmallDrunkMonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 12:10:59 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible terrible chart. It's impossible to tell where each country is except in the first column. Well, let's say it gets harder as you move left to right along the columns. Why not just print a country's name inside each bar? Or an abbreviation for it? Edit: I just noticed after someone else posted images that you could mouse over the chart to highlight a given country. That certainly helps, but it shouldn't be necessary. All the data should be visible at once, not just one country's.  Big fail."

dataisbeautiful,3dlw47,schamanio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"This strikes me as a nice first cut at the data, in that it gives you the ability to explore a lot of data easily and observe patterns. It also shows overall distributions of concern about each source of threat. I don't think it's a very good graphic for making more specific points, though. Maps would be better for showing geographic patterns as well as anomalies, star charts would be better for showing each country's overall portfolio of concerns, etc., etc."

It looks miserable, there are boarded up buildings, overrun sidewalks, litter everywhere and less than beautiful buildings.  But I've never went into Engelwood and I'll make sure I won't, dat place's scary!"
