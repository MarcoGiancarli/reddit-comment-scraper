CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,cosmologicalanomaly,14,Mon Jul 20 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying that I've been a memer since they first appeared on 4chan circa 2006 (ages ago in internet time). I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks.  I'm an internet historian."

CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,k92rYV,0,Mon Jul 20 22:59:29 2015 UTC,My karma's generally positive. Why would you assume otherwise?  This isn't a means to dodge negative karma. I don't want to be one of these guys that brags about his positive karma on Reddit as though it means something. Reddit karma - positive or negative - means dick.

CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,IamKasper,12,Mon Jul 20 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you're saying, but feeling it and talking about in a comment are two different things.  It's more likely the guy was just looking for sympathy instead of seriously depressed/suicidal."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,MithrandirTheIstari,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"yeah, the guy in the post is most likely looking for attention. i just felt the need to say something, i guess."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,prince--of,8,Mon Jul 20 19:52:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe my opinion is in the minority, but I'm pretty sure that if someone were capable of being driven to suicide because of Internet comments or Reddit karma, then that person should not be spending any time on the Internet in a public forum."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,MithrandirTheIstari,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"that's the thing. to many depressed people, even ones with social lives and friends who are hiding their depression, the internet is their safe haven where they can have their opinions and show their 'naked' self without having to coddle or conform to somebody else's opinions.    when you are downvoted to hell and back just for expressing your opinion without even doing it in a rude manner for example, it feels fucking awful. it's not going to make you want to kill yourself, but it is going to add on to everything else that is making you feel like shit at the moment. nobody is going to kill themselves solely because of being downvoted or having a mean comment thrown at them, but it sure won't help the tiniest bit.    and no, your opinion is not in the minority."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,prince--of,8,Mon Jul 20 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"The internet isn't a safe haven though. It's to be accessed by everyone. It's more public than real life. What I write here could be -- most likely won't -- but could be seen by thousands from thousands all over the world. You'll be safer in a crowded subway car, to say whatever shit it is you have to say."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,MithrandirTheIstari,0,Mon Jul 20 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"the difference is, if your opinion is not the most popular one, you won't have much success saying what you want to say in a crowded subway car because everyone needs to keep up face and of course they won't agree with you, at least externally.    meanwhile on the internet it is generally much easier to find likeminded individuals because of anonimity and no need to keep any masquerade up, and so you kind of expect at least somebody to agree with you on certain things. when that doesn't happen, you feel alienated from the place you thought you could say whatever was on your mind with at least somebody still agreeing with you. it's not a very good feeling.    it feels odd trying to argue for depression, the mindset rarely makes sense and it's hardly understandable for people who haven't actually experienced it. yet it somehow convinces sufferers that yes, this is the point of view that is true, that you are an useless piece of shit, the world is cruel and there is no point.    it doesn't make sense most often. that's why it is a disorder."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,prince--of,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"I know it's a disorder, because I have it. And I do understand the difference. I sometimes have a roundabout way of saying what I'm trying to say. Basically I'm trying to say that unless it's a private page that maybe a few friends have access to, the Internet is not a safe space. It's extremely public. Trying to treat a public space like a safe/private one is not going to work."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,JJJacobalt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"i worded it badly honestly, sorry about that. mostly what i meant to say is that on the internet nearly every opinion has people who agree with it and it feels bad when you cant find anybody even there who agrees with you. i dont know, im sorry im not making sense right now. i see your point."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,YouGotCalledAFaggot,2,Tue Jul 21 13:39:44 2015 UTC,"No, I see yours, too! Like I said, I just find it odd that people use public areas as a safe space. But I understand, sometimes you just need to attentionwhore for a bit, or at least I had to do that sometimes."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,JJJacobalt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"internet  safe haven   Pick one.  I find it hard to believe that anyone, even someone suicidal, is delusional enough to believe they will be met with support and emotionally safety on a random internet forum."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,Bluecool,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"If people downvoting a comment can cause someone to kill themselves, they probably shouldn't be alive as it is."
CringeAnarchy,3dyte7,invaderzz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:09:37 2015 UTC,Lol. You get depressed because of some downvotes? Like are you fucking kidding me? Just don't comment. Or don't go on reddit. Turn off the computer. Like this problem can literally be solved by just closing your goddamn eyes. Like holy fuck.

The problem here is that someone is asking for trigger warnings on a sub for sharing disturbing stories. Additionally, based off of the other comments in this thread the story is pretty absurd and you'd be hard pressed to find someone that'd legitimately be triggered by this.   'Triggered' has been popping up more and more frequently because people on the internet (mainly on Tumblr) are abusing the word. They either police things and ask for trigger warnings on stuff that doesn't need it or pretend to be 'triggered' by insignificant stuff for attention.   Not trying to take away from people who actually get triggered."

But honestly, lots of black people open carry, and if they do get stopped by police (just like the countless videos of white people getting questioned for open-carry) they just need to film it and exercise their rights.

Now, because they feel like they're on the ""moral right side"", they are allowed to block this guy's path and yell at him to shut up and call him a colonizer.  They basically opened up the big book of SJW buzzwords and started laying them out. I'm not a gun lover and wouldn't own one myself, but these rabid SJW types are a serious issue.

You're acting like she just tripped while walking and ended up in his house.   She wanted to fuck. She was horny, she needed some cock, but sadly the cock she had sought out turned out to be a giant pussy.   Maybe the horny girl in question would have woken up in the morning and regretted her drunk decision. However regrettable sex doesn't = rape.  Women are allowed to make decisions for themselves. If a woman makes a bad decision a man shouldn't have to go to jail. If that's the situation you want then women shouldn't be allowed to drink alcohol at all if they don't have any sense of personal responsibility."

(2)     A person who commits an offence against subsection (1) is liable to level 2 imprisonment (25 years maximum).  (3)     A does not commit an offence against subsection (1) if—      (a)     the sexual penetration is of a person and is caused to be done by A in the course of a procedure being carried out by A in good faith for medical or hygienic purposes; or      (b)     the sexual penetration is of an animal and is caused to be done by A in the course of a procedure being carried out by A in good faith for veterinary, agricultural or scientific research purposes.   tl;dr: Doesn't matter if you're male or female in Australia, you can still be convicted of rape for taking (penetrative) sexual advantage of someone who cannot/does not consent."

If the only reason it was rape was because you didn't want to after the act, you could also charge someone for rape because you decided to hook up with them and regretted it later.

CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,PanRagon,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"The presumption was both parties were drinking, like in the comment I was replying to. It is different if both are sober. Neither party can give meaningful consent while drunk, so you have to wait til sober to figure out whether or not it was consensual.  Please don't try twisting this argument into the whole ""So it is rape if you regret it!?"" bullshit. It is a contrite talking point that isn't even related to what I am talking about but everybody loves to jump on that and shoehorn that argument whenever they possibly can.  Let me dumb it down for you: You can't give meaningful consent when drunk. It isn't rape if both parties are okay with the sex that took place. If one or both parties are drunk at the time of sex, then the meaningful consent part is completely up in the air until both parties are sober even if both parties seemed into it while drunk. Does that make more sense?"
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,Spam4119,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"You can't give meaningful consent when drunk.   Yes you can and should, as long as the intoxication is based on your own action and not being drugged by anyone else (which is far less likely than some would have you think), it's the same reason you're accountable for literally anything else you do while under the influence."
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,PanRagon,2,Mon Jul 20 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"Ok while it's true that you should be able to give consent while a little drunk, legally that sets a bad precedent and would do little to protect innocent people. It turns alcohol into a grey area, and those are bad when it comes to enforcing the law. How much is too much to consent? How do you prove the rapist didn't force feed them alcohol?  Also, hurting someone else while drunk is different to consenting to sex. In one case, you broke a law and hurt someone so you should be accountable. In the other someone else broke a law and they need to be accountable. The law is about protecting the innocent, it's not necessarily a basis for how things should be in the world."
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,beccabug,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in the grey area. As long as you are awake, and atleast on a basic level, functioning, you should be held accountable for all the decisions you make. I know drugging is a theme that comes up a lot, but I'm fairly certain it's very uncommon, a lot more uncommon than some people make it out to be, atleast. I don't have any studies on it at hand, and it's really late so I can't be assed to snoop around for them, but whether I'm right or wrong, some studies should be out there.  Basically, if you become intoxicated on your own terms, because of your own actions, you should also be held accountable for the actions you make during said intoxication. If you are literally unconcious and incapable of consenting, then of course someone penetrating you would be rape, that much is very clear."

Like you aren't going to find somebody who is big on consent and all that jazz believing that men can consent when drunk as well.  I mean ultimately it comes down to the whole sexist notion that has existed for a long time that says, ""Men always are okay with sex"" which presumes that men wouldn't not want sex, therefore implied consent."

If you're going through with the logic of 'drunk people cannot consent', then we have to accept that legally drunk people can't control or be hold accountable for what they do when drunk. This means that a police officer cannot give a drunk person a DUI, because the driver is drunk and is therefore incapable of making decisions for himself, and ultimately can't be hold accountable for driving even if he is in no state to do someone. Someone else, who was sober, should have made it clear to him that he can't drive, and because they didn't, clearly they are accountable for his mistake and should get the DUI.  Same thing goes for literally anything else, jaywalking, robbery, murder, etc. If you can't consent to sex when drunk, surely you can't be held accountable for what you do when drunk, because you have no control over what you do when drunk.  The kind of bullshit you guys spew is ridiculous. Learn how the law works, stop ruining people's lives by labelling them as rapists when they decided to have sex with a drunk person, possibly while intoxicated themselves."
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,PanRagon,2,Sun Jul 19 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"Where do you think the idea of ""men can't get raped"" comes from? Especially when the perpetrator is a woman? Two sexist notions are at play: 1. Men are always willing to have sex. 2. Men should be able to defend themselves against a woman. Where do you think those two sexist ideas have been derived from? Feminists? I don't know... I have yet to run into a feminist that argues those things. How about from the idea that women are the gatekeepers of sex and men are always the ones that have to work to have sex because it is the woman who stops sex from happening, not men? And the idea that women are weaker, inferior, and again, the gatekeepers of sex so why would a man ever say he is raped by a woman? Rape is a thing that happens to women, the weaker sex, not to big strong manly men.  I really don't understand what is so hard for you to get that when somebody is under the effects of a psychoactive substance that alters their mood, inhibitions, feelings, and logic and reasoning skills that they are considered incapable of consenting.  Your example makes it seem like you don't have any other choice BUT to have sex with the person who is drunk? What makes you so deadset that if somebody is drunk and they want sex that you have to have sex with them?"
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,Spam4119,5,Sun Jul 19 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"What makes you so deadset that if somebody is drunk and they want sex that you have to have sex with them?   I'm not deadset on it, but babying people who drink isn't a good thing. Adults should know that drunk sex is something that happens in this day and age, there is no victims, if you consented when you drunk yet you didn't want, then as others have said, it's a regrettable night. It's happened to me, it's happened to others, we need to stop perpetuating the belief that drunk people are somehow not adults that can take care of themselves. If they can commit crimes, and decide for themselves, then they should also be able to consent. If you keep fucking people you don't want to fuck everytime you get drunk, you should stop getting drunk, or realize that it's a psrt of adult life. One night stands happen, regrets happen, mistakes happen, it's not on the person you just fucked to judge your own mental state and whether or not you can fuck or not. If you are an adult, these are decisions you make for yourself.  I don't want drunk sex to be cut out and criminialized because some fucking idiots don't know how to handle their drink and their actions that happen because of it. Seriously, stay away from alcohol, atleast from overindulging in it, if you are incapable of making decisions you can stand by because of it."

CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,Spam4119,17,Mon Jul 20 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to consent to sex when you're drunk. Actually, you have full control of everything you do when you're drunk, it's not like you're incapable of making decisions for yourself, if you happen to do a lot of stupid shit when drunk, then legally speaking, it's your own godamn fault.  Unless you're passed out or otherwise in no condition to be able to even ask for or refuse to have sex (which clearly wasn't the case here, since she came to his home and prepositioned him) you can fuck whoever you want.  When someone who is really drunk comes to your house for sex, it's a nice gesture to refuse, but if you accept to their offer of having sex, you are still not raping them and you certainly aren't breaking the law.  I'd even argue the biggest 'rape culture' issue we have are folk like you who try to claim that people can't make decisions for themselves when they're drunk, and therefore believe it's illegal to agree to have sex with someone who is drunk. People have consensual sex while both parts are drunk all the time. It's not against the law."

I'm a little drunk right now, but hey, I am still in control, and I can still fucking choose to consent. Criminalizing drunk sex is a horrible idea, drunk sex can be great, and assuming I can't make decisions for myself because I'm intoxicated is fucking bullshit. If I decide to become drunk on my own initiative, I certainly should be allowed to decide what to do after as well. We are adults, after all.  That law is complete and utter bullshit."
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,PanRagon,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so define ""too drunk."" You said ""passed out or otherwise no condition."" So what is that ""otherwise no condition?"" Blacked out?   ""When someone who is really drunk comes to your house for sex, it's a nice gesture to refuse, but if you accept to their offer of having sex, you are still not raping them and you certainly aren't breaking the law.""   This might be a little bit too gray of an area for you... but you can have the EXACT same scenario and it be considered rape in one case and consensual sex in another. Let's talk about a random person you have never had sex with for this example. They are really drunk and they come over to your place for an obvious booty call. They come over and you guys start making out and it leads to sex. In the morning they get up, say the sex was really good and you should do it again, and leave. Great! Consensual sex was had! Now same scenario, but they wake up and then go, ""wait... did we really have sex? I don't even really remember coming over."" Oh shit! You just raped somebody!   You can't ignore the other person's feelings about the matter. It is why partners can get shitfaced and go home and have sex... because they know it is okay with each other and have that worked out. With strangers or people you haven't gotten together with before you really take your life into your own hands. Which is why the go to mantra is, ""If they are drunk, DON'T HAVE SEX WITH THEM."" It protects them AND you."
CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,Spam4119,2,Mon Jul 20 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"Too drunk is very easy to define, they won't physically be able to instigate or refuse.

This is where false accusation come from, and is a huge issue in the US and in thw West. People like you, who believe we should actively baby these folks, and remove their rights as adults, because they decided to get drunk.  If your an adult, you can make your own fucking decisions. You're not a fucking baby,  you don't need to be babied. People their sex partners life over this shit. It's fucking despicable, and so is defending it."

CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,Spam4119,3,Mon Jul 20 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"Based on what part of the world? I assume the US, yes? You can sign contracts when drunk, if you go to court because of it, then the court generally isn't very sympathic towards people who claim they were intoxicated during the signing, unless there were clear malicious attempt from the other side to take advantage of said intoxication, or where they induced it without the other sides knowledge. In most of America (not in certain states, like California, I think), and in most of the West/Europe, you are considered an adult who can make adult decisions, even when under the influence, as long as this is due to your own actions and not someone else drugging you.  Yes, you should be allowed to sign contracts when drunk, just like you should be allowed to get married when you're intoxicated, as long as the intoxication is on your own terms. These might lead to some unfortunate situations for some, but removing the freedom of people who know how to behave like an adult because some do not is ridiculous."

The law doesn't cover most drunk people: it looks like it covers people too drunk to consent i.e. unconscious or semi conscious or unable to speak. Most people know that to continue with sex at that stage is wrong but the law makes it clear. Some SJWs might say that even if the girl is still talking and laughing, she could still be too drunk but that's not what the law says and nor should it, in my opinion. After all, a drunken mistake does not mean you've been raped. I've had sex I can barely remember when drunk with slightly more sober partner ( and regretted it) but definitely was not rape."

I think it's important not to criminalise it as a whole, while also ensuring sex with unresponsive and unconsenting people is recognised as rape, by the general population through education and also in court.  Without victim blaming, women particularly need to be aware how to minimise the risk. They shouldn't have to worry, but then young men shouldn't have to worry about casual violence from other men.

CringeAnarchy,3du8g9,Akula_matatta,8,Sun Jul 19 18:58:46 2015 UTC,None of that was mentioned in the image. All it says was a drunk girl was asking for sex. You can be drunk and still know what's going on in your head and make conscious decisions.

CringeAnarchy,3dvzvq,Potatriarchy,7,Mon Jul 20 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"What is the deal with the Peter Pan hat lady   It's meant to be a Robin Hood hat.  The driving force behind Bernie's campaign is income equality.  He discusses the ""billionaire class"" having ridiculous amounts of money and not paying their fair share of taxes, while the poor pay a proportionally very large amount of taxes and can barely put food on the table or afford education/healthcare.  Bernie has suggested putting higher taxes on the billionaire class (mostly through their large corporations), and using that additional source of money to fund education, rebuilt infrastructure, create new jobs, et cetera.  Essentially doing what Robin Hood was famous for...  ""Stealing from the rich to give to the poor.""  He actually introduced the bill for the ""Robin Hood Tax"" as it is being called, so that definitely adds to the whole Robin Hood image as well.  A lot of the people who publicly rallied in support of the ""Robin Hood Tax"" (back in May) were all decked out in green and wore the little Robin Hood hats."

I guess the green hat is kind of cringey because it's Peter Pan or maybe it's actually a campaign hat? The heavy guy with the tight T-shirt is also sort of cringey. The guys on the right may be there helping out some of the wheelchair people and not be interested in the rally itself.  This could be a picture from any mall or Applebee's waiting area. Unless this is a meta thing where OP's lack of cringe radar (cringedar?) is what's actually cringey?

They're talking about how ogling a girl is okay if she is dressed in a skimpy outfit, and if she gets raped, she shouldn't have been wearing it, she's leading men on. That's rape culture, the cultural ideas a society has that impact their Justice system. Why are rape victims asked how much they drank, or what they wore, or when they were out walking? Because of rape culture, the idea that a woman can ""deserve"" or at least expect a rape if she is out too late or drinks too much or wears too little. The idea that these facts are important is a part of rape culture."

They can't just rip one off some poor sod because of ~stronk biometric locks~."" There's actually an area with corpses of people they tried that on.

I'm female and have a girlfriend, and she told me something along the lines of how her family isn't as mean to gay people anymore, and that while it's still a sin, she won't stop talking to me like she would've before. She almost did, too. She almost dragged me into that psycho christian nonsense, and this was back in 2009 when I was mad into Red vs. Blue. I wanted to like a pic of Grif and Simmons holding hands because my 15 year old self's mind was blown ""THEY'RE JUST SO PERFECT!!!11!"" and she was trying to convince me it was a sin and awful and I shouldn't support it whatsoever. Another friend said that's all retarded, and I ended up adding it to my favorites on deviantart, but still. I'm looking for specific examples. I found her newer/older da.

I once opened a door with my teeth) 5) I always smell things to identify them, an I can't incorporate anything into my life without smelling it first 7) I often hold my paws close to my chets when they're free 8) I sit in ""dog"" position on the floor 9) sleep on my side with my limbs close to my body 10) I eat extremely fast 11) I eat large portions of food infrequently 12) I make it known that I am going to the bathroom 13) I often lift a leg when I do 14) I bite things a lot, and people if I'm ecstatic enough 15) I also lick things when euphoric 16) I scratch animalistically behind my ear sometimes (that one actually developed AFTER learning of the fandom) 17) meat is my main source of food 18) I run (and sometimes walk) digitigrade 19) I rarely sweat 20) Therefore, In heat, I always find myself with my mouth agape 21) I snap my teeth from a yawn 22) I shake myself dry (it's really the best method) 23) I always believe in teamwork. I hate doing things alone, and I always stick to a pack when given a task. 24) I also believe that too many people working on something creates chaos. I prefer smaller teams over herds. 25) I'm a strong proponent of competition and try to bend situations to incorporate it within them 26) I would be loyal to my mate (If I had one)    Those last ones weren't really habits. :O I think I went too far . . . . *world explodes*"

Felt so ashamed that I literally took a shower after it. Why, I honestly don't know why I like it. Maybe I just like massive horse cocks being sucked on by pretty young women. I sometimes prefer it over normal porn, and those days I try just distracting myself with videogames or tv. Hiding it from my girlfriend/family/friends is the hard. Giving it up is harder."

If you actually see an animal IRL and think ""oh god I'd like to nut all over that squirrel"" then you need help, but if you just get off to the occaisonal woman blowing a dog or whatever then you might be in the clear. I once read about that it turns out that people who enjoy watching scat porn are totally grossed out by the thought of doing it IRL, maybe it's the same in your case with this zoophile stuff.   At the end of the day, is it weird? Hell yeah it is. But you have a human girlfriend, and you say you watch normal porn too... so you're probably in the clear"

CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,holomanga,20,Sun Jul 19 07:20:12 2015 UTC,"I actually almost feel bad for them, to be so far gone in their own little worlds that they have to create imaginary friends and play pretend that they have friends. Why can't these people just try to fix themselves instead of further separating from the world they fail to be a part of?"
CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,THOSANDJosh,8,Sat Jul 18 16:30:51 2015 UTC,Maybe they don't think they have a problem.

CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,holomanga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:45:46 2015 UTC,"how long does it take to form a tulpa?  do you think this whole tulpa thing is normal? after all, it's not actually real.  why are you imagining a new person instead of interacting with real people?  Im not trying to be mean, im legitimately curious"
CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,PM_ME_YOUR_BROOBIES,2,Sun Jul 19 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"how long does it take to form a tulpa?   The estimate given on the subreddit is 100 hrs/3 months, though it varies a lot from person to person with some people seeing results quite quickly.   do you think this whole tulpa thing is normal? after all, it's not actually real.   In terms of social acceptance, commonness etc. it's obviously not normal, though in terms of function I feel that it's just a natural extension of the brain's ability to interpolate and make stuff up.   why are you imagining a new person instead of interacting with real people?   I do the latter too! The main difference is that my physical friends don't share a body with me, so our interactions are necessarily limited. The idea of having someone around who I can talk to about anything and bounce ideas off silently, anywhere really appeals to me."
CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,holomanga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:18 2015 UTC,interesting.
CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,PM_ME_YOUR_BROOBIES,0,Sun Jul 19 13:42:42 2015 UTC,It's simply manipulation of the subconscious. They appear in the form of tulpas to make it easier to interpret.  The hallucinations are just a word to describe vivid imagination.
CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,Bossballoon,6,Sun Jul 19 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"Aren't tulpas the Tibetan thought-created creatures that get more power the more you focus on them?  I bet ya'll anything this sub (And people who are into the whole 'head mates' movement that comes along with the self-diagnosis mental illness movement) was inspired and obsessed over because of Supernatural. As one of the 2nd or 3rd season episodes, ""Hell House"", was based around tulpas."
CringeAnarchy,3dqhq0,RainbowRaider,8,Sat Jul 18 21:57:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it's some hyperfocused form of meditation that causes psychosis and they tell people to not fuck with.

Of course we had failed to realize how terrible they were, everyone liked them, and at one point maybe they were actually good. But now, now they are ghosts, relics of a time long gone.

I think it's great to talk about the experiences of being the parent of a transgender child and about the hardships your child may face so that people may understand and try to take action to stop bigotry against transgender people, but your child's gender presentation/identity/whatever is not the entirety of who she is. She's a little girl who probably has a lot of hobbies, aspirations, likes, and dislikes, and the fact that she is not biologically female is incidental to all of that. By all means talk about trans issues, by all means show that being transgender isn't weird or bad or wrong, but she's more than a transition."

CringeAnarchy,3dngvg,rowaboat9,2,Sat Jul 18 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what kind of larping you do. Some can involve like playing D&D where you'd go on a quest or whatever and fight monsters or do rituals. But what I've had experience with is dagorhir, which is more of a sport or game than anything. Some people will get kind of upset if you do call it larping. Most weapons are made with a fiberglass core and closed cell foam padding (it can hurt like a bitch if you get hit hard). You get hit on a limb you lose it, so drop whatever is in your hand or go down on one knee. If you lose two limbs you're dead. Shots to the torso are death. There are some rules about different weapons and armor and stuff. But that's the basic idea. Yeah you'll have a character name and wear odd looking clothes, but sometimes that's all just fun fluff stuff, like being on a team in any other sport. There's different events that happen all over (the biggest one, Ragnarok, was very recent in fact, in Pennsylvania). Different scenarios will be set up and people will split into teams. For example I played a river battle where a certain area was determined as water and you had to have a certain number of limbs in contact with the ground if you were to try and cross. It's honestly great fun and the people who do it are so nice, and not to mention the wide variety of people you see, old and young  from a bunch of different backgrounds.   Tl;dr: essentially yes, but it depends. and it's a lot less lame than it seems."
