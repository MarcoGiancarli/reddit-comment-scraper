I wish it was as 'fast' to use as my Delica, that's the only thing that keeps it out of my pocket at work.   Btw, I don't think your ZDP has a patina. If you look at other pics of them, they all have a gold hue. I think it's just how ZDP is, but I don't know for sure. That's how mine was out of the box.   Edit, the chromium content is 20%, and only M390 is also that high, off the top of my head. It should be very stain resistant."
Knife_Swap,3dc3s6,Juliose1zure,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:13:54 2015 UTC,"You are correct in that ZDP is fairly stain resistant. It has a great deal of chromium (and nitrogen IIRC), however it also has an absurdly high percentage of carbon, and as such is affected by acids. While there was a slight difference in color between the ZDP and 420J2 when I received the knife, the ~1.5 hours of submersion in vinegar (in half hour segments) brought out that color a little more. I experienced some pretty significant pitting and discoloration with a Dragonfly II in ZDP after cutting tomatoes for an hour or two, so I was reluctant to let it sit for very long, even in a diluted acidic mixture."

This knife has a matte carbon fiber scale from ghostcarbonfiber, acid stonewashed blade, satin finish on the hardware, and the clip has been modified for tip-up carry. The G-10 on the lock side has been replace with titanium to match the darkened stonewashed finish of the lock side and clip. Knife is in great condition. The centering is good, lock-up is solid, action is smooth, and a hair-shaving sharp, mirrored edge has been put on the blade. Comes with origingal box, papers, baggy and G-10 scale. The 755 also has an adjustable stop pin from factory which can be rotated to change lock up from early to late and get rid of any blade play. There is one stripped screw on the body from the custom work, but benchmade will fix that for pretty cheap.

Knife_Swap,3d60cn,Mr_Schneeebly,2,Mon Jul 13 21:10:39 2015 UTC,"I'm really looking for cash, and I have a WE, but what accessories?"
Knife_Swap,3d60cn,Davethekid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"Ive got some extra blanks that I bought for it because I also got higher grit polishing tape (up to 6000 grit).  I also bought the collar so that you can adjust the arm to keep the angle consistent when switching stones that are different thicknesses.  Let me know if you're interested in it! And it obviously comes with everything that it originally came with including the carrying case, the DVD, the instructions, the water bottle, etc."
Knife_Swap,3d6kab,iiiwildfireiii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:35:46 2015 UTC,If you didn't already I'd post this over at /r/balisong. Probably have better luck selling it over there. GLWS bud. :)
Knife_Swap,3d6kab,blitz331,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:50:50 2015 UTC,I did and they suggested that I'd have more luck over here.  Can't win I guess...nobody wants me.  :(
Knife_Swap,3d6kab,blitz331,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:31:56 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, hopefully someone picks it up. Its a nice knife."

Knife_Swap,3d5uqx,GnashRoxtar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:33:18 2015 UTC,Well props to you for erring on the side of customer satisfaction. I'm dying to get one but I'll have to wait for my next paycheck. GLWS!
Knife_Swap,3d5uqx,GnashRoxtar,2,Wed Jul 15 17:36:42 2015 UTC,I'll hang onto it for ya! No one really seems to be biting. Haha.
Knife_Swap,3d4jkx,n0umena,2,Mon Jul 13 13:44:56 2015 UTC,Good luck with the sale! This is a good price for a solid knife.
Knife_Swap,3d4jkx,J_Style,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"That's quite pretty, and there aren't really enough kitchen knives on here. I'll take it off your hands. Just out of curiosity, what other knife are you looking to purchase?"
Knife_Swap,3d4jkx,rotf110,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"Cool, pm me and we can sort out the details!  I need a slicer. I'm a big fan of the Masakage Koishi line; I do the bulk of my work with 240 Gyuto and 170 Bunka Koishis. I recently found out that Knifewear has some ""Special Edition"" Koishis with the kuroichi removed and different handles. I might go for the 270 Suji with that finish... I'm going to be able to visit Knifewear in August so I'll make a decision in person!  Also considering a Takeda 270 Suji, but they seem scarce. Also considering taking the single bevel plunge and getting a Yanagiba instead of the Suji... but I don't think I'm going to do that. Also considering picking up something from the Masakage Kujira line, even though I don't need it at all. They're just really cool.   The addiction is real."
Knife_Swap,3d4jkx,rotf110,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll go ahead and send you a PM right away.   You've get a pretty serious Japanese kitchen knife collection there. Take some pictures at Knifewear and post them on /r/knifeclub. I'm sure people will be interested (I think most are in the US), and there aren't enough kitchen knives on there anyways.   I currently use my 6-3/4"" Haiku Santoku the most. It's a pretty strange one, since it's a left-handed single bevel knife. I am right handed, but the bevel is so shallow it's not really noticeable. I completed a right hand single bevel Usuba recently, but haven't used it much, since it's mostly my mom's knife. I do have a Yanagiba-style single bevel in the works, so hopefully that will answer my questions about single bevels a little bit. I know the handle is already a little too low, and the blade isn't perfectly straight, but it should tell me whether or not I want to try my hand at another one in the future.  Also, as a side note, the formatting for the html link in your original post is a little wrong. The order should be [text here](url here)."
