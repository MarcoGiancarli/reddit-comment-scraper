You do not need to move but your hands and you could even use real cards that once ingame they get recognized and represented. Also, having an opponent in front of you that is a real human but dressed as a magician or a knight would be awesome. I can also imagine different environments, like the middle of a battlefield or in a lava-floating chunk of rock inside a volcano. Whatever can provide mood for the game."

Vive,3dzydw,Ree81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:37:16 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that if you swing the controller as though it were a sword, and your character registers it as blocked but there is no physical resistance then you will probably be very disconcerted and off balance.   It sounds like I may have vastly overestimated the possibilities with the controllers."
Vive,3dzydw,Ree81,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"Myeah, you can make it heavier (to handle like a sword), and give it recoil for gun games. But as for actually pushing back when you touch something, no.  And just using my imagination I guess you could have two 'yous' in the game. One which is always 1:1 the real you (assuming full arm tracking), and one which will lag behind and try to keep up with the real you.  Say you hold out your sword and your opponent knocks it away. You'd still see your real hands in VR (say, in white), but the game characters hands could get thrown back and then realistically try to get to the position you're holding your hands in as soon as possible."

In my case, I'm going to buy a 980TI as soon as I get the money, I have a 970 and I know it's just not going to be enough for the most impressive games."
Vive,3e08bx,Examiner7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:40 2015 UTC,Well a lot of developers will be releasing for Oculus and Vive and Oculus has the same resolution and refresh rate so their specs should be a pretty good indicator of what you'll need. A Pentium i5 and a geforce 970 or equivalent.

Vive,3e08bx,darrellspivey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:49 2015 UTC,A good thing to keep in mind is that the display is 1200p and the render area is even larger and then scaled down so you're basic target is to be able to run something at around 1440p and 90fps. I'm not sure if anything can run Unreal Engine 4 at that setting right now and the UE4 stuff so far is the most real scenes out there. It would be ideal to able to run it.
Vive,3e08bx,ErgoNonSim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:55 2015 UTC,Is it going to be possible to buy a laptop that can run either the occupy a rift or vive?  By this winter anyway?
Vive,3dvpjj,DonGateley,5,Sun Jul 19 22:42:20 2015 UTC,"99%?  I agree with you, to a point, but that assertion is a bit much.  Here's what I'd like:  cross platform compatibility.  Sure, a rift runtime won't be able to use chaperone and handle a large capture area, but it could support seated experiences;  at the moment, you can use the DK2 with the steamVR sdk, so basically, continue to support the device and create a wrapper for DK2 executables that will allow the hardware to approximate Oculus and other hardware."
Vive,3dvpjj,sculptedpixels,4,Mon Jul 20 00:56:40 2015 UTC,"They have said many times that you can sit while using the Vive. Now, just because you're immobile, don't think for a second that the vast majority of buyers wouldn't like to experience the full range of the technology."
Vive,3dvpjj,makerboost,3,Mon Jul 20 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"SteamVR has a positional setting for seated/static type experiences. It's something the devs have an option of using. Having said that, one of the best things about the vive is the 360 tracking and room scale. I would expect to need atleast 6'x6' minimum for most experiences that are vive specific with others requiring 8,10, and 12'. I have a dev kit, spend some time with one and priorities change. In this case things like Murphy beds become a very interesting prospect."
Vive,3dvpjj,FutureBrad,3,Mon Jul 20 05:43:35 2015 UTC,"I think now that developers got their hands on the Vive, more will become clear on the possibilities. I'm pretty sure that, while it is a nice addition, most developers will try to find a way to optimize the user experience for pretty much everyone. That will probably mean that, while you COULD explore the environment in a 15x15 room, you could just as easily use a controller for movement. The option is there, not more than that."
Vive,3dvpjj,RowdyGuyVR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:56:00 2015 UTC,"Holodance, while designed as a room-scale VR experience will auto-adapt down to ""standing experience"", if it has to. It sure will be more fun when you have more space - but you won't be excluded from the game if you don't have that much space. And as a standing experience, it'll actually be a little easier, too.  Games where you naturally sit (e.g. in an airplane, or car, or spaceship) will naturally be seated experiences. So I think there will be fun stuff for everyone ;-)"
Vive,3dvpjj,JashanChittesh,2,Mon Jul 20 12:49:11 2015 UTC,"Like many who have posted, I am fine with people wanting to not devote a relatively large amount of space to VR, to each there own. However I think many are underestimating how many people are not only willing and able to devote that much space to VR but are genuinely excited to do so.  If VR does take off like many are predicting(fingers crossed) in 5 or 10 years a VR room may be as commonplace in new homes as a den/TV room.  I understand that many people live in or around large cities. Many of my friends do. I however have decided to commute so I can have a nice sized house and yard. I have lots of space but a commute, most of my friends have little to no commute but they live in shoe boxes. There is nothing wrong with either situation there just the decisions we make that make the most sense to each of us. Again to each there own.   If I were you I would not be too concerned about this. I foresee a lot of VR content being released in the coming years for all types of setups. I could even see games like Hover Junkers  dynamically generate the hover platform you play on based on the size of your shaparon boundaries so if you have a 15'2 area or a 3'x4' area the game tailors itself to your specific setup."
Vive,3dvpjj,xxann5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:55:29 2015 UTC,There is nothing preventing you from sitting and using a controller to replicate walking around a room sized environment. It will be a matter of toggling a checkbox for either seated or standing/walking tracking and input.
Vive,3dveol,dhr2330,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"Eff this website and their interstitial bullshit... Right click, inspect elements, edit html and delete that crap. Here's what the interview says:  Author Ernest Cline considers himself a “full-time geek.”  The Ashland, Ohio, native, who worked for a few years in Columbus, forged his career as a novelist and screenwriter on a nerdy love of video games, science fiction and 1980s pop culture.  Cline wove those elements into Ready Player One, his dystopian debut and best-selling novel published in 2011 and adapted by him into a screenplay for a film to be directed by Steven Spielberg.  Armada, Cline’s second novel, was released on Tuesday and is another sci-fi thriller built upon his fascination with gaming and virtual reality.  The 43-year-old, who will appear on Wednesday at the Book Loft, spoke recently with The Dispatch.  Q: Ready Player One received rave reviews and became a best-seller, and will be turned into a Spielberg movie. How does such success affect your career?  A: It changed my whole life. Over one 48-hour period in June 2010, Random House won a bidding war to publish it, and because of that auction, I got Hollywood’s interest and another bidding war went to Warner Bros. The book was sold with me attached as the screenwriter. That’s when I stopped becoming an aspiring writer and became a full-time writer.  Q: What themes does the novel explore?  A: It touches on huge issues about our relationship with technology, privacy, identity and the Internet, but that’s all in the background of a fun adventure story.  Q: The novel is set in 2044 as mostly a mystery-quest within a virtual reality based partly on 1980s video games. Why did that resonate with readers?  A: They say to write what you know for your first novel and write what you want to read, and that’s what I did. I was lucky that the subject matter is very prevalent. I never expected it to be a best-seller — or even a seller.  It was still science fiction when I started writing about virtual reality. But people who are making virtual reality today are big fans.  Q: You lived in Columbus in the mid-1990s before moving to Austin, Texas. Is that why you highlight Ohio in your novel?  A: There are definitely Ohio influences. The reason so much of the book is set in Columbus is it’s my former hometown. That’s where I moved to work for CompuServe as tech support.  Q: Growing up, you were a passionate role-player in the Dungeons & Dragons games. How did that influence your development?  A: It taught me how to tell stories with my friends. D&D is just improv storytelling with your friends. You have rules and dice to figure out random events along the way, but you’re basically improvising it.  Q: What ideas helped shape Armada, your alien-invasion adventure?  A: The use of drones in combat is fascinating to me. . . . My brother is a major in the Marine Corps who works on explosive ordnance disposal, like the guys in the film The Hurt Locker. They use robots to give them a remote pair of hands to go and disarm weapons. Through him, I’ve seen the effect that technology has on soldiers.  That raises all sorts of issues about the morality of drone usage and tele-presence combat, or fighting war from a distance. I explore the effects it would have on both sides.  Q: Both of your novels offer complex plots with large casts of characters and multiple levels of reality. Aren’t they daunting to write?  A: It’s challenging. . . . I tell myself my next novel is going to be about a family in a small town."

Of course, SteamVR / OpenVR might have built-in support for other controllers and then it's transparent to the game - it'll just work. But as a developer, you could also add your own support for other controllers if you feel those make more sense for your game.  That said ... I don't think many players will have other controllers that they will want to use - and then it's probably not a good use of developer time to build in support. Over time, of course, there will probably be a few other controllers designed to be used with Lighthouse, and those should be easy to switch out."

Vive,3dm2tr,dhr2330,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:06:37 2015 UTC,"Even with that pricing hurdle, I’ll be damned if virtual reality isn’t exhilarating. I’ve been playing games for pretty much my entire life, and I don’t think there’s been a technology this exciting since we made the 2D/3D switch in the ‘90s. Virtual reality has the potential to revolutionize the way we play, especially as it gets more sophisticated.  And virtual reality could revolutionize not just the way we play, but the way we chat with friends, the way we experience films, the way we hold business meetings and conceptualize “the office.” Virtual reality could be the next big thing.  The question is whether everyday people—people like you and me—will be interested in trying it."

Vive,3di77y,dhr2330,6,Thu Jul 16 13:58:46 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree. Some think VR is just the next gimmick but I truly believe it will be transformative across all sectors.
Vive,3di77y,GambitGamer,6,Thu Jul 16 18:09:19 2015 UTC,"I imagine that they are mostly people who haven't tried it, there isn't an accurate frame of reference so they think of wearing their phones or watching a 3D TV. People think I'm madman when I talk about VR but they will see :)"

Vive,3dkpsh,TicToxic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"I see it as pretty unlikely that the space will just scale between users.  It sort of violates the entire point of room-scale.  More likely, experiences will not depend on roomscale for travel, only for interacting with nearby things.  If anything more space will mean you don't have to switch control schemes to get behind that bunker that's 5' away."
Vive,3dkpsh,gtmog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"It's actually exactly the other way round: If you have 8x8, and your opponent has 4x4, you have 4 times as much room. You almost certainly won't move a greater distance because your room is smaller.  The solution is simple, however: Stop making competitive games ;-)  JK ... seriously, though: It's all up to finding the right game mechanics. The dumbest thing people can do is assume that you just take a game that works well with a 2D-monitor and put it into VR and it will be awesome.  That's the greatest thing about VR: It requires creativity and thinking outside the box to get people into the box without them noticing it ;-)"
Vive,3dkpsh,JashanChittesh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:46:35 2015 UTC,"Right but finding the right game mechanics might work out to the disadvantage of those with larger spaces (unless of course the players are playing locally in the same room - im sure that will come soon enough).  For example, imagine a tower-defense type game where you stand atop a platform with 4 sides (your play-area) and each side has a gun mounted in the middle of the wall for you to use to kill the approaching baddies from all sides.  The player in the larger space will need to run a farther real-world distance to move between guns/walls whereas someone in a small space would do little more than turn around."
Vive,3dkpsh,JashanChittesh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting example and if done as you suggest I agree: In that case, the player with the larger area would have a harder time. The question is whether it would give any benefits to scale the game up like that in this case. Personally, I don't think so. I'd rather be able to have more stuff in the area I can walk in."

I'll also put prototypes online soon, so if you have a DK2 + Hydra and a nice set of headphones (Holodance does use binaural audio, of course), you'll be able to try it for yourself and give feedback.

Nope.  If you're talking about the Vive dev kit – that's another story and I'd suggest you contact Valve about that.

Vive,3cvqv5,DJ_Rand,5,Sat Jul 11 11:55:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting, people want to buy a Vive the most. Wonder if that will climb even more seeing as people are really pissed about Oculus exclusives."
Vive,3cvqv5,bask234,3,Sat Jul 11 18:46:22 2015 UTC,I think it's primarily based on the fact that Vive is coming the soonest and no one has any idea what it'll cost. I think Vive and Oculus are basically on par with each other technically. Oculus will most likely have more content since they have had dev kits everywhere for a while. Vive might have some valve exclusives we don't know about though. I might get both because I'm a VR fanboy now.

Vive,3cvqv5,kubuntud,3,Sun Jul 12 01:29:34 2015 UTC,Yeah the Exclusives really put me off as well. I think Valve will have there own as well. But it feels like Oculus is making all there games exclusive which is turning into a disgusting console war.
Vive,3cvqv5,bask234,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:03:36 2015 UTC,My one concern with the Vive is that it might be like $800 with all the talk they did about being a premium product.
Vive,3cvqv5,XenoLive,2,Sun Jul 12 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"$800 for what: one headset, two controllers, and two Lighthouse stations?  That does sound too steep, even with five significantly expensive components in the kit. But I'm sure both Valve and HTC are anticipating that they'll be competing with the Rift, so I'd be very surprised if it's actually as expensive as $800."
Vive,3cvqv5,Pufflekun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point, I am expecting (and would pay up to) $600 personally but it's a good comment and $800 is just too much."
Vive,3cvqv5,kubuntud,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"I really don't think the Vive will cost $800. Valve is smart and knows that wont cut it. I'm guessing that the Oculus will be around $300, and the Vive will be possibly $100-$200 more. Pricing it at $400-$500. Mind you I would pay $600, but I really don't think the Vive will be double the price of the Rift."

Vive,3ctoz4,gabosgab,2,Sat Jul 11 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"3D audio implemented in software will be aimed for stereo headphones, just like binaural recordings. Surround sound is for movies not for games (unless developers specifically implement it for 5.1/7.1 sound systems), those surround sound headphones are generally a gimmick.  It won't work with VR audio, even if it did, it would be very poor quality. Wait to see whether Vive has removable headphones like the Rift, before buying any headphones. If you want to know which stereo headphones to get, go to /r/headphones for advice. Surround sound has discrete speakers placed in certain positions, whereas 3D/VR audio with HRTFs is continuous and only needs one speaker per ear to work (we only have 2 ears so 2 transducers are enough to simulate the real world). It's a common misconception that surround sound is better than stereo; it may be so for movies and/or speakers, it's certainly not true for headphones and sources created for headphones. You may be able to hear directionality from surround sound (or converted surround sound) and get a lot of immersion, but you can't create the sense of being there (audio presence) unless it is a binaural recording (search on youtube for them to hear what they sound like in stereo headphones) or well-implemented HRTFs."

Vive,3ctoz4,mrmonkeybat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:10:02 2015 UTC,Surround sound is rubish I expect nothing less than true 3d binaural HRTFs with wave tracing. But that is more of a software thing the HMD just has to provide a simple decent pair of stereo headphones.
Vive,3ctoz4,_melt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:54:13 2015 UTC,Hopefully binaural recording methods are heavily implented for VR apps. I really have no idea of the logistics involved in that being a possibility for games in particular though.
Vive,3ctoz4,mrmonkeybat,2,Fri Jul 10 23:39:28 2015 UTC,"For VR just record the sound sources in mono, then use the wave tracing and HRTFs in the 3d sound engine to simulate the position of the sound source. This means the sound will stay in the correct position as you move your head around. While a pre recorded binaural sound will stay in a fixe position relative to your head following you around. HRTFs with head position tracking are much more convincing than pre recorded binaural audio."
Vive,3ctoz4,_melt,2,Sat Jul 11 01:30:23 2015 UTC,Do you know if there are any currently available examples of this? It's strange now that I think about it how I haven't seen any articles address the audio aspect of VR in this manner considering how much it could add to the immersion.
Vive,3ctoz4,mrmonkeybat,2,Sat Jul 11 05:15:32 2015 UTC,"An early example that I think was still quite effective was Aureal sound cards in 1998 you can find examples from the demo CD here: http://toni.org/a3d/ What needed a special audio card 17 years ago can easily be done with software these days.

I've made a ""VR-tablet"" (it's a 10"" glass slate with a touch-digitizer) so far this prototype is connected via usb but I plan on implementing bluetooth in the future. All it is, is a touchscreen without any real screen that I want to be tracked in VR, the plan is to use the pc to display content on the ""screen"" in VR. This can be anything from cockpit elements in games like E:D to a keyboard (I'm also currently researching if it's possible to put a camera on the back and use the VR-screen to make a window to real-life while wearing a HMD.  My main ""problem"" is the software/drivers, I can build stuff and make it use generic drivers that works but this prototype still doesn't have lighthouse tracking (duuh..) and as of now it ""converts"" your display to a touchscreen, meaning, if you touch the upper-right corner of the ""tablet"" you get a mouse click/touch tap in the upper-right corner of your display.  If anybody can point me in a direction that would save me hours upon hours of research I'd be very grateful.  (So far, not counting hours, this prototype has cost me $30 and that includes 1 earlier prototype that I broke)  Edit: The part I could use pointers in is making it a virtual display, and not just an ""overlay"" on the physical display, when that is done I only have to make software that'll allow the user to bind functions to different parts of the ""screen"" (should be pretty ""simple"")."

It will be tangible, and its position around you in real world will be represented 1:1 in the virtual world.  Your phone/tablet becomes a device in game you can look at to display other items.  How about the in game phone become a hand held GPS unit to display the map in the in world game? So instead of pressing M on keyboard or a button on a controller to view the map, you have to reach for your phone and look at it as the map, the immersion factor alone is worthy of looking into, as just as an example.  However, it doesn't need to be an actual phone/battery case, it just becomes a track-able object, could be a small book, or piece of plastic with the sensors on it.  Unless of course the phone becomes a touch pad, with in game buttons drawn on the virtual phone.  Now we delve into the world of tricorders etc - the tricorder on screen having virtual buttons mapped to actual buttons on the phone so pressing a button on the phone will map to pressing the virtual button....."

At the moment, I only have an L-shaped area that's less than 3ftx6ft (1mx2m), DK2's camera can barely track it. I can't turn my back from the camera either, which shouldn't be a problem anymore for CB/CV1 of the Rift.   In the future, who knows? I might end up with a much much bigger area for VR.  16.4ftx16.4ft (5mx5m) is very conservative. From my analysis, it's more like 23ftx23ft  (7mx7m=50m2), 71% (35.5m2) of which is trackable no worse than Oculus' default single camera setup, and of 35.5m2 trackable area 70.4% (5mx5m=25m2) has no occlusion due to redundancy of 2 basestations. For rectangular rooms, we need 28.41ftx16.4ft (8.66mx5m). Again, we get 71% (30.71m2) that's trackable, and 70.5% (21.65m2) has basically perfect tracking. But to get the most tracking area and best  tracking, 7mx7m is recommended, and you get the nice 5mx5m area in the middle with some leeway even if you go outside a little.   my earlier comments about Vive's tracking volume  Edit: formatting.  Edit2: I don't see why games can't accommodate both people who can only afford enough space for sitting and standing, and those who can afford much bigger space for also walking. Personally, I think having that walkiing space really makes sense because of nausea-inducing experiences that come with turning the point of view of the player independently of the player's head movements. There are ways to get around that, but of the many demos I've tried, I have yet to see much, if any, good implementation of things like these."

I have about 6x10 if I move a coffee table out of the way and move my computer from a smaller office space into my TV room which moving it is annoying (even though I have a small Falcon Northwest Tiki with a Titan X). Instead in most cases I'll probably want to remain seated in a swivel chair in a space that is about 5x5. :-). Hopefully this doesn't take away from the experience as I still don't understand how it wouldn't take away from the experience when something that is most enjoyable at 15x15 is somehow squeezed into a much smaller space. I guess I'll find out when I get this at the end of the year. Open Preorders already :-) lol.

Vive,3blisk,GarageBattle,7,Tue Jun 30 04:54:19 2015 UTC,"Alan Yates, a hardware engineer at Valve has stated ""There are many modes Lighthouse can operate in, so far you've only seen one."" I expect one of the additional modes will address this type of setup.   But to speculate possible methods..   External tracking is forgone, and you just rely on internal gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer for tracking. The software that is moving the platform has programming built in to correlate the camera position (your heads POV), the platform displacement (the actual chair movement), and the simulated motion (the false scale and sense of movement in game). As I understand, this is how some are already using the Oculus with motion sims.  It works pretty well since you are strapped into a chair, so head movement is comparatively limited.  Attaching the lighthouse base stations to the chair so they move in tandem. The tracked 'room' moves around the HMD. Likely not a good solution since they have a section in the Vive manual specifically about using stable, vibration free mounting points. Add tracked hard points to the chair via some sort of add-on array of the sensors. This provides a virtual 'fixed' point of the in-game cockpit. Then the HMD is tracked relative to that virtual 'fixed' point. So if both HMD and chair move the same, the view stays the same. Chair moves and HMD doesn't, (or vice versa) then the difference is displayed. Tracking points could also be attached to the joystick/wheel to bring those objects into the virtual world."
Vive,3blisk,bluuit,4,Tue Jun 30 05:51:07 2015 UTC,"I work in this industry for a leading manufacture of high end motion platforms and control loading (aka force feedback) systems, and spent some time talking with Alan Yates about this very subject (and some others...) at Makers Fair.      My company is doing VR r&D next, and one of our prime objectives is making a full API/SDK for our clients to be able to filter out platform movements from occupants.    Both Vive and Rift are not pure optical tracking solutions (hence work while dealing with mild occlusions) and also incorporate IMU's. Unlike TrackIR or other pure optical tracking solutions, you can't just attach Lighthouse base stations or Oculus IR camera to the platform to cancel it out.     Instead, one must mount a full sensor package (imu with integrated/calibrated photodiodes or IR LEDs depending which system) to the platform, and use the data that generates to digitally filter out the movements on the software side.       This is a little more clear cut with Vive because they are releasing Lighthouse dev kits right after commercial release of Vive hmd. Oculus has recently announced they are going to allow diy solutions and will be providing something, but there are much less details on that atm although I suspect they will essentially follow suit."

Just add a contraption to attach the Vive controllers to the motion controlled rig and one has everything needed to get it working. Now the steam/openVR SDK only needs to support a setup like this to easily subract ground level measurments from the controllers from the HMD tracking positions (and properly handle the data from orientation/acceleration sensors from both HMD and controllers).

Vive,3blisk,andrewpr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:12:06 2015 UTC,"I am hoping that the Vive will allow a generic way to allow for motion cancellation, where Lighthouse tracks the movement of the motion simulator and you can subtract that from the displayed HMD graphics.   The only other motion cancellation option is VectionVR for the Rift, but that has to be compiled into games on a case by case basis and so far has not got any real traction with developers."
Vive,3blisk,noorbeast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:48:30 2015 UTC,"At first sight, this looks trivial because Lighthouse tracking already tracks your actual motion. The tricky part is that the motion simulator not only moves to create the desired effect but also tilts you to use gravity to simulate acceleration/deceleration (like tilting forward when you use the break - I guess the main part of the effect is not so much the tilting forward but using a bit of gravity).  Either way, Lighthouse tracking plus algorithms designed to capture the effects and probably some pretty intense calibration (player weight may play a role) might do. If the simulator is precise, in other words, if the effect it is meant to achieve is exactly or almost exactly what the play ""should feel"", then canceling out the head movement and simulator movement might actually work."
Vive,3blisk,JashanChittesh,3,Tue Jun 30 09:33:43 2015 UTC,"Gravity is only used for sustained accelerations. Mostly the forces are directly produced by excursions of the platform. Source: I do this for a living.     Lighthouse as well as Rift also use IMU's, so a full sensor package needs to be mounted to the platform to generate the data needed to filter out that motion. It's completely doable though, and is literally the next project the company I work for is doing."

It would also be multi player, with the abillity to interact both with people remotely, i.e. they're in their ship and you're in yours, so you can communicate via an in-game video and/or voice chat interface on your ship, but also able to accommodate multiple players with headsets in the same real space. So you could have your girlfriend be your co-pilot, for example.  The game would dynamically generate a universe larger than could be realistically all visited within human lifetimes, perhaps a single galaxy with a few hundred million stars. At game start, those stars and their planets wouldn't have been generated yet, but based on on algorithm they would be generated as players visited them, and the galaxy would evolve as players interacted with it. Civilization and trade centers would develop that real human players could interact at, but the universe would be large enough that you could just as easily pick a direction and go, and it would be unlikely that anyone would find you. But if you discover a dynamically generated world that is interesting in some way, you can of course inform other players about it and they can go to that location too.  This game must be made to exist."

He's using a controller, not wearing a headset, he's not interacting with objects via his hands, he seems to have no personal presence in the game, just the little doom-style gun that bounces in the bottom right of the screen, there's a HUD, there are floating menus...ok, later on the video there's a spaceship, but there doesn't seem to be any walking around inside it. You just push a button on your controller and get stuck into the cockpit. Maybe you could  headset with this, but other than the dynamic world  generation I'm seeing very little of what I described.

So maybe some kind of action sequence where you can run around, aim and shoot at people with a gun (will there still be a crosshair or will you just aim manually?), pick stuff up from the ground and use it/throw it, and generally just be able to interact with your enviroment. This kind of gaming experience is what I want to see the most.  It would also be very interesting to see first ideas for RPG's or MMO's, maybe it will even be possible to have ""real"" swordfights in VR. There are so many possibilities!  All of this might be a little too much to ask though, because I think the features I am looking forward to will mostly come through the game developers and not Valve themselves.

Vive,3b6cwi,ceno666,30,Fri Jun 26 09:42:23 2015 UTC,"Why are you worried? HTC just happened to be the first hardware manufacturer to work with Valve. There's a reason why Valve have opened up their VR tech to all.  Valve know exactly what they are doing. They are not relying on a single manufacturer for the long-term success of Valve VR. They know that the VR hardware manufacturing industry will get very competitive fast, just like all other major technologies did.  They also realise that the main source of revenue will be generated through software sales, not hardware. They aren't concerned about HTCs long-term or even medium term financial stability. HTC have cash reserves to supply Vive VR products during the launch phase, and that's all that matters to get Valve's VR initiative started.  HTC may not be the supplier of the 2nd generation Valve VR products. But Valve will have plenty of large, high-tech manufacturers jumping at the opportunity to take their place. Do you really care if your Valve HMD is manufactured by HTC? I certainly don't. All that matters is the design, reliability and price."

As with everything right now, it's not quite there yet, but it shows a lot of promise.  Also, you could 'track' your entire arm if you just have a gyroscope where a wristwatch would go. Easy, cheap, yada yada. You then track your hands in 1:1 with controllers, the wrist part of the arm with the gyro and do inverse kinematics on the 'bicep' part, which would actually be really accurate since your wrist can't really change length.

Vive,3b2hnt,mrmonkeybat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:59:56 2015 UTC,It would involve strapping lots of sensor pucs onto your body. I think Perception Neuron where talking about incorporating lighthouse.
Vive,3b2hnt,XenoLive,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:12:28 2015 UTC,I don't think that's possible in the way you're thinking. The lighthouses just send out a timing signal in essence. Controllers use the time they receive a lazer pulse on all their sensors to determine their position in space. This only works since they know where the sensors are in relation to each other. If the controller(ie. your body) is changing shape then everything goes wonky. Just speculation.
Vive,3b2hnt,deadlymajesty,0,Thu Jun 25 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"Right. I was imagining several small hardware packages on your body, to pick up the timing signal. Valve has said that the Lighthouse hardware is very discreet/cheap, so it might be economical."
Vive,3b2hnt,JashanChittesh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"Yes it is possible. It only needs to be rigid at the moment, so perhaps an Iron Man suit of some sort."
Vive,3b2hnt,Jherden,0,Sat Jun 27 02:32:05 2015 UTC,"That's actually something that I hope they'll do. The sensors might be a little bulky to do really nice full body tracking but it's definitely something that I'd love to see. The advantage over constellation is that the calculations are distributed and adding many more sensors does not hurt the system at all while with an IR camera, the more IR leds you need to track, the more difficult it is to not get confused.  I believe it would probably much more precise than the current iteration of Perception Neuron. Probably they could even combine the current technology of Perception Neuron with a few Lighthouse sensors to make totally certain that there cannot be any drift.  I'd definitely buy a system like that ... but I guess for most consumers it would be too expensive. In any case, having general purpose Lighthouse-sensors would definitely rock :-)"
Vive,3ax7l7,deadlymajesty,10,Wed Jun 24 05:50:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's worth adding to the list as it was listed as experimental/demo, but I remember when Valve said they had some cool VR stuff for Dota 2 including:    A Dota 2 VR experience where you see the entire game arena sitting on a table in front of you and can bend down to inspect any piece of the action They also mentioned a life-size Dota 2 VR experience where you're hanging out in a lane watching the heroes fight; they said it was very scary.   It's very possible (and I really hope) these features, especially with the recent Dota 2 Reborn update, could be coming around about the Vive release.  edit: changed link to the reddit post"

Vive,3ax7l7,UltraChip,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:44:30 2015 UTC,"Portal 3 would be a PERFECT game for room scale VR. Portals can be used as a way to span large distances without physically moving very far at all. If Portal 3 is not created as a VR experience, I will be a very sad man."
Vive,3ax7l7,shawnaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about it. At first glance portals seem like a great answer to the locomotion problem, but then I think about how often portaling changes your orientation. VR is already fighting an uphill battle with motion sickness, and a portal mechanic may make things worse."
Vive,3ax7l7,TotesMessenger,0,Mon Jul 13 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's highly unlikely that Valve will port the existing Portal games to the Vive. So far nobody's really figured out a great way to simulate 1st person locomotion over larger distances, which is probably one of the big reasons why Valve is pushing the room scale tracking and experiences designed for it so hard.  The reality is that porting pre-existing games to VR is pretty much always going to result in a sub-optimal experience, so I wouldn't expect any of the big name VR companies to do it. As cool as it sounds to have Portal 2 be your first VR experience, the reality is that it's likely to get you sick, and Valve/Oculus/etc. really don't want people getting sick as their early impressions of VR.   The other reality is that even if Valve doesn't port their pre-existing games to VR/Vive, other people will figure out ways to make it work and be playable, even if it's not an ideal experience."

If I could pay a one time fee, like a normal game purchase, and get properly paced progression... I'd do that.

Vive,3av2lr,ViKingGames,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly, but you'd need to attach a sensor bundle to it somewhere, and the software would need a solid idea of what it is and how it's shaped.

Maybe it's something you could program during room setup?"
Vive,3av2lr,XenoLive,4,Tue Jun 23 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"That's not the way Lighthouse works.  Lighthouse doesn't know anything about physical objects, or walls.  It simply sends a signal  so that a receiver can triangulate its position.  Vive ""figures out"" where walls are by the user holding the controller next to a wall and pushing a button.  The controller knows where it is within the lighthouse tracking volume... so you're manually telling the software where a wall is within the tracking volume.  Once the software knows where a wall is, it can provide an overlay in the HMD when the user is getting close to the pre-defined wall.  You could potentially put lighthouse sensors on any object, but I doubt you'll see any beds with them in the near future.  TLDR; it doesn't work that way."

You start in the game as a spectator in the stands, and can queue up to fight, similar to Dota 2 viewing and queuing.    1v1, 3v3, 5v5.   Weapons are on racks in the starting area along with timed special rack drops, and arenas would have traps and animals or monsters.    With full hand control support for shield and weapon or even duel wielding, even using simpler graphics but tight physics it would be a very skill and strategy oriented game.    I could see paid tournaments of something like that becoming a huge deal.  I would buy a ticket to watch and compete in a tournament like that, especially if there was a cash prize to the winner.

Being so old, they're now doing a complete overhaul to bring their engine to state-of-the-art, including a graphics mega-upgrade. They were some prophetic - or lucky - bastards starting their content-collecting so early. IMO, it quite closely represents RPO's metaverse."
Vive,3al501,lefnire,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I vaguely remember Second Life, Will take a look at the new version eventually I guess. For me the traveling between realms, or planets as they do it in RPO, should be something similar to a space simulator game like Elite. There is several examples of open world games of all kinds so that tech is in. The biggest clue is to make interaction between the world and the player. The use of hand tracking or even better. Truly haptic controllers. in the sense that you feel physical resistance when you touch something in games. With that, and the VR I expect to have access to in a couple of tech generations. I think I will be comfortable working in a virtual environment."
Vive,3al501,F4cele55,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"If you want a metaverse like Oasis depicted in RPO I think the likely candidates to start that are Facebook and or Valve.    They need only to create a VR version of their products.  For instance you log into VR Facebook and instead of starting at your splash page you start in a room.  Everyone gets a simple room / apartments for free on Planet Facebook.  In this room you can access all your normal feeds and do your Facebook stuff or people can come over to your apartment and hang out.  You can buy stuff for the apartment so when people come visit you they see it.  Then when your bored you leave your virtual apartment and go explore the virtual city around you.  Go to Virtual malls where you buy real live stuff you then send to your home or you teleport to other worlds for a fee where you can enjoy entire planets dedicated to games.  Once full realized it is going to be really cool but it is no joke in terms of development challenges. Growing it will require some crazy middle ware products and likely this is years away because a ""kinda, sorta"" version of Oasis is going to be really boring really fast and you can argue that all the best games are more profitable outside of Oasis. Playstation Home was like that and it stunk.  But this could be better  Which is why I like Valve to do this because they are gathering the motherload of legacy software and they can plug it all into there and give us access.  Like I said this is going to take some really crazy development."
Vive,3al501,coderedmonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Well in the books the Oasis began as an online multiplayer VR game in 2015.  As the years went on it became more and more of a social tool, and even became a primary form of public schooling.    Stuff like haptic gloves and suits didn't happen until years later.  I easily see us having fairly functional haptic gloves and suits that allow you to feel texture, temperature, touch and sensation by roughly 2025-2030.  Within 15 years I imagine the early tactile pixel technology will have advanced enough to see early consumer hardware."

Vive,3aic2n,affero,3,Sat Jun 20 19:54:40 2015 UTC,I meant car! Sorry i have fat fingers.   I was wondering if the road vibrations from a car would mess up a stationary lighthouse inside a vehicle since the lighthouse beam might hit the sensors more than once
Vive,3aic2n,CaptainHatdog,3,Sat Jun 20 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Movement of the lighthouse will affect the tracked object, exactly as if you were looking at the object through a camera lens. Shaking is not a big problem, as linear movement will translate one to one, you might experience the shaking though. If the angle changes, things will move around a lot. At 1 meter, changing the angle 1 degree will translate to about 17 cm of linear movement.  The sensor works by measuring a pulse and then a scanning light. So devices will only ""measure"" once pr pulse. At 1 meter the scan line move at more than 1000km/h. I find it highly unlikely that a car makes anything move that fast. You would really have to mess up the mount for it to not work.  Reasonably there is no minimum distance. The lighthouse has a fairly wide angle view, so unless you want to be something like 3 centimeters from it, there wont be a problem."

Vive,3aic2n,solarahawk,2,Mon Jun 22 04:40:05 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you're going to get all the equipment powered inside your car. Plus, space would be very limited unless you were in a van, bus, or cargo truck. But if you do manage to do that, you're right, the vibration may cause less-than-optimal tracking.  You should probably pay attention to the road, though."

Vive,3ah2am,UltraChip,0,Mon Jun 22 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"DK2 looks like 640x480 close up, pretty nasty.  The higher resolution and filters they have put in CV1 should improve things a lot.

Vive,3ah2am,UltraChip,2,Tue Jun 23 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think not. All the power needed  would be to render a full HD monitor with a game that runs in full HD. The 4k would be needed for it to be sharp in ~40 degree area. The rest of the pixels from total ~120 degree area wouldn't be used at all apart from the moment head tracking is involved. It means that if we actually had 4k hmd's today we could totally use them as normal (HD) monitors. However, you are right that the current GPU's wouldn't be enough to power 4k VR environment which would require rendering in whole 120 degree area."

IIRC one of the Cloudhead developers (Cloudhead is one of the first studios making a Vive game) claimed to have seen the final design, and claims it is quite different than what we've already seen.  My guess would be that in the next month or two, Valve will put up final specs and discuss their consumer version.  That will be the time for the VR community to discuss the pros and cons.  Until then, we're comparing the consumer version Oculus to a Vive devkit.  And besides, we can't even PREorder either of these products yet.

Vive,3afulx,LordHemuli,11,Fri Jun 19 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt it. Old versions of the Oculus SDK were only distributed as a statically linked library, which means the driver is essentially built into the game, and you can't upgrade or replace it without completely recompiling the game.  Every time they released an SDK without a DLL, I complained loudly on the forums that they need to do this for forward compatibility. With 0.5, they finally changed their library over to a stub that loads a DLL from the runtime, but then shortly after, they dropped Linux and Mac support, so I deleted all my Oculus shit and stopped following them."

Were they all too busy snorting coke the past 6+ months to produce something functional?)  I figure they'll get deeper into mobile, given their Facebook overlords, and then Samsung (on whom they depend) will copy all their IP and run them out of the hardware business.  They'll still have a successful online social platform to fall back on, but people will get bored hanging-out with real people once exotic AI assistants begin catering to their every whim.

However, engines like Unity/Unreal/CryEngine are adding ""generic"" support for VR hardware, which will enable demos built in coming months to run, theoretically, on every headset available.  knocks wood  It's possible that someone may hack an Oculus driver to run old demos on the Vive, but I wouldn't hold my breath for it.  Just as nobody really misses running DK1 demos on their DK2, once we have consumer-grade hardware and the superior experiences that run on it, we won't be missing the old DK2 demos much."
Vive,3afulx,kideternal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:24:37 2015 UTC,Not a chance. Don't count on a hack either.  It isn't that easy.  My main concern for the Vive is what will actually be available to play in 5 months when it launches.  I just can't believe they are going to market with non existent software support.  To be clear - 3 months ago the Vive didn't even exist and now its launching in November. Good luck with that. If Valve / HTC pull this off its going to be legend in ten years when we look back at this all.
Vive,3abnoj,Baogwa,10,Thu Jun 18 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can track basically an arbitrary number of devices using lighthouse, so that should be completely possible.  I don't remember if it was Chet or Alan Yates from Valve that said it, but one of them said they've had several people being tracked with different headsets in the same room already."
Vive,3abnoj,miked4o7,2,Thu Jun 18 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I believe you, I'm just surprised nobody with a dev. kit. has said anything.  I'd guess they're probably under NDA though."
Vive,3abnoj,sculptedpixels,2,Fri Jun 19 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"And they've probably been focused on single player experiences to date - keep in mind, very few people will buy these compared to cell phones or consoles, so the odds of same room multiplayer experiences catching on requires quite an investment in the vives, pcs and software.  Don't get me wrong though, it's one of the first things I want to experiment with!"
Vive,3abnoj,nihkee,3,Mon Jun 22 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should be possible. There's no solid info on this but I can't see reason why not as the basestations are dumb (not connected to a PC). Wires could become a problem, however."
Vive,3abnoj,nihkee,2,Thu Jun 18 20:15:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not really concerned about wires at the moment.  People jokingly call our room a ""NASA Command Center""  because of all the wires/cables.  A few more won't hurt.  I asked a the same question in regards to the Rift.  Apparently the Rift can strobe the I.R. L.E.D's in different frequencies so it would be possible to use two in one room.  I'm hoping the Vive is capable of something similar?"
Vive,3abnoj,zootam,3,Thu Jun 18 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"Vive and rift have different ways of doing the tracking. Opposite ways, in fact.  Rift has a camera which is connected to a PC, so the camera calculates the position by seeing the ir led array on hmd/controllers.  With vive however the headset does the calculation and it uses the base stations to get the absolute position to compare to.  With this in mind, I'd think that with vive adding more HMD's in the same place would be easier.  We'll see that in the near future."
Vive,3abnoj,zootam,2,Thu Jun 18 20:31:40 2015 UTC,I understand.  Since the Vive tracks the absolute position of itself in the room it probably won't matter if there are other Vive's in the room.  I hope you're right!  Thanks.
Vive,3abnoj,Nico_,2,Thu Jun 18 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't matter. Theoretically you could have way more than 2 hmds in a room until they/the wearers started occluding each other. Hopefully Alan Yates can confirm.  But you might have problems using 2 units in such a small room at the same time, especially with all the cables.  It may be more trouble in practice than it is worth in your case."

Vive,3abnoj,XenoLive,2,Thu Jun 18 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should have been clearer. When I meant problems, I did not mean with tracking. Should track perfectly with 3 or 4 base stations.

For eye damage to occur, it needs to deliver a certain amount of energy onto the retina (or other parts of the eye, depending on wavelength) in order to heat up and damage the tissue. If the laser isn't powerful enough, the tissue can absorb and dissipate the energy faster than the laser can deliver it.  Vive's lighthouses internally use a class 3B laser, which is pretty dangerous when looking directly into it. But, what comes out of the lighthouse once the laser light has gone through all the optics is class 1, which is deemed as ""unconditionally safe under normal use"". Unless you use lenses to intentionally condense a class 1 laser, you can literally look into it all day without any lasting effects.

Vive,3a9t0i,ourosoad,2,Thu Jun 18 17:23:48 2015 UTC,For the devkit Valve recommends max. 15ft/5m - that is probably a conservative value that should work under all conditions. Some devkit owners report that they achieve great tracking up to 20ft distance. So I would say if you stay with max 15ft it should be pretty accurate in showing you the minimum available tracking volume that is covered by both and just one base station.
Vive,3a9t0i,ourosoad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:29:59 2015 UTC,So my room is 14ft by 20ft. Does this mean I only get good tracking in the dark green overlap area or anywhere that is green?
Vive,3a9t0i,coderedmonkey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"You get optimal tracking inside the dark green overlap area. Inside the brighter green areas you're only tracked by one basestation - which is also more than enough for great tracking, but issues might occur if you occlude most of the HMD/controller sensors.  Generally I think it's safe to assume a 16.4ft range as Valve throws around the 5m but does a weird meter to foot conversion.  Also my calculator puts the base stations always in opposite corners. For your room it might be more optimal to put the in the middle of the walls."

If fucking a robot doll frees my mind and resources to pursue more interesting and ""special"" relationships (where sex can still happen, perhaps more meaningfully) that would be a win for me... and the environment... and our social structures and for human evolution.  Maybe computers won't rule us... they will let us rule ourselves more effectively.  You could argue that we have an abundance of food (as we would have with sex in my scenario) and many people just get fat as a result. On the flip side however, we are more able to dedicate ourselves to education and art and other interesting subjects because we spend a lot less time creating food.

I truly think that VR sex could help to reduce unwanted pregnancies, change the way females live (save time and money on all of that makeup and clothing they think they need and instead invest more time into who they are) and ultimately lead to a sort of cultural revolution. I would pay $10K+ for a robotic experience like this and I would choose to virtually skin my robot as Stoya :D  You can already approximate this sort of thing using a Fleshlight with VR Stroker app and looking into a monitor (as you interact with the toy the video responds to your movements) and you can take it even further with a meki doll http://www.toydemon.com/meiki-plush-doll we are getting close and I can't wait!

They may not have even been the first kids on the block to start working on this, but they do have a lot of bright minds working on this, and I welcome anyone that helps make VR a reality.  If Oculus ends up being the cheap mass market appeal VR solution, the casual facebook game equivilent of the video game industry, and vive (or someone else) ends up being the higher end techie go to, that's fine with me. If the market is established, people will totally filter up (they do it with TVs and phones, they'll do it with VR headsets too), and the more people that are involved, the more publishers will be willing to drop money to advance VR and make VR goods.  I have no allegiance though. I want great specs (fov, refresh, lots of pixels, low latency, etc), and I want screen replacers. I really want AR, but I'll settle for VR simulating huge screens that look high res to me. I dream of a day when I can sit on a castle overlooking the sea with 15 screens around me all of various programs I have open. I play the game in front of me, maybe it's HOTS, and while I'm playing, I quickly look over to the right and check my skype, scroll it down a bit with my finger to read the new messages, then over to my left and look at the youtube video that's playing music to see what's happening, then back to my game. Then I check up and to the left to see if my okcupid has gotten any new replies and to the side of that to see if there are any reddit updates. I say, ""Cortana, look up cheap alternatives to steam cleaning my carpet"". She gives me some sass about being lazy, but pulls up some useful results. Then I go back to my game. I died because I wasn't paying attention. But it was glorious.  Was I playing hololens, magic leap, oculus VR, Vive, gear vr, starvr? Doesn't matter to me, as long as it comes.  Also the video made me laugh."

Vive,39s4s6,no_flex,5,Sun Jun 14 05:45:10 2015 UTC,"It depends on the reason for production, I think.  For example, I'm running Linux now, an free open-source project made up of code that has been freely donated by tons of people all over the world over several decades. It's a high quality OS, made through cooperation. A huge percentage of servers run on it. Nearly all (something around 95% I think) of supercomputers are working on Linux. That's all cooperation, because the focus is quality.  Competition drives novelty, however. When things need to be (re)invented, you can't play it safe. Organizations that are after profits need to find ways to get the money that we have in our wallets, so they will think up new stuff that attracts our attention or just locks us in. Competition can be a great thing because novel solutions are good for consumers, but it's also dangerous because you can also get things like lock-ins and gimmicks.  I'm a huge fan of openness and doing what is right for the consumer. I believe that if you treat your user-base well, they will treat you well. I'm just not so sure if Oculus's interests line up with my own and that they're leaning towards lock-ins."

""hmm, can I do this, let me look it up"".   The fastest to easier ratio way would be to do a Debian net install.   https://www.debian.org  of course if you're hardware has non open source drives you'll have to learn how to enable that in the repos, figure out your hardware, and install it. Perhaps thats too steep of a learning curve.  Then do http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/8.1.0/amd64/iso-cd/  and have your non free drivers.  When you're doing a net install, you can choose a desktop, or not. If you don't thats pretty good for learning and customization. Because you get a shell that you can install things in. Just learn the basics of your distros package manager and then you can use the arch wiki for everything else.  For example, the page on thunar, a light weight file manager. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Thunar#Installation   Install it with    sudo apt-get install thunar   but the rest of the page applies.   same with openbox,    sudo apt-get install openbox   https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Openbox then you can read this.  you'll learn about things like Login Managers, Startx, customization, sudo etc.   commands give some pretty good messages, so read them and look them up if you have problems.   Curious? look it up, everything is documented and open.   (or use the very dense manual that comes with them, which can be invoked with     man   commandname    )  and of course there is /r/linux /r/linuxmasterrace /r/linuxhelp  /r/linux4noobs   of course you can start with ubuntu, and learn slowly but surely."

There is an underlying narrative here that is not understood by many.  To play off what you said, SOMETHING HAPPENED.  THE FOLLOWING IS a MIX of SPECULATION and some things that have been confirmed along the way and it is all based on allot of stories I have come across the last couple of years. I am not claiming all this is 100% FACTUAL but read and you might see how much it makes sense.   I have read different versions of what went down between Oculus and Valve.  I knew about the employee poaching but I thought that followed behind the break up. Maybe someone can confirm this?     It is well known that Oculus and Valve were buddy buddy very early on.  They were collaborating and felt they had a natural synergy.  Keep in mind that this was prior to MAR 2014.  Valve has always traditionally been a software first company that dabbled in hardware but mostly with the intent of setting standards for others to build on.  Oculus was going to be the hardware supplier and that was great because they both felt they complimented and would not directly compete.  All was good in the land of the technorati elite....then something happened and I have read different accounts as to what that was.    I tend to lean towards the rumor the idea that Oculus at some point backed away from the idea that they would settle for just being the hardware guys and it started a ""rift"" with Valve who became concerned they might want to set up their own software shop and competitor to Steam on the VR front. If anybody has a link about this please post it as I have never been able to confirm it.  I can't find the old stories that were circulating around the time that Valve and Oculus had their falling out. In any case none of them claimed to know 100% it was true either by the way.  It was rumors and speculation why suddenly they stopped talking.  The narrative that was spun was that it had to do with the Facebook acquisition.  Something happened, maybe it was the FaceBook acquisition.  It is pretty obvious  that Lucky changed his mind about the direction the company was to go and Valve suddenly shut them out. He routinely spoke about the possibility of creating an open source format and being very open going back to his kickstarter days.  In his defense he also said many time he was not sure and it was too soon to tell. But soon after he made up his mind Valve started plotting the Vive. Secret meetings were held with choice  developers under strict NDA only invites. HTC and Valve formed a partnership. Lucky for his part dropped the openess crap and made it known that they were going to do hardware and compete on the digital software delivery side as well.    Valve at the time was intimately familiar with Oculus' plans and would have know exactly what their 10 year plan was and all their launch details.  For instance as Lucky stated quite often and does even today they intended to go to market with the least expensive package possible.  I do not believe they had any intention to ship CV1 with ANY controller much less the Xbox one.  It would be an added expense that was unneccesary back when they had no competition.    Fast forward to MAR 2015 or thereabouts and Valve / HTC drop the Vive and Lighthouse and the VR torch controllers and told everyone yeah we are going to cost more but VR is a new beast and requires a new kind of controller one made for VR and we are the best game in town.   The reviews were phenomenal and the Vive by all accounts was the best VR experience anyone had ever seen to date.  It was a problem for Oculus.  Suddenly, at least by comparison, they looked like a step down from this cadillac offering from Valve and HTC.  Better latency, better controllers even slightly higher res. Oh yeah and they are launchin 3 months ahead of you.    Fast forward to 4 days ago and you understand what the surprise Xbox controller announcement was about as well as all the talk about Oculus Touch.  Think about it a second..  Suddenly there is this controller that looks pretty well developed but had no software and no one had ever heard of it prior to E3.  Well, they had no intention to show off Touch for many many months from now but after Valve made such a big splash they quickly cobbled together a quick demo so they can show it at E3 and they threw in the Xbox controller because that is what they have spent the last 3 years building for anyway and at least now they can claim they A. Have a controller shipping with the HMD and B. They have a kick ass VR ready controller in the works COMING SOON.  Screw that the obvious criticism that this device should have been made ready to go with the Oculus launch. They had to know there was going to be that backlash but a VR controller in 3 months is better than standing before the masses and saying ""Yeah we got dick guys, hey how about an Xbox controller?""  I believe Oculus has spent the last few months Scrambling to put together that demo with the Oculus touch and probably signed Xbox on because they know something that I know which is that the Xbox controller is very popular amongst PC gamers and they hoped it would carry some cache.  Plus its an easy connect with Windows anyway.  All this nuttiness the last few days was caused by Oculus and their mad scramble to save face."
Vive,39sibg,Kyderra,3,Sun Jun 14 09:34:47 2015 UTC,"AFAIK there has been no official info on this. I, personally, would be very surprised if this functionality wasn't included at launch. Hopefully at least as good as Oculus Cinema."
Vive,39sibg,JKJ420,2,Sun Jun 14 13:09:39 2015 UTC,"We don't know if they will have official apps to watch movies but even if they don't, there are already a lot of good virtual screen apps that support 3D movies for the DK2, that can all be easily ported to the Vive and upgraded for the Rift.  Partnership with movie studios can also mean VR movies, which are much better than 3D movies."

Because no pure VR player comes with a Bluray license, so you are stuck to licensed ones for Bluray 3D. Or you rip your Blurays to stereoscopic formats like ""sibe by side"" or over and under"". These formats are supported in VR players and that is the format stereoscopic TV shows are aired. Regards  noos"

For me it's not really a choice anymore.  But I can't believe how often I have to explain people that it's not a choice between a standing and a seated experience. The Vive doesn't force you to stand in your room.  So there is actually no advantage the Rift has over the Vive other than maybe price.  There is also a lot of damage control from the hardcore oculus community going on which made me unsub from there but they seem to downvote critical posts here, too.

An X1 controller was about their only option until they got their controller ready. Then, what else, X1 streaming app works on Oculus? That's hardly a partnership, that is MS doing minimal work to make a peripheral work with an app of theirs. The conclusions people are jumping to based on these mundane announcements are idiotic."

Vive,39o738,JashanChittesh,2,Mon Jun 15 15:57:30 2015 UTC,The price could be the main factor tho. A couple hundred $ difference will make all the difference. Not to mention if someone only wants to use it for a seated experience why would they pay more?
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:03:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Vive are really going to have to sell the use of space with new experiences to justify the mark up.

Vive,39o738,Mrdicat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:51:57 2015 UTC,Depends on price but $300-$400 vs $500-$600 is a huge difference. Not to mention most wont have enough room for moving around anyway.
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,2,Mon Jun 15 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"The rift will probably be $300 and the Vive $500!

Vive,39o738,Mrdicat,3,Mon Jun 15 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"plus, you have to factor in the controllers that are not included with the rift while valve certainly implied that the controllers and the 2 lighthouses(with possibility to add more on your dime) was a done deal."
Vive,39o738,ZeM3D,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:54:59 2015 UTC,I know you can. But if you only want seated why pay an extra $200?

If they were released on the same day, I'd tottally agree with you, but since they will need to wait around 4 months anyways, might aswell get the better HMD for ''little'' more!"
Vive,39o738,Mrdicat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:52:14 2015 UTC,"But is it better if you are sitting down? Would rather save $200 if you are only sitting down. And no its not a little bit more, its a lot more. $30,000 to $30,200 is a little bit more but $300-$500 is getting close to double."
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,2,Mon Jun 15 10:48:55 2015 UTC,"It has the same specs, so... And like I said TWICE, in 4 months, $200 is basically nothing for most people!"
Vive,39o738,Mrdicat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"Lol. Are you kidding? For most $200 is a lot. 95% of people would wait the 4 months(which is a complete guess that you made, since neither have release dates).  $300 > $500 is a huge increase. Stop thinking just how you veiw it and think how normal people would."
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,2,Tue Jun 16 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"Because it's not only a significantly more flexible solution (you may only want seated today and find out tomorrow that there's an awesome game where having a little bit of room to move and change your mind) but it's also a solution that has everything you need: HMD, tracking, controllers.  With Oculus, you get the Xbox One controller (which IMHO is just a workaround that devs are currently using because they don't have anything better - but it's not really suited well for VR) ... and then yet another few months later, you have to buy the ""real"" controllers in addition."
Vive,39o738,JashanChittesh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"People dont buy for what they may want one day. If someone thinks ""I only want to use VR seated"".

Its not worth."
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:07:32 2015 UTC,"There's quite a few assumptions in there: We don't even know the actual prices, yet. The difference could be less, it could be more. And some people do consider flexibility in their purchasing choices.  What I do know is that for me, the experience with the Vive prototype was mind-blowing and very close to ""true VR"" while the experiences I've had with Oculus is more like an expensive 360° 3D display. That's still ""pretty cool"" ... but just that.  If you're satisfied with ""pretty cool"" - save your bucks. I want awesome."
Vive,39o738,JashanChittesh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:36:58 2015 UTC,"Lol. NO it couldnt be less. Vive has the headset, the controllers and the lighthouse sensors. I never said people didn't, all I am talking about is the people that 100% only want seated. Oculus is awesome, Vive is also awesome. Moving around n VR will be fun to try, but in the end the tech is too early for it to be something you use a lot."

I don't have a trailer, but I might one day, so maybe I'll get the hitch option on my car. I don't have a kid, but I might soon, so I'll buy a house with an extra bedroom. I don't want to play this game on Steam right now, but it's on sale for $1 and I might want to one day so I'll add it to the 100 other games I own but haven't played. PS4 has better games right now, but XB1 might get another Halo title one day, so I'll buy that instead. I might not want a stand-up VR experience right now, but a sweet game might come out one day that works best standing up and I don't want to be locked out of it just to potentially save $200, which I might have to spend later anyway to buy the Oculus controllers, which still limits me to a sit-down experience for the same total price."
Vive,39o738,froop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Sure if you have the cash, but most dont. Spending $300 is more than enough let alone an extra $200 (66% more) on something you may never use. All the things you mentioned were not even close to the same. Hitch option? Not much extra. Extra bedroom, something you will use regardless if you ever have kids, steam game only $1, xbox will get Halo so you are buying it for the eventual halo. 66% increase in price for something you dont want and may never use is not something most will do."

By and large this means that the purchasers are all middle and upper class and likely do have space in their homes.  Just saying.  Allot of people posting about these things are not really gong to buy it and they think every body is going to get it like it's a video game console and it is simply not true.  The Oculus rift at 350 is am expensive peripheral for an already expensive PC with a high end video card that less than 3 percent of PC gamers own. Not to mention early adopters buy more software than most.   Plus additional peripherals this is easily $2,500.  I am sure there will be many people who can't afford it that will buy it anyway but most people buying it will come from high income backgrounds which means most will have larger living accommodations and bigger homes and certainly adequate.   Maybe in a couple of years when it is main stream the space issue might play a factor but for most early adopters it's not an issue."

It's entirely possible that they surprise us with a headset that has ergonomics that match the Rift's, but I personally wouldn't hold my breathe for the first consumer version.  Considering Valve gave their research to HTC, it's a bit misleading to say that the headset we saw from HTC was the first official design.  Valve has gone through many headset iterations before we got to see their first development kit."

Vive,39o738,Mrdicat,6,Sun Jun 14 23:59:28 2015 UTC,"Everybody here seems to be making the same emotional decision regarding Rift vs. Vive. It seems to boil down to everybody being unable to see Oculus for Facebook, and being unable to see HTC for Valve. (I'm aware that Facebook owns Oculus, while HTC is merely partnered with Valve, but hear me out)  The Vive is no more a Valve product than Gear VR is a Facebook product. The Vive is a HTC product that uses technology developed by Valve. If you want to talk numbers, HTC's yearly revenue in 2013 was $6.75 billion, Facebook's was $7.87 billion, so these are both mammoth companies focused on one thing - profits.  While Facebook has pledged to sell the Rift at cost to increase the number of VR users (and of course, to build market share), we've seen no such guarantee from HTC, who's difficult financial situation probably precludes them from being able to sell the Vive at cost.  Not to mention that Oculus has explicitly stated that Oculus Home will not be required to run software on the Rift. This almost certainly means that the Rift will be able to be used with Steam VR. Both HMDs will have exclusives, if for no other reason than they have differing capabilities, and that's something gamers will have to accept until HMDs become commoditized.  So what exactly is it about Facebook/Oculus that makes them a monopolistic empire, and HTC that makes them a company we have grown to trust?  I, for one, will be deciding which HMD to support based on the hardware and software of each, and not by the business practices of the company's involved. If Facebook does decide to be assholes about exclusivity and software price on the Rift, I'll be jumping ship like a rat out of an aqueduct. But I'm not going to make that call until they actually do anything bad. Making that decision now is dangerously presumptuous.  P.S. ""Facebook/Microsoft/Oculus""? Really?"
Vive,39o738,mptp,2,Sun Jun 14 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"I just trust Valve(A company that has been all about gaming since ever) more than Facebook... Plus, since exclusives are apparently really going to be a thing, I'd prefer go with Steam/Valve(Even though I don't think they would do that)"
Vive,39o738,Penderyn,3,Sun Jun 14 23:55:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, I trust Valve more than Facebook too. I'm just withholding judgement until I see a reason to favour one over the other.  And given that Vive has unique capabilities (Lighthouse Controllers and Room-Scale Tracking) exclusives are guaranteed"
Vive,39o738,th3c4k3is4li3,2,Mon Jun 15 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"So far as I understand it HTC is to Valve what Samsung is to Google Android. VALVE will be partnering with different hardware manufacturers.  This is a choice between Valve and Oculus. I for one do not hate either facebook or Microsoft enough to avoid Oculus on principle. All these companies are for profit and I never forget that even Valves ""gamer friendly"" position is ultimately a marketing principle.  But the hardware is by all accounts better as well. We have six months from now to launch of either of these devices.  Ultimately what decides my purchase are the reviews.  That is good advice for anyone.  But I do feel if VALVE Comes out the Victor that we will be happier for it. No way to know.  Hopefully they will both hang in there for a couple of years so we can see.    On a side note.  Look what Valve just announced with the new refund policy.  I mean that's just crazy pro-consumer.  Do you think FB or Microsoft will ever adopt policies like that?  I would not even count on Valve keeping that rule around for more than twelve months."
Vive,39o738,retucex,2,Sun Jun 14 04:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not okay with you turning up here with well thought out, rational arguments. Its unsettling."
Vive,39o738,muchcharles,4,Sun Jun 14 11:55:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the Rift is going to be a new console platform, because you are still able to play and purchase games on steam and play them on the Rift because the SDK is available for everybody.   Even SteamVR can be used with the Rift. The only problem I'm seeing, are the exclusive titles, but that doesn't make it a closed platform..."
Vive,39o738,retucex,2,Sat Jun 13 11:10:10 2015 UTC,"What I'm still unsure of is how exactly are these exclusive titles are going to work? (Speculation incoming) The only way Oculus can enforce exclusives is by having the customer register their rift on their distribution platform (oculus store or whatever) but nothing is stopping me from using Steam or else. Same thing can be said for the Vive: I can still use whatever software I want, provided there's no hardware registration to use it.  So the issue of exclusivity we see between ps4 and xbOne is much less prominent with VR hardware. It's kind of like if I owned ONE copy of GTA V, I could play it on the ps4 or xbOne, but only titles like Halo or Uncharted would be restricted to their specific console.  IMO, yes it still sucks that we'll have to deal with exclusives, but it's much less of a problem than it is on consoles."
Vive,39o738,muchcharles,2,Sat Jun 13 04:45:09 2015 UTC,Their plan for exclusive titles is to only have exclusive titles only be allowed to support the Oculus SDK.
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,3,Sat Jun 13 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"That works too! Still, I get access to those who support both. And I'm sure we'll see wrappers that are hardware agnostic, to ease the pain on developers who want a broader audience."
Vive,39o738,FreeBooteR69,4,Sat Jun 13 05:02:39 2015 UTC,"Wrappers are outlawed in their SDK license, but I'm sure people will hack it in.  Exclusives may also be tied to their store, which may require a device for account activation."

Vive,39o738,deadlymajesty,-7,Sat Jun 13 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"I do, I have 300 games on steams and all the new consoles. And guess what? Consoles are catching up. Xbox has had multiple times recently, that games were cheaper than they have ever been on Steam. E.g Styx was $7.50 on Xbox 6 months ago. The difference is shrinking fast."
Vive,39o738,ScruffTheJanitor,6,Sat Jun 13 08:35:22 2015 UTC,"And guess what? Consoles are catching up.   Not really, as the biggest issue isn't price, but competition and openness. If Steam doesn't allow a game or does something that people don't like, it's not that big of deal, you still have numerous shops and indie bundles to go to. You can even host the game yourself. It might be more effort, but it's possible and a lot of people are doing it, both the small time indies and big ones like Origin. If Microsoft or Sony on the other side doesn't like a game, there are no alternatives, you won't be able to play the game on a console ever."

Plus consoles can't do what PC do, work, x86, emulation, and anything you can imagine you can do with a x86 computer. It's all about the flexibility and the total expenditure over the life time of the device."

People generally don't mind costs that are not up-front. The extra convenience (or plug & play) comes at a cost. I can understand why mainstream folks enjoy console more than PCs when they don't want to muck around with settings and stuff.  Edit: For every AAA game that's cheaper on console, I can provide 10 examples of AAA games (or more) that are cheaper on PC. It's always a losing game if you play more than a few games on consoles."

You're not a developer and it's obvious by this statement. Gamers love Valve, not developers. But publishing on consoles is a pain in the ass, Steam slightly less so, and they're basically forced to choose that PC store since gamers won't buy games that aren't on Steam.

Basically they both have the same specs (Altough E3 will give a more definitive answer on this) if you can wait for 3-6 months until the Touch is released. I think the first months are going to be less crucial than most people think. A release of max 3 months apart isn't going to break the Rift. Games that come to Vive will get Touch support and vice versa. People that have the Vive and want to play games with a controller can buy one. That is as long as there are no exclusives, but I haven't actually seen them drop the word. This does not mean there won't be though!  A bit besides the OP's remark but I think people shouldn't be that fanboyish as I have been reading recently. The Vive and the Rift are both awesome devices as far as we can tell."

They are basically in a panic and playing catch up. Partnering up with Microsoft is seen as an attempt to hinder the Vive's progress by hampering its potential performance. Specially as they specifically said the Rift with have native windows 10 support.
Vive,39mvw7,Napkkins,6,Fri Jun 12 21:46:31 2015 UTC,"I think native Windows support just means you won't have to download drivers, it'll be ""plug and play"" as they've mentioned. I'd guess drivers will likely be handled by the steam client for the Vive."

As soon as vive was announced I figured they'd do it better with more experience but I've been pretty bummed out by oculus lack of competition.

Vive,39mvw7,sintheticreality,5,Sat Jun 13 09:58:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I think they'll both do really well. With Oculus now supported by Microsoft and Facebook in the PC/online space, they have nowhere to go but up.

I'll also be trying not to buy the exclusive content for either of them (but if it is really good exclusive content I'll undoubtedly fold and buy it anyways)."
Vive,39mvw7,vampatori,3,Sat Jun 13 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's too early to call, we just haven't seen the final versions of what's being offered yet, or the prices.  Price will have a huge impact on general market uptake, look at how the PS3 struggled at release despite being technically superior.  Honestly though, while I think it won't offer the best VR experience, I think Sony Morpheus has a good chance to 'win' round one (depending on when it's released) by selling the most.  Being an add-on for the PS4, which is selling very well, it's got the potential to be the most affordable and accessible solution.  In addition, with Sony's movie / Blu-ray interests, they can really offer a home cinema solution that none of the competition can without significant support from other organisations.  I think for regular consumers, being able to watch films in your own home cinema in perfect 3d for less than the cost of a medium TV is going to be a big selling point.  Then surely Sony are working on some sort of VR movie format that will be delivered by Blu-ray, again an amazing selling point that the others are going to struggle to compete with - Sony can literally make the next big blockbuster to be viewed in VR, who else can do that?  I wouldn't be surprised to see Sony create a set-top-box specifically for watching movies in VR, at a very accessible price.  That could really sell well too.  And what about some sort of portable product?  Could that be the killer feature for Sony's floundering mobile gaming devices?  Sony have really got so much potential right at their fingertips that their competitors don't.  Only time will tell, it's going to be a great 12 months or so!  :)"
Vive,39mvw7,coderedmonkey,4,Sat Jun 13 13:32:38 2015 UTC,Native windows 10 support is crap.  It's marketing speak. Valve will have it running easy.  Games will be easy to port so long as Valve or Oculus are not running around grabbing exclusives. I think Oculus plays a dangerous game by announcing exclusives.  Valve is a first party monster. If they play that game and and announce half life 3 in development for Vive exclusively it would be like a nuke going off in the gaming world.  Personally that is what I would do.

Quite frankly its way too early to call and I see them specialising in very different types of experience. Sure, everything starts with games because that is where the early adopter community is (and im still yet to be convinced Vive will be able to replicate the sim fidelity experience that the Rift currently has sewn up), but social experiences and the future of VR as a medium for not just entertainment but so much more, means you write off facebook and its gabillions at your peril."

Just because they build their own marketplace it (hopefully) does not mean all future rift games will be Oculus Marketplace exclusive.   Oculus is cheaper   Which is an advantage for them, esp. for impulse buyers or people on budget. ""why should I pay 500$ when I can get the same for 300$"" [1]   If Steam can deliver their old content in a way that you can stream xbox games with the oculus (as was recently announced), then its game over for Oculus's marketplace   I bet there will be applications for both headsets that will allow this, so I doubt this would be a major selling point. Sure it's more comfortable if I could just say ""Start game in VR"" rather than using a 3rd party launcher.  Also don't forget: Oculus also has the GearVR for the mobile market. This can be the first contact with VR for many people. Those maybe then buy a Gear-compatible smartphone + GearVR, buy games. They decide they want this experience on their PC as well, already have a decent library on oculus marketplace, so they buy a rift instead of vive.  Furthermore the setup for the rift is easier. Place camera where it fits and you're done. For the vive you have to put the lighthouse basestations somewhere up high, power them and run a cable between them.

Vive,39mvw7,DrakenZA,0,Wed Jun 17 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"HTC doesn't seem to be in such a great place financially at the moment, while Oculus seems to have plenty of money to burn and they have already said numerous times that they intend to sell the thing for as cheap as possible. So the Vive might end up quite a bit more expensive then the Rift.  Also while motion controllers are really nice to have, there just aren't that many games that support them at the moment and that won't suddenly change in six month. So all the things that Vive does better then the Rift might not really matter much until a year or two down the line and by that time Rift will have Touch.  As for the market place, Steam certainly has a head start, but how much that matters depends largely on how much overlap there is between regular old games and new VR titles. There doesn't seem to be that much overlap at the moment, so switching shop might not be that hard.  So I wouldn't call it a certain win yet. Vive has the more interesting hardware, but who wins this whole battle isn't going to be decided for a while and my personal guess would be none of them will win in the long run. The winner will be whoever manages to make self-contained VR cheap and easy."

But developers know when making games for the vive, that people will have those controlers. When a developer is making a game for the rift, when the ""touch"" are out, they still have to support the xbox controler, becuas they cant know everyone has those controlers, in the end it will lead to less games using the touch proberly."

Vive,39kwwp,sintheticreality,7,Fri Jun 12 17:51:36 2015 UTC,OCULUS announced exclusives. This is worrying.  I am not buying into another console war. Ports between Oculus and VIVE should be cheap and easy. No economic advantage to withhold titles from either unless the platform holder is paying for them.  If they are going to play that game I am going with Valve. They are much closer to developers and their first party titles alone I would not risk giving up. PORTAL VR is almost definitely coming and I expect it to be announced at E3. Half Life  3 if it ever comes out is likely a VR experience.

But, I watched the stream last night and I've got to say that the Rift has some compelling tech, so I just don't know anymore. But we haven't heard much news about the Vive for a while now so most probably, and hopefully we will get much more interesting news in the coming months. One plus is that the Vive will be hitting the market before the Rift. So please Crownlol, elaborate on what made you a Vive man after watching the Rift CV reveal!"
Vive,39kwwp,CosmosFood,10,Fri Jun 12 13:41:37 2015 UTC,"As a developer, my issue is that I now have to account for a controller as well as the touch if I go with Oculus. Just 2 controller types doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's also not at all like other controllers and will have a steep learning curve and a likely high time cost of implementation. I don't know if I can justify putting the time in to develop for it if I can't be guaranteed that everyone will be using it.  On a personal level, there's also the issue of room tracking. Until reviews come out to tell me for sure, it looks like the oculus has a limited range compared to the vive. I want people to interact more fully with my experiences, so limiting them to a cone from their desk limits my potential.   Don't get me wrong, the touch looks awesome and it definitely speaks to them as a company that their willing to delay for a perfect, polished product. Unfortunately, I need to make a decision and a guaranteed configuration just makes things world's easier."
Vive,39kwwp,aiusepsi,5,Fri Jun 12 14:54:34 2015 UTC,"As a developer you're probably better off using OpenVR anyway, a central standard that anyone can use, right?"

Vive,39kwwp,CosmosFood,2,Fri Jun 12 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"Valve should really consider contributing OpenVR to Khronos or another standards body. I can see why they'd want to keep in-house for a bit while they iterate on details, but it'd be great if they'd commit to standardisation in the medium to long term."
Vive,39kwwp,JashanChittesh,2,Sun Jun 14 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thinking. The only thing about SteamVR that sucks is that it's hard to get the DevKits. Everything else just plainly rocks!  I would have much preferred if they sold them - at an adequate price, and also only to select developers. But I need to pay rent for a full room already (actually I even have two rooms set aside), so paying $500, or $1000 or even $1500 (for two DevKits) really wouldn't have hurt (that's what these rooms cost me in one or two months ... and ATM, these rooms are empty, waiting to be filled with that DevKit or those DevKits)."

Vive,39kwwp,muchcharles,6,Wed Jun 17 01:55:54 2015 UTC,Probably that they are going to ship with an xbox gamepad instead of the Oculus Touch controllers and will likely be releasing them months later.  A lot of people are worried this will fragment the input ecosystem and devs might not target Touch as much as if it were bundled.
Vive,39kwwp,CosmosFood,2,Fri Jun 12 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"As a dev, having multiple control schemes to build for is tedious. Some people argue that the touch controllers have the same inputs of buttons and sticks, but then what's the point of even using the touch controllers? I'm passionate about VR and I want people experiencing 'presence' in my games and therefore want to develop for the touch but it's a hard sell when I can't say definitively that everyone will have it.  At the end of the day I still have to pay bills so I'll spend my time/energy on what I know people will have, which is the xbox controller if you're a Rift customer and wands if your Vive. It sorta sucks."
Vive,39kwwp,30dogsinasuitcase,2,Fri Jun 12 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"But at least if the Touch controllers support everything the controller supports (almost, no d-pad), Oculus could eventually stop shipping the controller and still maintain full backwards compatibility with their catalog with no extra work from any devs.   It isn't ideal, but without it things could stay in a fragmented state much longer, maybe even through multiple generations of headsets."
Vive,39kwwp,muchcharles,2,Fri Jun 12 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely correct. Having a similar button layout was a good move for eventually moving off the xb1 controllers.   As a dev and enthusiast, my frustrations are just that, frustrations. I personally don't want to make games for a regular controller because that doesn't feel like a step forward for VR. Knowing there's a capable, tracked handset out there only exacerbates the issue in my eyes."
Vive,39kwwp,SoTotallyToby,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"a lot of people are worried   You probably mean a lot of people in /r/oculus are worried. The general paranoia over there is so tedious.   I'm just not buying that a few extra months waiting for a highly anticipated input system made for a highly anticipated platform will ""fragment the ecosystem"". By the same logic you might say it is already fragmented because we have been developing primarily for gamepads since DK1. Most if not all of the games showcased by Oculus yesterday were designed for gamepads because the Touch is brand new. If Touch is good, it will pervade naturally. No need to worry."
Vive,39kwwp,ZarianPrime,2,Fri Jun 12 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"I basically agree, especially since it isn't hard to make anything designed for gamepad work with Oculus Touch since it has sticks and the same number of buttons.  Eventually I think they will drop the Xbox controller and ship a bundle with Touch, and that should end fragmentation.  If the touch controllers werent a superset of the xbox controllers it would be a bigger concern (though they arent strictly a superset--no dpad), but as is there is an easy transition path.  It is nothing like the fragmentation concerns people had over the kinect situation.  If they are tied to to the bundled controller long term under subsidizing contract with MS or in reciprocation for official windows 10 support, then it is a bit of a concern again."

So I'll be saving up for this first.   2) I want to see want the eventual reviews are for both final consumer models for the Oculus and the Vive.

The walk-around aspect of Vive is something I know I will not use outside of novelty but the rest of the Viva package seems to be going in the right direction.  I'm adapting a wait and see attitude at this point.  I'm okay with missing out on the first few months of Vive and seeing which platform will be supported better.

Vive,39kwwp,Blackstream,6,Fri Jun 12 15:21:41 2015 UTC,Turning my body or standing up is more movement than I'm interested in. I like games as a seated experience.  I've probably only got a 6ft x 6ft area I could even move around in anyway.
Vive,39kwwp,30dogsinasuitcase,3,Fri Jun 12 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"Let me turn that question back to you and ask what is the appeal?  Like sell it to me, what games or experiences do you have in mind that would take good advantage of this?     While I know AAA gaming will hop on board with the seated VR experience, I'm not convinced the ""standing and moving"" VR experience will catch on much.  The best type of games I can think that a 15x15 constraint would be perfect is a revision of Myst-like game or something like Legend of Grimrock.  I'm not saying there isn't applicability, just that I can't see it becoming the ""next big thing."" I would love to be wrong."
Vive,39kwwp,O-Face,2,Fri Jun 12 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"The only kind of standing experiences I'd be down for are passive or not all that active... 3d movie watching, transport yourself to another scene/world type experiences, social vr.  I'm not about to buy myself one of those funky treadmills (not that I have the space for it anyways), that kind of tech feels too gimmicky for me, I'd rather wait for that kind of technology to evolve/mature. And without stuff like that (and wireless controllers), there's not much pull for me in active vr games."
Vive,39kwwp,30dogsinasuitcase,2,Fri Jun 12 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure I can say anything to sell it until you try it yourself (if you haven't). I'm not saying it will overshadow the seated experience at all. But I'm really excited for new genre of gaming at the very least.

Let me ask you this, did any of those strike you as something you could play for hours like you might with any other AAA game? Or even one that could be built upon to be that?  That's essentially what I am trying to figure out. If there isn't, if they're just cool demos or short games/experiences that you have a lot of fun with and then put down after a half hour, then I just see it taking off/being sustainable."
Vive,39kwwp,30dogsinasuitcase,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:07:07 2015 UTC,Well our jam games in particular were designed for a 3 minute experience in order to get a couple hundred guests through them in one night on only three room-scale setups. Of course you're right that I'm not going to be gaming in full body interaction the same way I gamed in my heyday of Civ V for example (one more turrrrn). But I can imagine being pulled in for an hour if the content is there. The nature of the interaction and its design for minimum fatigue will certainly be a factor.

It may mean the Rift is the VR experience for me and I understand that going in.  I received one of the first wave of DKs from Oculus and had a lot of fun playing games seated with a controller.

Requiring that I pay for another X1 controller (I already have 2) that I don't need.  Also, the marketing focus on Win 10 to get the ""best"" VR experience I didn't like. There are way too many agendas from too many companies at work here.  Because of this choices are made like the X1 controller that are better for the companies than for the users or the technology.

Unless Oculus suddenly moves over to ""room-scale VR"", which is highly unlikely, the prototypes tell me enough to know that I prefer the experience SteamVR offers significantly over the experience that Oculus offers.  Those are really different approaches - and the exact specs of one or the other are much less important than the actual approach they follow.  Just ""delivered with an Xbox One controller"" alone speaks volumes. And IMHO, they could deliver SteamVR / HTC Vive as it is already - the consumer version will only get better."

You'd probably lose tracking if you turned away too far, but it would still be better than Oculus' current DK2 solution (which has a pretty narrow FOV)."
Vive,39mnls,mrmonkeybat,2,Fri Jun 12 21:42:41 2015 UTC,You can place a single lighthouse or both on top of you monitor and use it only in your chair if you want to.
Vive,39mnls,ineeddrugas,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:23:31 2015 UTC,i think the lighthouses have to be facing each other(in its view range) for a timing pulse to be read and that pulse has a limit of 15f everything else has a greater limit not sure how much hasn't been tested yet
Vive,39mnls,coloredgreyscale,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:18:22 2015 UTC,The timing pulse is done via cable (at least for the dev version) http://vrfocus.com/archives/16250/htc-vive-development-kit-instruction-manual-revealed/ Step 14  iirc it should work with 1 lighthouse as well. But they need two to prevent occlusion of the controllers or headset when you turn around.  However I hope it will be useable without a lighthouse unit in a basic mode (head rotation only). Should be enough for a virtual cinema when traveling
Vive,39mnls,H43D1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:52:19 2015 UTC,You can also be seated. So room does not matter anymore.
Vive,39m09y,Vaenomx,3,Fri Jun 12 17:56:38 2015 UTC,This is a good question. I noticed that even with two lighthouses there was a couple dead zones and tracking was lost for a moment. It would be nice to know if the system is modular and if I will be able to buy a 3rd or 4th lighthouse if need be.

Also having only motion controls like the Vive can be a problem in the sense that a lot of developers can't target just a single console/HMD.  That being said, valve could easily give players the options to use regular controllers as well but it has to be purchased separately.  I still haven't decided on which HMD I will purchase, and im not taking sides before I get to experience the myself."

Vive,394yd1,grut_nartaq,9,Tue Jun 9 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"Different SDK's, which means different code to interface with the specific headset (although OpenVR is trying to solve this problem, correct me if I've understood this incorrectly). Different input schemes. Hopefully this will be known June 11th :D"
Vive,394yd1,hyperion337,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:15:36 2015 UTC,I thought SDKs related to platform (OS?) differences. Like android vs apple vs windows? Is there a platform in the headset that windows needs to talk to?   Maybe i should have labeled this ELI5
Vive,394yd1,tfezz,4,Tue Jun 9 09:52:57 2015 UTC,"There are two open SDKs at the moment; OpenVR and OSVR. OpenVR is driven by Valve and OSVR is driven by a consortium of hardware companies. As /u/DarkMoS pointed out the SDK are more for accessing the extra bits on a HMD like the tracking hardware. Both these SDK strive to level the playing field for software developers so they can gain access to all the various hardware parts that are coming. OpenVR operates with OSVR plugins so either SDK lets you ""talk"" to a large hardware base. I think OpenVR also lets a game developer do Steam-specific things. Either SDK is a great choice for VR game development but if you want to integrate tightly with SteamVR then your only choice is OpenVR."
Vive,394yd1,DarkMoS,2,Tue Jun 9 14:23:36 2015 UTC,"You also have SDKs targetting a specific hardware platform, in order to squeeze out every bit of the various components that are part of it.   For example YAW tracking function will be implemented differently in the following situations:   headset comes with a standard accelerometer which need constant drift correction headset comes with a standard accelerometer and an additional magnetometer that should void the drift  headset exclusively relies on camera+IR leds"

Vive,394yd1,JashanChittesh,4,Tue Jun 9 13:20:05 2015 UTC,HMDs are more than just fancy monitors because they are also input devices. The position tracking systems and some rendering ticks vary (at least between Oculus and Vive for example).
Vive,394yd1,saluk,3,Tue Jun 9 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"VR headsets are very far from being a ""really fancy monitor"". There's completely different approaches: Gear VR / Zeiss One and all other mobile based headsets don't even have positional tracking (like the DK1). DK2 does have positional tracking but it has a comparatively small area where you can move and only works reliably when you're not turned the other way. SteamVR/Vive on the other hand, has near-perfect room-scale tracking and perfectly tracked controllers.  So there's actually complete games mechanics that will be totally awesome for SteamVR/Vive (or any ""room-scale VR setup"") that won't really work well with hardware that is oriented towards standing or seated experiences. On the other hand, if you have room-scale VR hardware (like SteamVR / Vive), you can of course easily play games that were designed only for seated/standing hardware.  Concerning APIs: I believe currently, the most versatile approach is using SteamVR because this does support Oculus but also supports SteamVR/Vive. So from the purely technical perspective, you develop once and can run at least these both.  With Unity 5.1, you have native Oculus integration, native HoloLens integration is announced (that's AR, so it's a different story but it is related) ... Project Morpheus is already supported for Unity (but as far as I know not with the native integration that came with 5.1). Hopefully, eventually you'll be able to have a unified API/approach in Unity that allows you to build for all relevant different hardware approaches. And probably UE4 will be doing the same (they already have native SteamVR integration AFAIK)."

I would understand if you're trying do it on a tight budget, or trying to get the best bang by buying GTX 970 and an i5. The CPU shouldn't be too much cheaper than the GPU, a rule of thumb. i5 is starting to show its age for certain AAA games. (Yes for most games there's no difference or just a couple of fps.) While DX12 will probably delay the inevitable a little bit, but why try to save $100 or so when you're spending over $2000.

Vive,385cit,MrSanterClaws,7,Mon Jun 1 23:37:36 2015 UTC,No you are not being naive and its actually one of the difficult problems in VR is how to tackle movement.  There is various techniques that work to various degrees but I've not seen a public solution that works great with wands in VR.  Example of something that works alright with wands is grabbing the world and turning by dragging it and then something else for forward/back.  But once you allow the user to walk around plus move via controls you need to tackle how to make the user know where home is in the real world all while feeling seamless.
Vive,385cit,Cryect,4,Mon Jun 1 23:46:28 2015 UTC,"They are keeping their cards very close to their chests at the moment which is understandable. It's just funny how, as far as i have seen, this is going to be one of the first VR headsets released yet still one of, if not the most powerful.  the reason I'm most excited about this over for example the Rift is the fact that i trust Steam to keep to its original vision and goal compared to a product owned by Facebook.  Plus when i heard the words ""Aperture Laboratories"" used during a tech demo i almost cried. The future is looking pretty exciting!"

Doom you couldn't even look up and down, it was definitely an addition to later engines.  But there a ton of games based on some of those pre-quake engines though it apparently it took less time between Wolf3d and System Shock 2 than I remember.  They were a large part of my childhood.  I remember I didn't accept WASD until Alien vs Predator (I skipped quake since it didn't run on my hardware when it was popular)"
Vive,385cit,30dogsinasuitcase,4,Tue Jun 2 08:52:42 2015 UTC,"The traditional FPS game is not going to translate to the 15'x15' room scale VR experience (nor to a seating experience IMO). The first task of developers is to design spaces that do not invite a player to wander beyond the calibrated space. The Vive gives a visual warning when you approach the edge, but the best experiences will not allow a player to worry about such a thing.   We know that instant cuts and teleportation are perfectly comfortable in VR. So, stepping from scene to discrete scene like in Myst or even blinking around like Nightcrawler will probably form the core of some early Vive games."
Vive,385cit,saluk,3,Tue Jun 2 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"In a certain sense, walking across vast landscapes for hours makes up the exploration component of games - but removing it doesn't do that much to the gameplay cycle. Walk around until you get to an encounter zone, deal with the encounter, and then walk around to the next encounter zone. Until a good locomotion option is available, the walking from one place to another stretches of gameplay will need to be replaced with something else. Since you lose some of the exploration component of travel, it would be good to use some kind of exploration in what you replace it with.   You could always put a golf cart in the center of the room for you to hop in when you want to drive around :)"

Vive,385cit,crazyminner,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, maybe they would just allow it at certain points of games or have environment designed with that specifically in mind giving you a warning beforehand.

Mechanical drives just... so slow, I can't take it... for storage they are still fine though, and low bandwidth tasks like streaming media.   Then again, if you can load an entire experience into memory, any storage is fine, you'll just have to wait for longer before it starts. Though, if it's a large world game which streams levels from storage, well, it would be hard not to recommend an SSD to reduce the risk for hickups :p or like, pop-ins."

I've never gotten the appeal, it boots in under 2-3 seconds to a working desktop (bar me typing a password).  Honestly interested in your thoughts."
Vive,38321e,TheFlyingBastard,6,Mon Jun 1 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"It's great if you have large programs running. I install my games on my SSD, for example.

Vive,38321e,TheFlyingBastard,3,Mon Jun 1 18:29:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't got a mechanical keyboard, but I guess so. I couldn't go back. The differences individually may be small, but over time they add up. Especially in games such as Skyrim."

I see where I could benefit from this (heavily modded minecraft being one of them), but since it isn't a priority (I had to buy my mechanical keyboard because my fingers began to hurt), I'll be on the lookout for a discounted SSD to stash my most played games on, but not my OS, since it's so tiny.  Have a nice day!"
Vive,38321e,locallyunscene,2,Mon Jun 1 18:41:21 2015 UTC,It's not a huge deal of course but it adds up in games where you load maps frequently.
Vive,38321e,eco_was_taken,5,Mon Jun 1 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"Moore's Law has made our current processors incredibly fast but magnetic hard disk speeds have been basically stagnant for a decade. Our computers are largely bottlenecked by disk IO these days. It's grown to such a problem that asynchronous I/O has become a huge deal for performant software. You have this incredibly fast processor just sitting around waiting for the data it needs to process so we made new APIs that let the processor do other stuff while it waits. An SSD is just about an order of magnitude faster than a magnetic drive. It's the single best purchase you can make if you want a faster computer.  I don't find boot speed interesting personally (who reboots enough to care about this?) but if you look at real world benchmarks of things like gaming, application startup times, file transfers, etc. you see a massive speed up using an SSD over a regular magnetic hard disk. It's just an all around speed up that is well worth the cost.  The best return on your dollar for a computer upgrade is an SDD then extra RAM and finally a faster CPU. RAM over CPU because excess RAM is used by any modern OS for disk caching which is another way of targeting the I/O bottleneck."
Vive,38321e,lifeislie,0,Mon Jun 1 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"You really typed out a well thought answer, don't get me wrong, it makes sense, but in my use case, since I optimized everything to be light, bottlenecks don't matter that much. The heaviest application I use on a daily basis is firefox, which takes a second or 2 to startup. For file transfers, I end up not copying things around that much and my network speed is slow enough for it not to matter.  The only exception is gaming, which I entirely agree in my use case, it'd make a huge difference in how fast things load. But I'd rather invest in RAM to be able to load larger maps and more mods and have to wait a bit more. But as I said in another reply, I've been convinced and will get an SSD if I can find one at a discounted price."

Vive,37j0cp,bbrex,1 point,Wed May 27 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"It's true that stereoscopy actually brings less to the experience than a lot of people think - many depth cues are received from things other than stereoscopy (you can check this by playing a 3D game with one eye closed: it'll look like you're playing it on a 3D screen. This is because you're removing the stereo-information that tells you you're looking at a flat screen, and the depth cues you receive from the game rendering remain consistent)  Fundamentally, the two things that make VR graphically demanding are the wide FOV, requiring more things to be on screen at once, and the stereo rendering, requiring (right now) everything to be rendered twice. Pretty soon the second won't be an issue with optimisations coming down from hardware manufacturers.  I think there's something to the idea that it might be worth sacrificing stereo rendering in exchange for a wider FOV. However, wider FOV requires hardcore optics research and development. Stereo is already close to perfect (just needs eye-tracking for precise placement of the virtual cameras)  So fundamentally I think you have a good point, but on the practical level I think that it's not worth the extra time and expense for a manufacturer to go after a 180­°+ FOV. But hey, I'd welcome a competitor to the current manufacturers offering a massive FOV in exchange for stereo vision (or even in addition to for high-end PCs?)!  P.S. I think you mean Wearality - Cmoar aren't offering a wider FOV than anyone else: they're offering the external bluetooth controller and the external motion sensor. ;)"

Or any other HMD for that matter.   But there have been an explosion of post lately only asking what pc they should buy, what is enough, will this do..etc etc. And I think people more react to the fact that noone search or do some reasearch themselves. And since its still quite far out in time, noone really knows yet for a fact how, when or what to get. We all make educated quesses.   Anyway, in your case its great to wait a few weeks for Fiji XT and see what it does. In any case the new cards will put price pressure on older ones wich will benefit you.   If you want to play now, you can also get something cheap or second hand GPU to tide you over to 2016, and then get the best your wallet can handle when its prime time for consumer VR."

I can't say for sure, but I see the potential.  I tried a rollercoaster demo and I am terrified of coasters. I didn't exactly feel like I was on one, but I was swaying with each turn. What took me out of it was definitely the low resolution and frame rate.   If Valve and HTC deliver on the specs they are claiming, it should be amazing and very immersive. Hope that helps you."
Vive,371vx3,RIFT-VR,2,Sun May 24 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"If the HMD is calibrated to your IPD, tightly-strapped in, and running on a non-potato PC, then 75fps is more than adequate, Maybe you got some judder? Roller coaster demos blew me away on the DK1, which was severely stunted compared to the DK2. Or maybe hearing about VR for so long without trying one until now can overblow people's expectations."
Vive,371vx3,Kronik_NinjaLo,1 point,Wed May 27 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"There were most definitely many factors in my ""not so optimal"" experience and I'm not taking that experience as my final opinion of it at all. I did greatly enjoy it and also know that better HMD specs+better PC specs+properly fit will make it amazing.   The DK2 was at a college Mac store, so it was running off of an iMac(not sure how old, but looked like it had some wear to it) and I didn't look at the GPU inside, but I'm guessing it wasn't the greatest. That can account for the low FPS and possibly the low res. Since it was an 'open to the public' store, they didn't have lenses put out and I also didn't bother to properly fit it to my head.  I'm still excited though. These things should definitely be fixed somehow, if its by the user or by upgrades the company does. Honestly, I didn't quite want to have it fully set up for my head and eyes because when Vive comes out, I want to get the full experience of VR when I earn it. I at least wanted to just check it out.  Question on your comment though. What is the IPD, how do you calibrate it, and how is it different for each person?"
Vive,371vx3,RIFT-VR,2,Wed May 27 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Ah! It'd good you're aware of that. Many naysayers will bring up issues that could have been solved if the demo were done correctly, but sometimes it's just not possible if a bunch of people are being shown rapidly. There's about a million things that all need to ""click"" at once for perfect visuals and immersion, and it can all go wrong if a few big ones aren't there.  One of those things is the IPD you're asking about. IPD = interpupillary distance. That is, the distance between the center (?) of one pupil to the other. This varies greatly with the size of the head and distribution of the face. It greatly affects how we perceive scale.  On the DK1 and 2, this is handled only on the software side. Ideally in the future, the distance between lenses can be set physically. This contributes to the ""sweet spot"" in the lenses, in the center.  But for now, there is an Oculuc Config Tool, where you can create per-person profiles, that include information like their gender, height (for games that want to take advantage), and IPD. There is a tool built-in that helps us measure our IPDs at the moment, but it's not super-precise.  Long story short, you'll lose a lot of immersion if this is set incorrectly because the game would could seem way too big or way too small, depending on what the profile was set to when you demoed it.  Then, ideally you'd have used 1 of 3 lenses that best suited you. The A-cup allows your face to be much closer to the screen and experience a slightly-better FOV, if you don't have glasses. Then the lenses can be dialed forward or backwards from the screen to help further.  And then there's things like making sure the strap was incredibly tight, so that micro-movements don't shake the screen separately from your head to create a ""drift"" in the image. Then there's how much light was leaking into the Rift from the mesh holes at the bottom....or if you were using over-ear headphones that drowned out the sound around you.  I could keep going but I think you get what I mean. That's not even considering the software side of things, of the efforts that must be made for the full effect, but all of the coaster demos I tried have been more or less fine.   I didn't quite want to have it fully set up for my head and eyes because when Vive comes out, I want to get the full experience of VR when I earn it   That's awesome. I wish I had done that, but I guess I'm glad I got to tinker with the dev kits and experience the rebirth of an exciting technology. Of all I've read about the Vive, and I have almost ruined the VR illusion from developing with the kit and knowing how most of it works, I still think it's going to blow me away. It's truly exciting to hear about the resolution and motion controls. Having played a little bit with motion controls in VR in the past (Hydra), I can't say enough about how it adds to immersion, being able to interact with the environment in subtle movements that go beyond just looking around."
Vive,371vx3,Kronik_NinjaLo,2,Wed May 27 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"You had a few things in your explanation that I was unaware of, thanks for that!  I didn't have headphones at all, so no sound and I could also clearly see my hands around my nose."
Vive,371vx3,fish1479,2,Wed May 27 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"It didn't for me. I do okay with heights, but I am deathly afraid of edges. Near the end of the Portal demo, the floor starts to fall away and I was left standing at the edge of an incredibly high platform. At first there was a slight sensation of vertigo and I felt a little uneasy but the feeling went away very quickly.  Maybe if I had been plugged in longer and been more immersed in the world, the feelings would have been stronger. As it stands right now, I was never so detached from reality that I actually felt scared for more than a moment."
Vive,371vx3,BlinksTale,1 point,Wed May 27 16:09:49 2015 UTC,Hopefully the tech and software will get better. I do wonder if a persons susceptibility to hypnosis will have an affect on immersion. There is going to be a whole generation of psych majors tested on these things.

Vive,36hy2x,muchcharles,2,Wed May 20 02:14:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're asking.  Will the Vive be shipped with lighthouse/controllers and is there a base unit only available? - We don't know.  Will Lighthouse support other controllers than the prototypes we've seen? - Yes, although I haven't seen other designs yet.   Valve even has a software solution in the works for creating custom controllers and device too. CAD models of an object that are outputted to STL files can be looked at, and the user can be told where the optimal places to add sensors are. That makes it much easier to start prototyping units, with a testing phase following shortly after.   Will the Vive support other tracking systems than Lighthouse? - Probably, based on this tweet from the lead of Lighthouse:    Alan Yates @vk2zay The future of tracking systems for VR is not a single tracker, but combinations of the right tech for each part of the job."

Vive,36hy2x,UltraChip,3,Tue May 19 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"The answer is: Depends on the game. If the developers make the game use the controllers and don't add keyboard support, you won't have keyboard support. If the developers of a game decide to add keyboard support, you'll have keyboard support. This isn't up to Valve/HTC."
Vive,36hy2x,Henry132,1 point,Tue May 19 20:20:51 2015 UTC,Well also if it comes with the controllers that means you have to pay for the controllers.
Vive,36hy2x,Arcland,1 point,Tue May 19 19:00:43 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they have an option without the controllers.  I'm spending 2k on a brand new desktop JUST because I'm having so much fun with the DK2. I don't really want to spend $700 on the Vive because it has controllers. I'm hope it's >$500 (without the controllers)because it's the first consumer ready VR. I am spending too much already lol

That is if you run that driver update before you start playing the newer games. Works wonders for the witcher 3 for example.  Also I would love to see games using more VRAM, but I don't think this will be the case. Especially if the resolutions are kept the same as for the oculus and almost all of the cards currently have near 4, which means developers will develop for that. They will actually probably develop for 3.5, because of the 970.  Personally I will probably get something cheaper, a single 980 probably, and wait for something actually good from the video card developers as for the first time in like 5-6 years they actually have an incentive to make/release more powerful cards vs more efficient cards. Nvidia promises some new arhitecture releases in 2016 and I  would be afraid to buy a 1000$ card that might not even be that good in 2 years."

For this reason, I think the rift will have much higher market penetration."

I would even go so far as to suggest that the removal of the code to generate a distortion mesh on the client is specifically to make it harder for SteamVR/OpenVR or any other platform to support the Rift. Right now you can continue using SDK version 0.5 to support the DK2 on those platforms, but there's no guarantee that Oculus will support the 0.5 API once CV1 is released. No 0.5 -> no distortion mesh -> no OpenVR support. It's a colossal dick move, but I suspect that someone at OVR thinks it's a good strategic move.   source"
Vive,367dlu,MadExecutioner,10,Sun May 17 17:36:01 2015 UTC,"Depends if valve can get rid off the idea that you need an entire room for the vive to work.

On the other hand, Oculus has stated they're going for a seated experience (at least for now) and they're willing to sell at cost, which is going to entice many more users.  They'll probably both end up with similar amounts of end-users, but I think Oculus has the advantage in the beginning. Once VR is big, I think if HTC/Valve/etc. keep up with the more demanding, ""high-end"" hardware, they may come up ahead, but we don't know what anyone has planned past their respective CV1s."

Here in the UK an 'average' living room might only have 4-6 feet of free space between the TV and sofa, and I think the Kinect wanted 10 or something? We bought one and had to completely rearrange our living room, tipping sofas up against the wall on end, to have the space to use it every time we wanted to.  Same goes for the Vive. IIRC it needs a 4'x6' space, minimum. I just about have that in my living room, in front of my TV, but I sure as hell don't in my office where the PC is, or in any other room like any of the bedrooms. The living room is the only room with that amount of space, and my house and space is quite large compared to most of my friends. My wife tends to watch TV/Netflix or play on the XBox while I'm gaming on the PC, so if I'm blocking the TV while gaming I don't see that going down well. If I can't use the extra features of the Vive because I don't have the space for a non-seated experience, I might as well get the Rift."

No way I have room for one of those cluttering up my office all the time, quite apart from the cost.

As such, the Omni works with any game or application that uses gamepad input without the need for integration with our SDK. That said, for advanced functionality the Omni comes with and SDK that provides game developers with full motion control: analogue walking speed, analogue walking direction, and tracking data of each individual foot that enables full freedom of motion with de-coupled walking and viewing directions.   http://www.virtuix.com/frequently-asked-questions/  And yeah, it's expensive, but I am planning to use it to help me stay in shape."

Vive,369m9r,30dogsinasuitcase,0,Sun May 17 17:10:16 2015 UTC,What I don't I understand is how it will change dynamically with games.  For example you have a level with a ship.  What if with a 15x7 the ship deck is skewed?
Vive,369m9r,muchcharles,3,Sun May 17 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"When you are near the edge of the calibrated space, the vive renders red lines to indicate the boundary. Your ship deck wouldn't be skewed, only less accessible. It's up to the devs to handle varied tracking space, or to explicitly require a minimum size for a given experience."

Valve has two vr APIs, one depends on steam for integration, the other from what I understand is completely HMD and platform agnostic.

There will be a seated mode for lazy casuals, but we want to focus on our standing mode where the player physically walks around the room to look at the block tower from any angle, as if it were actually floating in space.

That being said, it's possible that the timing is more robust for tracking with the Vive than with the Rift's solution of rapidly blinking the IR LEDs on the headset for identification, so perhaps some signal loss / timing errors caused by extending cables won't impact performance too much.  I would like to find this out, however, since I'm probably going to wind up picking a few extra lighthouse units up to create as big a tracking area as I can get away with."

I work with this laser sensor which gives distance measurements in a plane at a high refresh rate and sample resolution but it is too expensive to put in consumer tech.

We probably want developers figuring out what makes sense and what doesn't for their specific application instead of using the valve template or whatever.   Also, the convenient thing about all of this new amazing VR stuff is that the software is already abstracted out enough that you just plug it in to your system and it works.

Vive,32qswo,RowdyGuyVR,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, for software houses sure, because porting to another platform when you have the resources is easy for the profit.  But oculus isn't really in the same boat.  Think of them more like Nintendo - they have their own hardware spec to target for, at least for games and such.  Their api absolutely will support multiple HMDs, and likely any social platform they make will, but many/most of their games will lean hard on their own hardware capabilities and be Rift exclusive for a long time to come, if not forever."

Vive,32qswo,RowdyGuyVR,2,Thu Apr 16 20:01:51 2015 UTC,I don't think they were clear on the motion sickness cure since they could have been only talking about the situation where you are standing up and walking around while being tracked by lightbeam. If you sit down then we don't know if there will be a  major difference between Vive and Oculus. Both headsets risk causing motion sickness if the movement in the game does not match what you are seeing in VR (e.g. sitting down at your desk but running around in a game is potentially bad but sitting in a cockpit in a game should be better since your brain is not getting as many conflicting signals)
Vive,32qswo,contactgus,3,Mon Apr 20 10:16:14 2015 UTC,I was wondering this as well. If the virtual reality community gets divided then I think it will go the way of the Virtual Boy again.

I'm pretty sure that Valve engineers by now know the SDK of Oculus by hearth and also realize the potential of 'piggybacking' :) Also, Valve has quite some leverage with their steam store and thus the entire PC-community what makes reaching out to AAA developers a lot easier. Most games developed for Oculus at the moment are from Indies and typically relatively 'simple' or short. Other games are typically ports from standalone Windows versions.  Last but not least, I think opensource will be a main thing for VR as well. Just look at the amazing work the modding community has done for things as Skyrim, GTA IV etc. When this is being applied to VR, very cool things can happen: just look at Half Life VR :)"

I'd bet there will be standards by the time consumer releases hit shelves though so this shouldn't be much of an issues. Really depends on what oculus end up shipping for input."

Vive,31zhss,DancingDirty7,4,Thu Apr 9 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, it should still work if the lighthouses are mounted to the rig so they move with the driver. They don't scan the room, they just emit light sweeps that are picked up by the sensors on the HMD. Each sensor is swept over at a slightly different time and from those time differences, the orientation and position of the HMD (relative to the lighthouse) can be calculated.  I'm not sure if there are requirements on minimum distance between lighthouses and the HMD, though. That could make attaching the devices to the rig awkward."
Vive,31zhss,Nimbal,2,Thu Apr 9 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how it would go trying to attach Lighthouse, but I and others with motion simulators have tried mounting the Rift camera to motion simulators. It will work for gentle flight simulation but not for harsh racing or combat simulation. You can't isolate the camera from the sharp movements and powerful vibrations our motion simulators are capable of, which messes up the tracking."
Vive,31zhss,noorbeast,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:35:13 2015 UTC,"For some reason, I thought OP implied that DK2 works fine with those motion rigs. After rereading it, I'm not sure how I got that impression. Anyway, if the camera tracking suffers from vibrations, I can't imagine Lighthouse faring much better, so there goes that idea.  It seems like the comment of /u/noorbeast is the most relevant then."
Vive,31zhss,Nimbal,2,Thu Apr 9 13:54:00 2015 UTC,"What is needed is called motion cancellation.  According to Palmer Oculus is not interested in a generic SDK exposed solution for motion cancellation stabilisation: http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/2os8tz/oculus_ignoring_game_devs_lfs_motion_platform/cmq9vud  It is possible to add motion cancellation stabilisation with VectionVR, however that has to be implemented on a game by game basis by individual game developers, which is highly unlikely: http://www.vectionvr.com/  The question if Lighthouse will support motion cancellation has been asked of Alan Yates, but no response yet: https://mobile.twitter.com/vk2zay/status/581723586626367488  Motion cancellation itself is simple, just offset the motion rig position in the video view. The difficulty is having SDK support so that can be done generically, rather than game by game, developer by developer, because that will never happen. I certainly hope Valve comes to the part and allows for motion cancellation, as motion simulators and VR are awesome together."
Vive,31zhss,noorbeast,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:28:00 2015 UTC,"I think simply mounting one controller to the moving rig could allow you to track position of the platform/car. I bet it will be impossible to mount lighthouse on the rig as it is a precise spinning mechanical device (slight movement and centrifugal force will mess the readings; hard shaking and parts will fly to the moon).  If you leave lighthouses on the wall, mount one controller on the rig and have tracking in the vive, I believe there is nothing more needed to implement feedback movement."
Vive,31zhss,SaerDeQuincy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:29:56 2015 UTC,All that would be needed then would be a simple way to offset the video.
Vive,31zhss,noorbeast,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:04:07 2015 UTC,I would say it could be solved through adding sensors to the rig that would remove the rigs movement from the headset movement.  I don't know enough about math and the calculations that are going on to be able to say that will work for sure and you would also need someone to make the sensor bar or whatever mounted to the rig but it might work.

You could render your games at 720P or 1080P and then upscale the image via the GPU or HMD's circuitry. Developer's goal will be to find a sweet spot between image quality and the immersing experience. And I don't think that all existing games will be suitable for VR, they have to be designed from the start with VR concepts in mind. Imho, games like driving, flight & space sims will be more easily adapted than the FPS you're mentioning. And I'm impatiently waiting for games/content specifically produced for VR."

GPU needs won't be totally outrageous, and I'm sure most will develop with at least midrange cards in mind.  Also, the dev kit is not 4K capable, and it's higliy unlikely Oculus CV1 will be either. The actual resolution that is displayed in the Vive dev kit is 2160x1200. However there are pixels rendered off screen at a 1.4x mulitiplier, making what is actually rendered equivalent to 3024x1680. This is what we want to render at 90FPS, but it's obviously a non standard resolution. That's why I extrapolated 4K down to see what might be possible."

Vive,305xzc,Saytahri,2,Fri Apr 3 09:21:50 2015 UTC,"See page 4 of the Advanced VR Rendering Presentation.   It is recommended this way because you need to render more pixels to get closer to 1:1 pixel mapping after you perform the lens distortion warp which shrinks the image. Furthermore, the higher mulipiler you use you get less aliasing because of the higher resolution downsampling. As you can see on page 47 ""1.4x is just a recommendation for the HTC Vive (Each HMD design has a different recommended scalar based on optics and panels)."" So you don't have to strictly stick to this, and users can always chose to render lower resolutions, but it's a good target to keep in mind.   Worth noting Oculus DK2 also has this at an even higher recommended multiplier I believe. They recommend downsampling something close to 1440 rendering on the 1080P screens iirc (about a 1.78 multiplier). In practice though many devs limit this to 1.3 or so to make it a bit easier on the GPU."

Vive,305xzc,Lilwolf2000,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what games you're interested in and how important graphics are for you. I won't say it's insufficient, but VR 960 is on the lower end for sure. Games like Star Citizen may be only barely playable (unless Direct X 12 and/or Vulcan are as good as rumored and Star Citizen takes advantage of it), but and apps and games like Job Simulator and others might work great.   All that said, if you're just buying for VR, I would wait at least until the 3xx series comes out before purchasing. If you also want to buy a new GPU to play GTAV or something else before VR, I would probably aim at least a little higher for something like a 290. You can find them on GPUshack and other stores on sale for pretty good prices these days."

Vive,2zlnmk,Tetrylene,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:44:54 2015 UTC,Good point. I also think that because the Vive currently has a solid input system it'll cause developers to gravitate towards developing for it after being in limbo with the lack of input on the Oculus side of things.

It would cool but unlikely if they had an option to upgrade screen in the future, so they produce what they can now and make it possible to upgrade to better screen in the future that would max out HDMI 2.0 or DP specs. Example 1200 x 1080(hope higher for CV1) to 2400 x 2160, I am not sure if the specs support the 90 hz at those resolutions though, so may not be feasible.

Vive,2zir0o,500500,23,Wed Mar 18 22:27:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but it's hard to even bring myself to read the article all the way through when it starts off by stating that, ""The HTC Vive and Sony’s Project Morpheus were just unveiled"", while the Project Morpheus was unveiled back in March 2014. And promptly after mentions ""Magic Leap"" when it has nothing to even do with VR. Already that makes me fully aware that the author is greatly uninformed and not in a position to write an article like this, and whatever points they make further down will likely be disregarded because I'm not sure I can trust what they're saying.  This misinformed writing only continues as the article goes on, making it clear that the author has not even tried any of these devices themselves. ""The images are still pixelated and lag a tiny bit"", the image isn't that bad at all. Sure, you notice the screen-door effect when you focus on it, but the image itself is fine. And nobody has reported any lag on the latest prototypes, I really don't know where the author took that from.   They don’t mean that VR is indistinguishable from reality. As Jason Jerald, a technology consultant for VR companies, puts it, “We can get very engaged in cartoon-like worlds.” Images don’t have to look perfect for presence.   Here we see the author's misunderstanding of the quote. And misunderstanding of what VR needs to be. In order for VR to work, we don't need photorealistic computer graphics, which is what the quote says. Yet, the author insists that photorealistic graphics are essential.  The author then goes in depth into his statement that latency is killing VR. Which, like I said before, nobody else has reported is the case. I'm not saying there isn't latency, but by now, it's not the cause of motion sickness. The reason why people get motion sickness with the latest VR devices is not latency, but seeing movement on the screen while actually sitting/standing still. Which is why nobody got motion sickness in the HTC Vive demos where they walked around themselves, or any other standing-up demos shown recently. Many people get motion sick in a car, myself included. Is there latency involved anywhere? No.  The vergence-accommodation conflict is the first part of the article where the author writes anything sensible. And yes, while this is something that should be worked upon, it isn't a key element that destroys a VR experience.  The wide field-of-view problem is also real and needs to be heavily considered once VR devices start actually reaching these higher FOVs. For now, we'll have to make-do with the lower FOVs, which is far from the solution, but it's good enough for the time being. Once again, it doesn't pull you out of the experience.  Movement is another problem that hasn't been solved. Many different solutions have been suggested, but all of them are either impractical or temporary workarounds.  Overall, this article failed to say anything we don't already know and gave a lot of false information in the first half."

Vive,2z5vb7,callezetter,-1,Sun Mar 15 21:25:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps not a blunder,  but with a November 2015 release, they have 7 months and 17 days to establish the brand.

But in a race kind of sense we dont really know how even the track look yet. Or who´s even showing up to the race. Still alot in the dark i believe.   So its going to be a loooong race and nov15 is just the start of it. And thats great news! VR as a tech used by billions isnt really on the horizon yet. It will still primarily be a  niche gamer product in the beginning i think.  But that will open doors, and so the ball is rolling. I think Mobile is still whats going to take VR to the masses as an entrypoint. Then the real stuff will be waiting.  I really dont think VR is going to be a brand vs brand race, like consoles. Atleast I surely dont hope so. We need a common standard for input and output that everyone can develop towards. And valve opening up tech like lighthouse to anyone is a great show of hand towards that. They know standards are needed, and will help everyone in the end."

Vive,2ynqqi,500500,5,Wed Mar 11 08:30:44 2015 UTC,This jumped out at me    HTC says it’s working on a way for the Vive to adapt to transient obstacles like pets or other humans   Probably has something to do with those cameras on the vive which is cool.  Hopefully it will integrate something like google's project tango that can see and recognize objects.  It could work as a pass through camera (so you can see the world without taking off the vive) and you can mark objects/areas that have things you might trip over so you can have them appear when you are near them like the wall grids.

Vive,2ynqqi,BOLL7708,2,Wed Mar 11 11:22:59 2015 UTC,"The first time I heard of the experience described as a holodeck I immediately thought that gets it across perfectly. Its relatable to an experience that most of us are aware of, and hints at the possibilities. As a DK2 owner it also gets across whats different about the Vive immediately. Doubtless ill be buying both, but right now i'm more excited about the possibilities that play out with the Vive."

Vive,2yp531,Magog14,8,Wed Mar 11 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"Except you actually can't go through the portal.  You'd shoot a portal at the wall in your room, and then what?  You can't physically go through the wall.  Or if you shoot the portal on the wall, it goes, lets say 2 feet in front of where the real wall is, allowing you to step through it, but then what?  You're now facing your wall and would have to rotate back towards your room.    I think elevators and teleporters are going to work great, and eventually a basketball court sized play area, but 15x15 is going to be rough."
Vive,2yp531,Octogenarian,3,Wed Mar 11 17:51:47 2015 UTC,The portal would be on a virtual wall that is far enough from the real wall that you wouldnt bump into it.
Vive,2yp531,scswift,6,Wed Mar 11 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't solve anything.  A 10x10 room with a portal on a wall with another 10x10 room on the other side (which may be the same room you're already in) is functionally equivalent to a wall with a doorway.    All you've done is make the problem WORSE, because where before you had a 10x10 room that fits the constraints of your real world room now you can run n one direction forever in the virtual space but not in the real world one.  Anyway, I don't know what the big deal is about having the virtual world map 1:1 to your real space.  That would severely limit what you can do in VR and the demos I've seen for the Oculus have you on a rolllercoaster, or walking a path along a cliff face by a castle.  And these spaces are so large you can't walk them by physically walking places.  Also not everyone is going to have a 10x10 space to dedicate to VR, so then what?  Walkable space is nice for a few niche things, but for most games in VR walking is going to have to be controlled by the thumb stick."
Vive,2yp531,Rubbishwizard,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"Totes, a portal gun would just make it worse.  By definition it allows you to walk continuously in spite of walls.  That said, It could work if operating a ""passage"" through the portal could be used to turn the user around, like if the inside of one was a mini ""stargate"" and you navigated a short curved tunnel.  it still has the problem though of if they dont use portals to go everywhere they'll still hit walls"
Vive,2yp531,Octogenarian,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:32:30 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around...real world collision and games.  Everybody was so excited about the prospect of Lightsaber fights when the Wii came out but I was confused because the system would never work because you don't feel any resistance.  If you're wearing a VR headset and there's a virtual wall, so what?  You can walk through it.  Or, you can't in the game, but you can in real life so what happens then?"

Vive,2yp531,AistoB,2,Wed Mar 11 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"Think of the valve 15x15 (or whatever your particular dimensions will be) as a sort of foreground stage. Big enough for you to stretch out your arms and manipulate nearby objects with fine control. It's big enough for you to crouch, lean, turn around, take a few steps in any direction. The idea here isn't to create worlds that exist only in the confines of your 15x15 room, it's to enable interaction with the virtual space surrounding you. Anything beyond your immediate vicinity will still require you to move the scene around you using your controller.  However manipulating objects, pick up, push, pull, throw, use, all these complex interactions will be far more compelling than wandering around in circles or sliding over a treadmill. Forget about moving like you do in reality, I think people who are so hung up on trying simulate this sort of movement are missing the point a little. Why walk when you can fly?"
Vive,2yp531,UltraChip,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"Wow... it seems so obvious now but you're right - being able to fly is probably the most elegant solution to long-distance transportation in VR. Everyone always talks about teleporting or ""just walking with the thumbstick"" but I always figured those would be really disorienting - flying is the perfect way to get around that.   You wouldn't even need a trackpad or anything on your controller - just stick your arms out and use intuitive hand gestures to steer."

Games with fixed controls like a steering wheel or HOTAS just may be better off using the real thing. I say that not because I already invested in a HOTAS, but because there's two dozen little buttons scattered on the thing that all serve a different purpose that I can't see Valve's motion controllers covering. It may just be better to design from the ground-up when it comes to certain kinds of controls."

Vive,2yetqh,yocal,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:33:10 2015 UTC,Very nice drawing - but personally I'd prefer using dedicated controllers for something like that to get the real feel of it.

Vive,2ya4yk,Lhun,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"The use of a large fixed point of reference when moving does make a difference in non-cockpit games, but your understanding of the vestibular system is a little off.    I don't know if you've ridden segways, but it was my experience that you absolutely feel movement. When you lean forward to make it accelerate, you feel it accelerate.  People don't get motion sick reading in cars because of feeling velocity (you actually can't physically feel velocity), they get sick from feeling all of the accelerations and rotations of turning and road imperfections.    From the wikipedia article on the vestibular system:   the vestibular system comprises two components: the semicircular canal system, which indicate rotational movements; and the otoliths, which indicate linear accelerations   So far as a vestibular disconnect is concerned, it isn't velocity that's the problem.  It's acceleration and spinning.  When I was first playing around with locomotion, I experimented with how third person movement felt compared to first person.  It immediately felt better just popping the camera out behind the player for a third person view.  Having the camera closer to the player felt better than farther away because of having a larger fixed point of reference like you talk about having in cockpit games.  My next thought was to soften the camera movements by having the camera smoothly stretch behind the player when they start to move and catch up when they stop.  It felt terrible!  When the player and camera instantly moved forward at the moving speed and then instantly stopped, there was no time spent accelerating.  When the camera smoothly accelerated up to moving speed and then slowly decelerated to a stop my vestibular system was shouting at me that something was wrong.  The other thing that improved comfort in that little experiment was shrinking the world scale down when moving.  I think your idea of having a fixed object was translating the player would would work well for a lot of games by simply jumping into a third person view temporarily as an option for sensitive players."

It's anecdotal, but I see other couples who have separate accounts, or hide expenses from each other, etc... and they seem to always complain about the others spending, be in fights about it and be in money trouble.

Vive,2y8shz,ianott,-7,Thu Mar 19 09:43:01 2015 UTC,"It has never been confirmed how Lighthouse actually works and I don't think it is inside-out tracking.  The way I see it, the base stations communicate with the PC, the same way Oculus' camera does.  It shoots lasers, looks at the time it takes to come back and then finds out the distance and position.  The holes on the Vive are like reflectors that the base station recognizes.  Look at ""Tested"" interview with a Valve engineer for some insight.    It does not changes your point but it's still ouside-in and it could not work with GearVR since the data is sent to a PC, from the base stations.  Edit: rewatched the talk and you are right it is inside out but not using patterns projected on wall, it uses timing of the lasers.  Anyway it cannot be used for gearvr because the libraries by Valve are not for Android nor for ARM, although they might be someday."
Vive,2y8shz,FredH5,5,Sat Mar 7 19:05:47 2015 UTC,I take it you didn't listen to Valve's dev talk about the tracking then?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leg2gS6ShZw&t=50s  Edit: Sorry you even mentioned the talk in your comment.  The lighthouse stations are completely dumb.  The sensors on the headset are what's detecting the laser as it sweeps by and it's reporting that timing information back to the PC.
Vive,2y8shz,Mekrob,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:58:06 2015 UTC,Sorry you are right.  The Tested guy threw me away as he was referring to the speed of light and I took it as the station getting the beam back.  The speed of light has nothing to do with the way it works.

The Tested video never mentions that the laser signals are returned to the beacons, but it does say the HMD uses sensors, not reflectors."

In the interview with the engineer, he  says that all calculations are done through timing and that the layout on the HMD is what is important and is what is being recognized.  With inside out tracking, the layout on the HMD is not as crucial, the layout on the wall is.    With layouts projected in an unknown environment, it's very hard (impossible?) to accurately recognize layout, as it is constant from the point of view of the base stations but not from an arbitrary point of view (i.e. the HMD)"
Vive,2y8shz,FredH5,2,Sat Mar 7 19:52:12 2015 UTC,"Wireless adds too much latency. The timing, I suspect, comes from how long it takes the beacon to sweep from sensor to sensor."

I don’t really think it’s going to be that expensive regardless. Many see Oculus as the company that resurrected VR but in reality Valve was a major player in doing so as well.

Rigid-spec consoles aren't going to be dying anytime soon, but this is the future of ""console"" gaming.  Has Valve talked about social experiences yet?

And honestly, I don't see there ever being a real cure for sim sickness when the player controls their movement with a controller. How do you lie to your inner-ear regarding what your eyes are seeing? Fast-paced first person shooters will probably never be totally comfortable. And really that's why games should be designed from the ground up for VR. They're going to be very non-traditional compared to what the average gamer is used to.  I lied, though. There are tricks. ""Time Rifters"" from Proton Studio is pretty fast paced, involves rapid jumping & fast turning, and I have never gotten sick inside of it. I'm sure they have many tricks that are cumulative to this magic formula, but most notably, proving a constant frame of reference in front of the player helps quite a bit. If I remember correctly, the game's UI is a 3D, almost spherical object around the player. Same principle with sit-down cockpit games inducing no nausea."
Vive,2y0g70,RIFT-VR,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"What kind of games would have enough content and longevity to allow for 15+ hours of gameplay, when you are restricted to a small room sized arena.   Think outside the box :D  1 - Traditional VR. Left stick directional pad to walk. Maybe snap by preset degree # when turning to avoid sickness. Lots of problems still. Can supplement walking around in real life. Hit a wall in VR? Change your position and continue moving in real life.  2 - Valve employees' idea: press a button to scale down the world, walk in real life, traversing a much greater distance, then press again to scale back to normal size. Like a map-mode or fast travel system in real time.  3 - http://i.imgur.com/eTFBf3F.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/C3qZ9n5.jpg  /\ These are very cool. I don't have a great understanding, though. Essentially you can, when the player is walking, slightly alter their path virtually in a manner that is completely not recognized by the human brain, but while compensating for these game-assisted alterations in path, force the player to curve in ways that reduce the play space needed. The illusion allows for traversing what feels like a greater amount of real-life space and could make spaces feel less restrictive.  These are just a few. I know the Valve guys have been brainstorming this for ages, and they probably have some pretty cool tricks up their sleeves.  Long story short, the game environments don't have to be limited to the size of your home's space. There are some neat ways developers could still allow the player to traverse huge environments while also moving around their confined space at home."

I think LoL and Dota 2 look, well, pretty lame to play, but if the battleground populated my living room, and we had the option to zoom and scale as much as we wanted, I would watch the crap out games.  I was doing some hobbyist development as well. Got semi-deep into 2 projects and realized that I was going to have to wait for optimization on both Unity and Oculus' ends.  And...and then Vive was announced. Oculus is a little dead to me, so I'd rather not put time into developing for a sinking ship. I think I'm gonna wait until I can develop for Vive.

Could I technically optimize better on my end? Sure, but I don't feel like ruining the atmosphere by deleting all sorts of details and lowering graphical fidelity.

First person shooters, and games alike will still be difficult to play without some (or most) feel discomfort, because of how you move while seated.

Vive,2y2sep,zorflax,3,Thu Mar 5 23:15:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking of this for the star citizen fps  Alow the player to define a space equal to their room.   While doing long distance moving the player holds a button on one controller  and the d pad on the other.   When the long distance button is released an area the same size as your space is set into the Game world and you then gain full control of the character. If there is a box in front of you you duck and cover behind it leaning out to shoot etc.   Once the firefight is over an AR beacon points you to a pre defined center of your room and you walk there or just use the long distance button from where you're at the continue moving.
Vive,2y2sep,CharlesDarwin59,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:28:32 2015 UTC,While the vibe solves the nausea problem of fps by making you walk in a room. I feel as if it's ignoring the problem of playing an fps by sitting down.   To me the vibe will work great for those few who have the space for something like this. But it will not be in the same boat as Morpheus or oculus because of the space constraint.   Maybe this is the best solution to the problem. But something makes me feel like it's more of an admission that the problem cannot be solved in the case of sitting down and seeing your character walking.

I have never tried VR headset before so i don't know what causes the sickness. But i have several ideas of moving the character. For example, would it reduce sickness if you use both thumbsticks instead? One for moving forward and the other for turning and your headset is for where ever you want to look.  Would that cause sickness?  How about turning depend on your headset movement? How about a button press to move the character forward instead of stick?  What happened if you move forward with the stick and then move yourself back physically..would that cause sickness? i have no idea.  Is turning while standing cause the same sickness as seating while turning? I don't know.

Vive,2y2h82,Quetzacoatl85,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:21:15 2015 UTC,"Great idea. And not only the dimensions of your room, you could also map furniture and other obstacles! I feel Microsoft's IllumiRoom/RoomAlive did something a little (but not totally) similar by integrating real-life objects and obstacles into the game world.  I think it would work great when having a top-down view on tiny game characters you're commanding (like the tiny world demo on HTC Vive). Also puzzle games, or games with procedural levels, or something like Minecraft maybe. Also adventures that consist of a series of rooms through which you have to traverse and solve puzzles etc.  One more thought on this: Considering the endless variety in shapes of people's rooms, I think the game world would have to support highly modular design for this to work, so it might not be too well suited for the classic first-person action adventure/rpg/shooter type of game, that relies on architecture and level design a lot. Of course it's debatable if such classic game types would even work well in VR anyway. If they do, Valve's solution of fixed world design+variable boundary display sounds very cool and I'd be interested in a seeing a game using that. Also another solution was mentioned where the game world is displayed at an angle, so you think you're going straight, but you're actually running in large circles. Would have to be bigger than a 4.5m x 4.5m room though to be unnoticeable I think.  In any case, it's a really interesting thought, and a good example of the type of innovations in game design  that VR will make necessary. And it shows that the lines between VR and AR could become blurry sooner than we think, because how much of the ""real world"" has to/can be visible for it to still be called AR/VR?"
Vive,2y2h82,killboy11,0,Fri Mar 6 08:26:58 2015 UTC,That cant work. There are 2 scenarios. 1. You only walk in game when you walk in reallive . that would mean that the game room cant be bigger than your room and that would make it hard to make a real game. 2. You use some sort of controller + walk in reallife then the game cant know were it should place the walls to alite it perfectly because the game cant know if you walk in reallife or use the controller to walk.   To make a wall of some sort to warn you that you are getting to near to the reallife wall you need to come up with a idea that blends in with your game.  Some games only need a tiny room so that would be working if you aligth the wall with your reallife wall and in a shooter you can say that you can move arround in a shield the size of your room and with a controller you can move the shield and you charakter.  I myself want to develop a game but first i need the Setup to test my ideas.
Vive,2y3wbw,CharlesDarwin59,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:07:06 2015 UTC,I dont think that the vive scans you room i a way to tell were every obstacle is . And that would also require the player to have a room big enough to have some space for the game. So you have 3 options. 1. Make a game only for people with enough room. 2. Make it a seated experience for the whole game were you either sit in a virual chair or walk with a controller. 3. Make both options possible.
Vive,2y3wbw,killboy11,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:29:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I think people are going to need to have a room somewhat dedicated to this where they can at least move stuff out of the way.  In the tested video the valve guy did say you define the space I assume by running a controler along the walls.   He also said you could tell it where furniture is.  But again in a small space I think you'd just want it devoid of anything

Vive,2y382g,IAMA_Plumber-AMA,2,Fri Mar 6 07:43:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I've got 2 R9 290s, so I'm in the same boat. AMD released their info on getting crossfire to work perfectly for VR though, 1GPU/eye, so I'm set at least for the HTC Vive."
Vive,2y382g,re3al,2,Fri Mar 6 07:58:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, so now I need another 290x? Guess I'll wait another 5-10 years for dollar parity..."
Vive,2y382g,IAMA_Plumber-AMA,2,Fri Mar 6 08:02:27 2015 UTC,"You'll probably be fine with a 290X. Have you used a VR device before with your PC? I run the Oculus Rift DK2 fine at 75FPS on high end Unreal 4 demos with a single R9 290.  I don't know how GPU intensive the Vive will be in comparison, but I think you'll be fine."
Vive,2y382g,re3al,2,Fri Mar 6 08:25:02 2015 UTC,"Well, no. I haven't run any VR on my PC. I bought my 290x in expectation that it would be beefy enough to run (near) future VR sets if I wanted to.  It's good to hear that I'll be OK for a little while, at least."
Vive,2y382g,IAMA_Plumber-AMA,4,Fri Mar 6 08:35:04 2015 UTC,"Based on where I see the technology going, I think you'll have a very fluid experience in this first generation of VR. So the Oculus Rift consumer version, and Vive will work at the highest frame rate and detail.   As for the next generation of VR headsets (maybe ~2 years from now it will start) there will be an increase in resolution, which means people need beefier graphics cards.   But basically you'll be fine for years if you want to stick with the first generation until it's worth upgrading."
Vive,2y382g,re3al,2,Fri Mar 6 08:39:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's pretty much all I wanted, this generation anyways."
Vive,2y382g,IAMA_Plumber-AMA,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on several factors. How well will graphics drivers be optimized? How much can Valve/oculus optimize on their end? How well optimized will the games be? Vulkan/dx12 should greatly improve performance.   Very hard to tell, but it should be in everyone's interest to reach as great an audience as possible, so I don't think it will be too beastly. We'll know more near release."

Vive,2xxx0m,DrDougExeter,2,Fri Mar 6 22:16:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't assume so because they're used for positional tracking... Maybe they're just to map the room you're in? Haha, I'm sure we'll know more when the Dev kit is released."
Vive,2xxx0m,YouLostTheGame97,2,Fri Mar 6 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean.  I was talking about if you were just going to remain seated while playing but now I see how you'd still need the sensors for head tracking.  It's a really interesting system they have.  I know that they know what they are doing and this is the right way to go about this, I just hope it doesn't raise the price too much because I want this thing so bad!    The room mapping really took me by surprise.  I was not expecting that at all."
Vive,2xxx0m,DrDougExeter,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:30:27 2015 UTC,"Can we just use normal dual analog controllers?  I hate the touchpads and I really dislike having the controller split in half.  It's a pain in the ass trying to hold those things and operate the stick/touchpad at the same time.  I mean I understand the concept behind these but I don't have 15 x 15 feet to just be walking around swinging my arms around, and I don't want to play like that anyway.  I just want to sit down with a normal controller and the headset on.  Edit: you know what, after thinking about it for a minute I've changed my mind.  I'm going to take a wait and see approach with an open mind, because I can definitely see the advantages of this system."
Vive,2xy2za,500500,5,Wed Mar 4 20:46:28 2015 UTC,That's nice. And I actually trust most of the people praising the Vive to be objective. But I'm really waiting to see what the views are when people can somewhat compare it side by side with the Rift.
Vive,2xy2za,totodes,4,Wed Mar 4 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"Its kinda interesting how the names seem fitting...  The Oculus Rift caused a big rift when the facebook deal happened. The collective reaction was a big WTF. It was obvious to everyone that the goals and vision of the two had practically nothing in common. A year later and all the supposed benefits still have yet shown up, and the promise to stay true to the vision seems.. increasingly tenuous.    Now the Valve/HTC re Vive has revived the hope and promise.  Suddenly the goals are ambitious again. The vision and direction are aligned, in action and in good hands.   So far, the only good thing to come out of the FB deal is that it seemed to make valve say ""Ok, fuck it, we'll do it right ourselves.""  But all that put aside, and just looking at the tech. When CV1 finally comes out, even if it were to have better specs on resolution or FOV, the Lighthouse tracking with SteamVR is clearly the superior solution. And thats even if both are used as a seated experience. Then throw in the controllers, and the 15'x15' space...  I just can't imagine they have some, yet-unknown grand reveal with CV1 that can compare. Their best hope is to scratch the current IR led / camera tracking and adopt Lighthouse as an industry standard. It's even free.   As for price. I'd love to see $300. I'd pay $500 or more with grumbling and cursing."
Vive,2xy2za,bluuit,5,Thu Mar 5 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. No matter what CV1 can do when it's revealed, Valve wins. Valve creating what they have, and the standards they're creating..the controllers...Steam integration...it's the absolutely best-case-scenario for someone like me.  I'm into VR for high-fidelty, PC-based gaming experiences. Zero interest in Oculus anymore. Their focus has shifted too much into novelties like GearVR. What a waste of resources that was. If I were an Oculus employee, I'd be pretty defeated right about now. Such potential....gone."

Vive,2xudfo,JayKayAu,2,Tue Mar 3 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"Nothing has officially been explained yet, but I'll attempt to relay what I've gathered... take it with a grain or two of salt.  Yes, they are a type of photo-sensor. (cameras would have lenses/smaller aperture,) They work in combination with two wall units to make a room scale tracking system code named Lighthouse.    The two wall units emit IR laser light and are mounted at 90 degrees from each other. This gives triangulation of each of those sensors.   They are indented like that to narrow the field of view to roughly 120 degrees. If they were all on the surface they would have a much wider FOV and more of them would continually stay in view of the laser emitters.   By registering which sensors are receiving IR light (possibly even having different wavelengths for the different base stations) the system can pinpoint the location, position, direction, angle, etc..  in combination with the more common gyrosensor and accelerometer that track motion, speed, etc..   It is unlike the kinect which paints a wide swath of IR dots, then maps those dots to a surface using stereo cameras.   It is also different than the oculus which has the emitters on the headset, tracked by a camera base station.  I am unsure about why the asymmetrical layout. Also the two middle sensors. Cameras perhaps, but two only make sense if they were horizontal and could provide pass-through stereo vision.  Possibly a proximity sensor."

I'm not entirely clear but some people are calling it ""reVive"" as that is what the logo says with ""Vive"" being the trademark friendly word.   So if Vive  is a play on 'revive', we can see the dictionary meanings.   as in to activate, set in motion, or take up again; renew: to restore to life or consciousness: to put on or show again. to make operative or valid again. to bring back into notice, use, or currency: to revive a subject of discussion. to quicken or renew in the mind; bring back: to revive memories. to reanimate or cheer    which might make sense for future marketing campaigns."
Vive,2xpu3f,500500,7,Mon Mar 2 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""RE"" part could cause some confusion. HTC is launching the Vive as part of their new RE lineup.

Vive,2xp24c,Kordan9090,2,Tue Mar 3 04:45:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest it only makes sense that they would use Half-Life IP to bolster the HMD.  As we all know, outside of early adopters and developers, there won't be much draw for people to spend money on an HMD this year without some kind of catalog that includes at least one big recognizable game on board.  I doubt they are expecting a gazillion sales this first year, but they do need to impress early adopters to keep momentum up.  Stepping into HL2 with my DK1 was one of the first experiences I had in VR, and it was amazing.  I remember jumping a little in my chair when one of the alien guards shoved me back when I got too close, and I'm not easily startled.  Experiencing even those aging graphics in VR was amazing, so reworking an older game might even be good enough."

Vive,2xnrme,ETisME,3,Tue Mar 3 15:06:36 2015 UTC,May I ask what's your take on why it won't be good?
Vive,2xnrme,ZarianPrime,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:57:12 2015 UTC,This technology combines both kinect (sort of) and vr.   This means it pretty much will have more problems than just vr  (which isnt a mature technology to say)  This also means even higher development obstacles for third party game developers.  I don't think there will be much have tailorsuited for the whole experience.
Vive,2xnrme,ETisME,2,Tue Mar 3 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"Fair point. But I don't think it needs the whole experience to be successful. We aren't ready for the whole experience, as an industry of people who scoff at the input lag in a controller vs M/KB. However that doesn't mean if one aspect fails the whole thing does.  I've played with the Oculus and I can imagine benefiting from it in just about every game I play. The biggest thing that will need to change is how you use First Person. The ARMA series has this example already. They have detached your head from your body, as in you can run in one direction while looking around. For VR to take off in First Person games, I think that is the biggest change that needs to become 'the norm'. Everything beyond that will be on a case-by-case basis."
Vive,2xnrme,NoShftShck16,3,Tue Mar 3 15:26:05 2015 UTC,"I have tried the oculus as well (Short demo), and I loved it.  I want it to be the norm for future gaming but I don't see this happening to this particular hardware.  On the other hand I think people should be more excited for the sony VR because we can expect a big support from major titles.  Of cause this is just the gaming aspect, the htc website looks like they have plans to go beyond gaming which is interesting."
Vive,2xnrme,ETisME,2,Wed Mar 4 00:37:27 2015 UTC,I don't know. I disagree. I think indie developers are what will drive the VR movement into the mainstream. There is no better area for indie developers than Steam.
Vive,2xnrme,NoShftShck16,2,Wed Mar 4 01:01:26 2015 UTC,I have my doubt on indie developer on this field. I think major devs are better at utilizing new technologies.  Kinect for example.
Vive,2xnrme,ETisME,2,Wed Mar 4 04:15:09 2015 UTC,"Euro Truck Simulator for example. Full Oculus support. Apotheon, full Oculus support (demoed at last years PAX). I guarantee more people will be jumping on this. How many AAA titles have really embraced the kinect? I'd say a very small amount because they are cross platform. Indie developers on steam typically are PC only in their early stages. Adding on VR support is seemingly easier than trying to release in Sony and Microsoft's console-based stores."
Vive,2xnrme,NoShftShck16,2,Wed Mar 4 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"I do agree with your point but certainly you can see how lack in support it is as of now, the amount of games that fully support oculus is tiny.  By adding the challenging aspect of kinect and vr, it's going to push away devs every further, let alone indie.  Kinect at least had good first part games supporting it and even with a hobbyist building up initially, nothing really make usage of it.  I would prefer they get the VR perfect and then add in aspect of interacting with VR."

Vive,2xnhng,Babywolverine,15,Mon Mar 2 08:42:46 2015 UTC,"This always comes up in HMD threads, the answer is always the same: The display doesn't drive the system requirements, the software does. Metro: Last Light in VR is going to need a better hardware spec than Minecraft would.   The only thing to be mindful of is that your games are going to have to run at 90fps at least to to make the best use of the 90hz display.   As always, build the best PC for what you can afford to spend. As a rule, get the best single GPU card you can. don't go SLI or crossfire because performance differs dramatically from title to title (many game makers simply don't care about the 2% of their users who are lucky enough to have multi-card setups). Keep the money you'd spend on that second card and spend it in a year and a half time on a card that's twice as powerful and consistent. after that, spend a little more on CPU, extra RAM and an SSD to speed things along. Look up benchmark sites like toms hardware to find charts to the best parts for the lowest price, pick the best you can afford and you're set!"
Vive,2xnhng,TheRealBlueMelon,4,Mon Mar 2 09:40:21 2015 UTC,Is there any reason why the VR Helmets are set to 90hz?
Vive,2xnhng,ReallyLongLake,4,Mon Mar 2 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"High and consistent frame rates are important for VR because many users become uneasy or downright motion sick with stuttering or low htz. Additionally, high frame rates allow for a much more believable experience."
Vive,2xnhng,TheRealBlueMelon,2,Mon Mar 2 16:21:28 2015 UTC,"Of course, but the 90hz screens are due to them being small correct? Nothing really out there to get a 144hz display on a VR helmet yes?"
Vive,2xnhng,cleverley1986,1 point,Mon Mar 2 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"castAR was developed by a team of former workers from Valve, one of it's 3 modes of operation is VR mode via clipon optics. the dual displays are projectors that run at 120hz. Although they are 720p they have a high fill rate, with a little AA I figure the experience might be good.   It's worth mentioning that few of us have seen a display over 60hz since the days of premium CRT monitors. it makes a huge difference provided your machine can keep up."
Vive,2xn19r,okdek88,5,Mon Mar 2 05:04:25 2015 UTC,I've used the Oculus dk2 (which is also strapped to your eyes) with glasses just fine as they're quite spacious so I'm really hoping that vive will have the same sort of foam and adjustable accomodations
Vive,2xn19r,Velvokay,4,Mon Mar 2 06:37:55 2015 UTC,"But is it comfortable? I have only tried the Google Cardboard, and the extra-space between your eyes and the lenses, because of the glasses, make a lot of difference. More tunnel vision, less immersion. There's a very noticeable difference between using it with glasses and with contact lenses. Have you noticed something like that on the rift?"
Vive,2xn19r,Velvokay,1 point,Mon Mar 2 17:59:03 2015 UTC,I have frame glasses and the DK2 literally fits over and around the glasses and I never experienced any discomfort. It also has adjustment knobs so that you can make the headset farther away from your face if they're to close to your glasses.
Vive,2xn19r,500500,2,Tue Mar 3 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the response! (:"
Vive,2xn19r,sheburns,3,Tue Mar 3 01:49:16 2015 UTC,My gut reaction would be that image processing could compensate.    Quick search and I see Apple has a patent http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/12/apple-patent-reveals-oculus-rift-like-headset-for-short-sighted-viewers/  You would think that this would be a big selling point.  Maybe that will be a 2nd generation.
Vive,2xn19r,ZeroSuitSamus,3,Mon Mar 2 10:31:27 2015 UTC,"If virtual reality is something you have an interest in, switching to contact lenses is always an option.  LASIK prices are also going down every year."
Vive,2xn19r,TiagoTiagoT,4,Mon Mar 2 16:25:29 2015 UTC,Actually I just had LASIK done about two weeks ago and prices are higher now then they were in the past. My dad paid $400 less then I did at the same clinic a few years ago.
Vive,2xn19r,Kordan9090,4,Mon Mar 2 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I use contact lenses sometimes, but I work at home so I don't use them that much (I highly prefer wearing glasses at home), and it's too much of a pain to put on the contacts every time I want to play something on VR."
Vive,2xn19r,warrri,5,Mon Mar 2 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"Contacts don't stay on my eyes; and because of the cornea transplants, carving my eyeballs with lasers is not a option :("
Vive,2xn19r,RIFT-VR,2,Tue Mar 3 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. For some reason, my eyes just don't take contacts. They just fall right off."
Vive,2xn19r,NoShftShck16,5,Tue Mar 3 04:51:29 2015 UTC,"Wait im confused. Nearsighted means you can see near objects well but far objects are blurry. Why would that be a problem if the device is centimeters from your eyes? Im nearsighted myself (-2.0) but haven't tested any VR yet, so i dont know. Anyway, you could use contact lenses?"
Vive,2xn19r,RIFT-VR,6,Mon Mar 2 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"I won't pretend to understand how optics work in any way, shape or form. But I am extremely nearsighted, and using the Rift without my glasses leads to a very blurry experience and I cannot read sharp text. And I thought the same thing as you - the screen is an inch away, so why should it matter? Well, it does, and I'm not sure why, and it sucks.  In a few experiences this actually helps, as it blurs the screen-door-effect, but you still can't see fine detail.  Maybe it is a side effect of how the lenses allow your eyes to focus?"
Vive,2xn19r,ChockFullOfShit,2,Mon Mar 2 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason I thought the lenses would be interchangeable? The Google Cardboard, or at least the ones you can make yourself give you the ability to just swap lenses out to accomodate eyesight issues. The lenses you use are just slightly less fancy that those in the Oculus and what I imagine is in the Vive."
Vive,2xn19r,WLF68,2,Mon Mar 2 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"I imagine this will be a must in consumer-ready devices - the ability to either use a generic lens to correct for myopia (like some scuba goggles I've tried), or to allow for the purchase of special order a range of lenses that each cover a board range of eye issues that vary in severity.  But I'm not sure how these corrective measures screw with the distortion algorithms that are corrected in the lens, so that's easier said than done."
Vive,2xn19r,SniperMarmot,2,Mon Mar 2 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"Why don't you get a ""Google"" Cardboard? They're almost free on eBay and similar sites. It's a fun toy while you wait for the consumer version of the rift Vive.  The (nearsighted) experience is quite similar for what I understand. I also don't understand why the lenses don't let you see the screen while it's close to you eyes, something about how they make you focus or something, I don't know.   The rift comes with various lenses for different levels of nearsightedness. I really don't like that solution. And some mobile headsets (plastic versions of the cardboard) are adjustable, like most binoculars, so you can use them without the glasses or contact lenses. If that works for something bigger like the Vive, I think that would be a much better solution."
Vive,2xn19r,snowwaffles,2,Mon Mar 2 17:51:24 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, your brain thinks an object is far away, so it focuses appropriately and then your nearsightedness means you see a bundle of shit."
