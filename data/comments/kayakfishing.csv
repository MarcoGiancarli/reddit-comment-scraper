The anchor trolley is also useful for deploying a drift chute. I like to have 2 rod holders up front and two just behind the seat so I can fish up to four rods at once. I also fish at night so lighting is also important.

The reviews that are ""good"" on the FS128T are typically from inexperienced kayakers who end up hating the boat in the long run but won't update their reviews. Do yourself a favor and look into buying a used Ride 115; I know you won't have the length of the FS128T but you will get better quality, higher weight capacity, and a better handling boat. Good luck with your search!"

I bought a Pescador 12 a year and a half ago and I feel better and better about it every time I take it out. I've also had the chance to take out a few other boats and I didn't feel an ounce of envy or regret.
kayakfishing,3dzgo3,schmuckmulligan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:41 2015 UTC,I'd like to be able to stand and from some of the videos I've watched it appears that the ascend is stable for the most part. I have good balance so I'm not worried about that.
kayakfishing,3dzgo3,schmuckmulligan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  The Pescador isn't a reasonable standing platform, so probably not the boat for you."

kayakfishing,3ds2ms,ghostbackwards,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:04:26 2015 UTC,I'm in the Fairfield/Bridgeport area. I just started Kayak fishing a few weeks ago and am having way too much fun. The fish seem to be plentiful in my area. I use live bunker when the opportunity presents itself. Also been having a huge amount of luck using these soft baits: http://imgur.com/AoA3BM6 with a spinning rod. I just bought a really sweet rig for vertical jigging and plan on heading for deeper water next week after I install my Lowrance Mark 4.  Where are you fishing?
kayakfishing,3ds2ms,Jellyman_04,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I'll have to get out there with some bunker and pick up some of those plastics I've been using silver minnows, sluggos, super spooks, and tubes with no luck. I'm fishing out of Guilford and Milford mostly, I live in the wtby area."
kayakfishing,3du4du,yakangler,2,Sun Jul 19 14:16:45 2015 UTC,"It's crazy.  That kayak is NOT worth that kind of money.  The new Hobie Outback is $2300 in a lot of places.  T he Jackson Kraken can be had for ~$1700.  This kayak is nowhere near the level of quality or fish ability of either of these kayaks.  Eddyline just priced themselves out of the game by a significant margin.  If you want a standable kayak that you can paddle, the Jackson Cuda 14 is a better option still.  13' @ 34"" wide, that's not going to be a yak you will want to paddle for very long.  The Cuda 14 isn't a joy to paddle, it's a compromise to stand and paddle reasonably well.  I do like the material they made it out of, hopefully more makers trend towards the lighter/rigid materials.  But yeah, this is a big ""no"" for most folks."

kayakfishing,3du4du,bear_glove,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:22 2015 UTC,We have noticed the same thing and wonder at what point the prices will max out.
kayakfishing,3du4du,Moumar,2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:27 2015 UTC,"People are willing to spend that kind of money on a kayak. I just don't think that this one offers enough to attract people in that market. Sure it's light but it's not that light. There's quite a few other kayaks that are similar, don't weigh that much more and are half the price.   In Australia I'd say more than half of kayak fishers have Hobie peddle yaks with a good proportion of those being PAs. If you're going price a kayak in the $2-3k price range it's going to be hard to compete with the peddle kayaks unless you have something more amazing than it being a bit lighter.   If the weight of the kayak was the most important thing to me is be looking at a fibreglass yak anyway. Stealth are making some nice fibreglass fishing kayak that are under 45 lbs and fall in that price bracket."

kayakfishing,3dqaiu,dinsauce,2,Sat Jul 18 14:56:34 2015 UTC,The best SOT fishing kayak is one that fits your needs.
kayakfishing,3dqaiu,vdubgti18t,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:56:49 2015 UTC,And that you can afford. People dwell on this question so much.
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,CESmokey,2,Sat Jul 18 13:46:55 2015 UTC,My first kayak was a Prowler 13 and it was an excellent intro boat. It hands chop well with the flared bow and tracks VERY well along with being fast. Cons is the seat had to be replaced early b/c the stock seat is garbage and mine had molded foot pegs instead of the real mccoy ones. Keep in mind it's not designed at all to stand on! No room for feet and the round bottom makes it tippy once you do get up. Overall its excellent value for it's price point.
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,ThunderCows,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a solid boat, and I think well worth the full price tag at academy for 700. I've never paddled it though and nearly bought one before I got my santa cruz raptor"
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,greenmen88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:13:17 2015 UTC,I have a trident 13 and love it. Quick and stable.  Dislike the seat and the foot pegs though but that isn't a problem on the prowler.
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,bear_glove,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:51:42 2015 UTC,Do you use it on inland lakes or ocean/ big water? Looking for something mainly for inland lakes with the occasional Lake Michigan float. Worried about it being too long..
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,bear_glove,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:20:25 2015 UTC,Mostly back bay/ marsh areas. I've had it in some tight creeks and had not problems turning it around.
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,bear_glove,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:46 2015 UTC,Is this you have had problems turning? I plan to do some river floats with it but nothing real tight
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,Keldog7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:15:54 2015 UTC,It turns alright but there's def a difference between longer and shorter boats. My ride 115 turns a bit easier than the trident but it's slower.
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,jigilous,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"Great boat, it'll take you anywhere and back."
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,steelyourself,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"It will work for you.  It's what I normally get when I rent one.  I agree on the seat and you'll probably want to make it more comfy for longer trips.  However, I just used my first Hobie with a mirage drive and man it's like night and day.  My hands were free to fish, it was easy to stay at the spot in wind and saved me lots of time getting to and from the spot."
kayakfishing,3dqhw1,Jabo13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:02 2015 UTC,I was looking at those the other day. I have a feeling I might be trading up next spring.
kayakfishing,3dqg21,freenarative,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:25:02 2015 UTC,"I think the main reason is they make the boat very slow when they're deployed. Also, with the amount of 32""+ wide fishing kayaks on the market today you probably don't need external stabilizers unless you are in some really rough water and want to stand up."
kayakfishing,3dqg21,searat3030,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:45:39 2015 UTC,My buddy rigged up pontoons on his Hobie Outback that he can easily deploy and retract. He uses them for extra balance when standing. He loves them
kayakfishing,3dqg21,Babyfart_McGeezacks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:12:22 2015 UTC,"I had a pyranah fusion a few years back that I made a set of outriggers to go on because it was not stable enough for me to fish from. Though it did work, it slowed the boat down, made paddling harder, and made it hard to get the kayak into places a John boat could fit in.   In short, yes it works. Yes I would do it again. I would just add a float directly on the side of the boat next time to make it a little more stable, instead of making huge outriggers. I think I would essentially bolt pool noodles to the side of the boat.  But, like other have said, there are enough boat options that you shouldnt need to do something like this unless money is a constraint or you are pushing the limits of what your boat should be doing."
kayakfishing,3dqg21,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Seems like a huge pain in the ass to me, I don't want anything slowing me down or more shit to deal with hauling around.  I've successfully been able to stand and piss in a bottle, drunk, in the dark, in the wind, in the middle of a lake at night.  Don't need any pontoons."
kayakfishing,3dqg21,Mightbehittingonyou,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:25 2015 UTC,I had my mind made up that I was going to build some outriggers for my kayak. I calculated the costs to build the one I thought would work best and stand up to big waves from time to time.    With my budget I was looking at about 1 mouth wait just to buy the stuff.    I ended up teaching myself to stand in my kayak w/out the pontoons. Saved $$$ and I swear every time I go I can stand easier and more naturally.
kayakfishing,3dqg21,TrailChaser,0,Tue Jul 21 02:05:34 2015 UTC,I can stand and paddled my kayak like a SUP as well as fish standing. No need for pontoons.

kayakfishing,3dp74s,billybingbollar,2,Sat Jul 18 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"Update: So I went to Caney Fork Outdoors store today which was an awesome experience in itself. After I had made this post last night, I decided to do a bit more reading and came across a few articles that recommended a Cuda for my type of fishing (big lakes, small lakes, rarely anu moving water). After talking with Ryan at the store, he sold me the Cuda 14. I spent about 4 hours on it this afternoon in about 98 degree heat and couldn't have been happier. You all weren't kidding when you said what a difference it was from what I previously had."

kayakfishing,3dmdeh,yakangler,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:12:08 2015 UTC,That centre hatch should be standard on the outback. I know you can DIY the rectangular pro angler hatch there but I don't see why they don't just put it on there in the first place. I'm sure most people would prefer it over the round one.
kayakfishing,3dmdeh,Moumar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:38:52 2015 UTC,Totally agree not sure why they choose to use the round hatch vs the rectangle when they did the update last year.  I know all functional equipment added to the LE can be purchased and added later but for some reason I really want to get my hands on one of these.
kayakfishing,3dmdeh,Moumar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:14:35 2015 UTC,My guess would be that they kept the round hatch to keep some distance between the outback and the pro angler. The new seat on the outback it harder to choose between the two if your considering both. If you're fishing inshore or something like that both kayaks would be a great choice.
kayakfishing,3diha7,banezing,7,Thu Jul 16 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"It was raining and storming all day, but I decided to go for it and caught two nice bass, the first around 4 pounds, the second almost 5.

kayakfishing,3di937,CookieMonstr78,3,Thu Jul 16 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"I fish tubbs and Lockwood pretty regular but on a gas boat.  I have been in tubbs on my nucanoe but your friend is right when the tide turns the water really moves because it's gotten so shallow in the last few years.   There are nice founder and trout in there however.   When I'm on my nucanoe I generally put in at the new landing under sunset beach bridge.   Usually fishing the pilings right under the bridge produces trout. If you don't already learn to throw a net, live mullet on a Carolina rig will be your best bet for reds gong into fall.   Fish a setup like this along ledges in the channels when the tide is moving. I like white gulp shrimp on quarter ounce jig heads for pitching to grass lines and creak mouths. Fish it almost just like for bass, popping it off the bottom and letting it fall.   Don't get discouraged if you miss some fish at first some of the fish will explode on it like a bass, but the bigger flounder can take some getting a feel for, I've found they kind of inhale the bait so if you feel like it just stops let it sit for a minute,  there might be a doormat on the other end."
kayakfishing,3di937,chemlock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:18:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.  I'm looking forward to getting down there in a couple weeks.  I was worried about having to paddle my ass off if the current is too strong with the tide. lol

Boats that some people stand on are very tippy when guys of our size (I'm six foot, 300lbs) get in them.  You need to go to a dealership, and paddle what they have. Pay attention to not only the width, but the hull design.  Then you'll know more about what you are looking for.  My 2 cents"

It's wider than most, but it doesn't lack in tracking. Plenty of deck space.. The chair is very comfortable and can be raised or lowered. I got mine on sale for $850. I love it, man. Couldn't be happier."
kayakfishing,3dej0w,WheelsAndGears,2,Wed Jul 15 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"I have been looking at boats a lot lately too. The best options I have found are the striker and the pescador. They are both in the same price range and both have great reviews. You won't be able to stand in the pescador, and you might not do well with standing in the striker. I am close in size, so I understand the physics of this well.   If you must get a boat you can stand in, go towards the striker. The higher seat on that one is kind of neat as well.   If you want a boat that will be more comfortable in that price range, look for the pescador 10 or 12 ft, whichever you like. Both boats have their equals made by other companies that are the exact same boat, so you might be able to compare options and save a hundred bucks somewhere.   If you are only doing short trips, less that 2 hours on flat water, either one will do fine. Where you will start to notice big differences is when you start to do longer trips and you want the better seat option or more gear/dry storage. If you take 6 rods or something, that is a factor too because you have to figure in the number of rod holders you need and how much it will cost to outfit the boat the way you want it.   If you're willing to go up a bit in price, the Moken 10 has served me incredibly well and it will certainly support your weight. I can stand in mine decently, but only when I am okay with a swim, just in case.   Another option that is harder to find and you probably haven't heard of is the vibe slipjack 90.   This is the best looking and rated boat I have found in the price range and the weight range. It does show a weight rating of 300, so it is borderline, but it's not like the boat instantly sinks if you go over a few pounds. That same company also has some larger options for a little more money and they look like phenomenal boats from what I can see. They have a couple locations in that region, so you might be able to swing by their shop and see what they have.   If possible, go paddle a few boats. It is hard to get that option with the retails stores though. On occasion, one of the vendors will do parking lot demos at the retail stores so you can try out the boats that store sells. The kayak shops that sell the higher-end boats, usually have rentals and options to try out different demo-boats. Also, if you're patient, you can sometimes buy a used demo-boat cheap at the end of the season, which is coming up in the next few months, depending on your area. You can generally knock a few hundred dollars off a really good boat, that has only been paddled a dozen times, if you're lucky enough to get one. Talk to your local shops and see what they have to offer.    Good luck making your decision and happy paddling."
kayakfishing,3dej0w,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:56:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sold on the whole standing in the kayak... i have no intentions on standing till i drop at least another 35 pounds ish. The main thing that drew me to this one is all the reviews talk about how stable it is on the water. so my thoughts are even if i never stand and i hook a 30 pound channel cat i shouldn't flip the kayak.
kayakfishing,3dej0w,Bubba_Gump_Shrimp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:09:47 2015 UTC,"I am currently about 260 and I have no concern of flipping any fishing kayaks like these while sitting. At least when not in moving water. I dont think that will be an issue at all. It will help if you keep the rod in front of you, so the leverage of the pole is in line with the boat. Hanging the rod way off to the side gives the fish the advantage of leverage.   I like to sit sideways with my feet in the water on my moken while I fish. Even while doing that, I have no concern of tipping."
kayakfishing,3dej0w,vdubgti18t,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:21:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, and if you dont want to stand, I wouldn't get the striker. That is the big attraction for that boat. I would suggest to get a boat equipped with a good seat instead. If it were me."
kayakfishing,3ddaze,spacedtrav,2,Wed Jul 15 11:08:10 2015 UTC,"Try to find sheltered areas to fish.  Paddle into the wind then fish back so you aren't struggling to get back at the end of the trip.  10 isn't too bad,  20 is bad for a beginner and depending on where you are."
kayakfishing,3ddaze,Mightbehittingonyou,2,Wed Jul 15 14:50:47 2015 UTC,Hell yeah I'd go.  Grab an anchor or a pole with a rope and hang out!  I'd go fishing if a damn hurricane was coming!

kayakfishing,3ddaze,Austinist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:36:32 2015 UTC,Depends a lot on your boat and the size and shape of the body of water.  In a Hobie ProAngler or Slayer Propel on a river or normal size lake you should be fine.  On one of the Great Lakes or the sea there could be too much chop or current to paddle safely in a smaller boat.
kayakfishing,3ddaze,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would go in certain water. small bodies of water are probably fine. Big bodies of water can get ugly in a hurry with high winds. Plus, fishing is difficult in high wind. If you can stay sheltered in a cove or something, it might be worth a shot. You need to be prepared for things to go bad, just in case things do go bad."

kayakfishing,3dam8v,HydraYak,3,Tue Jul 14 20:08:33 2015 UTC,I use these a lot. I have a sabiki rod and the combination of rigs and rod are fantastic. It keeps all those tiny hooks from being out on deck which is a huge deal on a kayak.

kayakfishing,3dam8v,UFEngi88,2,Wed Jul 15 19:07:08 2015 UTC,I use a Folgers Coffee can (red plastic). But they rust quickly if there are left in the can and not cleaned off soon after use.
kayakfishing,3dam8v,bpc87,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:16 2015 UTC,They're almost impossible to untangle once you've take the tension of the weight or main line off. I can reuse the same rig if I keep it on the same pole and leave the weight attached. Usually designate a cheap rod and reel as my 'sabiki rig.'

kayakfishing,3d54mt,drum_lorder,3,Mon Jul 13 16:30:27 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for post my blog! I use it quite a bit still for my smaller sit inside kayaks. Perfect for crappy minnows or live crawfish. I've also used it for blueback herring but only in the cooler months. The water heats up too fast in the dead of summer in such a small and black container.
kayakfishing,3d54mt,HydraYak,2,Tue Jul 14 20:07:13 2015 UTC,No problem! I really liked this design and your blog. I was looking for something that I could keep on my kayak which would be cheap and where I could easily do quick water changes for the bait. I hope you don't mind if I pick your brain with a few questions: Have you made any modifications to your original design? And what would you recommend to someone who is thinking about building something similar?
kayakfishing,3d54mt,HydraYak,2,Tue Jul 14 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"No real modifications... I've added more velcro to the bottom and to the lid.  I chose the oil pan because it was flat and round(ish). Flat, because i wanted a small tank that could be mounted (velcro'd) to the deck of a sit-inside kayak. Something good for 4-6 hours of live bait from a kayak. A tall tank would cause the yak to be tippy. So it had to be flat to lower the center of gravity to retain stability. Round(ish) because I heard that some baitfish will stack up in a corner and suffocate. So in a round tank, with no corners, they swim in a circle. Start with a cheap container... as cheap as possible. The oil pan drain was under $10 at walmart. The pump is just a cheapo water pump from a hardware store. The water pump helps to lower the water temperature and flush pollutants without moving the tank. This buys your bait a few more hours before they get fatigued and/or die. A guy once recommended to use a cotton ball trap to filter fish scales out of the water. The pump will get some of the scales but not all. As the bait stresses out, they can loose scales which clutters the water and can get caught in the gills causing further stress.   The name of the game is ""live bait"" for as long as possible in a small container. I can get 4-6 hours in cooler temps (fall through spring). Georgia summers get hot and i might be able to get a few hours out of a dozen blueback herring (striper/bass). Also, the top layer of lake water can be warmer and contain more pollutants... so when you cycle water into the tank from the pump, it could have chemicals in it (like fuel from boats). But saltwater, off the beach, it's great. The water out past the surf is cool and you can use the tank to stash sabiki caught bait as you go! It's a game changer. The tank flushes out better in the ocean for sure.   Here's a vid where I'm using the tank in Pensacola - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AxERKebBOw Sabiki'd up bait, stashed in the tank, caught a cobia."

Silicon the bubble stone inside the bottom of the cooler, drill a hole in the side to run your tubing, and mount the little pump on the outside with a couple screws.

kayakfishing,3d2lae,TehWadeski,2,Mon Jul 13 02:23:52 2015 UTC,My apologies tried to post something I guess it did not work. This is a dry dog food storage container that I got from Tractor Supply. There were two sizes this was the smaller of the two. I have ordered to Scotty rod holders to put on this as well and not sure what else I will do to it but I was just excited to finally find something to fit back there.
kayakfishing,3d2lae,TehWadeski,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:28:25 2015 UTC,Looks Nice. I've been interested in putting a fish finder on my talon and mounting the transducer through one of the scupper holes.
kayakfishing,3d2lae,Far-Aim,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:51:10 2015 UTC,Me as well I was thinking a thru hull transducer any reason you werent?
kayakfishing,3d2lae,Bamness,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:21 2015 UTC,"Hey I know this is an older post, but I have a lowrance on my talon12. Originally had the ducer mounted through hull. It worked, but not well. There was always a big echo mark on the scope, and it got so bad sometimes that the unit would start to rescan, like, a lot...think every half a second. Temp readings were way off too and it was useless at 83hz. Could only be used at 200hz. Yesterday I mounted it on the stern and it's solved all the issues I had before.   TL;DR: it's easy to mount through hull, but it may give you problems."
kayakfishing,3d2lae,georgiaredfish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:02:51 2015 UTC,I remember seeing a yiutube where a guy turned a tuff tote from Walmart into a great back crate with pole holders.  I will see if i can find it later

kayakfishing,3d04zl,BronsonBuster,3,Mon Jul 13 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"It took me a lot of work and tweaking. The key for me was getting the spoon about 30 feet out behind the torpedo weight. Then once down 40-80 feet, I had enough separation from the boat to stay stealthy."
kayakfishing,3d04zl,BronsonBuster,3,Mon Jul 13 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"So funny thing is I posted a 12 pound brown on here from a few days ago, and my torpedo was up maybe six feet lol.  I think water clarity affects how far you need to setup ahead of your spoon.  I did some looking and talked to some friends about it and they said 30-50 feet.  Doh.  At least I know in murky water I can run closer."
kayakfishing,3d04zl,kangarooiguess,3,Mon Jul 13 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"That's a nice brown. I usually am too busy to chase them in deep water, but when I have, just couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting hits when clearly the bite was on. Thinking this is a nice turning point for me on the water. Now to figure out flashers and flies."

kayakfishing,3cyzni,Nymphis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:43:05 2015 UTC,Very slow day and was out solo.  Still nice to be on the water and not at work ^  Seems the evening bite is producing more mahi and big king while the morning bite is showing more tarpon (if you get them early before they move further out) and schooling kings.

One hand, three rules got applied to my buddy: before you drink, you have to lick your glass; if anyone says ""Pat Green"" he had to drink; AND the next rule was a lifetime long rule. He walks to the jeep, gets a Pat Green CD and puts it in, sets a 30 pack next to him and said ""Bring it.""  Flash forward to 2 years later, he's at a wedding in Kansas City. His aunt, whom he hadn't seen in years, walks up to him and says ""Pat Green!!!"" He licks and swigs. ""Holy.. I can't believe it worked!"" and she walked away.   Last year, we went and saw Pat Green. Talked to his road crew and tried to get him to say ""Hey, [Friend], Me."" But failed.

kayakfishing,3cr7vo,NinjaSporkParty,2,Fri Jul 10 14:00:43 2015 UTC,"That is a beautiful catch! Must have been a fun fight on the yak.   As a fellow kayak angler I urge caution using grippers with trout, as they can cause  internal contusions that are fatal to the fish.  I didn't know any better until the fine folks at /r/flyfishing set me straight on the proper catch and release methods for trout.  Since you released the fish you may find this article helpful. It specifically covers trout catch and release.    http://www.trophytroutguide.com/articles/cpr.htm  Tight lines.  Keep 'm wet."
kayakfishing,3cpana,Kaseymiles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"Basically you are deciding between metal and hard rubber/plastic. I have the plastic ones, and have never had any issues with them, as the metal ones tend to be a bit more expensive. I was going to buy them online and install them myself, but my local kayak shop did the install for less than $10 so I just let them handle it. All told I think I paid $30 for two 12"" gear tracks installed. I have a Jackson Coosa for reference.   I use mine for my rod holders and for my fishfinder mount. I really like that nothing is permanently fixed on there, and I can adjust the placement of my holders as needed."

Plenty or space to move around with decent storage options.   Never been a fan of the 2 piece kayak. I've had 2 Apex's crack at the seam and sink in the bay. This sucker is sitting up high out the water. It will definitely catch a good amount of wind.   Might be a decent beginner kayak for small lakes or rivers.

kayakfishing,3cest6,awhit147,2,Tue Jul 7 10:22:26 2015 UTC,was just out there this past weekend. Water was perfect
kayakfishing,3cest6,walker_texas_rangers,2,Tue Jul 7 12:37:34 2015 UTC,"So your deck space seems plenty spacious for a 50-60lb dog. Is it stable enough for her though? Did your yak have the some or all of the issues that come up in reviews for the boat (leaks, etc.)? Is that seat stock, upgradeable, or modified?  While I know a perfect kayak for all of your needs do not exist, I am still trying to find the as-perfect-as-I-can-get kayak."
kayakfishing,3cest6,thenatureboy_,2,Tue Jul 7 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I have the same boat. As far as issues mentioned in reviews, the only thing I've had an issue with is its size. It's VERY stable, probably just fine for a bigger dog. I've had mine that's about 35lbs in it and she was no issue. The issue with size comes in to play when you're trying not to drift too much, but there's always anchors to help combat that I guess.  As far as leaks, I've never had any issues. I did pull all the hatches off and re-seal them with waterproof sealant just in case though because water does build up on top of the deck as you're paddling and fishing.   Seat is standard with the one in OP's picture and it's awesome. Super comfy, swivels 360*, and you can raise it or lower it depending how you wanna be oriented in the boat. I'd highly recommend this yak to anyone really looking to get into kayak fishing but not wanting to break the bank. I've had mine for about 2 years now and really enjoy it."
kayakfishing,3cest6,ROAR_BEAR,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"Well after this weekend I can definitely attest to its stability. I got stuck in a pretty nasty storm while paddling back to my car. Surf was probably 2 feet high and coming over the side of the yak. Even though I was about to shit my pants in the impromptu hurricane, I was really impressed at the stability. Before the storm hit I spent most of the morning standing up on the deck and fishing with no problems. I'm not exactly dainty either.  I haven't had any problems with leaks. The seat is awesome just the way it is. I'm sure you could modify it if you wanted to, but I haven't found a reason to. It's one of my favorite features, especially the ability to turn 360Â°."

kayakfishing,3cbzvn,F3nom3ni,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:43:13 2015 UTC,I probably should have been a little more clear. The mounting kit itself is probably universal but different transducers are different sizes and not all will fit perfectly.  I've got a tarpon 160 and the grooves underneath my yak are too thin for me to fit my transducer.
kayakfishing,3cbzvn,OmwToGallifrey,2,Tue Jul 7 00:54:35 2015 UTC,It's the same for the tarpon 120. The lowrance transducer is too wide.

kayakfishing,3cbdpk,DTEII,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"I have a bass yaks kit on my wildy Tarpon and let me just first say I LOVE It and I'm sure you will too. Basically, your steering is exactly the same as with using a rudder. Your feet control turning which to me is the best part aside from having reverse. You want to pick up a minn kota mounting bracket which is what will hold the motor back at the Stern of the boat. For a larger yak like yours I would recommend a 40 or 45# thrust motor and if you fish the salt, it is crucial to make sure that you buy a saltwater trolling motor. Once you're ready to pull the trigger lmk and I'll supply you with the pics of my setup. It really isn't too complicated. The added bonus is you can remove it in 10 seconds when not needed. Post your setup once you finish and good luck! Hope this helped!"

One useful thing to use with your trolley is a drift chute, which are very lightweight and easy to use. If you want to rig up am anchor you don't need one any heavier than a 2 lb folding anchor.  I have mine attached to a short length of chain to help it grab the bottom, and the whole thing is tied to a scuba divers reel so I have a convenient way to let out the line and store it when not in use."

kayakfishing,3c83ar,Augraham,2,Sun Jul 5 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"Demo, demo, and demo. I'm sure many people will agree with that statement. I had read reviews that were for the most part very good and decided to buy without going for a demo. I ended up with a kayak that many people like and one that I hated. In my opinion the inability to demo the ones at the big box store is an idea how much of a gamble it is to buy from a big box store. Many people buy from them and they are pleased. I'm similar to your sized and my built in cushion, if you know what I mean, does not do well with the small pads for a seat. I demoed several brands and styles. I ended up going with a Wilderness Systems Ride 135. I felt that it was a step above the rest. I tried about 6-8 different boats. The stability and the AirPro Max seat was what sold me on the Ride. My Ride was a couple hundred dollars more than your budget and could possibly be found lightly used in your area. Just be sure to try before you buy or you may regret your decision. Hope this helps and good luck."

It's 13 foot so you can use it in open water and most rivers if you wanted. Tracks wonderfully and comes fully loaded with seat rod holders supper plugs paddle and a rudder for 800. Mkst other things in this proce range will come with two or three rod holders and if you want a rudder system its gonna cost another 200 or so. I went to the warehouse and met the owners and cannot recommend them enough. It is a relatively small company and they will help and talk you through a purchase. In my opinion there is nothing out there as equally outfitted for that price. I love this thing.

kayakfishing,3c83ar,aaronbengo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"Well every person, outside of reddit, where I could identify them has been a dealer if they are repping the Sea Ghost.  I've seen them recommend the Sea Ghost for people who want to stand and fish, even though you can tell by looking at the hull design it's meant more for speed than stability."
kayakfishing,3c83ar,Austinist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:48:29 2015 UTC,There are plenty of boats not necessarily designed for standing that you definitely can stand and fish from. I have no problem standing and fishing in the sea ghost and boats of similar design. With a 33 inch beam it is extremely stable.
kayakfishing,3c83ar,Austinist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:44:13 2015 UTC,"I can too, but I'm an experienced kayaker as I assume you are.  The fact is the OP put standing as one of his requirements and that's arguably the weakest point for that hull shape and deck style."
kayakfishing,3c83ar,Austinist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"First off, you need to understand that generally the stability of a kayak comes at a penalty in speed.  There are many different examples of this compromise on the market.  I own a Jackson Big Rig, which is about the most-stable kayak on the market.   Diablo Kayaks makes the Adios and the Amigo, which are also very stable.   You will pay the price for this stability when paddling, especially into a headwind.  These kayaks can be up to 30-40% slower than less-stable, faster boats.    In your budget, I think your best bet is either a used Diablo or a new Ascend fs128t.  The Ascend line can be seen in-person at a  Bass Pro Shop.   Also keep in mind, with more time in a kayak you will become more-comfortable standing and have better balance, so you can move to a faster, less-stable kayak and cover more water."

kayakfishing,3bza3o,djm87us_,2,Fri Jul 3 10:35:45 2015 UTC,"Congrats. My advice is to keep your seat in the high position all the time. As a big guy who would flip over his Jackson Coosa alot, I can say that there is almost never a reason to have the seat in the low position. It is sooo stable that you just don't need to concern yourself with stability at all.  Enjoy your Big Rig!"
kayakfishing,3bza3o,Wonkadonkathon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:14:30 2015 UTC,I use the low position a lot to get to my fishing spot because it makes the big rig much easier to paddle. I can get a much longer paddle stroke compared to the high position. But as soon as I start fishing the first thing I do is switch to the high seat position.
kayakfishing,3bza3o,Black_Lab,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you might benefit from a slightly longer paddle. 230cm is the minimum for most of the new boats in the 32""+ width range."
kayakfishing,3bza3o,Peevedkitten,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:11:34 2015 UTC,I am using a 260 so I really can't go any longer. Simple science...when I am closer to the water I can reach farther forward and my paddle can spend more time in the water creating thrust. The big rig is a heavy boat so it takes a lot to get it moving. I do paddle mine upriver a lot and for that situation the low seat position is a must. Also on windy days when paddling more than a few hundred feet I will move down to the low position and it makes a big difference.
kayakfishing,3bza3o,Black_Lab,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:17:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're completely right. I just wasn't sure, I've seen several people in wide boats with extremely undersized paddles.

kayakfishing,3bza3o,Peevedkitten,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:58:27 2015 UTC,I love mine but it is a beast to paddle. The first thing I would recommend is to add a sleeve to the anchor tube because the anchor line will start to wear through the plastic tube immediately. I went to lowes and picked up some copper crimp sleeves then super glued them into each end of the tube and it works great now. I use my anchor a lot and have not had a problem with it other than that.

I had a mad frog liberator before and prefer the ram by far. We fish a lot of kelp and i can leave the ram mount loose and it will just swing back when i run into kelp or the beach. I actually land with it down quite often.

I had originally thought about purchasing the stabilizer bar, but decided not to buy it after I became accustom to the kayak. I can fish standing up from my 135 with ease. I would imagine the 115 is even better. The Phase 3 seat is comfortable, but once you have saved the money the AirPro Max would be my first priority. I absolutely love mine. I fish 3-5 times a week and I'm never uncomfortable. Hope this helps. I'm hoping to make some videos soon of my 135 and maybe that will help you."

Just attach the carabiners to the pulleys on the front and back handles, and run the cord the length of the kayak and back, and tie the two ends to the steel ring.   Pretty east to do, and easily removable if you don't want it anymore. After time the cord stretches, and you may want to replace it with new cord, buy cord is pretty cheap!"

kayakfishing,3bwsqc,elmonoblanco,3,Thu Jul 2 23:00:45 2015 UTC,"Ok so this is my yak:   http://www.clearwaterleisure.com/products-1/affinity.html  Sit on Top vs Sit In. Fishermen prefer sit-on-top. Period. You basically see zero sit ins here. Mine above is technically a sit-in, but that picture makes it look way more ""in"" than it is. Basically you want your legs getting sun.   Longer kayaks are faster kayaks. They also track better (less effected by current, more economic to paddle). They also turn a lot worse, weigh a lot more, take up a lot more space, and are more of a pain in the ass.   Oh, and theyre a shitload more expensive.   Unless youre going in the ocean, or going long distances, go as short as you can. Personally im using the above one and its an 8'6"", which is more or less a small adult sized yak. Im 6' 210, its no problem.   With the longer yaks you get more storage -- but you cant reach it from your seat. You gotta pull up to shore and dismount. Im in an 8'6"" and I can barely reach stuff, and definitely cant reach all stuff. So anyone saying storage is a reason to buy a longer yak is a fool. Its really only useful if youre kayak-camping.  Look at the front and back storage areas. look at mine, in the rear there -- avoid that. It sucks. That area fills with water and its just a giant puddle splashing down my ass all day. Make sure that area has a drain or isnt gonna hold water. Your paddle splashes into it. constantly.   Make sure you have enough space to fit a milk crate in the back. Milk Crates are the king for a reason too.  Again on mine that area in the back was too deep and my milk crate didnt fit well. I had to attach some pvc legs on to my crate... which is no big deal.  Honestly, dont go spending 700 bucks on your first yak. Really... really dont. Find one, sit on top, not too long, on sale for 250ish."
kayakfishing,3bwsqc,greenmen88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"Some good advice here,  you definitely want a sit on top.   Just so much easier to get in and out &  easier to fish from. Did you check the Madison Craigslist?"
kayakfishing,3bwsqc,Peevedkitten,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"i have a Old Town Angler and if you're going river fishing it'll do ya but I agree with a sit on top all the way after my experiences of having my legs locked forward while twisting to cast/reel/net fish on lakes.  If I were to do it over again I'd likely do a sit on top and I may even take it up a notch with the versions that have the chairs sitting another 4"" or so off the deck.  Regardless, some presentations aren't things you'll try when you're that close to the water. My recommendation is that you get a yak that can carry two rods and a net, after that it's up to you.  The milk crates are great if you like to bring a lot of stuff but I typically just bring one waterproof box (b/c it'll float if i flip) with what I think I'll use that day.  Otherwise beer fits anywhere, stringers tie to the side, everything else gets attached to the life jacket.  Make sure you budget for a paddle b/c they do tend to cost more than one would hope."

kayakfishing,3br5py,drum_lorder,7,Wed Jul 1 14:10:32 2015 UTC,"Sunblock, a hat and pants. I have been cooked so many times on salt water. Also a cheap stake out pole helps. I normally use 6'-7' rods with 2500 spinners with 10-20 lb braid inshore. Watch the tide and wind and bring extra water to drink. Salt water is also hell on all your gear but its totally worth it. http://imgur.com/augGCX8 http://imgur.com/dlSHIwB  bait; shrimp, berkley gulps and pinfish work well under a cajun thunder."

I usually don't bring a net and if the fish is too big i drag him to the nearest oyster bar so i can stand up and get a hold of him. I'm in Florida and we have a lot of black drum 40-80lbs and i don't have any problems

kayakfishing,3br5py,aCause4Concern,5,Thu Jul 2 00:13:46 2015 UTC,"South Florida inshore guy here -   Here's a good resource for you:  http://www.tides4fishing.com/us/north-carolina   Simply put - the sun and moon are the biggest influence on when you should go out. Tides make water move, water moves baitfish, predation happens.  What to bring?  I like a 7' MH rod and baitcaster reel as my all-purpose equipment.  Baits and tackle might vary in NC from what I'm used to down here, but spoons, jig heads tipped with dead shrimp, and topwater (walk the dog spooks) are good fun. Keepers always go on board in a cooler - leave that stringer at home.  When you're done, it's vital that you give all your gear a freshwater rinse and re-lube.  Salt is murder on everything."
kayakfishing,3br5py,kleptican,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"That's a great website. Thank you for that. I have a baitcaster on a MH rod too, so I'll try that rigged out for saltwater. What type of line do you like to use? I was thinking 20lb braided with a leader line."
kayakfishing,3br5py,Bland251,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"20lb braided with a leader line.   Sounds just about right to me.  You could go lighter, but I like to get a fish in quick before he's too tired -or sharkbait.   I go heavier on my leader for durability with toothy/sharp gilled fish and oyster beds , and like flouro for invisibility."
kayakfishing,3br5py,echocall2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"I concur with aCause4Concern on the heavier leader. I fish the beach in South Florida as well and I have used 80lb mono as my leader (not on my lures, just when using cut bait)."
kayakfishing,3br5py,BoatlessAngler,2,Wed Jul 1 19:37:49 2015 UTC,"There has been some really good advice thus far. I like to use a Yakattak visi-pole with a flag to help me be more visible. If I can share one piece of advice with you it is to be sure and wash your equipment off with some good freshwater after your trip. Saltwater will severely take its toll on equipment not intended for saltwater. However, don't be afraid to use your freshwater equipment. I use my bass fishing gear for all of my inshore fishing."

kayakfishing,3bp4cx,SirTrout,2,Wed Jul 1 12:22:23 2015 UTC,Supposedly the superstition goes back to when there was importation of bananas by the boatload. Well they used to cut the bananas in a bunch and put them on board with venomous spiders hidden within. They would eventually end up biting and getting sailors sick and die. Then there were revolts of captains forbidding the transportation of bananas. I don't know why this didn't make the bananas prices skyrocket.
kayakfishing,3bpkkm,the_brizzler,2,Wed Jul 1 03:07:41 2015 UTC,"Hobie owner here.  You're pretty much limited to Native or Hobie if you want pedal drive.  They are the two biggest pedal drive manufacturers.  Native makes the propeller systems, and Hobie makes the fins.    The Native propeller lets you pedal backward.  The Hobie gets less tangled in weeds and is (reportedly) easier to pedal for long distances.  They're about the same speed.  Both have pros and cons, and both are very nice.    They both have a variety of yaks that will cost, on average, well above $1,000.  The high end for these kayaks is about $3,000.  There's everything in between.    Edit: for an ocean kayak you'll want a low profile yak with good primary stability.  If you look at Hobies, check out the Revolution."
kayakfishing,3bpkkm,qfor,2,Wed Jul 1 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much covered it. Pedal yaks start at $2000 new, $1500 for a used Revo if you luck."

kayakfishing,3bpkkm,Peevedkitten,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"I just sold my outback and bought a native slayer propel 13. I fish 99.9% salt (went to a lake once last year out of 160 day on the water) I have flipped the outback before, I've seen a slayer ride a 4-5 wave in sideways on a bad landing and not flip. It's a serious fishing machine and the reverse is great when you're hunting rock piles and pinnacles in open water."
kayakfishing,3bpkkm,Peevedkitten,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:06:20 2015 UTC,That sounds pretty beastly. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation

The slayer let's you just hold your position and fish every inch even in strong wind and current."

kayakfishing,3bn4kj,goatnapper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:36 2015 UTC,After searching for a 12 foot Pescador all year I was lucky enough to find this one at my local West Marine.  It was the floor model and had been there since 2012 so I talked the manager down and got it for $419 after tax!  I have added about $150 of rigging and another $300 on fishing gear (started from nothing)  I LOVE this yak.

kayakfishing,3bn4kj,goatnapper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:17:12 2015 UTC,How so? He paid an extra $20 (probably all tax) and didn't have to pay shipping.
kayakfishing,3bn4kj,iamzombus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:39 2015 UTC,Paying the same for a three year old floor model?
kayakfishing,3bn4kj,jtioannou,3,Tue Jun 30 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"How much really changed on them in the last three years? It looks the exact same as mine from last year. Being the floor model means people touched it and maybe got some drool on it, nothing a quick wash couldn't get off.  Around where I live, he could toss it on Craigslist and sell it at a profit just walking out the store with what he paid."
kayakfishing,3bn4kj,goatnapper,-4,Tue Jun 30 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"Still. It's a three year old floor model you're paying the same price for a new one.  New vs. Old for the same money, I'd take new."
kayakfishing,3bn4kj,davewinkwink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:25:41 2015 UTC,3 questions. 1) do you eat sheepshead? 2) how do they taste? 3) if the crate is behind you how do you get to and see which equipment you are grabbing/need without straining and twisting 180Â°?
kayakfishing,3bn4kj,moose0ntehloose,3,Wed Jul 1 02:09:01 2015 UTC,"You only have to twist 90Â° to see the crate (humans have 180Â° vision).  I do almost the same setup (even have my anchor in the same place in PVC).  You get to know where things are, so you can reach behind without even looking and pull it out.  The anchor cleat is on the left side, hence the anchor goes on the left side of the crate, and I just reach back with my left hand.  I have pockets on my vest for my tackle, so I'm only using the crate when I want a new bottle of water or a snack."
kayakfishing,3bn4kj,_Duskyyy,2,Wed Jul 1 02:34:48 2015 UTC,No I don't eat anything I catch on this river. There are many old grain elevators and it has a lot of chemical runoffs.  As for the crate it is directly behind my lower back so I press my weight against the foot pedals and just kind of turn around. I have no problem accessing it and seeing what I'm doing.
kayakfishing,3bnwbo,_Duskyyy,3,Tue Jun 30 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Don't skimp on a good padded seat. I had sore back issues on my pescador 12 until I spent $90 on a decent seat. Can't remember which one, but to ng thru amazon and reading the reviews you can find a good one that will suit you"

kayakfishing,3bnwbo,ThunderCows,2,Tue Jun 30 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"I've advocated comfort above all else when it comes to boats. There are some foam seat cushions that adhere directly to the plastic molding and consider a third party seat upgrade. Lastly, consider a small inflatable pillow to provide lower lumbar support. Take a peak at the Jackson Kayak 2.0 or WS Airpro max style seats and see if you can jerry rig any of those to fit in your boat."

kayakfishing,3bnwbo,goatnapper,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"OK, so you might be a bit big for that kayak, but probably not. Maybe to long for it, but that wouldn't bother your back and ass.  Unfortunately, with the mid and low end kayaks, one place the skimp is the seat.  I agree with others, try a seat upgrade.  I had an old style big game prowler that killed my ass and back. Only upgrading to a lure 11.5 made it stop. Now I'm in an atak and there are nearly no issues... I was just too ""festively plump"" for the big game prowler"
kayakfishing,3bnwbo,WheelsAndGears,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'4 230, it should fit him fine (works fine for me, doubt an extra 20 lbs and inch of height makes much difference).  I actually skipped several other kayaks in the $400-600 range because I wanted one that could fit me.  I usually take my butt hurting as my cue to take a break and head back to shore, but I've also heard of people adding padding or using an inflatable pad."
kayakfishing,3bnwbo,blatherdrift,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:22:02 2015 UTC,"Although I do agree with the fact that a good seat might help, you may be the other issue. Many people do not relax properly in a kayak. They may stay tense because they worry they are unsteady and going to flip. Others will get stiff due to a bad paddle stroke.  My advice is to spend a little time in the boat making sure you are comfortable and relaxed. You should be able to move your hips and upper body separately. You may also want to get a little instruction, even if it's just youtube videos, on a proper paddle stroke.   But yes, a good seat is generally a great investment too."
kayakfishing,3bnwbo,baconrobber,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this as well, I'll watch some videos and see if that improves my comfort level. Gonna snag a new seat here soon as well."

kayakfishing,3bnwbo,JCuc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"Remember that kayaking is a physical activity and after your 1st time doing any type of physical exercise you can be a little sore or uncomfortable. I am also a large guy (6â4â, 265lbs) and am familiar with those beginnerâs pains that come with stuffing yourself in a small boat for hours. Like jogging when you havenât done so for a while is it difficult and your body aches afterward. With kayaking you use your core muscles for most of the movements on the water, or at least you should for a more efficient paddle stroke and to avoid injury. This could be a source of your pain. I suggest strengthening the abdominal and back muscles to decrease fatigue on the water. Of course a comfortable seat is important as well. With the combination of both you will notice the difference in your kayak fishing trips."

kayakfishing,3bjtpc,orphanboyk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:55:29 2015 UTC,I'll plan on fishing mostly lakes with maybe some small rivers. Are 10' yaks inherently bad?
kayakfishing,3bjtpc,Mightbehittingonyou,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"No.  Longer boats track better, are faster, and draft shallower.  Shorter boats are more maneuverable and are lighter/easier to transport.  Every boat is a compromise, figure out what's most important to you.  Striker is more appealing to me, but I really dislike Ascends in general."
kayakfishing,3bjtpc,orphanboyk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"I have 2 Tarpon 100's and love them, I think they work well because  Wilderness Systems makes top quality kayaks. My very first kayak was a 10 foot Pelican and it was tragic, I wouldn't even let my kids ride it because it was too unsafe. I agree with everything Mightbehittingonyou said- the longer boats have a bit more room and track a little better, just watch out for the weight creep. I don't have an opinion on either brand but paddling.net has great reviews and are usually accurate.    http://www.paddling.net/Reviews/"
kayakfishing,3bjtpc,tweakerlime,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:36:16 2015 UTC,Very helpful thanks. Stupid question but what exactly is tracking?
kayakfishing,3bjtpc,jodom29,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:42:05 2015 UTC,"Tracking is how straight the kayak paddles.  Shorter kayaks tend to ""waddle"" more when you paddle and oftentimes can go completely offtrack depending on how good or bad the tracking is.  For example, I  rented a smaller (about 9 or 10') kayak to paddle and it was an absolute nightmare to get from point A to point B.  Now, I have a longer kayak that goes precisely where I want it to go, and it  makes for a much less exhausting/frustrating day on the water."
kayakfishing,3bjtpc,jodom29,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:15:48 2015 UTC,Just recently sold my ascend d10t and bought a striker. Best decision I've ever made. The striker is actually a lot easier for me to manage. I had bought an ascend cart for the d10t but it didn't fit in the scupper holes. It works great for the striker. The striker is faster and more stable than the ascend. Also tracks a lot better too. Which doesn't seem like it'd be a problem but it definitely makes it a lot easier to fish. Any questions just ask.

kayakfishing,3bcdxh,BrockSamson708,3,Sat Jun 27 21:56:48 2015 UTC,"The side bungies are a paddle holder. You wrap the bungie over the paddle and secure it on the small catch.  The back hatch is for whatever storage you might need, although I will say your stern storage hatch is not a place to put something you are definitely going to need during your trip as accessing it can be difficult."

I have two different floats I could put you on but I'd suggest having someone with you incase anything happend. One is from the city park down to knife works on Highway 66. It's about a 6-7 hour float depending on how hard you fish it. And the other is from the dam to knife works and depending on generation schedule it is approximately the same length.

Only two mods I would undertake.  1: Add a hand bilge pump, they are not self bailing. 2: Raise the seat. You loose a tiny bit of stability, but if things get real hairy, just sit on the deck.   See if I can dig up my seat mod pics for you."

kayakfishing,3b9i6f,the_howlermonkey,3,Sat Jun 27 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the types of water you fish. Smaller bodies of water with the occasional larger body, then I would say the 115. If you fish a lot of open water I would consider the 135. I don't think you will be disappointed with either. I considered the Jackson's, but I'm so glad I went with Wilderness Systems. Don't let the over hang be an issue. If you get the 135 and there is more hanging over than you are comfortable with than you can buy a bed extender fairly cheap. If you do purchase the 115, I would consider looking at the 115x max if at all possible. The removable pod looks to be invaluable."
kayakfishing,3b9i6f,Bland251,2,Sat Jun 27 04:45:02 2015 UTC,I have the 135. it's big. you need it if you plan on being out in open water a lot. otherwise go with the smaller boat.
kayakfishing,3b9i6f,blatherdrift,2,Sat Jun 27 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"Like the others have said, it really depends on the type of water you will be on. I had a ride 115 and it took me forever to paddle across a big windy lake. If I was doing it all the time then I would definitely lean towards a bigger yak.   As for transportation and storage these are both bigger heavier boats, I believe there is only 6 lbs difference between the two. Both boats are great, have lots of room and will support you and your gear.  Another option to consider might be the Frontier 12, this is the reason I sold my 115. The Frontier is much more stable than the 115 if standing is important to you. The way I figured it, both boats were roughly the same weight and length and the Frontier allowed me to bring a buddy or both kids if the situation required it. Dont get me wrong I like the ride 115 and still have 2 Tarpon 100's but I just wanted a bit more flexibility. I also fish a lot of smaller lakes where sight fishing and stretching your legs is more important then a long paddle.  Good luck."
kayakfishing,3b9i6f,orphanboyk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:32:00 2015 UTC,"I am torn between Tarpon 120 (just demoed a Craigslist guy's and it was great, fully rigged too), a Ride 115, and a Frontier 10.   The Ride is on sale by me $200 off, new. Hard beat. I am just scared I won't be able to manhandle it and get on the roof rack easily. Also, I was told they can't be J-cradled because it's too wide. Would love to know if you did that with yours."
kayakfishing,3b9i6f,thenatureboy_,2,Sat Jun 27 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"Do yakkers in your area ride shorter yaks? In my area (coastal SC), everyone paddles 14 or larger. I am 6' 185 and had a Ride 135 and a Tarpon 14. A lot of recreational yakkers paddle super long daggers. Most fishermen are on 12-14 footers. I currently paddle a 14 food tandem Feel Free Corona.  If the other yakkers in your area tend toward 10-12 foot yaks, that might be the way to go. I figure if the people with more experience than me are choosing a certain size, unless it takes more skill to deal with that size, that's what I am getting."

kayakfishing,3b61em,mrhodes667,2,Fri Jun 26 06:55:33 2015 UTC,"Hi. Fellow Revo rider here. I bought a pair of Sidekick AMAS years ago and have hardly used them. They have 3 positions, high, medium and low. Low position they are in contact with the water, but the extra drag kills the efficiency of the boat.  Medium is about 4-5"" off the water, alright for sailing. High position sit about 10+"" off the water. At that point they aren't going to do to awful much. The questionof stability vs speed is fairly straight forward. Adding surface area contact with water without adding power to the motor  (you) to off set the drag, it's all gonna be less efficent, slower..  Anecdotally, rolled my Revo once...still not sure how it happened. I have taken the boat in all sorts of crazy conditions.  The side kicks, the handful of times I used them,  were awkward, unwieldy...not worth the extra effort. I have spent enough time with this boat that I know when things might get tricky. It isn't often. I know that there is a ton of stability, way more than it feels like.   Hope that helps  been a long time Revo owner, you got questions...ask away.   The effort to type this all on a phone is too damn high."
kayakfishing,3b61em,Maine_Fluff_Chucker,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:20:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your knowledged response. Really appreciate that. So take home message is dont bother with the outrigger when out with the Revo 13 unless sailing. So for saltwater offshore, i take it you really enjoy the Revo. You wouldnt happen to have had experience between the application of the Revo 11 over the 13 for offshore yak fishing ? If you did, your experienced comment would be well appreciated :)"
kayakfishing,3b61em,Maine_Fluff_Chucker,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"Outriggers, I would pass. Put the money in a good marine radio if you are going off shore. That is a great lifeline to have.   I dont have any direct experience between the 11 and the 13. I understand all the features of the 13 are on the 11, just in a tighter package. I will say though, all things equal but length, a slightly longer boat will have better sea keeping characteristics (how it rides over waves and wakes), and be slightly more efficient going through the water(how hard you have to work to cover mileage). For me, the 13 with a sailing rudder and turbo fins all day long."
kayakfishing,3b5fuf,gm83,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:03:55 2015 UTC,"Check your area out on google earth. You can change the sat. image date(year) to find the best water clarity so you can see the bottom. You want to try and find some reefs, and general underwater structure like cuts and deep drains coming out of shallow water to target the fish(trout/reds) eating the bait fish and shrimp. Getting to those areas when the tide is falling from high to low is best because the water will be flowing out of those areas carrying bait with it.   Watch the birds and paddle strait to any area you see them feeding.  Work the grass lines and be slow and persistent.   Bottom line: You have to find the fish. That popping cork is like a dinner bell, but they can only hear it from so far away."
kayakfishing,3b5fuf,TrailChaser,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:08:38 2015 UTC,East side of Weedon Island south of Gandy on a high outgoing tide there is some great grass flats and holes. Also the passes some sort of fish most the time. The channel that leads to Riviera Bay can also be productive on a big falling tide.  I've been using whitebait recently that I castnet near the Weedon Island kayak launch. DOA shrimp should catch you something though and topwaters at least get a jack or lady fish to hit.

That said, I guarantee there are Tarpon running the beach down there.  Sabiki rig some bait and pitch it in front of them.  In terms of baits to use, I love the mullet colored Popa Dog for BIG trout, Tsunami shrimp for small trout, smaller Mirrodines for everything that swims."

The pompano is basically a tricked out pescador 120 by perception. All three are great yaks and the same three I was looking at when I bought one but I ended up with the pompano 120. I hope this helps.
kayakfishing,3b0k24,gm83,2,Thu Jun 25 02:23:19 2015 UTC,I just sold my Eagle Talon and bought a Pescador and I'm going to rig it up the way I want.  The seat in the Pescador is way better.
kayakfishing,3b0k24,SirTrout,2,Thu Jun 25 11:15:57 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI if you had planned on standing in the FS12T you will not be able to do that in the pescador, eagle talon or pompano.  they are still good boats though."
kayakfishing,3b0k24,robertdilbert,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:50:10 2015 UTC,What would be a good one to look at that u could stand in?
kayakfishing,3b0k24,robertdilbert,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"at $550?  a used wilderness system, native watercraft or Jackson.  I don't know any new boats you can stand in at that price, someone else may know though.  also, depending on how tall you are standing in any of these boats is still pretty sketchy.  I'm 6'4"" and can stand in my native slayer, but I'm not doing any fishing from it."
kayakfishing,3b0k24,ThunderCows,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:14:19 2015 UTC,For that price range a used Jackson Coosa or a WS Ride 115 if you are very good at negotiating/lucky. Anything longer/bigger and your price range will have to increase.
kayakfishing,3awf13,TheManliestChild,3,Wed Jun 24 01:20:09 2015 UTC,I'm trying to make the same decision at the moment. I went and had a look at them side by side the other day and the biggest difference is in the front hatch. The 14s front hatch is about 10 inches longer and 2 inches deeper. You also lose about 8 inches of length in the rear well. In the cock put you lose about 1 inch of length and 1 inch of width so it's pretty much the same. The 14 also has two more horizontal rod holders.   I'm going to go test them on the water either this weekend or the next. I can let you know how that goes if you want.
kayakfishing,3awf13,Moumar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:38:36 2015 UTC,Awesome. Your local shop lets you test before you buy?
kayakfishing,3awf13,Napaandy,5,Wed Jun 24 01:40:49 2015 UTC,do not buy before you peddle. Every reputable shop offers test rudes.

kayakfishing,3awf13,marvinthmartian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:02:21 2015 UTC,That's pretty awesome. I'll have to see if my local shop does that.
kayakfishing,3awf13,Multra,2,Wed Jun 24 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"PA12 owner here.    I think the storage difference is negligible, frankly, since they can both carry way more gear than you'll use on the water.  What's more relevant is the superior tracking you'll get with a PA14.  The PA has never been known for good tracking, and the PA12 is especially bad when I take my hand off the rudder.  The 2015 models included a skeg which should improve performance, but the old models obviously won't have it.  Think of it this way: PA14 = poor tracking.  PA12 = worse tracking.  You can always install a sailing rudder, which immensely improves the tracking I've heard.  However, even when raised the sailing rudder is exposed, so resting the PA flat on the ground will break it.    The flip side to having a PA14 is that car topping will quickly become a burden.  I'm 6'3"", 210 lbs, active military, and I'll tell you car-topping a PA14 will quickly lose its appeal.  It's heavy, awkward, prone to damaging your vehicle and/or itself if you drop it.    If you have a trailer, hands down the PA14 is the way to go.  If you don't, I'd strongly recommend looking at the PA12, since any Pro Angler is better than the one you can't/won't use because its too difficult to get in and out of the water."
kayakfishing,3ax55c,HydroponicPork,5,Wed Jun 24 05:24:03 2015 UTC,I recently upgraded to the Bending Branches Angler. I really enjoy it over my old paddle. I believe my old paddle was a Day Tripper.

kayakfishing,3ax55c,ThunderCows,2,Wed Jun 24 05:31:01 2015 UTC,"Choose a paddle based on your boat and paddle technique.   Wider boats 31""+ go with 240cm, especially for high elevated seats. Narrower boats go with a 220 or 230 based on your height.  High Angle vs Low Angle technique.   If you aggressively drive the blade into the water close to the boat at a deep angle go with a High angle paddle. These have broader/shorter blades and will get you the quick acceleration to compliment that paddle stroke.  If you're the latter, and prefer to dip the paddle away from the boat at a shallower angle go with a Low Angle Paddle. These have longer thinner blades and are more energy efficient for putting in miles.   Werner, Bending Branches, and Advanced Technologies are 3 top notch brands. I would advise against cheap paddles as they wear you out much faster and the 2 piece joint sections tend to give out."
kayakfishing,3ax55c,jivarie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"100%, go with a touring blade.  Beyond that, it's all about whether you have a high stroke, wide boat...etc."

One of the most prolific, with tons of videos, is Robert Field.  https://www.youtube.com/user/yaknaggie  16 ft is a very big boat to try to manhandle around and car top, although the Revo's can be pretty heavy too.  Rod holders can be mounted anywhere to anything, these days everything is modular so you just have to install a gear track on a flat surface.  You're concern about spending the money doesn't seem valid, the Revo is proven to be a good fishing boat.  I don't think your real concern is about how it will work for fishing, but rather your own concern about your commitment to it.  If you want to spend $2,500 for a boat that is without a doubt one of the best fishing platforms, without the weight or cumbersomeness of a PA, you should look at the Native Slayer Propels.  If you're car topping get the 10 ft model, if you're serious about the gulf, get the 13.  Standard advice is to try them on the water before you buy, but you might not have that option.

kayakfishing,3aef7r,ThunderCows,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of fishing but here is my input from paddling these boats.  Big Rig - 1st in stability 3. slowest. Most kit for your buck. Big Game II - 2nd in stability, middle speed. Adequately equipped Ride 135 w/ Airpro Max Sea - 2nd most stable. fastest. least kit.  Depending on your price range I would recommend going Big Rig since it's hands down most stable platform given its width. If money is no object take a look at the Wildy A.T.A.K 14. Its an all around upgrade to the Ride 135 and the stability demo's i've seen for that boat are insanely impressive."
kayakfishing,3aef7r,Bland251,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"I recently bought the Wilderness System's 135 and I absolutely love it. I seen the Big Rig in the kayak shop and it looked nice. I just could imagine lugging that thing around. I also fish in many different waters and  have been known to go as far as 8-10 miles one way. The Big Rig doesn't look like the kind of kayak you are going to paddle any sort of distance. The Big Game II was also in the shop, however I didn't pay much attention to it due to it not have a comfortable looking seat. I also seen a plastic comparison and Wilderness System's and Jackson had very thick plastic versus the rest. I'm a larger guy myself and the Ride 135 has the new AirPro Max  seat and it's fantastic. This is coming from someone with a bad back and I'm able to stay out and fish all day with no complaints. The stability on the Ride is awesome. I'm able to stand up and fish with ease and have never been concerned with going in the drink. I would find a reputable dealer nearby that demo's and go try them out. Best of luck to you."
kayakfishing,3aef7r,Bland251,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.  Is the max seat the seat that sits high,  or the one that raises and lowers?"
kayakfishing,3aef7r,HindleMcCrindleberry,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:18:48 2015 UTC,"No problem. The AirPro Max is the seat that adjust from low to high. I enjoy the high/low feature on this seat because it is very easy to adjust in the boat and another feature that is great is the ability to trim the seat forward and backwards. I'm right at 270 and being able to trim the seat is nice for many reasons, not just to adjust the load of the boat."
kayakfishing,3aamfl,B0xyRawr,3,Thu Jun 18 15:33:43 2015 UTC,"Is that a Frontier 12 in the salt?  I have that kayak for lake fishing but didn't think it would work that well in the ocean, not sure why maybe because it sits a bit higher up I assumed I would get blown around and it doesn't have a ton of scupper holes so I thought it might be a wet ride - how has your experience been.  Can you do this in any weather or is do you need the perfect day.  Thanks in advance."
kayakfishing,3aamfl,orphanboyk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"I've been out in 15knot winds and quite a lot of rough chop, say 1-2ft seas and never felt tippy, but you wouldn't be able to paddle through that kind of weather. My passenger and I only got home because of the outboard.   With paddling power, I was fine going 3-4km off shore in a 5-8knot wind solo, but with two people it'd be tougher. The stability offered by the wide hull does affect paddling efficiency once you're loaded past 200lbs. Again, I'd recommend getting the outboard for those trips.  Most of the states seems to have bigger sweeping waves than here (BC, Canada). The islands here and floor topology shelter the route from the bigger swells, but  instead we get smaller, rougher chop. I wouldn't take it out voluntarily in anything higher than 8 knot winds without motor, 12 knot with.   Amazing for crabbing and fishing though.  Edit: Also, you're right that I use a lower profile bench for ocean, and reserve the comfier boat seats for the lake."

kayakfishing,3a8s5f,weldcoman,2,Thu Jun 18 11:23:30 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the Pescador 12 - it's a great all around boat that you can use on big water and smaller rivers. I prefer the SOT kayaks, you don't need to worry about them filling with water or carrying a pump and if you are in hot climate they don't turn into an oven.  Depending on your neck of the woods there might be some good used boats around, lots of people are looking to upgrade so you might be able to pick up an older ride 115 or cude 12. If there is a local fishing club or facebook page it might be worth posting that you are in the market.  One last thing the accessories (paddle, life-jacket, throw bag, rod holders) can add up quickly if you can try to find a package deal or ask if they can throw something in. If you are buying used guys usually have extra stuff that is sitting unused due to upgrades.  Good luck."
kayakfishing,3a8s5f,orphanboyk,2,Thu Jun 18 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"You may get some heated opinions on the whole sit-in versus sit-on issue. Seems the majority of yak anglers prefer sit-on, but personally I feel much more secure in a sit-in. If there are any outdoor stores near you (BassPro, REI, etc.) a lot of those places will let you try a yak before buying, or you could look into renting different types and see what feels best (I realize you said you're on a budget, but you really won't know which you like until you try them). I own the BPS Ascend brand FS10. It's only $500, weighs 50(ish)lbs (so I can carry that thing all over the place, load it onto the roof of my car by myself no problem), and comes pretty much ready to fish out of (rod holders, really nice seat, big wide open cockpit, paddle locks, multiple grooves for resting the paddle while wrangling fish, rear well is built to fit a milk crate and 12v SLA battery perfectly). Is it as nice as some of the really expensive, high-end sit-on yaks? Hell no, but it definitely beats a lot of ""angler"" yaks flooding the market right now that are in the $400-$800 range (companies are starting to put holders and trolleys on yaks that really aren't angler friendly and just increasing the price by $100-$200, it's lame)"

I caught both of those by looking for bait fish near the surface. The striped bass was one of many that were jumping all around me. The smallmouth was part of a school that was passing by."

A fish finder is a great tool for finding areas that should hold fish. I've never found the perfect ""fish arch"" they talk about but i mostly fish kelp beds and reefs in the salt."
kayakfishing,3a645x,jivarie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:47:12 2015 UTC,Maybe I should try getting off the shore a shot. Tough to find bait fish when it's been so windy recently though
kayakfishing,3a645x,jivarie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:53:50 2015 UTC,"Keep an eye out for birds. That's how I found the school of smallmouth. Wind is actually good for fishing, bait fish find food, bigger fish find the bait fish. At least, according to something I read yesterday. The lake was completely flat today, so I just happened to come across them at the right time."

kayakfishing,3a4bq1,ZanderCruze,2,Wed Jun 17 03:10:17 2015 UTC,Get some cross bars from eBay and something to strap it down. You can use ratchet straps but be careful to not over tighten it.
kayakfishing,3a4bq1,yess_man,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:48:43 2015 UTC,So I don't need some fancy kayak specific attachment? I didn't think cross bars would work to hold a kayak down on the freeway.
kayakfishing,3a4bq1,kheup,5,Wed Jun 17 04:06:10 2015 UTC,"They work just fine. Wrap the straps under the bar on one side of the yak throw both ends over to the other side and go under the bar on that side, tighten. I'd advise against ratchet straps if you're going to be leaving it on there for any period of time. Even high quality plastic gets easier to flex in heat and over tightening ratchets, which is easy to do, can warp your kayak. Get some good pull straps from NRS.   Just to assure you it's fine. I have a rack on the back of my truck that has just cross bars, I've driven countless highway miles at 70-80mph it wasn't going anywhere."
kayakfishing,3a4bq1,KayakBassFisher,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"you do not.  I've carried my kayak for years, no kayak specific attachment.  You will need some type of cross bars though."

kayakfishing,3a1gya,TomMelee,2,Tue Jun 16 14:16:08 2015 UTC,The Lure is sick. I've not rode either but I have tested their seats and the lure seat is a damn lazy boy as far as comfort. Both boats have an extremely similar design and feel about the same in terms of construction.
kayakfishing,3a1gya,thesearmsaresnakes89,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:03:50 2015 UTC,"Do you feel that the comfort of the Lure seat warrants the price difference? I think the Lure has like...2 positions, where the F&S is technically infinitely adjustable? I dunno why I'd need that. The F&S seat also folds totally vertically to give more foot platform room...but...whatever."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,thesearmsaresnakes89,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say the shadowcaster is a great boat for you and what you want to do with it. I'd probably get the feelfree for the name and resale value. I guess they're both manufactured by the same company, JoySports, so they're probably going to be very similar except for the wheel in the hull which I'm told Feelfree has patented."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,thesearmsaresnakes89,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking that. I really wish I could see the lure in person to like...know, though, you know? Where did you see that they're manufactured by the same company?  The wheel in the hull would be nice too...I drag the hell out of my OK getting to the water...but then it's an OK and it doesn't care. :)"
kayakfishing,3a1gya,thesearmsaresnakes89,2,Tue Jun 16 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"I read it in a forum. http://www.kayak-anglers.com/forum/thread-field-and-stream-shadow-caster-kayak  FeelFrees are kind of hard to come by in person. I was in PCB, FL a few weeks ago and hung out at a dealer and after talking to the sales person and sitting in one, I was ready to sell my brand new wilderness ride to get a feelfree. The shadowcaster has probably taken the title of ""best affordable all purpose sit on top"" from the FS15 but in the realm of expensive boats, nothing beats a hobie so you got that to consider. Haha either boat will serve you nicely."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,penubly,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I lived near PCB (east about 45 minutes) for a while and plan to get back within the next 5 years, that's part of my thought. That's where I got my OK and why I got something with lots of oyster bed bottom protection.  As for Hobie, I'm a weirdie who isn't fascinated with mirage drive, BUT when I was there, folks with cash could get good deals on Hobies on craigslist somewhat regularly. I prefer the Native propulsion to the mirage, personally, but to get a Hobie kitted the way I'd want it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than I feel the need to spend. :)  I'm actually considering selling my gas boat as part of the acquisition. Haven't really used it in the last few years because I've been having so much fun on the yak."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,DrRabbitt,2,Tue Jun 16 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"Right on! Great area. We yaked in the bay at St Andrews and off the shore too. Whatever you get, let me know how it suits you. I bought my ride this year and absolutely love it. Not too stable for standing but a great boat. I was hesitant about going into the 1K price range but haven't regretted it because I don't feel a need to upgrade to something drastically more expensive."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,DrRabbitt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I haven't decided for sure that I'm doing ANYTHING, I should probably work on a more reliable vehicle, lolololol.

I'm still gonna build some riggers for the OK in the near future, but I'm looking at a new seat and a new paddle and some new accessories...all the sudden that feels like throwing bad money after good.  I wonder what I could get for my OK with the addons it has..."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,SGallmeier,2,Tue Jun 16 18:01:42 2015 UTC,I've paddled the Lure in both lengths and think they rival the Wilderness ride in terms of stability. The seat is comfortable; my only concern is that the Lure seat mechanism will not stand up to salt water for long.
kayakfishing,3a1gya,SGallmeier,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:05:09 2015 UTC,Excellent comment. Thanks for your input!

It weighs around 70 pounds, but has a wheel on the back similar to the feel free. I stand on my seat, in the raised position, when I'm stalking redfish on the flats and can throw an 8 foot cast net from it without ever feeling like its gonna roll"
kayakfishing,3a1gya,Vagicles,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"I have not. That IS sexy...and when I'm back on salt I'll want as long as possible. Looking at the page, I don't see an MSRP. Mind sharing what they go for?"
kayakfishing,3a1gya,Vagicles,2,Wed Jun 17 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"Mine was 1399 from my local shop. It was the least expensive of the big name sot fishing boats. I added 4 flush mount rod holders behind the seat, a dual anchor set up, and a ram track mount rod holders and its just about perfect. I may get sonar eventually, but I normally fish in a foot of water so that can wait. I like that there aren't hatches covering my storage that can be a pain to access while on the water, other people may not like that. There is also very limited in hull access, just the small cubby behind the seat, and the mounting plate for electronics, so storing things inside the hull isn't super feasible. The storage on either side of the seat for plano boxes is brilliant."
kayakfishing,3a1gya,Vagicles,2,Wed Jun 17 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks for the response. I guess when I head to eastern MD here in a few weeks I need to budget a day to scope out some dealers. Like the big Lure, that's a bit out of my price range but I'd love to sit in several and compare them for stability and my particular style."
kayakfishing,3a2g9u,Redsox933,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:30:06 2015 UTC,Tires come off and mine folds up and fits in the front dry storage compartment.

kayakfishing,3a2g9u,Dr_Quartermas,2,Tue Jun 16 18:52:00 2015 UTC,I use the same kind and I just fold it up and lay it in the back deck of the kayak (Cuda 14). The wheels pretty much stay out of the water and it's ready to go whenever I need it.
kayakfishing,3a2g9u,thisisme30,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:41:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! Any idea how wide your hatch opening is? I have a tarpon 120 and I am trying to figure out if it would fit in my big compartment.
kayakfishing,3a2g9u,Peevedkitten,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I think it would be similar, mine is the perception caster 12.5 and the front hatch on it is similar to the pescador which is an older version of the tarpon 120.  But I can measure it tomorrow morning for."
kayakfishing,3a2g9u,blarghusmaximus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:54 2015 UTC,I have the mono wheel for my raptor and the trax cart for my Hobie. I can strap them to the boat pretty easily. I fish a lot of salt (probably 99% salt) though and depending on where i launch i have left the raptor wheel on shore a lot. It only fits that boat so it's not likely to get stolen.

I was sitting on the flats in my kayak fishing for trout/reds when a boat with 4 bros on it came right thru the mangroves and seagrass and about 20ft from my kayak. Of the 4 bros on the boat only one actually saw me. The other 3 were looking in the opposite direction the whole time, including the guy driving the boat.   I didn't see the aftermath(other than the prop scar) of when the game warden caught up to them, but he was on their trail in less than 10mins.  I honestly don't think he cared much about the close call, but seemed pretty pissed off by the brand new muddy prop scar."

kayakfishing,39x8sg,KevinCaution,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:56:25 2015 UTC,"Fishing in my part of world might be different but here are a couple of suggestions. Try to find the drop-offs, most likely in the heat your big fish are down deep. I try to anchor my kayak right on top of the drop off so I can fish both shallow and deep.  We are allowed two rods, take your first rod and use it on the deep side right off the bottom. There are several techniques for this, a weight with floating power bait, a bobber with a simple hook/worm, or my favourite just straight down, no bobber, 2 feet off the bottom.  The second rod I use to fish either the shallows or deep, basically working both side of the drop off and varying up my lure and retrieves to try and find something that works.  I also use scent on my lures, I think it makes a difference but it might just be psychological.   Good luck!"

kayakfishing,39x8sg,blatherdrift,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:57:47 2015 UTC,they sink plenty fine. Tip up and twitch and then give a slight bit of slack and the worm see saws back and forth as it sinks. Slack is key otherwise it sinks flat horizontal w/o much action. Wait for that dead weight feel if they pick it up on the fall or the double tap where they take it in

kayakfishing,39x8sg,Sevelan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"So I hate bass fishing and haven't done it in awhile. The fish here are too smart and the water is too clear and deep. Not sure how TN differs from southern CA, but by far the most productive bait I've used is an unweighted super small sluggo type jerk bait. Something about the size of your thumb, on light line and small hook. In the hot summer, we'd basically get there early and do well until about 9-10 am, then the fish go from shallow and feeding to deep and lazy. Fish the sluggo s-l-o-w, back and forth with pauses, you will get a lot of chasers that don't bite. When I was in high school I'd fish probably 4 times a week at the local lake, and the sluggo was the go to bait. I NEVER caught a single fish on any type of crankbait, including the high dollar castaic ultra realistic ones."

kayakfishing,39vpjx,TuskedFrog,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:48:11 2015 UTC,While thats definitely a good idea do you think it is really necessary? I mean PFDs are pretty rock solid. I'm sure you can kick your legs and paddle just fine with a PFD on even if you cant swim at all.
kayakfishing,39vpjx,catastrapostrophe,3,Tue Jun 16 15:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and upvote all the ""learn to swim"", because I think that goes without saying. However hard you have found swimming in the past, it's easier to learn to swim than it is to learn to breathe underwater.  I'll also add though that a lot of kayaking safety relies on things other than being able to swim - a good PFD, the right kind of dry suit, the right level of fitness for the paddle you're going on, going with a buddy, using lights, a radio, spare paddle, etc. Typical ""good swimmers"" rarely have a good understanding of how hard it is to swim clothed, in cold water, in choppy seas or in a current, or injured from a collision. I'm a very strong swimmer, but in 50 degree water I'll be dead just as soon as you without help.  On the bright side, one of the greatest things about kayak fishing is that you can fish all sorts of shallows unreachable by a regular boat. If you're not comfortable in open water, there are a lot of fish in 4' deep flats."
kayakfishing,39vpjx,Sloppy_Twat,3,Mon Jun 15 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't risk dying for kayak fishing. There are many places that offer adult swim classes. Take a couple, swimming is awesome."
kayakfishing,39vpjx,RedSnowBird,2,Mon Jun 15 13:08:13 2015 UTC,"Consider skipping going out in saltwater. Just fish freshwater in small streams and small lakes. With a life jacket should be easy to reach shore.  Even those telling you to ""learn to swim"" could easily drown without a life jacket, especially in bad weather, on a large lake or if too far off shore. More so if water temps are low.

kayakfishing,39bdng,ThunderCows,2,Wed Jun 10 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"I just ordered a Cuda 14 and have this opinion on them. They are designed for speed and tracking. A defined keel down the center line keeps the boat fighting against change in direction which is ideal for reservoir/flat water fishing but not in a river. If the river is wide and slow enough the 14 will perform fine but in the pinch scenarios where you need to turn the bow of the boat fast you'll be at a disadvantage vs a boat like the Coosa HD or Cuda 12. Unfortunately you can't have both and it has to be put up to your paddle skill level. I can confidently paddle a longer boat in most water but if you have a low angle easy technique that isn't aggressive enough to turn all 14ft of the boat you will find yourself in some trouble. That being said there are no master of all water boats IMO, but from what i gathered the Cuda 14 does it the best. The alternatives are the Coosa HD, Cuda 12 if you want to stick with Jackson boats but I found the HD to be too slow for my taste/price point and still had too much waddle in the strokes. The Cuda 12 is same hull design but again the shortening drops performance you get out of a 14ft boat making it into a jack of all trades, master of none boat. If I were you I'd stick with the 14 b/c its best at what it's designed to do or look into a Wilderness Systems A.T.A.K 14 and later look into having a boat just for rivers. In the mean time be more aggressive with paddle stroke and always wear your PFD and you'll be fine!"
kayakfishing,39bdng,orphanboyk,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:01:21 2015 UTC,Thanks! This was what I am after. I am really trying to see what I maybe missng on a river.  Most of my river fishing is facing the bank and floating with the current.
kayakfishing,39bdng,jivarie,2,Wed Jun 10 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Just a couple of thoughts - 14ft is long, take a look at where you are going to store the boat and how you are going to transport it to/from the water. Take a look at the water you will be on, if rivers are really part of the equation then 12 might be a better option. The reason you need a shorter more maneuverable boat on a river is to avoid obstacles, like large rocks, down trees, things that can really get you in trouble. The disadvantage of using a 12 ft boat on large water is mostly speed, the 12 ft CUDA will track fine and has lots of room for gear and it is certainly stable enough and self bailing that it can handle the big waves.  For most people who are just fishing speed is a lower priority but if you are planning on fishing with buddies I wouldn't want to be the guy with the 12 while your friends are miles ahead on 14-16 ft kayaks, you would never be able to keep up."
kayakfishing,397ism,username802,2,Tue Jun 9 20:36:02 2015 UTC,"Nice catch! I don't personally care, (actually, more power to ya) but I'm just wondering what is the law regarding alcohol on a non-motorized boat? Last year I went out with a buddy in my old Jon boat and he brought a sixer. A helluva storm came so we docked and decided to drink a couple when a local striper guide saw us. He walked over and told me about how big the marine patrols binoculars are and said that I better not get caught with beer in the boat. But I see people all the time on pontoons and cigarette/party boats with coolers full of beer. And we used to float down the river on inner tubes with a floating cooler full of beer tied on behind us. So, what's the deal?"
kayakfishing,397ism,Bobarhino,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:55:54 2015 UTC,Not sure what the rules are where you are. But one can get duis for pedalling a bike where I am living. So I always assumed the same goes for the waters. Although in 10years here I have seen 1 cop on the lake.

kayakfishing,392i7e,Thisismyfinalstand,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:05:43 2015 UTC,If you get a cart for it and a trailer then go for it. If you're planning on carrying it anywhere or car topping then forget it

I would have to car top it to get it home obviously, my plan was to either pool float and tie strap to my Prius or borrow a minivan from a friend... 16' does seem too big the more I think of it... Better to be patient I guess.  Thank you!"
kayakfishing,392i7e,Thisismyfinalstand,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:15:16 2015 UTC,Yeah too big I think then man. You'll find a better one. Check those Facebook groups they come through all the time.

kayakfishing,392i7e,BronsonBuster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:39:20 2015 UTC,So are you happy with the 13? Any negatives about it?
kayakfishing,392i7e,BronsonBuster,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:30:34 2015 UTC,"I would've liked the pro anglers width and it was the one I was comparing mine to.  Reverse works well when I'm out on lakes not trolling.  Really comfortable to use for long periods too, chairs good, very stable too.  I've taken it into 20-30mph winds and still moved at 4mph.  I catch a lot of fish because the propel drive acts like a foot controlled trolling motor, you can really beat the crap out of areas and get full casting coverage of an area.   The only real negative is that it's big and heavy, but I still can hand cart it fine.  I tow it on a pwc trailer otherwise.  Also the upgraded rudder is a must have, improved my control dramatically."
kayakfishing,392i7e,sporkd2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:58:37 2015 UTC,I love the hobie pro angler design but the reverse on the slayer is pretty much a must for me. The weight will not bother me at all. Those are pretty good speeds you're getting out of it in the wind. Sounds like it'll do everything I want it to do.

kayakfishing,38xvjx,Utilityj,2,Sun Jun 7 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Be prepared is all I can say.  It's easily the hardest fighting fish i've encountered in the kayak.  Do not come to the fight under powered rod/reel wise.  We chased them for 3 days straight, sabiki'd bait on the beach and then put out the baits on the line the tarpon were running.  If you really want one, go to Indian Pass/Cape san blas in late July or early August.  You'll get one."

kayakfishing,38xvjx,randomasfuuck27,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:06:39 2015 UTC,Were you by the pass?
kayakfishing,38xvjx,randomasfuuck27,2,Mon Jun 8 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"Just past the jetties on the cape.  The pass is better generally, but when the tarpon are running the beach it's easier to put in outside the house than it is to go to the pass.  That said, the big reds and blacks were thick overin the pass."
kayakfishing,38xvjx,randomasfuuck27,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:39:23 2015 UTC,Nice. I was there a couple weeks ago. We have a tarpon trip planned for late july.. whats the best way to fish for them at the pass? Troll up and down? Or anchor and drift baits? I heard near where the pass spills out on an outgoing tide is best.. any truth to that?
kayakfishing,38xvjx,blatherdrift,2,Mon Jun 8 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"Indian Pass is the spot if you want the best shot at finding them.  Dumping tide, just drift baits out the pass as you go.   However, I MUCH prefer them off the cape in the clearer water.  You can sabiki rig bait and just slow paddle 100-200 yrds off the beach until you hook up.  There's the added benefit of avoiding the sailcats.  Sharks/Sailcats can ruin a tarpon trip in the pass, and you can't avoid them.  They will hit a topwater plug, cut bait, live bait...whatever you're using for tarpon bait.  That said, if you head to the left of the ramp and head back into the oysters, you'll find some really good tailing Black/Red drum action first thing in the morning."
kayakfishing,38xvjx,blatherdrift,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:32:49 2015 UTC,Man those sailcats are the worst. Caught probably 20 of them last trip. Thanks for the info.
kayakfishing,38xvjx,jdavenp3,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, and you can't effing avoid them over by the pass.  They will absolutely beat a tarpon to your topwater plug every time.  That said, they avoid the clear water on the cape like the plague."
kayakfishing,38xvjx,KayakBassFisher,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:51:19 2015 UTC,Any tips on where to sabiki the bait?

kayakfishing,38z1o1,Sirhc_the_Nsane1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:56:25 2015 UTC,That's the fst12t correct? How did it handle in that type of steam?
kayakfishing,38z1o1,budhyzer21,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:20:43 2015 UTC,Yes it is! It rides extremely shallow so that's a plus crossing down trees. only down side is that bc it is wide enough to stand in that a normal kayak will out run it. I managed to keep up all day but it took much more work.
kayakfishing,38z1o1,budhyzer21,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:05:05 2015 UTC,Awesome. I have a few small rivers in my town and I just wanted to make sure it could be used here. I've never paddled a kayak before so I'm not sure how a heavy kayak handles the current.
kayakfishing,390inl,mrhodes667,2,Mon Jun 8 10:35:38 2015 UTC,"Have you tested this out in the water yet?   I'm truly not trying to rain on your parade, but I don't think it's going to be rigid enough to keep the kayak tracking strait. Most likely what will happen is the entire thing will flex to one side or the other and make you turn.   You might want to try cutting off the leading part of the rudder so there is not an ""L"" shape in the water. Do away with the weight and drill a hole towards the top of the rudder on the leading edge for a little bungee strap(shock cord) and attach it to the bottom of your cork block. The bungee strap will hold it down in the water but still allow it to hinge up when needed.  The whole thing will still be really flexible, but I'm sure it'll be better than nothing and definitely make a noticeable difference."
kayakfishing,390inl,TrailChaser,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"Hiya TrailChaser, Thanks for the constructive discussion, I really appreciate it. This I guess is my first prototype and the proof will definitely be in the pudding. I haven't taken it to the water yet, but will do soon and provide and update/summary here. Anything that will improve the tracking of the kayak will be good. The plastic is pretty rigid, my concern would be that it would snap on a hard turn. But all these are theory until it gets proven in a water test. However good thing is that i'm willing to give any mod a go, and as per your advice and other thoughts I have for improvement, now I have options ...and hopefully give others ideas out there who might have the same or similar kayaks for mods to help them also. The other option I am thinking of is changing the material from plastic to a metal type...but we'll see how it performs in the watwr first and go from there :) Cheers and thanks!"
kayakfishing,390inl,TrailChaser,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:40:42 2015 UTC,Water tested the experimental rudder ... and definitely works. It didn't bend nor force kayak to turn. It didnt snap either which was pretty good. Improved the tracking and I didnt have to double paddle too much for correction. I might post up a vid on the water test. But otherwise pretty chuffed !
kayakfishing,38z4cr,jivarie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:46:37 2015 UTC,Caught on a gulp mullet on a 5/0 bass hook.  They were tailing hard on a falling tide on top of the oyster bars.

kayakfishing,38ym3x,Betaworldpeach,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:09:49 2015 UTC,Drill a screw half way into the top of your crate on the side that's further back. Wrap your bungie cord around it and it should hold it in place pretty good.

The fit on the hull of the ride 135 isn't perfect, but nothing a little extra padding can't take care of.  One thing I didn't know to do was once you have the kayak on the cart, you have to push the kayak backwards to make the two arms engage and press up against the hull of the kayak.  Once I did this and strapped the cart to the kayak it worked out pretty well.  This cart once taken apart also fits into the front hatch which is a plus."

kayakfishing,38jm62,Gnarfunkel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:18:33 2015 UTC,I haven't had any personal experiences with it but the scupper holes are generally your weak point on a kayak. I have read a lot about not using the holes for things like putting a stake out rod through for anchoring but haven't really heard of it about the cart situation.  I believe you'd be fine as long as there isnt a ton of weight on or around the scupper area while you are carting it.

kayakfishing,38c45k,jimmypork,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:58:51 2015 UTC,"Ive never sat in an ultimate but I would figure Id rather be able to stretch my legs around.  I can do that fine on a native slayer, and I'm 6'2 240."
kayakfishing,38c45k,BronsonBuster,2,Wed Jun 3 11:22:19 2015 UTC,In all honesty I'm 5ft11in and weigh 260. So my main concern would be the stability rather than leg room. Thanks for the input.
kayakfishing,38c45k,BronsonBuster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Width = stability.  The ultimate fx is a couple inches wider than the old town, which would mean more stability, but it's the same stability and width as say a slayer sit on top.  Pay attention to the width as you shop."
kayakfishing,38c45k,chaseisbarber,2,Wed Jun 3 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"More width doesn't automatically mean more stability. My Caster is the same 30"" width of a Commander 120 and the Commander is the more stable boat by far. I can stand in the Caster, but I have zero confidence in doing anything while standing. I can stand, fish, and walk around in the Commander with no concern at all.   Hull design is more important. My Caster has a basically flat bottom, whereas the Commander has a tunnel hull bottom. This greatly improves the tracking and secondary stability, even though they're pretty much the same dimensions."
kayakfishing,38c45k,TDL4LIFE,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:38:10 2015 UTC,I've been looking at that Old Town Next too. The 450 lb. Capacity  and only weighing 59 lbs. is pretty attractive.
kayakfishing,38c45k,chaseisbarber,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:47:10 2015 UTC,I thought so too. My biggest concern is if it does start to take on water it would quickly sink or at the least be much more difficult to get the water out of. Thanks for the input.
kayakfishing,38c45k,chaseisbarber,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"I recently demoed a Wilderness Systems Commander 120 hybrid and it was awesome. I currently use a Perception Caster 12.5 sot(very similar to the Pescador 12) and the Commander was much more stable and tracked much better. It will definitely be my next kayak purchase.   The main selling point of the hybrid for me is the weight. My current yak weighs around 65lbs, and most of the more stable sot models(ride, Coosa, Cuda) weigh considerably more(typically around 80lbs). Hybrids like the Commander and Ultimate weigh around 60lbs, but offer the same stability as the heavier sots and often have more available storage space."
kayakfishing,38c45k,orphanboyk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all points. More room, less weight. I am strongly leaning toward this boat. Thanks for the input."
kayakfishing,38c45k,orphanboyk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"Just be sure you take hull design into account. The next is very canoe-like on the bottom, so I wouldn't expect to be able to stand in it. In fact, it looks a lot like the Mad River Synergy/Perception Destiny. It probably won't flip, but it won't be easy to stand in. The Commander has a tunnel/multi-chine hull much like the Ride 115, so it has the same incredible stability without the added weight."

If the weather is cool or you really hate being wet you can wear hydroskin, it is a really thin layer of neoprene that will keep you dry and warm, great for the shoulder seasons. I even wear them under my convertible pants so I don't look too hard core.  For occasional rain I sometimes use rain pants but in hot weather you will get wet from the inside.  I burn easy so I always have a micro towel that I can drape over my legs to keep the sun off - the crispy issue is much worse then being wet."

They breathe well enough that I don't sweat them soaked from the inside in hot weather, and in cooler weather, or nights on a windy pier, they block the wind enough to keep me from freezing.   They also have sun protection built into the fabric, although I still am not sure how they do that, or how long it lasts."

I followed the directions one year and applied 45 min to one hour before entering the sun. Haven't been burnt since. Just make sure to cover all areas good. I also suggest applying to the upper thighs before putting our short son as the tend to ride up on you when out on the water. I do this because I have a thing about wet clothing sticking to my body.

I got these pants about a year ago and have used them countless times. Once you get over the fact that you're spending $60 on fishing pants, you'll be happy you have them. The pants are a bit water repellent, doesn't stain easily, and protects you from the sun and bugs down here in Florida. No more weird tan lines or mosquitoes and gnats eating my legs. The only gripe I have is that the pant legs run a bit longer than the measurement says, otherwise they're awesome."

Your crate will pretty much always get wet. Don't put stuff in there you need to keep dry and for the record, I never use my scupper plugs.  I don't put anything on my cross bars, I just flip my yak upside down and hoist it up there. I had pool noodles for a while but they blew off one day and I still feel bad about littering. Can't help on the emergency radio part. Cell service for me is typically fairly spotty so maybe I should look into it. No real help.

I haven't figured out a good way to do it yet. Am I dumb, or is this a universal problem? http://www.amazon.com/Extend-A-Truck-944-Truck-Bed-Extender/dp/B00008BKX5  2.) How do y'all keep your kayak crate from getting soaked? Do you plug the scuppers? http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11206504&cp=4406646.4413989.4414132  3.) Taking it on the interstate/highway. I currently have those foam blocks on my cross bars, with tie downs on the side and front to back. Is this good enough? Should I go for the ""U"" carrier instead?  I run a tie down across my truck bed, 1 through the front carrying handle, and another through both side carrying handles.  4.) I normally yak on my own, and thus have been researching an emergency radio. Do y'all have any suggestions?  I carry a whistle because its the law in NC, but I know a lot of guys have small UHF radios  5.) Any Tarpon 120 (or the other Tarpon's) owners out there have any tricks or tips for me that would be useful? I have a malibu x-13 but my biggest piece of advice is to build a custom set of wheels like this: http://www.instructables.com/id/PKC-PVC-Kayak-Cart/  I run a piece of nylon through the wheels with carabiner on each side that I can hook onto the yak to hold them down."

When fishing docks you try flipping plastics way back under boats and the owners get pissy thinking the lead/tungsten will chip their boats if you miss and hit the hull. Understandable to be grumpy but as an angler you have every right to fish. I'd more more upset at someone navigating a motorboat in such proximity to me..."
kayakfishing,37x1f3,ThunderCows,5,Sun May 31 04:26:03 2015 UTC,I'd be a little pissy if someone was fishing that close to my docked boat. There's just some things you don't do. You can fish close to my dock and boat if you're continually throwing it at or under boat. I'd probably come ask you to move down. Hell you can even jig right next to it and i wouldn't care.
kayakfishing,37x1f3,OmwToGallifrey,0,Sun May 31 06:24:17 2015 UTC,In Lake Austin pretty much every section of shoreline is lined with docks so it's become the norm.

kayakfishing,37l9ev,wilsed88,3,Thu May 28 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"Sundolphin and pelican are brands I'd avoid at all costs. Sure they're cheap, but they are also incredibly cheaply made - you can do a lot better for the money. With this particular model, the deep seatwell and no scuppers means you're gonna be sitting in a bathtub when water comes over the side. Which I guarantee it will. Nearly all SOT kayaks have self-bailing scupper holes for this reason. The lack of them on this one means that it's probably so poorly designed that it couldn't float if it had them. It looks like they put the seatwell super deep in order to keep the boat's center of gravity lower, which also very likely means that their hull design is inherently unstable.  For a decent fishing kayak on a budget, look into the Perception Pescador 12 - it's a great boat and you can often find it on sale for $399 or less. I have a couple of them and they are really nice boats for the money."

I've been seeing this all over the web today and I just don't get why people are considering this a ""kayak fishing record"".  The guy is tied off to the cement structure next to him.  It seems as though he could have just tied himself off to the top of that structure or any other floaty thingy and hauled the fish up next to him without even needing to be in a kayak. Then a power boat hauled the fish to a beach for him so he can pose with it.  Don't get me wrong, it looks like it would be a blast and good for him for having fun, but it also seems like an abuse of a research permit to catch a protected species and claim it was a record. And that fish doesn't seem anywhere near 550 lbs to me. 300, sure. 400? Maybe. But 500? I don't really buy it. Ok, rant over."

If you're looking for any fishfinder with both traditional 2D sonar and downscan imaging, it'll typically cover a range from 50ish kHz up to 800ish kHz.  A similar Humminbird model:  http://www.humminbird.com/Products/HELIX-5-DI/  I opted to go without GPS or chartplotting, typically just don't fish waters big enough to make it worthwhile, and my smartphone is typically with me anyway.  As far as power goes, you have lots of options.  I built a battery box out of a couple of 12v feeder batteries.  Overkill, perhaps--but I can run some LED lights off of it, charge USB devices in an emergency, etc.  With a total of 14Ah I've never had to worry about discharging it.  Good luck!  I only started using one a couple of years ago and it taught me a lot about waters I (thought) I was familiar with.  I can't say it's drastically increased my hookups (let's be honest there's always an element of luck involved) but it's definitely helped me avoid areas that ""looked"" good but had little hope of being productive."
kayakfishing,37eyas,Tychosis,1 point,Wed May 27 10:52:42 2015 UTC,That is a good breakdown. I am running the Lowerance Elite 4x CHIRP fish finder and it is a great one for the price. Anybody that is looking at that model needs to be careful because they do sell it without the DSI capable transducer for a little bit cheaper. I am using this 12V lithium battery and it runs my finder for at least 8 hours and weighs around 1lb. The DSI is amazing we fished a lake full of trees and you could make out every branch under the water and see fish hanging all around the trees.
kayakfishing,37eyas,Black_Lab,1 point,Wed May 27 13:29:12 2015 UTC,I think that's part of what was confusing me was what came with different models. But yeah great breakdown. That about solves my problem. Now just gotta figure out how to mount everything.
kayakfishing,37eyas,CookieMonstr78,1 point,Wed May 27 14:43:24 2015 UTC,Is the 12v battery the small one that came with the depth finder or are you using a marine 12v battery? I currently have the small 12v and a marine 12v for my trolling motor and was thinking about hooking the depth finder to the trolling battery.  One less thing to lug around.   I'm assuming I can but wasn't sure.  Any pics of your setup?  I like the led light idea and a charger for the phone if I need it.  Anything to add more gadgets to the kayak.  lol

This is a little heavy and the box isn't terribly small, but it provides plenty of power:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kY0FyLhnMQ  You SHOULD be able to run your finder off the same battery you're running your trolling motor off of--but I've also heard of people getting interference on their finder from the trolling motor.  I have no experience with this myself so someone else would have to chime in.  On my battery box, I opted to use Anderson Powerpoles for my quick disconnects... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Powerpole ... just so I can easily add or remove gadgets as needed.

kayakfishing,37btrd,krucz36,5,Tue May 26 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"I've only got one rod holder mounted to the kayak right now. I used the gasket that came with it to mark the area to drill the screw holes and the cutout.  http://i.imgur.com/UHCJXJf.jpg  Then I test fit the rod holder, and found that because the bottom wasn't angled like the top, it hit the bottom of the Kayak.  http://i.imgur.com/YQhUfkO.jpg  So I cut the bottom at an angle to match the top at a sufficient length to give a little clearance at the bottom.  http://i.imgur.com/Y48o56U.jpg  After putting Marine Goop on both sides of the gasket, I screwed it down with some rubber washers.  http://i.imgur.com/sGKp0kj.jpg  For the seat, I had to make a PVC bracket to sit into the scupper holes. I used 3/4"" schedule 40, mounted to a wooden base, with a screw through the center of the long piece to hold it at the correct angle and prevent it from turning.  edit: I've got some scupper plugs on the way that I'm going to be fitting to the end of those pieces, which will prevent the hard edges of them from damaging the inside of the scupper holes. I've got some 3/4"" PVC plugs that I'm going to screw to the top of the scupper plugs, and then use PVC glue to attach them to the bottom of the bracket ends.  http://i.imgur.com/5j9PNCH.jpg  I put a thick foam pad (not pictured) beneath the seat, and use the webbing strap and buckles from the original backrest to hold it in place through some slits I cut on the side of the seat.  http://i.imgur.com/S5vqbbt.jpg  I also cut two 1 foot lengths of 1 3/16"" PVC with a notch for my reels, mounted one to the cooler, and slid the other into the rod holder for now to keep my spinning reel stationary.  http://i.imgur.com/cK6MKDc.jpg"

If you have an opportunity to do so - go paddle a few contenders and test them out."

I have an emotion Grand Slam, but got it before the company was bought out by a plastics company and made cheaply.    If I were going to get a yak now, I'd go with the Ride or the Tarpon from Wilderness systems.  The tarpon is faster, but less stable.  The ride is super stable, but not as fast.  I like many of the boats by Jackson Kayak,  that price tag though.  If ponds and small water,  Ride.  If big water and traveling to fish, tarpon."

Did a lot of digging around to find out what kayaks work for tall guys before picking it up.  [Edit] Your feet will get wet from water coming through the scupper plugs, as will your butt (doesn't happen to my much, much lighter wife).  Wet feet doesn't bother me, I tend to hang my legs over the side while drifting, and I bought scupper plugs for the ones underneath the seat."
kayakfishing,37cvm0,Mightbehittingonyou,1 point,Tue May 26 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"If the scupper plugs are put in, does that give it more of a risk of filling up with water like a sit in kayak?  You're a ballsy individual if you're hanging your feet off the side...what if it touches a stick or, even worse...the ground?!"
kayakfishing,37cvm0,blatherdrift,1 point,Wed May 27 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"The Pescador has 8 scupper holes, I only plug the the two under the seat so it still drains.  Touching the underwater grass can be freaky when you don't expect it."
kayakfishing,37cvm0,orphanboyk,3,Wed May 27 16:02:52 2015 UTC,"Sit on top - much easier to rig out, drains water if any comes in, doesn't feel like youi're fishing in a coffin, doesn't get cramped.  That being said - with your weight, you might have water coming in the scupper holes giving you a wet ride, just use scupper plugs (most people do).  I think sit on tops are as stable or more stable than sit inside boats.  Flipping is actually not much of a concern for most people (except folks launching in the surf), I know 100's of yak fishermen, and flipping is a very rare occasion that usually has extenuating circumstances.  Many of the yak guys I know are large guys (I'm in Texas), and they have no problems in your average 12' boats.  One guy is probably over 300 lb, and he uses a Jackson Big Rig.  If you're that concerned about it there are plenty of big stable boats, they're just not as fast.  Do not get pontoons, no one I know that has ever bought them has ever used them more than once or twice before regretting them.  Unless you are fishing for big powerful fish (bull redfish, shark etc.) a fish is not going to move your boat that much.  Electronics typically consist of a fishfinder/battery, these are typically mounted to the boat and won't get lost if you flip (battery will be below deck in a hatch probably).  As for your gear, you'll lose anything not attached - in spite of flipping once, and losing ~$1200 in gear, I do not attach anything in my boat to protect during a flip, because it is rare enough that I don't worry about.  The 100's of guys I fish competitive tournaments don't either, and we carry 1,000s of $$ worth of gear, so that should give you an idea of what feel the risk is (note that we fish freshwater lakes, not salt, different risks)."

I highly recommend securing everything any time u hit the water. My yak is 36"" wide making it extremely stable.  If you're going to fish oceans then you must have a sit on top. If you take on water in a sit inside, you'll be literally swimming with the fishes."
kayakfishing,37cvm0,LovelyTurret,2,Tue May 26 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was referring to ""losing everything"" more of as I flip the yak and get everything wet. I worded it kind of awkwardly...haha. I don't really plan on taking it into the ocean but will be on a semi busy lake 90% of the time. Definitely not the ocean but I'd rather not lose it and have it sink.  Sit on tops just don't look nearly as stable as the sit insides but I assume that I'm wrong in that instance and will concede to your knowledge as I'm uneducated in the kayak field! I'll have to give a few a try.  Thanks for the info!"
kayakfishing,37cvm0,Bland251,2,Tue May 26 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"I have a Native Slayer 14.5' it is a sit on top with a ton of space for you legs, the seat is elevated, and can be lowered to increase stability. I have fished out of a lot of different kayaks and this is so far the most stable boat I have used, and I owned a wilderness commander and still own a native ultimate which are some of the most stable boats available. I can also fit a 40 quart cooler in the storage area behind the seat with room to spare which is awesome for me since I catch pretty big red fish most of the time and my old 20qt wasn't cutting it"

I didn't want to do this initially, I just didn't realize I had bought the wrong size ram ball for my Lowrance, so I made due with my rail mount I had sitting in the garage.  It was actually really nice because it sat right at eye level so I could always see it.  I'm sure you could do a ram extension bar otherwise, in the long run that's probably what I'll do, today was just to get out and test it out on an easy lake :)"

I also have a 70 pound fishing buddy chocolate lab I want to take with me on smaller lakes for fun :)    I will say I have the upgraded boonedox rudder, which really alleviates the only problem between the 13 and the 10 which is turning radius.  This thing turned very well and handled great, I even got it up to almost 5mph at one point testing it out.  I was able to maintain 2.5mph without even realizing I was doing work too, very low impact on the knees and very easy to maintain speed.    And the reverse is no ****ing joke, if there was anything that really impressed me, it was the free drifting with forward and reverse to hold my drifts.  Even when I over-peddled, I could just stop by going in reverse and hold my spot.  Really did make my afternoon super easy on the water."

kayakfishing,36zwv4,Madesofspades,2,Sat May 23 15:48:39 2015 UTC,"I started off with a WS Ripper, an 8' kayak that they don't make anymore. Although it is stable you are constantly wet/sitting in about an inch of water. I now use a WS Tarpon 100 and it is definitely my kayak of choice. I think 10' is about the minimum you can realistically get away with. I am land locked so the ocean isn't an issue, if you read the forms the salt guys will tell you that 12' is the minimum for the ocean.  I had both a 10' sit-in and 10' sot and prefer the sot, although the sit-in was lighter I found that I had all my fishing gear laying on top of my lap because there wasn't enough room behind the seat. The inside/shell storage of the 10' sot makes it much more manageable although this is probably model dependent.  Also if you poke around the forms you will see lots of big kayaks strapped to little cars so I think it can be done, my problem is more storage than transportation.   Good luck!"
kayakfishing,36zwv4,orphanboyk,1 point,Sat May 23 16:50:05 2015 UTC,I agree with this guy. It's not like you're putting the kayak inside your car. The weight difference is probably only about 25-30th pounds.

A kayak is probably going to be lighter, more maneuverable, and more portable. I find paddling a kayak to be easier than a paddling a canoe, too.   You can buy a kayak already outfitted for fishing and drop it in the water as soon as you get out of the store. Not so much with a canoe.   Now, if you ever want to use a motor, you might want to get a canoe. You can get a square back canoe and attach a trolling motor or even a small outboard. There are ways to do this on a kayak, but it seems ... too weird.   I've never been to Minnesota. Isn't that the Land of 10,000 Lakes?"
kayakfishing,36xd0q,human_cannonball,2,Sat May 23 00:30:56 2015 UTC,"10,000 lakes and still hard to find a good fishing spot from shore. Like, seriously, everything is either private land or just not a great spot.  I can't imagine I'll want something with a motor, not unless I get my own dock or a regular buddy to go with.  Still, that was exactly what I wanted to know about kayaks vs canoes. Any starter boats you suggest?"
kayakfishing,36xd0q,human_cannonball,1 point,Sat May 23 03:26:23 2015 UTC,"Lots of good suggestions in this thread. For a $500-$700 budget, the world is your oyster. I got the Field & Stream Eagle Talon for $400 at Dick's. You could get that, a paddle, a PFD and still have money to burn."

Taking a piss much easier even.  If budget allows look at Nucanoe vids on youtube IF you want to be able to stand. There are other sit on top kayaks that are stable enough to stand on.  All that said, I have a sit in kayak and love it. But I do someday want to get something like the Nucanoe and add a motor to it for when I want to get to a fishing spot far away or fast. I'd rather be fishing than paddling."

kayakfishing,36xs6o,potatoboat,2,Sat May 23 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"If I go after work, I usually don't travel more than 30 minutes away.   Success depends. Usually, I try for something challenging like bass or walleye. If I don't hit anything, I'll go for panfish.   I love using topwater baits on calm water at dusk. Nothing like a strike on a spook or a jitterbug or a buzz bait. Then you pack up, head home and sleep well."
kayakfishing,36xs6o,human_cannonball,1 point,Sat May 23 00:38:52 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for the answer. How long do you go out for after work? 2-4 hrs or longer? Also since you fish fresh water do you feel that yak fishing hinders your ability to catch certain types? I'm always successful with bass etc but pan fish not at all
kayakfishing,36xs6o,human_cannonball,3,Sat May 23 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"Don't feel it hinders me at all. Just the opposite in fact.   I usually get home about 5 and I'm out the door by 5:30. I'll stay on the water till about 8, home by about 9.   If I'm smart, I'll pack everything the night before and go straight from work. That will give me an extra hour or so.   Early to bed, early to rise, fish all day, make up lies ;)"
kayakfishing,36xs6o,orphanboyk,1 point,Sat May 23 01:09:22 2015 UTC,"Like the other have said I find fishing after work awesome, I usually grab a sandwich on the way out of town and am on the water by 5:30 or 6:00.  This usually give my 3 solid hours on the water. Where I live the water is usually very calm at night and the sunset and surroundings are amazing, especially in stark contrast to the office you just left.  Just before and after dusk, around 8:30 in these parts, the big fish come up from the deep to feed on the sholes and the fishing is amazing - I fly fish so as soon as it gets dark I tie on a big fly on a sinking tip and hope I don't break off.   If you ask around at work or look up a local fishing club you might be able to find a fishing buddy or two - most people can break away one night a week for fishing - the weekends are harder because of kids activities and you wife wanting to go to home depot."

I work a mile east of my house, and the gulf is about a mile west. If I get home at five pm, I'll get home, change, and be out on the water from 6 til 8:30 or so.  I love getting those couple hours in. Go home, and relax afterwards, and zonk out. If I wasn't so close to the water, I would not load my yak up and drive for more than a little bit. Just wouldn't be able to get enough actual fishing in.   On my days off, I try to head out by sun up, and if nothing is going on, head home early evening. Those long days are once every week or two."

That was my biggest complaint with it, it was a decent starter boat until I got my jackson. Have you checked your local craigslist to see if you could pick up a tarpon or other more expensive boat in the same price range? I see kayaks like cars, buying a used model can get you a lot more boat for the money. Let someone else pay retail for you."

Pelican made a lot of garbage for many years, and the animosity they built up from it follows them to this day.  The sit on tops for the last 2 or three years have been ok.   Look around and find the kayak you want.  Don't limit yourself to the 550 mark.  If you see one you like a lot more and its like 750, save the cash till you got it.     However, if the pelican is what you want, go for it.     ----Side note :  I'm still not a fan of the sit in pelicans, they seem to be leftover designs from years back and are not worth the cash."

kayakfishing,36paoc,Bozorg55,3,Thu May 21 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"I don't have a fish finder, nor have I ever used one. But I like the idea of it.  Can you explain what we're looking at here?  If I have to guess, we're looking at water of a 6.4' with a temp fo 70.5.  The top image looks like a thermal view and I see the images between 2' - 3' feet as bait fish? With larger fish the 5' depth?  The bottom image like sonar (again, I know nothing about this) but it really looks like two fishes around 5' and some sort of shrubbery on the bottom.  Am I close?"
kayakfishing,36paoc,t3abagger,3,Thu May 21 03:08:58 2015 UTC,I would like to hear this explained as well.
kayakfishing,36paoc,vdubgti18t,1 point,Thu May 21 04:26:07 2015 UTC,I will third this request!
kayakfishing,36paoc,Tonyv1487,3,Fri May 22 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"So to explain a bit.  The top screen is showing Chirp sonar on High setting.  This type of sonar shoots out a cone under the boat, so if I'm at 6ft deep the cone diameter at the bottom is 6ft.  The screen will show any fish inside that cone. My understanding of chirp is that it sends out multiple sonar beacons and is suppose to give you a clearer picture and better target separation.  The problem I'm seeing is that because the kayak is moving slow or just drifting, the fish appear like the ones shown in my image at 5ft.  If I switch the sonar over to 200khz I see the fish as arches because the sonar beacon is pulsing at a slower rate.  Another interesting thing I've seen with sonar is if the fish continues to swim and remain under the boat it can appear as super long line since the fish is constantly being reported.  The bottom screen is showing downscan at 800khz.  This image sort of works like MRI.  Instead of a cone view this takes quick vertical slices under the boat which helps with finding structure.  Seeing a down tree with branches is much clearer on downscan than on sonar.  Seeing fish on this screen is usually hard as they appear as little white grains of rice.  Hope this helps explain a bit.  If anyone else has more specific questions I'll do my best to answer."

kayakfishing,36kq52,TheManofVirginia,1 point,Wed May 20 12:48:24 2015 UTC,"I bought the excursion 10 about 6 months ago mainly for fishing and paddling with my kids. When I bought it sports authority had it on sale for $200 with a paddle so it was a pretty sweet deal. Ideally its a great yak at a great price. Not uncomfortable but had to buy a butt pad since it only had the back pad. It does have a decent amount of space but if your going to mainly do fishing I would recommend another. In the water it tracks ok and the speed isn't bad either. It is also very lightweight which makes it easy to put on top of my suv in j racks. After having this yak for a while and deciding what I'm really using it for which is fishing, I decided to buy another. Two weeks ago I picked up a pompano 120 fishing sot yak. This boat is amazing for what I'm using it for and comes with a ton of extras. Really you just have to think of your main usage of it and go from there. As for the excursion I still own it for paddling with my kids and it is a great yak for what it is. Just decide what your main usage will be before you make the purchase or you'll end up buying another 6 months down the road like I did."

kayakfishing,36eci2,TRAKTION803,14,Mon May 18 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love night fishing. I can tell you exactly what I did to my old Jon boat, exactly what I'm going to do to my new Jon boat, and exactly what I'd do to a kayak if I were fortunate enough to own one right now. But I'm busy at the moment so give me an hour or two.   Screw it, shouldn't take too long to explain.   Step 1: Go to Amazon.com and type in Super Night LED strip. You're looking for the 5050's, NOT the 3528's or the 5160's (not sure as to the actual numbers of the ones you don't want but DO look for 5050's). Reason being, brightness vs battery draw.   Step 2: Now that you've found the 5050's, you're looking for WATER PROOF!!! NOT water resistant. The strip is 16.4' long and cost about $15. You're gonna be so freaking stoked when you get these hooked up I want you to post pics on here so everyone in this community can see how badass your yak is.  Step 3: Decide whether our not you want the green, red, blue (RGB) or if you simply want one color. If you night fish a lot, you probably already know the effect green lights have regarding attracting zooplankton, which attracts bugs and bait fish, which then attracts the game fish. If not, that's why I went with green on the old Jon and the new. If I had a yak, I might go with an RGB strip with a remote so I could set it up to have the pinkish color inside the boat. If I remember correctly, the pinkish hue is supposedly the easiest light color on the eyes at night. But with rgb's and the remote you can determine whatever color works best for you.  Step 4: Buy them. Don't hesitate, just buy them. Then go to Home Depot and look for 6' long channels in the lighting section that these LED lights slide right into. Come to think of it, I kinda pressed mine in so as not to stress the light strips. You'll likely find them in a box in the middle of the aisle. Buy 2 of those channels.   Step 5: Find a good way that you're satisfied with to attach them to your yak under the boat so they're pointing slightly outward (as in not directly under the boat both so that you can reach them to install after you're on the water and so that you don't scuff them up if you run aground accidentally).   What I did on my old Jon and will soon do on my new Jon is use high quality velcro strips about 6"" long and about every 18"". I put the fluffy soft part on the boat as a semi-permanent fixture and the rough scratchy part on the channel the strips are in. When the weather and water finally wash away the stickiness, velcro is pretty cheap to replace.   You might find that a better way for a yak would be just to attach them with zip ties to a strip of lightweight aluminum or plastic so that you can set them up after you get to your preferred fishing destination and never worry about tearing them up or any of that mess. That's probably how I'd do it, and just hang them over the boat pointing outward and downward.  Step 6: Find a good, lightweight battery that will meet your needs. Probably the lightest of 12v batteries will work. Pretty sure you can get a good one that weighs about 4-5lbs with about 5-7 amp hours for about $40 at Bass Pro Shop.  Step 7: Because you've only got 12' under the boat, you're left with a couple extra feet. Find a way to install it so that it's not going to point up at your eyes, but so that it's illuminating your work area or you're going to need.   Step 8: (probably should have been part of a previous step but anyway) While you're at Home Depot, go get some light gauge wiring. Seriously, you're hardly pulling anything from that battery so it can be pretty small. I used 18 guage. Get some alligator clips. Get some heat shrink or liquid electric tape works alright, just let is set. Hook it all up to test before you go fishing.  Step 9: Go fishing on a dark night. The darker the better. Anchor down under bridges, preferably in the main channels, just before dark and catch the snot out of some fish.  Step 10: Seriously, post some pics to this sub. You'll reap karma and might help others that want to do the same learn from your trials and errors (though there shouldn't be too many errors if you followed these steps).  I'd like to add that you can also find ultra violet LED strips. They're a little more expensive, but they'll pertinacity be worth it if you get a bunch of uv reflective gear like fluorescent fishing line (I like P-line copolymer is my personal favorite) and glow beads and wear a white shirt. Another thing to keep in mind is that Rustoeum marker paint is uv reflective. So, you can spray a little of that on your rod tips and your net or your fish grabbers and pliers and whatnot. You'll be glowing, which makes things like tying on hooks and such so much easier.  Good luck, my fellow fisherman!"

My new boat will look exactly like it too!!! Don't pay this guy's ridiculous prices, but definitely check out the pic of the lit up yak at the link in the description of this video. Bait will be bouncing off the side of your boat. And they're deeper than they look and therefore harder to net than you'd think.

kayakfishing,36eci2,Mightbehittingonyou,6,Tue May 19 03:56:06 2015 UTC,"You get what you pay for.  I've used cheap ebay strips and Supernovas.  By the time I got all the parts and pieces to do the cheap strips, I could have just gone with the supernovas.  The supernovas are a lot more durable and better constructed than some of the cheaper brands.  (also brighter unless you're certain you're getting the 5050).  Be aware that different states have different lighting requirements.  Where I'm at you need a white light visible up to 2 miles and from 360Â°.  Not LEDs.  LEDs are important if you're fishing waters that have a lot of evening boat traffic, they'll keep you visible and from getting hit.  Also helpful in the dark for seeing obstructions in the water and seeing the bank/cover for casting.  A lot of my friends use some cockpit lighting but I think it's a bad idea, it basically backlights your hands so you can't see what you're doing with your hands (they're in shadow and dark).  Yeah, they light up the cockpit of your boat, but you don't ususally need to see the deck of your boat, you need to see to tie knots etc."

kayakfishing,36eci2,tweakerlime,3,Tue May 19 00:52:59 2015 UTC,I did a ton of night fishing in Austin and have to say LED systems are amazing. Those i fished with had the NOVA lighting systems that run along the sides of the boat and can turn blue/green w/ additional cockpit lighting. Made it light up like a christmas tree and made tying knots / swapping lures a breeze. It's also a great safety accessory if you're a die hard like me and want to stay out past sunset and want more visibility than the anchor light LED.

My kayak is stable enough to cast while standing, but I can't manage the current and drift effectively unless I'm sitting down with the paddle across my lap. Of course, it's easier if I'm fishing still water with no wind.   I suppose you could cast and paddle on your knees  if you want more elevation, but that might be kind of awkward in a sit-in kayak."
kayakfishing,36ex9p,one_time_on_reddit,2,Mon May 18 22:22:27 2015 UTC,you should set up an anchor system in order to stand up and fish. No need to become an acrobat.
kayakfishing,36ex9p,blatherdrift,1 point,Tue May 19 02:40:33 2015 UTC,"I have one set up, but I don't use it much. Don't really enjoy dropping anchor, making three or four casts, then weighing anchor, and so on. I keep about 15 to 20 yards of fly line out and just make short casts along the river bank."
kayakfishing,36ex9p,one_time_on_reddit,2,Tue May 19 20:06:25 2015 UTC,Don't be shy to make small adjustments by paddling with your hand. :) it's silly but then again ... kayaks are very responsive
kayakfishing,36ex9p,blatherdrift,1 point,Tue May 19 04:09:38 2015 UTC,I do that from time to time. If I'm just floating along with the current then I can dip the paddle with my left hand to keep straight while casting with my right.
kayakfishing,36ex9p,one_time_on_reddit,1 point,Tue May 19 20:09:11 2015 UTC,I only kayak on stillwater right now because I would need whitewater experience for the rivers near me.   Getting on my knees sound impossible in my kayak haha but thank you.
kayakfishing,36ex9p,ThunderCows,3,Mon May 18 22:28:57 2015 UTC,Second note. Remember kayaks are uber stealthy! Just because you can potentially shoot 30yards doesn't mean it's ideal. Take your time on the approach to hit your spots even if it means getting closer. Unless you fish gin clear reservoirs in a pink boat I seriously doubt you'll spook anything. Lord knows how many times i've drifted over fish and simply spun around and hooked them on first cast.
kayakfishing,36ex9p,blatherdrift,1 point,Tue May 19 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"My kayak is yellow for the front half, red for the back. Fuck."
kayakfishing,36ex9p,ThunderCows,4,Tue May 19 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"the colour wont matter. It's about how you paddle. When you learn to paddle softly, you will not disturb fish."
kayakfishing,36ex9p,blatherdrift,3,Tue May 19 02:56:37 2015 UTC,Too true.  My old man out fishes me in the flats with a MANGO ride135 all the time and mine is camo... Patience and a delicate approach will always win over most things.

kayakfishing,36ex9p,blatherdrift,2,Tue May 19 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"Fly fisherman here. Sadly unless your boat is a tri-hull design there will be a fair bit of wobble casting, especially if your casting perpendicular to the boat. Only advice I can provide is to shorten your casts, learn to shoot your line in 1-2 false casts max and cut out fancy double hauls. Also keep in mind with a sit-in kayak your backcasts will slap the water since you're not elevated. You can use this to load the rod once you get the hang of it and make a psuedo spey cast."
kayakfishing,36ex9p,blatherdrift,1 point,Mon May 18 21:39:19 2015 UTC,"Love me some fancy double hauls but I'll resist. I didn't think about the line slapping the water. I imagine a roll cast wouldn't be much better than a simple behind the back. Also as far as line, do you use a stripping basket or just let it fall in the cockpit?"

kayakfishing,36dj2s,Quentin16564,3,Mon May 18 15:56:36 2015 UTC,If your not worried about drilling I'd think an anchor trolley would give you the most flexibility.  For your sit in you could screw an eye screw at each end of the kayak amd them follow normal anchor trolley diys from there
kayakfishing,36dj2s,vdubgti18t,2,Mon May 18 15:29:47 2015 UTC,"I have recently started running dual anchors and it has been awesome so far. So much better than an anchor trolley.  I have a 5 lb dumbbell weight at the front of my boat and another at the back with the lines ran through a couple eyes up to two cinch cleats near my seat.  When I want to anchor, you just let some line through one of the cleats to drop an anchor, and when your boat is where you want it, drop the other."
kayakfishing,36dj2s,DrRabbitt,2,Mon May 18 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"I have a wildy ride 135, I use the no drill anchor trolley video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDuhYbG-T4Q  I then use a dog leash (24'), I dont typically fish lakes very deep.  Then I use this figure nine carabiner to attach to anchor trolley and then use the carabiner as a tie off for the rope. https://www.niteize.com/product/Figure-9-Carabiner-Large.asp  I use a 5lb window sash weight that I kept from my house remodel."

kayakfishing,36dj2s,blatherdrift,1 point,Mon May 18 22:45:23 2015 UTC,"Anchor trolleys are a pain in the ass to deal with and don't do anything to address your issue of line management and attaching the rope.  Unless you need 50' of rope, cut that back to what you need, I think I use about 35'.  Also, smaller diameter is fine, I think I use 1/4"" and it's mostly cotton.  Next, you need a winder, to keep the rope wound up on when not in use, and they usually float.  Put a small clam cleat on each side of your seat, when you need to anchor, just drop the anchor and slip the rope in the slot - no knots, no rings, no biners, no pullies, no bullshit, just simple.  This will handle the majority of your anchoring needs unless you're in strong wind or current.  Strong wing or current you may need to use an anchor trolley to orient the boat correctly, but at that point, your 10lb plate probably isn't holding."

Plus its badass yellow so I am more visible to idiot boat drivers  Edit: I see you're near Lexington.  I'm in Corbin just south of Lexington and I was looking at that exact kayak a few days ago, I went to Gander in Knoxville. Academy is in Knoxville as well, but they're sold out of Pescador.

Imgur  You need one on both sides, even if you are only using one rod. The RAM rod holders are not shown but they simply screw on/off when you need them. You can also use Scotty mounts, same idea, if you are using RAM balls you need to get the ones with more than 1 bolt, if you only have 1 bolt the first big fish you catch and your rod will quickly spin in the other direction."

Few people have owned both, one guy I know that has claims they're both great with each having it's own strengths and weaknesses.  To specifically answer your question - I pedal a Native Slayer because it's lighter, I like reverse, it paddles like a kayak, and the curves appeal to me more."
kayakfishing,35xtqt,Mightbehittingonyou,2,Thu May 14 17:23:03 2015 UTC,"Well said nativebro, they're both good kayaks with ups and downs.  Both are great."
kayakfishing,35xtqt,BronsonBuster,3,Thu May 14 21:30:02 2015 UTC,If you get the native you will want to get a rudder extension. The stock rudder isn't so great
kayakfishing,35xtqt,DrRabbitt,3,Thu May 14 12:47:51 2015 UTC,i have a revo and my mother has an outback and her bf has the native. the hobie definitely out maneuvers the native but the propel is more of a natural pedaling motion compared to the hobie. you will get used to the pedaling motion of the hobie but it is different than riding a bike. also the way the hobie paddles are designed make it easier IMO to go shallow and move shallow without damage to the pedal system
kayakfishing,35xtqt,MRDEUCE,2,Thu May 14 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"Ill let you know this weekend how the slayer propel goes.  Over long distances trolling which is what I'm doing, the propel is more natural and less stressful on the knees.  With the money I saved vs like a pro angler, I was able to get a nice pfd and a good light paddle for the shallow water.  And reviews for the slayer 13 is that it paddles extremely well.    Edit: and definitely get the rudder if you go propel, it's 60$ well spent and drastically improves slayer handling."
kayakfishing,35xtqt,BronsonBuster,2,Thu May 14 16:19:26 2015 UTC,I own a outback and I have peddled the propel. I felt like the outback handlers better and was all around a better boat. I am not a fan of the propeller because it is easy to mess up. When I accidentally run my mirage drive on to a mud flat they usually don't get messed up. If the drive is bent I just pull them out and straighten on my knee and I'm good to go.   Going backwards really isn't a game changer for me.
kayakfishing,35xtqt,killaskezo,1 point,Thu May 14 12:44:53 2015 UTC,I've tried neither but from what I've seen Native doesn't make their yaks in models as long as Hobie does.  I fish from a Tarpon 160 right now and having used shorter yaks when fishing the bay and the ocean I'd never want to downsize.
kayakfishing,35xtqt,OmwToGallifrey,1 point,Fri May 15 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"Hobie is far better for shallow water. Other than that, no real difference in drive.

kayakfishing,35wcyi,consvntdrevms,2,Thu May 14 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"If I had to choose between the two I would go with the Perception the extra length will be appreciated, especially the space behind the seat.  Once you throw in your tackle box, anchor, rain jacket, lunch you will quickly find you are out of space on the 10 footer, that or you have a tangled mess sitting on top of your legs.   I have had both sit-in and SOT's and I have definitely prefer the SOT's for several reasons. They are way easier to get in and out of both when you are in the water and when you are jumping in/out during launch. If your hook gets stuck on your anchor or on something else on the end of your kayak the SOT is easier to move around on to get to your hook.  You don't have to worry about carrying pump or learning how to self rescue/bail with a SOT and you have dry space inside your kayak. With my sit-in my stuff was always wet, simply from water running down the paddle and into the boat. If you add in the cost of your pump and dry bags and a paddle float (for getting back in) then you are probably looking at an extra $50.   If I was on a budget a kayak I would seriously consider is the Perception Pescador 12 - you can usually find them for around the same price and all of the reviews I have heard are excellent. They are a knock off of the WS Tarpon 120 which is a great all around kayak.  Good Luck."
kayakfishing,35wcyi,orphanboyk,2,Thu May 14 04:29:37 2015 UTC,"I was pretty much set on the Vapor 10 but then I saw the Perception and how it had much more room. I liked the style and weight of the Vapor 10 but the room in the Perception really caught my eye.   I was originally looking at SOTs and thought that's what I wanted. But if I wanted to use a kayak for just paddling out and recreational use, would that be frowned upon with a SOT? It seems like a really dumb question, but I'm new to this whole thing. I don't see why it would be.   Thank you for your help!"
kayakfishing,35wcyi,orphanboyk,1 point,Thu May 14 12:07:51 2015 UTC,"In my area the SOT's are becoming more popular than the sit-in's, probably for all the reasons mentioned, easier in/out, don't need a pump.  For just recreational paddling the SOT works perfect if you are paddling with a bunch of snob's it won't matter, they will most likely be using long/narrow kevlar kayaks and you won't be able to keep up anyway.   As for fitting in what I find more important is color, I was on a small fishing lake with a bright yellow kayak and found that I stood out too much, everyone else was in a dark green/brown boat wearing camo and I was like a beacon in the sun. I have since gone to a desert camo kayak and feel I blend in much more with my surroundings. That being said I am fishing in smaller lakes and rivers where the chance of getting run over by an ocean liner or speed boat is much smaller."

When your back starts to tighten, you can lay all the way back and stretch out, something I couldn't do in my old sit in."

kayakfishing,35q06t,aislin809,3,Tue May 12 16:18:23 2015 UTC,I drove a camry for a while and used those foam blocks and the straps through the cab. Not so bad to be honest. I have a 12 ft sport pescador. I noticed a little damage to the roof after about a year. I also never went more than 45 min out.   Overall I'd say you're fine with that to start. But eventually I'd upgrade if you enjoy the sport enough.
kayakfishing,35q06t,hellisonfire,4,Tue May 12 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"Those kits are all you need. If you want to save even more money, go buy a pool noodle, cut it in half, and use the 2 pieces in place of the foam blocks.  I use pool noodles with my 12ft, 70 pound yak and have taken it on 7+ hour drives with absolutely no issue.  Edit: Also the straps/tie downs that come with the kit probably suck. I'd go the pool noodle route and then buy some Ratchet tie-downs The tie-downs I linked are a bit expensive. I was able to get some pretty high quality ones at a dollar store for $2 each."
kayakfishing,35q06t,The_Mightiest_One,1 point,Tue May 12 17:03:19 2015 UTC,Ratchet straps are really easy to over tighten. They'll easily warp a kayak in heat and on a roof with those blocks you'll run into some trouble if you don't have the blocks lined up over the support of the roof.
kayakfishing,35q06t,kheup,1 point,Tue May 12 23:00:24 2015 UTC,They'll easily warp a kayak in heat   I guess if your Kayak is really poorly made and flimsy.   with those blocks you'll run into some trouble if you don't have the blocks lined up over the support of the roof   Explain?

kayakfishing,35q06t,mmill143,2,Wed May 13 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"These foam blocks work great, if you are worried about scratches you can add a blanket or a couple of towels under the blocks, more for scratches that can occur during placement then movement during transit. Ratchet straps are great but you can over tighten and damage  your kayak so just be gentle, you don't need as much holding power as you might think. On one trip I noticed that my kayak was bending or forming to the blocks because I had over tightened and combined with the heat the kayak it was starting to deform. The shape bounced back once I hit the water but it was an eye opener."

kayakfishing,35q06t,Handbasket_For_One,2,Tue May 12 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Yes they go through the inside. The downside is if you're tall you'll have to position them just so, otherwise they'll bump your head. Also, the ropes/straps will wick in water. Not a lot, but do expect it. I've been meaning to spray them with some kind of waterproofing spray, but have not gotten around to it. Good luck.   edit: I forgot to mention that the kit I purchased came with clips so that the straps don't have to go through your car. Since I was concerned they wouldn't hold and I would lose my kayak I never used them."
kayakfishing,35q06t,brasher,1 point,Wed May 13 14:47:32 2015 UTC,The straps need to run through the car so if it rains during transit you may get a little wet

Just make sure the straps are twisted a couple times to avoid an annoying buzzing sound from the straps vibrating in the wind.
kayakfishing,35q06t,kheup,1 point,Tue May 12 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"I used to have a sedan and transported my kayak on top of my car without a rack, it got the job done but there were some issues. I actually used that exact same kit.   It put very noticeable damage on the roof of my car. (i probably could have avoided a lot of it by being a little more careful) If its windy you're gonna have a hell of a time getting those blocks to stay in place If it rains, water is going to leak into your vehicle, easily fixed with a towel The straps most of those kits come with work but they're cheap and will rot quickly. I strongly advise against using ratchet straps in their place, they're easy to over tighten and if you don't have the foam directly over structural support on your roof it will dent in. NRS makes really good pull straps that do just fine. If you don't have the straps twisted just right and are going over 40 the wind noise is awful."

Your car type is so common what I would reccomend is checking craigslist, junk yards to find a used rack for your car. Real bars are much better and if you see a used car on Craigslist with the rack you can get it for cheap, and junk yards sell used racks for like nothing. Hope it all works and tight lines."

kayakfishing,35o5x1,investthis,1 point,Tue May 12 02:34:32 2015 UTC,I have seen it. Doesn't look half as good to me as the Native Ultimate but I'd fish happily from both. I wonder if they swamp or if it has scuppers
kayakfishing,35o5x1,blatherdrift,1 point,Tue May 12 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"It does have scupper holes. What do you like better about the Native Ultimate? The hull design makes it look much faster, but unfortunately (for me) it looks like a one person."
kayakfishing,35o5x1,spiffyjohnson2000,1 point,Tue May 12 12:33:27 2015 UTC,They do have a tandem
kayakfishing,35o5x1,orphanboyk,1 point,Tue May 12 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"I have a Frontier 12 and it is awesome for freshwater fishing. The flat deck and swivel seats are great and you can easily stand and fish. I have 2 kids that come with me but it also works great when solo.  I previously had an Ocean Kayak Malibu II XL which is a tandem kayak but because you couldn't stand or face each other didn't make fishing that much fun.  If fishing with another person is a consideration then I don't think you can go wrong with the Frontier 12.   I have never had it in the ocean but I don't think that is where the Frontier 12 would excel, it doesn't have a ton of internal storage and the raised seats make you a little less connected in bigger waves.   The only complaint that I have but it is minor is that it is really wide and heavy, these are big pluses when you are on the water but make loading and storing by yourself a pain.  Any of the bigger fishing kayaks will have the same problem, most garages and garden sheds don't have 14' ceilings so storing a kayak over 12' will always have a few challenges."

Then a family issue was brought to mine and my wife's attention, and crushed any extra cash we will have for the next year or so. My choice was a humble pelican 100 SE 10 footer. I guess my dream would be some closer to 12 or 14 feet but that would have been several years down the road."

kayakfishing,35jr1b,TrailChaser,1 point,Mon May 11 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"I got the idea from a guy on a local forum who used a boat winch that's about double the price. I added a few things like the fishing rod and elastic cords to hold up the strap while loading/unloading.  It's nice to not need help or to run around the truck. When I'm not going kayaking I can just winch it all the way down and it's out of sight. If I need to remove it for some reason I just cut a couple of cheap zip ties and replace when I'm ready to use it again.  The winch is pretty fast to tighten up by hand and then I use a bar to snug it down.   I tied the knot to the D-ring side and attached the rod with plastic zip ties.  The lashing winch was only $12.95 on Amazon Prime and the SS D-ring was only about $5.   The lashing winch is really heavy duty and I had to get some 1/2"" bolts and drill a couple of holes in my bed, but I'm happy with the results and it will save me a lot of trips around the truck."

kayakfishing,35ga8e,schmuckmulligan,3,Sun May 10 01:49:57 2015 UTC,So I currently own a pompano 12 which is the same yak as the pescador. I take my 6 year old out with me all the time with his own yak. It's an old town heron jr. It's about 8ft long and on the front of the yak it already came with a built in tow line that I just clip to the back of mine. He will paddle by himself for a while and when he gets tired I just clip him on the back and then go fishing with him in tow. I know yours is younger than mine but it's a super stable and sturdy yak for kids. Good luck with your decision.
kayakfishing,35ga8e,gm83,3,Sun May 10 04:04:51 2015 UTC,Take at look at the West Marine Abaco 13.5. Its a pretty solid tandem 'barge' but can be had for around $600. And many places to mount rod holders. If you look through my history in have some pictures of it up.
kayakfishing,35ga8e,jimmythespider,2,Sun May 10 23:03:13 2015 UTC,native ultimate?
kayakfishing,35ga8e,blatherdrift,2,Sun May 10 01:58:03 2015 UTC,"I thought my kids would like the independence of their own kayak but it didn't seem to work that way.  If they were tethered to my kayak they wanted to be free, if they were free they were stuck in the weeds or off in another direction. In the end I switched to a Frontier 12 which is more like a canoe/jon boat then a kayak.  They can sit facing me or stand up and move around which is a big plus. They can paddle if they want to or we can just sit and chat. Depending on their age being able to help them with tangles and such is easier from the same boat."
kayakfishing,35ga8e,orphanboyk,1 point,Mon May 11 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm a little torn. The upside to the kiddie yak is that I can run that experiment for 125 bucks, but it's money wasted if she doesn't take to it. With the tandem, I'm sinking a lot more money into the prospect, but I've got a stand-able, offshore boat, even if the kid hates it."
kayakfishing,35ga8e,orphanboyk,1 point,Tue May 12 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"Having a big off shore boat is a huge plus, you don't seem to hear many complaints that somebody's kayak was too big.  The Frontier 12 is great for freshwater but I wouldn't recommend it for the ocean. I don't have any experience with the Jackson Big Tuna but it has been designed for tandem and solo action and seems to be targeted for ocean fishing. Just looking at some pics online and you can see people with the seats facing each other, this is a great setup for kids."
kayakfishing,35ga8e,Betaworldpeach,2,Tue May 12 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"You can go offshore on a pescador. I'm about 170lbs and it handles fine, no fear of tipping even in 6ft swells."

I got the rack because it allows me to remove the soft top without you removing the rack. I did a lot of research on racks for jeeps and depending on if you have a soft top for a hardtop that's where your decision will be. You will need to purchase cross bars and attachments for the cross bars separately if you go that route. If not, Kargo offers cross bars for 160 bucks. I then purchased the Yakima sweet roll saddles because I have a 4 inch suspension lift on my jeep that is sitting on 33's. I'm curious as to haw the loading will be with a single person. I'm hoping the sweet rolls will at least assist."

kayakfishing,34zjnw,Betaworldpeach,1 point,Wed May 6 07:36:03 2015 UTC,"My gf bought me the same one for Christmas. I've taken it out 4-5 times.   My rating is: it's ok. I feel like I always seem to be drifting right no matter where the wind is blowing or which way the current is moving. It could be the way I'm paddling but when I stop paddling and start cruising, it tends to pull right for me.  I think also it depends on how serious you are about fishing. I tend to be more on the serious side and I like cool techy gadgets and modifications. I really want an ascend but the bass pro is a little far for me. I'm looking at the Pescador. ~$500 price range seem like the boats I'm interested in.   Some of them however I'm confused with the swivel rod holder placement. A few have the rod holder setup between the legs or around where you knees would be, but some of them have it installed way at the end of the boat by your feet which I feel would be a pain to reach for.. Little things like that I try to be aware of how comfortable I'm going to be in the water."

I'm looking for something I can mod anyway, most of the built in rod holders on kayaks are for spinning rods and I want the swivel holder to hold a fly rod and the hole holder (w/e it's called) to hold my spin rod  Edit: and thanks for sharing your experience with the kayak, maybe I should look at other options"

However it's not that hard to modify and build additions to the Trailerblazer 100. I have these bass pro swivel rod holders but I've been too lazy to install them. Also, I was gonna super glue a rubber mat (tool box liner) or something to keep my paddle from rolling around. I lay my paddle on the edges of the boat over my knees and then it starts to slide down to my feet. I'm fighting the paddle while my lines in the water.. Gets pretty annoying."

Fish the gulf side with shrimp, cut bait, and silver spoons. Should be Ladyfish, maybe some Pompano, trout, spanish Macks, Reds, Sharks, Rays, etc. It's a bit of a walk from the parking lot but not too bad. I've highlighted the parking area and the spot I would fish. http://imgur.com/SEruQ0L  2nd Spot I recommend is the tip of Fort Morgan (a couple miles East of Dauphin island. You have to take a ferry over there. There are some of the biggest bull reds in the world in this area. A bunch of water from Mobile Bay flows through this pass (and with it, a bunch of bait). Redfish and shark line up on and outgoing tide and feast on all the bait coming out of the bay. You'll want to get your bait as far out there as possible. Use cut mullet or other cut bait fished on the bottom, and a 7/0 circle hook. Like I said an outgoing tide is best for this spot.   http://imgur.com/iFteeFf  Good luck. Let me know how you guys do."

kayakfishing,34trx4,Produkt,1 point,Tue May 5 17:15:48 2015 UTC,Do you prefer the plastic jaw grabbers over a net? I'm asking because I find bringing a net with me can be a bit cumbersome but I've hooked into some big pike and the net has come in handy.   Nice jack btw. I hope I can do some ocean fishing in the near future.
kayakfishing,34trx4,Bstpitch,1 point,Mon May 4 14:49:18 2015 UTC,I like the jaw grabbers mainly just for saving space. Never know what you'll hook into out there and the net you'd have to carry would have to be huge. I caught the two jacks and actually had a monster tarpon on the line until he broke the leader. Should have gone heavier.

What they lack are any real innovation like you see with all high end manufacturers; hi-Lo seats, well thought out layouts, rails etc.  what you get is more of something you know is built like a tank, can hold a good deal of weight, and can handle the ocean, depending on model/length you purchase.  For that price I would pick up the stealth immediately just to have it as a solid back up.  If you want all the bells and whistles though, go with Jackson, Hobie, WS, Feel Free etc.  best of luck!"

kayakfishing,34s36h,goatnapper,2,Mon May 4 12:18:28 2015 UTC,I own two predator 13s. I love them but they are not the lightest kayaks. I cartop mine on a Ford Focus so they should work on your Subaru. I think you would be happy with any of the three kayaks you mentioned. All three are good solid fishing kayaks of similar ability. I personally got the predator because i needed a boat that could handle big water and could go from fresh to salt quickly and easily. For example I can throw my salt water crate in the back add a Scotty Rod holder to the mod pod. Add a video camera to the side plate rail and my fish finder and I am ready for striper fishing. Take out the salt water crate and add my fresh water bag and I am ready for bass fishing on a big lake. Pull off the fish finder Scotty Rod holder and a couple of rods and I am ready for a small river or pond. Finally strip it bare and I am ready for fly fishing. Add to that great old town customer service and I think it is a winner.
kayakfishing,34s36h,Noonproductions,2,Mon May 4 14:29:06 2015 UTC,"Do you ever use the predators on rivers? I'm not sure I would actively seek a river, but it would be nice to know I could with that length and weight."
kayakfishing,34s36h,Noonproductions,1 point,Mon May 4 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"I use it in rivers, but nothing with rapids. The 13 has a long keel to keep it straight on large bodies of water. If you are fishing large lakes or rivers, that is the way to go. If you are fishing smaller bodies of water like farm ponds, narrow rivers or are a fly fisherman you might try the predator MX. If you are over 300 lbs, you might try the predator XL or the ocean kayak big game II (ocean kayak is old towns sister company and the big game II has a lot of the same features as the predator with a 600 lb carrying capacity.)  there are some you tube videos of the predator 13 and MX going down a river with a few Rapids if you search for predator kayak."
kayakfishing,34s36h,xINKADDICTx,1 point,Tue May 5 14:16:20 2015 UTC,I've been trying to decide the same thing myself. I think I'm going with the lure strictly because it's very stable and the fact it has a recess below the center console for mounting transducers.
kayakfishing,34s36h,FallenWalls,1 point,Mon May 4 02:42:31 2015 UTC,Take a look at the features they all offer.  They all have great seats and are supposed to be very stable boats.  The Cuda is fishable right out of the package with rod holders. The Predator wi take some work but is extremely customizable. I don't know much about the Feelfree.
kayakfishing,34s36h,senorSTANKY,1 point,Mon May 4 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"I recently bought the Cuda and a friend of mine recently got the Lure. The main difference is noticed is the lure is much more stable, though much slower than my Cuda."

kayakfishing,34oaqy,O_fish_all,1 point,Sun May 3 17:39:54 2015 UTC,youll be fine i think. the one thing that i got a few years ago that works great is a small drift sock. really helps when we get heavy offshore winds. i can stay in pretty close and have a lot more time fishing before i have to paddle back into position.  good luck in the tournament...
kayakfishing,34oaqy,O_fish_all,1 point,Sun May 3 19:23:32 2015 UTC,Thanks I will have to look for a drift sock. I'll have to do research on how to actually learn to use it. Is there a forum out there. I have been on some but not much activity on them
kayakfishing,34oaqy,vdubgti18t,1 point,Mon May 4 14:09:37 2015 UTC,i dont know of any good forums. but with a just a little practice you will easily get the idea of using a drift sock.
kayakfishing,34o8wk,baby_lawyer,5,Sun May 3 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"I bought a Moken 12.5 a couple years ago and Iâm really happy with it.  Here's a picture. This is my first kayak of any kind and I bought it because I got a good deal.  As I've gotten more familiar with this boat and the sport of kayak fishing, I've looked at some of the other brands and I really like the Moken and I'm glad I purchased it.  Hereâs some random thoughts:  I think itâs pretty easy to paddle, but I donât have experience with other boats.  Iâll routinely cover several miles in a day of fishing.  It has the âKing Fisherâ seat, which is not as good of a seat as on the newer Feelfree lures or the Jacksons.  However, I can fish in it all day comfortably with no problems.  Except for getting up to pee, I can literally sit in it for 8 hours straight.    The molded-in handles are great and I use them for a couple things they weren't intended for.  First, they really help me strap it down in the bed of my truck.  Without these handles it would be harder to secure it for transport in my Dodge Dakota with its tiny 6.5-ft bed.   Also, I have a rope that loops the front handle to a side handle, and it lets me drop an anchor (or tie to an overhanging tree) off the side of the boat and slide it to the front of the boat - other brands would require mounting pulleys in the hull to do this.    The rear storage area is made to hold two milk crates behind the seat.  With just cable ties, I created alot of rod holders by attaching PVC pipes to the crates.   I did have to shave some plastic off one of the milk crates to get them both to fit, but it was easy with a PVC saw from Lowes.     Also, the built-in rail system, makes attaching (and moving) rod holders and other things really easy.    I also really like the âwheel in the keelâ.  Itâs a good design and works.  It has two built-in rod holders and a built in paddle holder.  What I like the most about the boat is I havenât had to spend alot of time and money modifying it to suit me.  When I've owned trailered boats, I always end of spending more time working on them and modifying them than I do fishing out of them.  Similarly, owners of other kayak brands have to spend time tricking them out (and drilling into the hull) to get everything in a good fishable state.  I've spent only a trivial amount of money and time doing anything to modify the kayak.  The only thing I have trouble with is standing-up to fish.  Iâm shorter and fatter than you (5â9â and 230 lbs) and I have always had a bad sense of balance, so my body contributes to my problems, but even with a better built person, I think it would be challenging to spend a lot of time standing-up.  They guy that sold it to me said âIf you fish standing up, you will get wetâ.    Is it best kayak made? Probably not, but at $899 in your link, I think itâs a really good deal."
kayakfishing,34o8wk,MadPhatFishKiller,2,Sun May 3 20:29:04 2015 UTC,Thanks you I think you answered everything I had questions about Stability is probably the most important thing for me so I might take a closer look at the lure 11.5 model its a bit wider.  Hey one thing I've been wondering can you store rods in the storage compartment under  the seat
kayakfishing,34o8wk,MadPhatFishKiller,3,Sun May 3 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to stand up, i think the lure will do you better.  But I think it will be harder to paddle.  Yes and no on the storage compartment.  I'm talking about the storage that your legs straddle while sitting down. The way that it comes stock, it doesn't give you access to the interior of the hull.  It's just a small storage area for lures and whatever.  But the guy that sold it to me said you can cut it out and then have access to the interior of the hull.  So for example, if you were trying to get beyond the breakers, you could cut it out and store your rod in there so you don't lose it if your kayak gets swamped in the surf. The lid on the compartment latches down water-tight so if you cut to access the hull, it's still watertight as long as the lid is latched.  I don't have any need for that feature so mine is intact.  If I get a chance I'll try to post some pics of the compartment later."

For last minute ""fishing trips"" I would do any BWCA entry point near a body of water with lake trout, or lake PEPIN. Other options would be HANGING HORN and BEAR lake (no reason for these lakes other then diving by them so many times, wondering if the fishing is good). Also GRINDSTONE lake for lakers if the bdub is too much work. These trips might have to wait till the weekend after opener in reality...  Realistically speaking, I have some lakes in mind that are much closer. BIG MARINE lake if im feeling like a big body with tons of boaters. I know people dont fish for crappie much on opener but I could see myself using a walleye/crappie set up there. NORMANDALE lake if I want to fish for pike while avoiding boaters as well. But most likely, as always, ill be diving through Lakeville hesitating at every stop light, unable to decide on a lake. Ill end up diving out onto gravel roads and settle on MURPHY lake. It sucks. Don't go there. It only has bass blue gills and pumpkin seed, despite whatever the dnr might say."

kayakfishing,34gi9j,rickjamesonjr,1 point,Fri May 1 16:51:18 2015 UTC,Is your main focus is stability you should look at the Jackson cruise 10. It's going to be a little over your price range for new but you may be able to find one used. That boat is super stable and doesn't paddle half bad. You can stand and fish in that boat for sure. The tarpon is a great boat but isn't the most stable.
kayakfishing,34gi9j,tweakerlime,1 point,Fri May 1 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"The ascends seem like great value for the money, but keep in mind that they need some tweaking.  The hatches leak and the rod holder is in a terrible spot.  If you are a DIYer, this is no big deal.  It would be fine for lakes and ponds.  Depending on where you live, craigslist is a great option.  I strongly recommend the kayak/buy/sell/trade group on facebook.  That facebook page routinely offers $1000+ kayaks for a price well within your budget.  Also, it is a very helpful group."

kayakfishing,34g1ls,TomMelee,1 point,Fri May 1 15:32:34 2015 UTC,My thought on placement is the front of the boat gets more severe slaps from waves so I would mount the transducer in the middle or rear.
kayakfishing,34g1ls,Betaworldpeach,1 point,Fri May 1 02:46:53 2015 UTC,Are you mounting through a scupper plug or going over the side of the boat. I agree with mounting it towards the middle of the boat.
kayakfishing,34e3ye,bear_glove,2,Thu Apr 30 12:14:28 2015 UTC,I don't have any experience with Malone racks but you can't go wrong with the j cradle from Yakima. I work at a outdoor retailer and we carry Yakima. Yakima makes quality product and you shouldn't have a single problem assembling or mounting the rack system if you have the correct type of cross bars.
kayakfishing,34e3ye,rickjamesonjr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:20:10 2015 UTC,Have you transported your kayak with them at all? I have factory cross bars now which I believe yakima says are compatible.
kayakfishing,34e3ye,rickjamesonjr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:39:13 2015 UTC,I have before and it's a great product. If you're mainly going alone I really like the j cradle system cause you can somewhat throw your boat up the side of your car. And yes the j cradle systems fit the majority of factory cross bars. Yakima makes high quality stuff and I'm sure Malone does too.
kayakfishing,34e3ye,blackapeescape,2,Thu Apr 30 16:31:15 2015 UTC,I have the Malone stax pro 2. I really like it and it's a great way to take two kayaks for only about $120.
kayakfishing,34e3ye,steakified,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:44:42 2015 UTC,Yeah the price point really has me leaning towards malone unless there's a serious gap in quality between them and yakima/thule.

Second most important is a quality paddle, buy the nicest one you can afford because essentially that is your motor. Rods and reels of course but my suggestion is to wait on rigging the boat until you are comfortable in it."

kayakfishing,34c0mu,KC_Jones,2,Thu Apr 30 03:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think he's/she's referring to what's also called a fish bat. It's literally a short bat (like baseball bat) that you use to knock out fish with teeth, like blue fish, so they don't thrash and injure you. I think they're really only used if you're going to be keeping/eating the fish. Freshwater guys don't need them."
kayakfishing,34c0mu,Bobarhino,2,Thu Apr 30 13:25:07 2015 UTC,"I use one whenever I am going to keep a larger fish that I don't want to beat itself up before I can fillet it.  Salmon, Lake Trout, Steelhead etc.  It is good to bonk them before putting them in the cooler.  Also, there are freshwater fish that can tear you up pretty bad.  Pike and Muskie both have sharp teeth you need to be careful of."

kayakfishing,3412bv,Flotter,3,Mon Apr 27 15:48:40 2015 UTC,I'm floating a Field & Stream Eagle Talon 12' kayak. It performed very well and handled the weather/wind pretty well! It's my first time in a kayak in about 15 years and I love it!
kayakfishing,3412bv,Flotter,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"Would you say it's easy to customize it with accessories and upgrades? And is the plastic hull really thin? I was told to spend the extra money to get a kayak with a thicker hull so that it can be patched in case it gets punctured with rocks. I'd mainly be doing creek fishing and the local creek is riddled with rocks so that's my main concern. Thanks for answering my previous question btw, really appreciate it."
kayakfishing,3412bv,Flotter,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:37:19 2015 UTC,"Not a problem /u/Flotter!  As far as customization, I would imagine it is. I have not yet added anything to my yak outside of my gear, but I do plan on getting rails on the side to mount things in front and behind my paddle base. There is plenty of free/negative space on the boat that you'd be able to mount things onto/into.  As far as the hull goes, the thing feels stable as all hell. I know I ran it over some rocks getting in there (and actually beached myself against it while was throwing towards the fall. Personally, I try to be safe anyways, but it really feels very very solid (it is about 70-72 pounds.)  I do know that there are some high strength silicone coating products that you can put on the bottom of your boat. That way when you are launching, beaching, paddling, or getting over rocks it's scraping the silicone instead of the boat itself. Obviously I don't really know if that is environmentally sound...but you can probably find out!"

Also, when we stay in a condo at perdido, I just bring a steel cable and wrap it through the carry handles and a couple times around the body of the yak, and loop it through the tie down points at the corner of my truck bed, and lock the two ends together with a padlock."
kayakfishing,342il1,JaSkynyrd,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:45:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome. That is a good idea... if it comes to that. I assume you haven't had any trouble. I can also ask the condo people about maybe a storage location. Surely I would not be the only one to leave yaks in car in parking lot. Maybe i just never noticed while down there.  Yea, free lining live bait seems to work very well from what i hear and I would definitely be into that.  What do you mean under a dock light? just any docks? does the light attract fish or something? I am a newbie to coast fishing."
kayakfishing,342il1,JaSkynyrd,2,Tue Apr 28 03:18:40 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem, I'm sure you could chain it to a pipe on the side of your condominium too.  Some docks have dock lights really low, nearly on the surface of the water. People put them there to attract baitfish which in turn attract the big fish. Even if it's not right on the surface, it's still worth fishing under if it's a good bright one."

The best thing I've found for figuring it out is to google ""homemade kayak rudder"" and then look at the image search, you'll see all of the ways other people have done it.   My biggest problem for a rudder on a kayak not made for a rudder was foot pedals, mine are fixed and I'd need to break them or make new ones for them to slide. And then I would no longer have fixed pedals to brace against. So my plan is instead of running my rudder lines to pedals at all, I'll just put stirrups on the ends of the lines to put my feet in. Brace yourself on the fixed pedals and to steer, slip them off the pedals to pull on the lines.  As far as mounting whatever fixture I decide on, I'm leaning towards using jacknuts. If anyone has a better idea that isn't rivets, let me know."

kayakfishing,33mdki,killaskezo,2,Fri Apr 24 03:28:04 2015 UTC,It's a lean bar. Makes it a lot easier to stand up (especially when it's windy). The big rig comes with them standard. I just made mine out of steel conduit from lowes. It's completely removable (except the attachment points) and also folds down when I don't need to use it.
kayakfishing,33l2pg,kleptican,2,Thu Apr 23 11:54:49 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what type of fishing you want to do and where you want to do it. The redfish is a solid boat, and has been around for a long time. I don't know anyone that recommends stand up fishing in it. I don't know anyone that has the Hobie quest. Most of the Hobie owners around here have the outback or revolutions with a few who own the pro angler. The advantage to the Hobie's in those models are the mirage drive. None of the people I know with them really stand on them. (Stand up fishing is not super popular in New England) I would add one more boat to look at if you really want a stand up boat. The Wilderness ride 135 is being sold by a local dealer for $800. That is a solid boat and very capable of stand up fishing."
kayakfishing,33l2pg,Noonproductions,2,Thu Apr 23 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  Hobie is a solid boat but the quest is a round bottom. This means it is alot more tipsy and furthermore w/o runners along the bottom it gets blown around in the wind. I also know from experience (father owned one) that the cockpit is rather confining. Yes you have nice little nooks to place lures etc but you are very much IN the boat.   For a happy middle ground price point i'd recommend the WS Ride 135 with older seat. Stand for days, still relatively fast and you have room to spread out and relax while out and about. This boat also uses a trihull design so it can track pretty damn well w/o a rudder vs the hobie which i would label as a must have especially if you are doing coastal fishing w/ winds 15mph +"

I fish in the marshes of Louisiana and it wasn't that stable. If you're looking for a kayak to take out into the ocean maybe dig a little deeper. The redfish was a good boat (for what I was doing) but wouldn't consider it for what you're trying to do."
kayakfishing,33l2pg,orphanboyk,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"Two boats I would consider for your situation are Ocean Kayak Trident 13 and the Wilderness System 135. I have the Wilderness System 115 and you can definitely stand in this kayak. The Tridents you are less likely to stand in but I notice that a lot of the pro guys I follow are using these boats. They have a great cockpit and they are made specifically for ocean fishing and protecting your gear when you launch through the breakers.  These bigger kayaks can be a hassle to store and transport so make sure you keep this in mind when making your decision, nothing worse then trying to stuff a 16' kayak in a 14' shed."
kayakfishing,33l2pg,penubly,0,Fri Apr 24 22:35:54 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with either although the Hobie name means quality.

Thats got me stumped so far."
kayakfishing,33jc1l,TuckerGrover,2,Thu Apr 23 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"Ahhh. Paddle your ass off when you think you wanna drive the hook home. We call it a 'paddle hard hookset.' Watch some kayak trolling videos online and you'll see what I'm talking about. Keith Gelhar does a good job of showing it with trout and salmon. Also, if your rods are too stiff, they won't have enough load to keep the tension on for when it hits. Sometimes in the spring I have to ditch my big rods for lighter gear due to missed hooksets. Also wanna consider rod holder placement and what you do with your paddle once you hook up. I always leashed and then just let it fall to my lap to grab the rod and carry the fight on."

kayakfishing,33j3hu,ItsAllAboutWins,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely prefer the trident over the pescador! The mod pod on the center would he great for in hull storage while fishing, and you'll want to extra stability bringing up big cats in a river. I think the trident would be a bit easier to rig up due to the center hatch it has.   You'll also want the larger tank well storage behind you for a bait cooler or whatever!   Edit: I looked at the trident 13 pretty hard before settling on the Santa Cruz raptor. I do a lot of catfishing in larger lakes and love the combination of speed and stability it has even though I've only had it on the water once, the seat is super super comfy as well"
kayakfishing,33j3hu,greenmen88,2,Wed Apr 22 22:51:24 2015 UTC,The mod pod on the center would he great for in hull storage while fishing...   I love my mod pod.  I can get my 9' fly rod in and out of the boat while on the water.
kayakfishing,33j3hu,tankenka,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I may buy the Pescador for now since it's cheaper and make sure kayak fishing is something I want to continue. That, and my wife said to wait until tax time next year lol   How much better would a 13 ft fo upstream in current as opposed to a 12 ft? Its not a swift current on the river I fish, but its enough to have me doubting I want to paddle a mile or two upstream to drift back."
kayakfishing,33j3hu,greenmen88,2,Thu Apr 23 01:38:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I couldn't tell you how a 12 vs 13 foot handle current, I've never fished in a river! I don't think it'd be a big difference though.   The pescador is a great yak to start in! It holds its value over time almost as well as a name brand yak, and will be easy to re sell if you choose. If you are really wanting a longer boat, check out the peacador 14 from academy (they just made it available) or the prowler 13 from academy. The prowler 13 is basically the trident 13 without the mod pod and the adjustable foot braces, but I think it's a bit less wide. I know a lot of people fish offshore with them, and I know a guy who fishes skinny creeks with it.   The pescador boats are the old, I believe, 2008 model tarpon boats. So they still have the same hull as the new ones, just not the accessories (tracks, seat, etc...) that the tarpons have   Sorry if I'm making you reconsider the pescador, I'm just throwing out some more options to look at before you buy! I did a shit ton of research in a lot of these boats as I was saving up for my upgrade to my brand new Santa Cruz raptor"
kayakfishing,33j3hu,bear_glove,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"I just got the trident and though I haven't paddled it a great deal yet but I'll give my 2c anyway:    Mod pod is awesome as others have stated.  I fish a lot of bridges so being able to store a away rods safely is a nice feature.  The speed is decent and the stability is solid though I have not attempted to stand (waiting on the water to warm a bit).  The seat is lacking.  It has nice back support but no butt support, my legs fell asleep after about an hour paddling.  I am either going to look into a pad (cheap) or a surf to summit seat ($$).  Fishability is also good.  Huge stern tank well for crate, gear, etc, two flush mount rod holders, the mod pod comes with scotty style rod mounts, the fish finder friendly scupper plus the spot for a fish finder, all awesome.  It does lack the gear tracks that Wilderness Systems boats have but if that is important to you for camera mounting than yak attack carries all that stuff.  Finally, the hull deformed a bit after transporting it on my roof racks with ratchet straps.  Most will tell you that this is user error vs a problem with the boat, but just be aware that the hull on these things is more easily deformed than other boats.  An OK rep told me to store and transport in on the gunnels as opposed to the hull."
kayakfishing,33j2dt,XLT_66,2,Wed Apr 22 22:35:47 2015 UTC,"I don't regret my purchase one bit. I bought a future beach trophy 126 5 years ago for Dick's for $299, and paddle and life jacket for another $105. I'm just now looking to upgrade, hopefully to a jackson Coosa. I can sell the trophy 126 for at least $250, maybe $275. Anyway, I've gotten so much use out of my kayak, and it's worked well for my purposes. The good thing about them is that they don't take a nosedive in value after you buy them, you can get a lot of money back out of them when you're ready to upgrade."
kayakfishing,33j2dt,JaSkynyrd,2,Wed Apr 22 23:30:47 2015 UTC,That's actually what I did. I picked up a Jackson Coosa HD today. Haven't had a chance to put it in the water yet but I'm very impressed with the quality.

I think I'm just trying to figure out if I like the Propel system or Mirage system better.  It seems that being able to go backwards would be a nice thing to have when fishing along shores."
kayakfishing,33j2dt,BronsonBuster,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"I had the same dilemma and decided on the propel 13.  I then took the difference between hobie and native and got myself an easy anchor, boga, nice Werner paddle, and just decked it out the way I wanted instead.   A big turning point for me with the propel was its ease of paddling if I had to.  The PA is really wide and tough to paddle.  And if you compare it to say the outback, the yak is more feature filled and goes backwards."
kayakfishing,33j2dt,goatnapper,1 point,Mon May 11 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"Same boat (Perception Pescador 12).  Sure, I'd like to try a pedal boat, but in all honesty, I like the price point and simplicity of the boat I got.  Everything I take fits in my crate, so I just put the boat on my roof rack and throw the crate next to me and go."
kayakfishing,33j2dt,swingr1121,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"Typically I live by the mantra of ""Buy once, cry once"". With kayak fishing though I feel that you get what you can at first. If that means you need to save for a few extra weeks, that's fine. The only thing that I urge is that you get out on the water. Not everyone can save up 2k in a matter of weeks/months. Some people take a bit longer (myself included). This is one of those times when I think that people should just get out and do it."
kayakfishing,33j2dt,ThunderCows,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:15:08 2015 UTC,"I don't regret first kayak as a Ocean Kayak Trident 13. It was originally above my idea price range but I was told when getting into the sport that comfort and performance were key to being happy while out on the water. I am an advocate for doing your homework on a boat and making sure it's price is in your range but unless you feel the experience is both rewarding and comfortable you'll be leaving it in the garage more often than not. Often not the cheaper intro boats will not quite hit this for me so I would encourage to buy the ""quality"" boat over the ""intro"" boats. The yaks don't depreciate at all so you can always sell it!"

I would say stability is top of the line, which was the primary factor why I went with the Raptor.  I have not yet flipped it yet, where-as my first kayak I have flipped it so many times due to unforseen circumstances.  My youtube channel shows a couple videos to check out, but if your a hardcore kayak fisherman, then lookup professor salt on youtube, which rides a raptor.  https://www.youtube.com/omgchaeki"
kayakfishing,33bhoa,Nymphis,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:16:33 2015 UTC,I watched a few of your videos along with Prof. Salt's.  How's the speed of the raptor?  I mainly troll for kings/tuna in 50-60' of water (400-600 yards off the beach) but would like to find something that I would feel more comfortable in to go 1-2.5 miles out for snapper.
kayakfishing,33bhoa,greenmen88,2,Tue Apr 21 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"I usually go out pretty far for crabs, but it wasnt till recently that I have attached a fishfinder that tells me the speed that I am going.  Let me give it a try and comment back on this.  What conditions would you like me to do?  Paddle a set distance and record the knots and average?"
kayakfishing,33bhoa,Nymphis,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't need numbers ;  What was your previous yak?  How does the raptor compare -- how much effort do you have to put in to keep cruising.  I am currently using a moken 10 lite.  While I like it, it is very short and wide... this means it's a barge and I have to put in a lot of effort just to keep moving.  edit -- I really do appreciate your helpfulness!  Always looking for people's hands on opinions before making a (to me) big purchase.  Every forum I have seen people are against trying the Raptor making finding reviews/opinions difficult."
kayakfishing,33bhoa,Nymphis,3,Tue Apr 21 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"I just got a raptor this last weekend as well, and compared to my pelican icon 120, it is loads faster doing just half the paddle effort I used to!

In my Moken, even when I give up trying to keep up with him and go at my own speed I am done after a couple hours of trolling.  I blame it on the short/wide design (not knocking on the Moken by any means) which is just not ideal for what I use it for."
kayakfishing,33bhoa,Peevedkitten,2,Tue Apr 21 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I paddled some 4 or so miles the other day and usually I have a small burn in my shoulders that day, maybe next morning. No burn at all from paddling the raptor!"
kayakfishing,33bhoa,Peevedkitten,2,Tue Apr 21 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have only rode in my family OK Malibu 2XL.  But when riding next to a scupper pro paddling the same speed I am usually 2 kayak lengths behind.  Not sure if that helps any.  Wonder how you can test it, get a different kayak and paddle a certain amount of strokes and see which one went farther?"
kayakfishing,33biv3,TX-SC,3,Tue Apr 21 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"I do both, anchoring and drifting depending on the time of year and whatever is working that day. Works just the same as boat fishing, just can't use as many rods or get to the spots as quick (most times)   I really like having two rod holders in front of me that I can swivel around to different directions, and I may experiment with putting two behind me later in the year. I try to drift with my nose into the wind and spread my rods out, if I'm drifting. If I'm anchored I'll fan cast outwards away from the kayak.   I have also drifted some baits just straight below me reeled a few times just off the bottom and moved super slow with just enough weight to keep the bait at a pretty straight angle   Fishing out of a kayak makes it much easier to fish the shallow flats they cruise in the spring and late at night in the summer! A lot more exciting to get a big one to than in a boat"

kayakfishing,32wekr,Tychosis,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:48:04 2015 UTC,"Could you give me a little information on the finder setup? I am looking to throw one on my Lure but I am totally naive on how to set one up, or use one for that matter."
kayakfishing,32wekr,jdavenp3,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:01:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if OP has the transducer going thru-hull or mounted somewhere, but it looks something like this http://wildernesssystems.ning.com/forum/topics/ride-135-fish-finder-install or this http://palmettokayakfishing.blogspot.com/2011/08/diy-kayak-fish-finder-install-2012.html ... OP's work is nice and clean, though.  Putting a fishfinder on your kayak is pretty simple.  You need a place to mount the display, a place to mount the transducer, and you need to provide power.  I didn't wanna drill holes in my kayak, but luckily she came pre-threaded for plenty of RAM ball-mounts, so one of them holds the display.  As far as the transducer goes, again not wanting to put any holes in my kayak I initially went with the Lowrance scupper mount (http://www.austinkayak.com/products/8561/Lowrance-Kayak-Scupper-Transducer-Mount.html)... but I don't recommend it, it didn't work for me at all because my scuppers are more oval-shaped than round... but beyond that it's really just a bunch of nylon and plastic and you could build something better yourself if you're interested in a thru-scupper transducer.  (Ok I'll say it, it's an overpriced piece of crap.)  Then you have to power the unit.  12VDC, you can buy a battery box and be ready to go or build your own relatively cheaply.  I built my own out of a waterproof box and a couple of feeder batteries, pretty much identical to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kY0FyLhnMQ"

kayakfishing,32ve1n,bamawalt,2,Fri Apr 17 00:57:19 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Quick question for you. I've been looking at picking up the same yak (fs12) from ascend. How do you like it after a few uses. I've ridden in one and really like it but it seems that a lot of people on reddit have been trying to steer people away from the ascends. Any opinion you have on it would be great since I don't know anyone that has the same one I want to buy.
kayakfishing,32ve1n,gm83,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:28:55 2015 UTC,"It's a great kayak from both an angler and recreational perspective. I can honestly say that I don't have any complaints. If I HAD to draw a negative it would be the weight, but at the same time it's very stable; I can comfortably stand in this thing, push pole myself, and sight fish (I'm 170lbs). I've heard complaints on quality, but I have not had any issues.  I'd consider myself an avid fisherman and this thing works great for me. Of course, you can spend big bucks on one of the more ""professional"" angler yaks, but it's not the yak putting fish in the boat. ;)"

There are 100 ways to hook up a fish finder, each has their plusses and minuses. Store them on your ceiling, there are ceiling mount kits, just get one and store them up there. I use a roof rack, which is kind of a hassle when I'm alone.  If you have a pick up, keep them back there.

kayakfishing,32lrjy,Muffinbutton9000,4,Tue Apr 14 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"You're blessed to have some pretty neat water there. A lot of canal systems that hold everything from freshwater bluegill and bass to saltwater snook and tarpon along side exotics such as peacock bass, Oscar, and Mayan cichlid.  Directly south of the airport there is a park called Maceo Park. It has a boat ramp you can use to get into that lake that's part of one of those canal systems. Any one of those fish I mentioned above can be caught in there.  Sorry I can't help you more, I actually live over on the west coast. Since most of the saltwater flats action is relatively similar unless you can manage to figure out biscayne bay bone fishing, I've only made trips to Miami for the exotics that I can't get over here.  If you're on Instagram... Or Vimeo... Look up DJ Dan Decibel. He's a Miami based angler with some awesome videos and a lot of flyfishing skill, and he does a lot of his fishing from canoes/kayaks.

kayakfishing,32hkqm,Enemyboatspotted,8,Mon Apr 13 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"I used to live around there so I might be able to help you out. One of my favorite things to do is go down to Henderson beach before dawn-17000 Emerald Coast Pkwy, Destin, FL 32541. It's usually calm on summer mornings but you may have to walk the yak through the surf. Take a couple of sabiki rigs out past the second sandbar and catch bait-cigar minnows, menhaden, threadfin herring, etc. Hook one through the nose on a king rig then slowly paddle up the beach. King mackerel are ridiculously fun on a kayak. Ask around Half Hitch Bait and Tackle when you get down there to get the right stuff.  As for East Pass, it's pretty sketchy on a kayak. Especially during snapper season when the whole place looks like a boat race. Put in on the west end of the bridge near the coast guard station and work your way around from there. The very end of the west jetty is usually covered in black snapper. Take live shrimp and small circle hooks. You'll have to sort through a lot of small fish to get a limit, but they're worth it.   If you can catch some croakers fish then on the bottom around the bridge on a rising tide. That's a safe bet to catch bull redfish.  Also at the coast guard station you can paddle north and west around okaloosa island and fish the grass flats. Basically west of crab island. My go to is a mirrolure mirrodine. Any color works. You'll pick up some speckled trout, reds, and Spanish around there. Also any Berkeley gulp baits will produce around there.   I wish I could go with you. Tight lines!  Edit for safety: check the tide charts before you go near the pass. If there's a falling tide I'd stay out of there. It can get really dangerous."

kayakfishing,32hkqm,degaman,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:25:04 2015 UTC,This is another spot I thought of. There's a boat launch there you can use. Paddle north to the point on the other side of the intracoastal. If you catch it right it'll be covered in speckled trout. Get there at dawn on a rising tide and you'll get em. Good luck!
kayakfishing,32hkqm,PrestontheGreat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, I was about to reply,  but u/degaman pretty much covered everything.    Personally, I am a fly fisherman, so all of the gear and bait stuff is Greek to me.    However, I can vouch for everything else he said.    I tried to paddle out of East Pass a few years back, but it was an incoming tide, and I couldn't help but give up especially with the heavy boat traffic.    My go-to spots are the flats West of the Coast Guard station, and the flats off of Eglin.    The water is just now warming up to the temperature where the fish are coming back to the flats.  By the time you're here, it should be great.    All long as there is moving water, (incoming tide, or falling tide), the bite should be on.  As long as there's not a full moon while you're here.  If there's a full moon, the fish tend to feed at night, meaning the bite won't be as good as it would have been otherwise.    If you want to try some night fishing, hit up the dock lights in Cinco Bayou.  That normally guarantees some decent sized trout.    Also, if you haven't familiarized yourself with the regulations of fish size, and limit, please read up on them at http://www.myfwc.com Which will also let you know which license you need.  Sorry, being a fly fisherman, conservation is near and dear to me.    Also, any questions, don't hesitate to send me a message.   Good luck!"

kayakfishing,32ck0z,guitarfury,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:18:53 2015 UTC,Is this the lake that you need a 4wd vehicle to get to the ramp?  Did you catch anything?
kayakfishing,32ck0z,willtel76,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:41:33 2015 UTC,I didn't catch anything on this trip but fishing was kind of a side note on this trip.  Last year I only explored the upper portion and on this trip I wanted to go to the dam and then the other arm of the lake.  I've heard that if you go in from the Georgia side that you need a 4wd.  I go in the SC side which is a long gravel road that turns to paved as you get almost to the ramp.  I go in a 2wd F150 but I  see a lot of small cars there that don't have any problems.

It has some many little things that are made for fishermen and convenience. The seat is beyond comfort and my expectations. The stability was a big part for me and it  delivers on what it advertises, I can stand easily  on it and I am a big guy 250  lbs. not many drawbacks, it isn't super fast but is quicker than I expected.

To help narrow it down let us know your price range, bodies of water you'll likely fish, whether you want to stand, paddle or pedal.

kayakfishing,328qgx,bear_glove,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"Right. Anything pedal would be about double your budget for a used boat unless you got really lucky.  However quality yaks can be had in your price range. My experience is limited to wilderness systems and ocean kayak.  My ws ride 115 does everything I need it to do in when it comes to freshwater bass fishing. Pros are the seat, storage capacity  (~500lbs), stability I can stand when it's calm.  Cons: weight it's a heavy sob, speed since it really stable it is also kinda slow.  I can't speak to the 135 ride but I imagine it's the same as the 115 but maybe faster and tracks better. If I were you I'd look on Craigslist or a kayak forum for one. Check local dealers for closeouts or demos. My was a rental and I got it for $400. Someone posted on here that they got a brand new one for ~$800.    tl;dr used or close out wilderness systems ride, paddle before you buy if possible."

kayakfishing,325x20,Mightbehittingonyou,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes.  Depends a bit on the fish and bait.  If it's a single hook bait, and a bass (or similarly big mouth, non toothy fish) I'll lip it.  If my bait has treble hooks, I'll typically use a net, because a thrashing fish with treble hooks in its mouth is dangerous.  In either case, I use the fish grip to hold the fish for pictures or to get my gear ready for measurement/pictures.  If I wasn't taking pictures, net would be all I needed."

kayakfishing,320xpg,RxDaniel,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"Jackson makes some great kayaks. A kayak I would seriously look at for ocean fishing (especially if BTB) would be the Santa Cruz raptor. You can even get the upgraded boat seat (it's literally a boat seat that is super cushioned on the bottom and back) and one of the most stable yaks around, as well as quick.   Edit: wilderness systems thresher would be a good option as well as the tarpon 140 or 160. Not sure on how comfy their seats are, I've heard good things about them though"
kayakfishing,320xpg,greenmen88,2,Fri Apr 10 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"The raptor is a great offshore kayak although it is a bit awkward to paddle at first. I dont own one but I do paddle with someone who more than likely has more time in a raptor offshore than anyone else. The only real issues I've seen were the back hatches. He filled his kayak up a bit with water when we fished on a REALLY REALLY choppy day (tournament). For normal conditions its a great boat.   From what I've been told, the thresher is a lemon. Leak issues and is a tough paddle for offshore. Stability is there but speed and tracking not so much. A tarpon 120 or 140 would be great. The 160 is a little too skinny for my liking.   Edit: I hope my wildy friends dont see this."

kayakfishing,320xpg,gm83,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"Jackson makes great yaks but your really paying for it. Check out the ascend fs12t, pretty much all the same features and a great seat imo.    I'm sorry but I couldn't disagree with you more. The ascend fs12t doesn't have any features in common with the kraken..   if you want to suggest the fs12t to someone with a budget that's only doing rivers and lakes that's fine but don't suggest that kind of boat to someone that could be taking it BTB.  That's just horrible horrible  advice.  Now to answer op if seats are a top priority I think the kraken is the only boat in its class with a framed seat. (Thresher tarpon 140/160 etc...)  now I don't know if the Cuda 14 is considered a big/open water boat but you might want to check that one out.  Then if your budget allows it the PA 14 is a favorite for BTB guys.   Now I will say the ws air pro max seat is a very comfy seat (I have one on my ride 135) but I don't think that it comes on any big water boats and I don't know when the A.TA.K will be released or if its even considered a big water boat.   Hope this helps!"
kayakfishing,320xpg,Devlooper,2,Fri Apr 10 13:00:49 2015 UTC,"x2 regarding the ascend. Its definitely NOT a kayak you want to paddle offshore. There is a track record with leaky scuppers, hatches, and drain plugs.   I paddle my cuda offshore and wouldn't want to take any other boat. The kracken is a nice paddle and is definitely fun to play with offshore. Comfortable and quick. I like it above the PA when it comes to getting through the surf though. The kracken rides over the waves while the PA crashes into them like a battle ship. If you lose your momentum going through the surf then youll be in trouble. Look for a demo days to try out the cuda and the kracken. See which one you would like more."

kayakfishing,31vosz,gm83,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"Never used that brand, but I like a 12 foot yak for fishing. Tracks better, a little faster to paddle and leaves enough room for gear.   I use a native ultimate 12 and I'm just south of you here in Florida. So we fish the same types of water.   Good luck!"
kayakfishing,31vosz,san2122,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:47:15 2015 UTC,Hey would you mind showing a picture or let me know how your kayak is rigged. I just picked up an untimate 14.5 used.   OP: I would look on Craigslist to see what you can find you can get a good deal of you wait a little. And you may be more happy with the 12 footer.

kayakfishing,31shn4,juslen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:30:44 2015 UTC,Very nice. How long is the trailer?  http://imgur.com/HuCDpvt  http://imgur.com/IF6vo4m  Here is my setup. The tongue ended up a bit longer than I wanted. It's  all built off of a 48 x 40 harbor freight trailer.
kayakfishing,31shn4,juslen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:00:13 2015 UTC,Guessing here - @ 10' long.  I'll post a follow up picture that shows the actual longer tongue. My dad went and got the steel piping for me and all we did was drill in the holes to mount it to the trailer and then just installed the new coupling on the end.  I had to do this. I was getting so tired of lifting the yaks ON and OFF the car. My son is only 12 so he's not much help to get them on the roof of the car. This trailer really is easy to deal with.  What used to take me @ an hour or so to get everything loaded now takes maybe 30 mins or less. Best part is that I leave the yaks strapped in place and just push the whole rig into my garage until it's time to back out again.   Good rig you got too.
kayakfishing,31shn4,juslen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:11:18 2015 UTC,Thanks. Yeah I keep mine strapped on the trailer as well. It's  nice  having storage in the trailer and I really need to install some rod holders. What Kayak do you have?

kayakfishing,31rraw,realelabogado,4,Tue Apr 7 17:33:35 2015 UTC,"Could go either way.  Get something now to get on the water, figure out later if you like it enough to spend money on upgrading.  I got a relatively inexpensive (but quality boat) when I started and I've upgrade twice to what I feel is the ulitmate boat, no more upgrading to do, but I don't regret doing it gradually.  In used boats the main thing is to get a quality manufacturer I think, that way it'll be a longer time before you need to upgrade if at all.  The good thing about used boats is you can frequently find a package deal with paddle and PFD, which can save you a lot of money."

kayakfishing,31rraw,KingNickyThe1st,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:30:25 2015 UTC,its standard in the kayak industry to list the weights prerigging (aka only the hull)  vapor 10 is identical to the trip 10 cept the hatch is nicer in the trip. i have the vapor 12 and its weight is listed as 54 lbs but that is just the hull. in actuality the kayak weighed in around 68lbs. the vapor 10 was closer to 60 then it was to 50. I cant recall the exact weight since it wasnt my kayak anyway.  my hobie was rated at 64 but weighed in at about 75 without pedals before i added rod holders and rail system  source: The attendant at the freight depot let me throw them on his scale when i picked them up.
kayakfishing,31rraw,MRDEUCE,3,Tue Apr 7 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"Patience can be a virtue. I started out on a pelican and am happy to be out on the water, but wis I had waited and saved to upgrade to a better boat, which I'm happily doing next weekend!!   Personally, I'd wait for a higher end yak showing up used on Craigslist than buying a used cheaper boat."
kayakfishing,31rraw,greenmen88,3,Tue Apr 7 17:59:35 2015 UTC,outback is a little overkill for freshwater. Revo 11 or 13 might be the better bet for 100% freshwater use. If you demo a hobie you will buy one just be warned ha   IF you want to get on the water quick youll end with a kayak thats usable but youll sacrifice certain things such as comfort and weight.  My first kayak was a vapor 12 angler and it was great but heavy as all hell and had a horrid seat.  i was looking at new kayaks a few months later. if i were to do it again i would have just saved more for a better kayak from the get go.  but if i were buying a kayak for 100% freshwater i wouldnt have got my revo. I would have probably gotten a kayak i could stand up in like the wilderness systems ride 115 or 135 or a jackson coosa. standing up makes fishing a lot more fun.
kayakfishing,31rraw,MRDEUCE,2,Tue Apr 7 19:27:00 2015 UTC,I'm thinking the Eagle Talon on CL for $400. That's a pretty decent deal imo.
kayakfishing,31rraw,gm83,2,Tue Apr 7 20:24:27 2015 UTC,It's spring and time for fishing.  Get a good used yak for now then plan to upgrade when you have the funds.

Varnish, grease gun, grease, disposable gloves, and other random things ~ $60  Then I bought some tools to make my life easier.  17 mm box wrench Torque wrench Electric sander Probably some other crap  Although at times I thought I wasted my money when I was struggling to put it together, I'm extremely happy with it now and glad I did it."

kayakfishing,31ozyg,Guy30,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:45:13 2015 UTC,I understand that
kayakfishing,31ozyg,MookiePoops,3,Tue Apr 7 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"Coosa owner here, love my boat. No real input on the weight thing but I will say taking your Coosa out on bigger water is not an easy task. My Coosa is not the fastest boat on the water, doesn't track nearly as straight as other boats and takes wind like a sailboat.  I typically stick to water with current, where this boat thrives. I stand up in my Coosa all the time, haven't fallen in while standing up yet.   As for a paddle, I went with the Bending Branches Angler. Great for a first paddle. If you have more to spend and want something nicer, look at Werner paddles. Good luck and enjoy!"
kayakfishing,31ozyg,MookiePoops,2,Tue Apr 7 02:56:28 2015 UTC,Being from south eastern pa I would fish a lot on the Delaware river (north of new hope) and I would also fish on lake nockamixon pretty often too. As well as trips to the shore to fish back bays. Is it really that difficult to fish the smaller lakes and back bays?  I don't plan on taking it in massive open water.   I'm not to worried about speed but I also don't want to be a barge either.   Do you have the original coosa or the hd?  Thanks for your help
kayakfishing,31ozyg,tweakerlime,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"I have an original (2013 model) Coosa.   I don't want to be the one to talk you out of a Coosa. I've been on bigger lakes with 5 to 10 mph winds and had my hands full to say the least. Paddling into any wind is quite a struggle due to the high bow of the boat. The hull is made to maneuver with ease, making it not track well. These aren't flaws mind you, they're features designed specifically for the boat.  I've been out in Oregon Inlet on a calm day and had plenty of fun.  My ultimate goal was to get a boat designed for the fishing I love. At some point down the road, I'll buy a Trident or something similar specifically for fishing the tunnels and bridges on the Chesapeake.   I would definitely suggest making it to a demo day and paddling a few different boats and judging for yourself.  Hope this helps, keep us in the loop on what you decide on!"
kayakfishing,31ozyg,bugabob,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"You would be absolutely fine in smaller lakes. However, Nockamixon is huge and you might struggle to get around in that lake, but you do have the ease of just launching in various areas throughout the day, rather than paddling the entire lake."
kayakfishing,31ozyg,greenmen88,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"I have the original coosa and it's kind of a barge.  It's pretty tiring to travel a mile or more in it, even without wind.  On the other hand it's super comfortable and easy to stand in."
kayakfishing,31ozyg,greenmen88,2,Tue Apr 7 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Another similar yak series you should check out are the wilderness systems ride series. The 115 has a 500lb weight capacity, much higher than the cuda. And I hear it's more stable too.   The 135 would be more suited to lake fishing probably because it is a bit longer and tracks better than the shorter 115."
kayakfishing,31ozyg,tweakerlime,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:54:26 2015 UTC,If I go Jackson it's going to be the coosa hd. Which should be fine weight wise for me.

kayakfishing,31mknc,tweakerlime,2,Mon Apr 6 13:44:58 2015 UTC,I'd say (having used both) that a non-scupper-hole cart is better. not extensive experience with the non-scupper but the scupper cart i made is frankly a pain in the ass.   here's a nice simple cart made mainly of PVC. i'd make the whole thing a little taller from the axle and put bigger wheels on it if you're going through sand or mud or other difficult terrain. if you're just always on a nice launch area you're golden
kayakfishing,31mknc,krucz36,2,Mon Apr 6 19:43:28 2015 UTC,I made a cart out of 2x4s and a long threaded rod. I may change the wheels out but for now it works just fine. I had made a cart out of pvc with scupper insets but it broke when my kayak fully loaded so I made this super strong cart instead.  http://i.imgur.com/OBcKsb0.jpg http://i.imgur.com/uf6Ht17.jpg
kayakfishing,31mknc,DustPan55,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is what your are asking but for what it  is worth. I made a trailer to hitch up to my bike from PVC and some harbor freight wheels. I made rods that went through my scupper holes, then acquired a new kayak with a different layout. I wish I had just built a traditional cart in hindsight since I cant use my old cart with my new kayak."

kayakfishing,31jq24,Guy30,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:26:54 2015 UTC,I have limited experience catching smallmouth. The first one I ever caught on my kayak was a small one. Maybe 12 inches. But damn did it fight. It actually dislodged one of the blades on my spinner it shook it so hard. I think one of my goals this year is going to be to hunt down some smallies. What is the kayak that you are in?
kayakfishing,31jq24,juslen,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"Jackson Coosa is the kayak! Ya we split time catching them and largemouth, I've had them completely break a spinnerbait before!"

My grandparents pond was full of them, and decent sized ones, upwards of 40 inches. I caught my frist Walleyes out of my Kayak last summer, they fought impressively considering I expected them to fit the stereotype of reeling in a log. I wear breathable waders when I fish, and I learned the hard way that Walleyes can do some damage when they flop into your kayak."

I'm assuming you went with the transducer arm because the transducer cannot be used in the appropriate scupper hole due to your lighting system. I looked into the lights, they look pretty awesome. Do you plan on doing a lot of night fishing?"
kayakfishing,31jh2d,juslen,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah the lights are going to be strapped on through the ""Transducer"" scupper. I plan on doing a good bit of late night drifting for striper, and fluke this summer, I imagine the underwater lights will make boating and handling the fish more exciting, plus they could possibly make me more visible. There are also quite a few ponds and other freshwater bodies that I would like to night fish near our new house. Then in the winter I plan on heading down to Florida and the lights would would be great for attracting Tarpon for a little light tackle battle, or some fly fishing."

kayakfishing,31hn54,Applesauce55,3,Sun Apr 5 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely get the eagle talon, a 12 foot yak is just as portable as a 10 foot one IMO, unless you are pressed for storage space.   I personally would want to save up and get a much more stable yak with more internal storage and a better seat than the eagle talon. I got a pelican 120 to get me off the bank, and have really kinda regretted not just saving up more and getting a better, and more expensive yak. Just my opinion though."

kayakfishing,31hn54,Southdiver,2,Mon Apr 6 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"If those are the only two you like,  then I'd go with the F&S. You're going to change the rigging and set up anyways to better suit your needs so it's better to start off with a good platform. Think of it this way. Are you ever going to buy another one after this next one? If so why? Why not buy a good quality? One that will last you a long time. That way it's dependable and rigged the way that best suits you on the water. If you're worried about the size and weight, I would build a cart to carry it. I just built one out of pvc pipe that cost me 35 dollars compared to the 100 dollar one in the store. Works just as good and makes the job of transporting it 100% better."

kayakfishing,31drj1,jt0505,2,Sat Apr 4 11:25:20 2015 UTC,I'm super jealous of that seat. I have the same boat with the low seat and that's pretty much the only thing I don't like about it. I put a throw float on there just for a little more padding and to sit up an inch higher.   I installed a couple flush mount rod holders on mine. I was pretty nervous about drilling into my boat for the first time but they turned out really nice.
kayakfishing,31drj1,blatherdrift,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this seat! I also want to put two flush mounts on mine, do you mind telling me how you did yours?"

Sometimes it can be useful when it's blowing upstream on a river.  You can also use basic sailing principles to maneuver.  Sometimes I stand up on my coosa and use my paddle as a rudder.  Just be wary of what nature brings your way when going out

I fish in North Texas, but grew up out west (O.H. Ivie, Amistad, Twin Buttes) so I know the prevailing winds you are referring to.  A wind sock will help create drag and slow you down and makes it possible to drift fish.  I highly recommend an anchor trolley so you can position your boat and keep from turning broadside into on coming waves."
kayakfishing,31b75q,hellisonfire,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I know it is frustrating when bass or crappie fishing in the wind, but it doesn't effect cat fishing to much, as long as it's safe! I think I may get a larger drift sock later on, not sure yet though"

kayakfishing,31809u,TX-SC,2,Thu Apr 2 18:57:39 2015 UTC,I'm a sucker for whatever is bigger and better.  I've got last years model and it fishes just fine.  I do like the accessory rail on the '15 but it's not a necessity for me.  I get by with what I have.    It it were me I'd get a closeout model and put the other $700 into a Micro Power Pole.  That thing is the best accessory I bought for my yak.    Tight lines!!
kayakfishing,31809u,No_God,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:23:10 2015 UTC,I have heard that the hobies were best for deeper lakes and that for shallower water a ride 115 might be better
kayakfishing,31809u,blatherdrift,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"They're extremely maneuverable under Mirage drive, once you get used to it. Extreme shallow water isn't the greatest since you can't use the mirage... They don't paddle that well with a traditional stroke, but I've had good results with a SUP paddle and push pole.  I have a 2014 and see no reason to upgrade since I've already got mine built out the way I want it. You should be able to upgrade the Mirage if you're worried about it."
kayakfishing,31809u,SynfulVisions,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"I've got an Outback 2015, and the seat has changed dramatically from the 2014 model. Not sure about the PA changes but its definitely worth it.   The mirage drive works in about 1 1/2 foot or water or deeper. Its a great way to move around."

kayakfishing,3124og,thatoneguy816,7,Wed Apr 1 14:17:48 2015 UTC,"Craigslist. I've never owned a brand new kayak. Look towards the more reputable names (wilderness systems, ocean kayak, native, Jackson, Hobie, Malibu etc.) you will be much better suited with a higher quality used kayak than you will with most of the kayaks out of the big box stores. If you have a kayak shop in your area that deals in the bigger brands, go in and talk to them. Many of them have demo days that are often free or just a small fee, where you get the opportunity to test multiple boats in one shot. My personal generalized reccomendation would be to target a nice 12 foot sit on top kayak with a focus on seating and comfort. Native is famous for a great seating system and many other brands have followed their lead over the past few years, with integrated seating systems that are comfortable and adjustable as opposed to the old black nylon wrapped lower back killers that are more common on the less expensive brands."
kayakfishing,3124og,BentRods,2,Wed Apr 1 16:24:00 2015 UTC,I have definitely been watching over Craigslist. I check it at least 3 times a day. Haha! I would absolutely jump on a deal for a big name yak if one pops up.

kayakfishing,3124og,goatnapper,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"Really like the fact that the Pescador is based off the older Tarpon model. How is stability? I guess that's kind of depends on the individual,  but comparatively, how would it match up against other kayaks. And the seat? Seat looks similar to the F&S Talon."
kayakfishing,3124og,MurseShark,3,Wed Apr 1 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"I am 6'4"", 225. Can not stand in it, but have never flipped it either. Seat is ok, I can stay out 2 hours or so no problem (after 2 hours I am usually heading home).  The main thing I like about it is the ease to paddle. I tried my friends fs12, compared to that, the perception paddles so much easier and faster."
kayakfishing,3124og,greenmen88,2,Wed Apr 1 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"Stability isn't good at all... I can stand and paddle, but only if the water is really calm and wind nearly non-existent. It's a really solid and nice kayak, it's fast, tracks very well. If stability is big in making your decision then I would look elsewhere."
kayakfishing,3124og,gsuhooligan,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen any reviews that said it has bad stability, at worst I've seen that it is slightly ""tippy"" at first. Tippy wouldn't concern me too much. I've been on some ""tippy"" ass Jon boats and haven't been bothered by that. Haha! But if stability really isn't that great while sitting I will probably look elsewhere."

kayakfishing,3124og,KGoo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"The FS12T is one on my short list. Mainly for the seat. Do you have experience with one? Some opinions say it is much slower than other compatible kayaks. Others say its not that bad. Also, pfd and paddle were on a separate budget. So, the full $650 can go towards the yak."
kayakfishing,3124og,KingNickyThe1st,2,Wed Apr 1 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"I like mine. It may be a little slow, but it's really stable."
kayakfishing,3124og,hami2127,2,Wed Apr 1 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"I have an FS12T, but from the previous generation.  I don't know about the new ones, but mine isn't that slow and it tracks pretty well.  I know the new ones are a bit wider and heavier, but I think that's a fair trade-off for standable-stability, tracked foot pegs and a reachable ""live well""."
kayakfishing,3124og,hami2127,3,Wed Apr 1 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"It's the only kayak I've ever owned so, I honestly can't compare it to other kayaks based on experience. I've looked at the bass pro yaks and I didn't like the weight or the way the finishes looked. The seat was connected by a few screws and the caulking around some areas was suspect. The pescador 12 is a proven fishing machine."

kayakfishing,3124og,chrisflick,2,Wed Apr 1 14:27:40 2015 UTC,Field and Stream Eagle Talon 12. just bought mine and I love it. very stable and at 12 feet it tracks beautifully. the seat is something you'll want to replace down the line but you can pick one up for a decent price.

kayakfishing,3124og,chrisflick,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:16:48 2015 UTC,Another kayak on my short list. The seat issues are the one worry with this one. Exactly how bad does the seat suck? I could possibly be out for 4-6hrs. Would hate to have a sore ass 1 hr into it! Haha! Any short term fixes that might hold me over until I could do a upgrade? At $100 that might be a couple months.
kayakfishing,3124og,dwkfym,2,Wed Apr 1 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"From what I heard you get about an hour out of it before people started to complain that their butt got sore or the back hurt. some quick fixes wear adding a extra form pad under the seat for added cushion. I bought a new seat before I even got the kayak because I heard it was a problem so I never had to deal with the stock seat. but you can pick up a seat with extra cushion from dicks when you buy the yak for as little as 30 bucks that would at least be better until you can save up the money to get a high end one. if you can wait for a bit Dicks usually does big sales on their yaks around April and you can save a ton of money, my dad got his Eagle Talon last year from about 450 on sale, and then use that savings to purchase a nice seat."

kayakfishing,30zu1f,FallenWalls,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:46:46 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into getting one of these right now. My top choices are the cuda 12, coosa, and feelfree 11.5. I would love to know your impressions on the cuda especially the stability on the water and if you were able to stand with ease. Hope you enjoy your new yak."
kayakfishing,30zu1f,Skoomaman,3,Wed Apr 1 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"I own a Coosa and have paddled the Cuda 12 a bit. Depending on the water you want to go on, the Cuda is an all around good boat. The Coosa will limit where you feel comfortable.   For small rivers, the Coosa is amazing. Turns on a dime, stable enough for me to feel comfortable standing and handles rapids with ease.  As soon as you try to get out on any big water, you better pray for no wind. The bow of the boat acts like a sail and takes you wherever it pleases.   The Cuda feels a bit less stable and handling suffers but paddles straight as an arrow and has a lower bow which make casting easier as well as ability to handle some wind.  Crap I want to go fishing so bad right now."
kayakfishing,30zu1f,MookiePoops,2,Wed Apr 1 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I plan on getting out on the water Thursday and Friday. I'll let you know how it handles."
kayakfishing,30zu1f,penubly,2,Wed Apr 1 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"I love my Cuda but the Wilderness Ride with the new seat is pretty hard to beat. The Ride is very stable - more than the Cuda IMHO. As for the Feelfree, if you are planning on using in salt water I doubt that seat mechanism will last long. My .02."
kayakfishing,30zu1f,armsleve,2,Wed Apr 1 01:41:45 2015 UTC,"I have one and can stand up, sit down, and cast while standing with ease. the only worry is that if something does happen i.e. hit a log or something and I do lose my balance it may be hard to regain it without falling in."

kayakfishing,30xpk0,FeedMeCletus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Big name brands when it pertains to kayaks does matter in terms of resale. You can get a fine boat for less money, but for resale your better off with any of the big names, Jackson, Ocean Kayak, Wilderness Systems etc... You did very well and have a nice boat to show for it. You will be able to resell and recoup some of the money when you decide you want something new, and if not you bought yourself a boat that should last longer than you or I."

The only two downsides are weight (the 135 is heavy, assume the 115 would be a bit lighter) and its a bit slow on open water. My son has the Tarpon 120 and it's much faster to paddle (but less stable).  Kayaks are a very individual thing, but for $800 that's a good deal.  Edit - Also, the seat is really good.  I've  been in it all day with no issues."
kayakfishing,30xpk0,AdmiralSkippy,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I took it out already in a little pond next to my house and tried standing, I could stand but was still a little shacky. I didn't even think about the whole secondary balance issue until after I had gotten home and the boat was out of the water, so the shackeyness was all me.    As far as the price, yeah I thought it was too it was actually about $850, but I'm not complaining. I never would have thought I could afford a bat this nice so I lept at the deal."

I also clip a golf towel to the back of my seat to dry my hands off and keep my hands clean when changing lures.  Simple but always useful
kayakfishing,30xpe1,BMorg1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:09:46 2015 UTC,"For a sit in yak you'll need to rethink some of these items like a milk crate. However you can probably get something that performs the same function and still fit inside your yak. As far as essentials, you'll want a place to put a rod (or 2), if the flush mounts are not an option there are others you can drill in or perhaps suction cup. A place to hold your tackle, I have 1 3600 size tackle box and a convenient binder type holder for plastics. Depending on where you fish an anchor might be necessary, if you put an anchor on you'll want to use an anchor trolley or two anchors for the front and back. A stake out pole may help replace an anchor but with a sit in your space is limited. A fish finder is good but I don't need to use one. A good seat is one of the best things you can put money into with a yak. I like to bring pliers, fish grabber, a hand towel, wire cutters, and my camera. If you are limited on space, a PFD that has pockets could help carry all of this stuff. I also keep my skin covered with clothing as much as I can (even if its hot, and it does here in FL)."
kayakfishing,30xpe1,tamago64,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:11:27 2015 UTC,"fish finder was a huge addition for me. milk crate is also great for your tackle boxes.

kayakfishing,30te1p,Produkt,2,Mon Mar 30 15:40:29 2015 UTC,Make 2 kayaks into one  by stacking them and strapping them together through the scuppers. With creative strapping you can transport just about anything.
kayakfishing,30te1p,niatruccam,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"Just an fyi, you should never strap through the scuppers, they are structurally the weakest part of the kayak and you can easily crack your hull by doing that"
kayakfishing,30te1p,niatruccam,1 point,Tue Mar 31 09:34:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks. Did not think it was a problem. I did this to transport my son's yak on top of mine then strapped them both to the roof of my wife's car. I don't think there was much pressure on the scuppers, but I'll look for an alternate solution next time my truck is unavailable."
kayakfishing,30te1p,recompense,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a truck and I've built a rack onto my bed to fit my 3 kayaks and without the rack I just sit them in the bed and strap them down. My biggest kayak is 12 foot and I've driven down major highways doing 80-90 safely. (my wife keeps a cool eye out on all the straps cause she's rightfully paranoid).  How long is the shortest kayak? Could you put the longer ones on top and the shortest in the Santa fe and strap down the back hatch? That's what I would do."
kayakfishing,30te1p,jhulbe,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"I have 2 Trident 13's (13'6"") and the other yak is a Revo 13 (13'5""). Not a bad idea, I might try that"
kayakfishing,30te1p,rcn85,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"I would say yakima kayak stackers or some sort of vertical bars. Strap the middle one in, strap the ones on each end in, and then tie down fronts and backs."

kayakfishing,30u6as,AddictedToFishing,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:59:25 2015 UTC,Hey thanks man! You end up getting it and fishing?
kayakfishing,30u6as,AddictedToFishing,2,Mon Mar 30 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"I'm using the 370 now and it's not bad. But the biggest drawback of it is that it doesn't let you glue anything to it so you can't put rod holders onto it. It doesn't sound like a big drawback but given the combination that you lack rod holders and that it drifts so fast in the wind, you often need to put down the rod to paddle back to the place you were and that doesn't feel too good since you need to place the rod over the edge of the kayak making the rod either slide towards where you're sitting getting in the way of your paddle or it slides to the front where you have ropes attached to the kayak that the hooks gets stuck in.   Honestly, it's not the perfect inflatable kayak for fishing, but if you want an inflatable kayak and you can get this one at a cheap price, I'd say go for it. If you find it doesn't fit your needs you can always sell it or keep it for just kayaking with and save up money for another inflatable that is better aimed at fisher(wo)men.  As soon as I can afford it I'm gonna buy their kayak that is dedicated to fishing instead but until then the 370 is fine."
kayakfishing,30u6as,AddictedToFishing,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Sounds a bit annoying but worth it to get off the shore, does it do much better with an anchor? Or it just spins in circles?"
kayakfishing,30u6as,AddictedToFishing,2,Mon Mar 30 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"It's definitely worth getting. Going out on the water is pure magic.   It will definitely improve with an anchor, attach the anchor at the back of the kayak and drop it down and the kayak will adjust itself so that you are facing away from the wind. Unless the wind switches direction a lot you will face the same direction for the entire time!"

THe only way you'd actually be able to do stairs is with something like http://www.amazon.com/Cosmos-Replacement-Climbing-Shopping-Fastening/dp/B008BXQR32 which uses a set of three wheels that rotate around a central hub.

If yoy don't want a pedal kayak then there's no point in spending the coin on a hobie.  Benefits of a hobie pedal drive would be hands free fishing, trolling seems better in a hobie, speed, and using leg muscle group over abdominal/arms. Good luck with whatever you buy. The thresher by wilderness systems might also be worth a look if you're seeking an open water boat."
kayakfishing,30k4eq,bear_glove,2,Sat Mar 28 03:08:02 2015 UTC,"I second the idea of checking out the thresher kayak. I know lake superior is a big lake, so a kayak that can handle rough water and travel quickly over long distances would be one I would want.   Try looking at the Santa cruz raptors as well.

kayakfishing,30e040,oric1234,2,Thu Mar 26 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately it is a weekly deal. Prices at Dick's that end in .98 are weekly, .97 clearance and .99 everyday. You might get lucky, they went on sale for $350 last May and $400 in June. If that happens again and you can still do the 10% off and gift cards it could be crazy cheap."
kayakfishing,30e040,t3abagger,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:43:27 2015 UTC,You could use the gift cards online? I thought they were only for in-store purchase.   It does sound like an awesome deal!
kayakfishing,30e040,DrRabbitt,2,Thu Mar 26 18:01:34 2015 UTC,"You have to get the e-gift cards specifically. I know some of their physical gift cards are in-store only.   edit: You should check your store's stock right before buying e-gift cards since some stores show ""In Store Purchase only"" and the e-gift cards can only be used for online purchases. The local store switched from ""Pick Up In Store"" to ""In Store Purchase Only"" right after I bought mine."

kayakfishing,30b13h,jt0505,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"I mainly Bass fish from my yak, though I have been gulf fishing as well. There is no rush like hooking into a big red or shark. However, seeing as how I'm a solid 6 hours from any decent gulf fishing, the tug of a 6 lbs. bass on ultralight and light tackle is equally as fun!  The lakes I fish have Crappie, hybrid and Floridas, so I almost always have a Norman Deep N' Tiny in some color tied on one of my poles. This time of year I like anything that looks like shad, or anything light colored. I will typically have a finesse worm for the late spring and summer. It honestly varies on the lake.  One technique I do like to do is back into the bank or close to it, and cast to structure and allow the bait to swim at multiple depths around said structure. The spawn is in full force right now, and pulling momma off her nest can be tough, but jigs and spinner baits seem to always work for a bite or two, especially when site casting in the shallows."

It was a great price but the plastic was thin, to the point that I was concerned the rock-infested waters in my area would puncture the hull and I wouldn't be able to patch it.

It was super cheap. you just replace the line inside with 5/50 cord (para-cord) and your good to go. in fact there is a YouTube link i'll find and post. also to store my anchor i cut a 2.5-3 inch piece of PVC and put it in my milk crate like a rod holder and it fits my 5lb grappling style anchor perfectly.

kayakfishing,2zlmlr,Mightbehittingonyou,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:29:19 2015 UTC,Grainger sells fiberglass poles for about $12-14 a piece. I recommend that for your stake out pole. It will last longer and look better.
kayakfishing,2zlmlr,Mightbehittingonyou,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"I almost never use my anchor trolley, it's a pain in the ass putting a knot in the rope etc. that still has a quick release.  I just have clam cleats on each side of my seat and drop the rope into that, easy, no knot, immediately releases.  I'm thinking about putting clam cleats on the front and back to serve the same function as the anchor trolley.  Also not sure rigging up an anchor trolley with paracord and biners is the best idea.  Good systems have a pulley and shock cord in them to take up slack.  But go for it. 3lb anchor is pretty light, especially in sand where there's nothing to catch on.  On the other hand, you don't have as much of a safety concern with getting caught.  I use a 10lb mushroom and it works great."
kayakfishing,2zlmlr,MRDEUCE,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I have pulleys, I just forgot to mention them. I'm just trying to make everything as safe as possible by using the most common methods I can find. Being new, I'd rather do it standard until I develop a preference than start out thinking I know a better way, you know?  I appreciate the input, I'll look into a heavier anchor as well. Here's to hoping for calm waters this weekend in the mean time..."
kayakfishing,2zlmlr,weldcoman,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:42:09 2015 UTC,"In terms of anchor safety you only have one thing to really worry about, and that's your boat moving too much with a stuck anchor.  Unless you're in pretty good current or strong wind/waves you shouldn't have an issue.  That 3lb anchor won't hold you too tight (unless its a claw anchor and you snag it), so if some strong force moves you, the anchor should come too.  The trolley is really only needed to keep your boat oriented in the right direction (for fishing or safety in current/wind).  Like I said, I rarely use my trolley, I just anchor to a fixed point on the side of my boat (I do have a pretty stable boat thought).  If you're new to your boat you need to be cognizant that the anchor may keep you from rocking a certain way and it can throw your balance off if you're not expecting it."
kayakfishing,2zlmlr,goatnapper,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:01:05 2015 UTC,agreed i only use my trolley on my hobie on swift water . otherwise i tie it directly to my cleat
kayakfishing,2zlmlr,swilkers808,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"It is a fold out claw anchor, and since I planned on using it in inlets/near shore I decided a trolley seemed safer than a fixed position just in case current/winds/boats cause my yak to steer off in a direction I don't like.  I also like the idea of being able to orient myself up/down stream without having to reattach."

kayakfishing,2zjxhz,kheup,2,Thu Mar 19 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"I usually figure 1 mile/hour. Slower if I dedicate more time fishing certain spots. I look for 6 to 7 mile floats per day for a full day float. Although sometimes I find myself paddling to get home before dark. Also depends on where the water is. If it's high, you'll finish faster and vice versa. When we do 2 day floats, we look for 11 to 12 mile floats. That gives us time to screw around a bit. Get out, eat or swim and what not."

I had an almost identical kayak (Native Manta Ray) with a similar issue with low back pain.  As a test I put a small cooler in the seat and sat on the cooler.  The kayak was pretty much impossible to use sitting that high up, way too unstable and difficult to paddle.

The biggest difference between the old Tarpon 120 and the Pescador 12 is the hardware is downgraded on the Perception to make the big box stores' priceline. Of course, the new Tarpon has an updated mold with different top deck. however, the hulls are pretty much the same. Either boat will be a great all-around fishing platform."

kayakfishing,2zbinw,greenmen88,2,Tue Mar 17 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Essentially that. The Tarpon has significantly better outfitting and a lifetime warranty. The Pescador is a trimmed down, older Tarpon with a three-year warranty. The Talon is apparently made in Thailand with a one-year warranty. The price difference isn't just branding."
kayakfishing,2zbinw,askayaker,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:56:50 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the other 2, but the Talon is a solid boat. It is slow but stable. At 6'1"" 230 lbs I could stand in the boat, but I did not feel like I could fish standing out of it. The boat has a lot of features that higher priced boats have, but I feel like I was too big for it. The deck flexed under my weight and after 2 years of heavy use, I ended up cracking the seat pan. The new boats have thicker plastic in that area now, but I would still cut up a pool noodle and use it to reinforce that area. I had that boat in some tough areas and it held it's own in some pretty tough chop, but I would not want to use it in a surf launch location. Depending on your size, you might want to add one more boat to your search. The ocean kayak prowler 13 is a solid boat in the Tarpon price range. If you are in the 150 to 200lb weight range and looking for a bigger water boat that is going to last a long time, that is where I would start, knowing what I know now."
kayakfishing,2zbinw,Noonproductions,-1,Wed Mar 18 04:09:14 2015 UTC,Most people would say branding but there are technical differences you can easily research yourself.

kayakfishing,2z84ny,Forgainst_it,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:26:00 2015 UTC,"I sold mine at the end of the season last year but: I had a half crate (called a magazine rack at Walmart) with two double rod holders screwed to it, on on each side. Over that I had two schwinn bicycle handle bar bags, one on each side strapped to the crate. It held four Plans tackle trays in the crate, and sunscreen, bug spray etc in the bags. I had my fresh water fishing bag strapped to the space between the cargo well and the seat using the attached bungee. I replaced the crappy seat with an ascend sit on top seat from bass pro. That was the best modification I made to the boat. I took the front fishing rod holder out and added a Scotty bait tray which held my fish finder camera mount and another Scotty quick release for the fishing rod holder. I used a lowrance x-4 portable fish finder and the lowrance scupper hole mount for the transducer. The guy who bought it from me added yak tracks and a side mounted fish finder and arm. On you tube look for ""eagle talon kayak"" and ""field and stream eagle talon"" there are a ton of videos that show the kayak."

kayakfishing,2z52kc,tlight,2,Tue Mar 17 00:15:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry, for the late reply. I like the console style just because it compacts everything into one unit, that is removable with just a few twists of 3 knobs. Plus i like that the screen is more elevated on the cellblock, which keeps it more eye level when sitting, which helps reduce glare. If you want close up pictures od my setup i can certainely post some."

kayakfishing,2z5nxg,MedicWeezie,1 point,Fri May 1 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"I have the Trip 10 Angler deluxe and fish small inland fresh water lakes and rivers. This is my first kayak, I use her mostly for fishing ( kayak fishing has become my obsession) but also for general day paddles. A majority of people that fish from kayak seem to prefer the Sit On Top style which seems more suited to the sport, however, if you will be using the boat for more than just fishing I would consider the utility of a sit inside style. The Old Town is really wide and stable in the water, I often fish standing up or sitting on the edge of the boat just behind the seat ( I'm 5ft and 115lbs) many of my much larger and heavier adult male friends have used it for a day and all say they enjoy the roominess and stability of it compared to other kayaks they have used. I've never fished from a SOT style but feel free to ask me any questions."
kayakfishing,2z5nxg,Noonproductions,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"My main concern I had with the angler 10 was the material. I have read a eee reviews that say it gets roughed up quite easily, which concerns me because the lake nearby is sandy/rocky. Do you have any concern with that?"
kayakfishing,2z5nxg,Noonproductions,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"I was worried about damaging my kayak initially but last season I smashed and bashed it into lots of rocks, scraped it over rocks and river debris, dirt and concrete. I hit some barely submerged rocks so hard that my boat came to a complete stop and I was sure I had cracked something..nope, still fine. I cringe every time I hear it grind against something but at the end of the fishing season the boat, shape and hull are all in great condition. Some of the bottom of the hull has small scratches but a quick swipe over it with a blowtorch smoothed them. Polyethylene is reasonably easy to repair, there are some great repair tutorials on YouTube and Instructables.  One of the most important features to be concerned with when deciding on a fishing kayak is comfort and the seat. You will be sitting I'm this little boat for hours, if you are uncomfortable or in pain then it won't matter what your boat is made from b/c you won't use it, or if you do then you won't be able to enjoy it. If you have the opportunity, sit in every boat you intend to buy and try moving around in it, consider all of your fishing gear in the boat with you as well as rods and paddle, cooler..etc."

I have a tandem 12 ft sit on yak and i am so happy with it.  Try your local classifieds and you can score a deal.  Make sure you get yourself a good seat,  makes a big difference.  When used with two people i use the middle space in between to carry my bait bucket, although it can also be towed.  As for lures, always carry a rattletrap."
kayakfishing,2yz8ud,brumaza,2,Sat Mar 14 11:36:46 2015 UTC,"I've never used a tandem solo but I've heard you need to weigh down the empty seat to keep the weight distributed well. I could've heard wrong though. I'd be nervous taking a tandem into water with potential waves for balance reasons.  Definitely recommend SOT for all the reasons already mentioned - more space, better stability, mod-ability, etc. Water spashing into a SOT is not a big deal, but water splashing into a sit-in is a problem."
kayakfishing,2yz8ud,frederick_pooperton,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:17:02 2015 UTC,Would a spray skirt make any difference for a sit in? I found a  Pelican Trailblazer that I really like but I'm also considering the Pelican Boost or Apex.
kayakfishing,2yz8ud,Betaworldpeach,2,Sat Mar 14 18:53:41 2015 UTC,"A skirt would make accessing your tackle or anything else you bring and store in the hull a pain. Sit-on top is the way to go. If you're worried about being cold and wet, wear layers with your outter layer being waterproof. I wear thigh waders, some frog togg pants and a windbreaker for my top layer in nasty weather.   I would also avoid pelican/malibu as they use cheap plastic and the hull is not well designed for tracking or anything besides just floating in a bathtub. Since you're going to be on a river you want something that will track or run straight. You can't go wrong with a 12' pescador, it's affordable, comes from a good mold that tracks straight and has plenty of room for add ons and storage."

All of those kayaks listed will get it done for you, but I would pay extra attention to those where you can easily stand on like the Ride or a Jackson Cuda.  From what I've heard, you can definitely stand on a trident/prowler but it all depends on your balance etc.  I'm a big guy, 6'1"" and 260 lbs so standing in my Malibu Extreme is a daunting task.  Yes you can add outriggers but things can get tight in the areas you will probably fish once in the low country.  If I had my pick right now, I'd go for a 12' Cuda or Hobie outback Mirage (2015 version with raised seat), but I've always loved the Trident 13.  Stalk Craigslist like crazy and you will find a deal one day, but be patient and focus on a quality brand.  Good luck to you!"

From what I have read, shuna if you are a high angle paddler, camano if you are a low angle paddler. I would love to hear from some people using them as well. I am leaning towards the shuna myself."
kayakfishing,2yncbk,NextLevelFishing,2,Wed Mar 11 05:07:58 2015 UTC,"It's a really nice fish, especially for a kayak, but I think it's nowhere near 40lbs. Probably high teens, low 20s based upon 40"" and estimated girth based on your hands being large hands."

You might have to cover a few miles or more.   It can be done and guys do it but you need to be prepared for big water.   Spring and fall they are in close to shore.   Might be some smallmouth action in the rivers near there."
kayakfishing,2ypv29,iainnicol,2,Wed Mar 11 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"Some rules of thumb - if you're going to be in strong current or drifting, don't use a claw anchor, they'll get snagged.  On clear/sand bottoms, use a claw anchor, rivers or places with snags on bottom, use a mushroom type anchor.  I mainly use 3/8 rope on a winder in my boat, keep the anchor line organized and out of the way.  I very rarely use my anchor trolley, I have a clam cleat on both sides of my seat and just drop the line in when I need to anchor, few situation this won't work.  http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/yhst-70220623433298_2270_79163095"

Yea its nice to have all these things and pedal drives and rod holders but you can get by with much less.  Honestly I all but stopped using my fishfinder except in salt and find it makes you focus on your instincts instead of just relying on the graph or some of your numbers.   Also worth noting that anchoring in freshwater can be just as dangerous as salt. and that you should always have a quick release/buoy on your anchor or a knive so you can ditch if you had to.

kayakfishing,2ymcm4,bear_glove,2,Tue Mar 10 23:59:18 2015 UTC,I have one in white camo. I fish the backwater and coastal waters of sw Florida.  It is plenty quick though not very maneuverable.  It is very stable. I've caught everything from small mangrove snapper to 5' sharks in it. I've paddled it in everything from glass flat water to 5 foot waves.   Upgrade the seat and change the plastic inchworms for the seat attachment out to stainless. I like the elevated fishing seat by surf to summit.   Don't bungee a full cooler in the back well. If you do flip you won't be able to right the kayak without freeing the cooler. Always tether your rods and gear.
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,tyrannosaurus_fred,2,Wed Mar 11 01:40:01 2015 UTC,Which seat?
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,zackks,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:10:41 2015 UTC,do you have a rudder on it? can you stand and sight cast if the water is calm?
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,dinsauce,2,Wed Mar 11 01:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a fairly solid boat for standing in. I use mine in the Chesapeake bay and the surrounding inlets and rivers and have no issue standing up if the wind isn't ridiculous."
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,Napaandy,2,Wed Mar 11 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"I paddle a TrIdent 13 in the Pacific here in Northern California. It handles rough wTer andy winds very well. Especially with a rudder. I dive and fish out of mine. I have not stood in mine. I'm 6'2"" and 210."
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,Produkt,2,Wed Mar 11 04:45:31 2015 UTC,"I have one and I fish almost exclusively offshore in south Florida. I think it's one of the top paddle kayaks available. I agree about upgrading the seat (you will be able to paddle for a much longer time without a sore back) and switching the nylon pad eyes with stainless ones. I flipped my kayak one time and they broke off and I lost my eods that were leashed to it. A rudder can help but I don't have one. They are beasts for ramming into and out of the surf, way better than hobies for landing and launching."
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,Produkt,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:26:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. I'm really looking for something that faster and better in current than my ride. The ride is a sweet boat to bass fish but covering distance w any type of current is hard. I'm hoping the trident will be an upgrade in that department.  No local shops carry any to demo. Austin kayak matched a price I found at a shop in Delaware plus free ship and no tax. Saves me gas and ferry money to get it.
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,arahlf,2,Sat Mar 14 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"I liked it so much I bought another. I have 2. If a hobie wasn't $2000 I would buy that but since I can't, I got a trident for $650 off craigslist."
kayakfishing,2ymcm4,arahlf,2,Sat Mar 14 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"I've had a Trident 13 for almost 3 years now.  I think it's pretty fast, definitely stable, and overall am pretty happy with it.  I troll for salmon/trout on Lake Michigan with it, but also go after panfish on smaller lakes as well.  I haven't really done any modifications to it yet really, although I'd like to permanently mount some rod holders in front of me (on the sides though).  The little sockets for rod holders to mount into in the middle panel are inconvenient.  I'm thinking about getting a foot pedal kayak in the next year or so though, because that would make trolling sooo much easier."
kayakfishing,2yl0ri,BentRods,2,Tue Mar 10 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"Very decent largemouth fishing but the primary targets are the inshore saltwater species. Snook, tarpon, redfish and spotted sea trout are the big draw to the area.   Most of southwest Florida is peppered with ponds that hold great largemouth. Many canal systems in the area too, some even connect with saltwater at some point and can create a neat environment where a snook, bass, and tarpon could be caught on successive casts. The best largemouth fishing outside of Lake Okeechobee tends to be in the areas you don't hear about, instead of the larger lakes and impoundments think neighborhood ponds and canal systems.   If you have any more questions or want to know of a few decen resources to help get you started feel free to ask. Myfwc.com has a few decent fishing forecast and fishing related articles at any given time and that's a great starting point."

kayakfishing,2yky66,krowdy203,2,Tue Mar 10 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on what type of boat you use, your height, arm length. Lots of stuff. If you fish from a sit on top with an elevated seat, a longer paddle makes getting the blades in the water easier. If you fish something like a native ultimate, you're closer to the water, so it doesn't need to be as long. I stand up and fish a lot, so like a 240 paddle is good because I can stand and paddle much easier with a longer paddle"

When you stretch you hand as high as it will go, the first knuckles on your fingers should just wrap over the end of the paddle.  I also like a carbon fiber shaft, they are light and strong.  It might help to have one that breaks down into two pieces and can be adjusted for the angle offset of the paddles."

If the river is still running like that this weekend you should scrub your float.  According to the gauge the river is running at almost twice the normal depth and about 4x the CFS.    You said you're not extremely experienced, do you have any swiftwater rescue experience?  You said your buddies are beginners so I am assuming they don't.    What boats are you using?  From the sub I am assuming fishing yaks.  I'm not familiar with that river, but based on the numbers I wouldn't go, and I have a habit of making questionable decisions in the pursuit of fish/adventure."
kayakfishing,2ygyku,tankenka,2,Tue Mar 10 01:04:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I've got a 10ft sit-in kayak rigged for fishing. I've only used it in slow-shallow rivers so I don't I'm going to risk it on a river I'm not familiar with. Plus I don't want to put my buddies in a bad situation.

kayakfishing,2ygyku,Betaworldpeach,2,Tue Mar 10 22:47:04 2015 UTC,At that much CFS a lot of the fishing is going to be washed out on the Doa and you're going to get pushed through fishable water fairly quickly. Wait a few days the CFS will drop down.

kayakfishing,2yf3o9,lydicjc,2,Mon Mar 9 06:53:43 2015 UTC,"Save yourself the trouble and headache. You can purchase a small Reese hitch for a mustang and either purchase a small jet ski trailer or convert one of the cheap harbor freight trailers to haul yaks.  Many people have attempted to circumvent the above with inflatables and end up going with a hard boat and finding a rack or trailer, mostly because you'd have to air it up and down to transport, then there's possible issues with punctures. Not to mention a hard boat is usually a lot drier ride.  Perception Pescador 12 is an excellent SOT kayak to start out with and can be easily had for $500-550 brand new, and are a lot better boat than an Ascend."
kayakfishing,2yf3o9,thelosthiker,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"I've been down the river with a guy in a setup like this.  He hated the oars, and just wore fins to kick with.

kayakfishing,2ycqd7,Betaworldpeach,2,Sun Mar 8 23:59:06 2015 UTC,What do you mean? My kayak rigging doesn't change much when targeting different species. My tackle does. Now when im on the lake trolling for stripers with live bait I use my trolling motor and troll at .7mph....  When I go down the river for trout i paddle and only bring my ultralight poles and rapalas.  Im currently living in the Caribbean and I shipped my kayak here so I do a lot of anchoring or drifting along reefs in search for big game. The most important rigging options I have i think are the rocket tube pole holders on the back. Keeps reels away from water so salt water doesn't get in them. Then the fish finder set up is most important
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,Bstpitch,2,Mon Mar 9 00:09:10 2015 UTC,Do the seats turn? My dad has a two person ocean kayak and I thought someone was gonna get a hook in the face when we tried to take it out. We decided to just fish some power pilings instead.

Ultimate stability for standing and fishing from a kayak. The only other kayak that can compare to this boat is the Jackson Big Rig, but it can't even compare to the range of motion that you enjoy with thr Frontier. The range of options for this boat are endless. What really sold me on this boat is that it was built specifically for fishing by fisherman. If you need any ideas about rigging and options, don't hesitate to ask."

kayakfishing,2ycqd7,Bstpitch,2,Sun Mar 8 22:13:44 2015 UTC,so does this kayak come with scuppers? or can it get swamped?
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,blatherdrift,2,Sun Mar 8 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"Has two near the stern, though the channels in the floor don't help much with smaller quantities of water."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,B0xyRawr,2,Mon Mar 9 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"Not really an issue....  http://youtu.be/GqE7fXnFHz4  Quite honestly, these things don't tip, and if you are in a situation where you're taking water over the sides, you probably shouldn't be out in the kayak in the first place... You'll fall out of the kayak before the kayak swamps. It's a 41 in wide beam, widest on the market."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,orzo56,2,Mon Mar 9 18:25:22 2015 UTC,Accidents happen. I would feel safer in a kayak with scuppers than a nucanoe without one on big water. Same with the Native Ultimate. I still want a native ultimate for falling fishing the marshes and duck hunting mind you because its definitely a much dryer ride.
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,blatherdrift,2,Mon Mar 9 21:09:30 2015 UTC,"Except the Nucanoe DOES have scupper holes and has shown that even when water intake overcomes its self-bailing capacities, the craft still stays above water due to the inherent bouyancy of the plastic and design. ""feeling"" isn't exactly objective evidence.  Edit: The Frontier does anyway; no one should be buying the classic anymore, especially with the newer touring design near-release."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,B0xyRawr,2,Tue Mar 10 01:02:25 2015 UTC,"hahaha okay. I was confused because you posted a video of a nucanoe getting pretty swamped so i assumed it didn't have scuppers. I thought it did because when I asked you said it did, which is great! I think it's way safer ... in open water.... and thats my only point. If you're fishing big lakes scuppers are your friends!!"
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,blatherdrift,2,Tue Mar 10 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, there may have been some reply confusion. That video someone else posted is actually of the Nucanoe Classic, which is not nearly as appealing a craft as the newer Frontier. The Frontier is what the OP bought and includes scupper holes while being far less tippy than the Classic. I wouldn't buy the Classic for anything really, but the Frontier is a solid effort at getting the best of both kayak and canoe worlds (though I do hope they work on a lighter composite for the next iterations)."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,B0xyRawr,2,Tue Mar 10 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yes that is the Classic that was in the video I posted, but the same ability to have a completely swamped and yet functional kayak is applicable to both the Classic and the Frontier. The Frontier DOES have two scuppers, located at the stern of the boat. The point that I was trying to make was that this canoe is super stable. You'll fall out before the kayak well before the kayak is at it's tipping point. If you are taking serious water over the sides of the boat, the scuppers are able to handle drainage quite well."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,orzo56,2,Tue Mar 10 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"The frontier looks nice but the ultimate native looks way nicer. I wouldn't mind having either though, that's for sure."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,blatherdrift,2,Tue Mar 10 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Slayer is the one my heart is after :) le sgihhhh ... what a beastly boat."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,blatherdrift,2,Tue Mar 10 02:48:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not actually affiliated with Nucanoe, though this is going to sound like a sales pitch.   Both are great boats and very different design concepts. I hated how ""hard-moulded"" the features of most fishing kayaks were, as plenty of adjustments need to be made to optimize weight distribution/etc depending on body shape and whatever gear one hauls. The open platform of the Frontier gives you a lot more flexibility, with plenty of people making DIY rowing, steering, or outboard solutions.  It's capable of supporting twice as much weight as the Native and is a full 11'' wider at the widest point. Again, the drawbacks are obvious in weight/speed but as a stable fishing vessel I would take the Frontier (and did). I can go from multi-day solo fishing-camping trip to taking my two younger cousins out for a leisure paddle. Not a lot of other hulls offer that.  I got my Frontier 12 for $500 refurbed, so it was a no-brainer. If I had the money for one of these higher-end kayaks I'd just buy an old Boston Whaler ;)"
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,B0xyRawr,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your comments regarding the amount of open space on the deck of the Frontier and the range of options. This is really a boat designed for being able to stand and fish from. You can literally do 360 degree standing turns in the kayak with ultimate stability.  Iv've fished standing sideways and even towards the stern.   In terms of cost for kayaks i understand that the really is a high introductory price for kayak fishing. The cost of the kayak, rigging and equipment are all expensive. However, there really arent any operating costs other than your time and transportation fuel for using it. It's not like your spending money on fuel for transporting, motor boat, etc..."

After months of looking around researching, it seemed to me this is probably the better kayak for me (im a hefty dude) and from what I've seen, the stability is second to none. Also everything you guys have said kinda confirms to me I made the right decision."
kayakfishing,2ycqd7,B0xyRawr,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:41:18 2015 UTC,"I made the same decision after a year of deliberation OP, though for near-shore fishing. The only real drawback is acceleration and perhaps long-distance paddling (assuming there's more drag in the Frontier than touring kayaks), but really neither of these are in our priorities.  Looking forward to an update once you have the Frontier set up and out on the water."
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,stickipedia,4,Sat Mar 7 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm surprised you didn't pull the kayak up a bit and just left the mass sitting in the water.   I guess me and my buddy are the only ones that just piss off the kayak, a little lean works great without losing balance."
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,boomgoon,2,Sat Mar 7 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"I still don't know why I didn't pull it up further, I always have in the past.  I was just out of it this morning.  I also usually pee out of my yak by standing in it but I've been wearing my waders in the cold weather and I'm too clumsy in those to stand."
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,boomgoon,2,Sat Mar 7 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"I wish I could stand in my kayak. Got a 12ft perception. I usually fish a couple miles out in the saltwater, so I've never worn my waders while out paddling, don't think I'd make it if I fell in. Ha"
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,Amcsdaddy,2,Sat Mar 7 20:24:35 2015 UTC,So awkward in my native ultimate with waders. I need to get done muck boots.
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,shaggrugg,2,Sun Mar 8 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"While I can stand and piss from my Hobie just fine I usually just scoot forward and piss ""in"" the kayak.  The mirage drive opening is pretty handy in this regard."

kayakfishing,2y9e6r,SomethingNicer,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:09:40 2015 UTC,Ahh. I didn't even think of that. I'm in SE Texas so the couple months that the water gets cold (67Â° at the coldest) I just don't go out. Do you wear a dry suit when it's that cold out?
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,boomgoon,2,Fri Mar 13 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"I want to wear a drysuit, but damn things are pretty costly. I rock thermals, warmups, boot socks, boots, hoodie, waterproof gloves, and that super thin fabric rain gear. Keeps me warm and dry and leaves me with the ability to still get the good ole lean piss on. But when it warms up and I'm in the river or the lake, I'll run open scupper and piss on into my foot area all day long."

kayakfishing,2y9e6r,HookedOnJuneau,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:57:20 2015 UTC,It seems to me that kayaking in waders is a bad idea.  Am I wrong in thinking this?
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,Black_Lab,4,Sat Mar 7 23:37:23 2015 UTC,It is not a bad idea and there are plenty of videos on youtube of people jumping into pools to show this. If the waders fill with water the water in the waders is not heavier than the water outside the waders so it will not pull you under.
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,kheup,2,Sun Mar 8 14:58:47 2015 UTC,In fact waders with a wading belt can actually help you because they'll trap air in your waders.
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,jhulbe,1 point,Sun Mar 8 16:04:37 2015 UTC,One of my first time trout fishing I lost my balance in the running water. It was maybe 3ft deep.   My legs floated up beacuse of the air and I couldnt push them down to stand back up. So I just laid there and  floated about 40yards down stream to a buddy who grabbed me and helped me stand up. It was pretty scray but I was able to keep head up just fine. If I was alone I wpuld have hit shallow enough water in about 100yards to stand up.
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,kheup,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:46:05 2015 UTC,That's hilarious. I've never thought about it like that since I'm usually with someone but I guess keeping air in the bottom h.f of your waders could be counterproductive.
kayakfishing,2y9e6r,thelosthiker,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:41:55 2015 UTC,I've wondered this myself.  I only go in calm waters and I never stand or do anything crazy while wearing waders.  I'd like to think that if I ever tip over that I could undo the Velcro straps and wiggle free but I've never been in that situation.  I also always wear a life vest.

Seriously, I cast out a crankbait, put the rod in the front holder and paddle. Sometimes I get pickerel and white perch. I know some of the guys use planer boards and lead core line, but I have no idea how to use that stuff."

kayakfishing,2y5qk9,senorSTANKY,2,Fri Mar 6 18:21:31 2015 UTC,That's a great entry YAK for fishing. Price is a tad high but he's throwing in a fishfinder and paddle so you're pretty set. Looks water ready.  My son has a Perception and it's a very solid boat. The seating w/o scuppers may be an issue but you're butt is getting wet whether there are 10 scuppers or 0 to be honest.
kayakfishing,2y5qk9,deweywebber,2,Fri Mar 6 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Lack of scuppers in the seat is going to get your butt wet, which sucks on a cold day. Also seems like most of the perceived value there is coming from the fish finder which on our coast of Florida is really unnecessary as most of the kayak fish able water is 10 feet deep or less. It's a decent kayak but I personally wouldn't value it around 650. For that price I would pass and try to find something a little better boat wise. If you decide you absolutely need electronics then invest in that later on, you can always find decent deals on older units on Craigslist."
kayakfishing,2y5qk9,BentRods,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"I think that the boat itself is over priced, the accessories while nice, arent why I would buy a yak. Plus, if that fish finder is battery powered, I dont know where you are going to store it. Also as others said, your ass is going to get wet on that boat.   I did a quick CL search in your area, and I think that this wilderness systems tarpon 120 would be a more ideal boat. I love mine. I would try offering them $700."
kayakfishing,2y5qk9,campbjm06,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"I saw that one as well. But since the Perception Pescador is a rebranded tarpon 120, I would probably be better off to just buy a new pescador right? They usually run ~$500"
kayakfishing,2y5qk9,campbjm06,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"True, the Airpro seat on the tarpon would be more comfortable, and it also has the built in rails on the front for accessories. But nuts and bolts design wise the pescador is a rebranded 2012 Tarpon, yes. I have a tarpon and a jackson coosa I got at a pawn shop. The tarpon is a hell of a lot faster, but I can stand and fish in the coosa."
kayakfishing,2y5qk9,dudeman1018,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"FWIW I own an Ocean Kayak Prowler 13 that does have scuppers under the seat, but I always leave the scupper plugs in if Im fishing lakes or inshore. Only time I take the plugs out is if I'm going offshore."

I'm in the Victoria area and will most likely be moving to Corpus Christi in the next couple of months when my wife's job relocates there.   I've been considering making a kayak fishing channel one of these days. Mainly because I don't see enough local brack fishing when I'm wanting to watch some youtube fishing. My motovlog channel already has over 42,000 subs so I sorta know my way around youtube. Had a buddy who doesn't know about my youtube stuff tell me I should film and upload my fishing since I tend to do a lot of talking about what's about to happen and I talk to and about my fish during and after the fight...  I have found that fish either don't mind loud talking, or they actually like it. Contrary to what my dad always told me. lol   Here's a nice Red from earlier this week"

Its the kayak fisherman's dilemma.  I suppose I could throw from a side saddle position, but with the wind/water temperatures being so cold, I'm gonna have to try to get this down in warmer weather.

If it's better pricing that's not going to happen, paddle and pedal boats are only separated in cost by a few hundred dollars right now, I doubt you'll see pedal boats get cheaper than paddling boats.

I've compared it to Hummingbird my fishing buddy has and it out performs it in that aspect.   I like the DSI and I know the 4 is around $400.

They say the redfishing gets worse the higher the rainfall has been around there due to all the freshwater pouring in so maybe ask around to see. I went to a little tackle shop in New Iberia before I made the trek and they were pretty helpful, can't remember the name of it but it's a small town so I'm sure you can pick it out. One thing to keep in mind is that that bay is BIG. The wind kicked up on me while I was out there and it got pretty hairy for the paddle back so be aware."

kayakfishing,2x2r2i,Babyfart_McGeezacks,2,Wed Feb 25 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"What kind of boat, if any, are you using? You can catch trout at The Cove at Cypremort Point. It is the line of rock jetties to the left of the channel that comes from the dock. You can also fish off of the piers at the state park if you do not have a boat. You can catch redfish in the bayous to the north east of the beach at the state park (shark bayou, etc). If you can make it across the Vermillion Bay to Marsh Island, you can catch lots of redfish, flounder, and drum. Just be careful of the weather because it can get pretty rough on the bay. Also, go with someone who knows Marsh Island because there are shallow sections and reefs out there that can give you a bad time. Msg me when you are planning on going and I'll talk to a few ppl about the conditions out there and try to get you some suggestions as to where to fish.

I drifted right over a school of probably 15 over slot reds there a few weeks ago. Launch out of PAC marina and head straight south and start working the shorelines and flats with a 1/8oz jighead with a LSU colored swim bait. Top water works really well down there too"
kayakfishing,2x2r2i,DrRabbitt,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:05:50 2015 UTC,I think we might just take your advice and head down to the PAC Marina instead of Cypremort Point. If you had to choose either here or launching in Grand Isle which would you prefer?

kayakfishing,2wwhor,TrailChaser,1 point,Tue Feb 24 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"I have read where the handholds can fail. It also puts excessive strain on the body of the kayak. Honestly, my plan is to flip them over so they don't collect rain/leaves and rest on 2 2x4's that are lifted. The lifts are only rated for 50 lbs so I was a bit anxious but so far so good. There are heavier duty alternatives but I'm cheap and think these will work for me."

My answer is simple, tournament rules should be the same for all competitors, no exceptions should be made.   ...   Maybe the answer is two divisions, but I don't really like the idea of dividing the kayak fishing tournament community.   ""Don't want to divide the kayak tournament community but if you have arms/legs/back issues and using a small motor helps you enjoy the sport that much easier, you can go fuck yourself."""

Why don't you try and be constructive instead of a jackass."
kayakfishing,2ws0pa,PaneledOstrich,0,Sun Feb 22 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"Definition of a kayak by Websters dictionary: a long narrow boat that is pointed at both ends and that is moved by a paddle with two blades.   He's trying to be purist. If hes so concerned about it being man vs beast he should also want to ban fishing gear everyone uses today. Actually just revert to the hand method like noodling, or require the participants to make a canoe out of a tree themselves with no outside help. Different Kayaks have different hulls, should the more narrower and streamlined be banned as well and only allow ones with a certain amount of drag?  Heres some thoughts that could be reasonable alteration to the rules:  -If it's because people with peddle/motor power can go further then limit the area to what paddle people would generally be limited to.   Actually thats the only thing I could think of, is that they would be able to travel further.   If its something like they don't have to hassle with the paddle while handling a rod: a motor is going to cause the same inconvenience having to either turn around to run it or constantly moving the hooked up levels to operate it. peddle- can go back and forth easier don't see how that can be a huge advantage. Peddle/paddle is going to fatigue someone.   People use kayaks because it's a cheaper, smaller, easy to access places regular boats/wading isn't possible. Some people may not be physically able to paddle that much but still like to get to those areas/the experience. So to me automatically excluding someone from something just because it doesn't fatigue as much is just a piss poor reason. If you're worried about being so fatigued you cant compete with someone who uses their legs (still physical manpower) or motor driven (again, fuck if someone is disabled, they can go fish with their own kind)....maybe you should hit the gym and strengthen your upper body so you don't get fatigued so easily."

Going on your point of giving everyone motors or not, the same should be said about fishing poles or what I said above about the kayaks themselves. Cause itâs the same argument. Maybe im just an asshole for thinking fishing isnât just about myself. I can see some rules to prevent over doing it by turning their kayaks into redneck speed boats, but making it only possible for people to tournament who have been lucky to never have anything bad happen to them? No.   My argument is that people not capable of paddling shouldn't be told they canât participate is messed up. So youâre telling me if someone like in this thread of the guy missing a hand was to show up to a tournament, and had his peddle/motor to help him move in the water since he has one hand, you tell him tough shit?  If so (which it seems is your attitude), you've got problems and need to get off your pedestal."
kayakfishing,2ws0pa,PaneledOstrich,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:22:50 2015 UTC,OMG PaneledOstrich... This comment of yours makes it clear that you either A) have no clue. or B) have some weird grudge against OP.. Get over it already. You're making yourself look like an ass.  The one armed guy in the vid is using HUMAN POWER... Which per OP's opinion would be 100% acceptable in ANY kayak fishing tournament.     My opinion would be that anyone not able to power a kayak by using either their arms or legs would probably also not be safe on the water in a boat by themselves in the first place. Want to make that a little more unsafe toss a motor on that boat.
kayakfishing,2ws0pa,TrailChaser,-5,Mon Feb 23 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"Alright fuck it im done after this comment.   Original comment is what I saw op pretty much saying on his site. The other shit is questioning why not let someone who has a disability do the tournament, since catching fish is what the tournaments is about. While op states he isn't for dividing the community, thats what hes doing because his arms would get more tired than someone with a motor. And the guy with one hand is just an example of the person I was talking about.   You guys see fishing as a marathon, and anyone who isn't in top shape and running should get thrown out. Best example I can say is the springy prosthetic legs. Their have the benefit of not getting shin splints or something, and since thie don't have that muscle to tire out they should not be able to do the marathon. Because y'all just see that aspect of the leg not being tired, even though it's only their since their leg is gone.   To me fishing is like a city 10k. Anyone can take part in it, people with no problems, people in wheelchairs, people with prosthetic legs (people in cars are excluded which would be those capable of running/walking but don't want to put in the effort). Who cares whos taking part in it since it's for fun and everyone should be having a good time and people who want to win can still aim at finishing first.   To make it fit more towards fishing, since it isn't just whoever paddles out to a certain point and back the fastest wins, runners will have to stop certain spots along the route and pick a card from a deck of cards (this is the fishing part). While having knowledge of fishing like general depth and what their eating this time of year is helpful theres alot of luck that goes into it since you can't actually make them bite, you just have to hope your lure is in the right place at the right time. At the ""race"", if you pick say the Ace of Spades you win (this representing a monster bass that would win the tournament). I could probably say this better but I've already written enough.  My point is It's all luck, so no matter if you're in a kayak with a motor or not, sure a a motor could go further but theres no guarantee going further will get more/bigger fish. And with the fatigue in the body, takes this as you want and call me an asshole but I just don't get how someone could tire themselves out catching bass. Catching sharks, 50 lb+ cats sure but bass? Hit the gym honestly. I've been tired from paddling but never to the point I couldn't reel in a fish.   So fuck me for thinking that winning a trophy isn't everything that fishing is about, which I guess im completely bumfuck backwards. Deuces /r/kayakfishing, have fun thinking you're the best fisherman even though you have to exclude someone just because they can move a little faster than you in a kayak since that is the biggest deciding factor in catching fish. God forbid someone with a disability is treated like a normal human being."

Also, to answer your question about the high seat stability,  it does feel more tippy at first (this is from someone who has been in the low seat for a year and kayak fishing with low seats for over 5 years)  but once you realize the secondary stability will catch you you should be fine.  Just remember, where your head goes your body follows so always keep your head in the center of the boat and you should be fine.    I hope this helps!      Edit:  I thought the seat was pricey as well, but I was able to find someone willing to give me an ""upgrade"" discount on the seat so I only paid about $220 shipped for it, and it is such a nice investment, I was only able to use it for a few hours last Sunday, but it is such a different seat and really offers you great support.  The only complaint I do have is its a little awkward to sit side saddle in the kayak now because there are straps that get in the way and when I want to rinse my hands after unhooking a fish its a bit of a stretch to reach into the water with the seat in the high position."

kayakfishing,2wi8tl,steakified,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:40:59 2015 UTC,I have the ride 115.  I really like it it's a little odd because the center tips back and forth but once you tip a little more you hit a stabilizer and you can almost stand on one side of the boat. I'm not sure it's the best option for a big guy to stand on but if you have any balance and can find one for cheap I would recommend it. I bought mine for something like 700$ Also it feels like a yacht compared to other kayaks I've seen very wide and just big all around

kayakfishing,2wdk85,stancedeuros,1 point,Thu Feb 19 01:50:19 2015 UTC,I'd probably negotiate for the seat for ~$40 or find an aftermarket one I like.  How well does the FS12T paddle for you? I've heard them likened to barges and it is a 2 mile paddle to my favorite grass flats.

kayakfishing,2w77if,Sloppy_Twat,1 point,Tue Feb 17 18:36:55 2015 UTC,If you will be trolling a lot then you REALLY want/need the pedal type. Hobbie is the best because of their pedal drive system which is efficient and its design to be able to replace broken parts easily and cheaply.  If you look for one on the used market then try not to buy the older model hobbies because they have some structural leaking problems but all the other models are good to go. You can even buy the kayak and then buy the pedal drive system later.  Good luck

Pescador 12 is almost an exact copy of the Wilderness Systems Tarpon 120.  It accelerates with minimal effort for a sit on top.  Tracks very well.  Doesn't exactly turn on a dime for a 12 foot boat but it isn't bad either.  I went offshore/nearshore fishing a lot on my perception (be very careful on which conditions you go offshore, just general bit of advice)  I didn't want to get a huge kayak for convenience purposes, and I'm happy I had the pescador since I had to paddle a LOT, often against current and through/over waves and surf, for the type of fishing I was doing."

kayakfishing,2vt1t8,Sloppy_Twat,2,Fri Feb 13 22:38:26 2015 UTC,That is weird.  I wonder if its a new addition. The only difference seems to be the lack of rodholders behind the cockpit.  You can install them yourself easily if you get impatient :)
kayakfishing,2vt1t8,chaseisbarber,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:14:38 2015 UTC,You can make any escsdor into an angler model for $35 in aftermarket parts. The angler model is just a regular pescador with two additional rod holders.  Edit: I have been watching the price of pescadkrs for the last couple years and the cheapest I have seen them is on sale for $399 at academy sports and west marine. The cheapest I have seen them in amazon was $419 with free shipping.   Academy regular price is $559 and it is worth it at that price. I paid $599 for mine from academy 4 years ago and I still use it all the time. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made and I should have bought a kayak a long time agp.

kayakfishing,2vp7kw,dwkfym,3,Thu Feb 12 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"Yes but be prepared. Keep your PFD on all the time! If you do fall in the cold water will shock you at first and can make people do crazy things. Avoid wearing cotton clothes the motto for winter water sports is cotton kills.   The most important thing is to make sure you take an extra pair of clothes, matches or lighter, and some sort of firestarter in case you do fall in. Keep them in a dry bag or other dry container so you can be sure they are dry if you need them. If properly prepared winter paddling can be great especially because you don't have to worry about crowds."

If I am sitting I try to do large ovals instead of a figure 8. The one advantage I have noticed when sitting is I can get my bait deeper which helps me when the fish is staying on the river bottom.

They actually rank at the top of their class in overall speed and stability. The reason we choose heritage is because we really use the kayaks intensely. From 300-1400 dollar price range. Heritage is the only yak that has lasted with an avg price point of 600 to 700. Hands down the most cost effective kayak around."

kayakfishing,2v9734,kheup,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:56:09 2015 UTC,If I was doing a guided trip I would definitely pick musky just because you need the knowledge of a guide to catch a fish on your first trip unless you are really lucky.

These two kayaks you have linked are the cheapest I have seen that have any admirable aspects to them.   I think that the Ascend FS12T you have linked is a very respectable looking yak for an entry level cost.  Depending on what you're looking for, the Ascend D10T also looks like a good value.   Both kayaks have the potential for easy hardware upgrades, they both have some area for storage as well as in-hull storage. The FS12T looks to have a more comfortable seat which will become a big playing factor once you start spending a lot of time on the water."
kayakfishing,2v4zpm,halfwaytosomewhere,2,Sun Feb 8 04:29:26 2015 UTC,Pescador 12 is the best best out there in the $500 price range hands down. No joke you can't hardly find one bad review online for the pescador 12 and it is probably the most purchased and reviewed sit on kayak in the united states and maybe the world. Ascends gets some bad reviews and were known to have warping issues when they first came to market.  Pescador 12>every other $500 kayak
kayakfishing,2v4zpm,Sloppy_Twat,2,Sun Feb 8 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you.  I've been searching and reading reviews on a lot of kayaks in this price range.  The FS12T has known issues with the seat, and as a large guy myself, I'm staying away from it.  I don't want to have to fix anything on a brand new product.    Check out the Perception Sport Striker that dick's sells, which is also sold as the West Marine Cayman.  The perception pescador gets rave reviews, but I'm aiming for a kayak that I can stand up in, even if only to stretch out a bit."

kayakfishing,2v4zpm,Fishing_gaucho,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:05:46 2015 UTC,"I just bought the Emotion Stealth 11 for Christmas. It's a really great boat. So far I've had it in the water about a dozen times and I'm only liking it more and more each time. I was actually set on a Wilderness Systems when I saw the Stealth for $385 and checked some videos and reviews... That little wheel on the skeg is also a nice feature.    It's fast, feels great in the seat, plenty of room in the boat. The rod holder is less than great, but a cheap replacement solves that issue. I added a 6"" hatch to the bow area since there is a ton of unusable room up there inside the boat. I've also added a anchor trolley, and a few pad eyes to strap everything down.  I've stood in the boat a couple of times, but it's not warm enough for me to temp fate on a cold windy day so I sit my ass back down before I regret testing things out.  Tracks great and glides really far when you want to get close to the baitfish w/out spooking everything.   Don't fall for the shipping estimate on Cabelas website unless you want to be disappointed. Mine took a solid month to arrive and was passed around to different trucking companies from Utah to Texas like a misbehaving foster child.  Arrived in two massive plastic bags in surprisingly great condition.   First Trout from the new Stealth 11  First Red"

kayakfishing,2uvm8k,killaskezo,3,Thu Feb 5 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"For lakes, rivers, marshes, eat, I think the wilderness systems commander 120 would be a good option to look at. I can stand it it very easily, I hunt duck out of it, I fish out of it all the time, and I can hold a TON of gear in it for kayak camping. The FS128t is very heavy and slow. It's stable and a good sized platform though. But look into the commander 120, it's a great boat."
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,blackapeescape,2,Thu Feb 5 18:24:40 2015 UTC,"The commander is one of the best duck hunting rigs around, great to fish out of but it's duck hunting ability to carry as much as it can and still move through the water fairly effortlessly is ridiculous."
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,kheup,3,Thu Feb 5 20:01:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trade it for a Hobie or anything else just because I love how I can fit so much in it. And it's so damn stable I could have a dance party in it.
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,blackapeescape,2,Thu Feb 5 20:34:21 2015 UTC,yeah my d10t is that stable but moves through the water at half the speed. I'm either looking at getting a commander or Kaku's new Kahuna I'm leaning towards the Kahuna right now just because the design looks awesome and way more customization opportunities
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,kheup,2,Thu Feb 5 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"And the native ultimate. Very similar boats, I've owned both and still use my native all the time. Traded my commander to a friend for a tarpon, which I then sold"
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,DrRabbitt,2,Thu Feb 5 22:36:01 2015 UTC,"I've never paddled the fs128t but I heard it is crazy heavy, crazy slow, the seat isn't very good and not waterproof.  BUT for the price it gives you a lot that other boats can't give you.  I would personally look at wilderness systems ride on ebay.  can be had for close to the same price as a FS128t.  I LOVE my native slayer, much cheaper than the native propel and it has under seat storage.  the jacksons are crazy nice too."
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,robertdilbert,2,Thu Feb 5 18:48:21 2015 UTC,I can't say I've been in/on one since they just got released but if you're looking for something to sight fish marshes look at the Kaku Kahuna. Definitely gonna be the next boat I buy. Its got a paddle board topside so that pretty much allows for as much customization as you can dream up and its much easier on the wallet than Jacksons

kayakfishing,2uvm8k,Mightbehittingonyou,2,Thu Feb 5 22:37:44 2015 UTC,I have a Jackson coosa and I really like it a lot.  But if I could choose any boat it'd be my second choice.  First would be a nucanoe because I fly fish and its hard to cast perpendicular to the boat but I hear you can do jumping jacks in a nucanoe.
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,DrRabbitt,2,Fri Feb 6 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that the FS128 is a very appealing boat because it looks similar to other more costly boats, at a much better price.  However, with rare exception, most reviews are pretty bad.  There was Facebook post a couple months back where a guy went through a bunch of the finish quality issues with these boats, and I've seen a couple posts from BPS employees that talk about the poor quality and high return rates, no manufacturer support or whatever.  As mentioned, they're big, heavy & slow and prone to leaks, but with your ability to DIY, needing a stable platform more than a speedy boat, it may work for you just fine.  For the price of the FS, there's a lot of higher quality used boats you could get into.  Aside from the stability, one of the most important things I learned was that it is very difficult to go from a flat seated position to a standing position, especially with a rod and/or paddle in your hand.  Having an elevated/lawn chair style seat makes it much easier to rise to a standing position and get seated again.  Not sure how your balance is, but if it's questionable at all I'd encourage you to look at boats like the big rig, coosa, diablos etc.  Boats that a lot of guys can stand in with no problems like the Wildy ride and slayers I can't stand in very well at all, too tippy for me (I've got some equilibrium issues though).  If the big rig, coosa etc. are too pricey, go with the FS128, sounds like it'll give you the stability you need and you can upgrade again later."
kayakfishing,2uvm8k,campbjm06,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:42:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the only issues I've heard about are leaking storage and chair problems, that kind of makes me think twice about it."

I got my Jackson coosa from a pawn shop for $450. Like speed_goat said, if you paddled both the Jackson would steal the show. Ample storage, super comfy seat, stable platform, from a company that started out making whitewater boats.  This for example: http://austin.craigslist.org/bod/4839694019.html"

kayakfishing,2us34a,erskipper,8,Wed Feb 4 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"As other have said here, I would suggest you not buy anything for that price. Save some money and get a pescador. They are awesome kayaks. I have two of them. Anything you buy at the 200ish price range is going to be pretty bad. Not trying to rain on your parade, just being realistic giving you a heads up. I went down the road you're on and ended up with an Ocean prowler which i really disliked, sold it and bought two Pescadors with the money and couldnt be happier.  EDIT: Buy, and wear, a PFD. This is more important than your kayak."
kayakfishing,2us34a,Strompy,3,Wed Feb 4 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would advise waiting for a larger budget and grabbing a perception sport pescador 120 or maybe an ocean kayak prowler 13 if you want to save up more.   I started wanting to get a kayak as soon as I turned 16, but I ended up saving and saving until I could get a pescador from my local academy, bought a pelican icon 120 instead because they were out, and got a paddle + pfd. Now I'm wanting to upgrade soon again! But I have more hours and a better paying job at 18 compared to when I was 16.   Save up, and get something you actually want to use! Sure a cheap yak will get you on the water... but a kayak is an investment that could last a lifetime from what I hear!"
kayakfishing,2us34a,greenmen88,2,Wed Feb 4 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"Unless you find an amazing deal on a used one, nothing in that price range is worth buying."
kayakfishing,2us34a,subtraho,2,Wed Feb 4 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"I will chime in here. I bought a $350 dollar kayak and it served its purpose fine. I used it, caught fish, and it's still in good condition. I used it in lakes and rivers.  However, I definitely now WANT a better and more expensive. There are so many positives to the more expensive ones.  To sum up, you can totally enjoy a cheaper kayak and get what you want out of it, however, eventually, you're going to want to upgrade."
kayakfishing,2us34a,DustBorne,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of it depends on the area including water temps.  A PFD is mandatory in my opinion.  The budget you set is at the low end of the ""new category""  you may have better luck looking on craigslist or other used options. Personally I would recommend a sit on top.  Learning curve is much easier I think."
kayakfishing,2us34a,Kardinal_84,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah like a lot of others have said here you are at the low end of the kayak scale.  I would wait and save your money for a better kayak.  Ask yourself a few questions:  Where am I going to be fishing? What am I fishing for? How many rods am I going to be bringing with me? How much weight am I and how much more will I be bringing with me? How much paddling will I be doing? How am I going to be transporting the kayak?  You need to make sure the kayak you buy meets your needs. Most of the kayaks in the $250 range would be fine for small ponds fishing for crappie and bass. (Make sure you don't exceed their weight limit.) You might find them uncomfortable after a few hours of fishing, but for just puttering around after work or school they will be fine. If you want something you can stand in or something for bigger water or carrying more weight, ground $500 you can get a pescadore or an eagle Talon 12' both are decent boats and are nice starter yaks. If I had it to do over again I would have bought the eagle Talon 12 as my first boat.  In addition you will need a paddle, a pfd (life jacket) a noise maker of some type (a safety whistle) and I would add a map of the area you fish either a professional chart or a map application on your cell phone and a waterproof bag for your phone. I would also consider a nice hat, breathable fishing shirt and breathable fishing pants with zip off legs. (They dry very quickly when they get wet and make your time on the water much more comfortable.)  I would look at used kayaks to see if there is a decent one available, you might try a kayak rental place. It is out of season and they may be getting rid of old boats."
kayakfishing,2us34a,Noonproductions,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"Do you live near a Cabela's? Saw a post a few days ago on Slickdeals where a guy got an Old Town 9XT for $199 on sale (normally like $450). Here's a shot of the receipt he posted.   I actually purchased a kayak for $170 from TJ Maxx. I haven't had it out on the water yet (waiting for the weather to warm up). I've been wanting to get into kayak fishing for a bit. I know it isn't the ideal fishing kayak, but it's something. I was saving up to get something in the $500 - $600 price range, but had some financial setbacks. So, I settled for this after reading some favorable reviews here. They also had a sit on top model called the Clearwater Mist, but someone was purchasing the last one when I was there. For $170, I figure this should be a fine beginner boat for me and if I love kayak fishing, I'll save up for a nicer boat and let me wife use this one or my son when he gets older.   As others said, get a PFD."

Sharks might get too friendly. I personally do not use a drift sock but it's not a bad idea if the wind is strong. Williamson Abyss or Benthos, 140g (5 oz). I prefer pink."
kayakfishing,2u9t7z,3wire,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:46:18 2015 UTC,That's a nice kayak. How is it on the waters?
kayakfishing,2u9t7z,dinosorcerer,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:59:54 2015 UTC,smooth.  Cuts through choppy water.  the 155 needs the rudder tho.
kayakfishing,2u9t7z,Bustalacklusta,1 point,Sat Jan 31 04:34:34 2015 UTC,Tell me more about the trailer.
kayakfishing,2u9t7z,Bustalacklusta,1 point,Sat Jan 31 14:24:07 2015 UTC,Got it from harbor freight and welded some supports for crassbars and bolted them on
kayakfishing,2u9t7z,MookiePoops,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:34:39 2015 UTC,I thought it looked familiar. I'm thinking of doing the same thing with that HF trailer this spring. Thanks.

kayakfishing,2ua6cg,mrsexmachine,3,Sat Jan 31 06:09:19 2015 UTC,Go simple your first few times out. Get comfortable with the boat before bringing a bunch of other gear along to worry about.
kayakfishing,2ua6cg,wolfpackflyflinger95,2,Sat Jan 31 08:18:10 2015 UTC,"Gotta get a whistle and pfd! Both have to be on the boat to be legal here in Texas, not sure about other states.   You'll probably want to install an anchor trolley so that if/when you need to anchor, you can easily change positioning based on wind/current. Or you could attach a drift sock, or even run a stakeout pole through it!   Consider adding a rod holder up in front of you, or a few on the sides in front of you have any thoughts about trolling. I'm a fan of scotty products, but they are the only brand I have used, yak attack has some good stuff from what I hear!   Good luck, paddle before you install ANYTHING, and have fun, rigging is half of the fun anyways! Congrats on the new yak by the way!"
kayakfishing,2ua6cg,greenmen88,2,Sat Jan 31 07:41:27 2015 UTC,"definitely want to second the ""start slow"" advice. go someplace shallow and practice falling off a couple times, and getting back on."
kayakfishing,2ua6cg,krucz36,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:38:35 2015 UTC,"Yea I have a carbon fiber paddle (from my white water kayak) and a pfd. The kayak also comes with a depth/fish finder installed into the hull, and a scotty rod holder mounted up front.   Any suggestions on an anchor trolley / anchor? It gets kinda windy out on the lakes near me."
kayakfishing,2ua6cg,greenmen88,1 point,Sat Jan 31 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"I made a really simple trolley using two pulleys attached to the front and rear handles via caribiner, a stainless steel circle (It is a few inches in diameter) and paracord. All in all it was probably 12 or so bucks at most, and I had a lot of paracord left which is always useful! (Drift sock rope, anchor rope, tie off rope, you name it!)"
kayakfishing,2ua6cg,3wire,1 point,Sat Jan 31 15:37:37 2015 UTC,Got any pictures? I'm curious as to how this sets up.
kayakfishing,2ua6cg,greenmen88,3,Sat Jan 31 17:31:04 2015 UTC,protip:  Dont rig anything until you have taken it out on the water
kayakfishing,2u912n,Spurt_reynolds_,2,Fri Jan 30 23:21:37 2015 UTC,does paddle.net have a review?  I really like that website
kayakfishing,2u912n,dwkfym,2,Sat Jan 31 00:31:31 2015 UTC,"It looks a lot like the older wilderness tarpons, which are now sold through academy as a perception boat for like 3-400 bucks.   For that much money you could find a used cuda, coosa, native ultimate, wilderness commander, or a lot of the other big name rigs"
kayakfishing,2u912n,DrRabbitt,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:48:11 2015 UTC,never heard of em
kayakfishing,2u912n,3wire,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"Looks almost identical to my kayak, which is a common mould out of Asia that gets rebranded by local resellers (mine was sold as a Scorpio Terrapin XL, this looks like the updated model with the rear hatch). Pros are it's comfortable, stable, lots of storage. Cons are:   The centre console isn't that spacious, but you can cut it out so you can reach into the hull (the console itself is an imitation Ocean Kayaks Mod Pod II hatch kit), but I haven't been game to try. The sides are angled, which means there's no decent place to install a long rail system (not a big deal). The nose rides fairly low in the water. This is the biggest issue for me, because it makes it pretty poor in even fairly small chop. If you are only fishing in rivers on fairly flat water its no issue at all. In the ocean though its not great unless its flat, otherwise it tends to punch through small waves, so the nose is constantly going under and it can be fairly hard paddling. The hatch is slightly leaky. This might just be mine, but I've found the water can trickle in constantly if you are in choppy water and the nose is constantly going under, it will take on water at a rate of about 800ml/hour. Once again, not an issue if you are on flat rivers/lakes.   I know that I've focussed a lot on the cons, but it is a nice little kayak under many conditions. This guy loves his. That being said, I think that $850 is a little bit too much to pay for it (mine was AUD$600 without the seat and paddle, which would jointly cost around AUD$100 on ebay) and I suspect that there are kayaks in that price bracket that don't suffer the cons I mentioned."
kayakfishing,2u73rb,DusLeJ,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:02:24 2015 UTC,Awesome!  I ordered up a few.  I figure they're worth a shot for $5 a piece.
kayakfishing,2u73rb,hobowithashotgun2990,2,Fri Jan 30 18:05:08 2015 UTC,Same here.  Got 3 for $21. Plus they look really cool!
kayakfishing,2u73rb,oodleskaboodles,1 point,Fri Jan 30 23:37:39 2015 UTC,Awesome deal! Ordered some sleeves and a buff.
kayakfishing,2u73rb,ConcertOfPunches,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:01:48 2015 UTC,$8 total for a buff and shipping. I'll need that this summer.
kayakfishing,2u73rb,macfanboi,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"I just got mine in yesterday. They are thinner and more elastic than a  real ""Buff"". But they seem more breathable and comfortable too. Don't know how long they will last, but I'll get some use out of them this summer."

kayakfishing,2u6kw9,matbennett,2,Fri Jan 30 09:22:28 2015 UTC,Check out this video I did a few eyars back.  I do an over the shoulder and front camera.  You can see em in the video.     http://youtu.be/ekWSJgfy0-U
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,3wire,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:36:23 2015 UTC,That over the shoulder angle is exactly what I was thinking of.  Three questions: 1. What mount/pole is that? 2. Think it would stand up to a battering in surf 3. Can I have your trailer ??!?
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,3wire,1 point,Sat Jan 31 14:40:14 2015 UTC,All my mounts are made by Yak Attack.  I firget the name but they are great for gopros. Ive been through breaking waves from beach launching and they do fine.  No i like my trailer but maybe for about 1300 id let it go haha
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,RitzRuler,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"I've used a suction cup mount before but you have to be careful, because I've had it just slide of before. Another good option would be a headband mount, I'm not sure if you can with a gopro but for my sony action camera I'm able to just wear a headband with the camera on the side."
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,AkaDukeSilver,1 point,Fri Jan 30 13:56:04 2015 UTC,I just bought one a few months ago and plan on using the suction cup ram mount. I used that one a snowmobile trip last weekend and tied a piece of 550 to it as a safety lanyard. I may make a pole mount in the future.
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,Kardinal_84,1 point,Fri Jan 30 17:41:00 2015 UTC,Get a handle bar mount for the gopro.  Then wrap one end of the pole in something like a foam pool noodle and you can insert into the factory rod holders in back or any rod holder to get various angle.  Most of my shots are taken with the head strap abd it seems to give a pretty good perspective and the image much more stable than I would have thought.
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,3wire,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:02:38 2015 UTC,I use a few different mount made by yak attack too
kayakfishing,2u6kw9,oodleskaboodles,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:37:39 2015 UTC,I use a selfy-stick I have with a gopro mount and bungee it to the cooler in the back i carry. Basically it looks like that yakattack moubt everyone talks about. I just made do with what i have.
kayakfishing,2u3jlk,kayakfishermanirl,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:13:15 2015 UTC,I just got mine today.  All I did was throw an anchor trolley on it.  Its got plenty of track for rod holders.  I hope you got the rudder on it..the 155 is a bitch without it

kayakfishing,2u3jlk,vdubgti18t,1 point,Sat Jan 31 05:34:17 2015 UTC,not much needed to be done to the Thresher beside a anchor trolly
kayakfishing,2u3jlk,3wire,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:36:31 2015 UTC,got the rudder on it. want to add an anchor trolley and a few flush mount rod holders. I'm sure I'll find more excuses to drill more holes too!
kayakfishing,2u1hb4,dinsauce,2,Thu Jan 29 03:09:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure one of these will be my next boat.
kayakfishing,2u1hb4,bear_glove,2,Thu Jan 29 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"This trident 13 is my first and I fucking love it. The only other boat I would go for, as of now, is something with pedals. I didn't have an extra grand laying around for that so this was my pick."
kayakfishing,2u1hb4,bear_glove,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:29:55 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way, want a hobie but can't afford one. My boat now is good but a little slow for the kinda fishing I want to do. Hopefully I can upgrade to the trident and keep the other so I can take my gf out. Did you do any modding to yours yet or is it still stock?"
kayakfishing,2tyqc5,harroldhino,2,Wed Jan 28 14:26:51 2015 UTC,I'm in MA but have a sound knowledge of NE kayak fishing

kayakfishing,2tvu5k,TRAKTION803,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:09:20 2015 UTC,Can I come?
kayakfishing,2tvcyh,Cowpig_dog,2,Tue Jan 27 19:09:39 2015 UTC,I use a Cajun anchor. It's a steel rod with a sharpened end. The other end has a ring on it I tie a line to. Just stab it in the sand when you want to stop.
kayakfishing,2tvcyh,degaman,0,Tue Jan 27 19:40:42 2015 UTC,"I've done this before, but found it added an extra step: put down the paddle or push pole, pick up the anchor pin and set it, then pick up the fly rod and make the cast. It costs some time and my kayak would also bump the stake making some noise. I may have to go back to doing this though if I can't think of a better option."
kayakfishing,2tvcyh,degaman,2,Tue Jan 27 19:58:35 2015 UTC,Yeah it has it's issues. Hopefully someone around here can give us a better solution.
kayakfishing,2tvcyh,Devlooper,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome video, I remember seeing it some time ago. did you make that push pole or did you buy it?"

Also the aluminum can be noisy banging against a rock. But for $80 you can't beat it."
kayakfishing,2tvcyh,Devlooper,2,Wed Jan 28 17:17:53 2015 UTC,It's expensive but I use the Micro Power Pole.  Two clicks on the button and I'm done.

kayakfishing,2tu3sj,CollectingHeads,3,Tue Jan 27 15:22:09 2015 UTC,Old Town has a life time hull warranty. Sealed the deal for me. I've got Predator MX (mixed water).
kayakfishing,2tu3sj,TDL4LIFE,3,Tue Jan 27 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"So far with my limited use the predator has been amazing kayak. I did upgrade from a heritage redfish 14 ( I think was it's name, in Mexico so can't verify) so the extra weight was quite a burden for going solo. Other than that it has been an amazing kayak. I have even managed to stand up on it and I have terrible balance on anything."
kayakfishing,2tu3sj,bishamuesmus,2,Tue Jan 27 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"Old town and ocean kayak (owned by the same company) both came out with some sweet boats this past year. The predator looks great, but check out some of the other stuff in their line ups too."
kayakfishing,2tu3sj,dinsauce,2,Tue Jan 27 13:27:30 2015 UTC,Old Town is a reputable canoe maker for a long time so I am sure their yaks are fine. I personally don't think you can get better than wilderness systems but that's just me :)
kayakfishing,2tu3sj,blatherdrift,2,Tue Jan 27 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"I upgraded to a predator 13 last September after fishing on a field & stream eagle Talon for four years. I loved that eagle Talon and I would recommend it to anyone, but it is not even in the same class as the predator 13. I can fish in very rough water and it paddles remarkably well for it's width. I added a crate, a Scotty Rod holder to the mod pod and a fish finder. So far it has met all of my needs. I liked it so much I am picking up a second one for my girlfriend to use so we can paddle together. My only problem is I am a little too heavy for the boat. If I had to do it again I would look at the XL or the ocean kayak prowler big game II for the 600lb weight capacity."
kayakfishing,2tu3sj,Noonproductions,0,Sun Feb 1 23:12:21 2015 UTC,I would look at the jackson brand kayaks. same price range and they are the best imo. tons of features and they look nice. Here is their array of fishing kayaks
