humblebrag,3cg68j,MereGirl,2,Wed Jul 8 02:13:48 2015 UTC,"Solicitor:       A solicitor is a legal practitioner who traditionally deals with any legal matter in some jurisdictions. A person must have legally-defined qualifications, which vary from one jurisdiction to another, to be described as a solicitor and enabled to practise there as such. For example, in England and Wales a solicitor is admitted to practise under the provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974. With some exceptions, practising solicitors must possess a practising certificate. There are many more solicitors than barristers in England; they undertake the general aspects of giving legal advice and conducting legal proceedings.

humblebrag,3cg68j,Brobi_WanKenobi,5,Wed Jul 8 02:19:21 2015 UTC,"A solicitor is pretty much one step below a barrister, which is kind of the US equivalent of a minor/low level lawyer. They tend to deal with civil cases instead of criminal or crown court ones. (Like the difference between federal and state law in the US, not a perfect comparison, but the closest one i could make)  Thing is, BEING a solicitor means you have to have a degree and a certain amount of intelligence. Working FOR a solicitor means you're a glorified receptionist. A distinction that many people confuse.  EDIT: So after a brief conversation with an American friend of mine, it seems that a solicitor is pretty comparable to a public defender in many respects. Though they seem to be slightly more versatile and well paid being that they do more things and undertake a slightly more varied workload. Also she told me that my ""Federal vs State"" comparison was pretty off, but I'm letting it stand for the sake of the correction."

NO ONE is born knowing how to play an instrument.  Everyone is born with the ability to understand rhythm and melody.

In the UK and commonwealth, we have Remembrance Sunday, and that day isn't about glorifying war or thanking people for doing their job, it's about remembering how absolutely fucking atrocious war is.   The hero worship of soldiers in the US is just frightening. No wonder your government spends all it's money on missiles and aircraft carriers and makes you pay for basic human rights like medicine.

EDIT: I just got off work and I'm about to head out to my next job so I can't thank everyone individually but I'd like to make sure you all know how grateful I am for the support, and not to worry about me. The things she says are mainly deep-rooted in her religion and social background, mainly to do with despising me for being a 'deviant' (I'm bisexual and left the church when things started to get hateful and bigoted).  I hadn't realized this was a gold-giving thread, I was actually thinking about my visits the other day and how I never get anything in return (it was a rough day, I felt a bit jaded, I'm good now) but this really made my day since I wasn't expecting it!

humblebrag,36uwf0,molsonbeagle,2,Sat May 23 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"Actually- the high GPA-low attendance thing is totally possible. Both my little sister and I went to really shitty public high schools. We also both had to take summer school/after school ""study hall"" type classes to be allowed to make up the days we'd missed over the allotted absence amount. Texas and Louisiana, if you're curious.   As long as you have teachers that are lenient and don't give a shit and let you make up tests and assignments whenever you want, the only thing you have to worry about are the state's truancy regulations. And yes, they can give the student and the parent citations and you have to pay fines.   I did high school rodeo and was gone a TON. I befriended the truancy officer. My sister did drugs and has befriended pretty much everyone she's ever met. Disclaimer: this shit does not work in college. I barely survived my undergrad, little sister is currently a dropout.   Edit to clarify: high school rodeo is not organized by the schools- it's an independent deal. You can have a high school rodeo team and get your absences excused, but often schools don't have teams, or, in my case, they have a team that sucked and never traveled so I would run as an independent. Literally all of my rodeo friends were ""homeschooled"" which is a really nice way of saying they dropped out and filled out some GED paperwork or turned in packets of school work every so often to avoid truancy laws."

humblebrag,35yy5j,ParadoxPixie,5,Fri May 15 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"Female here, and there's really no such thing as a ""Low Maintenance Girl.""  There are Slightly-Less-Maintenance girls, but everybody, even guys, require maintenance.   If we're talking material needs, like cosmetics and products to maintain hygiene, especially so. If you don't have the ""need,"" for some stuff, you're probably not maintaining yourself very well. Nobody is an exception. If you think you are- you probably smell weird.  If we're talking emotional maintenance- we all also need affirmation, togetherness, communication, patience, and understanding.  Girls may need it in a little more quantity, but we definitely seek it more openly.  There are days when I feel so content with myself, and I feel so ""low-maintenance,"" but then the very next day, I'm reminded of how much I really require as a human.  Edit: Here's a link to the article  Note that every point is about either a lack of desire to exert effort in physical appearance, or their lack of understanding of why so many other girls enjoy stereotypical ""girly,"" things like makeup, shopping, trying on clothes, etc."
humblebrag,35yy5j,beerandmath,11,Fri May 15 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know what low maintenance means.  It doesn't mean ""needs no shampoo, soap, breakfast, lunch, dinner, shelter, etc"".  That would be retarded.  Even if that's what maintenance is referring to, you've laid out a nice argument for why a ""no-maintenance girl"" is not a thing."
humblebrag,35yy5j,ParadoxPixie,3,Fri May 15 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"I tried to cover all of the bases for what ""low maintenance,"" could conceivably be defined as.  And you're right, a ""low maintenance girl,"" is NOT one that doesn't need the things like what you mentioned; (shampoo, soap, breakfast, lunch and dinner.) Nobody really thinks that...I hope.  I meant that we need greatly above and beyond those basic needs, and therefore can't be ""low maintenance.""   Things like, ""Not just any shampoo or conditioner will do. I need 'Tresemme conditioner infused with keratin for coloured hair.' And while you're at the store, go to the beauty section and pick up more of the unscented Neutrogena facial cleanser. Not the generic Equate version, and NON-SCENTED!"""
humblebrag,35yy5j,beerandmath,6,Fri May 15 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"My point is that plenty of people don't need the special conditioner, and would be happy going anywhere for dinner, and in general don't fuss about unimportant things.  This is what low maintenance means. As opposed to, say, 'requiring an average amount of maintenance', or 'requiring a higher-than-average amount of maintenance'."
humblebrag,35yy5j,ParadoxPixie,3,Fri May 15 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's just where the different definitions of low-maintenance come in, then. The article's definition seems to lean toward one of: ""I'm not very girly, therefore I'm low maintenance."""

Reddit, yeah sure, forum posts from other websites, yeah, but Facebook is literally supposed to be where you share stuff like this. Facebook is not a bragging platform, people just post their lives. This guy is going to MIT. He probably did get the paperwork late. Good for him, that is literally his life. Its not like he needs to hide his achievement from people in fear of making people feel inferior (or maybe he does, since clearly some random people he doesn't know are going to make fun of him on some website). The whole thing seems wrong, and a lot of the stuff that gets posted here is literally just patronizing people on a face-value fact. No one even knows this guy, and he doesn't even come off like a douchebag in the small amount of text he wrote.  It seems like the subs that make fun of doucebags always go by the wayside when they get more popular. There's more people leading wanting more content so less quality stuff gets up voted. People then get used to grabbing for straws and make fun of pretty much anything they can get their hands on relevant or not.

The way the photo looks now, it is clearly meant to show where the paperwork was coming from--not what the paperwork is.   The FB post itself is not about where the paperwork came from. It is about the fact that it came in late.   If the post was about the paperwork coming in late, why wouldn't he have centered on the postmark instead of the return address? or at least a zoom out a little so it doesn't scream ""READ THE RETURN ADDRESS EVERYONE""?  I appreciate your passion for sub quality, but imo it is misplaced passion. This is a beautiful example of humblebrag.   It doesn't matter if this is ""literally his life"".

humblebrag,355vej,TweetPoster,2,Thu May 7 10:59:01 2015 UTC,What is the house of lords for us non British plebeians?
humblebrag,355vej,RabidLitchi,7,Thu May 7 14:58:51 2015 UTC,"When we have a general election the winning candidate for a constituency becomes that constituency's MP (Member of Parliament). This means they have a seat in the House of Commons, the home of the UK Parliament and they are responsible for making laws and checking the work of the government. All of these folk are elected by the people.  The House of Commons is called the lower house. The upper house is the House of Lords.  Those in the House of Lords aren't elected. They're either Life Peers or Hereditary Peers. The former is an individual nominated by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Queen to sit on the House of Lords. This can be any British citizen. Really, anyone. Successful business men and women, scientists, professors, teachers, campaigners. However, the latter is someone who has had the title of Lord passed down through their family. They inherit the seat.  Essentially the purpose of the House of Lords is to sense check any legislation that gets through the House of Commons. They used to have the power to block legislation if they didn't agree, but this has mostly changed with the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. However, they have the right to debate and delay legislation and bills they don't agree with. While they cannot veto them outright, they can delay them for a year which could essentially block any changes should a general election be held within that year.  So that's pretty much what they do. It's an archaic system and the two Houses sometimes clash:   The Commons will occasionally bargain and negotiate with the Lords such as when the Labour Government of 1999 tried to expel all Hereditary Peers from the Lords, and the Lords threatened to wreck the Government's entire legislative agenda and to block every bill which was sent to the chamber.   TL;DR: The House of Lords is the upper house of the UK Parliament. It's filled with successful people and the British elite. They debate any legislation that's passed through the House of Commons, which is comprised of elected politicians. They have the power to delay and, in some cases, block any legislation they don't agree with.  Basically, the UK parliamentary system is an utter joke."
humblebrag,355vej,DownvoterAccount,2,Thu May 7 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"The upper-house in British Parliament. Equivalent to the Senate in the US, but works a lot differently with their wacky British ways."
humblebrag,355vej,IBeHairman,1 point,Thu May 7 15:34:31 2015 UTC,"From a reply: Wiki  Sees crazy that conservatives get to choose 42/92 of the hereditary seats in the house of lords. It means that there will always be a large number of conservatives in the upper house, because ,obviously, the conservatives will vote for conservatives. Or am I missing something? Seems very biased towards torries."
humblebrag,355vej,IBeHairman,2,Thu May 7 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"It's complicated, but it's not as biased as appears. That's just the conservatives majority when it comes to hereditary elections. They can only elect 42 of the 92 hereditary seats, which is a small portion of the 772 total seats.  This is the current House of Lords seat distribution:   HM Government  Conservative Party (224)  Liberal Democrats (101)  HM Opposition  Labour Party (214)  Other  Crossbenchers (178)  UK Independence Party (3)  Democratic Unionist Party (3)  Plaid Cymru (2)  Ulster Unionist Party (2)  Green Party (1)  Independent Labour (1)  Independent Liberal Democrat (1)  Independent Social Democrat (1)  Independent Ulster Unionist (1)  Non-affiliated (21)  Lords Spiritual (26)   It's pretty even and is usually reflective of the general election results:   No one party has overall control in the House of Lords.  Since 1999 Peers have been appointed roughly in proportion to the share of votes cast in the most recent General Election.  Coalitions must be built across party groups and ‘cross-benchers’ in order to avoid or inflict defeats.  The Standing Orders in the Lords provide few opportunities for debate to be curtailed and there is no selection of amendments.  As well as large numbers of former MPs, the membership of the House of Lords includes notable experts and cross-benchers often from outside party politics.  The House of Lords is often praised for its consensual style, its considered approach to scrutiny and the combined knowledge of its membership.   Source."

humblebrag,351g7z,Cerpicio,11,Wed May 6 16:32:25 2015 UTC,Are you honestly say the quality of a $5 purse or shoes is the same as a $300 one?
humblebrag,351g7z,DLK601,3,Thu May 7 01:14:24 2015 UTC,"I never used the word quality. I said 'better' which is purposefully vague. A cheap knockoff purse works just as well as a purse as a really expensive one. The point is you buy the expensive for social reasons, just like the CSGO knife."
humblebrag,351g7z,Cerpicio,8,Thu May 7 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"A $5 pair of shoes work not nearly as good as a $300 pair. As good or better implies all characteristics, not just the one you want to use."
humblebrag,351g7z,DLK601,0,Thu May 7 02:53:53 2015 UTC,your nit picking my analogy. No a 5$ pair does not work as well in every aspect. But a 300$ pair does not work 60x as well as a 5$ pair. You paying primarily for the social benefits.   The purse is the better example I shouldn't have mentioned the shoes.
humblebrag,351g7z,Cerpicio,1 point,Thu May 7 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"Actually a $300 anything will most likely work much better and last much longer than its $5 counterpart.  IRL, of course.  The $300 video game knife is 100% for the peen."
humblebrag,351g7z,KimoCroyle,0,Thu May 14 08:40:21 2015 UTC,I would say the difference in quality and durability between $5 and $300 purse or other manufactured item is huge. Now the difference between a $50 and $300 purse is probably quite a bit less.

humblebrag,2v6qll,bitofa,12,Sun Feb 8 13:27:22 2015 UTC,"No, that makes perfect sense.  No one wants to buy particularly used underwear.  She presumably needs to explain why she owns and hasn't used it.  You would do the exact same thing with shoes.  OP, do you have breasts?  Because that's not how discussing one's own boobs amongst women works.  It's not really anything like a dick-measuring contest, where the girl with the bigger breasts is somehow more ""alpha"" -- If anything, large breasts are seen as a burden.  Bras are hard, fitting is difficult, that's why there's an enormous subreddit devoted to it.  This is not like publicly musing about whether you need the regular-sized condom or the XL magnum one.  Most women just do not find random women's breasts intimidating, and in any case, it's not like some kind of hidden covert feature.  A girl's bra size is pretty visible to just about anyone she meets.  I think most women would agree that ""my breasts are too big for this bra"" is an exceptionally mundane, uncharged and often necessary thing to say."

I'm going to assume you're a guy because of your response to that question, correct me if I'm wrong. Boobs aren't a dominance thing unless you have serious self-confidence issues, and I had those big-time, still do as everyone does, but if you're old enough to be on Reddit you shouldn't be asking stupid questions like that. Why is the size of /u/bitofa's breasts even slightly relevant?"
humblebrag,2v6qll,tuddyScuffles,0,Tue Feb 17 12:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'm simply saying that there are definitely those who have confidence issues regarding breast size, and just because you're not affected by something doesn't mean no one is (or even that a lot of people aren't). How is it a stupid question? Who said anything about dominance? Why does breast augmentation exist? How is my gender relevant if breast size isn't?  I probably worded my questions a bit harsh but to me it sounds like a lot of people are dismissing the fact that, even if unintentional, someone can interpret this as flaunting something they don't and can never have."
humblebrag,2v6qll,RedRag2000,2,Wed Feb 18 04:33:41 2015 UTC,"It's not. You can interpret it wrong, sure, but women don't brag about this kind of thing unless they're conceited or have self-esteem issues. /u/bitofa, who I assume you're talking about, wasn't saying anything at all about her breasts!   Sure, someone can interpret it wrong if they aren't a woman or don't keep the company of women.  Yes, there are those with confidence issues regarding breast size, that's almost every single woman ever, to some extent.  Yes, breast augmentation exists, but the vast majority of women do not get them at all. 300,000 women got breast enhancements in 2013, and the number hasn't been rising exponentially. It's a tiny minority that actually do get enhancements or anything like that.  If you are male or do not keep the company of women who treat you exactly like a woman, that's relevant to this discussion, because you do not know how general female society works. We don't tend to brag too much about breasts, because it's awkward all around.  Basically, if you don't understand this after having it explained to you over and over, and just insist on arguing against people who are just being normal and not bragging, then... well, I don't really know what to say. Just: really?"

That is literally the only point I'm trying to make. All this other shit about dominance and intimidation, though there is truth to it, is irrelevant."
humblebrag,2v6qll,bitofa,1 point,Thu Feb 19 01:31:35 2015 UTC,"Christ. Ok, so like, where are you coming from with this?  Are you a woman who feels intimidated by women with larger breasts?  Do you feel like there's an overarching sentiment here that's not getting represented?  I absolutely believe there are women out there who wish their breasts were bigger.  The thing to understand is that, despite that absolutely being a thing, the culture is not ""I am intimidated by you because your breasts are bigger than mine"".  Just because we would prefer our bodies have other features doesn't mean we're naturally intimidated by a person who has the features we want.  This is true of some things, right? Penises, muscles, cars, houses.  But in my culture (and I feel comfortable speaking with authority about this culture, even if I am not literally every every member of it), breasts are not that.  They are a thing that can cause problems, either because they are big or because they are small.  Throughout my life, I have heard girls complain about their breasts, and I cannot recall a single instance in which mentioning their size was perceived by myself or others as bragging.  Even when I've wanted larger breasts myself, I've had sympathy for girls whose large breasts were causing them problems.      Lots of people wish they were skinnier, but that doesn't make me an asshole if I post on a forum and offer to sell some clothes that were too big for me.  Other girls aren't going to shrink in awe of my superior femininity.  And even if I am not literally every girl on the planet, I feel confident in my belief that humans are generally pretty practical about this shit."

humblebrag,2uv7kj,jrock336,2,Thu Feb 5 18:46:54 2015 UTC,"It relates to how the cars are built and the difference between body-on-frame and unibody.    Most small passenger vehicles switched to unibody construction in the 1960s, but the trend had started in the 1930s with cars like the Opel Olympia, and Citroen Traction Avant, leaving just trucks, some bus manufacturers, and large cars using conventional frames. The shift continues today: body-on-frame remains the preferred construction method for heavy-duty commercial vehicles (especially those intended to carry or pull heavy loads, such as trucks and some sport utility vehicles (SUVs)), but increasing numbers of SUVs are also being converted to automobile-style unibody frames, and the market is also shifting from SUVs to crossover SUVs.   I'll mostly hear it from older mechanics that grew up when the term ""SUV"" wasn't very popular.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body-on-frame"

I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack, I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me. Only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, I simply am not there."

Cuts his hair that way, grows the goatee, dresses like him.  Really though- the film he's making is just one big ego-fest, and he's placed himself at the centre of it all, soaking up the attention all of these people who desire to be 'famous,' are throwing at him.

humblebrag,2tzg7u,Hello_Im_Corey,10,Wed Jan 28 20:27:38 2015 UTC,The brag is the affording cleaning ladies.
humblebrag,2tzg7u,tdogg8,17,Wed Jan 28 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure about America, but here in Norway, it's relatively common to have cleaning ladies come in once every two weeks or so to clean up. they're not particularily expensive, and pretty affordable anyway since you're not having them over that often.  And the guy in the OP is right, it's extremely awkward to be home when they're there. I've waited outside my house for an hour in the snow because they've started cleaning later than usual, just waiting for them to leave."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,PowBlock96,12,Wed Jan 28 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"In the US usually usually only the wealthy have cleaning ladies, it's more of a luxury.   And the guy in the OP is right, it's extremely awkward to be home when they're there. I've waited outside my house for an hour in the snow because they've started cleaning later than usual, just waiting for them to leave.   ROFL I could definitely see myself doing this."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,tdogg8,6,Wed Jan 28 21:10:07 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty middle class I have cleaning ladies, 75 dollars for once a month and my house is cleaned. Not expensive."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,Hello_Im_Corey,8,Wed Jan 28 21:34:45 2015 UTC,National Average in America is around $190 per clean.  Source: http://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/cleaning-services/
humblebrag,2tzg7u,LRGinCharge,2,Wed Jan 28 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that seems really high to me. I wonder if that is skewed because cleaners charge by how big your house is, and people with larger homes are more likely to be able to afford house cleaning. When I moved out of a small duplex we got a move-out clean done and that was $180, and that's like a major major cleaning job. I think a regular clean for a 1200-1500 square foot house would be more like $75-$90."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,The_Miskatonian,2,Wed Jan 28 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"It depends on region of course, and these are just averages. The point is regular people do not NORMALLY have housemaids, usually people who are better off do."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,od_9,2,Wed Jan 28 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My ex-wife's parents had housemaids clean their home regularly. They were far from normal, and could barely afford it."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,LRGinCharge,2,Wed Jan 28 23:20:23 2015 UTC,"I have a lady that comes every other week, costs $150 a month. But I've only got a small condo, and she basically just vacuums and cleans the bathrooms and kitchen. Probably only takes 2-3 hours at most (I don't know, I'm never home when she comes over, it really is kind of awkward).  Only reason I started with her was because she's the parent of one of my mom's students who was looking for work, but I love having her come by. It's been a while and I think it might be the mom some weeks and the daughter other weeks now.   Plus, strangely, my wife insists we clean up the place (straightening everything out, putting everything away, dishes, etc.) the day before she comes because she's worried the cleaning lady will think we're slobs...  It's a luxury, sure, but I can afford it, and I feel like I'm also helping someone out."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,brutinator,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"I guess, but I don't think because someone posts one time that they have cleaners at their house that they are necessarily trying to brag that they are rich, or that they even are rich. Really, if you budget for it, having someone clean your house every 1-2 months or so isn't that out of reach for the middle class, especially because you can get a Groupon for closer to $40-$50."
humblebrag,2tzg7u,Coocooso,0,Thu Jan 29 19:31:43 2015 UTC,"When I was growing up, we'd have cleaning ladies come over maybe 4 times a year, and we weren't super well off. I know that my mom usually would only do it when a company had a special or something. It was always a pain because our whole family would clean the house before the maids came so that way they'd do all the hard stuff. But yeah, I'd say it's as much middle class as wealthy.

They hurt when you run or jump (and people stare), nothing fits, you can't get away without wearing a bra, and people seem to think that the bigger they are, the more license they have to make inappropriate comments.  Wear something snug?  Slut.  Wear something baggy?  ""When are yo udue?""  Even practical gear is a pain in the ass.  You know those bulletproof vests that are built for women? Yeah. They don't fit.  You wind up with two sets of boobs--the set that's built into the vest that winds up on your collarbone, and the set nature gave you that either gets smashed in the vest or squishes out the side.    And if you developed early and got shit for it, you can learn to really loathe their size by the time you're in high school.  Don't get me wrong--I'd much rather have mine than not; I appreciate them and I certainly enjoy them--but once in a while a while, you get to bitch about them, because they do come with problems.

Turns out I was eating really little, even when I felt full all the time. Calculate your TDEE (see /r/gainit sidebar) and plan your food according to that.  Ofc, unless you are underweight, you should exercise (weight train, little cardio) along with eating MORE, otherwise it WILL turn into fat. If you sit all day, eat exactly at TDEE to remain neutral.  It is really simple. If you eat more than your body can use, you gain mass (either fat or muscle, depending on several factors, mainly exercise). If you eat less, you loose mass (unless you exercise, muscle loss is inevitable)"

humblebrag,2rtwny,SquishyDelishy,-8,Wed Jun 24 16:09:16 2015 UTC,This happened to me and it was really embarrassing >. <

humblebrag,2rrvqa,BigNuggie,3,Fri Jan 9 00:09:02 2015 UTC,You gotta count the rings.
humblebrag,2rrvqa,Ghuurka,16,Sun Jan 11 21:49:07 2015 UTC,Why would anyone post this to Facebook?
humblebrag,2rrvqa,immatellyouwhat,9,Thu Jan 8 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"This guy posts stuff like this all the time, although this particular post is probably the most blatant brag I've seen from him yet."
humblebrag,2rrvqa,OnionButter,9,Thu Jan 8 22:25:42 2015 UTC,I automatically hide people like that. One guy posted an article about '23 struggles for people who are too good at sex' haha sure buddy.
humblebrag,2rrvqa,gaedikus,27,Sun Jan 11 18:06:12 2015 UTC,Missing the humble.
humblebrag,2rrvqa,Dantien,9,Thu Jan 8 20:00:34 2015 UTC,/r/bigdickproblems is probably the place for that guy.
humblebrag,2rrvqa,gaedikus,-4,Fri Jan 9 02:19:47 2015 UTC,"They prefer SERIOUS problems, not exaggerations."
humblebrag,2rrvqa,Dantien,13,Fri Jan 9 03:42:06 2015 UTC,"serious problems   I know bro! It's such a problem, when my ex broke up she told everyone about my dick and then every single one of her friends wanted to fuck me. I basically spent the next year having constant sex with the hot ones. I guess it's a blessing and a curse lol. If I had an average penis I probably wouldn't have gotten laid at all lol.    sounds pretty serious."
humblebrag,2rsrth,fuckmyhardtaco,13,Thu Jan 8 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"This isn't humble bragging, just regular bragging"
humblebrag,2rsrth,wow_great_name,4,Fri Jan 9 07:50:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it probably belongs in /r/thatHappened"
humblebrag,2rsrth,soulcaptain,1 point,Fri Jan 16 09:09:43 2015 UTC,needs more humble
humblebrag,2rxbt7,TrixAreFourKids,22,Sat Jan 10 02:31:42 2015 UTC,Not a humblebrag.
humblebrag,2rxbt7,metastasis_d,0,Sat Jan 10 02:59:08 2015 UTC,Sure it is. Why isn't it?
humblebrag,2rxbt7,SkyrocketFilms,2,Thu Jan 15 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"How is it humble?   If she said something like, ""I really wanted Hustler but I guess I'm just not up to that level"" it would be a humblebrag. This isn't really even a brag."
humblebrag,2rxbt7,metastasis_d,0,Thu Jan 15 21:19:51 2015 UTC,I guess. It isn't really 'humble' but it has an attempt to distract the reader from the brag with all this 'follow your dreams' shit so it doesn't look outright arrogant.
humblebrag,2rjwt1,royalspork,26,Tue Jan 6 20:59:23 2015 UTC,Where is the humble part?  Just seems like a straight brag.
humblebrag,2rjwt1,swccggergall,12,Tue Jan 6 22:29:59 2015 UTC,(even those that did not join us on the cruise)   What a class A cunt.
humblebrag,2rjwt1,El_Robbie,6,Thu Jan 8 23:34:05 2015 UTC,needs more humble
humblebrag,2rjwt1,SirThrocken,4,Tue Jan 6 23:15:39 2015 UTC,yeah ..... this is blatant brag. Apparently a yearly one.
humblebrag,2rjwt1,xlr8ed1,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:00:49 2015 UTC,"For a vacation cruises are relatively inexpensive actually -- usually the entire cruise is less than just the hotel would be for a week in one of the countries you visit, not including food or actually doing anything which is part of the cruise. A lot of people who wouldn't otherwise be able to take vacations, yearly or at all, can do so if they do cruises instead of flying somewhere and staying in a resort."
humblebrag,2rjwt1,GranolaPancakes,2,Wed Jan 28 04:41:29 2015 UTC,So they paid for memories?  I'd rather just make them for free.
humblebrag,2rjwt1,nannulators,-2,Thu Jan 8 22:11:46 2015 UTC,Crystal Cruise
humblebrag,2rdm56,linkazoid,10,Mon Jan 5 06:19:30 2015 UTC,"Did he just say ""kicking ass'n naming names""..."
humblebrag,2rdm56,dolfan650,3,Tue Jan 6 16:49:08 2015 UTC,Yeah that really threw me for a looperoonie.
