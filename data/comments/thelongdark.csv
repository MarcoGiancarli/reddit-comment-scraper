thelongdark,3e4hpw,thudly,5,Tue Jul 21 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly we should have melt/boil as one option, we should find unsafe water which opens the option to boil it, and potentially water could have a % so that over time in open containers it gets less safe and requires reboiling.  Gathering snow to melt shouldn't require a fire.    So... Like toilet water is unsafe.  Found bottled water is safe, but if you open it it'll get less safe over a long time.  Holes in ice can be used to gather unsafe water.  Foraging for snow takes time and it melts indoors into unsafe water.  Then you can boil or purify it.    That'd give us something else to do and increase difficulty of finding water.  It's like wood foraging plus cooking and makes purification tablets useful as then you don't need fire."
thelongdark,3e4hpw,alex3omg,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:02 2015 UTC,toilet tank water is safe. nobody's taking water from a toilet bowl.

thelongdark,3e4nq7,FlowerPotM,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:19:32 2015 UTC,a desert would be much easier than a rainforest or something. seeing as you don't need much wildlife. the sands shifting would be cool. also seeing a mirage or something. dust storm. finding a camel. birds circling overhead.
thelongdark,3e2u2a,Screwed_38,10,Tue Jul 21 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"More realism, maybe a new difficulty mode for it.  Random events that will introduce some kind of scaling difficulty as time goes on.    Realism: - Indoor temperature variation.  If it's -30C outside why is it a constant +2C inside? - Reduced rate of condition recovery when sleeping.  If you are mauled by a bear, it should take more than 12 hours of sleep to fully recover.  This would also potentially eliminate the ""Hibernation"" strategy to attain extremely long survival times. - Scaling Freezing damage depending on your ""Feels Like"" temperature.  Right now you take the same amount of damage whether you're at -1C or -60C.    Random Events: - Blizzards that last for days or longer instead of a few hours. - Wolves changing up their ""patrol"" spots randomly instead of staying in static predefined areas. - Indoor scavengers that will go after your food supply(rats/mice).    Random stuff: - Add the ability to make a fire larger/hotter instead of increasing duration. - Work Bench UI is still terrible. - There's still no reason to ever build the Bearskin bedroll unless you're going for that Wrapped in Fur achievement."
thelongdark,3e2u2a,Kraelman,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"There's still no reason to ever build the Bearskin bedroll...   Not really. There is a difference between a normal bedroll and a bearskin bedroll: it might scare wolves (and bear?) away when you sleeping. It's really useful when you travel and explore in a long way, a blizzard come and you should better sleep in bedroll waiting it end rather than groping like a blind. If you sleep in a normal bedroll you have risk to be attacked by a wolf or bear."
thelongdark,3e2u2a,old_Anton,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:58 2015 UTC,The only reason I survived a harsh blizzard in the open was the bearskin bed roll. The storm blew out my fire fast so I hopped th roll and slept through it with a gain in condition!
thelongdark,3e2u2a,kookomagoo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"I've logged like 200+ hours in the game doing outside-only challenges where I never even see the inside of a building and the only time I built the bearskin bedroll was for the achievement in a normal run(which was my latest run).  If it's not worth building in an outside-only challenge(believe me, it's not) it's pretty much just kind of a luxury item in a normal run."
thelongdark,3e2u2a,Kraelman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:52 2015 UTC,Another big pros using bearskin bedroll is it's warmer than normal one. Sleep in bedroll avoid your clothes being damaged by blizzard if I recall correctly. Not sure If we can sleep without clothes though.
thelongdark,3e2u2a,old_Anton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:49 2015 UTC,I disagree. The bedroll requires finite materials to repair and the bearskin bedroll does not. Yes it's heavier but being able to warm up by a lot in a pinch and repairing it using found resources and not cloth is a huge upside.
thelongdark,3e2u2a,fennesz,5,Tue Jul 21 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"For it to match the developers' description: ""survival game without zombies"". Because right now there's little survival and lots of easy, tedious living while being surrounded by wolves who act almost like zombies."

thelongdark,3e2u2a,Latiasracer,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for depth.  Once you hit your stride it's obvious that we're missing a layer of involvement.  We need reasons to go outdoors - and outdoors has to mean risking your life every single time.  For instance:      Firewood is vitally important, if only to melt snow, that an automated search that takes hours without any danger except freezing steals an opportunity for danger.  Similarly, rendering a kill is without any real risk if you have the tools and health to stay in the cold long enough.  It's an opportunity for danger that's lost because time flies by safely outdoors.  But both of these are necessary activities and should be quite risky.      Crafting depth - the quest to get us outdoors desperately searching for pieces with which to craft (and, as mentioned, to live) should be built into the game.  Crafting should not be optional.  As others have pointed out, a crafted stone axe, or ability to swing the tire iron, or freeze meat outside, required thawing times, etc are the types of additions I'd be interested in.  Anything that adds depth to the experience.  Also, there are a lot of things that don't make sense yet. *Open a can and throw away the scrap metal?      *Sniping locations, in trees, are impossible, but if I have to put 10 arrows into a bear to bring it down I'm not going to pick that fight from somewhere it can reach me.  Right now I use a fenced in porch at a nice house by the gas station...      *There's really no reason to ever catch a rabbit, and therefore make snares, except to make mittens, or repair mittens.      *The primary purpose of corpses is almost entirely for feathers.  Luckily they're renewable.       I'm in general agreement with the ideas in this thread and also with /u/Kraelman in this thread.  (Edit - Formatting)"
thelongdark,3e2u2a,catharticwhoosh,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"We need reasons to go outdoors     Food scarcity IMO is the way to achieve this.  Right now there's never any reason to go more than 100 yards or so from your chosen dwelling, simply because the wildlife will respawn every 24 hours or so.  If deer/rabbits/wolves/bears would stay dead for a while it would facilitate the player's movement around the maps instead of staying in one spot forever.  Randomizing spawn locations when they DO respawn would make the player actually hunt and look for prey, instead of just going to the same spot that the deer always spawns at.    It would also potentially make wolves your actual competition for food.  Sometimes you see a wolf jump a deer and you just ignore it... but if that deer isn't going to come back for 50+ days or so, can you ignore it?"
thelongdark,3e2u2a,Kraelman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:24:40 2015 UTC,I'd like more edible plants like sumac and birch bark animals should be hard to catch but one can find edible plants fairly easily in the woods.

He had to survive 50 day, obtain a flare, and light it on lookout point.  At that point a helicopter rescues you.  Something like that would be really cool.

I knew that realistically I wouldn't get to day 200, but I was fine with that. I had a fun journey.  Besides, as much as I love it, at a certain point the game just gets a little boring.

Oh look, it appears that there is a camp office just down that slop--- OH GOD WOLF! WOLF ALL UP IN MY FACE! WHERE DID YOU EVEN COME FROM!?   Made it to the camp office. Clothes in tatters, no food, no water, less than half of the ammo I started this trip with. Fuck Mystery Lake.  Adventuring Day 4: Oh look. A wolf. BLAM!  Oh look. A deer (being chased by a wolf)... I'll watch the deer die, then BLAM. Stupid wolf.  Oh look. A wolf has chased me to a fishing shack. BLAM! I need ammo!  [searches fishing shack] Yay! Ammo! and a hunting knife! This is the first one I've seen! Now I can skin things with efficiency!  Adventuring Day 4: Skinning, cooking, boiling, and repairing all day long. And a bit of fishing. Wolf corpses everywhere.  That's it. That's been my latest play-through to date. So many wolves in Mystery Lake! More than I've ever seen. I'm pretty happy ammunition seems to be in steady supply in this play-through, even though it took forever to find even a single hunting knife.  Good times."

From talking about sending my deer guts to college, to singing to the fire barrel, to starting a water collection - the pressure of surviving the harsh conditions of the Canadian wilderness begins to have a psychological impact. Perhaps things will get better once I'm finally able to leave the station. If I ever leave, that is."
thelongdark,3dif23,sewiv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:42 2015 UTC,"Stalker.  I started in ML, lived in the main cabin there by the lake for a while, moved to the trappers cabin for a while, then to the dam.  Got bored, moved to PV through the dam.  Left a bunch of stuff in the dam in a locker.    Lived in PV at the farmhouse until I got bored again, wandered around to the radio hut, headed to CH eventually.  Left a bunch of stuff in the kitchen and basement of the farmhouse.  Wandered around CH for a while, spent some time at the log sort, moved to the quonset, and made a few forays out to misanthropes and rabbit island.  Hit the further houses as well (all but two of them were burned), lived there for a while until I had eaten everything I could find or kill.  Went back to quonset, then got bored again, and headed to ravine to go back to ML.  Left a bunch of stuff at quonset.  Spent a couple days in the caves in ravine, then moved back to the dam.  Surprised at how much stuff I left in the dam the first time around.    Killed so many wolves, I've given up on repairing the wolf coat. I just make a new one when I get below 70%.  Still have gut and wolf skins coming out of my ears.  I'll likely stop gathering gut, as well.  I have dozens.    Don't have nearly enough deer skins.  Only have boots at the moment.  The pants take so much damage so fast that it's almost a waste to make them.    I will likely head back to PV from here, and I think I'm going to attempt to move EVERYTHING I've collected (except wood and water, of course) to the farmhouse, from both ML and CH.  Seems like a reasonable challenge.  Running out of arrow shafts, though.  Down to my last dozen, I think.  I'll need to explore more, later.  Maybe I missed a stand or two of birch.  Have a couple of rifles, and probably 30 cartridges.  More toolboxes than I know what to do with.  I think I found a total of 8 or 9 simple tools (3 in one bunker), and one quality tools.  Lots of lanterns and fuel, too.  160-ish days, I think.  I think there's something like 40 kg of meat in a locker at quonset.  It'll probably go bad before I get back there.  I've started leaving 2 liters of water, 2 pieces of fir, 2 tinder, and 4 matches in every fishing hut I visit."
thelongdark,3dif23,EndTimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"In the past week, I started playing again.  I haven't played since before the bow and reishi mushrooms and stuff existed, but after Pleasant Valley.  This past weekend, TLD became one of my favorite games again.  So I was in Pleasant Valley, in the red barn, low food, no water, didn't particularly remember what I was doing.  Fortunately, my hunting rifle still had 4:0, very low but enough to go exploring.  Clear air, no wolves, ran straight across the field, and found the farm homestead.  Oh my god best base ever, if I could just clear out some of the furniture anyway.  I looted that whole house, was already sold on the completely enclosed porch outside the kitchen, then found the cellar.  All in all, a work bench, a stove, plenty of storage, a field full of rabbits, and an enclosed space from which to survey the wildlife and weather.  I found some ammo, food, chopped some wood, boiled up some water, took inventory.  It had been so long that I forgot repairs aren't done at the work bench.  My wolf jacket was sub 30%.  Kind of horrifying to realize you need wolf pelts to repair it.  I mean, it makes sense, but that means killing wolves, and I wanted desperately to keep ammo for self defense only.  In the house there was a Mariner's coat, so I put the wolf coat into storage.  Its values were slightly lower in its damaged state and I didn't want the thing to break.  I still wasn't sure or didn't remember what causes clothing to degrade and prayed it wasn't just time.  Next morning, I harvest a bunch of reclaimed wood and make 6 rabbit snares with the 6 apparently-cured guts I have in my inventory.  Place them outside and start running for the cell tower I can see on top of the nearby mountain.  I find my way up, find like 20 rounds of .303, and scrap and food and another lantern, return.  The next day in-game, I head out into the the cold.  With my damaged deerskin boots and rabbit mittens, 100% coat, etc, into the cyan mist; the effective temp is a balmy -4C.  I see a bear.  I need two of them to make a sleeping bag.  I figure other people must have killed them, it must be possible, I'll just start as far away as seems possible.  I fire 6 rounds seemingly out of range, the bear doesn't react at all.  I get closer for shot 7, much closer.  I fire and bear suddenly wants to come get to know me.  Have a conversation over a nice meal.  Shot 8 doesn't kill it, and I get mauled, nearly to death.  I get up and the bastard is about 15 yards away, strutting smuggly.  Figuring it must be almost dead, I shoot it again, and it turns around intending to put my still-bleeding, 7% condition ass down for good.  This is a bad time to realize I never reloaded the gun.  One shot left.  I shoot it and the bear drops dead.  It isn't far to the homestead, but it is cold, I am at 6% condition, having only just used bandages, and I realize my deerskin boots, cargo pants, togue, and rabbit mittens have all been destroyed.  And I spent 10 ammo.  This is the sort of thing I'd reload to a more favorable save after, but TLD doesn't swing that way, as we all know.  On the bright side, I have enough food for a week, and renewed motivation in the form of a powerful desire to make that bitch of a bear into a bedroll.  I looked some stuff up, namely how to aim, because hitting things at range is clearly different from killing wolves 5 feet away from mauling my face.  Also discovered I would need a quality tools to make arrowheads.  Bummer.  Looked up a hunting guide.  At least I have rabbits, loads of bear meat, and some rifle ammo.  I decide to try the comparatively advanced method of chasing a dear into a wolf to get two kills out of one bullet.  I look all over the hills to make this happen, and come up on a fishing pond with one hut AND A BUNKER practically right there.  The bunker water, cloth, some food, scrap metal, a lantern, a single bullet, and a set of quality tools.  And then!  Well, this post is already pretty long, and I'm the only person who cares about the outcome, but I've had some CRAZY risks, brushing by death on two more occasions, but over the weekend, became a pro.  I'm over 100 days now, using the bow to dispatch wolves, and I've made a run back to Mystery Lake.  The new transition zones caught me by surprise and left me outside nearly to nightfall.  I'm in deerskin boots and rabbit mits once again, plus brand new deerskin pants and a full repair wolf coat.  Until I find another stupid way to nearly die, I am SO set to live forever."

As usual, I don't find a gun anywhere. I never find a gun on the Mystery Lake map. Among the things I did find, though, was one of those random bunkers. Then I ran around trying to figure out how to get to Pleasant Valley. Then I remembered you have to go through the Dam and the cave below it. I did so. I found the tower really quick where I always find a gun, which is nice. Then I found the Homestead as quickly as I did the tower (I don't know the map at all), so that was really nice. Killing and trapping were working perfectly for me. Camp out there for 3 or 4 days while I waited for all the skins and guts to cure. Unfortunately during this process I got bored and shot at a bear a few times. Didn't end well, don't want to talk about it.."

thelongdark,3dg1ug,soda_cookie,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I see it more from a gameplay perspective.  Civilized items are ready to go when scavenged. Eat food now, shoot the gun now, wear the clothes now. It's so much easier, but you use it knowing that these things will run out eventually. It's a band-aid measure, but that's fine.  Natural items have to be pried from the jaws of wolves, cured for a week, before being crafted in a 12-25 hour marathon. And the result? The clothes are as heavy as sin. Bows are harder to use than rifles. Meat weighs a nautical ton. You spend more time outside with the blizzards and wolves and bears. But for your efforts there should always be saplings and hides and whatever you need to live this way. It should be harder, but it should be sustainable."

They're cheap and plentiful in Canada - especially in Northern Canada. Just about every hunting rifle I have ever seen or owned has one attached or sitting nearby.  Candles. They don't need to produce heat, and they could be made using rendered animal fat, and they would be a nice way of lighting a dark room at night. And while we're on the subject of candles... Frozen beehives. Honey and beeswax would be handy for a bunch of things. Maps. Almost every house I've ever been in has a map of the surrounding area, even if the map is one of those silly touristy ones.  The ability to swing the prybar at wolves. It's a long, heavy piece of metal, why wouldn't you be able to swing it around? Drying/curing racks: I'd love to be able to cobble together a simple drying rack from reclaimed wood; the rack could grant like a 15% bonus to curing times for skins, or allow dried fish or game to last a bit longer before spoiling."

There's an awful lot of useful stuff that can be scavenged from a downed plane, particularly if it was landed in a non-crashy-smashy way. We know from the description of the storyline so far that the plane didn't run out of gas, and aviation fuel is basically kerosene, so there's a LOT of fuel for your lantern, and for starting fires.

Pesonally, I dislike how sparing I have to be with the lantern.  I think there should be batteries and flashlights, and perhaps a rare outdoor solar panel charge kit to charge rechargeable batteries for the flashlights.  It would be something more to do, another time element to juggle.  Do you like light?  Well you can either burn kerosene, which is not renewable in the slightest, or you can use expendable regular batteries, or rare rechargeable batteries, flashlight, and charging kit, but charging the batteries requires you to lay the panels out like a bedroll, only working in sunny weather, taking wear damage during inclement weather, with the batteries possibly being damaged when used in extreme cold and becoming worn through repeated use to virtual uselessness.  You'd have to balance the time you wanted to babysit the panel outdoors with collecting wood, meat, water, cooking, foraging for materials, crafting, etc, and plus it would be nice to have a little reminder this is the present-ish day."

(In the context of traditional shark hunting through the ice sheets of Greenland.)      Could definitely save a run when you're stuck outside far from any shelter and don't want to risk getting stuck in a blizzard, when can't see where to go for lack of visibility.

If you run out, you start losing condition (burning fat) at 1% per hour, so the most you will really ever lose in a day is 12%. As long as you eat up before you sleep you will be back to full health, so you pretty much have unlimited fat reserves.

Spent a hard night with no bed roll and total exhaustion in a blizzard crawling from one rock face to the next and foraging wood for 15 minutes of added exposure for another shot at life-sustaining fire.  Even with a bedroll, can't afford to sleep long during a blizzard.  The game is beyond capable of killing you with cold even in wool undies, togue, scarf, rabbit mitts, wolf coat, deer pants and boots, and a bear bedroll.

Go in, grab the stuff you need, and then go down a floor, then through a door, and then down one more set of stairs (it will continue to go deeper so be careful). Go through that door and you'll be on the other side of the Dam. Go down the Dam and then follow the lake until you get to a cave. Get through the cave and you will load into Pleasent Valley. Have plenty of matches, flares, or any light source for both these places. They are very dark."

thelongdark,3deo2m,lightningp4w,3,Wed Jul 15 23:56:31 2015 UTC,You have to discover them in game. Only then you can choose the other two as the starting map.
thelongdark,3deo2m,schwadorf,2,Thu Jul 16 01:25:22 2015 UTC,"coastal highway has the highest amount of canned foods, so that's probably the best map for starting out. (Un)Pleasant valley seems to have a lot more storms than the other two, and mystery lake is the middle ground between the two."
thelongdark,3deo2m,Hitandrun127,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"I would say Mystery lake would be best for beginners. There is going to be at least one rifle on this map, with bullets sprinkled around even on stalker. Less number of wolves (they added bears apparently) and good hunting locations with clear lines of sight to make travel safer.    Coastal Highway has so many wolves, twisty turny pathways, blind turns, and this increases the chances of being ambushed.   Pleasant Valley unfortunately has extremely cold temperatures and lots of bears on stalker difficulty getting set up was the hardest map I have encountered because the incredible distance between structures pushes you into minor condition loss between trips. That farmhouse is amazing though."
thelongdark,3deo2m,CuteBeaver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"Probably PV, in my experience. Shit Wolf Riviera (AKA Coastal Highway) has way too many wolves, as the informal name suggests, and Mystery Lake has horrible lines of sight that'll have you blundering into wolves as often as not. For these reasons I find PV is a great place to get your initial setup on, and the farmhouse or radio control hut excellent platforms from which to launch looting expeditions of the other two maps."

thelongdark,3dcx21,CastleLAX3,8,Wed Jul 15 07:53:32 2015 UTC,"You need three things to survive indefinitely: a place to sleep, something to drink, something to eat.     Clothing is not necessary for survival as the interiors of houses are a constant temperature, and many of them are +1-2C which means you can walk about naked just fine, and the beds usually give a +2-5C bonus as well.  Taking a bit of freezing damage outside is fine so long as you have a safe place to heal up.   Snares are effectively infinite as rabbits provide gut.  Therefore, food is effectively infinite.   Wood can be gathered by hand just fine.  The Magnifying Lens can be used to start fires to melt/boil snow.  Therefore, water is infinite.     Even if the tools go away you can still harvest fresh corpses by hand while they are unfrozen, or you can use the magnifying lens to start a fire and harvest them by hand.  I've done several runs on my twitch stream where I simulate the very, very late game.  It is do-able.    But the fact of the matter is you will die of boredom or a mistake, or more likely a mistake brought on by boredom long before you reach that point of having no tools and no clothing."
thelongdark,3dcx21,Kraelman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm anticipating death by mistake driven by boredom.  I added 70 days this past weekend, and just last night the cabin fever was getting to me, so I traversed the entire map leaving behind bunch of perishable deer and wolf meat, 7 rabbit snares, rifle, and gallons of water so I could go find rifle ammo, kerosene, and scrap metal while using only scavenged food and a bow.  I am confident that it would be easy to get 200 days at the farmstead, but I need a few more close encounters with death before I turn back into an eat-drink-sleep bot."
thelongdark,3dcx21,EndTimer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"My last play through I got bored so I went hunting wolves.

That is why I'm excited for story mode"
thelongdark,3dcx21,the_foxy_cow,7,Tue Jul 21 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"You have to wean yourself off of the tit of civilization and become a total savage. Make animal clothing. Find resources to build a bow and arrows, because those bullets won't last long. Once you've got centralized shelter with stockpiled wood, you can fish every day, check your snares, and maybe go knife-fight a wolf.  I pick fights with them as much as possible, purely for the chance that they may die in an opportune spot for me to collect their meat after I've run off to rest and rehab from the fight.That's about as sustainable as it gets. With proper rationing of calories, you don't have to do much but sleep, repair your clothes, and run your errands for a looong time. You are correct, though. After the metal runs out, you're kind of fucked. Metal shortage signals the long descent into the pit. BUT, that's a long way off if you are ruthlessly efficient concerning your trips outside and caloric intake."

thelongdark,3dcx21,the_foxy_cow,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:10 2015 UTC,traps are a way to go. You can also just stalk wolves and get the scraps from the deer leftover. Or just fight off the wolf.
thelongdark,3dcuyv,QueequegTheater,2,Wed Jul 15 07:26:07 2015 UTC,"ya fishing is a good way to get calories early. Just make sure you keep a fire going or else you can get in some bad shape. And no need to cook the fish, i always use it as a way to just get something for the day. Like if am planning to go for a hike all day ill fish if the weather is shitty with a fire near me. Get some fish for the hike.  Another fun tip that I started doing very early is that I never shoot deer. I only ever shoot a wolf after it has killed a deer. 1 bullet, 2 times the meat and fur/guts.   Aside from that, I would just say dont be afraid of dying hahah. And pick it back up again, or take a break for a bit then hit it again. Tons of fun  Oh, and make sure you dont break down everything you get. That can really make for a sore experience I have found. As in more frustrating than anything. Just think ""will i ever need this at some point or are the parts worth more than the whole"".   Learn from exp with that though."
thelongdark,3dcuyv,Thefluffydinosaur,2,Wed Jul 15 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"If at all possible, make sure you shoulder the rifle and crouch before shooting at a wolf.  You do not want to be moving forward or backward or strafing if you can avoid it, because your aim will be thrown.  If the sights aren't still and the rear ones roughly flush with the top, your aim is off to some extent. If you're already doing that, wait until a wolf is pretty close before firing, 1-2s away from you.  With you crouched down and it running at you, you basically can shoot it anywhere in the black oval-oid that it appears to be according to your perspective and hit it.  Shooting it once in the face will kill it outright. Lighting a flare will keep some wolves at bay.  Throwing one at a wolf normally makes it run.  Lighting one and dropping it can potentially keep the wolf at bay, standing and growling, letting you line up a kill shot. 1 on the keyboard will bring up flares, 3 will bring up the rifle or bow.  If a wolf is stalking you, but not yet sprinting and barking at you, 4 will drop an inventory item like meat or beef jerky to attract the wolf temporarily. If you can see the direction of the wind kicking up snow, your scent is being blown down wind and will catch the attention of a wolf even if it is not looking directly at you, causing it to start approaching. If you can avoid it, never, ever willingly fight two wolves at the same time.  Go far, far around."

thelongdark,3dcuyv,Cewkie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:06 2015 UTC,"Flares to get away from wolves.  Pop one when you aggro them. They'll stop short of you. Get close and toss it at them. They have a high chance of fleeing.  Alternatively, the knife increases the damage you do to wolves making a single encounter less fatal. If you do aggro a wolf you CAN outrun him if you dodge around obstacles. It's very rare and really only helpful in hard to traverse terrain, but it is possible. They usually stalk you for a bit before charging you. Once they run at you, they are attacking you.  Other than that, it just takes some time to learn where the wolves like to congregate and spawn."
thelongdark,3dcuyv,Cewkie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:53:09 2015 UTC,"I knew about the flares and the knife, it's just super hard.  I can't hit anything with the rifle, so I inevitably starve quickly, then I get careless because I'm desperately searching for food at like 100 calories, then I get hit from behind, and I die before I can get back to the homestead.  I'm probably going to go down to Voyageur mode."

thelongdark,3dcfzm,BlazingFyre,3,Wed Jul 15 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"This is something I posted a while ago that explains my own personal theory on what has happened, why there are so many bodies, time lines, etc.    I believe the running explanation is a series of solar storms creating massive flares which have a sort of EMP like effect across the globe. I'm sure there is a much more accurate and scientific way of explaining that, but I'm not a scientist so sue me.  As for the lack of living people, at least in the current sandbox, I like to think that when you start a game, it is actually been about a week since things started to go to shit. Like, you can just add a week to the ""You have survived for..."" counter. The little backstory to explain this is that there were supplies and equipment in your plane, and when it went down, you were doing OK for a while, but then something happened and you got separated from the crash site/supplies, and now you thrust in to the REAL survival situation. That's just me though, YMMV.  This also provides a (sort of) explanation for the bodies. The population would have mostly moved out for the winter anyway as they normally do, most of these places being only for fishing/logging in the warmer months. So there are only a few people left, basically the caretakers/weirdos who stay there through the winter. Solar storms start up, they (individually) decide to try and hightail it South while they still have a chance. Turns out they aren't as good at surviving as you are. Combined with the backwoods psycho who is stalking you (what? You guys don't imagine that there is someone, somewhere, following you through out the game? Just always outside of your field of vision?) and that's why the only other humans you come across (so far) are dead."

thelongdark,3d3gzc,HauntedGrass,2,Mon Jul 13 12:18:35 2015 UTC,You'd probably freeze to death before you would be able to dig a hole. At least in an emergency situation. Frozen ground is fucking impossible to cut into.
thelongdark,3d3gzc,HoodedHound,2,Mon Jul 13 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I meant dig a hole in the snow."
thelongdark,3d3gzc,HauntedGrass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"Ohh, my bad. I didn't read it right. Protection from the wind is a good idea with that, as long as the snow is nice and compact."

thelongdark,3cz66u,PKBitchGirl,9,Sun Jul 12 02:48:03 2015 UTC,Quote from the Early Access section in the FAQ:   Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access? “Our intention is to remain in Early Access until we launch the full Story Mode game in 2015.”    So no.
thelongdark,3cz66u,SideOfBeef,7,Sun Jul 12 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"I was actually going to post about this...I've noticed a lot of games are being released as ""early access"" but you know...that just means incomplete. Rust, ARK, TLD, Day Z, some of these games have been on ""early access"" for years...The good thing is that this game at least is not super buggy, and it is absolutely playable but it seems like it is a trend for studios to release unfinished games."
thelongdark,3cz66u,Darthandres,6,Sun Jul 12 05:39:53 2015 UTC,It's no secret Early Access is meant for games still in active development. No one can buy a game in Early Access and then complain it's not finished because the warnings are plenty and that's literally what Early Access means.
thelongdark,3cz66u,Carapassa,2,Sun Jul 12 13:45:46 2015 UTC,"The point is that many of these games seem like they will never leave early access - they've been in it for years and their roadmap/rate of progress indicates they'll stay there for many years to come. If they have a roadmap at all. Realistically, these games will burn out before that time comes. What's the difference between permanent early access and just selling/patching a broken game?  At least TLD has a clear endpoint which seems attainable."
thelongdark,3cz66u,SideOfBeef,3,Sun Jul 12 14:03:11 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the risks are clear upfront. Customers can't expect a full release to be broken, whereas an early access title is known to be not only not finished but risking getting abandoned before release."
thelongdark,3cz66u,Carapassa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:28:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly... Ain't complaining about it not being finished...I paid for the game knowing its still on early access, but I see games like day z or rust that they've been on early access since 2013 lol. Idk bout you but I really hope they manage to get the game fully released by this year. Wouldn't wanna have to wait till, you know, 2017 to play this game at it's fullest."
thelongdark,3cz66u,Darthandres,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"Rust is incredibly transparent about the process of making them game.  Also, remember that if big companies like EA and Ubisoft are able to churn out games like Assassin's Creed at such a high rate it's because they already have a ton of people working on the game on every department, plus a ready-made engine, game assets, etc.  Facepunch, for example, is only a handful of people."
thelongdark,3cz66u,Polypeptide,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"a ton of people   To quantify: it's about four thousand people split between two studios who alternate games (when one studio releases, the other is halfway done with next year's), plus other smaller studios that are assigned to help.   That's how AC works, anyway."
thelongdark,3cz66u,1-Ceth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to point out that the guys working on this are coming from big name franchises, not small-time modders or devs who are fresh out of college and have never actually developed a game.   A decent number of writers, sound engineers, and graphic designers are some higher-ups from Bioware (Dragon Age, Mass Effect, KoTOR). Those familiar with Bioware titles may recognize Jennifer Hale's voice acting (Femshep, Bastilla) as the female survivor, and Maleshep players will likely recognize Mark Meer's robot impersonation as the male.   Their technical director worked on Saint's Row 3 (and I think Dawn of War 2), both of which got some decent recognition for running pretty well on both low-end and high-end systems.   My point is that there's a pool of experience to be played with from this one, as opposed to one of the four dead titles just sitting in my Steam library right now."
thelongdark,3cz66u,1-Ceth,3,Mon Jul 13 20:33:45 2015 UTC,Xbone put it up as part of their own Early Access.
thelongdark,3cz66u,auguris,5,Sun Jul 12 07:21:23 2015 UTC,"You've gotten quite a few answers here, but I wanted to come by and leave this:       The game is currently in an alpha state. What's referred to as ""Early Access"" on Steam is essentially what you now know as Microsoft's new Game Preview program. It allows players the opportunity to play a game as it's being developed, and offer their support and feedback to the community and development team. While this practice might have a shaky reputation in the minds of some due to some of the games allowed into Steam's EA program, it's important to note that the Game Preview program is curated by Microsoft, and all of the games included must be vetted and essentially certified before they are allowed to be pioneers in this program. Microsoft actually sought out Hinterland and The Long Dark to be one of the first two games available through this program, and I believe that in itself speaks to the current level of quality you can expect from the experience.       Of course, I'm sure you've discovered you can play a trial of the game for 60 minutes on XBox One. We usually put out a significant update once a month with smaller patches in between, and will continue to do so until full release, which will be some time closer to the end of this year. Please feel free to check out our official forums so you can join our community and stay updated on the latest news!       Hope that's helpful!"
thelongdark,3cz66u,bethanyhinterland,5,Mon Jul 13 22:51:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say far from it. But yeah far from it.
thelongdark,3cz66u,Alecohol,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"There is a playable version of the game which many people find quite enjoyable (I've logged 260+ hours...), but the final version of the game is not complete, and the story mode is not accessible.  What you have access to is a sandbox mode, where your goal is to survive as long as possible in the three interconnected maps that currently compose the game.   Details about the story mode, which is the 'real' goal of the developers, have been pretty sparse. In fact, I'm not sure what is confirmed, and what is just speculation. It may be episodic, it may follow the changing seasons, it may be about moving south to get back to your family. Not sure at this point."

thelongdark,3cpli7,waffletags,8,Thu Jul 9 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"Either you got food poisoning, or you froze.  You could definitely freeze, it gets down to -30 C at times.  You should have had a fire going, and slept 4 hours at a time with full health or nearly so."
thelongdark,3cpli7,sewiv,2,Thu Jul 9 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely not food poisoning, must've been the cold. Damn it. :("
thelongdark,3cpli7,Cewkie,7,Thu Jul 9 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"A really easy way to get that achievement is to go into a fishing cabin.  I would get as much of a fire going in that stove, then forage as much wood as I could and store it in the containers. I would fish or sleep to pass the time. If you have a couple fishing tackle, you should be able to do it pretty easily.   A rifle is definitely suggested too, since wolves can be aggro'd while in the hut. They have difficulty getting in there unless they're heading right for the door, but at that point, it's an easy headshot."
thelongdark,3cpli7,PocketsLLP,9,Fri Jul 10 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"99% likelihood of death by freezing.  I've seen blizzard temps go down as far as -55, even during the day. If you had clothing in the 20C range and a 12C bedroll, you're still well into freezing. Considering the freezing condition diminishes your health quite rapidly, a blizzard of only 2-3 hours could have killed you outright, especially if you were only at 50 or 60%.  As others have noted, if you spent 2 nights outdoors wearing all that clothing you may have just demolished your clothing's condition. I've had 100% clothing drop below 50% after only 8 hours of outdoor sleep, only some of which was in a blizzard. (I recall this vividly as I was in danger and had freshly crafted mittens.)  Safe outdoor sleeping through blizzards requires 2 fires. Wind can still knock those fires out, even inside the green barns.  If you happened to stream or record this death you should re-watch to see if your clock had the ??? before your death, and if you ate food you might have inadvertently checked your clothing while clicking, which you could review."

There are a lot of things that could happen with an extremely low condition. I know you said it started climbing, but maybe you started starving after a while. Was a blizzard going on at the time? I would not think freezing was even possible with out a blizzard, being decked out with full furs. It is a bummer. I am about in the same boat. I am at 100 days, and I need the same achievement. I will take short naps (6 hours), thanks to your misfortune."
thelongdark,3colo8,IndomitableSam,2,Thu Jul 9 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Started a Voyager game yesterday and chose random location. Ended up in Pleasant Valley right by the fishing pond. Dead body had a hatchet next to it. Grabbed that and a bit of food and a can opener. Trekked up to the radio tower as a blizzard started and went inside. Used up a bunch of matches looking around and looting - which was fine, as I picked up a rifle and a few bullets. Gathered some more food and wood and a hunting knife. And a firestarter - at about 46%. Stayed for a day or so, then headed out and worked my way down the mountain to the farmhouse.  Wherein I found a bunch of clothes, a prybar, food, another gun and a total of about 18 bullets. Spent a day or so sorting and boiling water and such, then went outside to hunt. Took a shot at a deer and missed. Then spotted a wolf, handily near where the deer ran off. Proceeded to follow the chase and gunned down the wolf just after it killed the deer near the road. Looted the wolf and went back to the farmhouse to cook up some meat and start drying things. Spent another day or so sorting and such, then went back out to carve up the deer. Took all that meat and stored it in the container on the porch outside the house and have been taking some out to eat slowly. My 4 sets of guts will be dried in a couple days and I can start putting out snares soon.   The bear and I have a good relationship so far - it stays just far enough way not to notice me as I wander around. I doubt I'll take a shot at it until I'm ready to leave the farmhouse. Which probably won't be for quite a while with the luck I've had so far.  Also have about 20 anitbiotics, 8-10 painkillers and a few antiseptics. I only have 3 bandages though so need to start mapping out natural stuff."
thelongdark,3colo8,dunkelweissmeister,2,Thu Jul 9 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"I'm still on my second playthrough, and I'm pretty surprised that I'm still alive.  I started with only a few hours of daylight left, but I managed to find the dam quickly.  After poking around nervously with matches for a few minutes and not hearing any growls I figured it was safe to explore the lower levels.  I found a fair amount of tools, a pry bar, hunting knife, some slightly better clothes, and a lantern with some extra kerosene.  No gun or hatchet, unfortunately.  I also found a back door out to a river.  Thankfully I decided to wait until I had finished exploring the lower dam before trying the door.  Very encumbered from exploring the rest of the dam, I decide to try the door.  Outside it's pitch black, but with the lantern I can just see a small area surrounded by a fence, a bunch of scrap wood, and a raging blizzard.  I decide I'll explore this area later and turn around to go back in the dam.  Shit, there's no handle on this side!  I start running around to try to find a way back inside before freezing to death, but my visibility is terrible, and I manage to fall off the back of the dam!  I'm not dead yet, though!  Just a sprained ankle.  I ate some painkillers that I'd found in the dam and start looking for a way out of wherever I am.  I'm now freezing, my condition is dropping, and all I can see are sheer black cliffs.  I give up and figure that this is the end for me.  I might as well use this as a chance to try out some things I haven't done yet, so I find a warm spot between the cliff and a fallen log and manage to get a fire going.  Warmth!  I have just enough time to forage for more wood and keep things going.  I sleep without freezing to death and survive until daylight!  The next day, amazed that I'm still alive, I stumble down the frozen river and find a cave.  A dead deer gives me some much-needed meat that I cook over the last of my wood.  The next day I find the other end of the cave, stumble down a hill, and manage to find a farmhouse in the distance.  Holy crap, I'm saved!  I found enough food and extra clothes to keep me in good condition to explore the area.  I just hit 15 days living at the farm and have managed to find a gun, learn to hunt, and craft some nice deerskin boots.  I can't wait to see what else I'll find!

thelongdark,3colo8,waffletags,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"I began the week in Coastal Highway, with a dissapointing start. I didn't think it prudent to bunker down on a map with such dangerous territory for hunting, so I instead did a cursory hike around the territory, picking up whatever lightweight tools and foodstuffs I could find. After only a few uneventful days, I decided to move to Pleasant Valley and hide out for the long-haul, living mostly off of hunting. I ventured into the cave system connecting both maps with a couple days worth of food, several bullets (not quite enough to be considered an arsenal, but enough to be comfortable for a while), and some basic tools/gear.  I hit a good stride in Pleasant Valley. Though there was very little loot to be found, I was successful in finding TWO rifles, and was able to bag several weeks' worth of game. At this point, I was only just starting to become a decent hunter, and tended to waste a fair amount of ammunition. One-shot kills were rare, regardless of the game in question.  The major success in Pleasant Valley was that I managed several successful bear kills--a feat I have been unable to pull off without severe consequences thus far. The biggest lesson learned with bear hunts has been caution, and planning… in the past I have either been critically injured by a bear I thought I could handle in the open, or caught off-guard by a storm/wolf while harvesting the resulting meat.  After a week or two of non-stop hunting, I realized that many of my basic materials (including rifle ammunition) were beginning to wane. I decided to hibernate in Pleasant Valley for as long as my well-stocked pantry would allow me, and then to migrate to Mystery Lake and regroup. For nearly a month, I did nothing but sleep and eat, while allowing my many animal hides to cure. At around 75 days of survival, I was left with enough hides to craft all the hardware/clothing I could possibly need: wolfskin coat, deerskin boots/pants, rabbitskin mittens, and even a bearskin bedroll. I set off for Mystery Lake.  Entering Mystery Lake through Pleasant Valley proved to be the most stressful part of my survival, as I had to enter through the notorious Carter Dam and face the acrobatic, window-smashing wolf Fluffy. The encounter was brief: I quickly perched myself above the ground floor of the Hydro Dam, and waited to hear the clatter of wolf claws on concrete. In a matter of seconds, my ears were ringing and Fluffy was dead.  From the Carter Dam, I moved across the Mystery Lake map in pursuit of Trapper’s Homestead. Except for a brief encounter with some more unfriendly wildlife at the Derailment, the trip was uneventful. I looted the Camp Office and proceeded along my way. It was at Trapper’s Homestead that my hunting really improved. Here, I managed to not only bag several deer and repair my hide-based clothing, but also managed to one-shot two bears.  It was here I managed to survive beyond 100 days.  After an awesome run, I finally died trying to get the “Beneath the Starry Skies” achievement sleeping in the crawl space in the abandoned shed outside the cabin. It's always the stupid mistakes... :(  This was a personal best though, so I'm thrilled! 106 days on Voyageur! Love this game."

thelongdark,3colo8,Cewkie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:02:31 2015 UTC,"I survived for around 16 days. Hardest Difficulty.  Started in Coastal Highway with no flares. I spawned by Misanthrope's homestead. Terrible start, in my opinion. I went for the majority of Coastal Highway without any tools. I traveled from Misanthrope's to Jackrabbit, then to the Townsite. I was encumbered the entire time, absolutely loaded with food. I finally managed to find a knife in a car.  I checked out the Abandoned Lookout after being attacked by a wolf. I rested there, ate a bunch of food. I then decided to go to Mystery Lake and check the Dam and Trapper's Homestead for the rifle ( I had acquired over 20 bullets at this point).  Almost froze to death in the Ravine. Got to the Dam and killed Fluffy by hand because no Rifle spawned. I didn't explore the rest of the dam, just the main area. Luckily I had found some flares.  I decided to trek out for the Office, camp there for a few days, then check the bunker spawn by Deadfall and head to the Trapper's homestead.   As I left the dam, there was a wolf. Okay. I popped a flare and approached him. Tossed it and him and he charged me. Okay, not a big deal. 70% left, and I have enough meds.  Get to derailment. Another wolf, same strategy. Asshole charges me again. Okay, I have about 32% left now. As I get done patching myself I head ANOTHER damn wolf. I try once more to toss a flare at him. Nope. I die from my wounds.  Ballsiest fucking wolves I've ever seen."
thelongdark,3co68x,duncank41,9,Thu Jul 9 12:50:31 2015 UTC,"Might be a little too OP. bears give about 30 times more meat than rabbits, and the idea of a bear trap requiring comparative 30 times more resources than a rabbit snare seems improbable. Bears are just so, so outstandingly good for meat that I have a hard time seeing them implemented as a craftable. But maybe as a rare item, sure!"
thelongdark,3co68x,Phiasmir,4,Thu Jul 9 18:27:09 2015 UTC,"My first thought was that the trap either takes a lot of effort to set up (thus burning calories), or that it has a chance to prematurely snap during setup.  So you have to risk seriously injuring yourself and taking time to recover in exchange for the bounty of meat.  Though that may be too punishing.  I agree that they should not be craftable, but instead be quite rare.  Similar to the rifle."

thelongdark,3co68x,JErosion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:16 2015 UTC,"They would need to develop a risk equivalent to the potential reward.  Some kind of interface to set the trap, like that for fighting wolves, where if you didn't get it all right you'd receive a significant amount of damage.  Like others have said, I dont see this as a craftable, unless they implement a new rare resource.  That would be fun, but I think something like rifle spawns on a lesser scale would be more ideal."

The + 7 from the Wolfskin coat is really huge when you compare that with other items.

For example if I'm camping for the night I don't need the pack on if I'm going to be cooking, foraging wood or repairing clothing…  I love this game a lot! I just ended a 21 day run last night that came to an abrupt end when some raw food was eaten.

thelongdark,3ckxmf,alex3omg,3,Wed Jul 8 18:39:42 2015 UTC,"You need a few hours before a wolf will respawn to another nearby location.  I think that the way it works, is that each wolf (or bear/rabbit/deer) has a set of spawn points within it's territory, and they randomly jump between them at certain intervals. I think that jump is only going to occur when you are doing an activity where the screen goes black, like sleeping or gathering wood.  The camp office has a potential wolf spawn right outside. Otherwise I think that wolf will be spawned a little further away on the rail line or maybe it's in the path that leads through the snow behind the office... not sure, but if it's not outside, it's likely not to be too far away, keep an eye out.  The camp office, and the trappers homestead both have potential wolf spawns in very close proximity, so be careful. I usually leave the office with a flare in hand, and be ready to light it if a wolf is really close, or turn and reenter the office if it's far enough away. Best bet is to... spoiler"

The system is intentionally forgiving to help out newer players, and the more experienced players can't stand it.    IMO they should change the effects of starvation to be less forgiving on Stalker mode, and keep the current system in Voyager for the new players.  Something like:     Introduce the ability to go negative in your calories, like a -2500 calorie debt.   or   Add effects to starvation, like increased foraging/harvesting times, slower movement speeds, rifle accuracy, etc.   I have a feeling this kind of thing is going to be tuned a lot in the coming months before full release."
thelongdark,3cfaw7,Kraelman,4,Tue Jul 7 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgot to mention that it should be a Stalker mode thing.  Calorie debt is a good idea, so you have to eat 2501 calories just to get out of starving mode."

I suppose you have no problem if hinterland adds some aliens and zombies since the game is not realistic anyway?     You're using a type of straw man argument known as the appeal to extremes in both these statements.     I don't know too much about this area, but does not sound very realistic.    A calorie debt is somewhat realistic.  Imagine the in-game character weighs 75kg.  If you do work without consuming food, you would lose weight.  This could be represented easily by a calorie debt.  If you give a starving person a candy bar, that person is still going to be starving.  With the current system, this is not the case.  Is it perfectly realistic?  No.  The game doesn't have the rules in place to allow for a perfectly realistic solution which would track body weight/fat reserves/etc.     And why do you think it's being ""abused""? If you were to survive in cold Canada with limited food, you would eat every time you are hungry.     If you're not losing condition to any other source in TLD, you only need to eat ~720 calories every 3.5 days.  The 1% per hour condition loss from starvation is nothing when you consider that you can recover 90% condition by sleeping for 12 hours straight.  Foraging firewood while starving is the most obvious example to take advantage of the system as it allows you to negate the 200 calorie per hour requirement.  If you've played the game/been around here or the Steam/Hinterland forums for any length of time you know that this is a common practice for any experienced player."
thelongdark,3cfaw7,Kraelman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:01:01 2015 UTC,"A calorie debt is somewhat realistic. Imagine the in-game character lose weight. This could be represented easily by a calorie debt.   Well it could also be represented as weight loss, which is perfectly normal and does not mean that you will die in a week if you don't get your weight back. As I said the hunger system needs some work, but calorie debt just doesn't sound any better to me. I think it would be better if your condition would lower faster if you do heavy work (running, foraging). That would be more realistic in my opinion, since you would start to gain your condition back when you have eaten well, instead of eating 1500 calories and still dying from hunger a few hours later."
thelongdark,3cfcwx,chowder007,3,Tue Jul 7 14:01:33 2015 UTC,Another survivor learns the value of 100% condition all the time.   You'd be surprised. The early game feels really different than the later parts. Its actually fairly fun to just not care and try out new approaches.

thelongdark,3cavvt,Swagrodamus,3,Mon Jul 6 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"There is a minimum of 1 rifle per map, but there's usually more than one.  Check the nooks and crannies.  Some will spawn next to dead bodies outside(listen and look for crows circling), some will be inside the more ""unique"" locations.   RNG is a small factor in most things.  How much meat is on an animal corpse, the chance of X tool spawning in Y location, what's inside that cabinet, etc.  Different containers have differing chances on the various loot types.  Very early in the run RNG can play a significant factor, but later in the run it all evens out and doesn't really matter at all.   If you're new, I recommend roaming about and exploring the map.   The planned release date is sometime towards the end of the year."
thelongdark,3cavvt,Kraelman,2,Mon Jul 6 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"I am assuming you start in Mystery Lake. The rifle I have found in a lot of different places there. The Dam is probably the most likely, though it is dangerous to go in there. The hunting knife usually spawns at Trapper's Homestead for me. Loot location is random, but I'm pretty sure at least one copy of every major item (rifle, hatchet, knife, etc.) spawns in every game, and almost always multiple copies.  Travel is the most dangerous part of the game IMO, so staying put until you are running low on resources is the safest idea. You can survive for quite a while in one spot if you manage your resources well. That being said, exploring the world is really fun and rewarding, so I would recommend being on the move. The worst that can happen is you die and start over :)"
thelongdark,3cavvt,gampo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:33 2015 UTC,Why is it dangerous to go in the dam? I've had a few play-throughs at this point and I have always ended up sweeping through that building.

thelongdark,3c643a,chowder007,5,Sun Jul 5 04:39:24 2015 UTC,Something to note is that fatigue will impair your aim with the bow. The devs said they plan to do the same with the rifle but right now the rifle is more accurate because of this.

thelongdark,3c643a,12_Gage,3,Sun Jul 5 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"I find it very effective against wolves.  I aggro them into charging, then shoot them point blank in the head.   I've only shot at two deer with it.  One fell down dead, but my arrow was nowhere to be found.  The other ran for miles, also with my arrow. I eventually lost the trail on that one.    I just herd deer to wolves now, and kill the wolf to get the deer."
thelongdark,3c643a,sewiv,3,Sun Jul 5 14:06:26 2015 UTC,Herding is imo still one of the more effictive ways to get lots of meat.  Flare - Free deer! Knife - Free deer and maybe free wolf(ok not free but still)! Rifle - Lots and LOTS of meat. I had in a game with rifle 120 lbs of cooked meat stashed. In the current meta kind of OP because there are so many bullets lying around Bow/Arrow - Free deer and hopefully a killed wolf too!
thelongdark,3c643a,ThePianistOfDoom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:52:20 2015 UTC,Herding deer is a great idea. I haven't thought of that one. I just wait for them to encounter on their own
thelongdark,3c643a,12_Gage,3,Sun Jul 5 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"ya i just stalk wolves by mystery lake. Pick an area where you have shelter near by (camp office), and wood already set up for a fire. I go near where i think I will find a wolf, then I stalk it until it finds a deer. I chase it while it chases the deer. Once they get the deer i creep up and either make it run away or kill it too.   The benefit of doing this near a shelter is because of all that meat you will most likely be encumbered. Then save the quality of it by already having wood. And just cook it asap.  Something to note which i have yet to understand. 1kg of meat is over 2 pounds. Yet it only gives 800 cal? That doesn't seem realistic to me at all. Also the rate in which you burn them seems entirely too fast. I understand cold weather impacts the burning of calories, but that is for another discussion i guess."
thelongdark,3c643a,Thefluffydinosaur,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:54 2015 UTC,I find it best against deers. And you will in most cases have to chase them afterwards.  Unless there is some secret measurement thing that I just havn't figured out when aiming.

At a certain point everything clicks, and that's you getting over the learning curve.   The game is different in the first few days than it is in the middle, and really different if you're going for a longer game. In the beginning it's about finding enough food and not dying in a blizzard. In the middle it's about accumulating a good cache of supplies and crafting yourself some gear. When you're on an endurance run, it's about managing the decay and attrition rate of resources: when there is literally not another scrap of cloth or matchstick to be looted in the game, but you still need a fire and your clothes still need to be repaired with what you have already collected.  The game is supposed to be modeling a semi-realistic world, and apart from the quirks of game design, common sense usually applies: plan ahead, and don't take unnecessary risks."
thelongdark,3c0xbg,Sidereel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"I would recommend remembering where the good spots are. New players spend a lot of time looting places for food but survival requires tools. Make it a priority to get a knife and hatchet.   If you're having trouble with cold there's a few things you can do. Warmer clothes are great but you can't always find them. If the weather is really bad get inside and wait it out.   If you are outside and get caught in really cold weather you have a choice: you can build a fire and try to keep warm, or you can race to find some shelter. As I've gotten better at this game I choose to run for shelter more. Fire tends to go out in the wind and the bedroll only adds a few degrees. Cold is dangerous but you have a lot of time before it kills you, so just get inside somewhere."

thelongdark,3bzzie,getElephantById,4,Fri Jul 3 18:40:55 2015 UTC,"Everything in this game is frequently getting rebalanced, but they've actually improved the fishing quite a bit since it started. It used to be a complete waste of time, and now it is not.   The key thing is that you need a lot of wood, so you either need to have a really good stock at the beginning, or you need to spend the first few hours of the day foraging. The math works out a lot better if you forage for fir with a hatchet, rather than barehanded. In fact, it may not even work out to be a net gain if you don't use the hatchet to find wood, because it takes so much longer and fatigues you so much more.  That means fishing takes a lot of scrap metal, because you use scrap not only to make fish hooks, but to repair your tool after opening the hole and foraging for wood every day. If you have a surplus of scrap metal and don't mind spending it, you can quickly work up a good surplus of fish, supplemented with the occasional deer you can steal when you see a wolf bring it down on the ice.  Trapping, on the other hand, still seems to be a waste of time, at least for now (except in one particular location in Pleasant Valley).  Also, who builds an ice fishing hut without a door?"
thelongdark,3bzzie,EnterNameHere42,2,Fri Jul 3 17:12:12 2015 UTC,I don't think you can actually forage for wood on the Xbox without a tool. I don't know that it needs to be adjusted a ton. Just a little bit.

Food:   1500cal of lightweight food 2litres of water     Tools:   Fire starting stuff Hatchet Lantern Crowbar Bedroll (caught in a blizzard, freezing and need a place to sleep? Find a cave, burnt hut, etc and start a fire; then rest in one hour increments keeping fire going)     Materials:   x5 Kindling x1 Cedar wood (enough to start a fire)     You don't need anything else while searching or gathering and can be left behind at your base. N.B. Put items that degrade into containers; if you don't know what does, put everything in containers and learn which ones do."
thelongdark,3bypfk,fourfivesix76,2,Fri Jul 3 08:18:49 2015 UTC,"If your like me and you move slow in this game then set up a homebase and only bring out what you need for short trips. For me its usually a knife, crowbar, sleeping bag .5 liter of water and one piece of meat. You should be carrying around 25 pounds with including all the animal clothing giving you extra room to bring back more gear."
thelongdark,3bypfk,rooster68wbn,2,Fri Jul 3 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with fourfivesix76 but most of the times I travel with out a sleeping roll if I know where I'm going has a bed. I tend to scout (with a bedroll) then go home drop all the heavy gear crowbar, bedroll, rifle ext. and wait till early in the morning and make fast trips with out being encumbered with gear. I can clear a village in a day with good weather. but it has its risks I have been trapped in bad weather in between my home and my looted area. but I tend to make it some were I can warm up and rest."
thelongdark,3bypfk,fourfivesix76,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks yea I forgot to mention the rifle, thats definitely factored into the 25 pound build I was talking about. Also couldnt agree more on keeping the trips short because of bad weather, being stuck without food for a few hours has been game over too many times."
thelongdark,3bypfk,rooster68wbn,2,Sun Jul 5 04:33:35 2015 UTC,same that why I carry tea and soda and coffee only on these trips. it kills the preverbal two birds one stone; they give you food and it hydrates and the coffee replenishes your stamina. also on the plus side they are all easily warmed in a few minutes.

thelongdark,3bwq99,GrandfatherRat,2,Sat Jul 4 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"Right? When you're new(ish) to this game, it's actually impressive how easily you can go in circles. I think the woodsy areas of Mystery Lake are actually some of the most confusing in the game...makes it kind of a weird default starting zone in retrospect."
thelongdark,3bwq99,Viraus2,2,Fri Jul 3 06:30:14 2015 UTC,"Had a similar situation half an our ago. Started a new game, spawned somewhere unfamiliar. After 1 day of struggling I used all the resources I had.. I was basically starving to death, it was getting dark, storm started, sprained ankle, and then a miracle happened - found a dead animal with 2 kilos of meat, fuck yeah - I am going to survive the night.    I found a nice place outside, start a fire... didn't work... Start again, it worked and then somehow I was on top of the fire and my guy burned to death immediately.... damn.. that death was ridiculous, but the game brings some awesome, unique adventures"

thelongdark,3bxumq,NuclearWinterMusical,6,Fri Jul 3 01:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, there are both Maple and Birch saplings, but the locations vary. Yes, it's got a ton of houses that are lootable, just watch out for Wolfsville, population Wolves. You can get back to Mystery Lake the way you came in (I assume that's how you arrived), and there is a passage to Pleasant Valley you can look around and find as well."
thelongdark,3bxumq,getElephantById,3,Fri Jul 3 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"As far as the area being a good place to be, I would argue it's not. It has the best supply of lootable houses/buildings, but there is an abundance of wolves as well.   The highway is a great place to move through. You can get whatever you need, but if you want to settle and make a base it is the worst map. Some people might disagree with that statement but stalker really puts it into perspective."

thelongdark,3bxumq,Thurendeil,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:29:33 2015 UTC,Right but you must first travel through CH to get there. So I guess technically you are right but the way the game plays there is only one way. There is only one way back to mystery lake from CH.

thelongdark,3bvnjs,Rock_lt,7,Thu Jul 2 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been thinking about posting my experience this week. Holy crap I just noticed how long this post is... I'm adding a TL;DR at the bottom. Cheers.  So first thing, I just bought TLD a last week or so during steam sale, so, don't expect a super pro survival story. anyway.  Like I said, I just bought the game and the first couple of days I played on the easiest setting, but after some time it grew stale due to the fact I didn't had wolfs or bears running after me. I saw them coming and going but I never attacked nor I even found a gun or crafted a bow. So after deciding to play on medium settings I decided to read about survival tips and what not.  On my first (easy) play through I found the dam, I explored and after locking myself out on the other end I went to... coastal highway? I don't even know if that's correct, I know I found a grocery where it had tons of food and went around cars but then I quit.  So, medium difficulty. I heard all about the wolves, how to get water from the fireplace, how to scrap for food and all that. As soon as I started a new game on medium I spawned near the Dam! Lucky me, I went inside and tried to grab all I could before ""Fluffy""? went inside, I had almost no light I took me sometime to find a lamp so I used only matches for a while and it was creepy as hell, I found lots of bullets (14 I think) and when I was ready I went out to try to find the grocery I had found before, I managed to cross to the other side of the dam and found a carcass, I spent the night near the generators? and a blizzard came, so I had to make a run for it because there was no cover nearby! I started to head downhill trying to find a house or a hut, whatever, I found nothing and the blizzard was intense so I could barely see.  At last I found a cave! I set up shot near the middle where there was a opening, so I made a fire place to get warm and rolled up my bed. I was so warm while sleeping. After waking up, I retrieved my stuff, had a couple of energy bars and whatnot and decided to explore the cave before heading out. A couple of flares later and some food, I left.  And... another blizzard (or the same I dunno) So there I am, almost freezing again and it was time to make another fire and eat so I could explore as soon as the blizzard dissipated, I had luck since I found some food in the dam so it wasn't the worst of times, I went outside to find wood in the middle of the blizzard, and after a while of fire and eating, resting and humming to myself I decided to try the gods and went outside.  I don't know how or where I was, I just know I ended up in a farm, it was great! I had lots of beds, a tool making thing in the basement, a stove, lots of water and some food, but still no gun. So after making it my home, I explored all around, and by all around I mean I found another farm with a barn, brought some cool stuff, more ammo, no weapon... and a new sight, I mean I didn't noticed because of the blizzard but there was an antenna on top of the mountain right ahead of my place!  New project, plan, mission: go to the antenna thing, for sure I will find a weapon so I can hunt all these deer taunting me every time I leave my place. Also food is getting scarce. So, win win.   I leave my place, on a full stomach, clothes like new, and flares because I never dealt with a wolf so... yeah I think I read something about flares and wolves. I start to climb and realize it's useless so I try to go around the hill, when I finally see what appears to be a way to the antenna I see a wolf!   Damn it not now!  I make a run for it, he was pretty far so, even if he gets to me I'm staying inside the antenna house, I don't care. I'll live of radio waves if I have to.  Once inside, my trusty lamp was full and helped a lot to get all I could get, from food to bullets and scrap metal and a few sodas, I picked all up and then, there I see it, a hunting rifle! Woowoo! My life was safe I'm gonna last a brazillion years! I went out side, I still had some hours left of day light and there was no wolf nearby, so I went down hill as fast as I could.  As soon as I got home, I started to make an inventory and though I still had some food, now was the time to hunt. Deer fear me! Because I'm starving (acctully I wasn't) and I got like 26 bullets! So I went out side. No wolves nearby, no bear (Yeah the bitch was now scared thanks to my shiny new gun!) and I see a deer! There I go, frolicking through the snow and BAM! BAM! BAM! 3 shot and the speedy devil makes a run for it! WTF  WTF... don't go...  So I start to run, I see a bear on the right but ignore it, and all of a sudden. BLIZZARD. Goddamn it! I almost had my first fresh meal! Damn it, I run back home before a bear gets his fresh meal.  I heat myself up, I don't know what else to do... it's day 5 or 6 and I'm hiding inside. It's my time to shine damn it! I'm gonna get me a bear stake! So it's bear hunting season and I'm pretty sure no bear can hold 20 something bullets! Yeah that's the spirit, I'm gonna get stuffed and live like a king. I might even give some bear meat to the wolves that are around the house just to see if they want to play fetch or something.  Anyway, bear hunting time.  I know the game, it's a huge beast it's fast and I got to be quick and coldblooded. So... I sneak out and there I see it. The majestic meal walking around a buster car. ""There's no fish on those cars!"" I scream (Inside, in my head). I start to prone, but the ground is too cold so I just couch. I'm crouching, I'm sneaking, I'm the best shooter in this god forsaken town! It's now or never. I aim.  I shoot.  I shoot.  I shoot.  I shoot.  I shoot I run backwards because he wants me to shoot him closer. I shoot.  I shootIshootisho...  Damn it, I'm being eaten by a bear...  And what is this? he decided to let me live?! I'm in my top 5% condition?! I'm make haste to the kitchen, I grab all my bandages from a cabinet, all the medicine I could and I survive! I'm a freaking survivor! I should be on a god damn Island! I ROCK.  Time to end up that fucking bear it's him or me... again!  I open the door and my nemesis is just there waiting and sniffing the air. BAM. one shot in the head. Still alive? BAM another shot while he was standing up growling like a bear! AND he's down!   The beast is no more, the beast is down and dead and I got like 30kg of meat! I'm in-fucking-vincible!  I grab some meat, that I cook that night, I sleep like a baby curing my wounds and I wake up knowing that there's meat for the rest of the winter, life is good.  So, what's the quickest way of harvesting 20 somethings kilos of meat? I got a axe I might as well pick it all up and put it in the refrigerator. Nice.  And I'm outside, the sun is hidden behind some clouds, and I'm getting my meat, it will take a couple of hours but I'll rest after... If only... I dedicated too much of my strength to pick up all that meat, even when the blizzard started, I wanted to grab all that meat, I needed to fill my refrigerator...  I didn't had time to click cancel while my condition was dropping.  It was a good first run.  TL;DR: Survival at it's finest, died due being a dumbass."
thelongdark,3bvnjs,Tandycakes,3,Thu Jul 2 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"You even already got past the hardest part D:  On the flipside, they say you can take a single shot at a bear and then go inside and wait an hour for it to bleed out. I'm waiting for my chance to try this one out."
thelongdark,3bvnjs,Viraus2,2,Thu Jul 2 18:38:09 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, that was a nice read. Whenever I do a time-passing activity (like harvesting game or fishing) I always do it in small chunks just to be safe. You don't really lose anything by breaking up the activity, and it's a hell of a lot safer.  I really think the activity should stop as soon as your condition begins to drop, though...I mean at this point you're basically dying."

thelongdark,3bvnjs,Tandycakes,3,Fri Jul 3 19:37:30 2015 UTC,"So it's day 20, right? I'm thrilled to have made it this far, despite some questionable decisions. You see, I got it in my head that I really wanted to make it to Pleasant Valley. So I packed up my meager supplies and waited for a nice ""warm"" day and then essentially sprinted my way through from the Camp Cabin > Ravine > Coastal Highway > Mine > Welcome to Pleasant Valley.  This was my first visit outside of Mystery Lake, so in my inexperience, I looked at the map and visited some very underwhelming locations and my supplies were starting to let me know I needed to settle down and stock up. More than anything, luck allowed me to find the farmhouse right before exhaustion hit. Hooray!   2 Things to note right now. One, very importantly, I had some snares and there was a SWEET rabbit spot nearby. Two, of little to no importance, there was a bear WAY FAR to the south. Hardly worth mentioning, honestly.  So I go throw down some snares, loot the house, sleep, and get ready to check my snares. What I find instead is a wolf chomping down on a deer not far at all. I smile at my good fortune and shoot the wolf. The meat and hides were well needed, so I start by just taking the wolf's hide and guts and hoping the weather stays as perfect as it is now. It does, so I start snagging some meat as well. It would be awesome if I could harvest all of this, weather permitting.  It did not permit. Blizzard hits in the short time I was harvesting, but that's no huge deal. I'm pretty weighed down but otherwise warm, healthy, full and whatever word describes not being thirsty. I start slowly trudging back home, wind and low visibility be damned only to bump into OH LOOK IT'S THAT BEAR FROM EARLIER. He hasn't noticed me yet, but his path is heading in my direction and I am moving WAY too slowly to avoid. Shooting him is out of the question what with his gargantuan health bar. So I panic, freeze, and eventually he notices me and gives me a thorough mauling. So, 3% condition, bleeding and in the middle of a blizzard. I die.  Lessons learned? I could have (should have) just started dropping things and made a break for the house. Nothing is so valuable that it's worth dying for."

thelongdark,3bvnjs,moostermoo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"After biting it at 93 days, I took a few days off.  Finally started a new game this week and decided to work on the  Pacifist and Silent Hunter achievements. I used the random start and it finally dropped me somewhere other than Mystery Lake and started me in Pleasant Valley.  I spent 20 days there and didn't find a single hatchet. I did find two birch and one maple stand, but was frustrated at not being able to harvest them to start my bow for when my 25 days of not killing anything was up. I moved on to Coastal Highway and finally found a hatchet - but no maple!  I found three birch stands tho.  I made it my 25 days without killing anything and not a single wolf attack, but still not able to make a bow.  I found three rifles and ended up with 46 rounds of ammo, but couldn't use any of it until day 50.  On day 40 I decided to move on to Mystery Lake to try to find a stand of maple.  I ended up getting attacked by a wolf on the way, but I thought it was a good record for not getting attacked for 40 days.  First thing I found was a stand of maple at the dam! Yay! But due to needing to recover from the wolf attack and weather delays in the ravine, I managed to make it to 50 days before I could make a bow.  At least I can use my rifle now.  I'm going to try for Wrapped in Furs (just need the wolf coat and the bear skin bedroll) and Living off the Land next. Nothing but meat and cattails for the next 25 days! I've been obsessed with the achievements and I only have those two and the 100 and 200 day ones left.  EDIT: I've been playing on medium difficulty"
thelongdark,3bwj7a,Thefluffydinosaur,7,Thu Jul 2 19:02:06 2015 UTC,I hope not. I like having to do it all in my head and really commit it to memory. It adds to the atmosphere and immersion in my opinion
thelongdark,3bwj7a,Nicothedon,10,Thu Jul 2 21:30:32 2015 UTC,I'm all about immersion. But I don't think finding a park map in-game in a tourist lodge or something would break the immersion. It's something you might actually find in a tourist location.
thelongdark,3bwj7a,thudly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:07:51 2015 UTC,Ya that is a totally valid point too. That is what I am torn between as well because immersion is a key factor. Immersion or just a slight convenience the character is a decent cartographer lol. The choices!
thelongdark,3bwj7a,chowder007,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:18:35 2015 UTC,I would prefer the map areas only open up after you discover them. So it doesn't break immersion but also helps you during blizzards and fog.
thelongdark,3bwj7a,FINDarkside,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:15:00 2015 UTC,Exactly. Ya it reveals what only has been traveled. And it doesn't even need a tracer or anything where it shows your current location. Just something to give you an idea of what's around you.
thelongdark,3bwj7a,Ninjakittten,2,Fri Jul 3 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"The map could be just basic map of the area, obviously not showing where you are, and you could find that map from somewhere. Or maybe you could find pieces of map or something."

In most cases it felt like it took something away from the game, rather than adding to it. The sense of being lost, then learning to create a mental map through landmarks and just knowing a place that you've walked back and forth across...this is the feeling we're going for.

I know X1 has limited settings for resolution, but it seems like 720p would be much closer to the native resolution of your screen. Also, I'm not sure if you are using a monitor or a TV, but some TVs have a ""just scan"" or similar option that tells the TV to only display the lines coming in without stretching or otherwise altering them.

thelongdark,3bgfx4,Hinitini,4,Mon Jun 29 06:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, best place to set up camp for long term survival, as far as I can tell. The key to getting into the 100s of days is resource efficiency and hibernation. Yes, hibernation is boring for the most part, but it is the only way to make any kind of run worthy for the leaderboards.   I had the opportunity to play the game from the start and really learn and get used to the game mechanics. I played for a ton of short runs, and then started to wonder what would actually force me to die if I was playing as efficiently as possible for the longest survival time. I wasn't able to come up with an answer, so I thought I would play it out and see instead. Been playing a little after work most days of the week and have been lucky enough to keep the run going without disasters for the last 5-6 months.   My best advice for long-term survival so far:    Don't pick up items that degrade until you really need it (inspecting them starts degradation) Don't repair non-crafted clothes, use the cloth for bandages instead  Get the most out of every bullet (wolf/deer combo or 1 shot bear kills) Don't use tools unless necessary, ie you don't need to harvest all the meat off a bear and wear down your knife/hatchet if most of the meat is going to go bad before you eat it anyway.   Other than that don't take silly risks, watch your back and surroundings when traveling.   After 500 days I can kind of see what the end game might be like, which right now looks like running out naked in the snow with no tools/clothes, 1v1-ing wolves all day and harvesting meat with my bare hands! Or rather BEAR hands I should say! I should have a pair somewhere, had lots of time to take out some bears after all."

But surely after  a bear kill you'd settle down for an extra long hibernation period anyway? That's what I'd do. Or would the meat still go bad because you're eating it less frequently?"

thelongdark,3bevvv,WoeIsTravis_,6,Sun Jun 28 21:32:53 2015 UTC,"Considering how bad your PC is, I'd get it on Xbox. Most games are significantly worse on Xbox, but it could be different with the Xbox One, since it is very similar to PCs, and may not be that hard to port/update the Xbox. Worst case scenario on Xbox it gets updates a few weeks later, but worst case on PC is that you can't run it at all."
thelongdark,3bevvv,Cognittie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:29:45 2015 UTC,Well my PC isn't that bad :( I can probably run it but not at 60fps maybe
thelongdark,3bevvv,Smokey_Bera,5,Sun Jun 28 18:14:45 2015 UTC,I would recommend buying it on steam and try it out.  If it doesn't run well try to get a refund.  Or you could pirate it and if it doesn't run well then you haven't lost anything.  But if it does run well then you should buy to support the developer for making a product you enjoy.
thelongdark,3bevvv,kisspunch,2,Sun Jun 28 18:19:29 2015 UTC,Your PC should be able to run it at 60 no probs. You may need to lower the settings a bit. You won't care if it dips a bit anyway. It's no Counterstrike.

thelongdark,3bdhr7,getElephantById,9,Sun Jun 28 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"Just to follow up, the ravine area used to be a lot smaller, and they increased its size in the last major update. I can only guess about why they would do that. Maybe it's for the story mode, and they need that zone to be gated off so that some event can happen there only after they've let you enter it. Or maybe they just want it to take longer to travel between zones, to make it riskier."
thelongdark,3bdhr7,Peggle20,3,Sun Jun 28 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"The old ravine was about the last 2/5ths of the current one, so it could also be that the rest wasn't finished at that time."
thelongdark,3bdhr7,getElephantById,3,Sun Jun 28 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"Makes sense.   Also, it can't be a coincidence that every connector zone requires you to cross a gap by traversing a narrow beam. The cave, the train bridge, the log over the ravine. That's clearly some design decision, I wonder what the idea behind it is though."
thelongdark,3bdhr7,Peggle20,2,Sun Jun 28 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"You don't have to do that for PV-CH, do you? And the ""narrow beam"" in the PV-ML transition is more like two wide planks side by side. The ML-CH transition is by far the most nerve wracking in this regard, I think."

thelongdark,3bb57w,kingofeggsandwiches,5,Sat Jun 27 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"First things first, you should be playing on Stalker.   Beyond that, the TLD doesn't really have an ""endgame"" once you've stabilized your loot/food situation. The only real answers are to come up with your own objectives, go for achievements, or stop playing."
thelongdark,3bb57w,SideOfBeef,9,Sat Jun 27 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm I don't really feel like I'm ready for stalker. The silly thing being that in once sense I could claim to have mastered voyageur insofar as I can survive 50 days +. Only the other hand I know this to be untrue, if I play different maps I tend to get ripped apart within a week, my skills only apply to an artificial and conservative play style that I've been pushed towards by the urge to survive.   In many ways this is very realistic, I'm pretty sure that if I were stranded in the the wilderness in the middle of Winter and found a nice farmhouse I could survive in then I wouldn't be leaving until it was nearly Summer! However it's not actually the most exciting thing to do.   I also reckon that playing on stalker would only make my playstyle even more conservative, since travelling would be even more dangerous.   One thing I think would be really cool is if there were customisable game modes so you could play with the loot scarcity of Stalker, the weather effects of Voyageur and the animal aggression of Pilgrim if you so wanted. Ultimately what I'm wanting I don't think so much is ""end game"" per se, but perhaps something more along the line of mid game. Not something to ultimately work towards but more reasons to take risks during play that are actually either necessary or will pay off enough to make them worthwhile, or both, other than just challenging yourself to take risks for the sheer hell of it.  For example tonight I'm planning an overnight trip to the abandoned mine so I can give the place a full exploration and looting, sure it would be nice to find a hatchet, a few more bullets on top of the 12 I've got, a bigger supply of scrap metal, definitely need more flares, but I know deep down that I don't really need these to survive. I can just kill a deer every few days and my only other job is harvesting wood for cooking and water and checking my snares."

Yes! This would be such a welcome change, and would go a long way towards allowing people to make the game more realistic. I mean I know that there are inevitably some fudges that have to be made, but being allowed to tweak things like animal behavior would be awesome."

I haven't upped the difficulty yet, but once you find a the rifle, and some quality clothes - it's really hard to want to leave. Why travel to get loot for what? More Soda and Wool Hats?

thelongdark,3b8lh4,japatoes,3,Fri Jun 26 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"This is just my impressions, but it seems like there a set number of total wolves spawned at one time. And they occupy certain general areas by default (e.g. in Mystery Lake there's very often a wolf between the camp lodge and the first fishing cabin on the lake).    When you kill one, that general area is wolf free for a couple of days, then one respawns.  The other thing is, wolves can chase out of their zones. So if that wolf above chases you back to the cabin, when you step out, its general area will have shifted to the area around the cabin and it's old area will be vacant.   And, I think there are more wolves per acre in Coastal Highway and fewer in Pleasant Valley.   Again, just impressions. Curious what other people think."
thelongdark,3b8lh4,PaulFromGaul,3,Sat Jun 27 14:35:02 2015 UTC,"From about ten days in-game time I do believe the wolves are more prevalent in Coastal Highway. Mystery Lake had some notable places worth avoiding to dodge a wolf attack, but I could go a whole day without running into one.   Making camp anywhere near the coast, on the other hand, guarantees at least one direct wolf encounter a day (which is fine, I can use the pelts and the target practice) and three or four other wolf sightings.   I have yet to scope out Pleasant Valley. First I need to make myself a furry coat."
thelongdark,3b4sru,Smooth_McDouglette,13,Thu Jun 25 23:41:37 2015 UTC,"So there are 3 transition zones, as you've said. You've already been to the Ravine. The other two are the Abandoned Mine (Coastal Highway <-> Pleasant Valley) and Carter River (Pleasant Valley <-> Mystery Lake: the one added most recently).  Abandoned Mine: To get here from Coastal Highway, you'll need to climb up a trail that starts right by the gas station. It winds around a bit, but keep on following the path and take a left at each intersection. You should reach the highest point of the map, and the mine entrance will be right there. The mine itself is something of a maze, but has tons of supplies. If you do the ""only take left turns"" trick, you'll make it out in no time.  Carter River: If you enter Carter Hydro Dam, the first door on your left should lead down into the lower level. In the big main room, head to the far left corner and go through THAT door. Head down the corridor and go through the first door on the left to get to Carter River. This is actually a ONE WAY door- you'll have to do a weird trek around the outside of the dam to get back in. The river is pretty mazelike in its own right- I found a video on YouTube that explains it (and how to re-enter the dam) pretty well: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KUr6JQNlC5c  I hope this helped, personally, I think Pleasant Valley is the best region in the game!"

thelongdark,3b5udf,apt_get,4,Tue Jul 7 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"I posed a similar question a week or so ago. Most of the responses help answer your question too I think.  TL;DR: You don't have to eat each time your hunger meter creeps up, and you can actually tolerate starving for awhile. Given the temperatures and level of activity, there were a few who argued that eating 6-8 lbs of meat per day was perfectly realistic, but I tend to side more with the idea that it was done to balance the game and keep it from getting boring. As with other things, once new elements are added to the game, some of the emphasis might be taken away from food and put elsewhere."
thelongdark,3b5udf,apache_alfredo,5,Fri Jun 26 10:25:09 2015 UTC,"8KG of fish a day keeps the doctor away!  Yeah, it doesn't make sense."
thelongdark,3b5udf,VectorVictorious,3,Fri Jun 26 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"As it's been said, the ravenous appetite is for game balance.  If we didn't require so many calories each day, the chance of wolf and wildlife encounters would also have to drop otherwise you'd find yourself with way too much food.  If wolf encounters dropped it would get boring and easy.  I think there would need to be an entire new threat or daily goal added to the game in order to drop caloric need while maintaining your level of gaming need to stay busy.  Maybe the scarcity of wildlife could lead to the need for long hunting trips or better hunting skills or building large animal traps."

thelongdark,3b5udf,sewiv,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"I just run at starving all the time, until I need to sleep and cure back that 1%/hour.  I only eat maybe 700 cal/day, unless I'm flush with meat.  I have a bigger problem eating all the meat I end up with just from self-defense wolf kills before it goes bad.  At times, I just arrow them, retrieve the arrow, and walk away.  I might go out and pick up some stuff later, but I just had a run trying to get to the crossroads from the farmhouse, and I left a trail of dead wolves behind me that I just ignored.  I couldn't carry all the weight if I'd even just harvested the hides and gut.  Shooting a bear is actually a problem sometimes.  I seldom can get all the meat off of it unless I shoot it next to the house, and I can seldom finish it all before it goes bad, unless I just keep my calories pinned at 2500, which seems wasteful.  It'd make more sense if there were more impact from low health percentages, but you can run around just fine at 11%.  Fatigue makes things harder than being at 11% health, which is just silly."
thelongdark,3b5602,rooster68wbn,5,Fri Jun 26 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it has worked many times for me.  You just need to have the item (typically a piece of raw or cooked meat and even beef jerky works ) selected in your inventory, so just have it highlighted. And then if a wolfy comes along you press 4 and you drop the item. If you turn around as you flee you'll notice the wolf slows and sniffs at the dropped item curiously."
thelongdark,3b5602,sparksfly51,6,Fri Jun 26 02:13:09 2015 UTC,I would only be carrying raw meat if coming back from a fresh kill.  Raw meat in your inventory will attract wolves.  Candy bars work fine.  Just make sure you retreat in a straight line so the wolf will walk over the decoy.  A few feet off and he'll walk right by it.
thelongdark,3b5602,VectorVictorious,3,Fri Jun 26 02:51:03 2015 UTC,It works up to a point; if the wolf is growling and stalking you then you can still drop food and back away but if it is already aggro'd to the point of running at you then it's too late - you're lunch.
thelongdark,3b5602,LawrencevanNiekerk,3,Fri Jun 26 06:35:27 2015 UTC,"If i recall raw meat increases the range that predator detect you.  I think it's the calorie count of any meat you drop plus the type (raw vs cooked/preserved) be it raw rabbit,  cooked bear or a bag of beef jerky.  This is mostly just a guess plus observations."

thelongdark,3b4zbv,ShortchangeParamecia,4,Fri Jun 26 00:39:02 2015 UTC,To improve condition you must sleep.  Your condition will improve exponentially by sleeping longer.  A single 8-hour sleep will give you much more improvement than if you took 8 1-hour naps in a row.  Just make sure you are fully hydrated before a long sleep.  I had a bear attack take me down to 8% right after I shot it in the face.  Took me two 8-hour sleeps in a row to heal to 97%.  I only split it up so I could drink.
thelongdark,3b4zbv,VectorVictorious,2,Fri Jun 26 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"Have been fully hydrated, as well as fully fed, with no form of injury or ailment, positive temperature stat due to clothing, a warm fire going, the works.  I improved maybe 7% from 8 straight hours. Slept another 8, got maybe another 5%. I dunno if the game is glitching or if something is wrong I'm just not understanding. I'm currently sitting at 58% condition."
thelongdark,3b4zbv,VectorVictorious,2,Fri Jun 26 03:15:22 2015 UTC,That is weird.  Maybe post that to the Hinterland forum and see if a dev or someone else replies.  http://www.hinterlandforums.com/
thelongdark,3b4zbv,PaulFromGaul,2,Fri Jun 26 04:50:24 2015 UTC,You might be colder than you realize. How's your clothing situation? Where are you sleeping? In a building? How close to the fire?  One thing is fire warming distance is pretty short. In my experience you basically have to be on top of it.

thelongdark,3b4zbv,Feiron,3,Fri Jun 26 22:26:21 2015 UTC,"Get fully fed and hydrated, sleep 4-5 hrs, repeat.  Sleeping too long will cause dehydration 1st, then hunger.  Your recovery rate might slow if hydration/hunger are too high (in the yellow/orange).  I haven't experimented.  It's just a theory :-)"
thelongdark,3b4zbv,VectorVictorious,3,Fri Jun 26 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"Dehydration does ~2% damage per hour, including while sleeping.  Starving does ~1% damage per hour, including while sleeping.  Exhaustion does ~1% damage per hour, almost immediately stopping/recovering when sleeping.  Freezing does 20% damage per hour and recovers (slowly) when it 'feels like' above freezing.    Sleep heals a little more Condition each hour you sleep, e.g. the first hour gives almost nothing, the second gives a little more... the 11th gives a huge amount and in total is usually enough to reach full health; think 'continual restful sleep'.  Sleeping 12 hours gives a similar good boost but you take 1-2% damage from dehydration.  It takes ~11.5 hours of sleep to start taking damage from dehydration if you go to sleep fully quenched.  Starving, Low Condition and carrying raw meat all increase the range wolves take interest in you.  Cancel eating the last bit of high condition meat - thus creating lightweight decoy strips that auto-drop first using the decoy button: Cancelling eating food gives a higher chance of contracting food poisoning, though this is still almost nothing if done on high condition food.  Wearing clothes in a Blizzard is costly and almost useless; high winds eat through clothing condition and do little to stop it.  Once you are freezing, you take damage at the same rate regardless of clothing; might as well strip everything off and put it in your backpack, then proceed naked :) At least until it warms up or you find a house :(    Cardinal Rules:  1) Freezing is bad: Getting lost in blizzards kills.  1) Stay hydrated: It's stupidly cheap and quickly drains you compared/combined with Starving.  2) Starve yourself while awake if you aren't travelling long distance: Condition loss is slow (1% per hour) and the additional wolf range doesn't matter much if indoors or locally farming wildlife.  3) Eat enough calories to heal to high health while sleeping and nothing more.  4) When travelling/scavenging long distance try to max all status (high calories, quenched thirst, well rested), 2L of water + ~1500cal of lightweight prepackaged food, decoy strips & only the tools you need."
thelongdark,3b4zbv,zfoukal,2,Fri Jun 26 10:18:51 2015 UTC,Great info and advice.  Never thought of stripping after freezing status!  Makes sense.
thelongdark,3b4zbv,Feiron,2,Fri Jun 26 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Very good advices, all you said."
thelongdark,3b4zbv,rooster68wbn,2,Fri Jun 26 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"How many calories would that be for sleeping?  So I'm not gonna suddenly drop dead from starvation or dehydration, right? These stats have to follow the same rules that Condition has to hit 0 before I die, yes?"
thelongdark,3b4zbv,LawrencevanNiekerk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"When you click on the bed to sleep you see your current calories, plus the total calories you use while sleeping for the total amount of time; this value changes slightly per difficulty level - 75/hr on middle and 60/hr on most difficult (why lower? no idea), don't know the value for the easiest.  If you are freezing and use a warm bed for an hour to speed things up (good strategy really) you will burn calories at roughly double the rate; so sleep for one hour to warm up without eating even if starving, after waking up warm eat/drink then get your beauty healing sleep.  Always drink last before sleeping (some foods dehydrate you slightly taking 1-2 hours off your ""healing"" sleep time; considering each successive hour gives more healing this is significant.    This means 12 hours sleep will take up to 900 calories (720 on highest difficulty) plus whatever water to quench your thirst completely before sleeping.    Do not sleep outside next to a fire unless you are confident it provides enough warmth for you not to freeze when it gets really cold AND it wont go out when the wind changes (inside a cave or using an outside oven thingie); if you have to sleep outside do it in one hour increments keeping your fire going.    Fires take a long time to warm up the air in really low temperatures such as blizzards or nighttime.  If you are desperate to warm up make two fires next to each other; make one that lasts an hour-ish, then immediately make another next to it using this new second fire as your ""main fire"" letting the first go out. This will double the heating provided for the time the first fire burns warming you up much faster.  For this reason I carry two cedar logs while scavenging; this has saved me more than once when caught in a blizzard or after a wolf attack."

Condition damage by severity: Freezing - Drops condition score very fast.  I haven't done the maths on it but it's really quick. Dehydration - 2% per in-game hour Starving - 1% per in game hour Exhaustion - 1% per in game hour    Sleeping recovers your condition score based on how long you sleep.  Sleeping for 1 hour in a bed will recover you 2%.  Sleeping on a bedroll for one hour will only recover 1%.  However, sleeping for 12 hours straight on a bed/bedroll will recover close to 90%, just make sure you drink water before you sleep.  This means that if you freeze half to death and get mauled by a wolf to ~10%, its possible to be just fine the next day if you can get to a bed, have 720 calories in you and drink and sleep for 12."

Not sure what the xbone controlls are but on PC that means spam right clicking until your power meter is full (completely full) and then one left click and repeat.  You'll kill them much easier if you have a knife or axe in your inventory.  It's much better to just avoid them though. Keep 2-3 flares on hand at all times and pop a flare if a wolf is coming for you. If you get real close and toss it right at his feet he will run away and leave you be unless you've got raw meat on you, then you can pick up the flare and use it against other wolves if need be. Flares last a long long time.  The other option is to use the rifle. For that, wait until the wolf is relatively close and heading towards you in a straight line, that makes headshots easy and it's only one bullet. Don't worry yourself saving those bullets for deer, they won't do you any good if you die."

There's been quite a bit of demand for a 'Save' or 'Save and Quit' button; I hope the devs implement it, 'cause sleeping or popping outdoors to come back in again is a bit awkward just to save your place. They haven't implemented it thusfar because they like the permadeath nature of the game and fear a manual save function might be an exploit around this (or so I've heard). I don't think it would be - no more than one can already save by sleeping before making progress they could undo with a load - but I digress.  You save by sleeping or going indoors. You load using the 'Load' button on the main menu. If you get really stuck due to a glitch or something, there's also a 'Load' button in the pause menu.  But the game is permadeath. If you die, your save will be deleted and you'll have to start over."

On controller I know that Right trigger is equivalent to Left mouse button for most actions, and Left trigger is equivalent to Right mouse button for others.  So you could try mashing RT to charge and then pressing LT to release. Though I know the triggers aren't exactly ""mashable"", it's a game still in alpha so it might be something the devs haven't fully changed yet.  Sorry I can't be more helpful. Perhaps someone else will know. Worst comes to worst, you can start up a few games and go get yourself into wolf attacks deliberately until you feel you've figured it out.

Food left on a table or on the ground will degrade much faster than food in a container.  2 - Wolves can't come inside, not even into fishing huts.  3 - Just eat when you absolutely have to, don't keep the bar up.  4 - The best place varies from person to person.

thelongdark,3b3ffu,J20_Shrapnel,3,Thu Jun 25 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Regarding #2 (edit: #3 actually) I would think that you are better off eating as much as you can. You run the risk of weakening your condition if it goes unchecked. Plus calories eaten don't count against your carry limit. Same goes for water.
thelongdark,3b3ffu,rossffs,5,Fri Jun 26 05:08:51 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're getting downvoted for this.  It is a balance though; you don't want to run out of food but as you say you don't want to risk getting caught out and going hungry.
thelongdark,3b3ffu,J20_Shrapnel,2,Fri Jun 26 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"Thank for your rational response. Does rationing food actually prolong survival though? Consider that ingested calories don't spoil or count against carry limits. And if you run out of food, you are out of food. It doesn't matter whether you carefully keep your calorie count at 1500 or eat as much as you can all the time.  Its like what someone else said about bullets: Don't conserve them, they don't help you if you are dead. (Don't miss either though.)"
thelongdark,3b3ffu,J20_Shrapnel,2,Fri Jun 26 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"That said, IRL rationing prolongs existence by forcing the body to rely on muscle and fat stores and thereby reducing ""constitution"". In The Long Dark, there doesn't seem to be any advantage. You either starve yourself while carrying food... Or you eat as much food as you can, carry very little food and have room for more resources that you come across... or starve if you fail. If you fail, the end result is the same."
thelongdark,3b3ffu,Smooth_McDouglette,2,Fri Jun 26 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"/u/Lumpzor hit all the right notes but I think I'll add a bit.  1 - In terms of meat, you should always try to cook when it gets below 50% as cooking increases it's condition by 50%.  2 - Wolves suck, but they are really easy to deal with when you know how. You can get a wolf to fuck off by lighting a flare, getting really close and throwing it more or less right in front of them. Usually they will run away and not pursue you leaving you free to pick the flare up and use it on a few more wolves if need be (they last a long time). If you have a rifle make sure you wait until they are close and heading in a straight line towards you, easy 1 hit kill w headshot. Don't worry about wasting bullets, they won't do you any good if you die."

I've also set up for extended periods at the trapper's cabin, but it's buried all the way in the corner of the map, so it's kind of inconvenient if you leave something behind. The camp office is hard to beat IMO. It's centrally located, has plenty of food nearby, has 2 stoves, 2 doors, beds, and a work bench. Plus it's big, so there's plenty of room to spread out my animal hides and guts all over the place."
thelongdark,3ayk98,apt_get,3,Wed Jun 24 15:46:54 2015 UTC,"As others have said, other places offer options but few are as ideal as the PV Farmstead. I have spent a long time using the Trapper's Homestead as a base, and it is very nice. Has everything you need inside, good proximity to a lot of rabbits, and close enough to Mystery Lake itself to go on fishing trips without too much trouble. It is however somewhat of a pain to get elsewhere from there.   The Campground Office at Mystery Lake is also another great location. I personally tend to shy away from it because I don't use buildings that have a corpse inside them, as the office often does as a base. This is really just for personal story telling reasons, so if you don't mind that then it is a great base.   As far as Coastal Highway goes, I have spent considerable time at the Townsite, using one of the houses as a base and the Gas Station as a place to craft things. The major problem are the wolves, which are thick as thieves around there. But it is very central, and there is a plethora of food and clothes in the houses all around there.   As far as Pleasant Valley goes, the Radio Tower/Signal Hill has everything you need, with the only inconvenience is that cooking needs to be done outside where the fire barrel is, and the long climb up there.   Personally, I'd rank those sites in this order, best to worst:   PV Farmstead Trapper's Homestead Camp Office Coastal Townsite Radio Tower   Bonus: I have gotten by pretty well for about a week using the cabins at the Log Jam, but that was a bit of a desperation move."

Jackrabbit Island has quite a few as well though it's easier to come and go if you approach from the South, but there's no stove inside and cooking must be done outside.

As far as transporting loot, I'd suggest you just maintain one stockpile in each area and carry only a day's worth of food/water/gear, meaning you'll be < 30kg. You don't need a crowbar, spare tools and a kilo of disinfectant when you're moving around. Realistically, the only way you're going to die is getting ganked by wolves, and that's more likely to happen if you can't run properly.

Trapping is annoying, because it's a really repetitive process, but you can place a lot of them, and you will be able to make more of them for a long time before running out of resources.  The downside of the farmhouse is it's a long way to get anywhere, and to be honest it's kind of a depressing place, with the photos and the baby's room and whatnot.   I am on a 210-day game right now, just living out of the foyer of the dam. It's annoying to have to go downstairs to cook meat, but it's a good location for hunting and for traveling to other zones.  The Camp Office is pretty awesome, because it's near a trapping area and a fishing area, and the lake is good for hunting as well. That's probably the best base in the game, still."
thelongdark,3awbga,kingofeggsandwiches,3,Wed Jun 24 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"You say depressing, I say cosy haha! Maybe I have a claustrophobic tendency but the farmstead is just great for me with how far you can see on a clear day."
thelongdark,3awbga,kingofeggsandwiches,2,Wed Jun 24 02:49:46 2015 UTC,I've been on the farmstead for over 20 or 30 days probably.
thelongdark,3awbga,pedrothecoffeemaker,3,Wed Jun 24 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"I don't transport to be honest. In my  long games I basically just made a home at Mystery Lake Lodge, Pleasant Valley Farmstead or The house with in the Canadian Flag in Coastal Village. Whenever I move I tend to only take a bit over 30 kg with the intention of eating myself under en route. Common items just aren't worth the weight to move. I keep energy bars and salty crackers for moving since they're high calorie and low weight. Moving stuff like meat is a waste of time, so I make this the staple  of my diet leading up to any movements. I've returned to areas to find my fridge full of decayed meat which is depressing, I'm trying to rid myself of hordeing tendencies right now but it's hard to fight against the desire to protect against every possible bad spell of luck. One problem I find is moving furs, because if you're in crafted gear you'd need it to repair but it's a pain in the ass to take the extra weight of one of each type, usually I'll just take a rabbit pelt and my first job in a new area will be acquiring a wolf and couple of deer pelts. MREs are kinda heavy, I rarely take more than one, I find them a pain because I rarely let myself become hungry enough to eat them, although I think ultimately the calorie to weight ratio works out ok.  Really moving to a new zone is massive deal for me and kind of like starting over, I only do it when I'm truly bored of an area and I'm willing to risk death for a change of scenery. It's dangerous because firstly I've found I'm most likely to in the linking zones and secondly because when you arrive you've got to quickly start restocking everything and hunting.   Personally my favourite place is the farmstead. Good rabbit and deer hunting within spitting distance, wolves to the south and north who have never bothered me since it's a big open space so ganking is unlikely, even bears that occasionally stroll through that you can virtually shoot from the porch if you want to. Only thing I've found in short supply is maple saplings."

Growing up, we heated with a wood stove whenever possible. The amount of light put out by the stoves in-game is actually fairly accurate. You'd only be able to see what was a few feet in front of the stove for the most part. I agree that light could use some tweaking though. The fireplaces could probably stand to kick out a bit more light, and even with no fire, the darkness feels artificially thick at times. When it's a clear night and the moon is up, I feel like you should at least be able to navigate around the house using the glow from the windows. Someone mentioned candles made from animal fat in another thread, which I think would be a cool addition - just a long lasting light source crafted from renewable resources that can be placed like a lantern."

If the stove is around the corner, throwing light on the ground...i Should be able to see some glow...but I can't in the game. If I'm in the other room, it's pitch black.

So far I have seen them in 2 locations. 1) coastal highway. If you go from the abandoned mine and follow the trail left (watch out there's a wolf) the maple saplings will be on a hill near the lookout building. 2) the transition zone between mystery Lake and pleasant Valley. If you are coming from pleasant Valley there will be a hill on your right as soon as you can see the back of the hydro dam. Follow the hill all the way up the saplings will be up there  Message me if u need clarification. Sorry about formatting/spelling im on mobile.

They mind their own business, they scare away wolves (I've seen MathasGames get saved by this, when he got in a car, and got surrounded by 3 wolves until a bear came by and scared away all the wolves), and provide a massive amount of meat when killed. In fact this game made me interested in studying more about bears."

Once ruined, you harvest for reclaimed wood and then make a new one."

If you don't have a gun, have a flare handy while you're exploring. If wildlife approaches, light it, stare them down, and walk away from them while keeping them in view. If they attack, chuck a lit flare at their heads to ward them off.  Bunker down often, drink often, eat often, warm up often, and sleep often! Don't sleep outside, though. Repair your clothes with the cloth harvested from inferior clothes. Find a great homebase. The more safe houses, the better in my opinion."

Usually what I'll do in the early game when I don't have great clothes is, I'll step outside to maybe forage wood for an hour and then check how my temperature condition is handling. If it is increasing at a rate that seems sketchy, I'll just use that time to craft or do some other menial task inside to kill time and then check the weather again. Melt and boil more water? Sure! When exploring, make sure you aren't encumbered but that you've got enough water. Take a half gallon at least, but probably not more than a full gallon if you plan on no more than a day trip. Take 800-1000 calories of food if it's going to be a couple of days, possibly. But if you're full up on calories and you plan on coming home before dark, you shouldn't need much food. Always bring medicine! Bandage, Antiseptic and Pain Killers are your friend if you encounter a wolf or God forbid, a bear.   The only thing I'm sharing here that MIGHT be considered a spoiler is the following. spoiler  But above all, HAVE FUN! That's what these games are for! Killing time, enjoying and exploring!"
thelongdark,3apxm5,soupnrc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:38:18 2015 UTC,"So I know you can melt an unlimited amount of snow, but can you drop the excess water jugs?"
thelongdark,3apxm5,ParvaDilectus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can drop how ever many gallons of water that you want."
thelongdark,3apxm5,soupnrc,6,Tue Jun 23 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"Probably the most important thing is making water. The game doesn't really tell you, but, after you make a fire, if you interact with it there's three menus. One for keeping the fire going, one for cooking food and another for gathering and melting snow. Only after 3 or 4 deaths did I figure out any of this existed  Also, if your condition is low and you don't want to risk foraging outdoors. You can forage indoors for reclaimed wood, however, there's a limit."
thelongdark,3apxm5,Flashdancer405,3,Mon Jun 22 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about starvation; it's slow and your are nit likely to die from it. I bring this up because it is a good idea to scan and strafe as you move into new areas, take your time to check it out first (even if you are freezing); it's better to take a slow hit to your condition than to try to rush to shelter and get eaten by a wolf."
thelongdark,3apxm5,LawrencevanNiekerk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"It took me a while to notice this: If you played for an hour you've probably already figured it out but you can't actually chop down the trees, you use the forage wood option in the survival menu."
thelongdark,3apqls,sewiv,16,Mon Jun 22 14:36:38 2015 UTC,"The last several days the stranger spent creeping from the barn out to the homestead. While you were out trudging through the snow she was in your home, loading a worn hockey bag with your belongings.   Likely due to exhaustion you noticed your missing belonging but never the footsteps much smaller than your own leading to and from your base.    She thought she knew your movements perfectly. One day you came back unexpectedly.  Her heart raced as she felt her way around the basement hoping for another way out, fingers frantically searching through the dust and discarded cans and candy wrappers.  She found a discarded piece of Fir. Her arms shook as she pressed herself against the wall next to the door frame. She could hear you now much closer. Labored breathing, slow crunching of boots breaking through the frost layer above the snow. Dragging something large and heavy behind you.   Maybe it's meat. The strangers dried tongue licked across her shriveled frost bitten lips, a slight moan rattling past what was left of her long since brushed teeth. It had been weeks since she found a deer corpse.  You went down much easier than expected. The first swing knocked you unconscious before you even hit the cold wet floor.  She stood above you for several minutes. She had never killed anyone before. She leaned down and found your hatchet. No more being hungry. No more being cold. She would survive.  She brought the back of the hatchet blade down on your skull. Thwack. Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.   The strangers then spoke to herself, grinning in the dark, your blood painted on her face like scarlet feckless  ""I wonder what human tastes like"""

The achievement description says ""Harvest 25 of each kind of plant"", and harvesting a rose hip bush nets you 8 rose hips. So it's not about having 25 rose hips in your inventory, it's about harvesting 25 rose hip bushes, which would get you a total of 200 rose hips."

Frozen caracasses just take longer to harvest. So unless youre harvesting alot, theres no use foraging for wood, plus the fire is likely to burn out much faster than it indicates as soon a wind picks up."
thelongdark,3ajyn9,prestonn77,6,Sat Jun 20 23:26:53 2015 UTC,"I more or less agree. I've gotten into building a fire next to long harvesting jobs (bears or wolf+deer) so I don't freeze while I'm doing it. Today I did it with a bear and just randomly saw the frozen % went down.   Before you get a knife or hatchet, it seems super useful. Sometimes you get those right away, but not always."

thelongdark,3ajfm7,prestonn77,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:28:23 2015 UTC,"I think not being able to jump adds to the realism. Most video game characters can jump way better than real people can; if you IRL were climbing up a mountain carrying 20+ kgs of stuff, you probably wouldn't be able to jump over the kinds of ""tiny rocks"" that have been impeding you in-game."
thelongdark,3ajfm7,JosiahHenderson,8,Sat Jun 20 23:35:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that you don't need to be wall-running across impossible gaps and dazzling the wildlife with your survivalist parkour, but not being trapped on the wrong side of a waist-high snow drift or split rail fence would be cool. IRL you'd just toss over your pack and then hop over yourself. Maybe having the ability to take an extra big step up or scramble over smaller obstacles at the cost of burning more energy would be a good middle ground."
thelongdark,3ajfm7,apt_get,2,Sun Jun 21 03:49:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm not asking for anything big like wall-running and shit. IMO that would ruin the game entirely.

thelongdark,3agydb,GAMEg33k,2,Sat Jun 20 02:11:00 2015 UTC,"Great guide!  A note on dealing with wolves and bears - stay calm!  If they see you from a distance, keep them in sight and DON'T RUN.  If you turn and flee (and they've seen you), they will chase and probably catch you.  If one starts to approach you, use a flare (as you mentioned), a torch or get a fire down.  Back away slowly and keep the flame between you and your new ""friend"" until you can break line of sight or get some distance."
thelongdark,3agydb,DefinitelyN0tAtWork,2,Sat Jun 20 04:28:11 2015 UTC,"You said it.  As a new player LOVING this game, just wanted to add my .02 to dealing with wolves especially early in the game.  If you pull a wolf but don't have a weapon or flare, walk backwards and continue facing the wolf.  This will keep them at bay.    Of course, you'll need to spin around to look where you're going occasionally and if you're walking into another wolf, but if you do it quick enough you'll be ok.  I was able to do this multiple times until I could find shelter and never was attacked.  Also, if a wolf downs a deer give them as much room as you normally would.  I thought I could walk by one eating a deer closer than normal but he left the deer and charged me.  Surprised me so much I didn't get my rifle ready in time and had to fight it.  Barely survived."
thelongdark,3agydb,VectorVictorious,2,Sat Jun 20 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I caught a wolf with a fresh kill yesterday.

thelongdark,3agydb,Phib1618,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"If I'm holding a rifle and see this happen, I go in for the kill.

thelongdark,3agydb,apt_get,2,Sat Jun 20 09:30:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words! If you want to try the fire method, make sure you have a hatchet, cause it'll net you a larger time spent to fire lit ratio. Gathering 5 fir, takes about 1 hour and that will fuel a fire for about 9 hours I think.  It gives you a lot of time, to cook and melt water.   You can then just stockpile wood, since it's only 1 hour for 9 hours back. So every time you do it your gaining a net bonus of 8 hours.   I only really do this when I have a lot of food or I'm super low on starters, since I do like to try and build my fire making up so I don't need to rely on accelerants so much."
thelongdark,3agydb,ThePianistOfDoom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"If the weather is nice and I've got plenty of food, I'll usually make 4 or 5 runs for hardwood and then drop it inside by the stove.

Big mistake. I went out and looked around, collected a few items, went down to the river to check it out and then hiked back up. The door wouldn't open from that side, so I was locked out! I had unloaded my bedroll, knife, hatchet, food, and other important gear just inside the main entrance to the dam to free up room in my pack. All I had was what I'd collected from the lower section, since I'd already made 1 trip back to unload. There were only 4 hours of daylight left, so I decided to start down the river and see if I could find a path back up to the other side where my gear was. It started getting dark before I found anything, but I managed to find a small cave, gather some wood by hand, and build a fire to wait out the night. Blizzard all the next morning. By the time I set out again, I had burned through all my food, and my hunger was up in the yellow and fatigue in the orange. I continued further down the river and found a trail up the side and started following it. spoiler"
thelongdark,3ae2k5,kingofeggsandwiches,2,Fri Jun 19 16:29:40 2015 UTC,"I have a very similar tale. I'd been very busy looting all of Mystery Lake, one of my earlier play throughs when I was just start to grips with the game. I'd stocked up nicely at the Lodge, and I'd left the Dam for last on accounts of a few bad experiences there with fluffy (literally was killed by fluffy upon waking up on my first play through before I was aware indoor wildlife was a thing).   Of course I'd taken the bare minimum in loot with me to the dam knowing how big that place is I would surely be encumbered by leaving even carrying a bare survival kit. I looted the entire dam as quickly as possible, trying not to leave anything behind, had 40kg+ at this point, my plan being to drop the non-essentials at the door and get nip back for them later.   Well I thought I'd try that infamous door, thinking it might be a another indoor section. Well fuck my life I was shocked to see the outdoors, I looked around for a few bits and bobs in the vicinity, disappointed I went to return and well fuck me, no entrance. Panic set in bad at this point. The weather was good and there was still a far bit of daylight left but I had no clue what to do. I hadn't taken my gun or my bedroll.   So my only plan was to drop everything inessential on the floor right there to go onward  as fast as possible in search of a bed before fatigue got me. I just powered forward in that area, taking no time to explore really, just hoping I'd find some sign of civilisation, looted a few corpses on the way and was lucky enough to find enough food and soda to keep me going. Where did I end up but PV. A map I had no sense of whatsoever, arriving in dusk, with just endless wilderness ahead of me, no idea where to go. I just picked a direction and kept going. My guardian angel was looking out for me that night though. The weather was on my side. I still had a while till my fatigue ran out. I even had a cup of cold coffee in my bag.   I burned through all my lantern fuel. When it was gone I started just lighting flares one after another (I had 3 fortunately). Finally I find a road and follow it and end up near a wooden arch. A little later I'd found the barn, just as I was freezing to death on about 60% condition. The barn was a saviour, but I soon realised there was still nowhere to sleep, I looted the place, lit a fire and made coffee, ate, but my fatigue was about to hit 100%, there were still 2 hours until daylight. I had to run from the place, I figured I'd follow the hay bales, surely there must be more civilisation near a barn.  Well I can't find anything. I've even got disorientated and I'm losing condition, pretty much resigned myself to the end, when what would you know? The first light of the morning is peaking on the horizon, my visibility is improving, and across the way I see what looks like a building. I run towards it and there it is, the farmstead, not some puny hut (a puny hut would've been good enough for me), but a real building. I just run in there and jump into the first bed I see, condition 21%. Probably my luckiest night in the game so far, no idea how I survived, sometimes the odds are in your favour, sometimes they're not."

It sounds like when you got to PV you took a right at the fork and went down the mountain, while I went left and climbed higher and ended up at the cell phone tower. I wasn't as desperate for sleep since I'd found a bedroll in that cave, but I was pretty well frozen to death, so finding sturdy shelter containing some better clothes and a means to repair the ones I had on was a lifesaver. Seeing that tower appear out of the blizzard was such a huge relief. Also found another rifle to replace the one left back at the dam. I eventually made my way back there and am hanging out at the ML camp office waiting for my hides to cure so I can make the last of my animal skin gear."

I had built up an impressive inventory of goods  - cured hides, a bearskin bed roll, tools, food, everything. One day I go out and return to find that the house has reset as if it were my first time entering - all my items are gone, all containers reset, and fresh loot has spawned.  Needless to say, I was kind of upset, but I had already reached my goal of fifty days and was planning to move on soon anyway. I figured the house reset because more than fifty days had passed or it was just a bug or something (this is alpha after all).   I try to shrug off the devasting loss of almost all of my items (I didn't even have a bed roll at this point) and venture out to an unexplored area expecting not to last much longer. My journey led me back to the house, however, and when I went inside I found all my items had returned! Everything was just how I left it!  I have since discovered that the door next to the refrigerator leads to a fresh instance of the house while the other two doors lead to the instance of the house that contains all of my items. Weird stuff.  TL:DR - Returned home to find all my items gone. Turns out this only happens when I enter from one specific door (next to the fridge)."

And it's not like there's really anywhere to run to other than back outside or the backside of the dam if you can squeeze past, because he's still in there with you unless you kill him. It's possible to kill him with melee, but just like any wolf, Fluffy is very often a run-ender for a lot of people.  Apparently he only has a 50-50 chance of spawning on your first visit, but I usually just clear out the whole dam the first time I'm in there if I can help it, to avoid any subsequent spawns."
thelongdark,3ac32h,oliveeya,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:10:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that the wolf doesn't spawn right away actually lead to the greatest moment I have had in the game. I'm playing the game on xbox, and as of that playthrough I had not read anything about the game,  wiki or otherwise.    what happened was on a previous playthrough I happen to spawn in the dam.  I immidiatley began exploring and stockpiling.  I then proceeded to go out a door and get locked out and die of exposure.  Oh well.    Several playthroughs later (and the first playthrough that I have found a rifle) I come back across the dam. Thinking to myself, ""this will be a great place to set up a base camp"", I head in and proceed to unload my bag into a locker near the control room. I head out collect a few more things and store them as well.   I set out a bedroll and get some sleep.  Now,  it's pretty dark in the dam but I wanted to save fuel so I really wasn't burning the lantern too much. However as I was gearing up to head out again I wanted to do one last sweep of the room I was in so I start to ignite the lantern.  This is when I died. Well almost.   As I'm igniting the lantern I hear a distinct growl I whip around about 1 second before the wolf is on me.  I fight him off and immidiatley bandage myself up and take any meds I have on me. (Remember I haven't read anything in terms of health mechanics so I didn't know what it would take to not die of my post battle injuries.)   Having recovered slightly I realize that I have too much stuff to haul out in one go and I don't want to risk multiple trips so my only recourse is too finish off the wolf. I knew that wolves could be scared off by flares so I grab the two that i have and set off into the halls.  I don't have to go far when i hear the growl.  He is in a stairwell and the flare is illuminating only his muzzle and eyes (BTW I love love love the lighting mechanics) I throw down the flair and pull out the rifle.  I site up, pull the trigger and click. I forgot to load the gun.  The next several seconds are excruciating.  I load the rifle,  all while this wolf is standing on the edge of darkness growling at me. I finally get the gun primed and with one shot right to the head I put him down.   Needless to say I abandoned the base shortly after and spent some tense trips going in and our of the dam trying to haul out all my loot and not knowing if any other wolves might spawn.

I start harvesting the 6kg or so of meat. Then I die.  Starting to get the hang of it. I find an ice fishing hole. I start to break the ice. Then I die.  Finally understand calorie mechanics and go back to the ice hole with a hook and line. Once again, I break the ice. Then I learn about tackles.  I find my first gun. Already have 6 rounds. Wander into the dam, fluffy comes out of nowhere. Then I die.  I get lucky and find a rifle close to my spawn. Find some ammo. I really want to kill a wolf, so I aggro one. He starts charging, I aim down sight, aaaaaand click. Then I die.  These are some highlights of many play throughs. Whatever."

The next couple of play through s play out similarly.  Start another game. Spawn next to the rifle. Fucking sweet! Make it to day two. Also fucking sweet. I see a wolf and decide I'm going to fuck it up. Didn't put down a flare to stop wolf from advancing and didn't realize how hard it is to aim the rifle. Get fucked up by wolf.  Start another play through and on day five decide to go to the dam to fuck up Fluffy. Have epic battle with fluffy ending at my being 21% and Fluffy dead at my feet. I go to heal only to realize that I harvested my bed roll for cloth. Die from my wounds the next day.  Start up another one. Things are going well. Well supplied and on 4th day go to dam for Dmillz vs Fluffy 2: Electric Buggaloo. Win the fight with 40%. Still have my bed roll and live. I make it to pleasant valley. Sweet. When I enter the valley it is foggy. Not so sweet.   By a stroke of luck I find the farm house. Get well supplied with food and awesome clothing (Premium Jacket and Cargo pants!) Next two days is a blizzard so I stay put. I go to leave the next day only to see a bear frontin on me. Stay inside for another day. I go to leave again and bear is gone so I go to signal tower and almost get lost in the fog.  I raid the tower and just when i am about to leave I notice a gun on top of the bed. Almost completely left it behind. I am know stoked! I leave the tower and get mauled by a bear. Almost died (shot bear twice). Recover at tower for 2 days. Find the bear dead outside and skin and harvest meat.  Now it is day 12 in my game and I have a bear pelt plus 2 deer and wolf pelts and I'm rolling in bear meat. I expect to be killed by a wolf tomorrow.  10/10 will survive again.

thelongdark,3aaibt,oliveeya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"Wrote this in a different post but thought I'd share it here  The fact that the wolf doesn't spawn right away actually lead to the greatest moment I have had in the game. I'm playing the game on xbox, and as of that playthrough I had not read anything about the game, wiki or otherwise.   what happened was on a previous playthrough I happen to spawn in the dam. I immidiatley began exploring and stockpiling. I then proceeded to go out a door and get locked out and die of exposure. Oh well.   Several playthroughs later (and the first playthrough that I have found a rifle) I come back across the dam. Thinking to myself, ""this will be a great place to set up a base camp"", I head in and proceed to unload my bag into a locker near the control room. I head out collect a few more things and store them as well. I set out a bedroll and get some sleep. Now, it's pretty dark in the dam but I wanted to save fuel so I really wasn't burning the lantern too much. However as I was gearing up to head out again I wanted to do one last sweep of the room I was in so I start to ignite the lantern. This is when I died. Well almost.   As I'm igniting the lantern I hear a distinct growl I whip around about 1 second before the wolf is on me. I fight him off and immidiatley bandage myself up and take any meds I have on me. (Remember I haven't read anything in terms of health mechanics so I didn't know what it would take to not die of my post battle injuries.)   Having recovered slightly I realize that I have too much stuff to haul out in one go and I don't want to risk multiple trips so my only recourse is too finish off the wolf. I knew that wolves could be scared off by flares so I grab the two that i have and set off into the halls. I don't have to go far when i hear the growl. He is in a stairwell and the flare is illuminating only his muzzle and eyes (BTW I love love love the lighting mechanics) I throw down the flair and pull out the rifle. I site up, pull the trigger and click. I forgot to load the gun.  The next several seconds are excruciating. I load the rifle, all while this wolf is standing on the edge of darkness growling at me. I finally get the gun primed and with one shot right to the head I put him down.   Needless to say I abandoned the base shortly after and spent some tense trips going in and our of the dam trying to haul out all my loot and not knowing if any other wolves might spawn.  I love this game."

thelongdark,3a8f3b,Kraelman,6,Thu Jun 18 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"I find that in my games, playing with a rifle is marginally more dangerous than playing without. When I'm armed I start to get cocky and take bad risks. Twice that's put me on the business end of an angry bear, and other times I find that I'm spending significant time and effort (and inventory space) keeping and maintaining the gun.  My longest play session was about 32 days, and I did it without ever finding the rifle. It forced me to pay more attention and think a little harder about how to carry on.  I'm glad you finally got to take one down, though :D"
thelongdark,3a8f3b,NotAForestHunter,2,Thu Jun 18 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"I just found the rifle today too on, of all places, the back seat of an abandoned car - delighted! I'd searched high and low for a rifle, started putting together everything I'd need to make a bow instead, deadly aware that though I'd survived 7 days at this point, I'd likely not see out the month with what I had stocked unless I could find a replenishable source of food.  It was day ten that I was someways South of the home I'd claimed, searching for birch and maple with which to create a bow, and there was the rifle! I got into the car and collected it before the wind picked up. I tried to rest out the wind but the cold set in too fast - I had to move. There was a small cabin not too far back and I ran for it; I'd spend the night there - enough food and drink to last me a couple of days if needs be.  My home was only two hours back up the road, and the skies were clear come morning. I set out, but didn't make it far before hearing that all-too-familiar growl. I looked around but couldn't see it; it was making quick towards me, so I bolted for the next house. Though I didn't see it, it must only have been a foot or so from me when I made it to the door, but I was safe.  I rested a couple of hours to be sure the wolf had moved on. By that point, the wind had picked up again but I wanted to make my way home - I had enough food, but water was scarce and I'd already used what firewood I'd found.  It was cold and there was no visibility, but I made it back safe - so pleased to be home; I love the little house I've chosen for myself. I finally felt safe again; tomorrow, while my birch saplings were curing, I would attempt to hunt.  And so I did. There was slow pacing nearby, so I made my way up to the top of a snow mound, knowing that a wolf prowled at the other side. I looked for it, but saw nothing. I shuffled closer to the precipice but could still see nothing. I checked to my left: nothing. And to my right: a wolf! It had made its way up the snow mound and was just six feet from me, far too close for comfort; home was just a short sprint away if I chose to flee - sensible, given the time it would take to line up a shot.  But my fight or flight response didn't have time to make this decision before the wolf clocked me and pounced. I let off a shot. It missed, but I swear it must have grazed its tail. In a heartbeat I was pinned down, fighting off the wolf, and it was taking more of a beating than I'd become accustomed to. Barely, I survived, with the threat of impending blood loss, and the wolf scarpered.  I was well stocked for supplies back at the house, and had even remembered to bring bandages and antiseptic with me today. But this was for nought. Only a second later, I was dead - bled out into the snow. 10 days, 11 hours, a home of my own, and a sense of security that I could survive many months this way... all lost in a matter of seconds.  I love this game! That rifle might be more trouble than its worth though, if it's convincing us we're ready to go wolf-hunting. But that aside, I think I'm ready for the hardest difficulty setting. 10 days is an awesome improvement over my previous record of just 2."

It took me 3 or 4 tries to find a rifle, which I found on a dead guy in the middle of nowhere of all places. Not long after finding the rifle and a few rounds, I found a bear. I crept up as close as I could and shot him. Bad idea. Apparently even on easy animals take exception to being shot. I managed to shoot him once more as he charged, but still got mauled and left at about 6% near the Trapper's Cabin. Once I got over the surprise of not being dead, I turned and saw the bear slowly walking away. I had one more round left so I figured, ""what the hell,"" and shot him from behind like a little bitch, and he dropped. Not my proudest moment, but I learned a lesson. I'll definitely try to attack from above next time or at least from a greater distance."

It ran at me, I got two more shots off before he was on top of me chewing my brains out. When I came to, I, like you, shot him in the back like a little bitch. You know, for good measure. It took a total of 4 shots to kill him. 0/10 would not even start a fight with a bear at 200 yards away."

Oh and you probably use the sprint(faster tempo running I think) like everyone else, that probably increases the calorie outtake too. Also meats are low in calories from other stuff if they are same in weight.  Still... Eating very little for a while shouldn't kill you in a day or two(like in the game)"

thelongdark,3a7zfe,ShortchangeParamecia,3,Thu Jun 18 00:45:51 2015 UTC,I haven't played in a few updates but I thought you could go a few days without eating.

thelongdark,3a7zfe,Grimsonite,2,Thu Jun 18 00:35:15 2015 UTC,"I can see that I guess. Maybe what bothers me so much isn't the number of calories I need to consume, but the amount of weight I need to carry to stay fueled. I know venison in particular is pretty lean, but it still seems like it should pack a few more calories than it does. It's all part of keeping the game balanced, which I am fine with. It just seems odd that after snagging a few dozen pounds of meat I should be frantically searching for food only days later."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Have you ever eaten no carb? The amount of calories in meat is very low. If you're doing no carb in an effort to cut weight the sheer amount of meet you need to eat on a daily basis just to stay full starts to get pretty gross. And this is just from sitting on my ass doing nothing while going to the gym, not living in northern canada trying to survive and trudging through snow.   The vast majority of your calories are from carbs."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,CatalystNZ,5,Mon Jun 22 14:41:35 2015 UTC,"Here's the secret... don't eat as much.  Hear me out, let your calories get to zero... starve for a while and then eat. Just as you would in real life. It's called rationing, and it works in the game. Your condition doesn't start dropping for a little while after you reach zero calories, so if you really wanted to, you could take a little nibble of food periodically (start eating and hit Escape) and not lose your condition.  What I typically do, is try to end the day on around 80% condition... then I ramp up the calories to around 400 or so and sleep for a while... it brings you back to 100% and repeat the process.  These days I sometimes go on long treks with not much more than a couple of kg of meat... that can last me a few days."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,crispyshark,7,Thu Jun 18 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for this.  For some reason I thought I'd die if my calories reached zero so I'm always scarfing down half a deer to keep the number up.  I'll have to try out the rationing method."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,Johnny-Lingo,2,Thu Jun 18 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer.  You're trying to survive not get fat.  I try not to starve too long while traveling, lose a lot to fatigue.  But if I'm in the cabin crafting or scavenging close to my base I'll starve for a long time and eat right before bed."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,Smooth_McDouglette,4,Thu Jun 18 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating how much an active hardworking fully grown man can eat.  I work with computers all day, then I come home and sit in front of the computer most evenings. I think it's reasonably fair to assume most people in this subreddit have similar lifestyles. I eat pithy tiny meals compared to most people I know.  My brother on the other hand is a really active guy, and his job is really labor intensive, like physical labor. He can literally eat 3 times as much food as me per meal. It's incredible that he isn't a fatass but it's all about calories in calories out.  I would imagine spending upwards of 20 hours a day roaming around in the freezing cold, chopping down trees, hunting and scavenging will make you a very hungry man.  It doesn't seem outrageously unrealistic really."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,Smooth_McDouglette,3,Thu Jun 18 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"No, I get it, and you're absolutely right. I'm sure given a survivalist lifestyle in the frozen wilderness, you'd consume a lot more calories on a daily basis than you or I currently do. I guess my point is that this is what a 2lb cut of meat looks like. I don't care how active you are, you probably aren't downing 2-3 of these every day. As others have mentioned though, it's for the sake of balance. The way I see it, it's a choice between nerfing the calories obtained from meat so that you consume it faster, making it take longer to gather/cook, making it spoil faster so that you have to hunt more often, or making big game more scarce. I totally agree that the challenge would leave the game pretty quickly if you could easily stockpile several weeks worth of food. In the future it might be cool to have the ability to cure meat or make jerky or something to aid in longer games. The trade-off there would be the significant time needed for preparation, so there'd be no stockpiling a month's worth of food in a couple days."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,MalarkeyTFC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:35:43 2015 UTC,"Lol true, especially when you are at full hunger and proceed to eat 4 pounds of meat that just almost fills you up."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,kaisentlaia,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:38:05 2015 UTC,I eat about 1.5-2lbs of meat a day depending on how seriously I'm taking the gym at that point in time. I can easily see myself eating 6lbs of meat a day if ALL I have to eat is meat and there are literally no carbs available at all (I would however feel extremely sorry for my asshole...).  The issue here is not 'how active' you are. The issue is you are trying to survive and do not have the ability to eat a balanced meal. I guarantee you eating 6lbs of venison every day will get so disgusting so quick that you'll most likely want to starve yourself calorically speaking however it is not nearly as unrealistic as you think it is.
thelongdark,3a7zfe,MalarkeyTFC,4,Mon Jun 22 14:48:12 2015 UTC,"A guy made a photography book about average meals around the world. This carver from Canada usually eats 4700 calories in a day, he probably lives in a heated house and doesn't run around in deep snow with 30kgs of gear every day. Considering this the calories consumption in the game could even be a little on the low side.  What's not realistic is the calories/weight ratio, especially for meat... but that exists for balance reasons. If you could harvest all the meat from a deer, let's say it weights 80kgs, you would get something like 25kgs of boneless meat. At 1200 calories/kg (more or less) just one kill would keep you going for many days. Let's not even mention bears. The game would be pretty dull IMO, for me it already does whenever I kill and harvest a bear and then I don't have to worry about food for a long time."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,mutokangius,2,Thu Jun 18 08:31:40 2015 UTC,"People seriously underestimate how much food an active person needs to eat. I remember people freaking out a while back when they found out how much Michael Phelps ate saying things like ""how does he eat so much and not get fat!""."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,SurSpence,2,Mon Jun 22 14:51:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's a survival video game. It would be kind of boring if it took you three weeks to starve to death, even in subjective game time. I do agree about the weight thing in terms of game balance, it does feel a little intense knowing that I have to give about a third of my pack weight to food at all times. But micromanaging your inventory is like a third of this game.  I feel like the easy difficulty is reasonably realistic for what the game is. Although I've survived for long periods on the harder difficulties, I really enjoy playing on the easiest mode, it's a different, more relaxing kind of game and it's more realistic in that it takes longer to starve and animals don't constantly attack you."
thelongdark,3a7zfe,waveshaper,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:26:56 2015 UTC,"I find the easy mode pretty relaxing too, and I agree that it would be too easy if a single kill meant not having to worry about food for 2 weeks.

I mean, think about it, you can't eat 3 kg of meat in one sitting.  Period.  I couldn't do that in 1 day, and I'm a big fat guy.  In this game, you certainly can, easily.  Even more if it's rabbit.  Rabbit, you could eat almost 6 kg before filling up your 2500 calories.  That's 13 pounds of rabbit.  I just about can guarantee a human that can walk can't eat 13 pounds of rabbit in one sitting.  It's all just game balance.  I run around starving most of the time anyway.  It won't kill you (well, not as a surprise, anyway).  It's only 1%/hour."

thelongdark,3a7ayc,eatingbears,3,Wed Jun 17 20:05:12 2015 UTC,"Nicely done!       There are three major regions (which I'm sure you've seen listed in the menu), as well as unique transition regions between each. In total, I believe you have over 22 square kilometers to explore, so you still have quite a bit to discover!       As a side-note to new players: You may only access Coastal Highway and Pleasant Valley from the main menu once you've discovered them organically in-game."
thelongdark,3a7ayc,bethanyhinterland,2,Wed Jun 17 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"Game 3, day 3: Woke up in the dam facility, left my bedroll on the ground next to the fire barrel, because why not? Spent the morning scavenging the facility clean. Early afternoon, spoiler Wandered down to the frozen river, figuring there must be some way to get back into the damspoiler. While taking a break to warm up by a fire, I am mauled by a wolf. Spend the rest of the day exploring every inch of the dam wall and the frozen river, except the cave, because, I just got mauled by a wolf, and wolves maybe live in caves, right? I am fatigued; then exhausted; but without a bedroll, I can't sleep to recover my strength. Encumbered and dying of exhaustion, I slog back to the dam, and try one last time to get in through the door, but (obviously) it is still locked. I realise the cave is my only chance... I make it there at 3% Condition, moving painfully slow. At 2% Condition, I find spoiler Huzzah! I am saved!   Now on day 7, chilling out in the Pleasant Valley farmhouse and dining on roasted bear and toilet water."

After you exit the door to Carter River, turn left and traverse the narrow ledge to the other side of the dam.  Climb the snow bank next to the stairs and one of the broken windows will allow you to click and get back in.  I had just survived an attack and was freezing with 18% remaining health when I found it.  Talk about stress relief."

thelongdark,3a7ayc,GrandviewOhio,5,Wed Jun 17 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Or don't do that.  The point of the game is to explore and survive.  Looking at an online map to find everything isn't really ""exploring""."
thelongdark,3a7ayc,Kraelman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"I was like that when i first started playing, but after doing several playthroughs its ok to use one.

thelongdark,3a7ayc,prestonn77,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"There are several more maps! I just found out by stumbling through the cave and voila! Pleasant Valley was ripe for my picking. Also, I found another map entrance through an abandoned mine (in Pleasant Valley) called Coastal Highway. So far, it is really rocky and seems too linear. Hopefully it will get better. Any seasoned players care to give your opinion on favorite map?"
thelongdark,3a7ayc,GrandviewOhio,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Ive had several playthroughs nearing the year mark, ive found pleasant valley is the best map to start out in. The mountains and large hills are only on the edges of the map, your homestead is right in the center. You can see wolves and other threats from very far making it easy to hunt, there are rabbit spawns on either side of the homefront as well, you can find a rabbit deer or wolf right after walking out your front door+the guarded porch for when the bear wanders close, easy bear kills.  The radio tower is right next to the homestead and almost always has good clothes and a rifle. Its easy to get a start here, get your fur clothes and tools, then move on. After you finish pleasant valley its best to move to mystery lake and set up in trappers homestead."
thelongdark,3a8ssy,aboutblank,5,Thu Jun 18 03:20:42 2015 UTC,"First, I fucking love this game...*  Could some animation be involved? Even the ridiculous far cry ""attacked by an [enemy], cut bullet from arm"" thing was nonsense, but it wasn't a progress bar xD  Though I don't know how to improve it, I'm used to a wolf QT.  Though--hanging out in my cabin, crafting, building fires, sleeping next to the dead guy upstairs:   even the same camera pullout from the bed, showing my ass asleep, shivering, with the dead guy near the stairs...  an animation showing me trying to light a fire...smash in some kindling...maybe change it when my skill increases, gently places tinder, arranges log(s)  much more enjoyable loading/progress event than ""the bar""   Edit: Foraging doesn't even have a progress bar  *It took many hours for this game to fucking ""click"" for me (first ~50 hours I took everything I had everywhere, afraid I'd lose out on a single bite of energy bar. I am/was an idiot)"
thelongdark,3a8ssy,prestonn77,2,Thu Jun 18 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Early on its ok to hang onto all your packaged food before you set up camp. Honestly its better to leave behind tools you wont immediately need, rather than food. Bedroll/food/hatchet/matches are the most important things to have on you at all times. And packaged food is really light, especially energy bars. Pork and beans cans are pretty heavy though. So eat those first (:  Unless youre hunting already, then the packaged food is better left untouched until you need it.  I agree though, animations would be nice, better than watching a bar."
thelongdark,3a8ssy,omgpplrsoweirdpls,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"i agree. the progress bar is ok, especially for some things, but it would be cool to have something to at least look at while it's doing stuff.  Foraging wood could even be changed so that you have to physically go hit trees with a hatchet, or find fallen trees to harvest wood from.  also i feel like things such as boiling water and cooking should be able to be left there to cook while you can do other stuff, then come back later to get your cooked food or water or w/e.  obviously you don't want to start cooking and then walk away for hours, but if i could start food cooking, then start some water boiling, pick up a few logs, then go back to my food that is now cooked would be pretty cool.  just sitting there while an hour or two ticks down and you do nothing feels sort of odd.  this game is so awesome, and little things like this could add a lot of immersion.  all that being said, the current progress bar system actually works with the game pretty well and keeps things simple so i have kind of mixed feelings about it.  definitely at least something to watch/look at during would be cool though."
thelongdark,3a6ehw,prestonn77,16,Wed Jun 17 16:17:08 2015 UTC,"so you were less that 10% health, with hypothermia and expected a fire outside in the winter would warm you up enough and quickly enough? what was the air temp? -20? -10? wind protection won't do much if it's a cold day  Sorry, this game is unique in the fact that it doesn't kill you suddenly, your risky actions kills you. :)"
thelongdark,3a6ehw,Acr0phobic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"First off the first sentence says i went into a cave.  Not a regular cave, the habitable one next to the campgrounds in pleasant valley. Secondly the air temp was not even negative, i was just cold, and not heating up fast enough with just my clothes and no  fire."

thelongdark,3a6ehw,GrandviewOhio,7,Thu Jun 18 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"The fire raises the air temp by a certain amount (20C?).  If it's further negative than that amount, it stays negative, so if it's -25C, one fire will bring it up to -5C, and you could still be freezing. Build another fire, or heat food right away and eat it.  That immediately removes the freezing condition.  Coffee or tea will do the same."
thelongdark,3a6ehw,GrandviewOhio,2,Wed Jun 17 16:55:30 2015 UTC,I am currently going into my 5th day. I can't imagine what you do with all that time! Do you typically just hunt once you get to a certain point? I bet you have cleaned out every food item in the game and are living off animal meat. Does loot respawn?
thelongdark,3a6ehw,PM_ME_MY_FATE,2,Wed Jun 17 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"I start in pleasant valley, Ill keep resetting my spawn until i spawn with a heavy wool sweater, then go t the radio tower and almost always find some good clothes+ a rifle. Then focus on making a round across the map looting everything, live off the scavenged packaged food during the trip. At the end ill have most of the tools i need, then stay in pleasant valley until i have all my fur clothing since its so much warmer. Get the bow, then move on to Mystery lake and set up in trappers homestead. Then store everything i dnot need in the homestead, make a trip to coastal highway, spend a week or two there doing the same thing i did in pleasant valley, then make as many trips as i need to bring everything back to the trappers homestead. Then yea, i hunt. At this point the game just becomes a cycle of hunting, sleeping, cooking the food, sleeping, and eating it till it runs low, then hunting again. Cant hunt all the time cause the meat degrades and gives you more chance of getting sick. No loot doesnt respawn as far as i know, although i dont search places twice that i can remember."

If you want to use the lantern fuel first, drop the kerosene you don't want to use before you refill, then pick it up afterwards.    Right now, it uses the lowest quality % first.   Edit:  Just realized how to combine lantern fuel into the jerry can.  Drop the jerry can, refuel a lantern you're going to harvest from the lantern fuel containers, then pick up the jerry can and harvest the lantern."

thelongdark,3a2x9f,procrastinatorgrrl,5,Wed Jun 17 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"You can craft bandages from cloth. Also, I'm sure it's been mentioned before somewhere, but the geomagnetic storm which is the basis of the game would render compasses useless. And being able to plant seeds and saplings wouldn't make sense, given that it's a completely frozen wasteland, y'know? I think Hinterland gave that as the reason why mushrooms etc don't regrow.  I totally agree with being able to scavenge scrap metal from cars, and I still don't understand why we can't scavenge cloth from inside buildings. I mean, hello, the rugs are literally the same texture? You could scavenge from beds too if you're not going to be living there but have it then reduce the warmth bonus of that bed. Also sleds and being able to catch and breed rabbits would add so much to this game."
thelongdark,3a2x9f,Fugglor,4,Tue Jun 16 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, i totally didnt even think about compasses not working anymore, that makes sense. I didnt know you could craft bandages from cloth, i never looked much up about it, thats my fault.   Although it wouldnt be hard to grow saplings in a realistic setting, if all they need is fertile soil and sun. Fertilizer is easily made, and there is soil beneath that snow, paricularly by the rivers, which arent completely frozen, theres still minerals being brought downstream, that deposit in the shore over time making fertile soil. Then just animal manure, or whatever you want to make fertilizer. Sun would be hard to come by, but not impossible. I dont know maybe its asking too much. What do you do though when youre late game and ran out of birch. All your arrows have broken and theres nothing to make shafts with anymore, youve long since ran out rifle rounds... Maybe they will find other ways around this."
thelongdark,3a2x9f,kaisentlaia,3,Tue Jun 16 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"I assume when they add seasons in, plants will begin to regrow during the spring and summer"
thelongdark,3a2x9f,mutokangius,2,Wed Jun 17 22:31:44 2015 UTC,"Plants to grow need nutrients, light, water and... warmth. There isn't much around in TLD, and for sure seeds wouldn't germinate and grow in the frozen soil outside. Maybe it could be possible to grow something inside in pots near a window, keeping a permafire running, but mushrooms and lichens are awfully slow growers and saplings usually take years to reach that size. Maybe a rose hip would be able to grow and yield fruit in less than a year, but only with the right conditions.  So yeah, they could add it but it would be a big stretch IMO."
thelongdark,3a2x9f,Zeldon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:59:02 2015 UTC,"For an extremely realistic setting, what people actually did historically to create bows and arrows (and firewood) longterm was called coppicing"

Definitely looks weird when next to the deer since the deer skin hasn't changed at all.  Makes me wonder if they are going to update the appearance of all the animals in the future to bring them more in line with the new wolf appearance.    I'll say this though: the new skins look scarier than the old ones when one of them is staring at you from the other side of a campfire..."

Since we launched The Long Dark through Steam's Early Access program in September of last year, we've rolled out over 50 hotfixes and updates, the most recent of which was yesterday!       We have no plans to stop updates. In fact, we intend to keep updating and polishing the game while we continue working on story mode."

thelongdark,39y078,RaphLife,2,Wed Jun 17 02:21:05 2015 UTC,The game is still early access on PC and they are already bringing it to another platform?

It allows XBox One players to join the PC community in helping to develop early access titles. It should allow us the opportunity to get feedback from XBox players before our full release, which will also certainly be more stable as a result of this program. Very excited to be a part of it!"

thelongdark,39y078,MaddaCheeb101,3,Tue Jun 16 05:41:24 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty easy to port from windows to Xbox... maybe that's why.. bigger audience for little work.

thelongdark,39y078,Omegaus492,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:39:52 2015 UTC,"Why do you feel this is questionable? The way our development works is now that we've ported the game to Xbox One, all updates are done in both versions simultaneously, and since the UI and controls are the same on both platforms, the game is essentially the same and effort put into the PC version goes into the Xbox One version as well. Everyone wins!"
thelongdark,39y078,Krulz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:43:43 2015 UTC,Do you understand anything about how the current architecture of this gen of consoles? They are basically standardized PCs. It takes an incredibly minimal amount of effort for them to maintain both versions.  They aren't developing for two platforms simultaneously. They are developing for ONE platform and then porting over the changes to the other platform. That tiny bit of extra work is opening up an entirely different funding source for them and thus in turn increasing their ability to develop for the PC version you bought.  If you think this was a bad idea then I frankly don't know what to say to you.
thelongdark,39y078,Krulz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:20:32 2015 UTC,"As a Xbox player (I know I'm Not welcome here) they got a extra 20 bucks from me they would have never got by not porting to the Xbox! Since I understand that the Xbox is just a pc that has a more standard base and that this game is capable to hit that base perfectly fine and still keep their vision. (Which seems great and epic) so it's in their best interest to get people like me to join the club, so they can develop better and faster with more funding. Man with the master race being so great they sure get upset when others try and play with them. I mean shouldn't the people at the top be willing to include the people with less? Ha"

Controller Support  Simply plug a controller in and the game will automatically detect and update the user interface accordingly.   Keep in mind that we've tested a limited number of controllers so there may be bugs. If you encounter any issues, please post in the forums so we can help you.   THE LONG DARK SANDBOX ALPHA UPDATED TO v.243 CHANGELIST   The game now supports full Controller play.  Widespread environment art fixes to address popping and performance.  Fixed issue with some cabins disappearing.  Fixed terrain shadows popping in.  Fixed issue with curing sometimes getting reset when in-progress curing items were picked up.  Fixed voice sometimes being incorrect gender after loading a savegame.  Fixed issue with bedrolls not being repairable.  Fixed bug that could audio to be attached to wildlife corpses and would persist.  Fixed problem with pill bottles only having 1 pill in starting inventory.  Fixed issue with not being able to harvest a carcass after cancelling upon the harvesting action. Fixed issue that caused Bow to not degrade when used. The bow now degrades on use as designed.  Improved object pickup radius to make small items easier to interact with.  Removed daily decay rates from harvested saplings.    END OF CHANGELIST"

thelongdark,39yf9q,alottanadda,5,Mon Jun 15 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's because you have a controller, and if the game detects one, it automatically assumes it's a gamepad and that you want to use it. It's only supposed to do that if it detects it in use, but some controllers (like wheels or, in my case, rudders) often trigger it immediately, and there's no way to stop it once it happens. The only way to avoid it is to unplug the controller and restart the game. It's annoying when you have to regularly plug/unplug hardware on switching games.  It would be much nicer if there was an option to disable the automatic detection and use of controllers, rather than automatically assuming that every single controller is a gamepad. I really don't like the idea of having to unplug three peripherals any time I want to play certain games."
thelongdark,39yf9q,Phoenix_Dragon69,2,Tue Jun 16 17:33:55 2015 UTC,I had the same problem.  I unplugged my steering wheel and rebooted the game.  That fixed it.  So check what other controllers you have installed.  Hope that helps.

thelongdark,39osur,prestonn77,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:07:01 2015 UTC,Agro the bear; get him to walk toward you; aim just above the head; pop with him one arrow; step back behind the screen door; wait. Shooting the bear more than once seems to make it harder to find your arrows again.  It is absolutely possible to kill the bear with one shot. In my experience the bow has almost the same power as the rifle (it's just a lot easier to get an accurate shot with the rifle).  I don't like to shoot the bear twice (even with the rifle) because sometimes they run and you don't need to be carrying that much meat back home with you.  It can be frustrating but you start to get a feel for the bow and it's just a matter of patiently waiting for the bear to bleed out; if he starts walking away you can step back out and he will turn around and walk back toward you; sometimes you can get him to die right next to the screen door.
thelongdark,39osur,LawrencevanNiekerk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly dont understand how the game ""screwed you over"" YOu didnt manage to kill a bear, the toughest opponent in the game, with the bow. You hit him in the leg, obviously thats not a damaging shot. Ive headshot a bear with a rifle 3 times and not killed it, youre using a bow its gonna be difficult. Its not the games fault. Also, if you lose the bear, its also your fault+just being unlucky. Its a simulation, things dont work out all the time in real life either. Part of the game is taking those risks when you feel theyre necessary, if you wasted calories trying to hunt a bear when you could have just gotten a rabbit or a deer then....yea thats a pART of the game."

Im gonna play around with it too cause its kinda second nature now when i shoot so i cant go into detail yet. If youre using the tipsi provided about approaching your prey then aim is easy enough with the reticule. What was just said is very true, dont hold the arrow drawn as the sway increases very quickly. If tou draw an arrow and want to cancel it just right click. Take your time and make the first shot count, because if youre stalking them like i explained then it will take awhile to get in range.

That is what I did, and when I came back they had a ton of new and fun features.  It's a good idea to take breaks from a game, especially if it is in early access. Then, come back later, and see all the new features!"
thelongdark,396nrv,scarabcoder,3,Tue Jun 9 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"As far as Early Access games go, this one is on a very regular update cycle, and new content gets added frequently. It's the one EA game where I know they're going to finish it because they keep showing significant progress every month. If I put the game down for a little while and come back, it always feels like it's changed enough that I have to start over and try different strategies.  That said, I get why you'd find it repetitive, and I think your idea about putting it aside until release (or at least until the story mode gets added in) is a good one."
thelongdark,396nrv,getElephantById,2,Tue Jun 9 20:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The purpose of the current sandbox mode is to survive as long as you can.  With the recent changes they've made the only limiting factor on how long you can survive is how much time you are willing to invest into drinking and sleeping to make the numbers go up.  Eventually story mode will come out and things may get a lot more interesting in that department.    This is one of the reasons why I play the way I play.  Long ""normal"" games get really ""samey"" after the first 30-50 days of a run.  Self-imposed challenges are the way to break the cycle.    The challenges I run are all listed on my Twitch channel.  I'd recommend trying out the ""base"" Mega Hard Mode rules, which will put you outside all the time and gives you a ""Victory Condition"" at 50 days(sometimes I shorten it to 30 days) to prevent the run from going on endlessly.  I'm also about to start a run in which I am going to simulate the experience of playing the game with two dependents(children) that I have to feed/water/cloth/etc."

Dont go too far off the beaten track, near the edges ofthe map there is nothing that spawns, auch as the space in mystery lake betwwen the lake and the railroad. But search the snow mounds, they hide the so you really gotta explore. Im surprised you only got 2 birch saplings, in my experience maple saplings spawn small amounts while birch spawns like 4. Maybe youre just unlucky haha."
thelongdark,398f3v,adrianp07,3,Wed Jun 10 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"the meat does degrade over time (% frozen), so I think it remains in-game until it all freezes, then the body disappears. it probably freezes faster if there are storm conditions, so if it sat all night in the very cold, i could see it all degrading before morning."
thelongdark,398f3v,slackmaster,3,Wed Jun 10 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"It's not the %frozen, because you can harvest perfectly fine meat from a 100% frozen deer.  It's a separate timer for how good the meat is."

thelongdark,398f3v,procrastinatorgrrl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:32:59 2015 UTC,"If a wolf falls on your arrow then it's a good idea to harvest it entirely (all meat, guts & hide) go in doors and back out and it will have despawned. Leave anything behind and it will despawn when the meet degrades to zero; this is much faster than when you harvest meat  The found frozen deer don't degrade until you harvest something; if you want crow feathers then don't harvest; just go back periodically to check."
thelongdark,398f3v,JErosion,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened to be. Shot a wolf that had just killed a deer, but it was getting late, I was already encumbered and my condition was down. Went back the next day, both were gone."

thelongdark,38ztvb,TheAngryPuffin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:32:00 2015 UTC,"As far as I could tell, wildlife bleeds out as well, even when you fight them off you. See if you can find a blood trail and try to track them down. I'm pretty new to the game, so I'm not entirely sure about any of this. Might have been my own blood I was seeing. The cold messes with your mind sometimes."
thelongdark,38ztvb,kisspunch,2,Mon Jun 8 10:12:45 2015 UTC,"You're right, they do leave a blood trail to follow but depending on your encounter (and the terrain type) they can run for quite some distance and be difficult to find... leading to an issue with bumping into other wildlife and going far from any storage/base for the resulting meat, etc. I've stopped chasing injured animals, as many disappear over unpassable terrain, preferring to go look later. I think I should have asked what happens in this particular situation."
thelongdark,38ztvb,kisspunch,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, you shouldn't just be blindly following the trail in search for phat lewts. Keeping your eyes solely to the ground is a sure fire way of running into more trouble. It's just a way to follow up on your near kill. I have to give it to Hinterland for the realism here. It's a nice bit of detail.  The fact that they run up unpassable terrain could be attributed to wolf-like mobility. Depends mostly on how believable their path gets, but a bloody trail running up a 80 degree angle may as well be a bug. I don't assume to know Hinterlands' vision for this mechanic, but if they did plan on players following trails and some paths do go all wonky up impossibly steep climbs or through geometry then they should be made aware of this."
thelongdark,38ztvb,LawrencevanNiekerk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"I think a read something about a critical hit modifier in the update which might explain why sometimes they die and sometimes they run off.  I normally chase a deer into their path and then sneek up from behind at a slight angle; get as close as i can; aim just above where I think the heart is. Wolf behavior can be predictable; in the Coastal Highway, I have stopped wasting arrows on the lake because they often run off onto the thin ice or back to the mountain never to be found again.  One good tip (especially when their are three wolves that you want to clear) is to use a flare; get them agro; drop the flare (do not throw it) by equipping the bow; the wolves will agro in front of you; aim just above their head; pick up the flare; go to next wolf; rinse & repeat.   Don't shoot deer; run them into the path of a wolf (preferably a solo wolf); if you kill it then you have less chance of encountering a wolf while you harvest.  It's good to light a fire while you harvest; the wolves will pause; you'll have good shot."
thelongdark,38ztvb,getElephantById,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"So is it distance/effective power of the strike that does the business?   I guess that would be my tentative hypothesis as well. I've only killed three animals with the bow: in two cases, a single point blank shot killed a charging wolf, and in the third it was at about 30 meters, and the deer ran, and ran, and I found its corpse later with arrow in stuck in it. Need more data, though.  As for critical hits, I think they've existed for a while. Definitely in melee, but I think also in ranged hits with the rifle. For example, sometimes it takes 2 hits to kill a bear, sometimes it takes 4-5. The first shot is always a headshot, the rest are always body shots, so what's the difference if not a random damage spread?  I should also point out, for anyone who (like me) wrote off fishing initially for being too weak, they must have revamped it at some point, because now it's fairly easy to build up a surplus of food just by working the shack near the camp lodge."
thelongdark,38ztvb,prestonn77,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"This turned into a much longer post than i anticipated, i think ill just post it to a new thread afterwards for anyone else who misses out. Once again sorry if its confusing or badly constructed, i edited it alot when new bits of information came to mind.  Hello! im currently on my third playthrough and almost to the year mark. I have only found a total of 23 bullets in pleasant valley/mystery lake and was forced to use the bow (i only have 6 bullets left that im saving for a bear/ wolf attacks)  This is my combined knowledge of the bow/hunting mechanics and general behaviour of the animals, i apologize if i repeat anything that has already been established.  General Tips The best hunting situation you can get is finding a deer in proximity of a wolf. Re position yourself so that you can run the deer into the aggro range of the wolf. Once the wolf gives chase start positioning yourself to be ready for when it goes down. Dont rush to wolf too quickly if you only have a bow, sneak up and pegg him. Dont clean the deer yet just make a mental note of where it is and start chasing the wolf. (NOTE: AN INJURED WOLF WILL STILL ATTACK YOU, BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET TOO CLOSE WHEN ITS STILL ALIVE, ALTHOUGH JUST AS OFTEN THEY WILL COMPLETELY IGNORE YOU WHILE INJURED)  -Also Take advantage of storage containers around you ie car trunks, metal/plastic boxes in cabins, and locks, lockers hold 30kg! thats an entire bear. Its better to travel ligh and quickly to your camp, than to inch back with all the meat. Just take what you need for the night, then return the next day-  Finding the Creature This is pretty much up for grabs, its usually just luck although high ground is generally helpful. It will prevent anything from sneaking up on you, as well as gives you more vision which could lead to finding a wolf+deer situation.  Getting in Range for a Shot Crouching. Crouching. Crouching.  Sprinting will scare a creature away from much further than walking, just avoid sprinting if you can. You can walk up to an animal but at a certain point you have to crouch or they get spooked. Then you have to stalk them while crouched. As far as i can tell you can spam the crouch key (causing you to start to stand then crouch) without actually standing to move faster and not spook the creature. You have to stand to take the shot so shoot quickly when youre ready to stand. If you get too close to the animal it will run so youll need to find the right distance yourself through experimentation though i would say about 3 meters. I think that sneaking behind them lets you get closer than if theyre facing you.  Tracking the Creature 90% of the time a tagged animal will bleed (i have tagged several wolves in non critical spots and all they did was run, and not leave any blood trail) and run away (obviously not rabbits though, they get destroyed) Try to follow them with your eyes as far as you can to see what general direction they head, then you have to start following their blood trail. Dont keep chasing them too far if you lose both the animal and the blood trail. There have been times where an animal i hit (as far as i could tell) stopped bleeding and didnt die.  Cleaning the Creature Basically just be careful, if your condition is low or if youre really cold dont clean the entire thing in one sitting, try half if you really have to get the meat, then see how your condition is. Its better to lose some meat than die collecting it. ALSO WHEN CLEANING A BEAR CARCASS BIIIIIIIG TIP: IF you are far away from your base, or a suitable storage area/camp i suggest making a fire near the carcass. Theres alot of meat on a bear and its easy to freeze while cleaning it. The fire also (i think) keeps wolves and the like from trying to kill you while your head is down.  WOLVES: Dont try it with the bow unless they are charging you (in which case you CAN make them run away with a direct frontal shot, although i have been attacked still after pegging them with an arrow. You can also get lucky and crit them) Or unless you catch them feeding on an animal.  DEER: The hardest animal to get with the bow (hardest not most dangerous) I think their detection is higher, either that or they just run while a wolf will chase you. either way you really have to sneak up on these guys  RABBITS: Rabbits move the exact same speed as you when crouched, use the crouch spam trick to get close to them, or stay still if theyre coming to you. At a certain distance they stop and hunch down. This is when you shoot, 99% of the time if i try to get closer at this point they run, so just go for the shot when you see them hunch down."

thelongdark,38x6qk,tinycatsamurai,8,Sun Jun 7 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"I mean... I kind of thought the point of having super warm gear is to be able to withstand these conditions. Not have them implode as soon as they are up against the elements. Nevertheless, does give me something to do!"
thelongdark,38x6qk,tinycatsamurai,3,Mon Jun 8 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I agree.  Things degrade far too quickly. Even for gameplay reasons."
thelongdark,38x6qk,Kraelman,3,Mon Jun 8 05:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  This is one of the big points that really breaks immersion for me.  It is far easier to recover your condition score than repair all your clothing... so from a pure game mechanics standpoint it's better to run stark-ass naked through the blizzard to get to shelter and sleep to recover whatever freezing damage you took.    IMO:     Clothing degradation due to blizzards needs to be cut waaay down.   Freezing damage needs to scale up depending on the ""Feels Like"" temperature.  Right now you take the same amount of damage from the ""Freezing"" status if you are at -1C or -60C.   Basically they need to balance the risk/reward of having clothes on during a blizzard.  Right now its tilted way in favor of simply not wearing any clothes at all."

Stuff gets wrecked REALLY quickly, unless you hide from bad weather and all wildlife.  With the bow, it's easy to kill enough animals to fix everything, but you'll run out of sewing kits quickly.  Even using the fishing gear to replace the sewing kit, you'll run out of scrap metal to make hooks."

Built a bow.  When almost out of matches, moved to CH.  Found lots of knives, lots of matches, moved into quonset, been stepping outside and waiting for wolves, shooting them with the bow, harvesting, retreating inside until I'm out of meat, rinse, repeat.  Still no rifle, striker, or magnifier, but haven't searched much here yet.  Need more deerskins.  I'm wondering why we can't repair boots and pants with cured leather?  I've got lots of that, lots of gut, quite a few rabbit pelts and wolf skins.  Once all my clothing is fully repaired, I'm going to go after a bear with the bow, just to see how it goes.  Issues:  Lone cabin is missing, externally.  Draft dodger might be missing, not sure I remember exactly where it is.  Can't repair my bedroll.  Bow doesn't always come up fully.  Partially cured gut all stacks together when picked up.  Audio cuts out sometimes for a few seconds.  Questions: Why do we get rosehips in 8s, but need 25 to brew tea (hotdog bun question)?  Why is harvest still default on the action page?  How about hot keys on the actions page?  H for harvest, R for repair, F for fuel, and so on.  Why can't I pick up rabbits?  72 or 78 days so far, I forget.  Edit:  Forgot that I finally found my first bunker!  Not much in it, but convenient, since I was freezing and had a sprained ankle.

After playing like that for an hour and a half you really appreciate being able to see.    My other run that is going right now is on Day 6.    Conditions: - Mega Hard Mode(Always outside) - Nomad Mode(Can't sleep in the same place twice) - Micro-sleep(Must sleep in 1 hour increments only) - Red Meat Allergy(Can't eat deer, rabbit, wolf, bear, jerky, dog food, pork'n'beans)    Had a few people ask me this week why I play with all the self-imposed challenges.  There are two things that happen in the game that kind of take me ""out"" of the game and break immersion.     Interior temperatures are always constant.  A house in Coastal Highway will always be +2C... even if it's -30C outside.  The complete and total protection that interior locations provide removes the threat of the environment.  The Always Outside challenge makes the cold environment a very big factor.   If you are 100% condition and mauled by a bear it is possible to almost completely recover from that ordeal by sleeping for 12 hours straight with only your clothes worse for wear.  Does not compute.  The rate of sleep-healing really takes me out of the game, since so long as you survive you can completely recover by the next day.  The Micro-Sleep condition solves this and makes it much more realistic... only healing 1-3%(depending on where you sleep) for every hour you sleep makes recovering from injuries a bit more realistic."

I made the quonset station my base of operations because it's so centrally located, but I need to watch my ass for wolves every time I leave.

I started in Coastal Highway, but this week I've been moving all my stuff slowly over to the dam, taking many trips between the two zones to do it. I usually operate out of the camp office, but now it seems like Carter is the most centrally-located spot, so I've been working from there.   Probably around 200 days, if I make it that long, I'll move to Pleasant Valley. I have been employing a very melee-centric hunting strategy, which costs me a lot of bandages, so I think my limiting resource will be clothes and maybe moss/antiseptic.   Other than that, I have a crazy amount of stuff, most of it on the floor of the foyer in the dam.   I've decided the bow is only useful when you're like 5 meters away from something, it's just too hard to aim.

Stalker mode, random spawn, started in ML, near the dam, with 1 hour of daylight left. Followed the river to the camp office - wanted to try and avoid the pack of wolves I always seem to find at the derailment. Dodged two wolves on the lake with a flare, got inside the camp office, eat, sleep, phew.  Next morning, I venture outside, and decide to just try the ole' rifle bunker spawn point, to see if I got lucky. And holy crap, I did. So now, after having quickly looted trappers, the outlook, and the dam, I've got 3 rifles, all above 60%, 35 rounds, and almost a full set of tools (hatchet, 2 x knives, tools, sewing kit, magnifier, but no firestriker yet.)  Determined not to let my good luck go to waste. I'm not planning on staying long in ML, will probably round up all the loot and store it in the dam, then hopefully move on to PV (still haven't really explored that place at all) before the week is up. The only bullet I've used so far was on Fluffy, and I only just found the hatchet in the dam, so I still need to go looking for saplings to make a bow too.  I have a fair bit of scrap metal and feathers, so I should be able to make enough arrows. Can anyone recommend how many you should carry? Can you re-use them, i.e. pull them from the corpses of your enemies? Any other tips for someone who rarely plays on stalker mode?"

Tried to stay in one of those fishing cabins, but I was ""freezing"" so I tried to go back to the Lodge but I couldn't see crap, after looking for a while I gave up then tried to go back to the fishing cabin.

If the commercial winds keep blowing in Hinterland's favour, we could yet see The Long Dark move into spring, summer and autumn, the game evolving and changing as the story unfolds.   Man, that sounds fantastic.  I'd love to see how they figure out how to keep the desperation factor intact in other seasons.

thelongdark,38ed6y,mutokangius,2,Thu Jun 4 02:35:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting. I admire the developers' commitment to a final release despite ongoing sales - unlike other Alpha releases on Steam - which is what the article explores.  The game is excellent, but players will lose interest in the Sandbox mode before that, despite the incentive of much-anticipated updates.  I suggest well-seasoned players would stay for a longer haul if there was some further incentive to keep playing. Perhaps by keeping a 'real world' clock going on saved games, so players are compelled to re-enter the game at their saved stage rather than leave it. For example, a player with 50+ days survived would know that in 50 actual days, their in-game character would lose stats, as if playing. This could ratchet up the compulsion to survive.  Have the devs considered this?  (Ha! Please enjoy the irony of posting feedback after reading an article that somewhat denigrates feedback).  It's shame Hinterland don't want applications from c# devs based in the uk ;)  Please keep your resolve and see this game through to AAA release. I'll be keenly watching."

thelongdark,38awou,coolboarder80,2,Wed Jun 3 13:19:22 2015 UTC,"I have found another solution, when you go to any building that has light shining through from the window, I would go toward the light area on the floor and crouch down to look around, and found many items on shelves far across the room that would normally be invisible due to the darkness if you are not under the light.  If you stand up or step out of the light, you would not be able to see anything.   So I have used the crouch down feature to take a look around and found many loots without ever using any matches or lantern.  The light acts as a special filter to see through the room, even the dark area has been brightening if you stood behind the light and look across even if you are standing up.  Crouching helps to see more loots."

thelongdark,3841mw,sewiv,3,Mon Jun 1 18:24:54 2015 UTC,Use the white dot for reference; it disappears when you draw but if you are coming up on a wolf / deer combo you will have a bit of time to line up the shot before you draw; once you've shot it a few times you start to get a feel for it without referencing the white dot.

Currently living off candy bars, and charging wolves with my knife. However, it is frustrating when they run and either run up the sheer face of a mountain, or I follow the bloodtrail and it suddenly stops without a trace.   I think it would be really cool to have a ""fight to the death"" option where you can hold onto the wolf to get that extra stab in, perhaps at the cost of 15-20% condition. A way to actively attack the wolves would be cool too. I know there are times I'd love to charge a wolf with my hatchet."

They seem to show up for a long time and helped me navigate at night or in a storm if I got caught in one.  One tip when setting up stashes, use a similar storing method in each place.   e.g. I always put food supplies in the fridge and water in the freezer of buildings that had a fridge. Food in the top drawer of a filing cabinet and water in the second.  Having a 'system' helps you find stuff when you really need it. Hope that helps!!"

Alternatively, and I can't remember, maybe it just defaults to the hatchet but you can then choose later the item for use which affects your speed of work (i.e. gutting carcass faster with knife than axe, etc.)."

Container = anything permanent which holds other items, which includes fallen human bodies. Use your time constructively, harvest useless inventory and begin fabricating animal hide clothing asap whilst kept inside during white-outs or final hours of day/night time not spend sleeping or attaining a good condition. When using the bow, expect to be spending a few in-game hours hunting any prey, with multiple failed attempts where potentially no arrows are fired. Your patience will eventually pay off. Keep space available in your inventory for inevitable wolf Vs. deer kills that you come across opportunistically, a quick intervention and harvesting yields more meat in less time. Being significantly overburdened is not only boring, but kills time within game which could be spend doing calorie-yielding activities.    Best of what I can do without repeating other recommendations, all the best :-)"

Alternately, you can sleep for an hour in a bed in an enclosed hut with no fire going, and it will warm you a chunk. Outside conditions will impact both those scenarios for better or worse. I've never survived a night sleeping outside, but the two fires tip is a good one for catching a couple hours."

I survived 225 days and I think I could have survived more. Tips are always welcome in these cases, involving survival and must be combined with strategy and attention to places that you walk in the hunting actions, the collection of items in the way feeds and their conservation. Often you should avoid wolves and bears, pursuing another path. Other times you should seek shelter for warmth and rest. I'll leave up some tips that could make a difference in their survival in The Long Dark.  Thank you!"
thelongdark,37lwq9,FrancisMaulli,2,Wed Jun 3 01:00:05 2015 UTC,"First: There are like sleeping outdoors at night snowstorm?  Yes!  Very simple, if ... You have a bag of bearskin sleeping, wolf fur coat, deerskin boots and rabbit fur gloves. Light a fire and put the sleeping bag right next to the fire place and firewood for 10 hours. with normal sleeping bags also work. The problem is that the bearskin sleeping bag wears out with use, as well as coats and boots if there are many snowstorms. The problem is that there can be no winds or heavy snowfall at the time a fire, as this will not work."
thelongdark,37lwq9,Ryanoski,2,Wed Jun 3 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"How to kill a bear without exposing there is a frontal attack?  Often I made this serious mistake and ended up dying. And I used this strategy:  Seeking a fishing house or a house where there is a balcony. I attract the bear to close and shoot in the head, he'll attack you but you can not because it is protected by the small entrance. A shot of a gun would be enough to bring it down, but it will take a few hours to fall. Three shots drop it. This also works with arrows. There are 36 kg meat, skin and ten one intestines. Gives to survive for 12 days, set traps, repairing clothes and so on."
thelongdark,37lwq9,thudly,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:26:15 2015 UTC,Wolves are afraid of flares. Always have at least one.
thelongdark,37lwq9,GrandfatherRat,5,Thu May 28 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I just realized this recently. And if you right-click, it throws the flare at them and they run off. Suddenly the game went from nearly impossible to very difficult. :-D  Also, pressing 1 is the hotkey for whipping a torch out, if you have one."
thelongdark,37lwq9,LawrencevanNiekerk,2,Thu May 28 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you have to throw the flare at them twice before they run off far enough... make sure you pick it back up! Also, 2 is hot key for the lantern, and 3 for the firearm. Pressing 4 I believe drops the an inventory item, so watch that..."
thelongdark,37lqhi,BookTheShepherd,4,Thu May 28 15:23:19 2015 UTC,Yes it is intentional. You have to get to the other platform and use the destroyed window next to the broken door.

thelongdark,37ltt6,Hitandrun127,2,Thu May 28 23:59:44 2015 UTC,It depends on whether you're encumbered and/or have raw meat on you.  Both of those things make the wolves more aggressive towards you.

thelongdark,37k9cr,Hilgy17,1 point,Fri May 29 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"That video does a good job of showing precisely how important it is to have even a little firearm training, just in case. I was taught how to shoot by my grandfather when I was 12- we used an old .22 that used to be my uncle's. Eventually I upgraded to firing the 4-10 at squirrels around the farm, etc.   While I'll almost never have to use a long gun in an emergency situation, knowing my way around one helps me keep up the feeble, hilarious delusion while I'm playing the Long Dark that maybe, just maybe, this guy is me."
thelongdark,37k9cr,HMSErebus,5,Sat Jun 27 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"No, I find the rifle to be quite accurate and is a one-shot kill if you aim for the head or neck. You'll soon see how accurate it really is once you've made a bow.  Deer can be snuck up on from behind and you can get quite close, depending on the ambient noise levels. Even if you don't kill the deer in one shot, you can usually track the wounded animal by following the trail of blood.  I used to use the rifle against attacking wolves, but found it to be a waste of ammunition. I prefer to scare the wolf with a flare or torch, or avoid it altogether."
thelongdark,37k9cr,CambleC,10,Thu May 28 12:23:03 2015 UTC,"I don't fire the thing until I'm about to be mauled.  I don't bother shooting at deer, they're too skittish to get close enough to use the rifle for. Although, I haven't tried since they updated the hunting/sneaking mechanics.  I pretty much just chase deer into wolves, then shoot the wolf."
thelongdark,37k9cr,DynamicAjax,2,Thu May 28 06:57:37 2015 UTC,This is what I've ended up having to do. I chase one into the other and then shoot the one who survives. But ultimately the rifle seems inaccurate and underpowered.
thelongdark,37k9cr,deltron80,3,Thu May 28 07:13:16 2015 UTC,I think they also said they added decreasing accuracy with fatigue in this most recent update.
thelongdark,37k9cr,badlions,2,Thu May 28 19:54:12 2015 UTC,Try to keep it over 90% repaired it helps with accuracy imoho. As for deer hunting from the side or front/side and aim at the heart.
thelongdark,37k9cr,thudly,2,Thu May 28 11:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I think they added the mechanic where the condition of the rifle effects its accuracy. If the rifle is at 50%, the damage will only be 50%. If someone can confirm this, let me know. If it is true, I guess repairing the thing would help."
thelongdark,37k9cr,Lumpzor,1 point,Thu May 28 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"I thought so at first, until they changed the sneaking mechanics.   What I do now is sneak, crawl slowly behind the deer, and wait. Eventually they turn around and walk towards you and if you're crouching and not moving they come pretty close ( head on ) allowing for 1 shot kills."
thelongdark,37k9cr,JPTawok,1 point,Thu May 28 07:33:36 2015 UTC,"Don't bother shooting at deer.  Only use your gun when you're about to be hurt, and you can guarantee a headshot.

Yeah, I can't hit anything past about 25 meters, even if I'm crouched, stationary, and the sights are perfectly aligned. The rifle just misses.   I've even looked for tutorials on how to use the rifle. I would practice with it, but ammunition is so precious I never had the guts to.   Does it even leave a mark if you fire it at a wall or something? I've only ever fired it at animals.  It's fine with me, though. I like the realism of having a shitty gun and a guy who isn't automatically a special forces sniper, like in every other game. It just means I have to wait for the right opportunity."

thelongdark,37jtcy,JPTawok,3,Thu May 28 15:49:23 2015 UTC,I just started a game earlier today and spawned in the trapper's homestead. No rifle though. I did get a bunch of cool stuff including a Premium Winter Coat in good shape.  One game I spawned right outside Carter Dam and inside there was a rifle and like 25 bullets. Of course on that save file I got killed by something after shooting off maybe 2 bullets.

thelongdark,37jtcy,Ryanoski,3,Thu May 28 12:42:51 2015 UTC,Not exactly in front of but my first time loading up the game ever was loading it up on my brothers laptop as mine broke and I bought the game on sale so I couldn't play. Anyways he spawned in a valley near the derailment and he found a rifle with 5 bullets and wasted all 5
thelongdark,37jtcy,itavara,2,Thu May 28 13:50:01 2015 UTC,I once spawned in the trapper's homestead. So yes.
thelongdark,37jtcy,ThePianistOfDoom,1 point,Thu May 28 12:29:45 2015 UTC,"Hilarious! Me too!  I spawned at the loggers trailers, and ran to the camp office, found an axe at the desolate cabin, I was thrilled since I had not got an axe in my last 13+ day play through. Pop into the trappers cabin and it's hanging on the wall.   I too feel like I'm cheating! First thing I thought was man I could go out and take care of that wolf outside!"
