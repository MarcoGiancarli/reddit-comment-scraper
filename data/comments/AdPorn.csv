The era needs to be taken into account when weighing the value/quality of this ad.    It's bright, it's fun, it's catchy as hell (try not to say it out loud in your head).    It keys into pancakes, a very, very american breakfast dish for the time.    It even portrays the man, head of the household, asking his wife why he should even bother getting up, despite being asked to do so. The woman must coach him up with the promise of delicious food.    Furthermore, this is the supposedly an ad from 40's. Likely not during the war, as SPAM's demand was being artificially bolstered through the Military Industrial Complex.    After the war was over, SPAM sales tanked like crazy. They kept some of their original market share (Hawaii, for example) but the men coming home from the war wanted nothing to do with this salty piece of ham-chunk.    After a few years, though, with the help of clever advertising, the soldiers kind of missed it. Sales grew, Spam marketing helped place the food product square within the realm of ""real american cuisine"", and dare I say, culture.    ...for a time. In the end, it's a salty pork cube, but still.    It had it's hay day. It helped win the war.    This ad was effective back in the day, and is a great legacy of our history today.    Fuck it, I'm having a print made and I'm hanging it in my kitchen.    bonus edit - who in god's name would put such an ugly product so huge and dead-center of an ad like this in today's world? Nobody. I love this ad. It shows us where we've been, how far we've come, and where we are. This ad belongs here."

I may be reading to deep into this but it also seems shallow, like the appearance is what is important and the inside needs to be covered for your own good. It also shames women who don't wear hijbas. It's hard to make an effective ad for something that is progressively backwards and misogynistic."
AdPorn,3auuge,Johnny_Horsecock,60,Tue Jun 23 22:50:47 2015 UTC,"They succeeded in clearly portraying a complex message with extremely simple visuals. The goal is not to paint their society in any sort of light, it's to promote hijabs, which it does perfectly.  Also, ads can't be both effective and misogynistic?

For me, it reminds me of talks they gave us at church youth group when I was a teenager when they likened us girls having pre-marital sex to guys passing around a hamburger. They used to do this thing where each guy took a bite out of this hamburger and passed it to the next guy. As if a girl choosing to have pre-marital sex automatically makes her promiscuous, and even if she does choose to have a lot of sex partners, she is just a completely passive object being used. There's no concept that a woman can enjoy having a lot of sex. This hijab ad reduces the woman to an object to be devoured, as well. As if she is purely a passive part of the male-female relationship and she has no agency of her own."

It's about eliciting emotion, often in the basest way possible. You use ""shallow"" like its a dirty word in the ad world, but I know a lot of ADs who would take that as a compliment. Why? Because it means the ad got to you.    It also shames women who don't wear hijbas.   Please, refrain from using the word ""shame"" or ""shaming"" - it triggers me. All jokes aside, that kind of verbage has absolutely no place here. Is a coke commercial shaming pepsi drinkers? Is a diet ad shaming fat people? Ads, at their best, are persuasive - I think this is very persuasive in getting women to wear a Hijab - therefor, it accomplished it's goal. You don't have to like its goal to understand that it achieves it.   Also, I will remind you that ""professionally offended"" is not a viable career path. Ads are sometimes here to shock. The creative mind behind this one is absolutely loving that you're upset by it."

This doesn't do that for a lot of people it seems. Crude example but Coke could use an ad where the backdrop is a swastika and it would certainly illicit emotion but it would still hurt their bottom line. I don't think it is persuasive, if you take a minute to think about it it is offensive and the undertones are backwards at best. He may love that I'm offended by it but that certainly doesn't help him in what he was hired to do, which is to sell the idea that women should wear hijabs. That is the ultimate goal here and it failed. It's hard to sell such an outdated and backwards idea, it may be clever but spending 30 seconds thinking about it you can see the holes quite clearly."

Put yourself in the audiences shoes - if you're living in an Arab country where the hijab is common place or encouraged, this ad is fucking genius.  It's not made for you, no wonder you hate it - your inability to distance yourself from your own personal beliefs means you can't analyze the ad on its technical merits.

I also think the effectiveness and aesthetics of this poster is questionable. Imagine for a second that it was selling chocolate, the first chocolate to come in individual wrappers to keep it sanitary. That's a disgusting image to associate your product with.  This poster is also ineffective for its purpose because it re-enforces an idea to male viewers that ""if she's not covered up, she wants it"".

But on the other hand, telling women (specifically) something that is plainly fucking obvious to them is just unhelpful and disrespectful to 99% of women. This differs from anti-theft adverts in that they are not targeting a gender."

Not just in the sense of getting statistically significant meaningful data, but even to the extent that it is at all in any way meaningful whatsoever. Like, ""Hitler did nothing wrong"" has been said millions of times on the internet by people who almost certainly believe otherwise. It still shows up (for me) as the top results for ""hitler did"". Go ahead and poll people and see if one of the top responses to ""what did hitler do?"" is actually ""nothing wrong."" Spoiler alert, it's probably not going to be."
AdPorn,39wyje,Muffinizer1,11,Tue Jun 16 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think these ads are trying to say that a majority of people think this way.

I ended up taking a job with Seachange where I now work as a viral producer for projects including River Cottage, Crowdfunder and Hugh's Fish Fight. To show my gratitude to everyone who shared my website I decided to take the highly original step of hiring a billboard:   Maybe it's jealousy but people here seem really bitter about this guy. Yet what he did is undeniably creative and effective-- like many others he was unemployed but he took an unconventional way to stand out and it worked extremely well.  Seems it was extremely successful. He demonstrated understanding of design, capturing attention, curiosity, and most importantly, how to get media attention which fits this job perfectly. All for a budget of £500. If he could tell a client ""I got on every major national news outlet, trended on Twitter, and tens of thousands of international organic hits with only a budget of £500. Imagine what we could do with your budget."" That's already a sales pitch done."

AdPorn,36kypz,Sufficio,35,Wed May 20 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"While I love the visual style of this, I at first found the content confusing; it took several moments to register what they were even trying to say, since personally the scenario depicted is not remotely a ""Instant turn off"" to me. Once I realized their message, I found it offensive and short sighted. Assuming that the depicted scenario is an ""Instant turn off"" is pretty narrow minded - after all, as an alternative read it's entirely possible both members of the presumed couple in the image are into it, and it is instead an instant ""turn on""...  Personally, as a transwoman, I would avoid purchasing any products from a company that approved this ad."

At the very least it if I did walk in on my husband trying on my underwear it would be a conversation starter, not an instant or auto turn off, as the ad seems to suggest.   I didn't think of it from a transperson's point of view and do see how it could be regarded as offensive. Especially to someone who was in the early stages of transitioning and feeling especially vulnerable. After seeing this, I would also avoid products from that company if they were offered in my country."

AdPorn,35mtum,exnihilonihilfit,10,Mon May 11 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"Arguably a bit racist, not just because the shark and tiger ones are entirely Asian people, but notably the darker asians are at the bottom. Not saying this doesn't reflect the reality of these trades, but you would think they'd be a little bit more mindful of putting darker people at the base of the pyramid. The structure is upside down. There aren't 4 poachers for every consumer, there are four consumers for ever poacher.  Unclear. Who exactly am I stopping? One of the poachers? or the consumer at the top? I think the upshot is that if you stop consumption then there won't be a market and the poaching will stop, but that's not what this picture is saying. If we simply remove the guy at the top, then we still have a three tiered pyramid here. Bottom line, stopping any one person just isn't enough.    It's a nice sentiment and I really think the artwork is great, but in the end, it doesn't make sense. Truly, though, it doesn't really have to make sense to get the point across. If they just had a picture of poachers that said ""Stop Them,"" we'd be fine."
AdPorn,35mtum,kaosjester,4,Tue May 12 00:14:51 2015 UTC,I agree entirely with your complaints. I think the inversed stacking order would actually solve the entire problem of who to stop and how it works.

Source: Am enterprise PPC manager."
AdPorn,346aa8,jacqueofalltrades,5,Tue Apr 28 20:55:51 2015 UTC,I agree. Conquest ads that I have ran for the automotive industry have had terrible ROI and user engagement. I always advise against it.

AdPorn,346aa8,ohsweetman,-2,Wed Apr 29 12:02:56 2015 UTC,Yeah if you click on it and read the whole thing. Nowhere does the ad state that.
AdPorn,346aa8,Plankzt,4,Wed Apr 29 12:16:15 2015 UTC,It even says from only 10 m... You should be able to interpret that fairly easily.
AdPorn,346aa8,ohsweetman,-1,Wed Apr 29 12:22:28 2015 UTC,"I take it you don't have a job in marketing. We can yeah because we've spent 2 seconds to read the ad but lots of people wont, PPC ads warrant a cursory glance at best. The word minute isn't displayed anywhere in that ad, nor any reference to time, just the words ""Our battery lasts up to 4 hours"" and the letter m.  It's a fucking shitty ad, how are you defending it."
AdPorn,346aa8,picardo85,4,Wed Apr 29 12:29:15 2015 UTC,"I take it you don't understand the concept of target audiences? To an even moderately tech savvy person, the ""our battery lasts up to 4 hours"" line is more intriguing than anything else.   No phone battery lasts only 4 hours, and if you don't realise that, then Samsung probably isn't going to convince you to buy an expensive smartphone in the first place."

AdPorn,346aa8,Sapharodon,2,Wed Apr 29 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"Not everyone who sees your ad is your target audience. I would wager that most people Googling ""iPhone 6s"" have probably made their mind up on what phone is better.  People are defending it because the ad isn't bad at all. You can make an argument against the ""our batter lasts up to 4 hours"" line, but that's an argument from a manager. I'm going to go on a limb and suggest that the people looking at this subreddit are interested in creativity and bravery in advertising.  The safest ads are the dullest ones that everyone forgets. This ad isn't particularly brilliant to me, but it's memorable and interesting. If I saw it in the wild, I'd remember it and think of Samsung in a more positive light. In this particular instance, I am the target audience (I'm even looking at buying a new smartphone), so it seems the ad works."

Personally I'm a fan of it and do it pretty often where I'll go with lots of 'tame' cuss words and then end on a 'fuck'. Just for giggles.  Also it's a really easy way to give a personality to a voice in a very small space. The writing in the ad -- just a note left by a marker -- and the tone all conveys the idea that it's 'just some guy' who works for the company who scrawled that on a piece of paper and they decided to print it as an ad.  The playful language use just adds to that. Or that's how I see it at least.

I resent Molson beer because the family owns my cities hockey team (the Canadiens) and yet beers at a game are the most expensive in the NHL. Once I have paid my 50$ for a ""cheap ticket"" I pay 12$ for a half litre of beer. Guess what... I deliberately get extra buzzed on the competitors product before the game, dont buy beer at the game, and then avoid bringing their products into my home because they killed my loyalty."

If you are 16-17 you may be bought a drink by an adult if with a meal, and 18 or over: get drinking!  The 3rd link seems to back that up, clearly no food is being sold here, and there is no way to even check who is pouring a drink. My guess is it's being secretly monitored or even that it's cordoned off and only actors appear in the film.  Edit:Spelling"
AdPorn,31zhdt,drewthevander,5,Thu Apr 9 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"probably have actors for the photos, then when cameras are away they get a ""bouncer"" to check id before pouring. most countries have a problem with free 'unlimited' beer being served on a street corner to minors."

AdPorn,31zhdt,Todda468,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:24:57 2015 UTC,The general legal idea is that when you have some obligation you can only be freed from liability from failing in that (ie. ensuring under 18s don't get alcohol) if you take significant measures. So if a 17YO has a really good fake ID that's checked at the door then the bar isn't at fault.
AdPorn,31zhdt,redditforgotaboutme,3,Fri Apr 10 14:45:52 2015 UTC,"Because in some parts of the USA it's illegal to receive alcohol for free. For instance, in Tempe, AZ off of the ASU campus, some bars get as close to free as possible by doing penny pitchers. They have to sell it for something or it's illegal."
AdPorn,31zhdt,ramblerandgambler,2,Thu Apr 9 14:25:35 2015 UTC,"Ah right, I knew this was in the UK, which informed my answer. That's interesting though for AZ. There's no way that would work int he UK or Ireland however, you'd have to include a heavy sales tax on alcohol, no matter how cheap you're cost price is. The cheapest beer you would ever see in Ireland would be €3 per pint and I've never seen a pint below £3 in London but I know up North you can get shots/pints for a pound."

The call to action is a freaking physical tap that you can use to drink the product.  Keep in mind, based on the location, that this is very attention getting. You see an open tap of a beer whose brand is clearly identified. This isn't on a billboard 200 feet up in the air.  Let a queue form up around it and it's even more attention getting and becomes a conversation point.  It isn't perfect, but it's certainly worthy of discussion and is above average for stunt ads, IMO"

AdPorn,319nvx,Opandemonium,2,Fri Apr 3 11:53:05 2015 UTC,"sometimes creatives forget the point of advertising is to sell products.   The thing is, it's not an ad to sell products. The brief was not to sell food product. It's an institutional ad aimed at improving the image of the brand while it keeps making ""dog"" a topic on top of the mind of the audiences.  There is no way the brand would have accepted this ad as an ad to sell products, they had what they wanted."

When it comes to what I feed my dog I really don't care how cool the brand is.   My biggest concern is whether or not it will upset her stomach.

AdPorn,3102pl,Hornet72,5,Wed Apr 1 12:56:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly? This ad kind of sucks. For one thing, had the title not told me what it was advertising, I don't think it would have been clear. Certainly it would have taken me a bit to figure it out. If I saw this walking by in a subway station or driving by a billboard I doubt I would have noticed what it was trying to sell. Secondly, I'm not entirely sure what the joke is supposed to be. Is the man using a wide angle lens so he can get a picture of the women without pointing the camera directly at them? It isn't obvious and I don't think most people would have realized this. An effective ad doesn't take time to ""get."" Finally, I just don't think the composition of the photo is all that great. In fact, I think it just looks kind of awkward and strange.  All in all, not impressed."

I think it's likely that most photographers would notice an ad like this and be interested in it, simply because they recognize a good camera in the image.

The coolest thing about the tuner is the action on the dial. There must be a series of gears because the speed you turn the dial doesn't correspond to how fast the needle moves. So if you turn it slow the needle barely inches along to the point where it's almost imperceptible but still moving. Or, if you spin it really fast and let go, the dial will keep spinning but the needle will only move up to a certain smooth speed and kind of gently bounce off 108."

AdPorn,301pff,rocketman0739,31,Mon Mar 23 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"For anyone who doesn't know - the silver faced receivers of that era are quite valuable today. And it's not just because vintage is cool.     In the 1980's, the market was flooded with cheap stereo gear made with black plastic cases and cheap internals. They were price point items, sold as a set with a cassette deck, an equalizer, a receiver, a marginal turntable, maybe a cd player, a shitty stand to hold them all, and a big crappy pair of speakers. It was the 'home theater in a box' of it's time.     Following that, in the 1990's, receivers had to incorporate 5 speaker surround sound, first dolby pro logic, and then dolby digital. That meant that your $449 receiver now had to contain advanced digital signal processing, and 5 amplifiers in stead of two.     Today, that same unit might also have to deal with HDMI, wifi, bluetooth, a remote that can control all of your components, and 100 billion billion connections on the back.       But what makes an amplifier sound good has not changed much for 40 years. You need a good power supply transformer, which is the heaviest and most expensive part. After that you need 2 good amplifier circuits with a bank of meaty transistors.     So if you are looking into a 2 speaker setup, an amplifier made 40 years ago is probably superior to a modestly priced receiver from 2015. And when it breaks, you can fix it, which is nice.     Vintage audio is kind of unique in the technological world because there has not been a truly 'next gen' audio product for decades. It's kind of like assault rifles - they have had only incremental improvements since the 1940's. Thus it is with audio. If you want to spend 300 bucks to power a pair of decent speakers, you're probably better off buying a used Marantz, or Technics, or MacIntosh, from the 1970's."
AdPorn,301pff,datums,9,Mon Mar 23 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"Don't discount Pioneer. Everyone has a hard-on for Marantz these days, but Pioneer was at the top of its game in the 70s."
AdPorn,301pff,riomx,14,Tue Mar 24 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"No disagreement here. I used to sell Pioneer. Their main feature was that Pioneer never blew up. It was designed for abuse.     And we all loved the early 2000's pioneer DVD players. For a hundred bucks you bought a player that would never break, but you could access all of the features from the buttons on the front. That was right around the time when main stream manufacturers were putting out gear with important features that could only be accessed from the remote.    Jesus, I'm old."

AdPorn,301pff,acalmerkarma,2,Tue Mar 24 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"Borrowing from a comment I posted previously:   I really like vintage headphones and don't spend often on new ones, but I can compare them to my Sony MDR-V700 headphones for mixing and my Panasonic RP-HTX7s that I used to use daily. The SE-50, SE-405 and SE-505 sound great, but dated compared to modern headphones. The Panasonic headphones beat them handily. However, the Monitor 10 and SE-L40 headphones definitely hold up for a quality listening experience, especially the latter.  Most people complain that the low end is light on the SE-L40, but I don't know what they're talking about. I had to keep the bass low on my receiver because it was so lively. You have to temper expectations a bit especially if you're used to high-end modern headphones when you try out vintage headphones.  They probably won't blow you away, but the experience of enjoying music in a way that people did 30-40 years ago is so much fun -- it's why I got the SE-505s. It's ridiculous that they crammed a tweeter and a driver on each side and it's fun to be able to control tone and volume when you're listening to music or movies.  However, the further you go up the ladder, the more that the experience and performance will be familiar. I was not expecting the SE-L40s to be so good, but after a few minutes of listening with them, they're my go-to pair now. They're amazing. I also tried out my Monitor 10s again a few minutes ago and the sound is incredible -- they were designed for audiophile listening or studio monitor applications."

AdPorn,301pff,maybe_sparrow,2,Tue Mar 24 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"eBay and ShopGoodwill. Here are some. Just always check the condition before you buy.   On eBay, ask sellers about smoke damage if you think there's a chance the headphones were owned by a smoker. Or steer clear of anything that looks discolored.   You can usually distinguish between the good and the bad. You can tell by the condition of the earpieces and trim whether they were abused or lightly used and forgotten about. The latter are what I try to go after.  http://www.shopgoodwill.com/auctions/Pioneer-SE-L40-Stereo-Headphones-w-Case-20622940.html  http://www.shopgoodwill.com/auctions/Stereo-Pioneer-Headphones-20626044.html  http://www.shopgoodwill.com/auctions/Pioneer--Montior-10-Headphones-20626496.html"

AdPorn,301pff,Roberth1990,6,Mon Mar 23 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"If it was dead simple it would be a single ended class A with no feedback amplifier, which it isn't. Same goes for tone controllers and radio."
AdPorn,301pff,MangoCats,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"I have a Perraux class A amp, stereo, no volume control, no nothing, just two channels of cabinet baking amplification.  It still failed, power switch would arc on contact, and require cleaning / rebuild every couple of dozen cycles.  (Solution: turn it off by unplugging it.)  So, yeah, my dad's Marantz was an impressive piece of kit, as it should have been for the price: 2 weeks of salary in 1972.  By the 1990s the pots were going dirty, otherwise it would have lasted an absurdly long time."
AdPorn,301pff,Roberth1990,1 point,Tue Mar 24 12:47:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure what your point is, and I don't how old your amplifier is. But most things like for example Marantz's old amplifier are built to last much longer through usage of better capasitors etc than most modern amplifiers. How simple the topology isn't alone an indicator of how long it lasts and how large the error rate is. According to what I read, only a few of todays the amplifier and similar eletronics are built to last, but they tend be overpriced if you just compare things like design, features, sound quality to cheaper amplifiers, which in turn fail more often."
AdPorn,301pff,MangoCats,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:19:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure I had a point - the Perraux is, still, a rock solid amplifier - efficient? No. Cheap? No. But, there's very little in there to go wrong.  The thing that bugs me about modern ""class D"" kit is the total lack of attention people seem to pay to the noise floor.  Get one in a quiet room and the speakers hiss - louder than my air-conditioning vents... maybe not all, but many of the modern ""Dolby 7.2 blah blah"" feature amplifiers seem to have this problem, and it's damn hard to pin down from a spec sheet."
AdPorn,301pff,Roberth1990,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"Well the perraux is probably a push pull type, which still makes a lot of difference.

Still not convinced... how about finding the only 'splash' of water that casts a shadow?   What shape is that splash of water?  There were other less sexual ads that we went over as well.

What do we call an example piece of advertising communication? That's right, an ""ad."" I think it counts, though in real life we'd more likely call it a publicity piece. As for the ""unprofessional"" photo, my guess is that they're hoping for viral social media exposure. They're trying to give the impression that this was a cell phone photo taken by Mr. Clarkson after receiving it.  If they're not behind it, it's still a great piece of free advertising for them no matter how much exposure it gets. It's also some proof of buy-in for the campaign."

AdPorn,2ywp2p,masterofgalaxies,15,Fri Mar 13 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"A hugely famous UK TV presenter has been suspended from his job, allegedly because he punched a colleague in a fracas over a steak dinner.   In reference to this, someone has supposedly mailed a box of chocolate bars, complete with advertising slogan, to said TV presenter, and this is supposedly a picture uploaded to reddit by the recipient.  Further, there are a few diehard gullibles in the comments section fervently denying that this isn't some form of corporate guerrilla marketing cooked up by internet-savvy marketers, but seemingly are contending that some random redditor would be lame enough to bother to spend lots of cash actually creating such a witless joke. I mean, sure, it is possible, but this is a pretty high-effort attempt at reddit witlessness."
AdPorn,2ywp2p,Aspel,5,Fri Mar 13 19:13:06 2015 UTC,Wasn't mailed to him. The Twitter account that posted it was a parody account. @JeremyDarkson

AdPorn,2ywp2p,Aspel,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought the punching thing was another issue, and that this time he had said something racist again.  Also, are you denying what some Redditors would do for Karma? Taking a box of Snickers, writing a fake mailing label on it, and taking a picture is a good way to get Karma."
AdPorn,2ywp2p,AimHere,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:18:35 2015 UTC,"If this was a genuine attempt at karma, I'd expect the joke to at least resemble a normal person's idea of something funny, or at least look reasonably related to the subject matter. Be honest. Would you even chuckle at this? Can you imagine anyone in your friends and family laughing at this? Would the Clarkson incident ever remind you of the chocolate bar slogan, or vice versa?  Sure, redditors can be an awfully witless bunch at times, but a brazen advertising slogan + product placement shot without anything else to recommend it strikes me as much more likely to be a guerrilla ad than a karma grab. And in order to make this happen, someone had to go out and either buy a shedload of Snickers bars, or find an empty retailer pack of them, neither of which are trivial. Given how much effort had to be put in for so forced and feeble a joke, I'm going with the marketing ploy, where at least there was a sane motivation for all this."
AdPorn,2ywp2p,Aspel,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"I did chuckle at this. And it seems exactly like the kind of thing that Redditors do. I'm even surprised you don't. And, yeah, the Clarkson thing does kind of fit with Snicker's slogan, since he punched a guy over steak.  A mocking reference to a pop culture ad? Yeah. I mean, I saw a Geico reference in another thread.  Also you seem to think that a Redditor wouldn't have a big box of Snickers...  Like, I honestly don't see any reason to think this was an official thing. I also don't entirely see why I should care whether or not it was or wasn't in the first place. I mean, Taco Bell or Oreos' silly tweets often end up on Reddit."

The whole debate was over perceptual color and the knowledge that The Fucking Dress should have in fact been black and blue, not over actual pixel values recorded by the camera sensor -- which were definitively not black/blue.

The fact that they have removed anti-gay comments comes across as trying to point out that  it isn't their stance.  It looks like many members of salvation army are homophobes but that it isn't the organisation's agenda."

AdPorn,2y4s8w,auandi,18,Sat Mar 7 01:09:42 2015 UTC,"From Huffington Post — The Salvation Army continues to remove links from its website to religious ministries providing so-called ""ex-gay"" conversion therapy, such as Harvest USA and Pure Life Ministries. These links were previously provided as resources under the Salvation Army's section on dealing with ""sexual addictions.""  ""Without discrimination"" -- myth or fact? The Salvation Army has recently attempted to counter this perception of the church as homophobic, scrubbing explicitly anti-gay statements from its websites and issuing missives purportedly ""debunking"" the ""myth"" of its anti-LGBT stances.  Yet these efforts at cleaning up their image still fail to address the most substantial criticisms of the church's policies. The Salvation Army states that numerous clients at its soup kitchens and homeless shelters are members of the LGBT community, and that these individuals are served without discrimination. They further add: ""The Salvation Army embraces employees of many different faiths and orientations and abides by all applicable anti-discrimination laws in its hiring.""  These statements completely ignore the reality that the Salvation Army continues to maintain anti-gay theological stances, and continues to discriminate against its own employees and their partners. They also neglect to mention that the organization historically ""abides"" by anti-discrimination laws by way of shutting down services in areas where such laws apply. The Salvation Army has given no indication that it intends to change any of these anti-LGBT policies.  tl;dr: That's like, cool and stuff that on an individual level some ministries aren't being bigoted but the fact remains that the organization's behaviors continue to contradict their public efforts to wipe clean their anti-LGBTQ image."

Why do we need to pull down and write off one group of people's attempt to effect positive change in an important aspect of their country by instantly accusing them of being hypocrites for not also speaking out against something else bad that's going on in their country?  I admittedly don't know all that much about the King Khalid Foundation other than that it's a prominent education and social development charity (maybe you know more and can provide some information to back up your comment), but it seems an unfair characterization to say that the KKF endorses and/or is a part of Saudi Arabia's participation in slavery just because they're Saudi Arabian. Maybe the KKF is just as opposed to that problem as it is to women's abuse, even though it's chosen for the time being to focus on the latter."

I really don't care to give more information, as so much is available to you online, because I don't like thinking about that world, that lifestyle, everything about that region. Unless you spend some time there as a resident you'll never have a full understanding of how little these servants have and the narrowness of their world and their non-existant rights.

AdPorn,2xmpn2,WhiskeySeven,2,Mon Mar 2 05:42:49 2015 UTC,"Optimist: it's more of an academic activity than a serious endeavour. An attempt at seeing how such an ad would be taken by the general public, the meta-nature of such forms of public advertisements, etc.   Pessimist: it's shallow pandering to the deluded west. Saudi Arabia does a lot to look like they're ""trying"" to change things but the very same young-ish people who are the ""next"" generation are the ones with slave servants and such extremely ingrained chauvinism that it would give them an aneurysm to learn the world works differently than they know. Domestic abuse is an external problem, it only exists if you posit that both man and wife are equal - otherwise it's a patriarchy and if you don't listen to the bossman you get reprimanded. And It sure is a patriarchy there.  Now, I'm sure many husbands don't beat their wives - but I'm also sure their entire notion of marriage and partner roles would nearly automatically constitute as abuse in any western nation.  Just like the so-called Arab Spring was a sham and subverted by truly terrible people (Libiya, Egypt, Syria - the attempts in Bahrain (funded and armedb y Saudis) that ended in unknown amount bloodshed) but the west kept parroting great it is - this is another similar situation.   Domestic violence is the least of their problems, this is more to get ""silly white folks"" to keep thinking Saudi's worth having as an ally."
AdPorn,2xmpn2,robertgentel,4,Mon Mar 2 05:49:11 2015 UTC,"Not everyone with a full time servant engages in abuse of said servant. Despite how prevalent this is in such societies the point stands, you are treating entire swaths of people as monolithic and morally bankrupt entities."
AdPorn,2xmpn2,WhiskeySeven,2,Mon Mar 2 05:52:45 2015 UTC,The simple fact that servants don't have their passports or bank accounts under their own control is abuse enough. And yes literally every family takes their servant's passport away.  Open your eyes - slavery hasn't ended. How would you like it if your people were enslaved by barbarians?
AdPorn,2xmpn2,manwithfaceofbird,4,Mon Mar 2 06:06:27 2015 UTC,"Not all servants don't have passports etc, though this is certainly very common. As for ""opening my eyes"" I suggest you consider that this might just be a condescending way to dismiss points of view that may be as informed as yours while remaining in disagreement about an opinion you hold. I do not dispute that the labor conditions for most servants are abysmal, but once again this is not a reasonable basis upon which to cast aspersions on the morality of an entire people, not even an entire subset of people with servants. In any case, given that you've devolved into calling them ""barbarians"" I don't suspect there is any profit in this exchange and we'll probably have to agree to disagree."
AdPorn,2xmpn2,robertgentel,2,Mon Mar 2 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"Almost every servant has their passport taken. The services that acquire them encourage and heavily suggest their employers (owners) to do so as the risk of a servant (slave) running away is high, they are the responsibility (property) of the employer (owner).  I think a lot of things about that region are barbaric - case in point 50% of worldnews at anyway will be directly related to problems perpetuated or funded by the gulf nations - especially Saudi and Qatar.   I do not believe in black and white, but I take solace knowing that my DISGUST for how they treat each other, children, women, the environment, animals and even esoteric concepts like religion and philosophy put me on the right side of history and the right side of human progress.  So keep astroturfing if you want. I'm not silly enough to think that every single person in Saudi is a monster, I know there must be decent folks - but they're but a drop in the bucket."

A good movie on Youtube is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetwise_%281984_film%29 about real homeless teenagers.  A lot of homeless people choose to live  rough (meaning not in hostels or shelters) for various reasons.  The shelters have more rules governing behavior (like limitation on drinking and drug use).  Shelters can be unsafe, especially if you're a homeless teen.  Shelters can be disgusting.  Government benefits are not available to everyone for an unlimited amount of time.  If you're living in a 'homeless shelter' you're still counted as 'homeless'.  The shelter may be full by the time that you get there and you don't have transportation to travel to a place with an available bed.  All of the shelters may be full.  Many homeless people are mentally ill and have conflicts with the other people at the homeless shelters.   Even if you get a check from the government, it may not be enough to pay for available housing, you need cash equal to two months rent to get a lease.  The landlord may refuse to rent to you.  It is common to spend government benefits on cigarettes, booze, drugs etc.."

The US loooooooves putting people in jail (absurd/sad stats), but god help you if you advocate infringing on American rights.     We view homelessness, odd as it may sound, as a right. Who are we to tell you that you must live with a roof over your head? Being crazy and in public isn't against the law. It's only when you start becoming a problem (visually, physically, violently) where it becomes a legal issue. (that last sentence is quite a gray area)    Local goverment often takes it upon itself to interpret that gray area. A good example might be the San Francisco's Sit/Lie Ordinance, which prohibits sitting or lying on the sidewalk or other public space; a thinly-veiled attack on the local homeless population. Then again, the goal behind this ordinance is not so much as to arrest these people to get them off the streets, but to get them to move on to other areas and get them off these particular streets. While helping to solve SF's ""homelessness issue"", this ordinance doesn't help anything on the macro level, as it really just passes the buck off onto neighboring regions.    The U.S. is a funny place. We're, uh... working on it."

Yes. But then again, it is the government's responsability to do a lot of things they don't.  And I'm not sure I can blame them (not entirely at least, since I do blame them a lot). Taxpayer money is a limited resource, so they do have to prioritize. Between keeping one hospital in each city or a shelter in each city, many would prioritize the hospital, and use the remaining money to build shelters.   if they refuse to attend a shelter, shouldn't they be put in jail?   Isn't that kind of like saying 'if they refuse to be put in jail, shouldn't they be put in jail'?  I mean, a 'shelter' where you have no choice but to attend to sounds like jail by another name to me."
AdPorn,2x28ey,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,2,Wed Feb 25 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"Mental illness can be a big part of it in a lot of cases. People who struggle with severe mental illnesses like Schizophrenia tend to have a very hard time trusting and navigating the often complex bureaucracy required to get government benefits, even assuming that those benefits are actually enough to keep them off of the streets.  I live in Utah in the US, which is a state that has been making strides in reducing chronic homelessness by basically giving homeless people apartments with no strings attached. It's been amazingly effective and has actually saved the government a lot of money, but even the people who work for the program recognize that they probably can't reduce chronic homelessness in the state to 0, because there are so many severely mentally ill homeless that will fall through the cracks regardless."

There was a Florida law against T-backs for awhile, not sure what became of that - in Miami Beach I believe it was handled just like the laws against topless sunbathing: reliably ignored by the local police, to the point that young girls would taunt old women who told them to put their tops on, I'm sure more than one old woman complained to the cops - never heard of anything happening to the topless.

They don't use proper safe words, and he doesn't check in to make sure he isn't going too far. And the woman just takes it because he's rich and handsome. They even treat his kinky desires as a symptom of trauma, a sign that he's ""damaged"" and that it's something to be ""fixed.""

AdPorn,2sm8wb,davidcu96,11,Fri Apr 3 02:10:00 2015 UTC,"Marketer here! One of the main goals of good marketing is message awareness. At some point down the line, there will be an action item like ""buy this product"" or ""do this thing."" Before that can be effective though, the audience needs to know why they're buying the product or doing the thing. This ad gets that ball rolling. It introduces the audience to a concept and makes an emotional case to get the audience on the side of the marketer. After seeing this, you know that a. Honor killings are a thing that happens and b. They are terrible. You might not necessarily know what they are or why or where they happen, but that's okay.   The hope here is that next time you hear about honor killings, or even if you decide to learn more on your own, you will know that they exist and think that they are bad. Is this a hard thing to do? No. However, it transforms the concept of honor killings from ""something I read about that happens to other people"" to ""that horrifying picture of the girl in the plastic bag.""  The practical power of this ad doesn't come from an immediate call to action. Rather, it ensures that if you are ever in a place to do something about an honor killing (read: give money to an organization that works to end them) you will have a strong emotional point of reference and be more inclined to take meaningful action."
AdPorn,2sm8wb,ciociosanvstar,2,Sat Jan 17 05:34:57 2015 UTC,"I agree.. To be honest, the topics that are already serious and emotional are like easy mode for creating an impression in the first place. So even the ones with a goal, that are horrifically morbid, can be appreciated in terms of advertising skill/thought, but only after acknowledging that I probably would've had some sort of emotion conjured up even without imagery or dramatic headlines. On top of that, not having a goal really makes it not advertising.  In this case, it's surely about an article inside.  From a marketing perspective overall, I think this is a 10/10 though. Cosmo could use some publicity for covering a serious issue. Of course a serious issue that hits home the most with its potential readers. I can't see cosmo going to serious route as a magazine, but tossing in an article on something important once in a while could give people justification to read it. Especially since their #1 hindrance is probably that people dismiss cosmo as absurd, potentially sexist tripe, and sometimes criticize others just for saying they read it."

AdPorn,2rw03k,snarkhunter,12,Sat Jan 10 03:49:11 2015 UTC,You jumbled up the pixels. You need to very carefully split your monitor lengthways. Use your sharpest kitchen knife. Don't worry if some monitor-blood leaks out you'll just have to let it rest longer. After you do that you just have to push the pixels back in from the other side. Clamp the two sides together for at least 24 hours (36 or more depending on if it lost any blood) making sure to keep the screen well-lit at all times (it shouldn't matter whether it's off or on). Your monitor should be good as new!

Are you dense? Or are you just one of those people who like to get offended at everything?   Do you go bitch at people that use the word ""guys"" or ""dude"" or ""mankind""? Are you one of those insufferable nags that insists on using words like ""human kind"" when everybody already knew what the hell people using the word ""mankind"" meant?   Why the flying FUCK are you choosing to argue about this? Jesus Christ stop being such an asshole you annoying twat."
AdPorn,2r4ybd,sunlifter,3,Wed Jan 7 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"Riled is not the word I would use.   Annoyed would be one.   Astounded, would be another, that you felt this is worth talking about.   Contemptful, would be another, again, that you really think this is a topic worth anyone's time, let alone yours or mine.  The fact that you think I would be specifically talking to a specific subset of users on the distinction of gender, rather than on comprehension of the ad in question, is shocking to me, when any rational human being would understand that the point of the word ""fellas"" was to convey a specific, intentional tone, and not to carry out any sort of misogynistic agenda.   Answer a few questions, come to your own conclusion, rationally please, and then leave me quite alone thank you:  Do you really think I don't know women use the internet? I mean it's fairly obvious by the fact that I use reddit that I'm in a country with decent enough internet connectivity that even if for some reason my own country did not allow women access, I would've undoubtedly heard of a country that did allow them to, and realized that that was the case in most developed nations.  Do you think I think women don't use reddit? Or perhaps, just don't browse this subreddit? While reddit is overwhelmingly male in demographic, it should appear obvious that any user who has been on the site for more than a few minutes would know that it is not 100% male.  Do you think I intentionally only wanted to talk to the male members of this subreddit that read this particular post? That seems an odd conclusion, with no evidence or motive to support it.  So, if you have half a brain, which I sincerely hope you do, you should arrive at the logical conclusion that the word ""fellas"" was not used to discriminate against any member of reddit's userbase, and you, as I assume a woman, should work on not being offended by non-issues like this. I wonder, do you frequent Salon's website? You sound like someone who'd buy into that particular brand of drivel."
AdPorn,2r4ybd,SplintPunchbeef,2,Wed Jan 7 05:30:09 2015 UTC,"Every single question is ""restated"" was rhetorical because the obvious answer was ""No"".   No I don't think the internet is 100% male.   No I don't think Reddit is 100% male.  No I wasn't only speaking to men.   All three of those answers should have been blatantly obvious but you, for some reason, decided that the answer to the last question somehow could've been yes, which is absolutely ludicrous, absurd, and every other synonym for daft I can think of.  I don't get offended when someone addresses me as ""nigga"" or ""bitch"" or even ""girl"" even though I am none of the above because they're all used to express a very specific tone. A tone which no one else seemed to have trouble grasping.  Speaking to a crowd where you can see who is receiving your words is very different than speaking anonymously to the internet, when the person reading it could be anything from straight white male to transgender mixed raced pansexual unicorn. I don't write to pander to every thinkable person who might read my comments, I write the way I speak. I swear, I make jokes, I write the way I would talk to any group of people.   The fact that you're pointing this out really speaks more about your personality than mine. Learn to not be so sensitive about non-issues, nobody likes that person."

Or that GOT was written on a PC. That's not the point. The ad dramatises the fact that a Bic can will last for a really long time. That's pretty clear when you look at the ad itself.

AdPorn,2pvx5t,talldrinkofbaileys,18,Sat Dec 20 17:35:19 2014 UTC,It's a Slovak company for outdoor advertising: http://www.euroawk.sk/english I think they manage billboards in Slovakia.

The color/shape of the pill is recognizable to adults (the target audience) yet when you first look at the ad it just looks like a mountain. The ad maintains modesty and refrains from throwing sexuality in your face which is something the Egyptian consumer wouldn't respond to."
AdPorn,2pqhv0,careoweline,6,Fri Dec 19 04:05:49 2014 UTC,"The ad maintains modesty and refrains from throwing sexuality in your face   Uh, not too sure about that.  Have a look at this actual Viagra print ad and tell me you still believe the one posted is ""modest"" for the category."
AdPorn,2pqhv0,Ouroboros_87,3,Fri Dec 19 14:09:59 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but I was reffering to modesty as Egyptians would see it culturally. A couple openly embracing just isnt the type of thing that is acceptable in Egyptian culture.  So yes, in this instance, the ad in the photo is more modest."
AdPorn,2pqhv0,careoweline,5,Fri Dec 19 17:20:29 2014 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but I find it hard to believe a couple embracing is more shocking to the Egyptian culture than a thinly veiled erection.  If two people holding hands is bad, a full-on erection has got to be worse."
AdPorn,2pqhv0,Ouroboros_87,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:41:07 2014 UTC,"I liked it because the ad doesn't even explicitly look like an erection. Yes there is obvious implication, but the mountain could be seen as more of a representation/symbol of what the ad is saying. Americans tend to see an ad and imagine the parts of the ad that are hidden away as they would be there in reality. This would cause Americans to feel as if there is an actual penis in the ad due to the implication, but I don't think an Egyptian would see it that way. They would make the association between the mountain shape and bedsheet textures and take away the implicit meaning without feeling as if the ad explicitly offended them."

If anything breaks on it expect to drop 3x the normal price of any other import to replace parts.  I lost my keys and the way the car was designed was you had to completely replace the entire alarm system to get a new set of keys.
AdPorn,2pdv4b,LsDmT,8,Mon Dec 15 21:54:25 2014 UTC,What in the actual fuck. For a new key?
AdPorn,2pdv4b,Bombingofdresden,5,Mon Dec 15 23:01:02 2014 UTC,Yep - this is how it works... Also had a Saab 9-3 and ended up dropping WAY too much for a new alarm system. Enjoyable/safe to drive however god help you if something breaks.
AdPorn,2pdv4b,folkhack,4,Tue Dec 16 00:00:24 2014 UTC,"It's married to the central locking system and immobilizer through RFID. But this is pretty common in newer luxury cars nowadays.   expect to drop 3x the normal price of any other import to replace parts.   This however isn't true 95% of the time. If you were dumb enough to buy parts through the dealership, then that's probably the case, but they don't call them stealerships for nothing. Because Saab was a GM subsidiary by 2000, they had the luxury of pulling from the GM parts bins a lot. So, prices for most things are pretty reasonable. Heck, they've actually dropped for several parts in the last few years."
AdPorn,2pdv4b,gear9242,3,Tue Dec 16 09:58:45 2014 UTC,"Wow. I love my 2006 9-3! When we bought the car, the salesman warned us about the expense ($1000+) of replacing the keys--if we lost BOTH keys. Losing one key just meant you had to get a copy made (I think he said it would be about $400). The car is still running perfectly for us. No major expenses other than the expected maintenance costs. It's been a great car.  Now our 2002 9-3 is a different story: some idiot mechanic stripped a bolt while trying to replace the alternator, and we ended up having to have the entire frame dropped out of the car to fix it."

Also, I don't like aligning things (note how they align the chains of member calls on the period). In such a case, I would use either one or two levels of indentation (depending on conventions at the company)."
AdPorn,2n6qy0,the_omega99,0,Sun Nov 23 20:22:07 2014 UTC,The magic strings and variable names annoyed me more than the spacing.
AdPorn,2n6qy0,sp106,7,Sun Nov 23 20:23:56 2014 UTC,"What do you mean by ""magic strings""? If you mean the way they use strings directly instead of, say, an I18N lookup, that's presumably because doing so would make the poster too hard to read for even those who know code (because they wouldn't invest time to read it). Not to mention I18N strings would certainly be in their own file.  As for the variable names, I'd consider those good names. The ""builder"" in mailBuilder makes it clear that we're using the builder pattern (which we obviously are and is very common in creating messages -- not just email, XMPP usually uses the builder pattern too).  It's considered good practice to put complex conditionals into boolean variables so that the purpose of if-statements is clearer. So javaDeveloper might be defined elsewhere as some complicated equation but thanks to the readable name, we can determine what exactly this if-statement is checking for. It's also more efficient if we have to use the same conditional in multiple places."
AdPorn,2n6qy0,the_omega99,0,Sun Nov 23 20:52:44 2014 UTC,"This is from the standpoint of proper java style and developing large scale applications. It's a job ad, I wouldn't want to apply to a company that would put something looking like this into production.  mailBuilder isn't a variable name here because it isn't instantiated here. When saying variable names, I was saying searchingJob and javaDeveloper- these are extremely vague. Without the given context of knowing that this is a job ad, they could be interpreted multiple ways.   Also proper java style is to have these accessed through getters stored on some object, and with methods named as isX.  user.isJavaDeveloper() user.isSearchingForJob() would be obvious improvements.  Magic strings are like magic numbers- instead of creating a defined variable for the string, they're sent as literals. This makes maintenance more difficult for other developers.   eg  ((at the top of the class))  private static final int height = 5;  ((the rest of the body))  setHeight(height);   is superior to   setHeight(5);   where 5 is a magic number, someone else picking up your program has to figure out what asshole you pulled the 5 out of. It also helps prevent problems caused by fat fingers."
AdPorn,2n6qy0,sp106,6,Sun Nov 23 21:20:20 2014 UTC,"You're right. But we can't always create methods and fields for variables. It's quite practical to create a local variable (which wouldn't be visible because the ad only shows a snippet of code and not an entire method). For example, perhaps the whole method looks like:  public void jobFind(Person person) {     Job job = person.getJob();     boolean javaDeveloper = job.isProgrammer() &&             person.languages().contains(""java"");     boolean searchingJob = !job.isEmployed() && job.desiresEmployment() &&             this.closeToUs(person.getLocation(), new Kilometer(100));     MailBuilder mailBuilder = AbstractFactoryFactory.getFactory()             .getAbstractFactory().getFactory().getMailBuilder();      if         (javaDeveloper && searchingJob)      {         mailBuilder.create()                    .addRecipient     (“jobs-cz@mgm-tp.com“)                    .addAttachment       (“my-cv.pdf“)                    .send() ;     } }   I tried to mimic their use of whitespace so that it's obvious that the snippet in the ad comes from this code. Of course, those funny quotes will cause a syntax error, but I think the spirit of the code is kept intact.  As an aside, it's not necessary to follow language conventions provided that you can maintain some alternative convention within your project. For example, getters and setters are often considered overly verbose. They aren't necessary if you don't need to restrict access to a field, aren't concerned about future changes, and don't need to override access to that field (since you cannot override access to a field but can override getters and setters).  One convention I've seen that replaces the traditional style of getters and setters is simply having methods foo() to get and foo(SomeType) to set.  Scala (a Java derivative) does it even better by automatically creating functions to access fields and using operator overloading to allow assigning to that field (when you assign to a field, foo, you're actually calling method foo_=(SomeType))."

KitKat's slogan isn't famous enough for this to work, because too much thought would go into remembering that slogan is tied to KitKat and not, say, Snickers.

AdPorn,2mh3eo,TDAM,10,Sun Nov 16 19:01:12 2014 UTC,"You're right. If you glance at the ad you'll think it's an Audi ad (or BMW, Mercedes), so if glancing is all you do it might actually benefit Audi a little.   However, you might be intrigued as well, checking what's it about. Seeing JAG as a payoff will make you think. What they are doing is position it as an alternative. If you're in the market for, let's say an Audi, you will most likely be more receptive for Audi ads as well. What this ad is saying: wait a minute .. you might not have considered a JAG and you might make a mistake not doing so. At least think a second about it.  Might work, I like it."

AdPorn,2mh3eo,willdowellinlife,1 point,Sun Nov 16 20:18:58 2014 UTC,"Hey!   I have something to add to that.  Does a layman (let's say anyone who is not a car enthusiast) see the difference between the two premium cars - Jaguar and Audi?  A brand such as Jaguar doesn't need to sell its features now. It is an old premium brand which has made its brand. So, I think the strategy behind this Ad is - ""Define Luxurious Experience"".   I think how this Ad makes an impact will depend on largely on its vehicle (where it is printed) and the quality of readership - are they curious in general?   Having said that, this Ad automatically leads me to ask ""Hey! What car is this which I can devour......(in the background - doughnuts....yummy doughnuts...). However, as a non-car enthusiast, I will forget the brand name and remember the experience. Unless, of course, I meet friends later who mention the Ad.   Conclusion: Might or might not place the Brand in Consumer's head but will the experience will stay with him until he can afford it."

I'm used to Pepsi and Coke taking shots at one another, and even Ford and Chevy. But I wouldn't have pegged Jaguar as a natural rival to Audi."
