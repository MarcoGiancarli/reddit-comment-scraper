Remember when sub used to be active you could see many people doing something amazing: flying to the smenus, smars back and etc. After docking update everything changed there was tons of new agencies but with time they stopped doing anything, slowly players stopped posting missions too everything became silent just some help posts and etc well rarely someon posted missions. Everything remained like that untill last beta when andrew announced steam greenlight and started beta. Everyone started posting some missions, even community started sandbox mode together built an space station around smupiter but that didin't last long they stopped doing it and once again sub became text only.   let's bring community back like it was back in 2013!"

simplerockets,3d4cej,danielbritton,3,Mon Jul 13 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"This is my understanding, if at your current orbit your closest encounter is more than a full orbit away, the encounter node disappears. Turn on fast forward and wait a bit and it should reappear."
simplerockets,3d4cej,KevinStauffer,3,Mon Jul 13 13:37:23 2015 UTC,Sometimes it seems to disappear when an encounter looks possible. I have been struggling to create an encounter with mars and creating one with a satellite is nearly impossible...
simplerockets,3d4cej,KevinStauffer,3,Mon Jul 13 14:26:15 2015 UTC,"For a satellite I generally recommend getting within about 1,000 to 3,000 meters depending on how close your orbit matches (the closer your orbit matches, the less adjustment necessary). Then zoom out and find the satellite, turn on your RCS, and use RCS and engines to match speed, direction, and meet up with the satellite. In other words it's not necessary to create an ""encounter"" when meeting up with a satellite.  Meeting a planet is similar. The closer your orbit matches the less adjustment necessary when you get within its SOI. Keep in mind that inside the planet's orbit, you are moving around the sun faster than the planet. Visa versa outside of the planet's orbit, it is moving around the sun faster than you. If the encounter node disappears, you can often keep burning and it will reappear in a different spot. If not, turn off the engines, fast forward, wait until you get close to the planet and make small adjustments as necessary."

But a wormhole is just theoretical, and I think none have been discovered. Even if wormholes weren't sciFi, modding ""teleportation"" is impossible, and I don't think it'll ever happen on SR."
simplerockets,3ck0z0,Sammy197,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:12:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on how deep you want to go into theoretical physics. I've heard it argued that the best way to make general relativity and quantum mechanics coincide is if quantum entanglement is the result of a wormhole connecting the two entangled particles. By that argument, we have in fact found unconfirmed wormholes in real life.  I'm sure Andrew would never put wormholes in the real game because it makes it unrealistic, and the whole idea of the game is to keep it realistic. However, as a possible mod capability? That's the best realistic way I can think of to make the game bigger, I.E. interstellar travel within time frames that aren't unimaginably long.  Speaking of which, do mods currently exist that give you multiple solar systems to play with? And if so, how does that work? Is it possible to travel between them in open space?"
simplerockets,3ck0z0,Sammy197,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:39:50 2015 UTC,"I believe it's called Grand Extension Interstellar. The mod adds a black hole, with about 4 stars orbiting it, including the sun. However there is a problem with interstellar travel in this game; because at full warp speed, it still takes ages to get from one star to another, and Andrew mentioned that he didn't really want to mess around with warp physics. This is even a problem with the vanilla game, because getting to places like smalley's comet, or Smeptune takes quite a while."
simplerockets,3ck0z0,Sammy197,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:24:37 2015 UTC,So the only way to get to another star is through the open space between them? At full warp how bad is that?  Smalley's isn't too bad. My video is only 25 minutes. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-r_fSQDZVDc

simplerockets,3cjq72,SRshipbot,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:47 2015 UTC,The trick to landing a very heavy payload on Mars is to land it like an aircraft. Using the grand extension mod I was able to land an 80 tonne return vehicle (Lander and return vehicle combined weight of 130 tonnes. No joke.  Had to launch it from the moon. It was crazy) but you may be able to do a smaller craft without it. Build your lander so the parachutes are on the trailing edge and the rockets  point downward. Enter atmo shallow keeping a level decent. Don't deploy any parachutes unless you need a drag cute for stability and if so jet it before 3500m. Aim for a pariopsis of 500m or so. At this point you should be going about 1400m/s and heading back into orbit. Deploy your parachutes in stages (so you don't tear the ship in half) and fire up the rockets just enough to maintain your altitude. As your speed drops steadily shed altitude till about 100m. At about 300m/s your parachutes start to lose their effectiveness. Use small retro rockets or pitch the nose up to drop below 100m/s while continuing to steadily drop altitude. Level off and gently set her down on some big tires. Use the nav computer to keep her level and keep the rockets burning just enough to float a little as you bounce over the uneven terrain. Good luck.

simplerockets,3ci5ug,SpartanReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:57:48 2015 UTC,Fuel tanks merge only when they're attached on the ends. When your attaching the fuel tanks together be sure the little box on the end turns yellow indicating an attachment point. One of the fuel tanks in line with the engine that's curing out is attached at the side rather than at the end.

simplerockets,3cht83,Jimmyjimjr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:30:01 2015 UTC,"Here's a tutorial that helped me. The simplest way (for Low Smearth Orbit) is to plan your launches so that it's within a window that will put you straight into an encounter, rather than orbit first and then try to get an encounter. Also, you might try practicing in orbit around Smoon first. Low gravity and no atmosphere make it very easy to launch from, that's where I finally nailed down satellite encounters."

simplerockets,3caqh7,Faris_rulez,3,Mon Jul 6 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"If all of the ""A-"" satellites are in the exact same orbit then they will never collide. Undoubtedly there are small variations so the chance is there, but it's so miniscule that you could probably run the sandbox for hours or even days at 2,500,000x Warp and never get a hit. In the words of Douglas Adams, ""Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.""  Just take a look at some of the visualizations of earth that include satellites and space debris. It looks crowded but in reality there is a great deal of space between everything. Space debris is a real concern, but even so in the past 50+ years of orbital flight there have been only a handful of high speed (i.e. non-maneuver/docking related) collisions; Wikipedia lists only 4."
simplerockets,3caqh7,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Mon Jul 6 14:52:20 2015 UTC,Well actually what I meant was when I'm launching from ground to space it might collide with one of the satellite. All of the orbiting satellites in the image are in prograde circular orbit so they wont ever collide with each other (at least in SR where it uses only 2-body problem as simulation).

simplerockets,3caqh7,MadMatter0,2,Mon Jul 6 16:01:08 2015 UTC,Haha yeah. I put struts horizontally so that it will sweep bigger area in hopes that it will hit the satellite. Didn't work.

simplerockets,3c6l66,LP40,2,Sun Jul 5 16:40:56 2015 UTC,Yes. Go into orbit and them deorbit your rocket. If you were going fast enough into a planet without an atmosphere (like mercury) the struts will get destroyed.
simplerockets,3c6l66,Sammy197,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:55:56 2015 UTC,What speed were you going at?

simplerockets,3c6l66,Peanutct,3,Sun Jul 5 12:08:13 2015 UTC,"No, it's necessary."
simplerockets,3c5z0a,zgoldberg,3,Sun Jul 5 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"Alright so it's all about connection points. Rockets with an odd number of fuel tanks in width are ideal because they give you a single unobstructed line down the center of your rocket around which to build. You want your connections to look something like this (Note: Green=attached, Red=directly adjacent but not attached). This kind of construction is less bulky (no struts) but by keeping the stages directly adjacent to each other while remaining unattached you give your rocket more stability. Just be careful when you build as the tanks from the lower stages will try to attach to the engine above rather than the tanks to the left and right like they need to be. Hope this helps!"
simplerockets,3c5z0a,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Mon Jul 6 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  That makes perfect sense, and for a stage 5 tanks wide it works great.  But at more than 5 the ""ends"", if you will, begin to deviate from the center rocket as a unit.  I tried to solve this by having another ""vertical attachment"" (instead of a side attachment) and that works, sometimes, but doesn't seem to scale in all cases.  I've seen some rockets on here ~19 tanks wide using some variation of the technique we're discussing, I must just be missing some minor detail!"
simplerockets,3c5z0a,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Mon Jul 6 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"My pleasure, I hope it helps! Those extra wide rockets might be fun to build or fly but in terms of practicality the 19 tanks aren't necessary. I'd play around with your designs a bit using the method I described above or even try out your own techniques, the struts were a novel solution (if not the best one). You should be able to construct a rocket with enough Δv to make it anywhere in the Smolar System. For instance the rocket I used in my picture has about 6,000 m/s less Δv than yours but it'll take you just about anywhere you need to go (albeit on an ion engine for the probe, chemical rocket exploration of the outer planets necessarily will require more Δv)."
simplerockets,3c5z0a,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Mon Jul 6 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mostly this was an exercise in sillyness, but that's the point, right?  My challenge was chemical only (ion really feels like cheating) to get anywhere in smolar and preferably without the solid rocket boosters (man those things cause trouble with bigger rockets -- we need stronger detachers).   It's simply maddening to work on the strutless design though, accidentally click anywhere on the screen and you may reattach a random tank the wrong way and break the whole design!  I've actually just recently downloaded my own design file as XML and am contemplating doing the editing by hand to ensure the attachment points are what I meant.  Iteration speed will be slow though... maybe I should close the phone and go outside..."
simplerockets,3c5z0a,andrewgarrison,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:39:40 2015 UTC,"maybe I should close the phone and go outside...   Outside? What's that? hahaha yeah it can be a pain to ensure the correct attachment points (the mirror and copy tools are helpful but even still). If you're goal is all chemical, go for some Sloshy T6000s (or any tank really) but with Tiny 21 engines. The Tiny 21 may be less powerful but they are around 1.5 times more efficient than the other engines. You'll get more bang for your buck once your craft is in the Sun's SoI where a longer, but more efficient burn is preferable."

If you place enough of them to weigh down the cockpits ability to float, the whole thing will sink and you will slowly go to the bottom of the ocean.

simplerockets,3blm42,LP40,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:29:16 2015 UTC,"So far it isn't even close to being done, but it just turned semi-functional.  The way I put sections onto the station is in my opinion fairly unique. I don't put any RCS nozzles on the new sections I want to add. Instead I move the new section about 1000m from the station. Then I undock a reusable space craft I call the space tug. I Then dock the space tug to the new section and then move the new section to the space Station using the space tug.  I mainly do this because its a ton of fun parking things in space and moving it back to the station. The only bad thing is that my station is crooked because of constant Kraken attacks :(  The way I deliver fuel to the station is similar in the fact that I do park the fuel tanks 1000m away. But instead of getting the space tug I get these other space craft (there are currently 2 at the station) and move them to the fuel. The spacecrafts are designed so that the fuel tanks can fit perfectly inside them so I do just that. I then move the tanks back to the station and literally stack them onto each other. You can see this being done at the top right of the picture.  This is actually my first space station I made in the 2 years I've been playing SR. It is alot of fun. My hope is that I can make every section serve an actual purpose.  But the real reason I made this is to help refuel my Single Stage to orbit rockets (SSTO) and attempt to land one from orbit on a barge..."

simplerockets,3bk0y6,Jimmyjimjr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's best to try to land on Smars on the top of the planet. Bring your orbit down to a landing trajectory. Keep your heading LOCKED until you're at 5,000m from Mars, then activate the parachutes. It's important to remember to take off LOCK HEADING at 5,000m. Once parachutes deploy at 3,500m, wait until you're at 1,500m then drop the heat shield. All this should have been done without your heading being locked. If you think your parachutes aren't shedding enough speed, activate the retro rockets at 50%. (I usually leave the parachutes to do all the slowing down until I'm at 80m/s.) The retro rockets and the parachutes will automatically readjust the spacecraft to an upright position so you don't waste RCS. Now that you're dropping at 80m/s, disconnect the parachutes and go down on the surface on only the retro rockets. The spacecraft should be upright now. If not, lock your heading and use RCS. Bring the spacecraft to 20m/s and slow it down. Once you're dropping at a safe, slow and steady pace, wait until you're a split second before touchdown then power up the retro rockets to 90%-100% making sure you're only 3m from the surface and disconnect the sky crane and UNLOCK HEADING. If it was all done correctly, your rover is now on the ground, RCS isn't tilting the rover due to it being locked and the sky crane should fly away and your parachutes nowhere close to your rover. Happy exploring!  TL;DR   Lock heading until 5,000m, unlock heading and activate parachutes.  Parachutes open at 3,500m, wait until 1,500m then drop heat shield.  Once dropping at a speed of 80m/s, disconnect parachutes and only descend using retro rockets, lock heading to upright position.  Once close to touchdown (about 3m), fire the retro rockets to 90%-100% and simultaneously disconnect the rover from sky crane and unlock heading.  Explore Smars."

I've had spacecraft flung out by the Smoon from highly elliptical orbits around Smearth in just a single encounter. If OP left the probe orbiting Smaturn and then warped it could have easily been getting nudge after nudge after nudge until its trajectory brought it out of Smaturn's SoI. I imagine the same thing could send it out of the Smolar System, though it admittedly seems unlikely.  That or OP's right and it's bug."

simplerockets,3a2ydu,RCalabraro,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:55:48 2015 UTC,Here's my tutorial for getting to Io.   http://imgur.com/a/mkiZi  Go to Mars the same way except you parachute into Smars and slow down to no more than about 500m/s before you reach 3500m. the chutes will completely open. Make sure you're your chutes are open when you reach that altitude. Then wait until you almost touch down and use your rockets to slow below 10m/s before you hit the ground.

simplerockets,39t0tg,Faris_rulez,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"Could work. But if you try to maintain maximum limit of 10G (around 100m/s2 ) and not exceeding that, it will take you around 40 seconds to gain 4km/s, assuming the rope does incredible well at maintaining constant tension. But that will need around 80km of rope. Not sure what density and dimension the rope will be, but might have less complication swapping the rope with rocket fuel."

simplerockets,39qq20,Faris_rulez,2,Sat Jun 13 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"Backstory (skippable): You, an astronaut sent from your home planet, where the dying Sun forces mankind to seek for a new exoplanet to sustain humanity. ‘Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.’, they said. You enter cryogenic hibernation after being sent out to a solar system light years away. It took years to reach there, even if the latest technology of warping through space.  Once there, you and your co-astronauts leave hibernation and observe a beautiful, big, blue planet. This is what they have been saying. The Gliese 832 c. You started taking readings and analysis before getting into an orbit around it. Your landing vehicle, Spirit, docked to the cargo station, Endurance, which carries food supply, space farm, labs and all the essentials for colonization, makes a final check-up before departing for a surface analysis mission. Upon departure from the station - explosions. Though you can’t hear the sound, shock can be felt in Spirit and some of the debris hit your hull. Part of Endurance was ruptured. What was it? Frozen shut-off valve? Liquid gas tank over pressured? ECS short circuit? Those do not matter now.  With all the question running through your mind, the hopeful planet below you, you analysed the damage on Endurance. It was a small blast, but large enough to send it off-course from the low orbit to a suborbital trajectory. You did not come this far to fail like this. The promising blue planet below you does not mean anything if the station crashes down. The station is the only hope for a colonization. You started up your engine and..  Your mission: Save Endurance from crashing down.  Hard mode: You fail if you go below 45km altitude.  Rules : 1. No pausing. Time is running out. Make decision now. 2. No warping to stop any rotation. 3. No mods allowed. Fuel transfer and switching ships are allowed.  I suspect there’s probably some grammar and factual errors but I did it just for fun. It’s highly inspired by the movie Interstellar, which is one of my favourite films of all time, so it’s not really original. Ever since sandbox files can be shared, I have always wanted to make a mission file like this. Post screenshots below on how you did it. Or even better, a video!

One is the explorer that will go do all the visiting, the other one is something like a mobile fuel station that will refuel your explorer but do less travelling (probably stay in some conventional parking orbits). This way you can have your explorer ship not immensely huge to contain all the fuels needed (because you can docked and refuel to the fuel station), and also you mobile fuel station doesn't need big, inefficient engines because it would do little maneuvering.

simplerockets,39p5h4,Sammy197,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"ok nevermind, the solar panels needed to recharge the battery fast enough become exponentially heavy.

simplerockets,39p5h4,Faris_rulez,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. 1 solar panel can recharge ~7/13 ion engines at 1 SMAU. It's even worse when it's really far like Smalley's Comet's apoapsis. Even with no command pod and no battery (disregarding structural components completely), 13 solar panels and 7 engines (which can fully sustain itself at 1SMAU), the weight on Smearth surface is ((13*500)+(7*250))*9.81 ~= 81000N is still higher compared to the thrust from the engine (7*8500) ~= 59500N. This is trying to launch with no batteries, command pods and struts, from a planet with gravity that isn't as high as Smupiter and solar power input as low as Smalley's Comet efficiency and it still cannot takes off. So I guess even though this thing have infinite delta-v, I'm glad at least it doesn't work on take-off.  Edit : formatting error"

simplerockets,39ms8j,AlaricV,2,Sat Jun 13 05:41:22 2015 UTC,No not really. The rocket's liquid engine stages are not enough to get you into stable orbit (out of the 70km atmostphere) so the last push into stable orbit has to be done using the ion engines. More boosters?

simplerockets,39c5dn,ColdDesert77,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:00:43 2015 UTC,The map view says yes you can orbit it. But I don't think it's worth it. Orbital velocity is really slow so you might as well just land your space station.

Like on smalley's comet, unlike the rest of the terrain, the top of the comet is entirely flat, which means that changing the min and max altitudes in order to create a planet COMPLETELY covered in water wouldn't work, because the spawnpoint remains solid and flat no matter what. Of course, the rest of the planet would be covered in water, there would only be like a little island at the top. /u/andrewgarrison"

simplerockets,39ai4z,RCalabraro,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:24:03 2015 UTC,Try getting into a orbit in front of your station. And then prograde burn in mapview until you have an encounter
simplerockets,39ai4z,GR00G0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"The closer your orbit looks like the target orbit, the less relative velocity you have. Just try to match up the orbit while getting an encounter then you can see the target station moves slowly by you, and use RCS thrusters to kill the relative velocity. Also, if you can get to the same orbit as the target orbit, then fuel shouldn't be a problem except you need a bit extra for phasing maneuver and docking.  Edit : added text"
simplerockets,39ai4z,Faris_rulez,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:47:12 2015 UTC,It looks to me at this point I'm going to need a stage that is literally a tanker carrying propellent to give me that extra advantage. The downsize to that is that I will need an extra stage to get me off the ground.
simplerockets,39ai4z,Faris_rulez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:22:42 2015 UTC,Another option is to use a weak thrust with the ion engines to help me slow down without using the propellent. Once I am on top of the station then I use the propellent.

simplerockets,39ai4z,Sir_SmurfAlot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:48:09 2015 UTC,"The best way to dock is without using the map. Get into an orbit that's pretty close to what your docking with, get a closest approach of around 20km, then once you're there just burn towards the target slowly, don't use the map once you're within 20km. Make a stage specifically for this, it doesn't take much delta-v and once you're at the satellite ditch the stage and use rcs. I can dock anything in a few minutes with this strategy, it's best to keep everything above 150km so that you can use 100x warp. Just remember get a closest approach of 20km then ditch map view and burn towards your target slowly, making sure you don't get further away from it"

The game will just replace anything that is in that folder with a name exactly like the one in the vanilla game and keep other stuff the same.  For example, you want smaturn's crust to look like smearth's, you just copy the PlanetCrustSmearth file into the folder of your mod and rename it PlanetCrustSmaturn (I tried that and it worked)"

simplerockets,396mih,filipcez,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool! I like the station with the massive solar arrays on each side. Looks really awesome. Although they wobble around if I switch on the ion engines. Also, I think you can rename all the parts like Starboard Solar Array, Port Solar Array, Lander 1 & 2, Docking Extension, and the middle can the name of the whole station as that is the name that will show up in the map (when viewed from other undocked ship). I think you can improve the lander a bit. Try adding RCS thrusters on the bottom 3 tanks as well because the lander cannot translate left and right (before staging), they just rotate clockwise and anticlockwise. And the chutes placement might be a bit too low because when they fully deployed (on Smearth), the top stage spins around and rips off from the bottom stage. I tried again with the second lander, it still spins violently when the chutes fully deployed but it barely survived from ripping apart (thanks to RCS). And with those 46 solar panels (if my count is correct), you can totally add more ion engines. Based on my calculations, about 24 ion engines can be fully sustained by all 46 solar panels at 100% throttle at 1SMAU (the solar panel recharges slower the further they are from the Sun). Cheers"

simplerockets,394hmu,Faris_rulez,4,Tue Jun 9 05:00:58 2015 UTC,"This is not an uncommon problem. I was an early user of the sandbox (i was actually the one who reported the problem that resulted in the adapter at GS) and it was before the wiki for it was created. My addition the sandbox was a trio of satellites around Smearth and a deep space probe that I had managed to get to escape velocity of the entire system. Not a bad feat.   However, a few days later i discovered that my work was missing from the most recent mission file. I concluded that in the chaos of the Beta release and the birth of the GS, it had gotten lost, and fully supported the birth of the wiki page.   That being said, now that we have the wiki page, there is no excuse for this to be still happening. i propose we start doing a punishment system, where if you fail to use the most up to date file, your work gets detroyed in-game by the victim in a matter of the victim's choice (Shot down, self-destructed, de-orbited)"
simplerockets,394hmu,JediRangerKendor,2,Tue Jun 9 09:47:17 2015 UTC,"Oh shuck, must sucked to have that happened. Anyway, I think if someone failed to use the latest save file, the appropriate punishment is his/her sandbox cannot be logged in the wiki page.  Also, I was wondering if there's a way for the user to inform if there is an ongoing mission. Like a header on top of the wiki page:  STATUS : Mission Ongoing - Galileo Station resupply Duration : 15 hours left or if it's free STATUS : No Ongoing Mission/Available  This way, no two people are on a mission using the same save file (which is not good)."

simplerockets,394hmu,Sammy197,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"SOLUTIONS: I don't think that the hoverboard went missing because someone didn't use the correct save file. In MY opinion, someone must have destroyed it accidentally or on purpose (which is just straight up cruel). I have had problems with my own missions where stuff on the surface of smoon or smars, explodes when reloading a sandbox save, or just restarting the game. This might be because the terrain changed underneath the vehicle, or something like that. But I'm not here to blame it all on the bugs, I actually have a solution.  We should not only make a list of the sandbox saves in the wiki page, but also of the individual ships, that are in the latest sandbox. The person that wants to update the wiki must check before and after launching his own stuff that all the other ships are in the sandbox in which he or she is going to build in. Then update the ship list with his or her own stuff along with the sandbox save file. If a ship disappeared, we could have a copy of the previous ship list to know which ships were destroyed, and only the last person who updated the wiki would have his or her work deleted, to avoid making people further down the line delete their work too."

simplerockets,37aos5,Faris_rulez,3,Tue May 26 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"It helps lower drag when travelling at high speed through atmosphere. The physics of aerodynamics in SimpleRockets is very simple. Every nosecone adds a reduction of coefficient of friction (although I'm not sure of the algorithm used, have to check the coding itself) regardless of the position and orientation of the nosecone and spacecraft. Meaning nosecone placed upside down at the engine has the exact same effect if you put it on the top of the spacecraft, if the number of nosecones is the same. The only difference will be the position of the centre of mass (although not much as it's relatively very light compared to the spacecraft)  The reason I put them at the bottom of the rocket is so that only the first stage has the benefit of good aerodynamics, therefore when the first stage is jettisoned, the rest of the stages don't need to carry the extra weight. Again, orientation of the nosecones doesn't matter.  Sorry for wall of text, though.  Edit : grammer"
simplerockets,37aos5,PJ83,1 point,Wed May 27 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the explanation!! I'm going to do a few tests and try it! cheers"
simplerockets,37aos5,Faris_rulez,2,Wed May 27 10:19:57 2015 UTC,Yeah sure. The easiest way to test this is using the 'Maximum Thrust' challenge. Set up a simple rocket with 1) no nosecone 2) nosecone on top 3) nosecone at the bottom etc. and blast off at full speed!
simplerockets,37aos5,PJ83,1 point,Wed May 27 11:25:51 2015 UTC,Well give me a wig and call me Shirley. You are right!
simplerockets,37aos5,Faris_rulez,1 point,Wed May 27 12:04:41 2015 UTC,I wonder how much benefit you get from nose cones that detatch?
simplerockets,37aos5,Faris_rulez,1 point,Wed May 27 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure. I wish I can get a hold on the coding that defines the algorithm for the air resistance and the parameters that influence it (speed, density of air, mass, volume?). Also, it would awesome if I can get the data for the atmospheric density for different altitude. I read a bit on 'Max Q' or maximum dynamic pressure, and understands the basics of it. So it would be cool to actually put that knowledge alongside the info for friction coefficient and atmospheric density into designing a more efficient rocket. What do you think?"
simplerockets,37aos5,GR00G0,1 point,Wed May 27 15:50:18 2015 UTC,sounds complicated
simplerockets,37aos5,Sammy197,1 point,Wed May 27 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"Basically it explains why you shouldn't accelerate to 100% throttle in 'Optimum Trajectory' challenge. Because at lower altitude, air is thick i.e. atmospheric density is high, therefore accelerating too fast will essentially gives you higher speed, but that higher speed is quickly lose at low altitude because the air is still too thick (drag is too high from high speed and high air density). At lower speed, you are not losing speed too quickly even at the same low altitude so you can fly longer. Max Q is also taken into consideration in real life designing (to minimise stress on the spacecraft) but I don't know much about that."

If it's a natural object you're trying to intercept, establish an elliptical orbit whose apoapsis is the same altitude as the object you are intercepting. If your periapsis is lower than your apoapsis, your orbit will be shorter and it will take less time to do one revolution. The more of a difference between your orbit and the target, the fewer revolutions will be required for you to catch up. Once you get close, re-adjust your orbit to circularize it. Keep doing this until the gap gets smaller and smaller."
simplerockets,3743ix,RCalabraro,1 point,Sun May 24 19:03:16 2015 UTC,Ok thank you I will try that now.
simplerockets,3743ix,Sammy197,1 point,Sun May 24 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"Its complicated to explain through text, but here I go.  The technique I use goes something like this: You launch from the top of smearth, right? Well, if smearth was a big clock, and your target ship/station is orbiting counterclockwise, you should wait until it is at about 10 o'clock. This is the proper time to launch. Make your apoapsis the height of the orbit of your target ship, and start burning sideways. Ok, at this point you should be kinda close to the target ship. If the target ship is behind you, you'll need to go slower, so ironically, you'll have to accelerate more, so that your apoapsis is higher than the orbit of the other ship. If its in front of you, you'll need to get your periapsis to be lower than the ship's orbit. Basically, have one point in your orbit that matches the other orbit, and another point that is lower/higher, depending on your position relative to the target ship. This happens because if you have a higher orbit you'll go slower, and a lower orbit, will make you go faster because you're closer to the planet, where there is more gravity. At your apoapsis you'll always go slower than at your periapsis.   Remember that you need to use the Encounter tool to guarantee encounter. Keep burning until the closest approach is about 5,000m. This is a very delicate process so you want to make little, tiny engine burns to achieve an encounter. When the X appears, you have made it, but you'll be going at a different speed than the other ship in the encounter, so you'll need to slow down accordingly to be able to dock. For starters, just zoom out and see where the target ship is in the ship view, and slow down, as you maneuver towards the ship with rcs or with normal engines.  I really hope this helps and maybe you could send a screenshot or just tell me whether you docked or not."

Also, just a few suggestions. 1) Maybe you can move the two rcs tanks on each end towards the centre so that if they're empty or full, they won't have much effect on the centre of mass. 2) With the rcs tanks moved, then you can move the rcs thrusters outwards even more, so you can rotate faster using the same amount of fuel. 3) Maybe add more batteries so that you can really appreciate that number of solar panels and store more power, just in case.

simplerockets,36hh5v,rainyparade,1 point,Tue May 19 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I have built one like this before (few engines pointing downwards and one pointing sideways), but it is hard to control it if you just want to 'hover' because you cannot switch off the side engine, and all of them follow the same throttle level, so it has a weird thrust vector angle, but I got it into orbit around Smoon though!"
simplerockets,36h6ry,MoggieCanada,2,Tue May 19 10:51:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, if what you meant is a retrograde orbit (in SR planets are orbiting anti clockwise, or prograde orbit), it should be possible but you will be using a lot of fuel to switch the direction (twice the amount of delta-v needed for you to kill the lateral velocity and plummet into the Sun!). Although I'm not sure why you would need an orbit like that to encounter Smars. If anything, you'd need a prograde burn for the outer planets (if you launch from Smearth). Cheers"
simplerockets,36h6ry,Faris_rulez,2,Tue May 19 11:22:46 2015 UTC,"Hi Faris. I found the opposite to be true. Once I execute a pro grade burn for both p and a points of my orbit, I find myself at roughly the same orbital velocity as Smars. My orbital plane is nearly circular so I end up pacing Smars. any attempt to further pro grade warps my orbit into a severe ellipse where it takes a lot longer to make an encounter happen, assuming I do not run out of fuel."
simplerockets,36h6ry,Faris_rulez,1 point,Tue May 19 12:08:59 2015 UTC,Do you mind giving a screenshot of your orbit? I'm not the best at this phasing stage but I'll see what I can do to help
simplerockets,36h6ry,Faris_rulez,1 point,Tue May 19 12:38:41 2015 UTC,Here is what I mean. I am using a Hoffman transfer to get to Smars but I don't always get an encounter like what I got this time. 9 out of 10 tries it is usually a closest approach  https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4eb6ac8655163b07!8620&authkey=!ANLBaxi86bcJEDo&ithint=folder%2cpng
simplerockets,36h6ry,RCalabraro,1 point,Tue May 19 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see. This is all about timing where and when to fire your engine for that Hohmann transfer and get into the destination orbit. I would probably make a guide (tutorial?) of how I did my encounter with any planet but for now I have a test coming up. :(  The basic rule is, 1) you orbit faster (finish one complete revolution) if you have a smaller orbit, and vice versa (orbit slower in a bigger orbit). Therefore, if the destination planet of a bigger orbit (Smars, Smupiter, Smuranus etc.) is 'in front' of you (revolution-wise), then you want to be in a smaller orbit to catch up to the planet (because you are orbiting faster), and vice versa. If the destination planet of a bigger orbit is 'behind you', you want to be in a bigger orbit so it will catch up to you. When to burn to get into an encounter (that means you and the planet will meet up in the same place), well, I suppose I can't do much for now."
simplerockets,36h6ry,RCalabraro,1 point,Tue May 19 23:50:04 2015 UTC,That's my problem. I would need to build a fuel laden tanker in order to either catch up or aerobrake into encounter. This is why the only way I will ever catch up is by using a savagely distorted orbit that spans nearly two orbits and let time take its course so an encounter happens naturally.
simplerockets,36h6ry,RCalabraro,1 point,Wed May 20 06:03:14 2015 UTC,I also added one more file that resolves into closest approach instead of an encounter. Further firing only would exaggerate my Hoffman orbit into a severe  ellipse and fuel would run out.
simplerockets,36h6ry,RCalabraro,1 point,Tue May 19 22:27:59 2015 UTC,"I do it all the time. When I enter the SOI of a planet, the amount of burn necessary to get into an aerobraking trajectory is nearly the same whether I'm entering a prograde or retrograde orbit."
simplerockets,36h6ry,RCalabraro,1 point,Tue May 19 13:08:32 2015 UTC,My problem is that my hoffman does not resolve to an encounter all the time.

simplerockets,36bhnw,RCalabraro,2,Mon May 18 02:09:50 2015 UTC,Awesome idea! I immediately have the idea of starting with a ship and a small docking station some kilometres away in a crashing trajectory (suborbital). And you have to go chase the docking station and save it from crashing.

simplerockets,36bhnw,GR00G0,2,Mon May 18 15:07:35 2015 UTC,That sounds cool too. But I meant was you start controlling a ship in space. And then there's a station in the distance. But the station is heading to the planet's surface and going to crash. So you have to chase the station and dock to it. And then turn on your engine to put it into orbit before it crashes. I think it would be pretty intense.

simplerockets,369i2q,Mr_SRGuy,1 point,Sun May 17 17:49:11 2015 UTC,Aerobrake to form a really low orbit. Then perform a small retrograde burn to deflect your trajctory down to where you want to land. For landing on Mars use lots of parachutes so that you slow to 50m/s or less when they open completely (under 3500m altitude). That way you will only need a small terminal descent burn just before you touch down. The other advantage to using chutes is that they will passively orient your ship during descent and therefore save you RCS fuel.

simplerockets,35rgs9,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Tue May 12 23:40:56 2015 UTC,http://m.imgur.com/a/HrGib  You pass through the atmosphere on your initial approach such that you go into a highly elliptical orbit. Each orbit will slow you more and further circularize your orbit.
simplerockets,35rgs9,RCalabraro,1 point,Wed May 13 00:46:57 2015 UTC,What about planets without atmosphere? Are there any tricks there I might not know about? I suppose it's not as common since without mods you only really have Smoon and Smercury without an atmosphere to aerobrake.

simplerockets,35c0pw,GR00G0,2,Sun May 10 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"The approved the beta, so I am led to believe they will approve the final version as well."
simplerockets,35c0pw,GR00G0,2,Mon May 11 02:24:11 2015 UTC,/u/andrewgarrison any news for the ios beta? Sorry for me being unpatient.
simplerockets,35c0pw,BlueBlockDude,2,Sun May 10 09:04:08 2015 UTC,It's approved
simplerockets,35c0pw,ArmoredReaper,2,Mon May 11 02:25:36 2015 UTC,"/u/andrewgarrison, while your make solar panels retractable would it be hard to make landing legs also retractable and parachutes repackable?"
simplerockets,35c0pw,CaptainPotassium,2,Mon May 11 01:46:05 2015 UTC,Probably not in this version as I have already spent way more time than I had anticipated.
simplerockets,35c0pw,GR00G0,2,Mon May 11 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"Bug: Ios, might be on others, when I try to launch from the gas giants, it crashes, beta"
simplerockets,35c96z,Mr_SRGuy,2,Fri May 8 22:39:12 2015 UTC,"Will planets surface, atmosphere and special effects also will be pixelated? that would be cool!"
simplerockets,35c96z,Karolis554,1 point,Sat May 9 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm working on the 'easier' stuff. This is also kind of a side project while I'm waiting for the official release of 1.6. Once that happens I'll start working on updating my interstellar mod. I will continue to work on this thought. Long story short, I would love to do all of that, I just don't know how hard it is compared to redoing rocket textures and things like that."
simplerockets,35c96z,Dastardlyninja,1 point,Sat May 9 22:47:32 2015 UTC,I redid the textures for the fuel tanks to get them as close to the stock tanks as possible. I also added the engines.
simplerockets,35c96z,Sammy197,1 point,Fri May 8 22:40:14 2015 UTC,Looks pretty cool! Can't wait to see the finished product. :)

simplerockets,35c96z,GR00G0,1 point,Sat May 9 00:30:31 2015 UTC,8-bit sound would be pretty slick. :)
simplerockets,35c96z,GR00G0,1 point,Sat May 9 01:27:12 2015 UTC,Of you do that it would be awesome
simplerockets,35c96z,GR00G0,1 point,Sat May 9 22:04:03 2015 UTC,Can i beta test the mod?
simplerockets,35c96z,GR00G0,2,Sat May 9 16:47:52 2015 UTC,Sure! I'll try to some more of the textures done tonight and hopefully get them to you tomorrow.
simplerockets,35c96z,GR00G0,1 point,Sat May 9 17:03:11 2015 UTC,Thank you! It looks really awesome. Do you mean you will do all the textures?
simplerockets,35bjvi,Iamsodarncool,4,Fri May 8 19:06:34 2015 UTC,They are actually EM drive engines!
simplerockets,35bjvi,sotek2345,1 point,Fri May 8 19:50:32 2015 UTC,lol I was waiting for this
simplerockets,35bjvi,TheMace808,2,Sat May 9 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Andrew actually mentioned in a post 3 months ago called The future of simplerockets (you actually commented in this thread, im not a stalker, I just happened to read your name in the comments) that ion engines would have to be overpowered because he didn't want to mess around with time warp physics and people wouldn't want to wait so long to do a single manouver. So he made them overpowered so that we wouldn't have to wait so long. But they're not so OP. Solar panels depend on your distance from the sun. But I guess Xenon gas is unlimited.  BTW are you posting more videos? I'd love to see you try the new update."
simplerockets,35bjvi,Sammy197,2,Sat May 9 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"Xenon is not unlimited. Even if solar panels do provide less power further from the sun, they work fine at Smearth distance and your interplanetary transfer burn- the longest one- will be performed at Smearth distance. Ion engines currently behave like slightly nerfed tiny 21s with infinite fuel.  As for videos, at the moment I just want to play games and enjoy them. Though if there's a mission I'm particularly excited about, I might share it. I think once SR1.7 is completed I'll do a video showing off cool things you can do with the features."
simplerockets,35bjvi,Sammy197,1 point,Sat May 9 00:48:49 2015 UTC,OK
simplerockets,35bjvi,LP40,2,Sat May 9 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are op. Heres why:  The further you get from the sun, the slower the solar panels charge.  The solar panels are kind of big.  They don't produce much thrust. You can hardly take off from the moon.  One full charge battery and 1 engine usually can accelerate or decelerate your craft by 200 m/s. You can't land on any of Jupiters moons because of this. (The solar pannels won't charge the batteries fast enough.  Last of all, the leaderboards are probably being taken down so who really cares if a engine is ""OP"" or not."
simplerockets,35bjvi,LP40,2,Sat May 9 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"The further you get from the sun, the slower the solar panels charge.   You still get literally infinite thrust no matter where you are. That is a bad thing."
simplerockets,35bjvi,Dastardlyninja,2,Sat May 9 02:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if your landing and only have 1 battery, you can't afford to sit and wait for the batteries to charge if your landing on somewhere like one of Jupiters moons."
simplerockets,35bjvi,LP40,1 point,Sat May 9 03:23:57 2015 UTC,"Realistically I don't think it's possible to land or take off from anywhere using an ion engine. In reality they produce far, far less thrust than conventional propellant engines."
simplerockets,35bjvi,rainyparade,1 point,Sat May 9 04:01:36 2015 UTC,That is true.
simplerockets,35bjvi,Dastardlyninja,1 point,Sat May 9 10:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, the ion thrusters on the Dawn spacecraft orbiting Ceres produce 90 millinewtons of thrust. Hold a few coins, and the force they exert on your hand due to gravity is about the same as the thrust from these ion drives. You could strap an ion drive to your chest, turn it on and walk around normally."
simplerockets,35bjvi,RCalabraro,1 point,Sat May 9 11:50:41 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's about what I thought. Thanks for the analogy, it puts it in some better perspective. :)"
simplerockets,35bjvi,Dastardlyninja,1 point,Sat May 9 14:57:00 2015 UTC,"The most delta v spent in any mission is the transfer burn. With the new system, it doesn't cost anything."

simplerockets,357bgd,RCalabraro,2,Fri May 8 04:08:27 2015 UTC,Thanks /u/andrewgarrison for the new informartion! I'll be sure to join the TestFlight beta and give you feedback once it gets released
simplerockets,357bgd,ArmoredReaper,2,Thu May 7 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed about the beta, it doesn't affect gameplay, the skins are gone. I realize that they would have to be applied to the new parts but they will be back correct."
simplerockets,357bgd,Mr_SRGuy,2,Thu May 7 20:27:11 2015 UTC,"I'm having a lot of fun playing with the SRB and the mirror/duplication button makes building so a lot faster. A couple bugs that I found were involving water. The first is that when you exit a ship and it's in the water you can resume it fine, but if you launch another ship, it deletes the ships in the water. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but when in water, you cant warp as if you were on land. (Google Play)"
simplerockets,357bgd,ryebreaded,2,Thu May 7 23:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's a bug. I fixed it and it will be in the next update. Thanks!"
simplerockets,357bgd,Sammy197,2,Fri May 8 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where to post feedback about the beta; so I guess I'll just put it here. When a rocket goes into the water and floats up, if it has the right amount of momentum it'll actually exit the water for a few milliseconds, which is ok... But DURING the time it is above the water; it'll apply thrust without I telling it to do so. And its not only the animation of the rocket; but it actually seems to get accelerated in the direction of the rocket's heading. It's kind of annoying.  Also when you leave a ship alone in the water and load another one; the one in the water will either explode; or if you immediately switch back to that ship before it explodes;  you will not find it in the water, but instead 2,000m in the air."
simplerockets,357bgd,yellowtape5,2,Fri May 8 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, those are bugs. It's fixed now. Thanks!"
simplerockets,357bgd,yellowtape5,2,Fri May 8 14:03:48 2015 UTC,Sorry I missed it but what is this Beta?
simplerockets,357bgd,Legi0ns,2,Fri May 8 03:11:38 2015 UTC,New update for SR with some new features in preparation for releasing SR on Steam.
simplerockets,357bgd,Legi0ns,2,Fri May 8 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't know the game was coming out on Steam, I haven't been paying much attention to the subreddit lately."
simplerockets,357bgd,JediRangerKendor,2,Fri May 8 15:54:48 2015 UTC,Can you add a map view that show where the water is if not in this update the next one maybe?
simplerockets,357bgd,MisterChedder,2,Fri May 8 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea, but it's not going to happen with SimpleRockets. Maybe SR2."

simplerockets,34u95s,GR00G0,2,Thu May 7 01:09:06 2015 UTC,"Bugs I've found so far:  *The background glitches out alot on my device before I take off. Once I leave the ground and get to about 500m everything goes back to normal  *http://imgur.com/XQjzsCV  *http://imgur.com/uwRaEWZng   *You are also no longer able to rotate the cockpit sideways in the editor.  *This might not be a bug, but spacecraft floating on water will get destroyed after you launch another rocket.   I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. I was going to do this Space X thing where I land a rocket on a barge and refuel it. I built My barge, put it in the middle of the sea, (It did float) and I then launched another rocket. As soon as I lifted into the air the barge was automatically destroyed, although it was previously floating in the middle of the ocean. This makes things like recreating Space X impossible.  I personally think it's because the rocket sails to the bottom of the ocean while it's not loaded, automatically destroying it :(  Recommendations:  *Have wheels require battery charge to move.  *The ability to retract landing gear.  *I also think that full fuel tanks shouldn't float."

simplerockets,34s49f,Dastardlyninja,1 point,Mon May 4 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the idea is to loop around so that your rocket ends up being flung 'forward' from the moon-you are trying to gain the moons orbital momentum and use it to boost you towards Martian orbit... It takes practice, but that's half the fun! :) Also, the closer you can get to the moon, the better."
simplerockets,34s49f,RCalabraro,1 point,Mon May 4 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"You need to aerobrake. If you aerobrake you should be able to achieve orbit using almost no fuel, then land also using almost no fuel. Mars has plenty of atmosphere for aerobraking. Once you do it you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.  It's really easy. When encounteting a body with an atmosphere, bend your trajectory around it, dipping into the atmosphere. Mars' is thin so you have to get pretty close to the surface. It will slow you down enough to achieve a highly eccentric elliptical trajectory, and the point closest to the surface will become your apoapsis. If you must do a braking burn, do it there. Once you swing around the planet you do a prograde burn at apoapsis to raise your periapsis either higher in the atmosphere  (if you want to aerobrake further with successive orbits and circularize your orbit) or above the atmosphere  (to achieve a stable elliptical orbit). Once you finally achieve a stable orbit, you do a retrograde burn at apoapsis to dip your periapsis back into the atmosphere for terminal descent. If you have lots of chutes, and you do a burn to bring your velocity below around 800 when your altitude is around 3500, you should be slow enough that your ship doesn't disintegrate when the chutes fully open. This will bring your velocity down to around 45, and a very short burn right before touchdown will give you a gentle landing.  I have found that you can use lots of parachutes to create extra drag during aerobraking. The chutes don't completely open but they slow you down and if you build your ship right, the aerodynamic drag will passively stabilize your ship during terminal descent. I call it ""The Shuttlecock Effect."" It's super efficient and really easy.  I would post pix but the game is being stupid and shutting down when I try to load a saved game."

There are tons of awesome things you could do with water (submarines, seaplanes, floating barge a la SpaceX or floating runway) that would work way better with this part.   Battery part that is charged by solar and powers Ion drives.   Fun stuff. You might want to play with not allowing ships to operate unless they have sufficient electricity (the pod would need to have a small battery built into it). It would be fun to have to dock with a ship as a rescue mission and transfer the necessary electricity to extend the solar panels. Speaking of which, being able to retract solar panels (and landing gear and parachutes?) should be a thing if it's not too much effort.   Dark side of planets I'm thinking of abandoning this feature because I don't think it will add much to the game. What do you think?   It could be fun, especially if you add light parts. If it'll take you more than a few days to add though I'd say it's not worth it.

simplerockets,31j10s,kerouacdesbois,2,Sun Apr 5 17:20:37 2015 UTC,I can completely confirm this. It is the ONLY way to get an orbit around Smupiter.
simplerockets,31j10s,JediRangerKendor,2,Sun Apr 5 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"This is completely false. If you do some searching around here for a guy named smeggy, you'll see that it is possible to launch from Smupiter and attain orbit. Granted, you may have to use some wonky exploits like stacking tanks under engines for the TWR boost, but it is possible. In fact, I would assume achieving an atmospheric orbit even for a short time to be considerably more difficult given the needed orbital velocity and the atmospheric drag at those speeds. You would most likely need more delta-vee for that than you would for an orbit above the atmosphere."

simplerockets,2zmeoi,rainyparade,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry but the semimajor axis of Smearth in game is wrong, I'm pretty sure it's a bug. The smolar system is supposed to be 1/10th the size of the real solar system but for some reason Smearth's semimajor axis is different.   I'll do the maths too :)  altitude(gso) = ( T2 * GM / 4pi2 )1/3 - r  (source: ksp wiki)  Where T = planet's rotation period in seconds, GM = planet's standard gravitational parameter in m3 s-2, r = planet's radius in metres.  r = 637100 for Smearth.   GM of Smearth can be calculated from its surface gravity: GM = gr2 = 9.798 * 6371002 = 3,976,973,025,180.   I'm not sure what Smearth's rotational period should be. 24h, or 86400s? 2.4h, or 8640s? Smearth's orbital period divided by 365? I figured out Smearth's orbital period and it's 7672862.9s long, so each day is 21021s long if Smearth has 365 days per year. I'll use the last option.  So plug in all the numbers and you get: altitude(gso) = ( 210212 * 3976973025180 / 4pi2 )1/3 - 637100 = 2906950m = 2907km"

It is using the friction of a planets atmosphere to slow down the aircraft, you also use a cushion to soften the crash.  Lithobraking is a landing technique used by unmanned space vehicles to safely reach the surface of a celestial body while reducing landing speed by impact with the body's surface.  The word was probably coined as a whimsical adaptation of aerobraking, which is the process of slowing a space vehicle by the use of friction against a planet's atmosphere is a Greek word meaning ""rock"" or ""stone.""  Preparations for lithobraking involve protecting the probe with sufficient cushioning to withstand an impact with the surface and come to rest undamaged. The first successful lithobraking was achieved by the Soviet Luna 9 probe resulting in the first soft landing on the Moon. Unlike the USSurveyor probes that relied entirely onretrorockets, first Luna landers used a combination of retrorockets and gas-filled cushioning bags to reach the lunar surface safely. Soviet and US landers used airbag-like lithobraking for Mars landing missions as well. Alternatively due to extremely dense atmosphere on Venus later generation Veneralanders used hard umbrella-like aerobraker in combination with shock absorbers."

First you're going to assemble a first stage  First Stage in editor  Remember to put a docking plug and some wheels on it!

Now you drive them slowly together and dock them  If you docked them succesfully, go to exit and go back to this screen, where you click on resume and choose your first stage . The crane that carried your second stage should be gone now and you're ready to launch .   Once you don't need your first stage anymore (I built it as a reusable booster with chutes), you click Undock  Now, to take your second stage again, repeat the steps I explained above; go back to mission menu, choose your second stage and you can continue with it  I really hope this helps!"

simplerockets,2youx4,miyog,2,Wed Mar 11 21:11:06 2015 UTC,Spacecraft was a mercshot 4 launched atop a Galactica 4  http://jundroo.com/ViewShip.html?id=233851 But the thread is really more about technique. My hope is that won't just go to smercury but you'll build on these techniques to go somewhere even cooler in another spacecraft.  Ps- the mercshot is okay ship but I never really worked out all the bugs. The insertion stage (third stage overall) has always had a problem of snapping apart at the bottom when you jet the side boosters.
simplerockets,2youx4,miyog,0,Wed Mar 11 21:48:18 2015 UTC,Is this how big everyone's ships are?!? Mine are always so small and rarely get to where they need to go. It seems so silly to need such a large craft. I wish more options were available to use.
simplerockets,2ymsf3,PJ83,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:05:09 2015 UTC,Double check your staging? Do you have a picture of the rocket?
simplerockets,2ymsf3,ryebreaded,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:49:22 2015 UTC,Gotta be staging. The only other thing I can think of is if there is some component between the fuel tank and the engine that you didn't notice. Like a detacher or something.
simplerockets,2ymsf3,Desperado2583,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:18:55 2015 UTC,Guys I think I worked it out. The rocket was too heavy to lift off so it appeared the bottom rockets weren't firing. Thanks for your answers and sorry for the late reply :-)

It's a simple 2 stager, so aim the first stage for an apoapsis of 130-140 km (if you're at the max payload). You can use the second stage at 10% thrust for steering. Do your orbital burn at least 90 second before apegy. It's tough to get a round orbit but I assume you're not putting up a 100 tonne satellite, so that shouldn't really matter."

I do hope that this will be looked at further as it would make mod possibilities endless.  2: Thanks, that makes it very clear already.  3: Do you know how to go about making a new landing leg? What sprites (I'm guessing multiple like the original has) and what they need to be called in order to work? Same with parachutes: how do you give more air resistance? Or is increasing the sprite's size all you need to do?  4: I realize planes aren't meant to be in the game, but it does make cool challenges for space missions, so I created an engine that projects downward. I'm kind of testing parameters to make ""hovercrafts"" more than planes. But as far as weapons go, I guess it's just bombs and not miniguns.  5: Like number one, I hope the developers, when they switch over from SP back to SR, take a look at the ability to mod the game. Maybe even make custom missions and such. Who knows?  Again, thanks for the clarification, -Ryan"

The bumpiness of the surface is definitely an issue while docking, but it's possible to overcome this by putting the base docking level a few meters off the surface. It took a bit of testing to get the the modules just right in terms of the docking height but I found using two RCS modules as the wheel legs gives a decent amount of wiggle room for the height. Adding RCS thrusters or using your rocket engines can help add a little bounce once you've landed to line up the docking ports.    Hope that helps!"

So far the best strategy I've been able to find to connect multiple modules on the Smoon is to place the ports at a similar height, drive your new module up to the base, and bounce yourself with thrusters up and down til the ports lock together."

simplerockets,2x893d,CheroCole,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"You could do 2 ways and it would work IMO. You could tilt the device and similar to how on an Xbox controller, you don't have to hold down the joystick in its position. You tilt right 15 degrees and the ship slowly turns right. Tilt it 45 degrees and it quickly turns right. There definitely should be a button on the ready that can turn off this mode, for instance if you need to dock or access the controls quickly without an odd angle.    Or, you could have it like a computer mouse, so that the direction you turn it is the way the ship goes, but obviously you'd have to have a button that locks the ship in the position and lets you return to standard phone position.   I personally like the first idea better, but implementation of the second idea is like adding steering wheel function to racing games. It's a niche market but the people in that market really appreciate when gyro control comes around. Any way, great submission OP!"

Although it may look crazy at first glance, nuclear pulse propulsion was actually studied rather extensively by the USAF and NASA from the late 1950s up through the mid 60s under the code name Project Orion. However, the partial nuclear test ban treaty of 1963 (which prohibited the use of nuclear weapons in space) ended all research being done on nuclear pulse propulsion. If the test ban treaty had not been made, we may very well have had a manned mission to Saturn by the 1970s."

The second stage is basically a sloshy 6000 with two tiny boosters on the side ; but since it carries so much weight; any little involuntary movement that the payload does; would cause the whole thing to start spinning and explode.

If someone requests that, I think it'll be a fun challenge to add!), then the planets will take into account basic position, no thought to trajectory...    Sound good?

Second when you reduce your orbit you only need to get below 70,000 km before you start getting friction that will reduce your apoapsis slowly. When you rotate to get in burn mode to reduce your periapsis do a 10% fuel burn quick burst and let your craft rotate until you are facing the right direction then change your speed to warp and you will quit rotating. This will get you on the recent leaderboards. I spent about 2 hours real time and about 504 hours on the game timer to get the leaderboard spot."

Getting into a lunar orbit from a retrograde Earth orbit means at apoapsis of the transfer orbit, the ship needs enough delta-v to change direction and match the moon's speed from a standstill. If it was prograde, the ship would already have a fraction of the moon's speed at apoapsis and it'd only need enough delta-v to make up the difference.

simplerockets,2vl0le,Yourassasinchad,2,Wed Feb 11 22:28:42 2015 UTC,I'll tell you how to get to Smupiter but that's because it's the easiest to explain. Wait till Smupiter is 90 degrees in front of you and burn outside of Smearth's SOI and once you're out keep burning prograde. For Smars wait till it's about 45-30 degrees in front of you and burn out of SOI and keep burning prograde once your out of SOI and you should get an encounter. And if you do get an encounter try to position the encounter marker on a point on the SOI that will lead your later trajectory to get as close to the planet as possible. P.S. Aero braking is very useful and allows you to save fuel you would use for slowing down by using the Atmosphere of the planet

simplerockets,2vl0le,Minnerlas,1 point,Sat Feb 14 09:15:43 2015 UTC,Wait until the blue artow and the green arrow ar alines and them burn! Your closest approach should decrease to an encounter.   PS: its easier to go to smupiter than to smars. I dont know why but i get to smupiter in a 10/10 chance. Smars only about 5/10
simplerockets,2vl0le,GR00G0,2,Wed Feb 11 22:43:11 2015 UTC,Its easier to land on Smupiter because it has bigger much SOI.
simplerockets,2vl0le,rainyparade,1 point,Thu Feb 12 06:10:35 2015 UTC,Its not even that. Its because it is moving slower than smars.

simplerockets,2u6965,Sassafras_Root,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:39:40 2015 UTC,"That sucks beyond belief. I got two mods from the same guy, the MegaModPack and the MegaModPackV2. In the first pack, he uses the small Guidance Computer, but in the second on, he goes back to using the large Guidance Coomputer, which is really bad because a lot of the new parts he uses cause the Guidance Computer to stick out like a sour thumb."
simplerockets,2u6965,HellFireKoder,2,Fri Jan 30 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"Good thing it's not true.    In un-modded SR, the command pod is kept inside the same image as every other part, but that is false for most mods if they change the pod... they usually make their own image file for each part, which MegaModPack did, so just get the image from the first one, and replace the new version, then edit PartList.XML and find the XML code for the image and tell it to use the proper image, and you will probably want to edit the size of it, with width and height."
simplerockets,2u6965,greendragonsegg,2,Fri Jan 30 07:39:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, most modders, when they found out they can add new images without counting pixels stopped changing the main skin png, real old mods may have the main png modded but most that are on /r/srmod have the new way.  New way helps so much when combining mods."
simplerockets,2u6965,Sassafras_Root,-1,Fri Jan 30 11:47:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's rough. I think the only way to get just one of the skinmesa.png parts is to use a photo editor to cut and paste the part you want into the new skinmesa.png. You'd also have to edit the shipsprites.xml to reflect the change. I haven't tried it because I only have my Android, no pc, and photo editing is tough on Android."
simplerockets,2u6965,HellFireKoder,1 point,Fri Jan 30 07:36:20 2015 UTC,"You don't have to add the image to the skins, and you don't need to change ShipSprite.xml, just make the image for the new part it's own file in the folder, and just use it's name for the sprite of the part in PartsList.xml...    Just look at the files a mod leaves behind, the older ones put part sprites in the sprites file and change shipsprites.xml, the newer ones don't, because we found out were told after an update that you don't need to."

On the left of the launch area is the usual soft hill, but to the right is totally flat for ~100m. It actually looks kinda cool, but may be another unintended bug. Also, perhaps the lack of an orbit is related to the fact that the second star doesn't appear in the list of launchable planets? Looks good so far though, can't wait to see it when it's finished!"
simplerockets,2u4xlh,Legi0ns,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:17:21 2015 UTC,The flat surface was in fact intended. I made it that way so I could test a few rover designs. The surface will most likely get more rocky in a future update
