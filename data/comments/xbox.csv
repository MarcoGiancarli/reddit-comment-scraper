xbox,3e317r,Scroachity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"Check eBay and if nothing there try amazon. I would NOT suggest checking best buy, even I needed an av cable for my 360 I found one on Amazon for about a third of the price of what Best Buy was advertising"
xbox,3e317r,cvignoni,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:01 2015 UTC,best buy price matches with Amazon if it's the same product and an Amazon sponsored seller.
xbox,3e317r,Scroachity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"Right, but the best buy ""sponsored seller"" list is in my guess not most places on eBay. Thanks for the info! That's good to know!"

xbox,3e1ra9,Miss_Masquerade86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:35 2015 UTC,Could it be mains spikes from large appliances such as the refrigerator or aircon?  Is there maybe a faulty wireless or IR controller that keeps sending the shutdown command in range when it's at home?
xbox,3e1ra9,elgraf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:00 2015 UTC,Sounds like her electric is cutting out to me. Either that or he needs to play it longer to heat it up all the way. The kid might be having issues after an hour or two. But yeah main culprit is faulty wiring.
xbox,3e1ra9,XxSCRAPOxX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:16 2015 UTC,It sounds like it might just be overheating and shutting off for safety or something. I'd ask her where she's setting it up and figure out if theres a better place to put it where it might be able to breath a little more.

xbox,3dyenm,CaptainWafflebeard,0,Mon Jul 20 15:30:57 2015 UTC,"As far as i know from my experience with the shitty plastic Xbox controllers , a year of use is WAY too much. I used to change controller every 5-6 months because they would break.You can try opening the controller case shell and make sure there's no dust or something inside the controller.Good luck :)"
xbox,3dyenm,ianmorrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"I have been using the same controller for 3 years without issue.  But I also had a first gen 360 for 4 years that was used almost constantly for everything from gaming to music to video streaming and never had a rrod (eventually got stolen, leading to a purchase of a 360S). I also smoked around it a lot too.  Maybe I'm just lucky"

xbox,3e0bj8,azchrisb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:17 2015 UTC,More to the point is that you're 17 and most like going to experience real life soon.   That means A) your disposable cash is going to go bye bye real soon and B) you're going to have to find a way to motivate yourself and find a balance between life and your hobbies.  You can remove the temptation or manage it.   Only you can say what works for you :)

xbox,3dul25,TheMarx151,4,Sun Jul 19 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"If the monitor supports HDMI then use that. HDMI is video and audio.   DVI, VGA, DisplayLink, etc are all video only.   The Xbox 360 supports HDMI, so you should be fine.  If you don't have HDMI on the monitor, you can get an HDMI (from Xbox) to DVI (monitor) adapter, however that will not have sound. You would also need to do RCA out from the standard Xbox adapter and modify that to the proper connection as well."
xbox,3dul25,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"So if my monitor have HDMI with NO speakers, will i listen the audio? or does the monitor need to have speakers?"
xbox,3dul25,TheMuffnMan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, yes, the monitor would still need speakers. If it has HDMI it probably has an audio out connection.   It would likely be one of those headphone/computer green plugs. It wouldn't be RCA (red + white) plugs."
xbox,3dul25,cherrybombswerebomb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:32:29 2015 UTC,"I see and if i have a USB speakers, do you think it will work?"
xbox,3dul25,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"I actually own a 360 that lacks an HDMI port, it was one of the first ones, so let's hope OP has one that does"
xbox,3dul25,MasterSteez,2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"Correct, I actually had one of those as well, the first gen 360's didn't have HDMI but then it was added shortly thereafter.   I'm assuming the OP has a newer black slim console, but we dunno!"
xbox,3dul25,TheSonicKind,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:10 2015 UTC,I have this exact same set up currently.  What you need to do is plug the HDMI cable into your monitor. The monitor should have an audio out port (It should look like a standard 3.5mm headphone opening).  Once you have the speakers connected to your monitor and the HDMI cord connected from your Xbox to your monitor you will need to go into System Settings. There you will find under Display (I believe..?) Display discovery and turn that off. This will allow the sound to travel through the HDMI to your monitor then out to the speakers you plugged into the audio out.  Hope this helps.
