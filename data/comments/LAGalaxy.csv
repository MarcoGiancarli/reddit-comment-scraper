I don't love it, because there is a small history of retiring numbers in MLS, we did it for Cobi Jones, so I would say that Landon is absolutely above even him.  So it's strange that he doesn't get the same treatment.    Then again, it's not a very common thing in soccer, generally.  Look at that #7 jersey at ManU, it's still not retired and some of the most decorated players ever wore that jersey."
LAGalaxy,3dywaj,the_fanciest_pj,8,Mon Jul 20 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"You make a good case. I can see why you don't like it, but I don't think we should ever retire the #10.. Landon or not. Especially a club that's not even 30 years old."
LAGalaxy,3dywaj,cadrianzen23,7,Mon Jul 20 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really don't agree with retiring numbers in soccer, LD's legacy will live on no matter who wears that number. In years to come there might be discussion of the best #10 to wear the G's crest, and I'm sure he will be front runner but that's as far as it should go IMO."

LAGalaxy,3dywaj,Viperking5,4,Mon Jul 20 23:02:13 2015 UTC,I think it's really cool to see the #10 live on with new players. In my opinion Giovanni will live up to the expectation. He's one hell of a player :)

LAGalaxy,3dyi9g,TheWayoftheFuture,4,Mon Jul 20 17:46:16 2015 UTC,"There has been a rumor that Penedo wants out of LA for a while now. The earliest mention of it was based on a report that he had a falling out with Bruce to start the year off, leading him to being benched for the first few games. The official story was that Penedo was suffering from intense migraines, hence why he didn't train or play for a couple weeks.  When Gio's signing was finally confirmed though, this rumor was revisited, as many believed LA would need to clear an international roster spot. Bruce himself was quick to shoot that idea down. It should still be noted, however, that none of these statements, regardless of their validity, mean Penedo hasn't asked to leave."
LAGalaxy,3dyi9g,threeagainstfour,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:56 2015 UTC,Is there a source or original publication somewhere for this rumor? Been seeing it referenced a bit lately and can't find where the rumor started.

LAGalaxy,3drvqv,JuniorCDC,7,Sat Jul 18 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"The scary part is the bench is made up entirely of players who start elsewhere in the league:  Rowe, Meyer (maybe not Meyer), Gargan, Maganto, Walker, Husidic, Gordon, Villarreal...  This team is incredible."
LAGalaxy,3drvqv,IshAP29,4,Sat Jul 18 22:05:06 2015 UTC,Rowe being LA's backup while being good enough to start reminds me of Martin Jones with the LA Kings. Hopefully they don't trade him away like they did to Jones though.
LAGalaxy,3drvqv,CrazyMike366,5,Sat Jul 18 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"Based on the way Gio can either cut inside or send in diagonal through balls or crosses with Mexico and Villarreal, I'd say his ""home"" position will be right wing. In a lot of ways, he's Mexico's answer to Landon Donovan - a skilled, positionally aware player who will instinctively float to where he needs to be and track back when it's smart, filling gaps at forward, wing, or midfield.  LA's system allows for a lot of interchange and I tend to generally discount ""on-paper"" formations because they don't translate to the fluidity of actual games very well. And LA can interchange better than just about any team in the league.  If we're trying to hold the possession and break a team down then Zardes, Keane, and Gio will drift around up top to find and exploit space where by can, and Juninho, Gerrard, and/or Lletget will make late runs or attempt to provide a killer pass. That's 4-3-3 ish.  If we try to play a counter attacking game or need to bypass the middle of the field, then Juninho, Lletget, Gerrard, Gio (and maybe Keane) will drop back and absorb pressure, then try to release Zardes (and/or Keane) on a long ball after a turnover. That'll look more like a 4-5-1 or a 4-4-2 depending on where Keane's technical ability is more needed."
LAGalaxy,3drvqv,CurtNo,2,Sun Jul 19 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"Statistically, game results are more positive when Leo and Gonzo are not partnered at center back. RR was plying like shit 1st half, perhaps ankle. AJ (hamstring) and Gargan (back) weren't initiating many plays, but handling defense well enough.  Its weird seeing the lineup without either husidic or juninho.  Perhaps MLS will initiate a new LAG specific 8 substitution rule so that all the A team gets time on pitch. Team is deep, only concern is defender injury."
LAGalaxy,3drvqv,Viperking5,2,Sun Jul 19 04:21:32 2015 UTC,Juninho is in the lineup.

LAGalaxy,3drvqv,ParevArev,0,Mon Jul 20 19:43:16 2015 UTC,I think our days of 4-4-2 are over with this lineup.  The classico formation is our future.  4-2-3-1.

Him moving on from Liverpool was the right move for all parties in my opinion, he struggled a lot in his final season at Liverpool and the slower paced MLS should be ideal for him.  I also didn't realize how much a 35 year old Robbie Keane had been taking the piss, his scoring record in the MLS is ridiculous."

LAGalaxy,3dpjlf,MostRetardedUser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:14:40 2015 UTC,"Robbie Keane will go down as a top 2-3 player in MLS history when he retires. The man has been nothing short of remarkable in LA. 19 goals and 14 assists last year. Career 0.65 goals per game. Two straight hat tricks in a row in MLS play this month...  Gerrard will be great for us, but it is almost unfathomable that he makes as big of an impact as Keano. There hasn't been a better signing in the history of MLS.  ...and this is coming from a long time West Ham fan that was furious when we signed him, Spud that he was. But I am a firm believer in supporting the player from the moment he puts your club's shirt on, and Keane has never once made me regret it."

I know it's strange for us Galaxy fans but I love the idea of parity and being a league without a Barcelona or a Bayern. Or even having only 5 teams compete like the Prem. We need a large majority of our teams to be able to compete.  That being said I do hope Galaxy wins CONCACAF Champions League.  edit - I'm fine with being a dynasty, just not a Super Club. I'd rather be the New England Patriots than Real Madrid. Winning a league that has parity built in shows you are winning because you are better not because you have more money. I like that."

There might be some hurdles to cross there, you never know, but I'd say highly unlikely.   https://i.imgur.com/pb27baO.jpg  Also, does anyone know where LD is going to college?

LAGalaxy,3de58m,IshAP29,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:40 2015 UTC,I wonder how much of this sudden hype has to do with Gio. I mean I find it hard to believe that word of the transfer has spread that far already
LAGalaxy,3de58m,Gecko5567,2,Wed Jul 15 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"True. This is more of a warning of ""Grab your tickets before the hype train comes through. Choo choo, mofo""  Also, the news of Stevie G has just now hit critical mass so that will sell tickets. But once the news of Gio Two Saints comes full circle we'll be looking at constant sellouts and ""Beckham-bump"" style attendance leaps on the road thanks to those two.  EDIT: Also, everybody still wants to see Keane. Club America can attest that he's still got it!"

LAGalaxy,3d9chs,purplecorazon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind though is if/when the team does build a new stadium, the cost will likely be a bit cheaper than Stubhub due to the likelihood that most of their facilities will remain in Carson.   Even now, LAFC's stadium project is expected to cost them at least $400m when all is said and done, but the reason that number is so high is not only because they're building their own training complex but an entire convention hall as well.   By comparison, the entire Stubhub grounds would cost roughly $200m in 2014 dollars and half of that is for the stadium itself. Thus, the most cost-effective option for them in the future would be to just build a new stadium as close to pre-existing parking lots and public transit lines as possible and commute from the CSU Dominguez campus.   Today, there are two sites that would allow them to do that in the downtown area: one in Lincoln Heights and one in South Park by the convention center. I can't imagine what might be available 15-20 years out, but maybe then, the whole downtown boom will be over or Carson will be a happening place."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,fatuousjaguar,3,Thu Jul 16 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"If they had any thought of the possibility of building a new stadium in the next 10 years, they would not invest $15 million in the last year. So nope. Being optimistic, I am hoping for 2030 lol."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,fatuousjaguar,2,Tue Jul 14 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"What upgrades did they do? This is my first season going to every home game, and all I've noticed is the new screen."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,CACuzcatlan,4,Tue Jul 14 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistake it was just upgrades throughout the stadium, I'm not sure because I haven't been able to catch a game in a while. But the biggest was the screen as you said."

LAGalaxy,3d9chs,three_eyes,7,Tue Jul 14 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but I don't see it happening for at least 25 years."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,three_eyes,7,Tue Jul 14 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"The Home Depot/Stub Hub is still getting money from LA Galaxy for all the retouches and stuff, I doubt they would pay the $15 million just to say see you later in 5/10 years. Stub Hub center is a great place for the Galaxy right now, much better than the Rose Bowl that we previously had."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,purplecorazon,4,Tue Jul 14 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think if the football stadium in Carson is built there will be a lot more stuff to do in the area. I love Carson because I'm from there but they don't have shit to do there, luckily I live in San Pedro now."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,PeriodZeroHero,2,Tue Jul 14 17:06:35 2015 UTC,Now that would make it more exciting I think. I'd love to go hang out for a few hours before/after the game you know? They need a strip of bars or something.
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,gambit700,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:06 2015 UTC,Yeah that would be a lot more fun if they had more choices when it comes to bars around the area. They have a BBW not too far from the stadium I think that might be an alright place to hang out before/after the games
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,tega234,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:47 2015 UTC,"Frankly, all I wish AEG would do is spin off Soccerfest into its own entity and expand the pre- and post-game activities there into more of their own attraction rather than treat it like a side event. Give us outdoor movie screenings, small, indie concerts, tasting tours, flea markets, all that stuff and something else.   Make Stubhub its own destination. Make it more than just the home of the Galaxy and Wango Tango.  The biggest myth we put up with is that fans don't want to drive all the way out to Carson, but the only reason that it exists is because, aside from watching the game itself, what else is there for people to do?   In this, the two demographics the team is trying to court -- families and young millennials -- aren't all that different. They both need to feel the trip they're making will be worthwhile and that they can't have a similar experience somewhere else with some other team.  Sure, everything is going just swimmingly when you're winning and/or you have a star in Keane, Gerrard or Dos Santos... but what happens when you don't have either? How many people will care about you then?   Cultivating the right matchday experience is key to answering that question, and unfortunately, while the team's repeatedly made huge investments in the on-field part of that equation, the off-field part could still use some work."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,Viperking5,3,Thu Jul 16 18:27:54 2015 UTC,Maybe if we're lucky one da they'll build an extension from the Green or Blue lines and connect a train to Stubhub
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,cerebrix,2,Wed Jul 15 05:37:04 2015 UTC,There isn't a need for a new facility.
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,cerebrix,2,Tue Jul 14 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"They to put a roof around the whole thing, for acoustics and what not."
LAGalaxy,3d9chs,Gecko5567,2,Tue Jul 14 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"As much as I would like to see the Galaxy move closer in the LA area, I really like Stubhub. Its been there forever and I have grown attached to it. I want to see it grow more and more over the next couple decades and see it evolve. I hope they expand the capacity of the stadium to fit more people. They probably will once they see the hordes of people going to go watch Gerrard and dos Santos."

LAGalaxy,3czm5d,AnalAttackProbe,8,Sun Jul 12 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"It was Dunivant who cost us the goal. He was the guy who kept the runner onside.

LAGalaxy,3cywsf,IshAP29,13,Sun Jul 12 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"Fans of Mexican teams are generally different when it comes to attending matches. They like to throw beer (though sometimes it's piss) and other things. Seeing as to how America fans will certainly outnumber LA's fans, one's chances of receiving a Mexican 'beer shower' is much more likely."
LAGalaxy,3cywsf,LordOfBTs,3,Sun Jul 12 03:00:55 2015 UTC,I wasn't aware of the beer shower. Hopefully stubhub isn't too defaced after the game.
LAGalaxy,3cywsf,IshAP29,6,Sun Jul 12 03:08:44 2015 UTC,I went to LA vs Monterrey once and there were quite a bit more Monterrey fans but I didn't get any beer shower and where I sat at least it was more family groups so they were pretty chill. The parking lot was blasting with banda music after they won.
LAGalaxy,3cywsf,EricM12,10,Sun Jul 12 03:10:45 2015 UTC,"When I was eleven years old my Dad took me to my first, and only El Súper Clásico. While looking for our section we walked into the wrong tunnel entrance, and there they were. A section full of Américanistas. It didn't take before these fuckers started to throw beer, and spit at us. We bolted out of there, and continued our search. We finally found our seats, our search was over. Around the second half a few Américanistas started to throw stuff like peanuts, and garbage. Three rows ahead of me there were a family of three. A Father, a Mother, and a baby girl. The woman got ""beer"" thrown at her from these ""fans"" sitting a few rows behind us. Everyone from our row, and below turns around to see which asshole did this horrible thing. The man gets up from his seats, and starts a tantrum yelling, and cursing. Demanding that the person responsible man up to what he did. Of course no one did, and I didn't exactly know which one of the lot did it so pointing out the perpetrator was out of the question. The man leaves along with his daughter, and wife/girlfriend. A day that could've been a nice family evening was ruined by a couple of ""fans"". Of course in the end I believe every fan base has their rotten apples. Some more than others though. Cough América.    Edit: spelling"
LAGalaxy,3cywsf,JuniorCDC,2,Sun Jul 12 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah Clasicos can be very dangerous to go to. I would never recommend going to a rivalry match between two football teams with family.   When I was younger my brother and I went to visit some family in Argentina where we are from. We had bought Boca-River tickets a couple months in advance, and I can tell you it was probably one of the scariest/memorable experience I ever witnessed. There were so many fights, trash talking, things being thrown. My brother got hit with a glass bottle and got a gash on his left eyebrow."

The home section had empty seats, yet the away section was PACKED.  The CA club section was insane. 90 mins of singing, jumping, band playing, and smoke bombs. They even shot off a rocket! There was even a time they started throwing bottles and smoke bombs on the pitch when the ref gave a questionable call. Crazy!  Def going back to another Galaxy game though. I really want to check out a match against San Jose and see how crazy our fans can really get.   Other than being overwhelmed by opposing fans, I had a good time! We got the last laugh though haha!"

LAGalaxy,3clpcm,AnalAttackProbe,2,Wed Jul 8 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"Well obviously. But what happens when the year ends?  Also, that salary is much better aligned with what GDS should be making. There were people who thought Neymar money was justifiable..."
LAGalaxy,3clpcm,fizzlebuns,2,Thu Jul 9 02:34:37 2015 UTC,"You have to stop comparing the money. These things don't ever even out. Paying GDS 7m does not mean he's better than Neymar. It means that's how much it took to get him to leave Europe. Gio will make us way more than his salary, so a high one can be justified."
LAGalaxy,3clpcm,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:07:03 2015 UTC,"I am okay with overpaying. But paying GDS 9 million a year is absolutely insane. He will make us money, but there are better players you can pay the same amount of money that will be better for the club.  He is going to be amazing for us, don't get me wrong, but for an investment that expensive we should expect a bigger return than what he'd give us.  $9 mil a year is a drop in the bucket for Barcelona and they live in a world where their investments have much bigger returns. But they still fought hard with his agent to not pay Neymar an even $10 mil.  $9 mil a year is no drop in the bucket to the LA Galaxy."

But the clubs find the players, the clubs negotiate the contracts and MLS does the paperwork.  That's why small markets are pissed about GDS. It's a lot of money if you don't have as many people buying shit. The TV contract is big, but Barca makes a lot more on theirs....which is tied directly to their TV numbers. Unlike ours.  I haven't forgotten the transfer fee at all. I just didn't neglect the TV deal. The bonus for league position. The bonus for Cup victories. The bonus for Champions League knockout stage victories.  Like I said: Bigger bucket, smaller drop."
LAGalaxy,3cmcy5,drummerscales,3,Thu Jul 9 00:58:52 2015 UTC,You can go to the team LA store in stub hub center. We've got plenty of long sleeve Beckham shirts for like 50% off

LAGalaxy,3cksd3,AnalAttackProbe,6,Wed Jul 8 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"If they implement a Core Player (CP) rule with $750K limit, and they adjust the Targeted Allocation Money (TAM) to be able to pay down DPs or CPs, then next year Omar could be only $250K to pay down, if his base compensation is the same as 2014 ($1.0 million) and we only have to pay down the base compensation.  Also, we're probably not going to sign Dos Santos until after the Gold Cup, further reducing the amount of our current $500K we have to use to pay down Omar, the pro-rating of which may be based on weeks in the season, not weeks in the calendar year. That would leave us more leftover to use against the hopefully-only $250K for next year.  Because the Core Player rule is already in the pipeline, I wouldn't be surprised if the Galaxy FO only signs Dos Santos (which I feel is practically guaranteed at this point based on the Klein's response at the Gerrard press conference and Dos Santos less than subtle hints/conversations) if they either know that they'll be able to afford Omar next year because of the upcoming Core Player rule, or if Omar was already planning a move to Europe after this season."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,Obligatius,2,Wed Jul 8 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"The point about when Gio signs is a good one... But will only affect 1-2 pay periods, max.  I think your last paragraph is spot on, though."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,rolldog,2,Wed Jul 8 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"I believe Targeted Allocation Money is the mechanism that was rumored as the ""Core Player."" I would be surprised (pleasantly) if a Core Player designation also comes into existence."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,cuthman99,5,Wed Jul 8 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"Aaaand that's the sound of my frontal cortex popping like bubble wrap.  I have come to a realization: I cannot be a fan of MLS the same way I used to be a fan of the NFL, constantly trying to track player signings, trade rumors, etc., etc. I have to just love the team that is on our roster now, and accept that it gets created by mysterious forces utterly beyond my comprehension. I'm okay with this; it's a real time saver, actually. As far as I can tell, every player on the roster arrives as a gift from the soccer gods, except those few (not naming names) who are obviously curses. MAY THE SOCCER GODS BE WITH US."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,Viperking5,5,Wed Jul 8 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"As much as I don't want Omar leaving, he owes it to himself to make a move to Europe. He deserves it, hopefully he'll leave a champion and help us get a sixth trophy."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,gambit700,3,Wed Jul 8 22:41:25 2015 UTC,I thought the Core Player rule was going to get adjusted at the year anyway. If they change that rule so that Omar fits under it then he'll stay.
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,gambit700,4,Wed Jul 8 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"They would need to change the rule drastically. Like... beyond comprehension.  Right now the rule is $500k over a 5 year period. If they changed it to $500k per year... we still can't afford to keep Omar.  Unless they implement a 4th DP rule this offseason ""changing"" the rule won't matter in Omar's case."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,GoldenRy007,3,Wed Jul 8 19:03:39 2015 UTC,Like... beyond comprehension.   This is MLS. Beyond comprehension rule changes is their specialty
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,GoldenRy007,2,Wed Jul 8 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"There will be no end to the vitriol if they change the rule from $500k per 5 to $700k per one, just so we can keep Omar. MLS fans of the other 19 (21? 23?) teams would riot.  MLS has bent over backwards for us before, but I don't see them bending over that much.  A 4th DP slot is the only viable solution to ""the Omar problem""."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,GoldenRy007,2,Wed Jul 8 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"The money can be traded I believe. So, I bet the Galaxy will figure out a way to keep Omar if they still want him."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,iflylikeaturtle,2,Wed Jul 8 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"Read the post. We won't trade up to $665k in allocation PER YEAR to keep Omar. No way, no how. Unless you plan on fielding a team of 3 DPs, Omar and no one else. We simply don't and won't have the pieces."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,iflylikeaturtle,3,Wed Jul 8 18:21:47 2015 UTC,It just doesn't make sense. It's in MLS's best interest to keep Omar in the league.
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,LordOfBTs,2,Wed Jul 8 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"He may already have his heart set on Europe.  Unless they make a drastic change to the rules this offseason, there is no way we can keep him. Mathematically no way."
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,marqueezy,2,Wed Jul 8 18:37:22 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if they could still implement the Core Player Rule. Maybe this is a way for MLS to help out teams that dont have DPs in anticipation of the bigger clubs getting 4. I guess only time will tell.
LAGalaxy,3cksd3,LordOfBTs,2,Wed Jul 8 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"That's the only scenario I can think of that makes sense. Either they implement a 4th DP slot or they implement a ""core player"" slot for players between $435k and say... $2m... or something."

Since then big names have joined the MLS (Henry, Michael Bradley, Kaka, etc.) and it's not a big deal as it used to be. Don't get me wrong, Gerrard is a LEGEND but the league has grown since 2007 and it's no surprise they don't make a bigger deal about Gerrard or other singings as to what they did for Beckham. I recall that during Beckham's debut there was a camera for the game and a separate camera dedicated to Beckham. He was on the bench sitting and the camera was focused on him only during his debut."
LAGalaxy,3ch7jq,labrigade2012,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:23:23 2015 UTC,Completely agree.  And I'm glad we're past that.  I'm just thinking they could plan his first match a bit better re: national coverage.

Not even traveling supporters really apart from some banter. So the etiquette is something I wouldn't worry too much about. Obviously don't be a dick and you should be cool.  Unless you're in a supporters section, be prepared to be told to sit down if you're planning on standing up often. Courtesy for the people behind you (if I had it my way, I'd have everyone stand).  The two major supporters group are Riot Squad (Section 138) and Angel City Brigade (General Admission; but technically they have their own section now. These guys are RAD). Everyone is hella friendly and are there to support the boys (well, I can only speak for ACB) so don't be shy, there's no drama really or any that a casual would be a part of. I strongly suggest heading to a supporters section, it's just a really fun environment.  Beer is expensive. Do the big ass Coronas, I think it's the best value.  You're not allowed to bring food in unless you're with someone who's pregnant. So tell them your girlfriend is pregnant 😈 My girlfriend's been pregnant for years!  Enjoy yourself! Pleeeease don't compare the standard to La Liga or EPL or anything. It's a different league with a different standard. You'll just end up disappointed. Same way you would if you compared the brand new Lexus you just bought to a Lamborghini. And I don't say this to prepare you for bad soccer. It's really good.

I mean, it's possible of course with a couple of bus transfers, google maps will give you all the details, however you'll be going through some very very sketchy neighborhoods. Besides you'll be returning late after the game. Please don't even consider. I've lived here all my life and I wouldn't even do it in the day time. Better just to fork up the UBER here.  Good news is that from the Dolby theatre to Conan studio you can definitely take one metro bus (35-40 mins or so). Metro line 222 I believe."
LAGalaxy,3cg8bv,AnalAttackProbe,3,Tue Jul 7 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"For those of you who missed the press conference, here are some of what I consider to be the highlights from every participant, Dan Beckerman, Chris Klein, Bruce Arena, and Steven Gerrard:  Beckerman  On AEG's commitment to the Galaxy  ""[AEG] is continued to [investing] in this club... We want to be the best club in North America.""  He goes on to name drop Donovan, Becks, Keane and now Gerrard, adding: ""Bruce and Chris have the green light to improve this club however they can.""  Klein  On Gerrard  ""This signing continues [our] tradition"" of acquiring world-class players.   ""This is a soccer decision first and foremost; we want to put ourselves in a position to win each and every year.""  On rumors involving Dos Santos  ""As we say all along, we follow the rules of the league... Right now, there is nothing that would allow us to add another player."" Does hint that if something were to change, they would continue to be ""very aggressive"" in bettering the team.   Bruce  On replacing Donovan  ""We certainly had some holes to fill on our team.. . we instantly thought he'd be a perfect fit. "" Goes on to praise Klein, Beckerman, and Anschutz for making the deal happen.   On how Gerrard will fit into the team now that it is just starting to get some better results  ""I don't think we'll change a whole lot... Steven did his homework before he got here."" Says he knows most of the players and what they like to do already, and that there will be ""some subtle changes"" in how the team lines up and attacks.   Gerrard  [After again thanking Anschutz, Bruce, Chris] ""The game on Saturday can't come quick enough... We've got a fantastic team here, fantastic set-up...""  On the Galaxy's tradition of acquiring big-name players and replacing past legends  ""Hopefully I can follow in [David Beckham and Landon Donovan's footsteps].""   On what it will be like playing for LA  ""I adapt pretty quickly, so I think that transition will come quickly."" Says he won't excuse a slow adaptation that takes months.   ""I'm ready for the challenges, the traveling, the weather.. . I'm not a player who will use excuses."" Does admit one key challenge will be helping his family adapt to life in LA.   On how training compares between clubs  ""It's not much different from back in Liverpool.""  On his perception of MLS before arriving versus now  ""I think it's grown, I think it's improved... I've been very impressed by the standard of training.""  On what we got out of the WWC  ""I watched highlights of the game, and the ladies did spectacularly well... Football's growing over here, for both the women and the men, and there's a real buzz around the league.""  On what he needed to hear from LA  ""What struck me the most was how aggressive [they were]...I needed a new challenge, a fresh challenge...I spoke to Bruce and Chris, and after one or two conversations, I knew this was the place for me. If anyone thinks I'm coming here for a holiday or paycheck, they'll be proved wrong.""  On Keane  ""It was very nice to have Robbie on hand to introduce me to all the guys... He also lent me some factor 50 (sunblock).""  On homesickness and no longer playing for Liverpool  ""I will miss it at times, but moving forward, it's about LA Galaxy."" He does however note he plans to keep up with the club and watch every Liverpool game he can. Will also train with the guys back in Merseyside in the offseason.  On Lampard and other recent big-name DP signings such as Kaka and Pirlo  ""I love rivalries...I think rivalries are healthy. And I'm looking forward to playing against Frank [and the others]."""

However, the main points are:   The $9m offer that LA allegedly made for Dos Santos was too tempting for him to refuse and will make him the highest paid Mexican player ever. No other specifics - - such as contract length -- are available at this time. In any event, if it's real, Gio will also be the most expensive player in MLS. Yep, including Pirlo.  The majority of LA's fanbase is latino, which, as speculated, did play a huge part in the team's interest in him.  His acquisition will be confirmed upon the completion of the Gold Cup on July 26, although it may be announced earlier pending Mexico's elimination in one of the earlier rounds. There is no timetable as of yet on when he will play his first game and Gio's people are already looking for a house in the LA area in preparation for his move from Valencia."

LAGalaxy,3ccylh,aleixis,2,Tue Jul 7 02:35:09 2015 UTC,Cuau pt. 2
LAGalaxy,3ccylh,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:18:57 2015 UTC,not sure if this is a knock on Cuau but as I remember he moved Chicago when he got here and he was past his prime.
LAGalaxy,3ccylh,Viperking5,3,Tue Jul 7 18:54:43 2015 UTC,Under no circumstance is GDS worth Benzema money. Are you sure it wasn't 9 million pesos?  That's just... Wow. Speechless if true. How reliable is this source when it comes to contract details?
LAGalaxy,3ccylh,supersab121,4,Tue Jul 7 02:55:37 2015 UTC,He's also getting paid as much as Neymar
LAGalaxy,3ccylh,fizzlebuns,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"Neymar gets $31mil/year.  GDS is worth the same as Giovinco, or maybe even more. If Giovinco played in LA for example, you think he would attract more fans, sell more shirts, etc than Dos Santos?    People keep comparing to Benzema, I think he is underpaid to be honest. Ronaldo gets like $70mill/year and Benzema is under $10mill? dang."
LAGalaxy,3ccylh,LA_Galaxy741,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"But Benzema is not available to the G's, and if the likes of Gerrard, Pirlo, and Lampard with their age and few years past their prime (Pirlo may be the exemption.) can get big bucks, IMO I dont mind big bucks going to a in prime talented player like GDS."
LAGalaxy,3ccylh,steveyboots,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah but we would have his image rights most likely. Those are worth way the fuck more than $9m. If you remember, though he won't make nearly this much, we paid for Beckham's entire contract with kit sales in the first year. This is actually not a lot of money when you think that Gio will bring in a minimum of double his pay simply through bullshit friendlies and merch sales. Keep in mind about the new TV deals paying more as well."

LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,j3zuz00,6,Tue Jul 7 05:05:42 2015 UTC,"Neither Keane nor Gio are forwards who are good at leading the line and Lletget is almost certainly a better winger than Zardes.  I think Zardes and Keane are your forwards, Lletget and Villarreal are your wingers with Maganto subbing in. Gio replaces Villarreal if we sign him."
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,sscoolboat,2,Tue Jul 7 05:26:19 2015 UTC,I put Zardes on the wing because that is the position he has been playing a lot with the USMNT. Is Gio also a winger? I thought he was a striker?  And you would put Lletget over Villareal?
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,AnalAttackProbe,4,Tue Jul 7 05:37:58 2015 UTC,Gio is a winger as much as he is a forward. He would likely be our best player at either position.
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,sscoolboat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:57:39 2015 UTC,"So the thing with Zardes is that as a forward he's incredibly limited on the types of chances he scores on. He's not very prodictive or proactive so you rarely see him get behind a defense from long service. He only has one career counter attack goal. He's very good at finishing and reacting faster than defenders, however, so when he gets service close around the box, he scores goals. Keane, Gio, Lletget, Villarreal, Maganto, these are all players who specialize on delivering exactly the kind of service Gyasi needs to score tons of goals as a forward  The reason Gyasi is being played so much on the wings for the nats is that his forward potential is capped by his lack of anticipation so he rarely gets to use his speed. On the wings, he can use his speed and his reactions allow him to work relatively well in fast build up, although he has very little creative burden. His strength is exploding through the channels. This fits how the nats play relatively well, (but come World Cup, I think Lletget has a much greater chance of suiting up for the USMNT's on the wings, but more on that later)  Gyasi on the wings is a long term project that Klinsmann is undertaking but he is far from complete. His defensive work rate is atrocious out there. In the Germany game he had 0 defensive actions. He also has a habit of losing his marks. He also doesn't really fit the type of midfield buildup that the Galaxy employ which is possession based and aimed at spreading teams thin by moving wing to wing, then creating chances from the wingers cutting in and combining with Keane. Zardes doesn't do that.  The Galaxy don't get behind the lines or cross over them: they beat teams between them.  Lletget is proving to be the perfect example of the modern winger. He cuts inside, getd tons of touches in the final third, creates shots for others, is good 1 v 1 and is always attacking goal. He's like a Robben in that regard. Lletget also covers defensively. Like 3-4 actions a game. That's incredibly important and often overlooked. I absolutely love me some Villarreal as evidenced by my many articles on him but he's not quite on Lletget's level yet although he has the potential to get there.   People forget just how well regarded Lletget was before his career went to die in England like so many others. He is the best player of his youth generation and he's finally at a place where he can play and develop. Now we're finally seeing him do at the club level what he's been doing at the US youth level for so long. Villarreal is a great player and probably a lock starter on over 3/4ths of MLS teams but Lletget's the type of talent that had he made a move to the Galaxy 3 years ago, I firmly believe he would have been a starter in the 2014 world cup. Lletget is an incredible talent.  In terms of what Gio is, Gio isn't really a forward so much as he's a playmaker who is comfortable playing under a striker. Problem is, Keane does the same thing (as does Villarreal). Donovan was rather similar although he was a good counter forward as well. Although Gio is effective when playing from these withdrawn positions, he doesn't actually have to start in them to play there. Donovan was our inside playmaker last year and he did so from the wing. Lletget is currently doing the same thing. Like Donovan, Gio also has the ability to beat people outside, opening inside space so when the ball in reset to Juni centrally, Keane and Zardes have space to work with. Gio fits the system perfectly and he's not unfamiliar with playing as a winger in his career."
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,AnalAttackProbe,3,Tue Jul 7 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"People are getting excited. As they should.  This is our Best XI, in my opinion:  Penedo; AJDLG, Omar, Leo, Rogers; Juni, Gerrard, dos Santos, Lletget; Keane, Zardes  This is our depth chart, realistically:    Position/Role 1st String 2nd String 3rd String    Goalkeeper Jaime Penedo Brian Rowe Andrew Wolverton   Right Back AJ DeLaGarza Dan Gargan Oscar Sorto   Center Back 1 Omar Gonzalez AJ DeLaGarza Tommy Meyer   Center Back 2 Leonardo AJ DeLaGarza Tommy Meyer   Left Back Robbie Rogers Oscar Sorto Todd Dunivant   Defensive Mid Juninho Baggio Husidic Kenney Walker   Box-to-Box Mid Steven Gerrard Baggio Husidic Mika Vayrynen   Right Wing Giovani dos Santos Sebastian Lletget Bradford Jamieson   Left Wing Sebastian Lletget Jose Villarreal Nacho Maganto   Second Striker Robbie Keane Giovani dos Santos Jose Villarreal   Target Man Gyasi Zardes Alan Gordon Jose Villarreal    ...Or, if you need a visual: Here"
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"Leo starting, AJ as a rightback, and Gargan on the bench? That D doesn't seem right to me."
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,fizzlebuns,2,Tue Jul 7 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"Leonardo has improved immensely since he started here. He gets slagged off based on reputation, nothing more. We saw how badly we needed his height/strength when San Jose bullied us to the tune of 3-1 with AJ at center back.  In that scenario Gargan moves to the bench to make way for AJ, who is better."
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,AnalAttackProbe,2,Tue Jul 7 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Leonardo has improved, but he still does that one thing per game that can only be described as boneheaded."
LAGalaxy,3ce4fg,gcm3reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"At one point in his career you would have been thankful to hear that even possible.  Point is: he is getting better and better and you cannot undervalue his strength and presence as a CB. AJ is smart and capable, but SJ exposed his weakness: he's just too small to be a reliable CB."
LAGalaxy,3ccn6v,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:41:13 2015 UTC,"Well deserved, he absolutely destroyed Toronto."

LAGalaxy,3ccu9f,purplecorazon,3,Mon Jul 6 23:42:50 2015 UTC,That's not real is it? Wtf is that
LAGalaxy,3cb92j,AnalAttackProbe,4,Mon Jul 6 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"As much as I love those stats, they are massively misleading. Lletget is really good, but let's be honest, he's benefited greatly from not being the only good player on his team. Giovinco is the only good player besides Cheyrou when Bradley and Jozy are gone. All of Toronto's attack goes through him, so it is fairly simple to mark him into oblivion. If you do that to Lletget, you have Keane, Villareal, Husidic, Ishi :(, and a couple others who will make you pay dearly."
LAGalaxy,3cb92j,fizzlebuns,3,Mon Jul 6 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Giovinco seemed a class above everyone else on Saturday, though his team was so bad that his efforts were wasted."
LAGalaxy,3cb92j,k4mufc99,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"He really was impressive, but enough can't be said about how we defended against Toronto. They were so overwhelmed in midfield that they resorted to long balls over the top for Giovinco to chase. Not an easy task for him with AJDLG chasing him around all night."
LAGalaxy,3cb92j,fizzlebuns,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:51:59 2015 UTC,Sure but Jozy and MB90 left this week and these stats are from the season so far. If this is misleading in any way it is due to Lletget's much smaller sample size.
LAGalaxy,3cb92j,LordOfBTs,3,Mon Jul 6 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"True, but really, the big difference is the teams they play on. Toronto is a dumpster fire and even at our worst, we were better than most of the East. If they were to switch teams, those stats would be nowhere near similar."
LAGalaxy,3cb92j,LordOfBTs,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome stats comparison. Where is this from, and would I be able to compare players from different leagues?"
LAGalaxy,3c7d5r,rmckenzie721,4,Sun Jul 5 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"“What I was thinking,” Lletget said, “was if I miss this, Robbie's going to be screaming in my face. So it was like an extra focus: 'I have to score this or I'm going to get obliterated.'”   Robbie going KG on guys again."
LAGalaxy,3c6kmc,withtaste,3,Sun Jul 5 09:01:43 2015 UTC,"I really hope this happens, but I'm torn because I don't want us losing Zardes in the process somehow..."
LAGalaxy,3c6kmc,Viperking5,2,Sun Jul 5 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Don't know why we would... we can stick Gio up top and move Zardes to wing, or we can stick Zardes up top and put Gio on the wing. There are plenty of ways to keep both in the lineup."
LAGalaxy,3c6kmc,AnalAttackProbe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"Oh no I understand that, but with the salary cap I hope we don't go over."
LAGalaxy,3c6kmc,Viperking5,5,Sun Jul 5 19:15:18 2015 UTC,"Well, we just freed up another $200k with Ishizaki leaving. We have a ton of allocation money saved up to push Omar down to ""Core Player"" status. I think we've got enough money to make it work.  Gio isn't on an outrageous salary at Villarreal, either. He's making like $2m a year. Sure, he'll probably get a bump in pay once he gets here, but he's still only going to cost $435k against the cap like all other DPs."
LAGalaxy,3c6kmc,AnalAttackProbe,2,Sun Jul 5 19:17:53 2015 UTC,"Oh nice! Yeah I didn't know that, I'm not to familiar with salaries and all that good stuff."

LAGalaxy,3c65dm,burbod01,-3,Sun Jul 5 07:04:18 2015 UTC,I'm with you - seems like a lot of fans liked him and I have no idea why. His service is absolutely atrocious. He and Keane had no chemistry whatsoever and often looked very frustrated playing near one another. And he had an awful strike rate.   Bye.

LAGalaxy,3c3t6p,purplecorazon,5,Sat Jul 4 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"He has said that he wouldn't consider going anywhere where there was any chance of playing against Liverpool. I think his main factors for going to LA are the fact that its a nice place for his family, it's an easy to settle into English speaking country and he'd be away from Europe and the chance of tarnishing the legacy he has at Liverpool."

There's not much that we can do about that short of sending the guy(s) he replaces on loan or letting them fight for a rotation role, but it's not as though we're talking about an aging foreign star coming to play out the last 2-3 years of his career here.   Dos Santos is nearly two years younger than Giovinco and a regular on the Mexican national team. He's exactly the type of player LA have coveted from the very beginning. So, assuming all goes right and he's not a flop, how big a deal would it be if he bumps someone out of the lineup?

LAGalaxy,3bstfg,burbod01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:52:23 2015 UTC,As a spurs supporter I have always been co fused by gio. He is an exceptionally skilled player and always steps up when he plays for Mexico. With spurs there was just never a fit. Maybe it's that Harry redknapp and his FRAAB approach were bad for a young player looking to define his identity in a foreign country. Or maybe he was just the victim of Sandro and bale being transcendent players all at the same time and leaving little patience for him to find his game. I'll never know for sure but I do hope if he comes he plays like he does for el tri.  That said how crowded is our midfield going to become?
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,RodJohnsonSays,10,Thu Jul 2 00:36:55 2015 UTC,Not a chance in hell. The Galaxy are my MLS team
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,gambit700,9,Thu Jul 2 00:55:44 2015 UTC,Although I haven't become a full on Galaxy fan yet (still trying to adjust after Chivas USA folded) I am positive that I don't want to support a team that will be a pain in the ass to drive to. For example the drive from my pad to StubHub Center is about a12-16 minute drive. The drive from my pad to LAFC's stadium site will be a much longer drive that I prefer not to do.
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,JuniorCDC,2,Thu Jul 2 02:20:24 2015 UTC,That Metrolink though - that's the seller for me
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,MontyMidas,3,Thu Jul 2 17:32:28 2015 UTC,It'll be cool taking the metro when the Galaxy take on LAFC.

I grew up in a state that has no major league professional teams so I didn't grow up experiencing what it's like to have a team everyone rallies behind. I just liked to watch all the teams play. I have that same mentality today and only got season tickets because I wanted to watch a lot of live soccer and the Galaxy were the best game in town.   My switch will be purely due to convenience since I live in DTLA, two blocks from a metro station and ~2.5 miles from the proposed stadium. I might even ride my bike to a few games.  I'll still watch the Galaxy on TV."
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,MontyMidas,5,Thu Jul 2 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"I used to go to games with a buddy of mine and his brothers. Just single game tickets and we'd alternate sitting with ACB or Riot Squad. They've been season ticket holders for a while now.     The reasons I've switched over are      This an opportunity of a lifetime to provide input in a club and build something we all want, and I've seen it happen before first-hand with my hometown team,  the Western Sydney Wanderers from the Hyundai A-League in Australia.    Transport. I can ride my bike or even walk to the train station, catch the metro  to the games. Easy, no traffic, no parking fee, no scratched car from butthurt fans and there's probably more to do in dtla than there is at the subway/fatburger down the street from stubhub.   Dat supporters section.     Anyone angry about losing Galaxy fans to this, who says you're bound to a team? What if you never had a choice and now this is the alternative you've been waiting for?"
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,SFluff,2,Thu Jul 2 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. This club has my heart. I'll be moving to Cincinnati next April, and whenever I go to Columbus for a game it'll be in my Galaxy jersey."

LAGalaxy,3bth4s,elephantangelchild,4,Sat Jul 4 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"I am down for season ticket deposits at LAFC.  I've never been a season ticket holder for the Galaxy and make it out to one or two games a year.  If LAFC gets that stadium near downtown, its going to be great to be able to take metro down there and not pay 15 dollars for parking  and have to deal with all that (all that=Carson).  Also, it sounds fun to be on the ground floor of something.  Also, I plan on selling more than 50% of the tickets on the secondary market. Hopefully they'll sign some stupid big players and that and the new stadium will make a very attractive ticket and I'll make some money.  Still be a Galaxy fan though.... probably."
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,burbod01,3,Thu Jul 2 01:01:05 2015 UTC,Is the stadium where the sports arena currently is a go?
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,elephantangelchild,4,Thu Jul 2 01:06:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not a final definite thing I guess, but they announced thats where it is going to be and I guess they have a deal with USC.  You can tell that I am uncomfortable being an authority on this subject but the words I said reflect the impression in my head.  it's obviously not 100% until the damn thing is built."
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,burbod01,2,Thu Jul 2 01:09:15 2015 UTC,Yeah that's always a worry.  I wish teams would start with securing a stadium.  I'm assuming the whole appeal of LAFC is that it won't be on the outskirts (Carson) and will be the CITY's team.  I have a feeling they will end up in Dodger Stadium or some bullshit.
LAGalaxy,3bth4s,MontyMidas,2,Thu Jul 2 01:18:59 2015 UTC,Highly doubt dodged stadium. It's going to be the Sports Arena.

LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,AnalAttackProbe,10,Tue Jun 30 16:18:40 2015 UTC,Rule change just announced....no way will we lose Omar.  Rule Change
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,hedyedy,4,Tue Jun 30 21:45:17 2015 UTC,Can you do me a solid and explain the DP mechanism? I've been seeing that term used all over reddit and Twitter but don't know what it is.
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,AnalAttackProbe,12,Tue Jun 30 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"Well, its a bit confusing, but:  Each MLS team is allowed three Designated Players (DPs), which can be paid however much the team and the player agree to, while only counting as $435k toward the salary cap (each team only has $4.1m to spend). Currently, LA has the max of three designated players: Omar Gonzalez ($1.25m), Robbie Keane ($6m), and the incoming Steven Gerrard ($6m).  So unless MLS changes its DP rules to either accommodate a 4th DP, or bring Omar under the DP threshold, they do not have the space to sign dos Santos.  Now, there have been rumors going around for a few months that MLS is working on a ""core player"" contract, which works like a DP contract, but is only meant to be used on players who have been exclusively with the club they are currently with-- meaning nobody transferring in from Europe (like Keane, dos Santos or Gerrard) can be a ""core player"", but Omar, who has played his entire career in LA, can be.  We don't know what will happen, but some mechanism will have to change if we want to sign Giovani.  EDIT: I hope that makes sense. I'm not sure even MLS officials understand these terrible, convoluted rules."
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,cuthman99,7,Tue Jun 30 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"""I'm not sure even MLS officials understand these terrible convoluted rules.""  I feel pretty confident you're right about that. If anyone claims to actually understand them, I call bullshit. Besides... we all know that when it comes right down to it, Garber just makes up some new shit off the top of his head. It's basically like when I was six years old and played ""Fort"" with my brother. We had rules, sure... until one of them inconvenienced me."

LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,alessandro_o_d,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt. Twellman was actually the first to report at the end of last season that the league office was studying the merits of a fourth DP slot, and others jumped on this rumor during the CBA negotiations with suggestions that there could be as many as 2-3 mini-DP slots in the future. It would be odd not to see some version of this proposed rule eventually, but there's been no word yet when it'd be implemented."

LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,cuthman99,3,Tue Jun 30 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"Gio would immediately be our best option at striker, honestly."

LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,cuthman99,7,Tue Jun 30 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"It would mean that Gyasi is making a permanent switch to midfield. Dos Santos would be playing beside Keane for a year or two, then we'd likely replace Keane's DP slot with a DP mid, upon Keano's retirement."
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,tega234,3,Tue Jun 30 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right about how it would play out. But I don't know that I would like that series of developments. Besides, I think at this point Zardes is potentially headed toward DP territory in a few years' time (not saying he's there yet). I just think Dos Santos takes up more space than we ought to be committing.   On the other hand, the general caveat is that I'm an idiot and almost always wrong."
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,cuthman99,3,Tue Jun 30 18:15:13 2015 UTC,He plays midfield for the National Team to no?
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,Viperking5,2,Tue Jun 30 19:29:50 2015 UTC,"He's bounced around. But yeah, I'm pretty sure we've seen him out wide left for the Nats."
LAGalaxy,3bn7bm,SocalGirl19,4,Tue Jun 30 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm the only one hyped about this signing, even if it may not be true. Dos Santos is a phenomenal player, in my book ranks way higher than Hernandez for Mexico.   Keane and Dos Santos at the front with Gerrards passing will be something truly amazing to watch. What I hope doesn't happen though is we don't get rid of Zardes, he has the potential to develop into an amazing player and I would hate to see him leave."

Do ignore attendants telling/directing you where to park if you want to park somewhere else in the same lot (either around other people, or shade, or nearer to the stadium/whatever). They started doing this guided parking bullshit couple weeks ago but I ignore them after I get to my lot, and just go to my normal spot. Just dodge any cones they have set up.  Because no re-admittance to the stadium, scope out the nearby portable toilet locations once you park, especially if you're going to be there a while or have kids (or both).  Smile, agree, then ignore, the ""Tailgating Ambassadors"" or parking personnel who tell you to move your setup - unless you actually are blocking another parking spot or the driving lane. Someone tried to tell me I had to move my whole setup (table, grill, chairs, cooler) to a spot twenty feet from my car before the Philly game even though I wasn't in the way of anyone/anything, and we weren't sticking out into the driving lane. After arguing with them for a bit, I just agreed to move, let them drive off, and then stayed put.  It's a lot of fun and great people. Don't hesitate to park near someone else and introduce yourself - and don't be shy about sharing/offering your food/drink and being willing to try what other people may offer you. I've had the most amazing freshly made guac and salsa from someone I just met, and is now a semi-regular tailgating companion.  Have fun and don't get too drunk!"

LAGalaxy,3baquz,AnalAttackProbe,2,Sat Jun 27 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"Well, to you and me, it is, but not everyone may be equally aware. FWIW, it is the first time Arena actually has stated for the record that they were in pursuit of Lampard, which I would think is a little more noteworthy than just a rumor.  But as for Lampard calling MLS a retirement league, that would be the first I'm hearing of this. Do you have a source? I know full well that Ashley Cole had some negative things to say at the time as did Jose Mourinho and even Gerrard, but I don't believe Lamps himself made similar remarks."
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,AnalAttackProbe,10,Fri Jun 26 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"What a great signing. You really have to give credit to our scouting team! I had no idea this guy when existed a month ago and now he is not only starting, but dominating/terrorizing. With Gerard to start playing in roughly a month and Keane back we look downright frightening again. Huge change from the very beginning of the season. I had some very serious doubts about this season initially, but it looks like we are back to our normal high level. Watch out MLS!"
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,checkyourbaditude,4,Fri Jun 26 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"What will really be interesting to see is how teams start to gameplan for us once we add Gerrard. I either read somewhere or heard from one of the game commentators that the lack of scouting intel on Lletget is just as significant to his recent good form as his technical ability, and one of our players who benefited from this same kind of uncertainty last year was Zardes.  But this year, we've had so many lineups changes that opponents really don't know who (or what) to expect. Lletget is but only the most recent player out of a list that includes Villarreal, Jamieson, and Maganto to positively impact a match for us. And before teams get comfortable scouting him, we shift around the attack a little more and add Gerrard.   There's just so much more technical ability on this team now than anybody can keep up with. Even us."
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,purplecorazon,3,Fri Jun 26 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"I either read somewhere or heard from one of the game commentators that the lack of scouting intel on Lletget is just as significant to his recent good form as his technical ability, and one of our players who benefited from this same kind of uncertainty last year was Zardes.   Don't quote me on this but I think it was mentioned in the Corner of the Galaxy podcast, no clue if Josh was the one who said it first though"
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,Breklinho,6,Sat Jun 27 10:40:15 2015 UTC,"Juninho has been on fire lately too.  I mean, he's usually consistently good, but I feel like he his play has been much improved lately.    Hopefully we can find a way to keep Villarreal and Lletget on the field at the same time, even if it means benching Ishizaki (who might be playing the best he ever has in a Galaxy kit?).  Shit's heating up, its pretty fucking exciting."
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,elephantangelchild,2,Fri Jun 26 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"I've thought Ishizaki's been very underwhelming this year, he's done better over the past gamer or two but all in all I haven't seen much from him"
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,Breklinho,5,Sat Jun 27 10:41:05 2015 UTC,That Lletget is so hot right now.
LAGalaxy,3b7r2y,Obligatius,4,Fri Jun 26 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"The young guns have been fun to watch this year. Lletget, Villarreal, Maganto, Jamieson IV! Loving the future."
LAGalaxy,3b4gvu,AnalAttackProbe,12,Thu Jun 25 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"So many intros. Hello on July 4th, first match against Club America, first MLS game on the 17th..."
LAGalaxy,3b4gvu,withtaste,15,Thu Jun 25 23:38:23 2015 UTC,That is not right. Introducing a Red Coat on Freedom Day? What is up with that?
LAGalaxy,3b4gvu,j3zuz00,2,Fri Jun 26 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, do people not know he's British?"
LAGalaxy,3b4gvu,alexalexthehuman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Scousers are more Irish than English anyway."
LAGalaxy,3b4gvu,I647,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:24:14 2015 UTC,"Really? Didn't know that, do they speak Irish in Liverpool also?"
LAGalaxy,3b4gvu,Viperking5,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:39:03 2015 UTC,First time that I ever have tickets to two league games back to back. Will be eager to see just how the supporters welcome him.
LAGalaxy,3b3ajm,AnalAttackProbe,4,Thu Jun 25 16:52:56 2015 UTC,The rainbow streamers were a nice touch too.
LAGalaxy,3b3ajm,Joola,3,Thu Jun 25 21:47:21 2015 UTC,I was there.........this was awesome!!  ACB is the Best!!!
LAGalaxy,3b3ajm,dangarcia0523,2,Thu Jun 25 20:25:00 2015 UTC,That's classy.  Love it.  I wish we were half as organized over in LARS.

LAGalaxy,3b2up0,cerebrix,4,Thu Jun 25 14:55:53 2015 UTC,Nice!  I'm going to buy a Lletget kit sometime soon. He is the real deal.
LAGalaxy,3b2up0,AnalAttackProbe,3,Thu Jun 25 15:38:02 2015 UTC,"rookie year, training kit somehow seemed fitting for this year.  but yeah, your education on all things hammers gave me a heads up way ahead of time =p"
LAGalaxy,3b2up0,Gecko5567,3,Thu Jun 25 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"I gotta admit after our performances at the beginning of the season I was pretty worried about how we would do this year, but in typical Galaxy fashion we've started to kick ass when it matters. And after seeing Lleget, I'm super excited for the future of this team with all of this talented young blood."
LAGalaxy,3b2up0,elephantangelchild,3,Thu Jun 25 16:33:58 2015 UTC,When Gerrard gets here where does Lletget play?  I assume on the left wing to replace Husidic?  Is he any good on the wing?  Or is he just going to ride the bench and help us in CCL and Open Cup games?
LAGalaxy,3b2up0,AnalAttackProbe,4,Thu Jun 25 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"someone posted a fantastic 4-5-1 that would have him consistently in the lineup.  we have so many options and so much depth now, i just dont see bruce being as rigid 4-4-2 as he used to be.  i think he was cause he had to be.  now he doesnt.  i think the team has more depth now than it ever has."
LAGalaxy,3b2up0,mystimel,2,Thu Jun 25 19:40:30 2015 UTC,At this rate there is no way you keep Lletget out of the lineup. Bench Husidic or Ishizaki and push Seba out wide.
LAGalaxy,3b1m0c,AnalAttackProbe,5,Thu Jun 25 06:06:11 2015 UTC,Shoutout to /u/jdtrinh for the ticket. He hooked me up.
LAGalaxy,3b1m0c,Jdtrinh,4,Thu Jun 25 06:16:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for not letting the ticket go to waste! Great game!
LAGalaxy,3b1m0c,Obligatius,3,Thu Jun 25 06:19:03 2015 UTC,"Nice camera work. I had just gotten up from my seat, and taken a couple steps up the stairs before turning to watch just in time to catch the kick! What an awesome end to that game!"
LAGalaxy,3b1m0c,hedyedy,3,Thu Jun 25 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"Contrary to Taylor Twellman's comment about the Timber's line (which was spot on), Villarreal's kick went completely around the wall by a few feet and just into the corner. It was ridiculous! (as twellman is known to say). No defense could have stopped it.  Bend-it like Villarreal!"
LAGalaxy,3b1m0c,cerebrix,2,Thu Jun 25 15:59:42 2015 UTC,shit dude you were sitting right by me.  im in 135
LAGalaxy,3b1m0c,cerebrix,2,Thu Jun 25 15:10:09 2015 UTC,/u/jdtrinh and I were in 136. Looking right down the end line.

LAGalaxy,3b1m8c,raija2k,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:32:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Robbie Rogers, it was due!  Edit: Added Rogers so as not to be confused with Keane"
LAGalaxy,3b1krs,AnalAttackProbe,6,Thu Jun 25 05:52:19 2015 UTC,I'm seeing the boys vs. the Earthquakes up in the Bay area on Saturday. Couldn't be more hyped after these last two games!
LAGalaxy,3b1krs,Orange_Urge,4,Thu Jun 25 05:57:42 2015 UTC,They were outstanding tonight. They've been outstanding this week.  Really rounding into form. Lletget is very impressive live.
LAGalaxy,3b1krs,TCzelusniak,3,Thu Jun 25 06:07:32 2015 UTC,"Ok so Lletget, absolute monster tonight. Has yet to really dissapoint me, but in all fairness I've seen half the games I wanted to this season so far. But, what's his odds on getting Sr team minutes? Right now it's Bedoya who he'd compete with for a spot right? I can see a call up coming post gold cup if he keeps this up."
LAGalaxy,3b1krs,purplecorazon,2,Thu Jun 25 06:28:01 2015 UTC,"Well, he's only 22, so he has plenty of time.  I think right now he's at least deserving of January camp next year. His form is out of this world. He could very easily become a major player on the national team if he keeps this up.  People need to remember he trained with a Premier League FIRST TEAM at 17 years old. He is legitimately an outstanding, well-rounded player. Him falling out with the first team at West Ham had nothing to do with him and everything to do with a coaching change.  At this rate I just hope we can keep him for a significant amount of time. I love him kissing the badge, that was great."
LAGalaxy,3b0cei,AnalAttackProbe,2,Wed Jun 24 23:13:24 2015 UTC,I like it. Though its not as good as the others.

LAGalaxy,3b0cei,j3zuz00,2,Thu Jun 25 02:06:31 2015 UTC,They both appear to be mid poop.
LAGalaxy,3b0xmr,purplecorazon,2,Thu Jun 25 02:11:44 2015 UTC,Line-ups available here. Looks like Bruce is hoping that playing his first choice XI will give them the lead early and allow them to sit some guys after the first half. Probably can't disagree too much with his reasoning there.
