Hatfilms,3e3jev,OV102,61,Tue Jul 21 18:03:15 2015 UTC,I found myself on the edge of my seat for every goal! This is some quality content and I'm loving every second lads! Keep it up! I want more of the mixer!
Hatfilms,3e3jev,Zylf,10,Tue Jul 21 18:29:38 2015 UTC,Now I know how normies feel when watching football.
Hatfilms,3e3jev,iFlameLife,2,Tue Jul 21 22:53:55 2015 UTC,Best game the lads have played to date.  10/10 would bang Trott

Hatfilms,3e3jev,sadpear,20,Wed Jul 22 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"So much energy from smith and Ross! I love seeing the lads pumped about something like this, it's amazing to watch!"
Hatfilms,3e3jev,Zylf,28,Tue Jul 21 18:57:49 2015 UTC,"This is quality content right here. Really hoping to see more of this!  FYI: Squall is one of the names for the AI bots. That's why he immediately joined when an opponent disconnected, and left when a replacement connected. They're really good too, as you saw with that hattrick."

Hatfilms,3e3jev,smibbs_,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not saying he was perfect, or even good.   But go back and watch the havin' a bash episode - Ross was utterly useless in that one. Here he actually contributed a lot, even if he did miss the ball"
Hatfilms,3e3jev,RichardVagino,2,Tue Jul 21 20:04:48 2015 UTC,PUT IT IN THE FUCKING MIXER
Hatfilms,3e3jev,Devonty,13,Wed Jul 22 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"If Youtube ever goes belly up, I think Trott, Ross, and Smith could definitely make it as football commentators."

Hatfilms,3e3jev,ebayzo,7,Tue Jul 21 19:24:59 2015 UTC,Oh god that was intense. I love you guys playing this game. The best parts were 18:08 and 21:33 I love how into the game Ross gets.... This was amazing please do more of this... :D

Hatfilms,3e3jev,stray_kiwi,2,Tue Jul 21 19:21:26 2015 UTC,I would love waking up every morning to the sound of Ross screaming at me to move forward
Hatfilms,3e3jev,TheGingerSoul,6,Tue Jul 21 21:48:50 2015 UTC,I genuinely can't tell if they know they're playing almost entirely against bots or not
Hatfilms,3e3jev,Spivsy,5,Tue Jul 21 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"This series is amazing ! So much tension going into every goal, really dynamic pace, it makes up for some quality content mate !"
Hatfilms,3e3jev,superfrenchdude,4,Tue Jul 21 19:37:49 2015 UTC,Please stick more of these videos into the mixer!
Hatfilms,3e3jev,gnomic_fox,4,Tue Jul 21 19:49:09 2015 UTC,The build up to that final goal was so intense!
Hatfilms,3e3jev,joeyalexdavies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"I wish they would remember there is no out of bounds. So when the ball comes towards your own goal hit it as hard as possible towards your own end, bounce it off the wall, then turn around and play it to theirs. Its a lot easier than trying to dribble it out or carefully defend."

Hatfilms,3e3jev,serjonsnow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:33 2015 UTC,Team Hat should trade Trott for Squall. It would really improve their game.
Hatfilms,3e3jev,ScaryBilbo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:23:04 2015 UTC,They need to live stream this at least for the reaction value.

Hatfilms,3dutcz,Tamraj,10,Sun Jul 19 18:10:44 2015 UTC,what's with uploading old stunt lads material lately?
Hatfilms,3dutcz,Slavic_Genghis,18,Sun Jul 19 18:51:54 2015 UTC,I may be wrong but I think it was stuff they put together before there US trip to use as filler till they got back. I know there back home now this was probably leftover and decided to use it up.
Hatfilms,3dutcz,danjono,7,Sun Jul 19 19:00:58 2015 UTC,More likely to cater for the new subscribers who have found Hat Films through Stunt Lads Show as it's now been featured by Rockstar. Having a montage of their past shenanigans will show the newbies what else they do in GTA
Hatfilms,3dutcz,hewlett777,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:13:43 2015 UTC,Twice the views for the same shit I guess. It's not like anyone can just look at their previous uploads so they have to upload another video of their previous videos.
Hatfilms,3dutcz,The-Magical-Moose,0,Mon Jul 20 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"Watching this makes me hope that the 5 of them find a new game soon to just mess around in like this. More GTA would be great of course, but they've probably exhausted most of the things that you can do in the game by now. It'd be nice (if the Hats, Sips and Turps' schedules align) to see them maybe try a new (possibly sandbox) game every 2 weeks/month or something. For example, they could try Red Dead Redemption, Saints Row, Just Cause 2 (though I've never tried the PC multiplayer mod so I'm not sure how stable it is) and maybe even go back to survival games like the DayZ series they did ages ago."
Hatfilms,3dutcz,Nicksaurus,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"JC2 multiplayer is stable enough, but the problem is that there are absolutely zero NPCs because they haven't been able to get the AI working over mutiplayer or something."

Stale is the word that comes to mind   Each video used to be non stop laughs with James and Bruce providing witty banter while Adam struggles through whatever piece of shit they were playing. Funny recurring  jokes that weren't overused, and the inclusion of other people sometimes   Nowadays, it seems(to me) that each video consists of them saying the same things over and over. Eg, replacing ever characters name with John. ""Hey, let's call this guy JOHN CHROME hahaha, we've never done that before!"" ""We found a glitch in the game? Better laugh about it for 5 minutes! ""  Those are a few examples of what I mean. The series they do is alos not as good as it was. All the good/fun games are gone on Steam roulette, the art and comment shows are sub par, spooles 1dollar 1 hour thing is just... Unnecessary, and the podcast feels so different from what it used to be, I can't place my finger on it  So that's why I don't like them. Then again, I stopped watching about 2 months ago, so maybe the content has gotten better. I can see why people still enjoy them, just not my cup of tea atm"

Hatfilms,3dnr7s,mizstuck,16,Sat Jul 18 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"Very annoyed that we got to see very little of hat films, no reaction to them running off at the start and realising they shouldn't of left, no trotts reaction when he gets hit for having a jet pack (still don't know why) or no smithy goading on Ross to beat the shit out of sips (you know it happened) just a little bit of trott because they all where in the same channel for the quests and making a wall, i don't even know why it isn't on seperate channels, people are saying there learning from cornerstone, hat films doesn't work well with cutting in and out, there's long tangents and just random bullshit.  I will still watch this as I enjoy sips and Lewis and sjin but it just felt like it was just me watching the main channel PoV and hat films one wasn't released yet.  Hat films has its fans who would rather watch there full PoV, flux buddies plus Hannah have there fans who would rather watch there PoV, I'd say give people the option to view who they want and not be forced to watch a PoV that they might not enjoy.  No tin foil hat but the hats humour don't go down well with majority of fans on the main channel so there not going to get as much coverage."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,SirRockNRolla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:50:24 2015 UTC,"maybe they'll get more focus in later episodes? maybe next episode will focus more on flux, next on the hats, and so on in some rough order. let's be patient and see how this plays out. it's only been one episode after all."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,HomespunMurderStory,4,Sun Jul 19 14:29:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand, some people don't like watching hats, some don't like watching flux, some don't like watching Lewis, sips and sjin.  People don't want to watch the group or people they don't want to watch and some want to see the whole flux buddies or hat films POV instead of the small snippets they got because it's not about the thing there doing it's about the chemistry    If there's more hat films/flux buddies/sjipos then the other groups the other groups fans will complain and as a hat films fan I was hugely disappointed by there showing and more disappointed by not being able to see there perspective, hat films doesn't work well in a in and out approach because there's a lot of stuff that just won't make sense if it's cut in and out because they can talk about trotts small ween or something just random for five minutes.  People want to see the bullshit that's in between the cuts and I feel like that's where hat films shine and that's why people enjoy hat films and I feel a lot of hat films fans are the ones complaining about not seeing there side"
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,SirRockNRolla,17,Sun Jul 19 15:24:04 2015 UTC,"I wish they had released this in the same format as Cornerstone.   So I could watch the perspective that I want to watch, as apposed to what the editor thinks is interesting. HatFilms were only in this video for like 30 seconds."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,Haddy95,13,Sat Jul 18 03:00:49 2015 UTC,"Precisely the problem I have with it.   I love the combination of Lewis, Sips, and Sjin, but I hate having to sacrifice huge chunks of Hat Films footage just to see them."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,serjonsnow,5,Sat Jul 18 03:29:30 2015 UTC,Maybe after this episode they will split off on to their own channels. Who knows at this point though.
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,bicoezbluntkid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"One can only hope. Though it seems unlikely, as they would have to put the videos on each other's channels and then the series would seem to start a few episodes in.  Surprisingly, in the Youtube comments and in the thread on /r/Yogscast, viewer feedback on the format seems mostly positive. Apparently a lot of people didn't like that Cornerstone videos weren't edited together."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,Thunderbeak,15,Sat Jul 18 06:56:36 2015 UTC,I don't get it. I wouldn't have bothered to watch a combined cornerstone because to put it bluntly I do not care about watching any pov except Hat Films. So much of Hat Films fabulousness would have been cut out if it had been combined like it's being cut out in this series.  Honestly I think opinions will drop quickly. People are currently just excited about a new Minecraft thing.
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,AwfulWaffleWalker,4,Sat Jul 18 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"that's basically exactly how i feel,i only ever watched the hat films pov in cornerstone beacuse that's how i found out about it and honestly,i prefer the humour and banter of the sirs then i did most of the other teams in cornerstone.  im sure there'll be some people who are just happy to see some of their favourite yogs in a series on the main channel,and some who like this format,which is fine,i'm just personally not one of those people"
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,KingOfElysium,9,Sat Jul 18 07:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not one of those people either. It just seems like such a waste of recording time for them with how little they get included. I mean same thing happened in the last gmod race where the videos mostly only showed Sips & Sjin and Duncan & Lewis with very little of Hat Films."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,AwfulWaffleWalker,8,Sat Jul 18 08:28:13 2015 UTC,Especially considering how exhausted they said they were after recording this new series for 2 days straight.   Seems like a bit of a kick in the teeth to have them in it so little.
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,serjonsnow,5,Sat Jul 18 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"i know,it's like why are you having two other teams recording if your basically cutting a huge chunk of their footage and only showing us 30 second snippets of it at a time if the series is mainly just going to be team Sjipos,it honestly seems like the main focus throughout the series,whilest it's obviously got a team vs team vs team format,will be on the (mis)adventures of lewis,sjin and the french horn loving sips.  honestly,it makes me wonder why the others are there tbh,im not saying that it's a bad thing though,i love any chance i get to see more of the sirs,but this is something i may wind up giving a miss unless they allow the other channels to have their povs."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,KingOfElysium,5,Sat Jul 18 10:07:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. I'll see what happens the next episode, but if it's like the first I won't be bothering with it cause anything worth seeing involving the Sirs will come up elsewhere."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,AwfulWaffleWalker,2,Sat Jul 18 11:03:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure people's mood will change. The way it is now, Sips and Sjin get most of the attention which a lot of people like (I don't)."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,Thunderbeak,2,Sat Jul 18 08:26:56 2015 UTC,True. A lot of people on the yogs subreddits have been wanting more Sips and Sjin for awhile.
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,AwfulWaffleWalker,8,Sat Jul 18 08:30:26 2015 UTC,"I loved the way Cornerstone was. I think they should have it both ways, because some people will want to see it all"
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,bicoezbluntkid,7,Sat Jul 18 07:04:27 2015 UTC,"needs a LOT more of the sirs,cornerstone was amazing beacuse we had a choice of which POV to watch,and as i only even knew about cornerstone beacuse of the sirs,i mainly watched and very much enjoyed their pov.  not being able to hear their witty banter unless it's a 30 second snippet and then going back to the main focus which pretty much was the antics of team Sjipos was kinda slightly bad imo,i'd have enjoyed it a lot more having had a choice of which pov to watch."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,KingOfElysium,2,Sat Jul 18 07:49:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, Sips. Derpulies sure picked the wrong guy to mess with."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,strongbadse,3,Sat Jul 18 09:29:54 2015 UTC,"Well, at least I know I'm not alone in disliking it so far for the editing style here."
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,TheLoneEnderman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:03 2015 UTC,Looks pretty funny so far. Kind of reminds me of the old series in the early days. I think there's something inherently funny about non talking (chat only) characters being involved.
Hatfilms,3dnr7s,xray606,0,Sat Jul 18 09:02:57 2015 UTC,"I eventually got around to watching the episode.  I did genuinely enjoy it, with the Sirs having some good moments and Sips trolling an increasingly irate Lewis. Having said that, I would prefer a format more similar to Cornerstone in that there are multiple POVs on different channels. I do get, however, that it means more editing which may be quite boring for the creators, particularly if views aren't necessarily so high.  On the plus side, they said they were doing a fair bit of recording for it, so I hope they'll appear in a bit more soon enough."

Hatfilms,3dnqxd,WhitePawn00,6,Sat Jul 18 09:57:51 2015 UTC,"okay here's my idea.  1) use sticky bombs, grenades, what the fuck not in a shit race like the first. Or at least do contact. While there were some fuck ups in that race, it was all in one spot. GTA races can become too much off the same thing, but don't go the complete opposite way and have a pacifist run.  2) don't use bombs/GTA race in a technical (Trials like) track. where you have to manouvre through windmills or high up in the sky.  3) Don't get out of your car.  3 simple things that would balance things out and would please most of the people."

Hatfilms,3dnqxd,Wndrlndgabby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:15 2015 UTC,Non-contact races are definitely a bit boring compared to the alternative. Maybe you could make a house-rule on Sticky bombs to make it less extreme?

Hatfilms,3djbov,CMEast,11,Thu Jul 16 20:10:46 2015 UTC,They now need multiple recordings and edits to make Trials videos. That is the cost of Smiffy's triumph.

Hatfilms,3djbov,rutiancoren,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:00:00 2015 UTC,Smiffy dominating Trott is nothing new.  RANDY
Hatfilms,3djbov,Vamprat,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"I think the reason Smiffy is now beating Trott is because no one is going to get much better by playing a track once and then moving on. The best way to improve in Trials is to play the same track over and over again until you can beat it with a couple or (hopefully) 0 faults.  You'll realize that a lot of the tracks have very similar jumps and obstacles that you are now a master at. Simply moving from one track to the next...you don't really learn much.   I doubt Trott has the time, but if he can go through a lot of hard tracks and work on getting 0 faults, and <10-20 faults on extreme tracks, he will begin to dominate again."

The game I don't watch, unless it's Stunt Lads where the visuals are very important.  If you ever feel like you need to take a break and decide to not put out a video one day I will support you fully! I have about another 1,000 videos to catch up on in any case.  Thank you for your huge commitment to your fans."
Hatfilms,3da4zs,Artiist4,18,Tue Jul 14 18:46:56 2015 UTC,I'm sure that we all love the daily videos but honestly I would be completely fine with cutting the videos down however much is necessary for the guys to stay motivated/enthusiastic/healthy etc. because the last thing I want is for the content to become stale because it seems like too much of a job to record - not naming any names but that's happened to a lot of channels I'd watched.  If that means we go from 7 videos a week down to 5 or 4 or 3 or whatever... then so be it. I'd take those videos and enjoy them so that we can have decent content for a longer period of time.
Hatfilms,3da4zs,Gearsofhalowarfare,2,Tue Jul 14 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"Well obviously. But they don't need to release a video every day to survive.

Hatfilms,3d5htj,not4u2see,9,Mon Jul 13 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"Aside from Primordial Flux from a Flux Capacitor of course, gravity itself isn't constant, it depends on the mass of the object (i.e. Earth has a stronger gravity than the moon because it has more mass). But there is a Gravitational Constant (6.67x10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2 ) which means that I suppose they were right"
Hatfilms,3d5htj,The-Magical-Moose,3,Mon Jul 13 18:57:33 2015 UTC,Gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two objects and directly proportional to the mass of those objects. The 'constant of proportionality' is the gravitational constant. I left uni (for the first time) a decade ago and that's about all the academic stuff I can remember lol.

We found them and Cannonball races better than normal races and are sorely missed from 5

Hatfilms,3cvghv,MrQuibbles,9,Sat Jul 11 02:46:50 2015 UTC,They were waiting till they got back from there vacation in the states cause they will be trying to live stream them. They should get back to them soon... :)
Hatfilms,3cvghv,Tamraj,6,Sat Jul 11 03:21:27 2015 UTC,"They are probably a bit sick of it by now, but that's not the main reason. Main reason is they were still featuring Minecraft videos (the Cornerstone series) shortly before they left for their trip to the U.S. If Minecraft videos were to go up in their absence, they would have had to prepare them beforehand. However, they were already busy preparing GTA, Worms and Trials videos to upload while they were gone. Figuring out a new Minecraft series that may or may not have lead to entertaining videos on top of that would have been too strenous.  Now that they're back, they're probably trying to figure out when and how to set up their Hat Pack livestreams. They might also try another Minecraft series in the meanwhile, but I'm not certain about that."
Hatfilms,3cvghv,Thunderbeak,7,Sat Jul 11 08:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of glad they aren't. Minecraft is way overplayed on many channels, and I'm completely burnt  out on it."

Hatfilms,3cvghv,AwfulWaffleWalker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:04:37 2015 UTC,They haven't had any time to start any Minecraft series if they intend on having any aside from hat pack streams which are most likely coming soon.

Hatfilms,3ceyxb,Gabrielsen,42,Tue Jul 7 11:43:32 2015 UTC,"Although people keep calling this 'filler' content, it actually takes a lot more time and effort to go through our old content and create 'best bits' Just thought i'd say that first because it irks me when people think a lot of time wasn't spent on it and then reduce it to just 'filler' content. A lot of people enjoy seeing these bits put together and for those who've seen our old GTA eps, hopefully they enjoy it too!  Secondly, we are on a week holiday at the moment so aren't able to record anything until we're back. We managed to record as much as we could last week to cover the time we're away. Hopefully we'll be back to normal soon. Just a little update for whoever happens upon this post."
Hatfilms,3ceyxb,djh3max,7,Tue Jul 7 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the idea that this is 'filler,' comes from the old TV show convention of having a 'flashback' or 'clip show' episode at some point in the season.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_show  The idea of creating more 'episodes' based on stock footage or old content re-purposed to something else. It meant less work for the actors... and that is where the confusion lies. You guys are both the actors and the crew. So while 'the actors' are having a week off you still had to put the effort in to comb through old footage and edit it all.  It is weird to think about how old TV conventions still affect people's opinions of 'new media' like youtube."
Hatfilms,3ceyxb,battles,4,Tue Jul 7 21:06:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the update Ross. Enjoy the holiday :)
Hatfilms,3ceyxb,Zylf,6,Tue Jul 7 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"Hey Ross, I know that some, if not most people aren't aware of how much effort goes into your videos, and this could be simply because they've never had experience in editing a video for themselves.   Most of this subreddit, I hope, understand the amount of effort you guys out into each video, whether it be the decals, the sifting through old content to make best bits and general time spent on what you do.   We all appreciate the content you provide for us, and I think I can speak on behalf of most of your fan base when I say thank you for all the time spent on the little things to make an epic videos like the stunt lad videos.   The sheer amount of work you guys do is something to be admired. Thanks again.   We're all here to support you guys, have fun on your holiday, and thanks for the time to reply to us and shed some light on the ""behind the scenes"" of hatfilms."

Hatfilms,3bwcx0,Thunderbeak,12,Thu Jul 2 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"That'd be fun for exactly, half a race.  GTA Races are all about using weapons, taking those (partially) away, you might just as well do a normal race! Hell, make it a non contact race even."
Hatfilms,3bwcx0,Dunga_,4,Thu Jul 2 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"I actually sort of agree with you. Guns make GTA races more challenging and make it easier to catch up and overtake other players - who then might quickly overtake you.  But stickies and proximity are just annoying. You can't dodge them (or at least the Hatters  pretty much can't) and they're an instakill. They're pretty much the opposite of guns. Instead of giving racers behind a chance to catch up, they just ensure the guy ahead stays ahead. So many races are already  decided in the first few corners. That's boring."

Hatfilms,3bm4mc,Guigsy,22,Tue Jun 30 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"Really you're complaining about them talking about something they really, really enjoy simply because you don't? I mean Sjin for example talks a lot about Disney princess particularly Frozen which is most definitely not my jam, but I still enjoy listening to it because he's so passionate and excited about it. That's just me though. I don't expect a youtuber which many more viewers than just myself to not talk about things they enjoy because I don't."
Hatfilms,3bm4mc,AwfulWaffleWalker,-11,Tue Jun 30 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to get at is for example I REALY like pepperoni pizza.  it's not the only thing I talk about. And i don't talk about it all the time with my friends.  Even if they also like pizza. But for other people who don't like pizza, references to pepperoni, cheese and dough every time you meet them would be intensely irritating. I'm not saying people shouldn't talk about things they enjoy. Just the same minor themes In vid after vid (not necessarily the hats as they are not as ""guilty"" as the others) gets annoying to me after a while."
Hatfilms,3bm4mc,Guigsy,15,Tue Jun 30 16:51:06 2015 UTC,I'd think you were out of your damn mind if you talked about pizza the way people talk about TV. Shows like Game of Thrones get talked about because it's been on every week for the past few months so of course people want to talk with their friends about the latest episode. It's not like the same boring pepperoni every week. It's like discovering a great new pizza topping each week and wanting to see what others think.
Hatfilms,3bm4mc,AwfulWaffleWalker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"Just let them talk about it or skip through it. They did end up stopping and talking about something else. It's something topical that they all like that they want to talk about it, I wouldn't stop you talking about pepperoni pizza all day, even when I can't stand the stuff."

Hatfilms,3bf8mv,TheWynner,8,Sun Jun 28 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"no offence dude,but it takes time for them to film stuff,and they had to do a lot in advance,edit it and set everything to upload at certain times,they cant do everything that everyone wants all the time,it wouldnt be fun then,chill,if you want some stunt lads,watch the first two episodes again."
Hatfilms,3bf8mv,KingOfElysium,0,Sun Jun 28 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Funny how the store robbery clip matches up with something I read recently: cheese is the most stolen food on earth.  E: whoops, that bit was in the last video."
Hatfilms,3be30x,Buttery-Toast,5,Sun Jun 28 10:19:25 2015 UTC,"I believe it was in feed the beast, the original one, somewhere between episode 20 and 40"

Hatfilms,3be30x,raynoruki,4,Sun Jun 28 17:11:37 2015 UTC,Their original FTB series was the best one in my opinion.
Hatfilms,3be30x,forgetfulcoder,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:48:13 2015 UTC,Have you seen Hat Corp yet?
Hatfilms,3be30x,LokiGiraffe,2,Mon Jun 29 05:47:55 2015 UTC,Yes. I have. All of it.

Hatfilms,3b82i8,Zibi777,10,Fri Jun 26 18:52:42 2015 UTC,This was fantastic.
Hatfilms,3b82i8,sirjayjayec,14,Fri Jun 26 19:09:41 2015 UTC,"""I'm tour De francing this shit"" just broke me. ha"
Hatfilms,3b82i8,IntelligentVandalist,4,Fri Jun 26 20:14:14 2015 UTC,"This was great. I hope they do more videos like this, maybe ""Top Fun"" and stuff like that."
Hatfilms,3b82i8,Haddy95,3,Sat Jun 27 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"It's all under adversary mode so I'd expect they'll do all of it. There is so many missions and after doing all the heists it makes sense as something to run through while adding in playlists (, hopefully custom maps made by the hatters as there's quite a few now,) as every second, third GTA video.  They did it with the freeroam GTA, the heists, and hopefully now adversary mode."
Hatfilms,3b82i8,Millhouse96,3,Sat Jun 27 12:48:15 2015 UTC,That was intense as hell holy shit

Hatfilms,3b82i8,whom,2,Sat Jun 27 03:36:46 2015 UTC,I reeeeeeeeeealy hope they do another Shat Block type game with Sips. I love Hat Films + Sips.
