starcraft,3e2itd,lemonadosaur,3,Tue Jul 21 15:18:44 2015 UTC,I never understood it in the first place. I mean he wasn't a GREAT caster but it's not like it was unwatchable. The amount of hate he got was pretty over the top.

starcraft,3e0en7,GAMETIMESC2,27,Tue Jul 21 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"Less the AI, more the attack animation.  Thors dont use projectiles, but they have a ""wind-up"", like the hellion, during which the attack can be dodged.  Even if it never targeted the medivac, it would never manage to hit the tank.  Tanks attacks are exactly like immortals, which explains why they're so effective when juggled.  Instant attack animations are deadly."

starcraft,3e0en7,Dunedune,5,Tue Jul 21 09:43:52 2015 UTC,"To confirm: You're saying that because the tank (unsieged) takes up 4/8 unit slots when inside the medivac, 4 scv's on autorepair repair the tank as it spends the second(s) inside the medivac as you micro it?   That's...amazeballs."
starcraft,3e0en7,Lurking_Still,4,Tue Jul 21 09:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you cannot D+click to drop it, you have to click it on the bottom side of the screen, otherwise you unload the scvs."
starcraft,3e0en7,Dunedune,2,Tue Jul 21 09:44:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you.   Incidentally, does anyone know if there is a way to bind load/unload of specific slots in the medivac to a hotkey?   That'd be neat."
starcraft,3e0en7,Lurking_Still,7,Tue Jul 21 10:55:49 2015 UTC,"No, there is not, the hotkey settings screen is rather clear and explicit.  Clicking the tank or the hellions in the medivac is very doable though."

starcraft,3e0en7,Psyladine,11,Tue Jul 21 14:04:11 2015 UTC,If the workers just repaired the medivac the tank should never be lost. Its attack speed is much faster than the targetting sequence of the Thors.  Just constant pick up and drop and the Thors can never find a target. Tank mode fire rate is actually very high!  Also seeing as medivacs are armoured two thors wont out DPS the heal rate on those SCV

starcraft,3e0o3d,Mangizz,6,Tue Jul 21 05:08:32 2015 UTC,just watched the 2013 sos vs jaedong finals again. it's really endearing to watch tasteless call every single thing perfectly wrong and sometimes even the exact opposite of what is happening on the screen in front of him. that this guy is a legend says a lot about the quality of people at the top of this community.
starcraft,3e0o3d,hazehk,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:35:56 2015 UTC,"The reason he's a ""legend"" is because Tasteless was in S. Korea bringing English casting of the high level Korean games when there simply wasn't any available in Brood War.  He paved the road for SO many casters today.  He was in S. Korea at a time when there was no real e-sports scene, no Twitch to stream and build a reputation, none of that.  He went there speaking zero Korean and made it happen.  He's a fantastic play by play caster and his recent solo casts have been greatly entertaining.    So instead of bringing this attitude, how about you actually understand where SC2 stands thanks to the people who actually put some hard work into the scene in order to make it happen?  Your ass gets to sit and watch SC2 because of people like Tasteless and Artosis (and the slew of other community figures).  You don't have to like his casting style, but at least pay the man some respect for what he's done."

starcraft,3e1xo0,EmoryToss17,5,Tue Jul 21 12:54:53 2015 UTC,That's what getting away with 3CC vs a scouted stargate opening will do for you.
starcraft,3e1xo0,DarkLordOlli,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"With a 4:30 cc lol, it's not very inspiring play from flash and echo is horrible for defending vs Vikings. Was really difficult to see how hero was supposed to hold without storm especially on that map. Hero still didn't seem to know how to deal with that build."
starcraft,3e1xo0,pond97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"you can't exactly go straight to storm from herO's position, either... and getting both storm and collosus and a third is not possible.  Perhaps staying on 2 base and teching to storm + collosus is the right idea? but you wouldn't have the gas on 2 base to get upgrades with that, so when you do eventually secure your 3rd it would be 2-2 bio that is maxed out against 1-1 Protoss at like 150 supply, which is going to be rough for the Protoss even if they have storm and 3 colossus.   Seems like a build order loss if you can't get damage done with your stargate. I think that is why blink is the standard opener PvT, because you could do some damage poking away with your stalkers to make it a more even game."
starcraft,3e1xo0,Jonas223XC,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:53 2015 UTC,"the 1 collosi no thermal lance thing could have worked, since flash didnt scout if he just made immortals and had storm the push could have been held since flash basically didn't scout or attack at all. Not having charge was really huge. But yeah it did seem like a build order loss I don't see how that attack is holdable from that position."

starcraft,3e1ywv,independence1991,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:30 2015 UTC,Edit: as this seems to be unclear. I don't think adepts are OP outside of one very specific situation and my only issue with them in general is the lack of counterplay to the shadewalking. I did not come here to whine about the adept. Nor to get advice on how to beat them. I have much more important things to focus on in improving my gameplay than stopping one particular build.  I also love (and hate) adepts. The overall design is nice and I like the role the play.  What I think is too much is the shades' combination of invulnerability and ability to walk through units. With good control a one base adept all in should never lose vs zerg as they currently stand.  I think the ability to walk through units is important for the ability and identity of the unit but being able to cancel the shades via damage (maybe have them be like adept hallucinations in terms of health?) would allow some counter play to the adept harass without reducing their defensive abilities and survivability.
starcraft,3e1ywv,Para199x,4,Tue Jul 21 10:24:45 2015 UTC,"With good control a one base adept all in should never lose vs zerg as they currently stand.   eh, I disagree completely with that statement. It isn't blink. They cant teleport until the entire duration of the shade is complete and the shade itself has a cooldown after that. And the unit itself movespeed isn't that high. They are not really harder to kill then hellions."
starcraft,3e1ywv,willdrum4food27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:57 2015 UTC,"It's really unstoppable. Go 1 base 4 gates. Pylon close to the Zerg bases, keep a decent mass of army here. Send adepts 2 by 2 to the minerals lines and kill as much drones as possible.  Even with 1 spine and 1 queen on each bases Zerg can't stop the drone loss. There is no Queen block, no counter-play. Just rinse and repeat, trade some army when they move to defend. They can't defend with lings, once you forced them to get roaches you can go mass air or just 7 gates.  The unit is fun, but 2 shooting drones is too good"
starcraft,3e1ywv,bugzuzu,3,Tue Jul 21 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well since Protoss is only on one base and Zerg is on two, Zerg can afford to lose some drones per adept.  Just treat them the same way you do mass reapers. Get speed, roach, or more queens, and stop playing so greedy when you see no Nexus."
starcraft,3e1ywv,CustardBoy,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"The thing is you can't treat them like mass reapers because when speedling is done it's pretty much over. Reapers can't get near your mineral line, and they can't trade with your speedlings either.  Adepts on the other hand, will always reach your mineral line and trade efficiently.  Also, with a good amount of them, they annihilate speedlings.  Sure you can survive but when Zerg is forced to get roaches after loosing a lot of drones this early in the game it's not winable.  On a side note I play random in LotV. Nobody stopped the push when I play PvZ. And I never been able to survive it playing ZvP (my main race)."
starcraft,3e1ywv,bugzuzu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Which is it? Are they attacking drones or zerglings? You need to accept that you will lose some units defending against them. But while that's happening you're buying time for queens and spines. You can even throw drones at them, remember that they kill drones SLOWER than zealots attacking in melee. If you reduce their numbers very early on, their reinforcements won't bother you. It doesn't matter how many resources you devote to the defense, once it's defended the game is over because the Protoss is on one base and going to mine out in like 2 minutes."
starcraft,3e1ywv,CustardBoy,3,Tue Jul 21 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"Infinitely harder. Hellions can be blocked at the ramp with two queens and good micro can save your natural.  One base 4 gate adept is actually unstoppable if well controlled (assuming zerg opens 2 base). Holding a 4 gate without adepts either means rushing out roaches and it'd be a close fight or mass queen, spine and getting lings as you can afford them. The second option doesn't work vs adepts for obvious reasons (spines and queens immobile, lings trade awfully with adepts and take forever to kill them so drones can just be focused down). The first option works in a straight up fight but adepts force you to split up your roaches while the protoss army stays all together. Plus they can start warping in stalkers if you go pure roach and that basically ends the game too, once they've either forced you to move roaches to the main or have whittled down your economy."

starcraft,3e1ywv,MisterMetal,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"No, you miss my point entirely. This is the perfectly fine part. This is talking about defending a 4 gate which DOESN'T include adepts.  I also was just using this build as an example for the counterplay problem."

There is no way to wall off at your natural and your main ramp has the ""unbuildable rocks/plates/whatever""   Like I've said I'm not really sure this is OP it is just an example of the lack of real counterplay.  TL;DR for the rest of this set of comments: To put it another way. With adepts if you really WANT to have all of your adepts in my main mineral line unscathed you can do that absolutely guaranteed. I can only react to the thing you have done. If you wanted to do that with blink stalkers you'd have to catch me out of position or trick me or distract me or w/e. And I can directly attempt to counter your attempts to do so. To me making those decisions (and broader strategic decisions) is what is interesting in an RTS. At least playwise, though the execution and making miracles happen with micro are amazing to watch and feel great to pull off."

starcraft,3e1ywv,setmehigh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:00 2015 UTC,".........  its not infinitely harder. And I was talking about the units escapibility and you are talking about  an allin.... There is a distinct timing when the shade goes out and when it can pop. if you don't split your units let him run the shades into your main, before they pop run the drones to the nat. They do zero damage to buildings, so if they go in main you just go up and kill them at your leisure, and if they don't you should be winning the fight at the nat. Then who cares if you are mining only at your nat oversaturated for a little bit since hes fucking allining you.   its not that complicated."
starcraft,3e1ywv,willdrum4food27,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:53 2015 UTC,Yeah because running what is roughly 80-90% of your economy from one base to another while your opponent makes units on your front door won't lead to anything bad at all... not to mention that you will at least lose the queen (or stop injecting) thus greatly reducing your production
starcraft,3e1ywv,Para199x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:42 2015 UTC,"what. Dude I tell you exactly how to hold the allin easily and you are bashing it with nonsense without even trying it. Say thank you, and do what I just said next time you get 4 gated and take the win. If you do it and it doesn't work feel free to send me the replay and I can help you out more.   edit to your edit: if they pop up to kll the queen all the adepts that popped up are trapped and thus dead. THATS A GOOD TRADE."
starcraft,3e1ywv,willdrum4food27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:05 2015 UTC,"I've played a few games against it and seen a few other zergs play against it. To have enough units to hold straight up you only have a few drones in your natural, so transferring main to nat is REALLY painful for your econ. The production loss from pulling/losing an inject queen is a REALLY big deal.  If I'm following your advice I'm not chasing them to the main and so they don't all die for that at all."
starcraft,3e1ywv,Para199x,5,Tue Jul 21 14:17:59 2015 UTC,don't chase the shades but if there are 4 adepts chilling in the main you can send a small amount of units to kill them for free.

starcraft,3e1ywv,Rowannn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:10 2015 UTC,You harass with the unit and use the ghost pre-emptively so your unit can either retreat or effectively blink to the other side of the base to continue the harass.
starcraft,3e1ywv,Lunawa,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of the units in LotV, so much better than hots imo.   I don't like the vipers parasitic whatever spell though, that is wack."
starcraft,3e1ywv,DoomDash,6,Tue Jul 21 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"Like you, I also like adept a lot.  But from my experience after playing more than 100 PvP so far in LotV, the early game is being dominated by adepts.  The problem: adepts have high hp and in the early game Protoss has nothing with good DPS to kill them before they kill a lot of workers. Also, the matchup got a whole another level of coinflipness.  Proposed tweak: make the shadow unable to pass through forcefields and units in hold position.  It's a very simple change that, from what I can tell, would make a world of difference not only in PvP, but in PvZ."
starcraft,3e1ywv,Tiaraju9,2,Tue Jul 21 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely.  If this was added other builds would be more viable. PvP in HotS, whilst cheesy at times, is good in that it can be the good kind: less 2gate proxy, more 4gate and DT rush. I think forcefields allow the Adept to be an aggressive opening but not the only aggressive opening."
starcraft,3e1ywv,scrubben,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"I like the Adept a lot, but it really deals too much damage to light units.  It's a bit annoying that Protoss has the most ""imbalanced"" units in term of +damage, with the adept and the immortal"
starcraft,3e1ywv,fezvez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:23:15 2015 UTC,"Though, it has to because other gateway units are doesn't deal enough damage and hence people say gateway comp suck."
starcraft,3e1ywv,speedyturt13,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:36:40 2015 UTC,"The thing is, they are still not that great once stim/medivac tech is researched. Bio mine destroys heavy gateway the same way, because you can kite forever and mines splash for 1k damage.  But before that point the unit is a god. There is nothing you can do as Terran, except sit back behind a bunker and walls and make sure there is no hole in your defence.   And its like, protoss gateway units already do really well against unupgraded bio. So why give them another unit that is so dominant early game, but drastically falls in the midgame."
starcraft,3e1ywv,MacroJackson,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:11 2015 UTC,because they don't actually understand where protoss needs to be fixed. Hopefully people that understand telling them what they should do at those summits will help.
starcraft,3e1ywv,fatamSC2,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:14 2015 UTC,it does about the same dps to light units as a zealot.
starcraft,3e1ywv,willdrum4food27,6,Tue Jul 21 13:40:12 2015 UTC,"The zealot is melee, the adept is ranged. The zealot should do more damage than the adept, since it has to run all the way to melee range to do damage."
starcraft,3e1ywv,HasuGuru,5,Tue Jul 21 14:40:58 2015 UTC,a marines does more dps than both without stim. Whoops. Not to mention zealots DPS to armored units is more then double the adepts.

starcraft,3e1ywv,willdrum4food27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:38 2015 UTC,It's also ranged and faster with greater escape potential. It's a better Zealot.
starcraft,3e1ywv,droonick,4,Tue Jul 21 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"and more expensive and higher tech and does less then half the damage zealots do to non-light units. But as far as pure damage soaking goes yeah it really is, specially since immortals being a bigger part of comps in lotv you don't really care about your front lines to armor units dps. but yeah. adepts do largely replace zeals specially with their shield upgrade, but zeals do have a niche still I think. Cant snipe hatcheries and tech with adepts."
starcraft,3e1ywv,nucleardirtbag,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"I am not at all salty that we're getting an Adept skin in the LOTV CE. I love the look of the unit and the design and I really like what it does so far in terms of its role. Solid addition I'd say.   Although I agree with most that it needs some toning down/adjustments. I'm fine with almost everything except the fact that it does too much damage to light. It absolutely shreds Marines, and I'm surprised so far by the amount of ""easy"" wins I've had by just flooding Terrans with fast Adepts.  But maybe it's just a meta issue where players are still adapting.  and the Shade, I really like the idea behind it, it meshes with the theme of Stalkers and teleportation for Protoss but. I think it needs more restrictions as to what it can ""phase through"", like the Shade shouldn't be able to phase through when there's no pathing for the Shade, so it can't go through Bunkers and depots? Also, some more counterplay, like fungals or EMP, like others have said."
starcraft,3e1ywv,Shadygaga,0,Tue Jul 21 15:33:29 2015 UTC,I wish you could block the adepts spirit things with units. A Protoss sent three adepts at my base and I tried to block my ramp with my queens and the spirit things just went through them. This part of the unit is really annoying because adepts pretty much get a free scout whenever you play on a map with a large ramp.
starcraft,3e1ywv,nucleardirtbag,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:03 2015 UTC,Sentry hallucinate gets a free scout whenever it wants in this same situation.

starcraft,3e1ywv,RedditorNumber42FUCK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:00 2015 UTC,Yea i must admit my first impressions of this unit are much more positive than i actually expected. They are a better version of a zealot with micro potential which is great :).
starcraft,3e1ywv,RedditorNumber42FUCK,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:30 2015 UTC,Solution : Twilight council required. Make the Twilight council building time shorter. Increase Blink research as much u reduced the Twilight counciled construction duration.  Sounds fair. (Playing random today but was Protoss for 4 years)
starcraft,3e1ywv,Zuratul9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"Why Terrans can get Ghosts way earlier than Protoss gets HTs ? 2 bases HT play would be more a thing, right ?"
starcraft,3e1ywv,jinjin5000,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the unit is copied from multiplayer arena games.. I cant see any real innovation."
starcraft,3e1ywv,CruelMetatron,-3,Tue Jul 21 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"It is just too tanky for how much it costs. Its bit ridiculous.  It being light unit while having close to 300 hp and dealing huge burst damage I'd way too much as it is only 100/25 and spammable.  The shade being unkillable is annoying to say the least and while it may have ""same dps as zealot"" as some argue here, it's burst damage is huge and scales well early game in addition to it having extreme tankiness, 4 range and shade mobility. It can't be kited while 2 hitting marines early game which limits what you really can open with as terran and makes adept all ins hard to hold since it comes in incredible numbers while only aoe that worms really is widow mines as hellions crumble to its burst light damage.  Seems like bit of immortal for light units except 100/25"
starcraft,3e1ywv,masamunexs,0,Tue Jul 21 14:07:56 2015 UTC,I still think the ability is too similar to Blink to make it a good feeling addition. To me it just seem like they couldn't come up with something truly new (or something good without any ability).
starcraft,3e1ywv,Tiaraju9,-10,Tue Jul 21 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's similar, but in practice they act and are used very differently.  I think teleportation is a generally protoss'y theme (mothership recall, the whole concept of zealots being warped to aiur when they die), so to me it's more going with a theme than lack of creativity."

starcraft,3e1ywv,BWV639,4,Tue Jul 21 15:04:09 2015 UTC,I mainly dislike how they can shade through forcefields. It makes them a pain in the ass in PvP. Should be an easy enough fix to just not make them able to shade through FF shouldn't it? It's becoming less meta now but 1 base early adepts just killing all your workers is really annoying in PvP because completely walling off is sort of out of the question.
starcraft,3e1ywv,IWatchFatPplSleep,4,Tue Jul 21 12:52:37 2015 UTC,adepts severely limit the number of openers a terran can do in tvp. And they easily kill you with a warp prism. That's not good. The design is cool though I guess.
starcraft,3e1ywv,edias00,3,Tue Jul 21 13:00:30 2015 UTC,Just like Protoss has to open with Stalker or MSC in PvT otherwise a well controlled Reaper can with the game?
starcraft,3e1ywv,IWatchFatPplSleep,0,Tue Jul 21 15:18:02 2015 UTC,What other opening would you go for PvT though? FFE was kinda a thing in WoL but hardly used. Gate into Cyber is basically the only tech path for toss anyways and why wouldn't they make the best unit in the game right away?
starcraft,3e1ywv,edias00,6,Tue Jul 21 15:29:34 2015 UTC,Well if Reapers weren't a thing then Toss could skip the anti-harassing units and go straight into Immortals or something. Just like Toss and Terran have to wall up against Zerg lest Zerglings just run into your base.
starcraft,3e1ywv,BWV639,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:50 2015 UTC,Toss wouldn't make immortals anyways though and making a single stalker doesn't exactly delay the robo much at all if you're gonna do a 2 immortal all-in to bust bunkers or something. Good luck ever holding a third base opening immortal. The only thing reaper openings really shut down is nexus first which is a coin flip opening anyways.

starcraft,3dzuzw,FacehuntersAnonymous,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:13 2015 UTC,"and game 7 had me on the edge of my seat.   How? The game was like over long before it was over. You had a 3 base zerg versus a 1 base terran for a while. The only reason the 1 base Terran survived is because it's very hard for a zerg to break up a ramp like that versus mines and hellbats, doesn't mean the terran can easily come down and reclaim the natural though."
starcraft,3dzuzw,NaNiWuT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"Life was only mining on 2 bases, go watch the game again."
starcraft,3dzuzw,FacehuntersAnonymous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"True, had 3 bases but the third had like 2 drones.  Hardly changes that Life was up like 40-50 supply and the game wasn't ""tense"" any more from the moment Life pushed Maru up his ramp.  I mean, let's be honest, from that moment, if you would be allowed to take a 2:1 odds bet on whether Life takes it, so you lose say 200 EUR if Life wins but you gain only 100 EUR if Maru wins, would you take it?  I would, however possible, the chance wasn't high that Maru game back, the game wasn't close and Life's to lose from that, comebacks naturally happen but to be on the edge of your seat over it is a bit weird."
starcraft,3dzuzw,NaNiWuT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yes but in that moment anything was possible, Marus micro had been incredible.  It's easy to look back and know life had won, but in the heat of the moment it wasn't 100% certain."
starcraft,3dzuzw,FacehuntersAnonymous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:29 2015 UTC,I wasn't 100% certain either. But I held it pretty likely that life would win. On the edge of your seat implies you give it close to 50-50 odds. I certainly didn't.
starcraft,3dzuzw,NaNiWuT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that being on the edge of your seat implies 50/50 odds in any way, at least to me.  Of course I thought Life would win that game like 90%.  I was 'on the edge of my seat' cause it was such an intense micro battle at the end of a crazy long macro series.  Regardless can we agree that the series was one of the greatest of all time?"
starcraft,3dzuzw,MambaTheSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:47 2015 UTC,the game was over when Life broke Maru's natural. Then he couldn't finish because it's almost impossible to push up a 3hex ramp. I don't fin microbattles exciting at all when the game is already over.  I have those scenarios all the time in ladder where a terran with 5 scv's microes their heart out with medivacmicro etc. even when the game is already over.  It's not exciting imho. After you saw that 500times you just consider it a waste of time.
starcraft,3dzuzw,MambaTheSnake,4,Tue Jul 21 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"Imho the whole series was epic, but the last game sucked.  This would have been one of the greatest series of all time but Inferno Pools ruined it."
starcraft,3dzuzw,NaNiWuT,4,Tue Jul 21 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Why did the last game suck in your opinion? It showcased great micro from both sides, Maru desperately trying to hold on with a triple cc build and life on low economy using a maximum of 4 mutas at one time in addition to long/bane to finish off Maru."
starcraft,3dzuzw,MambaTheSnake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:31 2015 UTC,nah I don't think so at all.  Both of those players very rarely played on Infernopools because it isn't played in korean leagues.  Life played a 2base muta banebust because he didn't want to play on that map and Maru fucked up his wall because he didn't play often on that map.  Game was over because there was a hole in the wall. In my opinion not exciting at all.
starcraft,3dzuzw,AcerPhoon,0,Tue Jul 21 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"Why? Because it essentially looked like a fight of David vs Goliath. An unwinnable uphill battle. It would have been surprising if Maru somehow won, but that was essentially a walkover"
starcraft,3dzuzw,coachz1212,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm with you. I think that Maru threw that game by building a fast third. It was just pure greed and life punished him for it."
starcraft,3dzuzw,NaNiWuT,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a throw, but it definitely cost him the game.  Life had not been opening super aggressive in that series, but when he smells blood he sure goes for it."
starcraft,3dzuzw,SoulmaN__,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:39 2015 UTC,"You know how both players play their absolute best during the first 6 games? Yeah.  Then game 7 comes around, you're all pumped up for a 50 minute extremely epic macro ZvT and then it's one of the sloppiest games ever on the shittiest map ever that doesn't even allow those epic games because of the base/ spawn layout.  That map is seriously one of the worst we have EVER had."
starcraft,3dzuzw,Arabian_Goggles_,12,Tue Jul 21 06:05:37 2015 UTC,That series still makes me mad. If Maru would have just walled off

I enjoy all of the matchups, including ZvZ (the key is having good commentators for it, like PiG or Moonglade).   Where I was desperate to get away from WoL and BLInf , I feel like HotS is going to go out on an amazing high."
starcraft,3dzuzw,Merinicus,12,Mon Jul 20 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"Pig has revolutionised ZvZ in terms of casting outside of Korea. It's worth having him around for that matchup alone.

starcraft,3dzuzw,nideak,10,Mon Jul 20 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"Pig's ZvZ commentary was eye-opening. He really helped point out the nuances of a seemingly-simple match-up.  I hope Rotterdam does similar for fans and PvP, but I'm guessing not in the current SC2 climate."
starcraft,3dzuzw,banjoetheredskin,8,Mon Jul 20 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"The way Artosis, Rotterdam, and ToD all contribute to a PvP cast is, in my opinion, very good for a matchup that has a pretty bad reputation still.  They all understand it at a high enough level that they can explain the small things that players try to do to work advantages, factors that players have to consider when they make decisions in the early and mid game, all without making anything needlessly complex for the purpose of the broadcast.  The herO vs Classic series from IEM Shenzen is a great example of this."

starcraft,3dzuzw,maxwellsdemon13,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:23 2015 UTC,When I began watching in 2013 the seasonal finals of WCS had 120k viewers the qualifiers for premier league ro32 had 40k viewers. The finals of wcs now has 40-50k. The viewership has gone down.
starcraft,3dzuzw,varroth,4,Mon Jul 20 22:44:30 2015 UTC,http://www.fuzic.nl/events/?order_by=peak&order=desc&in=event EDIT: What it is saying is 2013 was the peak of SC2 but the drop off isn't the big and you are exaggerating the numbers.
starcraft,3dzuzw,edias00,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:34 2015 UTC,The drop off is certainly big. When I watched tournaments in Group stages they would probably have like 35-50k for DH and now it would have around 20-30k. I'm not exaggerating the numbers I'm just going based on memory and I remember checking the viewcount several times during the WCS finals and then it was sitting at around 120k consistently.
starcraft,3dzuzw,ithinkmynameismoose,0,Mon Jul 20 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"The problem is other games keep growing and the whole reason SC2 got so much money in the first place was that it was supposed to keep growing also. It fell to 9th on twitch recently, that's no good."

starcraft,3dzuzw,infinitum17,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:45 2015 UTC,Taipei is in Taiwan and they certainly have access to YouTube.

Here was my my logic: Perhaps the reason that it has so many views is because the large population of China contributed a lot of those views to a tournament that took place in Taiwan, where they speak Chinese. But then I doubted myself because I'm fairly sure youtube is blocked in mainland China. Of course Taiwan itself could have contributed some views, but it doesn't have anywhere near the population of China proper, so then it wouldn't be relevant to why it has so many views.  Would you kindly explain where you feel that I've gone wrong in my reasoning."

starcraft,3dysby,squarelol,4,Mon Jul 20 23:59:31 2015 UTC,they dont do them at once but they are always using 2 PCs to follow games. so when one game finishes the immediately jump into the other for minimal downtime
starcraft,3dysby,robih29,22,Mon Jul 20 21:58:10 2015 UTC,TakeTV is hands down the best thing that could happen to the (german) StarCraft scene. And german Esport in general.
starcraft,3dysby,Gesperrt,27,Mon Jul 20 22:03:27 2015 UTC,"It is really impressive what they are doing. In this stage of the evolution of the game it is in my opinion very important to build strong local communities to give the game a strong basis for the future. German and France scenes are role models here imo. We have to appreciate those because there is still a huge language barrier even though many people don't realise it (as you can see in this post). Those people have to have an easy connection to the eSports side to get them involved. I myself only am in this scene because of a local caster like that.   Big shoutouts especially to rememberme, Naruto and Olli for their continuous work."
starcraft,3dysby,etsharry,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"I also got my T-Shirt signed by Take at ESL ONE Frankfurt this year, maybe they are planning to expand their portfolio / community to Dota 2 as well."
starcraft,3dysby,bAShyyy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"They alread tried Dota 2 once with Templar as a caster. Didn't really work out, but now they are also doing somes Heroeswith KnowMe, as well as CS:GO and HS. In the new location they will have 3 studios I think, so we could certainly see more games and maybe even Dota 2 again."
starcraft,3dysby,Musicus,12,Mon Jul 20 20:21:28 2015 UTC,Naruto is the best thing to happen to TakeTV since Take. I just hope he never stops playing SC2 so he can keep up the quality insight.   I watch WCS on takeTV if the english cast has Kaelaris + Apollo because Naruto + Take are just way more entertaining and seem to get their facts (besides citing aligulac statistics) right
starcraft,3dysby,robih29,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:59 2015 UTC,Naruto stopped playing starcraft some time ago because if he plays he wants to be competitive and he can't keep his skill up while only playing sometimes :)
starcraft,3dysby,AkrioX,4,Mon Jul 20 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"Its absolutely amazing what TakeTV is doing. Not just for the german scene in general, but also for around the world.  They started with the HSC in SC2, then with the Seathstory Cup in Hearthstone and even now with their own CS GO Leauge, which finals will kick off at the end of the month in their new location.  Curently they are providing SC2, HS and CS GO content weekly in german and are doing all the big events in english. I think TakeTV will grow a lot the next few years.  Dennis said they will also start with Heroes of the Storm content when the new location is ready to go."

starcraft,3e1l7l,melolzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:56 2015 UTC,My friend and I had the same problem when we tried doing video's of StarCraft. It's hard because StarCraft is such a mentally demanding game. That's why most cast instead.   Eventually I got into a rhythm where I could chit chat on autopilot while I focused on playing. I also made sure to overreact to the big events by yelling and swearing a lot. People will watch a dull video for a few good moments.
starcraft,3e2vpk,JaedongBonjwaaa,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:51 2015 UTC,"You fix it by upgrading, like it says. It's not a bug."
starcraft,3e0d05,cyclestarcraft,20,Mon Jul 20 23:58:31 2015 UTC,I believe they talked about it with HotS and just settled on bonus XP for first win of the day because they had trouble finding quests that didn't either lead to players going off race or cheesing. I remember a thread of quest ideas this subreddit tried to come up with and they mostly lead to not constructive play.  I'm sure they've continued thinking of it and I hope they figured something out but it's a problem no one has found an easy and fun answer to.
starcraft,3e0d05,maxwellsdemon13,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"Well, they could put really simple quests just like Heroes of the Storm has, for instance, play X games, or win X games. They could even expand and promote the arcade, like play 1 Arcade game, or win a round of Left 2 die. Quests don't have to be something difficult just something to give motivation to open the game and play a round or two.       I believe the bigger problem would be finding rewards, unless of course they add an economy system. They could put rewards like gold for HS or any other b-net game, but I am not sure if they are fond of the idea of cross-rewarding.      As for me I really hope they put an economy model and add daily quests. I see my brother struggle through playing several rounds of HS and HotS just to get his dailies done, so I believe it will work."

starcraft,3e0d05,srsatt,6,Tue Jul 21 01:03:50 2015 UTC,No plz no i really don't want daily quests in LotV. because even though it makes me want to play games like heroes or hearthstone to complete my quests. It also makes me want to stop playing those games when i have completed my quests because i feel like its a waste of time when i get so much less money from just playing normal games.  And also it would make you have to play a certain way which i really dont think will work for starcraft 1v1. But maybe they could do them for allied commanders then i would be fine with it.

starcraft,3e0d05,bonisaur,3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:31 2015 UTC,I would approach daily questions with the following examples:   Play two Terran games. Kill 10 different units. Play a Custom Map. Play with a friend. Play 4v4. Spectate a friend. Chat in General Chat. Play a game with Clan. Play two games against AI.   Thoughts?
starcraft,3e0d05,Firkraag8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest I feel most of those are terrible, if there was incentives to play the way you wanted to play then I'd be ok with it but I don't see myself doing many of the ones you have listed. Pigeonholing people into playing things they don't enjoy to unlock the things they want isn't a good idea.    Play two Terran games.    Could you imagine a day on the ladder where all you're playing against is the same race because of a daily quest? Yeah it doesn't really sound that great. I hate to play TvZ, I guess I'm not playing on the days where Zerg is the daily huh?    Kill 10 different units.    This is fine I guess, it would work with almost any game mode. But doesn't it feel kind of pointless? You'll complete this almost no matter what you do.    Play two games against AI.    Yeah.. no, people might do it but they won't enjoy it.    Play a Custom Map. Play 4v4.    I don't think it's fair quests for those that dislikes these modes, which I'm certain are fairly many.    Chat in General Chat.    First thing I did when that patch hit was /leave general chat. But even if I was into it, I couldn't imagine the amount of nonsense that would be spammed in there because of a quest.  The ones where you're supposed to play with a friend and clan are a good thing IMO but those are pretty much it, and those are already encouraged with the bonus experience. Experience is earned almost everywhere, I'd rather see a system implemented that makes these points useful than quests."

Kaelaris or Tasteless for instance don't even play the game, and often times, seem more excited to cast heroes of the storm than starcraft. Don't get me wrong, when casting games they seem genuinely excited and hyped. But I definitely think Lycan can do that, and deserves this chance with how much he has contributed to the scene. Will he be the best caster right away? No, but he will improve. Challenger League is a very good start, and hopefully make it into WCS premier caster/host one day if he does well."
starcraft,3dyz9z,Voltz_sc2,-7,Tue Jul 21 06:51:13 2015 UTC,It's going to be hilarious when Lycan completely bombs on the cast and is dropped by the next broadcast. Let's just sit back and watch the crash and burn

You don't have to like Lycan. And you're not wrong to criticize the choice by ESL to recruit him to cast WCS. But there's a right way and a wrong way.  I personally don't enjoy Lycan's casting. But I'm not about to ignore the fact that he's a human being who works REALLY hard to be involved in a scene he loves.  This is how you make people think twice before putting themselves out there for the community. I make some Starcraft content and I'd love to build myself a little fanbase of people that enjoy what I do. But I certainly wouldn't feel good about myself if I saw these types of comments about me.

starcraft,3dyz9z,PcaKestheaod,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the platform(TLG I'm assuming) is just the same already known personalities being recycled in the sc2 sphere. He doesn't really take any risks in that regard. He does put a lot into SC2, which is awesome, I don't think people are really disagreeing with it there. I just think its a bit disingenuous, because I'm sure there are other casters who have put the time in (Rifkin, ZG, even Madals. I'm assuming Gretorp couldn't) that would appreciate the opportunity. It's possible they turned it down, and it just kind of fell into Lycan's lap, but just my thoughts about it. Regardless, hopefully he makes the most of it and does really well with his casting."
starcraft,3dyz9z,byzzz,3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the platform(TLG I'm assuming) is just the same already known personalities being recycled in the sc2 sphere   Well not only do I think that that's actually really important, it'd also be wrong to say he doesn't give the new faces access to that same platform.  Regardless, I'm not saying I LIKE the choice by ESL here. I do think that Lycan isn't the best person to fill the spot. But the people in this thread aren't voicing that opinion in the right way.  Remember too, Rifkin/ZG are both just back from Cali and probably aren't available/don't want to travel again so soon, they probably just want to get back to Basetrade. Madals is in the UK and the amount of undeserved hate Madals gets heaped on him from this subreddit makes him as dangerous a choice for ESL as Lycan is. So yeah its probably a case of 'there was no one else'. It doesn't matter. Lycan is important to the scene and the sort of talk that's in this thread is exactly the type of talk that discourages people from getting involved with the scene. This is how you slow growth."

Right now it just appears to most of this community that you're trying to take the shortest route to success, and that you haven't yet earned it, which doesn't engender good will from anyone.

starcraft,3dyz9z,ProxyHatchGG,17,Mon Jul 20 18:15:12 2015 UTC,I would say there's a stronger contrast between Nathanias (as much as I don't like him) and Lycan then between Lycan and Apollo.
starcraft,3dyz9z,SidusKnight,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:40 2015 UTC,i still remember when he just randomly casted pro league in English and everyone hype him to relevance

starcraft,3dyz9z,kawaii_renekton,10,Mon Jul 20 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"Nathanias was a literal nobody with no ""in"" in the scene, just worked and Kappaed his ass off until he made it.   Apollo had esports experience and was a member/ caster for dignitas, which he turned into becoming the best caster in the scene. Obviously Apollo works his ass off, and may be the best-prepared caster out there, but if that's the direction he's (SidiusKnight) is going, I can see it."

This system provides a much more stable stream that reduces buffering and massively reduces stream delay and it is also far more cost effective than other solutions. Even someone with amazing internet can get buffering if the data has a problem somewhere else in the network.

starcraft,3dyz9z,jivebeaver,13,Mon Jul 20 23:44:27 2015 UTC,We should at least give him a chance before shitting on him. He does seem like a decent talker and although he might not have the game knowledge I think if he sticks mostly to play by play commentary along with nathanias he might be okay. Totalbiscuit is gold league and he's one of my favorite commentators to listen to. FYI I think Lycan is a diamond terran for those saying he's plat or gold.
starcraft,3dyz9z,TheCreature1,4,Tue Jul 21 01:05:56 2015 UTC,"Well he did cast some WCS qualifiers and, no offense to Lycan since I do like TLG, but those casts were horrible. He doesn't have the voice or the ability to do play-by-play and obviously he cannot be the colour guy either."
starcraft,3dyz9z,Lixadellic,4,Mon Jul 20 18:39:46 2015 UTC,The thing is Nate shines with play by play. He is better paired with someone like Apollo.

(note: I'm not trying to say they are identical situations, and I'm not going to weigh in on degree of ""deserving"" said chance)   Had I the effort (which I certainly do not) I'd go through the depths of my comment history where I defended giving him the shot and applauding Dreamhack for giving a hardworking guy a chance.   I think part of what I said was how beneficial it was that Nathanias was getting to cast alongside Apollo, who would no doubt be able to make him good even if he was crashing and burning.   Nathanias did not crash and burn. Instead he's a massive community figure.    Now Nathanias gets the opportunity to pay it forward. I have no doubt that Nathanias will be able to make Lycan look good, even if he's crashing and burning.   I'm glad Lycan is being given this opportunity. I think he'll be just fine. I'm glad WCS is giving him his shot. Let's see what he can do with it."
starcraft,3dyz9z,jjbus34,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"Nathanias was a long time community caster.  Lycan, as far as I know, is not.  There are a dozen people with more casting experience than Lycan who have never broken 100 views on twitch."
starcraft,3dyz9z,Conjwa,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:02 2015 UTC,Nathanias had been in masters (I don't think he had reached GM yet) for a couple years by that point and had been casting community stuff along with his proleague stuff for quite a while demonstrating considerable game knowledge. Lycan is a platinum player who has had a small spattering of terrible casts. They are totally different.

starcraft,3dyz9z,djcahill,3,Mon Jul 20 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"So admittedly I do not follow enough drama and casters to know what the general population of this subreddit thinks of Lycan and Winter (Which is why I am not sure if your post is positive, sarcastic, or negative)   So I'll just say this: From a low ranked SC player who views R/starcraft. Lycan seems to post up consistently here, and he runs a SC league which supports players from almost any rank. Then turns around and Casts those games on Twitch giving players a ""mini Pro game"" feel to it. (which many of those players would have never had the opportunity to have)  To me this indicates he is at least somewhat in touch with the community and has a clear indication of the mentality and mindset of players from bronze to Masters, rather then just ""Anything less then Diamond is shit, you can A-move using only macro to Diamond in NA""   And if thats the case I think he would be an awesome pair to another caster whom is very in touch with Higher level leagues (Nathan) As from what twitch streams I have watched, his Co-caster Nathanias is a fantastically witty Caster who pokes and prods his audience along with joking at bad players and plays. For someone who clearly is trying to move into this and working hard. They should be rewarded (in the same way if you work really hard at your job to get your promotion, you dont expect some guy working a completely different job saying ""Well fuck him he's never been in that job before so he should not be allowed"" )  Whats wrong with another person trying to cast? Why would it be bad to have new casters?  Removing the chance for anyone to ever try casting at a high level would be the same as a collage only accepting applications from people who have previous collage experience.    Just my thoughts."
starcraft,3dyz9z,Mimical,5,Mon Jul 20 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"I listen to the Late Game from time to time, which has many guests from the SC2 world.  Sadly, the weakest link is always the host, Lycan.  I'll give it a listen, but my expectation is that I ""will shit my pants"" at how bad he is."
starcraft,3dyz9z,djcahill,4,Mon Jul 20 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"unfortunately i agree with ur sentiments, Lycan is the weakest link & its his own show.

Critical thinking skills seem to be a challenge as well as often there will be an issue brought forth & he just appears simpleminded in regards to the discussion.

His talk show I only watch when Destiny or someone seriously interesting is on, otherwise it's a full-on sleep fest. I guarantee the majority of his audience feels similarly. The guy does seem nice, but he sort of slotted himself into the position he has with zero qualifications, got destiny, and sort of did jack shit to move onto wherever he is now. Some weird bullshit ambassador of vague blizzard news (and updates on what NDA he signed this week).    This is a stupid move, and although I have serious respect for nathanias, I'm going to lose a bit if he actually goes through with it. I'm sure he'll get on his stream and tell everyone how hard he thinks lycan works or how nice he is, etc, but none of that changes the fact that we're losing fuck tons of viewers because the games simply aren't engaging. Adding on awful casting is not going to help things. It sucks. He doesn't deserve the spot."

I get that these are examples but they aren't exactly valid. Even doing this would continue on with the same philosophy of recycling talent. To those on the outside looking for a way in, it feels like a club you'll never be allowed to become a part of because you missed the boat five years ago.    New faces are needed. New things need to be tested and experimented with since the scene isn't exactly thriving.

Do you have replays of you holding the allins with hatch first?

starcraft,3e2vqx,droonick,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"Ever used a reaver?  It's a unit with no actual attack, slow as can be, requires babysitting, and can deal out the damage.  What I recommend is putting more time into the beta before drawing conclusions.  Read about how others are using the disrupter and how to control it before making quick decisions about the unit.  It sounds to me like you've brushed across each of the races and scratched the surface."
starcraft,3e2vqx,taomcdohl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've only been playing for less than a week. I think my OP came out a bit too judgemental towards the unit but mostly I'm looking for people's thoughts on how to use it effectively,  and people's suggestions towards it now that a lot of people are settling down on the beta. I agree though when I look at like a Reaver it starts to make more sense."
starcraft,3e2vqx,Blackheart595,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"Especially with the Colossus nerf, I think you can think of the disruptor as some kind of siege unit. Of course, it has plenty other possible uses and is very different from usual siege units. However, it can rush in with invincibility, deal a good amount of damage, and then retreat with it's new follow-up invincibility. Apart from it's attacking mechanism, it's quite similar to typical siege units: It's pretty slow (although that's not that unusual for Protoss units) and quite squishy, and it usually sits protected behind the main army - apart from when it attacks of course, though that's because of it's unique mechanics, and then it's invulnerable. Like other siege units, it isn't stopped by force fields and deals splash damage."
starcraft,3e2vqx,taomcdohl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"Of course, unlike other siege units, it can't actually lay siege to fortified defenses.  Kind of the purpose of a siege unit.  XD  The disrupter isn't a siege unit, it's essentially a glass canon.  A high dps, low defense unit that needs to be protected similar to the HT.  I'd say it's more like a giant moving widowmine than a siege unit."
starcraft,3e2vqx,Blackheart595,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"You're right of course. However, not all sieges have the direct goal to destroy the enemy base (even though it's always the final goal in Starcraft) - there are enough examples of sieges that simply tried to stop anyone from leaving the base (or castle).  Actually, the Disruptor has much greater offesive capabilities than the widow mine - the widow mine can't directly attack enemy units because it'd be killed before it's set-up. And it can't be stopped unless you fully wall yourself in, in which case your main army can step forward and work on the wall and static defense.  When using the Disruptor as a siege unit, you will use your main army to actually destroy the base, while the Disruptor's job is to keep the enemy army back.  Then again, the Disruptor obviously has more uses than only that."

But in your idea it would still cost supply and be treated like a unit while not being one.  -The problem of an upgrade to units when standing in a ""field"" is that it's not interesting from a player or viewer PoW. It favorises turtle plays (yay !) and camping of a small number of bases until obtaining a deathball (yay !).  Your changes are all defensive and prevent agression and map presence for the protoss army. While the current state of the balance is not completly satisfying I don't think you're going in the right direction.  TLDR : ""complicated, boring and not balanced"" /u/Radiokopf"

All you have to do is not have the chat open, pretty simple. If you really think that your argument would fall apart because chat is rustling your jimmies too hard and you cannot figure out where the red-X button is on the window then you might not be fit to debate anything."
starcraft,3dx0la,HackScratch,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that my argument would fall apart because of the chat. The main problem is Destiny's ego. There's no point in arguing with him, because he has an echo chamber. Have you ever seen an argument with Destiny? He memes with the chat the whole time and repeats the same thing over and over again until the opponent is too bothered to argue with him anymore. Second to that, Destiny's chat are the type to ridicule you and shame you and your family for the rest of your life if you disagree with him. To this very day, people that have disagreed with Destiny are constantly getting harassed. I'm sure /u/lisward has experienced it. What's the fucking point of arguing with Destiny then? So he can make another ""into the mind of"" series where he pretends to be a professional psychologist? Fuck that. It's not worth it."
starcraft,3dx0la,LifeOrb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"That is true. Although we disagreed with each other I didn't think our discussion ended on a poor note. Destiny did a fundraiser after to ban me for 30 days, then he got word that I was the mastermind of some sort of evil Al Qaeda terrorist cell that was behind every single troll in chat, and he decided to permanently ban me. It was pretty funny how there was a huge backlash on his subreddit after, and he decided to change his story to the tune of 'he is a rapist'.  Which is funny because A) Destiny has talked about (he talks a lot about a lot of things to be fair) how false rape accusations ruin people's lives and B) his ex-girlfriend, which he was still close with (he got her to verbally attack me on teamspeak), when confronted, told me that Destiny was a hypocrite and he forced himself on her one time when she told him to get off.  To this day I still get harassed and called a rapist when I post on the sc reddit."

starcraft,3dx0la,NeoDestiny,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"(1) Generally speaking Destiny will stop you from uttering an unsound premise before the full argument has been constructed. I would think the reason he does this in particular because in a discussion about the actual world there is no use distancing ourselves from it with counterfactuals. Usually his premises are sound, and when you reject his premises (such that they are unsound) he usually falls in line with what seems to be the objective facts about the reality you live in. Though it does take some convincing, if you are making some claims A and B which entail C, where C is your conclusion, the onus IS on Destiny to disprove A or B - so where the hinge of the debate lies. So you shouldn't blame him for that when his positions are (as a matter of fact) reasonable.  (2). The members of Destiny's chat are friendly with and still talk to Lisward. I don't think it's fair to downplay a community you have insufficient experience in - but of course whether Lisward feels harassed is his call.  (3). The point of arguing with Destiny is the same reason you argue with anyone in a Philosophy class or otherwise. You want to convince the opponent your argument is unsound. Your argument cannot be sound if we cannot proceed from one of the core premises to which your argument relies.  (4). XJ9 thinks posting nude images of his girlfriend online is an appropriate response to not being given the opportunity to pick Lee Sin.  (5). If you DO NOT want your views to be broadcasted and publicised, then don't argue with a man with three-thousand average viewers live on Twitch.tv. Have a sensible god-damn discussion and know what you're talking about. Destiny cannot make you look like an ass.  (6) From (5) even if you feel an experience on Destiny's stream makes you feel that way, Destiny is responsible for his actions but when you make the decision you want to argue live on stream, then you cannot consistently blame that man for the actions of his community and others. That, in particular, is not fair on Destiny when you yourself engage in liaison with his audience."

starcraft,3dx0la,FLABREZU,-2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"How does the audience influence anything? The chief reason why people sided me despite disliking me is because of the fact that I dared to argue with you in teamspeak, and arguing with you means dealing with your cronies talking over me and berating me with insults, rape accusations and racial slurs.  Going onto teamspeak to talk to you is like akin to a liberal politician going onto a Fox news talk show to get shit on and bullied by the correspondents. With an audience in the background cued to ridicule and interrupt the person at every go."

Now it's just getting to the point where he acts like a ten year old and people here it still praise him for ""keeping it real"" or having ""great character"".  And no, I haven't forgotten about the ragequit during that tournament, but apparently everyone here did.  e: On another note, the subreddit and community in general has a habit of forgetting about the shit people did way too quickly, but I won't be the one to name people and get lynched."
starcraft,3dx0la,Zeholipael,3,Mon Jul 20 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, leaving a tournament after one game is a felony after which people can't redeem themselves anymore, it is just too vicious.  Naniwa is probably the best and most frequently streaming educational protoss player, to the point where it would be foolish to miss out on his stream as a protoss.    He does not rage that often on his stream, he is mostly venting his anger for 15-30 minutes after some very unfortunate losses. If you provoke him during that by writing something like ""Stephano would have won"" or ""I love Destiny"", you earn yourself a permaban. As he sometimes says, be nice to him and he will be nice to you."

I honestly think you are exaggerating a a bit. Was it unprofessional of him to forfeit? Yes. Was it a good excuse to say that he even didn't want to participate in the first place but was forced to? No - if you have a contract you have to do your job - even if you don't enjoy it. But first, the non existing sound proffness (is this a word?) of the booths were a serious problem for someone who was trying to use a cheesy strategy and second, you shouldn't be that unforgiving - getting booed from the stage is propably punishment enough for a pro gamer."

He also responds to just about everyone who asks him a direct question in chat, which makes you feel like you are just hanging around with him discussing SC2.

We got plenty of real sportsman who treat opponents with respect from europe. im glad im not swedish because that guy would want me to switch countrys.  flame me all you want. i hate this fucker. he´s always like a diva thinking hes something better.

starcraft,3dx0la,varroth,7,Mon Jul 20 13:35:27 2015 UTC,He is clearly good for the game. Whenver he plays in tournaments/qualifiers it has 5-10k+ more viewers. For example when he ''unretired'' and qualified for WCS the viewership was almost like double of what it had been before.

starcraft,3dym10,wyatt_ttayw,7,Mon Jul 20 16:31:25 2015 UTC,Flash vs Bbyong on Waystation was the craziest game I have seen. I believe it was in clan wars by total biscuit.
starcraft,3dym10,DJHelium,5,Mon Jul 20 17:54:08 2015 UTC,Here's the entire series. It's beautiful.
starcraft,3dym10,Patzzer,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:02 2015 UTC,yo that series was seriously one of my favorites
starcraft,3dym10,lippala,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed - absolutely superb series, and that game in particular was nuts."
starcraft,3dym10,DJHelium,5,Tue Jul 21 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"My favourite games of all time, somewhat hipster and definitely terran biased!    Gumiho vs Losira, 2013 WoL. This game had it all. Insane plays and really weird situations. Best game of 2013 imo.    San vs Nestea, 2011 WoL. The creator of the universe vs the laughing stock of GSL. Nestea was known for being the best player in the world. San was known for blocking his own expansion with a pylon.    Artosis was so confident in Nestea winning that he said he would swallow a sword if the upset happened. What follows is one of the best macro games so far in the short history of SC2.    Supernova vs jjakji, 2011 WoL. Short and sweet, this game prestented one of the strangest situations ever in Sc2. This game made me a jjakji fan! :D   Innovation vs Curious, 2013 HotS.. Maybe the best ZvT series ever. Everyone knows that Innovation had some insane TvZ during 2013, but few know that Curious had a >90% win rate in the matchup, losing only to the mech of Mvp. Afaik this is the only time the master's of the matchup face off, and what a series we get.    Innovation vs Mvp, 2013 HotS. The greatest comeback of all time. One of the last times we get to see the brilliance of the king of wings, a true masterpiece.    and last but not least...  DJHelium vs ForGG, 2013 HotS. While this is just a summary, this game showcases what Starcraft 2 is truly about - bragging :D  Anyway these are just off the top of my head. I suggest you check out SC2HL for some sick micro moves.  If you want more tips just PM me :D I've seen some stuff!  edit: oh and watch some of the best GSL finals. jjakji vs Leenock is my favourite, but the entire top 7 is good and top 3 insane! http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/starcraft-2/439780-gsl-finals-retrospective-part-2-7-1"
starcraft,3dym10,Jazonxyz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"Innovation vs Mvp, 2013 HotS. The greatest comeback of all time. One of the last times we get to see the brilliance of the king of wings, a true masterpiece.   This is my favorite game ever.  Let me set the mood for this one.  So there's MVP, a Terran player.  He was the best ever.  He's not as good this days, but you still think fondly of him.  He was the undisputed best player in the Wings of Liberty era.  He's the big brother you always wanted, but never had.  When he was in top shape, he would almost always win and you really looked up to him.  He was cooler than this.  Then, there's Innovation.  He came out of nowhere and started performing really well.  He's a quiet guy, and if you watch his games, you see him sadistically pick his opponents apart.  He constantly eliminates your favorite pros early in tournaments.  You hate this guy, but he's just too damn good.  His best matchup is TvT.  At the time, he was considered the best Terran in the world.  He plays a match against MVP, and in one of the games, Innovation is relentlessly tearing MVP appart, to the point that MVP is in a theoretically unwinnable position.  What happens next, is something that cannot be written about.  You'll have to watch for yourself.  A bit of the aftermath:  MVP never returned to being one of the top players in the world.  Innovation eventually moved to Acer, one of his best strategies was nerfed to the ground, and he appeared in a few interviews that let us get some insights into his personality, and we realized that he's really just a nice guy.  He's no longer perceived as a tyrant, he's one of the good guys now like Piccolo in DBZ."

A little context (I hope I'm getting this right from memory), Innovation was widely considered the best player in the world at the time.  However, in the previous season of GSL, Innovation and Soulkey matched up in the finals with Innovation taking an early 3-0 lead but Soulkey bringing back a reverse all-kill to win the finals 4-3.  This game was the first game of their next meeting in the Ro8 of code S.  At the time I remember thinking it was the highest level of play out of two players I had ever seen before in SC2."

starcraft,3dyyv4,Helicase21,12,Mon Jul 20 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"eh. its hard. For 1 there is a difference between balance and design. People have bias based on misinterpreting this also based on their race.   .  Then you have the whole different balance at different skill level aspect. I think everyone can agree balance changes  as you go higher and higher up so is the balance the same in WCS Challenger league and GSL? Should those numbers be added together to determine overall balance are should the lower skilled players be ignored?  .  Then you have the whole map pool issue. Do we want to know the balance in the current map pool? So does that discount those GSL and SSL games on older maps for whatever reason? I think its safe to say the balance on a map like deadwing is much different then say moonlight madness.   .  What about just high varience in skill level of invites? Look at IEM where they invited 4 of the 5 best toss players, and then the next best player was TY, who while is good, is safe to say is a tier 2 terran. Should those results also be thrown out?  .  And last issue is just general varience that you have with games and sample sizes. People with specialist matchups, great players hitting snipers (like maru getting snipped tvt by bravo) people just feeling sick (parting vs sacrsi), players getting surprised by new map abuses (parting vs targa), sample sizes (players winning tournies is a small sample size).  .  so TLDR: There are a shit ton of factors that make it very very hard to judge balance just using numbers, and most other ways is bogged down by bias."

With rain and parting both being on foreigner teams (mYi and Yoe flash wolves) they're able to travel a lot more often and foreigner-stop. Players like maru, innovation, life, soO arent able to travel as much and thus can't stomp these events.   It has nothing to do with balance when that occurs, and it skews results a lot."

starcraft,3dyyv4,webo09,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"I never listen or use a single persons experience since it's not accurate and people have false memories. Aligulac is very good as measuring balance at the pro level and tracks a huge amount of games, anything outside of ladder is tracked there. As for at play levels below Masters is tricky since Blizzard is the only one that has 100% of that data though other sites have partial data which has enough data to be accurate with a few percentage points but with a game as finely balanced as this a 3% margin of error is very large.  I do think most people and pros agree that HotS is in a very good spot overall and the fact the SH patch actually saw a more even win % is likely a good sign of Blizzard happy with where it's at, especially since we likely won't see another patch until LotV is released.  I guess it comes down to the fact there is no perfect method. Aligulac is good for measuring balance at the top but it's so hard to look at the population as a whole since so many people only rely on their own experiences which are tainted by self report issues and people tend to remember losses than wins."

starcraft,3dyyv4,gkts,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Aha you are oversimplifying. All races win percentages will be 50% given a large enough sample size, and the performance of a race in one matchup is entirely meaningless.  Think: any player's individual win percentage is 50% over a long time, just as their race is. To take that further, imagine that vikings were taken out of the game. This would impact TvP the most, which means that individual terran players would all naturally perform worse against the protosses they used to be even with. This lowers their MMR, and means that they play weaker zergs now. So with TvZ mostly the same, they will beat zerg more. Thus, through what is obviously a nerf, terran win percentage in TvZ increased. Just one example of why these stats are more complex than that."
starcraft,3dyyv4,capcomist,0,Mon Jul 20 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but still a 50-50 in all matchups would be perfect balanced. As long as this or something clsoe to this is reached, you got a balanced game.  In your example TvP would be around 40-60 and TvZ at 60-40 (arbitrary numbers)."
starcraft,3dyyv4,gkts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but still a 50-50 in all matchups would be perfect balanced. As long as this or something clsoe to this is reached, you got a balanced game.   No. Because there are different skill ceilings. Let's take this hypothetical scenario:   There is a unit. Let's call it Bob. Bob is a very hard to control unit, but if it is done properly it is the most overpowered unit you can imagine. 90% of players are not able to control Bob to that potential and have balanced games.  Now there are the top 10% of players who can use the full potential and thanks to Bob they stomp everyone. No one would say that the game is balanced, but the winning percentage overall could be 50-50. The same thing is true for SC2, but there is no Bob unit."

starcraft,3dyyv4,ch4ppi,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:06 2015 UTC,League placement is determined by performance though.  If you're not winning 50% of your games you get demoted to a lower league.  Maybe the racial distribution of each league would be good but that gets into how relatively popular the races are.    You could look at league distribution of individual races but that can be influenced by which races noobs see as the easiest race to learn (probably Terran given how straightforward the mechanics are).  Maybe you could look at the rate of league promotion per race but I'm not sure if that's much better than looking at the distribution.  tl;dr - it's harder than you'd think.

We mostly decide this on a case-by-case basis. Generally we will add a round from a tournament if that round contains a significant number of already rated players. (Usually higher than 25% or so.) For the large regular cups this usually means somewhere around top 16 to 8.  One common exception to this rule is large national tournaments, which when rated would create a «rating bubble». We try to avoid this as best we can, but it's a difficult thing to do. We are more lenient with tournaments where a significant proportion of the participants regularly compete internationally (Korea, Germany, Poland and Sweden), or if the tournament is significant in another way (such as TeSL)."
starcraft,3dyyv4,OMGTallMonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"There is no universal variable to watch out for, but there are a good amount of balance indicators around that should fluctuate around a balance (50-50 for matchups, 33-33-33 for representation and wins). The most important ones of those are probably:   overall winrates, best taken from aligulac - usually when there is signigicance imbalance (e.g. Broodlord/Infestor TvZ), aligulac will show at least +/-5% deviation of 50% winrates in tournaments - in particular WCS/GSL/SSL -, collected from sites like Liquipedia. In eras of very one-sided matchups (e.g. PvT during the blink era) there are often multiple tournaments with 70%+ winrates in a certain matchup tournament wins/placement: if various players of a single race can take 50% or more of all tournaments over something like half a year to a year than that race was probably too strong in at least one matchup racial representation - in particular WCS/GSL/SSL. Since the statistical assumption should be that talent is somewhat equally distributed, no race should usually have 50% or more players in tournaments.   If 1-2 of them are consistenly out of place, then we should indeed speak of a balance problem. Obviously, numbers aren't everything and a qualitative analysis is still mandatory. Numerical imbalance usually stems from certain gameplay facts and without finding at least one specific reason that characterizes many games on the highest level (there can be multiple ones) there is no good claim for a balance problem."

starcraft,3dyyv4,AquitaineHungerForce,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:57 2015 UTC,"To answer the specific question whether Protoss is overpowered right now in HotS or not, we can simply go through the indicators:   overall winrates of protoss seem to be well in the target frame WCS/GSL/SSL winrates seem to fluctuate both ways, but are on average in the target range tournament wins are skewed towards Protoss in the last 8-9months by taking around 50% of the wins the racial representation overall is good; Protoss has slight advantages the longer the tournaments go (which is a statistic that basically only extends the tournament win statistic)   In conclusion I wouldn't say Protoss is really imbalanced at the moment, but they are doing a little bit better than the other two races. Which could be a temporary (metagame) fluctuation or a build up towards imbalance, but certainly not imbalance itself."

starcraft,3dyyv4,TheWinks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, in SSL its true, protoss has had up to 50% representation. But they had 12/32 and 10/32 in GSL (Terran had 13/32 and 12/32 in those seasons). In Proleague Round 2 the fieldings were: T:62, P:60, Z:58, which is amazingly balanced. Same for Round 1 with P:65, T:64, Z:61 appearances. In WCS Premier Protoss had 10/32 and 9/32 players, which is also quite in the target range. So besides the SSL seasons, there is absolutly nothing indicating Protoss being in the lead in this category.

starcraft,3dyyv4,moooooseknuckle,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:43:53 2015 UTC,That is just completely unfounded bullshit. Cheese can succeed in a Bo3 just as much. And you can always look at map score anyway...

The difference is that in those series, you are forced to play non-cheese games or you will -- for the most part -- lose to the player who adapts to your shenanigans.  Balance discussion is thrown out the windows in those anomalies.  In something like Proleague, balance is increasingly difficult to figure out because you have teams getting together to create the craziest cheeses -- that ignore balance -- and take advantage of the standard metagame.  This is possible because they know exactly which map everyone is going to play on.  Balance in a situation like this is understated in comparison to looking at the grand scheme of things.  When people say look at GSL and SSL, obviously nobody is talking about one series.  It's about the overall tournament performance.  But in Proleague, that is nearly impossible to do since every game is an attempted snipe."

starcraft,3dyyv4,thurg,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:36:32 2015 UTC,It works like this. If Terran isn't winning 75% of the tournaments... then the game is imbalanced.

The nature of an open tournament is a lot of down time. However, the production has slumped a bit and they no longer play entertaining content during breaks that usually mitigates the viewership loss that accompanies long breaks. 3. There was an over saturation of SC2 this past week/weekend - regardless of time zones, it has an impact and reduces the hype.   The point is that you are trying to cite DreamHack numbers as a reason to call the game dead. Can't do that if there are glaringly obvious reasons the viewership was low, chief."

I can't remember ever seeing a DH final under 40k. If the production ""slumped"" and they no longer play this content you speak of then that reason for the dropoff in viewers will be permanent. You are in denial  Proleague doesn't even get 10k viewers anymore. Just accept that the game is shrinking and stop caring. Everyone here has such an inferiority complex.

This is obviously exagerated (because of this specific round needs), splitting on creep is something in the middle.

starcraft,3dyp1h,Mentioned_Videos,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:47 2015 UTC,It looked good regarding the general splitting of marines.  But I think some people don't realize is that it's not just about minimizing baneling hits.  It's also about managing your marines so you are splitting the ones that can get hit while having the others still attacking.  Should still be actively attacking and splitting as the fight goes on.
starcraft,3dyp1h,VoiceSC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is very important. The kind of micro executed in this video is actually introduced in LotV with indestructible disruptors - although it has a timer on it so you still need to do faster, smaller splits."

It's more of an issue in csgo but I could see it sometimes being a problem in sc2 as well at very high levels.  For example at 60fps at 60Hz you can only issue 60 commands per second, but at 120fps at 60Hz you can issue 120 commands per second."

Otherwise, everybody running at 60 hz monitors would be limited to ~83 APM.  The problem with lower framerates is that the response time is longer. If you click somewhere then you will see the changes around 3-4 frames later which is a big deal if you're playing at 30 fps: 100-120 ms input latency just on client side."

starcraft,3e23f6,TiredMiner,4,Tue Jul 21 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"I want invulnerability to be gone as much as the next guy, mostly because of the lack of counterplay it causes. However , before doing that you need to analyse why there is invulnerability in the first place and what removing it and implementing your suggestion will achieve.  Now for the nydus  mostly it makes for a really strong cheese. It may have some lategame implementations, but that does not worth the negatives. In the end i think nydus was in a problematic place because of it's core design so i will not linger on invulnerability with nydus. Just remove it , so that the unnecessarily strong cheese stops  As for  the distrupter the invulnerability plays a crucial part. As you are aware the distrupter has a very unusual design. Normally AoE siege units have a very long range, little health and slow movement speed, so that they can assault any entrenched position regardless of how entrenched they are. The counterplay is to somehow get over the army protecting them to take them out.   Distruptor is very well designed as a siege aoe unit. However because it is close range some adjustments have to be maid. It needed something to allow closing on entrenched positions and to deal damage , regardless of many units there are in that position. Thus invulnerability was given.  Now if there was a shield or armor buff instead of invulnerability , the unit would be able to take down small sized forces, but if you mass enough units in one place ,they would be able to kill the unit before it can hit. This leads to the safest counterplay against the unit to be creating a deathball. That is not a wanted outcome. When the distruptor goes into a massive bio ball, it should kill a lot unless the opponent microes, but with a shield or armor , it would just die without doing anything.  However i have a suggestion that might add the lacking a counterplay element to the unit , while still taking protecting the siege unit effect the invulnerability is giving. The idea is simple , create a shield  on X range around the distrupter that makes it invulnerable to the damage outside of that range , but vulnerable to within that range."
starcraft,3e23f6,Otuzcan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:29:01 2015 UTC,"I think this would actually be a buff to the disruptor, as it will now draw fire from a-moved units. It basically becomes a giant damage-soaking ball of impending doom.  You'd have to lower their targeting priority while in this mode in order for this to work. Nydus worms are buildings and as such will not have the same issue."
starcraft,3e23f6,DoSdnb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:26:39 2015 UTC,I don't see disruptors being useful at all later in the game once army sizes increase with this change. Having lurkers be the counter to disruptors is a scary proposition. It will put protoss lategame against zerg 100% on mass carriers without any other possibilities.     Also I havn't found nyduses invulnerability ability to be to overwelming. It would probably be fine either way. It was just annoying when they could die to workers easily though.

starcraft,3dxerv,Ziiaaaac,7,Mon Jul 20 12:03:51 2015 UTC,It can't be a normal Proleague round without Jin Air fucking it up vs a worse team.
starcraft,3dxerv,Dezib,0,Mon Jul 20 11:50:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far, Jin Air literally have one good player which showed in the finals when Maru literally had to put them on their back. SoS is good but good in a cheesy way. The Samsung coaches played this really well to snipe Maru with their TvT specialist."
starcraft,3dxerv,Ziiaaaac,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:47 2015 UTC,"Because Bravo and Journey are better than sOs (former WCS Global Champion / IEM Global Champion) and Rogue (When was the last time he didn't make Ro8 in both GSL and SSL?).  Not even mentioning their WCS AM Champion, their MLG Champion and their GSL Finalist."
starcraft,3dxerv,BaptisteVillain,3,Mon Jul 20 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"At what point did I say that? I just said I wouldn't call Samsung a worse team than Jin Air, which I think is a fair assessment.   The top three teams for over all power are the telecom teams, SKT and KT, and CJ. obviously in an all kill scenario Jin Air can do well because - Maru.   Then I'd say Samsung, Jin Air and Sbenu are on the next level.   and MVP and Prime are on the bottom, even though Prime is drastically bellow MVP.   SKT, KT and CJ have stacked rosters where Jin air's got one really good player and two decent players in Rouge and sOs.   CJ: Byul and herO are both players on Maru's level, then they've got Bbyong who's a bit bellow, this was the team that I was like hmm maybe they're on the telecom teams level for pro league but maybe they're like Jin Air.   KT: Life, Stats, Zest all three of these guys are easily on Maru's level, then they've got Flash as well, I don't need to say anything about flash, and TY is a good looking up and comer.   SKT: Obviously I don't have to tell you SKT is stacked. Classic, Dark, Dream, soO all players on Maru's level and an amazing line up for pro league with soO being on a what? 9-10 ZvZ undefeated streak? Then they've got Innovation who's falling off a bit, but innovation is still innovation. Impact gave a good showing in Kespa cup against Maru, took a convincing Macro game off of Maru that's impressive in it's own right.   Obviously Samsung don't have a Maru or an sOs but they've got Dear, Hurricane, Solar, Journey and Reality who're all pretty decent players, and BrAvO is looking even more so recently like an INSANE TvT sniper.   Yes Jin Air are going to finish higher than Samsung in the solo cups but when it comes to Pro League in the round robin format Samsung is 100% on Jin air's level, and they're on Jin air's level in the playoff all kill format as well, because if BrAvO can come out and fuck over Maru, Jin air are on the ropes."
starcraft,3dxerv,Acias,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"Rating Samsung that can't reach a playoff for 3 seasons on the same level as Jin Air that made to the finals of all play offs seems a bit generous IMO. Both solo results and pro league results show that Jin Air line up is way stronger, even if Jin Air had to go 3-2 against Samsung on all 3 previous rounds (Maru was never fielded as Ace against Samsung, so it's not only Maru).  And Jin Air is easily on KT's level, as shown all year long too (5 matches between these teams, 5 wins for Jin Air), so it's hard to consider KT in the leading pack, but Jin Air out.  TL DR: yes, ""Jin Air fucked it up vs a worse team."""
starcraft,3dxerv,baconpandiculation,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:56 2015 UTC,I expect Prime to lose 0 - 3. It's sad but i hope for a different score. Maybe Keen can win his game but i don't see how the others can win theirs.

Zerg already doenst need to build production(except for hatcheries and queens), they dont need to build units constantly. They just need to inject, which is in my oppinion the coolest mechanic (compared to M.U.L.E.S. ot chronoboost).  Im a Zerg and i would hate autocast for inject."

Sure you can do all the strategies you want, but fact is if you don't have larva and you do have energy on your queens, you have something that you can look at and say, I need to work on this part of my play. If I just had 8 more Roaches i would've held that push off. If i would've had 20 more lings I would've pushed back that push. Its the main mechanic of zerg that makes it a challenge of playing since if you slip up on doing it, you will lose because you won't be able to make your army."
starcraft,3e03bx,Worldisdoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:39 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is to keep up your macro and to not overdrone & hotkeying your eggs. It's incredibly easy to get caught off guard by all-ins and Zerg does not have much recovery potential. Learn safe overlord positions for each maps, covering drops and seeing when your opponent leaves the base if possible. Scouting is key, unlike other match ups which rely a lot on army composition, Zergs heavily rely on economy, knowing when to cut drones and when you can get away with making nothing but drones will really determine your position in the middle-game. Creep spread is important vs Bio, a little less vs Toss, but still needed if you're going Roach Hydra.  As for micro, I think Zergs have it easy. Don't lose Mutas, don't a-move banes, look for run-bys and hotkey your energy units correctly and you should be good to go. Concaves mean a lot, and try to get into position before the enemy, deny Protoss players from getting into positions where they can FF your army and Terran players where they can safely put down mines and zone you out while they poke at your buildings. As for ZvZ, it's incredibly difficult to end games with Mutas, and 1 mistake could cost you. So if you have an advantage, it's good to have roaches as a backup plan."
starcraft,3e03bx,k1nocturne,0,Tue Jul 21 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"The only things I keep in mind with zerg as a terran off racing is that you want evos around 7 minutes(atleast vs terran), you put your workers back in your gas when you take your third and if you make a bunch of queens to spread creep and you drop a bunch of new tumors at the edge of creep that shit spreads really fast despite how bad you are at it.   Also, keep in mind when people have stuff to attack you with because that is when you start making attack units. you want to drone as fast and as hard as you can until max saturation before you make attack units. When you are harassing with mutas for instance, you want to drone and macro up."

He never gets outplayed and his opponent is either really dumb or really bad.  He's so ridiculous he thinks speedvacs are okay and may need buffed in ever matchup except for tvt since he goes mech and thinks bio dd drops are too hard to stop.. yea.

Not as many serious players there. But still a good answer. I just find it strange that you would appear out of nowhere, on reddit of all places, to try and clear someone elses name."
starcraft,3dy922,GodlikeGuy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"Because I've been around the scene a long time and I look around at my surroundings. The direction SC2 is headed is NOT beneficial for me or anyone else who broadcasts SC2 live full time. The last thing we need is a top SC2 streamer trying to defame a legitimate player furthering said decline. So as I do understand I have little to no pull in the community the fact of the matter is the content I provided is quite accurate and VERY relevant to the situation.

starcraft,3dy922,moneycomet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, RuFF and others have also called out PiliPili  He has done very strange things, such as doing the exact same build 2 games in a row but the game where RuFF goes for banshee has gets cannons at 7 minutes and the game where he doesnt its at like 12-13 minutes, he did this consistently over 4-5 games without seeing a different opener from RuFF or having any indication on whether he was or was not going banshee.  Pili is a good player on stream, but it seems only in tournaments he pulls this weird stuff."
starcraft,3dy922,ZerGJunO,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:45 2015 UTC,Stream cheating against known streamers and map hacking are pretty different though.

starcraft,3dy922,gabest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:38 2015 UTC,That's nonsense Pili understands playsytles. He will even break down what he should have done after being bounced from a tournament. Against Jon Snow he was caught completely unaware of how to beat proxy hatch on Bridgehead. He got bounced from WCS Qualifier then refined a way to beat Jon Snows style on ladder.  Doesn't seem like a cheater to me.
starcraft,3dy922,moneycomet,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:07 2015 UTC,And this is exactly why you need a much bigger pool of games than 4-5.

When i don't want to ladder i would love to offrace, but it isn't feasible without tanking.     I like playing both on NA and EU to the best of my abilities.    Also i wonder how people feel about playing matchups they just dont like. I would love to be able to veto a matchup. This season i just dont want to play ZvZ, so i don't.   Even though it is probably the last season for HotS i just get so frustrated in that matchup. Maybe Masters or higher shouldn't be allowed to veto matchups."
starcraft,3dtlw1,lostdrone,177,Sun Jul 19 10:22:11 2015 UTC,"Vetoing of match-ups is something people have talked about a little in the past.  My personal opinion is that it shouldn't be allowed in ranked ladder, but it should be allowed in unranked.  This would allow unranked to become a much more useful practice tool - If you want to really work on one match-up, or perfect a particular build you can get the match-up you need every time.  There are a bunch of reasons I wouldn't want it in ranked mode, but a big one is that it encourages people to give in to their biases and veto a race because they think it's overpowered. In turn this actually discourages people from improving because they hide from their worst match-ups by vetoing them."
starcraft,3dtlw1,lostdrone,37,Sun Jul 19 10:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yea that makes a lot of sense.

starcraft,3dtlw1,Sanity_Sc2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding.     What I'm telling you is that when you press ""Play Ranked"" you can face other players who pressed ""Play Unranked"". If Unranked is ever to be a place for people to play casually and/or practice then they have to separate the queues from eachother.     As of now Unranked is just a copy of Ranked, but without points being lost/gained for the player who pressed ""Play Unranked"""
starcraft,3dtlw1,Dislol,2,Mon Jul 20 10:29:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, I thought that may be the case, but I wasn't sure.  Definitely a wonky system."
starcraft,3dtlw1,Petninja,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:27 2015 UTC,"That's true, except that it tracks it's own MMR. Realistically, the setup right now is optimal for keeping queue times down."
starcraft,3dtlw1,Sanity_Sc2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, the queue times would become longer.  It's kinda sad to see the playerbase so divided simply because they're afraid to lose points or just wanna play on an even footing as their offrace's.  Unranked is doing a poor job of being the 1v1 casual mode they should definitely look to flesh it out to become another stepping stone towards 1v1 ranked mode or just casual fun.   Maybe make a more casual/newbfriendly map-pool (2-player maps/Smaller maps)? Maybe add daily quests in the style of Hearthstone and Heroes? (Win against Protoss/Kill a worker before 5 min)"

starcraft,3dtlw1,dundent,15,Sun Jul 19 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"Nothing is worse than finally trying to put time into practicing a matchup (PvT for example) because it's been kicking your ass and you want to improve and then falling on your face. You take some time to learn the timings that have been killing you, get people to help you, and you feel ready to start laddering again, knowing this matchup is not going to be auto-lose. You'll probably still lose, but you're starting to learn from your mistakes.  ...then the next 5 games are against only zerg and protoss. Also you haven't played a protoss in forever, so you forgot what the meta is like right now. ...oh, and in the first PvP they proxy gated, and the second they 4gated. ...so now you're on tilt, and when you finally do queue into a terran again you've forgotten everything you were trying to learn.  For example..."
starcraft,3dtlw1,HasuGuru,4,Sun Jul 19 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like your problem is that you get easily tilted, which is a problem with you and not a problem with the ladder.  If you work on your tilt problem, your other problems will go away."

starcraft,3dtlw1,Dragarius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:24 2015 UTC,I actually do think that the baneling is a bit OP in ZvZ (early game only) just because it can be a really tricky timing to be safe against it if you don't want to just end up in ling/Bane wars. Past the early game it's a fun match but I fucking hate the baneling battle that makes up almost every ZvZ opening.
starcraft,3dtlw1,therealovi,3,Sun Jul 19 16:35:27 2015 UTC,you think spamming roaches until 18 minutes is fun?
starcraft,3dtlw1,Dragarius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:59 2015 UTC,I choose not to do that. A few Ravagers (4) on the map can go overlord hunting allowing you to buy yourself some time as well as teching quickly to Lurkers can create a TON of safety.
starcraft,3dtlw1,Dislol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"Really?  I find it intense.  It forces me to micro while not fucking up my macro off 2 bases, while trying to find an opportunity to take a third, branch off to lair tech and win the game.  Watching people try (or not even try!) to kill off banelings with lings poking at them is fucking hilarious when you get that detonate off on way more than you deserved because of your opponents lack of micro control.  I hate fast roach maxes, but I find that 95% of the time I can win those games, so I don't get salty about the few losses to it."

starcraft,3dtlw1,Dislol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:11 2015 UTC,"I guess my matches are varied enough that it doesn't bother me.  I feel like I see each race enough.  I also admit I have zero idea of how the matchmaking works, because every day I face people in who are doing placement matches, people who are silver, gold, and the occasional platinum.  It makes zero sense to me, and even moving up leagues is a mystery.  I got placed in bronze, won 5 games and got put in top 8 of silver, took about 50 games with about 35 wins to put me in the top 8 of gold, now I've been top of my division in gold for over a week of laddering at least a handful of games every night, over 150 points above the next guy.  No idea where that promotion out of gold is, if it'll happen at all."

starcraft,3dtlw1,dr_entropy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:22 2015 UTC,"Unranked also uses one MMR across all three races, leading to the same off-racing problem.   Using one MMR per race let's you match in ranked or unranked play against someone who matches your skill level in that race."

They added Team Builder which allows me to do what i want and adjusts my MMR accordingly and has been quite nice.
starcraft,3dtlw1,bongothedark,62,Sun Jul 19 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"Please, please, PLEASE Blizzard listen to this. I started SC2 playing Terran and have thousands of games as Terran compared to the 20-30 of other races. The level of skill between races for me is drastic, so offracing in unranked just tanks my MMR which makes playing unranked Terran a little unfair/unfun.   I'm sure there would be issues with effectively tripling the users being rated for MMR; but it would be a massive quality of life improvement that could help encourage people to offrace more by being able to experience the ""ladder climb"" 3 times over.  Please think about it Blizzard, I know i can't be the only one who feels this way."
starcraft,3dtlw1,ro4ers,3,Sun Jul 19 10:42:37 2015 UTC,"Wait, unranked still affects your MMR?"
starcraft,3dtlw1,tvopenself,19,Sun Jul 19 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"You have a seperate MMR for ranked and unranked. But if you also play your main race on unranked, your MMR is about the same for both anyway."

starcraft,3dtlw1,StarGalaxy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:10:40 2015 UTC,This is true if you have less than low master MMR. Unranked MMR is capped there which means it's not possible to play high master to gm players who are playing ranked.
starcraft,3dtlw1,Dislol,2,Sun Jul 19 13:18:11 2015 UTC,"So do master/GM players who do unranked only match up against each other then?  If unranked MMR is capped, that just means that those who reach that cap have a wildly different pool of possible players to match against.  You're a high diamond/low master who peaked out the unranked MMR?  Guess we can queue you against a top GM who decided to fuck around on unranked, despite them probably never hitting you on ranked ever, due to disparity in rank."
starcraft,3dtlw1,StarGalaxy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:49:14 2015 UTC,So do master/GM players who do unranked only match up against each other then?    No they have capped MMR at high diamond and therefore play high diamond players. Disparity in rank is something that happens a lot on unranked not only in cases of capped mmr. A lot of players have a lower unranked mmr and just use it to play fun builds or experimental strategies.
starcraft,3dtlw1,frajen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:28:12 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true  The unranked MMR takes your ranked MMR as an initial starting point, but does not correlate to ranked MMR afterwards. So if you've never played unranked and are in diamond in ranked, then you play an unranked game, you'll be matched up against other unranked MMR's in the diamond range.  However if you played a couple unranked games back when you were in bronze, your unranked MMR is still bronze level, regardless of your ranked MMR"

If they give multiple MMRs it would open up the whole game to me. I would like to see how far I can get as Zerg and as Protoss, who knows, maybe I'm better at one of those matchups than I am at terran, but I don't want to have to buy 3 accounts to find out.

So, in honor of Blizzard's newly minted transparency, some questions they may want to answer for the community include:   Is there a plan to implement this feature in LotV? What are technical problems encountered when trying to implement this feature? What negative player behavior patterns do you think this might create, if any?

starcraft,3dtlw1,kastle09,14,Sun Jul 19 15:01:05 2015 UTC,"Okay so we all dont just jerk off in one direction I'm gonna do my best for some counter arguments. I play random and I don't really have an opinion on this so if it gets implemented. Cool!   So whats wrong with practicing a race in unranked instead where you don't have as much pressure. If its because you would get matched up against people with a skill level equivelent of your main race, why don't we think about adjusting the Unranked system, or how unranked works. Maybe it wouldn't matter so much in this game, but I've played a couple of games before where you had one character with sub classes but these classes had to be leveled up seperatley. the problem with this is that it felt incredibly grindy that you would have to repeat a lot of the same quests/missions. The equivlent I guess would be that you would have to beat up on bronze for over 100 games before the game truly finds your MMR which isn't much fun for the legit lower level players. Just because you dont play a race, a base skill set can get you to plat. As a random player, it doesn't mean I always select the random race. Some days I see Polt do something cool, so now I want to play like polt for a day. One day I think, Fuck I want to play any race but zerg at the moment. Its making my progress 3 times as slow as people who want to experiment a little.   I gotta repeat, I'm not against this as a change. I just feel like theres a lot of assumptions. And maybe we haven't dug deep enough to the problem, instead of just supplying this solution which may or may not be the most optimal one."
starcraft,3dtlw1,kastle09,9,Sun Jul 19 11:22:28 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with practising a race in unranked if you want to - but this doesn't solve the problem. For example, I main zerg and like to off-race as terran. If I use unranked to play terran, then my unranked MMR will be too low for me to usefully play unranked as zerg. I imagine this is what a lot of people do currently - essentially use unranked only as a second MMR for an off-race. Including separate MMR doesn't actually restrict anyones choices to do anything, it only gives more options to people. If you want to continue only playing one race in ranked and use unranked for off races that's totally your choice! As you say the grinding thing doesn't really apply in SC2 - if you don't want to rank up other races then don't. As for ""base skill"" - this is absolutely a thing. If you take a diamond terran player who has never played protoss before, he could probably beat gold (perhaps higher) players as protoss on mechanics alone. Is this a problem? No, not really. There is a placement system in the game for exactly this reason. You can do placement games for the other races on the new MMR and get near-ish where you should be. It also really doesn't take many games to go up the ladder if you're winning all the time - 100 is a massive exaggeration. This is an interesting point but only really applies to random mains - I can see how as a random main you might not want to keep up the MMR of all 3 races separately just so you can hop on them when you would like to. I'm not sure what the solution is there to be honest. But then to be really cold about it - this would only be a problem for a small percentage of people, and I feel like the benefits it brings would outweigh this - just opinion of course.   good discussion!"
starcraft,3dtlw1,AsterJ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"I like the example you gave, somedays you just don't want to play ranked, even for your main race and playing another race and ""ruining"" your unranked MMR would be bad. This makes me think that the way Unranked currently operates is not ideal, basically being ranked without the badge . I've been playing a lot of Ultra Street Fighter recently, And there system for ranked I actually think could be a relatively nice alternative for Starcrafts Unranked. In USF4, you can search for games based on Any Skill, Same Skilled or More Skilled. Basically the MMR doesn't change and It allows people who don't care and just want to play anyone even if its a stomp for them or against them, or people who are looking to challenge themselves. And what we have now basically. Only problem is this is a new form of mentality instead of expecting everygame to be a fair fight.  I might have been exagerating with 100, I just grabbed that number from thinking about the number of brand new players I see on SC Reddit that go ""WHY DO I VS LVL 120 GOLD PLAYERS AND IM BRONZE"", And generally people tell them they need to play a lot of games before the system finds a steady spot. If everytime someone tries a new race and it acts like they are a beginner I wouldn't like that. I would prefer the system try and figure it out with some of the existing data of the Main race, find there equilibrium faster, then it would be a much better system being the player and the opponent.  I always know that my peoples (Salute to Randoms) are gonna get the short end of the stick, its my one worry. Maybe i just gotta pray a little harder flipping that 3 sided coin."
starcraft,3dtlw1,two100meterman,2,Sun Jul 19 11:59:29 2015 UTC,"I think that the placement system in SC2 is not nearly rigorous enough currently. 5 games? Too few imo. I have a feeling this is what leads to a lot of posts from new players about getting smashed by gold players ect.  The other issue - which is makes this trickier is that the MMR values for the player base as a whole are probably close to a normal distribution, peaked somewhere in gold. The problem then is that there are actually very, very few players in low bronze to match against if you are a new player, but there are massive amount of players in gold.  As a result the matchmaker can have a really hard time finding you a bronze opponent to play, but there are guys in gold popping out of games constantly, so sometimes the matchmaker settles for the guy in gold.  Just in general, unless your player base is absolutely massive, matchmaking will always be hairy at the extremes of MMR, either very low or very high."
starcraft,3dtlw1,JohnCavil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:24:55 2015 UTC,Here's how I think random should work:  For matchmaking purposes they should use the MMR of your highest race.  If you don't do this then the opponent could have a very good idea of which of your races match with them before the game starts.  Also playing as random is a statement that you are prepared to play any race against your opponent so if they already know with which race you are being matched with it takes away the challenge.  Once the game has been finished though the MMR should be adjusted based on what race you had during the game.  So if you lost as protoss then your protoss MMR should take the hit even if the matchmaking for that game was based on your zerg MMR which is higher.
starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I was bored the other day and started playing Random on the Korean server and yeah... I'm Low-Diamond Zerg on NA, high-silver Toss on EU and low-silver Terran on SEA (this is what I personally do to have separate rankings for each race).  I'm currently mid-silver Random on KR but it's too much of a gongshow. First off Koreans are at least a league better, if I'm put against a Gold and I get Terran it feels like I'm against a Plat and it's not even close, then I get a few games where I am T and P and my MMR drops, then all of a sudden I'm against a bronze and to his bad luck I get Zerg... so I'm on 4 base with +3 +3 ling ultra and have him stuck on 1 base w/ unupgraded marines and marauders, poor guy.  When I'm T it should place me against bronze and silver, when im toss it should place me against silver and gold, and when I'm zerg i should mostly be against plats (plat KR is easily Diamond NA). If by some miracle my terran improves enough that i beat golds half the time or w/e then at that time i can be given the gold rank, but i don't think the rank matters as much, more the fact that I sometimes play sum1 2 leagues higher than my skill w/ that race and sometimes 4 leagues lower."
starcraft,3dtlw1,JohnCavil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:08 2015 UTC,"While I also see the benefit, as another player who plays Random there are some issues with making completely seperate rankings for every race. I often pick a race if I get tired of playing a certain matchup, which I woulnd't be able to do if that had a seperate MMR.  I also think peope overestimate how difficult it is to offrace. If you're a diamond Terran, you will be able to play at least high level plat protoss within one day of practicing. All of my races are almost the same level, even though i've probably played like 3 times as many Terran games as Protoss, it's 90% game knowledge and mechanics, unless you're like GM level.  I'd rather you have an unranked MMR for each race than a ranked one. Your ranked MMR is your personal best, not something you can have 4 of. Play unranked with every race and see where you land, but i'd rather not flood the ranked ladder with a bunch of offracers."
starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"I often pick a race if I get tired of playing a certain matchup, which I woulnd't be able to do if that had a seperate MMR.   Why wouldn't you be able to? Just pick a race and hit the button.  If it's intelligent designed you get a MMR for each race even when playing random."
starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"Because my main is all of the races, not a single one. So as of today when i play Terran or Zerg they both affect my main MMR, which it wouldn't under the new system. Therefore i'd prefer to have all races under one MMR so i can play all of them. I don't want to be a plat protoss, masters terran and diamond zerg, I just want to be a diamond random player  I realize most people don't care about it so it would be fair to change it I guess, but I think many random players wouldn't like it super much."
starcraft,3dtlw1,tejp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:50:47 2015 UTC,"Think of this: You hit the ladder as random, Sc2 decides your random pick is terran. It takes your terran MMR and searches for the right opponent.  This way you and your opponent would more likely get even games and matchmaking in general would get more stable.  It would also help if people could choose just two races as random, then they wouldn't get the third race they don't want/can play and leave or do stupid stuff which doesn't work."
starcraft,3dtlw1,NotWithoutIncident,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:03:50 2015 UTC,"So whats wrong with practicing a race in unranked instead where you don't have as much pressure. If its because you would get matched up against people with a skill level equivelent of your main race, why don't we think about adjusting the Unranked system, or how unranked works.   Every time I play not my main race on unranked I just get crushed. My mechanics may be there but I'm not used to anything. It would need A LOT of games, which I most likely would lose, to get either the ranking down or my skill up..."
starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,0,Sun Jul 19 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"For playing random, I think it should work well to make the MMR for Random a combination/average of the individual Race MMRs. Playing a Random game would adjust the MMR of the race that you ended up with.  Alternatively, when playing Random the game could first internally pick your race and then match you according to that races MMR."
starcraft,3dtlw1,NotWithoutIncident,6,Sun Jul 19 15:27:23 2015 UTC,While this would be cool to me a much bigger improvement would be exposing MMR so people can actually compare themselves in some meaningful way.

starcraft,3dtlw1,Terran_Too_Stronk,2,Sun Jul 19 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot. But where you said 'With separated MMR you give players literally four times (including random as a race) the opportunity...' Is it not actually just 3? Even with a random race, you still get to only play as 1/3 of the available races. So once a random race has been assigned to you, the MMR should then matches you with someone of equal skill to the race you got assigned?   Still love the idea"
starcraft,3dtlw1,jell-o,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"I mean that really, a completely separate MMR for random is required for a few different reasons.  Playing random at the same standard that you can play just one race is clearly much more challenging. I don't think anyone would argue with that. If you make random just contribute the the MMR of whatever race you roll when you queue, you're doing a disservice to random players because you couldn't earn a rank or league specifically as random.  It may be that you could get away with only 3 MMRs for 1v1 and leave random out, but so far I haven't seen good arguments why it should be left out so why should we? :)"

I could do a massive post on only this topic and all the possible benefits. My dream for SC2 would look something like this:   Allow players to earn an in-game currency through playing (having it be 'minerals' would be fun), possibly with daily quests like in hearthstone and heroes. Increase customisation potential by including more unit skins, HUD skins, portraits, announcer voice packs ect. Allow players to purchase these new features using their earned minerals. Allow the possibility to purchase in-game currency so blizzard has a way of monetising the game after release. This means they can actually get a return on the investment it would take to create new skins, voice packs ect.   They've done essentially all of this in heroes already - they are built in the same engine. It cannot possibly be out of reach for them to implement it into SC2 as well.  blizz pls"
starcraft,3dtlw1,terransdestroy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah but...quests would basically be limited to ""win x ladder games/day."" And since many people play MANY ladder games, there probably won't be much incentive to actually purchase minerals...minimizing the value of Blizzard implementing said micro-transaction shop. They have to spend money to implement that...they have to at least get all of it back, or more.  Fairly sure there was a thread about this already, and I think Blizzard's response has been ""we've no reason to implement micro-transactions."" as well as, ""custom skins not possible because of the RAM requirements they would have."" So...not sure about this ever happening, buddy."
starcraft,3dtlw1,VampyWorm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"Well, As far as blizzards reason to implement them, I think money. Money is a good reason.  The argument that Dustin Browder has mentioned a few times, about increased RAM requirements for having lots of skin models loaded is a complete non-issue from a practical stand point - I'm almost annoyed they've mentioned it a few times because it feels like a lame excuse to cover up their real feelings.  And i'm not being flippant about this either - Dustin admitted himself that extra skins are no problem whatsoever in 1v1 or 2v2, and only might be a problem in 3v3 and 4v4, and only on low-end computers with very little RAM.  So he is claiming that this big problem that has stopped them in their tracks is that a small percentage of users might have some problems only in 3v3 and 4v4 which represents a tiny, tiny fraction of games played.  The really sad thing, is that it has an absolutely trivial solution.  You have an option in the graphics menu, which is enabled by default, and says ""Display skins for other players in team games""  PROBLEM SOLVED DUSTIN"

Hopefully the design team are working on implementing this.
starcraft,3dtlw1,Pseudoboss11,2,Sun Jul 19 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"I would really love to have a separate mmr per race, but please do not make them completely separate. There should be a soft bound between the races and also the team games, so your mmr is not more than 2 leagues below you main race.  It would be awful to have diamond Zerg destroy bronze players, just to level up their Terran mmr. They can easily start in gold and should still be fine. Same goes for team games. If 2 diamond players form a team, they do not need to start in bronze."
starcraft,3dtlw1,NickCarefootYoutube,2,Sun Jul 19 13:05:19 2015 UTC,The hidden MMR increases very quickly if it's uncertain and you're winning your games.  What you're talking about wouldn't really be an issue for more than 3 games.

starcraft,3dtlw1,SKT_T1_NoTouch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"Would total MMR be calculated completely separately from other races' MMR? I mean, if you're great at T, you're probably not completely terrible at the other races, you'll have a grasp of the fundamentals at least.   So how should that be accounted for? Should we make it easier to gain MMR for off-races, maybe giving a small bonus that cuts off at some percentage of your highest MMR? Or should you just start at an MMR that's some function of your main race's MMR?"
starcraft,3dtlw1,Shizuri,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yes - there is no doubt that improving underlying mechanics and micro makes you better with all three races, so there is definitely some ""link"" between the MMRs of a player's 4 (including random) races.  However I don't think it's a problem really, because this is the kind of issue ""placement"" systems are designed to address - they alter your MMR more rapidly during placement games to get you close to where you should be quickly.  My personal opinion is that the placement system in SC2 isn't strong enough, and should probably require more games. Either just increasing the number of games, or making the requirement ""5 wins"" rather than ""5 games"" would go a long way.  So with a stronger placement system, you can get people's race-specific MMR to where it should be pretty quickly."
starcraft,3dtlw1,Existor371,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:54:08 2015 UTC,"What if someone uses all their placement matches, decides to main a specific race, and improves considerably?   And while I completely agree with increasing the number of placement matches would be useful, converting to 5 wins might be problematic. If someone wins all 5 games in a row, then they will have too low MMR. Maybe something like 3 wins and 2 losses might do the trick, though."
starcraft,3dtlw1,Shizuri,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Huh including a losses requirement is actually a really nice idea - I do think that would really help a lot.  Your first point is something that already happens anyway really - For example someone could play a load of unranked ladder, improve considerably then go back to playing ranked where their MMR is much lower.  I don't think this can be avoided really, however I also don't think it's much of a problem to be honest. If you are playing at a level which is significantly higher than your MMR and are therefore winning basically every game, it doesn't take long at all for the system to bump you up to where you should be."

starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,0,Mon Jul 20 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"Hi! Just to address your thoughts:   But I don't think that it would help to have 3x as many MMR points in the system.   Having more MMR values in the system doesn't have any negative consequences whatsoever. It is identical to just having three times the number of players.   This may inject too much bias in the MMR system.   Bias? Not sure what you're getting at. Having separate MMRs would in most cases actually make the matchmaking system more accurate, because at any given time you are more likely to be playing with an MMR that properly represents your skill."
starcraft,3dtlw1,DaveS1551,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"I just mean bias in terms of some players making a protoss account, and only playing it like 1 time per three months.

starcraft,3dtlw1,arch_punk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"I mean It doesn't affect the MMR system or MMR calculations, or matchmaking in any way.  What it would do is make it look like there are a lot more players than usual, and many of them would be very inactive - some playing only a few games as you say.  The only way 'bias' may come in is when blizzard are collecting statistics from the player pool as a whole - they may want to remove the very inactive players from the pool so they don't affect the stats.  However - removing them is extremely easy to do by having a cut-off of games played this season ect, and if it was a problem they'd already need to do this now. There are a  large amount of players with an MMR in the system who aren't laddering anymore"

You can practice with your offrace in unranked until you feel ready to jump back into ranked.  Also, I feel like tanking your rating when you offrace is just a thing that happens. Your ranking doesn't mean anything. If you care about it that much, you probably have horrible ladder anxiety and don't play much Starcraft anyway.

And if you don't have the exact same MMR rating for your offraces while going to ranked then your ranked MMR will get fucked. YOu won't get even games, your opponents won't and the whole system doesn't work well.  It's strange how people argue against something which has no drawbacks.

starcraft,3dtlw1,HasuGuru,0,Sun Jul 19 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"But unranked still takes your rank into account when finding a match. So if you're ranked Platinum and played unranked, it will try to find other Plats to pair you up with. For me I play my main race pretty much exclusively and last season I was top 8 Plat. Recently I wanted to try out the races but I lost every single game, even in unranked, since I never practiced with those races. It was frustrating and discouraging so now i just stick to my main race.  By splitting the MMR, it would 'unlock' 2/3rds of the game for me and probably lead to me playing more.

starcraft,3dtlw1,HasuGuru,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with the idea of separate MMR for each race, but your off race MMR should still e slightly effected by your main race  MMR. Let me explain. So you win a game as Protoss. So, your Protoss MMR increases by 10. And because you won, your Terran an Zerg MMR increases by 2. So it's separate MMR, but each race MMR is still slightly effected by each other.  The reason I think this is because you don't lose certain mechanics when you switch I a new race. Is a GM Protoss really at a beginner level of he decides to switch to Terran? No. He won't be as strong as a GM Terran, but he's also not at the skill level as someone who just started.  Also, how do you plan to implement this into ladder? If I wanted to raise my rank on ladder, wouldn't I just off race and play lesser skilled opponents? That seems like a really easy way to abuse the ladder system. The only way I think this could work is giving less points to games which both player have less MMR. But even then, at the higher levels doesn't every point count? Much more discussion needs to take place before separate MMR for each is implemented. I don't think it's as clear as some of you think it is."

starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"There should be a race MMR and an overall player MMR. When you do good with zerg, both your race MMR and player MMR go up.

Let's take your example - a diamond-level Zerg player who for whatever reason has a gold-level MMR for terran.  If the Diamond zerg can smash people in gold as a terran, do you know what happens? His terran MMR goes up and he stops playing gold players. It keeps going up until he is winning roughly 50% of games, as is the entire point of the MMR system."
starcraft,3dtlw1,Cpt_Tripps,0,Sun Jul 19 23:25:45 2015 UTC,"The point you're missing is that since that guy mains Zerg, he has no reason to care about his Terran ranking, so he can safely keep leaving games and tank his rating and continue bashing noobs. With one ranking, people will be less likely to do that, as it tanks their entire ranking.  If you think that people won't do this, you have far too much faith in humanity."

Even if we removed unranked so there was literally only 1 MMR per player on the ladder, people would STILL do this.  You can't stop people tanking their rating deliberately to bash on lower skill players. The percentage of people who do this is also very small I suspect, so it isn't much of a problem."

Of course you're gonna get your ass kicked the first couple times you play another race, but within a couple weeks I was at a comparable level with all 3 races beating evenly matched opponents.  You don't need a completely separate mmr (let alone 2 or 3 more) to play all three races. Many of the skills translate. There's already a way to play and practice your skills with no risk to your precious internet ranking and imaginary points, unranked ladder.

But it's even more bullshit, because it's basically a bunch of people who don't even play Starcraft complaining about ladder anxiety in fucking unranked. Are you kidding me?"
starcraft,3dtlw1,PtyPanzer,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:41 2015 UTC,I don't want separate MMR for each race. It would destabilize MMR to an almost meaningless level.  What we really need is some control over unranked ladder. If a player sees a build they like and they want to practice it on a map and vs a race of their choosing they should be able to. If they want to only play one matchup they should be able to.  Everyone having 2 MMR's fucks up the system enough we don't need 6 or 18 per player.
starcraft,3dtlw1,NiNKazi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:15:35 2015 UTC,It wouldn't. It's just like 3 times the player.
starcraft,3dtlw1,DaveS1551,0,Sun Jul 19 21:25:38 2015 UTC,Not in any way.
starcraft,3dtlw1,FalconX88,2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"It is exactly like that. Having a seperate MMR for each race is exactly the same as having 3 times the player but everyone is playing just one race.  In fact, having a single MMR for all 3 races is destabilizing the Matchmaking, because your ""skill"" will very quickly change drastically, which these systems have a hard time adapting to it."
starcraft,3dtlw1,fraffman,0,Sun Jul 19 21:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yup. Spot on.  As I said in another comment there are good reasons Aligulac uses 3 separate MMRs per player, and have 6 total to track every match-up. It does a much better job of representing skill accurately."
starcraft,3dtlw1,sidneyc,0,Sun Jul 19 22:28:07 2015 UTC,With respect I don't think you understand MMR properly - what do you mean specifically by de-stabilise?  If anything seperate MMR means that people are more likely at any given time to be playing with an MMR that more accurately reflects their skill level. This is a good thing.  I'm not sure what your rationale is for   having 2 MMR's fucks up the system   seems completely baseless
starcraft,3dtlw1,ArchOwl,3,Sun Jul 19 13:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand MMR.  MMR uses a mathmatic formula to determine a players skill. Players do weird shit that MMR and ELO doesn't account for such as smurfing, getting drunk, tanking their MMR to offrace, ect. Also because ""ladder anxiety"" Blizzard implemented some features such as MMR decay which makes sense if you are not playing every game but if you are playing every game and just happen to switch from your ranked to unranked account every 3 weeks this really fucks up your MMR.  I personally believe that having 2 separate MMR's makes smurfing more common. I can't really back that up with any facts or figures but I've done it, I've seen streamers do it, and I've played against it.  Anyway with 6 or 18 seperate MMR's per player would royaly fuck up the average that MMR tries to collect to determine a players skill level. Maybe it would work for the hardcore group that plays 4+ games every night but for many players it would become completely broken and arbitrary. (you would see many of the things you saw when HoTS beta was first released and more recently when all MMR's where reset. Such as GM players all being stuck at the top diamond MMR range.)"
starcraft,3dtlw1,NorthernSpectre,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"tanking their MMR to offrace, ect.    And this is one thing you could prevent with that.   I personally believe that having 2 separate MMR's makes smurfing more common.    So? Who cares if someone uses an alternate account to hide his identity? How does this has anything to do with MMR?"
starcraft,3dtlw1,kushmonger,2,Sun Jul 19 21:28:21 2015 UTC,I mean smurfing as in trolling bronze league not using a barcode.
starcraft,3dtlw1,whopido,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"MMR uses a mathmatic formula to determine a players skill.  Anyway with 6 or 18 seperate MMR's per player would royaly fuck up the average that MMR tries to collect to determine a players skill level.   I'm sorry but I actually think you really don't understand what is going on mathematically here at all. What you're describing isn't anything like what MMR is or is used for. You don't need to get defensive by the way about not knowing this stuff - there isn't any need for players to know. But when you brag ""yeah I understand MMR"" then say stuff like the above you look kinda silly. Anyway that is beside the point.     Basically your whole argument is that playing games with an MMR that does not accurately represent your true skill level is bad, and we should stop it at all costs dammit!  Well, great news! separate MMRs actually helps stop this happening. The current system means there a loads of ways players can play at MMRs which don't reflect their skill, and almost all of these are removed by having separate MMR's. It would take a lot of text to type out all the examples and explain them, and frankly I'm not sure you'd actually listen so I won't bother - So I'll only say this:     Your opinions are borne of ignorance in this case - if you want to understand why do some reading on matchmaking systems."

Starting in training and vs a.i is very good because it teaches you the basics. If you press esc in the main menu there is a ""help"" button where you can see the tech tree (what you need to build a builing or unit) and all units and builings with usefull information.  You can also do the first few missions of the campaing or go to the arcade and search for ""Starcraft master"" (this is a single player training map where the game will show you some advanced strategys you can do with units, this should give you a good idea).  For more information you can just check out this page: https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/wiki/new  if you have any more specific questions let me know."

I've seen more Colossus use in the past week than I saw the entire LotV beta prior. Not as often as HotS and it's not great against Zerg since Lurker is so popular but it's coming back into the meta against Terran and in mirror matchups."

starcraft,3e11c1,jasper2428,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"The alternative has always been to fix protoss warpgate, which buffs defenders advantage in vP matchups which would mean that protoss could have stronger gateway units, meaning they wouldnt have to lean so hard on these big expensive stupid units.

You run the risk of an opportunity for a long time, and the sword of the dead do not change, then I'm the problem.  The end of these things on a silver platter, and for the most part, to make, in general, has used an example of that, however.  An engagement is no doubt that a lot of mistakes: Ironically, he is talking, and they ran away ... when it's wrong, it was established phone service provider, the death of the body of crisis character and the best after amet Eget diam.

However, for people with big promises, among other things over the unusual position players  I can not.

Dota for instance gets 11m a month outside China (#s from March) and League is much more than that. But SC2 is still played by a lot of people.  Honestly whats more impressive is the viewer to player ratio. WCS gets far more viewers relative to players than almost every other game, which shows that the fan base is very dedicated to watching. If LoL converted the same ratio we'd be seeing 1M viewers every LCS weekend."

starcraft,3dy7mu,Theandieperson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"If I've understood the concept, you are trying to give an intro to sc2 that will lead people on to watching professional casts. I don't feel like your videos really do that.   I think it was too newbie in some ways, you should talk about how the units stack up against each other, the weaknesses of one composition compared to the other. Also, you could give some insight into the mindset of each player - how a player going double forge will be thinking for example.  It was also very much from your perspective, casting a replay that isn't one of yours would be better, since then you will be analysing the big picture.   Basically, you should try and say what is good about what each player is doing, and what is bad. Not only this, but why these things are good/bad too. Also, keep the sound effects to a minimum when engagements happen, keeping it professional will encourage new watchers to get into starcraft."
starcraft,3dy7mu,RewardedFool,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"The only reason I'm casting one of my own replays is because I can't find any others to cast. I have one that I casted, but since the update I'm unable to get into the other replays I downloaded. I don't want to get too technical with the game, cause I feel like information overload can turn a lot of people off to it. I'll try going a bit more in depth, I do appreciate your feedback and will use it to improve, I think if I can get this right it can be a very cool way to introduce people to Starcraft II."

I only had the starter edition for months and I played arcade and custom games only and met tonnes of people everyday, the were regulars who didn't have the full game either or had the full game but never played ladder and lots of new guys. The starter edition is actually quite popular, I always got custom games with other SE users."

It's got a ladder and feels like a legitimate mode to honestly try and get good at. I never could play 1v1 ladder for long periods of time, it was too stressful for me, but Archon is legitimately fun for me and brought the excitement back in SC2."
starcraft,3dumuy,stargunner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"See, lots of people played Brood War, and it had this feature that no one played; so we're hoping that if it gets added to SC2, lots of people will play SC2, even if they don't play Archon mode.  Seriously, though, it's because people really want SC2's ladder to be more popular and Archon mode is a somewhat gentler introduction to the ladder.

At your level, you don't need to micro your army, care about unit composition or builds.  Don't bother about strategy yet, you need some basic mechanics for that to pay off."

starcraft,3dyi7c,WengFu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:03:13 2015 UTC,"You really want to start your barracks as soon as you get your supply depot up. That way, you can start working on the buildings that the barracks is a predicate for and start your production faster. A couple of marines from an earlier barracks and you might have held that.  Also, you scouted but you didn't benefit from the scouting. Your opponent had nothing in his base but a supply depot, a gas and his starting command center. That immediately should tell you that there's at least one proxy barracks on the map somewhere, likely in/near your base.   Scouting is great, but you don't know what you are scouting for, and if you can't do it without interfering with more fundamental mechanics, you need to prioritize other stuff like spending your shekels ahead of it.  You also probably want to look into a learning a decent build order so you have an idea of what you need to build when and what your production goals for the build are. Also, turn on your in-game clock."
starcraft,3dyi7c,WengFu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, so would it have been better for me to then scout for the Barracks or just keep in mind that the enemy has a barracks in a position closer to my base?"
starcraft,3dyi7c,thefunkeejunkee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:02 2015 UTC,"It would have been better if you'd built your barracks as soon as your supply depot finished and started producing marines as soon as your barracks finished.  As for scouting the barracks - it is tough in lower leagues to know where to scout, people tend to put proxies in strange places, but having vision of your base is never a bad thing. Poke into the corners after two minutes, or build supply depots at places where a proxy/drop might happen that are outside of your vision. Also, learning to wall in is never a bad skill."

starcraft,3dx37o,Otaylig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"The story is overall pretty uninspired. The moral of both WoL and HotS is that Jim Raynor is a really cool guy and you should really like him. The stories of both have their good points, but HotS in particular resolves in a pretty unsatisfying way. You don't need to see WoL's to understand to follow the story in HotS, but it might add a bit of context.   That said, a lot of the WoL missions are really well designed and fun. Play it on at least Hard difficulty if you have any knowledge of game mechanics and actually want some challenge. Either version of the final mission of WoL on Brutal is no joke.   HotS, on the other hand, you must play on Brutal in order to find it even interesting. Kerrigan is ridiculously strong, and she is available in almost every mission. Also, for some reason they decided having any enemy unit in the game that cloaks would be bad."

With egg binding you have to go down to the bottom and bind every time you build new units, every 15 seconds or so, whereas with his method you just rally your units where they need to go and add them this way every minute or so.  Most korean zergs no longer use egg binding and instead make use of the select all army hotkey instead."

starcraft,3dwom8,Valonsc,3,Mon Jul 20 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"I will be honest. This has caused me more frustration and stress than anything. The first 3 years of the game i always kept hearing this, which means my game sense, tech'ing, attacking/defending, scouting, micro and multitasking went out the window.  The more i watch pros the more i watch them take advantage of every tech milestone, everytime. Be it lings, marines, zealots/MSC whatever.    If i were to speak to a fresh SC2 player, i would say learn to rush.  It will teach you so much about the game. Timings, macro, scouting, multitasking, micro. Defenders advantage is strong in this game, so being efficient and making the right choices is key.   I remember when i used to ""get ahead"" or in a position to do lots of damage i would have no clue what to do and would often throw the game.  It is only as you get better will you need to cut back and do more macro oriented rushes. Usually 3 Base stuff.    When i started, i was in Bronze with 60 workers at 9 minutes with 2k in the bank not knowing what to do or what was going on.  Speaking purely as a zerg, i would say focus on playing/understanding the game more. Worker production is a mindless metronomic(?) task that is easy to master.  This is just my personal experience, so it might not help players who have the same problems i did or even a Terran or Protoss players."

Here are the memorable lessons/tips and the people with whom I associate them:   Artosis (2010?): That you play defensive against someone who is aggressive; that you play aggressive against someone who is greedy; and that you play greedy against someone who is defensive. Apollo (2011? 2012?): Taught/showed me that my protoss units are not helpless, glass, paper weights; that a quick stalker at the start of the game to put pressure on the Terran can keep him honest and sometimes win games outright. Something something always wear a cannon.   Jaktak (2013?): There is great value to customizing and purposefully thinking about hotkeys; ever since I've started experimenting, I've expanded my comfortable hotkey max to seven (from five back in WoL?)   Axslav (2013?): A roach-hydra army will not scale well relative to most compositions; it is a temporary composition that will effectively become ineffective with the passage of time assuming your macro is comparable to your opponent. Grubby (2013?): An impromptu pylon wall can be an incredibly cost effective means of forcing an influential/decisive engagement into your favour against an opponent who decided to go for surprise ultralisks. This also applies to chargelot archon compositions.  Grubby (2013?): Never place buildings in such a way that they 'wall off' a corner of your nexus; you will have trapped probes."

Constantly be scouting or assuming information even off the smallest instances. Are those roaches fast, that means zerg has lair and could follow up with unexpected mutas, dropping a scan generally won't hurt you unless you're like GM.

T1 units being strong throughout the game would only be new to the Protoss.  And you don't need to straight buff the stats, that was an example. You could add an upgrade to the Dark Shrine/Templar Archives/Twilight Council that would give Zealots and/or Stalkers DPS increases, similar to Stim for Marine/Marauder or Adrenal Glands for Zerglings.

The viability of the nerfs relies on how you buff to compensate.  Note that if you buff gateway units too much, proxy gate allins become far too powerful. So without some concrete ideas of how to buff the units, I don't see how anyone would listen to this theorycrafting in a vacuum."
starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"Agree, and would add that with chronoboost toss is fundamentally timing orientated which benefits allins/specific timing builds more than macro focussed styles.  Without major nerfs to warpgates this will just make the variety of gateway allins stronger without helping the later.  I feel giving shield advantages / regen abilities that are stronger nearer friendly structures (Nexi?) might be the better approach.  Another approach I read somewhere was giving Protoss a 4th or even 5th upgrade. It goes really well with letting gateway units scale into the latergame without being OP early. 5/5/5 Zealots would be nasty, and with a shield boost unit would be really interesting. (E.g. protoss can use a shield 'overcharge' ability to give them ability to push through static D/armies that wont move, but would be forced to recall if it didnt do damage.)."
starcraft,3dutuk,cop_pls,0,Mon Jul 20 06:33:12 2015 UTC,"I just told you. Buff the damage of the gateway units, nerf WG and FF while fixing their inherent design problems in the course of it.  Are you asking for actual numbers? Because frankly, I'm not prepared to offer those, and neither was OP in his post. Numbers are something you tune after the changes are implemented and tried out, they're the last step in a design process - but unless these ideas get implemented in a PTR/modified version and we get to play around with how they impact Protoss as a whole at current numbers, there's no point in talking about changing the numbers.  Not to mention number changes might not be the best plan. Marine and Ling DPS isn't stellar early, but once they get major powerspikes in Stim/Adrenal Glands, they can really push through a lot of damage. Zealots lack any way to boost their DPS beyond simple attack upgrades - if these changes fix the power of a proxy pylon and it's ability to negate defender's advantage, upgrades could be added to any number of Protoss buildings (Dark Shrine has things to do hype?) to give Zealots a mid/late DPS boost."

starcraft,3dutuk,cop_pls,0,Mon Jul 20 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"What more is there to buff on gateway units? The entire problem with Protoss units has been gateway units fall off lategame because they don't do enough damage, which forces Protoss T3 to do very high DPS, especially splash. This in turn leads to a-move deathballs, which aren't exciting to play with, aren't fun to play against, and aren't interesting from a spectator perspective."
starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,0,Mon Jul 20 03:57:39 2015 UTC,So then how do you beat a maxed out deathball army if they now have +damage gateway units?
starcraft,3dutuk,TheSambassador,0,Mon Jul 20 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if gateway units can now play a role, Colossi and HT's don't have to carry as much weight. So you can reduce their damage or maybe redefine their role a bit, turn the Colossus into more of a sieging unit or give it an active ability. Suddenly TvP would no longer revolve around the T having to kill every Colossus to win the fight, and the P keeping the Colossi alive because they're the lynchpin of the entire composition. With Zealots and Stalkers having a greater role you can turn Colossi and HTs into more specialized anti-Light units, doing less damage base but +damage to Light units, turning Colossi specifically from ""build these to kill anything ground"" to ""specialized siege and anti-Light units designed to counter mass Marine/Ling/Bling/Hydra"". Suddenly Colossus isn't a must build in every matchup against every strategy that goes lategame, allowing Protoss greater variation in build paths."

starcraft,3dutuk,TheSambassador,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"Zealots already have pretty high DPS.  It's not quite as much as 2 marines or 4 zerglings, but they have increased health to sort of make up for it.  The problem is that they're pretty slow and can't really DO their actual DPS to marines, but their DPS is not really the problem there.  I'm pretty confident that an a-moved zealot beats 2 unmicroed marines.  Stalker DPS is pretty abysmal, but because they have blink later on, buffing their attack is tricky.    Sentry DPS is also terrible, but Forcefields...  I always hear people shout ""buff gateway units"" but it's really unclear on HOW to buff them.  People say ""oh just increase DPS"" but it really is not that simple.  I really would like to hear some suggestions on how to buff those gateway units in a realistic way."
starcraft,3dutuk,florideWeakensUrWill,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"With WG nerfed, Zealots could see any number of design changes to increase their damage dealt. Maybe Charge could apply a root or stun, so Zealots can actually get their AA's off against kiting Marines.  For Stalkers, all they need is a lategame damage boost. Blink Stalkers are already very good in the early-midgame. Tie a ""Stalkers receive +1 damage"" upgrade to Twilight Council and make it require a Dark Shrine and/or a Robo Bay. If it's not enough, make it +2 damage.  Sentry DPS is a nonissue - they could be unable to AA, like HT's, and it wouldn't make much difference except for a minor change to scouting in ZvP - though they'd need something to make up for weakening FF. Maybe give them the old Dark Archon's Mind Control, upgraded at or requiring Templar Archives, but give it a WC3 Banshee twist - the Sentry sacrifices itself in the process."
starcraft,3dutuk,SaturdayMorningSwarm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"Charging Zealots already are guaranteed to hit at least once.  In general, Chargelots are actually extremely strong, even against Roaches.  They only really struggle against large Terran bio balls.  I agree that a Stalker damage boost in late game might be OK, but is that really a needed solution when Protoss has so many other late game options?  Stalkers move from a primary army unit role to a supporting unit role, and honestly I think it might be fine.  Again, I feel the hate at Protoss gateway units is somewhat misguided and is sort of just parroted out all the time.  Protoss does have issues, but most of the issues with Forcefield come from not having counter-play options, which we now have.  Warpgate might be a little bit of an issue, but I don't think that it's as huge of a deal that people make it out to be."

starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I thought about that too. Maybe there are already enough indirect nerfs for the sentry, but i hope it will keep having a role in pvt and pvz no matter what role it is."
starcraft,3dutuk,SaturdayMorningSwarm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"The focus is not on forcefield. It is the fact that gateway units have to be weaker for forcefield to exist, for the sake of balance."
starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,9,Sun Jul 19 19:47:36 2015 UTC,"In what way are they weaker truly. They take less damage on shields compared to BW, offsetting their lower overall HP. Zealots attack faster. Stalkers start with 6 range. Stalkers do more damage to light units than dragoons did to small units. Stalkers can blink. They get hallucination much earlier and for free via sentries. Forcefield and warpgate make them stronger, yes. Removing them would require massive buffs in other areas, sure. But what you people seem to want is for protoss to have beefier and more boring units."
starcraft,3dutuk,CaptainEinsicht,4,Mon Jul 20 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like the 'gateway units are weak' myth is really driving most of the discussion here. Just look at PvZ lately, it's basically entirely gateway with some added immo and templar in the late game. You get a lot of mileage out of blink stalkers in all the matchups. The only thing that's truly weak to open is templar aside from some charge/archon allins.  Imagine this kind of discussion when blink allins were winning tournaments. Their solution would be to remove blink and make stalkers move faster."

starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,2,Mon Jul 20 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"I really did.  Played it pretty much constantly from 2006 until 2010.  Yeah.  Virtually everything changed.  Which is why people are often under the misapprehension that gateway units lost a lot of tankiness from BW: the shield mechanic worked differently back then, and meant all protoss shields took full damage (regardless of explosive and suchlike).  Responsibility for how pathetic gateway units feel ought to be leveled at the boring units which really screwed up the BW feeling: marauders and to a lesser extent roaches.  The races with more fragile units in that period of the game got given very tanky units, and in the case of marauders, massive damage vs. gateway units.  Somehow they escape scrutiny."

FF is very cool, but the recent mass sentry/stalker stuff isn't fun to watch or play, and those games always go the same way. Every time. Sometimes an exciting spell can lead to very boring games, while boring units can lead to exciting ones. Marines/marauder aren't very exciting, but the micro required to make it work is."
starcraft,3dutuk,dryj,3,Mon Jul 20 02:37:50 2015 UTC,you make it wrong by saying its abusing. I want a terran that doesn't abuse medivacs. Or abuse stim. Or abuse mines. Or a zerg that doesn't abuse viper or abuse burrow or abuse larva mechanics.   Sure you can argue  that me rushing out a prism and trying to FF you out of your main is me abusing FF just as much as a proxy factory is trying to abuse mines or a helbat timing vs zerg is trying to abuse those. But having sentries in my army isn't abusing FFs when they are the only chance I have to fend off low tier zerg units.   And what you find exciting isn't really a universal thing.
starcraft,3dutuk,Aunvilgod,0,Mon Jul 20 13:51:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of those comparisons just don't work. You can't abuse stim, you just use it once.

At least for viewers."

Force field is consistently an interesting and powerful spell. Warpgate units are, and have always been a staple of any protoss army. People have a major blind eye to the fact that the unit blamed for making gateway units weaker than BW is a gateway unit itself. People see all the amazing Korean games where gateway units are used to win games and think, what, that this is a problem? Is the fact that interesting spells are involved instead of larger health pools a major problem for you people?  It's a pretty big change from BW, I get that, but it's a fun one. Replacing warp gate and sentry shenanigans with stronger units walking across the map and casting no spells would be a big mistake. Why not focus on the elements where SC2 really can learn from BW, like the economy, the design of zerg and Terran."

starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I couldn't have been happier with putting a much smaller emphasis on infestors and adding vipers and hydralisks that can be used in timing attacks.  Made ZvP the most fun matchup ever.  Trying to nail that timing before they have enough colossi to do a bunch of damage, then having that army remain useful in the late game by the addition of vipers?  So much more like Broodwar, where your horde of weaker units was improved by the addition of ultralisks and defiles: not replaced by them.  Trouble with BL/infestor, swarm host/viper, and all those builds is that they don't feel very zergy.  Fun in their own right in a way: but not what I want when I pick zerg.  Aggressive and mobile armies are more fun I think."
starcraft,3dutuk,Ospak,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Because I want to give my opponent (Zerg) a chance to outplay me besides baiting of forcefields. Also, forcefields are useless against ultras or lurkers. Colossus from HotS is the only reason this design would work in LotV. The foundation isn't solid. Protoss should not be forced to turtle up to get  a deathball, or die trying to play differently. If these things aren't at least nerfed in favor of other strategies, Protoss will always be the race stuck with cute spells and flimsy units.   Protoss identity should not be forcefields mainly. Warpgate yes, gateway units warping in yes, spells yes, but not only spells. Not only all-ins, and not only T3 dependent splash armies in the mid-game for crying out loud."

The only thing warpgate is bringing is adept allins and that's either a meta issue or an issue with adepts themselves. Doing pure non-adept gateway allins does not seem to be viable. Not only are they weak, but with the econ changes you will start mining out if you take too long.  Really, all the issues you're having is solved in LotV already. I really doubt Blizzard is going to put arbitrary requirements on all these abilities that really serve no purpose other than to frustrate players. These changes are not new player friendly nor veteran friendly."
starcraft,3dutuk,Xikz,8,Mon Jul 20 13:29:16 2015 UTC,"Well thought out and written post, here is my feedback.  On the Pylons, what if instead of another energy bar for warp-ins it just used the pylons shield energy instead, using a number of energy per unit warped. When it runs out you can't warp in anything.  Now to augment the fact that the pylon might be attacked or depleted with warp-ins why not give the sentry a spell that uses energy to replenish shields (that could or could not be used on both buildings and units).  I always thought force field was a defensive spell so why not remove it from the sentry and give it to the mother ship core, or the nexus. With the new sentry energy spell your regular buildings now become force fields anyway, that is until you run out of energy or there is enough units to kill the building anyway.  Keep up the good work!"
starcraft,3dutuk,ithinkmynameismoose,12,Sun Jul 19 19:35:33 2015 UTC,I think the change to warpins would simply only bring frustration. Have to constantly assess where you can and can't warpin would just be irritating.   Production mechanics like larva inject I find cumbersome and strong without any real tradeoffs.
starcraft,3dutuk,bigmisch,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, it would make Protoss harder to play, in exchange for a straight up way to play that does not rely on specialized units to form the core of army forces."
starcraft,3dutuk,ithinkmynameismoose,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:21 2015 UTC,I don't thing making the game more mechanically demanding in that way adds anything of value.  Spectators can't appreciate the AMP/speed/accuracy it takes. It adds to the skill ceiling but not in a way thats exciting. I would rather them do away with warpgate entirely if this is what they were going to do. Another bad idea always tossed around is making the distance from the warpgate determine how long the unit takes to warpin.     His idea for sentries is also complete crackpot...
starcraft,3dutuk,etsharry,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say that ""spectator appreciation"" should not be a reason to limit design opportunities.  That being said, I had this idea where you have to activate a pylon to allow warpins. I like it because you can tweak it easily to what you need. e.g if you need to delay proxies, tweak activation time. Or if you want to punish using warpin pylons, give activation a cost. It doesn't need constant babysitting, you just decide where you want to warp in."

starcraft,3dutuk,Affenzahn375,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"Having forcefields require pylons is basically taking away any kind of interesting forcefield play. It's not really adding anything to the game.  It would be easier, and more interesting(I think), to just make forcefields targetable and hitting them just reduces their length(the more you hit it, the faster is goes away).   Giving pylons a warp cooldown is alright but chronoboosting them would be completely redundant since you're already using chronoboost on warpgates when you're trying to warp in a lot of units. It would just make more sense to just make the warp-in length directly related to the distance between the warp location and the closest nexus."
starcraft,3dutuk,etsharry,3,Mon Jul 20 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"I am a bot. Don't tell Blizzard, though; it's our secret.   Bold Design: Pylons, warpgate, & chronoboost  Fenix / Forum member    FOREWORD  This is all my opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree, but be constructive in both. This is intended mainly as feedback for the SC2 Multiplayer team to read.     In my opinion, chronoboost suffers from being the least explored of the three racial production mechanics in Starcraft 2 (orbital commands, larvae, and chrono). Reasons why that is are many. The real grievances people have about Protoss is the deathball, all-in, and gimmicky aspects that the race brings into gameplay, all to compensate for weak gateway units.  The core of Protoss gateway is weaker than the other two races because of burst production....you guys know the drill, we all know the problems.   Long story short, warpgate/forcefields are the reason why Protoss can't have core units and they need to depend on balled up T3 splash in the mid-late game (yada yada yada).  Dayvie has mentioned that he will speak on these topics and Protoss next week, but I wanted to provide my (hopefully) constructive opinion on what can actually be done for the race.  So, how can we settle it so Protoss can get core unit buffs for LotV so they can compete in the mid-game without relying on splash until the late game? How to reach both a strong core, and still keep mechanics such as forcefield or warpgate alive and a part of the Protoss identity?   Let us look at my suggestion for warpgate, and how I can tie it back to the title.   A moment to take about current Protoss matchups.  In the current LotV meta, there are adepts which are fairly strong for gateway units. Essentially, they enable Protoss all-ins now to become unnecessarily strong. They can wipe out an unsuspecting Zerg or Terran faster than before. The TvP matchup, however, is far more balanced than it is in ZvP. Meching terrans usually have a great potential against Protoss, and even bio supported by liberator/tank does well versus Protoss, with decent counterplay on both sides.  The imbalance is much more prominent in ZvP. For Protoss, there are two choices. All-in with adepts or die. Go mass air into splash into adept support, or die. If the Zerg spots the all-in and with the new economy, it is so much more easily defended.   So what is the issue really? After playing for a while and realizing that the ZvT matchup is still relatively fair (with the exception of mass cyclone being a bit too strong) for both sides, I realized two things with respect to ZvP, and what may apply to all three match-ups.  1. The new economy slightly favors early mass aggression by Zerg, specifically with zerglings but without putting them behind. This is actually fine. Reasons why in number 2.  2. The REAL root of the problem, is just like what Edowyth said, it is not that gateway units do not survive long enough (although if buffed they should live a bit longer). The problem is that gateway units just DO NOT KILL THINGS FAST ENOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO RACES. Especially Terran. Think of how well Terran can defend with less specialized units than the Protoss. By all means, I agree that late-game, Protoss needs splash to defend and that should be the case. However, to attack, they should not necessarily require splash to damage.   So Edowyth is right. We need more damage, but the race has to change for gateway units to be buffed to do more DPS. And with the core changed, all the other Protoss specialty units can receive increased depth (for instance, the tempest and void ray) and units like the colossus justified nerfs.   Before any increase to gateway unit strength can be made though, we need a solution. Here is mine.   The new warpgate, chronoboost, forcefield and pylon behavior.   Time to research warpgate is now slightly increased, but only slightly.  All pylons, ever in life, now have a set quanta of energy, different from any other energy in the game. It is a yellow bar under the blue shields bar. It is called warpfield energy. Yup, you heard it right. Every pylon has only a set amount of energy that can be used for units to warp in its power field, that slowly regenerates over time. A pylon can be INDIVIDUALLY chronoboosted so that it's energy can be replenished faster, but not extremely fast. Numbers can be tweaked.    This arbiter below already knows about the energy because it's so smart.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwMm6kq6vJE   So with these new pylons, how does this help warp..."

starcraft,3dutuk,etsharry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:44 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the easier and more obvious solution be to mark official post since they are much rarer?
starcraft,3dutuk,Kompicek,2,Mon Jul 20 12:44:52 2015 UTC,"On your points:  Chronoboost on pylons sound actually cool also the energy per pylon model, even though i do not think they want to add another bar to the game (i know it is only for the pylon).   I do not like the solution for the sentry because it will be even more hit or miss. If the opponent for example kills your pylon in the natural you will have no more forcefield and just straight up lose the game. Also i actually like offensive forcefields sometime, but i do not like the amount of forcefields available from one single sentry because it feels sometimes just too much. My suggestion for forcefields is below.  Another missing point in your suggestion imo is that there is still no incentive to go for closed warpgates because you can still always warp in at home, i would rather buff the closed warpgate and nerf the opened as i explain in my suggestions.  My suggestions would be a bit simpler:   Reduce the production speed from open warpgates massively and raise it for closed warpgates Buff the Stalker slightly. Maybe higher fire rate. Either remove legspeed ability and instead give back the old simple speed upgrade or redesign legspeed to be only casted manually on ground for the sake of faster and more agile zealots, even if they are out of combat (through casting speed on ground all over the time while movecommanding) and for the sake of way more micropotential in engagements. Every sentry can only channel one Forcefield at a time for 25 energy + x amount of energy/second. as soon as the sentry is killed the forcefield is gone -> way more micro potential for the opponent (focusing sentry) and straight nerf of the forcefield (no more mass forcefields). That way it is also not always beneficial to let some units in before casting your force fields because they could just kill the sentries and then the forcefield dissappears. Buff also the sentry; maybe more hitpoints/more dps.   PS 6. remove photon overcharge :)"
starcraft,3dutuk,somerandomtoss,4,Sun Jul 19 19:38:28 2015 UTC,remove photon overcharge    And Protoss defends multiple bases... how? Especially with the economy change.
starcraft,3dutuk,Aunvilgod,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:43 2015 UTC,"As already said,  buffing warpgate units,  redesigning legspeed and I think a good balanced disruptor could do wonders for that. Skill based defending,  that is what I would be looking for not pressing a defence button.   Fast zealots, disruptors adepts and buffed sentries and stalker could be enough in my opinion. Think about stronger stalkers with blink plus disruptor. This would be totally imbalanced with the warpgate as it is, but with a sufficient nerf to warpgate blink stalkers plus disruptors could be very strong in defense. Obviously it is all about the numbers again but the mechanics would be there imo.   And if i am wrong there has to be something else, photon overcharge is the ugliest and most aweful to play against mechanic in the whole game. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF IT. Think of a new player who just came into the game and wants to attack and suddenly the nexus shoots at him from huge range and for an even longer time. THat is just silly! there is nothing the noob can do other then wait till it is over. It is so boring and unfun it is unbelievable. There has to be a other solution than that. I believe alone this mechanic can actually scare a lot of people away from our game, i think it even already did scare people away."

starcraft,3dutuk,sifnt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"They're not going to rebuild protoss at this late date. LoTV is in pre-order already. If they rebuild (fundamentally transform) protoss now, they have to rebuild the entire campaign. It's not going to happen."
starcraft,3dutuk,Coduufightinguu365,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure, it's not like terran from WoL campaign and WoL multi are the same."
starcraft,3dutuk,Mimical,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:20 2015 UTC,"This is what I've been saying since the wings of liberty beta. Warp gates and force fields was a huge mistake. Protoss should have been left more like they were in BW where a large force of Dragoons and Zealots was something that was to worry about, especially together with some support units. But I guess there is no turning back now..."
starcraft,3dutuk,PoweRForgeD,0,Sun Jul 19 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, I still prefer my idea from way back.  Change main function of gateway to regular production like barracks.  Once you have warp gate, you can warp in at any pylon per usual, but the warp cycles are energy-based, the regen cycles are extremely long, and constant production requires you continue to make units manually through rally points instead of warping in.  Chronoboost can be used to accelerate the energy rebuild, but would be balanced around not letting it get abused.  Not to mention your nexus would run out of energy anyhow, preventing you from spamming chronoboost on production until the extreme late game."
starcraft,3dutuk,diagoth,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:03 2015 UTC,"I like that, It just a real mechanic responsibility on the brotoss like Zerg and 'somewhat' Terran have,"
starcraft,3dutuk,CustardBoy,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"This is cool. I love it. Makes warp gate weaker as an offensive, FF's are now defensive only, but can be used strategically in an offensive position. Actually, maybe require the sentry to use some of the pylon energy when casting a FF? That way in a forward position, you have to make the decision of either warping in units or using a FF. Adds more strategic decision making. But your changes are really good and very minor tweaks that don't mess with overall game too much and maintain the Protoss racial identity."
starcraft,3dutuk,Aunvilgod,0,Sun Jul 19 19:16:40 2015 UTC,"Fair points... I'd suggest an alternative balance of nerfs/buffs that is also lore friendly:   Protoss can upgrade up to 5 (5/5/5 zealots would be nasty), doesnt affect early allins but helps gateway units scale in the late game. Nerf the offensive potential of warpgate, either in build time or in units warping in without shields(!). Protoss units regen shields faster (even in combat?) while near friendly buildings (but not the forward pylon... maybe nexus). (Maybe...) A shield overcharge ability or unit that would give a toss army larger staying power; the ability would increase shields significantly but also decrease attack damage. The idea is to allow protoss to force fights into a turtling army (terran mech / mass lurker etc) and forcing them to reposition."
starcraft,3dutuk,ithinkmynameismoose,0,Mon Jul 20 06:44:24 2015 UTC,Cant believe zerg cant use transfuse energy to speed upgrades or whatever else. Fuck protoss.
starcraft,3dutuk,somerandomtoss,0,Mon Jul 20 08:31:35 2015 UTC,"I know this probably sound silly, however would it not be nice to have an overall buff to closed warp gates? The open warp gate allows players to instantly create gateway units far away from the production buildings.   While a player choosing to keep warpgates closed could have a small boost in either economy or stats, So from a closed warp gate you could slightly reduce the cost of units (say a zealot from 100 minerals to 85?) and a slightly reduced time (Right now the build time is 38 seconds, and 28 using warp gates) Lets change the zealot to 30 seconds from a closed gateway. OR if you have a closed warpgate the units spawn with 120% shield, and it slowly ticks down to 100% over 45 seconds or so.   Then toss players are now given a option, To build units that they can instantly transport across the map, or have a closed gateway that provides a slightly less costly army by having to route them around.   While this does not change the end game to much, it provides a path that players could take to help reach larger economies faster (IE instead of 4 warp gates they could do 4 gateways and with the extra savings over a few minutes early game allows more resources for mid game upgrades and tech buildings)   This problem is not clear cut. It is incredibly hard to balance around.  So in reality all suggestions in the entire thread will need to be tested or criticized. Any talk is good talk"
starcraft,3dutuk,ithinkmynameismoose,0,Mon Jul 20 13:43:51 2015 UTC,"No more warpgates, units are built from gateway (with decreased time of course). Protoss has the ability to warp (like recall) to any pylon on map using nexus energy. The larger the amount of units, the longer it takes to warp them to said location."
starcraft,3dutuk,somerandomtoss,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:43 2015 UTC,thats extreme with no warpgates because it makes protoss more generic  and not as intresting and as diversely different than the other classes
starcraft,3dutuk,ithinkmynameismoose,0,Mon Jul 20 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"HotS is in such a good, balanced state right now. Maybe there are a few tweaks here or there, but the games at the top level are exciting, fast-paced, and fun to watch. Moving to LotV... things get even faster. And we haven't even seen how fast the pros are going to make it.   Your suggestions only serve to slow things down. They serve to add arbitrary limitations to players, disproportionally affecting protoss, who in my opinion don't have any issues that stem from sentries or warp gate. The only thing that's particularly strong right now is Adept and maybe Carrier, and I'm not sure if that's a meta issue or they're legitimately too strong.  I'm against suggestions that make the game boring. Yes, every unit shouldn't have 3 activated abilities, but we shouldn't have more units that are basically roaches without burrow move."
starcraft,3dutuk,somerandomtoss,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:59 2015 UTC,I don't think this is the most elegant solution but any nerf to Warpgate is a good thing.
starcraft,3dutuk,Anthony356,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:21:36 2015 UTC,The big thing I don't like is making the units stronger. I think the fix is in the economy not unit strength Protoss units are already the strongest so just buffing them would have too great an impact on the mid and especially late game. For example blink Stalkers are already hugely powerful and I shudder to think what they could do when buffed. Hell same really goes for all gateway units when you think about it (except maybe sentry...)
starcraft,3dutuk,Aunvilgod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:57:33 2015 UTC,They can buffed in very specific areas that won't break the game. It's all numbers.
starcraft,3dutuk,Anthony356,0,Mon Jul 20 00:31:48 2015 UTC,really toss units are the strongest? what a fuck are you playing???
starcraft,3dutuk,Aunvilgod,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:53:51 2015 UTC,That's the whole premise of protoss. They are stronger units that are slower to make and more expensive. Moron.
starcraft,3dutuk,Friendly_Fire,0,Mon Jul 20 08:35:46 2015 UTC,rofl lets take 2 marines vs Zealot? or a zealot vs 4 lings who would win? same with stalker and any gateway unit. You such a moron if you think toss units are stronger then their counterparts. They are more expensive and weaker! only way they can stand up to something is using ff. Learn facts before you speak!

starcraft,3dutuk,ameya2693,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"Sentries can now only cast forcefields when they are in a pylon's powerfield... And now, with these changes, and probably some other minor balance/design tweaks. Protoss now instantly has more macro depth, and are eligible for some core gateway unit buffs.   Okay, I'm not saying you couldn't make it work, but let's analyze this. You nerf forcefields and warpgate to make offense weaker, leave their defensive capabilities the same roughly, and then buff gateway units.  Protoss defense would be unbreakable. (for zerg)  Protoss defense is all ready really good, but these theoretical changes would make it even better. The only option of zerg would either be super cheese or just to massively out macro against an unbreakable turtle.  If you want stronger gateway units, the defensive power of forcefields would need to be reduced greatly. Maybe ravagers and quick drops help, but in HotS these changes would make the matchup terrible."

So you choose your own set of allied and enemy team colors for all ladder games.  The downside of this is that you won't globally show the color you like, but I think that would be too messy to begin with anyway. Too many similar colors.  Unless you could make something like the Super Smash Bros 4 team color-thing work in Starcraft! You globally show your color on your units and buildings, but they have a constant outline that cannot be customised.

Then for my away outfit I have to pick from a different set of complementary colors. Maybe I choose Light Yellow for the main color and White for the accents. Accents would be things like the badge/stamp your units wear ut could be expanded however Blizzard wanted (pin strip on uniform? strip down length of voidray?)  When the game starts it chooses who is ""home"" and ""away"" just as it chooses ""red"" vs ""blue"" now. Since you chose your jersey colors from the appropriate palettes, you will automatically contrast and be visible in the game.   Another bonus for this is the e-sports clubs could set up their teams to use their team colors as well. Acer using green/white. KT using red/black. Further, if Blizzard wanted they could actually sell the logos of these teams so you could wear them on your units to support your favorite team! The OP here could buy the red/black home outfit for KT Rolster and support them in-game instead of just as a flair on reddit. Bonus!"

starcraft,3dttrx,decytv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Be able to set your color and your opponents color, only affects your screen unless opponent doesn't want to override what color you picked."
starcraft,3dttrx,ArtOfZerg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:33 2015 UTC,Like can they make it so you can set your color and your opponents. But only you can see it and vice versa? I think that would be awesome!
starcraft,3dttrx,leeroyschicken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"Chose whatever you want as long all I see is blue vs red.  I don't want to deal with bullshit like red vs green, blue vs purple or red vs orange."
starcraft,3dttrx,iodsahsdioaj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:51 2015 UTC,I wish you could just change the team color so it isn't always green. That way it prevents abuse and gives flexibility. Suggested it back in WoL the response was it would confuse the crap out of noobs
starcraft,3dttrx,StanishInquisition,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"Also, stop making people on the same team in team games orange and yellow, they look too damn much alike"
starcraft,3dttrx,StarseedSC2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:10 2015 UTC,It's not hard to get around all you need to do is have a choose your color option and have a back up color if your opponent has picked the same color. You could also just do it first come first serve at the loading screen but I would assume that it would be hard to make a new loading screen etc. (the technology just isn't there)  And if you don't like this option you can always choose the Green and Red option that is already there if you get confused by different colors.
starcraft,3dttrx,ZizLah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:10:42 2015 UTC,I would pay to be purple or yellow for terran.
starcraft,3dttrx,The_Flair,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:36 2015 UTC,This is a lot better than them stupid Zergling skins.
starcraft,3dttrx,Erolon,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:51 2015 UTC,What's stupid about the Zergling skin?
starcraft,3dttrx,Cerdoken,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:14 2015 UTC,The skin makes it look like your opponent has more lings then they really have. I still like that they gave us some skins.
starcraft,3dttrx,lxFigHteRxl,-5,Sun Jul 19 15:46:49 2015 UTC,Why don't we allow players to pick the eye color of their units too? Because this is an important thing.
starcraft,3dttrx,conway1308,-2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:42 2015 UTC,Anyone else keep playing matchups with red and red? Super aggravating.
starcraft,3dttrx,Malachiasz,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Blizzard should think of ways for Starcraft to go Free2Play. Perhaps you could buy full version and then get all cosmetics, choose unit color and so on but you could play free 2 play (on ladder) and you would have only access to basic skins and colors. You could unlock them individually via hard cash."
starcraft,3dttrx,Erolon,0,Sun Jul 19 13:42:55 2015 UTC,Would be better if they could unlocked by playing the game too. Like unlock a color if you win 500 games with a race. Or just boring points.

starcraft,3dzs2k,trancenotech,6,Mon Jul 20 21:18:47 2015 UTC,Richard lewis is a journalist. Why would he get invited to the summit? He's not a pro nor is he really game involved for sc2. He does occasional hosting for sc2 but that is it.
starcraft,3dzs2k,Valonsc,3,Mon Jul 20 21:20:39 2015 UTC,He is a multi game journalist/presenter. He presented Dreamhack's CSGO last weekend.
starcraft,3dzs2k,Ireniicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"He's dropping some pretty good articles at the daily dot. He says for the next six months his gloves are off, that he's sick of the bullshit in eSports and he's going to put all of it out in the open on his way out of the industry"
starcraft,3dzs2k,ProxyHatchGG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:09 2015 UTC,dreamhack tours was the last event he hosted for sc2 ( earlier this year)  aside from that try asking him on twitter https://twitter.com/rlewisreports
starcraft,3dzs2k,angelOFnoise,0,Mon Jul 20 21:22:46 2015 UTC,"Richard is doing a lot of hosting, journalism, and writing.  Most of the writing is about himself."

You ring her before you see her in class, casually asking her if she wants to meet you somewhere (go for a coffee, cinema, a walk in the country, whatever). 2. You spend the day with her, absolutely focusing on enjoying yourself, not hooking up with her. 3. You meet her in class and +chemistry."
