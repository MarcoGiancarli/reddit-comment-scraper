Big difference. At 19 Anderson was legally a man, not a boy. He didn't bother to ask the girl her age before they had sex. The judge gave him 90 days out of a possible 2 years. That's 1/8 of the max sentence. It was longer than some judges would have given, but legally it was not obviously disproportionate. It probably won't be reversed on appeal.  This judge was originally appointed by Governor Engler.

There is NO way to protect yourself against statutory rape (as a male) because the use of a fake ID still won't protect anyone from getting charged. Prison, jail, doesn't matter. He has a record. People who have been in the justice system for whatever reason are indiscriminately punished by society. Jobs, relationships, etc. are all hard to come by.  At 19 legally a man? Purely semantic. He's still prohibited from drinking. You can hardly call anyone under 21 an adult.  3 months vs 2 years. Ok. 1/8th of the maximum sentence doesn't excuse the fact that a totally innocent person is being punished for something that was entirely out of his control.  As part of his probation he's not allowed to use a computer or smartphone for five years. He was studying computer science. He will never be able to work in that field, especially since he's: On the sex offender registry for 25 years. He's going to be discriminated against for this one act of consensual sex for more time than he's spent on the earth so far. He's not even halfway to the age he'll be when this finally goes away.

Michigan,3e19sd,obsa,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"TIL 19 years old is ""a grown man"". When's the last time you had an interaction with a 19 year old which supports that assertion?

Michigan,3e19sd,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:39 2015 UTC,Apparently. When do you think a person stops being a child? Because I'd say it's somewhere around the time  they can fight in a war or vote. Are you saying that the legal age of adulthood is too low?
Michigan,3e19sd,obsa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:39:35 2015 UTC,"Your personal opinion of when adulthood starts is based on a law a governing body passed? That seems weird and cyclic to me, especially in this context.  I'm saying that adulthood is not binary and it's a joke to pretend that the phrase ""a grown man"" applies equally to a 19 year old, a 29 year old, a 39 year old... it doesn't. If you want to make a point about something something ""a legal adult"", that's a different story.  I'm not trying to play a semantic game. Words mean things."
Michigan,3e19sd,_stonecoldsaidso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"I think that you're trying to argue that a 19 year old person is not a grown person. I completely disagree. When does it end? Is a 25 year old a grown person? Is the line at 30? Or is it related to when you move out of your parents house (which is usually before 19)? Honestly, I'm tired of people treating adults as children.   I would argue that you reasoning is cyclic. If you treat someone like a child their entire life, they'll act like a child their entire life. I know 16 year olds that moved out and became responsible adults, and I know 26 year olds that still live with their parents. The only difference is how their parents and peers treated them growing up.  My personal opinion is that the age of adulthood is too high, to be honest. If your kids aren't mature and intelligent enough to be a respectable and responsible citizen at 17 years old, you fucked up somewhere along the way. Way too much coddling nowadays, 25 seems to be the new 18.  Would you really call a 19 year old person a 'boy'? Personally I would have been offended if you called me a 'boy' when I was 19, and I think most of my peers would have been as well."
Michigan,3e19sd,1-Down,0,Tue Jul 21 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"I seriously have to describe why 18+ is a grown man?  He had sex with a girl who is likely in 8th grade.  However you want to describe his decision making ability, hers is far more diminished.  He didn't do due diligence, fucked up, and now is getting bit for it.  I'll admit, I'm older.  I never participated in ""hookup culture"".  Thing is, it's ALWAYS been risky to sleep with somebody you don't know very well.  Maybe they're diseased.  Maybe they have a SO/Spouse.  Maybe they're crazy.  Maybe their SO/Spouse is crazy.  Maybe they're FOURTEEN.  Cripes, Animal House and Trainspotting both had jokes about this.

Michigan,3e19sd,1-Down,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"Little bit of both I reckon.  Is it ok for a 19 year old to sleep with a 14 year old under certain circumstances and, if it's not ok, what the consequence should be.    3 months in jail with 5 years probation isn't exactly getting the book thrown at you.  Would 30 days in jail have been better?  Community service?  Not sure - don't know much about this guy's situation (does he have family, an education, a job, mental illness, a history or doing stupid shit, etc).  The real kick in the balls though is the long-term problems.  Being on the sex-offender list and having a conviction is going to screw up his job prospects pretty much for life.  That's a bit harsh in my opinion, but again, I don't know the particulars."

I know people twice that age who still lack that facility. Why do we pretend otherwise? Yeah, there has to be a line, but I scoff at using the phrase ""a grown man"" because it imbues implicit age/wisdom/maturity that is absolutely not there at age 19.   Do I want 19 year old men having sex with 14 year old girls? Not even a little.   I mean, I'm not encouraging it either, but is this law very clearly broken? Yes.  Should he have been more thorough? Maybe. I would have been.  Should he basically have his life ruined for consensual sex? Not hardly.  Unfortunately, your exact reaction and framing of the situation (lewd underage sex rather than a massive social injustice caused by dishonesty) is probably why this kid is totally fucked, even on appeal. It'll take another decade, at least, until the older generation starts getting usurped out of authority positions for the courts to start catching up with the culture."
Michigan,3e19sd,1-Down,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it wasn't consensual sex.  She is incapable of giving consent in our state.

Like if the guy had a Chevy and the repair was less than $50, you wouldn't care?  Second, the guy was driving on a state-provided, state-maintained road. The state obviously fails to maintain road quality (all over the gd state) and it caused damage to his vehicle. Even though as taxpayers we all fund infrastructure, if the state fails to hold up its end of the bargain on maintenance and it causes damage like this, should he be expected to foot the entire bill for damage caused by the state's negligence? If that's the case, then someone should explain to us why our tax dollars result in road quality so bad it causes damage like that.   This guy didn't go off the road into a ditch, he was driving down one of our state's fine roadways.
