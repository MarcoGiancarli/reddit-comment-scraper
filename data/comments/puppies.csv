My Annabel will be 6 months on Friday :)  Imgur  She normally looks happier than this, just doesn't like the flash on the camera but she just came home from getting groomed and I wanted to capture her sparkly white fur!"

puppies,3dyxsp,Crigger540,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:45 2015 UTC,Very cute!
puppies,3dyxsp,ThePlaidOrchid,2,Tue Jul 21 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"Ugh why do all of the most ADORABLE dogs have to be pitt mixes?!?  Fuck you, HOA. I own my own home and still can't have the dog I want most."
puppies,3dyxsp,ThePlaidOrchid,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:38 2015 UTC,She's an Australian Shepherd mix (that happens to have some pit in her...) incase my homeowner's insurance asks.
puppies,3dyxsp,ThePlaidOrchid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'm so afraid to get anything with pit, in case god forbid something happens and insurance dna tests. I know I'd raise them to be highly unlikely to have an incident, because pits are the best dogs...  I'm just so afraid to chance it.  Maybe I'm just too paranoid."
puppies,3dzjtl,mk0280,5,Mon Jul 20 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"My six month old husky lab, Darcy. She hasn't quite grown into her ears yet!"

puppies,3dut9d,Knort27,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:04 2015 UTC,Uh oh..the face of a troublemaker ;)
puppies,3dut9d,Angramis546,2,Sun Jul 19 23:13:30 2015 UTC,That smile on his face makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. The face is priceless. It looks like he has a lovely brown/blue eye color like the germies and the huskies. Congratulations

I don't know what she'll do when she's way too big for my lap. She's currently asleep, laying on as much of me as she can (:"
puppies,3di93n,idothenumbers,5,Thu Jul 16 14:14:06 2015 UTC,My pup does this too. But she now sits in the living room (attached to our kitchen) and stares at me until I release her to go eat.
puppies,3di93n,sheenab12,3,Thu Jul 16 17:17:48 2015 UTC,What breed?
puppies,3di93n,Duke15,3,Thu Jul 16 17:21:52 2015 UTC,What a cute dog. I want to just smush his widdle face and kiss his nose.
