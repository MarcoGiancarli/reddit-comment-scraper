maru,3e0mzw,Majoof,4,Tue Jul 21 06:23:45 2015 UTC,I love Maru so much. He always brightens my day when I see him!

maru,3e0mzw,Henge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:03 2015 UTC,I thought he had raw beef on his head from the thumbnail. Maru is so amazing

maru,3dopph,Mr_Popper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:54:49 2015 UTC,Maru is the perfect weird cat that you want. You can't train a cat to do stuff like this. I love him.
maru,3dopph,nbreg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"I love maru, but his eye there at the end got kinda creepy looking as his face pudge gathered and pushed his eye out a little."
maru,3djagt,MathildaIsTheBest,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"Excuse the naive question, but is mugumogu a ""her""? I've watched (I think) all of the videos and I've never seen an identifiable person, only a hand that could be either gender. Is it in a wiki somewhere or something?"
maru,3djagt,principledsociopath,2,Fri Jul 17 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"It has been mentioned in various articles, but I think you can sometimes tell from the bits you can see in videos.  Here is a video showing a bit more of her than usual, but it's still not obvious."
maru,3djagt,LMAbacus,3,Fri Jul 17 00:57:53 2015 UTC,"There's also this, where you can hear a feminine giggle. As far as I can remember, that and the recent hammock video are the only times we hear any human sounds at all."
maru,3ddock,MathildaIsTheBest,3,Wed Jul 15 13:33:47 2015 UTC,Is that Maru?  He looks lighter/slimmer than usual.
maru,3ddock,pizzamarie,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:43 2015 UTC,It looks like she's using the Fisheye Converter on the picture.

maru,3ddock,nbreg,2,Wed Jul 15 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"I love how Maru and Hana are so different. Hana always looks at the object in front of her, but Maru smells more."
maru,3d98f7,MathildaIsTheBest,8,Tue Jul 14 14:19:49 2015 UTC,Nonsense.  Maru loves Hana and shares space with her all the time.  They clean each other and snuggle.  He has that look on his face all the time.
maru,3d98f7,Macfrogg,2,Tue Jul 14 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, Maru adores that cat."
maru,3d98f7,darksugarrose,2,Wed Jul 15 00:13:02 2015 UTC,"The one thing we know about Maru is that he bores easily, but young Hana is always up for a playfight.  She seems to have limitless energy, so I think they're a perfect fit."
maru,3d98f7,Macfrogg,2,Fri Jul 17 04:59:09 2015 UTC,Maru seems to have resting bitch face!
maru,3cypd4,twinnedcalcite,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:00:35 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what that cat tower is? I'd love to buy it if I could find it!
maru,3cypd4,realsocialworker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:18:23 2015 UTC,"Not a clue, others have tried locating it but nothing found yet."
maru,3cpgr1,MathildaIsTheBest,9,Thu Jul 9 18:50:59 2015 UTC,So he IS neutered!  Question to Japanese speakers. Does Maru's owner write like a cat lady? Do cat lady traits transcend borders? What kind of voice does her blog read like?
maru,3cpgr1,nbreg,11,Thu Jul 9 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure how cat ladies write, and I certainly have no idea if stereotypical Japanese cat ladies write the same way as stereotypical Westen cat ladies, but I would say she doesn't. She has two versions of her ""I am Maru"" blog. The original version, which is where this post is from, is entirely in Maru's voice, and features a lot of complaining by Maru about his housemate, which is the reason for the ""She occasionally says some nice things."" For instance, the post immediately before this one says:     Geez, my housemate is so annoying.  Getting into garbage cans is one of my hobbies.  How many times do I need to tell her?  And yet every time she shouts ""HEY!"" at me.  Her memory is hopeless.     Her new blog is in her own voice in dialogue with Maru and recently Hana. For the most part, the English translation matches up very well with the original Japanese. She will occasionally not translate certain parts that paint Maru in a bad light (such as his being fearful of the dove he had been stalking, or that he can be rough with his claws when playing). Her daily postings are pretty brief and mostly feature one or two exchanges with the cats, or exchanges between the cats themselves."
maru,3cpgr1,LMAbacus,4,Thu Jul 9 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"Google translation:  I graduated from the male.  Not the loss was comb.  Last, and he was graduated.  And it became the existence that transcends gender.  As I was depressed, housemate has told me so.  Also it says that occasionally good."
maru,3cpgr1,LMAbacus,24,Thu Jul 9 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"A better translation would be something like:     You've moved on from masculinity.  It's not that you lost it.  No, you definitely moved on from it.  Your existence transcends gender now.  That's what my housemate tells me when I get depressed.  She occasionally says some nice things."
maru,3cpgr1,Megmca,4,Thu Jul 9 20:41:47 2015 UTC,The neuter poem.
maru,3cpgr1,kabukistar,5,Thu Jul 9 23:48:37 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Thank you for the translation!
maru,3c844o,___atomlib___,22,Sun Jul 5 20:05:06 2015 UTC,A lot of indoor cats develop a dangling paunch for no reason.
maru,3c844o,FaceofHoe,18,Sun Jul 5 22:40:37 2015 UTC,Particularly fixed female ones.
maru,3c844o,Datawych,3,Sun Jul 5 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"This happened to my kitty, and she was the same breed (looks wise) as Hana is."
maru,3c844o,PoesRaven,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"Both of our female cats, who are fixed, have that paunch too."
maru,3c844o,Renette12,35,Tue Jul 7 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"It's possible. Maru does appear to have his fuzzy nuts intact, so it's reasonable to assume that Hana didn't get fixed either.   I won't lie, it kinda upsets me to think that Maru might be a father, I mean, his kittens would be the cutest things ever to exist, but the idea of that goofy animal having a sex drive is sorta like thinking about my parents having sex.  ಠ_ಠ"

maru,3c844o,LMAbacus,15,Fri Jul 10 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. They appear to be house cats. And Maru's owner seems to be a very responsible cat lady.   Also, Hana has been chubby for a lot longer than a cat's gestation period, which is 66 days."
maru,3c844o,horse__tornado,9,Sun Jul 5 22:31:28 2015 UTC,"Wow I just rewatched a recent video and she does have quite a belly. Maybe? Maru has always been pretty chubby so it is possible Hana is just gaining fat. It is pretty big though, so it's possible she is pregnant"
maru,3c844o,Megmca,25,Sun Jul 5 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"Maru isn't chubby. This is what he looks like after a bath, and this is the kind of gap he can squeeze between; it's just his fur making him look fat. It's probably the same with Hana, as her belly fur was long even as a kitten."
maru,3c844o,MathildaIsTheBest,5,Sun Jul 5 23:04:19 2015 UTC,I stand corrected then. Poor Maru all wet after the bath!

They are both behaving badly.  Maru should find his own place to sleep and Hana should ignore him.  However, they are both cats."

maru,2y80a1,MeNowDealWithIt,1 point,Sat Mar 7 12:39:10 2015 UTC,I disagree.  This is a perfect example of how Maru's tail is a separate entity.  Wholly independent and sentient on its own.   LOL

maru,2y80a1,Razili,1 point,Sun Mar 8 02:59:16 2015 UTC,I love other Maru videos. It's adorable to see Maru try to get into a box. It's not as adorable to see Maru shake the end of the tail back and forth.

You can tell they aren't really fighting because they never hiss or growl, and they never actually hurt each other.    Watch the end of this video to see how much Maru loves Hana.  He is letting her sit in the box."
maru,2koxi7,Datawych,2,Wed Oct 29 19:56:15 2014 UTC,"I think Maru loves Hana.   I'd believe it. The best way to introduce another cat into a house is to bring home a kitten. The older cat always seems to develop a sort of big brother/big sister attitude toward the younger one. Two adult cats who are unfamiliar never seem to become able to get along, but an older cat getting used to a kitten usually seems to work.  Especially because of the end of the video you posted. One of the number one way cats express affection is by grooming each other. It's the main reason cats love it so much when you brush them."
maru,2koxi7,Perfundle,1 point,Fri Oct 31 04:18:15 2014 UTC,"Mugumogu has mentioned on her blog (in Japanese that she didn't translate) that Maru is the one that often initiates the play, and he wouldn't do that if he didn't like Hana's presence.  In any case, I don't know how you would be able to determine a cat's state of mind in this situation. You certainly can't trust Mugumogu's interpretation of their actions, because she's intentionally equating their facial gestures to those of humans despite cat expressions meaning entirely different things."
