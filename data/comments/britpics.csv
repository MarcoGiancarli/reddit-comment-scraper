Tommy Jones' Obelisk is found on its western flanks, in between the summit and Y Gyrn.  The summit is very similar to that of Pen y Fan: flat and anvil shaped. It is similarly formed from the relatively erosion-resistant Devonian age sandstones from the Upper Old Red Sandstone known as the Plateau Beds. It is marked by a large cairn. The summit is often crossed on the way to Pen y Fan. It offers good views down into Cwm Llwch and across the Usk valley to Brecon.   Nearby is one of the few natural lakes in the park, the diminutive Llyn Cwm Llwch.

britpics,3ail1m,udistbill,7,Sat Jun 20 16:09:45 2015 UTC,Short answer: anti austerity.
britpics,3ail1m,iridial,21,Sat Jun 20 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's something to do with the 100 odd billion that isn't being paid in tax by the large corporations, that if collected would end austerity and allow us to improve the NHS, Schools etc."
britpics,3ail1m,Keresyk,7,Sat Jun 20 16:23:52 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? Royal Mail is profitable. Selling it off has nothing to do with cuts.
britpics,3ail1m,North_London_Gunner,12,Sat Jun 20 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"""In economics, austerity is the policy of reducing government budget deficits.""  Still not sure why this is a bad thing. Doesn't it inevitably have to happen? Surely in the long term we'll be paying less interest on loans and thus be better off?"
britpics,3ail1m,Have_you_tried_this,14,Sat Jun 20 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"In economics it's never that simple, you have to be careful that you don't cut too much too quickly because you can cause the economy to grow less than it otherwise would and as the economy is smaller make the debt less manageable.  When things like investment in infrastructure or the amount of tax inspectors are being cut along with taxes for the better off, it begins to look like an ideological motivated attempt to shrink the state at any human cost. By simply playing on peoples ignorance, that the economy and a household budget are very different and work very differently."
britpics,3ail1m,GobshiteExtra,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does make sense. It's the natural thing to happen after a recession. You could keep spending the same, but with the economy, thus GDP, lower due to the recession, you'd get in a tonne of debt. That debt has to be repaid at some point and if you don't pay it off now, you'll have to later at a possibly higher interest. Being anti austerity is basically being pro austerity for the next generation, and it would be worse for them than for the current.   A lot of the people protesting here would argue things like raising tax for the rich etc, but doing that is just going to turn off current and future business, which means a lower GPD in the future and pretty much the same level of government spending forever."
britpics,3ail1m,Duke0fWellington,3,Sat Jun 20 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"There are logical reasons as to why austerity is not a good idea. The basic idea is that to recover from the recession, we actually need to put more money into the system, cutting costs means people won't be as willing to spend money and keep trading, but it's very complicated.  This is a good read: http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion  The UK are lagging behind the world on this. If you don't trust me, look at other countries approaches, or the experts. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/two-thirds-of-economists-say-coalition-austerity-harmed-the-economy-10149410.html"
britpics,3ail1m,SouperSausage,0,Sat Jun 20 21:58:50 2015 UTC,You know this government doesn't give a fuck when over 100k people show up to protest against austerity and Osborne announces - ON THE SAME DAY - to cut welfare spending by £12 billion.
britpics,3ail1m,TelevisionPotato,2,Sat Jun 20 23:02:32 2015 UTC,Tories planned these welfare cuts well before the election. The policy wasn't 'announced' yesterday. 11.3 million people voted for the Conservatives - 100 times then number of people you claim were out in protest yesterday.  Your implication seems to be that big protest = undoubtedly represents the will of the people. It doesn't. Liberals and youngsters are always far more likely to engage in political protests like this.
britpics,3ail1m,ChippieTheGreat,2,Sun Jun 21 02:52:17 2015 UTC,"Only 37% of the country actually voted for the Conservatives, and can you honestly tell me that this represents the ""will of the people"" instead?  People don't even vote for policies anymore, so there is no way that every single Tory voted desperately wanted £12 billion cut in welfare spending. Even if they did, that's still less than 2/5th of the county.  In other news, r/ukpolitics is a thing, let's just look at the pretty pictures instead now."
britpics,3ail1m,nerd-pony,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:01:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. This is the will of the people. I don't like FPTP. It sucks that a party can win a majority with just 37% of the vote. But it's the voting system we have. And anyway, if a second preference system (like AV) were used it is pretty much a guarantee that the Tories would have gotten more than 50% of the votes via second preference votes from Lib Dems and UKIP.  ps: I don't like r/ukpolitics. To many people downvotes opinions they just don't like. So the debates end up woefully unfair."
britpics,3ail1m,ChippieTheGreat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:36:06 2015 UTC,"People are down-voted to hell there because opinions are too absolute in some discussions. Yes, the torries planned these cuts in advance, it's just the timing of the announcement/confirmation that contrasted so much with the march. Big turnouts to protests like this definitely represents a large percentage of the population that will go misrepresented. 11.3 million people voted conservative, however, over 16 million (63%) people voted otherwise. As already said, 37% of people voted torries and they have 50% of seats in parliament; the imbalance of power is obvious and a lot of people on both sides of the political spectrum seem to agree that the voting system needs to change. The voices of so many people shouldn't fall on deaf ears, and when someone like Theresa May says things like ""You can choose protest, and continue to shout angrily from the sidelines for the next five years. Or you can choose partnership, and work with me"", It reeks of the kind of Darth Vader-like attitude a government needs to be able to continue bulldozing freedom with contempt for a lot of people."

britpics,37kujl,agentoneal,1 point,Fri May 29 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"Southwold and Aldeburgh in Suffolk are both really nice. They're very small towns though. Southwold has great beaches and is clean. Aldeburgh is a bit depressing in winter because most of the old fishermans cottages are now holiday homes, and the population is probably half of what it is in summer, but there's a vast shingle beach and the town itself is quite pretty."

Same company has done successful reefs in India and Australia.   There seems to have been a transition in the 80s where local tourism dropped and boscombe became a heroin haven with a nice strip on the beach, Bournemouth brought in tertiary industry like call centers and LV and Poole stayed as a nice quay with shitty, shifty suburbs.   Weekends fill up with laandan type cunts and locals looking for a fight. There just isn't the critical mass of people living there to make it better too many transients (students etc) and spread out suburbs. Lovely in the summer months when stuff gets going for the tourists (and the local xenophobes come out)  I would probably move back there though, convenient place and so close to the Jurassic coast and the new Forrest,"

britpics,37kujl,Duke0fWellington,3,Thu May 28 21:31:47 2015 UTC,Cleethorpes was the first one I did and that fort was a joy to do - it tries so hard to look sinister but just ends up coming off as a bit crap and grotty.

britpics,36w2io,MartianDreams,1 point,Fri May 22 18:34:19 2015 UTC,The reflection is fake. It's just a flipped version of the top half with the colours tweaked slightly.
britpics,36uxsb,ConSlom,1 point,Fri May 22 09:29:17 2015 UTC,That is a damn nice photo. I do love the Dartmouth/Kingswear area.
britpics,36stbt,simonvaux1,1 point,Thu May 21 20:58:26 2015 UTC,Nice!  You should totally crosspost this to /r/infrastructureporn!
britpics,36stbt,ZoeBlade,2,Fri May 22 08:35:47 2015 UTC,Done - thank you.
britpics,36qow4,theRedAxe,1 point,Thu May 21 10:46:40 2015 UTC,Thats gorgeous
britpics,36ni5y,Worton,3,Wed May 20 17:56:19 2015 UTC,I always thought Scotland was bigger than that somehow...
britpics,36ni5y,Gaggamaggot,5,Thu May 21 00:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yes I took it! It's in a place called Kilsyth, actually took it out of my hotel room. And the food there is lovely! The boathouse I think the hotel is called"
britpics,36ni5y,The_Doug_Dealer,3,Wed May 20 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"Weird I was in this exact hotel Last month, the room below this one. Lovely place"
britpics,36ni5y,pseud_o_nym,2,Wed May 20 20:49:50 2015 UTC,"I love this. I love this sub, too."

britpics,36mwg9,Carfre3,1 point,Wed May 20 15:36:16 2015 UTC,I left Worcester about 12 years ago. I don't think I'd recognise it if I went back now.
britpics,36le5s,scouserdave,3,Wed May 20 06:24:00 2015 UTC,"Beautiful spot, lovely photo. Miss my dog walks up the Clappers."
britpics,36le5s,Bognis,3,Wed May 20 10:36:48 2015 UTC,Breathtaking!
britpics,36le5s,BitOCrumpet,2,Wed May 20 12:51:14 2015 UTC,Fabulous picture.  It's somehow  reminiscent of an image one might find in a junk mail leaflet from the Jehova's Witnesses.
britpics,36le5s,clea,1 point,Wed May 20 15:33:54 2015 UTC,I'll photoshop a few smiley happy kids running the fields and see if I can flog it to them ;)

britpics,36e6g9,jallsopp,2,Mon May 18 18:03:59 2015 UTC,So beautiful--I miss England.  Thanks for posting.
britpics,36bms8,fluffsta007,5,Mon May 18 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"Wait, cars were moving on the M6?"
britpics,36bms8,JewmanJ,2,Mon May 18 14:17:17 2015 UTC,Eerily beautiful.  Is this near Birmingham?
britpics,36bms8,commander_hugo,2,Mon May 18 11:38:51 2015 UTC,Coventry.
britpics,36bms8,CheshireSwift,2,Mon May 18 15:01:15 2015 UTC,/r/exposureporn would probably be happy to see this.
britpics,36a12c,arbili,5,Sun May 17 17:19:47 2015 UTC,I live on the street that this photo was taken from! I never get sick of this view
britpics,36a12c,Tourniquetmanizkewl,2,Sun May 17 21:04:23 2015 UTC,Lived on Palace Street for three years at uni. Would give anything to go back amazing city!
britpics,367zjt,arbili,2,Sun May 17 01:25:11 2015 UTC,"Wow! Finally something from Northumberland on here, and in the least likely place - Blyth Harbour can be picturesque in what isn't a town of outstanding natural beauty. The turbines look great at sunrise/set as well.  Here's the same spot at sunrise and another shot of the beach."
britpics,366htu,gmj48,2,Sat May 16 17:01:22 2015 UTC,I took a picture of that when it was flooded down there earlier this year. Looked great with the reflection off the water.
britpics,366htu,harbourwall,2,Sat May 16 21:38:59 2015 UTC,yea I was hoping the water would be there!
britpics,366htu,Daffodils28,1 point,Sun May 17 16:11:31 2015 UTC,Haunting. Could you post your pic of the owl bench at Breamore House to /r/Owls? We will love it!
britpics,364g7d,arbili,2,Sat May 16 01:18:31 2015 UTC,Stunning
britpics,361tnl,fluffsta007,4,Fri May 15 11:37:38 2015 UTC,Cov native here. I approve of this picture.
britpics,361tnl,EvilMonkey1965,3,Fri May 15 18:44:21 2015 UTC,That is so beautiful.

britpics,35y5p0,fluffsta007,3,Thu May 14 14:22:51 2015 UTC,love it
britpics,35y5p0,Winston-Green,3,Thu May 14 23:27:18 2015 UTC,"It was worth it, nice job"
britpics,35y5p0,miracleof86,2,Fri May 15 01:05:09 2015 UTC,"Great photo, but LPT: you must have looked a right twat while doing that. I just place my camera on the floor exactly in the center, put it on auto-timer, and step away.  I've noticed anyone who sees me do it, instantly follows and does the same themselves.  P.S. I honestly don't want to seem like I'm preaching, it's a great photo but I just chuckled imagining seeing you laying on your back (ohh...kinky...)"
britpics,35y5p0,bengalitiger89,1 point,Fri May 15 09:13:27 2015 UTC,Good tip but the floor wasn't exactly level!
britpics,35y5p0,gillymuse,1 point,Fri May 15 10:22:57 2015 UTC,It must have been...inspiring.
britpics,35y5p0,steviebwoy,1 point,Fri May 15 09:12:08 2015 UTC,That would be perfectly symmetrical if it wasn't for the pigeon!
britpics,35y5p0,british_heretic,1 point,Fri May 15 10:39:53 2015 UTC,Pigeon? Where in my image is that?
britpics,35xfle,floatoonflickr,0,Thu May 14 09:17:27 2015 UTC,I hate these things. I live in Birmingham and they're just garish and ugly and go with nothing in the vicinity. Also completely out of place. Just on the pavement next to some bus stops.
britpics,35xfle,14h0urs,1 point,Thu May 14 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"I agree but I feel the buildings are more the ones that should be replaced, that part of broad street is a dive."
