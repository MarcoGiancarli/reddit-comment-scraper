I love it, because it lets you build colonies  without having to commit to a city in a bad location. You can get new luxuries/strategic resources for very little cost.

After about 6 or 7 turns I manage to cull out a path of soldiers into Berlin, releasing the city from their Polish oppressors with the intent to have the Germans be my new buffer zone into Polish Hamburg. No. I hit 'next turn' and Bismark, in the throne and robes the English nobles gifted him upon release from the Polish dungeons, declared war on me.

civmemes,1yo91e,north_coaster,1 point,Sun Feb 23 19:20:31 2014 UTC,"I invaded him at the end of medieval when I was in renaissance. Impi's may be great, but are no match for a fuckton of crossbows and musketmen."
civmemes,1yo91e,CorporateHobbyist,2,Sun Feb 23 22:37:10 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what difficulty?  I have a hard time imagining being able to beat Impi with an ~equal amount of crossbows/musketmen. Making an Impi with an Ikanda means it'll most likely have significant bonuses against gunpowder units and also very significant defense bonuses against ranged units.  Did you outnumber him or something?"
civmemes,1yo91e,Sometimes_Lies,2,Sun Feb 23 23:58:28 2014 UTC,"Emperor usually. The trick is to get range on the crossbowmen (either us england UU or farm with archers and upgrade as you go along) and blow out impis that can't hit you. Put a musketmen two-three tiles from the impi. when the impi attacks, it will either be right next to the musketman or on his spot (he's dead). then get the crossbowman to step back and fire. Do this, but have backup corssbows with logistics (and range if there) to bombard the impi. He should be dead soon. go one unit at a time and make sure you don't lose ranged units and your fine.  edit: forgot to mention: longswordmen could work as good as or better for this strategy."
civmemes,1yo91e,CorporateHobbyist,2,Mon Feb 24 00:52:43 2014 UTC,Is the Impi bonus against gunpowder units a promotion? I can't find it on the Impi i got gifted from a city-state.
civmemes,1yo91e,Lying_idiot,1 point,Tue Feb 25 08:41:06 2014 UTC,"The Ikanda unique barracks enables pre-gunpowder melee units to have a line of unique promotions, and it grants the first of these for free.  However, on closer look, I think you're right. I can't find the specific unique promotion that gives a bonus vs gunpowder, so it's possible that I'm confusing it with a bonus they get in the Scramble for Africa scenario. Sorry if I am mistaken!  Edit: though in this thread they talk about the UB giving a gunpowder bonus, so maybe I was right and just can't find a link to the correct promotion. Not sure, sorry! Edit 2: Googling for ""shaka bonus vs gunpowder"" (without quotes) comes up with a fair number of mentions, so guessing I didn't imagine it after all."
civmemes,1yo91e,Sometimes_Lies,2,Tue Feb 25 08:48:33 2014 UTC,the civiliopedia mentions it on the Impi http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Impi_(Civ5)  but not that online civiliopedia. weird. will have to check ingame as Shaka when i get the chance.
civmemes,1yo91e,Lying_idiot,1 point,Tue Feb 25 08:57:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah, interesting. I wonder if it got removed in a patch or something? As you can see from my edits, I did find several other places mentioning the bonus as well, so it definitely did exist at one point at least.  Now I'm curious if it got removed or if it's just an error in the online Civilopedia...  (ps, our usernames compliment each other pretty well.)"
civmemes,1yo91e,Sometimes_Lies,2,Tue Feb 25 08:58:28 2014 UTC,"Checked it!  As Venice, i get quite a lot of Impis gifted from a millitary city state.  I gifted a musketman to a city-state, declared war, and BAM! it showed up. Impis DO indeed do 25% extra damage versus gunpowder units.

civmemes,1jtzpw,LtDropshot,15,Tue Aug 6 19:51:07 2013 UTC,I did think this was a bit silly  but I would have liked them to be able to fly their range over water as long as the final title(s) are land. In that case it makes sense for them to fly rather than embark.
civmemes,1jtzpw,stalemate-resolution,12,Wed Aug 7 15:32:20 2013 UTC,I've never heard of a helicopter flying across the Atlantic.
civmemes,1jtzpw,Onzez,5,Wed Aug 7 07:20:01 2013 UTC,"for island maps, or maps with smaller bodies of water that aren't that wide (2-3 tiles) a helicopter should be able to just fly over the water."

civmemes,1jtzpw,Fwendly_Mushwoom,22,Tue Oct 8 07:45:25 2013 UTC,"A turn lasts a year, so it would be impractical to hover over the sea."
civmemes,1jtzpw,BeatPeet,8,Wed Aug 7 03:56:26 2013 UTC,Don't turns last for 20 years? Or is that just the tutorial...
civmemes,1jtzpw,bradtank44,4,Tue Aug 13 14:08:43 2013 UTC,"It depends. In the beginning, a turn lasts 140 years or something like that. In the lategame, a turn lasts a year. So I think that helicopters would be built in a time where a turn lasts 1-2 years."
civmemes,1jtzpw,BeatPeet,3,Tue Aug 13 15:31:43 2013 UTC,"OK, I thought time was passing by awful fast, But I hardly hit 100 BC before I  beat the tutorial"

civmemes,1i67jd,Cariban,3,Fri Jul 12 19:13:48 2013 UTC,Steam gave everyone who pre-ordered a copy of Civ IV for free.
civmemes,1i67jd,applejackfan,0,Sat Jul 13 15:48:04 2013 UTC,Two copies actually.
civmemes,1i67jd,jeff744,0,Sat Jul 13 20:24:09 2013 UTC,"I accidentally opened both, now I have two Civ 4's"
civmemes,1i67jd,applejackfan,4,Sun Jul 14 02:19:57 2013 UTC,One is the PC and the other the Mac version. You can't only open one.

civmemes,1hwv2r,imgurtranscriber,5,Tue Jul 9 03:43:05 2013 UTC,It's ok. I'm still playing gods and kings. And I haven't even enabled espionage yet. I'm going to get a few more years out of it yet before I get bored enough to buy BNW lol.

civmemes,1hu2lb,BroDoYouEvenRead,1 point,Sat Jul 13 09:37:29 2013 UTC,I never even thought about this. I'm a guy who goes for GL every single game and this seems like a much better idea.
civmemes,1hu2lb,The_Ballingness,2,Tue Aug 20 22:07:10 2013 UTC,"You know what's worse? Using a great engineer to bring the CN tower down to one turn, only to have it get sniped from you by Hiawatha who has about 500 cities."
civmemes,1hu2lb,redcoats,1 point,Mon Jul 15 07:01:12 2013 UTC,"On Emperor+ I only ever bother slingshotting tech with GL if there are at least 2 forest tiles I can chop down and turn into wooden hammers.  Scout -> Worker -> GL (usually I end up with GL research completing 1 turn before/after Worker completes, or the same day) -> Start working on GL while teching wood cutting & improve 1 tile with the worker in the meanwhile (usually finishes improvement 1 turn before tech finishes) -> finish off GL quick by chopping down 2 forest tiles (which leaves GL at ~3 turns left, give or take).  I rarely get beaten to GL when I do it that way, but that requires the 2+ forest tiles, which I often don't get.  Some might criticize producing a worker when you can steal one from a CS, but you'll very rarely find a CS before your scout finishes, and even then you have to walk it back to your city, which wastes time. I still steal 1-2 workers from nearby CS'es, but those are for building roads between capital and new cities, and improvements on the new cities."
civmemes,1gc2pd,Harlequnne,2,Fri Jun 14 13:00:31 2013 UTC,"All you needed was Wang Kon, aka Montezuma light. Starts a war with somebody every five turns, ends it two turns later.  Maximum douche."
civmemes,1g4ese,Kjulo,2,Tue Jun 11 14:29:33 2013 UTC,This makes me just...just so happy.
