Trucks,3e2jcu,desker,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"I cannot advise you on legality, but in many jurisdictions, it is Illegal to swap VINs. You would need documentation on where you got the donor cab, and keep receipts for ALL parts purchased.   At lease here in Utah, the UHP would need to inspect the vehicle and the title would be listed at reconstructed/rebuilt.   As far as feasibility, all you need is effort and drive. (a bunch of tools makes things easier too...)  If you have access to a lift, use it to lift the cab off the truck.   Additionally, if you ever plan on selling the truck, you will have a tough time selling something with a branded title."

It is preferred to other small trucks of the same size because you can get it with a v8. Something to look out for is a vehicle 96 and up. As that's when they started making the vehicles you can use the computer for checking engine light. If you are okay with a full size truck I would look for a 96 f150 with the i6 engine. At 300ci it won't be shy, and no matter how loaded down you are will not lose mpg. A 96 with the i6 and extended cab long bed is a jack of all trades. Will haul a lot in the bed, haul 5 people fine. Won't require much work other than basic care. Known to last for 300000 miles plus."

If you plan to expand to you, 3-4 employees, 3-4 mowers and all the fixings your looking at a 3/4T crew cab ideally.   If you plan to do more then lawns and get into actual landscaping you need to be on the hunt for an older truck with a dump bed. I'm finding a bunch of those near me for under 3k. Granted, harder to find an ext/crew cab one.   If you plan to expand do not forget to budget for a trailer, mower, and all that shit along with the truck."

Trucks,3dxkt6,_Connor,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:33 2015 UTC,do you have a slight high pitched whine while idling in gear? most noticable in a garage or up against a wall (like in a drive through) with the windows down?  I also have the 8speed... just wondering. thanks!
Trucks,3dxkt6,urmombaconsmynarwhal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:29 2015 UTC,I noticed that the exhaust almost makes a whistle/whine noise when driving by barriers or walls... it's almost like when you hear a turbo spooling in a diesel with a huge exhaust.  I haven't noticed anything while idling.
Trucks,3dxkt6,_Connor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:49:29 2015 UTC,"you might also hear a little chirp, particularly when you are coasting or off throttle for a while and lightly press the gas. it's annoying as hell but it's just the stupid exhaust valve... changing to the borla deletes the valve and the problem.  My whine is definitely the transmission... in the garage in park with the passenger window down you can hear it from P->D... i'm not losing sleep over it I think I heard it in another youtube video... just wondering (and watching, that's what warranties are for...)"

Trucks,3dxkt6,_Connor,4,Mon Jul 20 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a big of the 6.2 so far, other than it being way too quiet.  It has no rasp at all really.  I'm planning on doing a Borla exhaust in the next week or two.    I do a lot of longer trips, so I'm a fan of the gadgets and creature comforts.  Some of the options are just silly, like the lane departure warning.  I just leave it off."

Trucks,3dxkt6,DrewTheHobo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"Part of that has to do with the active noise cancelling in the cabin. But I agree, even with the windows down it doesn't sound nearly aggressive enough."

Trucks,3dxkt6,psykick5,2,Tue Jul 21 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"wow thanks for adding some insightful opinions to generate a great conversation!  but to go ahead and end it now, 6.2 in the silverado and escalade, monster, i believe the most powerful naturally aspirated v8 available in an SUV and pickup, though I dont know if that claim still stands for the pickups. absolute pleasure to drive in those trucks and to tow with  same 6.2 in the camaro, and in the standard corvette that destroys cars x4 its price. same 6.2 in the s/c z06 that destroys pretty much any super car under $500,000.  one engine, with slight differences, that wrecks the competition when it is placed in a car or truck. and on top of that, ultra reliable in a way that the competition cant even grasp  not really sure what more could be needed to convince someone otherwise."
Trucks,3dyl9r,megasaurass,28,Mon Jul 20 16:18:30 2015 UTC,I have heard both sides. Being a 6.4 owner myself who is in the middle of a rebuild be prepared to spend some coin at some point in the trucks lifespan. The 6.0's are a bit cheaper compared to the 6.4 in that department.   Also keep in mind that the posts on the internet are 90% bad as the guy who's truck runs fine isn't ranting in a forum.
Trucks,3dyl9r,savoltage,10,Mon Jul 20 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"not sure why this was downvoted, he brings up a valid point.  Most of the times on forums it is problems - no matter what vehicle type it is.  There are countless sections for mechanical, electrical, suspension, etc... How many times have you seen a section for - ""wow my car is running great!"" ? not to say that problems aren't valid, but there is the potential that it is made to seem worse than it is.  That being said,  if I were to get a 6.0 the first thing I would do would be to take it to a diesel mechanic and have it bulletproofed."
Trucks,3dyl9r,Tiny311,3,Mon Jul 20 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, now I have to go start a couple forum threads about all the amazing shit my truck and motorcycle are capable of."
Trucks,3dyl9r,desker,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"as a person who maintained a fleet of these things, I have no idea what could be done to ""bullet-proof"" them.  Titanium hpo pumps?  depleted uranium injectors?  ported and polished egr valve?"
Trucks,3dyl9r,PeteFord,14,Tue Jul 21 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"I've had about six 6.0's under my care in the last few years. As an engine, its a great piece of engineering. However, due to the rush to get it to market many technical problems were overlooked.  In my experience I have seen engines make it 300K+ with minimal/no issues, and I have seen engines with 50k blow the head gasket, as well as random intervals between 100-200k that they develop problems.  The trucks that were taken care of - properly serviced, not driven too hard but still worked under load for long periods of time seem to not have issues.  The trucks that took a dump - either they idled forever or they were pushed passed their limits.   At this point in time its smarter to go ahead and have the motor bulletproofed and the EGR cooler upgraded (or deleted) to solve the majority of the known issues. Once the engine has been worked on by a legitimate diesel mechanic (i've run across a few who can't the HEUI motors back to working once they have been aart) they are good strong engines."
Trucks,3dyl9r,bammad33,8,Mon Jul 20 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"Every diesel tech I've talked to said exactly this. The guys who buy the trucks and use them as such, tow/haul regularly and don't idle the shit out of them have a great time.  The guys that idle them, throw a lift on them and chip them and race them around town to the next stop light have nothing but troubles and general need to ""bullet proof"" them to keep them out of the wreckers."
Trucks,3dyl9r,SnuffThePunkz,6,Mon Jul 20 17:49:36 2015 UTC,Cousin had a 2005 f350. Lifted on 37s with this rediculous exhaust that would kick down and sound like a nascar exhaust. It was a blast and the girls loved it. Well maybe they did. Couldn't hear them over the exhaust. Sure enough he blew his head gaskets are 140k. Didn't treat his truck right so I wasn't surprised when it broke

Had some slag let loose in the turbo that chewed up everything down stream. He runs it fairly hard as he uses it to tow a 26ft gooseneck with 10k+ lbs of tractor + equipment. His saving grace was he did trade work for his local Ford dealer every year mowing and discing an empty lot for an extended warranty and 90% was covered."
Trucks,3dyl9r,M4X1M,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"I have a 2003, I tow a four wheeler trailer and not much else, I do load the shit out of the bed when I need to haul shit to the dump or whatever.  Stock height, stock setup minus the external MKM Customs Coolant filter. HPOP went out around 155K, not sure if it was the first, but I did the work myself and changed the oil cooler out and the ICP and IPR valves.  Runs pretty good, but I would avoid buying a 2003 or early 2004 as  if you needed to change the HPOP you have to take the intake manifold off on later models all you need to pull is the turbo and such. Plus the ICP is located in an easier place than the 2003 is to change out.  I would say if it has ever been chipped avoid it like the plague."
Trucks,3dyl9r,1345,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:55 2015 UTC,I used to have an '04 with the the 6.0. Never had any problems out of it other than the egr valve hanging open occasionallyand to solve that all I did was unplug it with the truck turned off. Motor was bone stock with 195k miles on it when I traded it. I never pulled anything with it but did drive it like it was stolen after reading about how they didn't like to be babied.
Trucks,3dyl9r,f250_powerstroke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"I don't post too often, and I seem to find the wrong people when I do! That said, I have never had a bad experience with the awesome people on this sub.  I really wanted to weigh-in, because I currently own a 6.0, and I love my truck.  I bought mine used, and it's a 2006 6.0, F350 King Ranch. I went all out. I got it with around 70k on it, and gave it a solid inspection, using both my eyes and my personal/fleet mechanic's. I had issues with this truck right up front. And you want to know how bad they were? They weren't. Fuel pump gasket and alternator. It was an Arizona truck that came to a mountainous part of California, so a small gasket issue was to be expected. I threw a DC Power Engineering alternator in to replace the other one, and have driven the truck without issues since.  I don't tow, and I very rarely put a heavy load in the bed. The truck is mostly used for commuting, and one 13 mile section of hill climbing every few days. I use Lucas injector cleaner every other tank, and the thing now has 130k miles.   I love my 6.0. I'm expecting that I'll have to do the bulletproof upgrade, but that's ok. I haven't had to yet, and I haven't had any issues that lead me to believe it's coming soon.   I was nervous when I bought mine for all of the reasons that people listed about 6.0 issues. I have absolutely zero regrets with my purchase, and if you take care of your trucks (maintenance, at least) then they're great. If you drive it and use it like a truck, but you don't take the time to lube and tune and do your regular service, then you might end up seeing the bad results.  Who knows, I might have the head go on me here soon. But until I do, I stand behind my truck with a shit-eating grin."

The only reason I mention this is because 1st gen Tundras were marketed as ""Full Size"" trucks.(The earlier T100 was considered more of a mid size)  I consider full size anything with a 8' bed that can safely haul at least 1000 lbs. And a 1st gen regular cab long bed Tundra meets that definition. Also by that definition, the only thing not full size about the newer Tacomas is the bed.
