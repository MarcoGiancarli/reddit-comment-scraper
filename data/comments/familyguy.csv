What some Christians did to others was based on their ideas, instead of their actions (implying I'm equally worse)? I specifically just called Christians out on what they have done to the world, ergo their actions. Not to mention that you just attributed what some Christians did to the world as part of their idea set, which you now implicitly want me to respect. You just made a very hypocritical comment, as this is completely 100% your bias trying to attack me, with a fallacy of an argument, that's just wrong on every level.   But I guess doing the same is fine when it suits your biases.     And what bias is that? Biased against unproven bullshit for which evidence is not just lacking, but contradicting? I never attack Christianity or any religion for anything other than what they stand for and what they do that's not empirically proven. Faith is just the believe that something is true without evidence, which just so happen to be the same criteria for delusion. If I need to respect that, the world would be even shittier than the dark ages, you know, that time when Christianity ran freely.      You're full of Christianity."

If a black man robs a store, is it because they're black or because of their shitty upbringing and bad choices? Maybe, just mayyybe, you'll find that when the majority of a population is religious, it isn't particularly hard to find that someone who behaves reprehensibly is also religious.  I'm also rather amused at your criticism of Christians, as if you could lump them all under a unified definition that unequivocally shows they're bad for society."

Nobody cares about what you're amused at or not.   as if you could lump them all under a unified definition that unequivocally shows they're bad for society.       What Christianity did is an absolute fact. I'm not generalizing anything. Christians know what they attach themselves to. Again, for the 3rd time, read the next sentences a couple of times so you can actually get it. I've only ever criticized what christianity has done in history. Are you denying what christianity has done in the past? Are you making the assumption that I'm making the assumption that all christians perpetuate what christianity has done in the past? Because I'm clearly not and is nowhere implied, that's completely your delusion.     One thing I can say, is that christianity is still unproven blind faith and anyone who chooses to be a christian also chooses to attach itself to that history, essentially supporting it. If you wouldn't support it, you wouldn't be a christian. That's not generalizing, that's criticising a general decision."

familyguy,3cszxk,thecontrolm7cl,-7,Fri Jul 10 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"Quite a pleasant surprise after an hour or so ago I saw a comment correcting someone at -30 and everyone below was laughing at them for bothering to correct the other person. The other person even made a reply like ""Thanks, if you ever want to learn Spanish I'll be happy to help"" in a sarcastic way. I thought it was just terrible and it's the reason I've stopped correcting people a long time ago and I've noticed others have stopped correcting me, too (some times it takes me a while to realized I've made a spelling mistake) which is horrible because in the past few years we've turned from ""Thanks!"" to ""Mind your own fucking business!""  /rant"

familyguy,3cx3rx,Boymankid,5,Sun Jul 12 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"I agree and that seems to be what has come to. I wasn't sure how Season 5 is.  I really dislike a lot of Season 10+ episodes because crap like Life of Brian, Herpes the Love Sore, and Fresh Heir are produced.  I do agree with these bad season there are a few gems.  Seth released a list of some of the episodes of next season. Most of the episode descriptions sound better than the episodes of the last few seasons. So far only one weird sex related episode and less political crap. The episodes seem more like plots from pre season 10."
familyguy,3cx3rx,Menessy27,3,Sun Jul 12 17:52:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it's declined personally. I haven't watched the 1-2 most recent seasons though. And normally i'm pretty quick to say if something's declined. I think if it had stayed the same as the first few seasons it would be a lot worse than it is now. 14 seasons of Stewie trying to kill Lois? sounds dull
familyguy,3cx3rx,wrecked_mate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:46:09 2015 UTC,Yeah but in Season 3 they lightened down on that and made him do some new hilarious things. I am not expecting to be obsessed with killing Lois.

familyguy,3cx3rx,protopod,4,Sat Jul 11 15:31:26 2015 UTC,I've seen some new episodes. I would call it devolution myself. I'm glad you enjoy it but I don't like personally how some people turned out.  Before Peter was an idiot childish jerkass with a good heart but now he is full blown sadistic.  Brian was a chill intelligent voice of reason but now is a liberal douche.  Also Stewie went from evil to a badley handeld gay stereotype.  But however I have seen some good new episodes.  How was last season? Did get better? I haven't heard too much negatively from last season.

They also bought rights to shows that were being canceled on other networks and then made new shows.  Which is what that joke was referring to.  Family Guy was never on UPN.

The show came about after Seth created a few short animated films ""Larry and Steve"". The show gained popularity and ran for a while but in 2000-ish the show was cancelled because fuck fox. That would have been it but the fans were so dedicated to the show and bought so many copies of the first 2 seasons that the show was brought back. Ever since that incident Family Guy has kept running, making 13 seasons to date and still going strong.   If you're referring to the plot/storyline: Family guy is an animated series about a lower middle class american family living in Quahog. Road Island. The majority of episodes revolve around the father, Peter Griffin, involving himself in some shenanigans.   If you're referring to what episodes to watch: All of them  If you're trying to stop watching it because it has taken over your life: Just accept that Family Guy is life and give into it  If you fucked up your post: It's ok we all make mistakes"

So she gets a piece a liverwurst and shoves it up in her vagina, so that when he f-cks her it'll feel tighter.  So she puts the liverwurst in her vagina, goes home with the guy, f-cks him; everything seems fine. She wakes the next morning and he is gone.

I love every season of Family Guy but first three seasons were really special. It was completely original during that time and after they were cancelled I felt they lost a lot of their magic. I think the characters of Brian, Stewie, Cleveland, and Joe improved after the cancellation. Also the shows repetitive jokes got really annoying such as The Giant Chicken, The Barbershop guys, Conway Twitty, Road House, and The Birds the word."

familyguy,38x04c,Sarithus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"I believe that some jokes are cut or altered when the episode first airs on Fox and then put back in when they go to DVD.  Two examples that I've noticed:    In ""Lois Kills Stewie,"" Meg is walking into her bedroom holding a pack of frozen hot dogs and saying, ""I'm gonna pretend you're the New York Knicks."" When they play that scene on other channels, she's already in bed with the hot dogs when she says her line.  There's a cutaway in ""It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One!""  where Peter sings a song called ""Cowboy Butt Sex."" It was changed to ""Cowboy Gay Sex"" in subsequent airings."
familyguy,38x04c,ericarlen,2,Tue Jun 9 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"In ""Death is a Bitch"" Peter decides to save the Dawson's Creek actors because he'll have nothing to watch on the day it is broadcast.  After saying this out loud, he looks embarrassed and looks at the camera saying ""except for the fine programming on Fox"" and does a nervous laugh.  The reference to Fox's programming is almost always cut when re-run by other channels."

I'd suggest they improve the main plot and make better side plot. It's like the writers only focus on the main plot and give no effort to the side plot. They do acknowledge this in the Liam Neeson episode.

familyguy,37vf69,Rus_s13,8,Sat May 30 22:07:33 2015 UTC,Be more like American Dad and have plots that actually center around characters and situations instead of Manatee Balls and cutaways.

All of the Futurama DVDS from the last run have the cheap, barely there, packaging and it just bugs me. I understand cost and all, but I like to protect my investement.  As for the Simpsons, they've released one semi crappy packaged season and then went back to the sturdier method. I'm not sure what happened. I wish more series used the good construction."
familyguy,37vqp3,ShadowSync,1 point,Sat May 30 21:37:19 2015 UTC,I'm honestly surprised how Family Guy has not had a Blu-Ray release especially considering how important home media is to the franchise (the high DVD sales resurrected it from the dead)

Probably because they don't benefit as much from the crisper picture as live-action shows do.   But I mean the Star Wars trilogy was released on Blu Ray and it looked much better. I was thinking they were going to start releasing blu rays after that. Oh well."

His name is a play on the term ""buzz-kill."" He is what one would imagine to be ""cool"" in late 19th-century times, but is a complete and utter buzzkill by modern standards; hence his name, and whence the humor surrounding him derives. The one who mentions how much of a buzzkill he is groans, lifts his glasses and rubs his eyes as if he has a migraine, at the end of each of Buzz's jokes. In ""Whistle While Your Wife Works,"" he takes away the joy from a drinking party Peter Griffin also attended.  Killington initiated a series of inkblot drawing discussions. In ""Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air,"" he is a candidate to replace the now-able walking Joe Swanson in the group of friends that also has Peter, Glenn Quagmire, and Cleveland Brown.

It was originally sung as a duet between the former and Kiki Dee. Peter Griffin and Rich Little, the latter posing as the ghost of Ronald Reagan via a ham radio, sing it in the Quahog Cantina karaoke bar in ""Quagmire's Baby"". Whenever Peter turns the microphone over to the ham radio, there is an enormous amount of feedback that makes it hard on the audience's ears.

familyguy,36gkqb,LaGreenZoro,4,Tue May 19 05:48:06 2015 UTC,"I'd be worried if they did a full out movie-length parody of it, simply because the same way Fox really pushed them to do Return of the Jedi, they might push them to do more marvel movies, or at the very least avengers (for more main characters or w/e).  It seems kinda risky to me. Plus I think the star wars episodes have less re-watch value to them, in my opinion."

It works on two levels. One is, it's about our office / work relationships - we all have 'that guy' who never goes out after hours for drinks or eats with the other co workers.   By juxtaposing that somewhat modern observation on a very old TV show in which the 2 are always seen fighting baddies but never seen just being normal ' buddies ', we have an anachronism as a joke. Pretty clever."
familyguy,34rhaw,stephenhawkingruns,-6,Mon May 4 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"So they put a normal life observation and change it to being a reference to our cultural entertainment consciousness? It's not funny because it's just an observation on work life so they try changing it to a silly situation like the Lone Ranger and Tonto. It reminds me of that other joke they did a while ago, the leopard who is concerned about his kid's school lunches at school during parent's evening.

familyguy,34rhaw,thenickdude,2,Tue May 5 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"""an"" is correct if you pronounce ""historic"" as ""'istoric"". Not common in American English but it is elsewhere, style guides differ quite a bit on this point and usage of ""an"" with ""historic"" varies even when it doesn't match the pronunciation:  http://editingandwritingservices.com/a-or-an-before-words-beginning-with-h/  This happens with other ""h"" words too. Wiktionary notes about the word ""herb"":    US pronunciation of the word varies; some speakers include the h-sound and others omit it, with the h-less pronunciation being the more common.   So if you say it ""erb"" it's ""an herb garden"", but in British English ""herb"" has a hard ""h"" sound so it's typically ""a herb garden"" there!"

But take into account that the show isn't realistic in his maturity aspect so no telling how old he is. The show had shown a scene before where Stewie got a birthday cake and Peter also got one so he doesn't feel left out so he has had his first birthday so we can infer he's 1+.

I truly love this show but it is still just a funny cartoon for our entertainment. To really question genetics of hair color, look it up. The pilot was a pilot, all flashbacks of a younger Lois she is red. And to top it all off, she knows how to get down. If these were real people this could be the scandal break of the last few centuries sending someone clearly straight to the Whitehouse or at least to the E! Channel.

Goldmember's accent is so off and his entire character is so unrecognizable, it breaks the film for most dutch people the first time they see it. You just constantly forget that he's supposed to be a dutchman, so none of the jokes about that seem to make any sense and just feel wrong. It was by far Mike Myers worst character and definitely the least researched.

familyguy,319xhs,DeathByFarts,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:00:18 2015 UTC,As stated your logic is incorrect. For it to be season 12 but volume 13. There has to be a volume that only has half a season on it. like volume 2&3 is season 2. That would then make season 12 volume 13
familyguy,319xhs,choad17,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"They released the series as ""volumes"" rather than seasons, so that each volume represented roughly half of two separate seasons. When it came time to release Volume 13, it had gotten to the point where it made up an entire season, they released it as Season 12. It is kind of annoying, as it suddenly goes from Volume 12 to Season 12."

Edit:  The more I think about it, I think that both Chris and Meg were / are both awkward teenagers, so they naturally got picked on.  There's always that ""weird"" kid who gets picked on.  Chris is just too dumb to realize it half the time.  So that leaves Meg to be the one who takes the brunt of it - Chris is too easy, and Meg really hates being picked on.  I think that's where bullies get their ""power"" - from knowing they're getting to the kid they're bullying.  Maybe, I don't know."

They cancelled Family Guy because Fox was ripping through television shows at the time.  Well Seth never got over it and when Fox offered him a new contract, (since Adult Swim kept it alive) he demanded more shows.  Well instead of giving us something new, unique, and with any bit effort he jammed 2 exact copies of Family Guy down our throat.  Not only are The Cleveland Show, and American Dad clones of Family Guy, he let the original show turn to boring shit.  Sure you can argue that The Simpsons turned to crap after season 12-13, and South Park after about 5 but those creators at least tried to offer up new alternatives.  The Simpsons creators gave us Futurama, which is absolutly nothing like The Simpsons.  Futurama is a smart, witty, emotional cartoon.  The charaters have depth, the storylines are amazing, and it might even have a more dedicated fan base then The Simpsons.  South Parks creators tried a few things that were totally different but never went anywhere like ""Thats My Bush"" but they did put out a smash broadway hit ""The Book of Mormon"".  Seth McFarlene is just a lazy writer that stuck it up Foxs ass, and we as an audience had no other choice put to tolerate it.  If American Dad or The Cleveland show came out before Family Guy both would be canceled in a season.  Honestly the show has turned to complete shit after ""The Stewie Griffin Movie""."

familyguy,30w9xj,Just4TheTrees,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:42:42 2015 UTC,It's usually because of events like sports or holidays or going up against big competition like the oscars. Sometimes it's based on the production schedule or just a desire to extend the season but this seasons scheduling is excessive.

familyguy,2zwngu,Kill_Frosty,19,Mon Mar 23 00:57:35 2015 UTC,"Most of the main characters changed and are now a different character than before. Family Guy has become more outrageous and silly in recent series.  Looking back at Peter in the first few series, he was an idiotic Homer Simpson-type character, now he acts more retarded...according to the Season 4 episode, ""Petarded"" he literally is retarded.   Quagmire has gone from a ladies man in the first few seasons to a sex addicted pervert. He was more perverted, again dring Season 4. The season 4 episode ""Blind Ambition"".  Meg, in the first few seasons was an average teenage girl, with average teenage problems. In the Season 4 episode, ""Don't Make Me Over"" she was more made out to be a family punching bag and has been ever since.   Cleveland was always a dull-voiced, secondary character that worked well as a secondary character. When The Cleveland Show began, he changed to a more upbeat and amusing character, but in different ways. I was never too fond of him as a primary character and I prefer the old Cleveland.  As for Brian, he was always made out to be an intelligent character and I think maybe the turning point was when he got a job writing for the New Yorker in ""Brian Goes Back to College"", again a season 4 episode. Since then he has basically been a bit of a ""douche""   It seems to me that season 4 was where the series changed, this was the series that was the first made after the recommission of Family Guy after it was cancelled in 2001."

familyguy,2zwngu,SecondClass-,3,Mon Mar 23 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"I can't say precisely when, but I want to say it was around the time fans were riding Seth hard on him using Brian as a mouthpiece for Seth's own political and social issues where Brian was basically the voice of reason and every show with him ended up with him being 100% right.  I want to say around season 6 or so when the show began pairing Stewie with Brian and there was someone there to call him out on occasion.  It seems Seth was listening to the criticism and saw their point.  Then it was just a gradual slide toward becoming the douche he is now, not dumb but not really learned enough to substantiate his opinions when challenged.  I don't think there was any one point but one that stands out to me is the episode where Brian dates Lauren from The Hills and is shown he can't stand not being the smart one and primarily likes to date women who aren't smart enough to see he is mostly talk."

familyguy,2ym1x2,Joicey_Banacheck,2,Tue Mar 10 23:55:53 2015 UTC,"I've always thought that the only people who can consistently understand Stewie are the ones who would believe a baby can talk, or who wouldn't be surprised by it. For instance jillian can as she's very stupid, same for Chris, Brian can since an he's an animal that can talk to humans so that goes for all humans, Lauren Conrad I don't think actually talks to Stewie directly in that episode, but other very intelligent people can also understand Stewie like in the episode with Brian's play, because they are smart enough to be open to the idea of a talking baby in a universe where there are so many talking animals. The only time it doesn't make sense is in the episode where Stewie appears on jolly farm and everyone, including the viewers can apparently understand him, but then he's acting older than he is so that would tie in to my 'if you expect to be able to understand him then you can' theory"

Peter doesn't interact with him cause he doesn't care but when he does he just hears whatever he wants out of the conversation like he does with everyone else.    Lois only hears what she wants, like if he's being angry towards her she just hears his angry tone and says something like ""Someone is cranky"" ""or ""no dessert for you"" but if he is being happy she'll be like ""who an affectionate little boy"".    Chris can understand but they don't have many interactions besides the newer seasons when the ""who can hear stewie"" debacle has kinda dropped off.  Everyone else only interacts with him and understands him if it's for plot or a joke.  Besides that it's just a 1 year old saying stuff so they tune it out cause who cares what a 1 year old is saying."

I still can't get into the show though even though it's been on for a while and I think i've seen all or nearly all the episodes.  It's harder to care about the characters because they are so inconsistent and they don't really care about each other.   I always think of it as how Bender on Futurama can be a dick to everyone and only care about himself, even in cases where doing so can really hurt or kill one of his friends or his best friend, but it works because he's a robot and he's supposed to be like that.  But American Dad feels like everyone is a Bender.  So it's just about the jokes and less about the characters.   Roger is very consistently funny though. It would be great if he was the only Bender character and the rest of the family actually cared about each other a little."

familyguy,2yfxli,CustomMadeGJ,3,Mon Mar 9 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. I guess everyone can define too far, but I didn't think it was. I agree with everyone though that it was more weird than funny."
familyguy,2yfxli,jhnybgood47,2,Mon Mar 9 20:56:41 2015 UTC,I think they were just trying to add to the Brian stewie friendship but in a really weird way.
familyguy,2yfxli,CustomMadeGJ,3,Mon Mar 9 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"It was a fine episode IMO, just not a big hit. Had enough laughs to keep me into it. ""We do not judge Stewie, we do not judge the machine"""
familyguy,2yfxli,JeremyMo88,4,Mon Mar 9 22:24:13 2015 UTC,I thought that demon looking kid (reference to The Grudge?) Was freaky as heck.  Actually make me cuss out loud at the screen and sleep with the lights on.   Damn red eyed creature...
familyguy,2yfxli,Doctor_Arkham,3,Thu Mar 12 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"IMO, totally fucked up, weird, disgusting, and one of the best episodes I've seen in a long time. It was hilarious and ridiculously messed up, but I think that's kind of the point of Family Guy, is to try to make you laugh as hard as possible with no bars held."
familyguy,2yfxli,CookingWithScorpion,3,Fri Mar 13 06:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think the herpes episode has been the nastiest by far- ugh, so detailed."
familyguy,2yfxli,HappyGoUnlucky,13,Sat Mar 14 03:50:35 2015 UTC,Not remotely funny! It reeked of desperation. I was so grossed out when Stewie was pregnant. That's the worst episode I've seen of Family Guy.
familyguy,2yfxli,CelcoLevi_,8,Mon Mar 9 18:33:17 2015 UTC,There were plenty of people who found this episode hilarious
familyguy,2yfxli,DearBurt,3,Tue Mar 10 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was kind of disappointed. The gang trying to create a viral video was weak and uneventful (wasting half the episode), and the Stewie/Brian baby storyline seemed like a rehashing of another story (but I can't remember which one, maybe the clone episode). However, some parts were funny, e.g. Stewie's pregnant photos and the Jack and Jill cutaway."
familyguy,2yfxli,bat_mayn,5,Mon Mar 9 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"Episode was completely fucked. I feel like they're taking it too far sometimes with Stewie's sexuality escapades. Brian was totally out of character, and didn't get upset enough. A baby is pregnant, and he's the father - yeah, sure he'll just accept it. Right.  None of the other characters really showed up in the house, which was weird.  Overall the episode was fucking weird. It's up there with Brian eating Stewie's shit out of a diaper and giving it extensive screen time."
familyguy,2yfxli,CelcoLevi_,4,Mon Mar 9 19:34:06 2015 UTC,Didn't Brian freak out and then try to kill the baby himself when Stewie refused to get an abortion?

familyguy,2ydzl9,whyhelloseymore,18,Wed Mar 11 03:19:33 2015 UTC,I think Brian giving Stewie herpes is a lot worse than this.

familyguy,2ydzl9,Lillixsim,3,Mon Mar 9 13:40:55 2015 UTC,I think that episode where Stewie and Brian were locked in a bank cell for three days was weirder
familyguy,2ydzl9,awesomemanftw,2,Mon Mar 16 12:21:49 2015 UTC,I remember an abortion episode involving Lois was never aired.
familyguy,2ydzl9,KingKabuki,3,Fri Mar 13 14:25:03 2015 UTC,it was aired. Just not in the US

familyguy,2ydzl9,G0PACKGO,7,Mon Mar 9 21:12:51 2015 UTC,"I know Brian and Stewie stuff tend to happen in some weird part of the house where the rest of the family doesn't exist, but this would have been a perfect time to have the entire family involved.  And they can always just break out the time machine in the end to fix everything."
familyguy,2ydzl9,uandtehbae,-5,Mon Mar 9 04:00:04 2015 UTC,"Sloppy writing, bizarre episode overall. Brian and Stewie exist within a vacuum in the house, where apparently no one else existed throughout his ""pregnancy"" and a bunch of half-breed 'babies' were running around.  Was just stupid and try-hard."
familyguy,2ydzl9,G0PACKGO,38,Mon Mar 9 19:36:35 2015 UTC,this is pretty fucking hilarious

familyguy,2ydzl9,Interestinmiltary,6,Mon Mar 9 05:53:20 2015 UTC,"The idea behind the company's marketing is to make customers an offer they can't refuse. In reality, Jos. A Bank relies on higher initial mark-ups before offering discounts to make money.  Like buy one, get seven free.   The higher mark-ups also create the perception of better quality. While other retailers might offer a suit for $600 and offer 25 percent off, Jos. A Bank's $1000 suit with 70 percent off seems like a better investment to customers."
familyguy,2ydzl9,coffeeshopslut,2,Mon Mar 9 10:35:34 2015 UTC,It is a better investment. By $150.
familyguy,2ydzl9,suddenly_satire,5,Mon Mar 9 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"They almost constantly have ""buy one get 2 free deals"" so the joke was that by ""robbing Jos A Bank"" he was practically stealing the suits to get a deal that good."

familyguy,2ydzl9,Keyblade27,3,Tue Mar 10 01:27:24 2015 UTC,Seems to be a running theme in MacFarlane shows to make a lot of the characters dumber/slower as the show goes on.

The premise was fucking insane, which I liked, but then they just took it nowhere. I mean, how the hell did they even manage to find their way to the most boring, played out pregnancy tropes ever when it's a goddamn crazy toddler genius impregnating himself with a bunch of half-dog-half-human kids?   And then they simply ignore every potential for conflict? Brian wanting him to abort because of the implications, people getting suspicious about stewies age, all those birth defects etc.  And somehow the b plot was even more boring!  The photoshoot montage was kinda funny I guess, but the rest of it was straight up GARBAGE."
familyguy,2ydzl9,Mybrainmelts,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:46:13 2015 UTC,But...they did have Brian yell about how they had to get an abortion. And people did get suspicious about Stewie's age.
familyguy,2ydzl9,ausernameitis,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:17:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   They also had a few of them die because of the defects, but what I was trying to say was that they didn't go any further with any of these. They just tossed them aside with throwaway lines and instead of developing and building those loaded approaches into a real story they went the easy, as in lazy, way of doing tired pregnancy/child rearing stuff with the supposed kicker being that he's a child himself and the kids are hybrids.  I mean, they even had the Doctor go like ""whatever"" when Stewies lie about being older landed on 14 (or was it 15?).  That moment felt like meta commentary about the writers room going ""Fuck it! I wanna be home by noon today."""

What I find good, is taking the chocolate kind, toasting it until its warm, and spreading a small amount of butter on the top. Just enough to make a glaze. It isn't a condiment. Makes it different, in a good way.   I usually only have one that way. Having both that way invokes that kind of weird feeling you get when you have a really high protein or fat meal, or when you eat too much chocolate."

The damn scene with the hotdog made me laugh so hard.  Meg's underrated, she has a lot of really funny moments.  I forgot her evil monkey problem made me laugh too"
familyguy,2xvvg2,creativeusername93,4,Thu Mar 5 02:28:05 2015 UTC,The first episode I remember her being the butt of the joke was in the episode when she got a makeover. That was an early episode of season 4. It seemed that when Family Guy was recommissioned they changed Meg's direction. She wasnt going to be the average teenage girl in the family. Looking at it another way she's probably the most normal character in it. Aside from the references to psychopathic tendencies.
familyguy,2xvvg2,itcouldhappen1,3,Wed Mar 4 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"I think her ""psychopathic tendencies"" are a normal reaction to her completely deranged family.

familyguy,2xvvg2,Kuya_Gshock,7,Thu Mar 5 11:40:34 2015 UTC,"Because Meg was never an interesting character. Look at Lisa on The Simpsons, she's the least interesting Simpson, yet the writers continue to shove Lisa down the viewers' throats. Lisa was interesting earlier in the show, but at this point she's the worst. Family Guy's writers at least have the decency to not force the viewers to accept Meg."

familyguy,2xqdos,dkaise4,2,Tue Mar 3 05:45:41 2015 UTC,It's not the kinda show that you really need to start at the very beginning. Of course there are running jokes throughout the entire show.

familyguy,2tv41h,ThBOnEr,2,Wed Jan 28 11:32:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like the first one.  The problem I have is Seth MacFarlane, while he's very funny and I love him to death, he's lost all subtly and he constantly goes too far with his jokes, he goes too dirty to the point where it's not funny it's just disgusting.  It's not just him, understand, this is comedy as a whole, it's all going to shit.  For example, this scene from the last movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6WLddDc55A  It went too far and it's like the that was recognized that and instead of changing the joke they just made the character realize that was too far?  It's not funny and yet shit like this keeps making it into movies, shows, stand up acts, comedy in general and it's just annoying and really it's not funny at all.  Stewie is a perfect example of this, at the start of the show it was hinted that Stewie was gay, it was subtle, but it was there and that's why it was funny.  But as the show goes on it's like the writers think we're idiots and have to shove that fact down our throat, ""LOOK LOOK THE BABY IS GAY ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS HAHAHAHAHAH.""  I just don't like it, I don't like being treated like an idiot and all of Seth's latest stuff has felt like he/they just think we're all idiots who have to have EVERY SINGLE JOKE explained like we're children who have no knowledge of the world.  https://i.imgur.com/81Q2Ph.jpg  This...this is what they're doing, except it's not pictures of their kids they're smacking us with, it's their crappy jokes.  I just want comedy to go back to being just funny and not stupid and disgusting.  Like I said though, before everybody goes off on me, the problem I have isn't just with MacFarlane, it's with modern comedy as a whole."

But then she looks at the camera and says ""how come I never get any lines in these things??""  --cringe--  I thought it was funny until that moment.  Felt like they over-explained the joke.

Likewise, it fits the narrative that people who believe in God are only more happy, generally, because they are simply more stupid, thus has nothing to do with God.

familyguy,2ro4yj,Dorito_Troll,0,Thu Jan 8 01:11:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's right... Is it right? Maybe not.   Well I'm glad you're at least on the fence about the idea.

No other religion puts people in a state of fear like that, and no other religion has been used to justify national tragedies (like bombings, 9/11, etc.). So yes there might be a lot of predijuist view points against Muslims, but it's completely justified.   I wouldn't say it's unjustified - it makes sense to see a bunch of Muslims, preaching Islam, and saying they are killing in the name of Islam, to blame Islam.  But let's look at where that gets us.  What would you do, ban the Quran? You can't do that - even if you tried, people can find a way to spread a book. Convince people who are Islam to give up their faith and join another? Good luck with that.  It's a bit like blaming guns for violence. Yes, American culture is full of guns, it worships guns, and thousands more people die from gun deaths in America than radical Islam in the world every year. But saying it's the gun's fault, trying to ban guns, without looking at the societal, economic, and cultural root causes of violence, wouldn't get us very far at all.  The quran is a bit like the swastika - one is just a book, the other is just a symbol.  But a culture's decision how to interpret it can change what it means for people forever.  Germany banned the swastika - did it stop people from becoming neo-nazis?  No.    What we need to look at is their culture, not their religion. Is it one like ours, where even when we vehemently disagree on the most important and controversial topics, we voice our opinions, all the time, on the internet, even in groups where our opinion is the minority. And because we are so used to hearing people that disagree with us, the worst that usually happens is an angry comment battle.  Maybe it's because in their culture, nobody openly disagrees with anybody. You just don't do it. If it's so important for you to break that rule and argue with them, it had damn well better be so important that you would kill them over it. Everyone that agrees with you stays with you and the ones that don't, you never hear from.  We need to stop blaming Islam, and look at the real root causes for this problem. Not because it is offensive to people who peacefully worship it - they can handle it - but because it isn't going to get us anywhere."

Religions don't cause people to go crazy and want to kill a bunch of people.  What does, is cultural echo chambers - the more people affirm each other's angry opinions, the more those opinions become more violent and destructive.    What we need to look at is their culture, not their religion.  Is it one like ours, where even when we vehemently disagree on the most important and controversial topics, we voice our opinions, all the time, on the internet, even in groups where our opinion is the minority.

Everyone that agrees with you stays with you and the ones that don't, you never hear from.  People say that it's because the Quran tells them to kill people.  So does the Bible!  But there's something different about our culture that makes us not take our religions so seriously.  What would you do, ban the Quran?  You can't do that - even if you tried, people can find a way to spread a book.  Convince people who are Islam to give up their faith and join another?  Good luck with that.    We really need to stop blaming Islam for violence - it's like blaming guns for violence.  Yes, American culture is full of guns, it worships guns, and thousands more people die from gun deaths in America than radical Islam in the world every year.  But saying it's the gun's fault, trying to ban guns, without looking at the societal, economic, and cultural root causes of violence, wouldn't get us very far at all."
familyguy,2ro4yj,herisee,2,Thu Jan 8 03:16:19 2015 UTC,"Religions do indeed cause people to go crazy. If you are brainwashed to believe that fairy tales are real and reality is all here because some creature did a magic trick, then indeed you are crazy. End of story. As for the violent kind this is just a symptom of just how far divorced from reality these people are. While you can not outright ban these things you can make laws that confine this to only being legal on church/mosque/temple grounds and not loose on the world in general. Everyone has the right to believe as they will, however they do not have the right to inflict their beliefs on others."

Well when Brian killed him, he said something like ""How's that for positive reinforcement."" The fact is that Pavlov had nothing to do with reinforcement. That was Skinner with his Operant Conditioning. What Pavlov is known for is Classic conditioning. The latter involves him binding 2 stimuli together to have the same response.    Where as Operant conditioning is the consequences (reinforcement) that a certain behavior have, will make you stop doing that behavior or do it more.    I wont go to much in detail since it both are huge topics who are sort of alike and a pain for the majority of psychology students to distinguish!

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 7, 2012. The episode follows the Griffin family becoming a Nielsen family and Peter attempting to take over the TV airwaves.  This episode was dedicated in memory of both Phyllis Diller (who voiced Thelma Griffin in several episodes of the show) and Michael Clarke Duncan (who had a brief voice role in this episode). This episode was also one of Duncan's final roles before his untimely death from complications following a heart attack.

familyguy,2qhnoj,BetweenTheCheeks,3,Sat Dec 27 01:06:27 2014 UTC,"I know girls that watched all the episodes on Netflix and love the series so (however understandable) it's not that universal.   That said, Peter delves into misogynistic humor a fucking lot and the show itself sometimes backs into that as well (see the end of Stewie's simulation of the gang losing their memories episode).  Also tons of racial humor in the show centers around dick size or dick whatever (""Gentlemen, I present to you...the Asian!"") that women don't really empathize with as much as guys. Also some of the cutaways involve women put into sexually demeaning situations (a la the Penguin Publishing cutaway, Jesus telekinetically locking the door of a date, and to a lesser extent though I feel it captures the theme I'm going for perfectly, ""You're a McDonald, not a whore."")  Those complaints are (relatively) minor as the show itself isn't really geared towards inclusion (that is its own bag of worms). Its trademark un-PC humor and the genre of TV sitcoms it parodies is/was geared towards the traditional 'Family Guy' coming back from work to relax on some TV (think the guy from the theme of the Cyanide and Happiness show except it ends in front of a TV than a PC). Seth only really had that guy in mind when making the show and that kind of shows sometimes.  But at the end of the day, the show does a lot to be appreciated by and disgust everyone (though not necessarily at the exact same time)."

Those of us that REALLY enjoy this type of nonsensical, stupid (albeit sometimes really clever) humor typically hang out with the people that do as well.  Most people are going to associate with those similar to them and humor is a really important personality trait.    Now, if you're the type of person that's more social, or has a lot of acquaintances (not really friends) you may know a LOT of different archetypes of people.  These people may not necessarily share your sense of humor and may think jokes like those in Family Guy are stupid/idiotic.  And to comment, my wife LOVES Family Guy and American Dad.  She's not so into Cleveland Show (I think that show didn't get a fair shake.  I loved it.)"

They don't even license new episodes to tv until about a year after they originally air in the US.  Which is odd because, in reverse, the BBC does license its shows worldwide, like Doctor Who, on release day.  Theres also an issue with long-standing contracts with tv networks like virgin and sky, which prevent licensing to other parties like netflix.   TL;DR The problem isn't so much with netflix, but other companies that license content."

The last thing the writers could give a shit about is the quality of these new episodes, 'cause let's face it: they're absolute crap compared to the ones from the pre-cancellation seasons.  Not to say that there haven't been some gems in the later seasons (I love ""Road to the Multiverse"" and ""Back to the Pilot""), but the same grating character tropes are getting old and the jokes and cutaways just aren't as clever as they used to be. It hasn't evolved, it's devolved, and that's a shame, especially with the legacy this show has left."
familyguy,2p967r,Moon_Mist,1 point,Sun Dec 14 21:30:24 2014 UTC,It varies from episode to episode. That said for sure its not as new and fresh as its first seasons which is normal. Maybe they should do like South Park and change things up a bit.

I think overall it's clear that this show isn't as funny right now as it was in the past. I still watch it and enjoy it cause it I like the type of humor.  My main problem is that a lot of times they can't get a proper main plot in which to base the episode and almost always start with a short plot that suddenly changes to something completely different which is supposed to be the main plot. In the end there's no time to make a proper story and some episodes rely almost solely on cutaways and gags unrelated to the plot (the worst offender recently in my opinion is the one in which they find out Quagmire is bold and suddenly after 10min the episode is about Carter having a cure for cancer).  I really liked the recent episode with Jesus. The story revolved around him from the start, had a decent development and a good conclusion in my opinion."

There is a North Harbor Drive nearby (902-something) that only goes up to ~1200, and there's a South Harbor Drive a further 20 miles away.  Also, there's no Family Televsion Council within the first few Google search results.  EDIT: I thought about this a bit more. As North Harbor Drive is next to a pier (and only goes up to ~1200), it sort of implies that 3170 is along the pier and past it. In other words, if you have a problem with the episode, ""take a long walk off a short pier""."

familyguy,2oklqv,mrawesomebroseidon,5,Wed Dec 10 11:48:16 2014 UTC,"Very lazy episode I thought. Seemed to be written for the purpose to solely offend and be edgy. Found a lot of the jokes came without effort, especially the one towards the end, ""Whatever, I'm not even real anyway"". This along with the ""Hey, that's about us line"" just came across as an episode where the writers were just going fuck it let's see how many people we can get a rise out of. Which was well accomplished, I imagine, if that's what they were going for but it doesn't make for very entertaining TV.   Ultimately, this episode had some funny moments, as every episode does, but was sadly lacking in the fun, twisted but clever out look and humour that other Christmas and Jesus oriented episodes have had in the series."

familyguy,2oklqv,PeaceThroughJesus,-18,Tue Dec 9 04:43:46 2014 UTC,"Review from an ideological standpoint: They couldn't of made it more obvious that the writers, the production team, and Seth McFarlane is a group of progressive seculars if they tried, and some of the things like the ""I'm from Israel"" causing a buzzer to go off was extremely ignorant. I also loved the ""Whatever I'm not even real Merry Christmas"" line because of it's ignorance as well. Jesus of Nazareth of the bible is in fact a historical figure and that is agreed on by scholars of history religious and nonreligious. To try and say refute that claim will raise eyes from any reputable historian you talk to. Yes, Jesus is real.  The debated part of Jesus is his divinity, not his existence.  Review from family guy watcher standpoint: I loved this damn episode. The Tasmanian Devil gig and the Fracking joke killed me. They did quite a good job on the humor.   The humor &amp; scenes were the best episode I've saw in a while. The ignorance on the other hand Seth and the writers used to take advantage of an episode like this was simply awful though.  Edit: Ahh downvotes for loving an episode but disliking ignorance of the writers. Stay classy Reddit."

Secondly,   ""I'm from Israel"" causing a buzzer to go off was extremely ignorant.   It's a joke. Maybe you don't find it funny, and that's okay. Do try though not to judge too harshly, calling people ignorant because of it. Other people find it funny."
familyguy,2oklqv,PeaceThroughJesus,-10,Mon Dec 8 12:25:20 2014 UTC,"Please go check that source, friend.  Even with a little bit of diving around there you will still find Jesus' historical existence being true is absolutely the most predominant & viable option for historians according to what they have and know of from that time. Finding viable and accredited articles from reputable historians showing against the existence of Jesus of Nazerath is not very common at all now-a-days.   It's a joke. Maybe you don't find it funny, and that's okay. Do try though not to judge too harshly, calling people ignorant because of it. Other people find it funny   Fair enough, but just because others may find something like that funny doesn't mean it isn't very bigoted. Let me put it this way. If that would of said ""I'm from Palestine"" and a buzzer went off? There would be shit show from the viewers and even problems for the producing company. Simple as that.

There are people who believe that Jews are the devil, and most people know someone that talks about how ""Jews control everything"". The fact that it is bigoted is what makes it funny to people, because they are familiar with the particular type of bigotry. Jokes like this make fun of the bigotry, not of the ""target group"".  Your example misses the mark IMO because it would be like making a joke about Canadians being uber-industrious, or Germans being fat, or Americans being ultra-kind. There is nothing there for your subconscious to make the necessary connections for you to laugh, and you're just left with the stupid of the statement.   Finding viable and accredited articles from reputable historians showing against the existence of Jesus of Nazerath is not very common at all now-a-days.   I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. How can you prove that somebody did NOT exist, and who and when was it tried?

I'm very, very VERY confident this gag was not targeted at antisemitism bigotry. Not even close. That's kind of a long jump, in my opinion. I simply think it was a progressive anti-Israel joke, which is understandable because a majority of the Family Guy crew are secular progressives. Put two and two together, and secular progressives are usually not in fond support of Israel.. I'm okay with them having different views, but using silly & unnecessary attacks like that on a Christmas episode was off and was ignorant. Again, refer back to if that was a middle-eastern skinned man who claimed he was from Palestine and then a buzzer went off? However, I respect if you truly believe the joke was targeted at bigoted antisemitics.    I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. How can you prove that somebody did NOT exist, and who and when was it tried? The fact is, it's quite possible for a historical jesus tho have existed, but there isn't enough evidence to say with absolute certainty.   Now hold on a bit man.. being able to conclude somebody doesn't exist is definitely a possible task. Not a ridiculous task by any measures to be honest. There is no certain evidence claiming ""We found it, Jesus Christ walked around here."" but I will again repeat that Jesus Christ's existence upon this earth is being less and less refuted day by day. The majority of even the credible historians, religious and nonreligious, are overwhelmingly in acceptance of Christ of Nazareth. The real problem people get on about is his divinity."
familyguy,2oklqv,PeaceThroughJesus,1 point,Mon Dec 8 23:07:09 2014 UTC,"So you don't find it funny because someone, who in your mind, hates jews wrote that joke. If it was a jew that wrote that joke it would be funny to you. That makes sense. I wouldn't laugh at a black joke made by a nazi, but I would probably laugh at the same joke if it was made by someone else.   refer back to if that was a middle-eastern skinned man who claimed he was from Palestine and then a buzzer went off?   I explained why I wouldn't find that funny with the analogy with the canadians, germans and americans.   However, I respect if you truly believe the joke was targeted at bigoted antisemitics.   Personally, I don't care what the intent behind it was, and I don't presume to know. I just explained what, I think, makes it funny to me and other people.   Now hold on a bit man.. being able to conclude somebody doesn't exist is definitely a possible task. Not a ridiculous task by any measures to be honest.   It's different to conclude that somebody probably didn't exist based on absence of evidence and another thing to prove somebody didn't exist based on evidence of absence. The burden of proof falls on a different side.  I say there was this dude called Isomenis in the army of Alexander the Great that slashed open 3 Persians and took an arrow to the knee on a Friday. Can you prove he didn't exist?   I will again repeat that Jesus Christ's existence upon this earth is being less and less refuted day by day. The majority of even the credible historians, religious and nonreligious, are overwhelmingly in acceptance of Christ of Nazareth.    citation needed. Upon reviewing discussions and sources I admit I misunderstood disagreements about his life and works as disagreements about his existence. I now understand that the general consensus is that a dude named Jesus was born, he preached and was executed by the Romans."

Though I do agree that the first few seasons were absolutely amazing, I feel that the crew behind the show have really developed in their story telling and production abilities. Look at the season 9 opener. The murder mystery one. It was their first episode in HD and they took full advantage of it. Both with a great mystery theme (based off of Clue obviously) that had numerous throwbacks and homages and a great collection of characters with unique (albeit some more unique than others) interactions and traits.

familyguy,2ly86o,GodOfTheSunRa,14,Tue Nov 11 08:53:09 2014 UTC,You could say the same about any show in its 13th season.   bonnie clearly wants to kill joe because he is sad/mopey and not as courageous as he once was.   Joe's confidence has clearly given way to depression.
familyguy,2ly86o,luigirools,11,Tue Nov 11 14:55:27 2014 UTC,"I watch the older ones a lot, and I definitely noticed all of the changes. In a show running this long, change is inevitable, but the types of changes that this show has gone through, I haven't really cared for. The whole Stewie being more gay than straight has been a big part of the show since Season 03 I believe. That's not really a new development."
familyguy,2ly86o,whats_real,5,Tue Nov 11 15:33:01 2014 UTC,The whole Stewie being feminine and then gay thing started in the episode where he goes to hell and decides he needs to be more good. He makes Brian brownies and rubs his shoulders.
familyguy,2ly86o,DeathByFarts,2,Wed Nov 12 00:06:28 2014 UTC,"In a show running this long, change is inevitable,   Inevitable might not be the right word there. Common perhaps , but not inevitable. The Simpsons have not gone through these sorts of changes. At least not that I have noticed."
familyguy,2ly86o,luigirools,4,Tue Nov 11 15:42:09 2014 UTC,"Oh the Simpsons has changed a lot, as much as any other show that goes on for as long as these two have. Change is unavoidable, but that's not bad. I love the Simpsons just as much as always, but I feel that Family guy has dropped in quality during Season 12, this season however things are looking much better."
familyguy,2ly86o,DeathByFarts,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:48:10 2014 UTC,"Kindly provide an example in the Simpsons , as I cant think of one.   In FG there have been basic personality changes , stewie doesn't try and kill lois anymore as a major example. With the Simpsons , Homer still goes to moes , bart still rides a skatboard ,  martin is still in love with lisa and flanders is still a bible thumper."
familyguy,2ly86o,luigirools,6,Tue Nov 11 15:54:21 2014 UTC,"Cuntrystorm provides an excellent example below me. The show's core concepts may not have changed as much as Family guy has, but the characters themselves have all changed to become more extreme versions of themselves at an earlier time. Flanders is good example, in the first few seasons, Flanders is just a holy man, who loves Jesus. In recent years, he goes to extreme Jesus into every facit of his life. Change is unavoidable, and in my opinion necessary quality to have if you expect the show to continue. This is the exact reason it has gone on for 26 consecutive seasons now, it changes with the time and it's audience. Very gracefully I might add."
familyguy,2ly86o,DeathByFarts,0,Tue Nov 11 16:27:25 2014 UTC,"I guess .. I just dont see it as the same thing   Stewie is a completely different character. Homer is still the same core guy , bart is the same at the core .. blah .. blah ..   Anyway ...."
familyguy,2ly86o,cuntrystorm,6,Tue Nov 11 16:33:14 2014 UTC,"The term ""flanderization"" came directly from the Simpsons. It has to do with how Ned Flanders becomes more dorky and religious as the show progresses."
familyguy,2ly86o,DeathByFarts,5,Tue Nov 11 16:10:57 2014 UTC,"But thats taking existing personality traits and expanding on them. Thats not what is happening with FG.   Stewie isn't focused on matricide anymore. Joe is depressed ... Quagmire isnt a horrny toad driven by his dick. These are basic personality changes.   Flanders is the same core character. In fact , one could argue that flanders has not changed , we just happen to see more of that portion of his personality now. We just got to know him better."
familyguy,2ly86o,CeleryintheButt,3,Tue Nov 11 18:16:44 2014 UTC,"I've been watching the show since the pilot first aired. It seemed like each time the show was canceled and brought back there were major character changes. The two changes that bother me the most are how Peter is more childish and retarded, and how hated Meg is within the family. Peter was always dumb but they started taking that stupidity to extremes while also making him act like a child, getting lost in a store calling for lois, making Kool Aid with Quagmire are just some examples. I love the show and it still cracks me up but it has changed a great deal since the original run."

A few people found it pretty strange trying to talk to me while I was wearing it, they kept wanting to look up at the quagmire eyes so it was pretty off-putting!  It worked well enough for the majority of the night anyways, the only issue was that I haddnt reinforced the top of the inside well enough, so it shifted (probably because a bunch of people kept jamming it on their heads) and the mouth unaligned from my eyes.

One of the biggest complaints on the many cancelling of shows at the hands of Fox, is that they have extremely poor continuity issues with airing their prime shows. They used to air them completely out of order as well.  Sports is their true money maker, as it is for the rest of cable - so fans of skipped shows are told to fuck off and wait for next week. They won't air it online as a show of good faith (e.g. like Comedy Central & Adult Swim), rather they want to make everyone wait so they can rake in advertising ratings. In the end, they damage their own long term ratings, because people tune out if a show doesn't air for weeks.   Thus, why Fox is famous for all their many, many dead shows. Let us not forget that they actually canceled Family Guy at one point. They also canceled Futurama. Yeah, that happened.  Fox fucking blows, really. I wish I could watch this show anywhere else. I end up just getting new episodes by another means which shall not be named, because it is far more convenient."

Critising the series on this sub gets you nothing but downvotes, but I have to say the last season was not very good at all. Each episode had a chuckle or two, but the show to me seems tired. If anything the newest season has been a step in the right direction, but still they are not very funny overall. I loved the crossover though. I definitely feel that the show has fallen from grace, seeing as though IMO the entire last season was just not very good at all."
familyguy,2khb25,luigirools,2,Wed Oct 29 20:01:24 2014 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I thought season 12 was a lot better than the previous few seasons. I liked most of the episodes in it, and they didn't feel like repeats; they felt original."
familyguy,2khb25,youtbuddcody,1 point,Fri Oct 31 05:36:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I can see what you're saying. I thought the season was pretty funny for the most part, it just paled in comparison to seasons 7 and 8, which I see as kind of a golden age for Family Guy."
familyguy,2khb25,youtbuddcody,2,Fri Oct 31 22:37:52 2014 UTC,"Besides Family Guy, it seems that those are the golden seasons for most shows (except the Cleveland Show). The Simpsons is a perfect example of this. King of the Hill was the same. Futureama had such a cult following when they left Fox because the show ended when it was at its best. IMO, if Fox let it run any longer the show would major gone down in quality too.  I just hope the FG movie is good. Family Guy is amazing at musical numbers, and since Seth said it would follow that theme it'll probably be awesome."

His position in the house has changed too, at one time he was peter's sidekick and a voice of reason, a straight man if you will, to peter's stupidity. Recent seasons have made a change that I'm not particularly fond of, and that is making Brian nothing more than a freeloading douche. It's not like I don't like change, it's that this change isn't very funny, and it is unfortunate because the voice of reason, straight man dynamic made Brian my favorite character from the beginning seasons."

I'll make edits on commericial breaks.   Edit: Well, she missed the entire first part. She went right when it started to make a TV dinner, then she went on FarmVille. Idk but I'm already annoyed.  Edit 2: I asked her how she liked it so far and she said, ""I'm surprised it's not as dirty as it usually is. What happened?"" She also called Peter a pile of shit. At least she's laighing and enjoying it so far.   Edit 3: She didn't get the circlejerk joke. After I explained it to her she said, ""Is that where they 'do that' infront of each other? Isn't that gay? Do gay guys only do that?"" She was starring at me with a disgusted look on her face. I replied, ""I don't know mom, I've never been apart of one.""

They bring all these half naked chicks into the shop, with cookie names, and then introduce her, a very attractive woman who is just a little overweight and name her Butter. I was like, ""Of fucking course, you have an overweight woman and you turn her into a joke."" I mean look, I get it. It's Family Guy. I know how they work. But I am so FUCKING sick of overweight woman being the butt of jokes. That character is never seen again in the episode, even though I was hoping she would be, and only referenced once more to make a really mean, gross joke.

I'm originally a huge Family Guy fan. I only watched it on Adult Swim. When I got older, I watched it on Animation Domination (RIP) and decided to stick around for American Dad. It was love at first sight! Now I watch it as much as Family Guy.  However, I have memorized a lot of things FG and can nearly recite entire episodes. I should note that the busier Seth Macfarlane gets, and the less time he spends on other projects, the less funnier Family Guy gets. Just my opinion.   I'm a Seth MacFarlane fan and love most of his work. I grew up watching Johnny Bravo with my Dad when I was younger, and I feel like I grew up watching Seth. When I reflect, I favored a lot of the shows he had involvement in. It's probably a coincidence though, because i didn't pay attention to 'behind the scenes' when I was a kid.   I loved Ted and liked A Million Ways pretty well, and i'm stoked that it's getting a sequel.  I'm also excited that a Family Guy movie is in the works. IMO, Family Guy has it's stronger moments when they have musical numbers incorporated in its episodes, so the fact the movie is probably going to be a musical is extremely promising.   I wasn't a huge fan of Dads though. I'm fairly excited for his new show 'Bordertown' which is coming next spring. I like the animation style and the plot for it sounds promising. He's had a lot of involvement in it so i'm expecting it to be funny.   Sorry to go off; I'll stop for now. lol. I'm into film & television and could write all day about other shows, directors, producers, etc.   When did you first start watching AD? Do you remember your first episode?"
familyguy,2j07o7,AQUA2,1 point,Mon Oct 13 00:44:26 2014 UTC,"Wow, very detailed. I started watching AD! around 2008, but it probably wasn't until 2010 that I began watching it religiously. I think the first episode I remember seeing was ""1600 Candles,"" and I've just been a fan ever since.  Before that, I watched Family Guy all the time and could pretty much quote anything from any episode. Nowadays, it's pretty much the opposite. It's just not a must-watch show for me anymore. The characters have just become one-dimensional shadows of their former selves, and the stories seem to get lazier and more needlessly offensive with each season. American Dad! slowly became the better series for me, even though both shows still make me laugh.  As for The Cleveland Show, I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did. Even watching reruns of it are too cringeworthy to sit through. And I'm pretty curious to see how Bordertown will do. I won't be surprised if it crashes and burns like Allen Gregory did, but we'll see."

However, as you put, reviewers also have the right to use excerpts from the medium they're reviewing, up until a point.   So the legal answer depends on how he used them. If it's an actual review, and he uses clips from the show unrelated to one another to make larger points about what he deems wrong with the show, he's probably ok. On the other hand, if his ""review"" is simply recaping what happened in the episode and showing the best parts, he's probably violating copyright.   Can't watch his video myself, but he's right that fair use trumps copyright in most cases where the infringing work is a review."

I didn't see anything off about Apu or anyone else, but I do admit that they should a little different now than they did 5-10 years ago."

familyguy,2hxm7k,Bashi_Hart,9,Wed Oct 1 01:07:51 2014 UTC,"point is, the scenes hold up on their own very well. They're well-made. Not everything in a comedy has to be comedic. The writers still need to come up with how the fight goes; it's not like they just stick it in without any forethought."

It was OK in the crossover, but kind of a cheap way to end the episode, it was really just cool to see all the Springfield references. But most of them add absolutely nothing to the plot. Normally I would love a great action scene if it weren't an animated show, but animation takes 90% of the work required for action scenes out of it."

familyguy,2ht4gl,Sparticus2,13,Fri Oct 17 06:13:05 2014 UTC,Whenrver I watch Fox sundays with people who do not watch cartoons they always say Bobs Burgers is the best.  So far 3 times all 3 have said Bobs Burgers was the funniest
familyguy,2ht4gl,bandit614,6,Tue Sep 30 01:18:25 2014 UTC,"Let's be honest here, Bob's Burgers is the best of the three. The Simpsons had their golden age and it has long since passed. Family Guy gets by mostly on shock humor and cut aways. Bob's Burgers gets by on much better writing and actually having a story told in an episode."
familyguy,2ht4gl,tharlew,0,Wed Oct 1 03:38:30 2014 UTC,Oh I agree. It needs to build up its fanbase more though. Simpsons is ending soon (I think it's the final season?) and Family Guy is just basically Adam Sandler the Animated Series at this point.

familyguy,2hs3py,Abbnostic,13,Mon Sep 29 11:46:52 2014 UTC,I don't know why they paired Mr. Burns with Stewie. Stewie hasn't been a diabolical genius in 10 seasons.

familyguy,2hs3py,BamanPiderman69,13,Mon Sep 29 16:28:00 2014 UTC,I think it's due to their tendency to use archaic phrases as well.
familyguy,2hs3py,Intanjible,13,Mon Sep 29 17:28:26 2014 UTC,I think it would've been better to pair Burns with Carter. Especially since Stewie had already been paired with Bart for the whole episode.

Events in the confidence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as pet food, toys, toothpaste and lipstick, and a ban on certain types of seafood.

It's also super trendy to feign outrage at any jokes about women. Being overly PC is so hot right now given the recent events of the NFL. Last night's jokes were some of the funniest, most cutting jokes they've ever done, especially about that woman having a sense of humor (who might as well have worked for the AV Club) and the female security guard. I think some people look to the media for that kind of commentary because it helps validates their view that they're smarter than everyone who like his shows."

familyguy,2hrysv,LartisteDaJour,6,Mon Sep 29 18:44:10 2014 UTC,"no. The appearance of Kang and Kodos implies that this was a ""Halloween special"" type of episode that happens outside the  normal continuity."

Psilocybin in particular is associated with highly positive feelings and visuals. I do know people who have had total hallucinations on acid, but still entrenched into reality. A friend saw the moon blow up. I pointed out it was the clouds moving in front of the moon. Something about the music and the moment the clouds covered the moon led him to see it blow up, but it was still a reflection of reality. I actually get annoyed with the disinformation  and misunderstanding people have of how hallucinogens actually feel and what the experience is like for the user.

familyguy,2h3ru4,Yage2006,4,Mon Sep 22 22:34:09 2014 UTC,Netflix doesn't censor it.
familyguy,2h3ru4,wyattrulesherp,2,Mon Sep 22 23:59:45 2014 UTC,"Versions you pay for (DVD, Blu-ray, Netflix) are not censored. There is plenty of swearing on Family Guy; for example Road to Germany has both 'fuck' and 'cunt' in it."

familyguy,2h1luq,Intanjible,3,Sun Sep 21 16:36:13 2014 UTC,"James Woods as mayor would be like the time on The Simpsons when Sideshow Bob became mayor.  I wonder if they could have fun with the overlapping idea.  I vote for Patrick Stewart for the new mayor, personally."
familyguy,2h1luq,NintendoNut,3,Sun Sep 21 18:20:33 2014 UTC,I agree with Patrick Stewart. He's friends with Seth MacFarlane and is a regular guest on American Dad. It could work.
familyguy,2h1luq,youtbuddcody,5,Sun Sep 21 18:24:40 2014 UTC,"And he could be completely insane, yet serious and get away with it.  Just like West."

familyguy,2gzn3d,bbplay_13,2,Sun Sep 21 12:23:00 2014 UTC,"Wait until the next day or a few hours after it aired, most likely their will be a torrent up if you know how to do that."

familyguy,2gw61q,amb1978,1 point,Fri Sep 19 21:22:48 2014 UTC,That must be what it is. Pretty sure it's the same music. It just seems so familiar from another animated show. But I'm probably just making shit up. Thanks so much!
familyguy,2gw61q,thecoral6,2,Fri Sep 19 21:24:23 2014 UTC,"The running into Peter in the garage-part is from The Simpsons. In fact, isn't it Homer (not Peter) he's running into? And Peter opens the door and says ""Who's this guy?"""
