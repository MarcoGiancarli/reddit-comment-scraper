Disneyland,3e43oq,Canadian_chicken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:02 2015 UTC,Great shot! Carthay Circle has become my wife and my favorite restaurant in California. We live in the Central Valley so we try and get there a couple times each year.
Disneyland,3e2vwj,AnubisEight,5,Tue Jul 21 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're all set for a great trip. I generally shill for Carthay Circle because it's my favorite, but I had a very good experience at River Belle Terrace on July 4th. The food wasn't gourmet, but it was still quite good and gave access to the best seating section (minus the cushion that comes with the Blue Bayou package)."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to do Blue Bayou for lunch—the transition from the midday sun to the late evening and back again just adds that much more magic to the experience for me. That and Monte Cristo. So it had to be River Belle Terrace. We haven't seen Fantasmic! or WoC, so great seating is a must."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:07 2015 UTC,"Both shows are excellent. For Fantasmic, if you think you'll mind sitting on the pavement/stones in front of Rivers of America, bring a thin blanket or the like to sit on. Oh also, is your dinner reservation in time to get the first showing? That way you can stay in one place and watch the fireworks after.  You have to stand for WoC, so just get there early, well before they tell you to arrive."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,0,Tue Jul 21 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"Does the Fantasmic! dining package section not have chairs? And yes, we'll be waiting around after the first show to see the fireworks, for sure."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:28 2015 UTC,"No chairs. For any Fantasmic viewing that's right along the Rivers of America (from the fence to the steps behind), you're sitting on your butt on the semi-cobblestone (it's mostly flat). The perk of getting the restaurant Fastpasses is that you sit in the center section instead of off to the side.  The only time they had chairs was for the dessert package they had before the whole Fastpass system was implemented."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,caustickitten,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Good to know, we'll have to pick up a comfy blanket and some butt pads. Thanks!"

Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,0,Tue Jul 21 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"They give you foam butt pads with your meal. At least, we got them with the blue bayou fantasmic package."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,inio,0,Tue Jul 21 22:50:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Blue Bayou only, we'll be doing River Belle Terrace"
Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,0,Tue Jul 21 23:10:52 2015 UTC,"Since you seem more knowledgable about this: Is there any way to get chairs for Fantasmic these days without it being a random ""magic moment""? (besides obviously the new Club 33 area)"
Disneyland,3e2vwj,Westpar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen chairs, but I'm pretty sure there must be a seated section for people who hire tour guides (plaids) to lead them around. Not on guided tours, mind you, these are private, pay-by-the-hour tours. That's who gets to use the benches set up on the Main Street Train Station platform."
Disneyland,3e2vwj,dodgepodge,0,Tue Jul 21 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, yeah, it does seem to be included in that but ... WOW, $2k-$3k minimum investment."

Please come back and post food reviews!!  Our big annual trip is middle of October and we're eye-balling Carthay Circle and Blue Bayou both for dinner or lunch.  Would love to read other's reviews of food, service, etc, etc.  Happy Honeymooning!"
Disneyland,3e2vwj,golf4miami,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"As stated above, I pretty much always shill for Carthay Circle because it's my favorite. My girlfriend and I usually go for dinner because it has an upscale ambience. Service is excellent, and while the food isn't true fine dining, it's quite good and a good deal for the World of Color package. Being in there has a real old Hollywood feel. You can even go in early and have drinks in the lounge till your table's ready.  The menu changes seasonally, but there's usually a thick cut porkchop and a NY strip steak that are both quite good. And while it's not on the menu, we usually order the house biscuits, which are deep fried and filled with cheese and bacon. 'Nuff said."

I just ate at the Nappa Rose this weekend for my 1 year anniverssary, and let me tell you, I will have beautiful, haunting dreams of that steak.  I could have also eaten my weight in the parmesan rolls they give you FOR FREE (idiots).  There's also a starter to share called the sizzling beach rock (which is a bit if an appetizer sampler), the soy glazed short ribs are like butter with a bone to hold it all together (our server told us that lots of her regulars order that with all ribs, yes they are that good)."
Disneyland,3e40iw,woltdosnoy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:59:19 2015 UTC,"I have gone a number of times in early November, sometimes even for thanksgiving. A lot has changed since you were seven! Even if you're only ten years old!   The Nightmare Before Christmas Layover is there between October and December, so it will be up. Ghost Galaxy is terrifying for me but it is a must-do if it is still there, but depending on how late you go in November, it will be regular Space Mountain again, which is still an awesome ride. The Matterhorn just got some amazing new effects, so you should definitely check those out, as well as the Peter Pan dark ride. Splash Mountain might be a little chilly, but they usually lower the water levels during the fall so you don't get /too/ wet. The Jungle Cruise will also likely have it's Jingle Cruise facade, but I forget when that goes up.   Anyway here is the list of the refurbishments going on, it doesn't look like you will be missing much!   As for snacks, the Mint Julep bar is one of my favorite places. They've got beignets and Mint Juleps which are delicious, and in the fall they have pumpkin beignets that are to die for. There will also be a lot of cool cupcakes around. Here is the Disney Food Blog. Don't forget churros, popcorn, Dole Whips, and all the other classic stuff. You'll have to research what kind of restaurant you wanna hit, but since you only have one day I think you should go for Quick Service instead of Full Service (or Table service).   Also be sure to check out the parades and the fireworks, Disney goes all out during the holidays. Hope I helped :)  Edit: thought october was in september had to fix that."
Disneyland,3e40iw,dodgepodge,0,Tue Jul 21 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about parades and fireworks? The new Paint the Night parade is pretty good, a worthy successor to the Main Street Electrical Parade, and the fireworks have some cool visual effects. However, you can really only see the animations well on the castle, on Tom Sawyer Island if you watch Fantasmic, and on It's a Small World. So if you want to enjoy either/both, you'll have to devote some time to either staking out a spot or getting a Fastpass to the first Fantasmic show. If you want to see the parade and the firework effects on both the castle and the Matterhorn, the corner of Main Street in front of the Coca Cola Refreshment Corner will work well.  As far as rides go, Star Tours has probably changed most. It was completely redone a few years ago and offers a pretty cool experience that has 54 different combinations. Haunted Mansion Holiday is also well done as far. Indiana Jones has had some minor cosmetic changes to the first sequence with Mara. Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan both have new projection effects, but the rides aren't radically different.   If you want shows, Mickey and the Magical Map is great, and Frozen storytime at the Royal Theatre is surprisingly funny."
Disneyland,3e40iw,stacasaurusrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"I personally love the chili con queso at the Cozy Cone Motel :) It's available all year round, but I find it DELICIOUS!   If you like alcoholic beverages, I personally think it's super relaxing getting a glass of wine, sitting in the shade, and watching the people pass by! Something about enjoying a cocktail (well, beer or wine only) at CA Adventure, and walking around with it, so fun :)"
Disneyland,3e45ce,stacasaurusrex,5,Tue Jul 21 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"I swear we never see any rare characters at all :/ The mad hatter is the only person I have seen that I even consider rare, and we have only seen him once."
Disneyland,3e45ce,pistolpete4407,4,Tue Jul 21 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"If you ever want to see the Mad Hatter again, he and Alice do a little routine at the Coca Cola Refreshment Corner piano. More than once I've seen them take kids and play musical chairs. Mary Poppins and Bert also stop by there to sing a few songs. Unfortunately, I don't think these visits are on any official schedules. Cast members might know if you ask."

Disneyland,3e45ce,SnarkMasterRay,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's cool. I wouldn't be surprised if they did even more with the new band. It's more like a college marching band now, so they're more mobile and seem playful in general."
Disneyland,3e45ce,dodgepodge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons I wonder id they'll do this with the new band though. I could see management going, ""the band just stands there, send out a couple of characters to liven it up!""  However, if the new band has its own energy, would they want characters out there as well? I hope they do, I just wonder.  I'll be there in September to find out!"
Disneyland,3e45ce,SnarkMasterRay,2,Tue Jul 21 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, though in my experience, none of the live acts need any help attracting a crowd. Main Street has taught me people love live music/a capella. Anyway, I'll keep an eye out."
Disneyland,3e45ce,dodgepodge,2,Tue Jul 21 22:04:38 2015 UTC,"That's actually a pretty good one! I've only ever seen him once!  I have the best story of The Mad Hatter! I saw this family taking a picture with him and I offered to do it for them all. He was grateful so after, he took me by the arm and walked me towards Main Street. My wonderful friend took the cutest video of it!"

Disneyland,3e0zr0,poprockcide,42,Wed Jul 22 01:22:02 2015 UTC,I've heard there's a sense of community in Disneyland that WDW doesn't have. Maybe because Disneyland is smaller and people aren't so hectic to get too much done in only a day.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,whitestainedress,8,Tue Jul 21 06:08:33 2015 UTC,It's the APs.  Disneyland has way more locals that visit many times per year. It leads to community but also results in cliques (the Disneyland clubs that wear biker style vests for example). The locals also take the park for granted sometimes.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,Tarzimp,6,Tue Jul 21 16:34:49 2015 UTC,The disney biker clubs are hilarious.

Disneyland,3e0zr0,chicklette,0,Tue Jul 21 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"That's too bad. As far as I can tell, Disney is all about taking certain things very seriously - guest experience, customer service, magic, fun, storytelling - but ""yourself"" is not one of them."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,TalithaRabboni,2,Wed Jul 22 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's just the APs. My only visit to WDW was in the summer, and I found there were way more college student employees than at the DLR (it's a bigger place, so it makes sense that they need more help). This ended up in a less magical experience because a shocking number of them were blase about their jobs."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,dodgepodge,29,Tue Jul 21 21:02:52 2015 UTC,"This might get real sappy? Not sure.  I was a CM at WDW for two years before moving out to my current home in Colorado. I had always thought that working for the Walt Disney Company would be a cool thing to do. Work and play in a place made for the young at heart, interact with people from all over the world, etc. I spent a lot of time in the WDW parks, both as a guest and as a CM. I love WDW, it's my second home. I have friends there that are like brothers and sisters to me. It's where I met the person who I'll marry, so it's got a very special place in my heart.   But it is not even close to what Disneyland is. Not by a long shot.   Back in 2013, my girlfriend and I (both WDWCMs at the time) planned a trip to go to the DLR. She had been numerous times before and was excited to go back. I had never been. This was my first time and I don't think I could have been more excited to see what DLR was. We were fortunate enough to stay at the Grand Californian, which was just as majestic at The Wilderness Lodge at WDW.   First off, the theming and decor of the DLR is second to none. What WDW has going for it is that it is removed from the ""real world."" It's away from the busy tourism of the greater Orlando area. When you pass through the gates you forget that you're in Orlando. You're in WDW. The DLR is able to do that while being trapped in the middle of Anaheim. Sure, when I stepped out of The Grand Cal I could see the street, but I only looked out there because it was time to go back. The resort has captured a bubble-like feel that WDW has but does so because of a superior attention to making sure you stay trapped in the DLR. Trappped in a good sense.   The Disneyland Park is undoubtedly the most special of all of the Disney Company parks. When I walked down Main St. for the first time it was a very humbling and...eerie, I guess, experience. As a CM you develop a very fond appreciation for Walt Disney, the man. His vision, his ambition, creativity, all the things that make him so revered. So a ton of feelings come to you when you walk down Main St. and see the castle. This was Walts park. This was what he dreamed of. Nearly all of the attractions in the park have his fingerprints on them. This is the original. Accept no substitutes, for what has set the standard for theme parks today. Disneyland feels like a museum to me. It was pristine and well kept. Vintage and innovative. I can't begin to describe the excitement to go on the ""REAL"" Pirates of the Caribbean.   California Adventure is what WDW should aspire to have. A place where new properties can go, and be imagined. Cars is not my favorite Pixar property, but my word is that area amazing. There isn't a single place on WDW property that can match what Carsland is. I eagerly anticipate rumored additions to CA and it's continual growth. CA has something for everyone, the thrill seeker and the young family of four.   I could go on for hours about why DLR is superior despite being such a significantly smaller park. But it comes down to Walt Disney. This was his, and that's what makes it superior. I'm going back in December and I can't contain excitement.  If that's not enough DLR has Indiana Jones. Dinosaur is hot garbage compared to Indy."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,Tchnique,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:49 2015 UTC,Indiana Jones holds such an important place in my life that I will literally go to DL over WDW because of it.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,avw94,30,Tue Jul 21 23:00:37 2015 UTC,"I agree w/ /u/RockemSockemCronuts; it's the theme park Walt Disney helped construct and walked through.  Unlike last weekend where Southern California got hit by a tropical storm, it rarely rains in Anaheim and is decently warm year-round (compared to a higher chance of rain and definitely higher humidity - UGH! That sticky weather! As well as warmer temperatures) in the Orlando summer months.  Also, the parks - Disneyland and California Adventure - are much smaller than the vast expansion that is DisneyWorld; plus, DL has more rides than its counterpart.  And, if you are tight on a budget, you can spend less time (# of days) at DL than at DW, as their parks are much bigger and take longer to explore."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,skinsballr,18,Tue Jul 21 06:29:20 2015 UTC,"I love that the parks are small enough to spend a weekend there. Even with the rising prices, I can still afford a few days at Disneyland. WDW is so big that in order to see everything I've ever wanted to see, I either need to do a lot of prioritizing or save up quite the vacation fund. (That said, I will make it out there one day.)  On the other - more whimsical - hand, Disneyland parks are quaint and cozy. It's not the monolithic, county-unto-itself entity that WDW seems to be."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,TalithaRabboni,4,Tue Jul 21 07:20:46 2015 UTC,"As someone who just spent this weekend in DLR, I do NOT want to go to WDW with weather like that and even more people.  I enjoyed my weekend, but the weather was really pushing it for me."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,XirdenStone,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from Disneyland being the original, I think size is everything. The smaller/more compact DLR is way better than the expansive, basically a city WDW. Traversing through the WDW parks is exhausting, especially with the weather, and even though it gets congested at the DLR, it's way nicer to go from one ride to another with ease.   Space is such a luxury at WDW that it feels wasted at times. I marvel at Disney's ability to fit everything in Disneyland and DCA into the space they occupy."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,dodgepodge,58,Tue Jul 21 21:09:45 2015 UTC,"It's the original, and the only park Walt walked in. Also, paper Fastpass."

Disneyland,3e0zr0,hectarpit,11,Tue Jul 21 07:12:13 2015 UTC,"Disney World's drops are random, while DCA's are predictable."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,MaLaCoiD,7,Tue Jul 21 07:14:03 2015 UTC,"Technically not random. There are drop sequences just like the single drop sequence DCA has. World's Tower has 4. The 'random' part comes from which drop sequences you're going to get. Nobody knows until you click into place in the drop shaft and Th  computer randomly assigns one to you. Go on it enough, though and I can tell you that you can memorize them too Hahaha. 2 go up first, 2 go down first, and 2 go all the way to the bottom to the unload floor to watch a small video before continuing the drop sequence again by flying back up."

Disneyland,3e0zr0,hectarpit,21,Tue Jul 21 07:23:14 2015 UTC,"That's not It! Hollywood Studios' Tower has a better queue, a better boiler room, more drop sequences (as already stated), an additional show scene where the vehicle moves forward into the 5th dimension, it has better architecture to fit both the area and the theme, it has a better voice actor (Mark Silverman) to dub over Rod Serling, and it's the original.   Edit: unlike a lot of my bellhop coworkers, I know how to correctly spell Rod's name,  but my phone doesn't ;)"
Disneyland,3e0zr0,progress_dad,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the better, more correct, answer."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,golf4miami,6,Tue Jul 21 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"It also has a much more interesting transition where you enter the twilight zone.  The random drops are so important though for repeat riders.  I get bored at DCA because my body b knows exactly what is going to happen.  At DHS, I am much more tense, because I don't know what I'm going to get.    The one advantage DCA has I'd it had 3 elevator shafts instead of 2."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,dukemetoo,5,Tue Jul 21 07:36:34 2015 UTC,"We went to WDW 2 years ago and I can say we were most pleasantly surprised by the dark ride through the Twilight Zone. Pull away from the loading doors and wait, where are we going?! Plus Rock and Rollercoaster is right there."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,few23,2,Tue Jul 21 08:04:10 2015 UTC,"Tower of Terror CM from the Disneyland Resort, here!  The main difference between the two Towers is that DLR's Tower is a ""choreographed"" dropping sequence, meaning it always drops the same number of times/same distance, so it matches up with the music.  WDW's Tower is a ""randomized"" dropping sequence, so after you go through all of the ""show"" elements, it drops a random number of times before returning to the station.  The show for both differs a tiny bit, but the story is the same.  I haven't experienced this for myself, but I've heard that the EuroDisney and Tokyo Disney Towers have completely different stories than the two resorts in the US."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,waterfox17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:56 2015 UTC,EuroDisney is the same.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,therealjuion,0,Tue Jul 21 18:53:09 2015 UTC,I think only the Tokyo one has a different story. The one in Paris is basically an exact replica of DCA's ride.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,EagleEyeInTheSky,10,Tue Jul 21 16:09:55 2015 UTC,"There are about 30 more attractions at Disneyland and DCA than at the 4 WDW parks. Because each park has only a couple thrill rides and higher attendance, lines are longer for the same rides."

Disneyland,3e0zr0,95688it,10,Tue Jul 21 08:04:57 2015 UTC,"I love both, but here's why (aside from proximity) I so far have preferred Disneyland:  you can more easily be spontaneous.   Let me explain.  In WDW, you have to book your FastPass+ items well in advance if you want a chance of getting on certain rides/character meet-n-greets.  You want to eat at Be Our Guest?  Better be on your computer as soon as your 180 days comes around so you can book it (or be willing to check back pretty much every day until you leave).  With Disneyland, for the most part, you can't book most of that in advance.  Far less stress and micromanaging of your vacation.  Go there expecting an adventure.  With WDW, you go there expecting an adventure...within the parameters you've already defined.  But you're hamstrung by your FP+ selections, unless you want to skip certain aspects."

Realistically though, you can only compare Disneyland to Magic Kingdom and not the entire set of parks because obviously World would win."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,PicklePants84,17,Tue Jul 21 07:06:04 2015 UTC,Also a side note... Everyone says World has a better castle because it's bigger but I love our little castle. I think it fits in well with the park size wise and is stunning but not overwhelming.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,PicklePants84,16,Tue Jul 21 07:08:17 2015 UTC,"DLR CM here!  I agree, our Pirates and Haunted Mansion are better.  ... but I have to hand it to WDW, I truthfully enjoyed their Space Mountain more than ours."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,waterfox17,4,Tue Jul 21 09:08:20 2015 UTC,Wait. Really? As someone who grew up going to WDW I can personally attest that the Disneyland Space Mountain is better. It's much smoother overall.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,golf4miami,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:25 2015 UTC,That's.... interesting. I've never heard anyone say that they prefer the WDW one.
Disneyland,3e0zr0,EagleEyeInTheSky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I think DL space mountain is tons better.  The loading area theme is way better, sitting side by side makes the ride more fun. The soundtrack for DL is fantastic. The ride seems faster and smoother."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,Jekyllhyde,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:26 2015 UTC,Strong disagree. Space at MK is LAME. The onboard music at Land MAKES that ride.   Edit: changed a word
Disneyland,3e0zr0,kelsey0403,0,Tue Jul 21 15:33:09 2015 UTC,I love the WDW Space Mountain too!  That one spot where you feel like you're going to fly out of your seat is thrilling!

Disneyland,3e0zr0,few23,5,Tue Jul 21 08:09:44 2015 UTC,Yeah and World doesn't have a need to get underneath the train tracks
Disneyland,3e0zr0,progress_dad,6,Tue Jul 21 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, WDW's Pirates does go underneath the train tracks. The WDW Masion doesn't, which is why the ceiling on its stretch room rises, while the floor on DL's descends. (Former WDW CM)"

Its like there is an electrical current that the moment you walk into the park you are just giddy. You just want to high five the characters. Also, lets not forget the churros that induced massive amounts of happiness."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,foxhound-mgs,4,Tue Jul 21 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"I'm currently planning a ""mini"" trip to the Magic Kingdom, in that I have exactly 1 day to hit up the Magic Kingdom.  As I read up about trips to Disneyworld, it is seriously starting to stress me out.  People usually go for 7-10 days, some even two weeks to get the full Disneyworld experience.  I just wanted to show  up to MK, get on whatever rides I could, and do the best I can, not plan it out minute by minute!  Disneyland, I don't feel that rush. (Of course, I am an AP holder, and I live a six hour drive away, not a six hour flight.)  It's fine to just show up and do as you please, plus the park is so much more pleasant to get around on a non-crowded day. I can get off Indiana Jones, see the line is 10 minutes at Star Tours, and just walk over to Tomorrowland in five minutes.  Totally different pace, and it suits me so much better."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,epotosi,6,Tue Jul 21 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"My wife and I took our two daughters (7 & 11) to DL in 2013 and WDW in 2014.  DL has the benefit of walking distance to many hotels and to DCA. WDW has a much nicer castle (opinion only lol). DL has more rides. WDW has a total of 4 parks plus two water parks.  Honestly we loved them both for different reasons, but we've decided to do our Disney thing again and March 2016 we're spending 5 days at DL. Either way they're both magical places and even as a 32 year old Australian male I am totally in love with both."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,sausagefingerscunt,2,Tue Jul 21 10:08:01 2015 UTC,"It's cheaper in that it requires a shorter trip for us. To do WDW right, in my opinion, would require somewhere around a 7-day trip because it's not a vacation that will come up once or twice a year. We can drive there in 4 hours vs. fly 5. So, convenience. Absolutely the weather. No need for vacation insurance too if we had a lot of money on the line during hurricane season in FL. Disneyland is more comfortable. It's a leisurely vacation for us. I agree with another poster who said people are more hectic at WDW. I know I would be. Better ocean and beaches.   Granted, I've only been to WDW once when I was 12, versus a ton of trips throughout childhood and into my adult years at Disneyland. Next one is on the books for October! WDW is in the rough stages of planning and will happen in the next 5 years though."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,pirategolf13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:03 2015 UTC,"Neither park is better than the other. They are both the same and yet incredibly different. Each park hosts to a completely different type of user and each has their own special magic.  Disneyland  It is smaller and more intimate. Easier to walk from location to location. Weather is almost always amazing. There are subtle details throughout the park that no other park has, even Walt Disney World. The food is reasonable and pretty good, even for quick service. Generally speaking, on any given day over 50% of the park visitors are annual pass holders and know the park fairly well.   Walt Disney World  You are transported to a completely new world. To get to the park you must take a monorail or boat (er, mostly). It is larger and can hold a lot more people. Because it is larger the landscaping in certain areas can be better or allow for in-park picnics. Since the weather generally includes rain, the queues are indoors and very, very well themed all the way through. It is like the queue for Indiana Jones in Disneyland, but on every ride! Generally speaking, on any given day 70% of visitors are  there for their first time and have a sense of awe and wonder about them.   So in conclusion, if you forced me to pick a park I'm not sure I could! I love them both just in different ways. Besides, the correct answer is Epcot anyhow ;)"

Disneyland,3e0zr0,marryanowl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"My friend and I had this debate with a few WDWCMs when we were there last summer! A few points we made:   The weather Everything closer together  Longer, more complete rides (Pirates, Small World) Walt built it and it's the only park he stepped foot in Indy An awesome, fast outdoor coaster in CA Screaming  Far superior Space Mountain   Some of the points they made:   Yeah, you got us there You can ride more rides because they're shorter Yeah but we have SO MUCH MORE We have the Indy stunt show! Rockin Roller Coaster in indoor and has BLACKLIGHTS What?   (None of them had been to Disneyland)  While I absolutely LOVED my trip to WDW and want to go back oh-so-badly, DLR will always have a special place in my heart. There's just something special about walking through those gates and leaving the real world and all of my responsibilities behind.   Edit: Fixed, as I was on mobile so the formatting got real weird real quick."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,kelsey0403,0,Tue Jul 21 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"When I went to WDW in Nov. 2014 and April 2015, I was SHOCKED at the amount of guests we encountered who said ""I have no interest in going to DL."" I convinced a fair amount of them to give it a try.   Although WDW is great and unique in its own way. DL is Walt's original vision. His dream. It's charming, quaint, perfect in almost every way.   My husband loves WDW because it is open and feels less crowded. However, the open spaces aren't packed in with as much theming and detail as DL. Even the tiniest little corners of DL have ornate details that WDW just doesn't have.  Some of the rides at WDW are more interesting (TOT, RNR, Spaceship Earth, etc.) but the copycat rides are real missed opportunities. For example, at DL the HM needs to have the stretching room so that we can go underneath the railroad tracks. At WDW, they could have done something else besides a stretching room - they don't need an elevator, but they have a stretching room because DL's does - why not use that space for something different and new?   Also, it seems like the CMs at DL are happier/more willing to make magic than WDW CMs. For our April visit, I mistakenly connected our park tickets in the incorrect order on the MyMagic website, (we had a 1 day parkhopper, and 1 day MK only ticket - I didn't even know that order of connecting tickets mattered), and we ended up using the tickets out of order on accident, but only for one member of our party. I tried to explain that I truly didn't know and everyone except my wheelchair-bound grandmother was able to get into Hollywood Studios on day 2 of our trip after spending time at MK. We had only gone to MK the previous day but the system counted the parkhopper ticket as the one we had used that day instead of the 1-day MK only ticket. The CMs were incredibly rude and tried to blame me for the honest mistake. They even went online and saw that we had only entered one park the previous day, saw that I had connected MK-only as well as parkhopper tickets, and continued to say that it was too bad, my fault. After about 30 minutes of convincing them I didn't know and that the rest of our party was waiting in the park for us, they finally realized I wasn't trying to rip off the company and that I had made an honest mistake and let me wheel my grandmother in through the gates. No smiles, no apologies, no ""enjoy your day"" attitude. They were mad at me. I couldn't believe it. Other WDW CMs I encountered on those trips were just kind of ""ho-humming"" through their day. I didn't notice anybody really go out of the way for us, despite us being there in April to celebrate my grandmother's birthday and my grandparents' 55th wedding anniversary.  On the other hand, one of my co-workers was telling me that his GF & her niece didn't realize their APs were blocked one day at DL, but the CM pulled them aside, let them in anyways, and told them to have a magical visit. On my last visit, I encountered a custodial CM serenade a guest opera-style for their birthday, down on one knee and everything. It just seems like the level of service at DL is a bit higher than at WDW. I don't know, maybe it was just my experiences - I'm sure there are great WDW at CMs but so far I have yet to really experience it."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,carolinejay,0,Tue Jul 21 17:28:44 2015 UTC,"They are different. Which one is better for an individual comes down to what they are looking for in a visit.  California packs a ton of great attractions into a relatively small area.  You can see everything easily.  There are affordable hotels within walking distance.  DL has a certain charm that the MK doesn't.  Orlando is a true resort.  There is a far greater selection of restaurants.  You can stay in a Disney hotel without breaking the bank.  You can enjoy being immersed in the magic. Even taking a bus to the parks is more magical than walking from the Super 8 down the street.  I love spending time just walking the grounds of a resort (love Coronado Springs for this).  While attraction count is about the same, four parks means more variety. Epcot and AK offer unique experiences you'll never get in Anaheim."
Disneyland,3e0zr0,Pleakley,0,Tue Jul 21 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"I believe the smaller size of the DLR makes it superior because it's easier to traverse and adds to the quaintness, but that's been well discussed in this thread. What I have to add is location.  WDW is basically a city (Reedy Creek Improvement District). When you go, you're literally in a world of Disney, and the only times you leave that world is if you stay off-property or go to Universal to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Disneyland is right smack dab in the middle of a suburban, almost urban environment. As such, it's especially impressive how the park was designed such that you see no signs of the outside world while you're in the parks. Try to look for the tops of nearby hotels or the like. You won't see anything. You've stepped through the looking glass (maybe named Ball or Harbor or Katella) into a world of fantasy. It's especially impressive when you look at the parks from the 5 freeway. The Matterhorn, Space Mountain, and Tower of Terror are surprisingly small, and you can hardly see anything else. DLR has been crafted to be both quaint and impressive in a confined space, and it doesn't feel like this same precision was used with WDW because they didn't have to.   One thing I must admit, though, is that the Tree of Life in Animal Kingdom blew/blows my mind. Space definitely has its perks."

Disneyland,3e1100,WardenHDresden,7,Tue Jul 21 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"1: PhotoPass is a system where you can have your picture taken any number of times, any where you can find/drag a photographer, for free.  The photos are tied to a park ticket, so make sure and use the same ticket whenever you get your picture taken.  What costs money is getting prints and digital copies.  The voucher is used to pay for prints at any of the printing locations (e.g. The camera shop at the end of Main Street).  I think you may be able to review and order prints online as well.  2: no clue. Characters scare the bejesus out of my kid so we sick to Steakhouse 55 and Whitewater Snacks in the morning (both really under appreciated on-property breakfasts). You definitely won't find photogs at either of those ;).  If you're staying at GC, Whitewater to-go is a great way to have a roomservice-like experience on the cheap (but you're staying at Le Grande so ""on the cheap"" is a silly phrase to use). Sorry, got a bit distracted there...  3: the value of stroller swap varies greatly with the makeup of your party, their relative patience levels, and their ability to have fun away from the group.  If you have older kid(s) that like rides the youngsters can't do, stroller swap gives you a way to either get them on without the line (the SS token is good for up to 6 guests IIRC ) or get them on twice, once with each parent (wait through the line with dad, walk in the exit/fastpass entrance with mom using SS).  If you're just parents + one kid, stroller swap can be a bit of a lonely/empty experience IMHO.  4: For two parents and one kid, single rider is great if one parent wants to go on the ride and the other doesn't.  Alternately for some rides with very high standby/single rider ratios (Indy, usually) single rider can beat stroller swap.  For cars I think the single rider line is rarely less than half the standby time, so stroller swap is a better bet.  Single rider is only available on a small number of rides (Indy, Cars, and Soarin' are the only that come to mind)"

Disneyland,3e1100,billypowergamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:02 2015 UTC,"There's no watermarking when you download them, it sends you a zip file that includes a licensing document for the photo (not for commercial use, etc) but the photos themselves don't have anything on them, unless you want to add things like boarders which you can do when you are reviewing them online."

I think its more that they give you 14 days to use the photopass and it's how many you can fit in in that amount of time."
Disneyland,3e1100,pirategolf13,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:28 2015 UTC,My fiancee and I did Photopass+ for our last trip to WDW. A week long trip where I proposed. We were mailed a CD with over 150 pictures on it after we got home. I know people who have spent a longer time in the parks and had two CDs worth of pictures mailed. You pay one price up front and you get all those pictures and the release mailed to you afterwards. No limit.

Disneyland,3e1100,gigabyte898,0,Tue Jul 21 17:21:10 2015 UTC,I have gotten the pass in the past. It is great! If you buy it online ahead of time (at least 3 weeks) it is less expensive. You get all of your photo's and when you get home you order your DVD of the photo's which is free.
Disneyland,3e1100,LibraryLass,3,Tue Jul 21 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"Annual passholder for 5 years. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can.  1)When you get a picture taken by any of the disney photographers they scan your ticket and you are enrolled in the photopass program. You can take your pass to the photo shops (Kodak photo corner on main street or photo shop in CA adventure by the lockers) and buy the pictures. On rides whenever you buy a print you get a separate photopass card. You can either go to the shops OR go online to the URL on the back of the card to view/download them. The code expires after a set amount of time, so if you get one make sure to pull it up online when you get back to the hotel! AFAIK there are no stores in Downtown Disney that can pull up the pictures for you, but photopass does work at all Disney affiliated character diners (Goofy's Kitchen, Storybook Cafe, etc). You will need to go to the aforementioned photo shops if you would like to purchase a print though.  2)There are photographers roaming around and following characters at all Disney Diners. At Goofy's Kitchen there is a mock kitchen near the check in desk where you can pose for a picture with Goofy. They are sold in the restaurant along with any other pictures taken there with some of ""Goofy's favorite recipes"" in a nice folder.   3)Don't have too much experience with ride swap, but I've noticed people are ditching it in favor of the single rider lines. See answer 4  4)On single rider eligible rides you walk up to the single rider entrance and you are given a card. You walk to the part where fastpass and standby merges and someone will take the card and usher you through to the next portion of the line. Like Fastpass, single rider does not bypass the entire line, but the longer portions outside (eg: the line before you enter the haunted mansion, the lines on cars before you go up the ramp, and the lines on the roof of space mountain.) It's basically a fastpass. The basic concept is it is when cast members load an uneven amount of people into a vehicle they take someone from single rider to fill in the remaining seats. It balances the cars out and is more efficient than sending a half filled one through. The downside to this is you are often separated from who you are with. You might get in the same ride vehicle if you are lucky, but you never sit next to each other. I'd do this in favor of child swap. The longest I've waited in single rider was 15 minutes for RSR when the line was 175 min.   If you have anymore questions feel free to ask! Bonus fact: Disney if is filled with stray animals (That are made sure don't make contact with guests, of course). If you are staying at the Disneyland Hotel look for cats early in the morning too. Disney keeps stray cats on property as pest control (you can see a cat house next to the Hungry Bear restaurant on the train ride if you look closely. It's it wooden box with some mesh on the front and a little door) and you have the most luck seeing them at the Disneyland resort. There's a really friendly grey striped one that will walk up to you and let you pet it, but don't go around chasing cats if they don't come to you first. One last thing, DO NOT TRY TO PET THE DUCKS/GEESE. Those ducks were not brought on property by disney, but stay there because they add to the ambiance. They tend to keep to their own, but occasionally one of those spawns of satan will nip at a kid who pulls it's feathers a little too much. Disney is pretty good at keeping them behind the fences.  Exerpt from an interview with a former cast member about the stray animals:   Backstage at Disneyland is like its own ecosystem. There are so many stray cats. We have no idea where they all came from. The popular rumor is that a bunch of cats were brought in back in the 70s to kill mice, and now we have five generations of cat families running around because nobody ever bothered to bring the cats out of deep cover, sort of like Donnie Brasco.  Then there are the ducks and the geese! At any given moment, we are swarmed with waterfowl, and like the cats, nobody has any idea how they all got here. We have entire family lines of ducks that have never known life outside of Disneyland. The guests just assume they're part of some show or are otherwise here on purpose, and happily feed them scraps of food like they're part of the Magic Kingdom experience.  If a cat gets onstage, we've got to keep them from getting close to the guests for obvious reasons -- getting clawed by a stray cat at Disneyland is a good way to get some kind of terrible infection and a great way to get Disney in a shitload of trouble. But believe it or not, the geese are the real threats. If you've never been around geese, they're kind of dangerous. They're extremely territorial, they hiss, they bite, and they will chase you while hissing at you and biting you. But like I said, most guests just assume the geese are supposed to be there, and by extension, they must be totally safe as far as wild animals go. So they'll let their kids run around with the geese and try to pet them, completely oblivious to the fact that these birds (which are the same size as some of the kids trying to pet them) will totally bite the sh*t out of a person for absolutely no reason.  It's our job to keep the geese away from the guests. I'll usually say something like, ""Listen folks, these are dangerous creatures, please give them some space!"" in my best imitation of a jungle tour guide. The guests think it's a joke, even though I'm absolutely not kidding."

Here's another trivia item to look for in line:  Before the ride was built it used to be on land that was used for the Eyore parking lot. When the parking structure was demolished to make way for the ride some of the imagineers took a sign that indicated what lot it was from the entrance. You can see it behind the projector in the room where they show the safety video"
Disneyland,3e1100,billypowergamer,0,Tue Jul 21 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Luckily they're pretty easy to translate. Most of them look pretty much like the letter they correspond to, except I which looks like an eye. You can probably find a picture of the card online if you seek it out though."

Its either do the baby swap or choose to the single rider? It just sounds like single rider is a much faster route to me for most rides right?
Disneyland,3e1100,MeishkaD,0,Tue Jul 21 19:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are 2 different systems"
Disneyland,3e1100,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Rider swap works if you have multiple kids to entertain.  One parent would take the kids that are tall enough for the ride through the line (most likely long) while the other takes the toddler around. Then once the parent and kids get through the line and attraction, the other parent gets to go through the fast pass ( usually with the kids again, so they can ride twice amd the parent that babysat wont have to ride alone).   Ask for the rider swap from the cast member at the entrance of the attraction."
Disneyland,3e1100,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:28:24 2015 UTC,3) Rider swap is well worth it. One person waits the whole line. The other either waits the fast pass line or goes in through the exit for little to no wait. Highly recommend.
Disneyland,3e1100,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:51:21 2015 UTC,"The first person doesn't even have to wait the whole line. If they got a fast pass beforehand and they ask for riderswap on the platform they'll still give it to you, even if the person they're swapping with didn't get a fast pass."

Disneyland,3dzvn1,StephieCupcakes,5,Tue Jul 21 03:59:43 2015 UTC,No. I agree. Star Tours is great but it's more than sufficient.

Star Tours in TomorrowLand I was OK with, but Tomorrowland could very well focus on futuristic things again the way it used to.

Disneyland,3dysuy,jax09,18,Mon Jul 20 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"After the elevator doors close, your car moves backwards away from the door. Then there's two show sequences on separate floors. There's a point where the characters in the show board an elevator at the end of a hallway and their elevator will drop. About half a second after they fall, you'll fall.  The ride starts with two short two story drops just as a tease. Then you'll rise to the top of the tower and the doors will open to the outside. They'll take a picture, you'll drop two stories, then do a bigger drop and then the ride starts to go into the most intense element. The car will shoot upwards and start braking in order to make you rise out of your seat and feel like you're still falling. (The lights are off so you don't know) Then as you're rising out of your seat, the lights turn on to show you're actually rising before momentarily stopping before falling again. You get about two seconds of hang time from this. Then the ride will rise to the top of the tower again, open the doors a second time, shudder a bit, then you fall all the way down the shaft. Then the ride is over.  Most of the ride is in complete darkness but they will flash the lights every now and again.  The drops are actually quicker than the Splash or Pirates drops, but the Splash and Pirates drops don't have actual hang time. On the Tower of Terror, you'll rise out of your seat and tug against your seat belt. The best comparison I can make is the top of the first hill on California Screamin', where you also rise out of your seat, but you haven't been on that either.  The important thing to remember is that it's not a huge drop like a traditional drop tower. It's not like the Maliboomer or Supreme Scream. It's a bunch of short drops and shudders."

I don't really feel the drop. I just feel a few moments of suspension and that is it. My boyfriend was absolutely terrified about going in. He hates drop rides. But once he got to ride it once, he loved it and got on it twice again. I like to think of it as a really scary jellyfish ride. I suggest you try it out. It might surprise you."

Disneyland,3dysuy,mwriteword,7,Mon Jul 20 21:13:13 2015 UTC,"I hate roller coasters and thrill rides like that, but I love Disneyland rides and can tolerate some of them just enough so they're enjoyable.  If I can remember correctly, it starts with some story where it moves very fast to a couple levels higher, then does a baby drop to the bottom to whet your appetite. Then they bring you to the very very top, very fast, and open the doors so you can see the park/take an embarrassingly frightened picture of you. After maybe 3-5 seconds, you drop back about half way very fast, then go up about 3/4 of the way, then drop an equal amount as the first. This happens 2-4 times, I can't really remember. Then, the finale, where they bring you back to the very top and drop you all the way down.  If I were to describe the drops, they're very very fast. so if you can imagine the big Splash Mountain drop being broken up into short drops, it's a lot like that. Though, Splash Mountain and similar drops very much push you back, the obvious physics of Tower of Terror make you go up. To me, it feels like I'm literally being pulled by my head from my waist. You're very much pushing against your seat belt/holding onto the handles for dear life. I wouldn't compare it to the drops in Pirates and Radiator Springs, just because they're very minor compared to ToT.   In terms of fear and intimidation, I think the story/experience/anticipation is much creepier and scarier than the ride itself. I try to avoid ToT, if possible (someones the people I go with MUST ride it), just out of sheer discomfort.   While I much prefer California Screamin' or Space Mountain, because it feels more like movement and thrill, ToT is mostly just discomfort for me. But I will say it's probably worth doing at least once, just so you know."
Disneyland,3dysuy,billypowergamer,2,Mon Jul 20 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's super helpful. I do really want to try it just to experience it at least once, but I'm still unsure about the drops. The fact that they are really fast drops is somewhat comforting. The slow, prolonged drops are what I would definitely avoid."
Disneyland,3dysuy,mwriteword,4,Mon Jul 20 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this helps, but in the middle of the drops there's one that is a kind of ""hangtime"" drop.  You'll go back up to the top but it doesn't actually stop, you just kind of hang in the air for a split second and then drop again.  I mention it because it does give that zero g's type felling and I know for some people that's worse then the drop itself.    If it makes you feel any better my 6 year old son was unsure of the ride when we went back in march, after the first time through we redid it about 10 more times at his request.  Some of the people we ran into while we were loading on to the ride seemed nervous, but they started laughing when my son would say to them he had already been on it 3 or 4 times in a row, and none of them seemed unhappy when we got off."

Disneyland,3dysuy,CaffiendCA,2,Mon Jul 20 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"I can't really describe the drop sequence any better than anyone else has already outlined, but I can say that something that has comforted quite a few folks I've ridden with is the fact that - aside from when the panels open for the photo - the ride is enclosed. It's not an open drop like Splash Mountain is, where you can see where you're headed and see how high up you are. If you close your eyes for the photo, you're pretty much in the dark the entirety of the drops, and because you're only going up and down, you can pretty much feel out what's going to happen.   If you don't like drops, a ride that is primarily drops likely won't be your favorite. But, the theming is well worth putting your fears aside at least once, Twilight Zone fan or not. If you get up to the elevator and decide against it, you can always turn around and exit the ride.  I hope you decide to ride and have a blast! Enjoy your trip :)"
Disneyland,3dysuy,rollerGhoster,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"The drops last like 1-2 seconds tops. It's the anticipation that gets you hyped up because you don't know when it's going to happen! Most people are laughing hard because the drops are so sudden and quick. There's usually one ""big"" drop then it's over. I love that ride; I'm the one who keeps my hands up the entire time.   It's hard to compare it to Pirates or Splash Mountain since it's a 90 degree straight down deal. Splash Mountain's drop is definitely ""longer"" so to speak."

You ascend (a little quickly) to a show scene. After, you ascend to another show scene (depending on which elevator you board you might move downward to the next show scene). Once that second scene is over theres a tiny fast drop, and then another fast tiny drop. Then it speeds all the way to the top for a view and a picture. Then theres a little fake drop and then a long drop to the bottom. Then it shoots up and drops back again and thats the drop where you definitely float off your seat for a couple of seconds. Then it shoots all the way up again for a view and a final long drop. Thats it. So like 3 baby drops and 3 longer drops."
Disneyland,3dysuy,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:41 2015 UTC,The seatbelt in ToT helps. I used to find Splash Mountain a bit scarier because of the flume style ride with no seatbelts.   The ride isn't that bad at all.
Disneyland,3dysuy,IXGhOsTX1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Question about Splash Mountain, how intense is the drop on that ride? Only ride I have been on that is similar was Jurassic Park ride at Universal Studios and that drop was way to steep and intense for me."
Disneyland,3dysuy,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:32 2015 UTC,Really? The drop on JP is what gives me the confidence to attempt splash mountain. SM looks much higher up to me so...  But JP I just love the theme so much that the drop if part of it to me. And seeing how much fun I have on it let's me attempt others.  The only bad thing is that using it as my frame of reference makes splash mountain actually look a bit more intimidating even though the theme is a lot less than JP
Disneyland,3dysuy,AnubisEight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:26 2015 UTC,From googling JP is a 84 ft drop where as Splash Mountain is 50 ft drop.... I know since I have taken on JP I can take on Splash Mountain but I always get nervous when I see the drop.
Disneyland,3dysuy,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:24:43 2015 UTC,NO!   I'm braver than I thought then haha  Yeah don't worry then man or woman! If we both faced JP then a cheerful SM will be fineright?  I agree though. At least with JP I can stare down the Rex and drop. With splash mountain its all drop. However now that I know JP is almost twice as high then we got this!
Disneyland,3dysuy,SurreptitiouslySexy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:41 2015 UTC,"I went on Jurassic Park last summer. I had only just conquered my Splash Mountain fear the previous year, so I was a little nervous—but I watched a PoV video of the JP drop on YouTube and it didn't seem that much worse than Splash. So off to JP I went with my sister-in-law and 8 year old nephew. The boat meandered through the attraction slowly, I felt confident; ""I got this, just like Splash, no big deal,"" I told myself.  We reach the final hill climb before the turn and drop. I thought to myself, ""man, this climb is a bit longer than I remembered it being from YouTube... it's probably OK, the Splash climb seems pretty intimidating, too."" I tell you, though, when we reached the precipice, I didn't even see the T-Rex, all I could do was look down. Look down and think, ""Oh... oh shit.""  Long story short, JP's drop dwarfs Splash's.  With all the comments on this post, though, it's making me think I'm ready to have a go at Tower of Terror. It's an attraction I would have never imagined myself going on, but now I feel like maybe I can handle it."
Disneyland,3dysuy,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:46 2015 UTC,Brother!!  Great story man! I watch POVs of rides too hahaha I can definitely relate. Big mistake looking down you fool!!  I know I'll do the same on splash tho..  Most definitely! We can do it! I love the theme for ToT too so should be easy haha ha
Disneyland,3dysuy,PanifexMaximus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:33 2015 UTC,"Hi, I was afraid to ride this as a child, around 14 or 15 years old. It is a very intense experience. I know this now because I am 27 years old and decided that even if this ride was the last moments of my life, I was pretty mad at myself for not just enjoying it like so many others. I got on and the atmosphere is incredible. The anticipation is intense and the haunted hotel effect is x10 cooler because of the ride you are about to get on.  You board a large multiseat platform and tighten your seatbelt as much as possible. The ride begins and the sensations are incredible. I am a really big guy so I think I feel more gravity in effect but I had a very fun time on this ride. I cant recommend it enough.  Be sure to tighten that seatbelt as much as you can. Its very ok to be scared about this ride! Thats the point! Have fun!!!"
Disneyland,3dysuy,Beepbop139,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"You've gotten some great descriptions of the drop sequence.   I don't like thrill rides, but I ride tower of Terror multiple times on each trip.  I didn't think I would like it, but that weightless feeling is so fun, but only a split second.   Splash is much scarier to me, I ride for the scenery, and I white knuckle and close my eyes for the drop.  I think the difference for me is the forward momentum, no seat belts, and being out in the open.  None of that in ToT so I never feel unsafe.   And my favorite, 99% of all the elevator cars I've been in include a lot of screaming during the ride, but as we move forward back to the elevator doors at the end all you can hear is hysterical laughing. I love that."
Disneyland,3dysuy,waterfox17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:54:29 2015 UTC,"I encourage you to give them both a try. California Screamin' ties Rock'n'Rollercoaster as my favorite Disney coaster, and it's very smooth. It took effect a long time to warm up to Tower (the WDW one scared the bejesus out of me when I was like 12 and I was gun shy for a long time) but I love it now."
Disneyland,3dysuy,AnubisEight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:18 2015 UTC,I strongly recommend trying it! Tower of terror was the one ride at Disney that I was absolutely terrified of trying but me and my friend made a deal that if she went to on California screaming we would go on tower of terror. I was flipping out the entire time but the second I got off I wanted right back on. Turned out to be my favourite ride there!

Disneyland,3dysuy,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:11:29 2015 UTC,Is it sure to be a terror-ific visit?
Disneyland,3dysuy,heatandsummer,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting that Tower of Terror isn't strictly speaking a ""drop ride."" The reason the tower sticks out on either side at the top is because there are 3 4,000hp electric motors up there that not only pull the elevator up, but also force it down faster than gravity can pull it down. So, you're not technically dropping, you're actually being thrown down."
Disneyland,3dysuy,VersaceTupperware,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:58 2015 UTC,It drops a few times. You are never in any danger.
Disneyland,3dysuy,celosia89,0,Mon Jul 20 18:01:57 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, I was in the same place as far as ToT and Screamin'. I finally got the courage to ride them both and I really loved it. My two cents... don't ride them repeatedly. When we go, the park is always pretty slow so we would just ride them over and over - fun for all rides but these two (for me). Always makes me feel nauseated for awhile."

Disneyland,3dwx1m,golf4miami,4,Tue Jul 21 01:02:15 2015 UTC,He didn't want you because you were far away or because you were working on the ride at the time? If you've retired from the park I don't see why he wouldn't want you now. They have blown up since you tried to get on.

She was super sweet, and I wish I remembered her name to compliment at guest services.   This also worked for my friends who didn't have passes.

With the party ticket you can get in 3 hours before the event. I like it because most people who go have kids and they end up going for the few candy leaving rides with shorter lines. There is also a limited amount of people so I don't worry about crowds. There is still a fireworks show and parade, I don't get a whole day, but 8 hours for 63 bucks (early October week day date) isn't too bad.

Disneyland,3dv6al,laikapet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:27 2015 UTC,I will be in Florida when this starts. Does my normal admission ticket for my 2 week stay allow me into the park but not into the special Halloween stuff? Or do you have to buy one of the Halloween tickets to get in on those days?
Disneyland,3dv6al,Kimderella,3,Sun Jul 19 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"It's a separate, ticketed event, so another ticket would be required."
Disneyland,3dv6al,laikapet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:48 2015 UTC,My Disney ticket is supposed to last from Sep 3rd - Sep 17th. So does that mean it's going to be invalid from the 11th when the Halloween stuff starts? Because we've paid for a 2 week ticket.
Disneyland,3dv6al,Kimderella,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"It's not invalid, just the park (Disneyland in CA, and Magic Kingdom in FL) close early ( 6 or 7 depending on park hours ) for anyone who did not purchase a ticket for the Halloween party event."

I really wish they'd do a better job with smoking sections in the park.  They're so open and exposed now, which I hate, and so few and far between that I'm noticing more and more people smoking in on-smoking areas, or worse, people vaping all over the place.  Sorry for the side rant - it was a big disappointment to me."
Disneyland,3dv6al,southlandradar,10,Mon Jul 20 02:34:00 2015 UTC,You're really lucky they allow smoking in the park at all. I don't think it will be long before it's completely phased out.
Disneyland,3dv6al,chicklette,-5,Mon Jul 20 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"That's only going to encourage less conscientious people to sneak smokes everywhere rather than giving them a space where they can do it away from non-smokers.

Disneyland,3dulhs,BeriAlpha,9,Mon Jul 20 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"Good, that's how they need to be: 100% consistent enforcement. If CMs can pick and choose which sticks they take, then everyone will want special treatment."
Disneyland,3dulhs,rextraverse,18,Mon Jul 20 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"(cough Chinese cough)   As a fluent non-native Mandarin speaker, I can pretty much attest that these mainland Chinese (overseas Chinese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kongers would like to apologize for this behavior and point out that this shit pisses us off just as much as it does everyone else) tourists most certainly understand the rules and (at the very least) the gist of what's being told to them, they're just playing stupid.  Unfortunately, the fact is this tactic works and no amount of polite pressuring by the CMs is going to change this behavior or make them follow the rules.  I have on one occasion confronted a mainland Chinese family for cutting the line for something at DCA - not sure, but I think it was one of those Frozen World of Color Preview shows from a couple years ago - in Mandarin after they ignored other guests calling them out in English and played stupid to a CM.  Pretty much embarrassed/shamed the adults enough for them to finally get out of the line.  It sucks to have to be an asshole at DL and I certainly don't mean to stereotype all mainland Chinese visitors, but this is an issue that doesn't need to be tip-toed around out of fear of being racist either.  There are scenarios where, out of respect for everyone else who's following the rules, the CMs need to be able to be able to use an iron fist instead of handling everything with Mickey gloves and a winning smile."

There's tons of people who dress up and make it really awesome and they have all the Disney characters (most of them) out and you get to take pictures with them. If you don't feel like running all the way you def don't have to. The 5k is super fun in just soaking it all in and the atmosphere. Years ago when I told my family I'd end up running the whole thing, I ended up regretting it because they all ended up getting pictures with characters without me, so unless you want to run the whole thing I'd say just enjoy the fun. It's also good to be nervous :P. Lots of people are always nervous but it quickly turns in excitement as the countdown begins and you get to run through Disneyland, having people cheer you on :). The main thing I just wanted to say through all of this, is just have an awesome time and you'll do great!"

Disneyland,3dyoud,thatcaveman,5,Tue Jul 21 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"You can tell 2 things by this article:  1) The author is not a Disney fan (in the sense that Disneyland is just a theme park to the author and not someplace truly special).  2) The title was pure clickbait.   I don't disagree that some of the rides listed are some of my least favorites but honestly I don't think any of them should be removed (although I have special thoughts about toon town).   I'm not a fan of small world but it holds a special place in history and should stay as a result, Dumbo while not a ton of fun for adults is from 1955 (although it did open in October so it's not an ""opening day"" attraction). King Arthur's Carousel can't go anywhere... Walt got the idea while watching his daughters at the Grifith Park Carousel so it seems fitting that a carousel is at the heart of the park. Finding Nemo... I'll be honest and say I haven't been on it since well before the change to Nemo from 20,000 so I don't really have an opinion on this one.   That leaves ToonTown.... That part of the park has a super special place in my heart. When I was growing up I went to Disneyland for the first time when I was 7 (1996) and this was the height of ""The Disney Afternoon"". Everyday I'd go home and watch Bonkers, Goof Troop, Darkwing Duck, Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers, and Tail Spin. When I got to DLP Toon Town was the best part of the park for 7 year old me because it was where all of my afternoon friends lived.   Today it's a shell of it's former self and needs some major TLC but it should stay in my opinion. It should be updated with newer Disney toons (maybe even replace some of it to make room). I could totally see Phineas and Ferb having a home there, what about Sofia the First? As much as it would make me sad to see it go I think Gadget's Go Coaster could be rethemed to something a little more contemporary (since kids today probably don't even know who Gadget is).    Anyway, the article was obvious clickbait and missed the mark on every count if you ask me!"
Disneyland,3dyoud,Shatteredreality,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"I once came across a discussion about Disneyland where someone made the point that part of what makes it special is that there is something representative of all our childhoods to be found in the park. Whether it's the movies and characters we loved or park specific attractions there is nostalgia for all. I think it would sad to see all of ToonTown disappear as it really fits that for children of the nineties. I think your idea of sprucing it up with some current kid favorites would be perfection.   The coaster is still a popular attraction, but a couple of the houses have seen far better times. Maybe re-theme Mickey's house to the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, shift Minnie's house to her Bowtique. Goofy's house and the treehouse should be completely replaced with newer attractions. Phineas and Fern would work well here. Plenty of options that would allow the theme to shift while still allowing for some of the some of the older attractions to remain."

The Sherman Brothers are my favorite Disney composers and Mary Blair is my favorite Disney artist, and although there is always a point where I want it to be over, I love It's A Small World as well, and seeing my daughter looking wonderously, excitedly pointing out the things she was noticing, that's priceless.   The author is voting to remove Dumbo, which always has a line and provides enjoyments for adults and kids but Innoventions doesn't get a mention? pft!"
Disneyland,3dyoud,IAmMikki,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate Smallworld, it's a part of Disney history and has a special place in a lot of people's hearts. I don't think they'll ever remove it, and they shouldn't.   I don't think many people would be upset at them removing toontown, or even renovating the Small World area so there's not so much empty space.   I wouldn't be upset at all, however, if they removed Autopia or Innoventions. Innoventions has always been a terrible waste of space. The only reason people go in there is to get out of the heat in the summer."

She ended up being okay but while the nurse was testing her reactions and functions she mentioned we were trying to get to California Screaming before the line got long. Because it was a head injury the nurse made us promise not to ride until 3pm and only if she had no further symptoms. She gave her one of those to skip the line when we were sure she was okay. They are good for a party of 6! Only my 3 kids wanted to ride but they saved an hour in line. That's how we got one."

Disneyland,3drpbe,TheOnlyBongo,7,Sat Jul 18 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"Just for curiosity's sake, I watched both the new Disneyland band video as well as re watched the old Disneyland Band's final performance as a comparison.  This video and a video of their final performance. I will say that I actually do like both of them because both of them have their own musical flair that makes them distinct and different. The old Disneyland band is very much a classical band as one may think. With a very steady marching beat very reminiscent of musicians of old such as John Philip Sousa where the musical notes flow into the next note and has smooth transitions. Even when they get into their jazzy ruts it has a sense of swing jazz where, once again, each note flows into the next. Not forgetting to mention what they lacked in choreographed movement they made up for in their musical prowess and knowledge, and it showed in how the entire band comes together as a whole.  The new band they have is something different. First off and foremost the most striking difference is the tone of music. Listen to the old band and hear how it's almost like an orchestrated performance without the strings. Very long sweeping movements and the like. The new band is something akin to a jazz band playing on a street corner. Very precise notes, hitting each one and then ending it abruptly. Also quite obviously they have much more choreographed fare much like a high school marching band would do. Now I am not knocking down points for that either. Playing an instrument is hard enough on its own, but adding movement of both the legs and body while playing the right notes in tune is not an easy feat.  There is one difference that saddens me in the loss. If you listen to the old Disneyland Band you can hear them play both Disney music as well as classic band pieces of the early 1900's. The new band from what I've heard so far is just pure Disney music fluff. Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing as I too liked it when the band played my favorite tunes, but it's just missing something if that's all they play.  Overall? I both welcome the new band with open arms while lamenting upon the fact that the old band is long gone. I just wish there would have been some sort of middle compromised ground to keep them both. Like have the old and new bands in a pattern throughout the day for their showtimes. Old, new, old, new, etc. Then the following day reverse it so it's New, old, new old... Keep the old while injecting the new. But what is done is done and all we can do is sit back and watch."
Disneyland,3drpbe,OrangeL,2,Sat Jul 18 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think a better comparison is the old band represented the military or community band of the era Main Street represents, which is akin to the Music Man band. It's a normal ""band"" from those times, rather than an ensemble or orchestra. This new band is stock interpretation of the modern marching band, with its DCI-like punchy brass and entire lack of upper woodwinds (which take with them the classic finesse). I find it interesting that they're so similar to the All-American College Band, as it just seems like a more permanent and story-choreographed version of their performances.  If anything I'd call it a reinterpretation of Future Corps for the Main Street setting, and they weren't kidding when they announced this new band would be ""higher energy,"" and I can see why reauditioning was needed (those guys were old!). Definitely missing the ambiance the old band added to Main Street, though."
Disneyland,3drpbe,vvamperz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, the old band members are still around! Just about all of those guys played in the little street shows like the fire engine squad and the dixieland guys on main street when they weren't in the band uniform, so they're not entirely gone! My friend is one of the trumpet players in the new band (though has worked with the company for a few years) and he absolutely loves it!"
Disneyland,3drpbe,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:25 2015 UTC,"I see the new band values giving high fives to all the guys like that other band.  But seriously, now that I can see what they meant by an upbeat new concept, I kind of like it. I guess it's kind of sad that when I hear Disneyland execs describe a new musical act as ""upbeat"" or ""fresh"", I usually take that as code that it's a terrible obnoxious pop group."
Disneyland,3drpbe,Chrisdog3799,0,Sun Jul 19 13:13:26 2015 UTC,Was this performance just for their debut? Or will this show be put on for as long as they are there?
Disneyland,3drpbe,izookie,0,Sun Jul 19 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"They sound good. They march decently. I know some people in the group that are talented players. The group is too similar to the All-American College Band. Their ""expanded instrumentation"" actually just has the tuba and saxes doubled with an additional tenor drummer. Clarinets and flute/piccolo are gone. It's a marching Jazz band and I feel that that unique set up belongs to the College Band."
Disneyland,3drpbe,PicklePants84,0,Mon Jul 20 02:28:34 2015 UTC,Ohh that's who we saw yesterday! I thought it was the college band. We were eating ice cream in front of Adventureland and they came by and went into Adventureland and came out frontier land. They stopped in front of us to do some formations while playing the Indiana Jones theme.
Disneyland,3drpbe,AXPendergast,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"If that's the type of ""performance"" they're going to give every day, I'll be filing my complaint with City Hall on my next visit.   Nothing against the musical skill.  As a musician, I fully understand the time, commitment, and talent it takes to play.  But let's be real: that was one of the best high-school marching band half-time field shows ever.  That was NOT what I've come to expect when waiting for the Disneyland Marching Band.   If some of the original members are still in the park, as other posters have said, that I'll happily seek them out and listen to them play.  My biggest worry is that this new band will be presenting the music for the flag retreat.  Will they have the same passion and respect for the military tradition of the ceremony...or will they ruin the mood with musical fluff?    Right now, you can count me as a Disney fan who does not appreciate this change."
Disneyland,3drpbe,skraptastic,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:14:09 2015 UTC,"Right now, you can count me as a Disney fan who does not appreciate this change.    Fixed that for you.  The new band is still top notch talent, with a show more people are likely to stop and watch.    Change is good."

HOWEVER: extremely hard rain or lighting will also cause a possible cancelation. Also, look for the balloon releases. Plain white balloons will be released from various rooftops on and around Main Street. If they ride high and slowly the fireworks will launch.

But be advised that Fantasmic and Paint The Night will not run in rainy conditions. You're best bet would be World of Color during wet/windy conditions.  But seeing that there are thunderstorms expected in the Disneyland Resort area until 9 pm, there's a chance that Forever, PTN, Fantasmic, and World of Color will cancel tonight.

Disneyland,3dt9l9,Yo0426,2,Sun Jul 19 07:01:55 2015 UTC,You pay the difference between Deluxe  and Premium on the spot. If you're on a payment plan you continue it like normal at the same rate. So if you have a deluxe you'll pay $230 and you'll then be upgraded for the remainder of your year. Just remember you're not renewing... if your pass expires in a few months and you don't live nearby it's probably better just to buy a day pass for $99.
Disneyland,3dt9l9,AWESOM3e92,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:14:33 2015 UTC,You would end up paying the difference of your pass and the premium pass. Not sure exactly how it works on payment plan though.   And it renews when you first got your original pass. So make sure you take advantage of the decreased time of having the premium.
Disneyland,3dt9l9,dodgepodge,2,Sun Jul 19 07:10:14 2015 UTC,"If you upgrade, I believe you have to pay all at once, so you'd have to pay whatever you've got left on your pass to get you to $700."

But he gave it late at night and it was only good for that day, and we decided the only thing we rly wanted to ride at that point was RSR. We went and stood in front of it and realized the pass he gave us was good for any ride but that one.

Disneyland,3dnvip,I_Broke_Nalgene,2,Fri Jul 17 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"Shame I couldn't be there. I totally intended to, but I didn't wake up until far too late and then I had to be elsewhere in the afternoon.  Maybe the next one! Hopefully the next one will be on a day where it's easier for CMs to get into the parks as guests."
Disneyland,3dnvip,EnglishMobster,2,Sat Jul 18 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"Been in the park all day, aaaah! Wish I had known of this sooner!"
Disneyland,3dnvip,BigBossREX,2,Sat Jul 18 05:58:24 2015 UTC,You're all so dapper and adorable. I wish I could have made it there!

Disneyland,3dpvls,lq2200,6,Sat Jul 18 07:54:48 2015 UTC,"Thursday, for sure."
Disneyland,3dpvls,helloasianglow,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"is there really any difference from a July Thursday vs a Sunday?   Disneyland tends to have a pretty big local draw.  A weekday, especially in the morning, will be noticeably better than a weekend because locals will still have to go to work.  Also, it won't help that both Thursday the 23rd and Sunday the 26th are not passholder blockout days.  Someone else correct me if I'm wrong here, but as far as weekend days go, I've always been told summer Saturdays are the best choice because the Deluxe pass is blocked out every Saturday during the summer."
Disneyland,3dpvls,rextraverse,2,Sat Jul 18 18:03:15 2015 UTC,Is it blocked on Saturday 22nd August?
Disneyland,3dpvls,richterscalemadness,3,Sat Jul 18 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"I believe that by that point the summer blockouts are actually over, so no I don't think they will be blocked out. You can check the Disneyland website for the entire block out schedule though"
Disneyland,3dpvls,CleverNameUser,2,Sat Jul 18 20:43:16 2015 UTC,"Being a deluxe holder, early August was blocked out on Saturdays. The rest of the month was clear. I'll check again to make sure and edit this post if I'm wrong."
Disneyland,3dpvls,SpectreRSG,2,Sat Jul 18 23:03:41 2015 UTC,I think people still plan to visit more on weekends so they take less time off work. Get there at rope drop.
Disneyland,3dpvls,MaLaCoiD,0,Sat Jul 18 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"Sundays always worked out better for me. Out-of-towners are either gone or getting ready to go back home, and locals are more likely to take Friday off (meaning they stay late Thursday) than Monday. Late Sunday night the place is usually pretty empty."

It's a rubber light blue mickey circle head with mickey on the top middle one w/ 60th on it. On the two ears it has the two dates.

Disneyland,3dllzv,Pezto,2,Fri Jul 17 07:02:24 2015 UTC,"First off, Happy Birthday Disneyland!!  When I was little, maybe 7 or 8, my family went to Disneyland. We probably went once every two years. After an amazing day, we decided we were a little peckish and decided to go into DTD to eat at Wolfgang Puck. Earlier that day my parents got me my favorite candy, these guys. My favorite flavor was the red one, so i decided to save it for after dinner. We all had a nice pizza and were on our way out. Time for my lollipop! I finally get it out of the wrapper just as we are leaving. All of a sudden... wooosh! A girl runs past me with her hair flowing behind her. My lollipop is thrust out of my hand as her hair snags my treat! It got stuck in her hair as she ran past. She didn't even notice too. I was devastated and embarrassed. It is probably the saddest I have ever been at Disneyland. That is a memory I will never forget. lol"
Disneyland,3dllzv,dastevonader,4,Fri Jul 17 08:54:49 2015 UTC,"My family went to Disneyland for my 13th or 14th birthday (I can't remember which one). I had also brought my friend with me. When it was just about time to go home at the end of the day, we made a quick pit stop at the restroom across from Soarin' Over California.   My dad and I stood outside the bathroom waiting for the others, a cast member came up to us and asked us if we had ever been on soarin' before. My dad said he had never been on it, and the cast member asked if we had time to go on one last ride.  He then walked us directly to the front of the line and put us in the top, middle seats for the next show. That was something that I'll never forget."

Disneyland,3dlmz8,LatinaAphrodite,6,Fri Jul 17 07:15:33 2015 UTC,"IMO atleast 3 days.  Disneyland is smaller because it's only 2 parks but has much much more packed in it.   I'm going down with my family next month. we're driving down from northern california. spending 5 days in down there but only 3 at the park, taking 2 days to go do other stuff."
Disneyland,3dlmz8,95688it,4,Fri Jul 17 07:20:32 2015 UTC,"3 days is good amount of days, visit Disneyland one day, California the next, and get a park hopper for the 3rd day to visit both or go back to whichever park was the most fun for you"
Disneyland,3dlmz8,mosher408,3,Fri Jul 17 07:56:06 2015 UTC,"With 3 days you should be able to do all you want with a small amount of time for repeating some favorites. You can probably even skip the cost of park hopper upgrade and do 2 days at DL and 1 at DCA. Personally I like to have time to slow down a bit, so I prefer more days, husband and I are planning 5 days with travel on either side for this August."
Disneyland,3dlmz8,MeishkaD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:00:38 2015 UTC,Me and my SO are going end of August. She is a Disney fanatic we figured three days will probably be enough but knowing us we will probably want to go back for fun so we went with four day tickets and the park hopper. We will also be in Anaheim for a week so we have plenty of time.
Disneyland,3dlmz8,Zeppsgaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"From a more ""normal"" pov, 3 days for us was the max we could take. You can definitely do everything  in 2 days. I would only suggest 3 if you're  taking a more lounging approach to the park (ie sit and eat a while, watch the parades and main street performers and lincoln). Otherwise youre going to be repeating rides more than twice and it might be more than necessary. More than 1 day is definitely suggested. 3 is not necessary at all unless  youre slow or the lines are ridiculous.  My family and i did 2 days last year  during the summer and we repeated most of the rides at least twice. 3 would have been an absolute waste of money but then again we didn't  go to blue bayou, watch parades or see the world of tomorrow  attraction. If you do 3 days, definitelt get a park hopper"

I'd say do lunch, it's cheaper and gets you out of the heat.  Make reservations, and show up early and request waterfront seating, you won't be disappointed."

Disneyland,3djxas,glitterwrists,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:38:00 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool for them to blend tech and Marvel in that building and kind of contain it from the rest of the park. I could see them having a good size store in there but not just turn it into a mega Marvel store.

I saw a touch screen and Google Earth for the first time there! My dad and I had such a blast with it. Marvel opens up all kinds of opportunities to show off new tech, and I hope they use that.  As much as I love my dream of Innoventions going back to its theatre roots, I know it'll never be. So the least the team can do is revamp it and make it futuristic and new again!"

Everyone goes to the Mickey and Friends first since it's the most recognized, so you have about two hours of freedom for parking in TS before the re-direction makes it a mess on Harbor.  Edit: Just to elaborate. Get there at Rope drop +2 hours later, you'll be fine. Get there at 10am and any later and you'll be parked in Egypt with stop and go traffic. I have bad flashbacks to memorial day...and that was around noon."
Disneyland,3djecf,Ekkusu_x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"Have you noticed a difference in traffic flow coming from Katella versus Ball? Thanks for the tip too! I was really nervous about dealing with the structure and if you think Toy Story will easily be letting people in, we'll try there first. We plan on leaving the house around 6:30 (we're only 20 miles away) so I'm hoping to not have too much of a battle getting in tomorrow.   Edit: my assumption now is that Ball has a higher chance of getting backed up with people going to Mickey and Friends, so I'm thinking Katella is a better option."
Disneyland,3djecf,Ekkusu_x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Katella is better since Ball will be overflowed with people getting into the Mickey and Friends, then turned over going onto Disney Dr. (alongside the crazy people and the DTD parking lot. Beware the right turners people.) and then slowly Katella/Harbor intersection will be stop and go later on in the day. Earlier in the morning it should be a nice easy drive.  I was going to mention my family's other method of getting into the TS parking lot via the way of Chapman to Harbor and then making a right into the lot; but from what I can remember, when it gets crazy over in TS lot, they stop allowing the right turn in and only the re-direct from Mickey and Friends can get in. (Or it's the every other one method with police directors) So only take my advice if you feel it'll be alright on that end. (Waze app is your friend.)"

TESLA would be a great fit and I am sure even without a sponsership they would switch to electric when they can. They did switch the subs after all, no more diesel."
Disneyland,3de9y6,MeishkaD,10,Wed Jul 15 17:20:42 2015 UTC,I noticed TESLA as a company was used in the film Tomorrowland as the engineers behind their floating monorails. So they've already worked with the company for sponsorship.
Disneyland,3de9y6,glitterwrists,7,Wed Jul 15 18:14:51 2015 UTC,It would be a great fit. And I just looked it up and the Chevron sponsership ended in 2012. I am thinking they are just waiting until after the 60th to revamp. It was an opening day attraction after all.
Disneyland,3de9y6,MeishkaD,11,Wed Jul 15 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping the billion dollar investment includes some revamping of Tomorrowland as a whole.

Disneyland,3de9y6,glitterwrists,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:30 2015 UTC,I can't imagine that they wouldn't at least consider it. I strongly suspect we will see an influx of Marvel at the very least. Lot's of areas there that could use a touch up.  Edited to fix spelling error.
Disneyland,3de9y6,MeishkaD,5,Wed Jul 15 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"The biggest hurdle for a Tesla sponsorship is the fact that Tesla does not do any advertising right now. Their advertising is through word of mouth, and it works pretty well for them to be honest. But they would have to put up big bucks for this attraction I assume, and that's just not their business model right now. One day hopefully but not now. Also Autopia has always been sponsored by an oil company, so being sponsored by an electric car company would probably require some big steps on Disney's part. There also might be something in the contract that Chevron signed that could prevent it."

Disneyland,3de9y6,frankthetank217,15,Wed Jul 15 17:47:30 2015 UTC,Yeah it feels sort of dingy and dirty.  I feel like it's the outdated 80s shopping mall of Disneyland.
Disneyland,3de9y6,collegemathchef,8,Wed Jul 15 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. I feel like the rides have been given upgrades, but the area, as a whole, hasn't. It seems stuck in the old way of how people imagined the future would be. I think now it should be bustling with technology and space themes perhaps. Throw in some iron man tech, get TESLA in on the autopia ride, throw some GPS's on those cars, make em talk or something. I grew up loving autopoia when I was a kid, and it does hold a lot of nostalgia, but I definitely would like to see an upgraded Tomorrowland."

It would cost them a billion dollars every 5 years if they wanted to stay totally up to date with technology and theming in Tomorrowland. It's just not plausible."
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,14,Thu Jul 16 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Autopia doesn't need updating, it needs replacing. The whimsical futuristic concept of everyone being able to drive a car is a bit outdated, and it's a lot of space that could be used to make another, better attraction.   Someone mentioned a light cycle ride in this thread already, and I'd love to see a TRON attraction in Tomorrowland. At least something like that won't become outdated in 20 years."
Disneyland,3de9y6,syxtfour,15,Wed Jul 15 22:46:30 2015 UTC,I agree.. But the smell of that ride is so nostalgic :(
Disneyland,3de9y6,Arcaninemaster69,5,Wed Jul 15 17:35:33 2015 UTC,Whats funny is I can instantly picture Autopia sound and smells in my head. It makes me feel like a kid just to hear that attraction. Another place I love the sound and smells of is The Pirates of the Caribbean ride.
Disneyland,3de9y6,Ihaveastupidcat,5,Thu Jul 16 01:35:11 2015 UTC,The smell of pirates is my favorite. (Sorry any CMs reading...don't hate me) I actually filled a water bottle with the water to pirates 2 years ago. It's insane that it is still intact and when you open the bottle it smells just like the ride! :)

Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,3,Thu Jul 16 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"I never thought of Tesla, I figured that an EV replacement sponsored by Honda (remember ASIMO in Innoventions?) was a logical next step.   The idea of driving a car doesn't seem to fit into the concept of ""Tomorrow"" very well, but for kids it certainly is so I give it a pass. Making the cars pure electric would at leas make it seem vaguely futuristic since, while we do have EVs on the road, the highways aren't exactly full of them yet."
Disneyland,3de9y6,hawaiian717,4,Thu Jul 16 02:40:56 2015 UTC,My Brother had an ingenious idea. Dome it put tones of neon stuff all over and turn them into light-cycles and make it a tron race.
Disneyland,3de9y6,Mercury756,3,Wed Jul 15 19:26:39 2015 UTC,Now we're talking! Disney needs a real suggestion box type thing. My friends and I (like so many Disney park enthusiasts) come up with great ideas that we as guests would love to see added/changed to the parks.   This idea needs to get to someone in charge at Disney.
Disneyland,3de9y6,erinisntrad,2,Wed Jul 15 19:32:21 2015 UTC,There's no marketing potential to Tron anymore since they cancelled the next movie. There is no merch that they can sell or movie that they can promote anymore. Any attraction that they build now generally has some kind of marketable item other than a theme park ride. The Shanghai Tron ride was announced back when there was going to be another movie.
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:54 2015 UTC,Im thinking about it from the stand point of just how damn cool that would be at the park. And lets be a little nostalgic for a moment and remember that plenty of rides were created with no matketing backing from movies. Regardless you gotta admit that would be flipping awesome!
Disneyland,3de9y6,Mercury756,6,Thu Jul 16 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"No denying it would be cool. The Shanghai one looks freaking sweet, I can't wait to see it in action. I totally agree some of Disney's best rides were created when Imagineers were allowed to design freely."
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,5,Thu Jul 16 05:48:35 2015 UTC,"At least ours isn't the Tomorrowland Speedway (WDW's version of Autopia).  It's horrible, poor theming and really boring."
Disneyland,3de9y6,purple_people_eaters,3,Wed Jul 15 20:15:47 2015 UTC,Ya it's much worse. DL version has been updated much more recently though I believe.
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,2,Thu Jul 16 01:52:57 2015 UTC,"Every time I've gone on the WDW version, I'm thoroughly let down, but I do it for my kid. DL's track is longer and more scenic. I love being able to drive though a jungle and see the monorail pass overhead. It's even better a night. I do love the little motor sounds, it's just that smell. It takes me back to being a kid and getting to drive for the first time on my own."
Disneyland,3de9y6,ranoutofbacon,6,Thu Jul 16 04:24:50 2015 UTC,"Not only is Autopia old and clunky, it takes up A LOT of space. I would not be sad to see it go altogether, but I did like the idea/rumor of turning it into a speederbike ride through Endor."
Disneyland,3de9y6,InformationMagpie,4,Wed Jul 15 21:17:01 2015 UTC,I would ride the heck out of that.
Disneyland,3de9y6,chicklette,3,Wed Jul 15 22:36:08 2015 UTC,I'd rather they gut the backlot at DCA and build a forest for a mini star wars land.
Disneyland,3de9y6,ranoutofbacon,2,Thu Jul 16 04:26:25 2015 UTC,"It takes up SOOOOOOOO much space!!! The entirety of Fantasyland could fit inside of Autopia's attraction area. Or to put it in even more perspective, you could fit almost 3 ToonTowns inside of Autopia (line and ride track). It's outdated, not futuristic, and nothing special. Its go-karts. It's a huge waste of precious real estate."
Disneyland,3de9y6,mascarafatale,2,Thu Jul 16 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a large portion of that real estate can't support heavy buildings, because it has the submarine path underneath it. They'd have to rebuild everything to fully utilize the area.  But if the thing about ToonTown being replaced by Star Wars Land is true, it'd be cool if they could move Mickey and Minnie's houses to the space where Autopia is. Maybe have a little toon-themed playground or garden on the parts that are on top of the indoor lagoon."

Disneyland,3de9y6,mascarafatale,4,Thu Jul 16 04:19:53 2015 UTC,"GET RID OF IT!  With the sheer size of the attraction (line area and ride track) it could fit ALL OF FANTASYLAND inside of it. It could fit almost THREE TOONTOWNS! Seriously. Look at an aerial view and see how much space this ride takes up. It. Is. Outrageous. It has nothing to make it special for Disneyland. It isn't related to any films. It has next to no theming (besides advertising for auto or gas companies). It isn't futuristic. It's outdated. It uses a shameful amount of gasoline to run those cars day in, day out. And it could be found anywhere, at any other run of the mill theme park or family fun land. It is a HUGE WASTE.  I am even against updating this ride to make it Star Wars or Tron themed. There is potential for so much more to be done with that huuuuuge area of precious real estate! BUILD A NEW LAND IN THIS SPACE!"
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,8,Thu Jul 16 00:34:22 2015 UTC,"It's much more complicated than that because the Finding Nemo ride is directly underneath the Autopia track. AND Autopia is an opening day attraction, there aren't all that many left, and it's the last opening day attraction in Tomorrowland. Also you as an adult may find it boring, but a young kid who can't even drive a go kart yet thinks it's the best thing in the world.   Also updating it to electric (which was the whole point of this post) would solve all the problems with it you mentioned. And to be honest they could cut it down to be about half the length and probably get away with it."
Disneyland,3de9y6,Reneeisme,4,Thu Jul 16 01:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yes to all of this.  And you're right about fitting it in less space.  Just making the elevated in some spots, over other portions of the track, would add to the excitement and conserve space.   It is an opening day attraction, but not in it's current configuration.  It could certainly be updated."
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,2,Thu Jul 16 02:46:23 2015 UTC,There's lots of imaginative things they could do to keep the attraction and have it take up less space.
Disneyland,3de9y6,InformationMagpie,2,Thu Jul 16 05:59:44 2015 UTC,I have heard that in addition to gas they also go through tires like nobody's business.

Disneyland,3de9y6,Penyl,2,Wed Jul 15 18:27:18 2015 UTC,If they switched to EV for Autopia I hope they can make it still sound like a gasoline powered car. Watching the Tokyo version that is almost completely silent doesn't really appeal to me. Or at least add something to it to make it worth while.
Disneyland,3de9y6,ranoutofbacon,3,Wed Jul 15 21:48:46 2015 UTC,They can add a full sound system to the entire ride. Each car could get transducers to make it feel like it has a huge V8.
Disneyland,3de9y6,centracing,2,Thu Jul 16 04:28:45 2015 UTC,I would imagine it would be narrated with music and such as well. Adding engine noise would kind of defeat the purpose.

Disneyland,3de9y6,Shatteredreality,3,Thu Jul 16 01:42:27 2015 UTC,"I think they would have to do it without the ""track"" part in the sense that it should be off rails.   It would be WAY more futuristic if they had the cars be legitimately automated in the sense that they could change ""lanes"" etc without human interaction and without being on a set route (like a rail).   They could even write an algorithm that determines which lane the car should be in at the end to maximize the flow of people (if the car is currently in the far right lane but the left one is more open it could merge to ensure after loading and unloading)."

Long as Ghost Galaxy and Haunted Mansion Holiday are open, we'll be happy.

I did like seeing and meeting all the villains, but even during the party the lines get long. The lines for the candy can get long too (LPT: start from the back of the park up. The trick or treat line down by the Toontown train station was empty.) Seeing all the creative costumes is fun, too.   With that said, I totally want to go back this year.

Disneyland,3dec79,danimaroo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"I've been to Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party in Walt Disney World and Mickey's Halloween Party in Disneyland. For me personally, I found Mickey's Halloween Party in Disneyland to be pretty underwhelming in comparison to MNSSHP.  Main reason? The parade. Disney World has the Boo to You Parade which is seriously fantastic. In the past, Disneyland just had a ""Costume Cavalcade"" which has arguably the most annoying soundtrack I've heard on repeat. It's also very short and is not much of a ""parade"". They just announced though that this year, Paint the Night will still be the main parade during Halloween Party nights. So really, it's the same parade you'll be able to see on non-party nights.  There are trick or treating spots which can be fun to hit up and get candy from, and Halloween Screams is a great fireworks show, but I don't know... I had a total blast with my friends but personally, I wouldn't pay for the Halloween Party again in Disneyland but definitely will do it again in WDW in the future.  Other people may have a different opinion on it than I do, but that's just my 2 cents. I will say it is nice to be able to go on attractions with not as long lines, and it's definitely fun to dress up in costume."
Disneyland,3dec79,jasoniscursed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's underwhelming. The only thing that I like is the fireworks which they used to do throughout the Halloween season but now they just do it on the Halloween Party nights which is a bummer."

Disneyland,3dfidp,lamerooster,2,Thu Jul 16 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"I never want to discourage someone from going to Disneyland, but those dates are some of the first days where no passholders are blocked out. So in all honesty it will most likely be pretty crowded.  If you do go make sure to utilize the fastpass system and the closer to opening you go the shorter the lines.  And it's the happiest place on Earth!"
Disneyland,3dfidp,kathompson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"LOL I'm not sure how happy it would be with me barfing my way from ride to ride. I don't do heat well and hadn't considered it might feel hotter in the parks... this was good info to have, thanks. We have reservations in December, too, I think perhaps we'll just wait."
Disneyland,3dfidp,keti24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:49 2015 UTC,I'm going the 25-28 of August and I've been asking around. People are pretty sure HM will still be open. And its not listed under ride closures on the Disneyland website. So I think we're both good :)
Disneyland,3dfidp,epotosi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:47:12 2015 UTC,"Actually I think it'll be closed those dates. I'm also looking at those dates, and based on past history, I get the feeling HM will be closed.  I think the crowds will be ""hey it's allright"" since many schools have started by then."
Disneyland,3dfidp,richterscalemadness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:52:56 2015 UTC,Yes it is. I've been waiting for the schedule to update on the official site for ages and as of yesterday or the day before it says haunted mansion closes on monday 24th. Me and my (nearly) wife are there for our honeymoon and were planning on going that day but now going on saturday 22nd instead as I've never been before and really want to go on the haunted mansion.

Disneyland,3deyve,Peachtree42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:16:43 2015 UTC,"I think they start the day-guest/even guest mix in at 3 or 4 and then close the park for the event at 8. They do event specific fireworks so there will be no Disneyland Forever on party nights.   Also, hugs Sorry about your father. <3  ETA: Maybe you guys can go to the Halloween party dressed as characters from your father's favourite Disney movie in the honour of him? I've gone the past two years and had a blast. They're going to do Paint the Night and special Halloween fireworks during the event.  It's going to be less crowded since they only let a fraction of the people in they normally would so you won't have to wait a million hours just for a spot."
Disneyland,3deyve,TokidokiHobi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about the Halloween party. I'm just trying to decide if we do 2 full days plus HP (missing out on magic morning from a 3-day pass), or buy a 3-day pass plus HP, or go 3 full days plus the HP half-day. Oi! Decisions, decisions!"
Disneyland,3deyve,Pinklette,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say do the Halloween Party to help differentiate this trip from others in the past.   Plus, you get to wear costumes! I love costumes, lol."
Disneyland,3deyve,caustickitten,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"Eat at blue bayou (if you do fantasmic, add that on) because the food is amazing. I suggest the surf and turf. I would also say do Fantasmic since it's probably good memories for your family. They give you a seat cushion and everyone now sits in the front lower section. A little weird but everyone has a great view, even us shorties. WOC Dining at Trattoria lunch. They have the best viewing section for WOC, the food is good (not great but neither is Carthay), and lunch is pretty cheap. Plus the dessert mini sampler is AMAZING See all the shows, parades, story tellings, whatever, totally worth it Go every morning for early mornings if you have them (you probably will since you mentioned staying on property) and rope drop if not. Do rides for an hour and a half or two and then eat breakfast and take a break when the kids come out and the parks start getting filled. Flo's in DCA starts selling beer when the park opens. I know you're not big drinkers but I love this. Plus, the envious looks of every dad being dragged by a kid or while waiting in a line is amazing. When you make reservations, there's a section for notes. If you put in how special Disney is to your mom and what happened with your dad, they might do something special for her. Castmembers are super awesome about these things, but don't abuse it. If you can afford it, the tasting menu/ chef's table at Napa Rose is killer. 5 courses for $100, with wine pairings it's $150 but TOTALY worth it. This place should have Michelin stars. If you get special fast passes (getting stuck on a ride, messing up something, etc) use them on either Peter Pan or Toy Story Mania. Don't neglect the food and just get whats quick or cheap. DCA and Disneyland has some amazing food options and they're worth it. For Lilly Belle, just make sure you're there EARLY and talk to a castmember ASAP Your mom might like Carthay (i suggest only apps, the entrees are meh) or the Carthay Lounge since it's all old-hollywood and awesome. Plus the drinks are amazing.  Trader Sam's at the Disneyland hotel is awesome for a nightcap, and even if you don't have a boozy drink, the atmosphere inside is worth the walk over there  I hope some or any of that helped. I haven't been since the new 60th anniversary stuff (going July 31) but I'm definitely going to see all the new shows and parades and fireworks."

But if you're going to DCA, you have to go pretty early for the radiator Springs races fast passes cause those go away very quickly! After space mountain, we either get Indiana or big thunder, or if we're at DCA, it's soarin and screaming for the rest of the day!! Hope you have an awesome time!"

Disneyland,3ddz7a,caustickitten,2,Fri Jul 17 01:11:04 2015 UTC,"If you have the money, I would recommend the Welcome to Disneyland tour ($25 a person) because you get to go on like 3 or 4 attractions without waiting and when the tour is done, they give you a few fast passes. These can be used on anything so don't waste them, I always use mine on Toy Story Mania or Peter Pan because these rides have CRAZY waits ALL the TIME and no fast pass line so you just walk right on (through the back or handicapped entrance).   Whenever we go on a busy day, we always do the tour because it seriously pays off in gold.   Also, if you have passes and miss your window because you're eating at a table service restaurant or something, ask the manager to call over and they will honor your passes after your meal."

Disneyland,3ddz7a,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother with Racers Fast Passes. Be there at rope drop early enough to get at the front. Head straight there. Everyone goes to get an FP so if you head there fast you can get on without a huge wait. Or at least that's worked for my friends and I went we go
Disneyland,3ddz7a,few23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:59 2015 UTC,"We were there for Rope Drop at CA last January for our 10th anniversary. Let's call it what it really is, a Rope Walk; cast members pace your group to Cars Land. In fact there are two groups, one from the front gate, and another from the Grand Californian entrance. Only did this once, so I can't say for sure it always works out this way, but the front gate group got there before the Grand Californian group did. There may have been audible boos. Maybe we didn't cheer loud enough or try hard enough at the trivia game."
Disneyland,3ddz7a,lamerooster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"Disneyland: Space Mountain  DCA: Tower of Terror  Roger Rabbit Cartoon Spin used to be on its own fastpass system(since it closed earlier for fireworks) and you could carry that and pick up another one in the park without being denied another fastpass for x amount of hours.  Same went for California Screaming in DCA (because of World of Color)....but they fixed it :(  Also, Indiana Jones tends to break down more than the other E ticket rides."
Disneyland,3ddz7a,hellalazy,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"I have a 7 & 5 y/o, in addition to fast passes try to get a rider switch pass when you use your fp. Switch passes allow the parents with children who are too small to ride watch their kids while the other parent rides with the kids who are tall enough, then they may switch and the other parent can ride by using the fast pass line. Essentially the switch pass can act like a fast pass. This is what I usually do, I'll let the CM know I need a SP because my wife is watching our infant child even though we don't have one and my wife would do the same thing. We meet up later in the line and get back in the FP line after the ride is over with our rider switch passes. I know it's dishonest but hey.   Oh yea, I usually get radiator springs and show passes first before I hit up any rides."

Disneyland,3d7z37,djjedi,15,Tue Jul 14 13:58:33 2015 UTC,you dont actually end up walking everywhere at WDW. There are multiple shuttles to and from all of the gates. Its quite huge and you can def get lost in the vastness.
Disneyland,3d7z37,Brisane10,10,Tue Jul 14 14:44:26 2015 UTC,And no Brazilian tour groups :)
Disneyland,3d7z37,Jekyllhyde,3,Tue Jul 14 21:57:44 2015 UTC,By WDW are you actually meaning the Magic Kingdom park? Because WDW is 4 theme parks with tons of rides altogether.
Disneyland,3d7z37,mbrady,19,Tue Jul 14 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"At least as of a couple of years ago Disneyland Resort had more rides than all of WDW. WDW had more overall attractions (interactive exhibits, shows) but the number of rides at Disneyland was greater. The parks at Disney World are more spread out and cover more area but that doesn't mean that they have more to ride on.  EDIT: I decided to count it up using Disney's website as a source. WDW has 113 Attractions overall to DLR's 83 but DLR has 55 Rides to WDW's 47. Here is the full breakdown: Disneyland Park 53 Attractions 36 Rides 85 Acres    California Adventure 30 Attractions 19 Rides 67 Acres    Disneyland Resort 83 Attractions 55 Rides 160 Acres    Magic Kingdom 41 Attractions 27 Rides 107 Acres    Epcot 34 Attractions 8 Rides 300 Acres    Animal Kingdom 28 Attractions 7 Rides 500 Acres    Hollywood Studios 10 Attractions 5 Rides 154 Acres    WDW Resort 113 Attractions 47 Rides 27,258 Acres"

Say, are the WDW all full price?"
Disneyland,3d7z37,Drag0600,3,Tue Jul 14 21:23:30 2015 UTC,"If you get a 1 day, 1 park pass then the Magic Kingdom is $8 more than the other parks ($105 to $97 for adults, $99 to $91 for kids). Most people end up getting. Most people end up doing a park hopper ticket though. It's also very time consuming to get between parks at WDW. You don't know how nice it is to just be able to walk across a small outside area to get to another park until you've tried to deal with WDW's shuttle system. I really liked certain aspects of WDW but for me, none of the parks were full day parks but you hated hopping between them because it took so long."
Disneyland,3d7z37,provoaggie,5,Tue Jul 14 21:36:42 2015 UTC,"Yes thanks for that!  I was speaking rides specifically.  I also was not subscribing to the ""one is better"" notion I just though it was a neat factoid given the huge size difference."
Disneyland,3d7z37,djjedi,3,Tue Jul 14 18:39:38 2015 UTC,So what makes something a ride as opposed to an attraction?
Disneyland,3d7z37,TheRealMe99,3,Tue Jul 14 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"A ride is something that you can get on and it moves. Rides are also pretty much available to experience as long as the park is open (unless it's broken down or being renovated). Disney is pretty loose with the term attraction. It can mean a ride, a show or even something that you just look at. Some of their shows are pretty well done but you are also limited on when you can see them. Some are only offered once a day and many happen at the same time so you can only choose to experience one of them in a day. IN addition to this things like the big tree in the middle of Animal Kingdom or a simple water fountain or even some of the character meet and greets are considered Attractions as well. These are the types of attractions that Disney World has so many of. There are more things to see at Disney World but there aren't as many things to do...unless you count staring at a big tree doing something."
Disneyland,3d7z37,provoaggie,3,Tue Jul 14 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that rides are things like Big Thunder, Alice in Wonderland, Small World, and Splash Mountain - where you get into a vehicle and it takes you on a journey.  Attractions include parades, shows (World of Color, Enchanted Tiki Room, Disney Junior, Fireworks), Exhibits (Art of Animation, Opera House), and other assorted stuff like Jedi Training Academy, Animation Academy, and Mad T Party."
Disneyland,3d7z37,rextraverse,-5,Tue Jul 14 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"California Adventure just completed a huge expansion, which cost more than the money spent on the original park, where Hollywood Studios is about to undergo a major expansion.  It's not a good time to make that comparison."
Disneyland,3d7z37,asha1985,6,Tue Jul 14 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"Cars Land added a total of 3 rides to DCA...and one of those rides is already gone. The rest of the DCA renovation was basically a visual facelift on the park. It didn't add a ton to the park (53 rides is still more than 47). On the flip side, Disneyland Park has added a total of 2 rides in the past 20 years (Buzz Lightyear and Winnie the Pooh). The last major attraction added at that park was Indiana Jones Adventure."
Disneyland,3d7z37,provoaggie,2,Tue Jul 14 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"Actually the last major attraction was rocket rods (in 98) which obviously closed. We're also forgetting the finding Nemo submarines. Disneyland also does much more refurbishment on older rides without making new ones.  Point is, Disney does make changes to DL more often than you think and especially with the rumors of star wars land, we'll probably see more attractions in the next few years."
Disneyland,3d7z37,ghost209,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:38:48 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time including a ride that lasted 2 years (and was broken down for a good chunk of that time). Disneyland has done some renovations in that time (Finding Nemo Subs, Star Tours) but not a ton. The park really hasn't changed that much since I was a kid."
Disneyland,3d7z37,provoaggie,2,Tue Jul 14 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, the DCA 2.0 redo also added the Red Car Trolley."
Disneyland,3d7z37,M3wThr33,2,Tue Jul 14 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"No there are actually a few more rides at DL/DCA than all of WDW.  It's really interesting to see the difference in layout, plus WDW has way more shows and non-ride attractions."

Disneyland,3d7z37,M3wThr33,9,Tue Jul 14 06:31:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, but WDW still has more developed property.    It's not a fair representation either way, since Disneyland was never planned to a full week vacation destination when it was envisioned."

The famous ""blessing of size"" that's been squandered in the parks, so walkways in Adventureland in MK are single file because they've become stroller parking lots. But when random people bring up the size of the land as some way that WDW outclasses DLR, it's hilarious. The entirety of DCA fits inside Epcot's World Showcase Lagoon. Whoop de do. It doesn't mean that Epcot is 2x as good as DCA since these comparisons do nothing but cause rifts in the community."
Disneyland,3d7z37,M3wThr33,2,Wed Jul 15 01:58:50 2015 UTC,"The person you responded to didn't bring it up. I agree that the argument can causes rifts, but it's a bit self-defeating when you're the one who brought it up"
Disneyland,3d7z37,CaptainRex85,9,Wed Jul 15 02:13:35 2015 UTC,You're telling me that epcot + epcot car park is nearly the same size as all of disneyland??
Disneyland,3d7z37,Reionx,20,Tue Jul 14 12:54:09 2015 UTC,"What's even more impressive is that, despite it's size, Disneyland has the same -- if not slightly more -- rides/attractions than all of the WDW theme parks combined."
Disneyland,3d7z37,Tehrab,10,Tue Jul 14 15:13:19 2015 UTC,I much prefer having the more compact-ness of DLR as far as wanting to hit all the rides/shows in a day or two. Seems impossible for WDW. Still would like to visit of course.
Disneyland,3d7z37,OnTheMidnightTrain,4,Tue Jul 14 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"The total developed property at the Disneyland resort is just over 500 acres. The total acreage of the EPCOT park, alone, is 300 acres, without the parking lot. So, yes, that's pretty believable that Epcot plus its parking lot is comparable in size to all of the Disneyland Resort property.  As an aside, Animal Kingdom is just over 500 acres without its parking lot."
Disneyland,3d7z37,MikeT75,3,Tue Jul 14 13:12:46 2015 UTC,There is also a humongous Lake in the middle of it that you have to walk all the way around. Take that out and it's much smaller.

Disneyland,3d7z37,Stradocaster,2,Tue Jul 14 18:44:12 2015 UTC,I made these maps so you can easily compare WDW and Disneyland to anywhere in the world.  They are a little more accurate than the one OP posted because this website adjusts outlines based on long/lat and the mercator projection google uses.  I outlined the individual parks as well.  Disneyland over WDW:  http://mapfrappe.com/?show=31836  Walt Disney World over San Francisco: http://mapfrappe.com/?show=31837

Disneyland,3d7z37,Reddit_Executive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:56:03 2015 UTC,What is Disney University?
Disneyland,3d7z37,michaelmatzur,5,Tue Jul 14 07:20:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know about WDW, but here at Disneyland, ""Disney University"" is where cast members learn to be cast members. Everything from general training to training to become a trainer or supervisor goes through Disney University.  I believe the Disney College Program also takes classes through Disney University as well, but I'm not sure. I don't know a lot about the college program -- I know people from all over the country come work at Disneyland for a semester. I know there's lots of activities organized by the college program that ""normal"" CMs aren't a part of, and you take lots of classes that focus on how Disney does business. I believe they are actual business classes that can count towards a degree in business, but I'm not sure (I've never asked). If you don't live nearby, Disney will provide you with housing that comes out of your paycheck.  At the end of your program, you can either leave the company and return home or stay with the company in the same position you had in the college program. However, if you stay, Disney won't keep providing you with housing -- you'd have to find your own place to live. You'll also lose the guaranteed hours you had as a college program CM, which sucks because it makes it harder to pay the bills.  Now, again, I've never been a part of the college program, so I can't speak specifics. Obviously, any views I have are my own and don't represent the Disney company, but I've developed a soft spot for the college program. The people that come in through the college program are generally really nice people, and it breaks my heart when the semester ends and most of them go back home to finish their degrees.  I know if you do leave, you have a good shot of being hired back into the company again. Lots of friends of mine have completed a College Program semester in Florida and then came back home to work at Disneyland -- I don't know if that's something the College Program set up for them, or whether they went through the process on their own.  I also believe that you don't get to choose where you work. You can't say that you want to work in Attractions, for example -- you can get put anywhere, from Foods to Merchandising to Custodial. I also think you don't get to choose whether you go to Disneyland or WDW, considering how I just mentioned a lot of California-native CMs wind up going to Florida for a semester and begin as a ""normal"" CM at Disneyland after the semester is over.  That's all I know about Disney University. It may be a bigger thing in Florida than it is here -- the building there looks pretty sizable, whereas here it's scattered about everywhere. I've only taken a couple classes through Disney University, and they all focused on the basics of being a CM (with the exception of my attraction training, which technically went through Disney University as well, I believe)."
Disneyland,3d7z37,EnglishMobster,2,Tue Jul 14 09:11:10 2015 UTC,"It's where classes are held relating to company induction and classes related to roles within the different lines of business. Classrooms are set up with like a regular computer lab, however some connect to a training room where you can be placed in a more recognisable setting while practicing guest interaction using the systems you're being trained in. I don't know if they hold the college program classes there too, I only really remember seeing them offered at the housing complexes."
Disneyland,3d7z37,TheMoistMuffin,2,Tue Jul 14 14:22:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on the class, some are in the parks, some are in the hotels, some are in housing, some are in Disney University."

Disneyland,3d7z37,fontizmo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:33 2015 UTC,And the aggressive homeless situation. I do not know what the difference is between New York and San Francisco's homeless problems. New York's homeless are not nearly that aggressive nor do they seemingly have the population that San Francisco does. This cannot speculation on my part... there has to be stats out there on these problems.

Disneyland,3d7z37,newvictim,-29,Tue Jul 14 16:16:09 2015 UTC,I always thought I was missing out as a kid going to World instead of Land. Boy was I wrong.
Disneyland,3d7z37,TheBeardedMarxist,11,Tue Jul 14 06:06:13 2015 UTC,Because bigger = better? There's still more than a vacation worth of attractions at Disneyland and a very different vibe than WDW.
Disneyland,3d7z37,SphincterKing,-18,Tue Jul 14 13:48:02 2015 UTC,Just seems like it would be overcrowded. I had no idea Land was that small. Now that I'm an adult I prefer thrill rides at real amusement parks.

Disneyland,3d7z37,OnTheMidnightTrain,-10,Tue Jul 14 16:25:11 2015 UTC,So what's the best thrill ride? At World I remember space mountain and it was lame.  Edit: so nothing good?
Disneyland,3d7z37,TheBeardedMarxist,10,Tue Jul 14 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"Space Mountain is much better at DLR.   But if you are looking for thrill rides only, stick to Six Flags."
Disneyland,3d7z37,TrulyGoofy,6,Tue Jul 14 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"As a total adrenaline junkie and coaster enthusiast, Space Mountain, Tower of Terror, California Screamin, and Indiana Jones are plenty thrilling. But I guess if you're dead set on not enjoying yourself, they won't be."
Disneyland,3d7z37,fontizmo,-6,Tue Jul 14 20:27:50 2015 UTC,I haven't tried the Land Space mountain. I love tower terror but it has nothing on the new super man tower's. I can't comment on the other two. Thank you for your input.
Disneyland,3d7z37,TheBeardedMarxist,4,Tue Jul 14 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"DLR has its charm. I'm looking forward to going back there some day. But definitely designed to be a day park, not the destination that WDW is. Two very different parks/resorts, lots of room for love of both."

Disneyland,3dakh8,Balderdash42,27,Tue Jul 14 19:56:22 2015 UTC,I'd opt for the 2 day romantic vacation. 8 month old is going to get bored and cranky in the summer for a whole week.
Disneyland,3dakh8,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:12:13 2015 UTC,that's what I'm leaning towards as well. thanks!
Disneyland,3dakh8,YoMama727,4,Tue Jul 14 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"You and your wife can switch off for rides: https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/rider-switch/  There isn't a lot for an 8 month old to do at Disneyland, to be honest.  But it's still fun, and if you're planning on taking your kid when they get older, it is nice to look at pictures at Disneyland when they were a baby"
Disneyland,3dakh8,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,2,Tue Jul 14 20:13:30 2015 UTC,That's a cool option! I figured Disney would do something to help people in my case. Thanks!
Disneyland,3dakh8,jessejacksome,3,Tue Jul 14 20:14:53 2015 UTC,"We went when my niece was 11 months old and there was plenty she could ride on, not that she cared, she fell asleep on every ride.   But, we made her a special scrapbook before her trip this year of when she went as a baby and she loves it. She loved looking at the  pictures before her trip when she was 3."
Disneyland,3dakh8,95688it,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"And if your wife doesn't want to go on a certain ride that you do, most rides offer a ""Single Rider"" option. Where you can go solo (basically like a fastpass) and fill in on the rides. Beats waiting in the line if it's just you, because you obviously still have to wait in line to get the Switch Rider pass."
Disneyland,3dakh8,shewee,6,Tue Jul 14 21:37:12 2015 UTC,just the 2 of you. the baby is not going to have a fun time and neither will you with a grumpy baby.
Disneyland,3dakh8,southlandradar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"If they have a generally grumpy baby, I agree. I'm a bit biased because my kid is honestly the easiest baby I've ever seen, but he's 10 months old and been 20+ times--never a single tear!"
Disneyland,3dakh8,southlandradar,8,Wed Jul 15 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"My son had a blast at 8 months. He's 10 months now. Yeah, it's limiting because my wife and I don't go on Thunder Mountain or Matterhorn together, but Fantasyland gets illuminated when you're with a young child. He loves Dumbo, Mr. Toad, the carousel, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, It's A Small World, Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, and the train is a blast. He's been mesmerized by Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln and Haunted Mansion since he was just weeks old. I really enjoy the park on a different level, even though he's so young. Just walking around the park and taking pictures is just as fun as Space Mountain ever was.   That being said, my wife and I had many years and many, many trips to both Disneyland and Disney World that were some of the most romantic times of our lives. A nice dinner and drinks at Carthay Circle or Napa Rose, late nights at Trader Sams, and holding hands on the dark rides like we were teenagers, running from the fireworks to Fantasmic without worrying about our little guy getting trampled. And don't forget it'll be really hot and really crowded when you go. If your child is bummed out, you'll probably be bummed out.   Really, there's no bad choice. Both experiences are great."

Disneyland,3dakh8,MacArthurParker,2,Wed Jul 15 01:38:36 2015 UTC,"If you're traveling, your pediatrician may recommend you get the MMR early, it can be given as early as 6 months. Full disclosure: my son got Disneyland measles when he was 4 and a half months old. It was terrifying, but it's so contagious you could literally pick it up anywhere, that's the scary thing. Most of the cases from that outbreak were transmitted in grocery stores and such. I'd be more worried about the flight! Definitely chat with your pediatrician either way."
Disneyland,3dakh8,shewee,2,Wed Jul 15 04:41:23 2015 UTC,"It's up to you, my gf and I discussed this and both agree that it's better to wait until the kid can remember their day there and can get on rides."
Disneyland,3d9yyd,Zeppsgaming,6,Tue Jul 14 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"There's several viewing areas for Paint the Night (PTN) & Fireworks. Try to collect them all:   Main Street, about in front of Candy Palace Main Street, where you can see Matterhorn Small World near VIP area   You can see Soundsational Parade from any of the above locations, then camp out the 4 hours for Paint the Night and Fireworks. If you don't want to camp out, there's a point 60 to 30 minutes before PTN where Cast Members ask everybody on Main Street to stand and you can find a spot at that point. You only have about a 5 minute window where this works. Also, it's possible to find room on Main Street after PTN and before Fireworks, but, again, the window of opportunity is short.  You can try to time it so fireworks are happening as you ride Matterhorn or Astro Orbiter.  If you have a FastPass for World of Color at 10p, it's possible to make the show after Fireworks end, even if you're at Small World (exit via Big Thunder).  You can also see the Fireworks in New Orleans Square, which will be perfect since you're going to see Fantasmic.  I'd do:   Night 1: Soundsational, PTN, & Fireworks at Small World near VIP area, Use Fastpass for World of Color or Fantasmic Night 2: Fireworks & Fantasmic at New Orleans Square Night 3: PTN & Fireworks on Main Street, where you can see Matterhorn, Use Fastpass for World of Color or Fantasmic Night 4: PTN & Fireworks on Main Street, about in front of Candy Palace, Use Fastpass for World of Color or Fantasmic"
Disneyland,3d9yyd,MaLaCoiD,2,Tue Jul 14 18:09:40 2015 UTC,This is perfect. I will look at this but it sounds like the exact plan I was looking for. Appreciate it.
Disneyland,3d9yyd,carolinejay,3,Tue Jul 14 18:19:29 2015 UTC,"if you're not dead set on seeing the fireworks & nighttime parade by the castle, there's a pretty decent viewing spot in front of it's a small world. there is an elevated platform/promenade/walkway on the right side as you head down the parade corridor towards the it's a small world attraction. There is a viewing spot that's on the ""upper"" level of that, above the VIP reserved area (you will notice that area because it's filled with white folding chairs and staffed by CMs). My family and I viewed the parade and fireworks from here about a week after the shows premiered. We showed up about 2 hours prior to the first parade and were right on the railing above the VIP viewing area. Since we were on the second level there was nobody directly in front of us. They also do projections on the small world façade, and you can turn around and see the Matterhorn and other effects too."
Disneyland,3d9yyd,carolinejay,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:35 2015 UTC,I saw this on the Fresh Baked YouTube channel and I was thinking this might be a good idea. Is there any benefit to seeing it in front of the castle? Maybe more of the fireworks I'm guessing? We might just do both on separate nights. We don't want to miss anything.
Disneyland,3d9yyd,MaLaCoiD,3,Tue Jul 14 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"yeah there are some low-level pyrotechnics that go off, and there's projections down main street. I've seen the show on main street as well, and I found myself distracted by the projections! being right in front of the castle, the projections didn't seem as impressive as the ones on main street. personally I prefer the small world location, because there's enough projections that you get the idea without feeling overwhelmed, and you get to see the majority of the fireworks.   Another interesting, and different spot is the area between dumbo & the carrousel. I haven't seen the new show from this area but in the past it's pretty cool. there are no projections here but the fireworks are right above your head. and tinkerbell flies right above you too. it's pretty cool."

Disneyland,3d86hk,centracing,2,Tue Jul 14 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"I've suggested it many times, unfortunately it's probably a fantasy at the moment as Tesla doesn't spend money on advertising, and I'm not sure how long Autopia is going to last in it's current version. Hong Kong DL has an electric Autopia, but it's nothing special really, just the same theming as California but with electric motors instead of gas ones. I think maybe once the Tesla Model 3 comes out they will start advertising, and then what better way than a ride at Disneyland? It could be like a test drive in a Tesla, it's such a great marketing idea. It's always boggled me how the combination of Disney and California has yet to produce an electric Autopia!"

I don't expect anyone from Disney to make any type of announcement until the testing phases are over. It's already a very touchy subject for locals here. I get down-voted if I even mention FP+ or MagicBands.
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,2,Tue Jul 14 17:59:25 2015 UTC,"Disney would announce testing before they did it though. They announced the testing of MyMagic+ and the magic bands at the different resorts as they were rolling it out. It's not like we're sitting here on July 14th now and they are going to roll it out in August without telling anyone, especially the guinea pigs."
Disneyland,3d86hk,izookie,0,Tue Jul 14 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that... Some of the Company's moves come quietly and quickly. It seems that the early iterations of MM+ we're not quite ready for prime time and guests who had negative experiences were quite vocal. Even though I had a fantastic experience at WDW this year, I have a hard time convincing others of the benefits for MM+. It seems that many of the changes to the system have been unannounced besides simple changes in the website. We'll see."
Disneyland,3d86hk,kelsey0403,17,Tue Jul 14 18:11:50 2015 UTC,"Disney should allow APs guaranteed entrance on their birthday.   I'm always so sad when I'm blocked out on my birthday, as it usually falls over spring break. I haven't been able to celebrate my actual birthday at Disneyland since I was 5!"
Disneyland,3d86hk,MeishkaD,9,Tue Jul 14 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"If you can stand to wait to renew, let your pass lapse and then buy a one day ticket. Go to the park on your birthday and upgrade then, even if the day is blocked out, you can enter on the day of purchase. My sister and her husband do this, but they also don't get a pass every year."
Disneyland,3d86hk,CleverNameUser,3,Tue Jul 14 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"To add to this, I've seen people who renew on a blackout day without even buying the one-day pass and they are given a ""blackout pass"" for that day so that they can enter the parks, so buying the one-day pass may be an unnecessary step."
Disneyland,3d86hk,MeishkaD,3,Tue Jul 14 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"That is good to know! I will tell my sister to look into it, would save them a step."
Disneyland,3d86hk,kelsey0403,3,Tue Jul 14 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is an old program. I called to ask about this, as my pass is up for renewal, and the lady on the phone told me that, unless the pass is not blocked out that day, you can't get in, even if you renew/upgrade. :-("
Disneyland,3d86hk,dastevonader,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:11:39 2015 UTC,"If that true, that's really lame. My cousin and I did this a couple of years ago. You're already throwing down several hundred. The least they could do is let you go to the parks on the same day."
Disneyland,3d86hk,Obi-Tron_Kenobi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"Really? That doesn't seem right. It's technically true for upgrading, though.  When I renewed my past two years ago, they told me that you can use your pass on one block out day a year. The reasoning back then was because if you bought a pass on a blocked out day, you'd still be able to use it that day. So, to make it fair, they allow everyone to use it on a blocked out day, even if you bought yours on a good-to-go day.  It's not something they go around telling people, as that was the only time I've heard about it.  Maybe it's changed since then, but my friend was able to use his on a block out day earlier this year..."

I do know that if you are planning to stay for a week at one of the Disney hotels, sometimes getting an AP will actually save you money. If they happen to be running a special for AP holders, the discount on a long stay can offset the added cost of upgrade. You need to have one AP holder who will both book and pay for the room. The only tricky thing is that they won't let you see if they are running a deal unless you log in as an AP holder. So I just have my sister log in and tell me what is running to see if it's worth it."
Disneyland,3d86hk,tenshi_73,6,Thu Jul 16 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like they should add 2 more Pinocchios to Fantasmic during his scene. One for each ""side"" of the viewing area.

Disneyland,3d86hk,mreford,4,Thu Jul 16 18:16:45 2015 UTC,I really wish they would open up an AP only entrance line at both parks. I bet it would go so fast.
Disneyland,3d86hk,izookie,7,Tue Jul 14 12:43:06 2015 UTC,I wish they would have a will-call booth to process the multi-day ticket pictures and print-out to day-tickets. That way the gates would be scan-and-go only.
Disneyland,3d86hk,disneylandmouse,3,Tue Jul 14 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think the reason they don't is because the visitors might go in the line, wait, and get to the front just to get turned away. It's their fault for not reading the signs, but it might happen and that might be enough to scare Disney away from the thought."
Disneyland,3d86hk,bubblesugarsocks,3,Tue Jul 14 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"They would most likely just let them in, once I accidentally got in the ""ADA/ECV wheelchairs only"" line because I am dumb and by the time I realised I was two people away from the turnstile and they just let me through. That said, I think a first-time entry is better, because it collects all the people who take forever in one line. APs and returning park hoppers take the exact same amount of time to go through the line. It's the people who need to scan from their phone and print tickets and get their pictures taken that hold up the line."
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,14,Tue Jul 14 14:41:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know how many times I've seen someone say this and I bet everyone here would agree with you. I just don't know if there are enough APs constantly entering the park to make it worth it.   Furthermore, YOU HAVE AN AP, that means you get to go any time you want. So, what's a few extra minutes in line when you have the LUXURY of returning tomorrow? Next week? Next month? That's a luxury many who visit the parks don't get."
Disneyland,3d86hk,mreford,3,Tue Jul 14 13:38:24 2015 UTC,"Your logic seems to indicate that because someone has an AP, they shouldn't get perks beyond the LUXURY of being able to return to the parks whenever they wish. Just because I have an annual pass doesn't mean I magically have more time to waste standing in line.  I don't quite understand that rationale. AP perks rarely exist anymore other than some early preview days when rides reopen and a few events that always take place in the middle of the week.   All I want is to be able to get in a line and not have to sit there because a family of 8 decides to give their crumpled printed tickets at the gates and the rest of us have to wait not only for them to be printed but for pictures to be taken and so on.   I doubt that's as much along an ""elitist"" demand as is being implied."
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"Just because I have an annual pass doesn't mean I magically have more time to waste standing in line.   And you think that everyone else in that line wants to wait in a long line to get in? No, not at all. What makes your time more valuable than anyone else's other than the fact that it's yours? Your AP in the long run is going to make the park less money than those who buy tickets at the gate and spend big money on hotel rooms and don't get those discounts on food and merch that you get.   Empathy is a real thing. Maybe offer to help those in front of or behind you through the gate if you think they might have some issues. I bet they would appreciate it."
Disneyland,3d86hk,crass_bonanza,3,Tue Jul 14 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"I think you may be missing the point of this idea and being quite antagonistic.  The point that is being discussed is to have separate entry lines that would perform the different functions.  For non AP visitors, there is a different set of procedures that include taking pictures, answering questions, etc., whereas AP holders are a simple scan and entry.  To set aside a specific line just for AP's would in all honesty probably decrease wait times for everyone involved.  Also, earlier you mentioned that there are not enough AP 's constantly entering the park and that is completely false.  Depending on the season, there is sometimes near 50% of attendees that are AP holders."
Disneyland,3d86hk,bubblesugarsocks,7,Tue Jul 14 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"That's why I've said instead of ""AP only"" just have a ""first-time entry"" line. Then APs aren't getting ""star treatment"", and even people with park hoppers don't take anymore time than most people with passes. It's the people coming for the first time who need their tickets printed and take pictures and sign their cards and to grab maps and ask questions about where to go who hold up the line."
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,-5,Tue Jul 14 21:58:42 2015 UTC,And I personally think that there are a lot of APs who are full of themselves and just want the star treatment wherever they go which is what new line would be. How would putting APs in a different line reduce the wait for an average guest? It wouldn't. Especially since like you said all they have to do is scan their card and go.   It's like when you're driving down the highway and get cut off. Do you get pissy and try and run them over or do you calm yourself down and realize that at the end of the day it's not that big of a deal? If you miss 5 minutes of Disneyland time because you have to wait for others is it really the end of the world? You're still at Disneyland!
Disneyland,3d86hk,crass_bonanza,2,Tue Jul 14 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know who is getting pissy here other than yourself, noone is trying to run anyone else off the road.  I am not even advocating for the separate line, because I never seem to experience very long gate wait times.  From a pure logistics standpoint though, if the lines were serving more specific functions then they would be more efficient. It seems to me that the only reasoning behind your argument would be to not give any additional perks to the AP holders."
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,0,Tue Jul 14 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting pissy at all actually. I'm trying to logically work through my argument with you. My statement was a metaphor for what it's like to wait in line. Why get upset at what's going on in front of you? Why stress out over that at all? So what if you have to wait?   As someone who is going to be a Premium AP holder soon, I'm all for more benefits to holders. But they have to be logical and not have an adverse effect on others."
Disneyland,3d86hk,crass_bonanza,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"Your metaphor is painting the initial person as being extremely upset by using a road rage analogy.  In my eyes it is logical to have picture taking, ticket printing, etc to have its own separate line. Also, even if the poster only wanted it for an AP perk there is nothing wrong with that either."
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:14:54 2015 UTC,My point is that as an AP perk it isn't needed and is something that I think APs should move past. Like I said in my top level comment. I've seen this exact same idea posted probably 4 or 5 times just this week.
Disneyland,3d86hk,RainbowMagicSparkles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think you have the terms ""annual pass holder"" and ""southern california resident"" confused. Just having an annual pass does NOT automatically grant the luxury of coming back tomorrow or next week."
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,3,Wed Jul 15 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"That's why I also included ""next month"". I get your point, but many Annual Passholders get to visit much more often than anyone else who happens to be waiting in that line."
Disneyland,3d86hk,MeishkaD,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"I think AP holders (specifically So Cal) and tourists have different feelings about lines. I have always felt the entrance lines move pretty quickly. I also have no problem waiting 30 minutes for a ride, my local sister passes on most everything above 20 minutes. Her idea of busy and too crowded is nowhere near mine. It's just a completely different experience.  That said, I really don't see why this would be a huge issue. I am sure Disney could run the stats and there would be some days this would be a huge help. I'm thinking the edges of peak seasons, and weekends that are open to So Cal passes. Seems like the So Cal folks are the ones that would stand to benefit the most as they are there most frequently, and I believe make up the biggest group of AP holders."
Disneyland,3d86hk,ohbleek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:58:01 2015 UTC,I agree with this and I'm an AP holder that lives two states away. My view hasn't changed since I purchased an AP and I don't see 30 min as a bad line but maybe that is because I still only visit ~4x/year.
Disneyland,3d86hk,verduccij,-4,Thu Jul 16 16:45:53 2015 UTC,I agree for separate lines only if you are a PREMIER annual pass holder. (The gold pass) Ok maybe add premium too.
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,0,Tue Jul 14 21:48:24 2015 UTC,I really wish Disney had a faster track on their Imagineering projects sometimes.
Disneyland,3d86hk,disneylandmouse,12,Tue Jul 14 13:39:32 2015 UTC,I've got to disagree. It takes time to make the fantastic attractions we ride today and if they need more time on a project I say they take it.
Disneyland,3d86hk,golf4miami,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:05:48 2015 UTC,"I think I'm going to do a whole write up on this because I understand with Disney there is a very, very fine line between providing the quality of product the fans deserve and taking too much time to bring something to market.   We are still more than a year away from Avatarland at Animal Kingdom and that project was announced two years ago. I've seen some of the updates and I've been blown away by them. I just think they probably could do what they are already doing on a tighter schedule."
Disneyland,3d86hk,ohbleek,0,Tue Jul 14 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"agreed, because it seems they still roll things out too early, and then things like the Hatbox Ghost don't work for 6 weeks despite only being around for 10"

Disneyland,3da9vu,electricladyslippers,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, any place where you're in the front is a great spot to watch the parade. To have this spot, you might have to get there almost two hours before the parade, I've been close to the hub when I watched PTN but many people say that a really good place to be at is by the flagpoles by the turnaround is a great spot as you just watch the parade that's coming to you. Another good spot is on Main Street, preferably closer to the turnaround but where you're still on Main Street seems to be a great view. That way after the parade you can watch the fireworks from where you are at and get to see the projections on Main Street. But yeah honestly anywhere you can be in the front is honestly a great spot."
Disneyland,3da9vu,mikeezy6,3,Wed Jul 15 00:16:57 2015 UTC,"After the fireworks, go to the bathrooms by alice in wonderland, directly across from the matterhorn.  Hang out there for a little bit and the parade will cruise right by you, while most of the crowds will still be on main st."

Disneyland,3d886t,katclarissa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"As early as possible (60 days) because there are 2 seatings per night (I want to say one is at 7 and one at 9 but that could be wrong), though I don't think it ever really ""fills up"".  Just call Napa (you have to call directly) and ask them for a reservation for the chefs table because you want to do the tasting menu, they'll know what you mean.  Oh and it's amazing. They ask your preference on proteins and flavors and you and your date will have different items so if you share, it's like you get 10 courses."

They'll give you an autographed photo and balloons at check in (or leave it in your room later).  Housekeeping will also do a honeymoon turndown service instead of the regular turndown service, as well.  White Water Snacks is the best value for your buck for prepared meals, and since they are carrying some more grocery items for the Villas, you can get some basic staples, too.  You can get one bagel from the bakery case for the same price as a 6-pack of bagels in the grocery section.  If you're interested in architecture, you can take the free Art of the Craft tour that goes over the hotel's design.  They also do a fitness walk into DCA before the park opens on certain days so it's completely empty."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,golf4miami,8,Tue Jul 14 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think you should keep in mind two things.   Imagineering at Disney World and Disneyland are two separate entities. They have separate teams, separate schedules, separate goals, and a similar but separate culture. I don't think looking at how Disney World handles things is a great way to predict how a Disneyland resort expansion will go. I would look at examples like the DCA overhaul or the 60th Anniversary plussing as a good starting point in a discussion on Disneyland's timetables. Keep in mind that Imagineering doesn't do as much in house anymore than they used to. They're mostly an art department with a bunch of industrial engineers and project managers, but actual technical design and fabrication is usually hired out nowadays. When you read about early Disneyland, you often hear about how quickly rides were built. They were able to do this because they kept everything in house and did things super simply and cheaply. The original Mark I monorail was a pickup truck with a weird chassis bolted on. You may hear a lot about Alweg, but really the only thing they took from them is the beam design. The wiring was hand done by one of the imagineers and I believe it almost started a few fires and stranded the train on the beam sometimes. This would never fly today. Now, most everything is handled by outside contractors, and that changes the timetables a lot."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Tue Jul 14 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Things being in-house vs. contracted out is a good point that I think I didn't give enough thought or consideration too. But I think that gives them even more reason to bring things back in-house or work more closely with those contractors to move deadlines up etc.   And sure they different entities but look at Cars Land like another user said. $1.1 Billion and 5 years to completion. Not too horrible and we got an amazing area out of it, but I still think the could have done it quicker."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,EagleEyeInTheSky,8,Tue Jul 14 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"The problem with bringing everything back in house is that they've never really had the technical skill in house to do stuff at a high level of quality, which is why almost everything is being contracted out in the first place.  Imagineering was always more of an artistry and design firm than an engineering firm."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,EagleEyeInTheSky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:40:23 2015 UTC,I mean they have structural engineers and architects on their teams.
Disneyland,3d9hxq,centracing,4,Tue Jul 14 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"An architect is important, but it's really just an artist with a different type of canvas.  Ride vehicles, control systems, fire and safety, mechanics, digital interfaces, manufacturing, construction etc, are all done off site with companies that know way more about what they're doing. I mean yeah, the imagineers are very involved in the process, but they operate in the conceptual world now, and for good reasons. But unfortunately, that means that while attraction quality is going up, that also means that deadlines are being pushed back. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Personally I'm much more of a fan of the current system."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,izookie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"From what I have gathered, being a mechanical engineer and looking into working for Disney, yes most of the grunt engineering and design is out sourced, but they still have people on staff that are specialized in those areas, mostly structural engineers, but they also have mechanical and electrical engineers as well to oversee the projects. Also I believe all of the AA robotic design and manufacture are done in house. I would imagine they also have people that can do general R&D work for special ""can this be done"" projects."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,Obi-Tron_Kenobi,4,Wed Jul 15 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"WDW New Fantasyland was rolled out in phases and acknowledged as a failure to keep the promotion level up throughout such a long period of time. DCA Carsland, on the other hand, generated a lot of excitement and attendance for the park all at once. I expect WDI to learn from this and for the next expansion to be slow but at least be announced as a unified project. DLR must break ground by 2017 but has 30-45 years to complete the project so don't expect to see anything in the near future."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,glitterwrists,4,Tue Jul 14 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"I can see why this can be disappointing. Especially if you compare it to Disneyland Park, which took only a year to build.   We can compare it to cars land instead, so it's not so disappointing.   Cars Land is another $1.1 billion expansion. It took only 3 years to build, and an additional 2 years from announcement to the actual construction, making it a total of 5 years.   Looking at that, I feel that this expansion won't be completed until 2020."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,YellowFox1852,7,Tue Jul 14 16:24:32 2015 UTC,"Disneyland was opened a year after construction started, but they weren't finished building. A lot of structures were incomplete and some rides could barely function."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"In fact, IIRC the cement wasn't even dry on opening day."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,AnubisEight,5,Wed Jul 15 06:31:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, they announced Haunted Mansion in 1961 and it didn't open until 1969. The outside was completed in 1963 so people spent 6 years pondering what could be contained inside.   I also think the original DCA serves as a cautionary tale against focusing more on deadline than quality. It took them 6 years from initial concept to opening and they just spent 5 extra years fixing it."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,MeishkaD,4,Tue Jul 14 17:27:48 2015 UTC,"Well, the circumstances surrounding the Haunted Mansion were unique to say the least. I don't think you can really compare that the construction of future attractions—Walt's not going to pass away a second time."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,trac54,3,Tue Jul 14 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"While I am sure that Walt's passing in 1966 had a hand in the delay, the attraction was initially supposed to open in 1963. They completely re-worked the ride after making advancements in ride capacity while preparing attractions for the 1964 World's Fair. The point remains that they didn't allow the initial deadline to rush them into presenting an attraction before they were ready."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,centracing,3,Tue Jul 14 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"Also want to add that Universal does a whole lot of ""paint jobs"" where as Disney starts from the ground. Universal always rebrands existing rides, which would cut time out of the picture!"
Disneyland,3d9hxq,Shatteredreality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Also the engineering for the ride system for Forbidden Journey was mostly completed in 2006 by the company that built it, before Universal was involved."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,centracing,2,Wed Jul 15 01:27:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that some of the timelines I've seen have seemed very slow when you consider the end result. Peter Pan is (I believe) a very good example.   The upgrades are great but I honestly expected more given the 6 months it was down (especially after the extension of the downtime).   That having been said I think Disney has some very interesting challenges that most of us don't think about.  A lot of people point out that Disneyland was built in a year and use that as an example of how fast they could go.   As someone pointed out when the park was first opened it was done as quickly and cheaply as possible, today this just wouldn't fly.   Disney now has a much bigger demand to make things ADA compliant and has to meet much stricter OSHA standards than the used to. This means design time is a lot longer since it has to go though more levels of approval.   Also one thing that we need to remember is that while they install improvement the park still has to be operational for guests. It may seem silly but this can make huge problems, especially when the upgrades are in the middle of the existing park vs an undeveloped area.   Ultimately though I think the biggest issue is that Disney suffers from Announcing Things to Early Syndrome. I know for political reasons they had to promise to break ground at a specific point in time but a lot of the time they could hold off on the announcement until closer to construction (once the full design is done) and it would make things seem a lot faster."
Disneyland,3d9hxq,dodgepodge,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"One thing that Universal does that Disney has only just started doing is withholding information, even until after ground breaks on the project. If I recall they had already started construction of Wizarding World before they announced it. I think Disney is doing this to a certain extent now, as we've had rumours of a Star Wars themed land for a long time now, but Disney is still going to take longer to build for all the reasons you mentioned.  Also with Avatar land I'd say the biggest variable was James Cameron. The land was supposed to open in 2016, and has now been delayed to late 2017. I suspect James Cameron is a very hard person to work with on something of this scale, and that was the major cause of delays. If they announce a Star Wars themed attraction I don't expect it to take nearly as long, as Disney has worked with Lucas Film many times in the past, and Disney owns Lucas Film now also so there shouldn't be nearly as many delays in that project, and you could probably say the same for a Marvel themed land."
Disneyland,3d69up,Ekkusu_x,6,Mon Jul 13 21:19:09 2015 UTC,Sounds like the Easter egg hunt. I don't know why they don't run promotions like this all the time. Maybe because they're printing enough money as it is.
Disneyland,3d69up,dodgepodge,6,Mon Jul 13 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting that they titled it ""The Looking for Mickey Quest,"" when something like ""The Quest for the Mickeys"" or something similar sounds a lot better. That, the fact that the link wasn't from ""go.com"" (which is Disney's official domain), and a few typos/grammar mistakes made me think this was fake at first... except the Parks Blog just made a post as well, word-for-word the same (except with the typos and such fixed).  In any event, it's still going to be similar to the Easter Egg hunt. You could just put up $20 for everything and scratch everything off to win, or you could actually participate. A lot of people liked to participate in the Easter Egg hunt, even if they didn't exactly have to (you got the stickers right away then as well, as far as I remember)."

You could try contacting someone who assists with his medical care and see if they know of anything (perhaps a doctor or nurse).   Disney is notoriously stingy when it comes to discounted passes (the only ""good"" deal I've heard of is for veterans) so I would be pretty surprised if this existed.   If it was something Disney has offered in the past it may have been discontinued as part of their effort to cut down on the abuse of the Disability Access System that they did a few years ago.   I wish I had better news but most likely your best bet is to check someplace like AAA that offers minor discounts on tickets."

I could barely see where I was, there's no way they'd be able to see. We ignored her. I felt bad for the kid, but if a good spot for your kids is that much of a priority you should get there early and not expect people who have been waiting to accommodate you."

Disneyland,3d4uw0,bubblesugarsocks,11,Mon Jul 13 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"I used to do that, but I'm never letting a kid in front of me again. Last week I let a kid in front of me for Sound and his mom thought that meant she got to come too. Later that night I had just a half a spot next to me on the curb so I asked the people next to me if they cared if the child behind me came and sat with us. Her mother had given her a glowstick--which she broke halfway through the parade. I looked down and wondered why I had little stars all over my dress and hair. Not stars. Blacklight water.   No. More. Children."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,glitzyjan,5,Mon Jul 13 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"I'm down with this plan as well.

The same parent who gave the child shitty glowsticks also handed me her phone and told me to ""take pictures!"" of her enjoying the parade.

I had been waiting for them to import this parade since it started in Hong Kong and it was the last day my pass was valid until August.  Literally two minutes before the parade started, people were walking around trying to get me to let them sit IN BETWEEN MY LEGS (um no, you really going to ask a lady you don't know for that?) and all I could do was be assertive. I had to be an asshole. The bench was placed (by Disneyland employees) all the way to the edge of the curb, leaving no space to sit below me.   The space that I had reserved and didn't need (I saved space for three others but I only needed space for two others) I gave to a very polite older lady who came up to me an hour before and nicely asked if she could sit with me.   Don't be afraid to assertively say no. People feel SUPER entitled at Disneyland and get pushy."

I decided to just stretch for a second and suddenly a group of teens though it was cool to shove their way in. They weren't blocking me, but they started to crowd the couple and literally lean on their stroller. I really can't stand entitled teens, so I decided to shove my body into the group of teens causing them to be separated, and the teen who lead the group got shoved into a group of tall bodies, so she couldn't see at all. The couple was happy I did that, and they stopped leaning on their stroller."

She was standing in front of me because she is short and I can see over the top of her.  This guy had an ancient video camera, the thing probably was running off of VHS tapes or something.  He just had to get a front row spot.  He just shoves his way through the crowd up to the front.  He wedges himself between me and the person next to me causing us to be jammed up against the railing.  I asked him what he was doing.  He didn't say anything back, I don't think he spoke English or at least pretended not to.  So I just put my hand in front of his giant video camera and stared him down.  He turned around and left.  That's about the only bad experience we've had, but I don't watch parades on main street usually.  We try to go over by Small World instead."

Disneyland,3d4uw0,Reneeisme,7,Mon Jul 13 19:08:42 2015 UTC,"My main complaint about our last trip was this.  Everything else I could deal with, but the unbelievable rudeness, thoughtlessness, classlessness, of other guests when it came to things like that, really soured the trip for me.  We were shoved, run over, and pushed back by people consistently.    My feeling is that DL is overcrowded.  If you watch videos of the parades and fireworks shows from just a decade ago, there's room.  The streets are lined one deep.  There's breathing room everywhere.  There are now so many more people who fight to see these shows, there is a frantic attitude that brings out the worst in people.  DL needs to re-think things like a third gate, or more frequent showings of ""events"" to spread out some of the crowd and return the atmosphere to one of cooperation, where everyone will have a chance to participate.  I don't go there to compete with people for a limited spot for a show, and lose out because I'm not willing to be super rude, or threatening.  That's too much like real life.   No sense paying a fortune for that disappointment."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,chicomandell,5,Mon Jul 13 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think they are slowly realizing this as they have created fast passes for Fantasmic and World of Color.  They probably should do the same with the Disneyland parades.  Have the desirable areas closed off to fast passes so for people don't have to wait all day to get a good seat for a 20 minute show, and you don't have people pushing in at the last minute."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,Reneeisme,4,Mon Jul 13 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"Except that they need to work on that too.  We were told we couldn't line up for Fantasmic, (had our fast passes but were chased from the area because it was before 8:00).  Came back at 7:50 to a huge line, got in it, waited till they started letting people in about half an hour later, and then watched people rush the front of the line from every direction, just pushing past those who had been patiently waiting.  No cast members intervened and it was pretty clear that some people were going to go to blows over it.   After we realized we were literally going to be the last people to get in for the reserved seating, and that things had the potential to get violent, we gave up and left.     A better system is desperately needed.   Or at the least, consistent applications of the rules are needed, if you are going to make rules.  I can't tell you how that experience disappointed me.  Not because I didn't get to see Fantasmic.  I've seen it before; it wasn't the end of the world (although we made considerable effort to get the fast passes and to show up early).  But in Disneyland's management of the situation.  To refuse to police the line, or to police it inconsistently and therefor punish those who follow the rules, just tarnished the magic for me."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,chicomandell,2,Mon Jul 13 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"I've only seen the new World of Color show once, and that was the one after the park had closed so it wasn't probably as crowded as the earlier show.  This was probably 2 weeks ago on a Friday night.  We didn't have fast passes so the cast members directed us to a section off to the side where we could still be up by the railing.  At least at that time they were keeping people in check.  I saw CMs having people move out of spots that they weren't supposed to be in and things like that."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,hunnyycakes,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:06 2015 UTC,Did they do fastpasses for the opening months of World of Color?

Disneyland,3d4uw0,Reneeisme,2,Mon Jul 13 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"more frequent showings of ""events"" to spread out some of the crowd   Given how bad traffic gets for these shows, I'm reticent to agree that making MORE shows in the central entrance core is a better way to go. I think that opening up the back lot for passage during the shows is a good idea, but I haven't been there when they've had that in effect to see if it helps."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,MaLaCoiD,2,Tue Jul 14 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, but I remember when there used to be an early parade (near noon) and then a much later one.  That earlier parade didn't draw the crowd they do now, and while the parade would be going on people could still easily stroll down Main street, shop, eat, etc.  I wish they could figure out how to get back to that more relaxed attitude.  I don't know if the crowds are just that much bigger now, or if it's something about bunching the parades up at the end of the day when people are tired and possibly cranky, or have overstayed their patience because that's the only chance to see the parade, that drives the selfish rude behavior.  Same for the fireworks and Fantasmic/World of Color.  Going back to more events in the day time might relieve some of that over crowding.    I know why the parades are stacked in the evening now (to show off the lighted effects) but maybe a third parade in a second version (without the lights) would take some of the heat off?  The daytime parade at CA is much more laid back and it's possible to get a decent viewing vantage point up to practically the start of the parade.  I enjoy that much more."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,epotosi,9,Wed Jul 15 00:21:19 2015 UTC,The social dynamics of Disneyland are very interesting. Start the conversation from a place of empathy. Maybe they really don't understand they're being inconsiderate. Is there a way you can both be happy?
Disneyland,3d4uw0,Chewbaccas_Bowcaster,20,Mon Jul 13 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Here's how I pictured that conversation going:  ""can we push in here?"" ""I'm sorry, I've been standing here for 2 hours for this view."" ""But I want to see the parade too, as does my small child."" shoves small child forward. ""I'd be happy to let your child watch in front of me, since they won't block my view."" ""I can't be separated from my child! you must let me stand with them!"" ""Again, I have been waiting for this parade in this particular spot for 2 hours."" ""So!? I had to get these rides in - it's my last day here and I paid a ton for this vacation."" on and on...  Yeah there's no way this conversation goes well.  You have to hope the other person is reasonable, and they're usually not when they're trying to shove forward to see the parade."

Disneyland,3d4uw0,bubblesugarsocks,3,Mon Jul 13 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"YES.  This.  The lack of empathy is exactly the issue.  Empathy is a two way street.  The fact that other's can not imagine what was involved in securing a good spot, what rides you didn't go on, or meals you didn't eat, characters you didn't wait for ect, is the problem.  They only know what choices they made, and felt they had to make, and can only evaluate the situation in light of them."

Some punk who had gotten there around 12.45 cuts through the crowd and chases after me (or so it felt like), just as I sit down and throw my purse down to save a few seats, he yells, ""WHAT THE F--""  I had barely comprehended what had happened and stammered out, ""But...

Anything to make the kid's vacation a little more magical. Like the quote says, even the most unhappy and desperate people aren't trying to to be that way on purpose. They are just tired, hungry, and scared. I'm willing to offer that kinda sympathy, especially if I can just go back to Disneyland the next day after work and check out the fireworks again.  Either way, I feel like humanizing the perpetrators goes a long way. That's just me though."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,incride,2,Mon Jul 13 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"That's awefully considerate for you to have that kind of mindset. If more people thought like you, the parks would be that much more enjoyable."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,graffixphoto,4,Mon Jul 13 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"Last week I knudged a little boy forward to stand next to my younger son so he could see the Soundsational parade. His mom was appreciative and polite. I use our stroller to block off our spot so it isn't usually an issue for us. I hope to not encounter the folks you guys are talking about, but since we have AP's, we don't stress having to have the best view since we can always go another time."

Disneyland,3d4uw0,stacasaurusrex,4,Mon Jul 13 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"My wife an I waited about an hour in the street in front of the castle for the fireworks to start. Everyone was standing as there was no room to sit down, and about ten minutes before the show was to start, and elderly man aggressively grabbed me, and some other guy next to me, and started shouting at us to move. He said that his family had been sitting by the Partners Statue for 3 hours, and we just came and cut them all to get a better view. We asked him why on earth they would wait for three hours IN THE BACK OF THAT PARTICULAR VIEWING AREA, AND NOT THE FRONT, and he yelled in my face that it didn't matter. It turned into an ugly scene with the other couple and the old man screaming at each other in the crowd. I wanted to go find security, because he had put his hands on me, and harassed my wife and me, but I didn't want to miss the show we had waited for ao we moved down a bit to a much worse spot. The old man and his group were shouting at everyone between the partners statue and the ropes in front of the castle to sit down cause they had waited 3 hours. They were absurd!  I get the frustration of people cutting and pushing, but just because you waited for X amount of time does not mean you get to sit wherever you want and expect people to not stand in front of you if there's room, or to sit down if they do. You are not in control, you are not my boss, and you certainly shouldn't put your hands on me or my wife."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,izookie,3,Mon Jul 13 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"It happens all the time. Disneyland invites a lot of people from different cultures who have a different standard of manners. Sometimes guests would ask me to talk to them. Most guests would listen, but sometimes theyd cause a huge scene. But if that one set of bad guests disrupt the experience of others, id always try to address the issue."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,Bijanadactyl,3,Mon Jul 13 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"I and my two other friends waited an hour and a half in our spot for the parade. An older couple stood behind us waiting, clearly trying to shove in front of us. It all ages apparently that get pushy, literally. My friend was bumped and nudged several times, but didn't budge. The wife then loudly complained to her husband that she was getting hit by my friend. We got fed up with the complaining and finally said something- told the couple to relax, we all want to see the show, and stop shoving us.   They eventually stopped, but speaking up helped."
Disneyland,3d4uw0,ddbaxte,3,Mon Jul 13 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"People need to be told in a direct and firm manner when they are being rude. No name-calling or yelling. Some people simply come from places with different cultural norms. Keep in mind, the excitement of these shows can make kids (and adults) forget how to act like humans. I know that in China, I was pushed around by old ladies and children on the street and it wasn't anything unusual.  I can imagine that it would be very frustrating to find out that you'd have to wait for 2+ hours to see a parade. I have seen videos from (non-CA visitors) people who are frustrated where they believe that locals monopolize the good spots because they have all day to just save a spot. Disneyland has a reputation as a locals park and if that also mean locals being aggressive or territorial, I know I wouldn't want to save up to visit. This is the reason why I don't really like Hawaii (aggressive territorial locals).   I hope everyone can be understanding but be willing to guide overzealous visitors (instead of being passive aggressive)."

Disneyland,3d4uw0,EarthAngel007,2,Mon Jul 13 20:01:22 2015 UTC,"i had a little kid shove his way between me and my goddaughter/family watching PtN last month. They were sitting on the curb, i was standing behind them. i was also chatting with some other AP holders i'd met while saving space pre-parade. This kid comes out of nofreakingwhere, shoves his way in, and not only does he shove his way in physically, he shoved his way into our conversations as well. He kept interrupting (why is it that some kids think it's okay to interrupt you mid-sentence, and saying ""excuse me"" is enough?), inserting non sequiturs, trying to swing his light saber around (in a SUPER crowded area). When the parade started, his two smaller siblings all of a sudden joined us. They proceeded to step on my goddaughter several times, and shoved me closer and closer to the light pole i was standing near. Mom was sitting in the back, in the seating at Carnation Cafe and clearly not caring. We had to tell the older one several SEVERAL times that he needed to back down, we were all trying to see, and stepping on people is pretty rude. (esp. since during the worst of his behavior was when Belle's float broke down and there was literally nothing to see here)  If he'd asked, or if his mom had asked nicely, i would have had no problem making room for them. But the rudeness of the physical and conversation shoving just left a really bad taste in my mouth. They tried to follow us into the fireworks to continue their behavior but i put a quick stop to that with a physical stance. i dunno where they watched the fireworks, but it was certainly not in our party.   Meanwhile two nights before, during WoC the couple next to us motioned that there was a really great spot that was just the right size for my goddaughter/her mom to stand next to the railing and get a better view. We thanked them profusely and my goddaughter got a great view of WoC. i let them go since there was only room for the two of them, and my view was fine where i was. (plus, her mom/my bestie is shorter than me, so folks could still see over her :))  i don't mind squishing over for polite folks. If you're going to be rude though, expect to receive back in kind. All of us paid good money to be there, and we all want the same experience. If we all work together, we can all have the same awesome experience. Otherwise... you'll get what you send into the universe. Plain and simple."

Then you either text that to the provided number or enter at a tablet location somwhere near the entrance of the park before 11 am PST. At roughly 11am they will send a text to the winner (not sure how they notify tablet entrants) and you have one hour to follow instructions to pick up your prize. I think that's everything, but I am sure you can find more at the diamond days website. Good luck and post photos if you win something!"

Disneyland,3d5huj,Renbail,5,Mon Jul 13 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Here are the guidelines.  A bit of advice: I would steer clear from trading with other park guests because you're new to it. It's very easy for people to take advantage of you, so I would just stick to trading with cast members."
Disneyland,3d5huj,dodgepodge,3,Mon Jul 13 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, I only say stay away from the ones who ask you to go buy whatever expensive pin they want or only look for your single limited edition or hard to find pin. Yes, avoid the shark traders, but not everyone is like that. Feel free to decline whatever you feel may be a bad trade.  For myself, I treat my lanyard like a cast member, give me a pin for whatever pin you want. Now I don't put ""rare"" stuff on there, but I do keep a lot of older hidden Mickey pins on it, as long as my sister doesn't lay claim to every single one..."
Disneyland,3d5huj,TaonasSagara,3,Mon Jul 13 23:28:32 2015 UTC,"Most pins will be available at the park when you arrive. You can look up the pins over at PinPics and they should tell you whether or not the pin is a limited edition (will sell out quickly) or an open edition (will likely stick around for awhile). As an example, this diamond pin was a highly sought after pin that has long since sold out. This mystery pack pin is an open edition that is not currently sold out and still available for purchase. The prices at Amazon will be higher than at the parks, so only order if it looks like it's a LE or they indicate if it's sold out. You can also always contact Disneyland parks merchandising at (877) 560-6477 to inquire about merchandise and they may even be able to ship you items that are not limited.  Here is a page with the official pin trading etiquette posted by Disney. It's fairly basic information, but good to review. You can also pick up flyers with basic trading information in the parks I believe.  Some people like to wear one lanyard for display and another for trading. You can also just politely decline any trade that you choose. If you have pins on display just for show, it helps to point those out right away.   PSA: Any large lots of pins available for cheap purchase on Amazon, eBay, or similar are going to be scrappers. Scrappers are conterfit pins that come from a variety of sources. Yes, many can be traded with CMs in the parks, but the ethics of doing so are questionable at best.  Come join the fun over at /r/DisneyPinTrading !"
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, quick question. Are the 60th Anniversary Pins highly prized after by the Pin treading community and how much money for a single pin is too much?"
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,3,Mon Jul 13 22:56:08 2015 UTC,It really depends on the pin. The diamond LE's like I linked are insanely hard to come by (waiting in line practically over night) the mystery pins and OE not so much. Is there a particular pin that has caught your eye?
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,2,Mon Jul 13 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"The Diamond pins grab my eyes from Amazon and I wanted to buy this And a few of the Diamond pins. This is going to be our Honey moon week at Disneyland and I think I'm just hyping up for anything Disney related. I live in Phoenix and she has never been outside of the state. I myself, last went back in 2009 with the family.   Now that I'm older, I want to try new things there and Pin collecting sounds like something I could get into it. Obviously, I'll buy more pins at the park and trade with CMs. But the idea of getting rare/limited pins by special events and circumstances baffles me. Like I hear stories of people getting a pin randomly, very special pins that you can't get in a store, etc. So that is what excites me."
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,3,Mon Jul 13 23:14:28 2015 UTC,"That is way too high a price for the starter lanyard, at least in my opinion. I really think you should be fine waiting on that one.   The diamond pins like this one seem to be going for about $60-75 dollars on eBay. They were sold for $15.95, so I suppose whether the mark up is worth it or not, is up to you. I would just double check that anything you are paying a mark up for is not OE and then shop around for a good price.  Fair warning about trading with CMs, many of the pins on their boards and lanyards are scrappers. The ones who know try and remove them, but a lot of them can't spot the differences. Personally I like to collect for fun and not profit, so I really don't care so long as I like the pin. I would not however, trade anything of great value with a CM pin unless I knew for sure what I was getting. They sell pins in blind mystery boxes for a lower price than the individual pins just for trading.   You really just have to ask yourself what value you put on your pins. Everyone feels a bit differently, so go with your thoughts and don't worry what anyone else says. If a trade feels right to you, do it! If you don't think you will be happy, politely decline.  CMs tend to have the best selection first thing in the morning from what I have been told. Do some research ahead of time to look for the obvious signs of scrappers and you should be fine. Unless you are feeling very confident in your previous research, avoid trading with guests that have very large binders full of LE pins. At best, they will just not be interested in what you have, at worst they might take advantage of your naivete. It is against Disney rules to request someone to go buy a pin in trade for one you have on property. If anyone asks you to do this, decline. They are likely not a very honest individual.   I know there have been pins in the past that CMs could give for excellent guest behavior, but I don't know if they are running anything similar now. There are special pins only available to annual passport holders, that can only be purchased with Disney movie reward points, given at the end of guided tours, etc. The CMs are your only source for hidden mickey pins. Here is a page that shows the most recent set released in Disneyland."
Disneyland,3d5huj,GingerKidd,2,Tue Jul 14 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"I am currently planning an anniversary trip and I love doing the research. Let me know if you have any other questions as I supsect there will be plenty of overlap in interests. My most recent trip was last March and let me tell you, so much has changed since your last visit. DCA in particular is like a brand new place."
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jul 14 03:01:49 2015 UTC,"How does one start pin trading? We are going to the park in September, and I'd like to casually trade, but not sure how I get started.. Are pins and lanyards I totally purchased in a store?"
Disneyland,3d5huj,GingerKidd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"Disney sells starter lanyards and packs for the purpose of getting started. You can sometimes find good deals at Disney stores but it is really hit or miss. I have heard that there are some good sellers on eBay or facebook that will sell mixed lots for a few dollars per pin, but you would need to research them before trusting. Anything you order from Amazon or eBay that is a large lot of pins for less than a buck a piece is going to be 100% scrappers.   Once you are at the parks you can also buy blind boxes of pins that are cheaper per pin than buying individually. You won't know which pins are in the box, so that is another great way to get started. Pick a series that you like and buy a few boxes. Trade away any doubles or pins that you just don't love."
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:49 2015 UTC,"Perfect, thank you. Any place specific in the park to look for them or are all over in multiple shops?  I kind of like the idea of a blind box. Like I said, I want to be casual with it so starting with a hodgepodge sounds fun!"
Disneyland,3d5huj,Pinklette,2,Tue Jul 14 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"They have pins in many places. There are even a few stores/kiosks devoted just to those. Most stores will have a rack or two of pins as well. I saw the best varieties of blind boxes at the locations devoted to pins. Disney's Pin Traders in Downtown Disney is a great first stop, particularly if you are not heading into the parks on your arrival day anyway."
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:02 2015 UTC,Are the blind boxes only available on site? Do you know how much they cost?
Disneyland,3d5huj,Pinklette,2,Tue Jul 14 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"I believe they are only at the resorts. I don't recall the prices off the top of my head (there are different sizes of boxes/bags with different numbers of pins). I do believe they average out to a little over $5 per pin. With single pins starting at about $9, that's a good deal for traders, but still not a bad idea to buy sets where you like the pins you might get. If you spend $30 or more at the pin stores you can also buy an additional mystery pin for about $3 I believe."
Disneyland,3d5huj,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jul 14 06:30:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! One more question, if you don't mind, do you know if they try to make sure there are no duplicates in the boxes?"
Disneyland,3d5huj,Pinklette,2,Tue Jul 14 13:16:05 2015 UTC,"As far as I know they do not. But that is half the fun. If you get duplicates you immediately have one to keep and one (or more) to trade! There are some fun unboxing videos on YouTube if you search for ""disney pin mystery bags"""

Disneyland,3d0jtm,gigabyte898,2,Sun Jul 12 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"They might be using some kind of matrixing / edge-blending system that failed part way. If each side of the street is its own ""screen"" in the system, perhaps that failed instead of the projector.  Interesting stuff."
Disneyland,3d0jtm,upwut,3,Mon Jul 13 14:09:30 2015 UTC,"During the annual pass holder event a few years back for World of Color the entire system broke. They were projecting video on the water fountains and everything seized up. The projector stopped, sound repeated a single note like a broken records, and half the fountains either shut off or went full blast. They tried resetting twice but eventually gave up and cancelled."
Disneyland,3d0jtm,gigabyte898,2,Sun Jul 12 23:57:05 2015 UTC,I was there for that. The next time I saw the show I was so anxious during the part where it froze.
Disneyland,3d0jtm,dukenuk12,2,Mon Jul 13 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Someone took a video of it  The show runs on SMPTE Time Code, so when you stop the show, it doesn't always stop at once. SMPTE Clocks are Linear and can't rewind in live entertainment.﻿ When they ""Cancel"" the show, elements come offline in a sequence: Projectors, Fountain HPUs, and finally, Show Lighting. The show is stopped individually as LTC only keeps the consoles in sync, not pause or rewind them. IIRC they use a modified version of DMX512"

Disneyland,3d0jtm,gdraper99,4,Sun Jul 12 18:29:34 2015 UTC,"They use Christie projectors because they have the $$$$.  I would assume DLP, but I wouldn't think the resolution is higher that 1080p.  When you're projection mapping onto a building rather than a screen, higher resolution tends to be wasted by the loss of an even field.  Shows and Soarin' use 4K 3-chip DLP Christie projectors."
Disneyland,3d0jtm,kliff0rd,3,Sun Jul 12 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"FYI, Soarin does not use DLP. They upgraded from 15/70mm film projectors to the new IMAX laser projection system. Source  (Still 4K, I believe... but I don't know the specs of the new system off the top of my head.)"

Disneyland,3d2wqg,epotosi,2,Mon Jul 13 12:25:16 2015 UTC,"I've only done the upgrade process once (Premium to Premier) and it took maybe 10 minutes on the high end. And much of that time felt like it was for them to go get the other card stock for the printer.  Going from a park ticket to an AP should take less time. And just buying an AP outright is even faster. Be prepared to write out your name and full contact info for them. That's probably the slowest part.  If you already have your theme park ticket, you may want to go into the parks in the morning and head to the ticket booth mid-day to do the upgrade. Mornings are often busier at the ticket booths."
Disneyland,3d2wqg,stevensokulski,2,Mon Jul 13 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"I swear, I've been behind people buying an AP, and it took a freaking eternity. They were buying more than one, and trying to set up payment plans - just madness."

Disneyland,3d2g86,booboothechicken,5,Tue Jul 14 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"They did this once, some years ago. They've also done promotions where you bought a 2-day ticket and go a Disney Gift Card as a discount.  Worked out great because you could use the price you paid for the ticket (which was full retail) towards an AP and keep the gift card.  That only lasted 2 years or so, I think."
Disneyland,3d2g86,mreford,3,Mon Jul 13 14:19:03 2015 UTC,They don't sell them.
Disneyland,3d2g86,Lindsay71105,3,Mon Jul 13 04:00:09 2015 UTC,The only time I've ever seen anything Disney related is in their travel brochures. Unfortunately those are typically only multi-day passes accompanied by hotel accommodations.
Disneyland,3d28t9,UNLV_GRAD_SOON,6,Sun Jul 12 22:59:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. The apartment has been replaced with the Dream Suite above Pirates of the Carribean. I, too, was pretty sad when I found out about the change but the guide assured us that guests seem to like the Dream Suite much better as Walt's Apartment is just a modest little square studio. The Dream Suite was spectacular. Hope you have your reservations already! Have fun!"
Disneyland,3d28t9,izookie,2,Sun Jul 12 23:52:30 2015 UTC,eh... I've been in both and while the Dream Suite is nice it has too much to see during the limited tour time.
Disneyland,3d28t9,JalenJade,2,Mon Jul 13 02:11:38 2015 UTC,So..how long did they end up including Walt's apartment on the tour?  Couldn't have been but a few years.
Disneyland,3d28t9,UncleNad,2,Mon Jul 13 04:48:12 2015 UTC,It's been a few months when they were making the passage behind Main St. It was supposed to be temporary but guests gave positive feedback about the Dream Suite. I was pleasantly surprised. I would love to see Walt's Apartment but I understand it was just a crash pad when Walt was working at be construction site.
Disneyland,3d28t9,izookie,4,Mon Jul 13 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"It is a small apartment, but to me it's more than a crash pad. It's the spirit of Walt Disney, as he slept in that apartment during the construction and opening of Disneyland. I always get emotional looking out that window, just as Walt did on opening day, knowing that dreams can come true.  However, visiting the Dream Suite is pretty spectacular and also rich in Disney history. I think it depends how enthusiastic you are about Disney heritage."
Disneyland,3d28t9,BunnyThumper,2,Mon Jul 13 06:18:48 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see the apartment but I wouldn't call the changes in the tour a deal breaker."
Disneyland,3d28t9,izookie,2,Mon Jul 13 06:33:00 2015 UTC,Very true! The Dream Suite is definitely worth seeing!

The Disneyland tour focuses on Walt's Disneyland and the DCA tour covers Walt's arrival in California and the way the areas of the park tie in to the studio history. They both include a meal (quick service, value probably around $15), 3 ride walk ons, and a pin. Aprox. 3 hours.  $59 for the Discover the Magic Tour   This tour seems designed for children and families as it includes a scavenger hunt throughout the park and ends with a character meet and great. It includes a snack and a couple attractions. You receive a collectible medal on a lanyard at the end. Aprox. 2 hours.  $49 Cultivating the Magic Tour   This tour focuses on the horticultural history and practices of the park. Typically includes special tours on Jungle Cruise and Storybook where your guide speaks specifically about the plants of the attractions. At the end you receive a pin and a special seed packet. Aprox. 2 hours  $25 Welcome to Disneyland Tour   Includes a tour through both parks helping to introduce you the lay of the land and how various systems (such as fast pass) work. Includes premium viewing seats at a show, reservations for a meal (price of meal not included) and fast passes that can be used at any time.   $80 Happiest Hants and Holiday Time at Disneyland Tours  Offered seasonally (obviously) these tours focus on the holiday celebrations at Disneyland. They include attractions, and holiday specific treats. At the end of your tour you are given a pin that is unique to the year in which you took the tour. Aprox. 2.5 hours.  NOTE: There is a 20% discount for AP holders, and I believe Disney Visa, military, and possibly AAA members although I am not sure on the last as Disney recently ended their relationship in regards to trip booking discounts."

Disneyland,3d28t9,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jul 14 03:33:59 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we will do Walt's Footsteps next time we go.  Sounds really amazing and we get an AP discount! :)
Disneyland,3d28t9,chicklette,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:30:12 2015 UTC,"I am crossing my fingers that one of the included attractions will be Peter Pan as it was down for refurbishment this spring and it is my husbands first visit. I know they have walked people on during the tour in the past, but it seems there is variability in which attractions they include. Looks like the meal is at Jolly Holiday which I adore. The pin is beautiful as well. Worth every penny it seems, particularly when you are getting the discount!"

Disneyland,3d28t9,Ferniekicksbutt,4,Mon Jul 13 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"https://disneyland.disney.go.com/au/tours/  I can't recommend the Walk in Walt's Footsteps tour enough. They have altered it fairly recently. It used to include Walt's apartment in the Firehouse and stepping inside the old lobby (and JUST the lobby of Club 33). Now it forgoes both of those in favor of  a full tour of the Disney Dream Suite above Pirates of the Caribbean, which is MAGICAL! The guides are full of information, the audio portions of Walt speaking about his dreams for the park are very poignant (it might make you cry, as it did me) and the tour also includes a great lunch, drink, and dessert at the Jolly Holiday Bakery. It also includes front of line access to several original park rides (that were there since opening in 1955). You also get a special souvenir Walt Disney pin. It's the most expensive tour (at around $75 per person), but is absolutely worth it for Disney lovers. Especially if you are going for several days or are an annual pass holder. I highly, highly recommend it!"

Like foodservice and custodial, it just gives you some benefits that most areas won't get.  You should just keep checking on the Disney Career Site for most positions. The best time to start would be in the fall which means you should turn in your application in August or even now if you want to get a head start. Don't be picky about what you want, I wanted to do attractions and the lady that I interviewed with told me that I should do custodial and I love it!

And it's the only land that you can rent a room and ""stay the night"" there with a view of Grizzly Peak."
Disneyland,3d1hut,EagleEyeInTheSky,6,Mon Jul 13 04:48:43 2015 UTC,Fantasyland.  It's the most magical place.

Disneyland,3d1hut,evanescentglint,5,Mon Jul 13 00:54:17 2015 UTC,Whenever I just need to sit and relax I head to New Orleans Square over looking the Rivers of America or Grizzly Peak.   I love the feel of Adventureland but I can't relax there.
Disneyland,3d1hut,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,2,Mon Jul 13 04:03:15 2015 UTC,You used to be able to go hang out in the Alladin's Oasis area in Adventureland up until recently.  No one really knew you could go in there so it was usually empty even on the busiest days.  The last few times I've gone it's been closed.

Disneyland,3d1hut,SnarkMasterRay,2,Sun Jul 12 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"New Orleans square or adventureland. NOS because it is home to 2 of the greatest rides in disney history, and adventure land because of the excellent theming"
Disneyland,3d1hut,sports_is_life,2,Mon Jul 13 02:12:29 2015 UTC,Is Hollywood land a place? Or is it an avenue in DCA? All I know is I love the shops there and the animation academy. It's really cool watching the artists they have at Off The Page do the sketches you can commission.
Disneyland,3d1hut,Bijanadactyl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:37:12 2015 UTC,As far as a land goes probably Tomorrowland because I'm a huge sci fi and especially Star Wars fan.  For a place to just hang out for the ambiance I'd say Main Street.  The music and everything is just so great.  I like to sit on the benches in middle or up on the railroad area when you just need to hang out for a while.

Little did I know how awesome it turned out to be. What the paintbrush does, for people who don't know, it changes the color of the light up Mickey ears and also changes the colors of other peoples paintbrushes!! I soon found myself having random light battles with total strangers and it was the best  time I've ever had at Disney!"

The best battle we had was with a girl maybe around 12 that started over in Cars and ended just before we left California Adventure. She was super sneaky and would ambush us when she saw us coming. I can't wait to go back and wear them again.

Disneyland,3czgby,kethryvis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"MAYBE if/when the ""new park"" opens, the one that Disney promised if Anaheim wouldn't make them charge a gate tax. But even then i doubt it. Disney places a lot of blame on AP holders it seems; we're the bane of their parking system, their 24 hour parties, their traffic, etc. etc. etc. DLR has more passholders than WDW iirc, and they've really been trying to cull the herd over the last few years (the removal of the SoCal AP, the constantly raising prices, the removal of features, etc.)   i'm expecting even more measures in the coming years, just seeing how crowded the parks continue to be, and how much they seem to place that on AP heads."
Disneyland,3czgby,stevensokulski,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:23:31 2015 UTC,New park?? Tell me more!
Disneyland,3czgby,ddbaxte,2,Sun Jul 12 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"There's not a lot of details. In essence, Disney promised to spend $1 billion on new attractions, etc. and a new parking structure (most likely at the Pumbaa parking lot, but again, no concrete details) if Anaheim would continue to exempt them from a gate tax.  The city council passed the exemption, 3-2. Disney now has two years to begin construction, and an additional seven to complete it.   No one is really sure what the $1 billion will build; DCA cost just under $1 billion when they built it the first time. (and another $1b to get it right) So the rumour is some kind of new park. Another rumor (possibly unrelated, possibly not) is the ripping out of Toon Town to make way for a Star Wars themed land. But this is all pure conjecture and rumour. What Disney will actually do is only known by Disney, and i'm not even sure they're 100% yet."
Disneyland,3czgby,cricketmcfly,3,Sun Jul 12 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of rumors, but the talk of a new park doesn't seem to have any traction these days. And Star Wars is getting bounced around the resort via the rumor mill like crazy.  I've always shook my head at the ToonTown / Star Wars rumors (even when they seemed like a sure thing ~6 months ago) because that land has to close before fireworks. No way Disney is going to build one or more E-tickets and a whole new land in a part of the park that has such a limited operating day. But we shall see!"

Disneyland,3cxqfj,JalenJade,2,Sun Jul 12 07:39:32 2015 UTC,I did this one of Main St. but it's only 4.5 minutes long...I guess you could put it on replay! :-/ https://youtu.be/rXrA8P-lFa4
Disneyland,3cy5y6,ohsnapitzjudy,3,Sat Jul 11 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"Go earlier. I'm taking about 9:00pm early. There will be too many people. I've gone to all of them. Last months was the worst with crowds. I got there at two and the line was too long. Of course I still got my pin. Thanks to a friend.  Edit:  1. No place to park that early, I believe. You can park in Mickey and friends the day before.    It'll be closed at the time. Yes, you'll need a ticket."
Disneyland,3cy5y6,ChetsWorthFonzo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:10:53 2015 UTC,Is it ok if I park my car at downtown disney and leave it there overnight past disney hours?
Disneyland,3cy5y6,ChetsWorthFonzo,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:55 2015 UTC,I've definitely seen people do that before. So I assume yes. I'm not going to give a definite answer because they always tweak their rules by every month.
Disneyland,3cy5y6,counterstrike_evox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:59:35 2015 UTC,What do you mean you need a ticket? Is there one for this specific event or is an annual pass sufficient?
Disneyland,3cy5y6,mildly_interesting,2,Sun Jul 12 18:11:30 2015 UTC,You need a ticket to enter the parks. A pass will suffice.
Disneyland,3cy5y6,ChetsWorthFonzo,2,Sun Jul 12 21:01:32 2015 UTC,An annual pass is perfectly fine. Those who don't have a ticket to the parks on that day can only attend the DTD pin store. If they still have the wrist band selection for it.
Disneyland,3cy5y6,ranoutofbacon,2,Sun Jul 12 22:44:07 2015 UTC,"I wish I could have gotten them, but sadly it wasn't meant to be. Looks like I'll have to resort to extortion-bay"
Disneyland,3cxg9h,PJTUX,3,Sat Jul 11 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure about (1), but as far as (2), you can go up to any cast member with a camera to have your picture taken on the spot. Your pic is no longer printed on you AP card and the card itself doesn't have an expiration date, meaning you will still hold on to that same card next year should you renew your pass. When you enter the park at the turnstiles and hand them your AP, your pic will pop up on their screen."
Disneyland,3cxg9h,true_majik,3,Sat Jul 11 22:24:22 2015 UTC,No You finish paying entirely at the ticket booths. Any Photopass photographer in the parks can shoot your photo for the pass. Your photo is no longer printed on the pass. It just shows up after the pass is scanned.
Disneyland,3cxg9h,dodgepodge,2,Sat Jul 11 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no. It could only be applied on the day the ticket was used. Assuming you purchased your AP online then you go to the Main Entrance ticket booth and pick up your AP card. Then you find any PhotoPass CM and have them take your photo. I got mine taken at the Photo Processing Center in DCA - not sure if they still do it but they should be able too."
Disneyland,3cxg9h,jeff4L,2,Sun Jul 12 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"After you get your AP card, go straight to the turnstiles and they will have your photo taken right there."
Disneyland,3cxg9h,heyawildchild,2,Sun Jul 12 03:01:54 2015 UTC,Alternatively!  If someone visits on a blocked day (pays entrance) can they upgrade that day to a AP pass that doesn't include that day?  $99 for weekend day Then upgrade to SoCal with weekends blocked?
Disneyland,3cxg9h,trac54,2,Sun Jul 12 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can just buy the pass (even SoCal) at the ticket booth and get in that day, even if it's a block out day. No need to ""upgrade"" later because the down payment you make on the pass acts as entrance for the day."

Disneyland,3cvh1i,Pinklette,6,Sat Jul 11 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"Plenty of kids come in with masks like that: Star Wars, Power Rangers, etc. BUT the ones I remember seeing were always the half masks fastened by a strap or rubber band, not ones that fully enclose the head. I think those are the ones that are outlawed."
Disneyland,3cvh1i,dodgepodge,2,Sat Jul 11 09:24:28 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the mask and how the CM interpret the rule.   Last year we saw a guest with full head gear as the  old man character from Up.   Was an awesome mask, and it covered the full head and face..But the other 99.999% of the guests had no masks or mask that met the requirements.  There is so much you can do with a little face paint.  one has to weigh the disappointment of not being able to wear the full costume in the park, vs a painted on mask, or you having to carry the mask all evening."
Disneyland,3cvh1i,valiamo,2,Sat Jul 11 17:43:55 2015 UTC,I've also seen a guest in complete mask of chewbacca.  He was for sure a guest he was holding hands with a non disney character while strolling down main street
Disneyland,3cvh1i,adagrl,2,Sat Jul 11 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"It's also going to be dark, so a mask with a shaded face panel may not be something he'd really want to wear through the park at night anyway."
Disneyland,3cvh1i,fivefootmama,4,Sun Jul 12 01:26:04 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I believe this would apply to him. Think of this as an opportunity to get creative! He could be Luke or Han Solo disguised as a stormtrooper or the new stormtrooper character from episode seven, or even one of the troopers from The Clone Wars. If he refuses any of those ideas you could always try face paint. I'd also just try it and see if anyone stops you. The worst that would happen is they ask you to bring it back to the car. Then a dramatic reveal... It was Han all along! Someone secure the princess!"
Disneyland,3cvh1i,kidgun,2,Sat Jul 11 08:11:48 2015 UTC,"Lol! I love it!  He didn't even wear his helmet most of last year, so I'm not sure what I'm worried about, lol."

It's sort of amazing how long the character's been around, but as far as I can tell, he's never been seen in a Disney Park. Technically, he predates both Mickey and Oswald."

Disneyland,3cuflw,GingerKidd,7,Fri Jul 10 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"At Disneyland, the Submarines have been themed to Finding Nemo. The Matterhorn, Big Thunder Mountain, Alice in Wonderland, and Peter Pan have all had refurbs and new effects added. Star Tours has been re-done and renamed Star Tours the Adventure Continues.   Across the esplanade, at California Adventure, they have redone pretty much the whole park. The Maliboomer is gone, they added a Little Mermaid dark ride, and Toy Story Midway Mania, and added a new whole land themed to Cars."
Disneyland,3cuflw,RockemSockemCronuts,3,Fri Jul 10 22:06:32 2015 UTC,"Cool! Thank you. I knew about the cars land... Is it still crazy popular? I had a coworker go (not super reliable on info) tell me you HAVE to get a fast pass for the radiator spring ride...like you can't just wait in line for it..any truth to that?  Also, super excited for the little mermaid ride. Little mermaid was my jam when I was a kid."
Disneyland,3cuflw,golf4miami,4,Fri Jul 10 22:11:23 2015 UTC,If you want to ride Radiator Springs Racers without much of a wait you have to either 1) get there early and do it first or 2) get a fastpass which you also have to be there somewhat early for.
Disneyland,3cuflw,justkate2,3,Fri Jul 10 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"The land itself is less crowded, but the RSR line is always long. You can either rush in first thing in the morning for a fast pass (the fast passes are usually out very quickly), you can wait 90 minutes plus (most weekend lines are still like this) or you can opt for the single rider line - you'll usually still be in the same vehicle, just not right next to each other. My SO and I do this all the time. We've never waited longer than 20-25 minutes in single rider."
Disneyland,3cuflw,evanescentglint,3,Fri Jul 10 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"Cars land is spectacular and very similar to the movie. You don't need a fast pass for radiator springs but lines are usually 80+ minutes. As is the lines for Peter Pan, because it was recently reopened.  Little mermaid is great and usually line-less. You really feel like you're underwater."
Disneyland,3cuflw,evanescentglint,3,Sat Jul 11 05:21:12 2015 UTC,"You should watch all the new shows, especially the fireworks. You can catch the fireworks after the first parade on Main Street for the perfect view. There is snow, Matterhorn turns into a volcano, and buildings grow tentacles. You can then catch Fantasmic right after the fireworks and get a closer view for the 11pm paint the night parade.  Star Tours has been updated to have different random parts that occur between episodes 3-4(?) but some of the hidden mickeys in the waiting room have been removed (scorch marks and bins), but new ones added.  The decor is also all sparkly too."
Disneyland,3crsfs,QueenRosey,2,Fri Jul 10 06:39:14 2015 UTC,I haven't been to Disneyland in over 10 years! I was 16 when my parents took my sister and me and it was amazing. I remember getting in the park before it opened and we just ran all over the place. Rode Tower of Terror like 5 times. It was one of the best family vacation we had.   I moved to LA about 4 years ago and I haven't thought about Disneyland until I saw the 24 hour celebration on live stream. Something clicked and I really want to go back! I'm hoping to go mid September. This subreddit is my happy place.

Fit in a moment or two for some Dole Whip/Float by the tiki room and use that time to people watch.   Most of all, and I promise it will make all the difference in the world to your trip...talk to Cast Members, tell them it's your first time back in 15 years, let them know about your experience so far, not only are they super friendly but also very knowledgable and will share with you some history of the park and particular rides you are on, and who knows...they might surprise you with something special.

Disneyland,3ct1fc,chicomandell,12,Fri Jul 10 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"For the popular rides (Radiator Springs, Indiana Jones, etc) use the single rider lines.  You will get to ride the ride in 10 to 20 minutes even on the busiest days.  A lot of times you will get to ride in the same vehicle as someone else in your group, but just not right next to them.  Much better than waiting 90 minutes for a ride where there are no fast passes left."
Disneyland,3ct1fc,chicomandell,2,Fri Jul 10 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool! They didn't even have Fast Pass last time I went so all of the line stuff will probably be a little new to me ^ Thanks!"
Disneyland,3ct1fc,chicomandell,3,Fri Jul 10 18:54:42 2015 UTC,Take advantage of the Fast Passes when you can.  If you have a park hopper you can get Fast Passes for both parks at the same time.  Also on the Fast Pass it will tell you when you can get another Fast Pass for another ride in the same park.  The only issue with Fast Passes is that they go quickly and for some rides the line for the Fast Passes can be really long as well.
Disneyland,3ct1fc,justkate2,9,Fri Jul 10 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"Also don't waste time waiting for the early Paint the Night parade.  The one at 11 is much less crowded and you can usually get a front row spot about 10:15 to 10:30 in the area around It's a small world, even on a weekend night.  Usually if you ask a cast member very nicely they will guide you to the best spots.  It's a great parade and it's awesome seeing it up close."
Disneyland,3ct1fc,evanescentglint,3,Fri Jul 10 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"And double thanks for this tip, I really want to see that parade! I'll probably let that be the last thing I do and just go to the late one. XD"
Disneyland,3ct1fc,chicomandell,2,Fri Jul 10 18:54:59 2015 UTC,I second this - see the fireworks and then the later parade. Gives you plenty of time to get into a good spot. I made the mistake of trying to do the earlier parade and then fireworks and ended up in the worst possible spot for fireworks.
Disneyland,3ct1fc,evanescentglint,2,Fri Jul 10 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"I think the second parade is at 12 for this weekend. (I will check) The parades are indeed 8:50pm and 11pm for paint the night.  However, waiting for the first parade on Main Street gives you a good area for fireworks at both the its a small world and Main Street viewing areas. You can always just hustle."
Disneyland,3ct1fc,divided_by_0,2,Fri Jul 10 22:34:00 2015 UTC,"We've gone the past 2 weeks on Friday and Saturday and it was at 11.  It still shows the park closing at 12 on the Disneyland website.  Just ask a cast member to confirm the times just in case.  DCA has the World Of Color show after closing so I guess it's possible that they have a parade at that time, but I doubt it since they usually want to give people ample time to shop at the end of the night. :-)"

It's a small world has the volcano during the nemo part, Main Street has tentacles during little mermaid, Fantasmic has back to back shows with the fireworks as intermission, and the courtyard you can see projections on the castle.

Maybe the ""autograph book as your souvenir"" one is creative.  The ""find a way to not pay $17 for parking"" is pretty good advice too.

A cast member walked her to the front of the line and she got the best seat ( last row closest to the exit doors) and got to be the rebel spy! She was so excited!"
Disneyland,3cqzhy,rm8ty,2,Sat Jul 11 03:24:40 2015 UTC,I've been the rebel spy in the first row.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,afx114,8,Sat Jul 11 07:45:48 2015 UTC,My wife and I had him introduce a show at the Tiki Room a few years back.  Can confirm it was great.  Think he was in the Haunted Mansion at some point that same trip too.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,hopatista,2,Fri Jul 10 07:03:05 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I don't think he's ever at the Haunted Mansion anymore. I've seen him on Main Street doing crowd control recently, too."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,dodgepodge,2,Fri Jul 10 23:08:34 2015 UTC,"Just want to confirm, I was at the AP Indiana Jones anniversary and the creator of the ride confirmed the back row left seat is the wildest seat. He says the entire ride is programmed in that seat."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,dodgepodge,22,Fri Jul 10 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"How wet your party gets on Splash is based on the weight distribution in the logs.  Did you put your 90 lb 7 year old in the front, with the adults all the way in the back? You're probably going to get a couple of sprinkles.  Did you put your heaviest member in the front seat? He's going to take all the water right into his lap. Have him pass his cell phone to someone in the back for safekeeping.  It's all based on whether the nose pitches up or down based on the relative weights of the passengers."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,EagleEyeInTheSky,16,Fri Jul 10 09:36:26 2015 UTC,if you have a 90 pound 7 year old you have bigger problems than getting wet on splash mountain.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,kerouac5,4,Fri Jul 10 20:22:54 2015 UTC,Are they supposed to be bigger or smaller? I honestly don't know.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,EagleEyeInTheSky,8,Fri Jul 10 21:07:45 2015 UTC,Smaller. Definitely smaller.

If your socks get wet, even on a hot day you will get blisters walking around with them.  We usually bring a backpack to carry stuff like that and a few waters.  You can always toss it in a locker if you get tired of carrying it around later."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,chicomandell,22,Fri Jul 10 17:58:37 2015 UTC,"For the vets, some of the tips may appear to be no-brainers - but for first timers, these are all so important!  Including:  GO AT OPENING.  If you go at opening, you'll get more done in the first 2-3 hours than in the following 5 hours.  Plan to go on many of your ""must"" big rides within the first hour or two.  Avoid less-popular rides, you'll be able to get those in later.  Make use of the first hours in the park before the real crowds form.  Some people tell themselves ""I'm on vacation, I want to sleep in!"" - fine - do that on a non-Disney day.  Be there at opening.  Not pulling in at opening - at the gate, in line, at opening.  Unless you are a local with an AP that can go anytime they'd like, the best possible experience for you would be to be there at opening.  Please first timers - please!"
Disneyland,3cqzhy,LDSaustin,13,Fri Jul 10 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"Being in the park at opening is just a magical experience for so many reasons. Being able to ride more rides. Being in the park when it's much less crowded so you get better views of everything. If you haven't done it, it should be your #1 priority for your next trip."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,golf4miami,4,Fri Jul 10 15:35:11 2015 UTC,Plus the little announcement over the PA gets me pumped up for the day.

Disneyland,3cqzhy,mwriteword,14,Fri Jul 10 03:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna dovetail off of this one and recommend that you try and visit one new food place on every visit.  There's so much good food in the parks, it's really easy to pick one good thing and just eat it every time you go. However there's a wealth of different places to try and each one typically has something unique. You never know, you might find a new fave."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,mreford,8,Fri Jul 10 12:53:27 2015 UTC,Yea I tend to get stuck on Dole Whip but I know there are many other great snacks in the parks.

We've been trying to branch out but our standbys are Rancho, The gumbo/chowder window ing NOS, Corn Dogs, and Cafe Orleans in DLP.

Disneyland,3cqzhy,Shatteredreality,5,Fri Jul 10 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"Two new discoveries for me: Jolly Holiday has a lot of good desserty snacks. I went in for a Matterhorn Macaroon (never tried it before) and ended up going back for a few of the pastries I saw. Also Riverbelle Terrace (I think it's called) has sausage biscuits and gravy, my favourite breakfast, and it's like $7 with an AP."

I'm not too keen on crowded places with no reservations but we decided to do the wait.  So so so well worth. The bar food was insanely good, the bar itself had every drink I could ever want (including my all time fave Smoked Turkey), and the barkeep was a pretty awesome dude. The locale can't be beat as well.  I've been going to DL/CA for a few years and I totally regret not coming here sooner."

My pro-tip is to look to the side (I think the right) when going down the big hill on California Screamin'.

Disneyland,3cqzhy,trac54,12,Sun Jul 12 03:32:44 2015 UTC,Try to time a ride on Matterhorn during the fireworks show. It's an incredible experience.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,aceattorneymvp,6,Fri Jul 10 17:11:52 2015 UTC,I'm also a fan of doing this on Thunder Mountain.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,CleverNameUser,2,Sat Jul 11 02:48:11 2015 UTC,I go on Thunder Mountain during Fantasmic. Shorter lines by far.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,PeggyOlson225,3,Mon Jul 13 15:39:44 2015 UTC,This happened to me totally by accident the other night and it was really amazing.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,ectomimedbison,3,Fri Jul 10 19:45:53 2015 UTC,Works for Splash Mountain too
Disneyland,3cqzhy,LA_Drone_415,2,Fri Jul 10 20:17:43 2015 UTC,Can you still ride the Matterhorn during the fireworks now that all the projections are happening on it?
Disneyland,3cqzhy,bubblesugarsocks,3,Sat Jul 11 21:26:23 2015 UTC,I did just a couple of weeks ago!

Disneyland,3cqzhy,dodgepodge,10,Fri Jul 10 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"If you have an annual pass, try to go during a rainy day. Mind you, this tip was from 20 years ago when they were celebrating their 40th and had all the trading cards, so I had to go for 40 days in a row so we could get two sets, but there were no lines for the rides, and there are plenty of indoor rides to still have a ton of fun even if it is raining."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,cherryfizz,3,Fri Jul 10 15:49:50 2015 UTC,I second this! If you're lucky enough to go during a rainy weekday (especially when it's not summer break) the parks are basically deserted. (Even more so when it's a little chilly too)
Disneyland,3cqzhy,pantyl,6,Fri Jul 10 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"I went once on a rainy Tuesday in February and when we walked into DCA my first thought was ""we're sure this park is open, right?"" Not a soul in sight. Incidentally, the other lesson I learned that day - don't ride California Screamin' in the rain, unless you enjoy feeling like someone is throwing gravel at your face."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,theatrephile,2,Fri Jul 10 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"My mom and I went on rainy days as often as we could! We even ditched work/school on occasion, just because it was raining and we wanted to go to Disneyland :)"
Disneyland,3cqzhy,hunnyycakes,2,Mon Jul 13 21:52:42 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not raining if  you go on a weekday during the fall, unless it's right around one of the holidays, it will usually be dead.  It's the best time to be able to take great pictures of the park and make it look like it's just you who are there.  You can tell your friends they opened it specifically for you. :-)"
Disneyland,3cqzhy,chicomandell,9,Fri Jul 10 20:19:28 2015 UTC,"If you want to ride a ride that's near a show/parade route wait for said show/parade and enjoy the short line while everyone else watches it. (Only for those who are there for more than one day/AP'ers.)  Plaza inn is a decent spot to watch the fireworks, provided you can manage to get the correct table between the bushes and can put your foot down to idiots who deem the traffic line is the place to stop and watch. (I swear these people can find the blind spot of the CM's 98% of the time...) This might be moot however for the new Fireworks show due to the fact there's a lot of stuff happening on both Main Street AND the castle so you're only getting half a show.  Plaza inn is also the place to go on the cheap for large groups. One chicken dinner is enough to feed two people for the price of one. Also, you get refills!  Also also, on the fact of the new Fireworks. Small World is the best place to view them and get the whole show. You're sacrificing Tinkerbell and Nemo, but at least you don't have to crane your neck in order to see the main street building projections and the castle's."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,trac54,7,Sun Jul 12 03:34:48 2015 UTC,"Most food stores that have a drink fountain will give you a cup of water for free, no need to buy bottled water."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,Chewbaccas_Bowcaster,3,Fri Jul 10 16:42:28 2015 UTC,To add to this - most of them will give you a large-size cup of water if you ask. The default is the regular but you can usually get them to size it up.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,theatrephile,9,Fri Jul 10 19:41:26 2015 UTC,"Park at Toy Story Lot! It's easier to get to than Mickey & Friends and it's less congested. Plus, on hot days the shuttles/buses are fully equipped with air conditioning and it's just not as crazy as waiting for a tram. Best find ever!"
Disneyland,3cqzhy,gussiubao,3,Fri Jul 10 17:28:05 2015 UTC,Also it seems like a shorter distance to the shuttles for some reason. Maybe because you're not in a roofed parking garage?
Disneyland,3cqzhy,Ekkusu_x,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:39:44 2015 UTC,Possibly! Seems like a farther distance walking to the Mickey trams too!  I think the buses go pretty fast as well though :)
Disneyland,3cqzhy,gussiubao,2,Sat Jul 11 10:54:53 2015 UTC,I will never ever park at Mickey & Friends! Toy Story (or if Pumbaa is open) are the best! Great advice!
Disneyland,3cqzhy,hunnyycakes,10,Mon Jul 13 21:56:43 2015 UTC,Know where the restrooms are. Stay hydrated & fed. Go early. Stay late. Use the parade to catch shorter lines. We once did Space Mountain 3 times & played a game of air hockey in 30 minutes.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,randomzinger,8,Fri Jul 10 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"YES, stay hydrated.  That's absolutely the difference between feeling miserable and exhausted for a good part of the trip, and enjoying it all.  People who are unused to spending long blocks of time out of doors don't realize how much more water your body needs when you do so."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,Reneeisme,3,Fri Jul 10 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"I second that.  We bring a small cooler in our backpack with 2 or 3 waters and some ice packs to keep them cool.  Both myself and my wife do this and usually lasts us the whole day.  If the backpacks get to be a pain you can always toss them in a locker, but we're used to it and the more water you drink the lighter the backpack gets :-)."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,chicomandell,3,Fri Jul 10 18:17:34 2015 UTC,They under estimate the sun's power to drain energy. Just cuz you're spending most of your time in line doesn't mean you aren't exerting yourself.
Disneyland,3cqzhy,randomzinger,9,Fri Jul 10 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"I also just realized this thread is desperately missing DCA tips. If you have a Disney Visa, you can visit a special meet and greet with a character and get a free 5x7 photo. The Disney Rewards website says the meet and greet is ""offered daily 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM at Hollywood Land at Disney California Adventure® Park (behind the ""House of Ice"" and next to Monsters, Inc.

Disneyland,3cqzhy,swgca,6,Fri Jul 10 16:58:30 2015 UTC,If you go with small children let them wear their costumes! Cast members go out of their way to make their experience special. They always call them prince or princess. It makes my little girl grin ear to ear!
Disneyland,3cqzhy,rm8ty,2,Sat Jul 11 03:31:32 2015 UTC,I don't think that's exclusive to small children. I'm very much an adult and I always get called princess when I'm there. :) Perhaps it helps that I'm always wearing Mickey/Minnie ears and an ear-to-ear grin on my face when I'm there...

Disneyland,3cqzhy,CletusTSJY,5,Fri Jul 10 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"Nope. Right after you enter, there's a place to wait that's across from the Main Street train station. Just wait there and hop on. There's a sign saying what it's for. There's also a little car, and a double-decker green(?) bus."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,PeggyOlson225,5,Fri Jul 10 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"Use the toilets between Alice and Matterhorn. In my opinion, they are the least crowded, and cleanest. AND there is a water fountain there for refills."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,bubblesugarsocks,6,Sat Jul 11 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to navigate Main Street when it is crowded go through the stores instead of trying to fight the traffic on the street, especially if people are lined up for a parade.  There are a couple spots where they don't connect all the way through depending on what side you are going to take, but in those cases just pop out on the street and then back into the next store to keep going.  Sometimes when it's really crowded they will open an alternate path behind the stores that will allow you to bypass Main Street all together.  Look for the cast members waving people through behind the store areas."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,chicomandell,2,Fri Jul 10 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"The parade chaos is brutal, especially with small kids. Pushing a double stroller while holding my 5 year olds hand was impossible."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,chicomandell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the people that are camping are new visitors that use their ""not fun"" family member to reserve spots."
Disneyland,3cqzhy,trac54,5,Sun Jul 12 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"For a faster and more out of control feeling, ride in the back of Thunder Mountain and Matterhorn.   Also, speaking of Matterhorn, the left side feels more out-of-control and faster than the right side.   To save money on food, you can bring in sandwiches or sandwich making ingredients.  Except plastic utensils - just bring packet condiments or small squeezable condiments and just make sure to pack them in a small, portable cooler.   Always try to be between 5-15 minutes early to an attraction you got a fast pass on, especially during busy days. The size of the park and lands can trick you into thinking it takes you a short amount of time to get to your ride when it actually can take longer, especially dodging crowds and waiting for lagging, tired family members.   Try to at least - in either park - ride a fast ride at night. It's a completely different experience than during the day and it can actually be more terrifying because the darkness of the night sky can trick your senses into it being faster in the turns and steeper in the drops than it really is - I personally call it the Space Mountain effect.   Do routine family checks and rollcall, especially with easily distracted younger kids and teenagers. Can't count the number of times we're 10 minutes into a land and we realize we've lost a brother or sister somewhere.  It's also good to set a destination somewhere in the parks to go if you get lost and for everyone to meet up at.   Finally, forget about your life outside and live in the moment. Forget about work, debt, college and high school, breakups, and the other sad things in life and just throw yourself into the magic that is the park. It literally is a healing to the soul and you'll feel so much more refreshed and happier at the end of the day instead of trying to put up a brave front and worrying about everything.   edit: Changed it to left side of the Matterhorn. Got my sides mixed up lol. Also added some more tips."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,disneywizard,4,Sat Jul 11 16:16:37 2015 UTC,OH OH I JUST REMEMBERED ANOTHER TIP AFTER READING OTHERS.  Coke Corner has perfect icecubes for putting into water bottles to keep them cold. They fit right into the mouth of any 16 oz water bottle so you can fill the bottle with ice then put in a free cup of water to let it chill!
Disneyland,3cqzhy,Ekkusu_x,4,Sat Jul 11 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"The Dole Whip booth at the Tiki Room has 2 lines, one inside the Tiki Room waiting area and one outside. The inside line is usually much shorter, particularly right after they let people into the show room."

Disneyland,3cqzhy,AXPendergast,3,Fri Jul 10 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"My tip:   Remember why you're there BEFORE you walk into the park.  If you're trying to cram in all the rides w/o really enjoying the Disney experience then - in my opinion - you're wasting your trip.   Part of the magic is experience the magic.  Take the time to just park yourself on a bench somewhere and just take it all in.  Strike up a conversation with a stranger. Ignore your diet.  Look up while you're walking instead of down.  You never know what you're missing until you take a slow stroll through the entire park.   (disclaimer: of course, these tips make more sense if you own an annual pass.)"
Disneyland,3cqzhy,dodgepodge,2,Sun Jul 12 15:38:19 2015 UTC,Saw one about restrooms and I thought I'd add this one: There are restrooms near the entrance to the Tiki Room. Go up the stairs (they're not off limits during the show) and to the left.

Disneyland,3cqecq,angelcat00,6,Sat Jul 11 06:53:15 2015 UTC,"...raises hand.    I'm one of those.  I didn't make my first trip to Disneyland until I was in my early 20's, before then it was known in my family as some sort of wonderous mecca. Then, we brought our own kids here at least once or twice a year when they were young.  They're grown now, and their schedules rarely mesh with mine.  My wife grew up in southern California and is now fine with a trip to the park every few years or so.  To me it's still quite magical, so every few weeks I spend a Sunday morning there, having breakfast in the park before wandering around and taking in the sounds and smells, sometimes not even going on more than one attraction.  Maybe spend the day taking photos, maybe just sitting at Coke Corner and listening to the piano player, or maybe just sitting on a bench and people watching."
Disneyland,3cqecq,h_lehmann,5,Fri Jul 10 03:38:27 2015 UTC,"Going alone is my preferred method too, but I never turn down a chance to go with friends and family.  But as one of the few unmarried with no kids people in my circle, I cant wait for them to afford to go.  When the alternative to going alone is not going at all, I'm in the parks every time.   And I never, ever, feel like I stick out. I love Disney for that."
Disneyland,3cqecq,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,4,Fri Jul 10 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"I practically grew up in the parks.  When they offered the annual passes, my mom bought one for me and my then-boyfriend.  We went often, and eventually, he proposed in the park.  The relationship didn't last, and before long, I was cruising the parks solo.    Had a bad day at the office?  It's nothing an hour on the rivers of America can't fix.  I rode Indiana Jones more times than I can count!  I've since relocated, but went solo a few months ago when I was in LA overnight for work.  It was as glorious as I'd remembered.  I wish the writer felt as at-ease as I do visiting the parks solo.  It truly is a magical experience."

Disneyland,3cqecq,Foodforthought26,3,Fri Jul 10 07:21:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow... less than 2 months to my first solo trip (and second trip ever), this article is great. It makes me a little excited, a little apprehensive, but most of all, I want to believe!"
Disneyland,3cqecq,jellyfishes28,7,Fri Jul 10 08:27:42 2015 UTC,"You'll feel a bit uncomfortable being there by yourself at first, but it'll be a completely different trip experience from the ones you've made with others. I've had other guests ask me if I'm alone and I've definitely lied about it, saying something stupid like ""my family all had Fastpasses on another ride"" or something, just because I felt too awkward admitting that on that day I couldn't find someone to go to the park with me.  But as time goes on, I've met a lot of people in the parks just being there by myself. There's lots of solo visitors in the park that you never really notice until you're there by yourself. I can always see solo guests kind of in the background now, just sitting on benches, observing the park, engrossed in what's around them instead of being part of a conversation with a group.  And, the cool thing is, is that the more I go alone, the less awkward I feel, and the more I feel less alone. I've struck up tons of conversations with other solo riders. I've been able to relate to them as APs and can talk with them about the park in a way that even a lot of my family, who have APs but don't visit by themselves, can't relate to. There's been a few times where I've met other solo visitors only to see them time and time again through the day on different rides or just walking by on the street and being able to wave to them, like we're in some sort of solo guest fraternity. I've met new families and got to be a part of their lives for a few minutes just by being seated with them from a single rider line. One time it was late at night and I was riding GRR and got seated with a family who I had a total blast with, and their family asked me to join them to ride it two more times in the normal line, which was really touching. You go there and you think that you'll be this outcast and as long as you're willing to open up and socialize, you can find a group to hang out with, at least for a few minutes. It was kind of symbolic that on that day I was wearing a Stitch shirt, which I thought was cool looking back on it. Once I had an Asian family in the handicap line ask if I wanted to join them to get through the single rider line faster(and take the eighth seat in their group so they get an even assignment on Indy), and then had a total blast with them on the ride itself.  And more importantly, you can do what you want to do in the park, without any social pressure. Do you want to just sit on a bench and sip coffee in the morning? Sure, go right ahead, you won't be the only person doing it. Do you want to run around with a journal and catalog all the hidden mickeys that you can find to publish on the internet? Sounds fantastic. Do you want to try to hit literally every single ride as fast as you can? You can probably get it done faster using single rider lines, and you won't have anybody to tell you no. Do you want to sit in the back row and do stupid shit for the on ride photo and see people's reactions at the exit? Hey, I've seen people buy photos just because I did something stupid in their photo.  It's a unique experience, and it really lets you look at the park the way Walt looked at it when he lived there, and was just able to stroll out onto Main Street in the morning just as if he was going out to get his paper. You get to enjoy the nooks and crannies of the park that aren't seen by families getting tugged around by hyped up children, and you get to see yourself in the background of thousands of people's days. Sometimes I feel like it's the closest I can be to being a ""citizen of Disneyland"", not counting the buttons that they give out to deserving guests, and according to cast members I've talked to, anybody who's worked in custodial will agree that it's a special feeling.  BTW, the custodial cast members are awesome and have made me want to apply to work in custodial soon. There's lots of cool cast members I've been able to meet just because I wasn't attached to my own family at the time."
Disneyland,3cqecq,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Fri Jul 10 10:17:25 2015 UTC,Sometimes its just fun to watch people. One time I saw a well dressed couple wearing Ferragamo. Shoes go for $500.

Disneyland,3cp8a1,crazy550,6,Thu Jul 9 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"Another thing about giving away fast passes. I have a big fear of people. The first time I tried to give away my fast passes, 2 people gave me a look as if I was some kind of drug dealer and slowly replied, ""Nooooo"". So now instead of giving them away by hand, I place them on the fast pass machines so that they are standing up and facing the next person who comes."
Disneyland,3cp8a1,crazy550,5,Thu Jul 9 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"Bless people like you! When I took my daughters to Disneyland/California Adventures for the first time, one of the rides we were looking forward too was the Cars ride. But everyday, the fast pass would sell out by the time we got there in the morning and the lines would go right to 2-3 hours which we were not waiting for with a 5 and 9 year old. Granted they enjoy every other part of the park. But the last day we were in CA, we were walking around about 3 hours to park closing and had to use the restroom. No real conversation other than getting a snack somewhere. But when we came out of the restroom though, some guy walked up to us and said ""I overheard you were looking to get on the Cars ride"" and handed us 3 fast pass tickets for the ride 20 minutes from then. The girls, and I, were super excited! We were able to get right on and pass the 2+ hour line and it was the ""best ride ever"", as they said. So again, thank for your sharing your fastpasses!"
Disneyland,3cp8a1,msshirow,6,Thu Jul 9 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, the only time I ever end up having them with me after the trip is over is if I forget about them in a wallet or my backpack.

It's kind of like collecting all game tickets if your a season ticket holder to a particular team. I understand collecting a ticket to a memorable game or something (maybe game 7 of the world series), but i'd put fast passes up there with a rookie spring training scrimmage."
Disneyland,3cp8a1,clevername71,4,Thu Jul 9 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"Getting fast passes from people is the most magical thing that has happened to me at Disneyland. Took GF for her first time to Disney, so of course try to do everything at least once. Unfortunately it was extremely crowded day so it wasn't going to be possible, was only able to get a couple of fast passes throughout the whole day the way the timing worked.   A group of friends saw us oggling a line near the end of the day, talking to the CM about the length. We decided to give up and started to walk away. A couple of the people who saw us go through this ran up to us and gave us two fast passes for the ride. Was almost in tears how ecstatic I was.   So all I can say is to encourage people to give away fast passes if they don't use it, if they have any doubts or hesitation about doing so."

Disneyland,3cquso,therodfather,5,Fri Jul 10 01:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'd advise you to stay off site, but in one of the main gate hotels. Pricier than farther out, but still significantly less than on property.   Our usual October game plan is 3 days in park (usually non-hopper) and a Halloween party. The morning of the Halloween party we sleep in, hit the peach (or do other touristy things), and then get dressed up and head to the party around 3 (earliest you can get in with the Halloween party tickets.) This gives us about 3.5 days in the parks total which is usually good for us.   We try to get a hotel that includes breakfast, and has a fridge and microwave. That way we can save some money on food. But you should eat in the park. The food there is worth the expense.   All told we usually drop around $2,500 total, but we have two kids, one of which needs his own ticket, lol. So your mileage may vary. ;)  Good luck, and congratulations!"
Disneyland,3cquso,Pinklette,3,Fri Jul 10 03:34:41 2015 UTC,Minus the kids you just described our October plans exactly. Your kids are troopers to make it that many days.
Disneyland,3cquso,Fuzi0n,2,Fri Jul 10 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"They are, but we like to take it easy and not push them. What's the fun in stressing out the kids? We did a crazy one day last-minute trip once and that backfired SO FUCKING BADLY! lol.   I think we're still recovering…  This way we can take the time to really enjoy the park and all the magic that goes in to it. And if we miss something, we miss it. But we've also stumbled across many interesting events we didn't know were happening this way. If you don't get to everything in this trip chances are that there will be another chance. And if there isn't, does it take away the enjoyment of what you did experience? There's always something bigger and better coming. No regrets, just enjoyment. <3   (And get the 'Just Married' and 'First Visit' buttons. So cute, and cast members will go out of their way to help the magic happen!)"
Disneyland,3cquso,Pinklette,2,Fri Jul 10 16:46:52 2015 UTC,Accost as in don't approach you? I would say stay at an offsite hotel. About a mile away and $50 a night. I stayed at days inn by jack in the box and had no complaints. Then take an uber to the park $5-$6 per ride plus you don't have to deal with parking and extra walking. There's tons of ubers nearby so you won't have to wait long. You might also want to look on here for food recommendations and decide a few meals you need to try and splurge on those and go cheap the rest of the day. You could even not to go DCA.
Disneyland,3cquso,_treebeard,3,Fri Jul 10 04:36:31 2015 UTC,I'm a SoCal local so not sure about hotel specifics.  We went to Disney World for our honeymoon.  Since it's your honeymoon It's worth it to pay a little more to stay at a Disney property in my opinion.  It just adds to the rest of the experience.  Staying at some random hotel wouldn't have been the same.  A couple hundred extra bucks here and there won't matter years down the line.
Disneyland,3cquso,chicomandell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"Stay on site!! And not at paradise pier. It makes a huge difference in your experience. Yes it's expensive but it's your honeymoon, just do it once and you won't regret it. You can rent timeshare property at the grand Californian and it's actually pretty affordable. Also go to a Mickey Halloween party."
Disneyland,3cquso,jennafezz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:04:41 2015 UTC,You can rent a timeshare for 3 nights in October at the grand for around $800 last time I checked prices.
Disneyland,3cquso,jennafezz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"We also spent our honeymoon at D'land (among other places traveling up/down the coast) back in 1985.  And, we celebrated our 30th anniversary at the park as well, just this past April.   Both times, we stayed off property and were quite pleased.  Many, if not most, of the local hotels have great rooms and easy-to-use shuttle services.  When you book, be sure to mention that is is your honeymoon; you may just get little extra magic in your room. (That sounds way more creepy now that I've read it in context.) Yes, having a room on property puts you inside the magic...but if you're going to be spending most of your time in the parks, then why pay $400 for a bed when you can pay $150?   If you're looking for a package, I recommend Costco (if you can).  Our family of four saved almost $1000 on our last 3-day trip.   Eat off-site, if possible.  Unless you're really keen to experience the various restaurants in the parks, grab some Subway before you go in, pack some power bars & fruit, and save your $$ for a fancy honeymoon dinner at one of the better restaurants, such as Steakhouse 55, Napa Rose, or Carthay Circle.   Have fun, and congratulations!"

Disneyland,3ckojv,Tchnique,3,Wed Jul 8 18:30:44 2015 UTC,Have you been to both? I've only been to WDW and am planning a trip to DL. What makes you like DL more than WDW?
Disneyland,3ckojv,flaycs,6,Thu Jul 9 12:51:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not the person you're replying too but I'm going to answer from the perspective of someone who grew up on WDW and only recently has gotten the chance to visit DL.  For me at least, there is a bit of extra magic when you walk into the park that Walt himself built. Not with his own two hands of course, but he was around while Disneyland was under construction and oversaw every inch and detail. Knowing that you're walking the same paths that Walt walked brings in a new sense of awe that you can't get at WDW.  Also, it's a much tighter park. Things aren't spread out as much. Some will say this is a bad thing, but I like how homey and down to earth it feels because of this. Not to mention there are certain versions of Disneyland rides that are quite simply better than their WDW counterparts."
Disneyland,3ckojv,golf4miami,3,Thu Jul 9 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"Your comment makes my trip seem much more exciting. Having been to WDW more than 10 times, I was a little hesitant about finally going to DL. Now I can't wait. Thanks."
Disneyland,3ckojv,flaycs,4,Thu Jul 9 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"I could go on and on about the reasons why I like DL more now to be honest with you. I suggest you either stay on property or at one of the close good neighbor hotels where you can walk to either park. To me that's part of the charm that DL has that WDW doesn't either.   I stayed at the Disneyland Hotel for one trip and being able to wake up and walk to the parks and not have to worry about hopping on a car or bus was just an amazing feeling. Also, if you have park hoppers. Being able to hop from one park to the other in like 20 minutes without having to get on a car, bus, monorail, was another huge plus.   Also, if you're of age, Trader Sam's is simply the best bar I have ever had the privilege of consuming alcohol in."
Disneyland,3ckojv,golf4miami,3,Thu Jul 9 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"I have to agree about the park being less spread out. It makes it seem a little more magical! Plus since you don't have to go huge distances to transfer parks it doesn't take you out of the disney experience, which I found WDW did."
Disneyland,3ckojv,lameio69,11,Thu Jul 9 16:52:48 2015 UTC,"In terms of, literally pumping millions of dollars into North Orange county's economy, this is great.    This is also great news for Disneyland as a whole..many neglected bits of the park wil be fixed, replaced, new rides, etc.    The downside I can see, higher ticket prices, more croweds, more traffic, just more of everything..."
Disneyland,3ckojv,klaceo,9,Wed Jul 8 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"Now keep in mind guys. This does not mean that Disney will expand. It just means that they could. They could very well just pocket the money and keep slowly improving like business as usual or just move the money to another DVC location. Until Disney starts signing agreements once again to bulldoze and redirect streets or starts demolishing one of their precious parking lots, Disney is not committing to anything. There's a lot of hoops that Disney will have to jump through in order to spend this much money on the resort, and it's just as likely that they will do nothing or get blocked by neighboring businesses and neighborhoods."
Disneyland,3ckojv,EagleEyeInTheSky,11,Wed Jul 8 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Note there is no money to pocket. This agreement just means the voters of Anaheim cannot place a tax on admission, just as it has been the last 60 years.  Even if it had not passed there would not have been a tax right off the bat, the voters would have had to enact one at some point.  If a tax did happen, Disneyland does not pay it, those buying tickets / APs would be paying it.  This agreement is basically 'lets keep things as they always have been, we will continue to invest and the city will make more in general taxes anyway.' The agreement does become void if they don't start spending / have plans in place by a certain time."
Disneyland,3ckojv,0oiiiiio0,6,Wed Jul 8 22:14:12 2015 UTC,I think by buying up some of the hotel space near the park it means that they will expand eventually. Just hoping for more park rather than another parking structure. Just my thought.
Disneyland,3ckojv,caustickitten,3,Wed Jul 8 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think at the moment, the plan is to build as many parking lots as possible and just demolish whatever lots you need to build a park. I wouldn't say that extra parking lots are bad since they can always demolish a lot to build a new park."
Disneyland,3ckojv,EagleEyeInTheSky,3,Wed Jul 8 20:59:27 2015 UTC,"I took a survey a while ago about ""possible Disney hotels and features I would like to see.""  However, most of the features they kept giving me options were way above what I'd ever pay, or what I suspect would be a future DVC property.  they were all suites or with features I didn't really want - I just want a room!  I don't have kids, I don't need a kitchen - I just want a nice, clean, magical room near the parks."
Disneyland,3ckojv,epotosi,2,Wed Jul 8 22:04:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that survey left a weird taste in my mouth too. I started wondering if I was being hyper critical but nearly every option my immediate reaction was ""Do not want, will not pay for."""
Disneyland,3ckojv,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:17:49 2015 UTC,The OC Register article posted this morning stated that the ticket-tax ban was contingent on Disney committing to beginning construction on the $1 billion expansion by 2017 and completing it no longer than 2024.
Disneyland,3ckojv,cardboardroom,3,Thu Jul 9 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"The problem with these kinds of promises though is that it's uncategorized funding.  Unless there was a clause that said that Disney must build a park or must build a hotel, then Disney could spend that money on whatever they want really. What qualifies as an expansion could be whatever. At the end of 2026, Disney could point at the handful of rides and Downtown Disney shops it added and said that they expanded using the funds gained by the tax break, despite the fact that Disney may have been planning to build a handful of new rides all along.  I'd love for Disney to sign an agreement with the city to build something specific. Something like, ""we will build a brand new theme park within the decade"". Not, ""we will build some uncategorized 'expansion' to some aspect of our property""."

Disneyland,3ckojv,melodieux_,4,Thu Jul 9 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"Many many years ago, Disney and the City of Anaheim made a deal where Disney would build a new theme park, parking structure, shopping center, hotels, and remodel a bunch of the city if Disney could get away with not paying some taxes. That turned into California Adventure.  That tax deal is up next year. They just renewed it. People are hoping that this means that Disney will make another big expansion like the California Adventure expansion was. Potentially a third theme park."

Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,26,Wed Jul 8 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"The reason they approved the no-gate tax was;    The city of Anaheim as a whole benefits from Disneyland improving their parks. More tourist there means more tourist in Anaheim.  If Disneyland is expanding it's two parks, that means more jobs for people. People living in Anaheim or near by Anaheim.  Disneyland and Anaheim have a strong relationship in previous years and"
Disneyland,3ckojv,JW_Stillwater,-1,Wed Jul 8 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Disney parks create tourism and jobs (#1 employer in the county), but like I said, Disney can't just pick up its parks and leave if Anaheim had decided not to give them a pass.  The number one thing that gets me is that, at the city council meeting, residents from some of Anaheim's poorest neighborhoods showed up and talked about how they see no benefit from Disney's presence in the city. And while that's not entirely true (tourism means sales tax and occupancy tax revenue, so the city does get some benefit from the parks), the city could be making a lot more money that could be used for any number of purposes in the city."
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,12,Wed Jul 8 22:36:18 2015 UTC,"Well that was what the whole argument was. Disney is saying ""let us spend this $1 Billion to get more people in which will be helpful to the whole city"" and the people against it say that the gate tax will make more money for the city. This is not true. Disney doesn't like to raise gate prices unnecessarily because it pushes people away from their parks and from Anaheim. They'd rather build spend money to make more money for them and Anaheim. You're right, they can't just leave, but the tourist can.   If there are poor places in Anaheim, that's the city's fault for mismanaging funds that could go to help those citizens. Unless Disney is directly causing them to be underprivileged like that, in which case they should sue Disney instead."
Disneyland,3ckojv,JW_Stillwater,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:42:22 2015 UTC,"But see, this is buying into Disney's messaging. It's not as if they weren't going to put any money into improving the parks if this gate tax was levied. In fact, it's absurd to think they'd hold off on improvements just to spite the city. And remember, this tax would be levied on people buying tickets, not Disney."

Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,6,Thu Jul 9 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"But...they're literally the only reason Anaheim is even thriving the way it is. They want them to expand because it brings sooooooo much economic growth into the area, with more tax revenue on top of that. Easing restrictions on a ticket price entices people to keep slapping it down and in turn supports the city. Anyway, this boils down to your viewpoint - does the government spend the money better and bring more jobs, or does Disney do a better job at bringing more money and jobs into the city?"
Disneyland,3ckojv,bassplaya07,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:39:08 2015 UTC,"My real issue is fair practices. By all means, Anaheim benefits tremendously by having Disneyland there, and of course the city wants to maintain a good relationship. The problem is it's a ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" agreement that feels all kinds of dirty, especially since it was done in full view of the public. I'm not against Disney continuing to improve the parks. I'm against shady government practices."
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:12:43 2015 UTC,"The problem is that those same shady government practices are the real reason that Disney bucks don't get applied to the proper places.  Everyone thinks that more money magically means more help for those who need it, but that all depends on the city actually applying the money in the proper fashion.  The problem isn't money from Disney; the problem is management of those funds."

Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,4,Thu Jul 9 02:30:24 2015 UTC,"Adding to your comment,  Anaheim gets a massive amount of revenue related to Disneyland. Not only on sales tax, but income taxes, hotel taxes, alcohol sales/licenses, permits, etc. Every hotel surrounding the park makes a majority of its income from park visitors and convention center guests.  It's hard for some people to see the benefit of a large business when they aren't employed by them/understand how the revenue stream works. That said, a lot of city resources go into managing the side effects of having the DLR. Police, fire, infrastructure, inspectors, etc."
Disneyland,3ckojv,calrdt12,2,Thu Jul 9 03:14:56 2015 UTC,I can't help but feel that this was a smart move for Anaheim. The money generated with a gate tax would have probably not benefitted many citizens as the increased construction and capacity of the DLR. Demand is high for Disney Parks and they need to expand while the brand is hot.
Disneyland,3ckojv,izookie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:50:24 2015 UTC,"I'm all for Disney expanding the DLR. My problem is that Disney didn't even present a plan for expansion, just a promise of $1 billion in additions over 30 years, and it feels irresponsible for elected officials to take that promise without asking for more information or guarantees on what amounts to the city's investment."
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,3,Thu Jul 9 15:55:03 2015 UTC,It's good for disneyland visitors.
Disneyland,3ckojv,CletusTSJY,-3,Wed Jul 8 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"How is it good for visitors? Disney keeps upping its prices regardless of a gate tax. If there was a gate tax, they'd have to adjust their ticket prices (read: lower) to keep the bottom line price affordable enough so not to turn people off from going.  It's easy for Disney to say that a gate tax would mean higher prices for everyone. They make themselves look like victims when they've been making off like bandits for 30 years and will for another 30."
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,6,Wed Jul 8 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"Another reason they need to keep raising prices is to try to keep the crowds down. Their price increases aren't even enough to keep up with the demand for tickets. I know it sounds backwards, but they have a great product that a lot of people want, so they have to raise prices in order to deter some people from going in order to keep the crowds down."
Disneyland,3ckojv,pardus79,6,Wed Jul 8 23:23:26 2015 UTC,This doesn't sound backwards at all... Its basic supply and demand.
Disneyland,3ckojv,Boron17,5,Thu Jul 9 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"For sure. They purposely price people out. A gate tax could even help them justify high prices. But it's not happening, so it's irrelevant."
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,0,Wed Jul 8 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"What they need to do to accomplish this is not to change prices in day-tickets, but in APs.  And if you haven't noticed what they've been doing in that regard lately, you're not paying attention. It's what's coming."
Disneyland,3ckojv,TomCollinsEsq,4,Thu Jul 9 01:17:12 2015 UTC,They make out like bandits because they make terrific products. The government would have just made even more money off disney's terrific products.   And theyd still raise prices and we'd all still pay it.
Disneyland,3ckojv,CletusTSJY,2,Wed Jul 8 22:05:32 2015 UTC,The city will end up making more money from the money Disney is investing as more long-term visitors will be attracted to the parks who will pay other taxes in Anaheim.
Disneyland,3ckojv,Boron17,0,Thu Jul 9 00:43:43 2015 UTC,"But see, that's just general distrust in the government. Fraud is much harder than you think, especially in a city as visible as Anaheim. As tax money, it'd be on the books and easy to keep track of, especially by local news outlets."

Annual park attendance continues to grow; there really isn't an ""off season any longer"", and this is in spite of the large annual price increases.  This can only have one outcome: even steeper price increases this year and the next.  Will I continue to renew my annual pass?  Absolutely.  Will I continue to hold on to my Disney stock?  Also absolutely."

Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,4,Thu Jul 9 06:29:14 2015 UTC,"I think the argument was that Disney would either build a third gate or use the money to revamp the Resort as it stands.

Disneyland,3ckojv,DisneylandMod,7,Wed Jul 8 19:02:14 2015 UTC,"I believe they have already publicly denied plans for a third gate. I heard the money was going towards parking and a hotel, not necessarily new attractions, but we will know more after D23 I suspect."

Once they finish Disney-fying DCA (Grizzly Peak and A Bug's Land, I'm looking at you) and maybe building a Star Wars land, what more can be done?"
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,3,Wed Jul 8 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"Only Disney knows what more can be done. We as park goers do not know how much space is left, or what plans they have up there sleeve."
Disneyland,3ckojv,LiveJokerAce,4,Wed Jul 8 22:08:08 2015 UTC,Not to mention that things get outdated and removed and new things come in to take their place. Just look at Tomorrowland. The majority of the things there were no there when the park opened.
Disneyland,3ckojv,golf4miami,-2,Wed Jul 8 22:36:04 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely crazy for a city, a public service agency, to give a 30-year break to a company that says, ""Trust us, we're going to make some cool stuff!"" In fact, the city should have forced Disney to fork over a 30-year plan for how they'll spend that $1 billion. That's why it feels like someone was paid off. No elected official in their right mind should vote based on ""We trust Disney."" I'm among the biggest Disney fans, but something feels very wrong about a city selling out 30 years of tax revenue for an unspecified promise for improvements."
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,0,Wed Jul 8 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"If you can't see how taking money from Disney would not make them want to put as many improvements into their parks then I don't know what to tell you. They can only budget $X amount of money each year to upgrades. If you throw taxes at them they now have $X-Y amount to spend.   I can guarantee you that the city is much better off when they allow Disney to spend the $X they had originally planned because those improvements will blow anyone out of the water and bring in hotel, food, and other revenues for the city."
Disneyland,3ckojv,golf4miami,4,Wed Jul 8 23:52:28 2015 UTC,In what way is this taking money from Disney? The only people paying would be consumers. This is a gate tax; it's not property tax. Nothing would impede Disney from continuing to improve the parks.

Disneyland,3ckojv,golf4miami,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"Considering that the recent ticket price increases at all Disney parks (and the continued increase in attendance) show them to be relatively inelastic in terms of response to changes in price, that's not an argument that holds a lot of water."
Disneyland,3ckojv,TomCollinsEsq,0,Thu Jul 9 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, a $5 increase didn't keep people from coming. What makes you think another one would make sales drop drastically?"
Disneyland,3ckojv,dodgepodge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:31:01 2015 UTC,Totally depends on the size of the sales tax.
Disneyland,3ckojv,golf4miami,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:33:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Disney would've put that money into improving the parks regardless of the gate tax being levied. And it's not like Disney can up and take their parks somewhere else.   I agree 100% at the ""they can't just take their parks somewhere else"" logic but I also think they don't have to make major improvements either.   Look at Disneyland Park, the last major attraction was added 20 years ago (Indy), other than that the only things that have changed are the shows and spectaculars. Now I won't pretend to know what crowds would look like if DCA had not been built but I do look at Disneyland Park's crowd levels and think it's insane that it's as popular as it is given the lack of new things to do.   I think Disney could easily maintain what it has currently and not add a whole lot more to the parks and still have huge attendance numbers for the next decade or longer.   The idea behind the gate-tax exemption was that they would invest a very large amount of money into the resort which would add something new to bring even more people into the area (like a new land, hotel, major infrastructure improvement etc). These are things that they probably don't NEED to do so they are using it as an incentive to get a tax break from the city.   Not a huge fan of the way that works but it also makes sense to me."
Disneyland,3ckojv,Shatteredreality,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"Whether or not they need to, Disney is going to make improvements. They have certain spending levels to reach in order to maintain their agreement with Anaheim. This won't mean a new park, but it will mean new attractions and a new parking structure.  It's also not really a tax break. There's no gate tax on the books; this just keeps voters from being able to vote one into place. It feels unfair to strip the city's voters of that right for a total of 60 years. This makes total sense for Disney. They were (more than likely) going to improve the parks anyway, and this just means they don't have to figure a gate tax into their pricing model. Now if I was a resident/voter in Anaheim, I'd be pretty upset to have my rights sold away yet again."

Disneyland,3ckojv,fernker,0,Thu Jul 9 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"They don't need to do anything. Disneyland has the 3rd highest theme park attendance in the world. They don't need to spend any large amounts of money on it to keep it in that spot. It attracts almost 3 times more guests than Universal Hollywood. They would have taken that money and spent it in Florida, or in Shanghai or Tokyo or even Hong Kong. They want to spend the money in Anaheim to make it a resort destination like WDW where people spend 4-5 days instead of just 1-2, but at the same time it works very well the way it is, so why change anything if Anaheim doesn't cooperate?"
Disneyland,3ckojv,centracing,-4,Thu Jul 9 00:24:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're not even sure what your point is. It IS working as is, and Anaheim doesn't have space to make anything close to WDW. And it's foolish to think that Disney would stop improving the DLR just to spite the city. That would be sacrificing their bottom line in more ways than one."

Disneyland,3cnn0x,HorseCode,9,Thu Jul 9 08:44:24 2015 UTC,"The only real difference is now you don't get to experience things in the queue lines of the ride. Some of the rides have pretty awesome stuff in the queue that you miss. If I remember correctly in the haunted mansion you also miss the stretching room (It has been 15 years since I went and the haunted mansion was open). My mom needs a wheelchair when doing things like theme parks, so I have experienced this first hand."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,wamoc,4,Thu Jul 9 13:17:49 2015 UTC,My mother-in-law was in a wheelchair and transferred into the Doom Buggy. We went through the stretching room staying  near the side.

Disneyland,3cnn0x,akastrobe,9,Thu Jul 9 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"I was an AP for many years, and I have a spinal cord injury (from birth) that makes it difficult for me to stand for a long time/walk long distances. Seeing as I don't often have to use a wheelchair, I can't speak to your individual experience, but I do have some opinions on the matter.   First, the new system is something I've actually wanted them to implement for a long time now. I've often said, I didn't care about getting to the front of the line right away (it didn't seem fair) as long as I could just sit and wait for my time to come instead of standing for 30+ minutes, which is basically impossible for me to do. This new system effectively implements this. Of course, that's also what fast passes are for as well. To circumvent too much standing around, I also use single rider lines to my advantage, especially when I'm by myself or with a friend who is amenable to that. It often significantly decreases the amount of waiting time. Single rider, combined with fast pass, combined with using the train to get around DL and taking lots of rest breaks works well for me, but this is after many years of trial and error. Is it better than say, renting an ECV? The ECV serves a function- it cuts down on the amount of walking I have to do, therefore on the amount of time it takes me to recover from a Disney visit. Is using a wheelchair or ECV better or worse? Assuming you have a choice, it is a matter of personal preference. For some, using a wheelchair may be a great way to increase the quality of their visit. For others, there are probably other ways of making sure you have an enjoyable time, based on your individual needs. If you do not have a choice, the question is irrelevant.   So, I guess the question is: does the new DAS system work for people who have mobility limitations like I do, as well as for people who use wheelchairs? That depends. For me, because I have the option of using a wheelchair or not, it was very much trial and error, and as I outlined above, I have found other ways to accommodate myself. Frankly, I second what other people have said about having to navigate a wheelchair around the park; it can be very frustrating during the busy months. I live near the resort, so I can avoid those months.   I guess this is a very long winded way of saying:  TL;DR- Your experience is what you make of it. Use the new system, try to enjoy your waiting times and the experience of just being in the park, and think of how much more relaxing your experience will probably be, knowing you won't be quite as exhausted at the end."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,PeggyOlson225,2,Thu Jul 9 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"Can I ask how your experiences with getting the DAS have gone? My MiL is coming with us for the first time and her issues sound similar to yours. (She's had back surgery and both hips replaced. She's mobile, but standing for long periods will do her in quickly.)   Have you ever had any issues being issued a DAS ?"
Disneyland,3cnn0x,Pinklette,3,Thu Jul 9 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"I have not yet had experience with the new DAS system, because the last time I went, I used a combination of fast passes and single rider lines to meet my needs. The entire DAS process is outlined here. From the looks of it, they will do their best to accommodate your MiL. I can't imagine that you would have any issues being issued a DAS. I wouldn't expect that I would either, but if anyone has had a different experience, feel free to comment! I'd be interested to hear about others' experiences."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,PeggyOlson225,3,Thu Jul 9 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I had read through that already, and then another poster here had made me doubt if she'd qualify. We may wind up renting a chair on day 5, but we're really hoping to avoid that. She's a trooper, and we're hoping to take it easy, but it's good to have options!"
Disneyland,3cnn0x,Pinklette,2,Thu Jul 9 19:41:53 2015 UTC,"I'd probably on day one see if using lots of fast passes and using single rider lines would work for her. If she's similar to me, then that might be a good way to go without having to go to guest relations. Of course, it all depends on what you as a group want to do, but I'd maybe give it a shot and see how it goes. Take it easy, rest when you have to, and make adjustments accordingly."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,PeggyOlson225,6,Thu Jul 9 20:23:09 2015 UTC,"Before the transplant my In-laws surprised me with a ""Hopefully not the last"" Disneyland trip. We were planning to go before I started getting too sick but I took a turn for the worse and ended up in a wheelchair for the trip. When you're dying of liver-failure you don't have a lot of energy, absolutely everything is exhausting. Cast members were all fantastic, most times we would wait in the queue to certain point, then would be taken to the load area and would have to wait a bit for our turn. I think that's a great practice, I remember a story where my Uncle broke his leg, cut off the cast instead of going back to the doctor, then used it to skip lines at Disneyland, Knotts, and Six Flags. The worst part of being in a wheelchair has to be the other guests who don't realize you've been waiting too, and look at this dude! He doesn't even need a wheelchair, he can walk! ... ... ... it was embarrassing when folks would shout but what can you do? What was said about missing things in queues is true, didn't get to see the new Star Tours queue for example."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,Roguenails,2,Thu Jul 9 14:36:37 2015 UTC,"What people don't realize is that, oftenly, people using DAS or a wheelchair would wait longer because there's usually only one cart CMs can load."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,evanescentglint,6,Fri Jul 10 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing to remember with a wheelchair is that people don't move around the chair like they would a person standing/walking there. It can be INCREDIBLY frustrating to push a chair through the crowds, and it's pretty claustrophobic for the person in the chair, as well. They get a face full of butts and people not giving them personal space while the pusher is constantly having to stop for the people ""just ducking through"" all the time.  The other thing is the hills. We don't really realize there are many hills in Disneyland until we have to move our own body weight as well as somebody else's up them! Getting in and out of Critter Country can be mildly exhausting if the person you're pushing is even slightly overweight.  As for the rides, there are some things that just won't work well, like taking the monorail and train as forms of transportation instead of for the entire ride experience. The wait time process is kinda ""eh"" in my opinion right now, because they basically give you a pass for the current wait time of the ride when you arrive, and then have you come back to board so it is like you waited with everybody else. I like the aspect of wheelchairs no longer being abused for shorter wait times, but if it's an awkward amount of time where you can't go do something else and come back you basically just have to hope there's a shady bench free nearby and sit it out. This normally isn't a problem, but if it's particularly hot or a long wait the lines will have lots of ways to help keep you cool, comfortable, and moving. Sitting in the middle of Fantasyland baking in the reflection off the castle sparkles isn't going to give you that experience."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,polunu,6,Thu Jul 9 14:38:30 2015 UTC,pretty much the same.
Disneyland,3cnn0x,95688it,3,Thu Jul 9 09:00:48 2015 UTC,When I go to the parks with my Mom she is in a wheelchair and the staff are fantastic. The new fast passes basically just have you return at the time you'd likely reach the ride if you were to enter the line at that moment. Although it can be adjusted if they've had alot of wheelchair groups in a short time span. Often what we do is send the group through the line and my mom and someone will take the return time to the cast member and let them know the rest of the group went through the line. Nobody misses out on the fun in line disney magic and she still gets to join us for the ride. (we tended to do this for the old system as well because she was uncomfortable with the people whispering about how it was unfair our family got to skip the line with her)
Disneyland,3cnn0x,flyingflapjacks,3,Thu Jul 9 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"About the same. Some things are better (eg not having to go navigate through the queues, being able to do things while you're waiting), some things are harder (eg taking the long way to get to a ramp instead of being able to go down a curb, getting through shops is just SUPER TOUGH, navigating through crowds that are ALWAYS looking for a gap to push through. That last bit...that's rough. Because people don't see you until they're right on top of you, you occasionally get people running into you, then getting mad at you for being there. If you attach a flag to your wheelchair, at about person-height, it's better, but not perfect.)  Would I rather not have to be in a wheelchair? Yes. But Disneyland makes it not so horrible. There's handicapped parade seating, which is good, because it's kind of impossible to find a place to sit for one of the parades that you're not blocked by other people, or teetering precariously on a curb.   Oh, quick note: If your group is larger than six people, you'll have to split up. Wheelchairs are only allowed to bring five people onto rides with them."
Disneyland,3cnn0x,akastrobe,10,Thu Jul 9 16:09:01 2015 UTC,Im  happy they fixed it. Wheelchair doesn't mean they shouldn't wait in like like everyone else. Don't disabled people want to be treated the same anyway?
Disneyland,3cnn0x,jawknee21,7,Thu Jul 9 10:44:28 2015 UTC,The main reason for that was the obvious abusers. Same thing happens at airport all the time to avoid security lines.

Disneyland,3cnn0x,jawknee21,0,Thu Jul 9 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"While the old system was definitely flawed, it did help to make it more possible for some people to get the full experience of the parks. My uncle has many health issues associated with his down syndrome, and he also loves Disney. We went to Disney World a few years ago before they changed the policy, and we were able to go through all four in about eight hours (including air conditioned breaks and skipping anything considered a ""thrill"" ride that would be dangerous for him). Being in the heat for a long period of time makes him sick, and he also tends to lose energy quickly. The old system made it so he could fully enjoy the magic of the park rather than just a few rides. So, while it may not have been necessary for many people (and while others were simply abusing the policy), it was an extremely effective system for others."

Disneyland,3cnn0x,SnarkMasterRay,2,Fri Jul 10 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"DAS/wheelchairs get a wait time similar to the amount of the current time, kind of like a fastpass but you get to go whenever after your return time. However, you usually have to wait in a short line because most rides only load a few cars. You do get to select where you want to sit for a few rides like splash mountain, Indiana jones, matterhorn, and screamin. Star tours, you have to sit in the front, eliminating any chance of being the rebel scum. Excuse me... Rebel spy. There is wheelchair sitting at the smoking area near haunted mansion for Fantasmic. Wheelchair sitting near pixie hollow for the paint the night parade. And I think somewhere on Main Street for the forever fireworks. DCA has preferred wheel chair sitting for world of color as well. However, with all of these, while you get front row sitting, you're often way off to the side, except for the parade.  Information booths are usually where you can set up a wait time. We usually get wait times for a ride across the park and take our time getting there, looking out for pins. You can also get wait times at the ride itself. Rides in fantasy land are also wait-free except for dumbo, Peter pan, and Alice.   Like other people mentioned, you miss out on all the queue decorations. Also, people in the park are usually jerks, and will cut you off, resulting in you running them over. People in lines will also comment about how they ""should get a wheelchair next time"". It's nearly impossible to move around. But overall, I think they did a great job making it equal and fair, just can't do anything about the people."

Disneyland,3ckoau,calrdt12,5,Thu Jul 9 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Quite often, plain clothes security will handle it and pull a suspected thief aside to inspect bags, person, etc. Disney is all about handling it discreetly, sometimes in full view ""on stage."" I think that the shame of being caught stealing at Disneyland keeps people from making a scene."
Disneyland,3ckoau,DIY_queen,2,Thu Jul 9 02:56:03 2015 UTC,I've never heard that but it sounds way more appropriate than stopping a ride to take them off...
Disneyland,3ckoau,robots_and_cancer,10,Thu Jul 9 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"Hm, the only time I've seen people pulled is if the rocket is overweight, which happens very, very rarely."
Disneyland,3ckoau,kethryvis,2,Wed Jul 8 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"hah, it happened like 2-3 times in a row for me and my friends. It was crazy :/  But in that case, they pulled the entire ride vehicle to the left and made us all get off, not just two."
Disneyland,3ckoau,chibomb,15,Thu Jul 9 04:49:25 2015 UTC,I don't know about this specific case but I know they pull people off in that area if the computer thinks the vehicle is not balanced.
Disneyland,3ckoau,aflatness,5,Wed Jul 8 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, this happened on May 22nd, where we went to the left of the control center and everyone had to get out. It seemed like it was because the 2 guys were wearing their backpacks in the seats, so obviously a safety hazard."
Disneyland,3ckoau,booboothechicken,44,Wed Jul 8 23:38:14 2015 UTC,"They probably said Mickey was a punk bitch or something.  I can picture Mickey waiting in the side room with brass knuckles like when they capture card counters in Vegas.  ""Who's the bitch now! HuHah!"""

Disneyland,3ckoau,cheekonyourface,3,Thu Jul 9 01:06:28 2015 UTC,Were they big guys?  Weight distribution is important on that attraction
Disneyland,3ckoau,itsmissjenna,3,Thu Jul 9 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"It's likely that the car was just over the weight limit and those teenagers were the easiest to get out and remove weight.   This happened to two of my friends while my other friend and I were seated behind them. We are all in our twenties and of normal adult size. When we arrived at the second stop right before you turn right to begin the ride the same thing you described happened. Two CM's came up with stairs and tersely told my two friends to get off the ride and hustled them out and pointed them through a door and out of sight. Myself and the remaining friend were still sent on the ride, and we were very confused about why our friends were kicked off.  When we found our other friends a bit after the ride they told us the cast members had told them there was too much weight on the car and their seats were the easiest to get to.   This was probably the case for the teenagers you saw. The CM's that took my friends off sounded upset (we also thought that our friends were being wrongly accused of doing something wrong) but I think they were just in a hurry. They probably hadn't done anything wrong, they were just the ones that the CM's chose."
Disneyland,3ckoau,hunnyycakes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:26:15 2015 UTC,"YES about the CMs being in a hurry. That ride is on a timed system like Monsters Inc. If guests take too long to load/unload the rockets will backup. Ever notice a lot of beeping in the station, then it stops? That's the alarm telling them to speed up the process, or the ride will shut down. So I agree with your guess! Those 2 teens were the easiest seats to get to so they could fix the weight problem"
Disneyland,3ckoau,Jordaneer,7,Mon Jul 13 22:42:37 2015 UTC,"either like flashing the ride (ala flash mountain), using a selfie stick, flipping people off, or something of the like."
Disneyland,3ckoau,incride,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"Can confirm as a former cast member working the Splash Mountain photos, that we had to inform splash mountain workers of people flashing actual nipple, or opening umbrellas on the ride."

I used to work Splash and had to stop the ride and go up the big huge lift to tell the people to put their unbrellas away if they didn't listen tobthe intercom. It was a bitch and a half going up but was good exercise! Haha
Disneyland,3ckoau,caustickitten,2,Sat Jul 11 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"They may have come from another ride where they did something like throw something off or disobey a safety sign. If you throw up your legs on Tower of Terror, they emergency stop the ride and it takes a while to reset. Sometimes the voice will call out the person who did it over the PA so everyone knows but they always get ""escorted"" away from the ride after we get off."
Disneyland,3ckoau,mybaby51,4,Thu Jul 9 07:31:07 2015 UTC,They were probably macking it hard
Disneyland,3ckoau,elizabeaver,3,Wed Jul 8 20:20:15 2015 UTC,"Teenagers don't usually get pulled for making out on rides. I went to Disneyland on a lot of high school band/choir trips (which was less than five years ago), and kids would get handsy on Haunted Mansion, Small World, and the like all of the time. I had never heard of someone in our group getting pulled for that reason."

If a particularly crowded/hot day is expected, I'll splurge and do the PCH grill character breakfast where the kids are guaranteed to meet Minnie, Mickey, Daisy and Pluto (plus others). I'd rather do that than wait hours in line in Toon Town, especially with younger kids. We'll still walk through their houses, but don't feel the need to wait to meet them.

Disneyland,3ci7t3,ThePaulAntonio,10,Wed Jul 8 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"Yess!! Actually one of my favorite rides in Disneyland!   It has it's downsides: it's work, it's exercise in oftentimes hot weather (sweat), and the the kids in front of/behind you can't quite get their rowing down thus you are frequently knocking paddles together and getting splashed upon (my phone actually got water damaged this way, had to get another one). Still though, it's one ride that I love and look forward to going on whenever I visit. Short lines too! It's a shame that it's only seasonal.  I'd love to go on there with a good coordinated team, see how fast we can make it around the island if that's even allowed, haha!! I overheard from one of the CMs there that they do have a contest for that exact thing - around three minutes I believe the best time was.  Thanks for writing this one up /u/ThePaulAntonio!!"

Disneyland,3cidya,eauvert,2,Wed Jul 8 03:39:28 2015 UTC,This is very interesting... I'd love to know where or when this was recorded. Clearly its something relevant since it includes MSEP snippets. Early recording?
Disneyland,3cidya,Kryptonlogic,3,Wed Jul 8 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"Owl City revised the song sometime back in March or February of this year as hinted by his Instagram post: https://instagram.com/p/0o_BiwAWY1. Of course, his new recordings is used in the parade.  This song version, however, was made specially to be used in videos promoting the parade (or the 60th anniversary as a whole) since Disney has a library of music tracks that are used in videos."
Disneyland,3cidya,SuperHotLarry,3,Wed Jul 8 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say... this sounds close to the actual version. This version seemed a bit more relaxed IMO than the actual parade version.

They were a bit cheaper but you have to buy them in advance as they take a few days to get delivered to your email.  We printed them out and took them right up to the gate, they swapped them out for the card tickets.  *We did however get park hopper, not sure of the price difference for regular tickets."

Disneyland,3cictk,shoptillyoudrop,2,Wed Jul 8 04:49:12 2015 UTC,Ok. We were debating buying them from the hotel or AAA however I think we will just buy straight from Disney. Thank you all
Disneyland,3cictk,Jordaneer,2,Wed Jul 8 12:02:58 2015 UTC,"really the only way to get a significant discount (that I know of) is to either know someone who is a cast member, or be part of a group that is performing at disneyland, when I performed there in 2014, we got like $100 off of a 4 day park hopper ticket."

Going to spend the week of September 21st with my fiancé. :)  I was going to get the 3 day park hopper with my employment @ $250 each, but when I saw the 3 day single tickets at $213.50 each, I think jumping between parks wasn't needed.   5 single day tickets would cost us $250 each. Oh, and each ticket came with Magic Morning admission."
Disneyland,3cictk,zerostarhotel,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"Craigslist is OK if you are careful. Honest people want $90 or so for their real tickets, unless they expire tomorrow. If they'll take $35, they aren't holding real tickets.  There are a few free ticket contests that happen across California, where real four packs of two-day tickets are given away on the radio. Also, some companies give away tickets as employee incentives. Both of these are sources of real tickets for sale on Craigslist."

Disneyland,3cf81d,coalshinconfidential,2,Tue Jul 7 21:37:46 2015 UTC,They're actually not ipads... when I worked for GR myself and many others continually suggested using ipads but apparently what they use are better for the job at hand.  Sorry your wife was chased. Part of the reason I left was because I hated feeling like I took away the guest experience.
Disneyland,3cf81d,Naturalgut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:14:40 2015 UTC,I can imagine that it is one of the more thankless jobs in the parks but know that my comment was completely tongue in cheek. In fact I actually kind of it fun that she gets chosen so frequently while I am clearly not the target of their surveys. We usually spend a little of the time right after trying to figure out what they were gathering information on. Now the dvc cms on the other hand... Yikes that is the only bad experience I have ever had with a cm.

One was about the color scheme of their online park calendars, one was about the pricing of the tickets the way hotels do it, and I can't remember what the other one was about. But they are asking for opinions on some really important stuff before they make the decision and that's cool."

Disneyland,3cjcqm,OptimalWhorehouse,13,Wed Jul 8 10:50:17 2015 UTC,"Are you doing this through headphones or with a speaker? Because as much as I love The Beatles and as much as I love Disneyland, I would strongly advise you to rethink your decision if you and your friends were planning on doing this with portable speakers. This might be okay on some of the dark rides where you're more secluded from everyone else (e.g. Toad's, Roger Rabbit), but it could ruin the immersive Disney experience for other guests on rides like HM or Tower of Tower, and ESPECIALLY Finding Nemo, which is already cramped enough as it is.   I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but I do think you need to consider wearing headphones for some of the rides, lest you disrupt the magic for any younger guests or get your speakers taken away by a CM.   Also, For the Benefit of Mr. Kite - Dumbo"
Disneyland,3cjcqm,elizabeaver,4,Wed Jul 8 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I love the Beatles, but I go to Disneyland to enjoy Disney and escape, not listen to the beatles while riding the haunted mansion. I would be extremely PO'd if someone did that while I was trying to ride"

Disneyland,3cjcqm,OrangeFeels,3,Thu Jul 9 10:19:44 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't be playing the music out loud as it could ruin other Guest's riding experience. If you're using headphones, I'd say go for it, but if you were going to play it though a speaker, that's kind of a scummy thing to do."

Disneyland,3cgby1,epotosi,5,Wed Jul 8 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say that even though it seems like you want to go into attractions, you should get into the park any way you can. When I applied, the attractions posting was up for less than 24 hours. After you've worked for the mouse for four months you'll be able to transfer departments into attractions. Also, once they interview they can basically hire you on the spot or wait until just before your application is expired. (six months from applying) For an attractions interview, have a land you want to work at in your mind. There are a few stereotypes with CMs in different areas, too. Adventureland/Frontierland (AdvFrnt) is Partyland. New Orleans/Critter Country is AdvFrnt's little brother. Fantasyland is very by-the-book, and Tomorrowland is laid-back. All are great places to work, but it is interesting to see the kinds of people different lands attract. Lots of actors in the company, but especially AdvFrnt due the the Jungle Cruise. I don't know too much about DCA, but things are a bit different there, and many rules are more relaxed.  Most importantly, have fun. If you get this job it may not be the best job you'll ever have, but it will be one of the most fun jobs you'll have. Don't take this whole thing too seriously. You're trying to work for a mouse.

I sat in line for 3 hours for the Alan Menken/ Richard Sherman concert to make sure I got in and did the same amount of waiting for the Dick Van Dyke a cappella group the Vantastix at the 2011 expo (totally worth it both times BTW). The line for most major events are long and if you're at the end you may not make it in even if it's in the huge arena. The lines to get in the convention center are long. The sleeping over in the arena option was not offered in previous years. The fast pass system did help some, but, again, I was in line 30 mins for a fast pass. So bring you smart phone loaded with Disney movies, ear buds and some sort of recharging system to kill time because the theme of the expo is usually lines, lines, and more lines unless you are the lucky few who got a Sorcerer's pass.

I was listening to the most recent Moustalgia podcast (which is completely about D23 and what to expect, I suggest a listen) and they said that the most recent D23 was about 15,000 people.  I'm not sure the capacity for the overall of the Anaheim Convention Center, but the big hall will hold 7,500 people, about 1,500 more than the San Diego Convention Center's biggest room (Hall H). When I went to the Con last (2012) they had about 140,000 people and I was able to make it in to panels by committing about an hour to getting in to the panels.   I'm not sure you'll need to ""camp out"" to get in, unless you're looking to be the first person in line. In which, you should camp out, because the early bird wins or something like that.   Unsure of parking and stuff, but hope some comments can help with that too."

Disneyland,3cfm47,chicomandell,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:57:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you renew in person they might be able to do something for you, but I doubt it.  Seems like that would be a way to game the system and one thing Disney is good at is not missing an opportunity to get money out of you."
Disneyland,3cfm47,disneyfacts,-2,Wed Jul 8 00:28:44 2015 UTC,"You can renew the pass to get in, but I don't know if they've gotten stricter about renewing. Renewing may also include the down payment as it's the same price as a ticket - it's why they let you in."
Disneyland,3cfm47,gussiubao,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"I knew that the down payment was the equivalent of a day ticket, which is why you get in when you first purchase a pass. My question is if I renew and set up a basic payment plan (that comes out to like $40/month or whatever) if that was enough to get me in for the day.  Edit: monthly payment I would be making according to Mouse Monthly)"
Disneyland,3cfm47,gussiubao,3,Tue Jul 7 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, even if you renewed your SoCal select pass, you wouldn't be able to go to the parks if that day is blocked. When you renew (your current pass hasn't expired yet) you're continuing as a SoCal Select passholder and you're not paying the down payment again,  Instead, you'll be paying a bit more which includes the $99 spread out into 12 months.   They no longer offer AP discounted blockout tickets so you'll probably have to upgrade to the Deluxe (friday wont be blocked but the 17th will) or just pay for the $99/day ticket or just skip it altogether.   Heh....   We renewed our Deluxe passes in May online and the payments come out to $40+/month and $50+/month for the hubby who has the parking add-on."
Disneyland,3cfm47,Ghost00,3,Wed Jul 8 05:53:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah...I just don't have the cash to upgrade to Deluxe unfortunately. The most I could probably do is SoCal Select > SoCal, but even then I'm like, ""Do I REALLY need to?"" Thanks for the advice though!"

Disneyland,3ceeok,disneywizard,20,Tue Jul 7 07:02:17 2015 UTC,"Wreck it Ralph and The Princess and the Frog need more attention in the parks and when the expansion happens, need their own attractions.  Like I'd LOVE a Wreck it Ralph themed ride like Star Tours that you enter through the arcade then get on the ride and it takes you through all the different worlds and ends with a race in Sugar Rush. And with the advancements in tech, they could randomize it like Star Tours so every ride is different."
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,4,Tue Jul 7 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite recent Disney movies, but it didn't seem to be popular enough to base anything on.  I don't know that I've even seen any merchandise for it in the park.  I know they had the Fix It Felix machines in the arcade for a while, but that's about it."
Disneyland,3ceeok,disneywizard,3,Wed Jul 8 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"It was super popular-still is-but Disney's shoved it, Princess and the Frog, and even Brave to the sideline for Frozen.  Now that Frozen fever has finally died down, I really want Disney to give more support to those films so people aren't like ""Oh, yeah! That was a Disney movie?"""
Disneyland,3ceeok,EagleEyeInTheSky,3,Wed Jul 8 01:37:32 2015 UTC,"There's sooooo many successful Disney franchises that Disney doesn't acknowledge with a spot in Disneyland.  I wish we could go a few years without ever having a new show or attraction reference Toy Story, The Little Mermaid, Frozen, The Lion King, any of the Disney princesses, or Star Wars.  Like, I want to see Wreck It Ralph, TRON, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear, Lilo and Stitch, Duck Tales, the Muppets, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Wall-E, etc.  Yeah, some of them have had some presence in the parks, but they're either transient or just a minor feature of something else.  It's not like anything other that I've listed other than Treasure Planet and Brother Bear were terrible at the box office either."
Disneyland,3ceeok,incride,5,Wed Jul 8 04:27:54 2015 UTC,I believe originally Redwood Creek Challenge Trail was themed for Brother bear already before it transitioned to Up.
Disneyland,3ceeok,disneywizard,0,Wed Jul 8 07:22:46 2015 UTC,But that was the only thing we got from Brother Bear.  It didn't even get into the fireworks or even World of Color.
Disneyland,3ceeok,disneywizard,3,Wed Jul 8 14:22:39 2015 UTC,"That's why I really want the expansion to go through, so that these less acknowledged films finally get the spotlight they deserve.   Also, if we could get an Atlantis themed water park with more water rides cause it gets freaking hot in California and two water rides aren't enough, that would be great."
Disneyland,3ceeok,mamamonkey,12,Wed Jul 8 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"With technology advancing, I wonder how many years until the totally silent costumed characters seem like creepy throwbacks, like the characters from the 50s and 60s do now."

Disneyland,3ceeok,Rogellio,13,Tue Jul 7 15:13:48 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if somewhere at the parks or at the Walt Disney concert hall they showed the classic movies we know and love but with a live orchestra accompaniment.
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,11,Tue Jul 7 16:41:17 2015 UTC,"Replace Bugs Land with one of the more relevant movies.  The rides in there are just really lame off the shelf amusement park rides.  It doesn't have to all be one land, they could do like in Fantasyland where there are many different rides from different movies.  Also lose the rest of the lame rides from Paradise Pier, the jellyfish, golden zephyr, silly swings, etc."
Disneyland,3ceeok,disneywizard,4,Wed Jul 8 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"I would love that land to become a Wreck it Ralph themed land or an Incredibles land or even a Wall-E land. There's so many other options and while it's great nastalgia, it's pretty boring and is like the ToonTown of California Adventure - once all the little kids have become older, you never go back.   I would however keep all the little kid rids at Paradise Pier cause they need to do something while all the other kids are on the extreme rides."
Disneyland,3ceeok,TheStreetAlwaysWins,2,Wed Jul 8 14:47:33 2015 UTC,"Your forgetting that the lands in DCA have to keep up with the ""California"" theme. Even Carsland has that ""route 66, borderline Arizona"" thing going for it. As much as a Wall-E or Wreck it Ralph land would be cool, it doesn't really have to do with California. Yeah, Bug's life doesn't really either, but it does when compared to those movies because at least there are bugs in california? haha"
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:33:16 2015 UTC,I don't think the California thing would be a reason to not make changes.  If it means better rides I'm sure they could make it work.
Disneyland,3ceeok,TheStreetAlwaysWins,2,Thu Jul 9 06:15:47 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming the California thing does come into play, I realized they could totally just replace bug's land with a Hollywood land expansion, which could thematically host Wall-e and Wreck It Ralph, and pretty much any other movie-based attraction, like how Monster's Inc is already there. And where Bug's life location is perfect, right below the Hollywood Tower."
Disneyland,3ceeok,centracing,3,Thu Jul 9 06:25:01 2015 UTC,So get rid of all the kids rides?
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,3,Wed Jul 8 01:58:45 2015 UTC,They could replace them with other kids rides based on other movies.  Bugs Life isn't exactly a classic.  That part of the park seems cheap compared to something like Cars land.
Disneyland,3ceeok,centracing,2,Wed Jul 8 02:46:20 2015 UTC,"Well unfortunately if they replace it, it'll become Frozen land."
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,8,Wed Jul 8 03:50:41 2015 UTC,"I would be ok with Frozen land over Bug's Land if those were the only choices, but I think a Fantasyland approach of multiple movies would be better."
Disneyland,3ceeok,RockemSockemCronuts,9,Wed Jul 8 05:09:52 2015 UTC,DAE hope that they don't put the Hatbox Ghost in the WDW Haunted Mansion? I think he should stay exclusive to Disneyland.
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,7,Tue Jul 7 15:06:23 2015 UTC,They need to fix the timing on the Hatbox Ghost so that it does the effect for each person.  There have been several times where it didn't even do it until I was way past it.
Disneyland,3ceeok,Hyro0o0,2,Wed Jul 8 01:08:33 2015 UTC,We're already spoiled with the Haunted Mansion Holiday. Let's not make them even more jealous.
Disneyland,3ceeok,golf4miami,3,Tue Jul 7 15:16:08 2015 UTC,I could live without Haunted Mansion Holiday if I'm honest.
Disneyland,3ceeok,arobotamongus,2,Tue Jul 7 19:18:31 2015 UTC,are you?
Disneyland,3ceeok,golf4miami,3,Tue Jul 7 23:10:59 2015 UTC,Yes. Yes I am.
Disneyland,3ceeok,collegemathchef,10,Tue Jul 7 23:43:45 2015 UTC,"I really wish there was one more rollercoaster similar to Thunder, but not thunder.  Basically, the WDW Seven Dwarves Mine Cart ride.    Also, I wonder what year Premium Annual Passes will first hit $1,000 bucks"
Disneyland,3ceeok,ZoruaUnited,12,Wed Jul 8 08:07:19 2015 UTC,"ToonTown refurb would be great.  And no, I don't mean tear it all down and make Star Wars land.   I mean repaint or replace. Make it look more new and pretty."
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,13,Tue Jul 7 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yes it really needs it.  Maybe add another dark ride with the classic Disney characters like Mickey, Donald and Goofy based on the old cartoons."
Disneyland,3ceeok,ZoruaUnited,2,Wed Jul 8 01:06:09 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing!   Imagine that the ride starts in a theatre, like in Get A Horse, and it will travel through the screen and into all the cartoons like Steamboat Willie.   Just thinking about it makes me excited!"
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,2,Wed Jul 8 03:19:19 2015 UTC,Exactly.  It would be a great way to introduce kids to the classics as well.  Maybe show the characters changes over the years along the way.
Disneyland,3ceeok,caustickitten,10,Wed Jul 8 05:25:55 2015 UTC,There should be a few AP lines when entering the park on crazy busy days. That way there's not people standing up at the front asking a bunch of questions or taking the picture for their ticket holding up the line.
Disneyland,3ceeok,chicomandell,5,Tue Jul 7 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, this would be great.  Even 1 line for AP's would be great since it would move very quickly.  And maybe move the picture taking thing to when you exit.  Have separate line for people wanting a handstamp they can do the picture thing then."
Disneyland,3ceeok,centracing,4,Wed Jul 8 01:04:35 2015 UTC,Or better yet make people entering for the first time go through a separate booth before going to the main gate.
Disneyland,3ceeok,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've said this before: I don't need an ""AP only"" line, just a ""first entry"" line. There are far fewer people entering the park for the first time (who need things explained, pictures taken, tickets issued) than there are people who just need to scan their pass or paper ticket and go, but those few hold everyone else up. It could just be two turnstiles designated for first time entry and everyone else would move through the line much faster."
Disneyland,3ceeok,hawaiian717,3,Wed Jul 8 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"Along the lines of this, how about copying WDW and having a line where people without bags can skip the bag check lines?"

Disneyland,3ceeok,Defunct_Drone,2,Tue Jul 7 16:48:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm getting a little tired of the overly redone ""Projection"" effect for faces, scenes, etc. It has its place sure but seeing it so often is kind of giving me a peek behind the curtain so to speak. I mean look at how great the technology is for the Haunted Mansion, Pirates, and even some of the Fantasy Land rides are, and think about how long ago that was (albeit refurbishments). I'm sure there's been breakthroughs in that type technology. Don't get me wrong I love the animitronics on the Little Mermaid ride at DCA but even the ""Under the Sea"" room feels kinda dead too.  I think the Imagineers need to partner up with the people who do the illusions for modern day magicians like David Copperfield and bring that magic to the rides. But again, what do I know, I'm not an Imagineer constrained by budget/timelines etc. But this is a small gripe, I still love the place with all of my heart :)"
Disneyland,3ceeok,centracing,5,Tue Jul 7 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"I think the projections on RSR for the eyes are very realistic, I mean considering it's a cartoon car lol. Even Buzz looks good I think."

Least favorite: Hm... this is very hard to say but if I have to pick one.... Goofy's Sky School. It's not a bad ride but I feel like there's a version of it in every amusement park/carnival and the Disney theme wasn't strong. I think little kids would appreciate it more. =)   and I loved all the parades and show! =D

If a trek up to LA isn't out of the question, check out the space shuttle at the CA Science Center, the exhibits at LACMA or the Getty.  Maybe something off the beaten path like the Museum of Jurassic Technology."

As in, better get to the parking early, since all the crazies are on the street, and stick it through the thick, but still can breathe crowds later on in the day. They didn't announce anything but ""Dress in your 1955's best."" which means we hopefully shouldn't have another bag check dam incident, but you don't know how people are going to act. And for some clarification on the Parking. Disney's been closing the Mickey and friends at random intervals, this leads to people going into DTD for park parking, which then are lead to the Toy Story lot in large droves. Which makes Katella and Harbor slow to a snail's pace and other chaos."

There are jobs that pay a good wage and would be worth having for multiple decades in the resort. But they account for a small percentage of the overall roles.  When I was a Cast Member in Orlando I worked with two people that really exemplified what it means to be a Cast Member. They were well-loved by their managers and both have tried to make a career of working in Disney Parks. One worked her way into management in food and beverage and the other eventually gave up and went to work elsewhere. Both of them would have made superb supervisors or managers, but it doesn't always work out that way. Even if you are at the top of your game."

My best friend works at WDW as an electrician for a show and it's not uncommon for him to work overtime multiple weeks in a row. He had to miss a wedding he was a groomsman for due to the demanding schedule they have for him.  However, he is a top pick to work events and is expecting a promotion to crew lead any day.  My other friend is a Guest Services CM at Disneyland and transplanted from the college program. He LOVES his job but seems to always be going in on his days off or working late."

It's basically a crazy one track ups,  downs,  and turns as if your raving around and trying to cut one another of the opposing teams cycle off.  The track ahead of you is black,  but as soon as your cycle goes,  the track lights up behind you. It'd be a fun 3 min ride,  filled with amazing visuals and great music. sigh"

The seating benches have kind of a Soarin' feel, because your feet and legs hang loose, the ability of each of the benches to make hard stops and sharp turns, and the use of both real sets and wrap-around projection screens all give it this immersive and frenetic feel that no other dark ride I've ever been on has had.  Using this kind of ride tech would work as the recliner on board the Axiom, it would definitely work for the space dance, it would work for the chase through the ship...  wow... the more I think about it, the more I want this to happen.  (or to go back to Universal and ride the Harry Potter ride again.) (and I'm not even a Harry Potter fan.)"

It'd have taken over the XBox/Health center section of the deck and it'd be a half roller coaster ride and half virtual reality. Basically it'd be a set of two ride areas with three cycles. Or three boxes with two cycles. The cycles would be on Hydraulics, for the rider to move the bike to get the game to move and the rider would have a helmet/HUD screen on the cycle that gave first person view of the race. (with a few other things like placement in race and the track) It'd be a normal 3 lap race against CPU and the one other player for each ride box. (so it'd be...15 min for four people at a time? )  Best thing of it all is the races are played out for the people in line so that way guests are entertained and get some sort of idea for what to do in their time on the ride."

It's a 5 minute walk. Perfect for if you get tired in the middle of the day or need to switch shoes. They also run a lot of deals. Pay for your gas, discount if you pay in advance, etc. The rooms are clean, the staff is great, the pool is even heated. People probably think I work for the hotel because I rave about it so much, but it's our absolute favorite to stay at and super reasonable for how close it is to the park! Hope that helped a little! Have fun!!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,CanYou_Not,3,Sun Jul 5 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"We've staid at the Ramada four times now and it's awesome. I haven't been back since they finished their construction work though.  Great location to the park, a five minute walk really, it's relatively cheap, but the hotel is nice, and the pool is great as well."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,tdub2112,2,Sun Jul 5 22:56:54 2015 UTC,I am always amazed by the staff. They are always so helpful and great. It's really like they are CM's.
Disneyland,3c7m2p,CanYou_Not,3,Mon Jul 6 14:44:20 2015 UTC,Was going to recommend MainGate as well. It's wonderful.
Disneyland,3c7m2p,kelsey0403,2,Sun Jul 5 23:50:07 2015 UTC,My favorite!
Disneyland,3c7m2p,CanYou_Not,2,Mon Jul 6 14:44:30 2015 UTC,I read good and bad reviews on Yelp. I'm so conflicted!
Disneyland,3c7m2p,thelittlemiss,2,Sun Jul 5 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"The only time we ever had issues was when we had the whole family go. One of the rooms lost power for like an hour and there was some other small issue, power wouldn't have been a big deal, but it happened to be while we were back taking a nap, the staff was mortified and gave us vouchers for food somewhere close and they comped one of the nights. Which we insisted wasn't necessary, but it was nice of them to go above and beyond."

Disneyland,3c7m2p,someguyfromnz,2,Mon Jul 6 02:34:31 2015 UTC,"They were doing construction and maintenance for a while and they would start decently early, which kind of sucked. The AC drowned out most of the noise, but we were usually getting up to go to the park early anyway."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,CanYou_Not,2,Mon Jul 6 14:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was there for that, but that gave no trouble. I was surprised, given how noisy inter-room the place is, that they weren't putting any sort of insulation between rooms in the new section.  Quite enjoyed the Hotel Menage previously. Old and obviously refurbed, but tidy and comfortable. Onsite bar and restaurant definitely earnt extra points too (didn't expect to miss facilities like that as much as I did)."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,someguyfromnz,2,Mon Jul 6 21:05:22 2015 UTC,That has been on my list of places to stay for a while! I just hate that it's not closer. But the bar might make up for that! :)
Disneyland,3c7m2p,CanYou_Not,4,Mon Jul 6 22:22:05 2015 UTC,I really liked the Candy Cane Inn. It is within walking distance but they also have a free shuttle that leaves about every 30 mins. They also have a continental breakfast which can save you from having to spend money at the parks.
Disneyland,3c7m2p,georgelass,3,Mon Jul 6 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"We stayed at the Homewood suites Anaheim the last time we went to DL. Close enough to walk, (they do have a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes its 3 bucks for a day pass) we used the shuttle because we have a toddler and it was really easy.    Awesome hot breakfast.  (Eggs,  Bacon,  Sausage,  Biscuits & Gravy, Eggs Benedict homefries / hash browns , oatmeal,  Waffles and all the usual suspects of cold breakfast - cereal,  fruits,  yogurt,  pastries....)   It was a awesome hotel,  excellent beds, a separate bedroom from the living room and almost full kitchen.  Nice pool area &  sitting area's.   We booked last minute and it was way more than I expected for the price (we paid 119 a night - and booked it 2 days before we arrived) but this has become where we stay when we go to Disneyland.   Enjoy your trip!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Tattooedvixen,2,Mon Jul 6 06:23:34 2015 UTC,"On the shuttle -- did you take a stroller onto the shuttle, and was it easy? We are bringing our own stroller, and the only thing that sounds lame about the shuttle is figuring out how to get it on and off easily.   Thanks for commenting! I actually JUST finalized our reservation elsewhere, but I was tempted to switch after looking this place up. It looks great!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Tattooedvixen,2,Mon Jul 6 23:25:20 2015 UTC,"We sure did!  As a family of 5 (and an adult friend went with us) we were really comfortable as 3 adults & 3 kids ( the shuttle was so easy!  - less walking to the shuttle stop than to the Disneyland hotel) I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  We've stayed at several properties in the area (Best Western,  Candy Cane, Days inn) and none compare to this place!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Tattooedvixen,2,Tue Jul 7 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"Ages at time of Stay 10, 8 & 3. The shuttle only made 2 stops ( in the same parking lot ) it was never full or late.  This has become our property of choice for all Orange county stays!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Tattooedvixen,2,Tue Jul 7 00:05:21 2015 UTC,"We were on the first floor in a corner 1 Bedroom suite - it was really easy.  We did have to fold the stroller up on the shuttle,  but that was easy because we had a reusable bag & a backpack.   I hope wherever you stay you guys have a lovely vacation!    There was a Hilton (I think - I can't remember 100% ) next door (other shuttle stop) that had a full Starbucks inside and a giftshop & restaurant/bar. I'm a coffee hound and this was a nice bonus.  There's also a dozen + restaurants within a block and that was really helpful."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,YippysKid,2,Tue Jul 7 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"Also,  dinner is included during the week. Very convenient!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,trojanEngineer,2,Tue Jul 7 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at the Residence Inn Anaheim Maingate. It's about a 9 minute walk to the gates, has suites with a door separating the bedroom from the living room (which has a pullout couch) and hot breakfast with protein options."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,MostlyBullshitStory,2,Sun Jul 5 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"Got upgraded a nice 2 bedroom suite by slipping 20 bucks to the counter guy. Nice place, but the breakfast was terrible all around."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,wyolars,2,Sun Jul 5 21:21:11 2015 UTC,Look at the desert inn across the street. They had some sort of breakfast and they have suites. The farther you book out the cheaper they are. We stayed there a few years ago for 60 a night. Not the best hotel but we liked it. If you don't like breakfast there is a Denny's out front.
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Macbeth-is-my-cat,2,Sun Jul 5 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"We stay at The Anaheim Deseret Inn and Suites. They have a fabulous suite right above the lobby. You can walk to Disneyland really easily since it's right across the street. The breakfast isn't very big, but they do have eggs and croissants. The hotel is also right next to Denny's and within a block of MacDonalds if you need more food! The WiFi is okay enough as well. You just have to connect to the lobby WiFi instead of the regular hotel guest WiFi if you're staying in that suite. It has a great view of The Tower of Terror as well!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,bluefunnel,2,Mon Jul 6 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Last year we stayed at La Quinta Inn and Suites. It's a little further away(on the other side of the Citywalk shopping area) but I didn't mind the walk. There were two rooms separated by a sliding door. Both sides had a television, one side had a bed, the other had a sofa with a pullout bed(I think there is an option for a bunk bed also). There was a breakfast room but I think the only protein was hard boiled eggs, they did have mini-waffles though. They are a pet friendly hotel though so if you have allergies it might be an issue.    I enjoyed it but I think we will be staying at Best Western Park Place Inn just to try that out."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Vidogo,2,Mon Jul 6 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Man, this thread is making me worried. We booked the Anaheim Fairfield Inn for our September trip, and noone ever mentions it as being good. But I guess on the other hand, noone ever mentions it being bad, either."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,littlestelephant,2,Mon Jul 6 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"I've seen it highly recommended many times! It was booked when I looked into it, but I've actually stayed there before and I think it's really nice. You'll like it!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,CanYou_Not,4,Mon Jul 6 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"I work in a popular hotel brand so I think I can help out a little!  There are certain brands/chains that always have hot breakfast as a standard. Embassy suites, red lion, Hampton inn and suites are all good options there. Hilton, Hilton garden inn and doubletree have hot breakfasts but you do have to pay.   Now as far as walking distance, look at a map of the roads nearby. I also pull up the Anaheim resort transit line and figure out a hotel that's close enough to walk but has a shuttle if I need it. I've stayed in the days inn maingate and that's been a great option for light breakfast, close to the park and close to the shuttle. I usually feel comfortable walking from convention center in or from about garden grove in.   The Hampton garden grove might be my suggestion. Highly rated, hot breakfast, shuttle option (their own, so nonstop) suites, free wifi and microwaves and refrigerators in the rooms.   Some nicer properties do not have fridges in the rooms and that's another deal breaker for me.   Hope this is helpful!"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,britinichu,2,Sun Jul 5 19:16:04 2015 UTC,Fridge is a deal breaker for me too. We always take snacks and gotta have cold water!
Disneyland,3c7m2p,Reneeisme,2,Mon Jul 6 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"We've stayed at the Best Western Park Place Inn across the street twice now. We chose it because of the distance, it is right at Harbor and the main entrance for buses and shuttles. Free breakfast is available every morning from the restaurant next door, Captain Kidd - it is not super or tasty but it meets my requirements for morning calories: yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, hash browns, toast, coffee.  The place is listed as ""mini-suites"" and I don't know what that means. My visits there have always been just my and my husband, so to this point we have asked for rooms with one bed."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,misspeelled,2,Sun Jul 5 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"Was coming in to recommend the same place.  I just stayed in a mini suite; it was one room, two large beds and a pull out couch.  Plenty of room for four of us.  Very nice room.  The breakfast wasn't high quality, but it was ample, with enough variety that all of us found something to eat.  I will definitely stay here again.  And you can't beat walking just slightly further than the shuttle drop off to the gate, when going to or leaving the park.  Such a luxury.  I doubt the Grand Californian is much closer to gates."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,BigSkyVike,2,Sun Jul 5 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"We stayed here in March for 4 nights and it was a really nice place. I liked the breakfast, even if it's not the most amazing it's filling with some options. I like that it's so close, that's the best part to me."
Disneyland,3c7m2p,tekchic,2,Sun Jul 5 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"It's mine and my wife's favorite place to stay as it's only just about a 5-10 mini walk to the main entrance of both Disneyland and DCA, depending on security check point.I'm actually typing this from our room at the hotel now. We're here celebrating our 7 year wedding anniversary. It's been crazy busy here due to the 4th of July weekend. It's also great to go back to the room during the middle of the day and take a nap or eat lunch at IHOP next door. It's nice not having to drive anywhere after a long day at the park. I recommend it. 😀"
Disneyland,3c7m2p,work_while_bent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:56:46 2015 UTC,"Protein options -- Best Western Stovall's Inn. It's on Katella, which means a slightly further walk through Downtown Disney to get to Disneyland (approx. 0.6mi) -- about a 10-15 minute nice stroll.  We've stayed there three times, and the rates are great and they offer free breakfast with lots of eggs with bacon/ham/etc (which meat depends on the day). Most places don't have eggs/meat in continental breakfast, so it's our place of choice lately.  About $100-$120/night, depending on the time of year. No suites that I know of though."

The cast member was lovely - we got a 1st visit, Celebrating, Just married, Happily Ever After AND two free pins and free lanyards to put it all on! Enjoy all the good wishes the cast members send your way!"
Disneyland,3c91oc,GooseyJ,2,Mon Jul 6 04:06:42 2015 UTC,"first off, congratulations!  second, Disneyland in fall is great. the crowds have significantly diminished from spring/summer, the weather is cooler without being too cold. You can walk around all day in jeans and a t-shirt no problem. I'd bring a sweatshirt for the evenings though as the temperature drops once the sun goes down. But it's still nice out at night, probably only getting down to the mid-50s at that time of year. Since it'll be your wife's first time, be sure to get her a ""1st visit"" button by asking a castmember. Both of you can get the ""I'm celebrating"" buttons, too. And be sure ot take lots of pictures. If it's one thing I regret about doing when my wife and I went to DL for our honeymoon it was that I did not get enough pictures of us."
Disneyland,3c91oc,work_while_bent,2,Mon Jul 6 02:46:44 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! The parks shouldn't be too busy that time,so it'll be really nice. You can use a website like Touring Plans to get a more detailed look. As it is somewhat of a slower time, there may be some attractions under refurbishment getting ready for late November/December. You can look at the resort calendar about a month before to see scheduled refurbishments for your visit.  Also a month in advance, you can start making dining reservations. As it is a special time, I would look into dinner at Napa Rose at the Grand Californian. You can ask about sitting at the chef's counter where you can see into the kitchen and you can put your meal into the hands of the chef if you'd like. Just keep in mind that prices are comparable with other fine dining restaurants.  Other great experience include asking about riding in the wheel house on the Mark Twain. If you get to the park before opening, go to the Main Street Train Station to see if the Lilly Belle presidential car is running that day.   Definitely see the new Paint the Night Parade and Disneyland Forever Fireworks. If you do want to see Fantasmic! make sure to get a fastpass for it behind Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. There are a few restaurants that offer dining packages with Fantasmic! fastpasses as well."
Disneyland,3c91oc,Phoenix73180,2,Mon Jul 6 05:50:40 2015 UTC,I had my honeymoon around that time of year 3 years ago! Its a great time to go because its not super crowded. BUT some of the rides were closed for refurb (Indiana Jones among them) and that was kinda crappy.  One of the nicest things was that we saw the park get Christmassy over the week that we were there!  We also noticed that it started to get cooler around 3.30 each afternoon and that we'd have to put warmer clothes on as the day went by!  Enjoy! :)

Head to Town Hall at opening, and if the car is running that day, you can reserve a spot. (But you didn't hear it from me!)"
Disneyland,3c5922,glitterwrists,6,Sun Jul 5 06:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yep! But the less people that know about it, the better. I could only imagine the masses all wanting to take a ride on the Lilly Belle."

Anyway, I remember hearing that it was actually out in one of the hotels and thinking that was disappointing.  But now I'm wondering, was it over pirates the whole time?  And what else do they use it for?"

Disneyland,3c7qvk,Phoenix73180,2,Sun Jul 5 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"In regards to being issued DAS, I would just keep in mind that it is issued out on a case by case basis. If you do speak to someone on the phone they are not a part of Guest Relations. Only Guest Relations can issue the service after speaking to the guest in person about their concerns about the park and what about the lines they may have trouble with. If the concerns are mobility based, Guest Relations may suggest using an assistive device. Just be prepared for that.   If your MIL does have a wheel chair, walker, cane or anything else she uses to help her get around I would definitely have her bring it. The service is more meant for those concerns that using an assistive device won't help out, but again it is on a case by case basis depending on the needs of the guest. Just be prepared for that. When you get to the resort be sure to stop by City Hall or the Camber of Commerce to have that conversation. You can also go to any of the Guest Relations kiosks marked with an ""I"" on the map. The lines won't be as long and they can have that conversation with you at any of those as well. You don't need to bring any type of medical documentation as cast members are not allowed to look at it or ask for proof.  Sorry for the wall of text,but I just want you to be prepared and I hope it helps."

Disneyland,3c5epr,Aamberglar,13,Sat Jul 4 23:35:16 2015 UTC,Carthay Circle is stunning as well and worthy of consideration if you'll also be in California Adventure. You'll want reservations for any of the nice restaurants at the resort.
Disneyland,3c5epr,hawaiian717,2,Sun Jul 5 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I enjoy eating at, Carthay too much. It has an amazing atmosphere and is a beautiful place. Definitely a place  everyone has to eat at, at least once."

Disneyland,3c5epr,disneyfacts,7,Sun Jul 5 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"Blue Bayou is the best place in Disneyland, a slightly cheaper version is Cafe Orleans. You can make reservations at blue Bayou at least, those open 60 days in advance (though most likely you can get a table the day of, but it will likely be lunch or very late at night)."
Disneyland,3c5epr,rycar,2,Sun Jul 5 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"Just ate at Blue Bayou, it is my new favorite restaurant at DLR.  Second would be Carthay Circle, followed by Steakhouse 55."

Disneyland,3c5epr,disneyfacts,3,Sun Jul 5 02:09:11 2015 UTC,It may be that way during the day - I last went near its closing time so it was full but not cramped I guess.

Rarely does the park hit maximum capacity on the 4th, but that doesn't mean it isn't a zoo. But with it being a Saturday, and the 60th this year, you could be in for a madhouse.

Disneyland,3c022o,HelloInterwebz,6,Fri Jul 3 18:31:37 2015 UTC,"It seems nowadays, most people flock to that ride to try to get it ""out of the way"" first thing in morning. You know, try to beat the lines that will inevitably get worse throughout the day; maybe they couldn't snag a FastPass. However, when thousands of people have the same idea that you do, the lines get horrendous anyway.   I went to Disney World in May and my group did Peter Pan's Flight around 11pm and even then the standby time was 45 minutes.   The ride is just so classic and nostalgic, I think it's always going to have the long lines. It's just part of the ride at this point."

When I went for my birthday last September though the cast member watched my cousins and I jog all the way down fantasyland to get there in time, then chained off the entrance literally right when we reached her. When we pointed out that we still had a few minutes until closing, she said she couldn't undo the chain once she's closed off the entrance, so I guess YMMV with that tactic."

Disneyland,3c022o,Shatteredreality,6,Fri Jul 3 22:52:44 2015 UTC,"Post contains spoilers:  So we rode it today and I may be in the minority but I thought the updates were lackluster.   When we were there the posted time was 60 mins but my wife has a knee injury so we opted for the DAS system. Disney added the new DAS system to the ride so now you get a return time rather than just a walk on like some of the other dark rides (which I'm completely ok with, I thought the other system was super unfair).   The return time was about 1hr and 30 minutes out and when we returned there was a 15 minute wait to actually get on the ride.   All that having been said if you've seen the fly through on youtube you are probably aware of the changes:   Re-imagined nursery scene  New projection effects over London, brighter London in general. Improved water effects in Neverland and Tiger Lilly scenes   I'm sure there are some other changes but there was nothing as drastic as the Alice in Wonderland upgrades we got last year.   There was one effect I was really enjoyed by but was super easy to miss:  As you fly over London and go by Big Ben if you look really carefully at the clock face, on the second side you pass you will see a projection mapping of Peter and the Children landing on the hands of the clock. (in the video linked in this thread its just as peter says ""Second star to the right and straight on until morning"" ). I haven't found any videos that show it yet and my wife missed it as we were on the ride but I really thought it was a cool addition.   Overall it's a great attraction but I was disappointed in the small scope of the changes I will probably only ride again once the crowds die down."
Disneyland,3c022o,Veearrsix,2,Sat Jul 4 00:26:19 2015 UTC,I caught them flying away out of the corner of my eye. That's part of what I mean by it being too fast. They need to slow it down a little so you can really look around and see things like that
Disneyland,3c022o,luigifangirl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, can confirm. Just got back, checked the ride a couple times and never once saw it below 60 minutes.

The basketball court in the Matterhorn used to be a half-court, but after a remodel, they had to make it smaller. :)  Other ""secrets"" that aren't true:  The golden spike under the castle has never marked the center of the park. It was a surveyors mark used to line up the drawbridge with the center of Main St.  Disneyland does not have a full system of underground tunnels like WDW. There are some parts of backstage Disneyland that go underground, but they're not really ""tunnels"". I've only been through some backstage areas of Disneyland, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. :)  Not all of Tomorrowland's plants are edible. I really wouldn't recommend snacking on them.

Disneyland,3c05yj,TopHat1935,2,Sat Jul 4 04:00:22 2015 UTC,Were there actually claims of edible plants in tomorrowland?
Disneyland,3c05yj,camkeys,6,Sat Jul 4 23:52:27 2015 UTC,"Yes! Walt believed Tomorrowland should also celebrate an agriculture of the future, so he made sure most of the plants in the land were edible. Some still are.. but that doesn't mean they're tasty."
Disneyland,3c05yj,glitterwrists,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, many are edible in theory but they still use pesticides and stuff on them."
Disneyland,3c05yj,bubblesugarsocks,2,Sun Jul 5 05:14:52 2015 UTC,"There are TONS of edibles growing in tomorrowland. Everywhere you look. The food you eat is grown with pesticides too- even organic foods. There are chiles, herbs, citrus, night shades like eggplant and tomatoes, onions, pomegranates, kale and other brassicas, and so much more. It's all edible- I've eaten plenty. Not dead, not sick, it's just food, growing in dirt. Just as Walt would have wanted."
Disneyland,3c05yj,super_luminal,-2,Sun Jul 5 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"Well, the pesticides on edibles in the market are made with people eating them in mind (and you are still instructed to wash before eating, though I often forget). I was told the gardens in Disneyland are more like what you would use on your flowers or lawn. Also, people puke and throw trash in there. I'm glad you're not dead though!"
Disneyland,3c05yj,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"There are only two major tunnels in regular use at Disneyland. The one by the Harbor bus drop off that connects backstage Disneyland with backstage California Adventure. And the Tomorrowland tunnel from behind Innoventions, past the Tomorrowland Terrace and to the backside of Pixie Hollow. It is mainly used to load in the bands for the stage at TLT, and to remove the trash from TLT. There is also the old section of the rocket rods queue that runs under the LGM store to the old peoplemover station, though that is rarely used.  Now the Grand California/DTD and the Disneyland Hotel have extensive basement areas that extend a lot farther than you'd think, but they aren't ""tunnels"" per say."
Disneyland,3c05yj,TaonasSagara,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"Just to verify, the expanding room in HM is not an actual elevator system. It is a hydraulic system. So instead of there being gears pulling it up and down, the system pushes it up and down. This is why you are asked to move to the center of the room. Over time, if the weight is unbalanced over so many ups and downs, the floor can actually start to tilt and the room needs repairing (fun fact, if you see rips in the wallpaper, it means the floor has started to tilt, so it's time for work to be done).  WDW is actually the opposite where the ceiling moves upward since there was no need to go underground because there was so much space.   Basically, the only parts of ride underground are the hallway and very beginning, followed by a bulk of the graveyard and the exit. You can figure it out pretty quickly when it goes up and back down again."
Disneyland,3c05yj,stormeegedon,3,Sat Jul 4 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"IIRC, WDW is the opposite because the water table was much closer to ground level. It was easier to raise the ceiling than lower the floor. That may be apocryphal information though."
Disneyland,3c05yj,sircastor,2,Sat Jul 4 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's built on pretty much a swamp, which definitely helped in the decision making. But it's definitely a lot easier to just not dig underground no matter where you are if you don't have to."
Disneyland,3c05yj,stormeegedon,2,Sat Jul 4 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"That's what I've heard! From what I've read, the Disneyland version has a working elevator because part of the Mansion needed to be underground to avoid the train tracks. The WDW doesn't have that issue, so they didn't need the stretching portrait room to act as an actual elevator."

If it was something serious you may not be able to be rehire into attractions or Disneyland at all. That would be unusual but its happened before.  As far as pay goes I think from what I know about my CM friends in stores its probably not much more then 9.80 if at all.
Disneyland,3c1k2t,walteliasdisney,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:42:09 2015 UTC,"It was, officially, ""Using a personal electronic device while operating heavy machinery"". The situation was that I was working Golden Zephyr as Co-Pilot (the 2nd bloke on the flight deck that operates the 2nd control panel and watches the gates while the Pilot spiels and then unlocks the gates). While I was stepped away from the panel, and while the Pilot was still speiling, I checked my phone in my pocket for time; I didn't pull the phone out, merely slightly pulled it up so as to see the clock on it. That was it. No injuries or incidents resulted from this (other than me getting terminated).  As per the managers that handed me my walking papers I can still get rehired, but it's ""highly unlikely"" that I'd get back into Attractions."

Disneyland,3c1cn7,somewheresomeday,3,Fri Jul 3 21:26:36 2015 UTC,No part of the park is actually closed for fireworks it is just very difficult to move around. So its best to plan out where you want to be around the time the first Paint the Night parade starts.  The only show that requires a fastpass is Fantasmic. They distribute in the morning for the first show then once those run out they distribute for the second. You can get those down big thunder trail by the Big Thunder Barbecue.
Disneyland,3c1cn7,walteliasdisney,2,Fri Jul 3 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"Fantasyland from castle to carousel always closes for pyro. If it's windy they will close castle to Small World and Steam Trains. Toontown always closes.  As for getting around the park, it's generally in the east (TL) side and out the west (Adventureland) side. To get into Westside it's in Frontierland, out Adventureland. You may need to walk all the way around the Hub to get to Westside. I know it's annoying but it really does help traffic flow."

So I took the overpass from Frontierland, through Adventureland, past the Jolly Holiday Bakery, and across Main Street to my spot in front of Plaza Inn.  There were no obstructions in my path other than a sea of humans moving like molasses.   I think the reason I took the overpass through Adventureland rather than going past Pirates of the Caribbean was that that direction was roped off."

It should be noted that the summer of 1959 was the first summer where Guest Relations had Guided Tours (the first-ever Guided Tours were in September of 1958) -- hence why the SOP states that they are unsure whether they would continue through the summer. Obviously, since Disneyland still offers these tours to this day (although they're a bit more expensive), they kept being offered.  I also like that under the ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section there is a dedicated question specifically asking about where the Autopia is (which was by far the most popular ride in the park at that time). Also of note is how First Aid had a second location during peak season in the Mickey Mouse Club Theatre (where Pinocchio's Daring Journey is today)."

I don't remember much else of the visit, except the Sword in the Stone mini-show in front of King Arthur's carousel.   Me and my folk's could see a nice sized crowd gathered watching Merlin start the show with the usual fanfare. I couldn't really see from my low vantage point, so I asked my mom if I could go round to the right where I saw a small gathering of other kids watching. I'm an only-child, so with no other siblings my mom said, ""Yes, but after this show, stay right there!"" I nodded and proceed to the group of kids and watched as Merlin went about his schtick.  I couldn't really hear Merlin from the side of the stage because he was addressing the crowd more in front of him and I was about 5 or 6 kids from the chain marking the perimeter. What suddenly caught my attention was one of the band members had come over to the group and nearly everyone else's hand had shot straight up and kids started begging, ""Me! Me! Pick me! PICK ME!"" I was at such a loss thinking, ""Wait, what? What are we getting? More buttons!?""  This band member didn't even seem to acknowledge the other kids. He stepped over the chain, waded through the arms and looked down at me. ""Hi, what's your name?"" He asked.  ""B-Brian..."" I stammered.  ""Do you want to help us out today?""  ""Yeah, yes. Sure!""  Looking back now, it's hilarious to think what was going through my parent's heads when unbeknownst to them, they're kid strolls out and pulls the Sword from the Stone.

We always explained our idea to the characters and character hosts beforehand, and did what they asked us to do. A few of the characters actually held the sign (Tigger actually smudged it with his chin in his excitement), but a lot of the character hosts asked us to hold it instead and they wouldn't use the PhotoPass cameras, just our phones.

It starts getting pretty crowded at around 7-8pm, people will even start finding spots even at 6:30 - 7 ish. Best of luck! :)"
Disneyland,3bzsjv,iJonMai,3,Fri Jul 3 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"If it's just you, I would sneak in right about the time CMs start making people stand up, because a lot of spots suddenly become available. I found a curb spot on main street last week beside a trash can in front of the Emporium around 8. I left before the fireworks, though, I was just there for the parade."
Disneyland,3bzsjv,bubblesugarsocks,2,Fri Jul 3 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"Over by small world there are spots available even a half hour before, and then you can move to the front of small world to see the fireworks and projections. Its one of the best spots to view vith no hassle."

Disneyland,3bwhpt,natemc,2,Thu Jul 2 20:05:55 2015 UTC,They should all be easy to find with google. Disney is always willing to give out recipes so they find their way online all the time

Disneyland,3byq03,ghostsofstars,3,Fri Jul 3 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely make reservations for a special dinner. The best places in the parks are the Blue Bayou in Disneyland and Carthay Circle Theater in DCA. You can make reservations for special seatings that give you tickets to the best viewing sections for Fantasmic and World of Color respectively.  If you're looking for fine dining, try for reservations at Napa Rose in the Grand Californian. It's a true fine dining restaurant, perfect for an anniversary."

Disneyland,3byq03,Techsupportvictim,3,Sat Jul 4 13:52:38 2015 UTC,"Don't feel rushed to go on everything and see everything in a day as an Annual Passholder. I remember when I use to buy tickets and would try to arrive early as possible to make it worth it. As an AP, I get to Disneyland casually, stroll around, go on a few rides here and there, watch parades, take advantage of my AP discounts, all that jazz because you have all the time in the world to hit other spots on other days :)"
Disneyland,3byq03,iJonMai,2,Fri Jul 3 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"You should get an annual pass. However, August 8th is blocked out for all but the fanciest AP and August 7th is blocked out for some of them as well (see https://disneyland.disney.go.com/passes/blockout-dates/ ). On the day that you buy your annual pass you can get in regardless of whether your pass is blocked out, but for this trip, unless you get the Premiere pass, you'll still need to buy tickets for one of the days. Depending on how soon you'll be back it might be better to wait to buy your pass til then.   Have fun!"
Disneyland,3byq03,RainbowMagicSparkles,2,Fri Jul 3 23:29:41 2015 UTC,"Can you still upgrade your ticket to an annual pass? If so, I think OP should buy a 2 day park hopper so no block out and plan to upgrade it to an AP on the second day.  My 2 cents."
Disneyland,3byq03,dewdrinker19,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone! I am thinking of going for the premium AP so I don't have to worry about blackout dates. I also feel like the free parking and higher discount make it worth the extra $$. I am so excited for my first visit! I've been to Disney World a few times, but I know Disneyland has a different vibe, not to mention different attractions."
Disneyland,3bw0pj,zulubowie,7,Thu Jul 2 16:43:21 2015 UTC,"1) If you get there about 30 minutes before opening, you should be able to get to the front gate by opening (give or take 10 minutes).  If you want to be really careful, get to the parking garage 40-45 min before park opening.  This will give you those sweet first 2-3 hours in the park when fastpasses are a plenty and lines are short.  2) Yeah, make sure the bottles are sealed and it doesn't look like you're bringing a full meal in like Kramer.  3) I'd do Peter Pan first because it JUST reopened and lines will be EXTREMELY long.  Also pick up a fast pass ASAP depending on what types of rides the kids like.   4)  True.  Unfortunately the Winnie the Pooh ride is mediocre.  But alas, you still have Splash Mountain."
Disneyland,3bw0pj,collegemathchef,2,Thu Jul 2 19:29:08 2015 UTC,I enjoyed Bear Country but Winnie the Pooh is neat. My nieces have grown up with some Pooh stuff
Disneyland,3bw0pj,vette91,2,Thu Jul 2 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, thank you."
Disneyland,3bw0pj,reinevogue,2,Thu Jul 2 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"1) The trip from the parking garage can take anywhere from 15-45 minutes. It depends on how many people are trying to get on the trams, how fast the trams are coming back to pick up/drop off people, and how fast you walk after being dropped off.   2) Backpacks with water and food are OK, I was just at the park yesterday and many people who had water and snacks were let in.  3) I personally like to do lands other than Fantasyland in the morning because I know many small children and their families will be on those rides in the morning and less at night because they're sleepy/tired.   I hope you have a great trip! Hopefully I answered all these questions correctly. Anybody feel free to correct me so that OP can get accurate info. :-)"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,YoeSafBridge,2,Thu Jul 2 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of going at night! Obviously I haven't tried Fantasyland in the evening, but I'll be sure to give it a go when I go to the parks!"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,bubblesugarsocks,2,Thu Jul 2 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of Fantasyland closes down at night though, so take that into account. The parade impacts some rides briefly and the fireworks others. There's always signage posted letting you know when."
Disneyland,3bw0pj,YoeSafBridge,2,Thu Jul 2 21:01:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!
Disneyland,3bw0pj,chicklette,2,Thu Jul 2 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"We always do fantasyland at night because most people with small kids head out after the fireworks.  Still, the lines can get pretty long.  If you have a smart phone, get a wait time app - that will make your day so much more awesome!"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,YoeSafBridge,2,Thu Jul 2 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"I've got a wait time app, we used it last November, and it seemed to be fairly accurate."

Disneyland,3bw0pj,chicklette,2,Thu Jul 2 22:46:14 2015 UTC,I use disneyland wait times for android.

Disneyland,3bw0pj,sableine,2,Thu Jul 2 23:31:11 2015 UTC,"1.) Sorry, I don't drive to the parks. I live too far away, so I splurge on a nearby hotel and walk over!  2.) As long as you don't have glass containers, you're going to be fine. They will look through the bag at the secruity check, but I've never seen anyone have an issue with snacks and such.  3.) Thats sort of the reccomended plan of attack if you look at travel blogs. Mostly because Peter Pan doesn't have a FP option and the lines can get crazy long. The one thing I'd mention if this is the way you want to go (I like it) is that there are early magic hours at each park alternating through the week. I'd suggest not going to do this plan of attack on the EMH in DL, because hotel guests have already had an hour to get in and create some big lines.   4.) I know :( I miss it like crazy!  Most important though, HAVE A GREAT TIME!"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,LazerMcBlazer,2,Thu Jul 2 19:28:48 2015 UTC,So helpful and thank you.
Disneyland,3bw0pj,sableine,2,Thu Jul 2 23:29:10 2015 UTC,"For question 3, do the baby rides ASAP!! I've been  during the emptiest part of the season  (post-Labor Day) and during some of the busiest (Halloween and Christmas) and without a doubt, Snow White, Pinocchio, Wind in the Willows, and Peter Pan  get the longest lines the earliest because they're mellow, family friendly, and basically a cornerstone of Disneyland.  My family always kind of regrets going to the baby rides and wasting all that time waiting in lines for  what are ostensibly outdated rides ( I love Peter Pan and Pinocchio but they seriously need a revamping. Nostalgia only helps so much). So I'd say knock out the obligatory rides when the lines are the shortest"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,glitterwrists,2,Thu Jul 2 20:08:03 2015 UTC,Thanks bud.

Disneyland,3bw0pj,Techsupportvictim,2,Fri Jul 3 00:58:37 2015 UTC,Peter Pan's Flight actually reopened a couple days ago! :)
Disneyland,3bw0pj,Vidogo,2,Fri Jul 3 03:43:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on which lot. Count on a good thirty minutes, plus walking through bag check. Yes. If it's more than a personal sized water bottle for each of you and some small snacks you'll have to get a locker for it. Can't take it in the park.  Good plan. If you have tickets to go to DCA and both kids are at least 40 inches    Cars land for the Racers is a must go first thing one day. It gets crazy full fast and fast passes are a nightmare cause most folks go to do that right at rope drop.   Other things to note.    No selfie sticks. They have been banned for safety reasons.   Parade viewing fills up crazy fast. Like a good two hours before. The kids will likely love the light up parade but seating will be a bear. Try to make friends with another family group so you can watch each other's spot for bathroom trips, getting snacks etc. and the kids can entertain each other  Autograph/photo books are a great souvenir. If you don't want to drop $20 a pop for official ones, hit a book store like Barnes & Noble for a blank book for each of them. They can decorate it. Have characters autograph a page and put a printed photo on the facing. Staff will happily take photos with your camera so you don't have to spend a fortune on photo pass shots. They can add photos from around the park etc. cool show and tell for school even (if kids are into that these days)"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,Techsupportvictim,2,Fri Jul 3 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Parade viewing question!  Do you think the two hours before thing will hold true in, say, September?"
Disneyland,3bw0pj,YippysKid,3,Fri Jul 3 11:38:53 2015 UTC,You might be okay in September but since it's an anniversary year maybe not. It's a hard call
Disneyland,3bw0pj,mamamonkey,2,Fri Jul 3 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah true. I figure especially for the Paint the Night Parade, since it's new.  I'm not worried though - we'll be in the parks for almost a full five days. Plenty of time to take our time!"

Disneyland,3bw0pj,glitterwrists,2,Fri Jul 3 13:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit of a hoarder as well as a photographer so scrapbooks etc are my heaven. And I have seen parents at the park go nuts trying to keep kids from wanting EVERYTHING. I get it, I'm a huge kid at heart. I met a sweet pair of twins in line that had done just what I mentioned and it was so cool I recommend it to everyone with kids. Their parents mentioned that the grandparents did actually give each one of them $100 (it was a birthday visit so that was their present) and any fancy cups, tee shirts, fancy ears and the like they had to buy themselves. That's perhaps something else you could do with your kids. Not that much money maybe but a set 'fun fund'.,"

Disneyland,3bryo7,bubblesugarsocks,2,Thu Jul 2 03:36:17 2015 UTC,I just purchased a vintage Disneyland Pendleton skirt suit originally sold at the frontierland exhibit and it's going to be wayyyyyyy too hot to wear it! But I feel almost obligated now lol maybe I'll just suffer through it.

Disneyland,3btv1n,FirstFloorGenerator,13,Thu Jul 2 02:43:00 2015 UTC,The day you buy your pass you are allowed in to both parks. So yes you could get in if you bought your pass on July 4th. Would I do it? Probably not. The crowds are gonna suuuuuuuuck
Disneyland,3btv1n,Umpers,2,Thu Jul 2 06:55:05 2015 UTC,Do you think this will be the case on July 17?
Disneyland,3btv1n,13goingon30,9,Thu Jul 2 07:02:22 2015 UTC,The 17th is the anniversary date of Disneyland so it might actually be the worst day of the year xD
Disneyland,3btv1n,Umpers,2,Thu Jul 2 07:17:46 2015 UTC,Oh boy. And yet they are not doing anything additional or special.
Disneyland,3btv1n,13goingon30,4,Thu Jul 2 19:31:10 2015 UTC,They are. They have a ceremony and are inviting guests to come to the park in formal attire just like it was in 1955. And they have some special photo opportunities as well throughout the park.
Disneyland,3btv1n,DDotJ,-1,Thu Jul 2 20:08:00 2015 UTC,Meh. That's not as exciting as being open for 24 hours straight like in May.
Disneyland,3btv1n,13goingon30,2,Thu Jul 2 20:27:10 2015 UTC,That was TOO exciting. And the one in May was already the special event for the 60th Anniversary.

Disneyland,3btv1n,Brenda13k,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:17:37 2015 UTC,I have an unredeemed so cal pass gift ticket can we go inside with that one on a blocked out day?
Disneyland,3btv1n,RinconDrone,6,Thu Jul 2 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"Ok so it sounds like you bought a SoCal Select Annual Pass in February of 2014.  If you renewed your pass in February of this year then the answer is no, you cannot get a day pass for a blacked out day.   If you let your pass lapse and are looking to rebuy then yes you can get a day pass for the 4th (or any other blacked out day) by purchasing it that day.   Disney also used to offer ""Blackout Passes"" that were discounted tickets that could be purchased to give people access on blacked out days but they stopped offering them a little over a year ago.   Long story short you can access the park on the day you purchase or renew a pass even if it is normally blacked out. If you currently have a pass and it's blacked out your options are to upgrade it to a pass that is not blacked out or to pay full admission ($155) for the day."
Disneyland,3btv1n,Shatteredreality,2,Thu Jul 2 08:11:49 2015 UTC,"Are you purchasing the passes on Saturday? If so, you're golden. Passes are always valid on the date of purchase, regardless of if that particular day is a blackout for the pass you purchased or not.  If you renewed back in February, then the only ways to get in would be to upgrade your passes or purchase single day tickets."
Disneyland,3btv1n,stevensokulski,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:17:57 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone! I know there will be crowds but I'm moving in a few weeks and will be coming down maybe once or twice more this year and this Saturday is the only available day I'm able to go before I leave. Every place will be packed anyways so I might as well go to the happiest place on earth haha :) Thanks again!
Disneyland,3btv1n,deekari,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"No, to get in on a blockout date they charge like 70 or 80 bucks I believe.  But honestly Saturday is going to be packed and hot, I would say save the money and skip it."
Disneyland,3btv1n,mildly_interesting,6,Thu Jul 2 06:12:54 2015 UTC,They no longer sell the blackout date tickets for annual pass holders
Disneyland,3btv1n,collegemathchef,5,Thu Jul 2 14:57:29 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  It sounds like a great idea until you're there in 90-100 degree heat, waiting 80 minutes for Space Mountain and boiling alive."
Disneyland,3btv1n,rhetorichopslop,2,Thu Jul 2 07:18:28 2015 UTC,This isn't true if you're renewing or upgrading your annual pass that day.
Disneyland,3brz26,EatingPizzaAllDay,12,Wed Jul 1 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"Splash Mountain is usually closed during that time of year for refurbishments. Source.   Sometimes I think they don't even refurbish the ride, they just close it during the off-season to cut down on the expensive cost of operating a water ride.  EDIT: looking back at the website, I just realized that the source is referring to MK, not DL. Still, the Splash Mountain in DL is usually closed during January, if memory serves. I'll get back with a source on that."
Disneyland,3brz26,elizabeaver,2,Wed Jul 1 20:15:59 2015 UTC,"Just as far as anecdotal evidence goes, Splash is always down at the beginning of the year. I agree with you about the changes though. It doesn't seem like they do anything when the ride is down."
Disneyland,3brz26,johncosta,9,Thu Jul 2 07:33:45 2015 UTC,"If Disney and Anaheim can come to an agreement, roughly 2 billion dollars in updates will start coming sooner than later.  I'm hoping to see updates to the little things; paint, wood rot, bathrooms (for eff sakes, Tokyo Disney has soap dispensers that spits out soap in the shape of Mickey ears), stuff like that"
Disneyland,3brz26,klaceo,9,Wed Jul 1 22:49:29 2015 UTC,Jungle Cruise now has its own holiday overlay so that may be down as well.
Disneyland,3brz26,Hyro0o0,4,Wed Jul 1 18:39:22 2015 UTC,I think Snow White or Pinocchio will get an update just like Alice and Peter got.
Disneyland,3brz26,incride,5,Wed Jul 1 20:25:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if these went behind walls in the next year or two. The Alice enhancements seem to have been very well received (evidenced by the wait times that ride seems to generate on any given day) and from the early reviews Peter Pan's updates also look to be good enhancements for a classic ride. I imagine there are some similar things that could be done to Snow White and/or Pinocchio as well - updated scenes or extra audio-animatronics, and I'm sure there is some room for a projection or two :)"
Disneyland,3brz26,WaitForSpring,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:33:19 2015 UTC,I believe all the Fantasyland dark rides are going to get upgrades to varying degrees -- I remember reading somewhere that Toad's most likely going to be up next.
Disneyland,3brz26,fantasialopez,5,Fri Jul 3 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I like to visit in February. We didn't in '15, but did in '13 and '14. Both of those trips Splash Mountain was closed. In '13, Grizzly River Run was down during our trip. I think a lot of the water-based attractions go down at that time of year since it's not hot enough to enjoy getting splashed. I also remember the Pirate Lair (is that it's called?) was closed because the canoes, raft, other means to get to the island were closed last year."
Disneyland,3brz26,collegemathchef,3,Wed Jul 1 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no idea.  Assuming none of this year's refurbs get refurbed again... Hmmm.  What else could they add new projections to?  -Mr. Toad  I'm also wondering if Space Mountain will get ""plussed"" in coming years."

Disneyland,3brz26,johncosta,3,Wed Jul 1 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"It's funny though, because if memory serves it has the same ride system as RSR which is almost never down."
Disneyland,3brz26,stevensokulski,3,Thu Jul 2 01:40:03 2015 UTC,"RSRs ride system is based on Test Track in Florida. A sort of slot-car system.  Indiana Jones pre-dated that system by about 4 years. The Indy ride vehicles have a whole lot more tech happening in the vehicle, though. The amount of movement in the body of the vehicle is incredible, whereas the Test Track / RSR vehicles just move along the track."
Disneyland,3brz26,SmartestDumbTeen,3,Thu Jul 2 07:35:35 2015 UTC,"That does seem like a pretty good candidate for a lengthy refurb. It had a short bit of downtime earlier this year but it's been a few years since the last big maintenance, and it sounds like it's due for another."
Disneyland,3brz26,stevensokulski,6,Thu Jul 2 14:39:50 2015 UTC,Im curious what component makes it unable to stay functioning for a full day.
Disneyland,3brz26,izookie,4,Wed Jul 1 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"The technical complexity of the vehicles is high, and they're getting quite old.  I don't have any direct knowledge of the situation, but it would seem that a fleet of new vehicles would be needed to keep the ride moving efficiently."
Disneyland,3brz26,MonorailBlack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:56 2015 UTC,I have heard that any hats or glasses that get into the vehicle track can cause the whole ride to shut down and maintenance has to locate the objects and remove them before they can start up. Safety 1st. I don't understand why people insist on wearing hats or glasses even after being told to secure them by the seat belt check CM. I suppose this is like the selfie stick problem. Common sense ain't that common.
Disneyland,3brz26,izookie,2,Thu Jul 2 14:41:06 2015 UTC,Splash Mountain often gets an annual refurb starting in January.
Disneyland,3brz26,collegemathchef,2,Thu Jul 2 17:07:11 2015 UTC,You're on the right track by looking at historical refurb closures on MousePlanet. I believe they do try to change up the schedule so people who visit at the same time each year get a chance to experience everything at least once.
Disneyland,3btqts,dewdrinker19,3,Thu Jul 2 02:03:28 2015 UTC,Best way to be sure is to call pass holder services and ask ((714) 781-7277).
Disneyland,3btqts,Shatteredreality,2,Thu Jul 2 08:22:52 2015 UTC,"You can renew starting about a month before your pass expires, so if it expires August 7th you can probably renew as Deluxe (without paying the difference) in like 5 days!"
Disneyland,3btqts,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:34:04 2015 UTC,But they won't be able to use the Deluxe until August 7th. I renewed my pass from SoCal that was supposed to expire 04/22 to Premium the 10th of April but I couldn't use my Premium pass until the 22nd. =/
Disneyland,3btqts,TotoTheBunny,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:16:50 2015 UTC,Really? My Deluxe pass was set to expire the end of March and I renewed to Premium in February and I had free parking and all that jazz immediately.

Disneyland,3btqts,TotoTheBunny,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"Online, and used it on my trip a week later. However, this was the day before the prices went up this year and a few policies changed (like parking on lower tiers), maybe this was one of them?"
Disneyland,3btqts,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:44:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you can just upgrade your current pass, then it will renew at the upgraded level."
Disneyland,3btqts,chicklette,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:03:32 2015 UTC,"If I upgrade my current pass then I will have to pay the difference in full for two months.  Since it is both my wife and my passes, that would be $500 extra dollars for two months...  :("
Disneyland,3btqts,chicklette,-1,Thu Jul 2 06:18:37 2015 UTC,Are you sure?  My understanding was that they prorate the difference.
Disneyland,3btqts,stevensokulski,3,Thu Jul 2 06:24:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is prorated. Otherwise you could get a cheaper pass and only upgrade for a month or two at the end for very little money.  When I've upgraded from Premium to Premier in the past, always within 3 months of pass expiring, I've paid the full difference between what I paid for my pass, and what the Premier is selling for at the time of the upgrade."
Disneyland,3btqts,chicklette,2,Thu Jul 2 14:15:48 2015 UTC,Wow!  Thanks for that.  That's a crazy policy!
Disneyland,3btqts,epotosi,3,Thu Jul 2 16:59:49 2015 UTC,They do not prorate. You have to pay the full amount.
Disneyland,3btqts,RinconDrone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:41:56 2015 UTC,Similar Question I have a SoCal pass that I got my mom as a give for mothers day she hasnt redeemed the ticket yet but we wanted to go this week. How much would we have to pay for the deluxe pass. FYI I'm still paying it monthly.
Disneyland,3btqts,bubblesugarsocks,3,Thu Jul 2 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"If you are upgrading, you pay the difference. So if your pass is (say) $400 and you're upgrading to a $600 pass, you pay the $200 difference right then and continue paying the however much a month you have been. That's why OP is reluctant to upgrade two months before their pass expires because paying $200 extra just for a month is dumb."

Disneyland,3btxzi,Han_Doble,5,Thu Jul 2 03:10:56 2015 UTC,Avoid the Halloween party days then if you can. Disneyland gets closed off after a certain time unless you have a ticket and your only option would be CA Adventure. All rides should be running unless they are already scheduled for a long closure for refurbishment. Halloween decorations should all be up by then and Christmas stuff doesn't come in until later in November.
Disneyland,3btxzi,EyeZer0,2,Thu Jul 2 03:18:24 2015 UTC,I went on Oct 27th last year and I stayed from opening until the Halloween party.  It was extremely empty and I went on 19 attractions.  It was amazing

Halloween is a great time with all the decorations up."

Disneyland,3btxzi,AmberHeartsDisney,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:59 2015 UTC,The Food and Wine Festival.  Halloween everywhere.  It will still not be super busy.  Just do not go to MK on the same day as MNSSHP.   I personally think October is the best month to go.  The weather is good the food and wine festival is happening and the crowds are moderate.  It is possible you can be there during a lovebug week though.    http://everythingwdisneyworld.com/2012/03/all-you-ever-wanted-to-know-or-not/

Disneyland,3btxzi,AmberHeartsDisney,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"I was looking at October as well.  I think either the first week or last week would be the best. I check touringplans.com, been using them for years.  Look at the historical data.  If you are talking about the last week of Sept/first week of Oct, crowds should be fine.  The first full week of October will be pretty busy.  i would lean toward the last week in October, kids will have Halloween parties at school, vacation crowds might be lighter.    Haunted Mansion goes down in September for the holiday overlay, same with Space Mountain.  Everything should be open when you go (pending scheduled refurbishments and rides going down).  I think they are trying to avoid any major closures this year due to the 60th anniversary."
Disneyland,3btxzi,ScuzzDP7,0,Thu Jul 2 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"We usually go early to mid October and have never had a problem with major rides being closed, except for the time Indy was closed for most of the year. But my kids are young, so we haven't ridden very many ""big"" rides."

You can have go pros with out selfie sticks and you can have selfie sticks without GoPros.  Disney has always been very lax with their loose article problem. So now that selfie sticks are becoming very popular (funny how we used to make fun of the Asian tourists for using them) Disney was having issues on their rides. And think about it.. Having them in a park like that, it causes traffic flow problems. People are more likely to stop and take selfies with a selfie stick than without one."

Selfie sticks weren't really the issue at all. The rides the detectors are added to can cause things to fly out of pockets very easily. Great for the GP that doesn't know any better..

It's too bad because outside of the rides it's fun to have a little self conversation with your family members with these. I have a half dozen i watch from time to time that I took with my family when we were walking the main streets of Disney or on our way there.

UNLESS, you work on that notion between now and then so the idea of ""you have $50 to spend on toys snd that's it"" has real meaning. Maybe give him a dollar or two in cash when you go to the store and he can buy his candy or whatever with his money.

If you can swing it and purchase now (or sometime this year) I would suspect you'd be ""locked in"" on the off chance they decide to raise prices again early next year. I'm planning a trip in January and  planning on getting our tickets in the next couple weeks, partly to spread the cost of the vacation out over the rest of the year and partly because tickets direct from Disney are good all through next year.  If you're looking at authorized resellers like aResTravel.com or GetAwayToday.com, their ticket prices are lower but their tickets are only good through the end of 2015.

Disneyland,3bsjkq,EatingPizzaAllDay,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"Tiered pricing doesn't seem like a terrible idea. Especially since they could reasonably keep the off-peak pricing the same as it is today. So if you are flexible with when you come to the parks, you won't see much of an increase if any at all.   But they could also use it to get more money out of everyone... We'll see! Here's hoping the AP price increases slow down a bit though. The past 5 years have not been good the the APs."

Disneyland,3bs5hr,CurlyFern,2,Sun Jul 5 21:58:52 2015 UTC,There's a tremendous amount of non-monetary compensation. And not just free theme park admission for friends and family. But the positive feeling of being a Cast Member is a big draw.  It does make it though to craft a career out of working for Disney Parks and promote a transience that doesn't exist in a lot of other industries.

Typically don't see those signs displayed at Pumba and M&F parking structure, but the fine print does refer to it specifically as ""Theme Park Parking.""  That said, it'd take a good amount of effort to enforce something like this on the scale it takes place and with the surge of traffic during peak hours.    Uber is an option, and ART does connect with several locations around the anaheim area.  The ARCTIC transportation hub is also a good jumping off point for a short bus ride to the convention center.

High winds make the landing REALLY rough, and the rockets can also ""wag"" while in motion during high winds, adding unsafe stresses to the tower and cables.  Swings doesn't go down for wind nearly as easily as Zeph. I'm not sure what their wind threshold is, but I know they have one."

It wasn't a question of motion sickness; it was a question of feeling like I was going to die. I'm trying to pinpoint the reason why, and I think this is it: when I'm on a drop on a roller coaster, I can see when the drop is going to end, and it's the same every single time I go on it. Even though I can't see when the drop is going to end on Tower of Terror, I still feel safe on it because it's a huge, sturdy structure. The swinging gondolas on Mickey's Hell Wheel are neither consistent nor (visibly) sturdy.  I'm sure they're perfectly safe, but they don't make me feel that way when my brain is tricked into thinking I'm about to swing into the blue abyss below."

I can't really pin point what it is about it I didn't like.  But I did NOT like it.  Maybe it's because you don't know what to expect, how much swinging occurs depends on many things you can't quite work out while you're on it.   I went on with my family expecting nothing. The first time that cage took off swinging me and my two cousins all lost it.  My mom, who won't even go on Screamin, thought it was the best thing ever.  The fact that there's nothing to grab on to, and the mesh is too small to even snake your fingers through didn't help!   It's a crap shoot, I'm not sure you can judge how much you'll like it until you try it.  Maybe try an non swinging cage first?  I tried that after and still hated it, but there was much less screaming and fear for my life."

Disneyland,3bo2ko,valiamo,3,Wed Jul 1 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"I love them! Sadly, no one else I know would set foot onto one of the gondolas if their lives depended on it.   Depending on how many people/how much weight is in your car, when it reaches the ""end"" of the track it can seem like you might just go flying out through the park. This is something I love, and others hate the most.  Now I want to go on it when I go to the parks. Solo riding it is!"
Disneyland,3bo2ko,YoeSafBridge,3,Tue Jun 30 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think the swinging gondolas are THAT bad. I myself am very sensitive to motion sickness, sometimes being in a car can make me dizzy but I didn't have a problem once I got off. The ride itself is really, really slow. The little carriage thing you're in is completely caged in.  If anything, the second half- the part where you come back down- is worse as compared to going up to the top."

My partner says he doesn't get motion sick and is up for anything, but his theme park experience is limited. Myself, I think there's only one ride that bothered me, and that was a coaster at King's Island called Firehawk. It was one of those flying roller coasters, and I was on the far end that got completely thrown to the other side of the track on any inversion... had to be the most intense ride I've ever been on.   So yeah, I guess we can stand there watching it for a bit, then decide that we're totally going to do it. :D"

You get the same nice views of the park, but you get equally nice views in a non-swinging one.  In terms of motion sickness, I have no clue because I do not get motion sickness except on really choppy waters in boats."
Disneyland,3bo2ko,Darthcholo,3,Wed Jul 1 03:14:52 2015 UTC,We love the swinging gondolas.  Usually it's only three of us so the swinging isn't to bad.   If we just ate we'll ride the stationary ones.

It was even fine half way up. But as soon as we crested the top of the wheel while people were loading below I was screaming inside for it to be over...and worse still I knew we had to go around again, at speed, at least one more time. It's nothing to do with motion sickness and everything to do with feeling like I'm going to fall out, even though I knew I wouldn't with the big ol' cage in the way!  Rollercoasters are easy compared to that thing. I've never been so terrified! And yet it's still sort of fun.  Totally not sure if I'd do it again however!"

Disneyland,3bpjiy,missheatherrose,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:49:49 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, she would have to pay the full upgrade difference and continue with whatever current monthly payments you are making for her.

I only did it once a few years ago when i had a Deluxe, and i ended up upgrading to Premium that weekend anyway.   Esp. if she's only going the one day, that would be the way to go, as long as it's still an option."

Disneyland,3bnk3m,izookie,6,Wed Jul 1 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a projected smell. Like on main street when you walk past the bakery and smell bread? Basically there's little vents all over the place and they've figured out exactly how PoC should smell to complete the atmosphere, and they waft it into the Que and ride. There's part of it that mixes with the chlorine, but the base smell itself is designed. I read this all a really long time ago and thought it was really cool. I'll try and find a source for you, but no promises."

Disneyland,3bnk3m,Techsupportvictim,2,Thu Jul 2 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"I'd never heard that POTS had smellitzers. Given that iasw and Splash both smell the same, its probably just the smell of thousands of gallons of water in a closed system."

Disneyland,3bnk3m,stormeegedon,2,Tue Jun 30 21:47:04 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of the chemicals that keep it clean, dye the water (although, the rides have much cleaner water, I can only imagine some of that smell comes from the dye in the river), and the elements it absorbs from the ride itself. It's hard to actually say what specifically gives it that unique smell, but it's a load of different things all together."

I'm sure it takes some time to remaster them. They were becoming very dull and I'm sure it took some hard work and skill to get them looking bright and new again.  I'm not really sure what more they could have done to this beloved, classic attraction to make it any better. There was a reason it had the longest line in Fantasyland, even when it was showing age.   Personally, I am glad they preserved almost all of the ride and didn't add a whole bunch of digital/projection-mapping effects. That stuff has a place, but Peter Pan is not that place. To me, this ride is perfect Disneyland. I hope that people get to see it like this for years to come."

You have smooth natural looking Darling Children in the opening, and then later on in you have the same children look off and a bit too bright.

I've called WDW when getting stuff over there which was super easy, so if you have time before your trip that could be a good option.   I also saw another ticket stand to the left of the Disneyland entrance by the lockers. Never used it but assuming you can just get tickets, the line would probably be shorter. Can anyone comment on that?"
Disneyland,3bmyfp,Peralton,3,Tue Jun 30 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think that's the group sales window. I'm not sure they do individual tickets if you have fewer than 15 people. I haven't tried it, but it's worth asking if they are not busy."
Disneyland,3bmyfp,stevensokulski,3,Tue Jun 30 16:24:04 2015 UTC,Is that the one next to Lost & Found?  I'm guessing they'd be happy to help if they aren't busy. But they also might ask you to use the regular ticket booths to keep that window open for groups.  I tend to find the ticket booths on the Toy Story side to be quieter than the ones on the Mickey & Friends side. Might be worth a walk across the Esplanade.
Disneyland,3bmyfp,bubblesugarsocks,3,Tue Jun 30 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"If you want to buy your tickets in advance and the website continues to be a jerk, you can buy them from your local Disney store, they're the same price as the website.

Disneyland,3bmyfp,natemc,3,Tue Jun 30 18:58:51 2015 UTC,They all stopped carrying anything more than 3 day passes.

Disneyland,3bmqo6,twoleggedpiglet,14,Tue Jun 30 13:52:28 2015 UTC,Not a dumb question! Typically they only reach capacity around Thanksgiving and between Christmas and New Years (Plus the 24 hour events.) You should be good any other time. Personally I'd buy online because you can avoid the ticket booth line and go straight to the gate but you could go either way!
Disneyland,3bmqo6,PicklePants84,5,Tue Jun 30 15:46:37 2015 UTC,I would buy online so that you avoid the booth - you'd be surprised how long those lines get in the morning.

Also, like another person said, you get to go straight to the turnstiles instead of waiting in line at the ticket booths. Worth it."

Disneyland,3bn8ey,MaLaCoiD,3,Tue Jun 30 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"You use your Halloween party ticket at special booths to get a wristband. Last year they had one at the front of the park and one near fantasyland. You can get your wristband earlier in the day so beat the lines. After the party starts you need to have that wristband to do anything (trick or treat, rides, shows) and I believe they direct people without them out of the park. If you have the wristband the park seems to run like normal with just a few added events happening."
Disneyland,3bn8ey,Modnar24,2,Tue Jun 30 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say like normal. There are plenty of awesome unique character experiences that they don't have outside of the party.

Disneyland,3bn8ey,paradisevendors,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:20:49 2015 UTC,Im not saying it's a normal day at the park. If you've got the wristband you could treat it like a normal day though. We didn't know what to expect the first time and were wondering if they had to clear the park between normal day and Halloween party. You don't have to worry about losing time in the park if you're just trying to spend a day at Disneyland.   The cool part is that the extra characters and decorations were up all day and you didn't need the extra ticket to experience those things.

Disneyland,3bjv41,horkenstein,109,Mon Jun 29 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"Not as a cast member, but as someone who has been to the parks multiple times a year every year for over two decades:  The guests have gotten worse, and it's progressively harder to accommodate or make special moments for people when EVERYONE needs to be accommodated or wants to have that Disney Magic Moment. The reality is, the more people that are rude or demanding, the less cast members CAN or WANT to do for guests.  It's entirely anecdotal, but from my experience guests get more brazen, rude, and pushy every time I go. I realize it's always been that way to some extent, but in the last few years it really feels like there's been a sea change in the way guests behave in the parks."

I am here at the DCA and was in front of soaring when some guy was getting mad at the CM because the single rider wait was for over an hour.. And the CM was trying to remain calm and explain to him how it isn't really necessary for them to use/have single riders for soaring and the guy just walks away and just yells ""fuck you"" to the CM.. And the CM just looks at him and tells him ""sir don't make me call security on you"" and just looked that he deals with it all the time."
Disneyland,3bjv41,omgjess,21,Mon Jun 29 22:31:56 2015 UTC,"Yep. Some guests seem to have some sense of entitlement. Makes me feel bad for the cast members that have to deal with such people. The cast members I've come across have been pleasant and wonderful, for the most part if you treat them with respect they will treat you with respect (Not saying OP is rude, but just in general as a rule of thumb. Treat others as you want to be treated.). I've seen some crazies especially during the ""rush hour"" after PTN and Forever. People that refuse to move in a certain way and show attitide to the guest control CMs. But of course there are always wonderful CMs that I come across and they go the extra mile to make the guests feel special and more accommodated. We lost a wallet a few weeks back and the CMs where we lost the wallet, guest relations, and the lost and found were very helpful. Other CMs at the ticket booths were very friendly and got fastpasses and pins when we lost our annual passes on a different occasion. Of course your mileage may vary.  It was odd, I was in line at Plaza Inn and when I said please and thank you the CM seemed genuinely surprised. Got me thinking about what the other guest interactions must be like.  The only time I saw CMs being snappy and irritated was during Grad Nite, security CMs were yelling at groups of grads, and CMs didn't seem like they were in their usual happy mood. Which is part of the reason I avoid going to the parks on Grad Nite."
Disneyland,3bjv41,DDotJ,7,Mon Jun 29 23:38:30 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who's worked his fair share of Grad Nites at a different theme park, I'll give them a pass on this one. Teenagers at grad nite can be some of the most awfully obnoxious, rude, self-entitled people you will come across in your life. They're loud and break every rule they can, they go out of their way to purposely annoy other people, especially the ride ops, and a lot of them are intoxicated beyond being coherent.

It consisted of all their stuff spread out to create a rectangle and the two women sprawled out for over 2 hours. When a family (2 parents + 1 baby) asked to stand within their rectangle, they got into a shouting fight. They called over a CM to resolve the issue, the CM basically said we're going to put up a rope and everyone is going to stand up and move closer to the parade route so there's no point in reserving so much space, and then the CM walked away while the two families continued to yell at each other. When the parade finally started, the two women plus their family members (about 7 people total) stood up and ended up only taking up about 4x4 ft of space -__-"
Disneyland,3bjv41,stepstool,8,Mon Jun 29 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"I would wager that this is because there has been a sea change in the way people behave outside the parks as well -- people in general have become ruder, louder, more careless and entitled-acting and grosser in many other ways. They also litter more. I'm not saying this in a kids-get-off-my-lawn sense. I'm saying it in an end-of-civilization sense, and sadly Disneyland is a microcosm. Serious here."

For 120 dollars a day per person the ""average"" American has to save for it, or charge it. It seems that Disneyland and World has started to cater to the upper middle class and higher class families.   edit: This is just my opinion. High tickets prices can cause entitlement."

Disneyland,3bjv41,MrPoppagergio,51,Wed Jul 1 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"I love my job. There is something so amazing about being here and making magic for so many people.   But fuck. There are a lot of Cast Members who are here just for a job, they think it's cool but they don't have the ""Disney spirit"" so to say. When I first started in foods, everyone was handing out free cookies to the kind guests but by the end of my nine months there, I was literally the only one.   Jungle Cruise is quite different. Each and everyone of us puts a smile on your face with our stupid jokes (cringes count too!)  I absolutely love this aspect of my job.  I absolutely hate my parade shifts though. Asking someone to stand somewhere else or to stay a certain direction and these guests are extremely angry. I get that you paid a lot of money to be here, but we can't make an exception because everyone else paid the same amount too. These guests feel very entitled to be treated like royalty because that's how Disney has always been known for, but the only way you're going to get that magic is if you treat all the cast members amazingly. Even the littlest thank you makes our night."
Disneyland,3bjv41,mildly_interesting,20,Mon Jun 29 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"These guests feel very entitled to be treated like royalty   Yeah, as someone who has had a guest literally spit in my face because of a ride closure and another run me to the ground with their stroller because crowd control dictated they go one way and not the other (thank god I had another CM so close to me that he was able to haul me up and prevent me from getting trampled), there are a lot of entitled guests. It can get draining sometimes. But as an ex-CM and frequent guest now, I definitely can count the bad CMs on my fingers, where as I would have to go through my own hair strands to count the good ones. I know a bad CM here and there can really put a damper on your visit, but I can almost guarantee you will encounter more happy and friendly ones than not."

Disneyland,3bjv41,Vidogo,20,Tue Jun 30 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"Huh.  I was at Disneyland/DCA for a week over Christmas, and honestly almost every single cast member interaction was wonderful.  The people checking our passes at the front gate were full of smiles.  The guy operating the monorail seemed to be the happiest guy alive.  We were searching for a hat/scarf that was sold out at a few of the shops.  We finally located one, but it was the display model.  The cast member called a supervisor and GAVE it to us.  The guy working Nemo was just the nicest.  The Jungle Cruise skipper made us laugh and laughed back.  Yep, it was crowded.  Yep, they cancelled the fireworks a few times.  Yep, we got caught in parade traffic and probably got testy.  Yes, I was SAD that the dole whip operator closed down 15 minutes before the park closed and I missed out.  Yep, our waitress at the River Belle was as bad as the food.  But honestly, I'll take those small irritations and inconveniences, which literally made up 10% of our experience over the 90% of perfection that is the parks.    PS - I agree with the previous poster - guests made up the bulk of the bad experience there, and no matter how magical a cast member is, I'm guessing they all have their moments where it gets to them.  These folks give up nights, weekends, holiday, even Christmas to come to the parks to give us a great experience.  The least we can do is act like guests and not be rude little punks."
Disneyland,3bjv41,chicklette,2,Tue Jun 30 00:02:56 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you brought up the food, because unlike CMs who are usually wonderful, I have a real problem with how bad the food is in many places, especially given the prices. I now basically head to Boudin for lunch, everything else has just been pretty bad. In fact, I'd say I've probably eaten better on a plane."

When I was there for the 60th in May I saw a cast member be straight up, flat out, rude to a guest who was giving him shit and not following instructions that a certain walkway was closed and to please go around - and I LOVED IT.   I loved that he stood up for himself and wouldn't let that entitled asshole push him around. Since I was waiting for the parade I was just standing there against a railing and watched the whole encounter. It was glorious. So much sweet justice.  And while I know you guys can get in a lot of trouble for even half of what the CM I witnessed did, I still loved that he had had ENOUGH of people fucking with him that day and wouldn't take it anymore."

But I t makes me feel bad because I've literally never had a 'magic moment' at Disneyland as you and others describe them.   Disney is magical to me because of the attractions, the cast, the grounds, the food, and time spent with family. But no CM has ever gone beyond their official duties at that moment or given away freebies.   I feel left out - hahaha"

CMs are still in my experience pretty amazing."
Disneyland,3bjv41,disneywizard,3,Tue Jun 30 10:26:40 2015 UTC,I got a magical moment by CMs when I went during off season near the end of August/beginning of September when I wore my Celebration button for both graduating high school and a successful brain surgery.   The CM's were wonderful when they heard my story and were especially happy and kind to me and my mom during our stay and made up for the mess and anger from the D23 Expo (that was wonderful but horrible management and craziness that racked up my stress levels to the extreme).   You guys have a tough job and it's horrible how much crap you have to put up with from entitled guests.
Disneyland,3bjv41,therockchild,9,Tue Jun 30 13:58:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly just want to say how much I love you cms. I am returning to the park in two weeks and can't get to Disneyland more than a few times a year, so its extra special just for me to be there. I have only encountered one checked out cm and I didn't let it ruin my day as 98% of the cms I have met are so great!   Everytime I visit the park I always behave in a courteous way. I let families cut in front of me, I ask cms how they are, how they day is going, I say the CMs name, I say please, I thank them for doing what they do everyday and helping to make my trip awesome just by doing their job. Even entering Disneyland I say hello and the cms name as they scan my pass and ask them how they are.  It may seem like nothing but I once thanked a CM who took our photo at cars land and just talked to him for a few minutes. He said I made his day, his week and it meant so much to him what I said. Just by being polite!  I feel like its important to thank them, smile, thank them again and treat others how you would want to be treated. I think a lot of guests probably forget their manners, and forget how to treat others. Don't worry, those of us that love you CM's are here, we see you and we appreciate you so much. I hope I run into you on my next trip so I can thank you all in person. :)"
Disneyland,3bjv41,lemon_tea,14,Tue Jun 30 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"I think there is an aspect here that nobody has touched on.  I started going in '95 when I got my first annual pass.  The park has become MUCH more crowded much more frequently than it used to, and the closing off of sections of the park and herding of people into tiny areas to facilitate fireworks and shows doesn't help.  I understand safety and all but holy crap its gotten ridiculous.  You cant forcibly herd that many people that often without inciting some tempers and making people angry. I'm not saying they're right, but it is the way of things.  Larger crowds = more friction."
Disneyland,3bjv41,DarumaRed,5,Tue Jun 30 07:49:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised to see this comment. As a customer of Costco, Apple and other companies that pride themselves on overly generous customer support, Disney cast members still beat them all.  I was present at Disneyland for the Diamond celebration, and the poor, beleaguered CM's were dealing with Tiananmen Square levels of flesh-per-square yard. But there were smiles all around. Really, Cast Members went out of their way to extend the magic of the rides to folks who were still waiting for them.   And the customer service experience extended BEYOND the park. We were denied re-entry to the main park due to the incredible crowds that showed up for the Anniversary. When we called and explained what happened (in a civil tone) we were refunded our ticket prices within a few days of opening the customer complaint.  I understand the OP made their post out of concern, but I think the concern is a product of an overly small sample size. On my end of the small sample size spectrum, Disneyland's customer service is some of the best I have experienced to date."
Disneyland,3bjv41,ThePaulAntonio,8,Tue Jun 30 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly people just demand more and more. Everything is magnified by a Yelp review, Facebook post, tweet or reddit post. I wish there was a Yelp for customers, then that way you could see ""oh, this person gave a complicated order 3 minutes AFTER close and refused to leave because I'm hungry and I NEED my food."" People are just more about themselves. Disneyland is made to accommodate and yet people take exception to things like smoking because ""they"" don't like it. It is all about their magical trip, so they will cut lines, be rude to other guests, bump people out of the way, and yell instead of being calm. Let us not blame the CMs (although there are definitely a couple shitty CMs) because most of them are just doing their job, but as someone who works a customer service job, people are just entitled shits. Plain and simple :)   (Sorry for those who are offended)"
Disneyland,3bjv41,jbow808,7,Tue Jun 30 05:46:06 2015 UTC,"As my wife said on our last visit, the most miserable people visit Disneyland to make themselves happy.

Disneyland,3bjv41,alarmsoundslikewhoop,3,Tue Jun 30 05:47:26 2015 UTC,I can't imagine it. I get so exhausted with the other guests when I'm just in the park for a single day. I don't know how any CM can get through even a week of dealing with those folks.
Disneyland,3bjv41,Assorted_Donuts,6,Tue Jun 30 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, from a CM perspective here, its really hard sometimes to bring the magic. I try each and every day to bring as much magic and enthusiasm to work everyday, but Disney breaks people. I see so much life drained out of CMs from working at Disney, and Im not excluded from that sometimes. Guests at Disney (in my opinion) are worse than I got in retail and fast food, both in quantity and severity of incidents. Im screamed at and insulted daily over things outside my control, and Ive been physically assaulted and spit on more than a few times. A good majority of people will not listen (even to the most common sense safety instructions) simply because they are going to do what they want to due regardless of what the rules are, and will fight you on even the smallest of requests (i.e. can you buckle your seatbelt for me, sir?). Part of it is that people are out in the sun all day, for extended hours, in large crowds, and often with unruly children. That would put stress on even the most patient of people. So when they see that the one ride they wanted to go on is down, or that they can't find a spot for the parade they want to see, they get hostile. Now I know every guest isn't like this, and I can count a good many guests that help keep me going in this job, but I can really see how the ""quality"" of service would go down due to the guests that aren't the good ones."
Disneyland,3bjv41,Majorezytarget,22,Tue Jun 30 15:15:14 2015 UTC,"The same thing that's happened to Customer Service everywhere. I can't remember the last time the Bank, insurance company, hospital, theme parks, airlines, comcast, etc actually treated me like they cared for my business."

I'm IT Support (In the U.S. Army) and I can tell you it's very customer centric. And no other job I've worked before has burned me out as much as this one does.

Disneyland,3bjv41,tanuki_chan,12,Tue Jun 30 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"As an ex cm and frequent visitor to California and Florida parks, I think there's a bit of truth in the perception that cms are losing some of the Disney spirit, but also that guests are increasingly losing their Disney spirit too. When you get yelled at, pushed, ignored, and almost run over by ecvs/strollers/feet on a very regular basis it can be hard to pick yourself up and keep a smile on your face, especially if you're dealing with the 100th person of the day to do that. But you also note a big difference between those cms who are there because it's a job and those who are there because they want to make magic. The latter will keep trying despite the difficulties, the former will grow bitter. Often it's the long timers who move from being in the latter category to the former. I think at California, since so many are long timers, there's a lot more of that tiredness and bitterness and ppl who are no longer there for the joy. I certainly felt less warmth from cms at California than I felt at Florida when visiting both. But I've also still felt the magic at each"
Disneyland,3bjv41,izookie,3,Tue Jun 30 20:25:54 2015 UTC,"Strange. I have been to the parks frequently this year and have experienced great customer service. I think CMs are quick to know if you look like you're in a hurry, if you look lost, or if you can stop and chat for a bit. In any of those situations, I have seen them accommodate guests. I agree that guests have become worse. APs and Social Clubs can be inconsiderate. Tourists can be inconsiderate. Teens can be inconsiderate. I have noticed that many guests simply ignore CM instructions so I can see how the job can be difficult. Still, I have been pretty impressed by the service lately."
Disneyland,3bjv41,ejrizo,3,Wed Jul 1 22:46:08 2015 UTC,its still there.  I think the more Disneyland raises its prices the more people expect which can cause people getting upset with staff.  They feel more entitled which causes problems

Disneyland,3bjv41,AXPendergast,3,Tue Jun 30 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"I just returned from an all-day trip and I can say first-hand that the customer service level was quite high.  The only people who were having ""none of that"" were the guests who felt (as mentioned in the threads) that THEIR special snowflake had DAMN well better get to see a princess or there would the HELL to pay...and other conversations of that ilk.    If you go to the parks with a sense of entitlement, then you're sure to have a bad time.  If you go because of the magic, then you learn to go with the flow and make the best of any situation.  Cases in point:   1) We'd been trying to get photos with Goofy all day.  We'd either just miss him as he walked off stage, or get to the line just as it was being cut off.  That happened four times, and each time we had the same CMs as Goofy's shepherds.  On the fifth time, we finally made the cut.  The CMs seemed genuinely surprised of our good-natured banter and easy-going nature.  They shared a few stories of parents completely ignoring their instructions and trying to follow Goofy as he headed for his break.  One guest kept hitting with a stroller and had to be pulled off by Security.  Needless to say, Goofy and his crew paid us some extra attention.   2) We headed for dinner at the newly-reopened Smoke Jumpers Grill in DCA.  I ordered the grilled chicken and, as I took it to the condiment station, noticed that the chicken was cold and the fries were old and chewy.  I returned to the queue and politely asked for a replacement...while the CM cringed, expecting the worst.  She brought another but it too was cold (I'm not trying to be a ass here...the food was actually cold to the touch and slightly pink inside).  I asked the CM's supervisor for a different meal.  She refilled my drink and promised to bring it to me at my table.  After a few minutes, my now hot meal arrived...along with a complete refund for my dinner.  Which I had not asked for at all.  When I protested, the CM supervisor was actually surprised.  I explained that 1) things happen; 2) I didn't ask for a free meal, only a hot one; 3) I got my food and was happy.  She was silent for a few, but then insisted that I accept the money for my trouble.  I went ahead and took it, but felt a little weird doing so.    As far as I'm concerned, the customer service at D'land has been nothing but stellar every time I've gone."
Disneyland,3bjv41,staplerofpaper,2,Tue Jun 30 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"I always try to give employees of any place, not just Disneyland, a fair deal.  If they are doing their job and not being outright rude or insulting to me, great.   I don't expect anything more.   A smile, generosity, anything else is a bonus and I appreciate it, but I realize that the are just people like myself and maybe they like their job or they hate their job, maybe they are having a good day or a bad day.  That being said, I've never had a bad experience (according to my standards) with a CM.  I'm sure legitimate things happen sometimes where even I would be upset.  Maybe there is an expectation by people who have traveled and spent a ton of money to visit the park to have a magical time.  I really do think the majority of them get just that.  I encounter more happy (on the outside at least) and kind employees at Disneyland at a higher percentage than anywhere else I know.  My advice to everyone would be to appreciate the CMs who bring a smile to your face, remember their name and location, and go have a compliment card filled out in City Hall before you leave.   I've done this multiple times, yeah sometimes I have to wait in line while multiple guests in front of me complain about things major and minor, but I think it's worth the time and effort.  And usually the CM helping me acts surprised I want to leave a compliment for someone, which is a little sad, but hopefully it makes someone's day who helped make mine a little better."

While I understand most people save money for years to come to the parks, it doesn't mean you can treat people the way they do. Plus there are just more and more and more guest visiting every year. More people+ bad attitudes+ bad pay= a burnt out Cast Member. Doesn't matter how positive and awesome you were before you started. I was punched in the face by a mother on New Year's Eve for asking her to please step out of the queue for an attraction in my area where she was waiting to watch the fire works. As I was explaining it to her she cussed me out and punched me and ran away through the crowd with her family. Some people don't understand how bad it can be. I've ever been spit on! Lol seriously. I tried my best and still came to work positive but that wasn't the case for my coworkers. And I couldn't blame them. It was just kinda shitty sometimes."
Disneyland,3bjv41,GrabMyDrumstick,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:36 2015 UTC,This sort of discussion would be more productive if OP could provide specific examples of what they're talking about.
Disneyland,3bjv41,95688it,-13,Tue Jun 30 21:23:01 2015 UTC,"cast members are paid minimum wage, and nobody is full-time.   all they get is bottom of the barrel employees."
Disneyland,3bjv41,stormeegedon,11,Tue Jun 30 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Almost all employees make above minimum wage and there are plenty of full-time employees.  All bottom of the barrel employees are working down the street at Wal-Mart.
Disneyland,3bjv41,MyDisneyExperience,3,Tue Jun 30 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"Above minimum gross, but after taxes, union dues, the costs of getting to the park, they really don't.  Also, consider how part-timers have an hour cap in most areas"
Disneyland,3bjv41,stormeegedon,3,Mon Jun 29 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"All jobs are subject to tax, a lot of jobs pay union fees (not all positions in Disney are unionized to boot), and pretty much all jobs you have a commute. And I've yet to find a part time job that doesn't have a cap on hours. I don't see how any of that should be a contributing factor here. My point still stands: Disney pays better than most businesses of equal position and has relatively high standards in their hiring process. They don't get bottom of the barrel employees. Doesn't mean they don't get jerks slipping in though."
Disneyland,3bjv41,justkate2,3,Tue Jun 30 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I made 9.12 when I hired into attractions. Working 20-30 hours a week that should mean a few hundred bucks a week, but when it comes to buying all the required items (shoes, Show-approved sunglasses and whatnot) plus gas getting there and taxes... Then Union dues... I was bringing home maybe $125 a week for all those hours completely on my feet, unable to bring water on stage, learning a whole new language, etc. Disney does NOT pay their CMs enough. I worked Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, New Years Eve and New Years Day, and during those peak periods I had a few shifts extended to almost 12 hours. Did I enjoy the overtime pay? Yes. But the overcrowding of the parks meant that I was sardined in with thousands of stressed guests. That's what a lot of guests don't really get - when they're stressed, we are also stressed. The same things they're not happy with - haphazard guest control, long lines, etc - are the same thing we're stressed about, and often times we have as little control over these things as they do.  I've been to the parks every week or two for the last ten years, pretty much - and the 60th stuff has inflated guest counts. Plus it's peak season. Plus new parade and fireworks. Oh, plus they're still making shit for paychecks. No wonder some of them aren't feeling the Disney Magic."
Disneyland,3bjv41,menstrualpowers,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:51:58 2015 UTC,"been working there almost two years and i make about 50¢ higher than min wage. most lands make it very hard to become full time bc no matter how long youve been working there theres just so many more whos been there longer thus get seniority and an actual chance at full time.....as ""magical"" as disney is people need to remember its there to make a very large profit and they get away with underpaying their employees because they give you disney benefits but being able to play at disneyland doesnt exactly pay the bills..  Ps us cast members are just like everybody else that wallmart comment comes off as pretty condescending and rude"
Disneyland,3bjv41,stormeegedon,-1,Tue Jun 30 05:38:19 2015 UTC,"You've literally described almost every industry out there. As a former cast member who realized very quickly that working in attractions at Disneyland was a job, not a career, I am fully aware with how difficult it is to get FT (HM had 1, count them, 1 FT CM when I worked there), and how underpaid it is for someone who isn't working their way through college or using is as a retirement fun job. But if you have chosen to stay at Disney to try and make it a career, there are worse places you can go, and its also worth noting that the level of skill required to do a lot of these jobs is quite low and the pay is actually higher than equal jobs in the area. . If you don't like the way they treat and pay their employees, don't work there. It's quite simple. If you want to make a career out of working there, you need to start applying for actual career worthy jobs in the business. It's very difficult to make a career out of pushing a ""ride go"" button when ther are thousands of kids in the area who will do it for a much lower price.   And as someone who worked a low level job at a Wal-Mart, my statement still stands. I worked with much better employees at Disneyland who actually cared to make people enjoy their day where as the people at Wal-Mart would often times do the opposite. It's not condescending, it's simple observation that one values customer service in any regard of the definition."

I'd say there's less courtesy in general over all ages groups, but with how expensive the parks are I think there's a general sense with a lot of people that they HAVE to do absolutely everything to ""get their money's worth"", and at that point their view is completely narrowed to their own needs and priorities to the exclusion of other people. : /"

Disneyland,3bltwr,izookie,-4,Wed Jul 1 16:56:00 2015 UTC,It takes 20 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark/light. Dark Rides should have their light levels adjusted to match the outside light so they aren't too hard to see during a sunny day or that too much is showing in the night. This could be done automatically via sensors since most of the lighting is computerized anyway. Bright days kill my Toy Story and Buzz Lightyear scores.
Disneyland,3bltwr,wamoc,10,Wed Jul 1 01:35:55 2015 UTC,Raising the light levels to match the outside would ruin the dark rides. They are dark to hide elements.

Disneyland,3bk4h3,dailythought,2,Tue Jun 30 04:22:21 2015 UTC,"The best time to visit is definitely in an offseason month, such as September-early October or Jan-March. Weekdays are the least crowded, of course. Keep in mind that with less visitors, comes an increased refurbishment schedule. So if there is a ride you have your heart set on, make sure to check the daily schedule on the Disneyland website to view any preplanned ride closures. Also keep in mind that weekdays typically have earlier park closing times and more limited entertainment options, such as Fantasmic and fireworks. For a multi-day visit, the best bet is to arrive on a weekday for minimal crowds, but leave on a weekend in order to see the shows.  If you are visiting for multiple days, I'd highly recommend taking a tour. Walking in Walt's Footsteps is an amazing experience and is, despite it's added cost, a great value and use of your time. It includes a full meal, souvenir, and front of line access to several of the most popular attractions. It also takes you places most guests never see, like Walt Disneys's apartment in the fire station or the Disney Dream Suite.   I'd also highly recommend having a meal at the Blue Bayou. It's a unique experience to have a fantastic meal inside an immersive atmosphere (a bayou inside of Pirates of the Caribbean). Reservations can be made up to 60 days before your visit and a dinner package comes with a Fantasmic fastpass.  Have fun and appreciate the small details that Walt and his Imagineers put into the park. It is what sets Disney apart from any other park. It is literally a giant piece of art you get to walk through. Allow yourself to see it with the eyes of a child and relish every moment!"

Disneyland,3bgr3w,wongs7,2,Mon Jun 29 02:11:42 2015 UTC,My wife and I watched this the other week and she really loved the scale models. What she couldn't understand was what was there for the previous 10 years.  Guess I'll have to break open some old tomes of disneyland lore
Disneyland,3bgr3w,Camkasal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those scale models were so amazing.    I've been listening a lot to Jim Hill's podcast about the history of Disneyland because this year they are doing 4-5 years of the park history per month.  It's been really interesting to hear about the early years."
Disneyland,3bgr3w,wongs7,2,Mon Jun 29 06:28:14 2015 UTC,Here's hoping we get a return of the dancing candles!
Disneyland,3bk5jd,ramadamaingateATP,2,Mon Jun 29 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never looked at it and thought, you know, the rich and connected Club 33 members don't have a nice enough place.  They should totally get more square footage of Disneyland.  It just adds to the mystery to have even more places we can never go."

Some kind of man-ape creature with white fur.  Could possibly be a yeti.  They think it may be on Tom Sawyer Island, or on one of the mountains.  Let me know if you guys see/hear anything."

Disneyland,3bh31p,Mercury756,6,Mon Jun 29 06:02:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's $48 per person (less if you're an Annual Passholder). It starts at 9A both Saturday and Sunday. Call ahead to reserve your spot. They limit it to 12 people per tour.  The price may appear steep, but it's well worth it. At the very least, you're essentially getting simultaneous fastpasses for Jungle Cruise, Storybook Land Canal Boats, and Haunted Mansion :)"
Disneyland,3bh31p,Mercury756,3,Mon Jun 29 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Thats not steep for a couple hours at all, just not bringing any kids with me."
Disneyland,3bh31p,Not_Steve,3,Mon Jun 29 06:13:54 2015 UTC,Do they go into all of the edible plants in Tomorrowland? I've always been fascinated by that aspect of the parts and have wanted to learn more.
Disneyland,3bh31p,SnarkMasterRay,3,Mon Jun 29 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Briefly at the very end. The tour covers the entire park, so you get more of an overview instead of a lot of detail. Much more of a narrative than a bontany lecture."
Disneyland,3bh31p,ranoutofbacon,3,Mon Jun 29 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"I took the tour a couple of years ago, but don't think a lot has changed....  There wasn't a lot about specific plants, it was more about how they used vegetation in general and some of the more interesting historical places and pieces. Specific trees were touched on (one outside Pirates and another outside the Golden Horsehoe Review) and I remember spending the vast majority of the time in Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Frontierland. I don't remember any time in Tomorrowland, so if we did, it must have been very brief as /u/ret-conned said."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,SakuraKasugano,21,Mon Jun 29 02:55:56 2015 UTC,"Can't you just leave them in your car? I don't think you would need them in the park anyway. As for the tags, you could ask the CMs to remove them for you."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,heyawildchild,16,Mon Jun 29 03:17:33 2015 UTC,"Remember: it's a bag check, not a pocket check."

Disneyland,3bgvw0,arobotamongus,5,Mon Jun 29 07:56:30 2015 UTC,"BIL got in shit for trying to carry his pocket knife thing in. He didn't intend to take it. He just carries it around out of habit. Anywho, he got past the main gate but a CM looked into his pocket and pointed it out. BIL was okay with walking it back to his car. Didn't talk back or anything but he had security called on him. Got followed all the way back to his car."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,TokidokiHobi,9,Mon Jun 29 06:09:07 2015 UTC,If they're small just put them in your pocket.
Disneyland,3bgvw0,fruitjerky,4,Mon Jun 29 04:16:12 2015 UTC,"No problem with the flashlight. I also carry a Fenix LD20. I do suggest placing it fully in your pocket or bag, because the CMs at bag check look specifically for the pocket clip (for knives). Placing it all the way in your pocket just prevents the hassle of turning it on to show it's a flashlight.   As for the bladeless Swiss Army knife, thats a toss up. I carry a mini leatherman (with a blade) on my key chain. Sometimes they see it, and ask me to take it back to the car, someTimes they dint. Now, I just move it to my pocket before getting to the bag check."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,ret-conned,5,Mon Jun 29 03:55:00 2015 UTC,"The flashlight won't be an issue.  I keep one in my EDC bag and I've never had anyone give it a second look.  The multi-tool could be problematic, but like others have said, just stick it in your pocket or bury it under some other stuff.  The bag checkers never devote more than a few seconds to each guest and I've rarely had them ask me to open up a secondary pocket on my bag.   To be honest, they're probably only looking for firearms, large knives, and alcohol."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,Diablo_Robotico,9,Mon Jun 29 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"Why do you need a flashlight at Disneyland? And a pocket knife... Again, at Disneyland?"
Disneyland,3bgvw0,TheLetter10,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:00:53 2015 UTC,I clarified in my post that it does not have a knife...  Flashlight is for emergencies. I've used it plenty of times during unexpected blackouts and walking at night. I don't feel comfortable using my phone's light because it drains the power.
Disneyland,3bgvw0,TheLetter10,10,Mon Jun 29 04:08:22 2015 UTC,Power won't go out at Disneyland. You're best to leave it in your car.
Disneyland,3bgvw0,badgaming91,2,Mon Jun 29 04:27:08 2015 UTC,"True the power won't go out at Disneyland but does not mean you will always have light on the ground everywhere, some of the places get pretty dark like Frontierland. Plus you never know if he wants to pin trade with a CM at night. The board for Peterpan is very hard to see without a flashlight at night."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,stevensokulski,4,Mon Jun 29 05:49:50 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. I would mostly frequent the park at night and stay until closing. I suppose having a flashlight on you at all times is strange to those who don't carry one at all. It's just come in handy so many times for me personally. Be prepared and all that. :)
Disneyland,3bgvw0,DreamArcher,0,Mon Jun 29 06:41:20 2015 UTC,"They didn't shut the show off? That's pretty common. The SFX and animation will all stop. Odd that there were no work lights, though."

Disneyland,3bgvw0,stormeegedon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"Scissors and nail chippers, even small ones, can be used as weapons. I imagine they would say no. And if you are spotted in the park with it, having smuggled it in by hiding it in a pocket, it might not go so well. Don't risk it.  With the flashlight, again don't try to be cute and hide it."
Disneyland,3bgvw0,stevensokulski,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"I got a roll of tape taken away from me at bag check, I can almost guarantee the bladeless Swiss will be taken as well. Either leave it in the car or put it fully in your pocket."
Disneyland,3bep2k,wsupreddit,4,Sun Jun 28 15:16:51 2015 UTC,Do you know if at 7pm they are closing the ride all together (people in line already would be turned away) or at 7pm is when they won't be letting people in line anymore (the ride would continue after 7pm for the remaining people in line)?
Disneyland,3bep2k,Shellion,4,Mon Jun 29 00:20:39 2015 UTC,They usually let people waiting in line go on after they close the queue.
Disneyland,3bep2k,ThrowawayxxBunny,3,Mon Jun 29 01:28:37 2015 UTC,I want to hear people's experience. How was the wait time? No spoliers!
Disneyland,3bep2k,MaLaCoiD,2,Mon Jun 29 17:00:24 2015 UTC,"Just got back and it was fantastic! The wait time posted at 2 PM was 50 minutes. The ride was shut down for about 10 minutes, and we ended up getting on the ride after a 55 minute wait total.  I honestly don't remember ever riding Peter Pan's Flight, despite having been to Disneyland a bunch of times, so this was a new experience for me. Everything was clear and well-lit, while maintaining a dark atmosphere overall.  My only complaint would be that the ride seemed far too short. Oh and my right knee banged into the side of the car (pirate ship) at the final turn before disembarking.  Can't wait to ride it again!"

Make sure you can see the castle and Matterhorn. I have seen Disneyland Forever by small world, Main St, East Hub, and Rivers of America. My favorite is the East Hub. You can see the projections in the same direction as the fireworks (forward) and you can see Tinker Bell, Nemo, and the volcano. The castle fireworks have a lot of impact up close."
Disneyland,3bf5fe,izookie,3,Sun Jun 28 20:56:46 2015 UTC,What's the east hub?
Disneyland,3bf5fe,herrerasaurus87,3,Sun Jun 28 22:27:35 2015 UTC,I would love to know this as well. On my way to DL right now. Want to check this show out but now 100% sure where to watch it from
Disneyland,3bf5fe,54321TyekiM,3,Sun Jun 28 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"Between the ""partners"" statue and tomorrow land entrance. So that in front of you to the left is the castle and to the right is the matterhorn"

Disneyland,3bf5fe,thesailingboss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:17:21 2015 UTC,You don't get the inflatables of Main St. I know people say they like Main Street the most because you are surrounded by projections. But I found myself not knowing where to look and the the castle and fireworks seemed far away.
Disneyland,3bf5fe,izookie,2,Mon Jun 29 07:29:39 2015 UTC,"Very curious, too. Honestly haven't really ""seen"" it yet, because I refuse to camp out for 2+ hours or whatever, and I can generally only go on weekends and it's just been too crazy for me. Mostly only seen it from the sides or other lands w/out the view of projections"

If you get right at the end of Main Street you can also see the top of the Matterhorn. It's really easy to get a spot on Main Street too, just walk on at the end of Paint the Night"
Disneyland,3bf5fe,thesailingboss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:19:27 2015 UTC,"I've only watched it once, on Father's Day. I got there at around 8:20pm and sat next to the flag pole in the middle of main street in front of the railroad. It's a good spot for short people like me because you can stand on a little cement border that gives you a few extra inches!"

Ghost Galaxy uses the same installation as Rockin' Space Mountain, and Rockin' California Screamin' uses no extra infrastructure at all.  It could happen again.

Disneyland,3bf9q5,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"I have been told by cast members that riding the Lily Bell  is a thing of the past for normal parkgoers. They apparently stopped doing it a few years ago and it is now only available for Club 33 members and invited guests.  However, I have heard and seen recent stories of people being allowed on. So it seems like a toss up. If you are going for multiple days, maybe ask each day and/or ask different cast members. But don't get your hopes up that it will happen and let it ruin your time when it doesn't. Being in Disneyland is special as it is.  If you want something that will be amazing, guaranteed, I highly recommend the Walking with Walt tour of the park. It is a bit pricey (I think around $75) but includes a tour of several off limits places in Disneyland. When I took it last year, we got to go into the Disney Dream Suite, which was absolutely amazing. It also includes a great lunch,  dessert, a special souvenir pin, and front of line access to several high demand rides. Our tour guide was extremely informative and it was such a special experience! I can't recommend it enough!"

The most up-to-date guides still recommend heading to the Main Street station and asking. As of the Diamond celebration, they told us that the normal protocol is still to go to the Main Station (preferably on an off day) and let them know. I'd be curious to know what their explanation is if they have indeed reserved the rear carriage for the upper class.)"
Disneyland,3bd3eg,ScuzzDP7,9,Sun Jun 28 02:05:44 2015 UTC,Weekdays arent so bad. Just be sure you have seperate tickets for the halloween party.  I usually spend a day at DCA...then go over at 3pm. For Halloween party.  Protip: buy a small gift from shop...ask for xlarge bag = mo candy!
Disneyland,3bd3eg,therealmikeyj,2,Sun Jun 28 04:11:18 2015 UTC,I already have a room booked for that week and am curious myself....
Disneyland,3bd3eg,yodaaz,2,Sun Jun 28 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"Last Halloween it really wasn't that busy, I was there Thursday through Sunday (Halloween was a Saturday this year, I think). Halloween day even wasn't that bad. I felt like the party was pretty hectic but my friends wanted to do the trick or treat stuff and apparently that was where the majority of the people were. It was much emptier than, say, during the Christmas season or summer, but busier than normal off season."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,bubblesugarsocks,2,Sun Jun 28 04:09:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having a difficult time determining what off season is anymore.  First week of December was awesome a few years back, last couple times it was busier.  Touringplans has the week predicted at a 3.  We usually go when it is a 1 or a 2, getting increasingly difficult to find."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,bubblesugarsocks,2,Sun Jun 28 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"The second week of september (I think it was, or therabouts) was pretty nice, it was in the 100s but totally empty. Same for midmarch, before the spring break rush. That's what I would consider ""off""."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,Supersammiesam,3,Sun Jun 28 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Had the second week of September targeted, kid in school now is a bit difficult to pull out for a week that close to the beginning of school.    On second thought... Labor Day week does not look too bad.  Need to check to see what rides may be down.  Still weighing if going during the Halloween overlay is worth the extra crowds.  Considering it has been 9 trips since we have visited the park in a ""normal"" state, may be worth taking a break from holiday stuff."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,valiamo,2,Sun Jun 28 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"They cap it so it's not to bad. We were they for Halloween last year and it was great. We thought it was going to be bad, but most people with kids leave right after the fire works."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,valiamo,2,Sun Jun 28 06:02:53 2015 UTC,"It is a great evening, and if you like rides, on the Haloween night they tend to have real short lines, as everyone is getting gobs of candy.     The treat trails are fun, as each one has a number of activities, and loads of candy.  Take a camera, as the costumes are outstanding.  Book and pay for your Halloween party tickets AS SOON as they are released, mid July, they sell out for almost every date, and as you get closer to the 31st are always sold out.    You will get a voucher that you exchange for a wrist band at the turnstile."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,valiamo,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"We will be there the whole week, worth going multiple times? I was thinking about trick or treat Monday and Wednesday night, skipping Friday becasue we will be driving back on Sat morning."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,foxhound-mgs,2,Sun Jun 28 16:07:41 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting question, we did the Monday, and then DCA on the Wednesday and that park was full to capacity.    We did have fun with the activities, and were a group of 4 adults.     The character interaction is excellent, but it is an extra $70 for park entry, I could not justify paying for a second evening.  Tickets get you one park entrance from after 3 till midnight. You could use the day for a rest up, and hit the rides big time during the evening.   Don't forget to catch the fireworks, as they are Halloween themed. You really don't want miss the fireworks.  Up close is best, but the crowds are huge."
Disneyland,3bd3eg,M3wThr33,2,Sun Jun 28 16:21:39 2015 UTC,$70 per person is a bit steep. $600 for three of us three nights would be a bit much.  Might do two because of what you mentioned with DCA on the Wednesday night.  Maybe do Wed/Fri thinking that Monday DCA overflow will not be as bad as the rest of the week.

Disneyland,3b5rgu,Tui717,8,Fri Jun 26 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"Cast members, is this official?"
Disneyland,3b5rgu,dodgepodge,15,Fri Jun 26 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, yes. The details might change, so I would treat this as a rumor and hold out until the Parks Blog says something concrete. The rumors I've heard -- and keep in mind these are rumors, I don't have any more solid information than you do -- are that there will be signs everywhere in the parking lots, a slip you get when you park, special audio on the tram, and Guest Relations at the security check-in to enforce it.  If the rumors hold up, I think that it'll work well for Mickey and Friends, but I'm not sure how they'll handle Toy Story or guests coming in from Good Neighbor hotels -- they'd likely have to catch them at the security check or coming in."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,EnglishMobster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:16:07 2015 UTC,"I know what a Good Neighbour hotel is, but what does Toy Story mean?"
Disneyland,3b5rgu,Eilavamp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:45:10 2015 UTC,"The Toy Story parking lot. If you park in Mickey, you hear a spiel on the tram, but the buses from TS have no announcement."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:42:01 2015 UTC,"Toy Story is another guest parking lot, across from the Anaheim Convention Center. It's just down Harbor, right past the intersection of Harbor and Katella. A lot of Annual Passholders (and CMs) prefer to use Toy Story, since it uses buses instead of trams and is a lot faster to get in and out of.  When you're waiting to go back to the Mickey and Friends Parking Lot after the fireworks or at park closing, there will be times where 3-4 trams will go by before you finally get a chance to board. There can be long gaps between these trams. The buses are all lined up in a row, and once one fills there's another bus immediately behind it. Additionally, the buses have air conditioning/heating and protect you from wind and rain better than the tram does.  Katella Blvd. has a lot less traffic than Ball Road does, so you'll get to the parks faster if you're coming from the 57 Freeway. If there's a major sporting event going on, however, Katella does get a little backed up -- but not as bad as Ball does, with everyone trying to go to work/come back from work."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,EnglishMobster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"Parking CM, con confirm that the Toy Story Lot is a much better experience. Plus you're guaranteed to get in rather than being given the go-around we do for M&F in the mornings right now sending traffic to other lots.  That said, yes the ban is official. We have updated spiels for the trams as well as the bus loaders for Toy Story are supposed to be letting guests know too. In addition to that we will be handing out buckslips at the tolls starting June 30 to let guests know of the new policy."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,twisty77,25,Fri Jun 26 22:59:46 2015 UTC,"So until Disney says something from official channels, please treat this as a rumor. I personally don't know of any changes to the policy as of yet, but I've heard rumors and speculation regarding the future of the policy. Nothing has been confirmed as of yet, and I don't want to confirm anything until Disney says it exactly.  In the meantime, I've created a megathread for further discussion of the matter. Feel free to discuss this rumor in here or in the megathread -- I don't want to stifle the discussions we already have going on inside this thread, but I'd like for future discussions to be held inside a single thread to avoid cluttering the front page. Myself or the other moderators will attempt to keep the body of the post updated with the latest info."

I also don't want this selife stick madness to detract from our theme days -- I had something planned out for tomorrow.  If another mod wants to sticky the thread, they're more than welcome to, but it's my opinion that simply having an in-your-face header at the top of the subreddit is enough. It doesn't work as well for those viewing the subreddit on a mobile app or with the subreddit CSS disabled, but I don't want to make our theme days another casualty of the selfie sticks."

Disneyland,3b5rgu,billypowergamer,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:51:56 2015 UTC,I hope that CM's are trained to recognize the difference between a selfie stick and a grip for a gopro.
Disneyland,3b5rgu,EnglishMobster,5,Fri Jun 26 07:49:15 2015 UTC,"GoPro grips and monopods are included in the policy. The exact criteria is ""any sort of pole with an attachment for any kind of camera or mobile device."" The reason behind the blanket ban is so that way people don't walk around with 3-foot canes that have a place to put their camera on them and then try to use the excuse ""but it's not a selfie stick, it's a monopod/grip!""  If people didn't hold them out to the side on rides, we wouldn't need to ban them -- unfortunately, people try to get their cameras as far out of the ride vehicle as they can, so even small grips are banned. You can still buy the little straps to mount them on your wrist or head, but if you do so you should still keep you hands and arms inside of the ride vehicle while it's in motion."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,billypowergamer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"thank you for clearing that up.  I didn't figure that a small grip wouldn't be an issue, but if people can't listen to the part about keeping themselves inside the ride I guess that's fair.  sucks for the rest of us that know better I guess."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,brygphilomena,6,Sat Jun 27 00:29:04 2015 UTC,Why should they be? Its essentially the same thing except with something else attached to the end of it. It still poses all the same problems as selfie sticks.
Disneyland,3b5rgu,billypowergamer,8,Sat Jun 27 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"A grip is not extendable, it's a means of holding the camera because it is easier to stabilize.  If they are going to ban these, then ban everything else that people walk around with in their hand."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,TinSpoonsForever,3,Fri Jun 26 16:15:57 2015 UTC,Not allowed on a ride. GoPros attached to the head or body are A-Okay.
Disneyland,3b5rgu,Xaixas,2,Fri Jun 26 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think CMs would get you for those when you're just walking around, but possibly on the rides?"
Disneyland,3b5rgu,brygphilomena,2,Fri Jun 26 22:07:46 2015 UTC,"That's one thing, I was picture a go pro on a stick. I've seen lots of go pros on long sticks."
Disneyland,3b5rgu,YoSoyKevin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:11:58 2015 UTC,This is also my concern!  There really is no easy way to use a go pro without one of the grips (not the extendable arm).  The wrist housing is awkward to use and the chest and head mounts are not ideal either.
Disneyland,3b5rgu,billypowergamer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:30:55 2015 UTC,i don't know if you saw it but EnglishMobster posted more details of the ban.  it seems they are banning all monopods.  I'm willing to try the wrist mount as it's better then nothing.

Disneyland,3b62i4,dodgepodge,3,Fri Jun 26 16:34:33 2015 UTC,Ban confirmed.
Disneyland,3b62i4,SnarkMasterRay,4,Fri Jun 26 16:58:05 2015 UTC,I don't have one of these yet but I've been thinking of buying one. I'd be curious as to how broad it's defined and if something like the wrist mount would also fall under a ban.  edit I wrote this just as a question in case your briefing either answers it or doesn't and it's a gray area I should look into more.
Disneyland,3b62i4,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty safety conscious and am more interested in the ""ruling"" and leeway CMs will have - I know they don't have the time to check out every half-baked contraption or really any of them. I shot California Screamin' with a GoPro Velco strapped to my wrist with strips I cut because the conventional one holds it at the wrong angle for when your arm is holding on to the shoulder handle bar. There was no way that thing was coming off, but I doubt the CMs would have the time or inclination to check if there's any question.  I was hoping to try again this summer with a dead cat to pick up more of the screams, but I'll understand if it has turned into ""this is why we can't have nice things.""

Disneyland,3b62i4,EnglishMobster,22,Fri Jun 26 23:20:27 2015 UTC,"If a selfie stick comes out on an attraction, the CMs are told to stop vehicle motion entirely. Recently this has caused California Screamin' to go down almost daily -- I believe Big Thunder Mountain has also gone down a couple of times as well.  Once the ride stops, it can take hours for it to start up again -- which means that all the guests have to get off, sometimes when they are in an ""awkward"" location. See here, here, and here."
Disneyland,3b62i4,hawaiian717,4,Sat Jun 27 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"Not even King Arthur's Carousel is immune. I was there a couple of weeks ago on the carousel when the operator made a couple of announcements asking a rider to put away her selfie stick or the ride would be stopped and she'd have to get off. Sure enough he did stop the ride, told everyone that the ride wasn't over and after a couple of minutes we were going again. I couldn't see anything from my horse but I assume that the woman didn't put her selfie stick away and was removed from the carousel (or maybe she put it away after the ride stopped)."
Disneyland,3b62i4,jaketheknight,2,Fri Jun 26 07:36:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, seems more common then I expected. Has there ever been major things, like someone hitting the interior of a ride with a stick?"
Disneyland,3b62i4,EnglishMobster,7,Fri Jun 26 07:40:55 2015 UTC,"Not that I've heard of. It may have happened, but Disney keeps those things under very tight lock and key -- if an incident happens, CMs are not allowed to talk about it, even with other CMs."
Disneyland,3b62i4,golf4miami,8,Fri Jun 26 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"I think that's actually just a strict legal thing that you can't talk about it with anyone.

One good photo from film you had to ask someone to take, then have developed will end up framed on the livingroom table for everyone to see."

Disneyland,3b62i4,Ekkusu_x,2,Sun Jun 28 06:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sad for the ban, for people who used them properly like on my last trip, for people who use them to get pictures in front of landmarks like the front Mickey Head garden.  Not so sad for the people who use them for selfish rude means, like on the same trip, who almost used their selfie stick in means of keeping Chip stopped so they'd have to take a picture with them. I could feel the cringe coming off the Character. Luckily Dale was close behind as well as the CM helper."
Disneyland,3b62i4,ScalierLemon1,6,Tue Jun 30 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"So, is anyone here genuinely sad that they are possibly being banned?"

Disneyland,3b62i4,EagleEyeInTheSky,11,Fri Jun 26 07:50:39 2015 UTC,"I used to like selfie sticks. Honestly.  Until they got super popular, turned into the ""must have"" item on your trip to Disney, and started causing problems with ride operations. Once emergency stops become a daily occurrence, it's time to make some changes."
Disneyland,3b62i4,pinksoccer,8,Fri Jun 26 08:07:45 2015 UTC,"I have used a selfie stick at the park. Only in front of the castle. I bought it for my wife as a joke and we've only used it a handful of times. Once disneyland banned then on rides we stopped taking it with us at all.  To be stupid enough to use it on a ride, forcing a shut down is extremely selfish. It angers me that the vanity of one person. Can screw up something for multiple people."

Disneyland,3b62i4,loyns15,2,Fri Jun 26 20:09:09 2015 UTC,"I am beyond ecstatic about this ban. Yes, they are very annoying and get in the way, however, that is not the reason for the ban. Disneyland (and all other Disney entities) is protecting their own hide. It is all about the legal ramifications, if anybody gets hurt from a selfie stick, the victim will automatically turn suit and file against Disney. ($$$)  If Disneyland does not have any procedures warning about the danger of selfie sticks, they will be held liable for every single injury occurring from the selfie stick. Working in the legal field, it is all about preventative measures. If Disneyland is negligent in taking care of their guests, they will pay the price. That's all this is, a preventative measure that will allow Disneyland to avoid liability.   I am sure Disneyland deeply cares about their guests, however, this is all about preventing future litigation, which everyone knows would happen eventually because of a simple accident. I understand their decision and respect it, especially since I can't stand the stinking things."
Disneyland,3b62i4,incride,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:39:25 2015 UTC,After visiting the park this past holiday weekend and i found that park in general a much more pleasant experience. The sight lines while walking around were uncluttered.   I think one unintended benefit is that people went back to asking strangers to take pictures for them which i think i also increases social awareness that you're not the only one in the parks.

Disneyland,3b62i4,luigifangirl,2,Tue Jul 7 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"They will be asked to leave if they use it on a ride. Because that's a safety hazard EVEN if they didn't know about the ban, because they're putting everyone else in jeapoardy by using it on a ride.   Now if they just used the stick around the park or in a show, then we have to escort them to go turn it in. But they can also be kicked out depending on how they react to the ban, because some guests have not taken it lightly when the ban is explained to them."

Here's a reference picture I found just by searching.  The bigger lockers sell out early though so I would go there as soon as you can.  Another thing you can try is going to the Newstand near the front.  It's the small shop thing on the left side as soon as you get into Disneyland.  They have a bag check system for things you buy in the park where you sign a form, leave your item, and then pick it back up later.  They might be able to do this for you with the car seat.  I'm not positive, as I've only ever used it for things I've purchased at Disneyland, but it's worth a shot!   Hopefully this helps. :)"

Disneyland,3b6qi1,95688it,2,Fri Jun 26 17:30:47 2015 UTC,A friend was saying she thought it would be fine if we left it in stroller parking because it's not large. Maybe?
Disneyland,3b6qi1,klaceo,8,Fri Jun 26 17:57:57 2015 UTC,you wanna carry it around all day?? I wouldn't recommend that.   My best guess would be to Call the Disneyland hotel or grand Californian and ask them if they can store it for you.   also never leave anything unattended with the stroller. people take them all the time.

Disneyland,3b6qi1,sandbrah,2,Fri Jun 26 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one.  I'm assuming the friend you are staying with can't drop you off at the park and and pick you up again?  I was also trying to think of a way to use the Disneyland Resort Express (which doesn't require car seats) to your advantage, but you would still need to be in a car at some point.  UberFamily does not yet seem to be available in the OC yet, either.  Perhaps a kind Redditor in the area will let you store your carseats in their car for the day?  Have you considered staying at an inexpensive hotel/motel near the park instead of staying at your friend's house?  You would eliminate the Uber fees and the carseat issue (which has got to be worth something).  This is a tough one.  I'm from the Bay Area as well (and with two kids) and to avoid this issue we've been flying Southwest to John Wayne and taking the Disneyland Resort Express to a hotel near the park or we drive directly to a hotel near the park."

Like this:   http://www.amazon.com/Chicco-Keyfit-Caddy-Stroller-Frame/dp/B005JDOYF0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1435341702&sr=8-4&keywords=chicco+keyfit  I believe this only works for infant size car seats though and you'd need to make sure the stroller frame fits your specific car seats.  You can also give Disneyland a call and ask regarding storage. (714) 781-4636  Lastly, I was passing through DC once and wanted to check out the Air and Space museum in Virginia before my flight without hauling my bags around inside the museum. A hotel across the street that I didn't stay at was very friendly about letting me store my bags with them. So maybe give that a shot.  Best of luck!"
Disneyland,3b6qi1,helloasianglow,2,Fri Jun 26 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like this is available in OC from a  cursory Google, but Uber has a service called UberFamily that comes pre-loaded with a car seat.  Looks like NYC and DC only at the moment, though."

Maybe there might be a new land, but what I'm really hoping for is a brand new coat of paint for ToonTown. It seems neglected when there could be much more added to it for the people who just got off Small World and want more to do nearby."
Disneyland,3b3vtp,DingoSuavez,15,Thu Jun 25 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"Toontown needs more than a new coat of paint. It needs some kind of draw. I mean currently there's no reason for people who have been to the park a few times to go. We've all met Mickey and Minnie hundreds of times and we aren't kids. Therefore we have no reason to go to Toontown other than the occasional go on Rodger Rabbit.  They need to get rid of some of the buildings used for meet and greets that aren't often, like Chip n' Dales treehouse, Goofy's house etc. and put in either rides or shows that have some kind of draw for people of all ages. Thrill ride, perhaps if there is the space for it.  Maybe they could clear out some of the cast member buildings which I believe are behind Toontown for it. Or demolish the Circle D ranch in favour of a Toontown Expansion and a new land.   But more likely Toontown will be demolished and become New Fantasyland like in WDW."
Disneyland,3b3vtp,mrpiggywinkles52,10,Thu Jun 25 22:20:01 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. What Toontown needs is a 100%  faithful to the series House of Mouse dining experience."
Disneyland,3b3vtp,TheRealMe99,6,Fri Jun 26 03:58:13 2015 UTC,What do you mean? Are you talking a character dining experience with cartoon shorts? That could really work actually. The issue would be having mickey there 24/7 to operate it though..
Disneyland,3b3vtp,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Fri Jun 26 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"A new restaurant that looks exactly like the show's opening with a character dining experience where they could bring out all the ""rarely seen"" characters."

There are toys available, but it's stuff you could find at any Disney Store.  Big Hero 6 was an Oscar winning movie, (no doubt Inside Out will be too) but Disney Parks didn't take a huge role in driving its success. Frozen is the exception right now."
Disneyland,3b6e5d,mildly_interesting,2,Fri Jun 26 14:36:21 2015 UTC,The only reason I could see Inside Out getting more of a Frozen treatment instead of the Big Hero 6 treatment is because Disney had very limited expectations on Big Hero 6 and it's popularity was somewhat surprising.
Disneyland,3b6e5d,golf4miami,3,Fri Jun 26 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"That happened with frozen too though. They ran out of everything, even in the warehouses. Disney expected it to hit big like Tangled then fizzle out. Instead, almost a full year later, you couldn't find an Anna costume for Halloween anywhere, and Elsa was even hard to find. I think they just promote frozen more because princesses are Disney's bread and butter, it's what they've always done ""best"" and it's what sells best."

Disneyland,3b6e5d,thatcaveman,2,Fri Jun 26 16:42:44 2015 UTC,"I think you'll start to see more of it.  I doubt they expected the success it's currently having.  I mean, it opened as the number 2 movie in the box office that weekend, but it still had the biggest opening for an original film.  When you can still break box office records while opening up alongside what is shaping up to be the highest grossing film ever, you know you've got a successful film.  The characters stand out/are more unique than the Big Hero 6 ones (don't get me wrong, I loved that movie too) so I expect you'll see them represented more than that film.  I don't know if it will be force fed to us to the same extent that Frozen has been in the parks lately, but time will tell."
Disneyland,3b6e5d,cpt-cam,2,Fri Jun 26 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if it had anywhere near the staying power of Frozen. Haven't seen it myself yet, but given the numbers, it looks to be a bigger success on opening weekend by about 50%.  But the secret to Frozen's seemingly never-ending march into every facet of the Walt Disney Company is that it is STILL generating massive returns. Of course some of that is cart vs. horse. The merch sells, so they make more. The merch is available, so it sells.  But we won't know where Frozen falls for another 6 months, I'd say.  Disney had committed to the Frozen-themed holiday overlay of WoC, but that was probably driven just as much by their desire to create a holiday version of WoC and the studio's willingness to bankroll the design time for the variation."
Disneyland,3b6e5d,stevensokulski,2,Fri Jun 26 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"...But they've completely redesigned The Maelstrom and are very likely planning a Frozen meet and greet add on to Norway as well. I mean, this is in Epcot, not Disneyland, but Disney World is by far their bread and butter park system.   I'd say where Frozen falls with Disney is in a pretty substantial place."
Disneyland,3b6e5d,howisaraven,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:38:55 2015 UTC,I was commenting more on Disney's commitment to Frozen prior to its staying success.  The franchises tend to have to proven in a pretty big way before appearing in the parks nowadays.
Disneyland,3b6e5d,stevensokulski,2,Tue Jun 30 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be real honest. I didn't love this movie. I thought the concept was cool and I loved that they explained how the brain works in a simplistic and entertaining way but I thought the story as a whole was just ok and felt the resolution was rushed. There was something about this story that felt incomplete. After every other Pixar movie that I consider a favorite (Toy Story, Monster's Inc. Cars) there was solid resolution and finality. The genius for these franchises is the incredible creativity it took to create an entirely new and equally entertaining movie as a sequel to an already outstanding movie. That's hard to do. I felt this movie was just made to keep it going and going and going. There's so much they can do in terms of Riley and her life and where it goes. This is really great but it's not the movie I had hoped for."

Disneyland,3b39eb,stevensokulski,19,Thu Jun 25 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. There's not really any good place to put a third gate that wouldn't be way off site, unless you moved the parking structure or something, and Disneyland park needs a big expansion or overhaul.  The current park maps still have the Mark V Monorails, Club Buzz, the 1998 Tomorrowland murals, the Lion King parking lot tram, the tandem seating Matterhorn bobsleds, and the pink castle. That's how long its been since Disney has been forced to update the park map.  California Adventure has gotten enough focus, let's shift gears back across the promenade.  Now, do I think Disneyland should get a Star Wars land? Eh, not really. I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but I don't like the idea of rooting lands into specific IPs.  I wouldn't be entirely against moving Tomorrowland into a more science fiction realm. I'm sure Disney's thinking about it. I am really going to miss having Tomorrowland keep one foot in reality, but it's not sustainable. The ""futuristic"" additions age quickly and get boring. The land has to constantly be revamped and retooled. The Innoventions House of the Future thing hasn't even been around a decade and it's already dated and cliche. I wouldn't blame any of the managers for wanting Tomorrowland 5.0 to be about looking more into science fiction."
Disneyland,3b39eb,EagleEyeInTheSky,4,Thu Jun 25 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"The Toy Story parking lot is large enough and close enough to serve as a 3rd gate. They may not have any plans currently, but I'd imagine something might be built there in the next decade or so.   Universal's Wizarding World showed that the public is looking for lands rooted into specific IPs. I agree that Tomorrowland is a staple and should not be converted into a Star Wars land. However, in another location, I think a Star Wars land could be an incredible addition to the park, on the magnitude that Harry Potter has been for Universal."

DLP is under a mountain of debt and hasn't made a profit since 2008, it had gotten so bad that they barely had the money to fix the park up (paint was chipping, Anamatronics breaking down, bridges becoming rickety etc.) never mind invest in new rides or parades. The place has been running on auto-pilot for YEARS. I mean they still have the original Pirates and Star Tours, Big Thunder hasn't been updated since the Park's opening and Tower of Terror is decaying LITERALLY, the outside of the building is starting to fall apart.  Well at least until last year. Disney invested 1 BILLION into the park to fix it up, update the rides and start working on new expansions. Thus everything in the park has been fixed and over the next 2 years most of the attractions will be closed at some point or another to be updated. By 2017 everything will be flashy and new.  I think they also pushed back the payment date for the debts until 2030."

Disneyland,3b39eb,klaceo,5,Fri Jun 26 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"Where the heck would they expand into? They've pretty much covered all the land in the surrounding areas. If anything, they'd have to blow up Autotopia and Innoventions and develop there. Would make sense since Tomorrowland and Marvel/Star wars are sorta related."
Disneyland,3b39eb,impactblue5,3,Thu Jun 25 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"It would be a land between Science & Fantasy, so that makes sense.  There's plenty of room beyond the berm behind Frontierland, between Disneyland Drive, the 5, and Ball Road. Move the Casting Center & TDA to the lot of Anaheim RV Village and you'll have twice the space of Tomorrowland to work with."
Disneyland,3b39eb,TrulyGoofy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:41:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard a few rumors, but the most prevalent are that the Pumbaa parking lot will be permanently open to guests or parts of the Katella Cast Member Parking Lot will be open to guests.   Yeah, the cast lot on Katella has already been used for overflow on big visitor days like Christmas, New Years, and the 24-hour days.  I keep hearing that TDA wants to put a parking structure on Pumbaa, just as you've heard, an idea that would give the resort much more parking than just opening the Katella cast lot to visitors, and hopefully that would alleviate the need for an Anaheim RV Village cast lot and open up that area for a new office structure.  As for the backstage storage that's in that area, I'd say move it to the West side of the park outside the berm where they already store big items like the Jungle Cruise boats during ride rehabs.   My bet is that they're going to remove part of Autopia. Not all of Autopia, but part of it.   I'm all for this; the current Autopia is a double length track combining the old TL & FL Autopia tracks. You could take half of the current Autopia, making the track the length of the classic ride, and have more than half of that space to build new attractions in.  I'd also be OK with flipping the Finding Nemo ride, putting the queue & loading in the old Motorboat ride space, making it an OmniMover dark ride, and filling in half of the Subs' lagoon. I'm tired of hearing 3rd hand complaints about the cost of keeping Finding Nemo running, and I'd rather have a C ticket dark ride version than an empty lagoon for 6-9 months out of the year.  Don't forget that the People Mover has to go or be rebuilt. The track was damaged by Rocket Rods and anyway it's no longer covered by CalOSHA Grandfather rules since it has been closed for so long. I'd say make a people mover that connects the proposed Pumbaa Parking Structure with the entry plaza (a ""free"" attraction even before you get into the park!), and add a Star Wars Speeder Bike ride in the same approximate airspace now used by the PM track that goes over the Star Wars/Marvel/Pandora portion of Tomorrowland.   it could be a ""New New Fantasyland"" expansion of some sort.   Only if they don't completely clone the Florida version in Anaheim. I'd love to see a Beauty & the Beast dark ride/Restaurant combo with a ""Be Our Guest"" audioanimatronic show on a 20-minute loop. Hell, I'd enjoy seeing a clone of the Epcot Frozen boat ride! add those to 1 or 2 of Florida's new Fantasyland attractions and any space you reclaim from Autopia/People Mover/Motorboat Lagoon/Nemo is gone."

Disneyland,3b39eb,StephieCupcakes,2,Thu Jun 25 18:53:55 2015 UTC,This is the only logical explanation. The new park would take up the yellow circle. The gate will be right at the bus drop-off. It would make the most sense. This would unify the parking on the west side of the parks and force everyone to walk through Downtown Disney. They could build several parking structures in the existing parking lots to the west. There would be 3 parks with almost equal real estate if they got rid of the myriad of hotels and the Toy Story Parking lot and all the gates would converge around the same area.
Disneyland,3b39eb,Tiny9915,2,Fri Jun 26 01:46:42 2015 UTC,"This sounds great, except.  A. It cuts off Harbor Drive. Which is the busiest surface street in the region.  B. It completely neuters a major transportation depot. Literally every single ART bus goes through there, including all the hotel shuttles.  C. Would require backtracking of years of development of the Anaheim area by Disney, and is clearly not really an option in Disney's long term planning.  D. Is put on a lot of land that Disney doesn't own and will likely not own for years. Disney's been trying to buy up all those buildings for years already, but you sometimes can't force someone to sell no matter how rich you are."

I'm sorry that you feel upset with this subreddit, but the Stick-craze in the parks was a plague upon our house and we are genuinely happy that the exterminator has been called. Like other people have said: they were eyesores, they caused major attractions to go down, they diminished the enjoyment of the parks for EVERYONE in the vicinity when they were used.

People take them on rides, hold them up during shows and block views,  aren't careful with them and hit people and in general are just stupid. I can KIND OF understand needing them if you're a group larger then 4 or 5 MAYBE, but in all honesty they are completely not needed.  Ask some one to take your picture,loom for some one that's part of family,  or a cast member. It's highly unlikely your device will get stolen.  I hate them because I have had my view blocked for shows,  been forced to get off screamin because some one had it out,  had to wait for thunder longer because some one had it out,  have been hit by them multiple times,  and watched people not move in lines  because they were trying to get the best picture OF HER SELF with one. I've had sooooooooo many bad experiences with them and I have never ever seen one and thought 'wow it's good that they have a selfie stick or that shot would be impossible!'    End rant.

Disneyland,3bb7bw,Prophoto2,18,Sat Jun 27 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if you think the selfie stick ban will hinder your enjoyment of the parks. There are responsible and not annoying ways to use the sticks, but all that is swept away because the majority were irresponsible. And that stinks for the few that were responsible.   I'm not sorry for being happy they've been banned. Because they HAVE effected my enjoyment of the parks.  Selfie stick users had their chance to show they could be responsible with them in the parks, and couldn't follow the one rule, not on rides. So there was precious little hope of tackling the other stick etiquette that was a problem.  I'm sure everyone thinks they used theirs responsibly, but not one person who ever made me duck and weave to avoid getting smacked ever apologized, because they didn't notice, or care, that they were incoviniencing other guests.   So no more playing frogger down walkways to avoid sticks, no more having late comers snake their phone over my shoulder to catch shows, and being able to ride Screamin' without fear of having to hike down the track?  Yeah, all this makes me happy. I don't give a hoot about what anyone does in the parks, until it effects my day."
Disneyland,3bb7bw,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,6,Sat Jun 27 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.   I go to the parks a lot and have rarely seen selfie stick use that wasn't a hindrance to other folks around them. For every one example I see of 'harmless' use I see ten instances of them awkwardly used in the middle of a walking area causing a traffic jam, used during shows and parades to block the views of others around them, or (worst of all) taken out on a ride and potentially creating a significant hazard.  It sucks for the few that used them responsively, but honesty in my view they're in the minority. Furthermore, the primary use of it can easily be replicated with a cast member that will probably be glad to take a picture of you with your phone."

So we are dealing with a number most likely less than 1% (yet, many in this sub are calling ""a majority"")  That's like me saying they should ban ipads because a ""majority"" of ipad users film rides with them, thereby posing a risk to other riders.

Now maybe there were a hundred other stick owners who had them in their pockets so I haven't included them, I don't know.   But again, for me, the only sticks I ever saw that weren't a nuisance were in open areas around the castle.  And for me, being used irresponsibly includes having them out while walking around, not looking where it's swinging even in open areas, and using them to improve your view at shows to the detriment of those around you.  Pulling one out on a ride? I think that should get you bounced from the park.  I don't like the flash photography on rides or using iPad to film any more than anyone else. And the only time I've had words with another guest is when they run into me with strollers/scooters.

Disneyland,3bb7bw,agwood,5,Tue Jun 30 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"It does stink that you can't use it anymore, but like many others have said on here, it has had effect on me personally in the parks.   I've been hit on multiple occasions just sitting in a line. I understand that dodging traffic comes with the territory of navigating Disneyland but evading selfie sticks makes it even harder. Negotiating Main Street becomes a chore. Like somebody said, it's a game of frogger.   All in all, it is unfortunate that you can't use it anymore, however, the park has been loved and enjoyed before selfie sticks and will continue to do so without them. The ban will not change the magic of Disney."

Seriously though, selfie sticks suck and people who try to defend them suck too."

She takes the picture into her room to hang up. Comes running back out five minutes later. Asking me why tinker bell has on such a short dress? If it was inappropriate for her to have on something so short? She even pointed out that if she was turned around we would definitely be able to see her bum.  My 8 year old seemed so justified. I had no idea what to say to her. She is technically right the dress seems so short and for her to be bent over like that makes it seem even shorter.  In the end I told her Tinker Bell may be a fairy but she is still an adult."

Disneyland,3b4dmz,SmallLady,5,Thu Jun 25 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it. It's the only way I'd get any ride pictures. It doesn't stop me from having my own camera used though. There are not as many photopass photographers as they have in WDW but with the new souvenir picture spots added for the 60th I think it'll be well worth it again.   It's nice to have everyone in your party in the picture and not be handing you camera off to a stranger to do it too, however if you have a good camera and don't care about ride pictures or magic pictures (Where they can overlay a character or something into your pictures and there are some for the 60th I've heard.) then you can always ask the photopass photographer to take a picture with your camera or phone or whatever too."
Disneyland,3b4dmz,JalenJade,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:10:43 2015 UTC,Can you give a quick run-down of how it works? I'm intrigued.
Disneyland,3b4dmz,fontizmo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:29:52 2015 UTC,"Basically you order online or at the park (online you save some money but has to be 14 days before your visit.) With an online order you get a voucher and a dvd case with a code inside it. You set the code aside take the voucher to the photo shop in one of the parks and exchange it for a card which is valid for 14 days.   Photopass Photographers scan it and use it just like any other Photopass card and for your ride pictures you get the picture number and go up to the desk with your card, give them the number they'll have you confirm the picture then scan it onto your card.   When you get home you log onto the Photopass website, put in your card number then you redeem your code form the DVD case for a digital download of everything in your Photopass account, which you can then have printed anywhere (releases are included with the download.)   For Magic Shots you have to ask the Photopass Photographer if they have any they can do, each area has a selection of what's available due to what works or doesn't work in that area visually. They have you pose a certain way; For instance you can be holding Tinkerbell   I don't know how any of the 60th stuff works, I still have 6 days before I'll be there."
Disneyland,3b4dmz,JalenJade,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Ohh ok! So as I understand it's basically like the regular photo pass on my AP, but you can also get ride photos. That sounds great! Thanks!"
Disneyland,3b4dmz,fontizmo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:35:39 2015 UTC,Yep and you can even use it to get all the photos you've had put onto your AP account as well. Basically as long as they're still in the Photopass system (and they might even be able to add more if you call them) you can get digital copies of them all.

Disneyland,3b4dmz,fontizmo,3,Tue Jul 7 22:46:49 2015 UTC,Also $100 divided by even only 4 people is SUPER cheap.  So if you have a large group it is definitely worth it.  It's even cheaper at $69 if you preorder 2 weeks before your trip.
Disneyland,3b4dmz,ptriz,4,Fri Jun 26 00:16:21 2015 UTC,"am I reading this wrong then? because this says $199, with $169 preorder...  https://mydisneyphotopass.disney.go.com/keepsakes/index/notlogged/  oh nevermind, that is a different product. https://www.disneyphotopass.com/specialoffers/dlrppp.htm  so is the difference that you cannot download the photopass plus photos?"

I mostly got it for the ride photos because it took me 39 years to get here and who knows when I'll get the chance to get back.

The welcome to Disneyland tour is the cheapest and gets you priority seating for Aladdin if you enjoy that show. (You get to enter with the first group and get your pick of where to sit) I think it's worth the cost just for that alone."

Disneyland,3b0uw2,holdenscott,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"Is there a signficant difference between the number of shutdowns due to sticks between Thunder and Screamin'?  If thunder has signficicantly less, than maybe having some signs on screamin would have been a good step before a park-wide ban.  Related, how many shut downs are there due to general dropped things? I was talking to a WDW ride op' and he said at the end of the day they would pick up between 5-10 phones at the bottom of the attraction."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,Ampage86,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to downtimes that occur at BTM, simply because I don't know when or why they go down. I don't get that information during my shift. Signage can only do so much, though. Guests don't listen to verbal instructions, so what makes you think they'd listen to a sign? I think that's the reasoning behind not getting signs at DCA.   In general, selfie sticks have become a danger to the guest using it, as well as the surrounding guests.   Again, I can't speak to other attractions (except Goofy's I know goes down several times a day due to hats landing on the track) and their downtimes due to dropped objects. Screamin' typically won't go down for something that's dropped unless it has medical significance for the guest or we can see that it causes an immediate safety concern. But that's the rule for most other attractions, too."

I think that's the reasoning behind not getting signs at DCA.    I ask because most of the times I hear  about selfie sticks shutting down rides is screamin as opposed to thunder.   One attraction has signs, one doesn't. I was just curious if there is any correlation.    In general, selfie sticks have become a danger to the guest using it, as well as the surrounding guests.    I agree that they can be dangerous,  as can phones, bags, cameras or any other item that can and has fallen out of rides, but are not (yet)  banned. This was why I was asking about the rates of other objects falling out of / shutting down rides.    Again, I can't speak to other attractions (except Goofy's I know goes down several times a day due to hats landing on the track) and their downtimes due to dropped objects.    And that is my point. If Disney or guests have a genuine concern over safety and rides being shut down, they would welcome a ban on all loose items (knotts/6 flags style)   Seems to me it would make the park a safer and more efficient (less ride shut downs) of a place."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,Ampage86,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:29:18 2015 UTC,"But, people in general don't hold their bags, cameras, and other valuables during the ride. That's what the pouch/floor of the train is for! Hats are understandable; people like to leave them on, and nine times out of ten they stay on (provided they are worn backwards), but you get the occasional one that flies off. If noticed, we can initiate the downtime and recover MUCH faster than normal because we know the cause wasn't technical, it was observed. (It should be noted that Screamin' doesn't usually suffer the problem of items landing on the track that Goofy's or other coasters do.)  Which brings me to selfie stick hate: people are just too obsessed with ""getting the shot"" without regard for the safety implications. They daren't risk their bag, but a selfie stick? GOTTA GET THEM INSTA LIKES! Seriously, they'll spend WAY too long cramming everything into those pouches, including spare change, and we'll inform them of selfie stick policy during this, usually twice, but it still comes out. At that point, it becomes a stupidity problem, not a rules problem."

Just like the stupid people that don't propperly use the pouches.    Seriously, they'll spend WAY too long cramming everything into those pouches, including spare change, and we'll inform them of selfie stick policy during this, usually twice, but it still comes out. At that point, it becomes a stupidity problem, not a rules problem.    Eliminate the stupidity problem by not giving them the chance to be stupid. No bags, cameras or any loose items in the rides period, and don't let the train leave the station until each seat is verified.   You can't sneak a stick out of the bag or pouch if there is no bag or pouch in the train."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,Ampage86,2,Fri Jun 26 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"You seem really adamant about not having loose items on the train, and I'm not sure why. Did you lose something in the past? It is simply not operationally possible to have guests leave their belongings off of the ride. We don't have room for lockers at Screamin, and the cost to implement that type of thing just isn't feasible. For a wait time that rarely exceeds 25 or 30 minutes, it just isn't worth it. Besides that, there are ways people will get things on rides they aren't supposed to have.   And don't mention cubbies at Screamin. Trains return to the opposite side at the end of the ride, so that's not a possible solution."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,holdenscott,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"You seem really adamant about not having loose items on the train, and I'm not sure why. Did you lose something in the past?    Oh I have no problems personally (because I don't take anything on rides), but I'm not one of the ones complaining about the hazards of loose items,  including selfie sticks. If someone wants a park wide ban on sticks because they are hazardous, then, if they were being intellectually honest, they should want a ban on all loose items."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,Ampage86,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:51:05 2015 UTC,It takes a while for a sign to be created. There's a lot of paperwork that has to be submitted to Resort Enhancement before signs can be created.

I don't want to be nearly hit in the face by a selfie stick. It's only a matter of time until someone gets seriously hurt by one of these sticks. Just think about it. Somebody pulls it out on a ride. It gets knocked out of their hand. Depending on how fast the ride is going, the person it possibly hits may get seriously injured."

I feel like people are obsessed with ""proof"" rather than making actual memories. I could list all the coasters I've ever been on and I actually only bothered with the official photo a couple of times.  Then again I started going to theme parks when I was little in the 90s. Nobody had a regular phone, never mind all the stuff we have now, so there was more of an attitude that the outside world can wait. Also you used your camera sparingly. So maybe I'm not able to relate to kids being welded to technology like it's an extra limb. Idk."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,SupervillainIndiana,7,Thu Jun 25 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"The problem is more widespread than just rides.  Watch the fireworks and see how many people have out their phones to record.  They are more worried about recording the moment they forget to actually enjoy the moment with their own eyes.  It makes me laugh because for the most part their videos are going to be horrible quality, especially on dark rides.  And there are plenty of good recordings on YouTube that can be enjoyed later.    Everyone just has to record it to their latest gadget and upload it to the cloud of clouds so they can never watch it again."
Disneyland,3b0uw2,fernker,3,Thu Jun 25 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with you. I was just trying to avoid coming across as anti-photographs in general. I am certainly not. I think a photo with your spouse or kids or parents in front of something iconic during a holiday is a great tool for stimulating a meaningful memory some time in the future. BUT people have taken it too far. It's like you said, everyone is too busy capturing a moment to say ""I was there!"" rather than actually enjoy the moment.  And don't even get me started on flash in dark places such as dark rides, gigs, evening sports (in a stadium) or fireworks. Well done, you just got a really good photo of a couple of feet in front of you and unidentifiable blurry junk in the background! Plus the flash going off probably blinded everyone around you, especially on a dark ride.  I'm also not against POV videos if I assume the person recording it had permission and had better equipment that didn't intrude on other riders. Most of those people have probably been filming that sort of stuff for years, I'd leave it to them for POVs!"

I actually went to Disneyland Paris a few years back during my last year of elementary school, 2011 it was. Things haven't changed dramatically since then, we tried photos on rides sure, but for the most part we took pictures of the exterior of the attraction. We snapped tons of photos on our first few hours in the parks but soon we realised that was dumb. Even now when I go to DL I only take the occasional photo, it's not an age thing, its a brain size thing."

Disneyland,3b2rhz,Eboy503,3,Thu Jun 25 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"This information may be a bit dated but we were there over the release of the March pin. The line starts moving in DTD at the same time early morning hours begin. So it really has no impact on anyone just going to the parks. We stayed at PPH, so we were entering from the side of the GCH and didn't even notice additional crowds that far back into DTD. If you are staying offsite and arriving for the actual rope drop you shouldn't really notice much of anything.  However, if you need to park first thing in the morning on the day of pin release that could be a bit trickier."
Disneyland,3b2rhz,MeishkaD,4,Thu Jun 25 16:55:00 2015 UTC,It will have no impact on your visit.

Disneyland,3b1jmu,710globtrotter,4,Thu Jun 25 05:38:40 2015 UTC,"I now live up in Oregon, but I grew up in southern California - I've lived in San Diego, Huntington Beach, Long Beach, and Anaheim.  Since you already live in California, I'm sure you know what you're in for price and community wise, so I'll skip that. I've been looking at relocating to Long Beach for similar reasons. Huntington Beach is a touch out of my price range and doesn't have as nice of a feel. The smaller neighborhoods away from downtown in Long Beach had a really nice community feel and the town itself always had a laid-back vibe.  I personally loved living close to the parks and was very sad to move. I'm not sure if I'd have any regrets if I relocated now, but I could see myself being happy returning to Long Beach, as it's about a half hour from the parks, and close to the beach. That and Huntington Beach - or any similar towns within that stretch - are likely your best bet. Best of luck relocating!"
Disneyland,3b1jmu,TheDingalingus,5,Thu Jun 25 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"I moved from Vegas to Costa Mesa a little ways back for work. But being close to Disney was a huge plus in the decision making process.  The situation didn't end up working out as well as I hoped, so I left after about a year. But being close to Disneyland was wonderful. I was in the parks at least once a week. I'd occasionally drop in for lunch if I had a meeting the vicinity, too.  There were certain times of day that I didn't like driving up that way from home. But even in Friday rush hour we could be at the Toy Story parking within a half hour.  During a quieter time of day, we were 15 minutes away."
Disneyland,3b1jmu,stevensokulski,3,Thu Jun 25 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"Just FYI if you're not living within a 5 mile radius of Disneyland, it could be close to a 30 minute drive from any direction. There's no real great route from Huntington Beach, and you'll end up having to drive a lot of surface streets to get there.  You may want to look into Seal Beach to stay near the beach, or Old Towne Orange is a really classic neighborhood but not close to the beach.."

Disneyland,3b1jmu,arobotamongus,2,Fri Jun 26 00:37:47 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Monterey, but left to go to school at USC. I still go back a few times a year to visit family. I've been down here for the last 15+ years. I've lived in various areas all over LA, including Long Beach and Huntington Beach. I currently live in Whittier which is nice because it's much cheaper than living towards the beach, I can take public transportation to get to Downtown LA for work, and I can also quickly get to the 5 freeway right before it hits the 91 which means not much traffic if I want to go to Disneyland (15-20 minute drive).  The problem with living in the LA Beach Communities is that it is very expensive, lots of traffic, bad parking, and sometimes hard to get to. Monterey can also be expensive also I guess depending on where you live, but the traffic on 68 or 1 isn't anything close to what you would deal with in Los Angeles.  Are you looking to rent or to own? Feel free to PM me if you want more details, but if your heart is set on being close to the ocean while closer to Disneyland, Long Beach may be your best bet as far as affordability. My best friend just bought a home in Seal Beach, but that takes quite a bit of money, but has a great small community feel to it.  When I lived near Huntington Beach, I lived a couple miles from the 5 freeway near Beach Blvd. It's a pain in the butt to get down to the Beach on weekends due to traffic going down the 39 and on top of that it costs money to park at the beach."
Disneyland,3b1jmu,jon98gn,4,Thu Jun 25 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think it's worth paying a premium to live in a beach community. Parking is difficult, weekend crowds, and when I did live by the beach, I never went because I knew I'd be able to go the next day. I would probably get close enough to Disneyland and a beach where it is convenient but not too close to either. Oh and Anaheim is called ""Ana-crime"" for a reason."

Disneyland,3b0h9a,catrain,2,Thu Jun 25 18:12:08 2015 UTC,"The earlier dates are less popular than the ones closer to the actual day of Halloween, so the tickets don't sell out as quickly, and sometimes early dates don't sell out at all. That being said, if trick or treating is your goal, I recommend going on Halloween night bc the cast members tend to give candy generously as it is the last night. If shows/rides/meet and greets are your goal, I don't recall the park being so crowded even on sold out days. I personally go for the trick or treating and shows, so I go on Halloween night every year.   TL;DR The park doesn't get THAT crowded on a sold out night (I.e nowhere near capacity like on the 24 hr days) and it's more important to worry about certain more popular days selling out earlier than others."
Disneyland,3b0h9a,link4lyfe,2,Thu Jun 25 01:24:02 2015 UTC,We have gone the past two years and they sell out the event so it doesn't get over crowded. Also all the candy lines they have eat up a lot of the people that go.   Edit: I don't remember when they go on sale but I believe APs get early access and a discount.
Disneyland,3b0h9a,herrerasaurus87,2,Thu Jun 25 01:41:14 2015 UTC,I think they went on sale early for pass holders last year around July 15 and then went on sale for the general public on July 31.   I went during one of the weekday parties last year and it was great! Not too crowded so I was able to do a lot of the stuff specifically done for the parties :)
Disneyland,3b0h9a,Sarroarr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember them going on sale either late July or in August.

Disneyland,3axkxv,DisneylandMod,13,Wed Jun 24 08:46:08 2015 UTC,"I managed to see the original Disneyland version exactly once -- when I was 2 years old. I don't remember it, obviously, but I've seen a picture of myself as a baby in a stroller on Main Street looking very excited about it, so I must've enjoyed it.  I did manage to see the version that went to California Adventure -- several times, in fact. I was a bit older then, so I remember it a bit better.  Obviously, I'm also an Attractions cast member at Disneyland. This means I work the parades, and ever since the 60th started I really haven't seen anything other than the parade route. I've become really quite familiar with Paint the Night, even though I've only managed to see the parade as a guest exactly one time (during a preview night for cast members before the general public saw the parade).  I do have to say that the train float at the beginning of the Electrical Parade is easily my favorite float of all time. As much as I love Paint the Night's drum, I am a sucker for that train float. The Electrical Parade did some pretty neat stuff, considering all they had were simple lightbulbs -- the legs moving on the centipede float, the wheels of the train/Cinderella float, etc. are all still really neat, and nowadays they would just be an LCD screen (which isn't nearly as cool).  I dislike that in Paint the Night there was so much Pixar and so little Disney. The whole parade is geared more towards newer movies than older ones, and the Electrical Parade did a much better job overall with its selection of properties to incorporate. I never really liked Pete's Dragon (the movie) as a kid, so I never liked the float that went along with it in the parade, but I did like that they included things like Robin Hood, Dumbo, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs -- all of which are rarely seen nowadays (Snow White is still popular, but the Seven Dwarfs are not). I will say that Paint the Night has a much better finale (I'm sorry, /r/MURICA). Paint the Night's finale actually feels like a finale, and not just one random very long America float.  The Frozen float in Paint the Night is one of my favorites in the whole parade, which surprised me because I really wasn't expecting to like it. Same with Mack (the truck from Cars). Even the ""simple"" floats like the Monster's Inc float (with LCD screen doors) are really neat and fun to look at -- while the Electrical Parade has a few cool non-light effects (the ""cannonballs"" from the Peter Pan unit were always really cool to me), I think I still like the Paint the Night floats better as a whole. Paint the Night could have been improved with more non-light effects, like having bubbles come from Ariel's float (which the daytime Soundsational parade does from time to time) or ""snow"" come out from Anna and Elsa's float.  The Cinderella float is much better than Paint the Night's Belle float -- a common complaint is that Belle looks a bit like a birthday cake, which is something I agree with. Rapunzel and Cinderella were kind of tacked on to Belle and don't have nearly the same level of detail (they were actually a very last-minute addition to the parade, I've heard). The Electrical Parade has a royal court dancing under a tarp, which works much better than having poorly-lit princesses being towed along behind a birthday cake.  Both parades have a bit of an issue with lighting up the characters, which is a bit odd for an electrical parade. Paint the Night solves this (to a certain extent) by putting little lightbulb ""antennae"" on top of certain characters to light up their faces, which looks a bit weird on Jessie and Tinkerbell. Even so, Cinderella and Rapunzel have issues with lighting, although it seems to have gotten better as of late.  The music in the Electrical Parade is classic, of course, but it gets just a bit repetitive by the end of the parade. I appreciate the little motifs they added in there to the different characters as they pass by, but there's only so much of Baroque Hoedown I can take. ""When Can I See You Again"" suffers from the same thing, but it's made a little bit more bearable because I can sing along (and I'm a sucker for singing along to stuff). I also appreciate how they managed to incorporate just little bits of the original Electrical Parade soundtrack, although I wish at certain points they had made the Baroque Hoedown a little more obvious. I just wish there was one section where they still played the ""old"" music, unaltered.  From a cast member standpoint, Paint the Night somewhat limited itself due to how the Imagineers decided to tackle the crowding issue. The entire operation is designed to force guests to choose whether they want to see Paint the Night or Fantasmic -- they can't see both. This ""splits"" the crowds for both shows and creates a thinner crowd than there would be otherwise.  Paint the Night is also designed to run just before the fireworks and not to give the guests any time to lock up the streets for the fireworks show. This allows us more time to use the streets as a walkway, but it also means that any delay to Paint the Night will delay the fireworks show as well. The same thing happens with Fantasmic -- if Fantasmic gets delayed, so does the fireworks show.  The City of Anaheim only allows fireworks to be launched until 10 PM. No fireworks can explode after 10 PM (Fantasmic launches fireworks, but they don't explode). The fireworks last 15 minutes, so this means they have to go on before 9:45. The fireworks are scheduled to go off at 9:30 every night, so there's a 15-minute gap for things to go wrong. Since fireworks have a higher ""priority"" than Paint the Night does, floats may be dropped and crosses canceled to make Paint the Night go faster. This also limits the max size of Paint the Night -- there can't be nearly as many floats as the Electrical Parade had, and most ""minor"" floats they run must be able to be dropped without impacting the show too badly. Timing is so tight that Paint the Night only launched with 1 cross -- for the record, Soundsational (which is about the same length) has 4 crosses. Now Paint the Night has 2 crosses and is a bit more stable -- but it can still be a nightmare trying to cross the parade route sometimes.  The crowd control tactics work -- there's no denying it, from an operational standpoint the park would be much worse without it. But it does limit Paint the Night, and to a certain extent it shows.  Overall, the decision is hard to call. I don't have as much nostalgia for the Electrical Parade as others do -- I have a few vague memories of it over at DCA, but that's it. I mainly remember the train, Alice, and Pete's Dragon. I really like some of the stuff the Electrical Parade does and I wish they had incorporated a lot of the things in Paint the Night -- but honestly, as a whole I very slightly prefer Paint the Night. The new technology is really cool -- I really like the Nemo performers and I really like the more high-tech lighting. I appreciate what the Electrical Parade did with its lightbulbs -- a lot of their effects are really cool -- but honestly, I have to say I do like Paint the Night just a teensy bit more."
Disneyland,3axkxv,EnglishMobster,3,Wed Jun 24 09:53:47 2015 UTC,"You work the parades?  God speed, those crowds get nasty.  Let It Go makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up for an entirely different reason now.  I hear it as more of a tsunami warning when it goes off during the fireworks.  I know that if I'm not out of that gate by the time Step Into the Magic starts playing things are all over."
Disneyland,3axkxv,purple_people_eaters,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the logistics will get easier in the months ahead. Now that we're past summer solstice, the days will start to get shorter, sunset will be earlier, so the parade can be scheduled to start a bit earlier, buying a bit more wiggle room before the fireworks.   I'm old enough to remember the MSEP/fireworks combo working the same as PTN today. But what I don't remember was how long the fireworks were, but if the old show was really as short as the recent Fantasy in the Sky revival, then they had another 10 minutes before the 10pm cutoff (assuming Anaheim bad the same rule back then).   I've only seen the show in person once and not from the best spot, but I will say PTN is certainly more impressive from a tech pespective with all the things they can do now, though you do make a good point about MSEP being pretty clever with just light bulbs. I've watched a couple of YouTube recordings and I will say the soundtrack is starting to grow on me. I will say it wasn't nearly as bizarre an experience as seeing SpectroMagic with its orchestral soundtrack after growing up with MSEP and its electronic synthesizer soundtrack."
Disneyland,3axkxv,hawaiian717,0,Thu Jun 25 05:03:31 2015 UTC,"3 out of the 8 floats in Paint the Night are Pixar floats, so in my opinion they got the balance of them just right."

Disneyland,3axkxv,pizzabears,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:35:50 2015 UTC,"I did not see the MSEP until watching it on YouTube, but I think Paint the Night fits this era. Before, MSEP used the technology and knowledge we had during that period of time to make that parade one of the best of its time. Now that we know and can do more, PTN takes that into consideration and has made it into something bigger, greater, and brighter.   I just recently watched the parade at Disney (miraculously found a spot to sit at 6:15 for the 8:50 parade). And oh my goodness it is crazy, crazy, crazy both crowd and parade wise.  The floats and costumes were absolutely incredible. I loved how the character's faces were lit up by a little light. The dancers were so energetic and bright that it added to the excitement and glory of the parade.   I felt that the parade needed some more Disney. I would have loved to see some Lion King in there or Alice in Wonderland!   I think an Aladdin float would be really cool. I know there's a Genie, but just imagine...Prince Ali on an elephant? or a magic carpet? That would be fun.   With that being said, both parades are wonderful. PTN definitely has that ""WOW"" factor and kids love it."

Anyway our first morning as sometime around 6:00 we're pulling out the canoe dock in reverse when one of our skips stands up, pulls out an invisible handset, and radios in our status.   Jungle 1 from the Canoe. Be advised we are currently 6 shot, floating freely midstream in a strange part of the river I've never seen before. Please advise.   And so we began our first lap around the river with a cadence of:    Stroke Stroke Stroke HEART ATTACK Stroke Stroke Stroke   Some of the skips were a little more vigarous with their strokes than others which led to a lot of splashing on what was a very cold morning.    Skip 1: It's freezing out here, why is this water so warm?  Half beat later and three seats up.  Skip 2: Sorry!   All in all it was a fantastic trip around the island with only minor fallout. Turns out the park was hosting a special media event on the deck of the Columbia, our antics were seen and herd by more then a few managers and we were later reprimanded about the difference between onstage and offstage.   Turns out that even at 6:00 in the morning, before the park ever opens to guests, while attending a cast member only event, in civilian clothes, in a tiny canoe, you are still considered on stage."

Disneyland,3aw715,Hyro0o0,7,Wed Jun 24 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, dear. I have a number of them. I've said most of them on the subreddit before, though, so let me try to dig up my favorites.    One day, a guest walked up to me outside of Star Tours holding a map:   Guest: So, let me get this straight. [Points to Adventureland] I can go anywhere in the park but Adventureland?  Me: No, you can go into Adventureland. Adventureland should be open.  Guest: Oh, because I was told my ticket won't let me into Adventureland.  Me: There shouldn't be any reason that you can't go into Adventureland. Your ticket got you into Disneyland and you can go to any land inside of Disneyland you want. You can head over to Adventureland right now if you wanted to.  Guest: Then why do they sell tickets just for Adventureland?!  Me: [Moment of realization] If you don't have a park hopper ticket, you can't get into California Adventure across the way...  Guest: Oh! Is that what the place across the street is?  Me: Yes. It's another Disney theme park. If you don't have a park hopper ticket, you won't be able to get in there, but you're fine to go anywhere you want inside of this park.  Guest: Ohhhhh. I thought it was a water park...     In front of the castle:   Guest: Where's the castle?  Me: Right here...?  Guest: No, no, no, the other castle! The big one!  Me: This is the only castle we have.  Guest: No, there's another one! I've seen pictures on the internet of it! It's really big and there's a room on the inside!  Me: That's at Walt Disney World.  Guest: Oh! Where's that? Is that across the street?  Me: ...Walt Disney World is in Florida.  Guest: Oh.   ""Where's the castle?"" is actually more common of a question than one might think. I get it about once a month along the parade route, although usually the castle is out of sight when they're asking it and I assume they're just lost. That's the only time someone's asked me that in front of the castle.    Inside of Star Tours, across from C3PO:   Guest: Where is Star Wars?  Me: ...You're in line for Star Tours right now.  Guest: I want to go on Star Wars, not Star Tours.  Me: This is the only Star Wars ride we have here at Disneyland.  Guest: I thought you said this was Star Tours.  Me: This is Star Tours. It's a Star Wars ride. There's C3PO and R2-D2 right there.  Guest: Isn't Star Tours the one with Spock?  Me: ...That's Star Trek. That's owned by a completely different company.     The contender for one of the common questions ever, courtesy of the Star Tours flight deck:   Guest: Do we need these 3D glasses?  Me: Well, you don't need them, but if you don't wear them outer space looks really blurry.   Seriously, that question happens at least 2-3 times every hour on a slow day. Between the giant FLIGHT GLASSES REQUIRED sign and the fact that we wouldn't give you things if you didn't need them, I'm still not sure why that question is so common. Nobody else on the Star Tours cast knows why that question gets asked so much, either. Nowadays we'll ask our coworkers that question when we're here as a guest just because.     Guest: Can I bring my dog onto the ride with me? I can fasten him into the seat.  Me: Unfortunately, your dog cannot ride with you. I can offer you a rider switch pass, or-  Guest: But he's really good in cars!     Out of nowhere on the Star Tours Flight Deck:   Guest: What is the capital of Mississippi?  Me: ...M?   I totally knew it was Jackson. Obviously.    Inside of Star Tours, by C3PO:   Guest: Where is the bathroom?  Me: The bathroom is outside, on the other side of Star Tours, right by the Plaza Inn.  Guest: I was told this was the bathroom.  Me: No, this is Star Tours. We don't have a bathroom in here.  Guest: [Going backwards in line] Well, then maybe you guys need to be a little bit more obvious about where your bathrooms are.   Keep in mind that by this point the guest had been waiting in line for a solid 15-20 minutes. I know the women's restrooms can have a bit of a line sometimes, but not that long. And I doubt any cast members actually told her to go inside of Star Tours to find the restroom."

Another time a guest got really mad the line for Ana and Elsa was really long, so she walked up to a window and just punched it. The window broke and glass went everywhere...

So they're saying it wasn't an isolated incident."
Disneyland,3avx3l,dodgepodge,13,Wed Jun 24 08:37:23 2015 UTC,And they likely have records of each and every time. Possibly records of communications where they told him to cut it out or he was risking his membership  Sounds like he's doing this as a PR stunt more than anything else. Which might be why his book keeps getting detailed mentions
Disneyland,3avx3l,Techsupportvictim,12,Wed Jun 24 15:54:54 2015 UTC,The suit states that “Walt Dreamers Me” is a “must read for every fan of Disney. Walking through Disneyland with Joseph Cosgrove and seeing every single employee say ‘Hi’ is like walking with a universally loved member of royalty.”   Never miss an opportunity to self-promote eh? Even in your lawsuit against the company that your book praises.  Now I just think this guy is an entitled narcissist.
Disneyland,3avx3l,Hyro0o0,10,Wed Jun 24 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"So this guy gets access to a highly exclusive feature that I suspect came with a contract of rules that he agreed to, gave tickets to someone who then, in full knowledge of the rules violated them. Because he gave the tickets he is responsible for them, which is likely in those rules that he signed that he would follow.  And now he's crying foul. And apparently this isn't the first time he's pulled stunts like this.  Yeah, kick him out."
Disneyland,3avx3l,Techsupportvictim,6,Wed Jun 24 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"Man, looking up that dude's book on Amazon, the reviews look super shady."

And a couple of 'what a piece of crap' ones. Yeah that kind of reeks of perhaps friends padding his reviews
Disneyland,3avx3l,Techsupportvictim,3,Wed Jun 24 15:59:52 2015 UTC,"Even if we take this story at absolute face value, Disney still has every right to revoke access to this sort of stuff. I don't know anything about Club 33 access, but it's well-known that cast members receive sign-ins and complementary tickets every year. We have a rule here against asking for them because they're fairly limited (CMs themselves can get in all they want, but guests are restricted to a certain number of times per year) and because cast members are supposed to only use them for friends and family.  I cannot take any kind of payment for giving someone one of my complimentary tickets or signing someone in -- I can get in huge trouble for it. If I do give someone a complimentary ticket, I have to absolutely trust that the people who get that ticket will use it on themselves and behave.  If I give a ticket to someone and then they turn around and sell it, Disney treats that as if I had sold the ticket in the first place. Similarly, if I sign someone in and they get themselves kicked out of the park, it's treated as if I had done something to get myself kicked out of the park.  It's explicitly stated that you have to keep a close tab on your guests, and you have to trust them. This is just for cast members -- I'm sure Club 33 is even more strict."

I could also add Peter Pan's Flight if you guys really like that movie, but if you're only going for one day, I would almost say this 90 second ride isn't worth it.     Rides to prioritize @ California's Adventure:   Radiator Springs Racers  Toy Story Midway Mania Tower of Terror Soarin' California Screamin'    Suggestion of things to make sure you don't miss in CA:   Turtle Talk with Crush Heimlich's Chew Chew Train    You may question me on the second one, but it's soooo much more than just a little kids ride.

Should I just get fast passes if the line is really long and move on the next ride or are there passes to prioritize? Thanks again."
Disneyland,3ax31v,golf4miami,3,Wed Jun 24 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"Start using Fastpasses as soon as you get there. The quicker you get your first Fastpass the quicker you can get your 2nd and so on. There is no limit to the amount of Fastpasses that you can get so look on your Fastpass and see when you can get your next one and make sure you get that next one right about that time.   As far as what rides to Fastpass and when, that really depends on crowd levels and what you've already done. Many of the rides on my priority list are going to have decent lines no matter what so you would maybe want to use a Fastpass on those. Indiana Jones and Radiator Springs go through their Fastpasses the quickest so make sure you get one from there unless you ride them right away.   I like to get a Fastpass for say Space Mountain and then ride the smaller rides in Tomorrowland until it's time to use that Fastpass or get another one. Hope that helps!"
Disneyland,3ax31v,stormeegedon,2,Wed Jun 24 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"Adding to this that if you don't get a FP for Radiator Springs, don't be afraid to go single rider! It's sometimes faster than the FP line."

Disneyland,3ax31v,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Thu Jun 25 06:49:12 2015 UTC,"Depending on the ages and interests things can vary. However due to his age I'd assume he mightn't be too interested in characters and ""baby rides"".  Therefore I'd suggest prioritizing attractions like Space Mountain,Big Thunder Mountain, The Matterhorn, Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean and The haunted mansion. Maybe Star Tours as well.  For DCA I'd prioritize Radiator Springs Racers, California screamin'. Tower of Terror and Toy Story Midway mania.  In Disneyland I'd go left first, to Adventureland, Frontierland etc. Because I find often more people go right when the park opens."
Disneyland,3ax31v,mrpiggywinkles52,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! If you don't mind me asking,  what's the best way to use fast passes? Should I just get a pass if the line looks too long or are there certain passes I should prioritize?"
Disneyland,3ax31v,chicklette,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:32:10 2015 UTC,"Well I suggest using a fast pass if the line is over an hour for any given attraction, get the pass, go off doing something else and return when the ticket says for a much shorter time.  In case you aren't aware before you enter the line for an attraction there will be a little sign telling you the wait time for the ride, which I normally find accurate.  If parades and fireworks aren't your thing you can go on rides whilst those are ongoing for much shorter queues. But I can't say I recommend missing the current fireworks or the Paint the Night parade. Both are absolutely AMAZING.  I'd suggest checking out this link for more information regarding fast passes: https://disneyland.disney.go.com/guest-services/fastpass/  Finally if you don't know definitely pick up a map of the park when you enter. It mightn't seem too big for Annual Passholders but for first timers it's massive.  EDIT: I forgot to mention, when your in Disney's california Adventure definitely pick up a fast pass for Radiator Springs Racers as soon as the park opens or close to that time. They run out pretty fast, the queues are always massive for that ride and it can't be missed. While if you miss out on a pass for Space Mountain you'll be waiting an hour at most on this ride the queues can be upwards of 2 hours. Currently its just after 11AM in California. Space Mountain is sitting on a 50 minute wait, Radiator Springs is sitting on a 100 minute wait."

Disneyland,3avp93,EagleEyeInTheSky,5,Tue Jun 23 22:37:32 2015 UTC,There's not as many as there used to be. APs used to get a lot more pampered in the parks.  I think the biggest thing about being an AP is just the leisure of being in the parks. You don't have to worry about missing anything that you can't just come back and see again next week. It literally changed the way I viewed the parks.

Disneyland,3aulo3,minimegadoodle,13,Tue Jun 23 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"I think the answer to the question to which row is best depends on which experience you are going for.  In the backseat, you get the whiplash effect.  If you are looking for a more exciting ""Roller Coaster"" experience, than that's probably the best place to sit. (and yes, I see lots of people ask for the backseat.) As for a more immersed environment experience, the front seat would be better... but that's due to the feeling of nothing in front of you but empty space.  The front seat is a much better entertainment experience.  I prefer the backseat myself and always request that every time I go."
Disneyland,3aulo3,gdraper99,7,Tue Jun 23 17:27:35 2015 UTC,I love the backseat on Big Thunder. If I turn and watch the empty track from the back of the train I get that fun stomach drop feeling I used to get from going too high on the swings as a kid.

Disneyland,3auob3,SuperHotLarry,22,Tue Jun 23 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. The new parade has brought back the age old problem of people camping out for hours just to see a single show. It's not really possible to add ""Paint the Night Fastpass"", but I'd love it if there were some time, like say between 6PM and 7 PM, where curb campers on the parade route could be cleared out by cast members while they set up the ropes for the parade. Even if Disney completely manufactured a plausible reason for it, like bringing in extra benches, I absolutely hate how people just stretch out a blanket, and take over a full square meter of walking space on Main Street just so their kids can come back later and see the parade front and center without having to fight all the other parents with kids over it. Please Disney, put a text box on the park map, and a blurb in the parade description, and signs on Main Street, that remind guests not to camp out.  It can ruin the parade experience for tourists who may not know how early you're expected to camp out, and it creates this darwinian atmosphere where if you aren't a super dedicated fan, you don't deserve to see the show properly.  At least the 11 PM showing is much less crowded, but most of the good spots for the fireworks are also crowded areas for the parade route, so if you wait until the 11 PM showing, then first of all, your kids might be asleep through the whole thing, and second, you end up watching the fireworks from Tomorrowland where there's no music or projections.  Also, what happened to the choreography that was in the original World of Color? This new show is like watching a movie. Everything is on the water screens. All that the million dollar fountains do is dance around generically to a color palette that matches the scene on the water screens. It sucks."
Disneyland,3auob3,EagleEyeInTheSky,9,Tue Jun 23 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"No one reads anything though. When I worked there, people never read the signs and got mad that they got wet on Splash Mountain. No joke. Happened quite often, actually. Also, look how well the ""No selfie stick"" sign is working.   I hate it when people camp out too but I guess the only way to make sure that doesn't happen is fastpass. My SO who works in Guest Relations said people aren't allowed to save spots for people anynore but I don't know how they're going to implement that rule."
Disneyland,3auob3,TotoTheBunny,5,Tue Jun 23 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"I work GSO every once in a while. We let people ""save spots"" aka we don't bother them until about a half hour/hour before show time.

Disneyland,3auob3,ProtonDeathRay,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:31:15 2015 UTC,I don't understand. You want to move somebody's towel? Most people lay out a blanket and have one person remain while the rest of the party is adventuring. Then they should all be back about a half hour/hour before show time so they have a spot when everyone stands.

Disneyland,3auob3,ProtonDeathRay,15,Wed Jun 24 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"World of Color.  I just didn't like it. Its so boring compared to the old show. Sure its sweet that its a dedication to the park and to Walt. Especially Walt since people sometimes forget about him. But as a show it didn't work. It felt too much like a documentary/commercial. Almost like they were trying to tell everyone how great Disneyland is and how people should visit... but we already know how great it is... thats why we're there!  I felt the narration also slowed it down, people say it was what was missing from the old show, but I liked that the old show didn't need narration. For such a visually spectacular show, WoC doesn't need narration, at least not spoken. It needs more showing and less telling. Which is what the new one did wrong IMHO.  I saw it on the 24 Hour day, and the atmosphere during and after the show felt very nonchalant. As opposed to the hand full of other times I saw the old one where people were constantly singing, dancing, clapping and cheering. I fell in love with the old show, I was just so disappointed with Celebrate. :/  I hope they change it back to the old one soon. Maybe with a few tweaks, like adding the Star Wars portion to it."
Disneyland,3auob3,tenshi_73,5,Wed Jun 24 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with this. I miss the old WOC. The new one felt like a big commercial that was trying to convince me to go visit disneyland  because it's so great. The whole time I was just thinking ""I know how great disneyland is! I'm already here! I love this place"" and the show was just like ""look at all these happy families having fun! You should come have fun too!""  I liked that they had a bit of Walt in there but it wasn't much of a show it felt so slow and the narration really ruined some great moments. Just as it was picking up and had some great effect and music was going on it would be cut off by the narration.  The new one need a little less talking and a lot more color and music and awesomeness."
Disneyland,3auob3,reeuuk,0,Wed Jun 24 03:36:50 2015 UTC,"I really love the story that the new one told, of course the one before it was brilliant but this is just for the 60th celebration. And I love NPH, so this one just spoke to me."
Disneyland,3auob3,wyattrulesherp,5,Thu Jun 25 19:18:29 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100%. The new WOC show looks like something that would play as like a pre-show to the original WOC show. Like something that the people could watch as they were waiting for the show to start.
Disneyland,3auob3,wyattrulesherp,0,Wed Jun 24 04:57:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree 100%, I love the new show and it's dedication to Walt. Of course that isn't a show that should replace the old one, but as a tribute to Walt I think it was great and should stay for the year."

Also, I want to know who was the Pyromaniac who decided on the giant plume of fire. During a starfight, it's understandable. During a finale? Normal sized flames are alright.

Clarabelle's on Buena Vista Street has good dipped ice cream bars (vanilla or chocolate ice cream dipped in chocolate and then dipped in candy/toppings of your choice and served). If you're into soft serve Paradise Pier has good soft serve ice cream as well as floats.   Gibson Girl in DL is Dreyer's ice cream, pretty typical. Dole Whip by the Tiki Room is really good, both the soft serve and the pineapple juice floats.   Beignets are sold in New Orleans Square but I much prefer the ones from Ralph Brennan's Express in DTD.  Candy is also a favorite of mine, can be found on Main Street, Buena Vista Street, or Marceline's Confectionary in DTD. Fresh made candy and you can see them making them though the windows. I'm a sucker for the chocolate dipped pineapple skewers as well as the toffee. They have good chocolate/caramel apples as well.

It's usually pretty darn quiet, you get a great view of the Rivers of America, and it's probably the closest you can get to the train tracks without being at a station, so it's cool to see the train roll by.  An honorary mention goes to the benches under the Silly Symphony Swings, although that's not very quiet."

A lot of cats hang out there, and ducks will come up to you and eat out of your hand.  The area behind where they park the Columbia is nice too, but more and more people are starting to hang out there, so it's not quite as quiet any more.   The bridge on big thunder trail is really nice at dusk. I like to grab a bread bowl and feed the ducks and koi.   I think my all time favorite time and place to relax is at the mint julep bar right after rope drop. It's wonderful sitting in the cool morning air, sipping a mint julep and looking out over rivers of America without anyone else around."

If you want photos taken by a photographer from Disney like PhotoPass then they might see if there is someone available. They'll put it on a PhotoPass card and if they took a lot of photos, I would suggest getting them burned onto a CD ($70 bucks I think. I comes with the copyrights for the photos.)."

Here is my proposal story @ JonathanGin.com   I personally wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't at least one proposal each day in front of the castle. Maybe not that often but I'm sure it happens quite a bit.  Also they don't let you make custom watches any more but you can get a custom sketch done....

Disneyland,3ar9sd,howtoride2,6,Mon Jun 22 21:34:27 2015 UTC,"Disney is all about thrills < theming. For example, I wouldn't consider Tower of Terror half as scary if it had no theming and was a simple drop tower, like the ones at Cedar Fair or Six Flags parks. Space Mountain feels faster than it really is because it's indoors and it uses fans to simulate high speeds. So, Disney uses theme to their advantage. Other theme parks usually do not, and its the ride experience itself that really matters. So, comparisons between Six Flags rides and Disney rides are hard to make.  It all really depends on why you like Screamin, I guess. Even so, Screamin is pretty basic as far as coasters go. I can't say anything about non-Disney California theme parks because, as an eastern Canadian, I've never been to one, let alone Great America or Magic Mountain. Canada's Wonderland, Darien Lake, and Cedar Point are the roller coaster parking lots/amusement parks I frequent the most, so I guess they're the closest comparisons I have. I guess if you can handle drops and loops you should be okay with most sit-down roller coasters. I'd just recommend to watch out for older inverted coasters, since, as a roller coaster lover, I've had the most problems with those. They just bang your head around a lot. Just prepare yourself for different roller coaster types that Disney does not have (inverted, stand-up, flying etc)."
Disneyland,3ar9sd,Rarietty,3,Tue Jun 23 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"Take a look at ""Theme Park Review"" on YouTube. They have a ton of ride videos from different parks around the world. I'm sure they will have some of GA."
Disneyland,3ar9sd,Painbro,3,Tue Jun 23 15:38:58 2015 UTC,"They are very different parks.  Disney is about the theming above everything else.  They also try to make their rides accessible for people of all ages, so even their 'scary' rides aren't that extreme.  Great America, on the other hand, is focused on thrill rides with minimal theming.  You aren't there to pretend you're in your favorite movie, you're there to go fast and get turned upside down and shaken around before getting thrown into a free-fall.  GA's Demon is usually considered to be a pretty good starter coaster if you aren't sure if you like ""grown up"" thrill rides.  It goes upside down, but it's relatively smooth.  I'm personally terrified of roller coasters, but I can handle the Demon."
Disneyland,3ar9sd,angelcat00,6,Tue Jun 23 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"Beware: Demon is smooth in the sense that the track is pretty tame, but it's NOT a smooth ride. It's a headbanger for sure! Be prepared for neck pain if you ride more than once.   Honestly, the Great America coasters aren't that scary. Nothing on the level of Magic Mountain. Flight Deck has probably the most loops and inversions and it's an incredibly fast and smooth ride. If you enjoy Screamin you will enjoy the newer wooden coaster, it's really fast and has lots of bunny hills. When you go to Great America, ride one to see how it feels, and then most of the others are about the same thrill level.   But don't ride the stand up coaster. It's not fun and it hurts."
Disneyland,3ar9sd,Ambuhvee,3,Tue Jun 23 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"Do not ride the stand-up coaster.  Oh my lord, that was a terrible experience. I blame that ride for any future fertility problems I may have.   In regards to your question, OP, I think GA is an okay theme park. If your girlfriend is trying to get you to ""graduate"" to adult rides, then it's probably a good place to go because they have rides of all different thrill levels. I've only been once, but it was fairly recently (about a year and a half ago), and my favorite ride was the Gold Striker. It was really fast, and it reminded me of California Screamin'. So if you can handle that, I think you'll have a great time. :)"

That said, Disneyland is better than Great America in every way possible. I have an AP for Disneyland and will drive the 6-8 hours to Anaheim vs. the 10 minutes to Great America any day.

If it makes a swirl it's probably done on purpose. I agree it's less whip, and that sucks. But I don't think that stuff dispenses like soft serve from say Dairy Queen where it's pushed out in a thick glob. Talk to a Food Service manager? I did this once when I got really small, like half scoops of ice cream over at Gibson Girl. I mean, I asked for a scoop of mint n chip, and one of cookies and cream. I got 1/2 scoop of each. The guy looked at my ice cream, which I hadn't touch, compared it to my friend who had gone to a register next to me and agreed it was a lot smaller. I didn't want a new cone, I just pointed out the difference and mentioned that the portions should be consistent. He offered several times to refund me. It wasn't the point. I just felt someone should be made aware. Maybe that's the case here?"
Disneyland,3aogbv,Rider434,6,Mon Jun 22 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in a soft serve machine like this you have to actively try to not let it get the hollow center. This is just how it naturally comes out of the machine."

I started listening to them at about episode 40 or so, then immediately went back and started with episode 1.

Disneyland,3al45e,billy_c,2,Sun Jun 21 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"I had this feeling when he took his first break at the new year, something was up. He had started doing the Outside the Magic stuff to branch out, seemed way more interested in the haunted attraction and other such stuff, and the podcasts seemed to be getting shorter. That's ok, he is a cool and smart guy and he should do whatever makes him happy, but it bummed me as somebody who religiously listened to him weekly for years upon years"

Disneyland,3al45e,Babytrix,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:24:03 2015 UTC,DisGeek & Tales From The Mouse House are my fav. The Sweepspot and The Disneyland Gazette are pretty good as well. I use Podcast Addict on my android phone
Disneyland,3al45e,tjd2003,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Been a fan of Disney Dish for a while now (my favorite). Moustalgia is good, but tends to have week old news by the time they record (also a little more negative than I tend to enjoy). Gotta check out Tales from the Jungle Cruise and would recommend Podketeers. ""Three friends who love Disney, beer, and bacon"" was a bit difficult to pass up and while they ramble, they're a fun listen when there's a good topic. Just like listening to people talk about their strategy."

Disneyland,3aimrc,heyawildchild,2,Sun Jun 21 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, lets See:  Aurora, Jasmine, Ariel, Snow White, Tiana, Cinderella, Belle, Rapunzel, Merida, Pocahontas  are the ones I consider ""official"" princesses since they are all daughters of a King/Queen or have married a prince.   Disney officially counts Mulan as well but I don't think she fits the princess definition.  Other princesses that can be counted are: Sofia the First Anna (I would say Elsa but she is no longer a princess) Vanellope Von Schweetz Kiara (if we count Mermaids do we need to count animals)? Attina, Alana, Adella, Aquata, Arista, and Adriana (aka Ariel's sisters)  I'm sure there are a lot of other that could be listed as well depending on how broad of a definition you want to go."
Disneyland,3aimrc,Veearrsix,-1,Sun Jun 21 23:19:59 2015 UTC,Elsa isn't a princess. She's the queen.
Disneyland,3aimrc,Disbride,2,Sun Jun 21 04:28:59 2015 UTC,Can these be bought anywhere? Or are they strictly a give away item. I'd love one of these!
Disneyland,3akt4q,Ekkusu_x,3,Sun Jun 21 04:26:44 2015 UTC,Are these coke freestyle machines?
Disneyland,3akt4q,Boron17,6,Sun Jun 21 05:29:02 2015 UTC,"Had to look that name up, never used the official name for it before. Yes, they are the Freestyle machines."
Disneyland,3akt4q,SnarkMasterRay,7,Sun Jun 21 05:34:46 2015 UTC,"We've had them up in the Seattle area for a couple of years and I have two comments.  1) a one for one exchange will cause longer lines because the things take longer. People have more options so they sit there and think longer plus they have menus to wade through, as opposed to a single button/lever. There is also no chance to serve two people at once (say when you have a coke person and then a sprite person who can use the other side at the same time). When they double up and replace one with two it seems to be about the same during rushes. I hope they doubled up in DCA.  2) they're really cool when they open them up for service. Internally, the flavors are essentially in printer ink cartridges. Much easier and quicker than the old syrup bags we had when I worked fast food 20 years ago."
Disneyland,3akt4q,booboothechicken,2,Sun Jun 21 08:11:36 2015 UTC,"Mmmmm, printer ink sounds refreshing."
Disneyland,3akt4q,stevensokulski,7,Sun Jun 21 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping they don't, for two reasons.  First off, the mainstays taste way worse out of these machines. The Coke and Cherry Coke and others don't taste quite right.  And also, they take forever to dispense. This is entirely on the users, but places I got that have replaced their standard fountain with these entirely take way longer to get soda. I don't mend them when they're alongside a regular found though."
Disneyland,3akt4q,tideblue,2,Mon Jun 22 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"The classic ""Coke"" option is it's own cartridge, usually the largest one as it's the most popular flavor. Any flavored-Coke option is actually mixed with the Coke Zero cartridge. Machines will make Cherry Coke with cherry flavor and Coke Zero.  Edit: By the way, the flavored Sprite choices mix the best, imo."
Disneyland,3akt4q,stevensokulski,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"Woah... So when you get a Cherry Coke at a Freestyle machine you are really getting a Cherry Coke Zero? That's weak...  I feel like I'd have to do a side by side comparison to see if it rings true, but the Coke mix has never felt quite ""right"" to me on the Freestyle. Seemed odd too, given how much more control they have over fluid control in those machines vs. traditional fountains."
Disneyland,3akt4q,stevensokulski,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:01:54 2015 UTC,And I definitely agree on the Sprite choices. They are some of the best.
Disneyland,3akt4q,penguin4thewin,2,Thu Jun 25 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"I hope so! I'm diabetic, so the huge variety of diet drinks is awesome. Maybe next to the regular machines? Or not in super high traffic areas?"
Disneyland,3akt4q,billypowergamer,3,Thu Jun 25 21:46:30 2015 UTC,this sounds like the one at whitewater snacks in the grand californian.  if this is the case then i have more places to get that delicious orange vanilla fanta
Disneyland,3akt4q,Pezto,7,Mon Jun 22 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"Ugh, not excited about this addition. In my opinion, Freestyle machines are the worst. I used to think they were cool and futuristic. In reality, they take longer to use for people since they are new and there is a learning curve. Plus, all of the syrups come out of the same nozzle. You end up with mixed flavors when all you wanted was one. I hope these are only a fad."
Disneyland,3akt4q,iSkelly87,3,Sun Jun 21 20:58:08 2015 UTC,I don't know why you are being down voted. I agree with you. The soda that comes out of these machines is really gross. I always find myself helping either a kid that can nor figure it out/reach it or someone that just doesn't get it. Which is fine I like helping the biggest issue is the taste of the soda is sacrificed for more flavors.
Disneyland,3akt4q,Pezto,2,Sun Jun 21 23:08:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for agreeing! Haha. I think these machines would be pretty sick if the flavors were kept true. Hopefully Coca-Cola updates them in the future...
Disneyland,3akt4q,iSkelly87,2,Mon Jun 22 04:24:26 2015 UTC,"I hope so too. I was really excited about them at first, but after tasting the soda I was really disappointed."
Disneyland,3akt4q,Huskerfan212,3,Mon Jun 22 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you've tried, but just a friendly suggestion (no harm in trying!) I usually choose my drink and hold the button for 2-3 seconds without my cup under it, then put my cup under it to kind of flush out the flavor previous guests had."
Disneyland,3akt4q,iSkelly87,2,Mon Jun 22 05:02:07 2015 UTC,This is an essential trick for these types of machines. It does help the taste of the soda.

Disneyland,3ajp1b,TomBad87,9,Sat Jun 20 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Paradise Pier is a solid hotel. It has Disney touches, but not really the themeing most Disney Hotels have. It is still a very nice hotel. We stayed in standard rooms and the beds were comfy and the bath tub was amazing. Super deep.  Getting to the parks is fine. Do NOT follow the signs. Leave the hotel through the front door, take a left towards the intersection. Cross the street to the Grand Californian entrance. Once inside hang a left and follow the signs to DTD or walk straight through and follow signs to DCA special entrance. Do walk around to the public entrance for DCA if you are doing early entry, much faster as their are only a few cast members at hotel entry and only hotel guests can enter at this time anyway.  I haven't stayed at the Club level but have been researching it. The hours are shorter than those at the GCH (and possibly DLH) but the offerings are similar. From what I gathered this was what was on offer:   Morning: basic pastries, cold cereals, fruits Afternoon: fruit, uncrustables sandwhiches, chips Evening: one hot appetizer (changes every night), cheese tray, desserts All day: bottled waters, sodas, juices   Additionally the rooms have DVD players and you can borrow movies from the concierge desk. There are 3rd floor level rooms that have patios that have gates leading to the pool area. The rest of the floors are the top levels of the hotel. There is a special elevator for concierge desks that can only be called up to concierge level floors. This is handy as there (allegedly) can be a bit of a wait for an elevator first thing in the morning. We never experienced that.  Pool was very nice, but no themeing. It was very well staffed and on the smaller side so I was happy to let my eight year old swim while I watched from the side. The water slide is separate from the pool and staffed by two lifeguards. Didn't get a chance to try the bar as we traveled in the spring and it wasn't open on weekdays at that time.  We did not eat at the regular restaurant but we did attend the Surf's Up breakfast with Mickey. The character experience was great and we met Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Stitch, and Pluto. The food was okay for a buffet. Certainly not worth the price alone, but fine with the added value of the characters.   If you have any further questions I would be happy to help. I may have some pictures of some things as well if you are interested."
Disneyland,3ajp1b,MeishkaD,2,Sun Jun 21 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"This is great! Thanks for sharing all of your research. The consensus seems to be NOT to follow the signs, and I am glad I know that now. The lack of theming in the pool area is about what I expected, wasn't PPH a different hotel once upon a time? I suppose you can only do so much without tearing everything down. I have heard the character breakfast is pretty fun, good to hear confirmation of that. I did Goofy's Kitchen last time with my niece, but this time itll just be me and the wife so probably skipping out on that one.  Thanks again, this rocks. I will be sharing all of this with my wife :)"
Disneyland,3ajp1b,MeishkaD,2,Sun Jun 21 13:31:55 2015 UTC,"Paradise Pier was orginially the Pan Pacific Hotel and was owned by a different company. So Disney purchased it in the late 90s and applied themeing over the top of what was already there.   If you are traveling with just your wife and looking for a tasty grown  up breakfast, my favorite blogger wrote a really positive review of Steakhouse 55. Usually he says there is zero point in eating any breakfast at the parks (unless you are looking for a charecter experience), this was one of his few exceptions. It is located on the Disneyland Hotel property, so I believe this is a rare case where you would want to follow the signage."

The hotel was originally built and owned by Japan-based Tokyu Group, and opened in 1984 as the Emerald of Anaheim. It was renamed Pan Pacific Hotel, Anaheim in 1989 when Tokyu merged its Emerald and Pan Pacific hotel divisions. Disney purchased the hotel from Tokyu in 1995 and renamed it Disneyland Pacific Hotel. The hotel was rebranded as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel on December 15, 2000, named after the waterfront land in Disney California Adventure Park that the hotel tower overlooks.

Disneyland,3ajp1b,hereit_goes,5,Sun Jun 21 19:36:19 2015 UTC,"PPH is actually a shorter walk to DCA than the Frontier Tower, so in some ways it's kind of in the middle. Definitely not prime location, but it's seconds away from GCH which is convenient to both parks.  The schedule for PPH's Concierge is: 6:30 - 10: Continental Breakfast 10-5: Snacks, usually cookies, chips, etc. 5-7: Beer, wine, cheese trays, finger food, etc. 7-8: Nighttime snacks, like chocolate, more cookies, etc. DLH and GCH lounges are open longer but honestly if you can get PPH Club for less than DLH Standard it may be worth it.  The Concierge CMs can help you with dining reservations, in-park questions, etc."

Disneyland,3afud4,arobotamongus,15,Fri Jun 19 21:25:20 2015 UTC,I was so happy on my recent visit. Went on the train and saw that the whole Steg was moving and so was the T-rex. It's such a rarity now for both of them to be working at the same time. ;w;
Disneyland,3afud4,Ekkusu_x,8,Fri Jun 19 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"When we went a few months back, it was covered for renovations. To make up for it, one of the cast members narrated the entire scene for us! He did such an amazing job and was really entertaining."
Disneyland,3afud4,MacArthurParker,10,Sat Jun 20 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"This has always been one of my favorite things at Disneyland, riding the train for the Primeval World diorama is nearly always on the list of things to do on my visits. I was so shocked that my BF had no idea it was even there when we went together and I got him on the train for the first time. He hadn't been to the parks in years but I was still stunned he had no idea it was there at all, he thought it was super cool, so I made sure we took a full train ride around so he wouldn't miss the Splash Mountain section either. I absolutely love riding the train."

My boyfriend and I were talking about Disney things we'd never done, and riding the train all the way around the park was one of them. It was such a surprise for us seeing the diorama, and a really fun memory for us. It's so cool how a place I've gone to all my life can still have surprises in it!"

I always try to get on the train whenever I'm there."

However, considering the fact that it is roughly 40 years old technology it's still quite engaging and endearing. My eight year old loved it when we visited this spring.  Also, this is my grandmother's main memory of Disneyland as when they took my uncle it was all he wanted to do all day. Ride the train and see the baby dinosaurs. He was two."

Disneyland,3afud4,garygnu,4,Sat Jun 20 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest here, and it's apparently not a popular opinion here. I think the entire Grand Canyon and Primeval World is an embarrassment.    It's one of the few places in the entire park where Disneyland shows its age in a very bad way. It's clearly  from the 1960s and not the nostalgia inducing version. Except for the scale of the whole thing, it looks like a county fair exhibit from twenty years ago. Rudimentary animatronics, bad taxidermy, outdated science... it makes me shudder.   I look at the modern stuff, modern marvels like Buzz and Potato Head, to even Lincoln and Pirates. The coyotes and T-Rex and friends seem like hamster wheels connected to pulleys in comparison. I know the Imagineers could update the whole diorama and blow people's minds. Walt didn't want Disneyland to be stuck in time, he ""plussed"" rides himself and talked about how we must never let it be finished. Let's keep moving forward with this last remnant of a time when a deer or gallomimus moving is head back and forth was a technological wonder."

Disneyland,3aghjj,Ghost00,6,Sat Jun 20 06:37:18 2015 UTC,Its my favorite. I do it every time when I go on it.  I normally do it by turning my body and following it as long as I can.  Does it work better by keeping your body straight and just turning your head?
Disneyland,3aghjj,The_Doogenhammer,3,Sat Jun 20 07:39:51 2015 UTC,"I try to turn my whole body, it feels more intense than just turning your head. I do it for almost the entire ride and I always face towards the right"

Disneyland,3af1g6,Romiress,13,Fri Jun 19 23:55:49 2015 UTC,"People... It may have been ride safety systems but by and large it seems that in most cases the root issue is a guest that does something which compromises the safe operation of the attraction and consequently the operator has to E-Stop the attraction. Then the passengers need to be walked off the ride and the ride system needs to reset. That's a process that can take up to an hour, or even longer in some cases.  And it seems that guest usage of selfie sticks during the ride is the main cause for E-Stops recently, which is why the ""No Selfie Sticks"" signs have been going up around the resort."

My trick is to go to the stairwell between the top level and the second highest level where it juts out so the terrace structure doesn't obstruct your view of the sky.  And for the 4th of July, I don't think they will run DL Forever. Probably just Celebrate America.   But if you are intending to see DL Forever, seeing it from outside the park won't do it justice. It's not spectacular due to the pyro (It's like all the other fireworks shows), but instead the projection mapping inside the park which creates an immersive experience and makes this show stand out."

Disneyland,3af17k,Mattiebonez,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:05:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything at WDW is planned 6 months out. It's pretty crazy. Dining reservations are 6 months out, so are (tentative) park hours. So you gotta figure out where you're going to be in December sometime in July.   I suppose it makes sense with it being such a big place, and there being that much more competition for choice dining times/locations (Be Our Guest Dinner books out at six months, no problem). Even fastpass+ is booked.... 60 days in advance I think? If you're staying onsite, at least.  Either way, pros and cons on both coasts. Disney World's system is great for people who like to plan everything and have all of it to look forward too, while Disneyland's system is more catered to locals and passholders. Personally, I'm glad I can't make dining reservations at Disneyland until 60 days out, but I'm sort of concerned that park hours aren't posted until 45 days out."

Disneyland,3ach3l,GamingCenterCX,-8,Fri Jun 19 05:54:55 2015 UTC,"I experienced the original ""Captain EO"" in 1983. MY SO and I found it cringeworthy and horrifying, a creepy stupid sop honoring a superstar; this kind of celebrity fetishism (we thought) was out of sorts with the rest of Disneyland. I am of the generation that grew up with both Disneyland and MJ. I liked the Jackson 5, but absolutely loathed and found ridiculous the music of MJ's hugely successful solo career. I cringed with shame hearing ""Thriller,"" ""Beat It,"" etc. ""Captain EO"" felt literally offensive to me."

Disneyland,3abav1,MeishkaD,6,Thu Jun 18 18:33:03 2015 UTC,I am so sad we missed out on this on our last trip. Looking forward to hitting it next time. Do you think it would hold a toddler's attention or would it be better to do when we split up into smaller groups?
Disneyland,3abav1,MeishkaD,4,Thu Jun 18 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I wish I could give you a better answer but I'm not sure! Sometimes there's a lot going on at once, which may hold their attention for a bit. I'm not sure how old the kid is, but if they can understand jokes, they'll love the humor as well. Overall, the show lasts around 45 minutes and you'll love every bit of it once you get the chance to see it!"
Disneyland,3abav1,MeishkaD,2,Thu Jun 18 23:43:20 2015 UTC,Hmm... that would be a bit long for wiggly toddlers. My eldest is eight so I think we will try and catch that while the little ones are back at the hotel napping. Spouse creature and I are hoping to take turns each day with one of us resting at the hotel post afternoon swim with the smaller kids while the other heads back into the park with the eight year old.

Planning is almost as much fun as being at the parks. Almost."

Anyone know?"

Disneyland,3ab1sh,thatcaveman,24,Thu Jun 18 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"This happens periodically when the grip is a little too slippery. If you look to the right before the lift, there is a small office where they monitor the boats going up. There is nothing to worry about since there are mechanisms every 5-8 feet that lock and catch the boat going backwards if it were to fall."
Disneyland,3ab1sh,Pezto,6,Thu Jun 18 18:07:22 2015 UTC,"It was weird though, we must have been sliding back along the locks for a good three seconds. Then we went up and slid back along another lock again just before getting up to the top."
Disneyland,3ab1sh,ThrowawayDLR,6,Thu Jun 18 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind that the ride control system ""knows"" where the logs are and where they're supposed to be at any given time, so if your log doesn't make it to a specific point within a specific time period, the ride will initiate an automatic emergency stop. Sensors are also capable of detecting reverse movement that's outside a specific threshold, which would also cause an automatic emergency stop.   I promise you, and the millions of other guests who have ridden Splash, are completely safe."
Disneyland,3ab1sh,ThrowawayDLR,-1,Thu Jun 18 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"It was just weird, because I've been on Splash Mountain a lot and I've never had this happen. Having the log ahead of us do the same thing, something just seemed off. Also being that the ride went down when we first were in line set off another red flag. Weird."
Disneyland,3ab1sh,ephdisc,3,Thu Jun 18 21:33:56 2015 UTC,"The ride going down likely had nothing to do with the lift or the perceived sliding backwards. If there was something seriously wrong with it, the ride wouldn't have reopened or would have, as I said earlier, shut itself down."

Disneyland,3ab1sh,fernker,2,Sun Jun 21 08:13:12 2015 UTC,Very strange. It definitely sounds like the grip and maybe the weight of the log had something to do with it. They are definitely looking into the issue.
Disneyland,3aacrp,Ghost00,7,Thu Jun 18 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"I saw it once when it was brought back to California Adventure. I did like it. But I knew it was outdated. It was nice of Disney to bring it back for a while.  I believe it's in a museum now. I also like the small references in Paint the Night kinda teasing me oh, this was kinda like the old lady bug float. Maybe I'm crazy haha."
Disneyland,3aacrp,kelsey0403,3,Thu Jun 18 21:11:01 2015 UTC,"Unless they're using different floats, last I checked it was still at WDW. From the looks of it, the parade flitted back and forth between the two coasts for decades, so I assumed they used the same floats."
Disneyland,3aacrp,karibear909,3,Fri Jun 19 16:55:34 2015 UTC,Is one of the new parades a revamp of the electrical parade?
Disneyland,3aacrp,cpt-cam,5,Thu Jun 18 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"It's called Paint the Night, and from what I can gather (won't get to see it in person until November) it's more of a spiritual successor. :)"

Granted, you are working with individuals and not established hotels so they can sometimes be unresponsive and stuff, but the value you can find is unbeatable. For the same price I used to pay for a room at the Motel 8, I got to rent some guy's super nice apartment with a pool, gym, and lounge (pool, shuffle board, etc.) in the complex for us to use."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,failbears,3,Thu Jun 18 18:44:37 2015 UTC,Is that like home share?  Are you responsible for cleaning up? Or is there maid service?
Disneyland,3ab4w1,failbears,2,Thu Jun 18 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"I've actually used it only once so I'm not an expert, but it seems you just come to an understanding with the owner. We didn't make much of a mess anyway, so when we left we pretty much packed our things and left it the way we found it."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,Frodoholic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"You're usually not responsible for cleaning up per se, but since it's someone's home, it's kinda a courtesy not to leave a huge mess. You can rent out someone's entire home, or just a bedroom in their home. Sometimes it's hit or miss though. Check out the reviews on the page and see if it's something that will work for you."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,bubblesugarsocks,2,Fri Jun 19 19:21:59 2015 UTC,I've looked at that in the past but everything seemed kind of a ways from the park. maybe I'll look into it again.
Disneyland,3ab4w1,failbears,2,Thu Jun 18 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you have to book well in advance to find a place super close to the park during peak visitor months, but we had rented a car anyway because we were traveling to different places."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,polyaphrodite,2,Thu Jun 18 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"Only downside to Airbnb are those who are using the timeshares (Worldmark) for listings.... my partner works in the Customer service side of Airbnb and I'm a worldmark owner... Neither company gives clear OK for the timeshares to be used this way and there is a risk of rejection (there are crackdowns of listings in different areas...airbnb usually refunds both guest and owner but it would be a hassle during the vacation).  However, there are some nice homes in the area (we are looking for early oct and the timeshares are booked) that are great alternatives.  Airbnb is a service connecting Hosts (those with properties) to guests (those looking to rent). It's not a hotel service. Responsibilities and amenities are listed by location or discussed with the owners..... think of a dating service but for a place to stay."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,fictionjunkie,4,Thu Jun 18 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"We just stayed at the Best Western plus Anaheim Inn. The beds were comfortable, room wasn't huge but there's a hot breakfast (eggs, a meat, terrible waffles), plus toast, bagels, cereal etc. It's only a ten minute walk to the main gate. The rate was $149 per night. Pool isn't huge but it was good enough for the kid (and us). Would certainly consider staying there again. Think there's another BW a little closer to the gate that wasn't much more."

Disneyland,3ab4w1,bubblesugarsocks,4,Thu Jun 18 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to drive 10-15 minutes, Quality Inn in Placentia is great. I've stayed there in my recent trip in June, and before in December. Its half the cost of hotels in Anaheim. There is plenty of free parking, free breakfast from 7am - 10am, the rooms are really clean, and the beds are comfortable. Only downsides are the ac units are a bit old and loud, and the wifi is a little slow.  You can pretty much take city streets all the way to Mickey & Friends Parking structure."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,Kierz10TheRaven,2,Thu Jun 18 19:32:00 2015 UTC,We haven't decided if we are going to drive or fly yet. If we drive we could do further from the park. But paying parking will suck a little.  Thanks
Disneyland,3ab4w1,MeishkaD,4,Thu Jun 18 19:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, paying for parking sucks, it $17/day now. However I was paying $77-$95 a night when I recently went (weekends were a little more pricey), compared to some places within walking distance of the park that were $150-$250 a night. So in the end, even paying for parking you save money."
Disneyland,3ab4w1,epotosi,3,Thu Jun 18 19:59:22 2015 UTC,"I always stay in Buena Park hotels, there is usually a $20-30 difference in price from anything nearer to the park. The last hotel I stayed at was the Good Nite Inn. It didn't serve breakfast, but it was very inexpensive for the quality of service. It was a 5-10 minute drive every morning to the parking structure and I believe they have a shuttle."

Disneyland,3a7uiy,totts1,6,Fri Jun 19 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"so if i'm looking at this correctly, the ride goes underneath the railroad? that's pretty sweet."
Disneyland,3a7uiy,hello_josh,6,Thu Jun 18 05:19:40 2015 UTC,"Several attractions do. The Haunted Mansion, Pirates, The Indy Queue, Splash, Pooh, and a Small World."
Disneyland,3a7uiy,inio,5,Thu Jun 18 08:19:40 2015 UTC,splash is the only one i knew about since it's obvious from the railroad. before seeing this pic i never really thought about it. mind = blown
Disneyland,3a7uiy,doktortaru,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:54:01 2015 UTC,Does Pooh travel under the tracks? I thought the whole ride was constructed on the far side of the tracks.
Disneyland,3a7uiy,inio,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:40:49 2015 UTC,It might be actually. I just know it's super close about a story below so I included it.
Disneyland,3a7uiy,stevensokulski,3,Fri Jun 19 01:35:01 2015 UTC,Loooooong ago I had a map that showed all this shit. But that was the 70s...
Disneyland,3a7uiy,inio,2,Thu Jun 18 17:55:04 2015 UTC,Really cool. Would've never guessed it was split into separate buildings.
Disneyland,3a7uiy,cardassian_tailor,2,Thu Jun 18 02:13:05 2015 UTC,This is really cool. I'd love to see more if make them!
Disneyland,3a7uiy,charliewonders,2,Thu Jun 18 02:52:40 2015 UTC,Anyone know what the low overhead segment just before the last scene (gunfight) and uphill is for? Walkway from the New Orleans Square basements/kitchen to the Blue Bayou elevator maybe?  Also: do the same thing for the Indy queue!
Disneyland,3a7uiy,Ekkusu_x,3,Thu Jun 18 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"That's to bring you back to the front building!  If you look at the picture you'll notice that there are two tunnels going through the middle part between buildings: one is the cave with the mist screen, the other one is precisely the section you talk about! :)"
Disneyland,3a7uiy,AmberHeartsDisney,2,Thu Jun 18 04:58:27 2015 UTC,That narrow section exists because the ride has to go under the railroad!
Disneyland,3a7uiy,glitterwrists,2,Thu Jun 18 05:46:10 2015 UTC,"The railroad is just past the Jail.  I'm talking about the conspicuously low ceiling about 60ft past that, at the transition between burning building and gunfight.  I'm trying to think if there's a matching low ceiling past the treasure room... Not sure there is.   Oh, interesting thing to note: the sloped ceiling over Hurricane Lagoon and the Crew's Quarters is the underside of the uphill."
Disneyland,3a7uiy,MaLaCoiD,2,Thu Jun 18 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yeap, there is. It's the narrow tunnel just before the ship battling with the fort, where they project Davy Jones on a mist screen."
Disneyland,3a7uiy,stacasaurusrex,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:02:49 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the area with the burning beams just overhead, and the chair that looks as though its about to drop into your boat?  I'd always thought this was where the train passed overhead? Or are we already past the train by that point?"

Disneyland,3a90rw,blackseat,2,Thu Jun 18 08:30:36 2015 UTC,"It's this map  It took me a few hours to put it together since you can't direct download it. My original was over 70 inch wide, but no one prints that large unless I have $$$$. I had to crop it, but I happy with the results."

Disneyland,3a9fal,ChetsWorthFonzo,2,Thu Jun 18 09:37:39 2015 UTC,Do you think that I would not be able to get a wristband if I get there in 40 minutes (on my way there)?
Disneyland,3a9fal,craz3dhulk,5,Thu Jun 18 09:53:14 2015 UTC,Maybe a pin release tomorrow?
Disneyland,3a9fal,dodgepodge,4,Thu Jun 18 08:57:49 2015 UTC,You may be right! I found this on the pin trading blog.  Looks like a new 60th pin comes out today.
Disneyland,3a9fal,Ferniekicksbutt,5,Thu Jun 18 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah this is insane!  Every time the amount of people just gets bigger and bigger.  It started with no one even knowing about them,  then second pin sold out early morning.  Third pin there was an overflow line at like 7am. Then around 6 am.  Then around 5am......right now I got here at 2:30 am and apparently I might not get one lol! !!"
Disneyland,3a9fal,ranoutofbacon,4,Thu Jun 18 10:23:25 2015 UTC,I guess we'll see new pins on eBay tomorrow for $80
Disneyland,3a9fal,karibear909,3,Thu Jun 18 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"They were already up there for that much. Made me feel really bad when that pin is one of the things I asked for from my Disney secret Santa (just in case they were from California and go to Disneyland or something) at the time I had no idea the pins were going for that much now, or I wouldn't have asked."

Disneyland,3a9fal,foxhound-mgs,2,Thu Jun 18 09:23:16 2015 UTC,Why cant Disney sell them online to the people that cant be there because they have to work early in tje morning?  They would still generate alot of money selling online.
Disneyland,3a9fal,trisity,7,Thu Jun 18 11:52:55 2015 UTC,It's limited edition and the scripted bots would get 90% of them for upselling elsewhere
Disneyland,3a9fal,karibear909,5,Thu Jun 18 12:42:06 2015 UTC,"Have you looked on eBay? People already have listings for this pin up, charging at least $75 bucks for it. I get the whole, Hey that's capitalism for you, but it just makes me sad that people who really want the pin, probably won't be able to get it."
Disneyland,3a9fal,MaLaCoiD,3,Thu Jun 18 13:23:02 2015 UTC,They'll be able to get it... for a premium.
Disneyland,3a9fal,MrPoppagergio,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if someone really wants it (like me) and can't make it to the release then the alternative it to purchase it off eBay.   Imagine if every person who made it planned on keeping it for themselves, then no one who couldn't attend would get one."
Disneyland,3a9fal,Ekkusu_x,0,Sat Jun 20 00:12:54 2015 UTC,I warned them. Everyone warned them. Letting people just sit/opening the gates to let them park before correct hours would condone this behavior.  Did Disney listen? Nooooope.

Disney California Adventure has also had its own thing going and the park is more beautiful than ever before!  You have to be here and join the celebration man its unique, it's fantastic, it's MAGICAL!  The only con for me is the crowds lol those have increased too :O bit still manageable."

Disneyland,3a5tfp,golf4miami,3,Fri Jun 19 07:40:04 2015 UTC,Why did they have to up their prices? At the old price I probably would have gotten on since I love the Jungle Cruise so much. But $28 plus shipping is WAY too much. Especially since I won't get it for a couple months.
Disneyland,3a5tfp,champion_dave,3,Wed Jun 17 15:13:46 2015 UTC,To ship here to Canada it's $28. Unbelievable.
Disneyland,3a5tfp,golf4miami,2,Wed Jun 17 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yea I think including shipping it would have been around $35 total for me in Ohio. I've bought many limited edition shirts from them this way, but I think after seeing the price go up I might just stay away."

I went to DTD last night and WoD didn't have them or know anything about them.  Couldn't go into the park because SoCal APs were blocked (Grad Nites I assume).  So went home empty handed.  Nice walk though.  :-)"
Disneyland,3a6o2e,YerAverageBear,25,Wed Jun 17 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"1) Had that in the past. Was removed because assholes would walk through with a purse or fanny pack or something and refuse to stop because it ""wasn't a bag"", so I heard.   2) I think this would be cool, but I don't think Disney wants to make it look like anyone - one time visitor or oassholder - is getting special treatment. Even if it's just a quick hassle free line to get in.. Would be nice."
Disneyland,3a6o2e,fantasialopez,11,Thu Jun 18 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"In theory that would be great! But I think if they were to implement those types of lines, people would still try to go through the 'wrong' line because someone in their party fits the criteria to go through one, if that makes sense. Like a season pass holder may bring a friend who only has a single day pass, but both would try to go through the pass holder line because they don't want to split up."
Disneyland,3a6o2e,bubblesugarsocks,3,Thu Jun 18 05:02:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they do sometimes, or they did some of the days of my last trip (a few weeks ago), but other days the same week they didn't. I think it may just depend on who is working. Someone would just step aside and yell ""No bags? No bags?"" and wave you through."
Disneyland,3a6o2e,thatcaveman,3,Thu Jun 18 17:36:06 2015 UTC,Loved the no bag line at Disneyworld (they still have it). I still can't see why they got rid of it at Disneyland.

Disneyland,3a6m7f,cpt-cam,2,Wed Jun 17 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"Space mountain isn't down for long. It usually closes on the 1st or 2nd of November, and the overlay takes 3 to 5 days to take down. So you should be able to catch space mountain towards the end of your visit.  Last year I think small world opened up on November 13th with the holiday overlay, which takes around 2 weeks to put up if I'm not mistaken. Small world may be closed while you're there.  Unfortunately Disneyland doesn't put out much information on the holiday season until after summer is over."
Disneyland,3a6m7f,Disneyland_Pimp,2,Fri Jun 19 07:26:17 2015 UTC,"Can't say for sure since I've never been during that time, but last year I went from October 18-24 and they had closed down Small World I think on the 20th.  Sometime during our trip at least.  Not sure how long it was down for, but they close it before halloween."
Disneyland,3a6m7f,wilybobcat,2,Fri Jun 19 08:18:49 2015 UTC,"I went on my Honeymoon in the same time period 2 years ago so I'll do my best to tell you how it was by the 7th or so.   First a disclaimer: This year being the 60th I have no clue how the decorations are going to work. Right now there are royal blue banners all over the park and the castle is covered in diamonds. I don't know if they plan to take some of this down around Halloween or if they plan to leave it up through the holiday seasons (someone who was around during the 50th may be able to explain what they did during that celebration).   By the time we arrived at the park (either Nov 7th or 8th) Halloween was gone, Main Street was in full christmas mode because that was the weekend they filmed the Christmas Parade special.   Some of the Christmas stuff was up in the rest of the park but not all of it (usually the official kick off the the holidays is the following week or so). Snow is put on the castle during the halloween celebration so it should be there (if it's going up this year).   The winter parade and fireworks also start that weekend usually.   Space Mountain was up and running with no overlay by the time we arrived and Small World was up but the overlay had not gone up yet (although i can't remember if the facade had been decorated at that point).   In DCA I know the christmas decorations were all over Cars land.   I know you are going the week before this but hopefully you have an idea of where things should be by the end of your visit!"

Disneyland,3a5vf4,jerseyneighbor,7,Wed Jun 17 13:52:51 2015 UTC,"People plan for Disney World vacations much father out than Disneyland. For a Disneyland trip, for the most part, you don't need to plan that far ahead, and this way Disneyland has more time to change schedules. It gives them more time to book the Tomorrowland Terrace, more time to adjust for upcoming conventions and special events, and less warning required to add or remove attractions and shows.  It's a logistical tradeoff."
Disneyland,3a5vf4,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Wed Jun 17 14:39:57 2015 UTC,"A large portion of the Disney World audience is guests that travel from across/outside the country. Planning is much more critical.

Disneyland,3a25fv,XirdenStone,2,Wed Jun 17 01:10:46 2015 UTC,Cute picture! Congratulations! :)
Disneyland,3a6isq,13goingon30,3,Wed Jun 17 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"Well, the 50th had a massive ceremony that made the carpet of people all down Mainstreet. (Seriously, shoulder to shoulder carpet.) They had a few TV projectors and such for those who couldn't see the castle front. After that they let everyone enjoy the rest of the day as normal. The only SPECIAL things they had that day were the new Parade/Fireworks and various merchandise things. Also, those who got in at park opening time got a pair of Golden 50 Mickey ears. Oh, and the Golden Ride vehicles.  But it's still a factor of 'Holiday Crowds' which means that, unless you get there at park opening, you'll have a far off in the boonies parking and have to wait for them to open the gates after some people have left.  The panic I have is that I talked to a few Cast Members out of park (We were waiting for an Amiibo release) that told me the upper management had an idea to make yet ANOTHER 24 hour event for the 17th. Which means that nobody but the people who decide to waste 10+ hours of their life waiting in line beforehand will be able to enjoy the park's official 60th birthday. Which I hope will not be a factor since I'd actually like to enjoy the ability to enter the park at any time and just fight through the crowd instead of having to be held up behind the bag check line..."
Disneyland,3a6isq,Ekkusu_x,3,Thu Jun 18 17:32:18 2015 UTC,Ahhh. I see. So it's POSSIBLE they may open 24 hours on July 17th. Thanks for the info! We are so excited to work and just hope we can make the most of our time!
Disneyland,3a6isq,kingubneo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Disneyland events,the only thing crazier than amiibo releases tbh"
Disneyland,3a6isq,cpt-cam,2,Sat Jun 20 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"There's another post with a discussion going on here  The general consensus is that nobody knows yet, but that it will probably be packed and something will happen."
Disneyland,3a3zuq,slverstone,5,Wed Jun 17 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"I strongly suspect that it will be a capacity crowd on the 17th, and that there will be loads of activities planned for the 60th Anniversary date. The DL calendar is very quiet on any special events on the anniversary date.  Although the Park is open from 8 AM to Midnight.  There have been loads of rumors, but nothing officially announced as of yet.   The Paint the night parade and DL forever fireworks should be outstanding.     the office"
Disneyland,3a3zuq,valiamo,2,Wed Jun 17 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"oh I expect it to be packed.At the 50th, they has people camping out overnight in DCA. There was a big to-do about it and while 60th isn't as big of a big as say the 75th will be... I am expecting something that day!  All I know is that I will be there!"
Disneyland,3a3zuq,stormeegedon,2,Wed Jun 17 08:06:18 2015 UTC,"What's your opinion as far as capacity goes. On the 24 hour event this year, people were still coming into the park at 10:30am. I camped out for the 50th, but as I am old (26 lol) I would rather avoid doing that. Do you think the 24 hour event will be a bigger draw, or do you think we would be fine to get there at like 8am and be fine as far as entry goes?"
Disneyland,3a3zuq,dodgepodge,2,Wed Jun 17 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely yes. Not sure what, but there's definitely going to be something."

Disneyland,3a3zuq,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,2,Wed Jun 17 12:54:39 2015 UTC,Nothing so far. And nothing announced for July Fourth either.
Disneyland,3a3zuq,kethryvis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:34:31 2015 UTC,"i talked to a Cast Member last weekend who told me that all cast members working on the 17th will be swapping all pins on their lanyards out for special, limited edition Hidden Mickeys that will ONLY be available that one day.  Take that as you will.  He also told me that after the 17th, both sets of Hidden Mickey pins (A set and B set) will be releasing in rapid succession; they held back all the new pins in the run-up to the 60th."
Disneyland,3a7ruk,MatchGuy,7,Wed Jun 17 22:06:16 2015 UTC,Would not recommend going through a third party for tickets. Nothing is worse than going to the gates only to be denied entry because multi-day park hoppers are not transferrable. Discounts are hard to come by unless one of the members of the party is military (which has the best discount by far).
Disneyland,3a7ruk,thatcaveman,8,Thu Jun 18 03:11:58 2015 UTC,Bring a refillable water bottle and bring your own snacks/lunch.
Disneyland,3a7ruk,Em3PO,4,Thu Jun 18 02:50:31 2015 UTC,"Really dont think there are any other options. My dad has a discount through his insurance, but its only $16 dollars off your ticket. I also have one through my job, but that one is only $15.  If you have insurance try checking to see if you have a discount. But I think most are only $10-$15 off"
Disneyland,3a7ruk,tenshi_73,3,Thu Jun 18 08:10:26 2015 UTC,"The Chicken Dinner at the Plaza Inn can serve two people. If you don't get into a bicker about who gets what piece.  Also, you get a good view of the Fireworks/parade. An added bonus if you go eat for dinner. (But get there about 1-2 hours early and just enjoy the table via soda/small items.)"

Disneyland,3a4c5n,ibeckman671,8,Wed Jun 17 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"They sell them in the park for newlywed's, and whoever else wants to wear them.     Probably more fun to get them in the park than ordering them on Amazon, easier to pack them going home, than to bring them with you on your honeymoon.  Always fun to see them around the park and the happy couple wearing the hats and the ""just married"" or ""Happy Anniversary"" badges."
Disneyland,3a4c5n,valiamo,6,Wed Jun 17 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Buy them in the parks so that you can get them embroidered with your names on them! If you buy them online, you won't have a Disney receipt, so they won't write on them for you (exceptions get made, but it's a better bet)."
Disneyland,3a4c5n,chocovash,2,Wed Jun 17 10:49:51 2015 UTC,"They are twice as expensive on Amazon!  They are arround $20 at the parks.  They have them all the time, even at world of disney, so you don't even have to enter the park before getting your hat."

Disneyland,3a4c5n,Albort,2,Thu Jun 18 04:31:20 2015 UTC,"to add to this, there arent much wedding stuff at world of disney.  They are just a little under $20 each.  i guess u can say the extra price on amazon is shipping/taxes?  Just those hats and some sculptures are available.  I was looking into some for a friends wedding(2 weeks ago).  i ended up getting some personalized engraved glass in the park instead."
Disneyland,3a4c5n,progress_dad,7,Thu Jun 18 21:59:16 2015 UTC,"yeah dude just get them in the parks! that way you can get them embroidered with your names or ""Mr."" and ""Mrs."" but don't forget your ""happily ever after"" buttons! They don't make the just married ones anymore but if you want to search Amazon for one of those, you might find them! The happily ever after buttons are free in the parks though.  They got rid of the just married ones due to the whole marriage inequality thing."
Disneyland,3a4c5n,chocovash,3,Wed Jun 17 05:15:32 2015 UTC,"Disneyland still Just Married buttons (don't know what you heard, but it's not true). Disneyworld has Just Engaged. Both have Happily Ever After buttons. Source: I work Disneyland stores, moving to Disneyworld"

Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,0,Tue Jun 16 16:00:06 2015 UTC,I'd say the ridiculous summer lines are more traumatizing than being mobbed by fans of your parents.
Disneyland,3a0sro,Soulcrux,9,Tue Jun 16 19:15:57 2015 UTC,I feel bad for a kid who can't just have fun and be normal.

Disneyland,3a0sro,mybaby51,14,Tue Jun 16 15:53:14 2015 UTC,"Hope she has a nice childhood, her parents are happy, and her life is happy. A lot of people get downright nasty at celebrities— especially their children who are often seen as undeserving of the nice lives they get. But the sad thing is that it seems like a lot of famous kids get screwed up one way or another. That just sucks, no matter how expensive the things you get are."
Disneyland,3a0sro,Soulcrux,2,Tue Jun 16 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"I feel much more sorry in the long run for kids of famous parents who get screwed up because of their parents' success/fame or being famous at a young age. For instance, I don't worry about Prince George or Princess Charlotte, because I know they have relatives who will make sure they have as normal a childhood as possible (if incredibly privileged) and grow up to be thoughtful, intelligent, kind, and humble. And I wish the same for North, whether it's because of or despite the people she's related to."

Disneyland,3a0sro,foxhound-mgs,45,Tue Jun 16 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"The amount of hate in here is disgusting. They're famous, so that means they can't even enjoy the Disney parks like the rest of us? Should North not be allowed to experience the joys that Disney brings?   You'd think a Disney sub would be more positive"
Disneyland,3a0sro,morla74,5,Tue Jun 16 17:27:05 2015 UTC,You mean a man who compared himself to Walt Disney and discourages reading isn't liked on a disney forum? You don't say.
Disneyland,3a0sro,XirdenStone,12,Tue Jun 16 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"Goes with the old adage ""If you have nothing nice to say, don't say it at all.""  The parks should bring people together and unite everyone as fans of Disney. I guess I'm just a romantic that thinks maybe, just maybe, the parks can be an escape from the real world. A place where we can all just enjoy the things that Disney has created. I've stood in a queue and made friends with those around me, I'm sure there are plenty of things that we'd disagree on, but we are there for the same reasons and it helps create a positive vibe in the parks.   I'm just saying, just let people enjoy the parks without having to get ripped for other things they've done. The Disney communities here should be an extension of the parks. Happy thoughts in, happy thoughts out"
Disneyland,3a0sro,morla74,-1,Tue Jun 16 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"They are famous, yeah. I don't personally like them or care for them. Celebs always get hate or love, its not new. The HATE isn't going towards the kid, its going towards the parents as far as I can tell. Kanye isn't the nicest person from what I recall.  EVEN though it's a Disneyland Subreddit, Its reddit. Not hating on your comment, just wanted to clear things up so you won't get hated on.  :)"

Disneyland,3a0sro,Ghost00,3,Tue Jun 16 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"On a side note, I saw them too. Worked a shift yesterday. One of the few times I've been completely uninterested in seeing a celebrity."
Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,2,Tue Jun 16 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"Jeez. Why the negativity, especially from a cast member?"
Disneyland,3a0sro,SmartestDumbTeen,11,Tue Jun 16 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a CM, but I'm also a human. These people are disgusting to me. I pretty much dislike all they stand for. I treated them as I would any other guest, with respect and dignity. But I don't LIKE them. CM I may be, but I am a person with my own thoughts."
Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,4,Tue Jun 16 17:00:02 2015 UTC,"I just said that because I was surprised you would mention being a cast member, revealing yourself possibly. I thought it was taboo to complain about guests on the internet, but this isn't the level at which those who got fired were at I guess. Not that I don't believe you can't have your own opinion, I just thought Disney was strict, not that they should be, but they are."
Disneyland,3a0sro,SmartestDumbTeen,8,Tue Jun 16 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"CMs are on reddit all the time. I've announced pretty loudly that I am one and have been one for a long time. I've never given my name and I haven't narrowed down where I work. Nor do I give away any info Disney doesn't already have posted someplace. I've told stories about my time here, but I always change names. However, given that pretty much the entire world was aware that these people were in Disneyland yesterday, I don't think a random CM posting ""yup, saw them here."" Will make a huge impact in the grand scheme of things."
Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,3,Tue Jun 16 17:15:11 2015 UTC,I figured that after I posted. I guess only the horror stories get posted online too. The story about the guy who dressed up as Jack Sparrow always makes me a bit sad.
Disneyland,3a0sro,SmartestDumbTeen,0,Tue Jun 16 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of stories from Disney. If you're a CM and smart, you can post them, just don't give up too much info and keep personal info private. That's all"
Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,-2,Tue Jun 16 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think a random CM posting ""yup, saw them here."" Will make a huge impact in the grand scheme of things.   That's not what you said though, you said something disparaging. I really hope a CM never does this if a pic of my family is posted.  Also, I understand that you are human and have an opinion, but when you identify yourself as a CM, you become a representative of the company you work for. CMs posting negatively about guests is not a good look for Disney and not a good look for the CM."
Disneyland,3a0sro,RockemSockemCronuts,2,Wed Jun 17 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"So, if I took out the ""I'm a CM."" You would veiw this post differently? I can assure you I'm not the only person working in the Resort who feels this way. I can say with confidence that there are MANY CMs who feel strongly about them. Negative and positive. I just so happen to dislike the image they put out. It's a family park. I wouldn't enjoy my kids being around people like them. I'd say you'd have to be pretty naive to think all the people working at Disney feel favorably towards celebrities in general. Disney will always take a neutral stance on everything, and they don't like offending anyone. But again, if you think it's a hive mind of happy, smiling people who work there, you've got the wrong image. For the record, I understand what you're saying. But I'm not at work, I'm sitting in my room, watching a movie. My opinion is not representing Disney right now. It's just me wondering why some mindless chick and her self absorbed husband are celebrated stars and why everyone seems so obsessed with them."
Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,-1,Wed Jun 17 04:22:31 2015 UTC,You do realize that giving celebrities overly negative attention is just as ridiculous as giving them admiration? You're still giving way too much thought to a person you don't know at all and your opinion of them is fully colored by what the media portrays them as.
Disneyland,3a0sro,Soulcrux,3,Tue Jun 16 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"I look at the message they send out. Nothing positive. Sure, I'm forming a strong opinion, but like I said, I'm human. I don't like what they do. Kanye is full of himself. Kim....I'm not even sure where to start. But both of them are not role models. I don't like reality stars in general. I don't like dealing with celebrities and the groups that they bring with them. Speaking purely from a working standpoint, large demanding groups are often a problem. This one was no different. All kinds of minor annoyances. Judge me if you want, but I don't like them."
Disneyland,3a0sro,FawkesFire13,0,Tue Jun 16 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"It's not negative, it's indifferent. And why not. Hell I see celebs all the time at work and we are told to treat them the same as all other customers. No asking for autographs, photographs etc."

Fast passes are distributed by kiosks near the ride, swipe your ticket to get one, can only have one every few hours or untill the first one is used.  There will be a cast member near the front of every line to accept your fast pass and let you skip a substantial portion of the line.   3.Radiator springs racers in DCA,  I cannot stress this enough, always has a 2 hour + line, get there early as you can or get a fast pass as early as you can.  4.No, I'm nearly thirty and hug Goofy every time I go.

Disneyland,3a2xpk,XirdenStone,7,Tue Jun 16 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about clogging up the sub! That's what we're here for! :)   I can't speak to the size of Disneyland Paris -- I've never been. I know Disneyland is smaller than Walt Disney World in Florida, and Walt Disney World usually takes about a week. Disneyland just has 2 parks (as opposed to WDW's 4 parks). A week should be more than enough to see everything, but I wouldn't say you'll run out of things to do. There's people with Annual Passes who go every week for years. Just take things slowly, and if you enjoyed a ride feel free to go again and again and again -- you have the time for it! Fastpasses are a completely free way to skip a bit of the line at our more popular attractions. You won't skip the entire line -- you'll still wait around 15 minutes -- but you'll skip a lot of it. How it works is you get a Fastpass ticket from little kiosks outside the ride you want to go on (rides with Fastpass will be marked with a little ""FP"" by their name on your park map). Have the machine scan your ticket, and it'll give you a ""return time"" where you can come back and go on the ride. It's a one-hour window (i.e. 10:20 AM - 11:20 AM), and it works like a dinner reservation. You can show up 5 minutes early or 15 minutes late, but not earlier or later. The catch is that you're only allowed 1 Fastpass every couple hours -- the time that you're allowed to get another Fastpass is printed at the bottom of your Fastpass. There's a couple. At Disneyland, our more popular rides are Space Mountain and Indiana Jones. I believe Paris has a similar Space Mountain, but our Indiana Jones ride is completely different -- I believe the only thing remotely like it at any Disney park is the Dinosaur ride at Walt Disney World. California Adventure has Radiator Springs Racers, which is probably the most popular attraction in both parks. It's perfectly normal to go get pictures and autographs with as many characters as you want! People do it all the time, young and old alike. If you want to get Belle to give you her autograph, you're more than welcome to. Don't be afraid of going to character meet-and-greets -- I'm 21 and I still go visit Rapunzel from time to time. That's all personal opinions. I'm a cast member at the Star Tours ride at Disneyland, so I'm a bit biased towards recommending Tomorrowland attractions such as Space Mountain and Star Tours. My favorite non-Tomorrowland ride is the Jungle Cruise, but that's mainly because they make horrible, horrible, horrible jokes and puns for 10 minutes straight and I love it so much. Indiana Jones, as I've mentioned, is a popular ride as well. We also have ""classic"" rides like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. Everyone has their favorites and least-favorites, and over the course of a week you'll have more than enough time to go on all the rides you'd like!"

Disneyland,3a2xpk,jon98gn,2,Tue Jun 16 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"Well it's a family vacation, there's certain rides that hold memories for all of us because of my childhood. For example I really want to be beside my dad on Star Tours and Winnie the Pooh because he watched those with me as a child. Anything related to Mickey, Donald Goofy etc. will be with my mum since she watched a lot of those with me as a kid. And most of the pixar stuff holds memories for me and my sister."
Disneyland,3a2xpk,SnarkMasterRay,3,Wed Jun 17 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"1) The only people who run out of things to do are the lazy, unimaginative, dead inside types. You will not run out of things to do if you are young at heart and enjoy happy places.  2) Mostly covered. The fast pass kiosks have signs at the entrances (like popular rides, fast passes for popular rides can have lines so there are designated entrances and exits) and the actual fast pass ticket dispensers may be designed to match the surroundings in some way (Star tours dispensers look like Gonk the power droid)  3) Currently Space Mountain in Disneyland and Radiator Springs Racers in California Adventures have the longest consistent lines.   4) Everyone's a kid at Disneyland. My ex-wife and I were in our late 30s and childless; we'd hit the Minnie and Friends character breakfasts regularly and would always see older couples like us and they were both invariable wearing ear hats and one or the other would get up and hug their favorite character when it came around (I should say that these were different couples every time). Besides, why should you care if someone horribly judges you for having a good time in a harmless and safe way?  5) This depends a lot on what you enjoy. There are fast, exhilarating rides (California screaming, Matterhorn, Thunder Mountain), more story driven sedate rides (Haunted Mansion, small world), and a lot in between. The Teapots aren't the fastest, but they're fun because it's a group exhilaration (with everyone facing each other). Grizzly River Run is the same way. As I get older, the Matterhorn feels like it's kicking me in the kidneys harder and harder, but I've never met a ride I'd say no to there. I'm just there for the fun, so I'll duck into any old ride if I can or if the others are backed up. This makes for a good experience if you can be flexible."

She's terrified of bugs :p)  we expect it to be crowded so it doesn't annoy us,  we just go with the flow.

Only until about after the fireworks (10pm) does the park start to clear out enough to make waiting in lines manageable."
Disneyland,3a2omo,Brerabbits,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of love for evenings here, but on my last trip we hit the park hard in the mornings and then had the afternoons to relax and simply experience being in the parks.  It was life-changing.  When the crowds were 9 out of 10, coming early in the morning we were able to hit every ride we wanted while it was relatively calm.  Once it started to get busy, we ducked into Carthay Circle for a few cocktails and went off to enjoy the people-watching and shopping. For the Diamond Celebration, this also gave us some time to camp out for some events (I'm looking at you, 8:50 showing of the Paint the Night parade.) If I had to choose between the two, if your goal was to ride as much as possible, I'd say take advantage of the early mornings."

I used it when I took my girlfriend on her first disneyland trip last year (21 years never been, her parents never took her as a kid, and we live in Central California!) and it allowed us to hit all the rides I wanted to show her (Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder, Space Mountain, Splash, Screamin', Tower of Terror) on a Saturday during October, and we never waited longer than 20 minutes.    Probably won't get quite the same low-wait time on a Thanksgiving Weekend during the Diamond Celebration, but it will give you the very best schedule guaranteed. It does all the fastpass calculations for you and factors in the best times to go to each ride you select."

Disneyland,39xoru,AnubisEight,21,Mon Jun 15 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"This was due to selfie-stick? If so that's ridiculous, how are loaders not seeing guests with them in-hand and not saying anything? Or are people getting on, then taking them out as the ride vehicle leaves the station?  Lifetime ban worthy as far as I'm concerned. The lack of respect for other people's time and safety is about as low as it gets."
Disneyland,39xoru,ChocoTacoz,45,Mon Jun 15 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"We do warn guests of the consequences before boarding, thanks very much. But, as you said, they very often choose not to listen and take them out after dispatch because entitlement and ""I'll do whatever the hell I want"" is apparently a thing that Disney guests feel on a regular basis.   We do what we can to stop the trains (speaking strictly about Screamin') from launching through the attraction if their selfie stick is out, but they're not always easy to see at the launch area so we often don't see the damn things until further into the attraction."

I love screamin', but to me it doesn't trigger any sort of height-induced fear because I'm not stationary - however, I know if I had to step out of the train car while up there I would probably start shaking and hyperventilating involuntarily."
Disneyland,39xoru,carouselunicorn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:59:17 2015 UTC,"Panic attacks, while I wouldn't say are common, do happen with some frequency. Honestly, there isn't a whole lot we can do other than try to reassure the guest that we literally do this all the time with a 100% success rate. If it's a really severe attack, I'd imagine the Disneyland FD would intervene and probably carry the guest down.  I think in the past we have simply left the guest(s) on board the train, evacuated the remainder of the attraction, then sent the train through the rest of the ride and back into the station, though that method takes considerably longer. We definitely prefer to do a standard walking evac, especially if the ride control system is being difficult and keeps causing downtimes."
Disneyland,39xoru,ThrowawayDLR,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:21:43 2015 UTC,Thank you! That's actually very reassuring.
Disneyland,39xoru,carouselunicorn,-13,Fri Jun 19 00:15:17 2015 UTC,"In your experience, has a stick ever done actual damage, or is it just the threat of damage? I remember not to long ago when the operators were cool with sticks, just reminding users to ""keep it low"".   I ask because I often hear stories about cameras, purses, and phones actually flying out of rides, but never with an acompaning since of urgency to find some ""final solution"" (park wide ban) to the problem the way the sticks are.   I think a restriction on all lose items on rides (the way Knotts or Six Flags does it)  is a more honest solution to the ""safety"" problem.   But then again, I don't use my gopro stick on rides, but do enjoy the creative angles it gives me on low ground, so I might be biased against a parkwide ban."
Disneyland,39xoru,Ampage86,18,Mon Jun 15 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but Im from WDW as well. Ive seen them dislodge Big Thunder and Speedway ride vehicles after being run over. But the threat of damage that differentiates the sticks from say, a camera, is that the reach is further and has a possibility of hitting beams and other guests without even being dropped. And most of these can be attached to the wrist to prevent being dropped, which means when they hit a beam/wall/guest/ride vehicle (which are not designed to account for an extra two foot arm span that these sticks give them), it has a possibility to break or even rip off their arm in the process."
Disneyland,39xoru,Assorted_Donuts,3,Mon Jun 15 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. I would definatly agree based on that they are more dangerous than a camera by itself and rightly deserve being banned on rides, but I am not convinced yet they are so much more dangerous to justify a parkwide ban.  Ideally, I would like either to see a sricter policy on loose items in general (being that a purse or camera is still dangerous, just to a lesser extent) or some text under the no stick signs like ""violators will be ejected from the park with no refund"""
Disneyland,39xoru,Ampage86,2,Mon Jun 15 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"As much as people seem to find them annoying, I don't think a park wide ban is really justified either. I haven't seen them be a threat to people's safety outside the rides, people just have a beef with them. But loose items do need a stricter policy. I would say a good half the time my ride is down is because of an improperly stowed item. While I haven't personally experienced a guest injury from it, its only a matter of time. Plus the ride going down at least once a day and evacuating people isn't exactly ideal guest service. We've gone down for everything from a sweater to a bottle of ranch dressing! Plus the amount of phones and hats we take to lost and found from the bottom of the ride every night is usually between 5-10 each!!"
Disneyland,39xoru,Assorted_Donuts,3,Tue Jun 16 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"A park-wide ban wouldn't be because of safety issues off of rides, but the fact that they are causing so many issues on rides that it's easier just to stop sticks from entering altogether. Clearly signs and verbal instructions to guests to stow the sticks aren't working."

I always figured rides go down a lot for stupid reasons like those and people just assume ""it's broken right now"" but since the sticks have so much heat on them now, when a ride goes down due to a stick, it's suddenly some huge problem that is a new threat to the park."
Disneyland,39xoru,Ampage86,4,Tue Jun 16 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for any other ride but my own, but my rough estimate for my coaster is that about 5% is people getting out on the ride or touching stuff while out there, 15% is actual mechanical problems, and then 40% is improperly stowed items, and 40% is people taking too long getting in/out of the ride causing us to shut down. Our ride is only really ""broken"" a couple times a month, but we go down almost every single day, sometimes multiple times."
Disneyland,39xoru,Assorted_Donuts,9,Tue Jun 16 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"The fact that nearly every ride in the park has a ""no selfie stick"" sign demonstrates they prove to be a greater issue than just loose objects."
Disneyland,39xoru,XirdenStone,4,Mon Jun 15 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"I was curious as to it being due to an actual incident, or mearly the threat of an incident.   I am also curious if incidents do occur, do they haappen at the same or different frequency as the more general ""loose item""  incidents occur."
Disneyland,39xoru,Ampage86,5,Mon Jun 15 23:32:35 2015 UTC,again piping in from the East Coast. Once we shut down rock n roller coaster after someone came into unload with a gash on their head due to a birthday button that flung off at launch. She was full on bleeding. Imagine the damage a selfie stick could do...
Disneyland,39xoru,progress_dad,3,Mon Jun 15 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"The same argument could be made against a camera doing more damage than a button. That's why if people want restrictions,  they should be honest and want a restriction on all loose items as opposed to targeting sticks only."

Thankfully physics is on our side when speaking about loose objects in general. Centripetal force helps keep objects in the coaster, even when they're on the floor or in the provided pouches. We dispatch quite literally thousands of guests per day on Screamin' who put their bags on the floor of the train and none fall out.   Remember this: If something does ""fly out"" of a train, it's because it wasn't stowed properly, plain and simple."
Disneyland,39xoru,ThrowawayDLR,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:38:25 2015 UTC,"We dispatch quite literally thousands of guests per day on Screamin' who put their bags on the floor of the train and none fall out.    And I'm sure there are thousands of selfie sticks that go though the rides put away securely as well.  But just as an occasional bag, camera, or phone falls out, an occasional selfie stick comes out.   Both instances are due to careless riders. Those are the people I have an issue with, not the sticks themselves."
Disneyland,39xoru,Ampage86,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah... There aren't ""thousands"" of selfie sticks going through our attraction. Maybe dozens would be more accurate, and the rate at which they're seen before and during the ride is astounding. The type of guest who uses them on the ride (to the point of causing a downtime) is the type of guest who typically scoffs at the instructions of CMs because of their entitlement issues. I'd like to see the stick (and guest...) banned.   And, I don't think we're far from it. I heard a rumor that guests will eventually be taken to Guest Relations to have their selfie stick ""checked in"" for the duration of their visit in the park, to be returned as they leave. Sure, it won't keep 100% of them out, not by a long shot, but I think that's a reasonable step we could take."

The chance I'd be stuck on this ride, in the sun, and have to hike down is enough to keep me off it until this is resolved.

It's like they paid all this money and got mad that they have to follow rules. It is entitlement. ""I spent $$$ to ride here so you can't tell me what or what not to do. I pay your check."" I've seen people like this at the parks. Don't know where they came from but they're pretty much killjoys. I saw go capital punishment with those selfies sticks. I could only imagine how much money Disney spends every time they have to shut a ride down.   P.s. I could see the little shit using the selfie stick in the OP."

Disneyland,39xoru,JalenJade,4,Mon Jun 15 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"Doubt it. They don't check your person when you enter the park, just your bag. Most selfie sticks are small enough to fit in pockets, especially if you're wearing cargo shorts or something. Hell, you can probably hide it deep enough in your bag to get it in. They don't check thoroughly enough to prevent most things from entering the park."

Popular consensus is that these stoppages are caused by people using selfie sticks while on the ride.  Edit: It's not popular consensus. Cast member redditors have said it was indeed selfie stick related."
Disneyland,39xoru,dodgepodge,8,Mon Jun 15 23:16:00 2015 UTC,"How, though? They drop it and it malfunctions the ride? Or are Cast members stopping the ride when they see someone with it because it's a safety hazard?"
Disneyland,39xoru,galile0,19,Tue Jun 16 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"Safety hazard. Ride goes fast, stick flies backwards, can hit someone."
Disneyland,39xoru,dodgepodge,7,Tue Jun 16 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"As /u/dodgepodge said it's a safety issue.   Disney treats Selfie Sticks as a extension of your body, the rides were all designed with basically a ""safety zone"" where they basically knew that nothing was actually close enough to the ride vehicle that anyone could really hurt themselves or the ride since it was all too far away (note this does NOT mean you should try to reach something by sticking your limbs outside the vehicle).   With selfie sticks all of a sudden your arm is 3 feet longer than anticipated meaning you can probably hit something you normally couldn't reach.   If you hit something it could do a lot of damage to the ride, you, or people around you.   In the case of California Screamin' a stick could hit the structure or the top of one of the coverings, if it did you could injure yourself if you don't let go and if you do let go it could fall back onto a guest behind you. Worst case it falls on the track and could cause another car to derail (or something, i really don't know what a foreign object on the track could do but I imagine it cant be good)."
Disneyland,39xoru,Shatteredreality,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"Wasn't it that the train lost speed and valleyed after the loop and they had to call the FD to get people off? Either way, foreign objects on tracks are NEVER a good situation."
Disneyland,39xoru,caliloonz,3,Tue Jun 16 05:07:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I gotchu. Something so small can cause such great harm. They really should ban than thing. Even if it doesn't end up hurting anyone it causes a huge inconvenience such as the OP.
Disneyland,39xoru,galile0,3,Tue Jun 16 09:31:09 2015 UTC,Agreed. Honestly I don't think a park wide ban will do much but honestly if they have to shut down rides as a result of one person then they need to do something.
Disneyland,39xoru,Shatteredreality,3,Tue Jun 16 15:55:15 2015 UTC,Clearly at this point just having cast members telling them not to pull them out during the ride isn't helping.  Few bad apples spoil ot for everyone.

Disneyland,39xoru,XirdenStone,7,Tue Jun 16 11:51:33 2015 UTC,"In addition, I don't think the ride is falling apart, so I doubt it's technical issues. Just rider safety issues."
Disneyland,39xoru,dodgepodge,-6,Mon Jun 15 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, the rides close down pretty much daily for one reason or another. I just don't think we should assume/blame selfie sticks every time it happens."
Disneyland,39xoru,Obi-Tron_Kenobi,2,Tue Jun 16 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"Did they mention if it was due to the stick falling and breaking a ride element, or just a cast member noticing it and stopping the train at the block section?"
Disneyland,39xoru,robkabob,7,Tue Jun 16 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"We can only hold trains in the station and pre-launch at Screamin', so when we saw the stick come out of the train that was stuck at the top of the main lift, we had to shut the whole ride down."

Disneyland,3a2iq6,throwaway04450520,7,Tue Jun 16 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"As far as hotels go, I have stayed at the Super8's on Katella and on Disneyland Drive. Rooms were very basic and maybe a touch run down, but not seedy. Both locations were walkable, although perhaps by the end of a long day the Disneyland Drive one would feel like a hike. There is the ART Shuttle for the hotels that are further out and it works fairly well, although it's somewhat limiting if you like staying late (last bus is 30 minutes after park closing and you may need to hustle to make it to the stop in time).  We've also stayed at the Anaheim Motel6 Main gate three or four times and it was our motel of choice for a while as it was only two (very long at the end of the day) blocks away and fairly inexpensive. It was renovated maybe 3-4 years ago, but it's a fairly busy hotel and was starting to feel a little used by the last time I was there in December. I'm going again in September and will be staying at the Park Vue Inn, which is about double the price per night as the above hotels but closer and nicer. If all you're looking for is a place to crash, I'm not sure that it's worth it and would suggest the other places first.  I've also saved money by eating wisely - park food is fun but can be expensive. There are cheaper alternatives outside the park and you can bring food in, but also cheaper alternatives in the park. If you want to try the famous Monte Cristo sandwich, you can get it at Cafe Orleans for about $7.50 less than at the more famous Blue Bayou. I always planned on one expensive mean a day and the rest cheap. That could be a $30 Character breakfast buffet to load up and then a $5 beef skewer, $6.50 chimichanga, ~$8.00 corn dog, or $10 turkey leg. The bigger meal generally gave you a chance to sit down and rest, when done later."
Disneyland,3a2iq6,SnarkMasterRay,5,Wed Jun 17 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert on hotels since I never stay in them, but I do know that you need to purchase a ""Parkhopper"" ticket in order to visit both California Adventure and Disneyland in the same day. If you just purchase a Disneyland ticket, you will not be able to visit DCA. If you're going for multiple days, they also sell multi-day Parkhopper tickets, so those are probably the ones you want to get. I hope I could help!"
Disneyland,3a2iq6,Camkasal,5,Tue Jun 16 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with park hopper is that you are paying extra for the convenience to visit both parks in a single day. Since it is his first visit, it may be cheaper for him to do single park admission and just concentrate on doing all the park's rides and events in that specific day. Plus getting the Park hopper invites you to switch parks which means you'll spend 30+ minutes crossing parks. Also when doing California Adventure you will want to pick up the World of Color Fast Pass as soon as possible in the morning if you want any seating. Also I love the Aladdin show in DCA."
Disneyland,3a2iq6,jon98gn,3,Tue Jun 16 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"There are tons of hotels in the area for much cheaper than the Disneyland ones! Booking package deals can also save you some money. I usually get my flight and hotel together on Expedia, which is a bit cheaper than booking it all separately. On one trip, it was actually a bit cheaper for us to book through the actual Disneyland site and get our tickets and hotel together.    A podcast I listen to is sponsored by a site called mouse savers. Honestly, I've never really looked through it in depth, but it might be some help to you?    And yep, Disneyland and DCA tickets are two different things, although for a bit more you can get a park hopper pass that lets you go to both in a day!"

Disneyland,3a2iq6,XirdenStone,2,Tue Jun 16 22:09:50 2015 UTC,Check Groupon for hotel deals in the area. The Annabella had one up a month or so ago.
Disneyland,3a2iq6,No_Long,2,Tue Jun 16 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"There's lots of cheap hotels around the area. Some of them are even technically closer to the main gates than the actual Disney hotels are. For an easy list, just look up the ""Good Neighbor"" hotel list on Disneyland's website. Most of those are pretty decent.  A Disneyland ticket can be purchased as a one park deal or a park hopper deal. With the one park deal, then you can use your ticket for either park but whichever park you enter first in the morning is going to be the only park that you can visit for the entire day. So if you walk into California Adventure first, then you won't be able to visit Disneyland that day, even though the ticket looks the same and costs the same. To visit both parks on the same day, you can buy a park hopper ticket which gets you access to both parks on the same day.  Now, if you buy a multiple day ticket, and you don't splurge on the park hopper option, then you can swap whatever park you're going to on each day. So if you buy a three-day one-park ticket, and you enter Disneyland on the first day, then you can only stay in Disneyland on the first day, but on the second day, you can use the same ticket to enter California Adventure first, which will let you visit California Adventure for the whole day, but once you walk through the turnstiles that morning, you won't be able to visit Disneyland until your third day.  You get one park per day, and you choose which park you're going to visit just by walking through the turnstiles. Unless you pay $56 more and get the park hopper ticket, which lets you jump between both parks on the same day.  As for any other tips. If you want to go to one of the nicer restaurants, reservations are probably reccommended, and new visitors always shy away from this, but learn how to use the Fastpass system and use it all day long. It's amazing. It lets you reserve spots on rides a couple of hours into the future for free. I always see new visitors shy away from it because they expect Disney to charge their credit card or something, and it's a damn shame."

Disneyland,3a2iq6,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:12:46 2015 UTC,This is a basic feature of Disneyland. Disney's explanation should be sufficient. It gets you out of the line and shopping (or riding an attraction with a shorter queue) instead of just standing there.

Disneyland,3a0h7v,EagleEyeInTheSky,7,Tue Jun 16 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"With Ghost Galaxy being a regular thing now, and the new Yeti in the Matterhorn being so intense compared to other thrills in the park, even compared to Indiana Jones, I wonder if Disney is opening itself up to more intense attractions and experiences in general?  I mean, Disney always has tried to get more and more intense and immersive as the years have gone by, but the new Yeti seems like a huge step up in the fear factor from previous attractions. I think it's great. My new hobby is taking adult Disney veterans on the new ride and not telling them about what's changed and watching them scream their heads off. But it also feels like this may be something that should have one of those ""This attraction may be frightening to children"" signs in front of it.  Is this Disney realizing that with stuff like Ghost Galaxy and Mad T Party, they can appeal to more age groups and keep kids enthralled with Disney all the way through to adulthood?  And how far will this go? Could we eventually see a return of ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter on the West Coast where Innoventions currently is?"
Disneyland,3a0h7v,Weefergie,4,Tue Jun 16 07:34:54 2015 UTC,"I hope Disney keep trying to entertain adults sure. But they shouldn't try to make the parks scary. DL is the happiest place on earth, not the scariest.  It wouldn't fit well with the parks target demographic to have coasters like the ones at Alton Towers or Universal. Disney is a place for families. The great thing about Disneyland is that even the thrill rides are for everyone. For example. For my final year of elementary school (primary school here in the UK) we went to Disneyland Paris. And the great thing was that even though I was just over 4 foot at the time I could ride basically everything. And the class of 10-11 year olds could get on every ride without being scared to death.  I rode ToT, Rock n' Roller Coaster, Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain etc. All the big thrill rides. I wasn't scared to death on them. That's not to say there isn't room for really extreme coasters. California Screamin' comes to mind. But I feel more extreme coasters should be kept out of the Disneyland style parks and go to parks like Hollywood Studios, DCA or Disney Studios in Paris."
Disneyland,3a0h7v,EagleEyeInTheSky,6,Tue Jun 16 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I get the appeal of not having huge hulking coasters everywhere, but what do you think of the atmospheric scary stuff that's already been introduced? I think Disney's done a fantastic job creating unsettling experiences without putting in huge height requirements. Both Harold in the Matterhorn and the Ghost in Ghost Galaxy are pretty terrifying, but they still let brave children on as long as they meet the same height requirements that all the other rides have. The scariest Disney ride ever, Alien Encounter, probably had no height requirement at all, since the seats didn't move, and the restraints were more to keep people from running out of the theater than anything else. Personally, I think it's great that braver kids have the option of going on the more intense atmospheric rides, even though they may not be tall enough for coasters."
Disneyland,3a0h7v,mrpiggywinkles52,2,Wed Jun 17 05:33:15 2015 UTC,Not OP but I think that sort of stuff is ok. Atmospheric stuff especially. As for scary anamatronics they have their place. On rides like Ghost Galaxy and the Matterhorn which are thrill rides that's great. But not on fantasyland dark rides. New anamatronics there would be great but not terrifying ones.
Disneyland,3a0h7v,Weefergie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"I think that it's good to have atmospheric scariness. The Matterhorn does this well with all the old equipment and The Haunted Mansion of course does it well. I think to an Extent Big Thunder even does. They make it a little creepy but not terrifying.  As for scary projections or anamatronics I think they have their place. Thrill rides like Space Mountain, The Matterhorn etc. would really benefit from them. But they don't have a place on say the Fantasyland Dark rides. New anamatronics there would be pretty cool but I don't think they fit to be terrifying on those rides.  I don't think a new park is great for thrill rides either. Most people are satisfied with the type of rides like Rock n' Roller Coaster, Space Mountain or Tower. Something like California screamin is a bit much for some people (myself included)  The biggest issue with massive coasters or thrill rides is there an eyesore. It takes a great theme or a lot of magic to hide them. ToT does it well since it has the exterior of the building. Screamin' does it well also since it fits with the theme of Paradise Pier. But a massive coaster in the middle of Fantasyland or Tomorrowland would kinda ruin it for me."

Disneyland,3a0h7v,_treebeard,2,Wed Jun 17 19:00:17 2015 UTC,Maybe it has to do with the excitement of what you know if coming. Stress makes you process more faster (in the short term) which makes it seem like time is moving slower. Like people who witness car accidents describe this phenomenon. They even showed its real by having people bungee jump and see if they could read any numbers on a screen that was changing too quickly for the human eye to process and they could. Excuse my psychology ramblings.

Disneyland,39uqh6,Sporkicide,5,Mon Jun 15 03:30:04 2015 UTC,Let me clarify - what I meant is the stick itself interfering with the ride operation or is a ride operator shutting it down because some idiot felt the need to break one out during the ride?

Disneyland,39uqh6,Pellitos,3,Mon Jun 15 15:01:53 2015 UTC,"A stick is more dangerous because it is held farther away and is therefore more likely to collide with something like railings or walls outside the train, which could result it people being hurt by flying stick/camera pieces."

Disneyland,39uqh6,castmemberzack,3,Mon Jun 15 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"It really could be both. There once was a backpack that landed on the tracks and caused the coaster not to finish the hill after the loop. It wasn't stopped by brakes, but by the backpack screwing with the wheels. Disney operators are probably try to avoid that and injury to people. So, it's the ride operator, but if the ride operator doesn't intervene, it can affect the ride operation."
Disneyland,39uqh6,AnubisEight,14,Mon Jun 15 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"Coasters are designed with a certain amount of ""buffer"" distance between the train and the environment, so people who put their arms  up won't be injured.

Disneyland,39xkfl,lcue1,7,Mon Jun 15 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would strongly recommend against going on the 4th (I would suggest before) being that it's a very busy holiday. Also, since you are coming for the first time I think a 3-day ticket would be a lot cheaper and will give you a better opportunity to get a lot of stuff done. I would visit ridemax.com or touringplans.com to help you organize your days. As for rides and attractions, I would recommend: Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, Star Tours, Mickey and The Magical Map (show) and  Mickey's Soundsational parade, Paint the Night parade, and Disneyland Forever fireworks for Disneyland. For California Adventure I would suggest: Grizzly River Run, Soarin' Over California, Mickey's Fun Wheel, California Screamin', Tower of Terror, Radiator Springs Racers (get a fast pass before 12 pm bc its over a 2 hour wait usually without one), Midway Mania, Aladdin's Musical Spectacular (my favorite; it fills up pretty quick so wait early), Frozen Sing-Along, Pixar Play parade, and World of Color. Definitely download Disneyland wait times or Mousewait on your phone to check ride wait times to help you through your day. I hope you have fun!  Source: Annual pass holder"
Disneyland,39xkfl,FrankThePigeon,3,Mon Jun 15 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"I hear you on the 4th being busy..if it were just me I would go on another date but it's part of my families planned vacation. (My sister and her bf and in-laws are coming to town) They already have their tickets so if I want to go with, I have to buy my tickets. I'm not sure if we can afford 3day but I REALLY want to make it happen. (One day I will own that annual pass!!)  I will look into ridemax and touringplans. Thanks for the suggestions!"
Disneyland,39xkfl,FrankThePigeon,4,Tue Jun 16 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see, then the earlier you can get to the parks the better chance you'll have to do some stuff you'd really like to do before it fills up. And be sure to bring a hat, sunscreen and some water, it will be a hot one!"
Disneyland,39xkfl,awwaygirl,6,Tue Jun 16 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"Per the FAQ:    Ticket questions  See /r/Disneyland's ticket information section. ºoº APs  Visit /r/DisneylandAP for more info. ºoº Shopping for cheap tickets/scam warning  There are very few secure way to get cheaper tickets. Discounts are available for groups and through AAA. Craigslist posts are your own risk. The parks now scan pictures with your ticket, so if your picture does not match to you, you will be turned away."
Disneyland,39xkfl,XirdenStone,3,Mon Jun 15 20:31:11 2015 UTC,"I would avoid going on the 4th if you are only planning on one day in all honesty.  Every holiday is very busy, especially ones that create long weekends."
Disneyland,39xkfl,Sarroarr,2,Mon Jun 15 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I know aRes travel sells slightly discounted ticket vouchers, that you exchange for tickets at the park, but I don't think one day passes are included on there. Are you only planning on going the one day?  How many people are going? What ages?"

Disneyland,39xkfl,Sarroarr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:43:26 2015 UTC,"Here's the link  It isn't much of a difference in price though - it's really difficult to get any kind of discount on Disneyland tickets. You could get the one park per day tickets and just plan your days out in each park separately - I've done it before and as long as you have a decent plan, you'll be fine.  You two should definitely check out Radiator Springs in California Adventure right away in the morning on one of your days! The ride gets crazy line ups and it's really fun (especially if you enjoy the Cars movies). If you're thinking you'll want to ride it twice, get a FastPass as well in the morning - I've heard the FastPasses run out pretty quick.  If you're into more extreme rides - California Screamin is awesome! I hate extreme rides, but was forced onto this.. and now I love it. Tower of Terror is great too.  Also, you definitely have to check out Indiana Jones/Pirates of the Caribbean/Haunted Mansion in Disneyland. They're definitely my favorite rides over there.  As everyone has been saying, July 4 will be pretty busy, so you'll want to make sure you use the FastPass system if you go that day."

Disneyland,39xkfl,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"No problem! You can buy the vouchers off the website, then you just print them out and bring them to a ticket booth in Disneyland and they'll exchange for an actual ticket. I've done it before, it's super easy.  Have a great time! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask :) I love Disneyland, so any excuse to talk about it is great for me hahah."

Disneyland,39tbvz,electricladyslippers,58,Sun Jun 14 16:01:02 2015 UTC,Indoctrination and Stockholm syndrome
Disneyland,39tbvz,rebeltrooper09,21,Sun Jun 14 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"Let him choose things he wants to do. Don't force him to do much, unless he's being a sourpuss and wanting to stay in the hotel room the entire time. My suggestion is let him try things he wants to do, even outside of the park, if he looks tired, take a middle of the day nap at the hotel. Also, don't make it too hectic (planning out every ride to go to, running around, etc.), make it relaxing and fun.  Take him to California Adventure also, the access to beer and more adult rides may be something he enjoys more."
Disneyland,39tbvz,jtj313,11,Sun Jun 14 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Take your kids to see some characters early in the day so the lines aren't very long. Not only is the experience great no matter how old you are, but seeing his kids engulfed in the magic that meeting the characters creates will surely help win him over. Fantasy Faire is a great place to see the princesses. I might also suggest seeing Fantasmic. The show is perhaps the most spectacular in terms of live shows in the park, although I have yet to see the new 60th Anniversary entertainment."
Disneyland,39tbvz,lambdasaurusRex,9,Sun Jun 14 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"My husband had a similar attitude when we went over Christmas, and after that trip, he loves it.    We got an annual pass so that we could come and go as we please.  That way, if we were tired, if it was over crowded, whatever, we were able to head back to the hotel and relax.  We were in the area for 6 days visiting family.    We used uber and taxis to get to and from the parks.  No time wasted parking, waiting for shuttles, or hiking to the hotel when we were already tired.  This seems like a small thing, but the convenience factor was huge and entirely worth it.  We decided early on which attractions were must-see.  We then used a wait time app to hit those up when the lines were short.    We did some of the ""stop and rest"" rides - monorail, train around the park...gave us time to get out of the frantic pace and was really great.    We also went to ca adventure, and had a beer and a snack before walking around and just taking in the sights, again just trying to bring down the pace.      Lastly, since you're bringing the kids, I would say to let him head back to the hotel for some chill time without you.  You and the kids will be able to do things that maybe he's not too keen on, and he'll get a bit of space to himself.  He wont resent being dragged around, and you wont resent having to hold back from what you really want to do.    Using the above tactics, my husband went from ugh, Disneyland to ""when can we go back?""  I hope this helps.  :-)"
Disneyland,39tbvz,chicklette,4,Sun Jun 14 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"Take him on a Wednesday since it's the slowest when it comes to crowds, and plan ahead where you're going to go in the park(s), get fast passes for the popular rides and then get on a few rides with a reasonable wait time while you're waiting to use the passes. I would recommend park hopping tickets since DCA has so much more space to walk around in even with the crowds, and it's a nice tour to experience the history of Disney (which is what that whole park is about), the show's there are really good as well, like the Aladdin musical.  On Disneyland's side make sure to watch paint the night parade, it's easy to get a good viewing spot if you come 30-45 minutes early anywhere from Main Street to the Castle and Matterhorn."
Disneyland,39tbvz,luigifangirl,4,Sun Jun 14 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best advice.  Slow days are the best days to really enjoy the park. You can take it pretty easy since you have less time in line and don't have to endure the stress of crowds.  You can really take in more of the magic and see things you might miss when it's crowded. And the tours are a great - do those on the busier days of the trip.  When we get tired, we try to take in the more relaxing activities - watch a show, ride the train and the monorail full circle, enjoy the sit down restaurants, etc."
Disneyland,39tbvz,junkfoodvegetarian,3,Sun Jun 14 18:52:34 2015 UTC,"I would suggest letting him find his disneyland experience.  My step-mom doesn't like the parks much at all but my dad and siblings and I love it! She goes to be with us but she fills her day with going to see the shows and the entertaining rides (jungle cruise, small world, etc). She also likes looking for the best snacks too. She doesn't get sucked in by the magic of it all but she finds a way to enjoy the day because we love it so much."
Disneyland,39tbvz,shinyprettythings,2,Sun Jun 14 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe each of the kids could plan to share something they really want to do, or are really excited about, with just dad? It doesn't need to be long stretch of time, but maybe let dad spend some one on one time with each of the little ones and experience the magic through their eyes. It's harder to be grumpy when the kids are happy (sorry)."
Disneyland,39tbvz,Merma1d,2,Sun Jun 14 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions by everyone (as someone who suffers from pain issues, taking a break away from the Park midday is mandatory!). One thing that worked for me, convincing my in-laws to get their annual passes this year, is the Photopass. Buying ""all"" the pictures, including rides and character meals, in advance gives you a special lanyard that you hand to the photographers around the parks. The many cast members around the park are great at getting everyone to play along, and there is nothing to get someone more into the Disney spirit than playing with the kids."
Disneyland,39tbvz,triviadan,2,Sun Jun 14 21:02:54 2015 UTC,"Fast passes and Parent swap passes! Find a ride that he wants to go on. Let's say Star Tours (because I'm assuming he likes star wars. We all do). Get a single Fast Pass for it. When it comes time for the ride go with him and ask the attendant at the FP gate for a parent swap. If either of your kids are big enough, you might need that many FPs. He can go on the ride and when he's done, you can take the PS pass and go on yourself (and anot her rider). In the meantime, there are plenty of smaller rides he or you can do with the kiddos (rockets, autotopia, buzz). Keep in mind you can only have a single FP per ticket. So if your Husband and kid get one for one ride, you can use yours and your other child's for another ride. This cannot be used on the single rider lines."
Disneyland,39tbvz,BooRoxAlot,2,Sun Jun 14 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it has much to do with whether or not he went as a kid - my husband never did until I took him on our honeymoon and he loved it as much as I did! We've been back since and have another trip planned for next January. We just can't get enough.  That being said, I think the trick is to identify the things your husband loves the best and see how you can associate it with Disneyland and the magic therein. I know my husband loves the food at Disneyland so we love looking on yelp at the restaurants and the pictures of the dishes we will enjoy when we get there!  We also like to watch the ride throughs on Youtube - if he likes how it all runs, perhaps he'll enjoy watching some of the rides like space mountain with the lights on...  Once you get there, let him set the pace a little and let him take the kids on some of the kids rides alone. This'll give him the chance to see the magic from the kid's perspective and, if he still doesn't appreciate it for himself, he will appreciate it for them!  Definitely stay close to the park so that you can go back and forth with ease and he can chill out when he's getting overborne. Again, looking up restaurants and cafes and places to chill before you go can help so you can plan your rest stops. One of my favourite places is the lobby at the Grand Californian, the bottom level of the Hungry Bear Restaurant or even the 'secret' sitting area to the right of the Harbor Galley.  In the end, if you have done everything you can and he's still not feeling the disney magic - hopefully he is still at least excited at the idea of spending the time with you and the kids!  (My Dad is one of those types - he's not overly excited by the Disney magic but he appreciates how well run it all is and he loves the idea of spending the time with all of us. He's just not that type.)"

Disneyland,39tbvz,ClareBear,2,Mon Jun 15 08:03:31 2015 UTC,Is his sciatica under control? Being pain free might brighten his mood.  Google turmeric and sciatica and see if you want to give that a try.  My husband wasn't into Disneyland either...I just went with other people and let him stay home.
Disneyland,39tbvz,charmed2,2,Sun Jun 14 17:47:00 2015 UTC,"Your husband is not a Disney fan - which is completely fine.  According to you, he's gone to DL twice with you - the first time, ""[h]e liked it fine but didn't think it was that amazing"" - which I think is absolutely a legitimate and totally non-asshat attitude for someone who isn't a Disney fan and was probably doing it because he knew you liked it and he cares about you.  The second time, he was literally in pain.  I apologize if this comes off as an attack - it's not my intention - but it sounds like you're actually being more lame about this than he is.  Disneyland is not for everyone.  Disney is not for everyone.  It's great that you're thrilled about your next trip and the opportunity to take your kids there to hopefully get them to appreciate the park.  But, if your husband isn't into it, he's not into it.  It's not lame, it's not cynical, don't force the issue and just appreciate the fact that he cares enough about his family that he's doing this thing that he doesn't enjoy because he knows you guys all do.  And if there is something in the parks that he does discover he enjoys, let him discover it organically.  Also, speaking as someone who, like your husband, is not particularly a fan of Disney franchises but is a huge fan of theme parks - which Disney is most definitely the master at - I also appreciate how well run the parks are.  It's one of the main reasons I like the Disney parks and have an AP.  Not sarcasm."
Disneyland,39tbvz,rextraverse,3,Mon Jun 15 05:34:31 2015 UTC,You don't. Trying to make someone love something is a jerk move.   Now what you can do is ask him to please not be an ass about it. The kids are excited so could he please act like he's not put out. And if he truly feels that he can't pretend to be excited say so and he can stay at home that way he doesn't ruin the trip for everyone else.  With luck he will stop acting like you are pulling his teeth without novocaine. And on the trip he won't be a whiny baby
Disneyland,39tbvz,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:21:46 2015 UTC,I wasted a four day ticket on my brother last year.  He rarely goes on trips with us anywhere.  Anyways an hour into the first day he just kept being sour so he left and stayed in the hotel watching tv.  Thing is he loved it when we were young.  I only go cause I know my family loves it.  Without them though I doubt I would ever go.
Disneyland,39tbvz,vxteflon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:41:14 2015 UTC,"For my first time I was around 35 (I'm a DH). I was excited for my family, but went into it thinking about the costs and the chaos of making a fun trip with kids in a busy place.  I was initially a bit anxious about the trip. Flights, busses, hotels, busy parks, and everything was so expensive. Somewhere on the second or third day something clicked for me, and I started having fun. The first few hours were especially rough, with me worrying about keeping the kids close, but that melted away as I enjoyed everything about what the parks had to offer.  For me, the engineering and the artfulness of the parks was especially impressive. Things are put together well, and there is artwork everywhere. Seeing how much fun the kids had, and how child-like my wife was were also heart-melting and infectious in a good way.  We did find the food expensive and unappealing on our first trip (2007ish), but that was mostly our own ignorance as the most obvious restaurants are not our favourites. There are many gems of food in both parks, and a huge variety of foods and prices. It's still expensive, but I'm learning that the experience is valuable.  I also totally enjoyed the themed thrill rides (Space Mountain, Indy, Tower of Terror), though rides like Peter Pan are totally great too. So as a skeptical DH, the transition is mostly about realizing that it isn't just another park, and that a lot of fun can be had as an adult too.  Oh, and the beer in DCA was great on the second or third day. A tired, sore Dad + a beer is a much happier Dad.  I now look forward to our trips more than anyone else in the family, and start planning them 10-12 months in advance."

Disneyland,39qbkk,mildly_interesting,5,Sat Jun 13 18:43:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link, but that seems to be more of a pineapple shake. There are no dairy products used in the dole whips at Disneyland."
Disneyland,39qbkk,thelittlemiss,6,Sun Jun 14 00:32:13 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right. The DLR Dole Whips are vegan. You can make an exact replica by simply buying a pineapple, freezing it, and blending it with water until the consistency is right.  Some say that tastes wrong and prefer blending it with pineapple juice, but, really, it's all the same.  This recipe is nice, and it sure does sound delicious, but it isn't accurate."

Disneyland,39sh1h,TheOnlyBongo,3,Sun Jun 14 09:10:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, here is my take on this story.  Normally big deal someone is taking a picture of some kid charging his phone at Disneyland for the comical part of it.  This probably happens all the time. If the man taking the pictures was upset enough to confront TheOnlyBongo he was probably doing something wrong and not just trying to capture a funny moment.  I would say a normal person would be embarrassed about being caught taking a picture and either leave or apologize.  There was no reason for this guy to get to get upset and get aggressive with a teenager.  This is the part of the story that worries me a middle age adult should seriously know that was inappropriate even if you dislike grad nights those kids deserve to be there just like any other guest the parks that follow the rules."
Disneyland,39sh1h,iSkelly87,13,Sun Jun 14 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"One of the best bits of advice I have ever been given in life is to try and assume the best (rather than the worst) possible motive until other evidence indicates otherwise. I use this constantly with my children (they drew on the walls to express themselves), when driving (they cut me off because they weren't paying attention), and when encountering any stranger acting oddly or rudely in the real world.   It is entirely plausible that this gentleman was taking a funny photo of the teenager sitting at Disneyland too distracted by modern technology to enjoy the surroundings. Perhaps he is a member of a forum community and was planning to update a post on the best/worst bathrooms of the park. Maybe he thought the color of the building would work for the kitchen remodel and wanted to text it to his wife. It could easily be any of these things or none of them. You have no way of knowing, but it's worth pondering why you automatically went with the worst assumptions.   It is also important to note that it is perfectly legal to take photos of strangers in public settings. So long as you don't use those photos for commercial profit you are in the clear. If someone is uncomfortable with the photos being taken they can request (of property owners or law enforcement) that the photographer be removed from the area. That's it.   His response to you was far more worrisome then the act of taking photos. Then again, if you dig around on reddit you can find many postings from adult men who are frustrated with situations in public where they are treated as perverts for existing in the same space as children/teens. If this man felt you were accusing him of such, perhaps he vented some of that frustration.   I am not saying these things to excuse the man or to blame you. Sometimes in life we just get an off feeling about a situation and for better or worse we have to trust that instinct. I just thought you might appreciate a possible explanation that differed from your conclusions.  Should you find yourself in a similar situation in the future here is what I would recommend.    If at all possible, simply remove yourself from the area. This is the safest thing you can do. If you feel the other person is somehow threatening alert someone with authority once you are in a safe space. In this situation that would have been a cast member, perhaps at a ticket booth or security check in. If you are unable to leave the immediate area, simply watch and wait. In your particular situation you could have just quietly walked over to your friend (safety in numbers) and waited to see if the man moved along. You were not in obvious physical danger at any point until you drew his attention and ire. Should a situation escalate, try to calm things down and remove yourself. When he started to confront you, your main concern should have been to simply end the conversation. You gained nothing by pointing out what you had seen. Doing so actually made the situation worse. Far better to say it was a misunderstanding and move along.  If the situation escalates to the point at which you feel you are in actual physical danger at that point you run and/or scream loudly to draw attention to the situation.    To conclude, I really do feel that you over-reacted. The initial problem (man taking photos) could be explained by many possible scenarios, few of which are truly malicious. The worst thing I can think of is that your friend may have wound up as the subject of a bad internet meme. It seems you felt as though this man may have been a predator of sorts, however I think it's important to ask yourself what exactly a predator would do with a photo of a fully clothed teenager playing a 3DS that would cause harm to your friend. By calling out to your friend and then accusing the man of doing something hinky you escalated the situation."
Disneyland,39sh1h,MeishkaD,9,Sun Jun 14 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think he over-reacted, I think the gentleman taking pictures over-reacted and got extremely defensive. That is a red-flag right there."
Disneyland,39sh1h,VersaceTupperware,6,Sun Jun 14 23:26:09 2015 UTC,"First off, there is no expectation of privacy, nor was the camera operator invading your friends privacy. Disney Parks are, frankly, some of the most photographed places in the world and you have no expectation of privacy except in the restrooms and dressing rooms.   That being said, the moment I realized that the guy was taking pictures of my friend I would have moved over to where my friend was. That immediately shows that he is not alone and while there I would tell my friend what is happening, or possibly happening.   Often the best way to stop someone from doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable is to start doing it to them. You could have taken out your phone and started taking pictures of the Asian man. This would give you something to show cast members if need be and it would put him on the receiving end of the same treatment (especially if you started laughing and smiling while doing it).   After the man confronted you in such a blatant and provocative way, you definitely should have contacted a cast member."
Disneyland,39sh1h,Zandt88,2,Sun Jun 14 23:42:56 2015 UTC,I agree with this
Disneyland,39sh1h,VersaceTupperware,5,Mon Jun 15 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"I agree OP could have handled this better, but in all honesty, this man was doing something quite shady. It is obvious he wasn't taking a ""funny photo"" or one for a review on the different bathrooms around the park, especially since he was taking multiple photos like OP said. He was taking pictures of the friend for a reason that would most likely not be condoned by the friend. OP had pretty good reasons to not assume the best because with your ""best case scenarios"" eliminated with the context provided by OP, there was no situation in which this man should have been doing what he was doing. Sorry, but this guy was being weird."

Disneyland,39qx1o,Canadian_chicken,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:31:53 2015 UTC,Didn't start until May 2015 though. It could go through March and only be 10 months long. And it was totally awesome btw.
Disneyland,39qx1o,jarrettdavid11,-2,Sun Jun 14 17:17:28 2015 UTC,No it's actually going on for 18 months
Disneyland,39qk87,trumpetguy96,3,Sat Jun 13 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"I went to Disneyland last month, and also pre-ordered the PhotoPass+. I think the site said it would take up to 14 days to get the shipment but it came sooner than that. Probably closer to 8-9 days. Here is my experience with it.  You should get a package in the mail with a CD with a bunch of Disneyland stock photos on it, and inside the CD case are a couple inserts. One is a paper voucher. Bring that voucher to one of the photo shops in DL/DCA where you'll trade it in for your actual PP+ card that you can carry around and show to the photographers. The first day we were in the parks I ducked into the photo store at the end of Main St near the Plaza Inn restaurant and traded in the voucher for the PP+ card before we headed to our dinner with characters. The cast member suggested I take a picture of the card with my phone on the off-chance it got lost. You get a lanyard to keep the card on too, which was nice. I just kept my card around my neck the whole trip and didn't have to mess with fishing it out of my pockets every time we wanted a picture. The photographers will either scan the back of your card with their scanners or take a picture of it with their camera, either before or after they take your pics (usually after, if I remember right).  At some point you'll want to log into the PhotoPass site and enter your card # so it's tied to your online account and you can start seeing the pics. We ended up acquiring a couple other regular PhotoPass cards during our days in the parks (I think in one case I was holding my son in front of my card and the photographer gave us a regular card since he didn't see the PP+) but it's no big deal - you just log in and add those card #s to your account too.  Another nice perk of PP+ was getting some print packages from the two character meals we did (Goofy's Kitchen and Ariel's Grotto). We took photos with Goofy and Ariel before the meals, and before we finished up the waiter brought out prints for us to take with us. Not sure if all the other character dining experiences offer that but those two do for sure.   Make sure you save the other insert in the CD case too - inside that insert is a code to redeem all the photos tied to your PP account from the PhotoPass website. You get either a download all of the photos tied to your account, or a photo CD with your photos on it. We were impatient and opted for the download. Basically the code in the insert acts as a promo code and deducts the cost of the download or CD from your cart. It took about 1.5 hours for the email to arrive that said our download was ready. The download was 3 separate zip files (80-ish photos all together) and had our photos and a handful of other nice stock photos tossed in as well. (The stock photos relate to the images they're mixed with - for example, we saw Cinderella, Belle, and Snow White at the Royal Hall and there were stock images each princess along with the ones the photographers took of my kids with the princesses. Same with Cars Land - we got some photos taken in front of the sign at the entrance to Cars Land - so there are some nice Cars Land stock photos added in too.) I would imagine the CD is probably the same.  Also, you also are supposed to get your ride pictures from at least some of the attractions that take your picture, but we didn't end up doing any of those rides except Radiator Springs Racers, and the pic wasn't very good (couldn't see my daughter). I can't speak for how that part works but for everything else, I thought PP+ was pretty nice.  Sorry for the long response but figured since I just went through this same thing last month it would help you and anyone else who was looking at PP+.  I'd definitely buy it again - I thought it was a pretty good value between the character dining picture packages and the download (or CD). I guess you basically end up pre-paying for the download or CD but you end up saving like $20 pre-ordering it vs getting PP+ in the parks. Plus the stock photo CD you get initially is kind of nice too - it got us excited for the trip. Hope this helps!"
Disneyland,39qk87,EatingPizzaAllDay,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:50:30 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! This was a lot more clear and informative than from what I got on the website
Disneyland,39qk87,Atta76,2,Sun Jun 14 16:46:27 2015 UTC,I got mine about a week after I ordered. I live in FL.  It comes in a case the size of a DVD case. http://imgur.com/d31mjue
Disneyland,39qk87,mamamonkey,2,Sun Jun 14 11:44:41 2015 UTC,"If it hasn't changed from last year, you'll get a voucher in the mail that you can exchange for the physical card when you get there. If your dinner isn't in the park, you can get a regular photopass card at dinner and link it to Photopass+ later.   The one thing I'm not sure about is that we got some prints wth our Photopass+... I think you may miss out on those if you can't get into the park to get the Photopass+ card."
Disneyland,39qk87,valiamo,2,Sun Jun 14 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"You will receive a DVD case in the mail, and inside of this case is a coupon that you redeem at the photo booth on Main Street in DLR, or at the Camera Shop (I think) in DCR.   You do not need to bring the DVD or case, just the coupon.  They will give you a lanyard with a Photopass Card attached, and you show this to the photographers.    If you get photos before you redeem your coupon, just trade in the ticket when you get at the dinner when your photo pass + is enabled.(or any time you get a photo and you don't have your pass with you).  Make sure you hit the ride photo booths, every time you leave the rides to get the photos added to your pass, just remember the code number as you leave the rides.  We had 2 families share the pass last year, and got loads of photos from around the parks."
Disneyland,39qk87,WardenHDresden,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry to bring back an old post, but you say that you had 2 families share the pass. How did that work exactly? We have a couple of families going and were thinking about doing the same thing."
Disneyland,39qk87,valiamo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:23:02 2015 UTC,"No problem.   Easy to do, just takes some coordination.    one side of the family holds onto the lanyard, and the other gets a free photo card (from any photographer).    Once a day you meet up at one of the photo stores and get the free card added to the photo pass.      Rides photos are a bit more tricky, you have to write down the photo number from the ride photo, and go back to the ride, within 24 hours and get them added.  The only one that is hard to get at is Racers, as the photo booth is deep inside the ride exit, doable, but a long trek.  We sent the youngest racing around to add the ride photos, they had a hoot, and got away from the rest of us for a while.  If you have special character meals, take the original card with you, as you get extra photos printed and given to you."
Disneyland,39qk87,WardenHDresden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think we are going to go for it!"
Disneyland,39qk87,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:43 2015 UTC,"Everything they said and I can verify that it is possible to pick up your photopass lanyard at your character dinner. Present your coupon to the photopass photographer at the front of the restaurant and they will be able to get your lanyard and your physical prints. This may take awhile, so it might be a good idea to do this as you enter the restaurant instead of waiting until you leave."
Disneyland,39qk87,MeishkaD,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:03:27 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! I'm glad I'll be able to use the Photopass for the dinner so I don't worry about how bad my pics turn out!

Disneyland,39qcir,DDotJ,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:45:08 2015 UTC,"But they do indeed turn different colors during the intro, before the parade rolls down main street? Or is it something else flashing different colors?"
Disneyland,39o36x,femmebot08,5,Sat Jun 13 03:47:13 2015 UTC,Can you tell me more about the Lily Belle and the salt and pepper trash cans? How did you get to ride it? Where do you find the salt and pepper shakers?
Disneyland,39o36x,spikelike,2,Sat Jun 13 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"we found the salt and pepper shakers on main street in the shop near the photo place. where they sell all the crystal figurines.  we found 4 of them (fantasyland, tomorrowland, adventureland, and frontierland).  I'm not sure if there is more then that. edit : not the op, this was back in march that we found them."
Disneyland,39o36x,billypowergamer,2,Sat Jun 13 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"We made it a game to find the Salt and Pepper shakers in each of the lands. I'm sure that you could probably find all 4 at the same time at the Emporium but it was funner for us to seek them out.   As far as the Lilly Belle went, that was a little harder to get. My understanding is that when it runs, it runs twice a day with a limit of 14 people per trip. They open up reservations, which are free, an hour after the park opens at the Main Street train station but people start lining up as soon as they get in. I was lucky. I asked around 11 and they had one ticket and they were getting ready to go. I was walking with my sister-in-law at the time and we were waiting for my husband to get in the park. I wasn't going to take it but she talked me into it. I'm so glad I did (although I really wish they were with me). It was amazing. Our guide Christy really, really loves the parks and you could tell by her stories. The inside was beautiful with fresh flowers on the tables and comfy upholstered furniture. I highly recommend trying to get on if you can. It was just a lucky day for me."

Disneyland,39pfau,samsooni,7,Sat Jun 13 13:45:21 2015 UTC,I suggest checking out the aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. There is also the discovery cube in Orange County that is really close to Disneyland that you may also be fun for the 2 year old.
Disneyland,39pfau,iSkelly87,3,Sat Jun 13 16:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'll piggy back on this. By the aquarium there is a place called ""Shoreline Village"". I no longer live in CA, but every time we go I make an effort to take my kids there because my parents used to take my brothers and me there on the weekends. It's a nice place to walk around the boardwalk, see the ocean and have lunch (or visit the frozen yogurt place that has been open since I was a little kid, I'm 30 now)."
Disneyland,39pfau,CobraCommanderp,2,Sat Jun 13 16:53:43 2015 UTC,Oh thanks for the suggestion. I'll have to take my kids here next time we go to the aquarium.
Disneyland,39pfau,iSkelly87,3,Sat Jun 13 17:02:56 2015 UTC,Was just about to second the Aquarium in Long Beach. My wife and I had a rental car for a day on our honeymoon and ended up spending a majority of the day there and at the shops nearby. Super fun place!
Disneyland,39pfau,Eboy503,6,Sat Jun 13 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"We really enjoyed the California Science Centre. http://californiasciencecenter.org/ Because SPACESHIP! Even if you child doesn't like spaceships, there was lots to do. My kids liked the aquarium and the flash flood exhibit.  There was a room more geared towards younger kids but we didn't go into it.  We actually really liked Legoland... they had a nice little waterpark and a pretty decent aquarium (for someone who lives on the prairies and doesn't see many aquariums).  Tons geared towards younger kids - dino ""excavation"" sandbox, playgrounds, interactive music things were all hits."

I know that your 2 yo would love the sand and surf.     If you have a need to ""see"" something unique, head north to Long Beach and see the Queen Mary or the Spruce Goose.    We did a beach and shopping day last October, and headed north to Santa Monica, was a looonnnggg drive.  Tho, not much to do with a young child.  Sea world in San Degio is also a nice day trip."

Disneyland,39pxtc,progress_dad,10,Sat Jun 13 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"As a heads-up: Asking about this sort of thing is somewhat iffy -- in general, us mods don't like discussing this sort of thing since it inevitably leads to people PMing myself or other cast members asking if we can get them in (which results in a ban for the people requesting it). We do have a zero-tolerance policy regarding this sort of stuff, since signing in non-family members can get the CM in trouble, and most CMs get annoyed by all the people asking.  Since this isn't a request for a sign-in, I'm going to go ahead and approve it -- however, I do want to put that out there in the event that we get any kind of similar requests.  That being said, CMs are allowed to get 3 people in per day, 16 times per year. You should be okay."

Disneyland,39o098,Thmcdonald1,7,Sat Jun 13 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"Yes/No, there are no ""VIP"" spots for either that are available to the general public.  If you are willing to spend a LOT of money you can hire a VIP guide for the day. They range from $350-$500 an hour depending on the season (given that you are going to be there on the actual Anniversary figre it will be closer to $500 than $350) and have a minimum of 6 hours (so between $2100 and $3000 for the day) that will put you in the ""VIP"" section for the fireworks (and I believe the first showing of Paint the Night). It also gives you a pretty much permanent fast pass for the day.  Other than that there is no real guarantee.  My suggestion since you are going to be at the park for 4 days is to do the parade/fireworks either the 16th or the 20th if possible. Those will probably be the lightest days since the 17th is the Anniversarry, and the 18th and 19th are weekends.   Start scoping out spots at about 4ish in case thigns start filling up super early. I'd be sure to be in your spot by 6:30ish just to be sure you get a good one. It may suck having to wait 2-2.5 hours but the good news is it's great people watching and the shows are totally worth it.   ProTip: Try to be midway down Main Street for the Fireworks. If you are need the Arcade/Candy Palace you can still see the castle and the projections and are surrounded by the projections on Main Street."

Disneyland,39o098,browncoat41,3,Sat Jun 13 04:14:17 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I went a couple weeks ago. We left the park to grab some dinner and came back about 10 minutes before the fireworks were supposed to start. We ended up nabbing some decent spots just in front of the train station and were able to see the fireworks really well, and then grabbed a bench for the second viewing of the parade. We only waited for about an hour and were right up front. It could have been good luck, but you might try it out."
Disneyland,39o098,catrain,2,Sat Jun 13 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"We have VIP viewing for both paint the night and Disneyland forever. If you are avoiding the cost, make friends with a parades cast member. We very often surprise guests with VIP seats (if there is room) or little knick knacks if they were really nice and chatted with us for longer than they should have. It's not a guarantee, but we always go out of our way to make someone's day if they made ours.  Edit: I'm going to say town square, main street, plaza (adventureland) cast members. I don't think tomorrowland people do this"
Disneyland,39o098,95688it,0,Wed Jun 17 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"no. that's only available for world of color and fantasmic, there is no premium/VIP viewing area for the parade and fireworks."

Disneyland,39nqp2,Mattock79,3,Sat Jun 13 01:48:43 2015 UTC,"The River Belle option is reasonable and, unlike Bayou, easy to get seats for even on the day of. The food is good and the service is great since it's not really busy :). You get ""worse"" seats than the Blue Bayou folks but you're literally 10-20 feet to their side for much less spend. Oh, with the Blue Bayou one you get a super thin plasticy butt-cushion that is basically useless. They are ""souvenirs"" but we just gave ours to a family with kids sitting a bit over from us.   Source: did both back in March."
Disneyland,39nqp2,Tofinochris,3,Sat Jun 13 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"Basically it works like this:  Pick your restaurant and select the WoC Dining option.   You are allowed to choose from a Pre-Fixe menu for a set price. At the end of your meal you get the check along with Fast Passes for the show.   The layout is like this:  Front and center is the Blue Bayou section of seating (directly in front of the ""stage"" on Tom Sawyer/Pirate's Lair Island) to their side (not sure which) is the river belle seating, and so on.   On the far left and right sides are the ""general seating"" sections. We were in the blue (I think section) and it was very far to the right side of the island (basically in front of Haunted Mansion). I should note we were in the DAS section and honestly as someone who had seen the show I hated it.   We were 90 degrees off center from the stage which basically make the Pinocchio part of the show pointless (since we were viewing ti from the side and the figures are flat) and parts of the show were completely obstructed by the lighting towers.   From now on I'm doing a dining package, but I also don't enjoy Fantasmic as much as the other shows so it's probably only a 1-2 time a year thing for me.   All that aside, do yourself a favor and don't write off the new firework show. It's by far the very best they have ever done and you should make a point to see it from Main Street."
Disneyland,39nqp2,Shatteredreality,3,Sat Jun 13 05:01:09 2015 UTC,"We just did the Blue Bayou Dinner Package and it was a great experience. I had the gumbo, filet mignon, and a taste of all three desserts. Everyone was delicious. The tickets for the package were for the best spot front and center. The sections are no standing zones so the little cushions help with the textured brick floor. You can get to the sections as soon as they open the blue area (1 hour before the show) even though the tickets say (45-15 mins before). I have never had such amazing seats in all of these years of seeing the show. Enjoy!"
Disneyland,39nqp2,izookie,3,Sat Jun 13 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"We did the Blue Bayou package just a few days ago and we loved it! The food is great, the atmosphere is wonderful. We also got the most pleasant server I've ever encountered (her name is Linda, sweetest lady ever). They do ask you which show you prefer and give you the fastpass for that show.   We went to the later show and got there less than 30 min before the show started. There's still plenty of room (while people in other sections are PACKED), we got a good ""seat"", our section was at the front and dead center, saw the show with no obstructions at all. We actually really liked the butt-cushion and thought it was pretty thick (maybe our expectations were low from reading the reviews about them, but it looked a bit different than the reviews, maybe they changed it recently), I definitely prefer sitting on them than on the floor and wished that we had it when we were waiting for WoC as well."
Disneyland,39nqp2,notplanningatripshh,2,Mon Jun 15 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"I did the on the go meal at Aladdin's Oasis in May, Fantasmic was only running the night I arrived in Anaheim but since I was arriving late I wanted to make sure I got a fast pass. I had my choice of the early or late shows, the food was great.   The viewing section that you get with it wasn't great, but perhaps if I'd arrived exactly on time to get in line I would have had better luck. I think the other dining options have better viewing areas but I haven't tried them yet.   I miss Fantasmic before fast passes arrived, where I could show up half an hour before and sit in the smoking patio and have a great, albeit off center, view. Though I do appreciate the area not being mobbed as people saved seats hours before."
Disneyland,39oh1k,undernova,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:14:45 2015 UTC,"Leave earlier. The best time to be at the parks is at oppening. Go to the back of either park and get all the E-tickets done first.

Disneyland,39n79b,fritzandreas,14,Sun Jun 14 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you'll be interested, but a friend of mine (who is trans and went through Disney College Program) took some time to note gender neutral bathrooms in the park. He found that the bathrooms marked ""Companion Bathrooms"" on the map are single stall, gender neutral bathrooms. He felt more comfortable using them than the gendered bathrooms and having to possibly deal with any rude guests in that situation when he was at the park. https://disneyland.disney.go.com/media/dlr_nextgen/SiteCatalog/PDF/DisneylandParkMap_20130307.pdf  Otherwise, you shouldn't be bothered by CMs and if a guest is bothering you, talk to a CM. No guest should ruin the magic for another guest! Have loads of fun and know that (to paraphrase Walt) you are welcome; Disneyland is your land!"
Disneyland,39n79b,beanarhino,9,Sat Jun 13 04:56:23 2015 UTC,"Of course! I can't really say exactly, because I don't really know if someone is trans unless they tell me. However there are lots of gay couples holding hands (of all genders) and honestly people are too distracted to care.   If someone does say something rude to you, I strongly advise telling a cast member. Try to remember a general idea of what they look like and where they were. I'm not sure exactly what they'll do."

Disneyland,39n79b,Shatteredreality,7,Sat Jun 13 04:26:01 2015 UTC,As someone who crowd watches a lot I don't think many people will care at all! Honestly there are so many people that unless someone is bringing a lot of attention to them selves I probably wouldn't notice if something was different or not about them.   Also keep in mind that it's a very expensive ticket to get in the door and if anyone makes it a non-magical day for you then tell a CM. They can help a lot as well and ensure the those who are harassing other guests are dealt with.
Disneyland,39n79b,progress_dad,3,Sat Jun 13 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. 3 Trans people at my work location, one of which just made the transition official in the workplace. Managers were great with it! Guests don't ever really notice anything going on around them."

I'll bet that executives haven't put thought into that yet"
Disneyland,39jy31,Capt_Triskal,7,Fri Jun 12 06:40:37 2015 UTC,"I would also say to send a compliment to the Cast Members that you don't actually notice, the ones just doing their job to keep the Magic happening like the street sweeper taking care of the popcorn on the floor, bussers clearing the tables quickly, or the shop keeper organizing and refolding the same table of shirts for 8 hours."

Disneyland,39jy31,MyDisneyExperience,10,Fri Jun 12 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you're familiar with Maynard -- he's a CM who's been around for ages and does a lot of guest interaction stuff. He works a lot of Tiki Room and Opera House, and annual passholders tend to post on social media when he's at the Tiki Room. Tiki suddenly gets a lot more traffic than usual and lots of requests to have Maynard wake up Jose.  Anyway, I've been told that Maynard recently hit his 100th guest compliment, and the Adventureland managers threw a party and took him out to lunch to celebrate.  I don't think anyone in Tomorrowland has quite that many compliments -- I think some of the Star Tours leads have 20 or 30, and one of the Autopia leads has around 35, I believe. I haven't heard of us getting any kind of party, although Star Tours itself might throw a party for someone who gets a bunch of guest compliments."

Disneyland,39jy31,ga_to_ca,2,Sat Jun 13 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"I love giving compliments to cast members.  And the CMs in city hall always seem happy that you're giving a compliment as opposed to a complaint.  I have a question though.  One time, a CM at Peter Pan saw me and a friend looking at the wait time (about 40 min) and debating whether or not to ride.  He asked if we wanted to skip the line entirely.  Of course we said yes.  When we went to give him a compliment later, we didn't know if it was ""kosher"" to mention that he had taken us to the front of the line just because.  I didn't want to get someone in trouble for doing something nice, even though I'm sure he wouldn't have done that if he weren't allowed.  Is it okay to say exactly why you're giving a compliment no matter what they did?"
Disneyland,39jy31,ga_to_ca,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:50:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!  I'll keep those guidelines in mind.  Getting someone into the VIP section would be the exact kind of thing I would question being able to say.

Disneyland,39jy31,EnglishMobster,3,Sat Jun 13 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"A couple ways:  The first is just to write a letter to Guest Relations and mail it to the following address:  Disneyland Guest Relations 1313 Disneyland Drive, Anaheim, CA 92802   Include all that information in your letter, including the date and times of things if you have them.  You can also call Guest Relations at (714) 781-4636. Just explain that you want to give a guest compliment and they should get you sorted out.  Finally, you can email Guest Relations here. They should get back to you if they need any more information regarding a guest compliment.  Now, I have only had in-person compliments reach me. I don't know if I've simply never had anyone try to compliment me through other channels or if the other channels aren't as reliable.  Star Tours has a few letters we've received that are directed towards the whole cast -- one was about how a guest was very sick and loved Star Wars and about how we really made their day, and a second one was from a very young girl who wrote a letter to R2-D2 and C3PO thanking them for saving her in the Starspeeder and then a P.S. wondering how much she will get paid if she had a job as a Star Tours cast member. The second one's my favorite letter ever -- it's all handwritten and she drew a picture of C3PO and R2-D2 on it."

Not that it matters but I am so glad you guys get something like that for the great work you do. I only wish I could throw a pizza party or something for you! :)
Disneyland,39jy31,Techsupportvictim,11,Fri Jun 12 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"Don't be a dick. That is probably the single most important thing anyone can do.  Follow the rules, don't give attitude, etc.  Especially around the parade route. If a CM tells you you can't stand there or can't sit there, move on. I see more assholes around the parade route than any other place. I get that you didn't want to sit out there for three hours to get a good spot, but that doesn't mean you can stand wherever."
Disneyland,39jy31,kidgun,7,Fri Jun 12 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Realize that how we do things might have changed since you've last been there. Towards the end of last year we were experimenting with different traffic flow for Fantasmic! I can't tell you how many times cast members were ignored because the first said, ""I used to be able to walk this way so I will anyway."" Then we'd just watch as they went against flow of traffic down a narrow walkway, only to turn back when a guest using an ECV blocked their way."

Disneyland,39ndl7,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Sat Jun 13 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"Hi! My Gradnite was two weeks ago, and Disney California Adventures usually has the most teens running around. I think around 10pm is when they start kicking the regulars out of DCA, so around 10-12pm is the best place to be at Disneyland because there's not a lot of people from Gradnite. I was at Disneyland just last night and all the Gradnite kids had disappeared from the Disneyland park around this time. The only bad thing is, all the big events are happening around this time like the Fireworks, the Paint the Night parade, and Fantasmic so some areas like Main Street get really crowded! Lines aren't as bad though, so that's a plus!  Some of the major rides that Gradnite kids usually go on (and become very obnoxious) are: California Screamin', Tower of Terror, Radiator Springs, Space Mountain, and Splash Mountain.  I'm sure there's more rides where more Gradnite people become rowdy, but those were the worst for me when I went. Hope this helps a little bit!  Edit: I mean 10-12 midnight :)"
Disneyland,39ndl7,eiramjy,2,Sat Jun 13 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"Was just there last weekend and I definitely noticed the grad-night kids.  I'm sure most of them were fine (and therefore, not noticeable) but the ones that were really stood out.  Line jumping (in large groups... one or two kids would suddenly be joined by 20 of their friends after we'd already been in line behind them for better than an hour) rowdiness/shoving/rough housing, and stuff I probably would have been uncomfortable having young children around (language, making out in line, etc).  They were in the park right up till we left just before midnight, but I saw some kids told they couldn't ride rides they'd waited in line for because it was after 10.    I would say you can't avoid them, and you should just be prepared to be annoyed from time to time.  Nothing really seriously scary, just annoying."

When I was 12, we made my younger brother (11) go on Tower of Terror for the first time.   He hated it.   There was zero line so we decided to go again, and the bellhop (the same one we had the first time) noticed my brother wasn't too keen on going on the ride, so she offered to have him wait with her while the rest of the family went on it.   So the rest of the family goes on the ride in a nearly-full elevator, and at the end when the doors open, my 11-year old brother is standing there instead of the bellhop, and he just says ""Hi!""   Everyone in the elevator that wasn't my family jumps a little, and a couple of people even screamed! Then everyone laughed when they realized it was just a normal kid. :) It was super funny, and also a great example of a CM going above and beyond.

My daughter(6) pointed out Minnie's diamond necklace. My SIL said something about wondering where she got such a pretty necklace. I said ""Well, Mickey owns this place, so I'm sure he bought it for her."" SIL said something about how they weren't married yet and I said you'd think after 60 years they would be. That's when I noticed a cast member walking in step with us, he said ""He hasn't put a ring on it yet!"" And then disappeared into the crowd.  The two of us were cracking up."

Since the little one will keep you from riding the E-ticket rides you'll be relegated to the smaller attractions, which can be just as enjoyable. My 2 year old loves The Jungle Cruise, Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Winnie The Pooh, Astro Blasters and The Astro Orbiter, though that one can be a bit scary for him when he pulls down on The control and he starts to feel the G force of traveling out of earths atmosphere. Most of the kiddie rides tend to be about 10-20 minute waits while Pirates, Jungle Cruise and Haunted Mansion can go 45+ I'm sure I'm forgetting tons of stuff but I'm nursing a raging migraine and my little man is fighting bedtime. I will add that MouseWait is a great app that gives you user posted updated wait times for rides and food lines but you can always ask a cast member at any info location for accurate wait times."

Due to the raining Florida weather along with the expectation of water rides, I put my phone in a ziplock plastic bag.  Unfortunately this made my phone slippery while in my pockets, and it happened to fall out while I was on the ride.  After cleaning/drying off in the bathroom I noticed that it was missing and talked to one of the workers.    They had me look at the pictures taken right before you drop, and identified which log I was on.  They sent me to another worker near the exit of the ride, who phoned up another employee who was working the loading and unloading of passengers.  10 minutes later after worrying about a ruined vacation, I see one of the employees walking towards the exit with phone in hand!  The bag was a little roughed up and the phone a little moist but it was not soaked and still operational.  Those guys were awesome!"

Disneyland,39ikxc,fwambo42,7,Thu Jun 11 23:34:46 2015 UTC,I just took my 5 year old in January and  it really depends on your child.  The only ride my daughter did not want to go on was Tower of Terror and none of the other rides she went on spooked her out.  She even loved Space Mountain!  EDIT:  A great idea is to look at the youtube video's of some of the scarier rides with your daughter.  She might be able to handle them after seeing a video.
Disneyland,39ikxc,NeedsWhiskey,3,Fri Jun 12 02:27:53 2015 UTC,That's a great idea.  I'll see if I can do that.
Disneyland,39ikxc,tenshi_73,3,Fri Jun 12 02:37:30 2015 UTC,I don't have any personal expirience but I always hear people talking bout how their kids did not like the Snow White ride and the Mr. Toad ride in Fantasyland. I've been on them and they do seem like they would be a little too freeky for kids.
Disneyland,39ikxc,wamoc,2,Fri Jun 12 00:01:02 2015 UTC,When my niece was 5 she loved riding Mr. Toad
Disneyland,39ikxc,tenshi_73,2,Fri Jun 12 13:22:34 2015 UTC,I'm sure many kids don't mind it. But from what OP said about how the Haunted Mansion would be a no-go for their kid I felt Mr. Toad probably wouldn't either since they seem some what similar.
Disneyland,39ikxc,tenshi_73,2,Fri Jun 12 16:56:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback.  I have no idea what those rides even are...
Disneyland,39ikxc,Halloweener58,2,Fri Jun 12 00:02:41 2015 UTC,"Snow White's Scary Adventure  and   Mr Toads Wild Ride  They are both dark rides. I had hear that for the Snow White ride they had to add ""Scary"" to the name because people would go on it with their kids and be surprised that it was spookier than expected."
Disneyland,39ikxc,ArtemisAvenged2,2,Fri Jun 12 00:12:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links!  Yeah, I think we'll be skipping those for now."
Disneyland,39ikxc,Sunshine145,2,Fri Jun 12 00:18:16 2015 UTC,Haunted Mansion is one of my daughter's favorite rides and she went for the first time at three-years-old! It's definitely a GO! :)
Disneyland,39ikxc,kethryvis,2,Fri Jun 12 02:21:22 2015 UTC,It's really hard to gauge a child's first time to disneyland what they will/won't like. For example me and my girl friend took her 4 year old sister for her birthday just two days ago.  Loved Space mountain but terrified of Big Thunder! Loved Haunted Mansion but Tom Sawyers Islands caves scared her!
Disneyland,39ikxc,SmartestDumbTeen,2,Sat Jun 13 17:50:01 2015 UTC,Haunted Mansion is not a no-go.
Disneyland,39ikxc,foxhound-mgs,7,Fri Jun 12 00:31:37 2015 UTC,i took my goddaughter on Haunted Mansion her first visit. She was a month away from being five.  All kids are different; it really depends on your kid and what their tolerance for such things are.
Disneyland,39ikxc,MaLaCoiD,6,Fri Jun 12 04:44:41 2015 UTC,"When my nephew was 3-4 and we first took him, he was absolutely enamored with that ride. He loved every part of it and didn't cringe when ghosts popped up from behind the headstones like I still do at 17 years old. Besides, it is one of the best rides at the park and not riding it would be a travesty (jk)."
Disneyland,39ikxc,TaylorAtWork,2,Fri Jun 12 01:13:00 2015 UTC,A bagpack with snacks to wait in line. Don't forget your hat and some sunscreen because its July and it will probably be hot. Your daughter will enjoy the carousel and the train that goes around the park.

Disneyland,39iezt,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:09:15 2015 UTC,It's deducted automatically. You can call the AP hotline and get them to change the card it is taken from... or pay off the balance at any time.
Disneyland,39iezt,trailer_trash_dreams,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"It's a direct debit. The amount will deducted from the card you gave them upon check out. If you need to change it, you will need to call them directly. Unless it's changed recently, you can't manage that payment online though I suspect that will change soon because the last time I had to call, the CM asked me at the end if the option had been available, would I have managed it online. I gave her an enthusiastic yes."
Disneyland,39hzqh,skinsballr,3,Thu Jun 11 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"Since the World of Color Fastpass is in California Adventure, does that mean that one has to have a CA ticket as well (meaning, I would have to buy a Park Hopper pass beforehand)? Yes you do need a park-hopper, or a one-park ticket if you only plan on going to CA Adventure. The World of Color show takes place in that park as well.  I'm not much of a roller-coaster fan, so what are the next-best rides at Disneyland/California Adventure? Aside from California Screamin' (CA Adventure) and Space Mountain (Disneyland), there's no real roller-coaster type rides. Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, Star Tours, and Small World are all classics. Then there's Midway Mania, Soarin' over California, and the new Radiator Springs Racers.  I'm only spending a day there, so if I get a Park Hopper, is there enough time to go on some rides as well as walk around the parks? Or should I just stick to Disneyland or California Adventure? Normally I'd say yes, but you are going during the summer time peak. If you aren't too concerned with going on every single ride, go ahead and get the park hopper.   Hope this helped, have fun! :)"
Disneyland,39hzqh,KeepinItLoki,3,Thu Jun 11 21:44:53 2015 UTC,"I would totally join you, but I'll be there this weekend instead of next! (Las Vegas resident). You'll have a blast regardless.    Yes, you'll have to purchase a park hopper to see the World of Color. The Fastpass and the show are both inside California Adventure.  There are a ton of non-rollercoaster rides in both parks. Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Tower of Terror, Soarin, Midway Mania the list goes on and on. Even the roller-coasters that they do have aren't as bad as ones in other theme parks. Space Mountain is definitely worth a try. California Screamin' is the only rollercoaster that goes upside down in both parks. Radiator Springs Racers seems like a roller coaster, but is more like a giant slot car track. It's not that bad at all. RSR is worth it for the Cars animatronics alone inside the ride. It's amazing. You can do a lot in a single day, especially since both parks close really late on peak season. The trick is to keep using Fastpasses and to get everything done as early as you can. When the afternoon hits, the lines will get longer. Radiator Springs Racers is the longest line in both parks, so it's great to get there as early as you can to grab a fastpass to get that out of the way. Midway Mania is also a line that does not have fastpass but is mostly a consistant 45min-1hr wait times. I would hit that up very early as well.   Let me know if you have any other questions, and have a blast! Disneyland has changed A LOT since the early 90's. You'll see how far they have come technology wise.  EDIT: I also forgot, if you do end up going alone you can do single rider lines for the big rides in which you could most definitely do all the good rides in both parks in a day."
Disneyland,39hzqh,thatcaveman,3,Thu Jun 11 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"I'd totally join you if I didn't have kids (Disneyland with kids an entirely different experience - not bad, just different.)   To answer your questions - yes you'll need a park hopper ticket for both parks to see World of Color. CA Adventure recently re-opened a few rides, including Soarin over California and one of the water rides. The only ""fast"" rides in CA Adventure are are Tower of Terror and California Screamin (although it's fast and has loops, it's suuuper smooth - I recommend you at least try it.) The new Cars Radiator Racers ride is supposed to be a ton of fun, but I've never been able to get on. If it's something you're interested in, get to the park first thing and get a fast pass. Other points of interest are the Aladdin show (surprisingly fun) and Midway Mania. FWIW I think the soft serve ice cream on Paradise Peer is worth the price of admission for California Adventure!  Disneyland is Disneyland. Expect to wait an hour for the more popular attractions (Space Mountain, Matterhorn, and Big Thunder Mountain are the roller coaster rides, though they're super mild compared to other parks/attractions.) If you don't want to do any coasters, Star Tours, Jungle Cruise, Autopia, Pirates, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, Peter Pan, and Mark Twain's Riverboat are all fun.   My advice is to get there early, it will be packed on June 20. It will also probably be hot - duck into It's a Small World or Pirates to get a reprieve from the heat."
Disneyland,39hzqh,infiniteloop33,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:51:47 2015 UTC,Peter Pan is closed currently- due open sometime in July. Tiki room or Abe Lincoln are also good places to beat the heat.
Disneyland,39hzqh,MaLaCoiD,2,Fri Jun 12 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"Both Disneyland and California Adventure within one day will be an undertaking at this time of year. I'd suggest picking one.

Disneyland,39hzqh,ibangonkeytars,2,Thu Jun 11 21:35:51 2015 UTC,"If you want to see World of Color you need to have admission to California Adventure, regardless of whether you get a Fastpass."

We normally do Disneyland and DCA 7ish times a year (from the Bay area) but this year we went to Disneyworld for 10 days and only 3 trips to Disneyland. Totally worth it with free parking, hotel discounts, merch discounts and food discounts, well as Disneyland, not Disneyworld, though I think we got a discount on the Tables of Wonderland pass too so that was really worth it.   On a side note, I'd take Disneyland and DCA over all the parks in DisneyWorld any day. World lacks CM enthusiasm and Disney magic. Disneyland and DCA are the best IMO. I just wish we had the countries part of Epcot!"
Disneyland,39bjvl,elmatador12,2,Wed Jun 10 23:50:43 2015 UTC,"I was upset at some of the ""discounts"" for dining at WDW, but I am probably going to use this to get the TIW card.

Disneyland,39bjvl,AressVeran,3,Thu Jun 11 07:05:47 2015 UTC,Can i ask how often you expect to go to both Disneyland and Disney World?   I've been thinking about buying the Premier Pass the year i decide to go to Disney World.
Disneyland,39bjvl,dewdrinker19,3,Wed Jun 10 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"If you're going to get a Premium pass anyways, the cost to upgrade is $320 plus FL tax on the upgrade fee.  Without account for the tax (as I don't know that number off the top of my head) you'll break even if you were going to buy a 3-day park hopper in Orlando.  That's assuming you don't qualify for ticket discounts via your employer or some other agency. But for me at least, it was a good deal."
Disneyland,39bjvl,lbcsax,2,Thu Jun 11 01:32:45 2015 UTC,We live in Southern California and go to Disneyland at least 2-3 each month. We got these cause we will be going to WDW for 2 weeks for our anniversary and it was cheaper than 13 day park hopper w/ water parks and it has the discounts (which we already used on our hotel).
Disneyland,39bjvl,M3wThr33,3,Thu Jun 11 07:05:11 2015 UTC,"We live in Alaska and have the premier passport. We usually make it to Orlando for a week, plus a day or two else time during the year. Add on 2-3 weekend trips to LA and it pays for itself!"
Disneyland,39bjvl,acScience,5,Wed Jun 10 21:07:43 2015 UTC,TIL: It's only ~$300 more to do this (assuming you live in Florida) than the regular Passport.  TIL 2: The Florida Passport at only ~ $50 more than the California Passport is a HECK of a better deal. Twice the number of parks and then some! [Shakes fist at Disneyland Resort for unfair ticket pricing but still joyfully visits the parks. :-) ]  Curious: Does your job take you back-n-forth between the two states?
Disneyland,39bjvl,golf4miami,3,Wed Jun 10 21:02:35 2015 UTC,Is there a number of attractions comparison somewhere? I did a search but came up empty handed.  I'm curious at a dollars per attraction price of WDW vs DLR.
Disneyland,39bjvl,acScience,3,Wed Jun 10 23:28:07 2015 UTC,"There are almost twice as many people who live in CA than FL. The fact that there are twice as many parks and half as many people means the supply of theme parks is much, much more than CA. Therefore it makes sense that there would be a lower price per park IMO."
Disneyland,39bjvl,elmatador12,2,Wed Jun 10 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"Disneyland gives a 20% discount on merch and 15% off nearly all food. 10% off of media. WDW is 10% on merchandise, and 10% on food on WEEKDAYS, BEFORE 2PM at sit-down restaurants ONLY."
Disneyland,39bjvl,Yo0426,2,Thu Jun 11 01:24:01 2015 UTC,We love Disney and go to Disneyland regularly (we both had Premium AP) but we got this cause we are going for 2 weeks for our anniversary this summer and may return around Christmas.

Disneyland,39ek3v,ranoutofbacon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"I agree that Tomorrowland has lost the Woah factor for sure. I get it when I see Big Thunder Mountain, Fantasyland, The Castle and Main Street. But Tomorrowland and Adventureland don't really do it anymore. Tomorrowland in particular is meant to place you in awe, but it needs some love. I feel though that Toontown may need it more."

Disneyland,39ek3v,RainbowMagicSparkles,0,Thu Jun 11 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry the online map is a bit old, still shows Cpt. EO in place.  And I think Innoventions is becoming some Marvel Universe thing. Not what TL needs."

Disneyland,39c9aw,stupidface5000,3,Thu Jun 11 05:20:43 2015 UTC,"Here goes: their regular season three course prix fixe menu is quite excellent. Starts with a small salad, moves onto an 8 ounce steak, and finishes with a creme brûlée. $65 if I remember correctly. I also greatly enjoyed their porter house and crab cakes. The latter is an appetizer but you can ask to have it be your entree and they'll make it more entree-ish for an extra fee. (I think that meant you got more or larger crab cakes than the appetizer version) As for desserts, the one I've tried outside the course menu was the 24 layer chocolate cake. It's huge; you have been warned.   That said, really everything on the menu is wonderful. This is one of my favourite restaurants in the whole resort."

Disneyland,39c9aw,mreford,2,Thu Jun 11 05:16:52 2015 UTC,"I had the filet and the porterhouse, and both were excellent.  When you select a doneness of your steak, expect that they will deliver it exactly how you ordered.  Here is a handy picture: http://www.enkivillage.com/s/upload/images/ef2842ac414a075b58cf7705eb9010cf.jpg  The first time I ate there I ordered a medium rare, although I wanted a medium and didn't know it.  Most other restaurants a medium rare is a pink in the middle because they can't cook a steak right.  Steakhouse 55 will not make this mistake.  I've been there twice where someone in my group was celebrating a birthday.  They were wearing their birthday pin they got from City Hall in DL, and got a free dessert out of it, so grab some anniversary pins before you go."

We had planned to go the ESPN zone in dtd to watch USA play, but traffic out of LA precluded us from accomplishing that goal. So she was really upset about that.   We went home and relaxed for a bit, and I asked if she still wanted to go to maybe catch the fireworks and head to Trader Sam's for a kungaloosh.  Parked by 815pm, headed to DCA and picked up a present for her at Off The Page (Tangled painting thingy of the lantern scene) somehow she was distracted so I could grab it without her knowing. And then tried to grab a Just Engaged pin but only to find those are WDW pins only... settled for the Happily Ever After pin.  Went back to disneyland, showed her the painting thingy, she cried, got a spot for fireworks near Coca-Cola corner, and when the tangled sequence started I handed her a ""happily ever after pin"" and said you'll probably be needing this. She kissed me and returned to watching the fireworks. About halfway through the tangled sequence, I turned her around and got down on my knee.   She said yes.  Edit : after the yes, we rode Dumbo, her childhood favorite ride. Then monorailed over to Trader Sams where our favorite CM Server (David) was working.

Disneyland,39ay10,pizzabears,4,Wed Jun 10 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"Coming from WDW, I think you'll find you can cover a lot of ground in one day. Not having to spend 30-60 minutes hopping from one park to the next is a massive time saver, so you've got that working in your favor.  It looks like the difference in price from a 2-day to 3-day ticket is $50 and you get access to a Magic Morning (similar to Extra Magic Hours in Florida). For me, I'd say it is probably worth it.  But I also don't think after 2 full days you'll feel as if there was a ton you couldn't get to. So... I'd say helpful, but not necessary.  I've taken many enjoyable trips with others that only entailed one day in the parks and the value always feels high."
Disneyland,39ay10,stevensokulski,2,Wed Jun 10 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"I think essentially, I am going to be going for about 2.5 days, so I think 3 might be the way to go. thank you!"
Disneyland,39ay10,Lollybrubs,3,Wed Jun 10 19:44:09 2015 UTC,I recommend three days. I have done two and left feeling like there was a lot I wish I had done. However with three days I don't know if park hoppers are a must. I would do two days in Disneyland and a day in California Adventure. I suggest talking to the couple you are meeting on your last day and see what rides they really want to do so if you don't waste time doing those before they get there and then have to repeat. I also recommend doing the paint the night your first partial day there and then get fast passes for Fantasmic in the morning of the second day so you can see that that night. It's underrated and my husbands favorite show. I love them all so can't pick my favorite.
Disneyland,39ay10,lookuplookdown,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:14:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! I am hesitant about Fantasmic because I'm not a huge fan of the WDW version. I heard this one's more enjoyable though. I'm willing to give it a chance :) :) Paint the Night on the first partial day is a great idea!
Disneyland,39ay10,The_Unsung_81,3,Wed Jun 10 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"Three days for sure.  Even if you can squeeze everything into two days, you certainly won't regret splurging on the extra day.  Plus, knowing you have a third day will help you relax a bit and enjoy all three days at a more leisurely pace.  I don't expect that three days will feel too long but two days may feel too short."

Disneyland,399ce5,izookie,5,Thu Jun 11 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"It's not Disney's to call. The Anaheim Fire Department decides if it's a go or not, and if the winds are too strong at a higher elevation, they cancel it."
Disneyland,399ce5,stormeegedon,3,Wed Jun 10 16:10:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Disneyland FD makes the call. They inflate tracer balloons several times in the hours leading up to pyro and release them to check wind speed and direction. Strong winds coming out of the east last night was very unusual and likely contributed to the cancellation."

Disneyland,398rr0,XirdenStone,3,Wed Jun 10 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"They don't quite run out in an hour anymore, but they do run out pretty fast. i was there yesterday around 10am and we got Fast Passes for Racers, return time 3-4pm. So they last a little longer than they did say a year ago, but still run out fast. Make it your first stop for sure!"
Disneyland,398rr0,kethryvis,2,Wed Jun 10 05:22:33 2015 UTC,Okay! I'm thinking about doing this on the second day. Thanks for your help!!
Disneyland,398rr0,XirdenStone,3,Wed Jun 10 03:36:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely do not skip the fastpass for that ride, its a very fun ride and is the longest line in Disneyland."
Disneyland,398rr0,Prophoto2,4,Wed Jun 10 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"Work those fast passes! Like for real. Fast pass one of the busier rides,  then go wait in line for another ride.  Do that as much as possible. I could give you a list on both parks of which rides are ideal to fast pass if you want as well, but if you keep that in mind you should be able to hit pretty much everything.  As far as shows,  paint the night and fantasmic (especially fantasmic!)  are both must sees in my opinion.  (you can fast pass fantasmic as well,  but those run out fast!)  if you can download a park map and take a look at it I can also tell ya what areas get jammed up and how to kinda avoid it (for example the entrance to adventure land was not built for crowds so usually you have to be quick on your feet to get threw in a timely manner or go threw Frontierland and new Orleans).  I got more if ya want it,  just ask.  I've lived in SoCal my whole life and have had a Disneyland pass for almost 14 years and go usually 5-6 times a month when I'm not blocked out."
Disneyland,398rr0,betterbeedaily,4,Wed Jun 10 03:04:31 2015 UTC,"Two weeks ago it was a grad night and the grads PLUS the crowds that want to see the Diamond anniversary stuff made the lines unbearable! So we switched over to California Adventures where there were short lines, some we walked right on!!   So my tip is to go to California Adventures on grad night!  Still get a fastpass for  Radiator Springs FIRST THING in the morning. Otherwise it could be up to a 2hour wait, and that ride is a MUST!"
Disneyland,398rr0,kethryvis,3,Wed Jun 10 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"DTD is pretty much just an open-air shopping mall. The only reason i'd go there on a short schedule is if i missed some piece of merchandise to buy, World of Disney has All The Things. Otherwise, it's probably not worth it for you. Concentrate on the parks :)  Most of the super popular rides have fast passes, the main exception to this is Matterhorn. You can get a new FastPass two hours after you get your first one, or that one expires, whichever comes first. So plan your FP gathering accordingly!  You've only got two nights, and most of the nighttime stuff all happens at the same time. i'd say don't miss the new Paint the Night Parade if possible (the 11pm show is less crowded than the 8:50 one), and the new fireworks are AMAZING. Fantasmic is my favorite show so i'm a little biased there, but WoC is new for the anniversary where Fantasmic is still the same. So make of that what you will.  If you don't mind missing the parade in the afternoon, some of the lines go down; for instance, it's a small world is still open during the Soundsational parade which people seem to miss. We walked right on that ride during the parade yesterday.  Don't discount the train as just a ride; it can be a great means of transportation when you're trying to get around the park. It can help you miss some bottlenecks and get around parades.   If you do some homework on the website, figure out your must-sees, and plan your day accordingly... you should be fine :)"
Disneyland,398rr0,EagleEyeInTheSky,3,Wed Jun 10 05:32:29 2015 UTC,"There's not really many ways to ruin a day at the parks, luckily, but there are ways to make it a little bit better.  The number one thing that new visitors don't take advantage of is the Fastpass system. It's absolutely free, and lets you cut lines, and people always ignore it because they don't understand how it works. Seriously, look it up before you go and keep it in mind during your entire visit.  Basically, on all of the big super popular attractions, there's going to be two lines that you can enter to get onto the rides(some have more, but you can probably ignore them). There's the stand-by line, which is a regular line that works just like at every other theme park, and the Fastpass line. The Fastpass line is controlled by a reservation system that works through Fastpass tickets. The Fastpass line is controlled so that most Fastpass lines will never reach longer than 15-30 minutes. For certain rides, this can cut off a whole hour of waiting. You can get a ticket to enter a Fastpass line using Fastpass kiosks outside of every ride that offers Fastpass(these will all be labeled on your park map). To get the Fastpass ticket, just put your park ticket into the kiosk, and it'll print out a Fastpass ticket. The Fastpass ticket that you receive will give you a time later on in the day when you can return to ride that particular time. This could be a few hours to half a day in the future. Technically this means that you'll have to wait hours until you can ride, but this also means that you don't have to do it while waiting in a physical line. While you're waiting on your Fastpass return time for ride A, you can go on rides B and C, and get dinner at restaurant D. Eventually, you'll return back to ride A, and enter the Fastpass return line and wait about 15 minutes in that line to board.  This is an amazing value. It's totally free, and when used right, it can get you on 2 or 3 times as many rides in a day, and I always hear families in the park tell me that they don't use it because they think it'll cost money or that it's too complicated. It's not. It's totally free and totally worth it. There's a few rules like only being able to only have 1 ticket at a time per guest up to a maximum waiting period of two hours(with a few exceptions that you don't need to worry about in your case), but otherwise, it's pretty simple, and if you have any questions, just read the fine print on your Fastpass ticket, read your park map, or ask a cast member.  There are two shows in the resort that are pretty weird in how they seat people, Fantasmic and World of Color. Both of these shows have recently introduced limited seating. In order to manage this limited seating system, these shows also use the same Fastpass system that the rides use. The rules are slightly different though. For these two shows, everyone that wants to see the show must have a Fastpass ticket, and these Fastpasses can be picked up even if you have a ride Fastpass in your hand. No other show in the parks run on this system. The only reason these shows use this system is because in the old days, Fantasmic used to get so popular it created massive traffic problems in the western half of the park that were a nightmare to navigate.  Also, go to Disneyland on the day where there is a Grad Night. I only say that because on Grad Night days, California Adventure closes early for special Grad Night stuff. So you might want to visit California Adventure before Disneyland in your case.  Also, there are smart phone apps that will tell you the wait times on rides. This can be super useful. They're not 100% accurate, and they're not the official times that Disney reports, but they are a good way to see how crowded a ride is on the other side of the park when you don't want to walk all the way over there.  Other than that, you should be able to see quite a bit of both parks over the course of two days. I don't think you'll have much of a problem seeing what you want."
Disneyland,398rr0,citruselectro,2,Wed Jun 10 06:13:52 2015 UTC,"Do single-riders for Matterhorn. Go to the exit and say that you're a single rider. Way faster. Also, if you don't get fastpasses for radiator springs, do the single rider line.   If you AT ALL appreciate Aladdin, try to fit in the show in California Adventure. It's amazing.  If you're a fan of Rapunzel, Pocahontas, or Mulan, then the show Mickey and the Magical Map (or something like that) is a great treat.   Camping out for fireworks is unfortunately something you gotta do. The Matterhorn is part of the show and reallly cool so if you have a view of that, you're golden.  It's possible to do fantasmic, fireworks and the paint the night parade in one night. it's super magical."
Disneyland,398rr0,cinepro,2,Wed Jun 10 07:48:47 2015 UTC,"Lots of good advice.  FWIW, I was there last week on Wednesday with my son and we were able to get on almost every ride in Disneyland (we skipped the Mark Twain, Columbia and Monorail, but could have done those if we tried) and see the 8:50 parade and 10:45 Fantasmic (fireworks were cancelled).  Here's how we did it the best I can remember (asterisk is where we should have done something then instead of later or missing it); I changed the ride order for a few rides because we weren't as efficient as we could have been:  Got there for the 8am opening.   Matterhorn Big Thunder Mountain  (Get Indiana Jones Fast Pass if available) Splash Mountain *Winnie The Pooh (we went on this later, should have done it then) Haunted Mansion Indiana Jones (check for single rider line if you didn't get a Fast Pass) Jungle Cruise Buzz Lightyear Space Mountain (it had been closed, and we got there when it reopened so short wait!) Star Tours (Fast Pass) Pirates of the Caribbean (Checked Fantasmic Fast Pass- still only for the 9pm show.)   (At this point, it was about noon and I started thinking we should try for every ride)  Lunch at Rancho Del Zocalo.  Burrito platters were way too much; we should have split one.   Astro Orbiters Autopia Submarines *Monorail (we skipped this, but should have done it then) (Checked Fantasmic Fast Pass - still on the 9pm show) It's a Small World Train (all the way around) *Storybook Boats (they're not open at night, so you can't wait) *Mark Twain (skipped this) *Columbia (skipped this) Roger Rabbit Cartoon Spin Mr. Toad's Wild Ride Finally got a Fantasmic Fast Pass for 10:45 Split a Grand Gibson for Dinner (I was still kind of full from the burrito lunch, and had lots of snacks in my backpack).   By now it was ~6pm, and people were waiting for the 8:50 parade.  We claimed a spot for a few minutes, but then changed our minds and decided to try and get all the rides and headed to Toontown before it closed:   Gadget Go-Coaster ??? Can't remember what we did Around 8:15, everyone waiting for the parade had to stand up so there was suddenly a ton or room in the prime Main Street spots.  We grabbed one. 8:50 parade - Pretty good. 9:10 - Too much wind, fireworks cancelled :( (This was when we ran and did Winnie the Pooh - Do Alice In Wonderland here if you can) 10:00 - GET YOUR SPOT FOR FANTASMIC!!!!  GET TO YOUR QUEUE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND GET A SPOT AS CLOSE TO THE CENTER STAGE AS POSSIBLE. 10:45 - Watch Fantasmic.   11:10 - Fantasmic is over.  Take a moment to mentally process how awesome that show was. 11:11 - Fantasyland!  Snow White Pinocchio Casey Jr. Dumbo King Arthur Carousel Tea Cups   It was 11:50.  Alice in Wonderland was our last ride, and it had a 10 minute line.  My son wanted to do the Matterhorn again, but no, we had to go for it (plus he has an AP and comes all the time, so boo hoo).     Alice In Wonderland Shops on Main Street on your way out.   So that was our day.  If we had done a few things differently, we could have done just all the rides that were open.  Peter Pan was still closed.  Obviously, if you want to do any other shows or meet-n'-greets, you've got to figure out what you want to see.  But if you want to do the whole park, that's how it worked for us on a Wednesday in early June."
Disneyland,398rr0,Harold_The_Yeti,2,Wed Jun 10 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"The Paint the Night parade is SO worth it! We got to Main Street right as the first parade ended and staked out great spots for the next one. The wait wasn't long for the next show and my whole family loved it and thanked me for making them wait.   Fast Pass anything you can and Single Rider that Matterhorn unless you get there first thing in the morning. It's not like you're sitting next to your family or friends, anyway!   Speaking of mornings, you can get so much done before 12:00 when the crowds really start flowing in. I was there for a Grad Nite weekend and let me tell you, both parks get incredibly packed with rambunctious teenagers by 6pm. Get in line for rope-drop and enjoy a slow, easy morning!"

Disneyland,398rr0,wuerworm,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:31:25 2015 UTC,Use Fast pass to your advantage.   For example you can get  a FP to Indiana Jones   then spend   the  time  before   your return to Indy  on  attractions with  faster moving lines in that area like Jungle cruise/Pirates of the Caribbean  or  Haunted Mansion.  These  usually  load large  amounts of  people in a relatively short time .  30/ 45  mins  even on busy days.   This strategy can be used in  each land.  Get the  a fast pass for  the  ride  that offer it.  Than  return to  other rides or catch  a show.   Parade show times are usually a  good time to  ride the more popular attractions as many  people stop to watch the parade.   in  DCA  world of color  fast passes are available but not  required.  As you can  Walk down to  the  reserved area  once the  show begins.  I also recommend  going to  the section  closest  to the water.  You may get splashed a bit but it's worth it for a better view. Just keep a jacket and you will be fine.   Hope  this helps.  Have a great trip
Disneyland,398rr0,wuerworm,0,Fri Jun 12 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"Get the phone apps that show the wait time for the lines. They're not totally accurate but close enough.  Pick a restaurant or two that you want to dine at, and then see if they offer reservations. They'll ask for your credit card and it'll be $10 fee for a no-show unless you cancel 24 hours ahead.  If they don't do phone reservations, then you can head over to the restaurant itself on the day of and make a reservation that way.  Some personal faves: blue bayou, cafe orleans, storyteller cafe (part of grand californian hotel), ariel's grotto (character meet and greet), and napa rose."

Disneyland,39980v,RobieFLASH,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"Basically, the way it works is you buy a single day park hopper pass and they set up the billing for your AP if you are doing the monthly payment plan. You go in, get your picture taken and they give you your actual AP, but for the day, you are still using the printed out park hopper pass."
Disneyland,39980v,atheistpiece,2,Thu Jun 11 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"Yes.  This is due to the ""ticket upgrade"" rule.  If you buy a ticket to disneyland and decide you want a pass, you are able to use the cost of the ticket towards your pass.  Since you can buy a ticket on a Saturday and then upgrade, it makes sense for them to just allow you to go in any day on the first day of your pass regardless of blackout."

Disneyland,399a3q,Ekkusu_x,2,Wed Jun 10 05:40:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly recommend Wine Country Trattoria. The Wine Country has more familiar items than Ariel's Grotto and Carthay Circle theater. The dining packages that are sit down have better viewing as the other ones will cram you into the other viewing areas/more people buy them so you have more people with you. To be fair though, Ariel's Grotto, as they have a nearby bar, has the better selection of Alcoholic drinks if you want such.  The only thing that could be really considered 'included' is less packed viewing areas and a special desert...from my memory. Not like the Fantasmic dining packages where Blue bayou gives you a kneeling pad to sit on since you're allowed to."

Im just wondering to those who have already been there what have you seen and or purchased that you love and if you can tell me where in the park you got it that would be extra great!  I keep seeing odds and ends of people posting things but I thought it would be helpful to have one place where we could all see and share our favorites! Thanks!
Disneyland,397u88,macboogiewoogie,2,Tue Jun 9 21:54:13 2015 UTC,I second the 60th stein - I got one and drink out of it almost every day!   I also really liked the subtle diamond headband - not sure where to buy them but I saw a few people wearing them in the park and thought it was so cute!

I love the glow with the show technology, but was never too keen on getting a hat for myself. Mostly because I didn't like the design and I'm still bitter about missing out on the passholder event when they first debuted and everybody who went got a free pair of ears.  The 60th anniversary editions are beautiful and i love how the wand is a paint brush. Also love the patch that's sewn on the front. Fits in so well with everything they've got out. Glad I found out about these because I was honestly not into many of the things they've got out. It did take some hunting to find them because they were practically sold out when i went last weekend."

Disneyland,394dmi,Shatteredreality,9,Tue Jun 9 04:22:38 2015 UTC,Makes sense since you can park at Downtown Disney for up to 4 hours and validate for much less than $17.
Disneyland,394dmi,izookie,3,Tue Jun 9 05:19:08 2015 UTC,Is it 4 hours??
Disneyland,394dmi,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,7,Tue Jun 9 09:09:50 2015 UTC,"It's actually 3 hours free parking, and an additional 2 hours with validation from the AMC or from certain sit-down restaurants."
Disneyland,394dmi,boxsterjax,3,Tue Jun 9 10:00:00 2015 UTC,"In my experience, when you validate and are still in the parking lot for over 5 hours they won't charge you the extra balance. I always have my money ready and they just smile and wave me through. I may have just always lucked out though."
Disneyland,394dmi,funkpunk,2,Tue Jun 9 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"its hit and miss. sometimes they don't even check as you leave, but we've definitely had to pay. We had Deluxe passes and always park in Downtown disney because we never stay more than 5 hours and like to grab a drink at Uva bar before going into the parks"
Disneyland,394dmi,rambleonfreddy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"They validate at Uva bar? I thought you had to go into the actual restaurant, if they'll validate at the bar that's a huge convenience for us since we love it there so much."
Disneyland,394dmi,callhersavage,2,Tue Jun 9 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"I am rarely at the park for more than about 6 hours and always park there. Then just walk by the hostess and say ""can I get validated?"" and they say ""sure!"" You don't even have to lie, they don't ask if you've eaten there or not."
Disneyland,394dmi,LazerMcBlazer,2,Tue Jun 9 19:41:53 2015 UTC,yup. they do. you dont need to order food
Disneyland,394dmi,rambleonfreddy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:18:05 2015 UTC,"I believe it used to be but now it looks like first 3 hours are free at DTD and additional 2 hours requires validation from AMC or table service. Beyond that, it's $6/hr, $30 max."
Disneyland,394dmi,izookie,7,Tue Jun 9 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"I've read before that they close the booths 3 hours before the latest park closing, so 9pm with midnight closing makes sense."
Disneyland,394dmi,midnightfire26,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:47:17 2015 UTC,"I think it fluctuates based on park closing. On a Friday night, if the park closes at 10, they keep the tolls open to much closer to closing to keep track of the APs and locals.  This is probably more of an issue now that most of the APs don't include free parking."
Disneyland,394dmi,stevensokulski,3,Wed Jun 10 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"I did this at WDW in 2011 as well. :D  I got to the park around 7pm, to hang out for an evening, mainly at the Polynesian and monorail, on the tail end of a work trip.  It was a nice way to end a stressful trip.  Watching the fireworks from the monorail, dinner at Kona, Dole Whip on the patio.  Then I drove to Epcot and got to walk into the park 3 hours after closing... but that's another story. ;)"
Disneyland,394dmi,yorgle,2,Tue Jun 9 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"When I worked in the parking toll booths at Magic Kingdom (Summer of '10) we wrapped up as the sun went down and they didn't collect any more ticket tolls from that point on.  That wasn't the case on holidays though, as we had to stick around to turn people away when the lot or park closed. Crazy times!"
Disneyland,394dmi,stevensokulski,2,Wed Jun 10 16:50:10 2015 UTC,"ESPN zone store in DTD validates as well - or, they used to, it's been awhile since I've tried it :)"

Disneyland,3947y9,xDok,5,Tue Jun 9 21:54:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, this might be the most on point review of Disneyland I've ever seen. It's refreshing to see a review of Disney that doesn't just praise it wholeheartedly.  I've been 200+ times, I've bought the merchandise, I pay for the premium AP every year, but I have to agree with everything she says."
Disneyland,3947y9,EagleEyeInTheSky,5,Tue Jun 9 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"i bet she's fun at parties. it's not rocket science. disney provides an escape for people. people will pay big bucks for that, even more so since disney does it so completely and in a family friendly manner. there are few places in this world where the illusion is as well done."
Disneyland,3947y9,godwins_law_34,10,Tue Jun 9 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"She really doesn't seem to get it, does she? Is she that jaded by her reporting for CNN Money that she can't see through the corporate side of Disneyland for why it makes people happy?"
Disneyland,3947y9,AnubisEight,2,Tue Jun 9 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"I think she covered the escapism of it pretty well, with all of the energy, the cohesiveness, and the world building that goes into the park.  That being said, it's definitely hard for me sometimes to ignore the money side when it's clear that about 10% of the park isn't there to build good stories, but is meant to prop up brands that have sold well in other Disney mediums, and in a day and age where Disney is making more money that some small countries, there still are corporate sponsorships and branding that clutter the park and ruin the immersion.  I don't think she really missed any part of the experience. At least, she didn't really miss anything that I've noticed in my years of being an AP. I don't really get the part where she came off as jaded."
Disneyland,3947y9,EagleEyeInTheSky,4,Tue Jun 9 23:22:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, totally agree. It's odd how a lot of people write off Disney and Disney parks as just ""children's entertainment"". As Walt said, Disneyland is for the young and the young at heart. Although to be fair she was on point with the fact that Disney was milking the Frozen franchise with it in all 3 shows. But it is interesting getting some perspective from an outsider.  She also got the fact that Disneyland was not just to provide thrill such as other parks aim to do, but to tell a story."

Disneyland,394tfk,_kidnotorious_,6,Wed Jun 10 04:32:57 2015 UTC,Parking... Parking is huge for me..
Disneyland,394tfk,_kidnotorious_,3,Wed Jun 10 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"Well it's a matter of how many times you are able to go within a year. My fiancee and I went somewhere around 72 times last year. After the first 10 or so visits, the pass has more than paid for itself.  We never have to check the schedule to see if we are blocked out. On top of that, the parking is free, which saves a ton of money ($17 x 72 = $1224) The premium pass also has a slightly better discount. It's totally worth it if you are more than just a casual Disney-goer."

Once you in the GCH, follow this map to get to White Water https://peds2040.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GrandCalifornianMap.jpg"
Disneyland,392tzh,Banana4scales,0,Wed Jun 10 01:24:22 2015 UTC,You cannot access from the park or DTD directly. It's indirect. You either go in from DCA and use the entrance into GCH and turn... left I think (memory is fuzzy) to get to WhiteWater Snacks (it's near the pool) or if you're in GCH follow the signs towards their restaurants.

Disneyland,392tzh,PBI325,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:37:22 2015 UTC,Left is correct! And hidden next to the restaurant are some of the nicest bathrooms available to park guests (REAL TOILET PAPER)
Disneyland,392tzh,Jahonk,2,Tue Jun 9 19:44:02 2015 UTC,the ones at Hungry Bear Restaurant are pretty nice for in the park.

Disneyland,392tzh,Banana4scales,12,Tue Jun 9 05:44:27 2015 UTC,Relatively cheap for Disneyland compared to the restaurants in the park.
Disneyland,392tzh,Banana4scales,6,Tue Jun 9 07:45:06 2015 UTC,It says you paid $9.99 for your burger and $7.99 for your pizza with salad. These prices are a few cents less than how much it costs in the park. If you wanted to save money and still get a good amount of food I'd just go to Earl of Sandwich and get 2 sandwiches and a drink for less than $20
Disneyland,392tzh,Banana4scales,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"Well of course there are cheaper places around. This is just the cheapest ""park food"" around and it is fresh."
Disneyland,392tzh,OSX2000,6,Tue Jun 9 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"/u/mildly_interesting, we should get a thread going about starting a chart that shows current price of food in the DLR.

Instead of Tigger, Genie, and Lumiere, they have guys on stilts wearing black with lights on them.   No Jessie in HK.   Not sure if Lightning McQueen is in HK.   We don't have male candle dancers (in front of Belle float) like they have in HK.   I believe HK has a show stop, while we don't here.   I may have missed a few things!"
Disneyland,394mu0,TrulyGoofy,2,Tue Jun 9 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, the differences are as follows: (1) HK parade has show stops, the Anaheim one does not, (2) HK has no Frozen float and no Rapunzel nor Cinderella on the Belle float, (3) some of the dancers in between floats have different costumes. Otherwise the Anaheim PtN is a copy/paste of the HK version."
Disneyland,394mu0,link4lyfe,2,Tue Jun 9 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"The paint brushes associated with the parade are now tools of mass trolling.

I prefer to have someone with me so we can talk but that may just be my personal preference. Though I did get to do all the small stuff that people dont normally do.

Disneyland,391zl0,ArtemisAvenged2,22,Mon Jun 8 17:50:52 2015 UTC,Best: Indiana Jones -- so much to look at Worst: Space Mountain -- what's the point of having the inside que if you're going to make everyone wait outside in the heat?
Disneyland,391zl0,okaywhatnowred,10,Mon Jun 8 20:41:27 2015 UTC,"The inside queue was made before they started doing fastpass. With fastpass now, they had to move the start of the queue all the way to the front to separate who has fastpass and who does not as the inside queue has only space for one line.  The line for Space Mountain at WDW is much different as the hallway to get to the coaster is much wider. Wide enough for two lines. One for standby, and one for fastpass."
Disneyland,391zl0,thatcaveman,3,Mon Jun 8 21:58:18 2015 UTC,They make people wait outside the main queue for Indy as well. They do so because of the fast pass system
Disneyland,391zl0,SuddenStorm1234,19,Mon Jun 8 21:26:13 2015 UTC,Favorite: Roger Rabbit is wonderful...even though I normally wouldn't actually wait in line if the stand-by queue were indeed full.  Worst: Autopia and Midway Mania are pretty rough.
Disneyland,391zl0,omnomnam,2,Mon Jun 8 20:53:17 2015 UTC,I have not been on Roger Rabbit in a solid ten years. Need to before they tear down ToonTown!
Disneyland,391zl0,stacasaurusrex,2,Mon Jun 8 21:06:13 2015 UTC,Are they tearing down Toon Town? I didn't realize that.

Disneyland,391zl0,stacasaurusrex,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"Well if I'm not mistaken there isn't a LOT of land left and Toontown is already gone in florida. And Obviously they won't dare touch the traditional lands like fantasy, tomorrow adventure and frontier. Critter Country has splash so it's far too popular to go. So Toontown does seem the most likely. However since Rodger Rabbit is so loved maybe they'll keep it around. I mean if they extended Fantasyland that way it KINDA fits with the theme?"
Disneyland,391zl0,mrpiggywinkles52,20,Wed Jun 10 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"Best: star tours, Indiana jones  Worst: radiator springs, PETER FLOCKING FLYING PAN.

Disneyland,391zl0,XirdenStone,4,Mon Jun 8 22:19:35 2015 UTC,I haven't been in the line for Radiator Springs. Whats so wrong with it?
Disneyland,391zl0,XirdenStone,6,Mon Jun 8 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"It's very very long, and has not much to look at.  I mostly dislike it because it's the only ride that will have an hour wait regardless of how busy the park is."
Disneyland,391zl0,Scrondoth,2,Mon Jun 8 22:31:26 2015 UTC,True about the wait. I dont even bother except when i can snag a fastpass!
Disneyland,391zl0,stacasaurusrex,2,Mon Jun 8 22:43:51 2015 UTC,single rider line moves very quickly though

Disneyland,391zl0,AXPendergast,4,Mon Jun 8 23:47:06 2015 UTC,Was in RSR queue for three hours. I did not want to see another soda bottle wall at all for the rest of my life.
Disneyland,391zl0,heatandsummer,9,Tue Jun 9 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"OK - perhaps I'm the ""glass half-full"" type of guest...  I think all of the queues are great, whether they be interactive (Jones, Star Tours), plain (Sp Mountain) or just the 'line-crawl' variety (most of Fantasyland).  I find that many people are interested in having conversations while standing in line, rather than just looking at the ground/staring at the wall/checking their phone.  I've met some very interesting people, and made a few new friends, while waiting for my next ride."
Disneyland,391zl0,glitterwrists,3,Tue Jun 9 04:45:32 2015 UTC,I love your point of view! :D
Disneyland,391zl0,NovaHyperionPPDC,2,Tue Jun 9 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I completely agree with you. We only go once a year or so and I love it so much that the queues do not bother me.

Disneyland,391zl0,mrmatthew1999,24,Tue Jun 9 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"Best queue: Star Tours. The stupid hatchbacks they open up on busy days are boring, but as soon as you get into the main part of the show building, there's a ton to look at. I could kick it in the queue all day and be happy.  Worst queue: Space Mountain. There's literally nothing to look at until you're in the boarding room. :/"
Disneyland,391zl0,emmerloo,13,Mon Jun 8 20:37:06 2015 UTC,"Before they remodeled Space Mountain, I really liked watching those FedEx space delivery commercials."
Disneyland,391zl0,dodgepodge,5,Mon Jun 8 23:56:01 2015 UTC,Star Tours was the reason I asked this question! I love the queue so much (minus the hatchbacks like you said)
Disneyland,391zl0,disneywizard,8,Mon Jun 8 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing it as worst, but I love the space mountain queue. You get a great view of Tomorrowland and the building itself, then you get shade, then you get cool immersion. No problems there"
Disneyland,391zl0,Mr_Dkhere,5,Tue Jun 9 00:09:55 2015 UTC,Best: Indiana Jones Worst: Screamin is pretty shitty.
Disneyland,391zl0,disneywizard,10,Tue Jun 9 02:01:23 2015 UTC,"Best: Tower of Terror. It's less interactive than Indiana Jones', but it does well to immerse you in the spooky bowels of the hotel.  Worst: Pirates of the Caribbean, because of the horrible way it winds outside these days. A close second for me is the regular standby line for Radiator Springs Racers. Sure, it's quaint and has cool music, but there's not really much to do or look at for 2+ hours. Even single ride is a slog with nothing to do for 45 minutes except throw coins in the radiator spring."
Disneyland,391zl0,polyphenus,3,Mon Jun 8 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"Best   Star Tours: very immersive and has new details you can look at every time. Makes you feel like you're actually in a space airport about to leave Earth.   Indiana Jones: The attention to detail is stunning. You completely forget you're in hot California and feel you've stepped right into an ancient temple in India. There's always something new to look at also, which makes it wonderful.   Thunder Mountain: Though there isn't anything immersive or interactive, it puts you right in the middle of the attraction and rackets up the excitement the closer you get to the front.   Worst   Fantasyland attractions: Really cramped and tight. Nothing to look at while you pass the time.   Space Mountain: One word: HOT. It feels like a sauna when you're part of the outside queue. Add on not having anything but white to look at and the rails being as hot as the sun when you touch them and being packed like sardines and it's miserable.   Meh   Haunted Mansion: The pet cemetery is nice to look at and it's shaded in spots but not much else to do while you wait. Plus the rails are cooler than Space Mountain's so you have somewhere to rest while you wait."
Disneyland,391zl0,heliattackpe,9,Tue Jun 9 00:42:40 2015 UTC,Now the haunted mansion holiday.... that's a neat queue. The music box and flickering candles at night just immerse you in the story. Like sitting in a theatre waiting for the show to start.
Disneyland,391zl0,MeishkaD,2,Tue Jun 9 01:15:30 2015 UTC,I forgot that. It is a really nice queue.
Disneyland,391zl0,RainbowMagicSparkles,8,Tue Jun 9 01:27:45 2015 UTC,"Best: Indiana Jones (great, immersive atmosphere with fun interactions), Splash Mountain (great view of the ride, wonderful BGM piped in), Thunder Mountain (you're literally in the middle of the beginning/ending of the ride and you get to see lots of the action)  Worst: Submarines (it's a long, straight line out in the sun when it's busy), Matterhorn (another long, straight line, but this time it's at the base of the mountain), Roger Rabbit (very dark, scenery is showing its age, deceptively long line length)"
Disneyland,391zl0,TrulyGoofy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:56:46 2015 UTC,The Reason Indy is so immersive is because the queue itself takes you outside of the park. The ride is in a show building outside of the park that used to be on a parking lot for Eeyore. So they needed to try and make up for the distance you'd have to walk regardless of the length of the line.
Disneyland,391zl0,ijustshatyourpants,3,Wed Jun 10 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"Best  I would have to say the most enjoyable ques on my recent trip with my daughter were Start Tours and Big Thunder. We hardly even felt like we were standing in line as they moved at a decent pace and there is plenty to look at.  WORST  Mickey's Fun Wheel. Closest I came to bailing on a line. Hot, not much to look at, long, and slow. It was awful."
Disneyland,391zl0,loyns15,3,Tue Jun 9 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Best is Star Tours, easily. Worst is Monsters, Inc."
Disneyland,391zl0,OPWC,2,Tue Jun 9 05:16:51 2015 UTC,I think the Monsters Inc queue is great! I see something new every time.
Disneyland,391zl0,holdenscott,3,Tue Jun 9 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"Worst: I second the Fantasyland dark rides. Cramped, long, ugh. Best: All of the best ones have already been mentioned, but I think it's important to mention the Little Mermaid. It's a good ride with a usually non-existent line. No line is the best line."
Disneyland,391zl0,centracing,2,Wed Jun 10 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"My favorite queues have to be Pirates, Indy, Splash, RSR and Star Tours. I love pirates for two reasons: 1. It makes me feel like I'm in that time period. 2. The smell when you walk through those doors. Nothing brings memories more than the smell of that water. The ambience in that inner portion is perfect.   I can honestly say I enjoy all of the queues at both parks. Waiting in line doesn't bother me at all. Each queue brings back a great memory for me. It makes the parks that much more meaningful."
Disneyland,391zl0,stacasaurusrex,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:24:24 2015 UTC,I always look forward to the smells inside pirates! Who doesn't love it?
Disneyland,391zl0,stacasaurusrex,2,Wed Jun 10 17:40:45 2015 UTC,Best: Indiana Jones  Worst: The single-rider line for California Screamin'... that's just strange.
Disneyland,391zl0,dodgepodge,2,Tue Jun 9 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"Best: Roger Rabbit, Thunder, Indy. Theming is great with all of these.  Worst: Soarin', Screamin', Matterhorn, Pirates. Boring, nothing to look at. Just tragic :("
Disneyland,391zl0,okaywhatnowred,2,Tue Jun 9 00:11:27 2015 UTC,Roger Rabbit is an awesome queue!
Disneyland,391zl0,dodgepodge,2,Tue Jun 9 05:49:04 2015 UTC,"Worst I'd have to say is Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't know why, but that line can be deceiving. Looks short and windy, but no. Takes forever and people love to shove!"

Disneyland,38xkox,Land-Stander,2,Sun Jun 7 19:24:53 2015 UTC,:( if I may ask? Why no Disneyland in such a long time?
Disneyland,38xkox,justVinnyZee,2,Sun Jun 7 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"I live in South Carolina. Hell I haven't even seen my family in California since then. My wife, has never been to Disneyland, so trying to show her rides and attractions on YouTube, is all I've got for now. Lol We'll go back when our kids are old enough to walk/remember the trip."

Disneyland,3907qv,mjreab,6,Mon Jun 8 08:13:04 2015 UTC,"I think I recommend Carthay Circle Restaurant on every post like this one. This time is no different. It's a nice restaurant with great old Hollywood theming, and the World of Color dining package is a good deal for a three-course menu and access to the best viewing area for World of Color.  The only other place worth a reservation is Napa Rose, which is the only true fine dining restaurant outside of Club 33.  If you ask me, Ariel's Grotto is too gimmicky and Wine Country Trattoria not original enough to warrant a reservation. HOWEVER, the Cove Bar at Ariel's Grotto is worth a visit, no reservations required. The view from there over Paradise Bay is fantastic, and they have lobster nachos. 'Nuff said."
Disneyland,3907qv,dodgepodge,7,Mon Jun 8 09:22:40 2015 UTC,"People seem to miss this a lot, but the ""all you care to eat"" BBQ at big thunder ranch is really good, and from past experiences of being turned away, reservations are recommended for that."
Disneyland,3907qv,XirdenStone,3,Mon Jun 8 17:12:50 2015 UTC,If you want a great time here are my choices.    1 Napa Rose  2 Carthay Circle (request a private room) 3 Blue Bayou
Disneyland,3907qv,CakvalaSC,3,Mon Jun 8 17:37:27 2015 UTC,"In Disneyland proper, I've never reserved anywhere but Blue Bayou. If you'll also be in DCA you should get a World of Color dining package at one or more of Ariel's Grotto, Carthay Circle or Wine Country Trattoria so you can watch WoC from the reserved viewing area. Of those options:   Wine Country Trattoria has no theming whatsoever. Ariel's Grotto has probably the strongest theming but terrible service every time I've been. It's also very loud in that dining room for some reason. If you're seated outside it's not so loud and the view across the water is pleasant in the evening, but you miss out on the under-the-sea decor. Carthay Circle's theming is more understated, but it's a nicer restaurant than Ariel's Grotto in every respect. The cocktails (in the restaurant or the lounge, which shares the restaurant's ambiance) are superb. I'd make reservations here and only do Ariel's Grotto if you decide you want a second WoC experience."
Disneyland,390369,TheGear360,3,Mon Jun 8 07:14:51 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for that day's show in particular? The show is called Disneyland Forever and is currently running in the parks, so there's lots of video (of varying quality) online, like this one.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmkZ-JENQzU"
Disneyland,390369,stevensokulski,2,Mon Jun 8 17:53:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! My dad was really upset he couldn't see anything lol.
Disneyland,390369,stevensokulski,2,Mon Jun 8 18:10:05 2015 UTC,"For future reference, if your father has a Disability Access Card, you can get access to reserved seating area at the Train Station. Doesn't get you super close, but the line of sight may be better. Not sure what the procedure is as far as whether this takes a lot of time to get into. I've used it in Orlando with my girlfriend when she was partially disabled and it was a real stress reducer."
Disneyland,390369,lego606,2,Mon Jun 8 23:26:10 2015 UTC,"Officially, the DAS card does not provide reserved viewing for shows. They offer one for Soundsational as a courtesy, but DAS for PTN/DL Forever is up to Guest Relations and how many people are booked for the VIP area that night"

Disneyland,38y2wc,incride,8,Sun Jun 7 20:43:55 2015 UTC,I watched Paint the Night on the top of the stairs for the train on Mainstreet. Perfect view of the show and we watched it super last minute to go up there to see it and it was awesome.

Disneyland,38y2wc,cjZombie,7,Fri Jun 12 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"The paint the night parade is at 8:50pm and 11pm. Fireworks are at 9:30pm, pretty much right after the 8:50 parade. Another good spot to watch both is at small world, near where merida does meet and greet. You can see the projections on small world, the same projections from main street.  Good luck!!"
Disneyland,38y2wc,wuerworm,4,Sun Jun 7 21:51:32 2015 UTC,Over by the rivers of America they turn on the Fantasmic Water Screens to project the show onto as  well.
Disneyland,38y2wc,RVierra327,3,Sun Jun 7 22:08:28 2015 UTC,"Does Paint the Night do the traditional parade route from Small World to Main Street (or the reverse, Main Street to Small World)"
Disneyland,38y2wc,EnglishMobster,5,Sun Jun 7 22:59:50 2015 UTC,"The 8:50 parade runs along the normal parade route from Small World to Main Street. Once the Mickey Mouse float goes backstage in Town Square, there is about a 3 minute gap before the fireworks are launched. At 11 PM, the parade goes from Town Square back up to It's a Small World."
Disneyland,38y2wc,cinepro,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, the projections are different in each area.  They're programmed specifically for each facade.  They use mostly the same animations, but there's a lot of unique elements as well."

Disneyland,38y2wc,XirdenStone,3,Mon Jun 8 23:55:00 2015 UTC,Wife and I have a sneaky parade viewing spot: the benches outside the restrooms near Alice in wonderland.  Got there an hour before and got a stone bench with little problems.
Disneyland,38y2wc,MusicalMagicalDays,2,Mon Jun 8 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you still saw sidewalk seating on Main Street at 6pm. I was at DL May 27-June 1, and the only night we could sit on the street was Monday just after Soundsational. Every other night, Main Street was at least 3 people deep by 5pm. Maybe the allure of the new parade has worn off a little."
Disneyland,38y2wc,thatcaveman,2,Mon Jun 8 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"Any observations on how crowded it was for the 11PM shows?  I'm going this weekend with someone who hasn't been before for a day, and we're going to try and cram as many e-ticket attractions as we can in both parks. PTN and DLF are at the top of our list."
Disneyland,38y2wc,animalstreet,3,Mon Jun 8 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"I went last night at 11 PM and it was crowded, but not as bad as I hear it's been.  We ended up at the end of main street, right before the parade makes its way into Fantasyland.  We missed out on the projections, but the parade was just as amazing.  We were able to get benches when we got there about 9:50.  Good luck! It's probably my favorite parade now."
Disneyland,38y2wc,thatcaveman,2,Mon Jun 8 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch!   Yeah, I'm hoping that the 11PM show won't be as crowded as the earlier show so we'd be able to get a sidewalk seat. Since we're going to be going full blast from rope drop to get as much done, I'm sure we'll be really tired. Hopefully the families with the smaller kids will be already gone by then."
Disneyland,38y2wc,MaLaCoiD,2,Mon Jun 8 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"There's some terraces with seating on the walkway between Matterhorn and Small World. You can enter near the popcorn cart by Matterhorn, and get between the reserved sections. I had plenty of room at the 11p run on a Thursday night."
Disneyland,38y2wc,dustycotton,2,Mon Jun 8 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"In the hub, they rope off across the street on the Adventure Land side about 20-25 min prior to parade start. Hang around the Jolly Holiday bakery for a bit of rest and then stand in street when they put that rope up. Then just stay there for fireworks."
Disneyland,38y2wc,AnubisEight,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, good to know"
Disneyland,38y2wc,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"Last night, Monday, we got a curb spot on the shady side of the street in front of Candy Palace by moving there just after Soundsational. Half the people stayed.  We weren't asked to stand until 8:30. If I didn't have a stroller, I would pop into the spaces that open between 8 and 8:30. You are more likely to be able to save spots if you are on the curb. We set out 3 butts-worth of blanket.  We had no problem converging on the center of the street because a majority of the crowd was blocked by the crossing at Coke Corner. (The view and projections were better than Small World.)  There was enough room for groups of 3 to squeeze in from the sidewalk. If I didn't get a parade spot, I would plan on being near Tiki just before fireworks start, then walk to the middle of Main Street to find a spot to squeeze in."
Disneyland,38y2wc,The_Unsung_81,0,Tue Jun 9 15:11:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips!
Disneyland,38zy7e,ewhitbey,6,Mon Jun 8 06:17:26 2015 UTC,I think you should be fine. Disneyland isn't about just the rides - there's so much more to it! Its good too that you have reinforcements because it means that you and your husband will still be able to ride some of the adult rides while she's being taken care of! The best part about Disneyland is that there is something for everyone - even those young enough not to really understand what is going on!   The rides that are child friendly are wonderful for sharing with your children. The only thing I can think to say is don't try to overload her too much - take it slow and just watch her take it all in. Its a perfect opportunity to bond with her and even though she's unlikely to remember it as she grows but she will certainly enjoy herself!  Have fun! :)
Disneyland,38zy7e,I_did_the_yiggy,2,Mon Jun 8 09:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yes! I think this trip is going to make me appreciate the smaller things again. Plus, I'm excited to see the castle all dolled up for the 60th anniversary."
Disneyland,38zy7e,mamamonkey,5,Mon Jun 8 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"I took my middle son at 11 months - he was in the stroller or carrier for most of the day. Good naps were not to be had! But we got through the day and our family had a good time.   We took my son on a few rides at that age - mostly stuff his brother (almost 3) was interested in. Bugs Land in DCA has quite a few, Fantasyland has lots too but it tends to be more crowded. The carousel on Paradise Pier was a hit too! And any train was good.   Make sure to use the Fast Passes for the adult rides as much as you can. You can also do a parent swap? We didn't use that though so I don't know how it works.   My son loved Pooh and Tigger at that age - they're very fuzzy! They're over by splash mountain. I would probably skip the character dining unless you know how she'll react - some kids DO NOT like characters and will scream. A lot. You don't want to be stuck in a room was multiple roaming characters if she's going to react badly.   My son was pretty good with restaurants at that age so we went wherever. I'd probably skip places that need reservations though - try to stay flexible when you're coming with a little one.   Do what you can to make sure she stays cool. Shade on the stroller, cool treats (we loved the pineapple spears near the Jungle Cruise), possibly wetting a hat if it's really hot. If she was a little older I'd say to take her to the Princess Dot Puddle Park in DCA. My son was in the carrier when we took his brother there and ended up getting splashed too as I didn't realize where the water was going to come from!"
Disneyland,38zy7e,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,2,Mon Jun 8 10:47:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This was incredibly helpful. I've always gone by myself or with my husband, so this will be new and interesting for me. I think no matter what we do, she will love it. She loves to people watch and there is no shortage of that during the summer time."
Disneyland,38zy7e,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,3,Mon Jun 8 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"We took my niece when she was 11 months old and it was a wonderful trip. She wasn't very used to being in the stroller for long periods of time so we were most concerned with that, she didn't fuss even once in three days in the parks. She absolutely loved rolling around and watching all the people. She was a beefy baby so we were quite happy that she was content in the stroller because carrying her was a workout!   We had my 9 and 7 year old nephews with us as well, so we didn't focus much on the smaller rides as they were all about the thrills. Also, the baby fell asleep on every ride we took her on except the carousel. Pirates, submarine, Small World, all the boat rides lulled her to sleep in record time. She did get a kick out of the Tiki Room.   We did character dining on our last day and she wasn't super enthused about the characters at the start, but they really do such a wonderful job reading the kids that they'd hang back, play with the older boys and wait for her to become comfortable before moving in. Our favorite pictures are of her with Stitch.   We had a great time and really enjoyed having her there, her wide eyes and expressions as she took everything in were so much fun. We went back this spring break, she's three now, and she wouldn't stop talking about how we were going to see Mickey for two months before the trip. She absolutely loved looking at pictures of her first visit while we prepared for her second.  The carousel was still her favorite ride."
Disneyland,38zy7e,mamamonkey,3,Mon Jun 8 18:31:43 2015 UTC,This kind of trip is the ultimate goal. I've gone so many times that I feel like I won't be missing much by excluding the rides we can't go on with her. Thanks for sharing. 😄
Disneyland,38zy7e,Merma1d,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"I hope you have a blast!   I go most frequently with adult friends or solo, but I really love the trips with the kids too. Every age with kids, and different combinations of people, shows you a different side of the park to enjoy!  I went once with a friend's 2 and 4 year olds and it was the only time I've enjoyed Toon Town, through their eyes!"
Disneyland,38zy7e,waterfox17,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:32:34 2015 UTC,How did I forget about the Tiki Room?!? My son LOVED it at 11 months.
Disneyland,38zy7e,MaLaCoiD,2,Mon Jun 8 23:25:42 2015 UTC,"This is going to be a whole new world with the little one along-- I am guessing that the moments that are most memorable are the ones you could never have imagined!  Small World was a must ride for my grands at that age. Winnie the Pooh, Ariel, either carousel and any train were also big hits.  There are some nice play areas in Toon Town where she can toddle around, but in July they will be crowded.   One of the kids was terrified of all characters, big head or face, including Santa. So if there was a Santa Claus crying fit last year it might indicate how well characters will go over. And ditto the baby centers, the best place for a change, to warm up food, a cozy quiet refuge."
Disneyland,38zy7e,JediWithRedEyes,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:49 2015 UTC,"If you need some quiet time (like if she needs to nap) or if you need any extra assistance, there are Baby Centers in both parks.  Disneyland's baby center is located by the Photo Center on Main Street (next to the red Corn Dog cart), and California Adventure's is located next to the Ghiradelli Soda & Ice Cream Fountain in the Pacific Wharf (just past Cars Land)."

Disneyland,38zy7e,Lollybrubs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:46:45 2015 UTC,We took our 20 month old on the 60th kickoff weekend. Best tip is to just see it through your child's eyes.
Disneyland,38yzqu,Skawwwt,14,Mon Jun 8 01:07:23 2015 UTC,"I went a little overboard, but I hope this all helps! :)  Attractions to See   Alice in Wonderland: Recently plussed and looks much better than it used to Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: Also recently plussed with new special effects Disneyland Forever Fireworks: The newest firework show at Disneyland. I'd recommend seeing the Paint the Night parade on Main Street, then moving into the center of Main Street afterwards to get the full effect of the show. Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage: New to you! The ride can be a little cramped, so if you or your wife are claustrophobic, there's a handicapped alternative that doesn't require getting into the subs. Haunted Mansion: It'll be decorated with the Nightmare Before Christmas theme, but little updates are made every year, and hopefully the Hatbox Ghost will still be implemented. It's a Small World: Total Disney classic, and in 2008 it went under major refurbishment to improve the ride experience and add 37 Disney characters. I love trying to find them all! The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: It's not new or updated, but it's dorky and usually has no wait time. Matterhorn Bobsleds: It's still the same old jerky track, but they just added some new special effects and a new Yeti, so it's worth checking out if you have the time. Mickey and the Magical Map: One of the newest stage shows in the parks, complete with a blinking, talking Mickey. Paint the Night Parade: Disneyland's newest nighttime parade, and it ROCKS. Peter Pan's Flight: By the time you go, it'll be reopened and refurbished. We don't have a great idea of what the ride will be like when in opens back up in July, but I'm confident it'll be nothing short of magical. Pirates of the Caribbean: There have been some great additions since you last visited! Multiple state-of-the-art Jack Sparrow audio-animatronics have been added, and they look fantastic. It looks like Johnny Depp is standing right in front of you. Star Tours: There have been a lot of changes made to the ride experience, and it's better and more immersive than ever.   Crowd Expectations  I suppose it all depends on what kind of a visit you want. Do you want to be able to see and do everything, or are you alright with a lot of perusing and walking around? Because if you want to do everything, mid-late December is not the time to go to Disneyland. I've had better luck going mid-week on the first week of December. If you're fine with skipping rides because of lines, then go ahead and go on your planned date! There are plenty of things to do that don't require waiting in line, even if it's just picking somewhere to sit and people watch. When my fiance and I would go on busier days, we'd make sure to meander around and go on whatever ride struck our fancy at the time. Never go into the park with a schedule, it leads to stress to make it to everything. Just have a general idea and you'll have a blast!  One Park or Both?  It depends on your interests! Disneyland is more geared towards families and kids, whereas California Adventure has more to offer for adults. Both have a good mix, however, so you won't be devoid of interesting things to do and see if you just stick to Disneyland. If you do hit up California Adventure, I always recommend Soarin' Over California, Tower of Terror, and a World of Color showing. You can't go wrong with those three. :)  Romantic Things to Do and See   Disneyland Railroad: Check into Town Hall early in the morning to see if the Lily Belle train car is available. It's golden and luxurious. Even if the Lily Belle isn't open, I love meeting the train on Main Street and going allll the way around the park. It's a nice break for your feet, and I've always used it as an excuse to lean on my fiance's shoulder. ;) Mark Twain Riverboat: Grab something to eat on the go and hop aboard the Mark Twain. A leisurely roll down the river with some good grub in hand equals happiness. Snow White's Wishing Well: Something about wishing wells is inherently romantic. Storybook Land Canal Boats: If you ask a cast member ahead of time, you might be able to sit in a boat during the fireworks show.   Grub to Eat   Blue Bayou: This is the restaurant inside Pirates of the Caribbean, and 10 times out of 10 it requires an advanced reservation. It's pricey as well, but the experience is well worth it and the food is amazing. Gibson Girl Ice Cream Parlor: Delicious sundaes in a fun Victorian parlor environment. I love grabbing a scoop and sitting on the curb of Main Street to people watch. Royal Street Veranda: Home of some of the best clam chowder I've ever eaten (and I live on the California Coast). Their fritters are to die for. Tiki Juice Bar: Dole Whips. Enough said."

I have a question (that I may have asked before and may have forgotten the answer to, so I apologize if that's the case), I went last December for the first time in many years and maybe it was just nostalgia at play but I noticed that a lot of the renovated rides seemed shorter in length. Particularly Star Tours. Am I crazy?"

Disneyland,38yzqu,J_Cricket_Is_Helping,4,Tue Jun 9 01:39:35 2015 UTC,"I'm marking my place here to come back with some tips and advice as well. Just wanna make it thorough advice! glitterwrists already gave some great advice! I was a Disneyworld cast member and worked for them on the Disney College Program between June through January but have lived in Arizona all my life and Disneyland is more of my home (visiting there three times a year thankfully).  The biggest tip I would give now is to do some research in regards to military benefits, Disney is huge in regards to military efforts and contacting Disney about that topic may save you a little more cash, helping with hotels, food, merch., etc. for your trip! I'll be back soon!"
Disneyland,38yzqu,glitterwrists,2,Mon Jun 8 04:57:15 2015 UTC,"Oooh, good call on military benefits! Disney Parks can be very helpful in that regard."
Disneyland,38yzqu,XirdenStone,4,Mon Jun 8 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"You can make reservations for nearly every resteraunt in the park up to 60 days in advance and all from the Disney website, HIGHLY recommend doing so.  Also as it seems lots of people miss this olace, Carthay circle theatre in california adventure is absolutely stunning, classy 1920-1930 atmosphere, complete with pictures of Walt at the academy awards.  Fancy cocktails and the best food in disney.  The only downside is it can be very pricey."
Disneyland,38yzqu,SnarkMasterRay,3,Mon Jun 8 05:01:42 2015 UTC,"The food isn't exceptional (it's not bad, but a foodie would probably turn their nose up at it), but I think the Minnie & Friends Character Breakfast is a great way to start the day. Adult couples without kids are a regular occurrence as well, my wife and I never felt out of place. The characters make it a point of coming and interacting with each table."
Disneyland,38yzqu,MaLaCoiD,2,Mon Jun 8 03:58:07 2015 UTC,"What are some cool, secret, possibly romatic-y spots we can check out inside the park?       I can think of a few:   Sometimes the very far back seating area of Hungry Bear is empty. There's a path from the fruit stand by Hungry Bear to Harbour Galley. The area is called Fowler's Inn.

The one in cars land was more rap and the like. The last dance floor was in the wharf area and it was more Latin American dance music!
Disneyland,38zpq3,ArtemisAvenged2,2,Mon Jun 8 16:00:59 2015 UTC,"When I went to Grad Night, it was back when they were still doing it in Disneyland, but pretty much what happens is they set up multiple DJs is all corners of the park all doing different genres of dance or EDM music.  With California Adventure, the biggest one is probably going to be the regular Mad T Party that's always there, minus the alcohol, but just expect to see more stuff like that all over the park."

Disneyland,38vou7,heymiso,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'm an Annual Passholder, but I spend the extra money to buy the Halloween Party tix because it's awesome and I love it! I always recommend it for visitors and college students who are on a budget because it's the lowest price to get into Disneyland all year! The best part is that you can go in 3 hours early with the tix, which means 3pm or 4 pm (depending on the event start time) so if you are ok with not having full day (like, 8 hours instead of 12+), you can buy Party tix only and still have lots of fun. Other benefits of the Party: parking is included in tix price; limited tix are sold so crowd-size should be manageable; Halloween fireworks show is super-cool (now rivaled/eclipsed by the brand-new 60th Anniversary ""Disneyland Forever"" fireworks); special Halloween things like themed snacks, dance parties and characters in costumes; creepy fog in the Rivers of America; and most importantly short lines for rides. I can usually get on E-ticket rides easily during the Party time period. Overall, the atmosphere changes in a delightfully Halloween-way with mood lighting, fog, decorations, etc. so it feels like a special night.  Disadvantages: Lots of kids running around in the dark aggressively trying to get candy from the Treat Stations. However, the good news about this is that they are out of your way and not queuing for rides, as long as you aren't also doing the trick-or-treat thing. But if you do want candy, of course you can join them-- the lines will be long, but it's also pretty easy to just jump in a short line when you happen past it, and your treat bag will fill quickly due to generous Cast Members. Another main disadvantage if you attend the Party only and don't buy regular park tix is not getting into the park in the morning to grab FastPasses for the popular rides. Also, many of the decorations and Halloween-y things are all over the park during regular hours, too-- in other words, not all of it is exclusive to the Party. I should also point out that I didn't go last year (2014) and I heard a lot of people complain about how crowded it was, so maybe I'm wrong about the crowds and rides. Personally, I will still choose to attend the Party this year because I like the feel of a Halloween night in the park and I know I'll have fun!  TL;DR: Buy Halloween Party tix if you're cool with an 8-hour-only day at Disneyland, rather than a full 12+hour day. There's definitely fun to be had, and it's a cool, special thing to try at the park. If not, then choose a day to visit in Oct that is not a Party night so you can enjoy a full, regular day (and still see the Halloween decorations and rides)."
Disneyland,38vou7,mamamonkey,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at it a bit as we're going in October also.  It seems like (from past years) Disneyland will close at 6 p.m. for the party, DCA stays open though if you have park hopper tickets.  Tickets were about $60 in the past, from what I can tell.  Dates are released in June or July, I think.    We're leaning towards not buying them, but we have three small kids so it would be $300 and who knows if they'll even be up for it by 6 at night.  Plus apparently a lot of the kids just go straight for the candy and really it's kind of a waste of money to do that.  Downside to not getting them is that it's looking like possibly no fireworks for our visit.  Halloween fireworks are only at the Halloween party, and last year they didn't run fireworks on the non-party weekdays."

As long as you are smart about how you attack the park you'll be fine. That being said, I'm sure it will be busier this year with the anniversary celebrations. As for food, there are a lot of special menu items available throughout the resort for thanksgiving and they will post those on their website when it gets closer. They have thanksgiving buffets at each of the resort hotels, which is usually what we choose. Christmas decorations and celebrations are in full swing at thanksgiving. It's a fun time to be at the parks! Good luck!"

We've been going several years now and my experience is that the 2 days before Thanksgiving are usually not busy at all (Wednesday is especially pleasant) and Thanksgiving day is really, really busy. The day after varies a lot and can be really busy or not. I have always heard that the parks often reach capacity over that holiday but I have never personally experienced it, nor been aware of it.  Christmas decorations are up in full force by Thanksgiving.   Nearly all the restaurants serve some type of turkey meal for both lunch and dinner and the Disney hotels do buffets.   Disneyland at Thanksgiving is one our favorite family traditions. We always have a great time."

Disneyland,38v944,PicklePants84,2,Mon Jun 8 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is kind of late, but I went over Thanksgiving break with my family in 2012, and it wasn't bad. I believe we went Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (maybe even Wednesday as well, but definitely those three days). We found it to be completely manageable, but we used to be SoCal residents with a premium pass, so that might have to do with our previous knowledge of the parks. IMO, as long as you make reservations for restaurants and work the fast pass system, you should be fine. It might be slightly more crowded than usual, but definitely not as crowded as summers or Christmas/New Years.   I'll be going again this Thanksgiving, and I'm not worried about it at all :)   EDIT: For restaurant recommendations, my family actually went to Ariel's Grotto for Thanksgiving dinner, but we'll probably do Carthay Circle this year. Ariel's Grotto was a pleasant surprise though; at the time, no one in my family was under the age of 16, and the princesses did a great job of adapting to the older crowd. The food was pretty good as well! We had outdoor seating, which made a huge difference (more peaceful, less little kids, great views). Make your dinner reservations FAR in advance. The reason we ate at Ariel's Grotto last time was because there were no other restaurants available (and we made the reservations a month in advance)!"

Disneyland,38qp8k,howisaraven,9,Sat Jun 6 17:25:25 2015 UTC,I ate two churros while watching Fantasmic. No regrets. (I could actually only eat 1 1/2. Two churros is a lot.)

Disneyland,38qp8k,frankgotthegirl,5,Sat Jun 6 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"That's disappointing and honestly, for me, quite rare. It does happen but usually they're just coming out of the oven thing. It's probably even worth finding a churro cart that has a line because you know they're warming them while you're in line and you'll get a nice fresh one"

Disneyland,38uee9,buiizel,6,Sat Jun 6 22:26:00 2015 UTC,I was at both parks today and they were well stocked. They were well stocked a few weeks ago too. I think they have caught up to the demand.

Then, in order to not just completely outs the chipmunks, have a 'speaking' tree near Donald's ship and a special door for Chip n' Dale to come out of for meet n' greets. I know that area isn't really used much besides relaxation.  The only thing that stops me is the fact that the area might not be big enough for the theater and it might intrude on a Cast member backstage street among whatever the building next to it is. :\ ....Edit after the thought. With crude map copy pasting it might just BARELY fit. But I do mean BARELY. It'd create a bottleneck of strollers in front of Mickey and Gadget Go coaster."

Disneyland,38sd4m,golf4miami,3,Sat Jun 6 15:47:32 2015 UTC,This. I second this! ToT is my favorite. The look of the WDW version is so much better. DCA looks too clean and not as ominous. We won't even get started on comparing the queues. I get space is limited. But does Bugs Land REALLY need to be there? They could've used that space for the tower itself and built up the queue where the tower currently stands.
Disneyland,38sd4m,Fletch86,0,Sat Jun 6 16:38:21 2015 UTC,"Yes yes yes yes yes.  DCA's ToT is kind of embarrassing, in my opinion. I rarely ride it because it just makes me sad. A reminder of old DCA and the cheap attempts to fix it!"
Disneyland,38sd4m,omnomnam,6,Sat Jun 6 20:55:10 2015 UTC,I would replace the monsters inc ride in DCA with the one from Tokyo Disneyland. It's so much better and would really boost the attendance in that area of the park.

Disneyland,38sd4m,robbertofu,3,Sat Jun 6 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"You're correct. The Yeti is a separate building, and he needed to much energy to move that he broke the foundation of his structure. It basically can't be repaired without tearing down the whole ride.  So we menacing growls, a strobe light, and it seems that they switch around the pose from time-to-time. Long live ""Disco Yeti.""  I hear that Imagineering is now utterly obsessed with not repeating ""the yeti problem"" in future rides."
Disneyland,38sd4m,OPWC,2,Sat Jun 6 22:09:47 2015 UTC,"Disco Yeti is a disappointment, no question, but I the storytelling of EE is still (IMO, of course) on par with any other attraction. The theme of the queue area alone is just crazy good. The coaster itself is fast and smooth, which makes it like every other modern coaster (not a bad thing).  Last time I was at DL earlier this year the Matterhorn was being refurbished, so maybe it's improved. My experience has always been a comparatively slow and rough ride with dated set dressing.  Respect, though... you love the Matterhorn, so keep on lovin' it.  I still stand by needing to move MuppetVision 3D in to DCA. :-)"
Disneyland,38sd4m,OPWC,2,Sat Jun 6 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with Everest being a solid attraction. Really great ambiance in the queue and the entrance.  But I've just never really understood why people bother to compare Matterhorn to Everest. One is a classic, no-frills, rough coaster (first tubular steel coaster in the world) that stands as the centerpiece of Dland. The other is a modern, tech-savvy thrill ride that goes for full immersion.  In my mind, it's kind of like saying ""Indiana Jones is better than Pirates because it's different every time."" I mean, yeah!  Also, it's always bothered me that Everest isn't actually a full mountain, and that Imagineering got lazy and just left the show building completely uncovered in the back.  http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3099/2678836074_8a12e93e32_z.jpg"

As with the old entrance to Club 33, no one was even allowed in the foyer unless they had reservations, so I can only imagine the policy still holds true. The only thing you can conceivably do at this time is call Disney straight up and ask if they can do you a favor on this one.   This sucks because you have an actual story behind picking that place and it would be a very special place for you two. However, my best suggestion is to find a new special spot, one you'll hopefully be able to visit many times over in the future. There are hundreds of gorgeous spots in Disneyland. Court des Anges is your GF's favorites spot, so maybe it's time to find a place that is both yours?"

For the WOC, I liked it, but I felt the original was better. Felt that the show could have featured more disney content. Its great that they featured rides in Disney rather than their movies. I loved the soundtrack ""Forever Young"" used in the show and also love the post-show soundtrack ""Disneyland""   For Paint the Night, everything about it is amazing!! Everything is bright and the soundtrack is amazing. Each float was incrediably detailed and loved the last mickey ""trippy"" float. I was intrigued at looking at it.

One day, a guest walked up to me outside of Star Tours holding a map:   Guest: So, let me get this straight. [Points to Adventureland] I can go anywhere in the park but Adventureland?  Me: No, you can go into Adventureland. Adventureland should be open.  Guest: Oh, because I was told my ticket won't let me into Adventureland.  Me: There shouldn't be any reason that you can't go into Adventureland. Your ticket got you into Disneyland and you can go to any land inside of Disneyland you want. You can head over to Adventureland right now if you wanted to.  Guest: Then why do they sell tickets just for Adventureland?!  Me: [Moment of realization] If you don't have a park hopper ticket, you can't get into California Adventure across the way...  Guest: Oh! Is that what the place across the street is?  Me: Yes. It's another Disney theme park. If you don't have a park hopper ticket, you won't be able to get in there, but you're fine to go anywhere you want inside of this park.  Guest: Ohhhhh. I thought it was a water park...   In front of the castle:   Guest: Where's the castle?  Me: Right here...?  Guest: No, no, no, the other castle! The big one!  Me: This is the only castle we have.  Guest: No, there's another one! I've seen pictures on the internet of it! It's really big and there's a room on the inside!  Me: That's at Walt Disney World.  Guest: Oh! Where's that? Is that across the street?  Me: ...Walt Disney World is in Florida.  Guest: Oh.   ""Where's the castle?"" is actually more common of a question than one might think. I get it about once a month along the parade route, although usually the castle is out of sight when they're asking it and I assume they're just lost. That's the only time someone's asked me that in front of the castle.  Most of the time, guest questions are understandable once you work out how people arrived at their logic. But you can hear the most interesting questions."

Disneyland,38pg9g,DDotJ,7,Sun Jun 7 07:02:16 2015 UTC,"A ""not true"" thing guests always say is that the purple tea cup is the fastest. A not-true/dumb thing they also say is that the Walt statue with Mickey is Walt himself, because scientists are planning to test on him for resurrection.  It's also funny when guests are in line for the Aladdin show and ask each other if it's a ride, and sometimes they'll come up to me and ask ""is this tower of terror?"", even though ToT is literally right next door to Aladdin. The sign in front of the theatre says ""Aladdin a musical spectacular"" yet sometimes guests will ask if it's the Frozen sing-a-along."

Disneyland,38oxzd,MaLaCoiD,17,Fri Jun 5 18:16:05 2015 UTC,"The only exception... rainy days.  If it rains, plenty of locals who were dropping by will decide not to. You'll still have vacationers, but you cut out most of the locals."

Disneyland,38oxzd,wastintimejp,3,Fri Jun 5 18:17:48 2015 UTC,It used to be true. I used to go every Superbowl Sunday because it's right around my birthday and there used to be no crowds. Guess the word got out. :o(
Disneyland,38oxzd,chandelure,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"Many years ago you could go on Christmas Day and the park would be nearly empty.  I even remember going on Christmas Eve only about ten years ago and the crowds were light.  That was before it became a thing to head to Disneyland right after opening Christmas gifts, of going there for New Years Eve.  Your best bets for finding an empty park anymore is during the off season, and then only on Monday through Thursday (Friday's are sometimes nearly as busy as a weekend, especially in the evening)"
Disneyland,38oxzd,h_lehmann,9,Sat Jun 6 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"http://www.isitpacked.com/disneyland-crowd-forecast-predictor-calendar/  This is a fairly accurate calendar. The ""least crowded"" days will be mid-week in September, October, January, February."
Disneyland,38oxzd,drnuktehgr8t,3,Fri Jun 5 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Late August and early September are the least crowded days of the entire year. Kids will be starting school, and families won't be going on vacation during the first few weeks of school. People also tend to schedule vacations towards the beginning of their break and not the end of their break.  It'll pick up again in October and will be crazy until January. late January and February aren't so bad, but they're not as nice as early September -- there's a lot of couples going in February, and February has many 3-day weekends which cause attendance to go up.  Schools will have spring breaks from March onward, causing crowds to spike. There is a very slight lull in early May, but it's more crowded than anytime in January or February and only gets worse as more and more kids get off of school for the year and go to Disneyland on their vacations.  June is bad, but I've heard July isn't as bad as it could be. Most APs are blocked out, which really helps with the crowds. It's still crowded, but it's not ""I'm going to die"" crowded like it is right now."
Disneyland,38oxzd,EnglishMobster,4,Fri Jun 5 21:10:42 2015 UTC,Definitely NOT.  It is a WEEKEND (lots of people have off) in JUNE (one of the busiest months) on a day where people want to spend time with family.  It will be a perfect storm of BUSY.
Disneyland,38oxzd,collegemathchef,4,Fri Jun 5 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"With the new 60th anniversary celebration going on, I doubt there's going to be any slow days until school starts up again in August/September."
Disneyland,38oxzd,TotoTheBunny,2,Fri Jun 5 20:12:09 2015 UTC,"January and early February. Anything else is a lie, or it may of been true at one point. More and more people are going so the park even on an off day is busier than times prior"
Disneyland,38oxzd,Seanny_Afro_Seed,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:19:50 2015 UTC,"I usually ask three questions to determine if the park will be packed: is is a holiday? Is school out of session? Is there a special event? Answer yes to any of those and the park will be pretty full. Only qualifier is if its raining, and as someone previously stated, us locals dont want to go anyway.   In your situation you're answering yes to two of those and therefore the park will be pretty full."

Disneyland,38rcl4,MaLaCoiD,3,Sat Jun 6 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised I haven't seen others mentioning this. It does seem like the simplest solution would be for them to let you in the park. Have you tried this before?  I considered downvoting you initially because I was torn between this being genius and wrong, but in the end I think it's quite resourceful and would not have a big impact given the number of reservations available. It's seems like a solid plan if it works."
Disneyland,38rcl4,JMTBerserker,2,Sun Jun 7 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"I intend to use the reservation.  Normally I don't make reservations so I can be more agile. During the 24 hour day, some with reservations were let in, while others were still denied. I am sure if you can't use your revaluation due to not being allowed in, they would waive the no-show fee if you call."

It was more for the atmosphere.   I was also there last July and it was quite crowded but we noticed that it didn't start getting overly filled out until about 10am. I definitely recommend getting to the parks at least an hour before opening so that you can be at the front of the line and get in for rope drop - then have a list of the rides you want to hit and work through them early.  I would also suggest booking a table at restaurants for food so that you don't have to wait in line - especially if you are traveling with a group.  in short, be prepared for it to be hot and crowded but amazing!"
Disneyland,38rcl4,mildly_interesting,3,Sun Jun 7 04:27:29 2015 UTC,"Disneyland was doing a ""get in free on your Birthday"" thing   Not this year.   how crowded the park is going to be during the week of Disneyland's original opening day (July 17th)   Is It Packed? Shows a ""Yup it's Packed"" with a ""Forget about it"" on Friday.   the possibility of not being able to enter the park (over capacity)   Really only happens on big days, like Christmas, New Years Eve, and 24 hour day. It may happen on that Friday if there's anything big planned, but so far nothing has been announced."
Disneyland,38rcl4,pixie1818,0,Sat Jun 6 04:06:34 2015 UTC,Too bad. Thanks for the insight. I didn't know there was a website that forcasted that far in the future.
Disneyland,38rcl4,Melkor1,2,Mon Jun 8 00:26:49 2015 UTC,It's always a good idea to arrive when the park opens or be at the gate prior to opening. The first hour after opening is when the lines are relatively short.

(There's actually another one as well -- I used to have it on my CM lanyard, but I can't find it online for some reason.) There's literally a pin for everything.  The only exception would be Marvel things, for some reason. They have all the Avengers and pretty much anyone who has a Disney movie to their name, but Marvel characters like Galactus don't have a pin yet. Rocket Racoon has a pin, but Star-Lord and Groot don't. The Avengers pins are brand-new (about a month old, if that), so they are rolling them out -- albeit slowly. I don't know why Marvel pins have been taking so long, since Marvel merchandise is everywhere else, even for properties like Spider-Man where Disney doesn't own the movie rights.  Star Wars, on the other hand, has a ton of pins. Ever wanted a Bossk pin? They have it. How about Kit Fisto and Commander Cody? And they keep making more!  Every now and again, you'll see a pin that has a little silver Mickey head on it. It'll usually say ""Hidden Mickey Pin, n of N"" on it (where n is the number of that pin within its set, and N is the total number of pins). These are ""Hidden Mickey"" pins -- as the back would imply -- and what's special about these is that they can only be found on cast member lanyards."

Disneyland,38ot5w,PyroToniks,7,Fri Jun 5 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"Don't waste your single park pass on DCA.   You can get a bread bowl for $2.50 at Stage Door- maybe bring something to dip it in, like a soup that's good at room temperature. Or share a hot soupy bread bowl from there, Royal Street Veranda or Harbor Galley for $10. Jalapeño cheese pretzels at Coke Corner, Bengal BBQ or some carts are a good value. The corn by Matterhorn or Mark Twain is delicious. Or just pig out on one meal at the Big Thunder BBQ ($24, and dinner is a few bucks more but includes corn) and eat snacks the rest of the time. Definitely see Paint the Night. You can either brave the crowds by waiting a few hours on Main Street for the fireworks, or have more room by Small World. The 11p run (Main Street to Small World) is much less crowded. Best place to see fireworks is in front of Candy Palace on Main Street. Ideally you can sneak onto the street without having to wait 2+ hours before the 8:50p run of Paint the Night happens. I'm still trying to figure this out. Magical Map is a good way to rest your feet and see a variety of characters. Get a Fast Pass for the Frozen show at Royal Theater- it's so funny. Of course you're going to be using Fast Passes wisely, so get through the rest of the lines quickly by enjoying animated conversation, hopefully with your neighbors- don't be shy. Bring an external battery pack, so you can use your phone to play Heads Up or something in lines. Hit the Mountains and Indy first thing, as they'll be swarmed with Grads. Escape to Tom Sawyer's Island to explore. If they're running, the Explorer Canoes are a memorable experience. If you're just done with lines/waiting, you could search for Hidden Mickeys.   Attractions with usually a short wait:   Tiki Room Tarzan's Tree House Columbia & Mark Twain Winnie the Pooh Big Thunder Ranch Petting Zoo Carousel (sometimes Pinocchio, Snow White, & Tea Cups too). Toontown (Rides will be long, but you can explore the structures.) Monorail to LEGO store Magic Eye theater (by Space Mountain). Check out Tomorrowland Exhibit- very cool. Great Moments with Abe Lincoln"
Disneyland,38ot5w,MaLaCoiD,2,Fri Jun 5 19:19:16 2015 UTC,just wanted to emphasize to bring an external battery!! it saved my life when my battery was running out at 3:30 or so after I had been in the park all day

Disneyland,38ot5w,opking,3,Fri Jun 5 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"There is a picnic area just outside of the main gates to Disneyland. They allow you to bring food in to that area. Back when I was a kid, we didn't have much money, so we'd bring sandwiches and have lunch at the picnic area. There are also lockers to put your food into, so you don't have to carry it all over the park.  Enjoy yourself :D"
Disneyland,38ot5w,jch708,3,Fri Jun 5 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Depending on whether you're going on a weekend, my girlfriend and I just went last Friday (which was also a grad night) and the lines weren't that affected, but now that more schools are probably out, you might add 20-30 minutes to your wait time.  One of the best things you can do with your girlfriend, I've found, is take a traincar ride around towards park closing (or at least later in the night). Sometimes you'll get your own car (this is like, really close to park close, or during the 11pm Paint The Night) and it's quite romantic.  Also, don't be afraid to just be off the cuff. You obviously want to hit as many rides/big things as possible, but many of the mid-day shows are pretty enjoyable (Mickey and the Magical Map, Frozen Play) and a good way to take a break, but still do something.   And Disneyland Forever is your main focus. If you both love Disney, it's a fantastic testament to the park/lore and to those who love it."
Disneyland,38ot5w,merpina11,3,Fri Jun 5 18:11:15 2015 UTC,"The benefit of DCA is that you can drink there. I also would echo the sentiment that if you have a 1 day ticket, you should go to Disneyland. However, if you want an adult beverage, there are many places in Downtown Disney to satisfy that craving."
Disneyland,38ot5w,PicklePants84,2,Fri Jun 5 19:41:57 2015 UTC,I agree stick to Disneyland instead. I also want to add that you should bring a backpack with snacks and stuff because that gets super expensive and can help cut costs!
Disneyland,38ot5w,cinepro,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"Don't miss Fantasmic.   When people wait for the parade (sometimes for hours), they sit down and take up lots of room.  About 20 minutes before the parade, they have to stand up (and the strollers are removed from the area).  That creates lots of extra space.  That's when you want to duck under the rope and stand in that extra space. If you need a phone charge, the lockers on Main Street have lockers with charging stations.  But battery packs are cheap these days, so get one before you go. If you're not big eaters, the Mexican restaurant in Frontierland has pretty big burritos (with beans and rice on the side) that can fill two people up.  If you are big eaters, those burrito plates will really fill you up.  It's usually my only meal of the day (supplemented by snacks). ""Mousewait"" is a very good app that has reliable wait-time info for rides so you don't have to walk across the park to find out how long the wait is for a ride. And again, do not miss Fantasmic.  Get Fast Passes for it, and get to the queue with plenty of time so you can get a good spot. I recommend doing the 8:50pm Parade (view on Main Street or the Main Street side of the hub) , then Fireworks (stand in Main Street after the parade is over), then 10:45 Fantasmic (run over to the queue after the fireworks are over)."

So we finally get to the Winnie the Pooh ride, have to ride it twice and when we get out she sees the characters. Well the characters were amazing and played in to everything she did. She hugged pooh for what seemed to be a good 5 minutes and just stared at him. When she told Winnie that she rode the pooh train, Winnie did the raise the roof sign and after that she would raise the roof whenever she told someone about the pooh train because Winnie did it.   If the characters that do tigger, eeyore, and pooh thank you for being awesome. Made her trip incredible."

Disneyland,38ktwc,betheballfelicity,6,Fri Jun 5 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"I have never been to Disneyland alone, but I have always thought it would be nice to get a frozen lemonade or a Starbucks Frappuccino and sit on the porch on main street and people watch."
Disneyland,38ktwc,tangyworld,4,Fri Jun 5 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"Make sure to take advantage of the few rides that have Single Rider Lines! It also makes for a really fun day if you stay open minded and talk to people around you while you're waiting on line. It's always interesting to see where people are coming from and what their story is. This day is about you though, so really just do whatever the heck you want and it'll be epic regardless because you'll be at Disneyland!"
Disneyland,38ktwc,icanbeyourzero,3,Fri Jun 5 01:41:25 2015 UTC,Bring the best camera you own and practice using manual settings. There's a lot of details to capture and try getting some unique angles as well.
Disneyland,38ktwc,shutter_release,2,Fri Jun 5 05:30:26 2015 UTC,Solo photo days are so much fun at the park.
Disneyland,38ktwc,kethryvis,2,Fri Jun 5 06:44:29 2015 UTC,Best camera I own is my android phone:( Maybe I can convince my dad to let me use his ;)

Disneyland,38ktwc,amphoe,3,Fri Jun 5 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"Going to parks alone can be super fun! You can browse as long as you want, ride whatever you want, it's much easier to get a good spot for shows because it's just 1 of you as opposed to a group."
Disneyland,38ktwc,YippysKid,3,Fri Jun 5 04:49:21 2015 UTC,be sure to get fast passes on the rides you like. get a fast pass as soon as you can and then as soon as its available again.
Disneyland,38ktwc,Techsupportvictim,3,Fri Jun 5 05:56:29 2015 UTC,I've been alone quite often. I have always found it to be very satisfying.  Eat early and stay one step ahead of the crowds. Treat yourself to a Fantasmic Dessert or something decadent just because. Have fun!
Disneyland,38ktwc,AressVeran,3,Fri Jun 5 06:04:08 2015 UTC,Ride what you want with having to debate with others. Eat what you want etc.  I love to go and get a seat on the patio at Cafe Orleans for beignets and coffee and just people watch.
Disneyland,38ktwc,frankieee14,3,Fri Jun 5 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"I went solo recently and ""discovered"" Fowler's Harbor for lunch, specifically the additional seating area around the bend. You get to sit next to Columbia if she happens to be berthed there while they ready her for the show. It's a nice, out of the way spot that I found quite pleasant.   Edit: Also, need a break from the parks? I chilled in the lobby of the Californian. Discovered they have story telling time by the hearth. It's definitely geared for kids but just the fact that they have it is kind of amazing. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't been in solo-exploration mode. :-)"

Disneyland,38mgyn,Snava2,2,Fri Jun 5 04:11:24 2015 UTC,"I've no experience getting Fantasmic fastpasses, so I'm of no help to you there. But if it's anything like trying to get fastpasses for the second World of Color showing, it's an inexact science. Your best bet will be either an on-the-go meal or Fantasmic dining package at River Belle Terrace or the Blue Bayou. This will ensure you get fastpasses for the show you want without having to check back at distribution throughout the day."
Disneyland,38mgyn,dodgepodge,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:37:57 2015 UTC,I've gotten fantasmic fast passes for both showings and you are correct it is a very inexact science. I would recommend getting the first showing and the earliest tickets. They are by far the best seats and completely turned me around on the show. I am a WOC fanatic and completely disregarded fantasmic getting great seats was all the difference. I don't remember the color codes for where we sat but I got the fast passes first thing in the morning. When I got the second showing passes we got there around 4 and definitely got the blue passes but we're too late to sit up front and it just wasn't worth it.
Disneyland,38mgyn,King_of_the_Nerds,2,Fri Jun 5 07:23:04 2015 UTC,Saw the second show of Fantasmic last night without a fastpass. The CMs remove the railings right before the show start and I was lucky enough to be there when it happened. Everyone with fastpass were sitting on the ground so I still got to experience Fantasmic with a great view:
Disneyland,38mgyn,heyawildchild,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:38:56 2015 UTC,"The last time I went my bf, we checked back 2-3 times throughout the day and the second show wasn't available until around 3-4ish. If you don't plan on getting a dining package, I would check back every couple rides/hours after noon or try calling Otto :)"
Disneyland,38oqss,Aviz88,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:28:47 2015 UTC,What's your experience? Mickey is often closed in the morning. Toy Story is your best bet.
Disneyland,38oqss,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered about that. Why is Mickey closed in the morning?  It always felt that they were punishing people for getting up early and forcing them to park far away in toy story.  Once we figured that out, we stopped getting there early."
Disneyland,38oqss,elmatador12,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"I prefer Toy Story lots early in the morning. There seem to be more buses, and I always feel like there is less walking to my car afterwards. Every time I've parked at Mickey and Friends, there always seems to be more of a wait for a shuttle. It feels a lot less crowded by getting dropped off via bus."
Disneyland,38oqss,SushiRoe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:28:58 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I've always felt the opposite. I always seem to be waiting for buses for a long time and walking a far way to get to my car when I park at toy story.  Mickey I seem to rarely have a problem getting in and out. The only major time it gets backed up is leaving right after the fireworks.
Disneyland,38oqss,elmatador12,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"I've usually had quick bus service and not a walk farther than Mickey.  But if you're with kids, Toy Story has no bathrooms and walking back to it while they're asleep in a stroller is much worse."
Disneyland,38oqss,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:33:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. I like to park Mickey first thing in the morning because we'll probably be leaving in the afternoon and our car might be shaded.  Maybe it's because the savvy folks who arrive for rope drop know that Toy Story is quicker than Mickey a lot of the time?
Disneyland,38oqss,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that coming from the 5 South, that the overpass going towards Mickey & Friends is totally backed up right before rope drop. This might be a traffic issue for the city. If you are unlucky, being placed in the far back corner of M&F means a lot of walking."
Disneyland,38k9mj,mamamonkey,9,Thu Jun 4 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"You can book your reservations a maximum of two months in advance, and it never hurts to do it early."

I have lots of friend who do WDW and the amount of pre-planning seems completely insane! ADRs 120 days ahead, boooo!"
Disneyland,38k9mj,MooMaddy,3,Thu Jun 4 22:02:54 2015 UTC,I know! Every time I've gone to WDW I've tried to get a reservation at Ohana months and months in advance and am always thwarted.  I'm happy just getting a Dole Whip at the pineapple lanai though.
Disneyland,38k9mj,TomCollinsEsq,3,Thu Jun 4 23:51:58 2015 UTC,You'd be two months late at 120. They open at 180 in WDW. ;)
Disneyland,38k9mj,TomCollinsEsq,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:19:49 2015 UTC,And this is why I love Disneyland so much. :D  So much more relaxed...
Disneyland,38k9mj,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,3,Fri Jun 5 03:16:42 2015 UTC,"Well, ""relaxed"" is kind of all in a manner of speaking, isn't it? While a trip to WDW seems to require more planning, once I've done that planning and I'm in the park, I can relax.  I've got my 3 FP+ in my back pocket, and I know I'm going to do those things.  Food? Lunch and dinner are all set.  All I have to do is show up.  Heck, at some restaurants, I can order in advance, show up for my reservation, and food I pre-ordered just arrives.  The trip itself is relaxed.  A trip to DLR, on the other hand, is wonderful, intimate, and great.  But you have to be aggressively working the FP system to really get it all in, and hustling about the park to the things you can't FP because you're already holding one.  So while it's Walt's park, and it's wonderful, is it more or less ""relaxed""? That all depends on how you're using the word, I figure."
Disneyland,38k9mj,AnubisEight,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:08:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's a good point... those are really great benefits of pre-booking things.  I guess the better word is flexible? For how we tour the park anyways (three kids of various ages, different priorities, a lot of compromise)."
Disneyland,38k9mj,disneyfacts,8,Sun Jun 7 23:14:19 2015 UTC,"You can only book dinner reservations 60 days out, but it seem entertainment schedules aren't completely put around that time.   I'd say take your best guess and you can reschedule if needed as long as you give 24 hours notice."
Disneyland,38k9mj,YoeSafBridge,2,Thu Jun 4 20:21:00 2015 UTC,Wolfram Alpha can tell you what date is 60 days in advance of another quickly. E.g.: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=60+days+before+Dec+12%2C+2015
Disneyland,38k9mj,IAmMikki,6,Thu Jun 4 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Sooner is better, but if you don't mind eating later at night, you could possibly get a reservation the day of. We went at the start of spring break and got a reservation for 9pm that was reserved on the day we went."
Disneyland,38k9mj,climb-via-is-stupid,3,Thu Jun 4 22:39:29 2015 UTC,"I've made blue bayou reservations pretty close to the day of, but I wouldn't reccomend it!  I'm so excited for our next trip, I'll be booking as soon as I can."
Disneyland,38k9mj,Jonny_Fairplay,3,Thu Jun 4 20:36:32 2015 UTC,"It can't hurt to make your reservations 60 days in advance, if for some reason plans change you can cancel your reservations (I think 24 hours in advance) without penelty.   Depending on how many days you're going to be there, perhaps look into booking a dining package for both WoC and Fantasmic, that way you can eat at Blue Bayou and fit in World of Color. You might also consider Blue Bayou for lunch, that way it wouldn't conflict with any of the nighttime entertainment."
Disneyland,38k9mj,Hyperminimalism,2,Thu Jun 4 21:15:35 2015 UTC,We're hoping to do WoC/Fantasmic with the kids but dining package won't really work - it's just too long for them. Very tempting though! Maybe once they're older.  We had to change reservations once before (had Surf's Up breakfast but kids picked up a tummy bug - they were happy to change it for us!). The CMs are so nice!

Disneyland,38ir9w,pietrail,6,Thu Jun 4 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"This is true. It's not like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter where you can get a Hogsmeade postmark. An Anaheim postmark isn't super exciting, sadly."
Disneyland,38ir9w,dodgepodge,4,Thu Jun 4 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I tried it once with a postcard to my folks and then they sent a pic to me, just a boring ol' Anaheim stamp... :("
Disneyland,38ir9w,michaelmatzur,3,Thu Jun 4 17:52:04 2015 UTC,Can you explain this? You can send mail from Wizarding world of Harry Potter and it will say hogs Meade on it?
Disneyland,38ir9w,mybaby51,2,Thu Jun 4 22:41:24 2015 UTC,The Hogsmeade post office has its own postmark. They stamp it by hand. You can actually get postcards/letters postmarked and send them from anywhere later on.

Disneyland,38ir9w,MrPoppagergio,3,Fri Jun 5 16:06:42 2015 UTC,"This is true. It's just Anaheim, not specifically from Disneyland. A CM did tell me that Disney World has their own postmark though."
Disneyland,38ir9w,Coco92144,3,Thu Jun 4 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"It's true and makes me sad. This is one of the things I would like to see brought back to the park. The mailboxes are such a nice touch, but there is really no point without the postmark."

Disneyland,38klhy,YoeSafBridge,5,Thu Jun 4 20:46:10 2015 UTC,I have not been to WDW since I was a kid so I can't say how much of the rides are the same but I think you would be hard pressed to spend two full days in CA. We often do three days at the parks and do two at DL and one in CA. Also it's my understanding that there is not much difference in price if any between lunch and dinner at the fancier places to eat at the parks so I don't know thy it matters money wise when you do which. I personally would prefer doing a nice sit down meal after a long day of walking around the park and take a quicker lunch in the middle of the day. I do recommend Cathay Circle as we went there last year for my birthday. I have not gone to any of the other fancier places to compare though.
Disneyland,38klhy,Lollybrubs,4,Fri Jun 5 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"TBH, you could probably reverse it and do two days at DL and one day at DCA; i'm an AP holder and we regularly do everything we want to do in DCA in one day. If nothing else, do a DCA day, do your DL day, and see which park has more left over that you want to do.   DL wise, if you haven't had Plaza Inn yet... oh you should. Their Fried Chicken is heaven. Also, don't pass up Carnation Cafe on Main Street, everything there is super good. Jolly Holiday is a favorite too, it's sandwiches and soups and bakery items.   Dunno if you're planning on any night-time events, but if you want to see Fantasmic, that's by FastPass these days. There's freebees of course, but there are also dinner packages at Blue Bayou and River Belle. i haven't had either of the packages so i can't comment on how good they are. But if you're wanting to hit BB and see Fantasmic, that would not be a terrible option.  As for DCA... again not sure how you guys are on the nighttime stuff, but Carthay Circle has a World of Color lunch/dinner menu that gets you really nice fastpasses for that show. Also on that list is Ariel's Grotto... i'll be there tomorrow night for a WoC dinner :)  Other food wise... i really recommend SmokeJumpers, which is the new-ish burger place next to Soarin'. It's... really freaking good actually! There's also Paradise Garden Grill which has kind of middle eastern style fare, and it's right next to Boardwalk Pizza and Pasta if one wants one and the other wants the other :)   And don't overlook Downtown Disney! Which, unlike at WDW, is super easy to get to from the parks since it's... literally right outside the esplanade. Earl of Sandwich is a place i can't end a trip to Disney without hitting at least once!"
Disneyland,38klhy,kethryvis,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"I'm also an AP holder, but I don't live nearby so I don't get to do as many trips (I still go enough to have made the pass worthwhile though!) the reason we were thinking of CA over DL is because we will be spending two plus days at magic kingdom in WDW in November, and he is really into roller coasters, which I love, but I have no preference over which really. I like the idea of making the choice when we get there, and since our first day there is my birthday I think I'd like to do CA first so we can go to Carthay circle for birthday dinner.  I heard that Plaza has a great character breakfast, and I truly wanted to do it, but with our hotel offering breakfast it seems like an extra expense :(.  I've heard good things about the BB fantastic package, if we do that for dinner we will probably do that, the last time we went the only show we saw was Aladdin, and we loved it!"
Disneyland,38klhy,lem0nster,3,Fri Jun 5 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"As a fellow RunDisneyer (/r/rundisney!), eat something familiar the night before your races. Nothing good comes of having an unhappy tummy when running 13.1 miles.   And maybe I'll see you at Wine and Dine!  As for the similar rides at WDW, there was a massive post that I helped contribute to on /r/waltdisneyworld that I've linked here. Hopefully it provides some insight."

Walking distance to the park, clean rooms, pet friendly, has a nice pool area with a firepit, FRIENDLY staff at the front, walking distance to everything. HIGHLY recommend!   DO NOT STAY AT MOTEL 6 MAINGATE IT IS DISGUSTING. Even for the price it's not worth it! I've stayed twice and both times were a mistake. It's filthy."

Disneyland,38dzdt,trisity,2,Thu Jun 4 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"We always stay at the Doubletree Suites on Harbor and Orangewood. We like the fact that there is a separate bedroom/living room so if we want to take a break for a while, people can take a nap while others can just hang out in the living room. It's always clean and we've just always had a pleasant stay. They have a decent breakfast buffet but otherwise the restaurant is pretty ""meh"". we usually eat elsewhere."
Disneyland,38dzdt,SylvesterMarcus,2,Thu Jun 4 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"If you can book it, the Travelodge behind the Cast Member lot is great and cheap. Not the greatest place, but it's also less than a ten minute walk to the trams.  Stayed at the Quality Inn last weekend and it was really great too, but I think I just got a good deal."
Disneyland,38dzdt,jch708,2,Thu Jun 4 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"We just stayed at Red Lion. Paid 90 dollars, it was clean and we had a view of Tot! We could also see fireworks from our window."

Disneyland,38dzdt,MomoPeacheZ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:24:04 2015 UTC,"you can still see the fireworks very clearly if you get a room on the pool side of the hotel. and a little insider-tip for you... they'll let you park your car there until 3pm on the day you check-out. which is enough time to get up and pack your car, check out, and then go to the park(s) for a few rides."

Disneyland,38dzdt,MomoPeacheZ,2,Tue Jun 9 21:13:48 2015 UTC,I trade off between the Grand Californian and Disneyland hotel. CM discount makes it way more affordable and it's so much fun.
Disneyland,38dzdt,jennafezz,2,Fri Jun 5 00:44:02 2015 UTC,Disneyland Hotel! Love the convenience and the atmosphere. Cant bring myself to stay off property.
Disneyland,38dzdt,veezy55,2,Fri Jun 5 05:24:13 2015 UTC,"We loved the Park Vue inn, free breakfast and free parking and literally across the street from the main entrance , 5 min walk and about as close as you can get without staying on property . We also stayed at the carousel inn which is right next door to park Vue . It wasn't bad but there was no breakfast and you paid to park . Desert Palms was nice and also has free parking and breakfast and it's around the corner next to Candy Cane inn , about  15 min walk ."
Disneyland,38dzdt,Bec2dae,2,Fri Jun 5 12:43:35 2015 UTC,"Candy Cane Inn is right next to the park.  It is a short walk to the entrance, but they do offer a shuttle.  We have stayed at the Red Lion Inn a handful of times.  The prices are good and a little further than the Candy Cane, but if you are OK walking then its worth it.  Hotel Menage is across the freeway about the same distance as Red Lion (in the opposite direction).  It's a nicer hotel with an updated lobby and outdoor bar.  Nice if you want to get away from the Disney ambiance when you arent in the park.  I always see The Annabella hotel brought up here.  We havent stayed there before but might be worth checking out.  They are close the the Paradise Pier and Grand CA hotels."
Disneyland,38dzdt,campl0,2,Thu Jun 4 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"I stayed at The Annabella two years ago and I was pleased. It was decently priced and my room was clean. I've mentioned it on this sub before but the only thing I had a problem with was the AC... I didn't realize that you had to leave your room key in the wall otherwise the AC would shut off in the middle of the night. It was about a 10 minute walk going west on Katella and then north on Disneyland drive and cutting through the lobby of the Grand Californian to get to Downtown Disney. I would definitely stay there again if I was staying offsite.   Last year I stayed at the Grand Californian and was really happy with that choice. It depends on what you're looking for, obviously Disney hotels will be much more expensive than non-Disney owned, but I loved being able to run back to our room in the middle of the day to grab something I may have forgotten, change clothes, take a nap, etc. My fiancé had a nasty cold last year unfortunately so it ended up being a lifesaver during that vacation so that he could get a little rest in the middle of the day and actually enjoy himself. That being said, no matter where you stay you'll be at Disneyland and you will have a great time!"
Disneyland,38dzdt,10pizzasx12bucks,2,Thu Jun 4 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, Grand CA is TOO convenient.  Did you just buy something?  Give to a CM and it gets delivered to your room.  Tired?  Shortest walk back to a hotel EVER.  Relax by the fire?  They have a fire going on in the lobby with comfortable benches, recliners, and rocking chairs.  I wish we could stay there every trip, but it is expensive"
Disneyland,38dzdt,campl0,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"stovalls best western was nice. the free breakfast was ok. we've stayed at the annabella a few times because it has suites. both are walking distance and not too far for older kids. stovalls was cheap last time we went. since we're local, amenities are not a concern for us but i think they had a splash pad for kids by the pool."
Disneyland,38dzdt,godwins_law_34,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"The Ramada Maingate is the best. You can walk to the park, free breakfast, good rooms, good service, right next to Denny's."

Disneyland,38dzdt,Mudkipmurron,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"If you just want a room to fall asleep in at night, the Howard Johnson is great.  If you want the whole experience, Disneyland Hotel or the Grand Californian.  We just did 3 nights at the Grand and loved every minute of it.  It's so convenient to go back to your room for lunch, spend the afternoon at the pool, then head back to the park."
Disneyland,38dzdt,ScoobsFXT,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:08:19 2015 UTC,Grand Californian only. It can not be beat. Save your money it is well worth it.
Disneyland,38dzdt,mistrhide,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:16:41 2015 UTC,The motel 6 is a great price and not too far from the park.
Disneyland,38dzdt,disneyfacts,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:16:20 2015 UTC,"I second the Motel 6. I also suggest the Ramada (Maingate) on Harbor and the Super 8 on Katella. You can get some seriously good deals at all 3.   We've stayed at Anaheim Plaza once before, it was a great price, but the rooms smelled a bit odd and it seems like it doubles as a permanent residence for some, but there were some seriously sketchy characters running around there when we stayed. Maybe it was just an off night. Still decent for the price!  All of the hotels are within walking distance, which is great because some times just you just need a nap and a break from the heat."

Disneyland,38e5f2,skraptastic,7,Wed Jun 3 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"They seem common. Just grabbed one at Plaza Inn today for $10, they were just all set up on a tray near the drinks for grabbing."

Disneyland,38e5f2,horizontalcracker,4,Thu Jun 4 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"Don't think they're rare, they're kinda cheaply made to be honest"

Not sure how common they are since, but they told me they would be around for the summer, but they weren't sure exactly when. I got mine at Village Haus, also saw them at the Plaza Inn. Sorry I'm not more helpful, but you might as well wait and see if you're going in a couple weeks."
Disneyland,38e5f2,hereit_goes,2,Thu Jun 4 04:40:07 2015 UTC,i saw them last weekend at the mexican restaurant in frontierland.
Disneyland,38e5f2,Msmaryc56,2,Thu Jun 4 06:32:33 2015 UTC,There was a lot left this week at the plaza inn! 😊
Disneyland,38e5f2,jch708,2,Thu Jun 4 08:00:50 2015 UTC,Was there last week. $10 for full drink and stein. Basically a plastic souvenir sipper done up real nice.  Edit for clarity of answer to the question: They are very common. Plaza Inn and most in-door restaurants seemed to have them.
Disneyland,38ekbg,larissalei,7,Wed Jun 3 18:19:20 2015 UTC,First Visit Pin Beignets at the Mint Julep bar in New Orleans Square Get fast pass for indy jones right away Plaza inn for a good fried chicken dinner it's a huge serving that's shareable(the sides maybe not)
Disneyland,38ekbg,TKG8,7,Thu Jun 4 18:15:12 2015 UTC,"I suggest Blue Bayou, WDW doesn't really have anything like it, at least that we could find when we were there. This would fall into your ""fancier"" category. Make reservations and ask for a table by the water, watch the boats from Pirates float by and enjoy the atmosphere.  I 100% suggest you get the Gumbo from the Royal Street Veranda, they also have Clam Chowder. Both served in a giant bread bowl, you could absolutely share one between the both of you! Don't forget to get an order of Fritters. Sometimes they have just standard ones, but they also have random flavors. Banana, Gingerbread (Christmas time), Pumpkin (halloweentime) and some others in between.  Churros don't seem to be a big thing at WDW but you will run into a churro cart on every other corner at Disneyland.   Bengal BBQ is also one of our favorites. It's not traditional BBQ. They have beef, chicken and veggie skewers with a few different sauces. Both sweet and spicy, all delicious.  If you make it over to California Adventure, which I assume you will, go to the Cozy Cone Motel and get a Red's Apple Freeze and some pretzel bites. (It's the same drink that they serve at Gaston's pub, I can't remember what they call it)  Also at DCA, Corndog Castle. Says it all in the title. And I really like Lucky Fortune Cookery on the pier. The mexican food place right near there is delicious as well.  Carthary Circle would be a great fancier place for you two and probably Napa Rose. I personally have never been there but I only hear fantastic things.  I know this is an obnoxiously long post, but I hope it helps! Congrats on your marriage and enjoy Hawaii and Disneyland!"
Disneyland,38ekbg,CanYou_Not,6,Thu Jun 4 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"I second Bengal BBQ - get the bacon wrapped asparagus for sure!  And I really, really like the mexican place on the pier in DCA. And my hubby and I are going for a date night sans children to Blue Bayou on our next trip, but I haven't been before.  And I know it's not for everyone, but I LOVE Trader Sam's Enchanted Tiki Bar in the Disneyland Hotel and I highly recommend heading over there one night.  Get an Uh Oa, Shipwreck, or Krakatoa Punch!"
Disneyland,38ekbg,mamamonkey,2,Thu Jun 4 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, the bacon asparagus!! Trader Sam's! I have only been there once. I really need to go back!"
Disneyland,38ekbg,CanYou_Not,7,Thu Jun 4 19:02:31 2015 UTC,Blue Bayou is a must.  I also really enjoy the Big Thunder BBQ.  Great food and atmosphere at both.
Disneyland,38ekbg,Jay-c58,3,Thu Jun 4 16:38:34 2015 UTC,How did I forget about Big Thunder BBQ?! Good call. :)
Disneyland,38ekbg,CanYou_Not,6,Thu Jun 4 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"Questions: how long are you staying, and what type of eating (snack, quick-service, fancy-ish) are we talking about?"
Disneyland,38ekbg,dodgepodge,3,Thu Jun 4 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for something special, definitely book dinner at Napa Rose Chef's Counter, located inside the Grand Californian it's about $100 per person, however the chef prepared a meal especially for you and it's incredible. Enjoy drinks at Trader Sam's, located at The Disneyland Hotel.  I would suggest getting Photopass+, if you book 14 days in advance, it's $69, which I agree is a lot of money for photos but considering you're there as part of your honeymoon, I would say it's worth it. In addition, you get all of your ride photos (Tower of Terror, California Screamin', Splash Mountain, Space Mountain).   Make sure to get a button from Town Hall celebrating your Honeymoon, sometimes those buttons can get you special treatment and they're a great free sourvineer.  Places to eat: Carnation Cafe, it's a great place to go and sit down for any meal. In DCA, Carthay Circle is fancy and I enjoy eating at Wine Country Trattoria. One of my favorite places to eat in the park is Flo's V8, the food is so-so but it's stunning to sit outside overlooking Radiator Springs Racers.  If you don't know about Radiator Springs Racers, if you don't have Magic Morning, go straight to the Fastpass line when the park opens. If you DO have Magic Morning, I personally suggest riding Toy Story Mania (similar to WDW, but still fun and doesn't have fastpass) and ride other things until about 15 min before opening, get in line for fastpass then, that way you won't have wasted your morning in line and you will get a fastpass. Radiator Springs Racers also has a single rider line, so if you're okay with the gamble of not sitting together, you can get on with a much shorter wait."

I'm always interested in seeing how different skippers approach it, and it's especially entertaining when they have original material.

Disneyland,38ah9m,drkatherine1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:08:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for your insights into the pin issue. I am going on Monday to celebrate my 60th birthday. I have been going to Disneyland to celebrate many occasions for years. I started trading pins about 8 years ago. I was unaware of the issues with counterfeits and scrappers until this year. On many occasions I would trade pins I had bought in Disneyland for Hidden Mickeys. I was really taken a a I when I read on a pin trading forum that up to 95% of pins on CM's lanyards could be counterfeit or scrappers. I really didn't want to be trading items I purchased for items that were now worthless. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out to me.
Disneyland,38ah9m,darthjediLEX,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:52:14 2015 UTC,"I've found many a fakes on the boards in the replenishment centers and when I would let them know it was a fake they really didn't care...  I've been trading for 11 years, 2010 I stopped when the fakes became too much.  I started using my personal pins to trade while I was at work- but ended up getting so many fakes I stopped reading all together.. Miss it though"
Disneyland,38ah9m,JediWithRedEyes,9,Wed Jun 3 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"Not a CM but from what I was told is that certain CM do trade their own personal pins if they have some but most are just ""checked"" out when clocking in."
Disneyland,38ah9m,epotosi,4,Fri Jun 5 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"This is why I can't pin trade - I feel so bad for the cast member in case it was a pin they really wanted to keep, since I heard off hand you can't say no to a trade."
Disneyland,38ah9m,EnglishMobster,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:40:53 2015 UTC,/u/EnglishMobster can you help me with a new term you used? I am unfamiliar with the term mystery pin. What is that?
Disneyland,38ah9m,darthjediLEX,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:03:17 2015 UTC,"A ""mystery pin"" is just a pin that is backwards on a CM's lanyard. You're still allowed to trade it -- you just can't see it. It's either a really good pin or a really bad pin, and you have to take a gamble over whether it's good or bad.  I like to start off my lanyard with a ""popular"" pin as a mystery pin -- usually a Stitch, Vinylnation, or Star Wars pin if I have one. When a guest makes a gamble and asks to trade for my mystery pin, I make the trade and then ask them to choose my new mystery pin. They'll select one of the pins on my lanyard to make into a mystery pin, which I'll flip around. The next guest who trades for that mystery pin will choose the next mystery pin, and so on. Each time a guest chooses my mystery pin, I let them select which regular pin to turn into a mystery pin.  It's fun to watch how tempted some people get, since it is basically Disney-approved gambling. Sometimes people will ask me for hints as to what kind of pin it is, which allows me to ask them trivia questions regarding the pin. It's fun to try to come up with the trivia questions, and it's fun to watch the guest try to work out what the pin could possibly be based on the trivia questions. If they guess correctly, I show them the pin and they get to decide whether they want to trade for it or not.  Not every CM does the mystery pin thing, but it's a good way to keep guests interested. It also prevents guests from immediately jumping on you if you have a very popular pin (like a Stitch pin), and it doubles as a good way to get rid of a pin that has been stuck on your lanyard for ages."
Disneyland,38ah9m,darthjediLEX,-1,Wed Jun 3 15:32:05 2015 UTC,The ones with their names on them are not their personal lanyard.  They are either a trainer or lead  In 2009 for the lead appreciation party every lead was given a red lanyard with their name on it. Every trainer got a black lanyard with their name on it.   We aren't allowed to wear lanyards with our names on them anymore.
Disneyland,38ah9m,keti24,-2,Wed Jun 3 18:05:28 2015 UTC,I've been there 8 years and for the past 4 I've been trying to get my name on my lanyard and I've been told no...  So I donno what department your friend is in but it is against the rules to have names on the back of lanyards.
Disneyland,38ah9m,MyDisneyExperience,5,Thu Jun 4 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, some CM can recognize a counterfeit and they will scrap it so it's out of circulation, but others don't know the signs, or they know some but not others, so they will just trade them back out to the public"
Disneyland,38ah9m,keti24,2,Thu Jun 4 08:55:40 2015 UTC,I am glad to see that there are some CM's who see there is an issue and make an effort to take them out of circulation.  I was under the assumption that they had to account for all pins they took out that day with the same number of pins brought back.  So how would they be able to toss those that are not legit?
Disneyland,38ah9m,emmalcolm,8,Fri Jun 5 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"When the lanyards are refreshed backstage, generally we pull the fake pins out and put them aside"
Disneyland,38ah9m,frayfrega,2,Fri Jun 5 00:39:31 2015 UTC,It is refreshing to know that at least there is some effort to try to be part of the solution. I thank you and appreciate your effort.
Disneyland,38ah9m,MegamanDS,-1,Fri Jun 5 01:33:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they throw them in the garbage. If they do need to account for pins, they probably log the fakes and dispose of them through the company. I honestly have no idea though. I only know this because last time I went I suddenly became very interested in pin trading and ordered a lot online, only to discover when they came that 75% of them were fakes and came to this sub for advice. I chose to only trade with CMs in the hope that the fake ones would leave circulation. And also, it made me less worried about receiving fake ones in response. I do feel some guilt, contributing to the problem, but I feel it is so rampant, and there are so many unaware people, that throwing away interesting pins because they were fake was a waste. I didn't trade any that were limited edition or anything like that, I didn't want to make someone super excited only to find a fake. But I still feel a little bad."

Disneyland,389uva,Duckman93,2,Tue Jun 2 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"I applied in March, however, I got wait-listed after my interview (scheduled a week after I applied) due to having school, which caused scheduling reasons. I told the woman who interviewed me that I would end school in May, which was when I got an email from the casting center later. The email then told me to schedule an onboarding meeting (for paperwork), and gave me an orientation date 3 weeks later, in June.  So all in all, it took 3 months, but that's ONLY because I was put on the waiting list. At my onboarding meeting, I talked to the others who told me that it took them about a week to hear back from Disney after the interview. So it probably took them about 2 weeks or so"

It was his first time going to the parks being tall enough to ride on the BIG rides. We went straight to Radiator Springs because he had a couple of fits when he wasn't tall enough to ride. We were amongst the first in the park, so there was a relatively short wait. About 5 minutes in, he looks up at me with big, sad, 4 year old eyes and says, ""Auntie Ha-d-ar, I have to go potty."" And sadly, my response was -- ""we are almost at the front of the line, can you hold it for a little bit?"" (forgive me, I am not a mom - and it was  poor judgement call) He couldn't and we took off running to the bathroom-- a lovely woman behind me offered to save the spot, but I was certain we would never find them again. In that short bathroom break, the line had quadrupled. Thankfully when we got back to the line, a cast member recognized me (one of the many perks of having red hair) pulled me aside immediately and sent us through the fast pass line where, ironically, we ended up 3 people behind the lady saving our spot in line."

I have never been to WDW, but I thought the way you described your experience at Disneyland was awesome and I hope you (and others, especially first-timers and/or tourists) always feel the warmth and community."
Disneyland,384590,drexthedestroyer,27,Mon Jun 1 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I've been to Disney World once, and I felt like everything was so disconnected compared to the Disneyland Resort. Of course, there's far more variety with four different parks to visit, and even the individual resorts have a lot of character themselves, so there are advantages. But Disneyland will always be the more charming of the two places."
Disneyland,384590,dodgepodge,6,Mon Jun 1 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think its that there's a lot more filler stuff in Disney World, since its gigantic.  At Disneyland you get all the marquee attractions, pretty much stacked on top of each other.  Its perfect if you're being a crazy person and only flying in for a day to visit, like me.  And I'm sure its just as good for people who only want to pop in for a few hours.  Its nice to be able to pop over to California Adventure, do the single rider line for Screamin', hit it twice and head back to Disneyland proper, all within 30 minutes.  If you're at WDW and want to ride Expedition Everest, but not stick around to visit the zoo, you're probably going to kill 2 hours doing it and getting back to the Magic Kingdom."
Disneyland,384590,Boloh,2,Tue Jun 2 05:10:25 2015 UTC,I think the most charming thing about Disneyland vs Disney World is the land lets characters roam free (ish) as opposed to strict times and places. The added guest interaction is nice.

I was able to walk onto the Jungle Cruise, Pirates and Haunted Mansion during Fantasmic, and still get to see good chunks of it walking by.  Had my flight not gotten delayed 3 hours and kept me from getting there at 9am like I had planned, I would have definitely carved out time for Fantasmic or World of Color."

Disneyland,386hfv,ranoutofbacon,9,Tue Jun 2 17:45:37 2015 UTC,"It's the level of demand coupled with the short time frame. If you go even a week later, the lowest level room is $350. In fact, right now there are NO rooms available for the weekend OP wants. OP has managed to pick probably the busiest weekend this month, as well as trying to book it less than 2 weeks out. The level of demand will escalate the price. Never mind that the $1665 is not going to be the crappiest room they have. In fact, that price is more than likely applied to the highest level room in that tier."
Disneyland,386hfv,stormeegedon,10,Tue Jun 2 21:28:16 2015 UTC,There are a lot of great offsite hotels in walking distance of the parks. Some are even closer than paradise pier.
Disneyland,386hfv,4123956,9,Tue Jun 2 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"Since you're less than 2 weeks out, that's kind of bound to happen. Especially since that's the week/week after most kids graduate and get out of school for the summer. Can you imagine how many people are staying onsite for their graduation gift/trip?  But I echo the sentiment to stay off site. It's only 1 night, and you wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel anyway."
Disneyland,386hfv,stormeegedon,5,Tue Jun 2 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're gonna book for so soon in the future and during one of the busiest times of year, it's gonna break the bank. My sister booked far in advance for fall two year ago and got a room for I think 300-400 a night. It was also the smallest type of room though."
Disneyland,386hfv,CatManhattan,8,Tue Jun 2 18:18:57 2015 UTC,As a seasoned traveler...courtesy of my SO who used to be a tour manager of a comedy duo....do NOT take what they post online as what they have to offer.  CALL the Hotel...yes CALL the hotel directly...and ask them what rooms they have available.  MOST of the time you will get a much different price than you see online.  Also ask them if they have discounts for AAA or any other membership.  I think you might be surprised at the difference in prices.
Disneyland,386hfv,drkatherine1,9,Wed Jun 3 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"Hello! Used to work at the Paradise Pier Hotel. At least for Disneyland hotels, you'll really want to call Reservations.

The rate you're being shown looks like a Premium View 2 bedroom suite or one of the Signature suites + concierge services. So literally one of the most premium rooms in the hotel. The Pier is full almost all the time due to the lower prices + lower amount of rooms as compared to the other 2 Disneyland hotels, and they were basically always oversold on weekends. Whatever rooms were left over were, inevitably, the signature suites and Paradise Suites which is the quote it seems you got."
Disneyland,386hfv,lego606,3,Wed Jun 3 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"My mom and I are looking at staying at the Grand Californian for Fourth of July if she is retired in time. The cost of that stay would send me to WDW for nearly a week.   I go frequently and never say onsite any more, I so rarely spend time in the hotel room, and I have free parking, so it's not worth it.  Only considering it this trip because I can't be in the parks all day if it's hot and crowded, one or the other, so we'll actually get a chance to enjoy the hotel."

It is walking distance and in my opinion it is closer than Paradise Pier. Also they have valet parking or self parking, both are a standard fee of 15 a day, whichever one you choose. It was about 230 a night. When I was booking I compare it with the Disney Hotels and it was at least 1,000 cheaper. Also I booked the Disney themed room(up-charge) and park view (another Up-charge). Good Luck. Hope you have a great time."

I always give several guest compliments and I know that they (supposedly) factor into promotions and things, but giving a physical thank you card feels nice too. Like, ""Disneyland is my home and the only place I actually feel comfortable in my own skin, y'all make it happen. Here have a small piece of cardstock, I promise its worth wayyy less than $15."""

I didn't know about this, as I am new to the Disneyland thing--and wish I had given two compliments last time I was there.

And that tree would be run by a hidden cast member who could actually talk to and answer guests questions.

But I don't think Star Wars or even Marvel need to have their own lands. Dedicated rides, sure, we already have Star Tours. Star Wars & Marvel are just franchises that Disney acquired. I'm scared that these franchises are going to be shoved in our faces like Frozen has been."
Disneyland,386t1e,Capt_Triskal,3,Tue Jun 2 16:43:50 2015 UTC,"I've never seen Disneyland as a place where there should be full Lands dedicated to a particular media property. Think about it, Main Street, Fantasyland, New Orleans Square, Adventureland, they're all topical, rather than branded, lands that are and continue to be timeless.   I know they're bucking that trend in DCA, and in some ways I'm kinda okay with that. But, while Cars Land is cool I guess, I would have much rather it be more generalized like Route 66 land or something. Obvious ties to the Cars movies, of course, but way more could be done with that.   tl;dr I totally agree with you. No Star Wars land. (Coming from a huge Star Wars fan.)"

Disneyland,386t1e,EagleEyeInTheSky,3,Tue Jun 2 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but there's logistics issues with putting parking structures across the street from the main resort, and most parking lots right now are overflow lots.

It may be a touch non Disney of me, but I love going on with first timers who don't know what to expect. I'd never wish for anyone's day to be ruined by getting wetter than they are prepared for, but it's damn good people watching and generally everyone has a great time."

Disneyland,3853xq,Techsupportvictim,8,Tue Jun 9 23:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's really nice to not have to worry about anyone else. Going on your own gives you that freedom to just blast in on whatever you want, like you did. Cars Ride 3 times in a row? Do it? Wanna get soaked on Splash Mountain 10 ten times? No one can stop you. It's beautiful :)"

Disneyland,3853xq,fontizmo,8,Tue Jun 2 00:06:28 2015 UTC,"Wait, Matterhorn now accommodates single riders? I should not be surprised due to the new seating configuration, but this is awesome!   Where do you join the single rider line?"
Disneyland,3853xq,hoosh,5,Tue Jun 2 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"You enter where the line splits between both sides. You ask the attendant for a ticket and then you can pick your side and they have a separate turnstile for single riders, marked by green tape on the floor."
Disneyland,3853xq,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Tue Jun 2 05:58:17 2015 UTC,"it's always had single rider for as long as i've had a pass, which has been over 3+ years now."

Disneyland,3853xq,readyfuels,11,Tue Jun 2 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"Not too much of a story, I stumbled upon the single rider line for the Matterhorn, and the bobsleds stop right in front of the waiting area for a safety check.  So right in front of me was a bobsled with a woman, a kid and a guy who looked suspiciously like Nicolas Cage.  Then they were off and everyone in line was murmuring about whether or not it was Cage.  Cut to a few hours later and I'm doing a marathon on Screamin'  I get off, go right back through the single rider entrance and almost run smack dab into a guy who is definitely Nicolas Cage.  I asked an attendant and they of course gave me a shrug, which confirmed it.  So he and his son rode like three times in a row, and on the final time, I got put on the same train.  Then we all got off an exited together, he was really hustling to get away, so I didn't want to bug him for a photo, but I did snap a picture of the ride photo he was in  http://imgur.com/mdzRHuS"

Disneyland,3853xq,misteeq,3,Tue Jun 2 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"Ha, the wife an I opt for single rider for Cars. Sometimes we get lucky and they let both of us on. We don't mine riding separately and it allows us to pack more into the day. Just wish they had single riders for Space Mt."
Disneyland,3853xq,impactblue5,2,Tue Jun 2 19:31:18 2015 UTC,I love single riders! My friend and I got on Matterhorn in 15 minuets during the 24 hour event! We went right when the park opened but the standby line was already 2 ish hours long. We didn't get to go on the same vehicle but she was on the one right behind me so I call it a win!
Disneyland,3853xq,TotoTheBunny,2,Tue Jun 2 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"Single rider lines are amazing until a school group of 30 comes into the queue...and then they see their friends who got into the regular queue get on the attraction before they do and get grumpy.  But beyond that, THEY ARE AMAZING IF YOU GO BY YOURSELF!"
Disneyland,386hh9,gamermommie,3,Tue Jun 2 04:55:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm a Disneyland CM and this applies to Disneyland CMs -- it might be different for you, but this is what I know about.  Our Disney ID allows for infinite self-admission to Disneyland. A Main Entrance Pass (silver or gold) will allow guests in -- so long as we have not already been in the park that day. It's stupid, but I think it has something to do with the computers.  If we get into the park already for a day, we can't use our Main Entrance Passes to let anyone else in. However, if we enter at the same time as our guests, we can allow ourselves and 3 others to get in.  This is different at WDW, where we count as one of our 3. But at Disneyland, we can allow ourselves and 3 others in, so long as we have not gotten into the park already."
Disneyland,386hh9,EnglishMobster,3,Tue Jun 2 23:27:12 2015 UTC,Good news! We no longer count as one of our own 3 at WDW. You just have to pick up a 3rd Guest Pass
Disneyland,386hh9,MyDisneyExperience,2,Wed Jun 3 04:02:24 2015 UTC,I get that the guests have to come in at the same time. But what I'm wondering is if I can get my self and 3 guests in with my silver pass and then my husband can get him self in. So the total number of people is 5.
Disneyland,386hh9,EnglishMobster,2,Tue Jun 2 23:31:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'm not sure. I believe your pass is linked to his, but I'm not confident about that. It might be best that you call ticketing and ask them directly at (714) 781-4565."
Disneyland,386hh9,MyDisneyExperience,2,Wed Jun 3 00:38:41 2015 UTC,"That's what we had always thought, but this is what the paper it came with says. Last last line is what confused me."
Disneyland,386hh9,PeggyOlson225,3,Wed Jun 3 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm: - You don't work for Disney, but your spouse does -- Therefore you have a Spouse MEP (it should say Spouse Pass on the back)  If so: - You can self-admit yourself, and the actual Disney employee can self-admit on the same day. However, you self-admitting counts as a MEP usage and you wouldn't be able to sign guests in that day. The Disney employee's self-admission doesn't. - If you admit yourself + guests, the Disney employee can self-admit (since that's a separate perk) but will not be able to sign guests in - If the Disney employee signs guests in, you would not be able to self-admit  Hopefully that clears it up a bit!"
Disneyland,386hh9,music-box-love,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:01:53 2015 UTC,That is correct. My husband works for Disney.   So I guess I did read it correctly. Awesome. Thanks!   Edit: just after hitting send I thought of something. So does he use his silver pass to get in after I do? Or does his blue badge get him in?

I'll miss you Star Tours. But not the ""Am I gonna barf on my neighbor?"" game."

Disneyland,384fqj,zoewantsaspanking,7,Tue Jun 2 00:18:41 2015 UTC,i usually feel the same way- i've seen DCA's play parade several times in entirety just by walking around the park. but have you seen DL's new paint the night parade??? it's pretty mesmerizing and worth watching imo.
Disneyland,384fqj,mildly_interesting,7,Tue Jun 2 00:53:05 2015 UTC,"Same here. I'm gonna sit down once and watch all the shows, but not more than that. The only one that's an exception for me is Aladdin, mainly because it's almost a new show with Genie."

Disneyland,384fqj,dodgepodge,7,Mon Jun 1 22:28:28 2015 UTC,Is this a ride people love? I find that most people I talk to dislike it either because of claustrophobia or because it smells gross on warm days.
Disneyland,384fqj,Bijanadactyl,4,Mon Jun 1 23:42:53 2015 UTC,Being packed into a tin can full of sweaty people (at least ONE who forgot deodorant) on a hot summer day doesn't appeal to you?

I read on this subreddit somewhere that you can go in the exit and they have a special way you can experience the ride minus the claustrophobic sub? Idk, but I'm going to try it when I'm there in August, I'm hoping that's really a thing."
Disneyland,384fqj,YoeSafBridge,5,Tue Jun 2 08:36:46 2015 UTC,"I really liked this, and I don't remeber going on it before the submarines went Nemo.

Nevermind that she went on it a billion times at theworld with me eight or nine years before.

I probably wouldn't mind it as much if it wasn't there for a quarter of the year but 3-4 months is a long time for a classic ride to have an overlay.

Somehow I had it in my head that the overlay was  just a few decorations on the outside and some small references on the ride.  I didn't understand that the ride was almost completely different.  As the Haunted Mansion is normally my absolute favorite, I have to admit, I am a little heartbroken about the whole thing."

Disneyland,384fqj,fontizmo,2,Tue Jun 2 12:44:35 2015 UTC,I did phrase it wrong haha. The matterhorn is rougher but I meant it feels slower and such. Not as exhilarating of a coaster

Disneyland,380xu7,iSkelly87,13,Mon Jun 1 02:41:31 2015 UTC,"The Disney Difference:   Arrival with your school anytime during park hours A Grad Nite Ticket, granting you a full day's access to Disneyland® Park and Disney California Adventure® Park during normal operating park hours. Ticket entitlements and park hours are subject to change. A private Disney California Adventure® Park experience with dance parties from 10:00PM to 2:00AM. Grad Nite GOODNITE, an exclusive showing of World of Color just for Seniors. Enjoy Cars Land with your friends.   When I went back in 2008 my school, and a lot of others didn't show up until 10 PM, and we were only allowed to visit Disneyland, with the park staying open to us until 5 or 6 AM. It seems a lot has changed since then.   I'd expect large crowds, since I'm sure there are still plenty of schools that will show up during the day. Grad Night isn't just for So Cal schools, either. There can be students coming from as far away as Arizona. Also, a lot of them will be public school students, with classes that can be as large as an entire private school's entire student body. These days will likely be packed, especially as you approach closing hours.   Really, unless you absolutely MUST go, I would recommend avoiding these days. You'll be dealing with summer crowds as well, so it probably isn't the ideal time to visit the park. Disney will also likely close DCA early (around 6PM), so you won't get to see any of the fun nighttime stuff there."
Disneyland,380xu7,smokeyjoey8,5,Mon Jun 1 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely changed a lot since grad 2007 too lolll such a long time ago, but I can remember everything like yesterday..."
Disneyland,380xu7,gussiubao,2,Mon Jun 1 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think they close DCA early, They just stop letting people in without wristbands and slowly start pushing out the people without wristbands in the park. 2012-2013 is when they made the switch from Disneyland to DCA"
Disneyland,380xu7,VersaceTupperware,3,Mon Jun 1 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"DCA will remain open until 10 PM each night, with a single World of Color showing -- but otherwise you're spot-on.  I would avoid the thrill rides (Star Tours, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain) during the day. After the fireworks end, teenagers leave the park in droves and lines drop dramatically. I'd really push the 11 PM Paint the Night on Grad Nite days -- the park feels a lot emptier, and frequently the parade teams are dancing along to the music in our walkways (last night was one of those nights).  Star Tours was sitting at 10 minutes at 10:30 PM the other night, while Indy was hovering around 15-20. Star Tours was sitting at 45-60 minutes while teenagers were in the park, and Indy was pushing 80-90 minutes.  Keep in mind that it feels like Grad Nite kids are a bit more pushy when compared to ""normal"" guests. They tend to go wherever they want, even if it means breaking the rules. I had a ""train"" of 20 or so teenagers try jumping one of my ropes along the parade route after they shoved their way ""upstream,"" blatantly ignoring every CM telling them to stop.  I've also had them completely ignore me when I ask them to tug on their yellow straps at Star Tours, or even worse -- keep talking to their friends and pretending like I'm not there while I'm trying to talk to my cabin. I've heard worse things from my Jungle Cruise skipper friends -- there's a lot more heckling and booing going on when Grad Nite kids are in the park, and frequently kids will spend the entire trip talking amongst themselves and spoiling the trip for the other guests.  Now, don't get me wrong -- not all the teenagers are like this. In fact, I've met a solid number of perfectly well-behaved and even pleasant Grad Nite kids. But they tend to travel in packs and cause ruckus together, which means when they do misbehave you really do see it."

Disneyland,380xu7,almostsharona,5,Mon Jun 1 06:57:55 2015 UTC,"User above outlined the Grad Nite situation. My husband's school went a couple of weeks ago (so pre-summer crowds, but still), and it wasn't terribly crazy for this time of year.   Tips:  Hit DCA during the day. Grad Nite is held there, and from what my husband relayed after his school's trip a couple of weeks ago, schools require students be at Grad Nite when it officially starts in DCA. That would be a great time to be back in DL - just as the students are leaving in droves. That's a good time to hit up Big Thunder, Indiana Jones, Pirates, etc.  Make reservations for lunch and/or dinner in the parks on those days. The students won't be likely to spend Grad Nite and the day leading into it at the Blue Bayou, etc. Plus, you'll likely have ridden your ""must-rides"" by then, so you can keep it leisurely.   If you plan to see shows, try to do so during the Grad Nite days. Seniors in HS generally aren't looking to spend their trip chilling at ""Aladdin"" or even ""It's Tough to be a Bug.""  Get to DL early to snag a FastPass and hit up a couple of big rides.   Beware of teenagers playing ""Hey mister."" Some of my former (graduated) students confessed to doing this (quite successfully) on a band trip to DCA."

Disneyland,380xu7,SamuraiPandatron,2,Mon Jun 1 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Hit up DCA on the 3rd, then hit Disneyland on the 4th.

And the CMs actually don't like folks sitting on the curb in front of the benches because it tends to turn into sitting on the street cause it's not enough room when you consider that folks on the bench need a place for their feet.

The people who had been there since 2 told the CM that they weren't getting up and no one was going to come into ""their"" space. Me and my gf weren't looking to stand in front of those people but were hoping that once they decided to stand up, we would go to the very back of the crowd so we could get a space to see Paint The Night.

As much as I liked the new fireworks, I didn't enjoy them more than any of the other Disney fireworks shows.   Paint the Night was, by far, my favorite.  Definitely my favorite Disneyland parade that I have ever seen. We had the magic paint brush and ears, so it made it even more entertaining.  Cast Members and fellow parade viewers all had a blast painting each other and other people that passed by. What a fun way to pass the time while you wait for the parade to begin."
Disneyland,3840gg,Mathavian,3,Tue Jun 2 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"That's the problem with WoC:C. It's not bad... but with the original's soundtrack being so great, it is hard to wonder after watching the new one, ""Okay, that was fun... but when can I watch the real World of Color again?"""
Disneyland,384i7e,mrpiggywinkles52,9,Mon Jun 1 20:12:35 2015 UTC,WOW this was really detailed thanks! I really appreciate the time you took to type this. Yet again I am amazed by the efforts Disney cast members go through to help even a single guest!  Sadly the CMs in Paris where I normally go aren't this kind lol.

Disneyland,384i7e,kisuka,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:54:24 2015 UTC,I've honestly been WANTING an evac to happen to me on Space Mountain :< hasn't happened yet. I want dem lights on so bad. Only evac I've had in the 20+ years of going to Disneyland is Splash Mountain one time.
Disneyland,384i7e,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:45:28 2015 UTC,Sounds like there's a greater likelihood of a ride being paused cause some dipshit turned on his flash or pulled out a selfie stick than a major incident  Personally I'm philosophical about it. If it's my time it's my time. And I would sure as shit rather go out in a blaze of California Screamin' glory than the multiple of other things that could occur
Disneyland,384i7e,ThePaulAntonio,5,Wed Jun 3 09:25:18 2015 UTC,"There are so many safety protocols in place that crashes are more like once a decade more than anything. Most ""breakdowns"" are temporary! Usually it means that a vehicle on the ride activated a safety trigger or a guest was unruly on a ride and had to be escorted out.  I honestly wouldn't worry about it too much. And if a ride breaks down, and you are towards the front, they usually throw a fastpass your way! I'd say just go with the flow and don't be paranoid about it!"
Disneyland,384i7e,ThePaulAntonio,3,Fri Jun 5 19:27:51 2015 UTC,Are there any rides particularly prone to breaking down? And are there any you find scary when broken down ;)
Disneyland,384i7e,keti24,4,Mon Jun 1 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"Indiana Jones comes to mind as a major culprit. I have also seen Thunder Mountain broken down. The scary one would be California Screamin but other than its recent pre-60th streak, I have rarely seen it completely stopped. Scary? Not so much. Think of it as a chance to check out the detail the imagineers put into the ride! Guarantee you will see some new things if a ride stops!"
Disneyland,384i7e,heliattackpe,3,Mon Jun 1 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"Lol It's more certain rides seem like they'd be creepy to get stuck on if the lights went up, like the dark rides in fantasyland. Something about walking past those animatronics... not to mention I would be afraid to get on Space Mountain again if I ever saw it with the lights on."
Disneyland,384i7e,jaanaynay,2,Mon Jun 1 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"We got stopped on space mountain with the lights on, they ran us through the rest of the ride back to the station. It was actually pretty awesome and I really enjoyed it. Plus they let us stay on for another run. :)"
Disneyland,384i7e,jaanaynay,2,Mon Jun 1 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"Given California Screamin's track record, all in all it's one of the safest. Only about 3 incidents in about 14 years."
Disneyland,384i7e,Techsupportvictim,2,Tue Jun 2 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"I have an annual pass for Disneyland and every time I go the usual rides that break down are: Indian Jones, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Radiator Springs Racers."
Disneyland,384i7e,Jelisa08,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:47:39 2015 UTC,"Ah ok I see, what's your experience with those rides being broken down? I imagine Indiana Jones and Radiator Springs could be pretty creepy broken down? Along with Space. The others don't seem too bad."
Disneyland,384i7e,heliattackpe,2,Tue Jun 2 07:12:00 2015 UTC,"Usually, you're waiting in line when a ride breaks down. Since Indian Jones usually has technical difficulties you should wait till they fix it, I once waited in line for an hour and in that time the ride broke down 3 times, but it was always fixed right away."
Disneyland,384i7e,hereit_goes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:23:57 2015 UTC,Walked out cause he pulled out a selfie stick? Have to keep it down for an hour to make sure nothing was damaged?  That happened when I was there a couple of weeks ago
Disneyland,384i7e,heliattackpe,2,Tue Jun 2 07:36:04 2015 UTC,"We were just on Indiana Jones.  The ride broke down while we were on it, right before the boulder part with Indiana Jones hanging from a rose over us for about 10 minutes.  Because our ride was interrupted we were allowed to ride again right away while was nice."
Disneyland,384i7e,JalenJade,2,Fri Jun 5 19:28:59 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the vehicles of Indiana Jones are really complicated works of Imagineering. It's awesome when they work but there's a lot of hydraulics and engine components at work. Ever notice how bumpy the ride feels? It's purely the care being pushed up by hydraulics in different points of the carriage. The ground it's on is perfectly flat!
Disneyland,384i7e,rycar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"Was a passholder for 10+ years, only been evacuated from one ride in hundreds of trips. ""show stops"" as the CM said, are more common, and happened twice to me when I was there over the weekend, once for maybe 5 seconds on indiana jones, and once on pirates where we were hanging out for about 10 minutes before the ride got moving again"
Disneyland,381xqq,Albort,4,Mon Jun 1 07:02:15 2015 UTC,"I haven't found any concrete source but Disney is supposively shutting down toontown, circle d and a few other buildings.  what goes in that place im not sure.  anyone here about that?"
Disneyland,381xqq,ItsChadReddit,4,Mon Jun 1 09:03:22 2015 UTC,"I would assume something with Star Wars or a whole new land concept completely would be replacing it, but I haven't heard confirmation on either of those."
Disneyland,381xqq,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,3,Mon Jun 1 19:18:05 2015 UTC,"My question whenever the Toon Town to any other land rumor comes up is, what about the early closure? I've heard that it closes early due to fall out from fireworks. I can't imagine if it became Star Wars Land that it would be very popular with the older crowd that it shuts down so early.   Perhaps there's a work around, or the firework bit isn't true and it closes early because it's geared for kids, but I wonder."
Disneyland,381xqq,ZoruaUnited,4,Tue Jun 2 02:45:23 2015 UTC,"I really, really think Star Wars should replace Autopia, and be in Tomorrowland.   I hope Toontown gets revamped. Or maybe it could be Arendelle."
Disneyland,381xqq,fontizmo,17,Mon Jun 1 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm Arendelle could make sense... But I'm personally hoping for a full Fantasyland expansion like WDW. I want a Be Our Guest restaurant, dammit!!"
Disneyland,381xqq,ZoruaUnited,5,Tue Jun 2 00:09:37 2015 UTC,"YES.  We really do need that Fantasyland expansion. But, I don't want to lose the dark rides."
Disneyland,381xqq,centracing,2,Tue Jun 2 00:31:05 2015 UTC,Autopia is almost definitely being replaced at some point with the electric version from Hong Kong. The whole purpose of them building it over there was to test it for installation in the US parks. Also a California theme park with stinky and loud gas cars as the transportation of the future? Something's going to change that in the near future.
Disneyland,381xqq,ItsChadReddit,2,Tue Jun 2 05:34:27 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that's a good idea. I'm very much okay if it came down to the removal of Autopia + Innoventions show building. Star Wars could make much better use of that area.  As for Arendelle.. that's a good idea; however, the presence for even such a big franchise as Frozen may be a little too overwhelming IMHO. I've really got no idea as to how Disney could improve incorporating the franchise into the parks."
Disneyland,381xqq,ZoruaUnited,3,Tue Jun 2 00:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Autopia is just waiting to die. And, Innoventions isn't really something that people really want to see. Star Wars would fit perfectly there.   Maybe Arendelle could be in DCA?"
Disneyland,381xqq,ItsChadReddit,2,Tue Jun 2 00:32:57 2015 UTC,Where would it reside in DCA?
Disneyland,381xqq,ZoruaUnited,3,Tue Jun 2 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the Monsters Inc ride or around that area."
Disneyland,381xqq,ItsChadReddit,2,Tue Jun 2 01:28:06 2015 UTC,"I could care less about Muppetvision 3D (haven't been to the parks in a looooooooong time, not sure if it's been revamped/refurbished for something new?).  I'm a bit partial to Monster's Inc., but I would definitely opt to have that replaced in favor of Arendelle."
Disneyland,381xqq,ZoruaUnited,2,Tue Jun 2 02:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Muppets/Monsters area would be great for Arendelle.   But, it'd be an odd neighbor to the Animation Building."
Disneyland,381xqq,heliattackpe,2,Tue Jun 2 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"Can't remember the source, but it was stated Tomorrowland was going to get additional rides purely Star War related without taking any current rides away."
Disneyland,381xqq,disneywizard,2,Tue Jun 2 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I've heard too.   If we do get a new land, it will be like the New Fantasyland in WDW with other 90's films + Frozen."

Disneyland,381xqq,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Tue Jun 2 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"where did you hear this? I mean Toontown has been on the chopping block for a while now from what I hear but since I played the MMO as a kid I always wanted to see Toontown. I've been to Disneyland only twice and I was never able to make it round to that section of the park (my family didn't want to). Is there any particular reason for them to remove Toontown though other than to free up space, why not revamp it?  I'm going in August next year and I was hoping I'd get to see Toontown before it was destroyed. Hopefully it's still there by then. I've been to Paris a lot of times so I think I can speak for the ""Disney feel"" and I think Star Wars land wouldn't feel Disney in the same way Marvel land wouldn't. Both would be good add-ons for Tomorrowland. I'd love a revamped Toontown."
Disneyland,381xqq,dodgepodge,2,Mon Jun 1 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"Like /u/ItsChadReddit said, the rumor is Toon Town will make way for a Star Wars land."

Disneyland,381xqq,PicklePants84,5,Tue Jun 2 05:16:43 2015 UTC,I'm a day late but I heard a rumor last night while camping out at a bench for Paint the Night. One of the cast members who was pushing a glow mercy cart around stopped and talked to us. He said that the new rumor is that they are NOT going to do any holiday stuff this year in lieu of the 60th stuff. Apparently the usual Christmas decorations (specifically the garland going across Main Street) won't work with the Frozen Paint the Night float because it's too tall. I can't imagine Disney not doing their Christmas or Halloween stuff!
Disneyland,381xqq,fontizmo,2,Tue Jun 2 16:34:02 2015 UTC,Oh whoa... I didn't think about the garland when those floats came out. Even Belle would be too tall! Though I'm pretty sure they will still decorate the park in a holiday layover. There would be RIOTS if they didn't!
Disneyland,381xqq,EagleEyeInTheSky,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:18:25 2015 UTC,"I don't get why they would have to have no Christmas because of a couple strands of garland, or why the solution wouldn't also be solved by removing the Arrendale flat temporarily."
Disneyland,381rpa,Mattiebonez,3,Mon Jun 1 05:54:42 2015 UTC,I've been anxiously awaiting their sale too. I hear late June/early July for DL.   Why they have two different release dates confuses me.

Disneyland,37ztpo,JargonX,6,Sun May 31 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"If you're not keen on standing around for a long time, I walked up last minute and found a decent spot for PTN parade at Jolly Holiday, towards Coke Corner. Then after parade, squeeze onto Main Street near Gibson Girl.  If you're cool with waiting around for a good spot, chill on Main St curb for a good while before parade, then stand after parade and wait for fireworks."
Disneyland,37ztpo,cricketmcfly,4,Mon Jun 1 02:58:32 2015 UTC,I'm not sure for fireworks but i got front row for parade by the trash can near the entrance to snow whites wishing well. It was this tiny corner where no one was sitting.
Disneyland,37ztpo,Ferniekicksbutt,5,Mon Jun 1 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"i would sit on the right side of the street (if you're facing the castle). i was on the left toward the back for the fireworks and many of them went off to the left of the castle, which for me was blocked by a tree, so i would try and stick to the right side."
Disneyland,37ztpo,hereit_goes,5,Mon Jun 1 06:31:05 2015 UTC,We got a GREAT spot dead center in front of the castle just 45 minutes prior to the parade. The area wasn't at all crowded and we had a decent view of the floats (though we didn't quite see the street performers) and a spectacular view of the fireworks.
Disneyland,37ztpo,ooohchiiild,3,Mon Jun 1 09:07:00 2015 UTC,"Best off IMO in the middle of Main Street for both the parade and the fireworks. Main Street has projections on the buildings and while the castle has projections as well, I was at the flagpole area on Sunday and could still make out what was being seen. I imagine even just the 150 feet to Main Street would add that much to the show."
Disneyland,37ztpo,jch708,3,Mon Jun 1 16:33:00 2015 UTC,"Small world. Wait, hear me out. The parade goes past Small World area, that's one. Secondly the Small World building becomes a display during the Fireworks. You won't get the characters coming down from the Matterhorn, the wacky inflatable Sea anemones during the Under the Sea segment, or the special off castle fireworks, but you will get the whole show and understand what's going on since the middle of Small world is basically what happens on the Castle while the sides are Main Street. Reason I say this is because in order to get the whole effect of the special projections you have to find a spot somewhere on Main street that allows you to not only see the castle in full view but also the Main Street Buildings. .... But if you're willing to attempt a sit down and camp out, Coke corner and Jolly Holiday are viable options."
Disneyland,37ztpo,Ekkusu_x,2,Tue Jun 2 03:08:34 2015 UTC,"We sat in front of Plaza Inn and it was awesome. We had front row for the parade and then once that was over, everyone got pushed out into the street so we just stood up and had a great view of the castle and matterhorn for the fireworks. Next time we're going to do Main Street but my dad couldn't sit on the curb for as long as we were there waiting. Get there EARLY. We were there starting at 3:00. Some people left after Soundsational at 4:30 but most of the people stayed put."
Disneyland,381s0h,deviantpdx,5,Mon Jun 1 05:57:59 2015 UTC,"October is my favorite time to go mainly because of the low crowds. They don't shut down any of the water rides due to the season so you shouldn't have to worry about that. I believe that they change the water levels and/or spray jets and such when it's cooler out so that you don't get as soaked as you would on a 100 degree day. One thing to keep in mind however is that even though crowds may be lower, weekends and nights when Mickey's Halloween Party are being held will be busier. I generally like going Monday-Friday to avoid weekend crowds, but with that hours are typically reduced during the week when it is slower. This means the parks will close as early as 8pm some nights and there may not be fireworks etc those evenings. On nights where Mickey's Halloween Party is taking place Disneyland will close even earlier, at 6pm I believe, unless you purchase a separate ticket for the event. If you have a park hopper ticket and don't want to purchase a ticket to stay for the party you can still go next door to DCA. Since you're going pretty close to Halloween there may be multiple nights that week that they are having the Halloween parties."

Of course, the park filled up during the day, so it was more crowded in the evenings. But it was by far the least crowded I have ever seen Disneyland (usually I go in the summer)."
Disneyland,381s0h,macboogiewoogie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"I have been to Disneyland a few times in October, yes the temperatures are in the 80s during the day, however in the evening bring a hoodie.   The 2nd weekend in October is gay days, and it is CROWDED. Keep in mind that Disneyland closes on certain evenings for Mickey's Not-so-scary Halloween Party so that could effect your plans if you don't plan to attend.   Disneyland doesn't typically shut down water rides in October since the weather is still fairly nice, but if they do, they will be on the refurb calendar well in advance.   I understand that there is a ""winter"" setting for the water rides that causes less of a splash but I'm not positive if that's a thing or how it works/when it goes into effect."

When I attended Grad Night at Disneyland, the park was closed off for just the High School kids and their chaperones. We were there with other schools from about 7pm to 6am. They closed down Tomorrowland early to serve dinner to those that had paid for it and cleared the rest of the park while we ate. By the time we were done, it was only us, no normals. Mixing that many excited crazy teenagers with the general public seems like a recipe for disaster.  :/"
Disneyland,37v8gs,comixlover13,34,Sat May 30 18:15:25 2015 UTC,I think they've started letting the grads in earlier and then they get to stay after the park closes at its normal hours.

Disneyland,37v8gs,Thankful_Lez,5,Sat May 30 22:34:57 2015 UTC,"Me too.  I chaperoned last year as well, and was similarly disappointed in some grads.  I was lucky to be on a bus/responsible for students who were very respectful, as far as I can tell (I'm also a teacher known for being strict, so that helped), but to see kids I didn't know acting rudely or sticking trash anywhere but a trashcan was really upsetting.    The problem is, there's not much we can do if we don't know the kids.  Obviously, if we see a CM we can report them, but I doubt most of them would willingly tell us who they are (which wouldn't help anyway, as I have no idea how to contact another school) or go with us to see security.  Anyone have any ideas?  EDIT:  I want to clarify that most students did not behave this way.  It's a shame that those who did ruined it for others visiting the park, and even other grads, many of whom (especially at my Title I school) did save for this trip, which, despite being locals, may have been their first."

I do my fair share if cussing,  but not around kids.  These teenagers had no filter on them.  They were pushing,  shoving there way through sections where people were waiting for the parade.  I'm a Passholder also,  and like you feel bad for those that made Disneyland a vacation destination.  It was just awful."
Disneyland,37v8gs,epotosi,47,Sat May 30 18:16:55 2015 UTC,Please file a complaint with City Hall. That's the only way they'll know how these kids are behaving and that grad nights in this incarnation will hopefully end soon.
Disneyland,37v8gs,bahdumtsch,6,Sat May 30 19:10:22 2015 UTC,I never even thought of that!
Disneyland,37v8gs,joemama1333,8,Sat May 30 22:35:25 2015 UTC,I was there last night too and it was my worst Disney experience yet. Usually I have a great time but last night was miserable. I didn't have the problems others had with the lines but crowd control wasn't really working and it was basically a free for all for most of the night.
Disneyland,37v8gs,sweetlowdown,2,Sun May 31 05:56:18 2015 UTC,Find out what schools were there last night and call into their offices. Maybe it can help them prepare their students to behave better next year.
Disneyland,37v8gs,rebelbass1219,35,Sun May 31 17:01:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its on Disney for changing up the system.   They know what happens when you get a large group of teens together. They've done grad nights for decades. I know when I went (when it still happened after park hours), they had beefed up security and full body pat downs to prevent things from getting too out of hand. So its not like kids behaving badly should come as a surprise.  Even so, I'm confident that anyone who loves Disneyland enough to be on this sub-reddit has respect for the park and its guests. (I hope.) Not that you don't have a good point, just that you're preaching to the wrong crowd."
Disneyland,37v8gs,ejrizo,27,Sat May 30 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"This (City Hall and guests surveys) are (as far as us Cast Members know) key to making changes around the park for the paying guests. Everytime the survey CM's ask for your email address, give it to them and put your complaints in the ""additional comments"" section of the survey. Guests comments and attendance brought MadT back. Enough complaints and ""I'm going to take my vacation (and money) elsewhere"" could do the same in this situation. If they get enough of this then they would have to consider changes. These events are horrible for us working because we try to focus on the day guests. We'd rather focus on the day guests. But instead we have to clean up after the rowdy grads and try to spot shoplifters. The Cast is on the guest's side and I (and many other CM's) would not be mad if grad nites ceased to exist."
Disneyland,37v8gs,cricketmcfly,19,Sat May 30 20:14:28 2015 UTC,They really just need to go back to the old method of opening after hours just for grad night students.  Maybe close California adventure just for that purpose.
Disneyland,37v8gs,eiramjy,19,Sat May 30 20:45:57 2015 UTC,100% agree with OP. Grad nights have been hell this year for park visitors. These grad night kids are so effing rude and horrible. I feel horrible for ticket holding guests.
Disneyland,37v8gs,gussiubao,12,Sat May 30 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"My school's going to gradnite Wednesday night and I'm afraid of how everyone's going to act, honestly. I don't want my night or anyone's night to be ruined just because some of us can't behave properly at the happiest place on earth. So I apologize in advance for anyone who has to deal with rowdy teenagers in the next couple of days."

My wife is a teacher and about 100 kids go on a Disney trip each year. The difference is that her and the other teachers in charge don't let the trouble makers go on the trip. And if you are caught doing something stupid,  you have to hang out with the ""boring adults."""

We all just want to have fun!"
Disneyland,37v8gs,IrishLadd,11,Sun May 31 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"Awful. I hate ""line saving"" as it feels like the line never moves and you're constantly moving out of people's way as they ""find their group."" They don't allow it in Florida. They also don't do Grad Night anymore... So that's prob coming our way thanks you darn kids."
Disneyland,37v8gs,concretengrace,10,Sat May 30 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"Oye. Grad nites are definitely the worst nowadays since kids are literally at the park all day now too! (When I had grad nite, it was only after the park closed to the public) Anyway, I've been pushed, shoved, tripped, whacked, and worst of all, had glass broken on me countless times (I'm lucky...). They somehow always sneak in a glass bottle of Starbucks and because they're flailing/jumpin around the bottle falls out of their hand or backpack, seriously annoying. I got a cut on my foot the last time, I was so angry. So rowdy and rude.   I was in line for the Jungle Cruise and let me tell you, I'm not super skinny, and those line barriers are quite tight. So 3 male teens with huge backpacks decide to cut everyone to join their group in the front. They push, shove and whack everyone with their backpacks... I told them off and gave them the stankiest eye I could make. Pure rudeness.  I've also noticed big groups of middle schoolers that run thru the park too, with NO supervision either.   I've complained to DL city hall and to a few survey CMs (haven't received any surveys thru email yet)."
Disneyland,37v8gs,bubblesugarsocks,5,Sat May 30 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"One time me and my gf were at fright dome in Vegas and some kids were pushing thru to catch up to their friends. Well when they got to us they pushed her while saying excuse me, if they were nice about it I wouldn't of cared but they weren't so I immediately grabbed both rails and wouldn't let them pass. There was 3 of them and tried to intimidate me but I didn't back down because of how rude they were. They tried to jump over some rails and security caught them and kicked them to the back.  These kids are going to turn me in to a grumpy old man."
Disneyland,37v8gs,iblogalott,9,Sun May 31 11:30:06 2015 UTC,"We went this time last year. Thankfully we live close enough and can afford to go to Disneyland fairly regularly (about once a year), so I wasn't too put out. But my goodness, the rude and entitled attitude of the students there was mind boggling. Made me worried that I acted that way as a kid.  I feel like Disneyland needs to do what Florida did and just kill grad night. Also ""line saving"". That one thing alone makes me more mad than anything else. People wonder why lines move slow... It's because of line saving! If you can't be bothered to wait in line with your group you shouldn't be allowed to ride with your group."
Disneyland,37v8gs,golf4miami,8,Sat May 30 19:57:06 2015 UTC,"I went to Disnenyland for the first time ever in May for the Pixie Dust Challenge, which also coincided with Mother's Day that Sunday. Friday there was almost no crowds. Saturday was slightly more crowded since they reopened Haunted Mansion with the new ghost, and Sunday was fairly crowded, but not terrible at all. At least to me based on what I've experienced at Disney World.  We went to get a Fast Pass and this woman in front of us was berating the CM for how crowded it was in the park and how they came for Mother's Day and the crowds just ruined in and they were probably going to ride a few rides and just go home. I was really taken aback by her attitude.    I also had a bad experience at the expo where a woman thought I had cut her in line and was downright nasty to me and kept making snide comments about how rude I was.   My point being, there are lots of entitled people both CA and FL residents and not. I don't know how Disney can fix that. Overall, I'd say the CA people seemed much ruder to me than in FL."
Disneyland,37v8gs,bubblesugarsocks,19,Sun May 31 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"My sister and I were just talking about how there really needs to be a ""Bitchy Moms of Disneyland"" tumblr/twitter for some of the things entitled parents say in the parks. I'm ducking as I type this, but I will take rude teenagers over rude parents any day. Rude parents look down on younger people (even adults) because ""why are you in Disneyland, this park is for MY BABIES"", will cut you in line for characters or shows because how dare we want to see something so childish, bitch about ride closures and cancellations when they could have just researched their damn trip (""that we've been planning for months and now it's ruined !!!"") ahead of time.   Ahem. That is to say, I totally agree with you. And I have a lot of feelings."
Disneyland,37v8gs,epotosi,3,Sun May 31 02:13:51 2015 UTC,"The whole planning for months and years thing doesn't sway me, if I pay for a Premium Annual Pass every year, then I deserve just as much as they do."
Disneyland,37v8gs,concretengrace,9,Sun May 31 09:34:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, as a future Permium Annual Pass holder I'm going to have to disagree with you here. Having been on the other side of the coin where I planned for a year and spent double on one week-long trip than you did for your pass.   Disneyland isn't built on APs, it's built on those trips."
Disneyland,37v8gs,VersaceTupperware,3,Sun May 31 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"Well, that was my point (in part). I am not in highschool or college but I don't have kids, but I still deserve the same experience these parents do. Parents who are too freaking lazy to look up whether the park closes late or if the Matterhorn is being refurbed or if there's an event happening that will make the park crowded are the ones who annoy me. Or give me flack because I, too, would like to visit with the princesses and no, unless you give me a compelling reason, your daughter may not cut me in line just because ""I'm an adult"". Some parents are incredibly, incredibly rude and ignorant to those people around them, and I know ""because kids"" and ""haven't slept in years"" but other parents are super nice, so don't blame it on your kids.  However I disagree with you in part. I've had my AP for two years and it has saved me probably thousands of dollars in admission and food costs and parking. My five day park hopper that was my initial downpayment was over half the cost of my pass. The $17 alone per day for parking would slay me, that's sometimes more than I spend on food all day. This is me, alone. I can't imagine trying to do this with a family of five. Or adding hotels and planes into the mix. That's why the people who don't do any research for their ""one special family trip!!!"" are so damn frustrating to me."
Disneyland,37v8gs,ItsInTheVault,4,Sun May 31 16:51:22 2015 UTC,But... isn't it always crowded on Mother's Day?
Disneyland,37v8gs,whitestainedress,2,Sun May 31 05:23:08 2015 UTC,I'd assume so because it's a holiday and the Happiest Place on Earth.
Disneyland,37v8gs,TeelMcClanahanIII,4,Sun May 31 05:28:56 2015 UTC,Me and my GF are actually staying away from Disneyland on gradnight days. When we went to gradnight in 2013 we got mainly schools from out of state and the environment was actually quite nice.
Disneyland,37v8gs,JonH11,8,Sat May 30 23:48:18 2015 UTC,My family had a totally different experience when our trip overlapped with a Grad Night a few years ago. I noticed that the kids all seemed mature and respectful. Kids were taking pictures on their phones and talking but I didn't see any line cutting or anything crazy.   Someone in this thread asked why anyone would plan to go on a Grad Night...the only reason I knew is because I read it on a message board somewhere. I missed the detail though that the kids are let in early. I thought the kids were just let in at 9:00 when the park closed to the public.
Disneyland,37v8gs,Hyperminimalism,2,Sun May 31 03:47:34 2015 UTC,"My school had grad nite at disneyland, and none of my friends and I went. Our school buses would get us there at noon and we would stay there until around 4 AM. I thought it was really ridiculous that there would be 5 different schools (~300 seniors each) AND the normal crowd. Some of my classmates said they were only able to get on 4 rides in total due to the long lines, some of them stayed in California Adventure Park the whole day just because it was less crowded. Honestly, it's ridiculous that disneyland would subject their guests to grad nite crowds without even warning them. They should have some sort of announcement on their website or something to warn the customers that those nights are Grad Nite and to plan accordingly. I feel terrible for those families who didn't know.   My friends and I are planning our own grad nite on a day when we don't have to battle 5 schools worth of seniors along with the general crowd. It's just not worth it. By the way, I'd like to give a special shout out to disneyland cast members who work grad nites. You guys are the real MVPs."
Disneyland,37v8gs,epotosi,2,Sun May 31 04:43:52 2015 UTC,"My wife and I chaperone for a small AZ charter school's grad trip (which starts with Disney Grad Nite) every year, and while our kids have been reasonably well-behaved so far (they sign a contract which basically says that if they get in trouble for any reason they're off the trip—they're adults & must find their own way home), wow are some groups of students badly behaved. Most info ITT is dead-on, and once they're all locked into DCA after 10PM and it's just the grads the troublemakers just get worse. And with many rides shut down & the rest at partial capacity, lines are ridiculous; the same grads who wouldn't wait in that 70 minute line during the day are now faced with the 120+ minute waits and it's like watching a game of team leapfrog.  My only advice is to be the stern/polite voice of authority, and flag down a CM if/when you can. Most of these kids have already walked/graduated, but if they get kicked during the day they aren't getting into Grad Nite later, so there are still some stakes for them. If you're brave, and especially if they're wearing anything identifying their school, bluff being a chaperone (and if they don't behave, report their school to City Hall when you get a chance); so far, most kids (regardless of school) have treated us as though we were their own chaperones. If they question you not having the wrist band, say you'll put it on when DCA closes, or something.  Most of all, remember to treat them as you're asking to be treated—like another paying guest of the park, a human being deserving of respect. A lot of young people act disrespectfully because they don't feel respect from others/adults, and if they're coming up next to you in a long line, you'll probably have an hour or more to be a good influence on them!"
Disneyland,37v8gs,Hyperminimalism,3,Mon Jun 1 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"I did the whole Grad Night thing in 2011. For us the park was closed to the public at 10pm. We arrived and were patted down straight off the bus, that seemed to be ineffective due to the amount of alcohol and drugs. Actually walked in on a few dudes handing out what they said was ""X"" in the bathroom on Main St. Not sure if it was quite that out of control in recent years, needless to say it would be horrible to have my family/ small kids around that night. I've been a Premium AP holder since 2010 so I'm lucky to be able to got at any time. Just sucks that your trip was ruined because parents didn't raise there kids up better."
Disneyland,37v8gs,Hyperminimalism,3,Sun May 31 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"This should just be taught/drilled into their heads in general. Yes, Disneyland is fun. Yes, they're allowed to have fun, too, but it happens anywhere and everywhere, especially at Disneyland. I've never been to a grad night before and I never will given the horror stories I've heard.  Honestly, if you go anytime during when school is out, you have a chance of running into some loud-mouthed, self-entitled little buggers with no manners and no ability to understand that there are other people around them who paid good money for this."
Disneyland,37v8gs,Hyperminimalism,2,Sun May 31 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, I would hope their schools would find out if they misbehaved (put into Mousecatraz for example) on their trips, and not let them participate in additional graduation activities.  LIKE GRADUATION. I am pretty sure when I was in jr. high we had a grad ""day"" at a local theme park and if any of us were busted for acting up, they threatened to not let us walk in graduation."

Partly it's because of the fact that their brains aren't fully developed, and they can't appreciate--of their own accord without having to learn about it or find it out themselves through experience--that people shell out a shit ton of money to visit Disneyland and have a nice time. I'm not excusing them, but teenager's truly just don't understand the ways of the world and tend to lack common courtesy. Then again, so do many adults."

Disneyland,37v8gs,Ampage86,1 point,Sun May 31 05:24:56 2015 UTC,I was going to be on the resort for two days and one of them is during Grad Nite. Is it more bearable to be at DCA rather than DL for that night or is it just as terrible?

Disneyland,37v8gs,Techsupportvictim,15,Sat May 30 18:39:00 2015 UTC,Nowhere did OP say they didn't like crowds or kids. They said they didn't like the rude high school students who feel they are entitled to everything.

Disneyland,37wat8,BlueBayou,6,Mon Jun 1 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I don't think I've ever waited in line for Splash. You just gotta go late at night when nobody is willing to get wet."

Disneyland,37wat8,CletusTSJY,3,Sun May 31 15:08:09 2015 UTC,"Even so, Star Tours is only 4 1/2 minutes. You're waiting a little under 10 minutes of line time for 1 minute of ride. It would be interesting to work out the ratios for the other times, if someone has the ride lengths handy. I think Small World is the winner here, considering how long the ride is.  That being said, these are just guidelines. I know Star Tours' wait time ""lies"" all the time -- I'll frequently add 5 extra minutes onto the posted wait time, and then I'll tell guests 5 minutes more than that wait time so that they're pleasantly surprised. There is also times where we are critically understaffed and simply don't have anyone to spare to go change the wait times, so the wait time would be wrong for an hour or more."

They will likely not be offering them again. They only stopped offering them a few years ago so it'll probably be some time still before they begin doing anything that would require their removal or relocation."

Disneyland,37wagg,fontizmo,3,Sun May 31 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"Single rider is the best way!  The wife and I rode several times, each time as a single riders.   Was in line no more than 25 minutes, while the standby and fast pass lines were waiting an hour or more.  Was fun as some of the rides we raced against each other.    If you really want a Fast Pass, get there early on the day."
Disneyland,37wagg,valiamo,2,Sun May 31 17:00:10 2015 UTC,"Get there 30 minutes before the park opens. The main gate will be open but you'll be held back by a rope next to the Carthay Circle Theater. The majority of people waiting there will be heading to Radiator Springs Racers. Stay to the left of the group if you're getting a fastpass, or stay to the far right if you just want to get to the ride. On days with Early Entry for resort hotel guests, the standby line can reach 45 minutes or more by the time the park opens to the public. Hope this helps :)"
Disneyland,37wagg,jasonbamrad,2,Sun May 31 16:36:59 2015 UTC,The single rider line is usually alot shorter.   Your group might not be able to ride together but you don't waste so much time in line.

Disneyland,37vp7c,missheatherrose,2,Mon Jun 1 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"From what I read in another thread here on Grad Nite (and my experience chaperoning the last couple years), it sounds like your boyfriend's sister was misbehaving & got put into detention.

Disneyland,37vp7c,TeelMcClanahanIII,2,Mon Jun 1 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like that could be true but she's not really the misbehaving type (she's kind of reserved and shy). From what she told me the ESPN zone was after DCA and it was just another party/dance club experience to tired the kids out until the bus came.  Either way, she said it was pretty much like a punishment to her bc she's not very much into sports or socializing in public.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
Disneyland,37t4bx,MegamanDS,14,Sat May 30 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"What bugs me is that that when that film and BH6 came out, merch stayed only for some time before fading away yet with Frozen there's been an abundance of merch and it's not fair.   Yes, Frozen is one of it's highest grossing films ever but they're also forgetting that that same demographic that loves Frozen also adores Penelope from Wreck-It-Ralph and HoneyLemon from BH6. Their focus was briefly and hugely obsessed on Elsa and Anna but they still want HoneyLemon's purse or Penelope's cruiser or shirts or games and stuff.   And those little boys gushing over Marvel's actions figures (where there's no Black Widow stuff at all, but that's another issue altogether) want Ralph's giant hands or overalls or racing game for the Wii and X-Box.   It seems Disney keeps putting its eggs all in the Frozen basket but parents, teens, and the ""target"" demographic are wanting more than Frozen yet we're not being heard."
Disneyland,37t4bx,disneywizard,3,Sat May 30 22:25:02 2015 UTC,Don't forget that Disney also vastly underestimated Frozen's appeal at first as well and was caught with an insatiable demand they couldn't match at first. I'd say that Big Hero 6 and Wreck It Ralph were treated the same as Frozen was initially but the consumer demand wasn't as great so they didn't change the push the way they did with Frozen.
Disneyland,37t4bx,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:16:41 2015 UTC,That's true.   It's just I've noticed  a growing demand for BH6 and Wreck it Ralph merchandise from both adults and kids with Frozen Fever dying down.

Disneyland,37qm92,elisaur,5,Fri May 29 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"I was there during the pass holder showing of world of color. They gave everyone hats and it was the most epic thing ever. Since then, the show never lived up to that night. It was essentially ruined for me by being so awesome the first time. I'm down for this!"
Disneyland,37qm92,Shatteredreality,3,Fri May 29 20:22:23 2015 UTC,I would love this!

Disneyland,37qm92,rycar,1 point,Fri May 29 18:04:28 2015 UTC,I think they work off of infrared.  One of these days I'll get around to buying one and taking it apart.  I also want to build an amplifier for Astro Blasters.  I want to pull the trigger and hit all the targets at once.
Disneyland,37qm92,Mercury756,3,Sun May 31 05:45:56 2015 UTC,When is the meet up?
Disneyland,37qm92,sparklyshizzle,4,Fri May 29 22:44:11 2015 UTC,I think they'd sell a lot more if they weren't so expensive. The wand is almost $25 after tax! I know the ears aren't cheap either. Why create the technology then make it cost so much? You'd think they'd want more people participating.
Disneyland,37qm92,DDotJ,4,Fri May 29 17:21:34 2015 UTC,I agree. From what I've read the technology is lost when only a few people are participating. I do theatre lighting for a living and the technology Disney has across it's parks blow my mind.
Disneyland,37qm92,mildly_interesting,0,Fri May 29 19:00:49 2015 UTC,I'm very interested in lighting tech. Can you elaborate?
Disneyland,37qm92,sparklyshizzle,3,Sat May 30 05:24:40 2015 UTC,"Woah, really? When I bought the want it was $8 after tax. I did get it when it first came out though..."
Disneyland,37qm92,sparklyshizzle,3,Fri May 29 17:39:09 2015 UTC,Yeah on Wednesday I saw them at the Emporium for $23.14.
Disneyland,37qm92,Photoelasticity,2,Fri May 29 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"The paint brush not wand, sorry."
Disneyland,37qm92,cwall-e,2,Fri May 29 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"I watched videos of people wearing the hats, and it being this really beautiful display. I only travel to the parks every few years, so I was excited to purchase the hats for our entire family.   The night before our first day in the parks, I spent over 100 dollars for hats and a wand in Downtown Disney. First night in the parks, and we were the only group with hats.. We felt like we were being too distracting and possibly ruining other peoples experience, and turned them off.   I still wonder if I can return those hats, even though it's been a couple months. Maybe I'll try to sell them on Craigslist."
Disneyland,37qm92,TennyoAkana,2,Fri May 29 22:56:13 2015 UTC,I'd be there with ears on.

There comes a point where Disney's part in managing your son's disability ends. When I bring my daughter (cerebral palsy) and three niblings (one autistic, one blind, and one in a wheelchair) we have no complaints about the system. I think it's more than fair, and we go on far more rides when we have a DAS card than we otherwise would have.

Disneyland,37v6me,LuniLady,-1,Sun May 31 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"Quite trying to use this so called ""Autism"" as a fastpass. More than likely any kid hates waiting in line along with most adults, but sorry it's just a fact of life when going to a public area, especially Disney parks. Not wanting to wait in line is not a ""disability"". You don't get special privilege because your kid can't wait in line because of ""Autism"". And a special disability food line? Really?  I'm glad Disney is finally cutting back on the abuse. Everyone is trying to claim they have a disability now and it's out of hand. Learn to properly use the fastpass system like everyone else."
Disneyland,37v6me,TotoTheBunny,1 point,Sun May 31 02:27:30 2015 UTC,"It is a disability. When you have a kid unable to control themselves and they keep repeating ""Have to wait! Have to wait!"" louder and louder because they have limited expressive language ability. It then progresses into random headbanging and throwing of objects."

Disneyland,37rwhj,Jonnybgudz,6,Fri May 29 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"Nightmare Before Christmas is a must since you're going in October when the Haunted Mansion will be overlaid.   I'd second Cars too, it's not one of my favorite movies but Cars Land is spectacular and I keep meaning to rewatch it because I know I'll appreciate it even more.   Bug's Life maybe? I don't spend much time in the land, although I like the show they have.   And I'm gonna throw in Tangled, just because that part of the Mickey and the Magical Map show is my favorite.   Now I want to go watch some Disney movies!"
Disneyland,37rwhj,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,1 point,Sun May 31 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"Also, I believe the town in Tangled was designed to look like fantasy land :) (Don't quote me on this, it's just what I've heard)"
Disneyland,37rwhj,MomoPeacheZ,5,Mon Jun 8 11:04:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on the ages of everyone, I'd say.  But you should (re)watch Cars to appreciate the magnificent Cars Land.  If you're going in October, I'd recommend The Nightmare Before Christmas because the (must-see) overlay on the Haunted Mansion will be in effect."

Disneyland,37rwhj,SuperC142,2,Sun May 31 01:33:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with that!  :-)  Actually, I was asking more for the other way around (any kids that are too young).  Pirates might be another good one to watch (at least the first one) because, while it's based on the ride, the ride is now based on the movie.  Nemo is a good one too; it's a nice E-Ticket ride.  Plus, you have the added bonus of Finding Dory coming soon."

They don't charge you for reservations, but I do think there is a small window where you can cancel without being penalized. I had the thick pork chop there, it was decent. The food is good for the most part, but it is fine dining price and portions. $100 is about enough for two entrees and a starter."
Disneyland,37qrl7,Chewbaccas_Bowcaster,3,Fri May 29 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Did you make reservations for World of Color dining? If so, expect to pay around $120. You can cancel up to two days in advance without losing your deposit. I'd say it's too late for you. The house biscuits are incredible. Get those to start in addition to any other apps you're interested in. For entrees, the thick-cut pork chop and the steak are usually pretty excellent. I generally find whatever ravioli dish they have to be insufficient portion-size wise."
Disneyland,37qrl7,dodgepodge,2,Fri May 29 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"Ditto to the pork chop and biscuits. Ask to sit in the main dining room, the side rooms tend to be full of kids and loud."
Disneyland,37qrl7,cwall-e,2,Sat May 30 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"They have regular biscuits and gluten free, correct? I had both and I remember one of them being more cheesey and delicious. Can't remember which one it was."
Disneyland,37qrl7,The_Tower_of_Terror,1 point,Sat May 30 20:30:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, I had the pork chop yesterday and wasn't crazy about what it came with. The blackberry sauce was too sweet and clashed with the potato salad served on the side. The New York steak, on the other hand, was awesome. It was dressed with a black bean chili that was simply delicious. This is the spring menu, to be clear. It'll change for summer."
Disneyland,37qrl7,dodgepodge,3,Sun May 31 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"I went last year and had a lovely time. We ordered 3 appetizers to share and all of them had really good flavors. The serving size on the entrées was a little small, but the service was a perfect combination of what I would expect at a nice restaurant while still being fun and light-hearted and Disney-ish.  I wasn't crazy about the desserts. If none of them sound amazing to you, maybe don't worry about skipping them and get a Mickey ice cream bar or a strawberry funnel cake later in the parks. I would recommend asking to be seated in the main dining room or on the terraces. There is a secondary dining room that is not nearly as nice, ambiance-wise.   Absolutely order the house biscuits with the apricot honey butter!"
Disneyland,37qrl7,ExpertShitSandwich,2,Fri May 29 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"It was fine in a 3-star sort of way. Food and service were perfectly acceptable, even good, but nothing to write home about.  It's not close between Carthay Circle and Napa Rose. Napa Rose, hands down."

Disneyland,37qrl7,staircar,2,Fri May 29 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Used to work there, helped open it in 2012 actually before I moved on. I can tell you the food is legit, the menu is done by Chef Andrew Sutton, who is the Executive Chef for Napa Rose and the new Club 33.   Everyone says to get the biscuits and they ARE the most popular by far, but I adore the ceviche and recommend that. I'm not sure what's on the entree list right now but I'm sure all of it is good. I recommend getting a cocktail or glass of wine with dinner. The servers usually know pairings and can help with that."

I was in complete awe the first time I saw it. Definitely make that your first stop to get a fastpass, its probably the most popular ride now and the line is pretty nuts all day long without a fastpass. Some updates have been made to classic rides like Matterhorn. I was just there last Sunday and it's a pretty cool, if not completely transformative update. Also a few new guests at the haunted mansion ;) The marvel stuff has unfortunately closed down, for now. They had a few cool exhibits with Iron Man suits and you could meet Captain America or Thor, they put it in the innoventions building but its closed now for something unknown Stars tours is different with alternating adventures each time you go, though I still prefer the original Finding nemo is now a part of the submarine voyage   That's all the major stuff that comes to mind right now"

Disneyland,37oxtc,TotoTheBunny,3,Sat May 30 16:31:11 2015 UTC,I don't think the difficulty was the problem. I think they just wanted to make it with cheaper material and sell it for more. I can't justify buying those ears for $25... =/

I'm up for it, if /u/mildly_interesting and the rest of the moderator team is. /u/mildly_interesting and I have discussed something along these lines before (mostly involving the photo contest), but I never followed up on it by messaging the rest of the moderation team.  I might have to drop my ""Cast Member"" flair, though, because this is an unofficial fansite sort of thing and if it does happen I don't want to give the impression if I'm ""speaking officially"" as a moderator that I'm speaking on behalf of Disney. It's one thing when I'm just making posts answering questions or telling stories, it's another thing entirely when my name is green and I have that ""Cast Member"" flair next to my name.  I can say I'll shoot off some modmail to the mods tonight. However, I don't want to make my relative visibility in the sub to influence their decision unduly. I'd honestly prefer what's best for the subreddit, and if there's another candidate that would fit better, I won't be hurt if someone else is chosen."

Disneyland,37q415,jax09,3,Fri May 29 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"As far as it looks, Muppet's is still closed for Frozen at the moment and for the near future. There hasn't been any new announcement on the permanency of the show yet. Hopefully we see the Muppet's come back eventually. Maybe with the premier of their new show this fall?"
Disneyland,37q415,ghost209,3,Fri May 29 21:53:37 2015 UTC,"From what I'm told, it looks like there was so much work done inside the theater that muppets coming back is not very likely. I would like to see it back there though, I absolutely love their facade. Much better than the WDW version."
Disneyland,37q415,warchiello,2,Fri May 29 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"Any work can be undone, its just whether or not they want to put the time into it. The muppets was never a very full attraction after the first year or two and any show I went to even in the middle of the summer was always maybe half full. I imagine the Frozen traffic must be much larger for it to not be removed."
Disneyland,37q415,ghost209,3,Fri May 29 23:06:55 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed that with the new Muppets show coming this fall on ABC that we get some presence in the park again but I think Frozen is drawing enough of a crowd that I don't think we'll be Sweetums walking through there again in the future.

Disneyland,37ontj,paradisevendors,7,Fri May 29 04:45:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing this great story. Next time you're at the park definitely go into City Hall and let them know about your experience with George if you haven't already. They'll write down what you say and make sure it gets to his supervisor.

One thing I know he does is he finds pennies on the ground, then he cleans them up and then finds a kid to give it to. Once he gives it to the kid he says ""everything in Disneyland has magic in it, even this penny"". He also has a giant world map at his house, and every time he talks to a guest and finds out where they are from. He pins the country or location on his map at home! Super awesome guy!"
Disneyland,37ozmw,CaffiendCA,14,Fri May 29 07:02:15 2015 UTC,"Told this one before.    We did the princess experience for my daughters.  My oldest, 4 at the time, had a lovely conversation with Belle.  She sang the ABC's, and asked her the usual questions.  About two hours later, we were walking past the princess area, and Belle was leaving to take a break or whatever, she called out to say hello to my daughter, by name.  After meeting maybe 100 kids. It was impressive!"
Disneyland,37ozmw,LookWhatDannyMade,24,Fri May 29 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"I shared this story once before, but it's still my favorite Disneyland memory. My family had traveled from Texas to visit family in California, including my aunt and godmother, who were with us that day. My godmother had heard about the daily ceremony at The Sword in the Stone, so she made sure to find out when it was, and steered us towards Fantasyland when it was time.  Merlin was accompanied by two trumpeters who played a fanfare as they cleared the area around the sword. He announced that King Arthur was out of the kingdom for the day, and that while the king was gone, it was Merlin's job to find his temporary replacement. And of course, to find Arthur's replacement, they had to be able to pull the sword from the stone!  Merlin chose two huge guys from the crowd to give them each a chance. The trumpeters played again, triumphant music that eventually turned into something like the sad horns from Price Is Right when the men couldn't budge the sword.  Then he said, ""Perhaps I've been going about this wrong. King Arthur was just a boy when he took the sword. Are there any boys who wish to try?"" I was kind of a shy kid, so I didn't raise my hand, but I found out later that my mom, aunt, and godmother were all behind me doing everything they could to draw Merlin's attention. ""You there! Would you like to try?"" I nodded yes, and walked forward. The shirt I was wearing was my soccer jersey, and had my name on the back. He said, ""What's your name, Danny?"" which made everybody laugh.  When I got up to try and pull the sword, the trumpets played and I pulled as hard as I could, with my feet on the anvil to brace me. Nothing happened, and eventually the trumpets died out. ""You know,"" said Merlin, ""I think that only King Arthur can actually remove the sword. Why don't you try again, and see if you can just make it move?"" The music began again, I pulled again, but this time I could feel it sliding up! I need to see if my mom still has that photo anyplace, because my eyes were as big as dinner plates.  About half of the sword came up before it stopped moving. I've heard it's held in place by electromagnets, but I've always wondered if there are some kind of hydraulics involved, because I very clearly remember that there were drops of water all down the length of the sword. It could have just been humidity or condensation, though.  Anyway, the trumpets blared again, and Merlin announced, ""Behold! Disneyland's king for the day! Hail King Danny!"" They put the crown and robe on me, handed me a scepter, and then placed the pin on my chest.  It said ""Fantasyland"" in gold letters, and has a picture of Arthur pulling the sword from the stone. Merlin paraded me around the plaza by the sword, and really played it up, telling men to take their hats off, saying that I could tax all of them a quarter if I wanted to... He was a really funny performer.  At the end of the ceremony, I had to return the crown, robe, and scepter, but got to keep the pin. I guess they used to tell Cast Members to keep their eyes open for that pin, because everywhere my family went in the park for the rest of the day, I would get greetings like, ""Hello, your majesty!"" or ""What an honor to have you aboard my ride, your highness!"" When we ate dinner at the Carnation Cafe that night, the waitress brought some special Mickey-shaped cookies out for me and my brother and sister, and said, ""Anything for the king!"""
Disneyland,37ozmw,citruselectro,7,Fri May 29 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"On wednesday, after watching the fireworks and parade, we went on Pirates as our last ride.  We got off the ride at 10:40pm and I realized that Fantasmic was going to start in 5 minutes and I haven't seen it before.  I said good bye to my friends and then went on a hunt for a spot to watch the show.  I asked a CM on the bridge in front of pirates where there was still a good spot. She was like ""Without a fastpass? no where."" I was bummed but then she asked me how many were in my party and I told her it was just me. She let me go under the rope and watch the show right there! I had an amazing view."

My  8 year old son played a few games and finally won a stuffed Mickey and was thrilled,  but he felt bad for his 5 year old sister in the stroller so tried another few games to win one for her.  Then I joined in to team up to win something for her.  We failed but the dude running it must have overheard because he called her over and let her pick out a small stuffed toy.  She was BEYOND thrilled.  Whoever that dude is,  they rock."

Disneyland,37ozmw,robbertofu,0,Fri May 29 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"I had my Grad Nite on June 6 or 7 last year. My school had a slow check-in process before we could board buses to Disneyland so we didn't arrive until 2-2:30ish. Lots of people already there, and tons of students mixed into crowds as well. I don't remember much of Disneyland, but in the time we had before going to California Adventure by 10, my few friends and I went on Pirates twice, Haunted Mansion, teacups, Astro Blasters, and Matterhorn. We got FP for Indiana Jones, but it broke down at our return time. Bummer. Also, on our second Pirates trip the students sitting in front of us were talking and yelling and STOOD UP during the drops. My friends and I were all a bit scared something would go wrong but thankfully nothing did.  As for California Adventure, we entered at about 9:50pm and walked through Condor Flats and Grizzly Peak to reach Paradise Pier. I hadn't been to CA in 11 years so everything was a little disorienting, especially at night. Grizzly Peak was a bit dimly lit as well. Once we reached Paradise Pier we saw  the regular World of Color finishing up but kept walking along the boardwalk. It was pretty neat to walk in the dark for a bit and see the boardwalk lights turn back on after WoC finished. We then got on Toy Story Mania for our first ride and wanted to go on more Pier rides but lines were obviously way too long to fit them in before 2am. So, we decided on Cars Land and walked there using the connection in Pacific Wharf and boy, that transition and seeing Radiator Springs creep into view at night was probably THE magical moment for me that night. We went on Junkyard Jamboree first and that was good fun, then waited in Radiator Springs Racers standby for 1.5-2hrs, can't remember exactly. After that we just walked around, or at least tried to, because navigating the park with the dance areas and tons of rowdy students was pretty tough. The Grad Nite WoC was aight. Not that great in my opinion.  But my Grad Nite story doesn't end there. After the show, everyone was herded back to the entrance and it took so damn long to waddle with a huge swath of students out of the park. Obviously everyone's tired and wants to get back on their buses quickly so people are rushing to get in line for trams but trams aren't coming to and from the parking lot quick enough. I remember waiting maybe 30 mins before Cast Members were telling everyone to walk back to our buses. My feet hurt so much by the time I got on the bus and we still had to wait for 1 or 2 people to check back in so we could leave. I don't think I got back home until 4am. So there's my Grad Nite story, and I hope to avoid as many Grad Nite days as possible in the future!  Edit: I also went on Silly Symphony Swings. I don't know if I enjoyed it or felt terrified of flying out of my swing the whole time. Guess I gotta ride it again sometime, heh."
Disneyland,37ozmw,crazy550,-2,Fri May 29 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"On memorial day, I was lucky enough to get fast pass for Space Mountain. I came back at the return time, handed my ticket over, went through the line and got on the ride. Once I heard the music ending, I made a very silly face for the picture. The flash always makes me temporarily go blind. When my eye's adjusted to the light, the light got even brighter! Already I knew something was up. All vehicles came to a stop and the message ""Your rockets have come to a stop, stay seated please"" went through the place. ""Do what you want, I already won."" I thought to myself. Our rocket stopped just before the little part where people get in and out so we had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to get a tiny ladder (They were letting others go before us). Now Disneyland seems to always follow a pattern when a ride breaks down. They apologize, give you the finger, then send you on your way but this time it was different. Even though I had already gone through the whole ride, they still gave me a fast pass to return!"
Disneyland,37pu5s,ItsChadReddit,6,Fri May 29 13:25:40 2015 UTC,"The taxes are included, so 779.  After the $100 DP, it's about 56/month"
Disneyland,37pu5s,collegemathchef,2,Fri May 29 14:58:29 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Disneyland,37pu5s,collegemathchef,2,Fri May 29 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"I ended up getting Deluxe because I planned on going 10 times in the year, and here was my breakdown:  10x$17 parking = $170  Extra 5% off food/merch = ~$25  $195 Since Premium costs over $200 more than Deluxe, I decided to go with Deluxe.  However, if you want to go on Saturdays/blackout days or plan on going more than 10 times in a year, then premium is almost certainly better for you."
Disneyland,37pu5s,dodgepodge,5,Fri May 29 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"This is some sound logic. To add on the Saturdays/blackout days, the most important blackout days that Premium passholders get to ignore are the ones around Christmas. Best time of the year to be in the parks, and it's nice to have no limitations when you can go then."
Disneyland,37pu5s,SmartestDumbTeen,3,Fri May 29 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, those blackout days are the ones which are always the most crowded in the parks. You got me on Christmas, but the two weeks leading up to Christmas are not worth 200 dollars to me I guess. Sorry if it just sounds like I am just trying to justify my purchase though haha."
Disneyland,37pu5s,dodgepodge,1 point,Fri May 29 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"Haha no worries. That one time, I was expected to go for different obligations: family, different friend groups, girlfriend, etc., so it's not a situation I expect everyone to find themselves in."
Disneyland,37pu5s,SmartestDumbTeen,1 point,Fri May 29 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"I just got my pass and have yet to activate it, but even when I was doing single day admission, it was like the exact opposite of that.

What I'm basically asking is does my passport expire one year after purchase or one year after my first visit?"

Disneyland,37n8js,dodgepodge,11,Thu May 28 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"This has been bandied about a few times in the past, but it makes sense in some ways. Some of the overseas parks already use demand-based pricing. Plus, if they were to only raise the rates on peak times right now, they could squeeze in another price hike without impacting everyone.  The part that threw me off was this...   In an online survey sent to annual pass holders, the Walt Disney Co.'s theme park operation sought opinions on a pricing schedule for daily tickets to the company's resorts in Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim.   Why would you ask an Annual Passholder these questions? Seemed off to me, like maybe this question was a hold-over from another survey and wasn't actual the meat of what Disney was looking for."
Disneyland,37n8js,stevensokulski,6,Thu May 28 23:19:10 2015 UTC,Maybe to get the opinion of someone who attends regularly? Plus your AP from DL doesn't do you any good for WDW and vice versa. And not all AP's renew and might go to a daily ticket instead?
Disneyland,37n8js,mlp1213,3,Thu May 28 23:38:20 2015 UTC,I am not an AP and last visit was October and I got the Anaheim Survey last Friday. So they either sent it to normal guests and APs or it was just a miss-type. More than likely they did a sample of each to see the different spread between the two.
Disneyland,37n8js,0oiiiiio0,3,Fri May 29 02:31:01 2015 UTC,"At first I wondered this myself, but then I realized that unless they started cherry picking ticket only guests at the parks, how could they do the survey? As a passholder, I routinely get surveys so my guess is that the passholder list is an instantly large pool of people who are likely to have a real opinion on such matters."
Disneyland,37n8js,ledfrog,2,Fri May 29 07:43:49 2015 UTC,"But they very much do cherry-pick people at the turnstiles, scanning their ticket before asking them for their email for a future survey or to step into a side room to take a survey right then."
Disneyland,37n8js,stevensokulski,2,Fri May 29 16:24:40 2015 UTC,But they also have roaming CMs that will ask if you would be willing to participate in email surveys. I wasxaksed to answer questions about food and beverages I had consumed during my stay and just got the pricing survey
Disneyland,37n8js,BarneyFyfe,2,Sat May 30 14:20:39 2015 UTC,Nice. So they captured your info as part of another survey and then asked if they could reach out later? Makes sense.
Disneyland,37n8js,stevensokulski,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:50:13 2015 UTC,Disney knows how to make money and  get people to love their brand
Disneyland,37n8js,BarneyFyfe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't sure if they did. I've never bought a ticket to be honest since I've always had a pass. I just figured it was easier for them to tap the over 1 million passholders rather than try and get a random sample from the park.  I do know they pick people at random when leaving and I've done my fair share of those surveys, but they are done on the spot and usually only deal with quality issues."
Disneyland,37n8js,ledfrog,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"I've had it happen both ways, with an AP almost always. Amazing how often I seem to get hit up by those surveyors."

Disneyland,37n8js,stevensokulski,4,Tue Jun 2 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think its because AP's are their best customers. If an AP isn't happy with the crowd problems at the park they'll lower their Pass type or just not renew, where as a tourist will come no matter how crowded it is."
Disneyland,37n8js,VersaceTupperware,10,Fri May 29 00:28:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In fact, AP passholders make up 1/3 of the yearly population that visits Disneyland. There are approx 1 million AP passholders.   Source: used to work for Disney."
Disneyland,37n8js,Jirachi_Wishmaker,2,Fri May 29 02:08:32 2015 UTC,That is absolutely crazy.. Wow
Disneyland,37n8js,VersaceTupperware,7,Fri May 29 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"it blew my mind when I heard that (from a CM for Disney Parks & Resorts). But Disneyland is really a special case; most of its visitors are in fact local, routine guests who aren't just visiting for a summer vacation. It's posed many dilemmas as well as unique opportunities; from trying to balance park congestion to creating attractions/interactive events geared towards frequent flyers."
Disneyland,37n8js,Jirachi_Wishmaker,0,Fri May 29 05:41:36 2015 UTC,"I believe it. If you're a family with a once in lifetime chance or even a once a year chance to visit a disney park, it makes much more sense to go to disney world instead of disney land."
Disneyland,37n8js,King_of_Tacos,1 point,Sat May 30 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"I concur. Also DW is just a huuuuuuuuuuuge global travel destination.

Disneyland,37n8js,Jirachi_Wishmaker,2,Sun May 31 03:11:04 2015 UTC,arent APs the first to get locked out of busy days with blackouts?
Disneyland,37n8js,wyolars,2,Fri May 29 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"not sure. I know for certain they never used to be able to go on weekends (sat specifically? but I heard that changed to sundays? Im not a passholder, I mooch off a Silver Pass). I think there are AP passes that are not subject to blackout, so that has to be taken into consideration. Even Silver Passes are subject to blackout, and rarely are they, so I imagine APs are not too frequently blacked out."
Disneyland,37n8js,Jirachi_Wishmaker,3,Fri May 29 05:32:45 2015 UTC,"In case you were wondering, here's the entire blackout calendar for Disneyland. https://disneyland.disney.go.com/passes/blockout-dates/?month=5"
Disneyland,37n8js,ledfrog,3,Fri May 29 07:45:51 2015 UTC,"I think perhaps they just sent it because they had contact information for those people. It's not like they can query any potential attendees en masse. They know these people will attend the park, and many of them will not renew, especially with price hikes to make that impossible."
Disneyland,37n8js,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Fri May 29 05:00:42 2015 UTC,"They could survey people but def not a lot, that's why they have those people at the exit of DCA with the iPads waiting to ask questions"
Disneyland,37n8js,VersaceTupperware,1 point,Fri May 29 05:03:28 2015 UTC,"And like 0oiiiiio0 said below, it sounds like they've sent it to other guests as well, not just APs. So maybe they are also using that information as well. I know on my last trip I agreed to take an online survey but it was exclusively about what attractions and shows I'd visited that day, I've never received any unsolicited surveys."
Disneyland,37n8js,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Fri May 29 05:09:25 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but it feels they are catering more to day guests with this move. AP renewal rates are already higher than they apparently want them, given the rate at which AP pricing has increased in the last 5 years."
Disneyland,37n8js,stevensokulski,3,Fri May 29 16:27:50 2015 UTC,I would think this would just end up leveling out though? Less people will come on high demand days and attempt to plan trips when prices are lower.the peek and slow times I'd imagine would just balance out population wise assuming the price was a big enough gap. The biggest question though is will the slow days be cheaper than they are now or are they just going to make the busy days obnoxiously over priced?    but idk.. maybe not *shrug
Disneyland,37n8js,u83rmensch,3,Fri May 29 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"That could very well be the goal. They probably want to even it out so that there aren't times when the park is dead. More people in the park means more money being spent.  Only thing is, the slow times are usually caused by a lack of ability to make it to the park (like due to children in school, working schedules, etc.) so I couldn't see the park filling up that much more during especially slow off-season days. The peak times of Christmas, 4th of July, and New Years are peak times due to the time off work/school. I'm sure there would be some equalization though, to a certain degree. Families may be more willing to take time off work/school if it means lower prices.  It's an interesting idea."
Disneyland,37n8js,blackseat,4,Fri May 29 02:52:25 2015 UTC,"They'd have to make it more than a $15 difference between the bottom and top price points for this to be effective. If I wasn't already a pass holder, I'd support this. If the gold prices were too high, it could help bring attendance down to manageable levels on normally busy days. And I would plan my vacations (if I was from out of town) around non peak times of the year to save money.   However, Disney currently uses much of their off peak times to bring down rides and close early, so I'm wondering if these downsides will remain as part of the trade off for getting in cheaper. If so, at least you'd feel better about a cheaper price if you went on a day when half the rides were closed."
Disneyland,37n8js,ledfrog,3,Fri May 29 07:51:22 2015 UTC,"Disgeek talked about the experience being a premium privilege. Kinda sad though, wish everyone could experience Disneyland, not all at once of course."
Disneyland,37n8js,ThePaulAntonio,3,Fri May 29 07:48:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the prices would have to be much more spread out.  It should honestly be less than $100 for an off-season day where tons of major attractions are closed.  Much like a Dodger game on a Monday/Tuesday when they are playing a terrible team.   There should be, maybe 5 tiers--all the way up to 24 hour days which should cost at least $150.  This would be akin to a Dodgers-Yankees matchup (interleague play) where upper deck tickets routinely sell for over $50 (normally under $10)  Tier 1: $80 Tier 2: $100 Tier 3:  $120 Tier 4:  $140 Special Days:  $160"
Disneyland,37n8js,collegemathchef,3,Fri May 29 15:17:57 2015 UTC,"This is a VERY unpopular opinion but getting rid of the monthly payments would drastically reduce the number of people with seasonal passes---I read over 1 million people have them. I'd love to know on a day to day basis what percentage of the crowd is AP members. I do know,  that Walt did want it to be a place for kids/teens/young adults to hang out. He was all about the repeat vistior.   I'd love to see some real stats on their park revenue, guests spending (AP vs non), people who lose money on their passes, etc. Of course, I bet not even CMs have access to this, but I'd love to know more."
Disneyland,37n8js,staircar,5,Fri May 29 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"The San Francisco Giants use ""dynamic pricing,"" which means that high-demand games (fireworks, popular giveaways, populer teams) have higher prices. This is why I have not been to a Giants-Dodgers game in years.  Dynamic/variable pricing is annoying when the Giants do it, but I can see the benefits of Disneyland doing it (mostly because I usually go during off-peak times anyway). However, I can also see how it would make things more complicated (e.g., if I go in off-peak season in the middle of the week, do I need a Bronze or Silver ticket? Would it include park hopping?)."
Disneyland,37n8js,TalithaRabboni,5,Fri May 29 00:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like this is pretty common. Hotels, theatres, and many other amusement parks will charge more during summer, holidays, weekends... it's what makes ""off-season"" off. My friends have complained to me that Disneyland should charge less when ""all the fun rides are down"", so even though this wouldn't really affect me as an AP (hopefully), I can get behind the logic."
Disneyland,37n8js,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Fri May 29 05:03:34 2015 UTC,For MLB games and other entertainment this does make a bit of sense. Sure if the Dodgers are in town and it's close to the playoffs they want to raise the price. But I feel like this won't deter people from Disneyland. A lot of people plan Disney trips around their vacation time and holidays. It doesn't really matter what the ticket price is once they get there. And locals usually have some kind of annual pass. This only really screws the families coming from out of town to enjoy the park.
Disneyland,37n8js,Rdubya44,2,Fri May 29 07:45:23 2015 UTC,You need to up your game when it comes to tickets. I used the game time app to pick up tickets to the Giants/Dodgers series this month for $17 a ticket in section 315. I could have had tickets in lower levels for under $50 if I wanted to spend the money.
Disneyland,37n8js,leftwinglovechild,2,Fri May 29 01:06:47 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I wonder if this would significantly impact premium annual pass prices

Disneyland,37oamv,kidkayden,1 point,Sat May 30 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"Oh boy!!!! I'm excited for you :D first plan out what rides you would like to go on. Almost every single ride has undergone some refurbishment/ remodel. Also plan out which shows you want to see. The big ones are Fantasmic, fireworks, soundsational parade, paint the night parade, World of color. Now what you have to make note of is during this time Disneyland from 8 and on basically converts to ""show-hours"" where everything is centered around the different shows being offered. Traffic will clutter up and people will begin waiting in certain areas. It's really important you choose what shows you want as it is rather difficult to move to another area of the park after this time. For example if you choose to watch the first fantasmic, the fireworks will begin right after so if you plan to watch those (which i recommend you do, it's a wonderful place to watch from new orleans square!) it would be better if you stay put. Paint the night you can watch anywhere from the path it travels but again make sure you choose carefully. This year's fireworks is centered around main street however I watched paint the night and fireworks from it's a small world and they have their own projections up. Make note that there are fastpasses for fantasmic. If you choose to watch world of color those also are basically mandatory fast passes unless you want pretty bad seats that you have to wait forever for. My best advice is to get there for the rope drop in the morning! They make it very special and all the rides have incredibly short wait times.  As for foods, a simple search for ""food"" here on this subreddit will provide many links such as this one http://www.thekitchenmagpie.com/your-disneyland-food-bucket-list/  where you can chose from all the different things disney offers :)  When you enter the park be sure to pick up a map AND the showtimes its a great guide for the day including character meet and greets, photos and much more!  Pretty much the trip is organized with this question, ""Do you have kids?"" If yes you might want to make a priority to making sure they visit attractions that will just make their day like most of fantasy land and participate in the Jedi training academy and all of that. One great option for daughters is to attend the princess fantasy fair! You want to make sure they have an unforgettable experience :)  Lastly I want to say take your time, please do. If you don't make it in time for a show or ride don't stress out. The last thing you want is to stress yourself and the rest of your party. Take things slow, soak up the environment and just have fun!"

Disneyland,37mrya,Pucca_banrion,8,Thu May 28 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"No calculator that I'm aware of but here are some guidelines I use:  Quickservice is usually $7-$11 for an entree (Corn dog with chips is about 8 bucks, clam chowder in bread bowl is about 10)  Table Service usually starts at around 17ish for entrees. This can go up a lot depending on which restaurant you are at (I'm mostly familiar with Cafe Orleans so you might be able to find some cheaper options that I'm not aware of).   Dining packages for shows start at 40 for lunch and go up to 65ish for dinner depending on the restaurant you go to (WoC Lunch at Carthay Circle is 40, Dinner is 60ish, Fantasmic at BB is 60-70).   Snacks/drinks are $3-$10 depending on what you want (Churros are 4, Dole Whip floats are 6 I think).   Bottled beverages start at $3 and go up depending on the drink and size (20oz Dasani water is about $3).   Hope this helps a bit"

Will you be eating breakfast in the park or will you have something in your hotel room to take care of that. Is she the kind of person that wants to snack all day at the park, or will you be bringing snacks to supplement the day?  It really depends on how you spend your money.

Disneyland,37k3mf,a___fib,11,Thu May 28 16:05:32 2015 UTC,"Quick confession time... A few years back an apartment complex I lived in somewhat misled me about my ability to bring a pet into my home. After learning that I couldn't have a pet in my building, I researched what it took to get a pet certified as a service animal in the state of California. What I learned was that it could be done with relative ease and that the doctor, in some cases, didn't even need to see the pet.  I ultimately decided against it, as it seemed like the wrong way to go about solving my problem. But it sounds like some others aren't being as thoughtful in their decision making process.  In an unrelated anecdote, I have come in contact with a few service animals in training at the parks. During one conversation with a trainer (on the train, of all places), she talked me through how Disneyland is sometimes used as an extreme, high-activity area to put trainees to the test. Once they've mastered Disneyland, their temperament is ready to go to work. Very cool!"
Disneyland,37k3mf,stevensokulski,7,Thu May 28 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"I was a puppy raiser for a  "" service dog in training"" I took her to the park numerous times-- sometimes I would let people pet her or have sleeping beauty take her for a walk around DCA. but other times she would be working-  (a little minion child kicked her when I told the child she was working and couldn't be pet. The mother could care less!!! she was so ignorant on what I was trying to do. I left crying- carrying my dog back to the car)  My service dog ended up failing for not liking children ( it was a program for  Disabled children)   A comfort animal needs no Intense training- just basic commands/ obedience.  it's illegal to ask for any type of proof for a service/comfort animal.  If a guest was asked if this was a working service animal- and they say yes- THAT IS ALL WE CAN DO! until it becomes an issue. Once the service dog is  ""on notice"" the animal will not be able to return.  ( a lady use to put her service dog inside a locker so she could ride attractions)  Working in guest relations and raising a service dog was the roughest time in my life. I cannot tell you how many "" fake"" service dogs I saw, how many untrained animals I saw panting uncontrollably in the heat. or just couldn't move anymore.  And the handler wanting special treatment because they had a dog.   A small  way to tell if they are a working service dog:  They will have bootys on their paws when it's too hot or too cold."

She's not trained to do anything special because literally her only job is to be there for my wife when she is needed (she is a Golden Retriever so she is just a bundle of love at all times :D).   Because she is not trained we make a point NOT to take her to places with large groups of people (honestly we don't take her anywhere non-service dogs are not allowed).   The only reason we even got the note from my wife's doctor was because (after the doc recommended it) our apartment required it for ADA purposes.   It really sucks to know that we have a an animal legitimately covered under the ADA for a real condition and then see the vast number of people who fake it when we are being responsible and not trying to abuse the system.

Other than that she looks totally normal and even fit.  She's got a disabled placard, which she mostly doesn't bother using.  But if she goes to Disney she HAS to use a wheelchair.  It sucks when she gets stinkeye unjustly, but it's a little understandable when SO MANY ASSHOLES really don't need wheelchairs and use them anyway."
Disneyland,37k3mf,robobreasts,8,Fri May 29 17:20:42 2015 UTC,I hate this because I am a pretty young looking 26 y/o female that is not horrendously overweight and outwardly looks relatively healthy and normal. However I have debilitating RA that has eaten away the joints in my feet and knees so I just can't walk well and standing for long periods of time is just out of the question. But I get these horribly nasty looks from people because obviously I don't look like everyone else in a wheelchair or a scooter so I must be faking it. The nasty quips and the confrontations over parking spots or because I don't move quick enough just makes me not want to go out and enjoy a nice day at the parks.   Edit: formatting wonky from mobile
Disneyland,37k3mf,intoxicnt,5,Thu May 28 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"Having degenerative and chronic issues, and looking like a ""normal"" woman, I almost felt like I should have worn a sign with my wheelchair in constant fear of being judged. I only used one at DCA because I wore myself out at DL. I'm currently trying to build up my endurance for another trip this fall. But it's really hard when people just assume-it's not fun to be in a wheelchair at these parks. You are stuck looking at butts and trying not to run over children....."
Disneyland,37k3mf,polyaphrodite,2,Fri May 29 00:58:12 2015 UTC,Some people can become obese enough to physically be disabled by obesity.
Disneyland,37k3mf,YAWKYAWKYAWKYAWK,10,Thu May 28 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"Just playing devil's advocate here, but I have personally interacted with a certified service dog for a wheel chair bound client of ours that basically fits the ill mannered description you have given. Poor woman used to have the greatest service dog in the world before he passed on, and got saddled with this hyperactive bundle of energy that's constantly jumping on people. So while I don't doubt that a lot of dogs acting this way are just people's pets with vests slapped on them, there are legitimate service dogs out there that act this way too, unfortunately."
Disneyland,37k3mf,stormeegedon,6,Thu May 28 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Second that (sort of). Have a friend who trains service dogs and she said that some people want to train service dogs because they like animals and want to help those in need of service animals. They train their dogs well, show professional praise for correct actions, and produce good and level service dogs.   However there are the people who train service dogs like pets with playful and overly emotional praise. She calls them ""servy doggies"" because the trainer still sees them as a cuddly pet versus a work animal. This usually leads to the less professional seeming dogs."
Disneyland,37k3mf,Reddit_Executive,2,Thu May 28 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"OMG ""servy doggies!"" That is amazing."
Disneyland,37k3mf,stormeegedon,3,Fri May 29 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of a time I was at the social security office getting my daughter's card, waiting with a woman that had an ill-behaved ""service"" dog. Jumping on chairs, bothering people. Then an actual trained service dog comes in. Calm, collected, dives directly under the chair that its owner/handler sat in. The picture of a dog at work.  All the while, ""service"" dog number one is barking and snapping viciously at the other dog. Security had to intervene. It was a debacle.  Edit- auto corrects and clarity."
Disneyland,37k3mf,RadicalPotato,4,Sun May 31 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"This isn't exclusive to Disneyland.  There isn't a lot of regulation regarding service dog designation, and it's starting to have an impact - at least in southern California.  My girlfriend and I are pretty active, and we go to a lot of places and do a lot of things, and I can't think of a single time we went to do something on a weekend where I didn't see a dog who clearly wasn't a service dog hanging out in a place where there shouldn't be dogs.  I've no issue with service dogs, but I'm bothered when I see a dog in the freaking Safari Park."
Disneyland,37k3mf,GrabMyDrumstick,5,Thu May 28 22:53:21 2015 UTC,"I manage a hotel. We have a no pet policy. Service dogs, by law, are allowed.  We do not allow comfort animals. People will try anything to convince us their dogs are service dogs. It is so frustrating and really makes it difficult for the people who do have trained service dogs."
Disneyland,37k3mf,Jekyllhyde,5,Fri May 29 00:15:25 2015 UTC,Legally if someone says it's a service animal that's it. They don't have to declare what the service is or show any kind of papers etc. you press the issue and you risk a lawsuit you will likely lose.   Yeah it sucks when folks are lying but with the current laws there's really nothing you can do
Disneyland,37k3mf,Techsupportvictim,2,Fri May 29 05:40:27 2015 UTC,"That is not entirely correct. They must state what specific task the animal is trained to do for them. If they can not answer that, or give an answer like ""he makes me feel better"" then the animal is considered a comfort animal. We have a copy of the exact wording of the laws available for all guests who arrive with an animal."
Disneyland,37k3mf,Jekyllhyde,5,Fri May 29 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"Do you have a copy of the text? I'd be interested to read that.   I used to manage a restaurant and ran into some issues once because an employee asked someone for their service dog's papers. Our corporate lawyers told us we can never ask that, even if the animal is not wearing anything that shows it's a service dog. We were told to let anyone in with any animal no matter what so long as they claimed it was a service animal."
Disneyland,37k3mf,silentcmh,1 point,Fri May 29 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, ill get it to you. And he's correct. You can t ask for papers and service dogs aren't required to be certified or registered anyway."
Disneyland,37k3mf,Jekyllhyde,2,Fri May 29 22:14:15 2015 UTC,You can ask. They don't have to volunteer. And you can't demand proof. So I can say that my pit bull is a seizure alert dog (he's not) and you have to accept that answer.
Disneyland,37k3mf,Techsupportvictim,0,Fri May 29 21:11:05 2015 UTC,True.
Disneyland,37k3mf,Jekyllhyde,2,Fri May 29 22:14:56 2015 UTC,You see this all over. Malls etc. the law says that you can't demand proof that a service animal is legit and folks know this so they lie to able to bring their pooch with them everywhere.   It's foul in my eyes. There are folks that need these animals for a variety of reasons and the liars cast a horrible pallor on the whole thing.
Disneyland,37k3mf,Techsupportvictim,2,Fri May 29 05:37:09 2015 UTC,"One time I ran into someone who claimed to have a service cat. Is there really such a thing? I'm deathly allergic to cats, and it didn't seem legit to me."
Disneyland,37k3mf,Chewbaccas_Bowcaster,1 point,Fri May 29 17:33:51 2015 UTC,I've seen small dogs in strollers within the park. Is that even allowed?
Disneyland,37k3mf,BunnyThumper,0,Tue Jun 2 00:23:19 2015 UTC,"I once saw someone with a dog the size of a toy/miniature poodle (don't remember what breed it was for sure). It was wearing a service vest, but the woman with the dog was carrying it. My suspicion is it wasn't a service dog."
Disneyland,37k3mf,agwood,8,Thu May 28 17:22:44 2015 UTC,Could have been a seizure alert dog
Disneyland,37k3mf,50shadesofgreyhat,9,Thu May 28 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"Service dogs come in all shapes and sizes. They can be emotional support or as someone else said, seizure alert."
Disneyland,37k3mf,foreverburning,9,Thu May 28 19:38:01 2015 UTC,emotional support dogs actually dont fall under the same laws as a service animal.  they are not allowed in public spaces like service animals.
Disneyland,37k3mf,PookeyBear13,1 point,Thu May 28 21:27:39 2015 UTC,yes they do.
Disneyland,37k3mf,darthjediLEX,0,Sat May 30 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that notion and which the laws were changed. Until they are I'm more than happy to go along with someone saying an emotional support dog is a service animal, so long as the animal is properly trained to handle being around folks."
Disneyland,37k3mf,Techsupportvictim,2,Fri May 29 05:38:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is possible. It was one if those little nervous dogs and it didn't look like it was doing well, but I could be wrong."

Disneyland,37nj8j,Pezto,3,Fri May 29 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"I've never had any issues with bringing them into the park. The cast members can clearly see them when they're checking my bag and none of them have yet to say anything to me.   I like buying a bunch and making bracelets and necklaces out of them whilst waiting for a nighttime show to start. It helps the time pass by quickly, and because they're so cheap, I usually have a lot left over to give to kids sitting around me."
Disneyland,37nj8j,not_some_throwaway,3,Fri May 29 01:25:20 2015 UTC,I've taken them a few times in the very clearly labeled package they come in.

Disneyland,37lyht,AnubisEight,3,Fri May 29 06:18:35 2015 UTC,"My dream video  ""Selfie sticks are a great way to help capture the fun and excitement of your trip to Disneyland. Now I'm going to demonstrate the proper way to use a selfie stick on rides.  [collapses stick and puts it away]  And there you go. Remember that rides have lots of low hanging mechanical parts and using a selfie stick can cause damage. Not to mention when your phone or camera is knocked off the stick and hits someone that person is liable to beat the every loving shit out of you and we won't stop them. Nor will we do jack if your phone or camera  is lost or damaged in the ride. But we will have to shut down the ride for as long as the remainder of the day to assess if your stupid selfie stick caused damage that could be a safety concern.  So remember boys and girls, don't be a dick. Put your fucking selfie stick away during rides. Thank you and enjoy your ride."""

Disneyland,37eo1e,GambleWithLife,19,Wed May 27 13:20:02 2015 UTC,"Yes!! A parent had mentioned it to us and how funny it was so we decided, why not...and it was awesome!  Our son was able to ask a question to crush and he was so thrilled that he got to talk to him.  Super cool..and totally agree that it is underrated."
Disneyland,37eo1e,kdupont,10,Wed May 27 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"I try to remember to see it once a trip, so fun because it's always different."
Disneyland,37eo1e,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,5,Wed May 27 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, we've seen it like a dozen times. A couple canned bits repeat (I won't spoil them) but I've never seen the same bit more than twice."
Disneyland,37eo1e,Tofinochris,10,Wed May 27 03:56:32 2015 UTC,"Always fun.  I got called out once for my beard - ""looks like some algae there, man""."
Disneyland,37eo1e,jlmarr1622,3,Wed May 27 03:10:18 2015 UTC,"My dad was called out on the ""small patch of moss"" on his head.  He doesn't have much hair left. I was laughing pretty hard at that one."
Disneyland,37eo1e,tdub2112,11,Wed May 27 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"CM here, happen to work with Crush, actually. My advice, if you want a great show, ask fun questions. There's the standards: ""what do turtles eat?"", ""what's your favorite color."" That kind of stuff, but get creative. Ask how Crush got his name, ask about his kids, ask about whales, or Dory, or ask for advice on a random subject. The best shows are the ones that have new questions. He won't answer obviously inappropriate questions, but anything new is fun for everyone."
Disneyland,37eo1e,FawkesFire13,2,Wed May 27 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"The best show I've had was when my wife got picked out by crush. She was wearing an avengers shirt that said Shawarma on it and Crush was comedically perfect with it, using it as a recurring gibberish gag throughout the show."
Disneyland,37eo1e,sentimentalpirate,2,Wed May 27 19:40:56 2015 UTC,Crush is pretty awesome. ;)
Disneyland,37eo1e,FawkesFire13,2,Wed May 27 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"Just curious, has anyone ever asked an inappropriate question? I've also wondered is there a different level of humor if there's an older crowd, like occasionally occurs on Jungle Cruise?"
Disneyland,37eo1e,KilgorePilgrim,2,Wed May 27 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"No, Crush will either end the show, or move to another person. It's a KIDS show. So we keep the humor light"
Disneyland,37eo1e,FawkesFire13,2,Wed May 27 22:57:11 2015 UTC,What's the best question you've heard asked? TT is hands down my favorite stop in DCA.
Disneyland,37eo1e,KilgorePilgrim,2,Wed May 27 23:22:40 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I enjoy when Crush talks about his kids.
Disneyland,37eo1e,FawkesFire13,5,Thu May 28 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"Wait, what? Where is this? I've been in the park dozens of times and never seen this."
Disneyland,37eo1e,gec44-9w,8,Wed May 27 02:39:28 2015 UTC,California Adventure in the animation building
Disneyland,37eo1e,ClockItClockIt,7,Wed May 27 02:44:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. I've avoided that area in favor of other more popular things. Perhaps I'll have to give it a look.
Disneyland,37eo1e,gec44-9w,16,Wed May 27 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"It's a must, the main lobby filled with screens playing clips of movies is simply amazing. I could sit in there for hours surrounded by all the different drawings."
Disneyland,37eo1e,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,15,Wed May 27 02:55:21 2015 UTC,But every 30 minutes they do That Up Montage and I have feels...   That area is so great. You don't mind waiting for Turtle Talk or drawing because of the great area.
Disneyland,37eo1e,Tofinochris,3,Wed May 27 03:55:02 2015 UTC,Good for hot days to get into a cool building too.
Disneyland,37eo1e,tdub2112,2,Wed May 27 16:19:55 2015 UTC,That lobby is an Oasis on a hot day.
Disneyland,37eo1e,zerostarhotel,1 point,Wed May 27 22:25:45 2015 UTC,same. but my family is so impatient...
Disneyland,37eo1e,newvictim,8,Wed May 27 05:06:46 2015 UTC,"I loved it the first time I went. Two years later I went again and was surprised that most of the jokes were the same. Also the guys playing Crush didn't seem quite as ""on"" as the first time I went.   But yeah it's an underrated attraction I agree!"
Disneyland,37eo1e,CletusTSJY,6,Wed May 27 04:44:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely! And if you're ever in Florida check out Monsters Inc. Laugh Floor, it's similarly awesome!"
Disneyland,37eo1e,echo_61,6,Wed May 27 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"Back when I had a mohawk, I raised my hand to ask Crush a question and he started yelling about how there was a shark in here and nobody had told him there would be! It was one of my favorite moments at DCA, ever.  Another time, someone asked Crush to name /all/ of his children, and he actually did it and threw in about 50 amazing references (all of the Beatles, Bill & Ted, Cheech & Chong, etc.) Given the right crowd this attraction has the potential to be an amazing time!"
Disneyland,37eo1e,joyasumi,7,Wed May 27 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"Crush gave my daughter, my husband, and me nicknames. All three of us. It was super personal and one of our favorite moments from our trip."
Disneyland,37eo1e,Halloweener58,2,Wed May 27 13:12:53 2015 UTC,I agree. My friend went and kept saying how great it was and my family wasn't disappointed!
Disneyland,37eo1e,emmerloo,4,Wed May 27 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"Went there last year during the 24-hour event.  The first time through, my daughter was so bummed that she didn't get to ask Crush her question, she actually cried (well, I mean...she was 3yo, but still).  Several hours later we went again, and got to talking to the CMs manning the line.  They heard that she didn't get to ask Crush her question, so they escorted us in through the exit, put us up front, and made sure Manny knew that Crush should call on her.    So, yeah, Turtle Talk itself is great; but it's the CMs running things that make it magical!"
Disneyland,37eo1e,MGJon,2,Wed May 27 14:31:12 2015 UTC,"It is great. One of my favorite experiences.  On our honeymoon, Crush chatted with my wife for a bit. On our last trip the past week, he chatted with our 3yo daughter. She had a great time. She was nervous and quiet, and her question was 'Pink'. They took it in stride and made it a True/False question and Crush talked about his favorite color. Gave her a cool nickname she liked using the rest of the day, and asked her the Buzz Lightyear question.  I enjoy it immensely. The whole animation area is a must see, especially with kids!"
Disneyland,37eo1e,ristatron,3,Wed May 27 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, it's a great place for a significant other + kid to burn time while the other parent is doing something else.  Usually my wife and the rest of the group will finish off magic hour in the middle of some ride (Radiator Springs, Toy Story Mania) so I'll continue exploring the park with my son (2 years old).  I believe the first show is 30 minutes after the park opens - if you hit up Turtle Talk then, you generally are there with only one or two other families.  It's always a fun personal experience because there's so few people that everyone gets a chance to interact with Crush."
Disneyland,37eo1e,Slansing,3,Wed May 27 06:07:52 2015 UTC,I honestly love this attraction. It's also a perfect place to rest your feet and get a little air conditioning.
Disneyland,37eo1e,acsmith,2,Wed May 27 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"Wait, what tech of how it works?"
Disneyland,37eo1e,Tofinochris,3,Wed May 27 03:55:30 2015 UTC,real time face control of a 3D character. It is not new tech. But still fun to watch.
Disneyland,37eo1e,newvictim,9,Wed May 27 05:08:03 2015 UTC,It's amazing. The guys doing the voice are right on as well. The first couple of times we saw it the guy was so good that we thought it was generating the voice and had no idea how it was doing all the names. That room really is some magic.
Disneyland,37eo1e,Tofinochris,2,Wed May 27 05:22:07 2015 UTC,I loved turtle talk!
Disneyland,37eo1e,newvictim,2,Wed May 27 05:04:13 2015 UTC,Duuuuude! I so agree!
Disneyland,37eo1e,oldtombombadil,2,Wed May 27 06:02:06 2015 UTC,"100% agree  As a CM, I recommend it to people all the time when I'm around Hollywood land."
Disneyland,37eo1e,sentimentalpirate,2,Wed May 27 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, I've always passed this by at Epcot, but I'm going to make time for it when I'm there at DCA in September. I was never even sure what it was, but it sounds hilarious!"
Disneyland,37eo1e,Vidogo,9,Wed May 27 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"This might be an unpopular statement, but I love watching Turtle Talk when my SO and I are high. It's the best."

Disneyland,37eo1e,DevinCreme,-2,Tue Jun 9 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"I like it but there's too much ""surfer lingo,"" makes me cringe.  Have Crush speak how he likes but the ""Dora the Explorer"" part where the kids have to repeat it is kind of embarrassing for me.  Better to have more questions, that's where it really shines."
Disneyland,37iccd,Angelfcuk,8,Wed May 27 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"I've had pretty good luck, sometimes as early as 10pm (off season, though). It's a perk when it happens, but I wouldn't necessarily count on it."

Disneyland,37iccd,SilverBell2449,2,Fri May 29 02:44:44 2015 UTC,Check what time the last movie ends at the theaters in DTD. Usually there is a grace period after that. I have been pretty lucky so far.
Disneyland,37hx7i,TotoTheBunny,4,Wed May 27 19:35:06 2015 UTC,Just saw them at the cart outside Haunted Mansion that sells all the Nightmare Before Christmas merch!

Disneyland,37hx7i,Pezto,1 point,Wed May 27 22:28:04 2015 UTC,Yep! They usually sell them outside of the mansion at a small cart. They are mostly only there during October-December Period for Halloween and Christmas. I know for sure that they sell them all year round at the Disney Store in Downtown Disney

Disneyland,37hf6f,leadhound,4,Wed May 27 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't come across mean, but it sounds like this person has made his mind up :l If you have to convince someone to try and go to the happiest place in the world, they may not have a great time anyway. But, just try to let them know the shows are brand new, fireworks, etc. Tell him you'll buy him a Disney hat? I mean, no one should  be convinced to go, you know? It's a no brainer! It's DISNEYLAND!!!!! :)"
Disneyland,37hf6f,stacasaurusrex,3,Wed May 27 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna agree with you.  While Disneyland is amazing, it's not for everyone.  You may try asking why he doesn't want to go, as there may be a specific reason.  You may do more harm than good if you push it."
Disneyland,37hf6f,shoptillyoudrop,3,Wed May 27 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"For someone who's had REALLY bad social anxiety in the past, I used to pick staying home over going out all of the time. Everything about being around people scared the shit out of me. Sometimes it got so bad that I couldn't even order food for myself. My boyfriend ordered for me while I hid behind the menu.  Maybe ask him one more time and if he says no, let him know he can join you guys should he change his mind then leave him alone."
Disneyland,37hf6f,TotoTheBunny,2,Wed May 27 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah me too. Even now, the idea of going to social events with my husband makes me want to crawl up into a ball and die. The crazy thing is now once I get there, I'm totally comfortable, it's just the anticipation"
Disneyland,37hf6f,staircar,3,Thu May 28 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"People who are quiet are often not good with large crowds. But they don't like talking about it   Truth be told you could come off like an asshole trying to convince him to come when he doesn't want to. If your issue is one last fun time, do something else. Why does it have to be Disneyland, why not a dinner out together or something smaller"
Disneyland,37hf6f,Techsupportvictim,2,Thu May 28 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe he is like me and deals with social anxiety. I have gotten way better but it use to be really bad I couldn't even go to a restaurant because I would freak out. Just a word of advice I would get bothered when people kept asking me to go and why not. I didn't want to say ""because it freaks me out okay"" I thought I was gonna get laughed at for having social anxiety. But what actually helped me out was pushing myself and going to places with close friends and family. I still get nervous and start to feel sick some times on a way to an event but after a while I just start to have fun and forget about it. But I would agree don't push it too hard because he might end up feeling worse. Definitely let him know that he is welcomed to join no matter when."

Disneyland,37ffn4,Shatteredreality,2,Wed May 27 14:39:24 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thanks!
Disneyland,37ffn4,not_some_throwaway,2,Wed May 27 18:26:04 2015 UTC,"Literally sitting in front of the castle right now, waiting for Disneyland Forever! We arrived at ~7:15 PM, and I think if we got here any later, we would have trouble finding a good spot."
Disneyland,37ffn4,DDotJ,2,Thu May 28 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"On Tuesday, people began sitting on the curb on Main Street around 4 hours before PTN. The spots started filling up quite fast shortly thereafter (at least on Main Street). I sat on the curb from 4:50 pm and ate dinner on the curb. If you plan to do so, bring a blanket or something to sit on. I forgot and my bottom went numb after about 2 hours."
Disneyland,37ffn4,paulamay,3,Thu May 28 06:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'd just prepare for the worst, since summer has basically started and it's the 60th anniversary. I saw plenty of people on Main Street line up for Soundsational and sit there until Paint The Night/Disney Forever over the weekend."
Disneyland,37ffn4,paulamay,2,Wed May 27 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we can't get there until 6ish but I think our plan is to immediately grab spots if we can. Thanks for the insight!"
Disneyland,37ffn4,Orange_Bird,2,Wed May 27 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"If you can't get a spot on Main Street, maybe try around Fantasyland? Either way, good luck!"

Disneyland,37f046,Ohtanks,3,Wed May 27 03:34:23 2015 UTC,Boyfriend and I did this on Sunday. Got fastpasses for the 10:15pm showing of WOC
Disneyland,37f046,mildly_interesting,1 point,Wed May 27 05:10:50 2015 UTC,Drat! I think weekdays only have one showing - at 9:30! :(
Disneyland,37f046,EnglishMobster,2,Wed May 27 05:41:34 2015 UTC,"Tuesday and Wednesday of this week will only have 1 World of Color showing, at 9:00 (due to Grad Nites). Every other day this week will have shows at 9:00 and 10:15.  It is certainly possible to see Fantasmic, World of Color, Paint the Night, and the fireworks all on the same day, but you have to get lucky with the Fastpasses:    Show Start End (approximate)    Fantasmic 9 PM 9:24 PM   Disneyland Forever 9:30 PM 9:46 PM   World of Color 10:15 PM 10:37 PM   Paint the Night 11 PM (varies based on viewing location) ~11:25 PM (varies based on parade speed)    Your major problem is going to be getting from New Orleans Square to Paradise Pier in under half an hour, given the heavy outflow of guests from the park trying to go home.  Seeing the 9:00 World of Color instead and rushing to Disneyland after would cause you to miss Fantasmic (the second Fantasmic showing conflicts with the last Paint the Night). If you're okay with that, you may be able to find a spot in Town Square -- or you could be ushered directly into the Guest Flow Corridors (more likely) and will miss the fireworks entirely. It's certainly a risk.  If you were willing to miss Fantasmic, this would be a safer option:    Show Start End (approximate)    Paint the Night (Town Square) 9:05 PM 9:27 PM (varies based on parade speed, given value is latest possible time)   Disneyland Forever 9:30 PM 9:46 PM   World of Color 10:15 PM 10:37 PM    Watching Paint the Night from Town Square would allow you to exit the park quickly and be in DCA in time to get an okay seat at World of Color. However, the first parade fills up quickly -- yesterday I had guests hanging out around 3-4 PM for the first parade.  E: Totally missed the ""tomorrow"" part. In that case, we're not having a 10:15 show tomorrow. :(  You'll likely have to shoot for the 9 PM World of Color show, then rush over for the fireworks. There's a chance that the cast members at Town Square will try to shove you up the Guest Flow Corridors instead -- when you enter the park and pass under the train station, try to go towards City Hall ASAP and it's less likely you'll be funneled into it. There's still a chance you'll be redirected and pushed into the Guest Flow Corridor, but I don't work in that area of the park (it's run by Adventureland and I'm in Tomorrowland) so I don't know how forceful they are with their push.  From there, I would find a spot along the parade route for the 11 PM Paint the Night, if you're up for it."
Disneyland,37f046,izookie,1 point,Wed May 27 07:24:16 2015 UTC,Thank you! I think we'll have to do that... Hopefully we don't get ushered. Thanks for the directions and tips! I'll look out for the route this morning so we can rush out from WoC and make it! Wish us luck :)
Disneyland,37f046,EnglishMobster,1 point,Wed May 27 14:52:32 2015 UTC,I just saw the 9:00 WoC on Monday and the fireworks were going off as we were walking towards the DCA exit. You realistically need to be lined up for WoC 1 hour ahead of time for a decent view.
Disneyland,37b4pn,knoewayhozay,4,Tue May 26 09:25:29 2015 UTC,Great shot. But two hours is nothing. I met some people who staked out some benches on Friday at 8 a.m. The fireworks were at 8:50 p.m.
Disneyland,37b4pn,dodgepodge,2,Wed May 27 02:49:24 2015 UTC,"This was on Monday, I did see people on Friday it was crazy! But they didn't allow people to sit in brick area between the street and the castle until about 6:30. We were just standing there until they put the ropes up."

Disneyland,37b4pn,NWSanta,1 point,Wed May 27 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"Great shot, but honestly with all the new projections it's even better from main street.  I was blown away tonight, did not expect the epicness.  Also, those WoC smoke additions! I won't spoil it for anyone."
Disneyland,37dm5b,Angelfcuk,13,Tue May 26 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"It's always open that late during the summer. It's usually open until 12am on weekends too.   There are schools already on summer break, and people will go and stay all night. I wouldn't anticipate it being less crowded later at night."

Disneyland,37dm5b,chotheamazing,3,Tue May 26 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"It's always open later during the summer months. However, one thing to note due to the fact that the new parades & firework shows are out - it will be a bit more crowded than before. We went last night for my birthday, and had to skip the 8:50 paint the night because we couldn't get a seat for it. We ended up waiting around, catching the fireworks at 9:30pm (got into the roped off areas around 9:15) and then rode a ride and came back for the 11pm Paint the Night with a prime spot.  Also - a lot of the attractions have just reopened after renovations (Haunted Mansion; Hatbox Ghost, Matterhorn was closed for a few months, etc.) so a lot of people are rushing back to give these a ride too + 60th anniversary events."
Disneyland,37dm5b,ClockItClockIt,2,Tue May 26 23:56:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Very useful!
Disneyland,37dm5b,badfishquart,2,Wed May 27 00:16:08 2015 UTC,Question: when did you get to the 8:50 show?
Disneyland,37dm5b,chotheamazing,2,Wed May 27 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"We were there yesterday too - and we planned to post up for over an hour for a seat for the parade. It - was - packed - dude. I asked a CM and they said that everyone pretty much stayed after Soundsational and had been posted up ever since. And this wasn't just on main street - it was throughout the ENTIRE parade route, people were already taking up all of the roped off sections. I couldn't believe how crazy it was! We abandoned the hopes of seeing the parade and opted for the Matterhorn wait instead, which was about 45 min. It was okay - great changes made to the ride, but we were on the left side so it wasn't as crazy. We will try again once all of the passes are blocked and it isn't grad night - that was another factor. Heads up that there is NO alcohol in the Mad Tea Party during grad night - major bummer we walked all the way over there. Soarin looks GREAT - though it's the exact same ride, I though there was going to be a new version. That whole area near soarin Grizzly Peak looks great too. All the changes are super exciting. End rant.  TL;DR - Be prepared to wait several hours for paint the night."
Disneyland,37dm5b,EnglishMobster,1 point,Wed May 27 14:31:16 2015 UTC,Rolled up around 8:15pm for the 8:50pm show and it was already packed. Looks like most people started camping out the streets around 7:50 or even a bit earlier..
Disneyland,37dm5b,mariepeach,3,Wed May 27 22:39:47 2015 UTC,"That's our summer hours. We'll be running them probably until about August or so, when the crowds die down slightly.  As for crowds, a lot of people will leave around 10:15 PM or so, after the fireworks. The park won't be empty, but it'll be a lot less crowded and a lot more bearable.  I would avoid the 8:50 Paint the Night and try to catch a spot for the fireworks by It's a Small World, then go on a ride or something and catch the 11 PM one. It'll be a lot easier on you and will allow you to see a bit more of the park. Yesterday, people were lining up around 3-4 PM for the 8:50 parade. Meanwhile, spots are usually still available at 10:55 PM for the 11 PM parade."
Disneyland,37dm5b,tj229er,2,Wed May 27 07:08:04 2015 UTC,Very useful! I was debating on which show times to catch.

Disneyland,37chxh,stevensokulski,11,Tue May 26 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly it might actually be a custom resolution. The whole film was transcribed to digital and I'm sure the movie studio in Burbank got the best detail they could out of it.  But you also have to think about how many projectors are used on that ride. Each projector might reach 4K individually, but each of them add up.  Resolution isn't even really an interesting stat anyway considering that the screen is round. It might not have a Cartesian aspect ratio.  I think a better question to ask would be what's the PPI of the new film? And no, I don't think Disney has released that info."
Disneyland,37chxh,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Wed May 27 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"I hadn't realized it was multiple lenses. I've never looked, and I'm not sure if it can be seen from the ground.

Disneyland,37chxh,EagleEyeInTheSky,3,Wed May 27 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"It can't be seen from the ground. The projectors are actually along the rim of the screen and project across it. If you're in row 1(the upper one), and you have longer legs like me, you can sometimes stick your legs out into the light and see your shadow to the left or right. That's the only way to actually figure out where some of the projectors are."

Disneyland,37chxh,MaLaCoiD,2,Thu May 28 02:12:31 2015 UTC,Though given that they needed at least 4 projectors (2 in CA and at least 2 in China) they very well could have gone for a custom build. Interesting!

Disneyland,37ajy5,omnomnam,43,Tue May 26 05:00:28 2015 UTC,My guess is that a change in tracks would take over a year like Big Thunder did. Not wanting to have too many construction walls up this Summer for the 60th was probably a factor. I also think that padding takes up precious inches. Inches that people need if they are tall-ish. I do miss the inappropriate seating arrangement of the old sleds. Oh to be 13 years old and going up that lift hill again...

Disneyland,37ajy5,fernker,3,Tue May 26 17:09:51 2015 UTC,I just ride it like any other rough roller coaster.  With my back not resting against the seat and in a defensive pose where I can try to lean into the turns.
Disneyland,37ajy5,_weed,0,Tue May 26 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"yeah, you just have to anticipate the turns and brace for them, which makes it more fun imo.   also it's the first roller coaster of its type in the world, making it comparable to a coaster built five decades later would probably be a difficult engineering task, especially given the unusual nature of the ride building/"
Disneyland,37ajy5,dodgepodge,14,Wed May 27 07:48:44 2015 UTC,"Why haven't they ever been fixed? The ride's been refurbished lord knows how many times, even to accommodate new bobsleds, and it almost seems bumpier now than it was before."
Disneyland,37ajy5,fontizmo,9,Tue May 26 05:14:57 2015 UTC,"Genuinely curious... Do you think it's historical value of the first tubular steel coaster has anything to do with it? Maybe they're preserving the track for some reason.   I can't really think of another reason they wouldn't make it smoother other than costing WAY too much money. I doubt it's a ""patch job"" and would require gutting the entire track."
Disneyland,37ajy5,ledfrog,26,Tue May 26 05:43:15 2015 UTC,"My guess is that there are some building codes they are grandfathered into. Completely changing a major portion of the ride might require them to update other aspects of the attraction in order to be up to code. This would probably cost a ton of money and force them to make significant changes to the ride that they do not want to make.   Like for example, what if Anaheim now has a policy about the height of buildings within city limits and the Matterhorn now exceeds this height. If they pulled the tracks out and started fresh that would be considered a major change and then they would have to address the new height rules. This may sound far fetched but there could be something like this keeping them from doing a massive refurb like that."
Disneyland,37ajy5,PBI325,4,Tue May 26 06:03:20 2015 UTC,"My guess is that there are some building codes they are grandfathered into.   This. So much this. Construction takes time and is literally NEVER finished on time. They're probably taking so long because they're hacking through red tape on Disney's side, Widing Turner's side, AND the city's side. And if Disney has PMs like they did on the last job I heard about the ride will never be finished haha"
Disneyland,37ajy5,disneywizard,3,Tue May 26 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"I would also like to add that not only that, but it took nearly a year for Disney to just update the outside of the mountain and change the ride vehicles during the 50th.  Adding on updating the track alongside the new Herold, inside special effects, and slight upkeeping on the outside and the Matterhorn would have been completed by the time the 60th ended.    It's also my unpopular opinion but I actually enjoy the current attraction. It adds another level of thrills and makes me actually feel we're on a runaway ride down a mountain plus I'm short and I can finally stretch my legs on the attraction and not be squished up into taller relatives."
Disneyland,37ajy5,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,3,Wed May 27 00:07:04 2015 UTC,Couldn't they just pad the seats themselves and make it a bumpy but comfy ride?
Disneyland,37ajy5,ledfrog,3,Tue May 26 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"I thought about that last night when I was on it and I have to agree with SylvesterMarcus below in that it will take a lot more than padding to fix this ride.  One thing to keep in mind is that when the Matterhorn was built, the track was designed for just one car rather that a train of two cars as it is today. I don't know the year when they made that change, but I'm certain that connecting two cars together has made the ride a lot worse than it probably was originally."
Disneyland,37ajy5,its0nLikeDonkeyKong,2,Tue May 26 15:33:16 2015 UTC,I believe you two! I do. But it couldn't hurt to at the very least hand you a pillow when you get on haha   Any things better than nothing!
Disneyland,37ajy5,SylvesterMarcus,2,Tue May 26 20:10:29 2015 UTC,I think it's going to take more than new pads to make that ride comfortable. My lower back aches just thinking about that ride.
Disneyland,37ajy5,sexualllama,2,Tue May 26 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"This makes total and complete sense. Do you think that in the distant, distant future the inability to update the ride in a large way will make it obsolete? Will it one day become a ride nobody even goes on because it's too painful/can't compete with the other rides in the area?"
Disneyland,37ajy5,ledfrog,3,Tue May 26 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Anything's possible. I went on it yesterday for the first time in a long time and I have to say, it wasn't really enjoyable.  As for the future, it's hard to say. I imagine there are soooo many factors that go into why Disneyland would update/renovate/change/remove/replace a ride that quite a few stars would have to align for something MAJOR to happen.  One thing I think would help with the ride mechanics would be to revert back to the single car format rather than the two cars trained together. I know they ultimately connected two single cars a long time ago to increase ridership, but to be honest, I'd rather wait in a longer ride and have a smoother ride!"
Disneyland,37ajy5,Ferniekicksbutt,3,Tue May 26 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: Anaheim does indeed have a height limit for buildings, which in turn makes the Tower of Terror the tallest building in Anaheim. However the ride needs more than that, so to make up for it a portion of the ride is below the ground."
Disneyland,37ajy5,ledfrog,3,Tue May 26 17:08:02 2015 UTC,I've also heard that Knott's Berry Farm's Supreme Scream is the tallest structure in all of Orange County. I wonder if Buena Park has any height limitations.
Disneyland,37ajy5,Shmebulock69,5,Tue May 26 18:17:54 2015 UTC,Possibly. I know Main Street Station cant get a wheelchair ramp installed because its a national landmark and they cant alter it.
Disneyland,37ajy5,calrdt12,4,Tue May 26 06:52:59 2015 UTC,"They can, so long as the historical significance of the building isn't altered. I think those modifications would just be extremely costly and not really that effective given the space limitations of the area.   They're not required to update it because of its status. I think their only option would be to add an elevator and extended ramp somewhere on the sides. It would definitely make the space look different."
Disneyland,37ajy5,uns0undl0gic,9,Tue May 26 15:45:25 2015 UTC,The cars haven't been changed since the last major refurb. This last closing was only to update effects and the Yeti bots.

Disneyland,37ajy5,tysons4,3,Tue May 26 10:33:43 2015 UTC,I  hear it's actually a  historical monument so any type of track refurbishment is out of the question.
Disneyland,37ajy5,Kastba,3,Tue May 26 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"Nope.  All the track on both sides was replaced over 10 years during the 90s.  The ride was routinely closed 3-5 months of the year then, usually from jan-may.  The ride was designed with a lot of help from Arrow, who are notorious for having very bumpy coasters, such as Viper at Magic Mountain and Demon at Great America."

Disneyland,37ajy5,fernker,2,Wed May 27 06:57:39 2015 UTC,If that were the case I don't think they could do any refurbishments on it.  I think Disney avoids historical monuments for that very reason.

The sleds we have now are all fairly new, and with the newer sleds being individual seating makes them longer than the original sleds designed for the ride. the longer sleds are a factor to the ride being rougher. the track itself can sadly never be preplaced the way Big Thunder was. replacing the track would mean tearing down and rebuilding the mountain. with more up to date building codes the mountain size would have to double. so sadly it will always be a rough ride. but as a consolation we did add an extra quarter inch of padding in the last reamp. hope this helps clear the air a little."

I went to DCA to get WoC FP for 3a and snagged a Soarin' FP. I then went to wait at the Esplanade for DL to open. The line for DL was all the way back to DCA's gates and after waiting 20 minutes and getting to the center of the Esplanade I heard a security CM say that the line was for re-entry only.  I walked down to the monorail, and it was hotel guests only. I spent the rest of the time in DCA, pining for DL. I did Soarin, single-rider'd RSR, FP'd ToT, saw Aladdin, watched Turtle Talk, and avoided the very-packed T-Party. I left at 11p, after it was looking like there was no way I'd see the 1a Paint the Night. I felt bad that I wasn't having a good time because I expected to be let into DL.

We enjoy our time in California Adventures, biding our time til we could hit up Disneyland again--1 am rolls around and we think, it should be open by now. Go outside and are told ""Disneyland is not allowing anyone in."" Well surely they'll let us downgrade our 1-Day-Park-Hopper ticket for a 1-Day 1-Park ticket; wait in the ticket line for an hour, 2 am--get told ""You have used your 1-Day-Park-Hopper ticket, there's nothing we can do."" Ain't that a kick in the head."
Disneyland,37aupo,champion_dave,11,Tue May 26 19:45:17 2015 UTC,What were you expecting? Sounds like it's your fault for making a lot of assumptions on the busiest day of the decade.
Disneyland,37aupo,MaLaCoiD,1 point,Tue May 26 22:50:20 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear of your un-Disney journey. Did you ask if you'd be allowed back when you left at 10a?
Disneyland,37aupo,jairya,2,Fri May 29 06:56:13 2015 UTC,"No I did not, I used to have an annual pass and had never experienced such crowds (this was the first time I had heard of Disney 24 hours and decided to go) so the thought did not occur to me. My mistake for not knowing. We did ask multiple times throughout the day though, if that counts, and every time the answer was ""they are at capacity."" Live and learn."
Disneyland,37aupo,TrulyGoofy,10,Fri May 29 14:04:31 2015 UTC,"It really grinds my gears when someone called it ""California AdventureS"""
Disneyland,37aupo,cricketmcfly,6,Tue May 26 21:28:14 2015 UTC,Or Auto-topia
Disneyland,37aupo,OrangeFeels,3,Wed May 27 02:46:06 2015 UTC,"Or when they call it Disneyland when they're going to Florida, or DisneyWorld as 1 word when they are going to Disneyland. That's just me though."

Disneyland,37aupo,disneywizard,6,Wed May 27 16:19:20 2015 UTC,"Even though I hate the thought of this, I think Disneyland will soon have to start limiting access into the parks and not keep filling it during peak seasons to overcapacity because it's not sustainable to do over time. We also know that one of the main reasons various rides in the parks are breaking down so frequently is because they're pushing them to their limits (think taking a minivan, filling it with 12 people, and doing several hours drive on low fuel and low tire pressure)."
Disneyland,37aupo,BobertMcGee,14,Tue May 26 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"Rides don't really work harder when there are more people in the park. Whether the line is 5 minutes or 120 minutes, Space Mountain is still expected to cycle trains all day long. I think overall uptime has a much greater impact on ride health."
Disneyland,37aupo,centracing,2,Tue May 26 17:14:50 2015 UTC,Definitely. And Disney keeps strict maintenance schedules also. It may be hard to convince management to shut the ride down for a week to do a major preventative maintenance repair though. That's probably where most of the problems arise from.
Disneyland,37aupo,centracing,1 point,Wed May 27 06:54:43 2015 UTC,"Ya true, and also Indy's ride vehicles can be taken out of service for maitenence. I'm assuming they have spare vehicles.  Also if they're working on a cabin then it needs to be individually locked out by whoever is working on it, not just a sign on a control panel"
Disneyland,37aupo,joshery1,6,Wed May 27 07:47:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, they've already tried to curb this by continually raising ticket prices/annual pass prices over the last decade.   Somehow adding a third park would help - or expanding. Thinking... they don't really use the parking garage to full capacity do they, and they still have a bit of land that's just single level parking."
Disneyland,37aupo,disneywizard,7,Thu May 28 03:02:07 2015 UTC,I keep hearing rumours they're planning on buying and turning Angels Stadium and the area around it into another park. Thoughts on that?
Disneyland,37aupo,joshery1,5,Tue May 26 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"Well, not being local and not being partial to the Angels I think that's an awesome idea! I've been to Disneyland 10+ years making the drive from Idaho - never been to Florida. My understanding is that Disneyworld is much the same just bigger for more capacity (also additional parks like Typhoon Lagoon Water Park). I.e. not 100% sure but I believe I read a ride like Tower of Terror in Disneyworld has 4 shafts vs. the 2 in DCA."
Disneyland,37aupo,EnglishMobster,3,Tue May 26 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"The rumor mill is swirling around, but Disney really needs more parking than anything else at this point. A third gate would just bring more people into the park and intensify the overcrowding issue.  The only real way I can see a third gate happening is if Disney somehow gets the Gardenwalk and Angel Stadium. Angel Stadium can park approximately the same number of cars as the parking garage does.  With the Gardenwalk in hand, theoretically a third gate could run from the Pumbaa parking lot to the Toy Story parking lot (essentially stretching across Harbor from the Tower of Terror to a little bit past the convention center). Disney would own all of that land, but they would need to come to an agreement with Anaheim about how to handle Katella (and Disney Way) cutting through the property."
Disneyland,37aupo,collegemathchef,2,Tue May 26 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"By limiting access do you mean putting more blackout dates on the APs?  But yeah, I do agree.  And if they add STAR WARS themed stuff, good god will the crowds increase.  Disneyland could honestly double in size and still fill the park in the peak seasons"

Disneyland,37aupo,mildly_interesting,6,Tue May 26 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"The 60th kick off kinda lost its magic for me. They revealed the medallion a day early, and released the merchandise a few days early. It was a prekick off to the kick off and when the 22nd came I felt like the only new thing they had to present was the shows.  Also, with July 17th being a Friday, I don't see why they couldn't have done 24 hour day/kick off on the actually anniversary instead. I know they wanted to keep it the same as WDW's but there wasn't really a dying reason to have it on Memorial Day weekend."
Disneyland,37aupo,bubblesugarsocks,3,Wed May 27 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"Even the shows were unveiled early! Even if you didn't score admission to the media premieres, WOC:C had a soft open the day before the 24 hour day! It would have made sense to do a 24 Hour Day proper and then have a 60th Kickoff on the actual birthday in July. Even still, I got to go to both premieres and they were amazing, so the 24 Hour day was basically just us hitting all the shortest lines and laughing at the people camping out."
Disneyland,37aupo,BobertMcGee,3,Tue May 26 17:14:43 2015 UTC,They began selling 60th merch and drawing people in with the 60th anniversary promotions almost two months before the actual birthday. They can make A LOT of money in two months. Why would they wait to begin raking it in?
Disneyland,37aupo,collegemathchef,1 point,Tue May 26 19:31:41 2015 UTC,"Where will Star Wars land be?  Toontown, or in other space in the park."
Disneyland,37aupo,Hyro0o0,3,Tue May 26 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"If they do it, it's expected to take over either Toontown or Innoventions. Unless they turn Angels Stadium or one of the parking lots or something into its own Star Wars park."
Disneyland,37aupo,disneywizard,3,Tue May 26 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Disney is dropping the Star Wars themed land - they will add more Star Wars themed rides to the park following the new films but not an entire land to the park - but ToonTown is still in the rumor mill of being replaced with a new land.   What that new land will be, we don't know.  Most probably there will be attractions for Frozen there but otherwise no one knows what it's going to be."
Disneyland,37aupo,ZoruaUnited,1 point,Tue May 26 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"Preferably Innoventions.   And, it sound bad, but I see Toontown as Arendelle in the future."

Disneyland,379z65,DisneyLand_newbie,8,Tue May 26 01:59:06 2015 UTC,only steep discount i know of is if you are military.
Disneyland,379z65,95688it,10,Tue May 26 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Discount tickets are NOT the way to save money on a trip to Disneyland. Buying ""discount tickets"" online is the easiest way to get scammed, as a matter of fact. Being smart about buying food/merchandise is the best way to keep costs down."
Disneyland,379z65,dodgepodge,6,Tue May 26 05:17:21 2015 UTC,July will be one of the busiest months this year since it will contain both the 4th of July and the actual 60th anniversary (July 17th).  As a result don't expect any major discounts on tickets.   Your best bet it to check with your employer to see if they have any benefits that may help or check with organizations like AAA.   The deals won't be huge savings but it may help a bit.
Disneyland,379z65,Shatteredreality,-2,Tue May 26 05:17:16 2015 UTC,I am thinking of going during the last week of July. Perhaps that'll mean some good deals?
Disneyland,379z65,fontizmo,6,Wed May 27 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"Yup, ticket discounts aren't the way to go. Start by looking for an inexpensive hotel room nearby (you can usually find one on Harbor for $90) and bring your own food into the park. That's really all you can do! Good luck!"

Disneyland,379z65,izookie,3,Wed May 27 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"They just got rid of their 2-day 1 park promotion, and with the 60th anniversary on full blast, I'd doubt you can expect any discounts in the foreseeable future.  I would also recommend staying away from any online deals that you might come across. There have been numerous reports lately about people getting scammed."

A couple of them hang out near the castle, while another group hangs out next to Adventureland/Jolly Holiday.  Every so often, during the worst possible times, the baby ducks decide to leave the planters.  We physically cannot touch the ducks, but we try to shoo them back into planters because it's too dangerous for the babies. It doesn't help that the babies literally have zero fear of people and all the people that notice them want to go pet them.  The other day, I was trying to get one to go back into the planter by blocking it with my feet. Whenever it took a step in the wrong direction, I shifted my feet to block its path. After doing this a few times, it jumped up onto my shoe, did this adorable ""Peep! Peep!"" at me, and then jumped off the other side of my shoe to go wander into a walkway full of people. -.-"

Disneyland,378nlv,samsooni,5,Mon May 25 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"Well neither will really put you ""closer"" to the toddler friendly stuff since you will have to go through the main gate of either park to gain access to them.   DLH has the advantage of being close to the Monorail which give direct access to Tomorrowland and the GCH hotel guest entrance which puts you by Grizzly River Rapids in DCA.   the Best Western will be closer to the main gate of each park since you won't have to go through Downtown Disney at all.   Ultimately being close to specific things within the park is a pretty moot point since you have to funnel through the entrance to the park to get to them in the first place.   Ultimately I'd say that if cost is a concern at all go with the Best Western since it will probably be quite a bit cheaper and puts you closer to the main gates.   The main gates lead to Main Street and Buena Vista Street and there are often character meet and greets going on in those areas which I imagine could be fun depending on how well your toddler can recognize their favorite characters.   There are child friendly things in bassically every section of the parks but I imagine a lot of your time will be spent in Fantasyland.   No real shortcuts would exist from the hotel."

Is it owned by Disneyland?  Would that be 'enough' space for a toontown-size land, or is that way less space?  Also, do you think they may tear down innoventions to make an actual ride?"

Aside from Roger Rabbit, they could use the space SO MUCH BETTER.  It's ridiculous how the precious, precious real estate is being used on defunct bounce houses and gadget's freaking go coaster   One drawback of Star Wars land is that it will attract a RIDICULOUS amount of people to Disneyland and clog up all the lines :).

I have heard that there is a code name for the project that is happening in Inventions, didn't happen to catch the name and I can't say much more.  As for all of that backstage area, they can not take away anymore on the west side or east side of Disneyland. The only open areas in DCA would very much eat into the limited space left, keep in mind semi-trucks have to be able to get to a majority of the park, both backstage and on stage.   Their best bet is placing something north and taking out backstage buildings there or eventually buying more land and having the parks spread. My opinion would be to take out the lots next to the paradise pier hotel, but it's also where they have the finish line and reunion area for all the marathons. Time will tell, as I always say when we are in a tight area, ""Walt why didn't you buy more land?!"""

Easy plan: Paint + Forever Watch it by ""small world"" for best parade views grab a spot 2h ahead (6:50). The best view is probably Main St but you need to really camp out for a curb spot. You will not have time to get to DCA for the 10:15p WoC. Maybe they'll add an 11:00p show too? But these are the 2 best new shows IMO.  Good plan: WoC + Paint Go to WoC 1st at 9:00p (get FP as early as you can). Get in line in you color area about 30m-1h before you FP call. Grab a fence spot with as little obstructions as possible (including people). You will see some fireworks as you exit. Grab a spot in Town Square or Main St for Paint The Night 11:00.

I get done quick while they're still quite a ways back in line.  Once we get the RSR fastpasses, then we head over to Cars Land to see what the line up is like for RSR.    This way you get good viewing area for WOC and should get a good time for RSR fastpass as well as ride it at least twice for the day (it's my favourite ride so this is a must)."

Disneyland,373qht,MissC_9227,32,Sun May 24 16:25:56 2015 UTC,GOOD. Spend that money on resort improvements/attractions instead.
Disneyland,373qht,robots_and_cancer,17,Sun May 24 19:12:45 2015 UTC,100% agreed.  Locals with APs make up a HUGE portion of the crowd and planning weeks ahead just wouldn't make sense
Disneyland,373qht,collegemathchef,5,Sun May 24 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"But you're not seeing what Disney is doing here.  They don't want to cater to the APs anymore.  APs don't spend money at the same rates as vacation guests.  If you've been to DLR 100 times, you're bringing your own ears, you've got your car so you're running over to McDonald's for food (or you brought your own), and you're not buying any other souvenirs, nor or you staying in a hotel that funnels money back to the Mouse.  And that's before we get into the issue that you paid significantly less to get into the parks that day than a weeklong vacationer.  (Dividing your AP cost over the number of times you go in a year.)  In Disney's view, APs clog the parks with ""free riders"" who don't contribute to the bottom line.  To think that they are incentivized to make things AP friendly is just economically incorrect.  They have every incentive to make it harder for APs, and their policies over the last few years (including the discontinuation of certain tiers of APs and removing free parking) bear this out.  As the economy recovers and more people can take vacations, you're going to see more of this from Disney.  They needed APs before thanks to the economic collapses of the 90's and 2008, but they don't as much now."
Disneyland,373qht,TomCollinsEsq,3,Mon May 25 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, to a degree.  I mean, there are definitely times of the year (summer) that APs are a burden for Disneyland.  This is certainly why they've modified the rules in the past few years, gotten rid of free parking, etc.   However, it's not like Disneyland wants to get rid of APs completely, or else the would.  Maybe a small % of people fall into the category you mention, but APs I know still pay for parking, buy ~2 meals, and regularly buy souvenirs when they go.  They are Disney fanatics.  While the profit difference would exist (compared to an overseas tourist, say), it's not like Disney is gaining nothing.    On top of everything, even a full WDW Fastpass+ system wouldn't kill  APs either.  People would just learn to plan ahead more.  I usually go on Sundays throughout the year, and so I would just plan out a bunch of separate trips."
Disneyland,373qht,collegemathchef,3,Mon May 25 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, I totally agree with you. It isn't that they want to do away with APs. They have a place and they help during slow season.  But the days of them being catered to? That's over, and the sooner that APs realize that, the better."
Disneyland,373qht,TomCollinsEsq,-6,Mon May 25 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"Oh FP+ IS coming to Disneyland. This article was only about the Magic Bands not coming ""in the near future."" Even if all hotel guests were able to book their FP+ ahead of time, I believe the flexibility and convenience will be an improvement to the current system."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,3,Sun May 24 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"You think logistically blocking out 80% of park guests from the Fastpass system and forcing everyone to change their vacation planning habits is ""flexibility and convenience""?  FP+ may come to Disneyland, but I hope it's downright unrecognizable from the Disney World version."
Disneyland,373qht,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Mon May 25 03:01:07 2015 UTC,"There are fewer than 3000 hotel rooms total at the Resort. Even if every room was booked, and every guest made FP reservations, it wouldn't make a dent in the FP selections available for a given day (I estimate <10%). Disney is well aware of this but wants to incentivize vacationers. If anything the only losers will be those not technologically inclined or people who can't commit to plans beyond a few days. The nice thing is that FP+ can be changed and you can plan out your day or just your night.  For example, we just drove to DCA just to get World of Color FPs and then came back home. I already spent the whole day Saturday at the parks and I cannot spend the whole day at the parks today but I wanted to see World of Color. If we had FP+, I could have booked my FP online and saved myself some gas and time. Also waking up early after a late night was not so magical.  Another example is Radiator Springs Racers, where FPs ran out so fast in the mornings that I didn't get a FP for the first year it was open despite averaging 40 visits per year. I would have loved to book a night FP a few days ahead and had dinner at Flo's V8 and do Cars Land. Sounds like a perfect weeknight date night. Standing in a 180 minute standby, not so much."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,23,Mon May 25 18:33:07 2015 UTC,The amount of money it would have costed to implement was not worth the minor convenience it would have brought in ticket distribution and fast pass. The whole planning fast passes days in advance would not have worked in park where a huge portion of the AP attendees seem to visit on a whim. It'll be nice to keep a relic of the theme parks of old in physical tickets.
Disneyland,373qht,SmartestDumbTeen,1 point,Sun May 24 17:57:53 2015 UTC,I bet most of the cost was blanketing all 4 parks and bajillion hotels at Walt Disney World with wifi. They probably hired the healthcare.gov website people too.
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,3,Mon May 25 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"I just got back from a WDW vacation. I have mixed feelings on the bands. I like having my CC, hotel room and ticket on my wrist. I didn't like that the system is fussy and doesn't work sometimes. It's frustrating when you're trying to buy something and the CM responds with ""sorry. The system is fussy"". I hate fp+ I think fast passes should only be booked day of once your ticket is activated (gone through the turnstiles). Because I didn't buy my park tickets until day of everything I wanted to fast pass was booked so I either didn't use the fast passes assigned to me or just waited in line. I wasn't a fan of that."
Disneyland,373qht,TheBroadwayBelle,3,Mon May 25 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"""Not in the near future"" is not a ""never"" statement. I believe Magic Band will be implemented at Disneyland.  Beyond cost and convenience, these things add to the whole experience of being inside the Disney bubble.  Just as the berm around Disneyland shields us from the outside world, the seamless reservation and sales that Magic Bands provides - helps keep us in that world without having to think about our wallets and keeping track of dozens of little scraps of paper.  This combination of technology, business efficiency, and service screams ""Disney"" and I predict that most locals on the West Coast will not miss needlessly killing trees."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,9,Mon May 25 19:26:26 2015 UTC,Kinda sad about this. Would've been cool not to have to dig out passes and credit cards all the time. Oh well.
Disneyland,373qht,sparklyshizzle,7,Sun May 24 17:07:34 2015 UTC,They could allow people to attach the ticket to their Disney account and have NFC readers at the gates. Then people could use their phones or smart watches to get in. In fact they could be used as a magicband.
Disneyland,373qht,999mal,7,Sun May 24 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Remember, just because MagicBands may not be coming to DLR, that doesn't mean that FP+, My Disney Experience, and the like won't.  Some version of it will.  They spent too much money on it not to have it planned to scale outward to the other parks."
Disneyland,373qht,TomCollinsEsq,3,Sun May 24 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"The article just said ""near future"" and other I have seen say that FP+ testing begins in August. So maybe Magic Bands will come in 2016?"
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,3,Sun May 24 19:40:54 2015 UTC,"Yes to this. I think Magic Bands will be obsolete in few years anyway since all nearly phones and smart watches will have NFC/RFID. WDW gives RFID cards as physical tickets for day guests. Notice how the gate people are using handhelds to scan instead of their computers? I imagine this would be a scalable solution to the pole-in-the-ground WDW scanners. Imagine if your iPhone was also your Annual Pass? Apple Pay at WDW was pretty incredible, IMO."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,3,Sun May 24 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"But there will always be a need to accommodate those without cell phones. This is especially true in families. The age at which kids get smartphones in America is going down, but there's definitely a floor under which the young guest will always need something else.  To be honest, I much preferred MagicBands to ApplePay. Pulling out my phone is easier than pulling out my wallet. But touching my wrist to the terminal is easier than both."
Disneyland,373qht,stevensokulski,1 point,Mon May 25 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"I was the other way around at WDW as I found myself holding my phone and not having to type in my PIN. Also, watching my spending on my debit account was nicer than fearing that hotel room tab at the end of our trip."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,1 point,Mon May 25 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"A way to see your front desk registry on the app would be nice, though probably not in Disney's best interests. I was pleasantly surprised by my hotel tab, which was shocking given the amount of time my group spent at Food & Wine."
Disneyland,373qht,stevensokulski,6,Mon May 25 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"I agree! I was really hoping this would eventually happen for DLR, even if they removed the ""day planning"" aspect.

Disneyland,373qht,Pinklette,2,Tue May 26 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"I think it will still be coming just in a phase a little later down the line. Website and mobile apps will most likely be first to iron out all the bugs. CMs will probably use handhelds to scan barcodes with FP+ reservations attached to paper tickets or AP cards. Then as the networks are confirmed, they will be able to go to RFID at all FP+ attractions and salespoints. Next is all the Magic Bands and Magic Band merchandise! Then I predict, and NFC or RFID phone, smart watch, or wearable being your actual ticket media / FP+ / hotel key / Disney Visa / Gift Card / dining reservation / PhotoPass / ride pictures & video."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,1 point,Mon May 25 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. After visiting WDW, I've been hoping for some rollout of this technology on the west coast. Of course, they will utilize some of it, for sure.  But the MagicBands in particular made getting into the park, using FastPasses, and shopping so much easier. Even without the scheduling component, the hardware is still a boon, I think.  I wonder if the band itself has become something a symbol of the troubled WDW rollout and won't come to the west coast initially to allow them to prove its usefulness without all of the judgement?"
Disneyland,373qht,stevensokulski,2,Mon May 25 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"I would love for Fast Passes to be digitized to my AP or a hard ticket, though."
Disneyland,373qht,Wonderground,-1,Mon May 25 00:41:09 2015 UTC,Ding Dong the witch is dead! The commercial failure of magic band in Florida was responsible for quite a few setbacks for Disneyland expansions/refurbishments. I'm glad they're not going to push it just because they developed it.
Disneyland,373qht,FLYNN82,15,Sun May 24 17:33:00 2015 UTC,I don't see why people are so against magicbands? It seems like they are a nice convenience.
Disneyland,373qht,999mal,10,Sun May 24 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"From a technological point of view, they appear to me to be just the wrong form factor for a trip to Disneyland. In Disney World, the justification was that the magic band would replace literally everything in your wallet. Disney would have your ticket, your hotel key, your Fastpasses, your credit card details, everything, on your bracelet. This makes sense in Disney World. People go to Disney World on week long vacations, they stay in hotels on property, and never leave. Lots of them come from out of state and don't bring cars. The idea of leaving your wallet in your hotel room and relying on the bracelets seems like a nice thing.  At Disneyland, most guests don't stay on property, they mostly come directly from home to stay for the day. Those guests aren't going to be leaving their wallets at home, because they need their driver's licenses, they may need to fill up with gas, they need their AAA card in case they get in an accident, and lots of people will go to the McDonald's across the street to grab dinner at the end of the day instead of paying Disney's marked up prices.   If people aren't going to leave their wallets behind when they go to the park, then the whole justification of the bands seems pointless. You're always going to have your wallet on you with all your cards, your IDs, everything, anyway. It's not like you're going to leave them at home, because you need your wallet to drive to the park. So why do you need to spend the time at the front entrance ticket booths the morning of your visit, activating your family's magic bands, just so you can have a cool, yet pointless, piece of wireless technology strapped to you all day?  Now, we don't need Magic Bands to get the benefits of Disney World's system. Before the Magic Bands were introduced, Disney World APs got to use RFID cards to test the system out.  http://www.chipandco.com/annual-passholder-cards-rfid-technology-103029/  They did exactly the same thing that the wristbands do, they consolidate the amount of technology that you have to wear around, they can still be linked to your credit cards and everything(possibly also automatically adding the AP discounts which would reduce the card juggling that I have to do every time I buy something at the resort right now, where I have to swipe my AP, then my debit card, then show my photo ID, all just to buy a drink), they can still act as your room keys if you stay on property, and they go right into your wallet to be stored safely away, without requiring anyone to worry about leaving Magic Bands at home, or spending time syncing up bands at the ticket booths, or really thinking about them at all, and they'll cost so much less money for Disneyland to implement. Literally the only thing that would have to change in the Fastpass distribution machines, which would just need a reprogramming to keep the machines from spitting out tickets and an RFID scanner at the Fastpass Return line. The restaurants and shops and entrance turnstyles could still use the same barcodes and magnetic strips that they do now.  My alternative proposal would be to introduce RFID cards to Disneyland instead of Magic Bands. They make so much more sense to APs and day trippers than wrist bands, you can print them inside of paper tickets like the ones used on the LA Metro, you wouldn't have to train guests to use the new system, and they function identically to the magic bands without actually having a dorky band."
Disneyland,373qht,EagleEyeInTheSky,6,Sun May 24 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"Of all the responses, I feel like you understand the actual difference between Florida and California the best; the parks are visited by completely different populations with totally different expectations and needs.   I used the magic band in Florida and loved it. I also spent well over 6 months planning that trip and recognized that I was ""behind schedule."" I live in the Bay Area, so DisneyLand isn't a day trip for me now, but it's still not anywhere near the grand orchestration required for the other coast.   I suspect we may see something optional for the California parks; the Apple Watch is a hugely similar experience to the magic band, and as smartwatches become commonplace, it could be the solution to meeting the spontaneity needs of local residents while allowing more planning (that is, the ability to ensure you won't miss out on your top wish list items) for those of us traveling a bit further."
Disneyland,373qht,DorianC0C0C0,2,Mon May 25 01:05:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for the awesome explanation.   Even with everything you've said I think the WDW system for passes would work fine at DLR.  WDW still use RFID cards for non-hotel guests. APs get a magic band as well (I believe their cards are also RFID enabled).  If they are going to roll out RFID in CA I don't see a reason they wouldn't bring MagicBands along. Day guests can get the card and buy a magic band seperatly if they want to (I think WDW sells them for like $12) while hotel guests get a magic band to have the benefit of not having to carry a wallet around.   APs can choose to bring the card or magic band (which is free for APs).  The reason I don't think it's coming is because of the cost associated with implementing RFID at DL compared to the current barcode system that exists today.
Disneyland,373qht,Shatteredreality,1 point,Mon May 25 17:44:49 2015 UTC,"The major cost and time will be putting some type of reader tech at the front of every FP+ queue.  WDW installed wifi throughout their huge properties and I think that's where a lot of the ""cost"" came from.  Having a wifi network that huge is probably extremely expensive and difficult.  Major Universities still have problems providing wifi on their small campuses.  I don't think wifi is needed at Disneyland as their is somewhat workable cell data throughout the parks.  Seems like the handheld scanners are going to be they ways this system is going to work."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,1 point,Mon May 25 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the DAS system already takes care of that part.   Off the top of my head I know that Indiana Jones, Pirates, Haunted Mansion, BTMRR, Alice in Wonderland, Matterhorn, Space Mountian, Star Tours all have CMs at the exit with an iPod/Phone that has a scanner that doles out return times for disabled guests. The same ipods/phones also verify that guests come back at the correct time (all by scanning their passes).   From my understanding they run on Wifi and right now it's a little sketchy but long story short it's already in place for one system. If they did something similar for FP+ I imagine minimal upgrades."
Disneyland,373qht,Shatteredreality,2,Mon May 25 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting. WDW provides free wifi to all guests though and I think that was budgeted in with MM+, FP+, and Magic Bands. I just don't think that free wifi would be needed at Disneyland given the decent cell coverage."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,1 point,Mon May 25 19:31:35 2015 UTC,There's decent cell coverage at WDW as well. It is hugely beneficial to have the Wi-Fi because it's sort of a guarantee that you can tell guests to use the app and connect and not have worries that it won't be getting the job done.   Add Wi-Fi calling on some carriers to that and it's even better because I can just turn data off to save battery
Disneyland,373qht,AbsolutelyClam,0,Wed May 27 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think one of the reasons that going all card and no Magic Band would be awesome is because cards can have RFID, barcodes, and mag strips. The RFID cards could still work with all the current infrastructure. Whereas if you had Magic Bands, every POS machine and turnstile would need to have an RFID system installed to accommodate guests without barcodes and mag strips."
Disneyland,373qht,EagleEyeInTheSky,1 point,Mon May 25 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"Things for the good response. So it seems that you mainly dislike the form of Magicband, couldn't disney just offer both? I also suggested further up that Disney could allow your ticket to attach to your Disney account and then use your phone or smartwatch. Apple is rumored to allow access to the NFC in iOS 9 and Google already does so they would only have to update their Credit Card terminals and the handheld machines at the front gate."
Disneyland,373qht,999mal,1 point,Mon May 25 06:36:09 2015 UTC,"I would rather them just add $.05 RFID tags to their current paper tickets. RFID on phones is........troublesome. You're going to be relying on everyone having updated OS's. I would say maybe half of the smart phones actually in use today probably can't even use RFID due to software blockages, carrier limitations(blocked secure elements), or just not even having RFID chips in them.  If the LA Metro and Metrolink can afford to have RFID chips in every single flexible paper ticket you buy from them, with no synchornization needed or anything, then Disney can afford to as well.  Plus it requires almost no ""rollout"" or ""training"" for the park guests. Everyone would get RFID chips, and the casual guests probably wouldn't have ever realized that Disney changed the ticketing system at all."
Disneyland,373qht,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Mon May 25 07:00:00 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what Walt Disney World does for day guests... They have cards with an RFID tag embedded and they just wave the cards at the scanners instead of their wrists. Seems like Disneyland Annual Passholders already ""wear"" their ticket media on their pin lanyards anyway."
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,5,Mon May 25 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Just came back from WDW week long vacation in January. Using the Magic band for my hotel, fast passes, payment and tickets was amazing and convenient. Im assuming the people who trash it have never used it.  But i do agree that having them in Disneyland is silly. Its only 2 Parks with 3 resorts"
Disneyland,373qht,RobieFLASH,2,Mon May 25 05:39:54 2015 UTC,I agree. I was at WDW in January too and could immediately see how this tech would improve my experiences as a local AP at Disneyland. I don't know where all this unfounded outright hate for Magic Bands is coming from...
Disneyland,373qht,izookie,1 point,Mon May 25 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"I think the hate seems to stem from a combination of three things.   1) The bands look kinda dorky. Not exactly a smooth look in the world of the sexy future tech we live in.   2) They get a lot of blame for why XYZ hasn't happened yet/ won't happen. (They cost too much to implement, so now X isn't happening!)  3) Fear of change. They don't ""see a need,"" so of course there's no reason to update the system…"
Disneyland,373qht,Pinklette,2,Tue May 26 04:04:34 2015 UTC,To be honest one of the big reasons I want it is so that my family doesn't have to race in to collect our fastpasses for the day. Plus you don't have to worry about losing your ticket as much and you can attach money for kids to use.
Disneyland,373qht,999mal,1 point,Mon May 25 06:37:42 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of once you're in the park and your ticket has been scanned, either you day ticket or AP, you can book 3 fast passes. Or even 1 and then you can book an other at an other time. I don't like the whole ""it's January 2015, my trip is in September 2015, gotta get this mine train fp now"" I'm living in South Carolina so for us WDW is a last minute hop in the car and go and for us, we get shafted. I'm looking forward to going back to Disneyland."
Disneyland,373qht,TheBroadwayBelle,0,Mon May 25 10:25:47 2015 UTC,"I think people trash it because it cost a ridiculous amount of money and had a lot of problems at the beginning at the expense of new attractions or face lifts happening at the parks.   There's also the folk who believe it takes a way a huge along of privacy by giving Disney all your information and NFC can be hacked.   I'm with you though, I haven't used them, but it seems ridiculously convenient."
Disneyland,373qht,elmatador12,5,Mon May 25 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"It does work, but it had a multitude of setbacks and went over budget. A lot of the Micechat editorials talked about this a couple years back. I'm against them because they kinda shaft people coming to the parks who aren't there on a multiday vacation. The article even mentions that the reasoning is that Disneyland is more local-oriented."
Disneyland,373qht,FLYNN82,3,Sun May 24 18:17:48 2015 UTC,Just wondering how magicbands affect people on single day visits?  FP+ I can understand people having issue with but the magicbands system just seems convenient.
Disneyland,373qht,Shatteredreality,1 point,Sun May 24 20:24:18 2015 UTC,"The while concept of magic bands is that everything can be planned ahead of time, sort of like fast passes taken to the extreme.  As a result it will become more difficult to just walk in to a restaurant and wait for a table, or decide at the last minute to go see Fantasmic or ride on Space Mountain.  Having to stick to a schedule or constantly monitor an app on your smartphone is not what I want to do when I'm at Disneyland."
Disneyland,373qht,h_lehmann,2,Mon May 25 14:41:45 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree with you on those points but I want to point out that there is a big difference between MagicBands and FastPass+ (both of which are part of the My Magic+ program).   Magic Bands are just RFID/NFC passes that can also be used for FP+, Hotel Keys, and payment (if staying at a hotel). They don't require any pre-planning at all.  FP+ is the system that allows you to reserve fast passes up to 60 days in advance (if a hotel guest) and 30 days for non-hotel guests.  DLR can totally switch to FP+ with the current tech (using barcodes on tickets instead of NFC/RFID) they would only need to change out the FP terminals.   MagicBands are the only part of the program they have said is NOT coming in the near future. FP+ could still come sooner rather than later but they have not confirmed one way or the other yet."
Disneyland,373qht,Shatteredreality,8,Mon May 25 17:37:38 2015 UTC,Commercial failure? You got any specifics to back that up? People who have actually used them seem to like them.
Disneyland,373qht,ChocoTacoz,5,Sun May 24 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"The commercial failure of magic band in Florida   Where have you seen it referred to as a failure?  The whole system ruined my latest trip to WDW, but I've never seen any articles referring to it as a failure."

Disneyland,378gxd,SuperHotLarry,11,Mon May 25 19:02:55 2015 UTC,"For every person that is sick of Frozen already, there are probably 1000 kids that still love it.  The lines for the Elsa and Anna meet and greet prove that it will be around for a long time."
Disneyland,378gxd,Jay-c58,2,Mon May 25 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"My wife and I went to the meet and greet for the first time on our recent trip.  (She loves getting pictures with the characters.)  We had to get a fastpass, but it was only about 45 minutes out, and once we got in the wait was pretty short.  (About 10 minutes)  We also got Olaf, who had no wait at all.  I think the Fastpass thing throws it off a little, but those lines are no where near as bad as they used to be.  (I actually told a Cast member that I was surprised at the wait for Olaf, because nothing Frozen-related had ever had that short of a line.)"
Disneyland,378gxd,RetroGamer42,1 point,Mon May 25 22:24:40 2015 UTC,Good to hear that the wait times have gone down.  Last time I was there the wait was around 2 hours which I personally think is a little much to get a picture.  Each to his own though.
Disneyland,378gxd,Jay-c58,4,Tue May 26 00:10:00 2015 UTC,"To answer your question: Either when it stops making them money, or something else comes along that's bigger than Frozen.  I was in DL last week.  The new Frozen stuff was noticeable, but I didn't feel like it was super overwhelming.  Maybe if the Freeze the Night thing were still in place of the Mad T Party, it would have been worse, but neither of them were running, so oh well.  It's a little weird that the plays near the fantasy fair have been replaced by Frozen.  That's probably my only complaint - I liked the Tangled show.  Having a Frozen section in WoC, AND Disneyland Forever is probably a bit much, but it doesn't bother me personally.  And it's one float in the parade, which isn't much to complain about."
Disneyland,378gxd,RetroGamer42,2,Mon May 25 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"At one point, songs from The Little Mermaid were in both World of Color and the fireworks show, Magical. I never saw any complaints about that."

Disneyland,378gxd,booboothechicken,1 point,Tue May 26 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"It's not that. They of course cater to everyone as best they can, but I would also say, there is a large majority of people who do not like the movie and who also have to deal with it. It's kind of like what happened to that movie ""Avatar"". It was really over-hyped and people got burnt out of it really quickly. Sure there were people who enjoyed it, but there were also people who got sick of it."
Disneyland,378gxd,booboothechicken,2,Tue May 26 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"The people who dislike Frozen absolutely does not constitute the ""large majority"".  If that were true, there wouldn't be Frozen stuff in the park."
Disneyland,378gxd,TotoTheBunny,2,Tue May 26 02:40:32 2015 UTC,"Disney doesn't care if people are tired of ""Frozen"". As long as it makes money, they will continue to push ""Frozen"" stuff. They are a business after all."
Disneyland,374idd,Fudgity,7,Sun May 24 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Been to Disneyland dozens of times-practically every year since childhood.   1) Huge difference with the crowd as there are more people in the summer compared to January. Keep in mind that not only are tourists coming, but also local kids who have summer break from school.   2) Sorry, don't know the answer to that.   3) I don't have the official exact number of days, but  I remember on one occasion, it was less than 10 days. Probably around 5 or 6.  Have fun on your vacation!"
Disneyland,374idd,xmashtardis,5,Sun May 24 22:05:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply and help!  On 1), would you say that the crowds on the 3rd - 6th of Jan are much smaller than mid July?"
Disneyland,374idd,xmashtardis,5,Sun May 24 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, any day in January is much less crowded than any day in July. A lot of schools are back in session by that time. It's always more crowded during the summer months. I was just there two weeks ago and the crowd wasn't bad at all compared to how it would be in the summer months.   EDIT: I just realized that you're coming from Australia so my answers probably are not clear enough. July is a summer month for us here. Schools are in session from September to June and theme parks here are more packed when schools are not in session. Although schools have a break during the holiday season for Christmas and New Year's, most schools are usually back in session the following Monday after New Year's. Thus, the week you plan on coming should be okay. I hope this helps. If you have anymore questions, feel free to message me. Happy travels!"
Disneyland,374idd,xmashtardis,6,Mon May 25 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info (and for being so pleasant!), a lot of things I have read with regard to crowd levels pre the 6th of January have always tended towards it being real busy, but I couldn't figure out why as like you said kids go back to school after New Years. We could handle the mid-july crowds, so if it is any less then we should be a-ok. Thanks again!"
Disneyland,374idd,xmashtardis,4,Mon May 25 07:24:58 2015 UTC,"You're most welcome! Again, feel free to message me for any more questions.   Just a heads up, if you plan on dining at the Blue Bayou (the restaurant that the Pirates of the Caribbean boats pass by, and I definitely recommend it), they now only take reservations.  And apparently, spots get filled up pretty quick. So best to reserve ahead of time. A relative of mine mentioned that you must reserve one month ahead.  By the way, I love your country. Was there 15 years ago. I'm sure a lot has changed since then, but I had the most pleasant experience there."

Disneyland,373hf1,booboothechicken,6,Mon May 25 04:37:43 2015 UTC,You missed Grizzly Peak Airfield and the digital upgrade for Soarin'.
Disneyland,373hf1,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Sun May 24 17:44:24 2015 UTC,Was it just an update to 4k?
Disneyland,373hf1,Prophoto2,3,Sun May 24 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I wouldn't word it as an upgrade to 4K. It was an upgrade from film to 4K. Technically film doesn't have a resolution, and when the ride first opened, the IMAX film was probably much better than the 4K digital projectors that was just put in. If you want to talk about quality, film will technically always be the maximum resolution that one can achieve. However, the film has degraded over the years, and the digital upgrade has brought it back up to near opening day quality by removing all the spots in the old film and bringing the vibrance and clarity back from what it once was. The new digital film also won't degrade, which is nice."
Disneyland,373hf1,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Sun May 24 21:23:28 2015 UTC,What would really make a difference is a upgrade to 60FPS.
Disneyland,373hf1,thatcaveman,2,Mon May 25 16:22:12 2015 UTC,The refresh rate definitely seems higher than the film version. It feels like the difference of 60Hz vs 120Hz televisions.

A lot of the schools in SoCal are out for summer break or it's their last week so that means minimum days or some kids not going at all.

Disneyland,3747jt,Techsupportvictim,-3,Mon May 25 21:43:15 2015 UTC,You will be able to see Captain America and Thor over in tomorrowland. That's pretty much all the marvel you will get at the moment sadly. The area dedicated though is pretty neat. They have a ton of iron man suits you can see.
Disneyland,3747jt,DennisNedrysGhost,7,Sun May 24 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, both those meet and greets have been removed with the closure of Innoventions."
Disneyland,3747jt,doktortaru,7,Sun May 24 20:50:21 2015 UTC,Thor and Captain America had a meet and greet today in between the tomorrowland terrace and innovations. It did not look permanent but it was there today.
Disneyland,3747jt,pixie1818,3,Mon May 25 01:12:58 2015 UTC,But at least you can get an Iron Man Dessert Waffle at Pizza Port... It's actually pretty good... Just not what I imagined Iron Man's face to taste like.
Disneyland,3747jt,izookie,2,Sun May 24 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"Both Thor and Captain America where there on Friday, just in front of Innoventions. Although, I am not sure if that was just a special meet and greet set up for the 24 hour event or if they will be appearing there again."
Disneyland,3747jt,tenshi_73,2,Sun May 24 23:18:48 2015 UTC,According to my friends who are photo CMs it was a special thing for the 24 hour day.
Disneyland,3747jt,doktortaru,2,Sun May 24 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"Innoventions, the place with the Iron Man suit showcase, is currently closed ."

Disneyland,36zhwn,FawkesFire13,8,Sat May 23 16:45:47 2015 UTC,I wasn't at the event but I still want to express my gratitude. I'm sure it took a lot of work and effort on behalf of everyone to pull it off. Do you have any crazy stories?
Disneyland,36zhwn,ravbuscus,8,Sat May 23 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"From this particular event, no. Most guests I encountered where pretty relaxed. I didn't work the funky hours overnight. I was day side. I heard the Starbucks in both Parks were a absolute nightmare. I only ran into sleepy folks who had beeb waiting around since 3am to get in, and people who were trying to catnap and conserve energy for the overnight part. I did drink a bit more soda/ coffee then I planned on just because the amount of people in the park was a lot more then average. That makes me tired more then anything."
Disneyland,36zhwn,FawkesFire13,5,Sat May 23 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"Went to Flo's for coffee at about 2am after passing by ff&p and seeing the insane coffee line. No wait at flo's, it was great"

Disneyland,36zhwn,FawkesFire13,4,Sat May 23 23:35:27 2015 UTC,I worked at Fiddlers to 7 am and the line was about and hour and half long till around 4 in the morning ish.

Disneyland,36zhwn,mildly_interesting,18,Sat May 23 20:04:00 2015 UTC,"I would love to second this post. These cast members not only knew what to do, but did it in a way that was enjoyable for us every second. The pump up for the Paint the Night parade was one of the best ways I saw CM interacting with the guests and It was one of my favorite moments from the event!"
Disneyland,36zhwn,kcnovember,17,Sat May 23 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"I wanted to thank the guests who treated me like a human being, not a robot there to serve you.  Yesterday was rough. I'm usually pretty funny but yesterday it just really took a toll on me. Guests weren't talking to me, instead they all just looked angry. I usually get a lot more friendlier people who ask me how I'm doing and tell me a bit about their day, but yesterday I only had about two or three. I did have one guest who told me that he wanted to GC me :)  If there were any cast members that you especially want to thank, (and this isn't exclusive just to yesterday) please please go to city hall and thank them with a guest compliment."
Disneyland,36zhwn,stoke3,6,Sat May 23 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for mentioning the GC. I'm telling all my park-obsessed friends about this if they don't already know. Any way we can give a little back to Cast Members, we're more than happy to do so."
Disneyland,36zhwn,Byreenie,3,Sun May 24 06:21:08 2015 UTC,Hmmm... GC?
Disneyland,36zhwn,mamamonkey,9,Sun May 24 03:41:11 2015 UTC,Guest compliment. You can go to city hall and give a good report about a cast member and the cast member gets notified and it makes them feel gangsta af yo.
Disneyland,36zhwn,Byreenie,2,Sun May 24 04:46:16 2015 UTC,Do you know if it works to send them to Guest Relations online? We sent three in after our last trip; hope they got to the CMs that were so awesome to us. I didn't know you could do it at City Hall and I'll be trying to do that next time.
Disneyland,36zhwn,mamamonkey,2,Mon May 25 04:26:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I don't know. Where did you send them? Knowing how things work at Disney, I'm sure your notes found their way to the proper people.  At City Hall, the cast member just asks you what the other cast member did to make your visit more enjoyable and they write it down for you. They ask you the name of the cast member, the location, and I think the general time it happened. I thought I was going to write it down myself and I hadn't collected my thoughts before going to do it so it was kind of awkward haha."
Disneyland,36zhwn,TalithaRabboni,1 point,Mon May 25 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"I used a web form on the Disneyland website: https://disneyland.disney.go.com/ca/help/email/ One of the options is ""feedback about your visit"" so I used that."
Disneyland,36zhwn,FawkesFire13,7,Mon May 25 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"I wasn't at the 24-hour event, but I'll take any opportunity to tell Cast Members how amazing they are. :D"
Disneyland,36zhwn,Pucca_banrion,18,Sat May 23 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"You're sweet. Thanks. Sometimes hearing a simple ""thank you"" can change your whole day as a CM.  In fact, after my grandpa passed away I took some time away, and mourned with my family. Coming back to work was difficult. You're supposed to be happy and cheerful. My fellow CMs were understanding and supportive of course, but being onstage isn't exactly easy after you've lost someone and you never know what might effect you. Anyhow, I was onstage loading in my show and noticed a pair of grandparents and three kids laughing together. I froze up, I felt the tears coming. Then a minute later I sniffed, put a smile on my face and continued loading. A young lady nearby had apparently seen the emotions fly across my face, because she came over and smiled at me. Then said: "" I'm not sure what youre going thru, but whatever it is, it must hurt. Thank you for being here. You're doing a great job."" I'll never forget it, because it was what I needed to hear. Moral of the story: CMs are people too. We like hearing thank you just as much as you do."
Disneyland,36zhwn,FawkesFire13,3,Sat May 23 18:21:38 2015 UTC,I teared up reading this. I lost my grandfather over a decade ago and I still miss him daily. It's so hard to lose someone yet it's something we all experience multiple times in our lifetimes. I commend you for both keeping up appearances but also knowing you needed time to grieve.
Disneyland,36zhwn,TalithaRabboni,2,Sat May 23 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"It's not easy when your heart is broken inside to keep the smile on, but I was grateful to that young lady."
Disneyland,36zhwn,FawkesFire13,3,Sat May 23 23:35:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a receptionist, and I know how hard it is to be ""on"" all the time, to be courteous and welcoming. At Disneyland, I imagine it's even harder, considering how emotions can run high there. And at a 24-hour anniversary celebration with three new show premieres? You all deserve medals.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, but honestly, it's the Cast Members that make Disneyland so special. You put a face to the Disney magic and make it possible. That absolutely deserves a thank you."
Disneyland,36zhwn,Kiraspring7791,4,Sat May 23 23:16:40 2015 UTC,"It's wonderful to hear that people notice the CMs. It means a lot to all of us. We are here to make magic, but thanks and smiles from the guests keep us going."
Disneyland,36zhwn,bubblesugarsocks,3,Sat May 23 23:36:53 2015 UTC,I teared up when I read this. My Grandpa passed away yesterday and even tho he never got to go to Disneyland I know in my heart that he would have loved it. All cast members make Disneyland a special place and you do not get thanked enough. So thank you for all you do.
Disneyland,36zhwn,chocovash,5,Sun May 24 00:08:43 2015 UTC,"I was overwhelmed by how amazing everyone was yesterday--in line for Anna and Elsa I watched two castmembers perform truly impressive interpretive dance to all the animated sequences in the animation building and everyone at the gates was so chill in the wake of guests screaming bloody murder about the parks being closed. I wish there was a way to give a parkwide compliment to guest relations, I did my best to get names but I know I missed some!"
Disneyland,36zhwn,The1989dude,5,Sat May 23 23:42:32 2015 UTC,"I had a 12 hour shift over in critter country from the afternoon til way past midnight... I lost my sanity at the 11 hour mark, but I had a great time. Also, please keep your feet off the seats in front of you in splash mountain... I want to be able to show you and sell you your photo, but I can't if there's anything unsafe or inappropriate about it :C The foot holds are there to brace you in case of an emergency stop, so if I see feet up, your photo gets splashed away... I appreciated all of the guests that understood and got right back on like real troopers! I don't make the rules! <3"
Disneyland,36zhwn,luigifangirl,4,Sun May 24 09:54:14 2015 UTC,👍🏼 thank you! It makes our job easier when our guests are in good spirits.

Disneyland,36zhwn,luigifangirl,2,Sat May 23 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Glad you had fun!!!  Hey, weren't you the one that was wanting out of Carsland? How did that work out for you?"
Disneyland,36zhwn,Beachcommunity,2,Sat May 23 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"Hi! Yes it was lots of fun, the only part I disliked was parking in the Angels stadium, but it was easy to get home from there.  And yes that's me! When I was hired I got assigned to cars land, I didn't want it because I wanted to be in paradise pier. But it turned out that they never put me in cars at all, I got Hyperion/Aladdin after my traditions and as of now it's my only attraction, and it's super fun :)"

Disneyland,36zhwn,tehpopa,3,Sat May 23 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"Aww thanks so much! It's funny because a lot of cast members told me that it's rare to get hired into Hype, I suppose I was hired for the diamond celebration, and yes I love the show! Jasmines solo song is so pretty, and the cast members are super sweet."
Disneyland,36zhwn,paradisevendors,2,Sat May 23 21:13:00 2015 UTC,Yeah! I was about to say! My friend just got cross-trained from Racers there and she said it was cross-train only.

Disneyland,36zhwn,CosmicThunder,3,Sat May 23 20:05:58 2015 UTC,The Disney experience wouldn't be the same without the top-notch service and hospitality that the hard-working men and women of Disney provide.
Disneyland,36zhwn,Mentati,3,Sat May 23 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. The CM's were in rare form. Every one I spoke with was really into it. Even the guys running around sweeping up messes here and there were running up to people and asking them how long they'd been there, how long they were staying, etc."
Disneyland,36zhwn,at1251lastnight,3,Sat May 23 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"I spent the whole day there inside DLR. The CMs I encountered were awesome and seemed to be having fun with it, even when I'm sure it was a bunch of extra work. I luckily didn't experience any of the drama outside the gates, but tried to say thanks to all of the front gate guys and gals when I passed by that way to get a new map and when I left.  Thanks a ton to all the CMs, you guys make it into something more than just another day at the theme park."
Disneyland,36zhwn,trac54,2,Sat May 23 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"It's tiring, but it's worth it."

Disneyland,36zhwn,Techsupportvictim,2,Sat May 23 22:29:33 2015 UTC,The parks were filled with the best possible guests and cast.  I met SO MANY amazing guests and so many amazing cast members.  I asked every cast member how their day was going and I plan to do it every visit now.
Disneyland,36zhwn,OMGAdamWTF,2,Sun May 24 03:50:19 2015 UTC,This.   I seriously want to thank you all too. Been here since Wednesday and my mind is blown. You all make the magic happen.

Disneyland,36zhwn,tenshi_73,-27,Tue May 26 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with that just a tad. The cast was hardly perfect. I had to deal with rude cast members, especially at restaurants. AND, a biggie for me, gate staff that were well aware that Disneyland was being closed for even reentry that didn't tell folks this. Had they said at the gate when I left for dinner at DCA that I wasn't going to get back in even an hour later, despite being a re-entry, I wouldn't have left. And yes they knew. I asked the staff when I tried to come back how long the gates had been shut and they told me ten minutes before I exited that all gate staff were told no one was getting back in. Not even re-entry.   So a lot of the staff were great. But not all."

Sitting at the Carnation at night, watching Main Street go by with everything all lit up is a great way to grab a late break, too!"
Disneyland,372jjl,ExpertShitSandwich,3,Sun May 24 07:59:52 2015 UTC,The things that usually come up when this gets asked are:   Dole Whip Corn Dogs Turkey Legs Churros Lobster Nachos (Cove Bar at DCA)   In addition I'll add:   Monte Cristo at Blue Bayou or Cafe Orleans Popcorn (DCA has multible flavors like Dill and Caramel)
Disneyland,372jjl,Shatteredreality,4,Sun May 24 07:18:25 2015 UTC,"I found out the hard way that the Blue Bayou only has the monte cristo on their lunch menu, not for dinner. Maybe that'll help someone sometime."
Disneyland,372jjl,Jahonk,2,Sun May 24 14:59:19 2015 UTC,"If you're just interested in the food and not the atmosphere, the Monte Cristo at Café Orleans is definitely the better and cheaper option. And you won't need to bother with making reservations or waiting for a table like at the Blue Bayou."
Disneyland,372jjl,al3x094,2,Mon May 25 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"But they only serve the meatless one, if I recall correctly. If you want the real deal you have to go to Blue Bayou"

I would also recommend going to the cozy cone motel area in DCA and eating anything in a bread cone. They have chili and chicken verde but I think they added pulled pork after the 60th, not sure  if that one is temporary or not. I also hear there is breakfast in a cone but sadly I have never tried it."

I always love to get the fried chicken dinner from Plaza Inn at the end of Main Street. It is pretty much the best fried chicken I've had. Similarly good food can be found at Flo's V8 Cafe in DCA.

Though, a lot of Menchie's Frozen Yogurt places have Dole Whip now, so I don't waste my precious Disney time on that anymore.      Less hyped, but super delicious snacks include pretzels - both the cream cheese ones and the jalapeno cheddar, and the pomme frites at Cafe Orleans-the remoulade is soooo tasty!"

Disneyland,371d2j,sandbrah,2,Sat May 23 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"I noticed that many times when we go before 1030a, they always re-direct us to Gardenwalk , convention center, or the toy story lot. This happened for the last 6 times we went before 1030a. One time I tested it and we got to the park entrance and M&F structure was closed at 1040a. When we circled around after they redirected us it was open by 11a.  Now we just time it so we arrive after 11am and M&F structure is a straight shot"
Disneyland,371d2j,dadahuck,3,Sun May 24 00:19:19 2015 UTC,I went two weeks ago on a Thursday and I parked in the M&F lot. Got there before 9am.

Disneyland,371d2j,dadahuck,1 point,Sun May 24 02:29:29 2015 UTC,Yeah. I stayed within walking distance for one trip and driving distance another. Honestly having to worry about parking made my trip a lot less magical. It wouldn't be as big of a deal but I've got 3 kids all under 5 and a double stroller to haul around. M&F is the most convenient but even it was not ideal.
Disneyland,371d2j,CletusTSJY,2,Sun May 24 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"Strange. I've arrived at the park at pretty much every possible time in the day, and have never been diverted away from M&F. Last weekend we pulled in at 6:30AM and they didnt even start letting cars in to park until 7 but it was no problem getting there that early"
Disneyland,371d2j,TheRealMe99,3,Sun May 24 01:15:21 2015 UTC,Same here. I've been an AP holder for a few years now and didn't even know till now that being diverted to another lot was a thing. I've never parked in another lot. I always come down the 5 south exit Disneyland Dr. And head right into the Mickey and friends lot. I've also arrived at all hours of the day from early morning to late evening.
Disneyland,371d2j,jairific,2,Sun May 24 15:16:44 2015 UTC,Have you gone during 24-hour-day/60th celebration unveiling?  Because it's a completely different game
Disneyland,371d2j,Soulcrux,2,Sun May 24 01:22:34 2015 UTC,"Good point, I haven't gotten to one of those yet."
Disneyland,371d2j,TheRealMe99,1 point,Sun May 24 01:35:11 2015 UTC,Usually in my experiences when you get diverted to a different lot it's because they are expecting high traffic in the parks and they want to fill the other parking lots first. Now I just always go to TS instead because I hated all the wasted time we had from going to a different lot and it takes much longer to get on a tram than it does to get on a bus.

Disneyland,36xpi8,RonSwanson420,10,Mon May 25 03:06:19 2015 UTC,I'm so glad Disney is starting to play around with the projection technology they've been fond of lately on the rides! I really do think it looks and feels great and isn't too much of a distraction from the original charm of the attractions its been added to.
Disneyland,36xpi8,joyasumi,18,Sat May 23 05:07:44 2015 UTC,"This new door effect looks pretty awesome, especially when paired with the digital effects of Mara's room and the Gates of Doom. I actually hope that Disney keeps on adding these types of effects to the attraction. To me, it's making the attraction look better than ever, letting things pop out and feel very much alive and animated. Hey, perhaps this effect will also make them step up their game and keep the doors working more often now that the effect is tied to the door having to work."

Disneyland,36wb94,YAWKYAWKYAWKYAWK,68,Fri May 22 17:31:25 2015 UTC,They are going to end up banning them park-wide because you just can't count on people to have common sense or courtesy.

I have a huge problem when you have to duck and weave around them in crowds, they block the view of people at shows, and on rides it's just dangerous, and unfair to other guests to have rides shut down because of them. If people used them responsibly I don't think anyone would care. But that's not been the case for a while in Disneyland."

The kind of people who don't follow the rules are not the kind of people who are going to help make this ace feel special. Disney really should start kicking people and banning them for not following the simple rules.
Disneyland,36wb94,thebuggalo,5,Fri May 22 20:33:29 2015 UTC,The cast member on the Matterhorn told us that the official policy was to escort any individual out of the park who did not comply with the selfie stick rule. She said that in the past people dropped them on the rides cause risking and/or causing the rides to break down.   It's amazing how entitled people are. To think that it is so acceptable for them to break the rules.
Disneyland,36wb94,Sandiego280zx,12,Fri May 22 22:15:32 2015 UTC,We live in a world of self-entitlement.  No way people are going to listen.  This will continue to be a more common occurrence.
Disneyland,36wb94,fernker,3,Sat May 23 14:01:12 2015 UTC,Did the actual stick fall and cause a problem or the basic appearance of the stick causes the ride to be shut down?
Disneyland,36wb94,Rdubya44,36,Fri May 22 20:57:12 2015 UTC,They should stop selling them at Downtown Disney if they cause that many problems.

Funny thing, he doesnt own a selfie stick.   The ride operater told him to put it away when he sat in the cart. My buddy thought he was talking to someone else and ignored it. Then got told over the intercom while he was climbing up the track while he had his hands up.   Then got approached by the attendant after they got back to the loading platform. He was very confused as to why they thought he had one. He even started opening his bag to show he didnt own one, but they just shrugged it off and went back to work.  As a constant disneyland visitor this concerns me that the selfie users are ruining the entire experience for everyone. Even when a stick isn't involved. It's putting the cast and crew on edge."

It's those past the merge point of the queue (on attractions with FP), those who were grouped and about to board, and those who were already on."

Self stick hits a curb or a rock edge and smacks the stick off from the owner's hand so fast that the stick flies out and and takes out someone's eye, breaks their nose or injures a kid in the head which also made lead to a lawsuit.   Obviously, there are many scenarios but I just wanted to point out that the last thing cast member want is for the ride to malfunction or cause serious damage to the electronics of the rides aside from safety.

Disneyland,36wb94,Ampage86,-8,Sat May 30 20:17:43 2015 UTC,I don't disagree.   I'm talking about people calling for an outright parkwide ban.   Example: the same case could be made against having cameras at all (for the same safety reason you cited)   I haven't seen anyone calling for a parkwide camera ban.
Disneyland,36wb94,morla74,4,Tue Jun 9 22:27:02 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way, you pay a lot of money to go to Disneyland/World, you're enjoying a nice show and someone is holding up a selfie stick and obstructing the view. Sure, you can ask them to put it down and most likely they will. But you had to take the time to take away from the show to ask that of them. And not everyone is comfortable with any type of confrontation. Plus if more than 10 people are holding them up during a firework show, it's distracting to a lot of people. You would be viewing a sea of glowing screens (even higher in the air than they already are) It's also an obstruction for general walking. It's an extension of your space by 2-3 feet. So you would be taking away from space from other people walking and having them duck under to get out of the way. Although I think it's a bit of a fad, I think it would be wise for Disney to take care of it now before it causes serious problems."
Disneyland,36wb94,No_Long,6,Thu Jul 2 06:53:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is they've already posted signs not to use them on rides, but people aren't listening and doing it anyway.

It sucks for the people using them responsibly but if they are causing 1 hour ride shut downs it may be the only course of action that works.   If Disney decides to bad them property wide though it won't be because of people on reddit or any other forum posted it. It's going to be because they did a study and found that they can make more money by banning them (keeping most guests happy) than they would shutting down rides as a result of allowing them (making most guests upset).   I'm willing to bet that if they do decide to ban them it will go something like this. If you use a stick on rides you get escorted out of the park, if that doesn't keep people from doing it then they would consider banning them park wide."

I had my first scheduled orientation approximately six weeks later.  MAIN months for hiring are September, February, and May, but they do hire all year round.  I heard that right now, Guest Relations needs CMs.  Normally there's a six-month wait where you need to work at the resort, but apparently they're so short that they're hiring for that department right off the bat.

I missed a bunch of family holidays because you are always scheduled to work on holidays. And unless you plan on moving up, a regular cm is sort of like a black hole. I know too many people that are 30+ and dont want to move up or get another job because they think that they are too comfortable in their position.   They do interviews differently now. Most people now just do an interview over the phone. I got my job by going to TDA and having an interview the same day. If you do get an interview, try to be very perky and happy.

Disneyland,36vrm4,EnglishMobster,9,Sat May 23 07:04:28 2015 UTC,"So I'll give you the rundown on what happened:  Around 2 PM, Disneyland stopped admitting new guests. All guests trying to enter Disneyland got directed to DCA and told they could enter Disneyland at a later time.  Meanwhile, guests were still allowed to leave the park. Many did, after the fireworks ended. This meant that the park was basically empty, but if people started coming back in to see the second Paint the Night it would quickly overcrowd.  After the final Paint the Night show, Disneyland re-opened its gates (around 2 AM). However, because we promised DCA guests that they would be allowed into Disneyland first, we had to allow in all the guests from DCA that wanted into Disneyland proper first. After that, the gates opened to ""normal"" guests."

Glad to see from comments that they weren't letting folks in even at like midnight so I feel like I made a good call just going home when I couldn't get in at 11.
Disneyland,36vrm4,orangefreshy,3,Sat May 23 08:58:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, looking at the live feeds it really does look empty - a lot of people just shuffling to the entrance, no one entering despite the reported long lines. Both parks look really empty at this point, actually. I really hope we can find out why they stopped letting people in once crowds dispersed. I was really counting on people leaving after fireworks (had a late night dinner res) but the reports of lines and crowds kept me away, and it really doesn't seem like they let anyone new in after that anyhow."
Disneyland,36vrm4,EnglishMobster,2,Sat May 23 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"Disneyland stopped admitting guests at 2 PM and did not allow anyone else in until after the final Paint the Night show of the day. If they had allowed people in earlier, it would have put the park at capacity again.  At 2 AM they re-opened the gates for everyone to come in, since all the major nighttime entertainment was over."

Disneyland,36vrm4,MaLaCoiD,4,Sun May 24 18:05:01 2015 UTC,What's the best way to find the status of parking lots and Gates?
Disneyland,36vrm4,manzbot,8,Sun May 24 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"As of 1:50PM, Disneyland at capacity. Too bad for people coming after work   http://imgur.com/HGiiNtw"
Disneyland,36vrm4,Techsupportvictim,3,Sun May 24 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"This is why they need an official app. Folks were still coming and trying to get in and couldn't unless they were re-entry. Well until like 7pm and then even re-entry was screwed over. Something they didn't warn folks about if they left so we got hosed for the night.   Freaking everyone in Southern California seems to have a smart phone so an app that comes from Disney that could have alerts like ""park is at capacity at this time no new arrivals will be allowed in, re-entry currently allowed."" And ""park at capacity, no entry or reentry allowed"" would have stopped folks from driving over for nothing."
Disneyland,36vrm4,manzbot,2,Sat May 23 18:07:28 2015 UTC,They were keeping everyone updated on Twitter. That's where i was getting most of the information. It's easier than trying to maintain an app.
Disneyland,36vrm4,Techsupportvictim,2,Sat May 23 09:07:31 2015 UTC,"But not everyone uses Twitter or would think to go there to look if they don't typically use it. And the app could be populated by including that feed so it's not like they would have to do double work.   Folks with smart phones are used to the notion of 'there's an app for that' and if it was built out with park maps, show times etc it would be highly useful and would be used. So having it provide folks with that warning so they don't drive down for naught, even if just by an included Twitter feed, would have been invaluable. Same for those of us in the park that left because we weren't warned that not even re-entry would get back in"
Disneyland,36vrm4,manzbot,2,Sat May 23 11:09:54 2015 UTC,"If they integrated twitter into the app, that would be great. At some point Disney did have an app but they got rid of it. It wasn't all that great. So hopefully they are working on it. An app wouldn't hurt."
Disneyland,36vrm4,Techsupportvictim,0,Fri May 22 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"They have an official iPad app but it's basically just photos of the park. No maps. No info.   There is so much they could do but they just haven't. Especially at Disneyland. They treat the park like its the bastard stepchild when it was the original park. Funny thing is that typically when doing new tech folks start smaller. So it would have been more typical to launch an info app, fast pass plus etc at DLR and then once the basic bugs were out they could move it to WDW on a small scale and expand it out. Not go big and then have it blow up in their faces"

Disneyland,36vrm4,Techsupportvictim,0,Fri May 22 15:46:25 2015 UTC,I tried to go into Disneyland at 7:30 and they aren't even letting folks past security check. No entry or reentry. When I asked if they were going to allow reentry later they just kept repeating the park was closed for entry. So I'm stuck at DCA waiting to see if maybe folks clear out at after the fireworks. If they do I'm finding a seat and waiting for the parade at 1am. If they don't I'll have to decide if it's worth risking they won't let anyone in at midnight. Cause if they don't I'm stick at DCA for six hour cause the last bus will have run so I'll have no ride home
Disneyland,36vrm4,Techsupportvictim,3,Fri May 22 16:28:21 2015 UTC,It's busy. I did Matterhorn on single rider at 7am send it took 45 mins. Even on the busiest day I've never been more than 10 mins SR

I had some of the Pixar shorts on my iPad cause I watch them on the bus ride down to get me in the mood. I was at the World of Color right when seating started and ended up next to a family with two little boys. They were about five and no surprise they weren't real happy about having to sit for an hour before the show.   So I pulled out my iPad which was in my bag charging (yeah for battery packs), propped it up and decided to have a little film festival while we waited. Their favorite was Jack Jack Attack"

It was just as good as I thought it would be.  However those seats get :p it was literally just a walk in.  Disneyland didn't open back up until 2:20 am so the park was fairly empty,  the downside was that by the time we got out everything was closed :("

It didn't feel like a show, it felt like a commercial. It had sweet moments, like how it was dedicated to Walt. But most of it was just so bland. Best part was the Star Wars segment because it felt like the old show. NPH's narration really slowed it down. How long are they going to be keeping it?"

Sad part is that they didn't say anything when I left Disneyland the last time, but from talking with folks they knew even then that the gates in where closed. Had they said something I wouldn't have left DL"

We are thinking of heading in at 2am or even 4am but maybe it's not worth the effort.   To echo your sentiment, I wish they had given us a heads up about re-entry. We would have toughed it out just to stay and catch the parade and fireworks had we known.

Disneyland,36vrm4,babbetteateoatmeal,-2,Fri May 22 22:24:26 2015 UTC,So after the parade and just in time to stand in a long ass line and get cut off cause the ride shuts down at 5am to clear the park for the night.  Glad I left. Still pissed that the staff at the exit gates didn't warn me that they had cut off re-entry with no change in site. And I'm going to find a way to give  Disney that feedback. I went in and praised the patient staff that put up with getting yelled at when the bag checks were held for almost an hour at 3:30ish so it really stings that the hand stamp crew was just stamping away at 7 without a warning that it was likely pointless cause the park was basically shut down
Disneyland,36vrm4,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 22 22:28:52 2015 UTC,Disney won't care about your feedback. They know tons of people were upset about the no re-entry. But what are they supposed to do? Allow a stampede of people during the shows?

Disneyland,36ucg2,Shatteredreality,4,Fri May 22 14:04:50 2015 UTC,My personal favorite is the Haunted Mansion.   <Spoilers if you don't want the illusion broken>  The stretching room takes you underground and then you walk down the hallway with the changing paintings/the statues that follow you. As you walk down that hallway towards the loading platform you are actually going out of the mansion facade and under the railroad tracks to the show building you go on the attraction and then take the moving walk way back up into NoS as if you were in the building the whole time.   <End Magic Explanation>

In fact, the entire promenade between DCA and Disneyland is 100% full of people, and everyone one is a return visitor from today.  This is a text I sent to my friend at 3:30pm. Hope that helps your decision. :)"

Disneyland,36uaye,thatcaveman,4,Fri May 22 04:27:20 2015 UTC,How was it?
Disneyland,36uaye,therealmikeyj,8,Fri May 22 09:35:26 2015 UTC,It was pretty good! I liked it because I haven't seen such an original movie in a while with all the reboots and sequels we've been having lately.
Disneyland,36uaye,TalithaRabboni,2,Fri May 22 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"My theater (Regal Cinemas) gave me a pin because I have a rewards club card. Sadly, it did not transport me anywhere.  I really liked the movie, though I was under the impression Walt Disney himself played a bigger role. Regardless, it was a lot of fun. I love Hugh Laurie (there also wasn't nearly enough of him), and the two ladies (Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy) were wonderful. I can't wait to see it again."
Disneyland,36uaye,MissSamioni,4,Sat May 23 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"I loved it. I was worried it would feel like too much of an action movie and idk somehow less Disney. I was very surprised. Loved it, loved the message. Even cried at one point."
Disneyland,36uaye,TheLetter10,3,Fri May 22 10:19:25 2015 UTC,"Saw a screening of the film.  No spoilers but if you're familiar with Damon Lindeof's writing (Lost, Prometheus, World War Z, Star Trek Into Darkness) lower your standards for the final act of the film."
Disneyland,36s1dc,PiperJane,30,Thu May 21 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"And sadly like a lot of other rules the park has, it's just as ignored. It's a shame really."
Disneyland,36s1dc,justVinnyZee,29,Thu May 21 20:09:10 2015 UTC,"I hope they shame riders who use selfie sticks.  Ride shuts down CM: You in Row 11 Seat 2, put the selfie stick away!"
Disneyland,36s1dc,dontstandinfire_,27,Thu May 21 20:16:36 2015 UTC,"they shame themselves by using them, but that would be pretty nice to see as well"
Disneyland,36s1dc,ccampbellsos,16,Thu May 21 20:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see something more Iike stop the ride, send someone to go and tell the person to get out and kick them off the ride. They refuse, they get kicked out of the park for the rest of the day.   It's a safety issue. If I get hurt cause some jackass insists on using his selfie stick on a ride, I'll be very put out."
Disneyland,36s1dc,Techsupportvictim,8,Thu May 21 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yep! That's exactly what we do, and exactly why we do it. It varies from attraction to attraction, of course. Some are easier to shut down than others."
Disneyland,36s1dc,EnglishMobster,4,Thu May 21 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"You and me both, people don't seem to care either way. When I was on splash mountain,they went on the PA at least four times and still the stick stood out."
Disneyland,36s1dc,justVinnyZee,15,Thu May 21 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"If they irritate the CMs enough, they can, and will, call security to meet the selfie offendees at the exit point and have them give either a stern talking to or escort them out of the park. When it comes to safety, Disney doesn't kid around. Have faith in that there will be many selfie stick security shaming in the future."
Disneyland,36s1dc,stormeegedon,2,Thu May 21 21:18:47 2015 UTC,I've seen the golden zephyr stop early cause someone wouldn't put their selfie stick away after being asked to over intercom.  I think mermaid also shuts down from it cause of sensors that are supposed to check fr guests attempting to grab onto animatronics
Disneyland,36s1dc,sentimentalpirate,27,Fri May 22 05:33:48 2015 UTC,Now hopefully they can ban people using tablets as cameras throughout entire rides or shows...
Disneyland,36s1dc,VersaceTupperware,4,Thu May 21 22:24:33 2015 UTC,Like seriously my phone has a way better camera than my tablet. Why even use it? Doesn't make any sense. Also I would never bring my tablet into the parks. Totally unnecessary.
Disneyland,36s1dc,centracing,17,Thu May 21 23:27:17 2015 UTC,Please don't use your phone either.... anything with a lit screen is a huge distraction and annoyance in anything other than bright sunlight.
Disneyland,36s1dc,SnarkMasterRay,2,Thu May 21 23:33:31 2015 UTC,"I guess I was more referring to taking pictures and stuff. I kinda block them all out now anyways, they don't really bother me."
Disneyland,36s1dc,centracing,12,Thu May 21 23:39:47 2015 UTC,I had to watch world of color through an iPad because some lady was holding it up in the only space I could see above people's heads.
Disneyland,36s1dc,_treebeard,17,Fri May 22 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"If you had a selfie stick, you could have used it to pop that ipad right out of her hands anonymously."
Disneyland,36s1dc,Fusionbomb,16,Fri May 22 00:29:42 2015 UTC,My go-to is to sing along with all the songs REALLY LOUDLY or curse a whole bunch and talk about inappropriate stuff so the video picks it up and is unusable.
Disneyland,36s1dc,foreverburning,2,Fri May 22 01:35:53 2015 UTC,I'll have to try this
Disneyland,36s1dc,VersaceTupperware,2,Fri May 22 21:27:44 2015 UTC,I just talk really loudly about how nice it would be if I could SEE THE FUCKING SHOW.
Disneyland,36s1dc,bubblesugarsocks,11,Sat May 23 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"I would have asked her to put it down, seeing as how there are many professional videos of it online, so she didn't need her tablet. If she refused, I would have asked someone to hold my spot while I went to get a cast member.   The parks are about experiencing things in person, not on a screen. It's one thing to take photos and videos with family and friends having fun in the park when it's appropriate. However, blocking someone else's view for an entire show in order to record it is beyond rude!"
Disneyland,36s1dc,MoonChild02,3,Fri May 22 00:36:45 2015 UTC,Bigger screen = seeing the picture better therefore they think it's a better quality picture even though most tablets have shittier cameras than cellphones.
Disneyland,36s1dc,eneka,1 point,Fri May 22 18:31:01 2015 UTC,True.
Disneyland,36s1dc,centracing,50,Fri May 22 22:46:54 2015 UTC,I saw this on the front page and thought it was relevant for this conversation.  https://i.imgur.com/2EBFGzO.gifv
Disneyland,36s1dc,iSkelly87,19,Thu May 21 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"Hi there, Tower of Terror CM here!  We (as Attractions CMs) have been instructed to treat a selfie stick like it's an appendage.  I'm sure you've heard the familiar spiel ""Keep hands, arms, legs, and feet inside the vehicle/train/boat/ect"", which now also applies to selfie sticks.  If you think about holding that selfie stick outside a vehicle, it could very well be lost-- which not only loses that very expensive piece of equipment you put on the end, but could very well lodge it in an even MORE expensive piece of machinery.  In addition-- if you hold it over someone else (say you're holding it up over the row in front of you), think of the caridinal rule of Tower in particular-- whatever comes up, must come DOWN... and probably right on top of someone else's head.  When you hear the spiel ""hold onto all loose articles"", selfie sticks are included.  You're not keeping it close to your person, which makes it liable for harming someone else or breaking equipment that isn't yours, even if you never intended to.  Hope that gives you some insight into why this ruling was made.  And that's just all our cast members have gathered!  ... all we ask is that (guests) don't be silly/stupid and think they can get away with it once you're away from the loading dock.  We're always watching, Wasowski.  Aaaaaaaaalwaaaaaaays watchiiiiiiiiing."

Disneyland,36s1dc,PapaFranzBoas,1 point,Fri May 22 04:41:31 2015 UTC,"I don't mind them for that because it's easier to look around a stick holding up a phone than an entire torso and arm stretching to hold up a phone. The type of person who is going to record the fireworks is going to record the fireworks regardless, and doesn't care about your view. Better a selfie stick than a fucking ipad."

Disneyland,36s1dc,doktortaru,5,Thu May 21 21:20:14 2015 UTC,"I couldn't help but laugh at this... As someone who has been clocked in the head with phones on sticks more than once, I am glad to know they'll be around a lot less."
Disneyland,36s1dc,vanillavanille,6,Thu May 21 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"Me in line at Space Mountain: Hey look, they have a sign that says ""no selfie sticks"" who would even do that? Cast member: You have NO idea..."
Disneyland,36s1dc,BionicSparrow,8,Fri May 22 04:54:27 2015 UTC,People who have never seen Space Mountain with the lights on I guess.  I worry about sticking my hands up in there. And Rock'n'rollercoaster. I know its all safe even for the tallest people but it looks so confined!
Disneyland,36s1dc,reddit_somewhere,5,Fri May 22 06:25:57 2015 UTC,When I was in the park I used a gopro on a small handle tied to my wrist at all times. It honestly didn't stick out more than six inches from my hand when holding it. I wonder if people thought I was a douche bag for using that 8(.
Disneyland,36s1dc,xDUDERx,7,Thu May 21 23:07:16 2015 UTC,GoPros are a lot less obtrusive and noticeable. I put electrician's tape over my blinking red lights so they don't grab attention but otherwise unless you hold it up or out people aren't going to notice.
Disneyland,36s1dc,SnarkMasterRay,4,Thu May 21 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"That's what I did last time too. Just don't shove it in anyones face I guess lol. I'm going to use the head strap from now on, Easier to use and it doesn't get in anyones way."
Disneyland,36s1dc,centracing,10,Thu May 21 23:25:53 2015 UTC,Is this just on the ride or in general? Selfie sticks can be useful for pics but I definitely understand it being a safety issue on the ride. Hopefully it's just no selfie stick use on the ride.
Disneyland,36s1dc,RabidMonkeyOnCrack,7,Thu May 21 21:41:33 2015 UTC,You are correct. Selfie sticks are allowed the parks but are not to be used on rides
Disneyland,36s1dc,celosia89,1 point,Thu May 21 22:14:56 2015 UTC,Probably people losing their phones on rides and getting pissed at Disney.
Disneyland,36s1dc,Golden-Fox,14,Thu May 21 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"It's a safety issue, same as why you keep your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the vehicle at all times. Those sticks can cause damage to the ride and injure other riders."
Disneyland,36s1dc,TalithaRabboni,2,Thu May 21 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"I believe if someone does not listen to ANY park rule, but especially the flash photography/ selfie stick rule, that we as good citizens need to help CMS. And by that I mean, I present the following excellent ideas, to be used AFTER we ask nicely and they do not listen: 1) Grab the selfie stick out of their hand and refuse to give it back until it is agreed it must be put away (repeat if needed, also, break if needed) 2) Do the same thing with cameras 3) Literally escort people out by dragging them to the gate.  If only we could really do these things, it would be a much happier place. I know I'm not the only one wanting to see 2 large men (or a group of people in general), just dragging some person who won't listen out of the park."
Disneyland,36s1dc,hillpritch1,3,Mon May 25 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"I hate those things when I see them. Not so much when they're actually being used for selfies, but when they walk around with it up in the air and I can't see in front of me. Or when I'm just lingering in their shot for 30 seconds or more.  Good riddance. :)"
Disneyland,36s1dc,S_K1NG,1 point,Thu May 21 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"Haven't been to Disneyland in a while, what's the deal with selfie sticks?"
Disneyland,36s1dc,Han_Doble,-2,Fri May 22 17:38:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be caught dead with a selfie/narcissist stick. Hopefully this is just a temporary fad...
Disneyland,36s1dc,gonzorizzo,12,Thu May 21 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"I'm actually coming around to the idea of them. I hate the term ""selfie stick"". But it's the same idea as having someone take your picture in front of something, like when travelling, but with it you don't have to worry about someone running off with your camera/phone, or finding someone to do it that doesn't suck at taking pictures. People that walk around with it up all the time suck. But I think they do have their place in some situations."
Disneyland,36s1dc,HeaviestEyelidsEver,5,Fri May 22 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you're not physically handing your phone too another person. Just a consideration sometimes."
Disneyland,36s1dc,HeaviestEyelidsEver,3,Fri May 22 00:21:22 2015 UTC,I can smack them with the stick.
Disneyland,36s1dc,epotosi,2,Fri May 22 01:21:04 2015 UTC,"Have you ever put your phone in a selfie stick? They are REALLY stuck in there. Not that you couldn't still grab it out of there, but it would be more likely that the stick would come with it. At least in the case of mine... That's why I barely ever use it, actually, it's too annoying to screw it in and out."
Disneyland,36s1dc,bubblesugarsocks,1 point,Fri May 22 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"It will take a bit to get enforcement and shaming down right, but they were able to do it with smoking in the park, selfie sticks should be a cinch compared to that."
Disneyland,36s1dc,ochaos,2,Sat May 23 23:57:25 2015 UTC,dont people still smoke?
Disneyland,36s1dc,staircar,1 point,Fri May 22 03:22:10 2015 UTC,Only in the designated areas.  Back in the day people would smoke while in lines.  Ugh.
Disneyland,36s1dc,ochaos,1 point,Wed May 27 04:45:22 2015 UTC,"YIKES! Really? I still find it unbelievable at the number of smoking areas/they even allow smoking at all in the parks. I guess they figure, if they don't give people a place to do it, they are just going to do it else where."
Disneyland,36s1dc,staircar,-6,Wed May 27 05:10:14 2015 UTC,I assume this is for the big thunder mountain ride. It's sad they have to be told what rides allow it and which don't. But I do see someone using it and hitting the rocks or overpass and breaking it with pieces flying into the faces of the kids behind them. More open rides like Small World should allow it.
Disneyland,36s1dc,MegamanDS,11,Wed May 27 05:17:02 2015 UTC,More open rides like Small World should allow it.   Disagree. Cameras or devices with lit screens or flashes should be banned as a distraction. Even regular cameras I've seen people raise up to get a clear shot and thus make things worse for the people behind them.
Disneyland,36s1dc,SnarkMasterRay,3,Thu May 21 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase that:  Rides like small world wouldn't have signs due to danger factor. I agree though, all cameras on all rides shouldn't be allowed. I also think rides like Small world and Pirates shouldn't allow loud talking either. Ruins the atmosphere for others. I have had families and groups of teenagers gabbing the whole ride"
Disneyland,36s1dc,MegamanDS,2,Thu May 21 23:39:00 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's just on all rides. How they enforce it might be different on the slow rides though.
Disneyland,36s1dc,centracing,2,Fri May 22 00:07:48 2015 UTC,"I saw the sign on a bunch of other rides as well, and cast members have been told to disallow them on all rides. Space Mountain has a sign at the beginning of its line."
Disneyland,36s1dc,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Thu May 21 23:26:19 2015 UTC,"Selfie sticks are banned on all rides. It's true that on Small World you aren't moving that fast, but Disney doesn't want people trying to poke things with a 3-foot-long stick. It's easier to ban it on all rides than to say ""Well, it's okay sometimes."" If it continues, selfie sticks may get banned, period -- I believe Tokyo had to take that approach."
Disneyland,36s1dc,EnglishMobster,-2,Fri May 22 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"Yup! Snapping off in the tunnel, pieces everywhere, if your mouth is open behind them, you could get a fragment and choke to death. I mean that's dark but it can happen."
Disneyland,36wb54,chompskey,5,Fri May 22 17:30:35 2015 UTC,They usually switch Sophia and doc every half hour or so. Same location so just gotta keep an eye out. My daughter is also a big doc fan!
Disneyland,36wb54,Firehawksmom,2,Fri May 22 19:08:56 2015 UTC,Excellent.  Thank you so much!
Disneyland,36wb54,ristatron,2,Fri May 22 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"They generally rotate. We were just there last week. There was always Sophia, Doc, or Jake out near the animation area."

I hope this doesn't mean they're trying to phase out Vinylmation.  In any case, you could always head over to /r/vinylmation or Chasing Vinylmation to trade or sell Vinylmation outside the parks. Hope that helped somewhat.  Edit: Upon a little google searching it looks like the trading boxes are being phased out :( Disappointing but I hope this doesn't mean it's an end to Vinylmation as a whole."
Disneyland,36wb54,danimaroo,1 point,Fri May 22 21:07:13 2015 UTC,Vinylmation is sold at Off The Page and maybe the Tower still.

BUT you could check out the biggest trading group that I know of on Facebook that's very, very active, called ""Vinylmation Exchange"". I've been a part of it for 3 years now and have made most of my trades through there. It's great for getting things you really want, too, and most people are super kind.  Otherwise, only place you can trade in-person nowadays are Disney Stores. :/"

Disneyland,36u8n0,TalithaRabboni,2,Fri May 22 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"It's actually a term that's been used for quite a while at Disneyland. The Disneyland Hotel has a kiss goodnight in every room (the headboards), and I believe that the suites in DLH and the Grand Californian have them too. The Dream Suite also has effects similar but more extravagant in every room, if I'm not mistaken."
Disneyland,36u8n0,thatlonelyasianguy,2,Fri May 22 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"I know about those, but I was thinking more of the park. WDW has one last little light show on the castle and a voice comes on the PA thanking everyone for coming. The last time I was in Disneyland, I don't think I heard anything apart from ""Thanks for coming. The stores on Main Street will be open for another hour."" I know they used to have this; I can't believe they ever got rid of it."
Disneyland,36u8n0,TalithaRabboni,3,Fri May 22 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the second castle view (best for actually seeing the fireworks) was pretty laggy for me...

It seems like the new World of Color would fit in better at Disneyland, and these new fireworks would fit in better at DCA."
Disneyland,36u8n0,omnomnam,3,Fri May 22 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"That was one of the most amazing things I've seen in a while, even with the crappy stream quality. Hopefully views from the various projection locations will pop up in the next few days!"
Disneyland,36u8n0,redbeardgecko,2,Fri May 22 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm still watching the stream to keep me company, and they're bringing all the floats back to Small World via Main Street now.  Is this normal procedure once the park closes? I always imagined they had a way to go all the way back while sneaking backstage, but I guess not."
Disneyland,36u8n0,redbeardgecko,2,Fri May 22 05:20:44 2015 UTC,"They can't sneak backstage in Disneyland. There's no backstage area between the Autopia and Harbor Blvd. The only way back is through the parade route. If you pay close attention during the day, both day parades go in different directions to accomplish the same thing."
Disneyland,36u8n0,EagleEyeInTheSky,3,Fri May 22 06:10:29 2015 UTC,"There is a two lane road between the edge of Tomorrowland and Harbor Blvd.  However, there is not a way for a parade float to get back there, let alone fit under the monorail tracks/between the monorail pylons."
Disneyland,36u8n0,TaonasSagara,2,Fri May 22 08:49:29 2015 UTC,That's how the soundsational parade did it so I'd assume the same for Paint the Night if there are two shows. Otherwise they likely reset it at night after closing by reversing down the path.
Disneyland,36u8n0,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Sat May 23 03:32:45 2015 UTC,There's usually two parade shows a day so the parade usually starts at Small World the first time and then return back there with the second showing. But since there was only one showing last night they needed to return them back for today.
Disneyland,36u8n0,Mimi0726,3,Fri May 22 10:36:03 2015 UTC,"I actually loved Disneyland Forever more than WOC:C because WOC felt more like a documentary than a show and tell. And the music wasn't as good as Disneyland Forever, which was gorgeous and I need to legally download that soundtrack as soon as it's available.   Edit: Also, do you guys think the parade and fireworks will last as long as the fireworks and parades did for the 50th ? Those lasted until last year."
Disneyland,36u8n0,disneywizard,1 point,Fri May 22 15:48:03 2015 UTC,I think they probably will last about a year. It makes sense.

Disneyland,36u8n0,blackseat,2,Fri May 22 05:22:00 2015 UTC,"Loved being able to see (a teaser of) the parade and projections. I watched with my mom and sisters, and for most of the fireworks show, we were joking that we would like the fireworks show better if there were no fireworks.

Disneyland,36uvbl,MeniBike,6,Fri May 22 16:31:09 2015 UTC,It's a grad night day meaning that at night DCA opens to a private event for graduating HS students from SoCal.   Usually some of the students come earlier in the day and they tend to have a pretty bad reputation for being disrespectful (probably a small percentage of the total number of students but they give the whole group a bad rap).   As a result some people just stay away from the park on those days to avoid the influx of grads.

Disneyland,36uvbl,MeniBike,3,Fri May 22 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"I went on a grad night last year, it was one of the reasons I didn't get to ride Indiana Jones.  Full disclosure I went with my (at the time) 88 year old grandma and my mom so my big rides I'd do solo were spread out throughout the trip and I had saved Indy for the end, planning on doing the single rider line.  This was late afternoon within a few hours of grad night starting, and Indy had between a 60-90 min wait.  They closed the single rider line because a large group of grads showed up in a short period of time and all went single rider.  So just be aware it'll be a bit more crowded, with groups that may even just be hanging out in an area, and you might run into randomness like that which you likely would not experience on a ""normal"" day at the park."

Disneyland,36uncm,BettyVonBlack,2,Fri May 22 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"I have so many great memories from Disneyland. One of my favorite memories was going to the Halloween party that Disneyland had in the 90's. It was a separate ticket event (like they are now), and was so incredibly fun. Everybody dressed up, and when you entered the park you were given a bag to trick or treat with. Some bags had a special ticket in it, which meant you were picked to be in the costume cavalcade parade.  There was so many places to trick or treat, in front of almost every ride. They gave out candy, buttons, and little treats.  There were live characters in certain rides. In all the fantasyland rides you could find characters greeting you as you went by. There was also live pirates in the Pirates of the Caribbean, waiting to scare you in the dark, and trying to get the keys from the dog. There was also live ghosts in the Haunted Mansion.  There was characters out ALL OVER the park. Dick Tracy and the bad guys were roaming around Fantasyland, along with Merlin, and green army men. C3PO and R2D2 were in front of Star Tours. There was werewolves hiding along the trail by Big Thunder Mountain. They were carving live huge pumpkins on Main Street.  It was so fun, and a little more ""spooky"" than the Halloween party is now. Man, Disneyland in the 80's - 90's was tops."

Disneyland,36svgv,thatcaveman,8,Thu May 21 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"LA Times reporting that Magic Bands will not be coming to Disneyland:   http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-star-wars-coming-to-disneyland-but-no-magic-bands-20150521-story.html  ""She said the wristband won't work with Disneyland's guest demographics. Many visitors are local residents who do not stay for long periods at the nearby hotels, where the bands would be used heavily."""
Disneyland,36svgv,fernker,1 point,Fri May 22 17:50:40 2015 UTC,This makes zero sense to me.   As a local AP the wristband sounds awesome! I'd use all the features of it heavily other than the room key feature (especially if they figured out a way to allow you to store payment info on it without being a hotel guest).   FP+ on the other had is something that (if implemented the same as WDW) won't work with Disneyland's demographics. As everyone seems to point out APs (who make up a large part of the demo) don't want to have to pre-plan since a lot of people go after work or on a whim.   FP+ is totally doable with very minor upgrades since it does not require Magic Bands to work (just expand the DAS tech to the entire FP system and remove paper FPs and it's a low tech version of what WDW has. All they need to do is keep track of your ticket ID from the time of purchase and enable reservations. The only tech upgrades needed would be kiosks to change/add reservations.
Disneyland,36svgv,Shatteredreality,2,Fri May 22 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"They could make it work with tweaks to the current system in WDW, but the project itself went WAY over budget leading to the delay of the Star Wars Land. I'm not so sure they'd want to spend that kind of money on something like that again. This could be the reason why they are holding out, so they can finish all of the 60th anniversary stuff and finish SW land.  I myself loved the system myself when I went. The only problem I had was that I sometimes waited in unusually long lines for rides that I didn't have to since everyone had fastpasses. Probably more than they usually give out. Most fastpasses were gone mid-day."
Disneyland,36svgv,Techsupportvictim,4,Fri May 22 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"They should be able to limit fast passes. It's really not that different than the tech a movie theatre uses. But instead of seats in a screen for a showing it's fast pass tickets for a ride during a time block.   They could even set up system so you can only get them day of, after your pass/ticket has been scanned into park and can only have so many at a time. Say three. Even limit it to one pass per ride.   So I scan into Disneyland with my ecard via a barcode in a Disneyland app. I can then sign up for fast passes for splash mountain, star tours and big thunder while having my coffee. But I can't add haunted mansion until I use whichever of the three was my first block. And I can't do a second one of them to ride later in the day (unless I miss the first time). And I can't get any for DCA until I enter that park. Shows excluded"
Disneyland,36svgv,Techsupportvictim,0,Sat May 23 00:38:51 2015 UTC,"Make it work with smart phones. NFC, QR/bar code, etc. there are 5 year olds in the LA area with their own smart phones. For folks that don't have a smart phone just use a plastic card."
Disneyland,36svgv,Shatteredreality,2,Sat May 23 00:33:15 2015 UTC,All I was getting at is that a large reason a lot of people speculate that DLR won't get FP+/MagicBands is that it would cost to much to upgrade the infrastructure in the park.  FP+ =/= MagicBands/MagicCards. The park already has 90% of the tech needed to implement FP+ without changing ticket design (they can even keep the paper tickets). All they need to do it track your ticket ID so they can assign return times to it before you arrive in the park and then upgrade the FP kiosks with touch screens and a barcode reader.   If they decide to go NFC it's going to be a huge cost and completely removes the reason not to use MagicBands.
Disneyland,36svgv,Techsupportvictim,2,Sat May 23 01:21:52 2015 UTC,So use bar codes. That's what they have on the cards anyway. Starbucks etc have smart phone apps that can produce a bar or QR code. And a lot of their scanners are already handheld anyway
Disneyland,36svgv,Shatteredreality,5,Sat May 23 03:30:03 2015 UTC,"Saw this on MiceChat yesterday...  No sources listed and they are the only people reporting it (did some google-fu that came back empty).   Right now I consider this to be nothing more then click-bait unless there is some supporting evidence (Even a line like ""A Cast-Member familiar with the project that requested to be left anonymous"" would give this a little bit of legitimacy). Right now it's a 100% unsubstantiated rumor being run by this one site.  I wouldn't put much stock in it but I'll gladly change my stance when some sources are provided."

Disneyland,36svgv,Techsupportvictim,3,Fri May 22 16:24:46 2015 UTC,Honestly I wan't the part that Tom Staggs has said is NOT coming to DL.   In my perfect world we would get (optional) magic bands but a very similar FP system to the one we have today. Basically you go to the Kiosk scan your RFID enabled pass (card or band) and it load a return time with no paper ticket to keep track of. There should be an app that you can link to your pass that lets you look up return times (or kiosks you can scan at to check what your current return time is if you forget).
Disneyland,36svgv,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 22 16:38:53 2015 UTC,"I loved it when I went to WDW last year. It was great to not have to fumble through a million fastpasses like I do with a decent amount of people. The only thing they shouldn't bring to Disneyland is the capability to RSVP fastpasses. With the amount of locals we get, all the FP's would be gone by mid-day and the lines will get longer."

If you're talking about the newer paintbrush, then yes it does work with Paint the Night - which is very awesome. I'm not sure if it works with every float. I'm assuming it is...   Guests that I've showed and sold the product to have come back and told me just how cool it is.   Unfortunately I don't own my own, so outside of the one that I get to play with while working, I don't have a lot of experience with it.   Pre-parade color wars are really fun though...

Disneyland,36s5ay,notplanningatripshh,4,Thu May 21 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"I've seen FP run out for ToT because everyone likes to ride it at night (it is indeed more fun at night imo), so last might not work depending on how late ""last"" is.  Also, GRR gets you pretty wet so riding it late at night when it's colder might not be the smartest idea."
Disneyland,36s5ay,booboothechicken,3,Thu May 21 20:09:47 2015 UTC,Just something about those elevator doors opening up to a bright and sunny California day that kind of kills the mood...  At least in Florida it rains enough that you can get a gloomy grey sky more often than not. Theirs is just a little more magical in general though.
Disneyland,36s5ay,ChocoTacoz,3,Fri May 22 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"Grizzly River Run is AWESOME but holy crap it can you get wet.  I'm talking SOAKED.  I think you should ride it before California Screamin' and then use the coaster to dry off.  If you go on Grizzly at night, you and your socks will regret it"
Disneyland,36s5ay,collegemathchef,3,Fri May 22 05:36:05 2015 UTC,lol good idea!  a water ride killed my phone once. I'll be extra prepared this time.
Disneyland,36s5ay,waterfox17,3,Fri May 22 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"Hi there, Tower CM here!  The issue we've been seeing lately with Fastpasses going out quickly is when we've had downtimes.  Obviously, if we're at limited capacity, there are less fastpasses total in circulation, and ""sell out"" more quickly with a heightened wait time.  We do, however, regularly see a decline in the line for the last hour to half hour of the night.  Hitting it in the last hour that the park is open is generally a good idea.  (Even if we have a longer posted wait time at park closing, know that the time is adjusted to take Fastpass into account, and the Fastpass line closes with the park.  This generally makes our line a few minutes faster than posted at park closing.)"
Disneyland,36s5ay,thatcaveman,2,Fri May 22 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"Got it! the first time i did ToT was at WDW and there was no line at that time, so my first impression of it was pretty relaxed(not a good frame of reference, I know...). I'll definitely bump it up on the list! I'll try to be on top of my FP game so ""last"" could be as late as possible. =P   and good point about GRR! thank you!! =)"
Disneyland,36s5ay,thatcaveman,5,Thu May 21 20:40:47 2015 UTC,"California Adventure: I would put Radiator Springs racers as #1 as people line up for that even before rope drop, and then ride TSMM second as that line gets long pretty fast. After that, the Fastpasses will still be available for WoC. You wouldn't really need a fastpass for CA Screamin' as that ride usually has short wait times.  Disneyland: I would put the top two rides with Fastpasses with either Indy or Space Mountain with Splash Mountain as #3. Both Indy and SM go pretty fast. Star Tours isn't as bad as those depending on how busy it is. Soarin' is in California adventure so that wouldnt apply here. Thunder Mountain isn't usually too bad, so I would put that near the bottom of the list."
Disneyland,36s5ay,sentimentalpirate,1 point,Thu May 21 20:03:38 2015 UTC,Thank you! I tried to look for info on how popular Star Tours might be but couldn't find anything so I assumed it's space mountain tier (since it's a popular franchise in a popular land). It's not one of my top rides but i would like to do it eventually (same goes for thunder mountain).  and oops about Soarin'.
Disneyland,36s5ay,collegemathchef,3,Thu May 21 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"No problem! Yeah, I would use star tours as a ride that you would fill in between fast passes depending on how long it is. It's weird because some days I've seen it at an hour, while others are 20 minutes. Either way, the queue in Star tours is amazing and worth staying inside to see all of the detail that went into everything.  Have fun! You'll love it!"
Disneyland,36s5ay,sentimentalpirate,2,Thu May 21 20:51:59 2015 UTC,Yup star tours has the best queue in tge whole resort imo

Disneyland,36s5ay,CydonPrax,3,Fri May 22 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"As does radiator springs racer, splash mountain, and soarin over California. I think screamin might also."
Disneyland,36s5ay,sentimentalpirate,1 point,Fri May 22 06:02:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks to both of you! I think my SO and I would be happy to spend a few minute apart to save a few hours, being on the same vehicle doesn't make a difference to the ride experience anyways. =)"
Disneyland,36s5ay,epotosi,3,Fri May 22 16:58:46 2015 UTC,DCA i would:   FP Radiator Ride Toy Story Ride Screamin FP World of Color FP Soarin' ... etc   Disneyland   FP Indy Ride Splash Ride Haunted Ride Pirates Ride Indy FP Space Mountain Ride Matterhorn etc ...
Disneyland,36s5ay,Mimi0726,2,Thu May 21 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I had the impression that WoC should be one of the first things, but I guess I was overthinking. =)"
Disneyland,36s5ay,veezy55,9,Thu May 21 20:32:42 2015 UTC,I don't think they really run out of FP for WoC. It seems rare. I'd get them after you rush for the RSR FP.
Disneyland,36s5ay,sentimentalpirate,2,Thu May 21 21:32:38 2015 UTC,Yeah but the new show will attract more people than usual.
Disneyland,36sjdt,FutureOmelet,7,Thu May 21 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"The reporter lost me after referring to DCA as Disneyland's nearby waterpark. Also, it's clear this article was rushed. I'm sure Disneyland's water use is public information."
Disneyland,36sjdt,dodgepodge,3,Thu May 21 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"I laughed at the water park reference also. I guess they were confused about that giant fake lack at  Paradise Pier, which has been only half filled for weeks"
Disneyland,36q40v,thatcaveman,7,Thu May 21 06:01:43 2015 UTC,I loved everything about how this looks and cannot wait to see it in person. I can't believe they included The Force Awakens. The Steamboat Willie segment was awesome as well.
Disneyland,36q40v,golf4miami,10,Thu May 21 15:20:38 2015 UTC,What I really liked about this version of World of Color is that it celebrated what it was rather than what it is.
Disneyland,36q40v,TalithaRabboni,9,Thu May 21 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like they lost/gave up some of their narrative momentum to spend too much time on some things and a few other things could have benefited from a little more fleshing out, but all in all I think it's a very charming show. I really appreciated how they made sure to include Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6, both of which seem to have gotten lost in the Frozen avalanche.  I also loved the inclusion of the Carthay Circle Theatre and the Partners statue."
Disneyland,36q40v,adSimba,3,Thu May 21 08:04:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't realy ever notice a narative in the old version, was there a plot to it that I didn't recognise?"
Disneyland,36q40v,TalithaRabboni,1 point,Thu May 21 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"There really wasn't one, thought I think there might have been some sort of loose thematic groupings. I remember reading about ""the color of fear,"" which I presume would include everything from the storm through to Mufasa's death. Which is then followed by the segments I'll call ""the color of look at all the cute animals to distract you from your Mufasa heartbreak"" and then ""the color of happy endings."" They're rather undefined now, but maybe they were more distinct back when the show was first being written."
Disneyland,36q40v,adSimba,1 point,Thu May 21 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"yeah, I was waiting for the scene where Bambi's mother dies after the Mufasa death scene... I just do not understand that decision at all"
Disneyland,36q40v,Techsupportvictim,2,Fri May 22 02:55:19 2015 UTC,Agreed about Wreck It Ralph and Big Hero 6. Immortals was made for that medley. And it was really awkward having all of Let It Go right in the middle like that. I also thought the Star Wars went a bit long.
Disneyland,36q40v,stacasaurusrex,2,Sat May 23 07:18:44 2015 UTC,"Someone come stop me from watching dang it! I'm a week away from going again, and I. MUST. WATCH."

Disneyland,36q40v,lastyearsthing,1 point,Fri May 22 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"During the summer after WoC's first release, they ran out of all shows around 12-1ish from what I remember. I'm hoping it'll be like that this time around as well"
Disneyland,36q40v,TalithaRabboni,1 point,Fri May 22 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"There are many great places to see WOC without needing a Fastpass. In fact, I - being short and mildly claustrophobic - prefer them as they're much less crowded. Try back by the Little Mermaid building. You're far enough back that you can see over the Fastpass crowd. The CMs can help you stay in the right places out of the walkways."

Disneyland,36qy4p,johnsorci,10,Thu May 21 18:14:40 2015 UTC,"It's not the exact song, but more of a remixed Main Street Electrical Parade version with different lyrics."
Disneyland,36qy4p,thatcaveman,3,Thu May 21 15:14:19 2015 UTC,"This. I was mixed on my feelings about having a pop song like this (yes I know it's from WIR, which I adore, but still) in the parade... until I heard the remix with MSEP and I feel a lot better about it. Really looking forward to seeing this in September!"
Disneyland,36qy4p,danimaroo,3,Thu May 21 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"When I saw it in HK, the MSEP remix was only with the tinkerbell float in the beginning. The floats after have their themed remixes, which are also really good. Everything could be different with our version, though.  [Spoiler]  I liked the Sorcerer Mickey float at the end with the EDM styled remix. The float itself was amazing."
Disneyland,36qy4p,thatcaveman,2,Thu May 21 19:14:48 2015 UTC,Yeah the HK doesn't feature the MSEP music a lot. Just a couple times at the start.

Disneyland,36qy4p,Techsupportvictim,3,Thu May 21 20:34:28 2015 UTC,So Wreck it Ralph finally gets to represent. It's kind of gross that Disneyland ignores this movie. At least Big Hero Six got some tee shirts. But heck Disney couldn't even release a Sugar Rush game or do a few shirts. Never mind having V and the girls out in the park or in the parade over at DCA (they could have out the BH6 gang there too)
Disneyland,36qy4p,TommyBaseball,6,Thu May 21 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"The DCA parade is the Pixar Play Parade, so Wreck-It Ralph wouldn't fit over there.  They did have the Fix It Felix game in the Starcade in Tomorrowland.  It is currently part of a Tomorrowland movie exhibit, but should return after that is over."
Disneyland,36qy4p,TalithaRabboni,5,Thu May 21 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"The Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6 characters cannot join the Pixar Play Parade, as they are not Pixar characters.  What's sad is that Ralph and Vanellope and Hiro and Baymax were in Disneyland, but only for such a short time. And after all the effort to make the costumes and cast the characters, the chances of seeing them again is small. (I really hoped to be able to meet Hiro and Baymax, but they were gone from the parks within a few months.)"
Disneyland,36qy4p,Techsupportvictim,-2,Thu May 21 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"Disney decided it is Pixar, they can decide it's just the Play Parade and add whomever they want."
Disneyland,36qy4p,disneywizard,2,Thu May 21 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"I know, right?   Like the only evidence Wreck it Ralph even exists is the dvd and fanart online.  We even had a dad build his daughter an exact replica of Honeylemon's purse from the movie cause Disney didn't even have that.   Disney ignoring those two movies over Frozen and having exactly no Black Widow merch at all is the biggest sins Disney has done to me in my lifetime I want fixed asap."
Disneyland,36qy4p,Jonny_Fairplay,1 point,Thu May 21 17:27:57 2015 UTC,"There was a decent amount of Wreck-It Ralph merch, but it probably wasn't popular. A lot of it ended up being dumped on clearance."
Disneyland,36qy4p,izookie,1 point,Fri May 22 05:42:17 2015 UTC,I have seen Wreck it Ralph a dozen time but that song hit me last night in the Parade. So much better than the Cantonese version I heard on the HK version (YouTube). We ended up watching Paint the Night twice last night and singing along. And now that song is playing in my head. I even had small world instrumentals playing in my ear as we waited 2.5 hours for the first parade. Owl City wins. It mixes perfectly with Baroque Hoedown (MSEP).
Disneyland,36t5p0,stacasaurusrex,9,Thu May 21 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"CM's have the ability to do this, sparingly.  Sounds like you made a good impression, and they bent over backwards for you.  Having it issued as a ""magic moment"" is something they usually don't get to do often, just because there's not a lot in circulation."
Disneyland,36t5p0,waterfox17,3,Fri May 22 18:20:20 2015 UTC,igot 2 free rides from a very nice lady who we talked with at the star tour
Disneyland,36t5p0,canslER,7,Fri May 22 17:32:01 2015 UTC,and all this time i've been paying for rides like a sucker.
Disneyland,36t5p0,arobotamongus,3,Fri May 22 20:46:54 2015 UTC,As I understand it all ride CMs can do it for their ride but they only get a limited number so they use them very carefully. They are meant to be for CS issues or a reward for something super cool like a little kid in a killer amazing costume. I've been told CMs can get into trouble if they are caught using them to help friends skip lines or as some kind of flirting stunt. Although as long as you aren't doing it all the time it would be hard to catch you so I'm sure it happens from time to time  I've gotten one once when someone insisted on using a flash to video tape pirates. Staff got on the PA like six times telling the guy to shut it off but he just refused. It's not really possible to shut down the ride and go drag him out when we got off the rest of us in the car were given a pass to jump the line later in the day to make up for it. Best part was that they handed them out with no regard to whether the guy heard/saw them apologizing for rude behavior ruining our ride.
Disneyland,36t5p0,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Sat May 23 20:14:40 2015 UTC,HA! That's kind of cool they did that. I would have accidentally bumped the guy so he'd drop his camera... KIDDING ;)
Disneyland,36t5p0,djjedi,5,Mon May 25 17:52:03 2015 UTC,One of the perks of being an AP is you can and SHOULD get to know every CM you can.  They all have passes they  can give away and most are not ride or park  specific meaning you just show up and get in the fastpass lane!

It wasn't just a little chuckle, but she was crying afterwards and as I walked away with joy you could still hear her laugh. I thought it was a very funny situation as well. This was in the Indiana Jones line."

Disneyland,36q7wd,Techsupportvictim,2,Thu May 21 13:48:43 2015 UTC,Don't count on that. Since it's a free ticket it might be exempt from that 'upgrade to a pass' move

Disneyland,36pyjk,RVierra327,1 point,Fri May 22 06:11:04 2015 UTC,"They are out daily, though I can't recall the exact times. But everyday there are 2 stormtroopers patrolling tomorrowland."
Disneyland,36pyjk,golf4miami,2,Sat May 23 07:53:04 2015 UTC,"Its possible.  When developing the ride, George Lucas originally wanted the ride to be linear to the story. Then he decided to throw that all out the window to pay tribute to the whole trilogy. Being that you see Darth Vader and the stormtroopers before you see Jar-Jar Binks and Naboo with the N-1 starfighters, the ride is not linear to the story."
Disneyland,36pw4q,Mathavian,7,Thu May 21 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"Drinks alone range anywhere from $8-15 each. If it comes in a souvenir glass and you want to keep the glass, basically just double the price of the drink"
Disneyland,36pw4q,jasonbamrad,6,Thu May 21 08:16:37 2015 UTC,Old kungaloosh is $11... only drink you'll ever need to order.
Disneyland,36pw4q,climb-via-is-stupid,3,Thu May 21 08:25:04 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer unless you really want a souvenir glass or something.
Disneyland,36pw4q,golf4miami,2,Thu May 21 15:52:12 2015 UTC,You can get any of the mugs with ANY drink as a souvenir to take home. So still the correct answer in any case.
Disneyland,36pw4q,JalenJade,5,Sun May 24 08:23:12 2015 UTC,"The Uh Oa is only $20 without the souvenir glass, it's still served in that awesome bowl - you just don't get to take it...   I caution you, they'll want someone you can say you're sharing it with, if you want to do it as a solo mission."
Disneyland,36pw4q,50shadesofgreyhat,2,Thu May 21 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"Got the Krakatoa Punch with the Souvenir Glass on Monday and it was $19.85, so yeah: $10 for a drink, $10 for a glass"
Disneyland,36pw4q,jch708,2,Thu May 21 17:11:50 2015 UTC,I got the Schweitzer Falls a few weeks ago and it only came to $5 and change. (It probably costs less because there's no alcohol in it.)

Disneyland,36oijl,crazy550,2,Wed May 20 21:55:49 2015 UTC,The park also adopted a new policy for disabled guests in 2013 because visitors were hiring people in wheelchairs to bypass the long ride lines.   Aww that must suck for legit disabled guests
Disneyland,36oijl,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Thu May 21 13:21:23 2015 UTC,Yep. The cheaters have ruined it for everyone so now the rules changed up to try to stop the cheating and it comes back on the legit folks. That's part of why they are getting sued. Although it's mostly by families with someone that has a developmental issue like autism
Disneyland,36oijl,Soulcrux,1 point,Thu May 21 14:42:38 2015 UTC,"Which, to be fair, is a very hard disability to ""prove"" in case an employee believes they are lying. So seems easier to just blanket ban special treatment"

Disneyland,36oijl,Techsupportvictim,2,Thu May 21 13:25:50 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that tomorrow will be that much worse than the typical Christmas holiday. A tad longer to get back in perhaps. I heard they are trying out a new system that is kind of like a fast pass program for re-entry/entry.  I'm aiming to be there at 6am and my first things are going to be my pin etc shopping and my three big rides -- haunted mansion, Matterhorn and Soarin. I want to get all those in by 10am if I can. Then the rest of the day will be about shows, good eats etc. I'm going to try to get fast passes for world of color etc to catch those but if I can't I won't flip out. I have all summer and a premium pass."
Disneyland,36oijl,Soulcrux,1 point,Thu May 21 14:46:24 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll be able to park hop that willy-nilly :(
Disneyland,36oijl,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 22 08:06:00 2015 UTC,"If you expect a ten minute wait to get back in, no. But I'm going to work in big blocks so an hour or so for re-entry won't bug me. Heck if it gets way packed mid day (which is typical during Christmas) I'll just wander to the AMC and try to catch a movie. I'm there all the time so like I said, not a big deal"
Disneyland,36oijl,Soulcrux,1 point,Fri May 22 10:15:03 2015 UTC,"So I was basing that off of the cast member who made that other threesd.  But according to a cast member answering questions in the ticket booth line- as long as you get a stamp from the park before the capacity limit, you can go back in without the re-entry time thing   Which makes sense- they don't scan your tickets when you LEAVE, so you've already been counted as being ""in"" the parks"
Disneyland,36oijl,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 22 12:16:13 2015 UTC,"During the holidays there is often still a weight to re enter, so I expect that today. I'm going to pop over to DCA for a bit then come back for dinner, parade etc. go back to DCA after all that for world of color late. Give myself like an hour to get back in. I can always find a way to entertain myself if it's a quick in"
Disneyland,36oijl,GingerKidd,1 point,Fri May 22 15:07:41 2015 UTC,Side question... Didn't see it in the article. How long does the 60th celebration go on for?
Disneyland,36oijl,centracing,1 point,Fri May 22 04:55:31 2015 UTC,No end date has been announced yet. They will probably end it when attendance dies down again. At least a until the new year though I'd say.
Disneyland,36oijl,GingerKidd,1 point,Fri May 22 05:38:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! Trying to plan our vacation later this year and was hoping to avoid the huge crowds. I know its always busy nowadays but just wanted to avoid the celebration crowd as much as I can.

Just make sure you eat (snacks, full meals, whatever) and drink water consistently or else your group will be grumpy the entire trip. Fastpasses are your friend, and prioritize! Don't supplement energy with energy drinks, just eat and take a few rests throughout the day. People watching is always fun."
Disneyland,36oi78,PBI325,4,Wed May 20 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"You can only renew if you currently have the Socal pass, you cannot upgrade from Socal Select at this time."
Disneyland,36oi78,ClareBear,1 point,Thu May 21 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"They offered my friend the option but they wanted her to pay the entire difference, not a prorated about between the pass prices, so it wasn't worth it.  Probably best to ask at the park, I know they can make exceptions but it probably varies what it will cost you."
Disneyland,36oi78,kristyn_bee,2,Wed May 20 22:06:19 2015 UTC,Yep. Upgrades are the full retail difference. Otherwise you could buy a limited pass then upgrade to Premium at the end for a pittance.  Should be equal to the current retail price for the pass minus the price you paid for yours.
Disneyland,36oi78,stevensokulski,1 point,Wed May 20 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Have you actually done this?  If this were true, then what's stopping anyone from just buying the SoCal Select, then immediately upgrading it to the ""renewal only"" SoCal pass?  I mean, I know it's possible to upgrade to Deluxe or Premium as I have personally done that.... but it seems like a loophole if they allow for this.  (I don't mean to sound like I'm saying ""you're wrong"", I'm legitimately curious.)"
Disneyland,36oi78,gdraper99,1 point,Thu May 21 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry! I was just commenting on the ability to upgrade from one pass to another. And the logic of it costing full price as others seemed to thing it should be prorated.  I've done it twice, going from Premium to Premier each time."
Disneyland,36oi78,stevensokulski,1 point,Thu May 21 03:01:23 2015 UTC,Cool that its even an option :) I would assume they would indeed want the full difference no matter how late in the year it is. Ill be at the park before this friend would like to upgrade so I guess I should ask a CM!
Disneyland,36nt5e,pugtasticTime,6,Wed May 20 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"I was on the College Program twice in Orlando., and I was a Campus Rep with the program for a few years too.  The details have likely changed, but I'd be happy to answer any questions on the generalities of the two programs.  I'll also say that I loved my experiences. Both internships were different, but I had a whole lot of fun each time and I would make the same choice each time if I had to do it again."

I think the college program helped get me to where I am today.   I stayed on as campus rep until I graduated in 2010. the experience helped me get a job at one of the good neighbor hotels shortly after I graduated and now I manage the entire hotel.
Disneyland,36nt5e,StandardSuite,5,Thu May 21 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"For it being a college internship, they did not work around my schedule AT ALL.   I had given them my schedule for finals and they scheduled me on a day I had finals.   I called telling them that I can't make it to training and they said if they can't find a spot for training, I was shit out of luck. But that's Disney for ya.  Fortunately, they were able to find a spot and I was able to do the CP. Other than the initial hiccup, everything went smoothly.   Since I lived close enough to commute via public transportation, I didn't have to dorm so I don't have anything to say about that.  I ended up staying at the Resort for three years after my program ended as a part-timer. They allow you to stay if your records are clean and they have openings.   This was all in 2008 so things might have changed.   Feel free to message me if you have any questions!"

Disney spent decades building up the Disneyland brand only to throw it away with the generic ""Disney Parks"" monicker.  Sure, it's cost effective to print one cup for both resorts but people have sentimental attachments to ""Disneyland,"" not ""Disney Parks.""  All it does is weaken the brand that they worked so hard to build.  I'm glad to see they're moving back to printing ""Disneyland"" on everything!"

I carry this all the time though and the most valuable item has been the ibuprofen and wetwipes.

Inside I have a small pouch or change purse with my ticket, debit card, and cash. I include a plastic bag to stick my cellphone and small pouch in during water rides. I also have my sunglasses in there. If I have room, I bring a light sweater or jacket for when the sun goes down and it gets a bit colder.   Overall, this method makes everything easy to get to and fits nicely in front of me during rides rather than a large backpack. Also more comfortable I believe than slugging around a purse on your shoulder. My dad and brother usually do just pockets but I end up holding all their stuff too big for their pockets.   I have used a side cross purse before but I prefer the backpack so I can have a jacket or room for snacks or something."

I also have a small drawstring backpack with an outside pocket for a water bottle. I can put my windbreaker in there. Also have sunscreen. Sometimes a small snack. If I know I'm going to be shopping I'll get a locker and the bag can be used to carry small things until I get back there. Like this weekend. A friend from work wants one of the captain America cookies. But I won't go buy that and then walk all the way back to put it in my locker.

It's not very much but leaves me lots of room to stuff in a light hoodie and any snacks I buy.  By the end of the day rogue napkins, caps to sprite bottles and pieces of popcorn are all floating around.

We also usually bring a charge pack with multiple ports incase our phones need juice.  I don't bring my wallet anymore and use an Incipico phone case for my ID/cards (& it fits in my girl pockets).

It's primarily used to carry sweatshirts, at hat or two for her, and it has a water bottle pocket on the side.  Now my girlfriend has recently begun bringing a ThinkGeek Bag of Holding instead of a purse, and she loves it. When we're either certain we won't need sweatshirts or certain we'll be wearing them the whole time, I think this bag is all we'll need. It has room enough for everything and has side pockets for a water bottle and posters (i.e. sketches from the Animation Academy).

I still haven't gone and watched a video of that, even though it'd be different than the Celebrate version I'll see in September.  That being said, I did watch a video of the Festival of Fantasy parade months before my trip to Disney World last year, and it didn't ruin the parade for me, so I'm not sure what I'm worried about. heh"

I would recommend lunch over dinner there.  The Napa Rose at the Grand Californian is also a great experience, best food at the resort in my humble opinion."
Disneyland,36k2et,Techsupportvictim,4,Wed May 20 06:22:16 2015 UTC,I did Blue Bayou once. Thought it was overhyped. Food isn't way better than anywhere else but you pay for the atmosphere. I actually prefer Cafe Orleans especially if you can get a table outside and people watch. CO is my fav place to get Beignets cause they serve them with vanilla creme and jam rather than doused in powdered sugar. Serving of that with a coffee is a nice pick me up (and it's like six of them so it's perfect for a couple to split)
Disneyland,36k2et,dodgepodge,2,Wed May 20 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I agree as well. In some ways it's a cheesy experience. You're inside Pirates, for heaven's sake. It's also really dark in there, darker than I prefer when having a nice meal."

Disneyland,36k2et,dodgepodge,5,Thu May 21 04:35:57 2015 UTC,"Napa Rose in the Grand Californian is an excellent restaurant, but my favorite will always be Carthay Circle. Not only is it a fine dining restaurant, it's a cool experience going from being in DCA to this fine dining environment. It's easy to forget you're in a theme park while you're there. Plus, the World of Color dining package is a great deal."
Disneyland,36k2et,Nurd_Alurt,6,Wed May 20 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"Flo's V-8 Cafe in DCA's Cars Land is terrific. It's hands down the best ""fast serve"" style restaurant in either park. The atmosphere is 1950s - 60s style cafe and the windows overlooking the Radiator Racers really complete the feel. Try the beef and cheddar sandwhich, it's excellent, especially for ""park food"".  This might sound weird, but my favorite part of the dining experience there was the fact that the meals were served on hard, ceramic plates with actual silverware."
Disneyland,36k2et,reelredactor,2,Wed May 20 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"The food and service are great at Carthay Circle and Napa Rose and I've been able to get reservations to Carthay less than 2 weeks out before so I don't think you have to worry. I've never been to Blue Bayou so I can't comment on that experience but I will always go back to the other two. Also if you can time your reservation right, the first time I went to Carthay we asked to sit outside/upstairs  and we watched the fireworks happening on Main Street across the park. Not the best view but certainly a fun way to enjoy your meal :)"

Disneyland,36ixnn,moagybear,2,Thu May 21 06:02:02 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they'd be playing H.A.R.O.L.D. :)
Disneyland,36ixnn,SuperHotLarry,3,Thu May 21 12:18:35 2015 UTC,The reason it took so long for the Hat Box Ghost to reappear in Haunted Mansion was because Universal had an exclusivity contract for him in all the theme parks on the West Coast. That's why HBG could be seen in Orlando but not Anaheim. Disney finally bought the rights back and now he's there!

It's one of those ""hybrid"" walking shorts/swim trunks so if you get wet, it dries REALLY fast. These shorts are basically made for theme parks.  I also love moisture wicking shirts/socks to prevent blisters and sweat. Anything Nike Dri-fit does the job well. You stay nice and cool all day.  For shoes I have Nike running shoes I cycle though depending on when I go. For me, switching out the shoes I wear from day to day makes it a bit better on my feet."
Disneyland,36i1ou,thatcaveman,2,Tue May 19 16:47:23 2015 UTC,I like that shorts idea. Might have to look for those. Maybe a surf shirt as an undershirt. Cause I love my wet rides during the summer

Usually a Captain America sweater I picked up from Target to be themed. I need more Disney merch myself, but that's for a different day.  Also bring a little drawstring Nike bag that can hold lunches, water bottle and T3i. Never usually bring anything more for ease."
Disneyland,36i1ou,ranoutofbacon,2,Tue May 19 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"When it's hot and during the day I'll usually wear a tank top and cargo shorts, along with a pair of aviators. Then at night I'll swap the tank for one of those long-sleeved Dri-Fit shirts.   Never gone to an amusement park during winter, but I'd probably wear jeans with t-shirt and a zip-up hoodie. With a compact windbreaker in a backpack or something.  As far as shoes go, I'd just wear whatever I'm comfortable with wearing all day. So either my Nike Cross Trainers or Merrell Gore-Tex Moabs.  I usually carry around a small backpack, like my cycling one or something, just to keep water or any extra clothes in."
Disneyland,36i1ou,TalithaRabboni,2,Tue May 19 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Comfortable shoes, quick drying shirt and shorts along with a hat for shade."

I run very warm, so in the summer it's usually shorts and a wicking tank top under a cotton tank top and lots of sunscreen. If I go in the spring or fall, it's jeans and a tank top under a cardigan, with a zip hoodie for the evening.  I have a pair of black athletic shoes that I like to wear all the time because they're sturdy but they also have an open top (since my feet get hot), and then I add insoles because I get back pain easily.  I'm planning on going in November for the first time, so I'm going to need to rethink just about everything..."

For Disney I usually wear a disney related t-shirt or tank top from Hot Topic (when they have a sale) or Target. When I go to Universal in Orlando I will usually wear a Harry Potter themed item from the above stores, or my authentic robes.    My favorite way to dress up at Disney is during Mickey's not-so-scary Halloween.  Last year I went for a pretty simple store-bought Jasmine costume, but this year I want to go for something more elaborate."
Disneyland,36i1ou,calvinsyukonho,2,Tue May 19 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"Usually Disney t-shirts along with my Monsters University hat and cargo shorts. Depending on the weather I might switch to jeans if it's cold or if it's hot I'll just wear a tank top.   The only problem I had wearing a tank top was when riding California Screamin' the harness would run against my shoulder and it felt like my skin was being taken along with in.  I also wear my Nike running shoes (Nike Flyknit Lunar 3) because they really save my feet from all the walking and standing. And I bring a drawstring bag with me as well. Really handy to place my wallet, phone, keys, etc. in there while going on more of the thriller rides."

Keep a light hoodie stuffed in my really lightweight purse. If it gets nippy at night I'll throw a heavy jacket and my Wazowski hat in a locker. Hate being cold.   Went over spring break when it was in the 90's and had luck wearing flip flops, good sturdy ones with some cushion. Which makes me very happy since I'll probably be there in July.  I despise wearing socks and shoes but put up with compression socks because of how amazing my feet feel."

To answer your question there's really none I can think of in either ride, though in Disney's defense POTC happens in a Spainish fort/town despite the ride being in NOS, the only part that is happening in New Orleans is the beginning, just before the first drop. For HM there isn't really an excuse except for what was said earlier, the ghosts are pretty blue, but from what is discernible they're all wealthy looking white folks, some opera singers/actors, and a mummy.

My parents decided to come with my younger sister. In hopes to save some $$ she found someone on CL selling tickets. This was back when you had 10 days to use 3 day hoppers. The guy told my mom it only had 1 day used and was going to expire that week. We drove to the address and my internal alarms started to go off... the address was to an apartment building and was pretty shady. Something just wasn't right. We got out of there and got tickets at the box office. We still felt like we were violated a bit. Something so happy and nice as Disneyland and there is this black market. I couldn't image how this lady felt.

Disneyland,36ejoj,zerostarhotel,-8,Wed May 20 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck buying Disneyland tickets from strangers. That LA Weekly article talks about ""unactivated tickets"", the type that is sold like a gift card at Safeway. I would only buy actual Disneyland tickets, the kind they give away for promotions. Unused tickets are easily identified. They are flat and clean, with tiny perf marks on two sides.  Another tip: Sellers won't give up real tickets for nothing. They will usually post a price on their ad and stick to it."

Disneyland,36e6yq,golf4miami,19,Mon May 18 19:29:26 2015 UTC,With a million I think that's about all you could do.
Disneyland,36e6yq,MGJon,6,Mon May 18 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"Easier/cheaper to buy yourself a friendship with someone who's already a member, then go as a guest.    My wife and I were lucky enough to go many years ago as the guests of a mysterious benefactor (friend of a friend...my friend was asked by the Club 33 member not to divulge his name, I don't know why).  For a really nice, exclusive dinner, it really wasn't as expensive as you'd think -- I think we got out of there for less than $250.  Then again, we don't drink, so we didn't get any spendy bottles of champagne."
Disneyland,36e6yq,golf4miami,1 point,Mon May 18 20:48:14 2015 UTC,$250 is less expensive than I would think? That's about 5 times a normal dinner out anywhere.
Disneyland,36e6yq,efranz91,2,Tue May 19 12:05:15 2015 UTC,I think that is the point in regards to how exclusive it is
Disneyland,36e6yq,golf4miami,1 point,Tue May 19 12:43:16 2015 UTC,I understand that. But to insinuate that $250 is cheap is silly. It's all a matter of perspective I guess but even for Club 33 $250 is a lot of money to spend on food. Would I happily spend that much? Sure! But let's not be under the allusion that it isn't a lot of money.
Disneyland,36e6yq,MGJon,2,Tue May 19 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"When you consider how expensive it is to get and maintain a membership, $250 is nothing.  Remember, this isn't just a nice restaurant you have to make a really early reservation for; this is something that you have to be invited to.  And you're expected to dress the part, so they frown upon shorts and t-shirts.    It's an event."
Disneyland,36e6yq,golf4miami,-4,Tue May 19 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point here. You don't have to maintain a membership, someone got you in. I'm well aware there is a dress code and what Club 33 entails. I guess it's all about perspective though. If you think $250 isn't a lot of money than good for you,  you're doing better than most everyone."
Disneyland,36e6yq,stevensokulski,2,Tue May 19 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"But Club 33 probably wouldn't say that guest passes are their primary function. Membership is their primary function, and for the member the $250 would be trivial.  It's all relative. But if you had a cool million to blow on Disney stuff, $250 for dinner would probably be easy.  For my money, I'll take the 266,666 and 2/3 churros, please."
Disneyland,36e6yq,MrPoppagergio,-2,Tue May 19 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"Wow, $250 seems on the high side for two people. I went two years ago in December for my anniversary and I recall the bill being approximately $175, including gratuity, for my wife and I."

Then in no particular order I would:   * get a suite at the Grand Californian Hotel for one part of the vacation (where I would spend majority of the time at DCA), and then get a suite at The Disneyland Hotel the other part of the vacation (where I would spend majority of the time at Disneyland).   * join Club 33 and eat there every other day   * eat at Ariel's Grotto for lunch, then Blue Bayou for dinner   * book the different tours that they offer   * on rest days, enjoy room service from my suite    Considering having unlimited funds, I'd also do random acts of kindness such as:   * find a family a hook them up with a hotel suite   * anonymously pay peoples' food bill   * buy all the balloons from the balloon guy and start handing them out to kids around the park"

This last time I arrived at 2:00 am and was a little ahead of where I was the previous times.

Disneyland,36aolv,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Mon May 18 02:14:03 2015 UTC,"I like that about the Magic Eye Theater too. The Big Hero 6 preview was awesome with all the fans blowing during the flight scenes, and the bouncing floor.  And the Tomorrowland preview was awesome with all the exhibits and stuff about the World's Fair.  And it's something new every few weeks. I've seen Captain EO more than enough times to last me quite a while."

I've heard rumors that they've discontinued doing it, but I don't know for sure. I shot off a text to my friend who works at Jungle, but it's after midnight right now and I think she's asleep. If she gets back to me, I'll update this post with a more firm answer.  Ask the cast member at the exit, after they're done helping everyone off the boat. If they have a map, that CM will likely be your best bet at helping you out. Be sure to specify a map of the Jungle Cruise, not a park map -- most CMs will assume you wanted a park map and will try to dig one out from storage."

Disneyland,36c3de,mreford,3,Tue May 19 08:10:34 2015 UTC,Top 2  Space Mountain - Riding in the front makes it one of the best experiences that Disneyland has to offer. I'm a huge fan of rides that trick the senses into making it feel more intense.  Splash Mountain - Riding in the back let's me enjoy the ride without committing to getting ready soaked. The latest refurbishment has really spruced up the animatronics and that drop at the end can't be beat.  Bottom 2  Autopia - really not a fan and it's basically wasted space IMO that could be transformed into something awesome. The fumes are also annoying.  Tomorrowland Rockets - no nostalgia for me and I'm not a big fan of these sorts of rides to begin with. I really do hate its location though because it makes entering/exit tomorrowland a chore.

I love the fact that for the first few seconds of the ride you actually get to enjoy the atmosphere before you start going fast. It makes the ride for me.  Pirates of the Caribbean: This is another ride I rode multiple times. I love the ride because I always noticed something new every time I rode.  bottom 2:   Storybrook Canal Boats: I went on becuase my sister wanted to ride but both of us had seen better minature villages and I felt like I would fall alseep.  Matterhorn: I'm 6'1"", so I scrinch into the cart which is disappointing. I also found it way to rough and was bruised badly from it.

Bottom 2:  Autopia- it doesn't fit with a futuristic Tomorrowland, it's smelly, it's boring, and it takes up waaay too much space for how humdrum it is.

I love the story, the pace, the music, everything. I even love the Christmas overlay. I can't wait to see the hatbox ghost in person.  Indiana Jones - You really can't beat the theming. The queue is amazing in itself. I remember riding it opening week. The line went down Main Street. When all the elements work, it's the best ride in the park, imo.  Bottom 2:  Innoventions - although it's not open currently, even from day 1 it felt like it was lacking something. Tom Morrow was a cool animatronic when he was working, but Innoventions has been sort of a glorified arcade. It has had some fun features, like talking to Stitch, but I could pass on it every trip and not feel like I was missing something important.  Rocket Jets - Like everyone has said, it's boring and an eye sore.  Runner-up - Mickey's Wheel of Death. Noooo thank you."

The new ride will keep the existing tire showroom building and indoor queue, and use a version of the WiFi controlled system that guides autonomous vehicles through the Ratatouille ride at Disneyland Paris and Mystic Manor at Hong Kong Disneyland. The massive fans and deep basement that powered the Flying Tires ride system will be put into mothballs, while the new ride is built literally on its grave. If the aggressive schedule from WDI pans out, the new ride could be up and running by the Christmas season of 2015, just under a year from the time the Flying Tires closed."

Disneyland,36aezl,stevensokulski,2,Mon May 18 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"Getting a license to play published music is actually quite easy. Especially if you are using it as background / ambience music. When it isn't the focal point of the show, isn't being made for sale, and isn't being edited, performed, or re-recorded, its quite simple.  Companies like BMI and ASCAP offer packages depending on how much music you'll play and who will hear it. That determines how much you pay.  You then are usually asked for a list of the tracks you've used during a period of time and the play count of each. The money you pay is then divvied up amongst all of the rights holders as a percentage of the money they received from you."

I'm a little brother too and there were tons of time I would third wheel with my sister and her boyfriend.   I'm sure there'd be times he'd appreciate sitting with his sister instead of having to expect to sit alone or a single rider all the time but I'm sure he also understands that you guys are married and that you two are a couple.   And let's be real, if you're taking him to Disneyland, he'll probably be more looking forward to just doing things Disney instead of worrying about the group interaction aspect. Even though most amusement park rides are set up in pairs, they have thousands of odd-numbered groups visiting all the time."
Disneyland,36d96a,nyugu,3,Mon May 18 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"Stop stressing, lol. Tons of rides have 4/6 seats. Folks like me exist to be a single to jump in there. On the random ride like haunted mansion one of you can take the next car pretty easy.   Go and have fun. The CMs are used to mom, dad and junior groups so they will sort you out"
Disneyland,36d96a,Techsupportvictim,2,Mon May 18 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that you are already mindful of it means you'll handle it well. I've often gone in odd groups, with a married couple or with my family,  and we've tended to just mix it up on our own. Sometimes two people are more excited for a certain ride so they sit together, with the family I tended to sit alone in front of them so I could snap pics.   Mix it up and ride with him, or him with his sister so you all take turns. Most rides even if you aren't in the same row you're in the same car, but it's nice not always being the one tagged the third. And do some single rider lines! The time saving is worth it and it's fun to get mixed in with strangers sometimes!"
Disneyland,36d96a,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,1 point,Tue May 19 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest this as well. If someone always has to be the odd man out, might as well be all of you AND you save time."
Disneyland,36d96a,PicklePants84,-8,Tue May 19 08:19:37 2015 UTC,There is no difference on an experience in Disney with 1 person or 5 people. I think the real problem here is your don't want your wife's brother to come.
Disneyland,36d96a,trac54,3,Thu May 21 02:14:03 2015 UTC,"No that's not the thing. I was in a similar situation when i was younger, and i was the one left out. I just want to make sure everybody enjoys it to the fullest!"
Disneyland,36awpv,leftleftleftleft,10,Sun May 17 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"possibly due to the measles outbreak   Lol, I thought it said weasels."

Disneyland,36awpv,ephdisc,5,Mon May 18 05:44:31 2015 UTC,"If the rumors about Toontown's future are true, they might be paring the maintenance budget for some of the effects in the area ahead of an impending closure.  Though with the track record of the past decade, it is possible that its just broken and will be offstage for a time."
Disneyland,36awpv,stevensokulski,1 point,Mon May 18 05:49:26 2015 UTC,What are the rumors? I seem to have missed out on those.
Disneyland,36awpv,Pinklette,2,Tue May 19 06:14:31 2015 UTC,"There have been a few different rumors flying about locations for a Star Wars land. One suggests the space between Space Mountain and it's a small world as a potential plot for expansion. Innoventions, Autopia, and Subs would go away.  Alternatively, the land currently occupied by Toontown and Big Thunder Ranch could be cleared for a new land.  I believe MiceAge has reported on both, but I'm not sure one or the other has more traction in the rumor mill at the moment."
Disneyland,36awpv,stevensokulski,1 point,Tue May 19 16:36:06 2015 UTC,"As long as Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin stays, they can get rid of everything else. They just haven't put a lot of the usual creative Disney thought into the rest of that land."
Disneyland,36awpv,endlessendres,2,Mon May 18 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"I hope Roger sticks around. I fear that might not be an option if they intend to repurpose the rest of the land, though."
Disneyland,36awpv,stevensokulski,2,Mon May 18 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed - I go into Toontown every visit for Roger, but only upon my first visit did I ever venture into the other side of the land.  Ideally, I'd want to see that bit of Toontown with Roger and the fountain (and maybe the bit next door with the Ink and Paint club facade) stick around as a mini-land.  Wishful thinking, I know."
Disneyland,36atg4,patty__mac,11,Sun May 17 21:24:00 2015 UTC,I'd want to know your demographic info that you're comfortable sharing. What's your history with Disneyland?  My favorite secret is the Fowler's Inn dining area. I like to carry a bread bowl over there to enjoy.
Disneyland,36atg4,MaLaCoiD,6,Sun May 17 23:04:14 2015 UTC,"FWIW I spent a day alone at Disneyland and it was great. Not having to cater to anybody else's interests or feelings, or having to walk at someone else's pace, is truly freeing. You get to see just what you want, when you want, how you want. Plus you can take advantage of the single-rider lines."
Disneyland,36atg4,Gumby_Hitler,5,Mon May 18 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"This so hard. Disney is fun with friends, no doubt, but it's really nice to do EXACTLY what you want without having to cater to those around you."

Disneyland,36atg4,RockemSockemCronuts,1 point,Mon May 18 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"I live in Texas, have an annual pass and I go to Disneyland about every 3-4 months. In fact, I'm heading out there this weekend for the 24 hour event and staying until Tuesday.  I was in town last month for the Star Wars convention and went for the first time by myself. It was different.  Normally when I go with a group of friends, we all have to decide on where to go next. (take a vote, consider suggestions, see if anyone is hungry, etc.).When I went last month, I was able to cruise at my own pace and go see what I wanted to see.  If I wanted to go ride Tower of Terror, I just did it. Haunted Mansion? Sounds good to me.  No asking people, no input from anybody else other than myself. It felt so relaxing to be able just to hang out.  If I wasn't already going to Dallas that week in July, I would seriously consider meeting you out there.  Either way, I'm sure you'll have a blast regardless if you meet up with someone or not! :)"
Disneyland,36c881,gjrabbit,3,Mon May 18 05:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. However you can only go through the main entrance, they will not allow you to go through the Cast parking lot next to Toy Story"
Disneyland,36c881,lego606,3,Mon May 18 06:21:21 2015 UTC,Yup! Have done a few times while staying near there to save some steps!
Disneyland,36c881,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,3,Mon May 18 07:05:20 2015 UTC,I stayed at the Red Lion and did this. Then I realized I wasted 20 minutes waiting for the bus and the drop off was just as far a walk.
Disneyland,36c881,ranoutofbacon,2,Mon May 18 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"I've done it quite a few times. Some of the hotels have their own shuttles, but their usually cost, and it's not like the shuttle drivers can check if you've really parked there or not."
Disneyland,36c881,imperialbeach,1 point,Wed May 20 01:30:23 2015 UTC,I was mostly worried about them stopping me from walking onto the lot
Disneyland,36c881,imperialbeach,1 point,Wed May 20 03:50:06 2015 UTC,They've never stopped me. It's definitely worth a try!
Disneyland,36c881,JalenJade,2,Wed May 20 03:51:11 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of people who walk form the lot to the park and back so there's no reason for them to stop anyone from entering the lot on foot. (As long as you do it safely.) However you may just want to skip the wait for the bus and walk to the gate, it isn't that far."

Disneyland,367xfg,VersaceTupperware,3,Sun May 17 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Really fun to watch!  This might seem crazy but I am absolutely terrified of this ride. I rode it thinking it looks like a fun-harmless-kid-friendly roller coaster and did not enjoy it. Something about those turns at the very top, it feels like the car can fly off of them every time you turn."
Disneyland,367xfg,tenshi_73,2,Mon May 18 06:04:09 2015 UTC,I find the ride more painful than frightening. It's like a violent mugging simulator.
Disneyland,367xfg,Hyro0o0,3,Mon May 18 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Cool video, I just cannot bring myself to care about that ride. It can hardly be called a Disney ride - it's a generic roller coaster with some pictures of Goofy nailed onto it."

Disneyland,3678fs,sparklyshizzle,2,Sun May 17 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"Just to add, I think the only place on Resort property that might sell a battery pack would be the Best Buy vending machine in Downtown Disney.  (I'm pretty sure it's across from the World of Disney and La Brea Bakery entrances)  If they have any, they're probably the much pricier, lower capacity Mophie Powerstations.  But they're excellent quality products and they come pre-charged."

Disneyland,3678fs,dodgepodge,10,Sun May 17 20:21:22 2015 UTC,The outlets at Disneyland are extremely powerful. I've seen phones explode when people plug them into the outlets around the park.   Main Street has charging lockers for $2 an hour.
Disneyland,3678fs,mildly_interesting,7,Sun May 17 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"Wait, WHAT? Exploding phones???"
Disneyland,3678fs,dodgepodge,8,Sun May 17 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"I've seen two. The first was in that hallway at the end of Astro. I only saw the aftermath, which was a ton of security, a mom and child talking to a firefighter and manager and a black smear in the carpet.   The second one I actually witnessed. Across from the vineyard, there's some outlets along the parade route. It sounded kinda like a quiet gunshot and this teenage girl was screaming. We stuck around to watch the clean up. The girl was totally fine, just upset she absolutely destroyed her phone. Medical cleared her out, she talked to the firefighter, and I remember the security guard telling her they weren't going to replace her phone but she could use a phone to call her mom.   A few other CM friends of mine have seen them too. Custodial says it's the absolute worst after it rains."
Disneyland,3678fs,mildly_interesting,4,Sun May 17 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the outlets have a higher output than the phones can input power, frying the batteries."
Disneyland,3678fs,CydonPrax,0,Mon May 18 00:14:17 2015 UTC,That's not how electricity works.
Disneyland,3678fs,rycar,2,Mon May 18 05:48:39 2015 UTC,"I realize that there is a lot to what is actually happening, but that works as a highly simplified example for people to understand."
Disneyland,3678fs,CydonPrax,2,Mon May 18 05:52:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work though.  What exactly about the output is higher?  The only thing that could be higher that would cause damage is the voltage.  Outlets with higher voltage have different shaped holes, the charger wouldn't even fit, and even if some idiot electrician wired up a 220V or 240V output up to a 120V outlet, most phone chargers work in the 100V - 240V range anyways, so they would be fine.  The charger would most likely die before it could harm a phone, and the circuit in the phone that manages charging the battery would shut off or die before being able to harm the battery.  Only thing I can thing of is that if the outlet was intended to be used for lights, then maybe there is a dimmer on the circuit, and that might do some weird stuff, but even if that was the case, the problem would be sending less power, not more."
Disneyland,3678fs,rycar,1 point,Mon May 18 06:47:17 2015 UTC,"Unless you are using a cheap charger, most phone chargers have chip that control the flow."
Disneyland,3678fs,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 22 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"Often when those things happen it's cause someone swapped out the original battery for a cheap ass one. The cheap ones often don't have the right sensors and chips that tell the phone it has enough power. So it just keeps trying to charge, heats up battery, it swells and the cheap ass enclosure splits. Lithium, which is typical in phones today, and oxygen do not mix.   But even that said, you are better off having a battery than trusting to get a locker or find a plug. I have a mophie 8x I can use on my phone, tablet etc. makes me through the day great"
Disneyland,3678fs,Techsupportvictim,-4,Fri May 22 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that's true, I was watching some YouTube videos from last years 24 hour day and the people in the video where using random outlets they found around the park to charge their phones and cameras. They do exist but appear to be scattered and in inconvenient locations."
Disneyland,3678fs,gjrabbit,7,Sun May 17 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"Obviously they don't all explode, but it has happened before."
Disneyland,3678fs,mildly_interesting,5,Sun May 17 16:58:16 2015 UTC,Inside the Starbucks on main street in the far righthand corner are some outlets.
Disneyland,3678fs,AstroZombie1508,2,Sun May 17 16:01:33 2015 UTC,I've successfully charged my phone using the outlets under the sinks in the Carnation Cafe bathroom. There's an outlet to the right in the Disneyland Starbucks also.
Disneyland,3678fs,bubblesugarsocks,2,Sun May 17 16:47:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/sparklyshizzle. The battery pack is the way to go.

Disneyland,3678fs,elephant29,0,Wed May 27 19:20:34 2015 UTC,There's an outlet in the bushes just on the northeast corner fence surrounding the Teacups.

Disneyland,364458,waterfox17,5,Sat May 16 04:37:43 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Probably a fun day when you can switch out with your fellow cast members for a few minutes to ride for a couple of cycles.
Disneyland,364458,EagleEyeInTheSky,2,Sat May 16 04:56:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah a friend and I were curious about what was goin on. I was hopin that a cast member might be like what the hay and let us test but alas.
Disneyland,364458,ledfrog,2,Sat May 16 06:48:51 2015 UTC,"Serious questions: Other than launching a brand new ride with some sort of patented technology, why is Disneyland so obsessed with secrecy? In all honesty who really cares if someone spoke about a newly rehabbed ride? What negative things might happened if a video ""leaked"" online? Is all this just a way to keep things hyped and get a boost an attendance by people who actually sit on the edge of their seat waiting to see something new on an old ride?   I mean they protect this type of information as if they're hiding the details of an unfinished movie script. A ride still has to be experienced in person so I can't figure out what keeping these secrets actually does?"
Disneyland,364458,ledfrog,2,Sat May 16 08:35:52 2015 UTC,"Consistency makes perfect sense. I guess when you're dealing with a company as large as Disney, it's best to treat everything the same.   On a side note, Disney will probably only be able to keep Mickey Mouse as a trademark because come 2024, Steamboat Willie and The Barn Dance will become the first Mickey Mouse cartoons to enter the public domain. That is unless another copyright extension law is put into place before then like what was done in the 70's. It's going to be interesting as the years go on with all these modern works of art losing copyright status.   But like I said, Disney should be able to keep Mickey as a trademark because of his use in marketing campaigns for all things Disney."

Disneyland,364458,ledfrog,2,Sat May 16 21:16:04 2015 UTC,Yes but some people may decide to pass...at least on paying for a theatre ticket...due to their opinion on the story. They might instead watch a rented video or go to a friend's house thus the studio wouldn't make money on that customer.
Disneyland,364458,rycar,1 point,Sat May 16 21:44:31 2015 UTC,There you go.
Disneyland,364458,ledfrog,1 point,Sat May 16 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"There I go what? I still don't think they are the same thing. Even of a full POV ride video in HD was posted online, nobody would ever say, ""Well,  I just watched the ride, so I'm good...now I don't have to pay admission to Disneyland to experience it.""  But a leak of a film and/or its script could be financially detrimental to a studio."
Disneyland,364458,waterfox17,3,Sat May 16 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"Not a likely scenario.  Most likely, it's to allow the CMs to refresh their training for operating the consoles, since it hasn't been open in so long.  Disney Ops tries to refresh us on attractions AT LEAST once a year.  And CMs need to be able to tell their guests about the nature of the ride.  I overheard that the new animatronics seemed very intimidating (from those who rode)."
Disneyland,364458,mauvareen,3,Sun May 17 01:52:32 2015 UTC,"The last time I rode that ride it threw my back out for two weeks. Unless they made that a smoother ride, I will never ride it again, which sucks, it was always my favorite ride as a child."
Disneyland,364458,rycar,2,Sun May 17 06:56:56 2015 UTC,I've seen hundreds of posts saying the same thing.  I am very curious to hear from anyone if any upgrades were done to address this issue.
Disneyland,364458,mauvareen,1 point,Sat May 16 07:07:10 2015 UTC,I will have to find out from here because I am too afraid to ride it myself to see.

Disneyland,364458,TalithaRabboni,30,Sat May 16 21:13:26 2015 UTC,It's been individual seating for a while now. (I wanna say since 2012? Can someone correct/confirm this?)
Disneyland,364458,comixlover13,12,Sun May 17 05:46:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the last 2 or 3 years. I'm torn, I want to see what they did in the update but I really dislike these sleds. I'm really tall and my knees end up smashed into the seat :/"
Disneyland,364458,iSkelly87,3,Sat May 16 00:52:20 2015 UTC,I feel your pain my tall friend. Most rides at Disneyland is not a problem for me but all the rides I grew up with at six flags are now really small and last time I went I left with bruises from the shoulder harnesses. Also the new ride at Knott's my knees barely fit under the bar.
Disneyland,364458,comixlover13,2,Sat May 16 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. Usually I am good at Disney,  it's one of few rides I have an issue on. My husband and I are both over 6' and the last time I went with him,  my knees kept smacking into his seat and his legs were pushed uncomfortably wide so his hips just ached. There is a piece of track that can slide to the side in the load zone and they needed to relieve a back up before they let us off. We were aching to get out and they were like ""Thanks for being so patient guys, we're going to let you ride again on us, no line!"" It was a very 'YAY!.....wait...dammit' kind of moment."
Disneyland,364458,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,1 point,Sat May 16 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not very tall, but have long legs and this ride in particular kills me. I'm generally paying so much attention to protecting my knees that I end up whacking my spine in an unpleasant way.   I'll give it one go because I'm excited to see the updates, but on the last day of my visit so I'm not hobbled during Disney time!"
Disneyland,364458,SunnyxBunny,2,Sat May 16 02:31:41 2015 UTC,Maybe 2013-2014. I had a pass in 2012 and I had to cuddle up to my sis on that ride. I was thrown around like a ragdoll. They even had renovations back then and changed the bobsleds...for 2012.  I have no idea what the recent renovations are about.

Disneyland,365tbn,imperialbeach,2,Sat May 16 20:46:34 2015 UTC,Mine was also back in 2009. How coincidental.
Disneyland,365tbn,LuluVonLuvenburg,2,Sun May 17 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"They get there earlier, usually around noon, 10-2 is just the time when everyone who's not there for grad night has to leave. So for four hours seniors have the park to themselves."
Disneyland,365tbn,HappyBobunk,2,Sat May 16 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"Class of 2013 here, I think that's the year they switched to DCA from Disneyland. And we had to be on the bus by 3am, the gates to leave opened at 3am, I believe thats when it all ended. Got there at 3pm by decision of the class, and we got park hopper tickets along with our wristbands"
Disneyland,365tbn,VersaceTupperware,1 point,Sun May 17 08:24:33 2015 UTC,"I just went last year, the grad nite festivities start at ten, but you can enter the park at any time before ten. For example, I got there around 5 pm, they closed the park at ten, and then the real party started in California Adventure. They didn't let us go to Disneyland after 10 though, which was a bit disappointing but I understand why."
Disneyland,365e2d,skygem,2,Sat May 16 08:28:05 2015 UTC,It is near the monster inc ride. To the right of the muppets theatre. You'll see CMs with the timers. Make sure you see how spaced the two are from each other. Anna/Elsa is a small return window. We almost went over on our last visit waiting to see Olaf
Disneyland,365e2d,DennisNedrysGhost,1 point,Sat May 16 17:06:19 2015 UTC,So there isn't actually a ticket distribution booth for it?
Disneyland,365e2d,Mrbman11999,1 point,Sat May 16 17:49:16 2015 UTC,If you're staying at a Disney Resort you have extra magic hours on select days so look at the schedule and check what time it is. As soon as you get in you can rush over to cars and then over to the frozen area to do Anna and Elsa and then over behind Oakens trading post where Olaf is. All the locations are on the map and if its the earliest magic hour which I think starts at 7? (Don't quote me on that) there's almost no one because its so early and you won't need a fast past. I hope that helps

Disneyland,363lzt,wtphodobo,1 point,Sun May 17 06:35:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the special 24-hour day only food was probably the best part of last year's day, with the Pastrami Flatbread, the Sweet and Salty Dog, Super Sub Sammie (the best thing all day!), and the Shawarma Pizza. So, I was really excited to see what they'd do this year, and while everything looks great, it's all looks a little less exciting this year than last to be honest. I'll still look forward to trying as much as I can, but they set the bar really high last year"

Disneyland,362l8v,h_lehmann,7,Fri May 15 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"Much as I like the new theme, I also enjoyed the old one as well.  It epitomized the idea of the California high desert in the 1940's-50's. The area borrowed heavily from the atmosphere that was used in The Right Stuff (1983), and in my opinion this was the best themed area of DCA 1.0 (not that it had much competition, of course)"
Disneyland,362l8v,Tofinochris,2,Fri May 15 23:06:24 2015 UTC,No hate from me if you liked it.  Lots of folks must have or it would have been designed that way to begin with.

Disneyland,362l8v,Stradocaster,6,Fri May 15 17:50:14 2015 UTC,Well they're probably 4k but obviously the current show is still older footage. Still probably looks a lot better though
Disneyland,362l8v,thatcaveman,2,Fri May 15 18:45:47 2015 UTC,That looks great. I always thought Condor Flats was a bit misplaced in the theming of that area. Everything blends together nicely now.

Disneyland,362l8v,EagleEyeInTheSky,18,Fri May 15 18:11:50 2015 UTC,Not to the a cynic but it's probably named after the mountain that is shaped like a bear that has been called Grizzly Peak since the park opened.

So we were thinking that -- rather than have the Abominable Snowman remain as this sort of static, stationary figure at the very heart of the Matterhorn -- wouldn't it be cool if, while you were riding through the mountain, you now got the sense that the Abominable Snowman was running along right next to your bobsled. That you could now catch glimpses of him moving through the Matterhorn just ahead of you,"" Irvine enthused.  ""Again, I want to stress here that the story that the Matterhorn tells is pretty much the same. The big change is, of course, with the Abominable Snowman. He's a little bit more ferocious, a little bit more exciting,"" Kim said. ""And if you're really paying attention as you ride along in your bobsled, you may notice that -- at various points along the way -- that there are these caves where the Abominable Snowman seems to be hoarding things that he found out in the Park. That -- if you look closely -- you may be able to see items that pay tribute to rides, shows and attractions from Disneyland's past."""
Disneyland,36303p,Wonderground,13,Fri May 15 17:49:08 2015 UTC,LOVE IT. I'm not sure how the meta-ness of the Yeti getting things from the park is going to work out (doesn't that take us out of the scene?) but it sounds like a good time.
Disneyland,36303p,mildly_interesting,6,Fri May 15 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really looking forward towards how they plan on doing this. I never really thought that the Matterhorn Bobsleds had much of a story. Hopefully this will bring to light what the actual story of the mountain is.  I'm also interested on how they plan on making you feel like the Yeti is following you. I bet it'll be something like shadow projections. That will be really cool."
Disneyland,36303p,booboothechicken,7,Fri May 15 18:56:34 2015 UTC,I was thinking something like the projections used in Ghost Galaxy

Disneyland,36303p,Stradocaster,3,Fri May 15 22:25:57 2015 UTC,I'd love to know if its any more comfortable or not.  New projections still won't get me on that. Too painful.

Disneyland,36303p,LibraryKrystal,2,Fri May 15 21:14:54 2015 UTC,Which ride do you prefer between the two?  I've never been to animal kingdom.
Disneyland,36303p,PeggyOlson225,3,Fri May 15 21:50:54 2015 UTC,I've been on both and thought EE was far superior.  Much of the Matterhorn's status seems to come from nostalgia - being an original/classic.  It's over very quickly.  I rode MB for the first time last fall and it was underwhelming after having been on EE a couple of times before (even with Disco Yeti).  I also had a painful knee for the rest of the night after the bobsled ride because of how rough it was and how I had to brace myself (and I was only in my 20s).
Disneyland,36303p,El_Catrin,2,Fri May 15 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, EE certainly looks like it would be way more interesting to ride; better effects, newer, etc. But, seeing as I'm not going to FL anytime soon, I'm interested to see how the new update to MB compares to the graphics/effects on EE that I see in the videos online."
Disneyland,36303p,Amphigorey,2,Sat May 16 01:03:20 2015 UTC,I keep hearing about this Disco Yeti. What is it exactly?
Disneyland,36303p,PeggyOlson225,2,Sat May 16 22:49:28 2015 UTC,"The foundation that the Yeti animatronic rests on has cracked, so he can no longer make his full range of movements. Instead, they cover him with strobe lights, poor thing. Hence Disco Yeti."
Disneyland,36303p,collegemathchef,3,Sun May 17 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"Nostalgia aside, EE is a MUCH better ride. In my opinion, the best roller coaster in all of Disneyworld. It's a very intense ride, even if it doesn't go upside down."
Disneyland,36303p,fontizmo,2,Sat May 16 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I've never been either. I heard about it from a friend who did, and then looked up a video of it, because it sounded intriguing. Judging from the article, it sounds like they took that concept and sort of applied it to Matterhorn, in a way."

Disneyland,364qqj,crazy550,1 point,Sun May 17 02:20:35 2015 UTC,"Went tonight. ""Fantasy in the sky"" sucked. We staked our place as usual 2 hours before and the show was literally no more than 5 mins long...."
Disneyland,364qqj,lotzasunshine,2,Sun May 17 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"This happened last Friday when we were in the park, went straight to Haunted Mansion after Fantasmic and watched the show from the queue. The fireworks started as we turned the corner after the tombstones and was over before the line got up next to the house. Like you said, it was 5-10 minutes long.  I think there are just so many elements in place for the new show, which they obviously are not ready to run, they are limited in what they can do while working around that.   It is kind of disingenuous to call it ""Fantasy in the Sky"" and make people think its new or different when it's basically a placeholder."

Disneyland,362rtj,lostandalong,4,Sat May 16 03:06:33 2015 UTC,Just got off the ride. Somewhat disappointed. But maybe I was just expecting more. Everything seemed the same including the film. Only difference was the nicer screen
Disneyland,362rtj,omark2398,6,Sat May 16 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"Well, from the beginning all they mentioned was updating the screen... /shrug"
Disneyland,362rtj,chandelure,-6,Sat May 16 05:33:17 2015 UTC,That's strange considering how pretty much everyone knew when they were supposedly filming new footage for it.
Disneyland,362rtj,austinbucco,2,Sat May 16 06:07:56 2015 UTC,They've also said repeatedly that the new film is not related to this refurb at all since Shanghai is slated to get the new film first.
Disneyland,362rtj,EagleEyeInTheSky,-2,Sat May 16 16:30:41 2015 UTC,Ah okay. Haven't seen that.
Disneyland,362rtj,austinbucco,2,Sat May 16 16:48:43 2015 UTC,This is a bummer. I was hoping for at least an updated screen.
Disneyland,362rtj,Ver314,2,Sat May 16 06:17:22 2015 UTC,"The image was sharper and a little more HD, but not too noticeable considering how huge the projection is. The ending was just a more HD cgi Tinkerbell"
Disneyland,362rtj,VersaceTupperware,1 point,Sun May 17 08:28:27 2015 UTC,"Went on it today was clearer, but lighting was more dim. Also, the night scenes of flying over LA and Disneyland seemed off a little. I think it'll look better when they update the movie."
Disneyland,362rtj,jimmysceneit,1 point,Sun May 17 23:10:51 2015 UTC,Did they change the queue inside the show building? I loved the tributes they had to the aviators...
Disneyland,362rtj,thatcaveman,-10,Mon May 18 16:14:13 2015 UTC,It doesn't open until next week. I'm going to try to hit it when I'm at 24hours so if I do I'll let you know
Disneyland,362rtj,Techsupportvictim,10,Sat May 16 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"It, along with the rest of Grizzly Peak Airfield, opened today."
Disneyland,362rtj,TheRealMe99,-6,Sat May 16 02:10:51 2015 UTC,The announcement I saw was the 22nd but perhaps that is the official open and they did a soft with the rest of the area. Or got it done earlier than expected. Which is great for the folks that go this weekend
Disneyland,362rtj,Techsupportvictim,4,Sat May 16 14:33:15 2015 UTC,Oh really? I thought it opened today. At least the outside of it looks cool!
Disneyland,3611ib,lionday,6,Fri May 15 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"They let us in ahead of the crowd and had us yell ""Let the magic begin!!!"" and lead the countdown. They also gave us single ""free use"" fastpass good for a group of 6. We took a random duo with us to Space Mountain after the fast passes for that ride ran out."
Disneyland,3611ib,HappyBobunk,3,Fri May 15 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"What! I had to answer 5 Disney trivia questions as a citizenship test to earn that pin! One of the questions was name 10 villains that don't wear any form of special hat or hair, and no Pixar movies allowed. That's really difficult when you're put on the spot and realize villains almost always have fancy headgear xD"

Disneyland,3611ib,HappyBobunk,3,Wed May 20 06:05:12 2015 UTC,Shere Khan and Shan Yu are two more animated villains. After 7 I really got stuck and he reminded me to think of live action movies too. So I cheated for the last three: the Sanderson Sisters!
Disneyland,3611ib,Not_Steve,2,Wed May 20 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"I was questioning whether live action counted. That's a pretty hard question, props for getting all 10."
Disneyland,3611ib,Luvsicpt2,5,Wed May 20 14:27:30 2015 UTC,Got one yesterday  You have to answer trivia questions to get one   Edit: I guess they just hand them out or have you do stuff for it to be a little fun haha
Disneyland,3611ib,Clint_Swift,16,Fri May 15 06:49:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is anything you have to do.  I was given one for being patient with a CM, my mom simply asked for one at city hall, my SO got one after getting shoved to the ground by a poop head.  Seems like there are no guidelines at all, and that CM's can give 'em to whoever."
Disneyland,3611ib,SteveB0X,3,Fri May 15 07:11:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I got one for watching the final Captain EO show. It just has to be somewhat special

We told him it was quieter so we could talk and enjoy family time together and he gave each of us one. CMs hand them out for all sorts of reasons."

Disneyland,3611ib,youneednewshoes,1 point,Fri May 15 11:35:09 2015 UTC,"My mom and I each got one last week too! We had asked a Tomorrowland CM if she had any fun buttons (like the 1st time/bday ones) and she was one short of enough ""Happily ever after""s for our party. So she gave my mom one of these, saw how excited/jealous I was and dug another one out of her pocket. Hi, Nikkie!!"
Disneyland,360olk,Tui717,11,Fri May 15 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of Hatty (let alone the Haunted Mansion), I can't believe he's finally back!  I'll be honest - the D23 model (which, to be fair, was a repurposed Lincoln figure) was neat simply because it showed that Disney was aware of Hatty's following. It barely looked like the wild eyed, Burtonesque original, which was my biggest issue with it.  But, Disney delivered! The new Hatty figure looks exactly as insane as the old one, and the improvements they made, such as more movement bodily and facially, are just great!   Again, I honestly can't believe he's 'alive' again - Disney really knows it fans.  Now, let's all pray he comes to WDW sooner than later..."
Disneyland,360olk,papersorplastics,8,Fri May 15 03:49:51 2015 UTC,Most of what I've heard is he will be staying at Disneyland exclusively.

Disneyland,35yk1c,Move4me,6,Thu May 14 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"Not only is this a fascinating look back at Disneyland history, it's also a fascinating look back at early live broadcasting (and of entertainment in the mid-1950s). I think this might have been one of the biggest live broadcasts of the time.  It's kind of fun to laugh at (some of those character costumes are slightly terrifying, and of course there's the shot of the one host making out with a dancer), but I love watching it, especially when I can connect it with what's still in the park today."

Does this video cover those?     No. According to the video, everything is perfect, even though you can see the Mark Twain listing dangerously to one side because it was over capacity and everybody had crowded over on the dock (port?) side.  There are hiccups in the broadcast, however. Misplaced microphones, missed cues, cutting over to someone who wasn't ready... I mean, it was live TV. Stuff happens."

Disneyland,361btb,YoeSafBridge,6,Fri May 15 07:02:17 2015 UTC,"I've probably already posted this, but it is by far my favorite story. Lsat september I took my fiance down for the Avengers half marathon weekend. He hadn't been since he was four years old, and had no memory of his time there. He also is a bit stingy with money, and wasn't enthused about the costs for us to go (We didn't stay on site, I think he'd have been pissed if we had.)  Anyway, we get there the first night, and We are rushing, I am dragging him through the park to make our dinner resverations when just outside of main street the lights dim and a voice welcomes us to join in the celebration of Christmas. Music plays, and snow come out right above his head from a stand hiding in a tree. I turned to look at him and his expression is just frozen in that of childlike joy.  It was so perfect he thought I planned it.  We are going back for our birthdays this September, I have no idea how I'm going to top that first night!"
Disneyland,361btb,The_Doogenhammer,3,Fri May 15 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"There's nothing like that moment when Disney makes it snow at Christmas. As someone who grew up in southern California and never seen snow, the first time they made it snow I nearly cried. The music, the surprise, the simultaneous ""awwww"" from the crowd, just everything.  Its still my favorite moment I've had by far at Disney."
Disneyland,361btb,TalithaRabboni,2,Sat May 16 03:44:30 2015 UTC,"I have a good friend who loves Disneyland, but her husband never ""got"" it, for whatever reason. She would drag him around the parks, and he'd tag along reluctantly. Finally, one day at their house, she was watching Tangled and he joined her and ended up loving it. Fast forward to a new trip to Disneyland and his excitement when he realized you could meet Flynn and Rapunzel. Now he loves Disneyland and they go all the time.  Once the magic gets you, it gets you good. :D"

If you're looking for a specific pair just ask a cast member (lead or back of house) to look it up in the system. They can tell you if it is still available and where. I would also ask them to call over to the other store to verify the stock because the inventory is usually updated only once a day in the morning."

Disneyland,3606t0,c10layman,3,Thu May 14 23:59:09 2015 UTC,A couple of great places to let little ones run around and stretch their legs are the Wilderness Adventure Camp (in DCA) and the Pirates' Lair (in DL). It's hard for them to sit in a stroller all day and wait in lines and these places just allow them to get some energy out. There are things to do for bigger kids in the wilderness camp area (like a zip line and rock wall) that my toddler was too small for but she loved just running through the caves and rope bridges.
Disneyland,3606t0,JnnfrMac,2,Fri May 15 06:03:50 2015 UTC,"Those sound perfect, he'll definitely need time to get energy out so we'll definitely be looking for those spots. Thanks!"
Disneyland,3606t0,Techsupportvictim,3,Fri May 15 06:11:54 2015 UTC,How tall is he? That is going to decide about which rides you can take him on. Many that have any kind of speed or turns require all riders to be at least 40 inches due to the belts and bars. And they check carefully. You might want to sort out which rides he won't be able to do before he gets too excited about something and is told he can't.
Disneyland,3606t0,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 15 18:12:54 2015 UTC,Our son is 35 inches tall so I hope there's still a lot of rides that he can do with me.  We'll be pretty bummed if he's limited to just a few rides.

Just maybe pack a change of clothes."
Disneyland,3606t0,Firehawksmom,2,Fri May 15 20:19:49 2015 UTC,Honestly my daughter's favorite rides were Jungle Cruise and Pirates! She didn't care for Toon Town much longer than 20m or so but it was a great spot to take a break from rides in. The lines were the hardest part so I recommend having snacks and whatever activities your toddler enjoys that can be done while waiting in line. The line for Jungle Cruise she just screamed and screamed and we almost didn't ride it but then we got on and she was enchanted. I can still close my eyes and remember how in awe she was. The dark rides were a little scary for our toddler but she made it through- we just kept her close to us and made sure she knew she was safe.
Disneyland,3606t0,JediWithRedEyes,2,Fri May 15 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, I'm definitely most concerned about the lines with it being a weekend.  We'll have to figure out some stuff to keep him occupied."
Disneyland,3606t0,Firehawksmom,2,Fri May 15 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"Along the lines of dark rides, make sure you're a little familiar with them first and warn the little one of potential scares (the waterfall in pirates, the screaming in the stretching room). Tell him that people may shout or scream, but it's just for fun."

Disneyland,35yimm,dodgepodge,3,Thu May 14 17:20:52 2015 UTC,Can you afford Deluxe if you do monthly payments? It'd be something like $137 up front (one day entry plus first month's payment) and $37.50 every month after.

Disneyland,35wy17,superHOTSAUCE,9,Thu May 14 05:01:57 2015 UTC,"The park closes a little earlier. Kids with wristbands have to be in the park before it closes. Only they will have access to rides and shops. Since non-students don't have wristbands they can't do anything and therefore pretty much have to leave. There are A LOT of annoying, loud, rude, disrespectful, rambunctious teenagers there but mostly in the evening time. Some go during the day. It was seriously some of the worst CM shifts I've had there. One kid said, ""thank you for working tonight"" to me. We need more kids like that."

Disneyland,35wy17,fontizmo,2,Thu May 14 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"I had the same question so I called the park to find out. The calendar is wrong. Grad night is only in CA Adventure and it starts when the park closes and goes until 2am or so. Since Grad Night is for locals, a lot of the students already have annual passes or may just purchase a ticket for the day since they will be there at night. This may increase park capacity(in both parks) for the day. Once CA Adventure closes, only Grad Night attendees are allowed to remain in the park. The calendar may just gives those times as a warning to guests to plan accordingly. I was supposed to go June 3rd, which was a Grad Night day, and decided to switch it because of the possibility of increased capacity. I already have the 60th Anniversary crowd to worry about. Hope this helps."

Aside from adding to the wait times by 15-25 minutes, they could get a little annoying when they're in packs. At 10 DCA closes and only gradnight wristband wearers are allowed in, you will find a lot of kids just running like hell from Disneyland to DCA at that time. Rides will be fullest around 9-10 at Disneyland because everyone wants to ride the main ones before going to DCA."
Disneyland,35wy17,VersaceTupperware,1 point,Sun May 17 08:15:17 2015 UTC,Yes yes yes basically.  There will be a ton of kids and at some point like 8pm or so you have to have a grad wrist band to ride any rides. They might actually make you even leave the park. I'm not sure cause when that ride cut off hit I left anyway.
Disneyland,35wy17,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Thu May 14 15:18:20 2015 UTC,I was there last year and they just started playing some music over the loudspeakers about Grad night and people just started filing out.

Disneyland,35wxj8,Techsupportvictim,5,Thu May 14 04:56:12 2015 UTC,"To get a World of Color fastpass, head over to the Grizzly River Run Fastpass distribution center. Those are the machines used for distribution.  For Fantasmic, go behind Big Thunder Mountain Railroad next to Big Thunder Ranch, and there will be Fastpass carts set up along the trail. You can get Fastpasses there.  All you need is a park ticket that has been scanned in to that specific park. These fastpasses are ""off the grid"" meaning that you will still be able to get fastpasses for other attractions while holding these fastpasses. On the fastpass, there is a viewing area ""color"" which indicates which section of the viewing area you are in. And there is also a return time printed for when they will open up the viewing area, or in some cases, lead you to the viewing area. Make sure to pay attention to the location printed on the fastpass, which is where guests with that specific viewing section need to queue to get into the viewing area.   Have fun!"

As far as exactly what they get you, it's basically just entrance to the ""official"" viewing areas for the shows. If you want to be in the big plaza in front of paradise bay for WoC you need a FP (you can be on the bridge without a pass) and if you want to be directly in front of any of the Fantasmic water ""screen"" you need a FP.   What they don't get you is a guaranteed good spot for the show just access to the area. For example last time we saw fantasmic we were so far to the left that we were unable to see some of the effects on the island (we had a blue fastpass and were basically infront of the HM).   No matter what color you get you should get to the area the moment they open it (time will be printed on the FP, usually about an hour before the show) for the best possible viewing location."

Disneyland,35uo6x,Kierz10TheRaven,9,Wed May 13 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"For us (Northern California Premium AP holders), it ends up paying for itself between two and three days spent in DL/DCA depending on how much food and merchandise we buy each trip.  This is pretty typical for us in a given year, so it works out.  One way we ""recoup"" a little faster is by going with larger groups that don't have them and then sharing the discounts with them, although obviously that doesn't benefit us directly.  For us it's just a drive (usually 6 hours), so we don't have to pay for airfare and it's relatively quick to get there so there's not a huge time investment for travel time, so getting there from Montana is going to be a bit of a drag on things for you.

I feel like I get more value - being able to pop in the park the day I arrive, I don't feel like I waste $100 dollars on only four or five hours in the park.  Plus I also try to plan my trips during the deadest times of the year to get even more value out of it.    Also as someone else said, plan the purchase of the AP accordingly so it doesn't expire before you plan to take another trip."

Heck, we dropped in one time on the way back from San Diego just to have turkey legs and people watch for a while.  Plus, and there's no price on this: it removes pressure.  You don't feel like you have only one full day in the park and that you have to squeeze something out of every moment you're in the parks, and we actually feel like we get to relax and enjoy the whole experience more."
Disneyland,35uo6x,StevesRealAccount,8,Fri May 15 07:45:50 2015 UTC,"I'm an out of state WDW AP holder, but the same general tips should apply. If you can't schedule a couple of trips, take two during your AP year.  Ie: get the AP in Oct. with a trip, then take your next trip in Sep, before the AP expires. Save on merch at the parks with the AP. Look for where you get AP discounts on food. If you stay at a DLR hotel, use the AP discounts."
Disneyland,35uo6x,MonorailBlack,3,Wed May 13 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Do you find that you save money this way? For example, we use GetAwayToday and stay in good neighbor hotels in an attempt to save money. So we make our stay 3-5 days long and that is our trip for the year (or years depending on finances,taxes, etc.)"
Disneyland,35uo6x,Darthcholo,7,Wed May 13 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"We live in Arizona and usually make it out about five times a year.  Sometimes we stay at a hotel and sometimes we stay with relatives.  We plan the trips around school breaks; spring break, memorial day, fourth of july, winter break and christmas break.  We save money on the parking for us and whoever goes to the park with us.  Also at least 20% off merch for ourselves and whoever is at the park with us.  I just wish we could do the payment plan like SoCal residents do."
Disneyland,35uo6x,catscatscatsCORGIaww,2,Wed May 13 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"^ are you me? We do the same. I like going at least once at christmas every year, so if I know I will be going in the summer/spring then at christmas I buy an AP. I like having the AP because if we come in around 2-3PM we can go to the park for a few hours without wasting an entire day ticket. Plus you can enjoy the park at a slower pace, when you know you can come back whenever."
Disneyland,35uo6x,chicklette,4,Thu May 14 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"I have an annual pass and live in NorCal.  We got the top-level pass because we are often visiting during black out dates.  For us, we visit socal 3-5x a year to see family.  We visit family during the day and hit the parks at night.  If we are in town for more than 2-3 days, we will often take an extra day just for the parks.  Also, my grandmother is elderly and having us visit so many days in a row tends to wear her out, so I like to give it a break in between if I can.  It's worth it to us to not have to feel rushed, or like we have to see and do everything in one day.  We go for 3-6 hours at a time, take breaks, go to downtown disney for dinner, etc.  We also really take advantage of the AP discounts.  We saved quite a bit using our discount on the last trip."
Disneyland,35uo6x,chicklette,2,Wed May 13 19:36:52 2015 UTC,We feel the same way about rushing. We like to take our time and feel free to come and go throughout the day. That's why the AP sounds so so so appealing. Thanks for the info!
Disneyland,35uo6x,Shatteredreality,3,Wed May 13 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"For us, it made the difference between my husband loving and hating the parks.  It's so much more fun when you can just relax."
Disneyland,35uo6x,SmartestDumbTeen,6,Wed May 13 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"It all depends how often/when you go and how much you spend at the resort.   If you go once a year on a weekend and bring your own food it won't be worth it.   Annual passes for non-SoCal residents start at 550/person (799 for the higher level). If you are going to go to the park 2 times a year for 3 days each trip the prices break even (3 day park hoppers are 225, so going 2 times would be 550/year) plus you get the discount on food and merch (10% off).    If you want to go on dates that are blacked out for the deluxe pass (FRI-SUN on Holiday Weekends, Fri-Sat through most of the summer, weekends in the holiday season) then you would need the Premium pass at 799/person. You get better discounts (20% Food, 15% Merch) and free parking (17/day) and no blackout dates.   Premium is a better value if you are going 3 times a year for 3 days each trip.    One other tip is it might be worth while to get one premium pass and one deluxe if you don't want to go on blacked out days. For the extra 250 you get free parking (17/day so if you go 2 times per year for three days it's $102) Then if you spend a decent amount on food or merch it can still break even."
Disneyland,35uo6x,sergemeister,2,Wed May 13 21:16:11 2015 UTC,Good to keep in mind. Thanks for breaking it down like that.
Disneyland,35uo6x,bubblesugarsocks,2,Wed May 13 21:30:04 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, most summer Fridays are open for the deluxe pass so that might seem a bit more reasonable."
Disneyland,35uo6x,MonorailBlack,4,Thu May 14 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"As someone that also lives in Arizona, it is hard to make it out there several times a year. If you have kids and a job it becomes really tough. School and work schedules interfere all the time, the planning that it takes to arrange a hotel stay is also a huge factor. You would think living a 6 hours east of Anaheim would be a cake walk and that we could waltz over anytime but it becomes a bigger logistical hurdle than that. Sorry to be the buzzkill, but it seems that the hurdle would only be that much bigger if you lived in Montana. Especially since it's a 20 hour drive."
Disneyland,35uo6x,lem0nster,2,Wed May 13 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. However, I think we plan on flying down whenever we visit the parks unless we tack on an extra adventure of driving down the coast line. We don't know what jobs we will have in Montana just yet. I currently do freelance design work and can work from home (or Starbucks haha) so that's a nice leisure to be able to take my work along with me. Thanks for your input!"
Disneyland,35uo6x,CanYou_Not,4,Wed May 13 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"I live about 6 hours away. Unless I'm not responsible for gas or paying for our hotel, I never go for less than 3-4 days at a time. I stay with friends as much as possible (I know quite a few APs in the area and have other friends and family that don't mind hosting me) to cut down hotel cost, as well as enrolling in a few hotel rewards programs so that when I do pay, it's earning me free nights or points. Disneyland is also where I and my friends celebrate most of our ""big"" moments (birthdays, holidays, personal milestones) so our passes get a lot of use every few months."
Disneyland,35uo6x,CanYou_Not,3,Wed May 13 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"It will save you money if you were planning on taking multiple trips in a span close to a year apart. By making them only 11 months or so apart, you can save on tickets, etc. Only problem is, if you have the passes, you may want to make more trips than that."
Disneyland,35uo6x,_treebeard,3,Wed May 13 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"I have the DL/WDW AP and live in Maryland, but my family still lives in SoCal. One of the main family gatherings we do is at DLR or WDW, and so we tend to schedule family trips to one of the two locations. Since I tend to go during the Holidays to visit, as well as for the RunDisney races, the AP gives me access to those, and gets me into the park."
Disneyland,35uo6x,Vidogo,3,Wed May 13 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"We live in AZ as well. We did the math and last year with our AP we saved over $1000 with the pass. One 3-day trip and it basically pays for itself.   A lot of the good neighbor hotels also offer AP discounts. Some all the time, some just run specials.   The savings I mentioned was purely on tickets. That doesn't even include our food and hotel savings. If we were smart we would have upgraded to the Premier since we did WDW for 5 days, but I slacked on that one.  Moving to Montana might make it a bit more difficult, but even a one week trip and I think it makes it worth it!"
Disneyland,35uo6x,CanYou_Not,2,Wed May 13 20:38:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for estimated cost savings! That really helps put it into perspective. I know airfare and such will make a difference since we will no longer be 6 hours away but seeing that it really does make a difference in someway is good to know. Thank you!

Even Roger Rabbit's ride is too small for my long legs.   It's cute and I want to like it, but it needs a paint job and some food before I'll put up with the screaming to venture in. But the kids love it and it is the perfect place to let them run around."
Disneyland,35v9tr,YouDontKnowMeHa,13,Wed May 13 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt Critter Country. With Splash Mountain and The Hungry Bear, ToonTown doesn't stand a chance."

Unless I'm going with someone who has never been before, I just skip it everytime.  Critter Country also has one of my favorite quiet relaxing spots . I will get food from Hungry Bear and just go chill there. It's a lovely break in my day ."
Disneyland,35v9tr,orangefreshy,3,Wed May 13 22:23:48 2015 UTC,Critter Country! Most of my memories of going with my family as a kid are of Country Bear Jamboree and the Hungry Bear :>
Disneyland,35v9tr,robobreasts,3,Thu May 14 05:41:49 2015 UTC,"I actually LIKE Toon Town, because my kids love Gadget's Go Coaster.  They didn't like Roger Rabbit, and they are too old for the houses and stuff, but the ambiance is nice.  Critter County has Splash Mountain, which they haven't gone on yet, but it also has Winnie-the-Pooh which they love.  So it's actually a hard call...  I guess Critter Country, because they will probably ride Splash Mountain next time we go, and the candy shop at the end of Winnie-the-Pooh is pretty nice."
Disneyland,35v9tr,incride,3,Wed May 13 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"Critter Country has a Mountain, a great restaurant, and a meet and greet.  ToonTown has gone way downhill. Since the closing of Chip 'n Dale Treehouse, the Toontown trolley, all the food stands,  everything just needs a fresh coat of paint, and there relatively no shade."

Disneyland,35v9tr,RetroGamer42,2,Wed May 13 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"Critter Country.  If I had kids it might be ToonTown.  ToonTown's sole redeeming feature in my eyes is the Roger Rabbit ride, wheras Critter Country has Winnie the Pooh and the amazing fudge."

""hey, let's go to mickey's house, kids, then we'll go.""  none of us thought it would be anything other than walking through, see goofy stuff.  and the kids laughed and saw the glove in the washing machine, walked through, stood in the theater of a second, opened the next door hoping to get out and there's mickey himself.  both boys (4 and 6) stood awestruck.  the handlers and mickey spent about 10 minutes with them and just them.  no one else in the room.   They talk about it to this day, and it's fueled the ""maybe something great will happen in the next 30 seconds"" for them since."

Also a lot of schools buy 1 or 2 day passes for the students, so the parks will be full of unsupervised teenagers for the better part of that week."
Disneyland,35va5j,ghost209,3,Thu May 14 00:31:03 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, you will be able to enter the parks normally during the daytime, but in general the park will close earlier and some evening shows might be canceled those nights."
Disneyland,35va5j,ghost209,3,Thu May 14 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think they close the park early for Grad Night anymore.  I was told that ""Grad Night"" was an all day park hopper pass, and then a party at DCA after it closes at its normal time at 10pm.    I'm staying at the Grand Californian for a few days at the end of the month which includes a Grad Night day, so I'll find out for certain then."

We could come whenever we wanted to, the school decided on coming around 2pm in a bus. We were instructed to be in DCA by 9pm and around that time the CMs were going from one end of the park in sort of a line, checking for wristbands. They slowly pushed out the regular guests until at around 10:30 the whole park was clear and it was just gradnight people. They had a special world of color intro show and then everyone was free to do whatever until around 2-3am when it closed."

Disneyland,35uyev,thebuggalo,1 point,Wed May 13 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"There's quite a few things you can expect actually. Unfortunately though, Disneyland, if correct, will be closed at 7:30 prior for the 60th Celebration. Sleeping beauty's castle has been given the diamond treatment and as we speak they are doing the same to Carthay Circle. They also added a couple of small touches to World of Disney, the ice cream shop on main street (Sorry, forgot the name) and a couple other shops around. Hatbox Ghost is there and it thee coolest of them all (Opinion). Matterhorn will stay closed until the 22nd. I'm not sure about soarin, you may know more than I do on that one. But you'll have a great time in sure."
Disneyland,35uyev,ChetsWorthFonzo,1 point,Wed May 13 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! 7:30pm close on Sunday? The park hours on their website say midnight for Sunday. If they close at 7:30 that would be a big disappointment but good to know in advance. So the castle already has the decorations up?
Disneyland,35uyev,ChetsWorthFonzo,2,Wed May 13 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"If the park closes at midnight then they might postpone the firework testing / parade run for another day or a few hours after midnight.

Disneyland,35uyev,mikeezy6,1 point,Wed May 13 20:49:30 2015 UTC,"Firework testing are scheduled on specific days they aren't just testing every day, and to my knowledge their testing schedule they are slated to test the fireworks five times before the actual premiere on the 24 hour day. And also when they do test its on weekdays. They never test over the weekends."
Disneyland,35uyev,jch708,1 point,Thu May 14 04:11:01 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'd say just check out some of the decorations. The park has done a really great job with some of the stanchions and lightpole garments. I was there on Saturday and hadn't been since March and the difference in the overall look of the park was spectacularly night-and-day.  Also, Hatbox is brilliant and a must see. Soarin should be up by the time you're there, but see this post for more on that (excited to see what's new there, and I think that Grizzly Peak is going to look great (also will be nice to just be able to flow through the Grizzly/Grand Californian Area as a whole again).   tl;dr - Diamonds everywhere, Hatbox is rad, Soarin/Grizzly Peak should be cool"

Disneyland,35swnh,Mathavian,3,Thu May 14 00:56:38 2015 UTC,"As stated already, you should be fine. For the last anniversary (the golden 50th), decorations and special shows lasted for a full eighteen months after it started. Given the investment needed to create these shows and decorations, I doubt TDA would cut the celebration off prematurely. You should be good for at least a year after it starts, maybe more."
Disneyland,35swnh,DDotJ,3,Wed May 13 17:24:21 2015 UTC,"These shows will probably stick around long after the decorations are taken down. RDCT (fireworks show) debuted for the 50th anniversary and just went into retirement a few months ago to make way for the 60th Anniversary show Disneyland Forever. I'm guessing WoC:C might do that as well. And Paint The Night isn't going to be replaced by anything anytime soon so that should stick around for a long time as well.  These shows took a lot of $$$ to develop, and countless hours of work from the entertainment team. It would be incredibly wasteful on Disney's part to only have it sticking around for a short time. These shows will probably stick around for a good 5-10 years. I wonder if Magical is ever coming back...  And merchandise will almost certainly still be available in September."

Disneyland,35slq8,sister4sale,3,Wed May 13 04:00:50 2015 UTC,"Do they look like this? (Your color and character may vary, of course.)  If so, then yes, those are your actual tickets. You don't have to trade them or anything. Have fun!"
Disneyland,35slq8,TalithaRabboni,3,Wed May 13 04:18:53 2015 UTC,Yes that's them!
Disneyland,35slq8,stevensokulski,1 point,Wed May 13 06:34:54 2015 UTC,Then you're good! Head straight to the entrance of whichever park you're entering and have a great time!
Disneyland,35slq8,CletusTSJY,2,Wed May 13 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"If they're on regular 8 1/2 x 11 paper then you exchange them at the turnstile for small card-like tickets (but they're still basically paper, which is why there is some confusion)."

Disneyland,35r15z,readyfuels,5,Tue May 12 20:16:49 2015 UTC,Luckily saw this on the Disney Parks Twitter and managed to get into World of Color with a +1. A friend went to do the same and registration was already closed. Less than five minutes... crazy.
Disneyland,35r15z,bubblesugarsocks,2,Tue May 12 20:17:34 2015 UTC,I'm so excited to see Paint the Night!!! I've never typed my name and address so fast!
Disneyland,35r15z,dodgepodge,3,Tue May 12 20:21:38 2015 UTC,I was driving when the event was posted and missed it :(

Disneyland,35q5l5,laikapet,2,Tue May 12 17:23:13 2015 UTC,I'll be there with my girlfriend. Sounds like the first weekend in June is gonna be a big night for out-of-towners.
Disneyland,35q5l5,Hyro0o0,3,Tue May 12 19:29:36 2015 UTC,Right on! Have fun!

Disneyland,35s2qs,keti24,2,Wed May 13 01:11:38 2015 UTC,Yes Cafe Orleans is sit down only. You sometimes get in without a reservation but you may have to wait.  Monte Cristo is amazing. They have the Mickey Beignets with cream and jam which I love.
Disneyland,35s2qs,Techsupportvictim,2,Wed May 13 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can ever predict when Push will be out there. I think I last saw him two years ago. Maybe more.  You're never going to get a better view of the fireworks than the Hub. I don't know of anyone who watches from Pixie Hollow -- I think trees block your view of the castle, which would be the whole point of standing so close."
Disneyland,35pauq,luckhaveit4me,5,Tue May 12 12:10:21 2015 UTC,It's not as big so be prepared for that.   Wear comfy shoes.   Read here a lot. Especially before you ask a question. They have almost all been answered at least twice.   Park hopper is your friend.   Watch for Halloween tickets to go on sale if you want to go to that. They sell out super fast
Disneyland,35pauq,Techsupportvictim,6,Tue May 12 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"There was actually a pretty good podcast on Disneyland for first timers by Mousetalgia for first time visitors. In terms of crowds it's pretty much your best bet to go counterclockwise as Tomorrow Land will fill up the fastest (between Star Tours, Space Mountain and Astro Blasters), then head over to frontier land for Big Thunder Mountain, then finish off in Frontier Land.  If you're planning on going multiple days (which I guess you might be since it sounds like a fairly big trip), I think it affords you a lot more time, but if everything's open at both parks (DL and DCA) I think you can get it done in about 2-3 days.  If I were planning a trip for first timers to go in 2 days this is what I would do:  Day 1: start off at tomorrow land with Space Mountain and Star Tours, then get on over to Frontier Land for an Indiana Jones fast pass, then hit Big Thunder Mountain. This would get you to approximately lunch time, so after Indy (or before, depending on the fast pass timeframe), I would stop by the New Orleans Square for lunch and some beignets. You'll be right next to the haunted mansion, so that should be your next stop. From there you can hit up California Adventure and maybe take in either the Tower of Terror or California Screamin' (and grab a fast pass for the other). Fill this up with some casual walking around and I think this takes you through dinner time, maybe with time to do Goofy's sky school or something.  Day 2: You've already hit up a lot of the big rides, but you're still missing the Matterhorn and Splash Mountain. You also have all of Fantasy Land to explore, as well as Toon Town. The rides and attractions in these lands are, in my opinion, very child oriented so I think you can skip them if you want.  Also, if you're going on a day that'll be empty you have a LOT more time to do everything than I've outlined here. You should  check the isitcrowded.com calendar for details.. my fiance and I have been on ""ghost town"" days and we can pretty much hop on 1 attraction every 30 minutes or so."
Disneyland,35pauq,clamchauda,1 point,Tue May 12 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"If you follow this great plan, for Day 2 do all of Fantasyland first thing in the morning. Some of the longest lines in the park with some of the most untouched line queues can make for an exhausting thing later in the day."
Disneyland,35pauq,jch708,3,Thu May 14 04:37:44 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on going to a Halloween Party while you're there? You need a separate ticket for entry, so make sure you watch for those. If you aren't planning on going, make sure you plan around the party days - the park closes early for them.  I don't think WDW has the Indiana Jones ride, so make sure you check that out - it's a great ride!  Trader Sam's is also definitely worth a visit! It's not in Disneyland itself, it's a Tiki Bar beside the Disneyland Hotel - it's really fun. Definitely something worth visiting.   edit:words"
Disneyland,35pauq,Sarroarr,2,Tue May 12 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Is that the whole month of October? How much is that separate ticket and is it worth experiencing?
Disneyland,35pauq,clamchauda,2,Tue May 12 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"I've been to two of them now and I think it's actually pretty fun. The ticket prices fluctuate depending on the days (for example a Tuesday is cheaper than a Saturday). Off the top of my head the park closes later (around 6 or 7 for the event), but you can come in early at around 3.  As a bonus, you get to wear a costume!"
Disneyland,35pauq,Sarroarr,2,Tue May 12 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"It starts at the end of September and goes into October. They haven't officially released the dates for the party yet, but they're usually 2-3 days a week and I'm fairly certain every Friday is included in one of those days.  I think the separate ticket is $70ish - it allows you entry into the part after 3pm and the park will close to anyone without a ticket at 5pm or 6pm depending on the day.  It's pretty cool, you get to come to the park in costume (you don't have to dress up though if that's not your thing), there's special fireworks, trick or treat stations, dance parties and a special Halloween themed parade. The villains also make appearances around Main Street which is awesome. I went last year and I had a great time."
Disneyland,35pauq,Sarroarr,3,Tue May 12 15:18:55 2015 UTC,I just may HAVE to do this since I'm SPLURGING on this big trip :) Thanks for letting me know!
Disneyland,35pauq,mamamonkey,2,Tue May 12 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"Do it!! It's a really cool way to experience Disneyland :) the tickets for the party usually go on sale mid to late July, so make sure you watch for that - depending on the date you plan to go, the tickets can sell out pretty quick :)"
Disneyland,35pauq,run-lola-run,2,Tue May 12 15:24:11 2015 UTC,Trader Sam's MAY have been the entire reason we're staying at the Disneyland Hotel on our next trip.  It's a riot. So much fun!
Disneyland,35pauq,eternity26,3,Thu May 14 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"IMHO, DL has better versions of Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Pirates, and Buzz Lightyear. California Adventure's Radiator Springs Racers is not to be missed! Get a Fastpass for it FIRST THING. I was recently at DL on a not-too-crowded day, picked up a Fastpass at 10AM that had a 4:30PM return time. They sell out quick! Also keep in mind that the RSRacers Fastpass kiosks are not next to the ride. They house them by the Bugs Life theater in the middle of the park... If they are out of Fastpasses, try the singles line. If you want to ride single on Splash Mountain, just enter thru the exit and they'll let you on. There is also an un-marked singles line for the Matterhorn. A cast member will hand you a piece of paper and let you in. If you're planning on hopping between the parks, the Fastpass systems aren't connected - you can have one FP from each park at a time. It's easy to take advantage of if you don't mind walking a lot. (DL is still on the old paper Fastpass system.) My cousin and I recently hit ever major attraction (and then some) in both parks in one day... though my Fitbit registered over 35,000 steps. :) The Peoplemover track is still in Tomorrowland, but there's no Peoplemover :(((   Have a great time!"
Disneyland,35pauq,ruffyamaharyder,1 point,Tue May 12 17:07:26 2015 UTC,Thanks I'm a passholder  and didn't know you could have a fast pass in both parks.  I don't mind all the walking.  It's better then standing!
Disneyland,35pauq,YoeSafBridge,2,Tue May 12 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, not as big, but you can easily jump from park to park and almost all the big rides in one day. Take the parks in as a whole - it will be fun noting the little differences in the rides that appear in DLR and WDW so don't skip any.    I'm sorry you'll have to see the Haunted Mansion not themed for Halloween, but rather themed for Christmas time."
Disneyland,35pauq,Be_Are,2,Tue May 12 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"It'll still be an experience since I've never seen either park at Christmas time, only during the summer months :)"
Disneyland,35pauq,gec44-9w,2,Tue May 12 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"It is beautiful at Christmas, though I have to admit, things are less lit up than they were when I was really little. Of course, then there were millions of teeny lights, now there are still thousands, so it is still great.  I just remember being a wee one and just crazy about all the twinkly lights."

Disneyland,35r9gn,Mathavian,2,Wed May 13 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"I feel as though the hype was more extreme for the 50th. They aren't going as ""all out"" as they did then (repainting classic ride vehicles gold, etc)."
Disneyland,35mybu,holapenguin,12,Mon May 11 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"If you're wondering how to ride the Lilly Belle, you have to stop by the Main Street train station and ask the conductor for a ticket.  They'll take your name down and tell you when to come back to ride.   The Lilly Belle isn't always running and the tickets are limited on a first-come, first serve basis.  So you just have to be early and lucky!"

Disneyland,35mybu,Be_Are,3,Tue May 12 16:48:13 2015 UTC,I've been doing that every trip and so far no go. But I keep trying. I might even on 24 hour day if I get to go. Since I don't have a car and the buses won't start running until 7:30 I'm stuck for a bit. Figured I'd try to hit Denny's for coffee and breakfast since they should be open. If I'm not dead on my feet I might pop back over at gate time just to see if it's running on the 23rd. If it's not a long wait I can do that and then go home
Disneyland,35mybu,jaredxd,2,Tue May 12 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"I admire your persistence! Hang in there, it'll pay off eventually!"

Disneyland,35mybu,billypowergamer,2,Tue May 12 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"I think I still have space in my car. So if you want to get there earlier, I might be able to give you a ride to the park, depending on how close you are, or if you're on the way. I'm driving down from Los Angeles."
Disneyland,35mybu,Kagalli,2,Tue May 12 16:33:28 2015 UTC,How did you get the button! I want one of those. I'm going tomorrow!
Disneyland,35mybu,arobotamongus,2,Tue May 12 03:57:08 2015 UTC,It seems like an entirely random thing.  My son got one on our last trip after doing Tower of Terror 5 times in a row from the CM that we got the ride photos from.  The CM was surprised that he was so young (6 years old) and was so excited to keep going on it.
Disneyland,35mybu,Von32,2,Tue May 12 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"It can be somewhat random if a CM decides you've done something special to deserve it. You can also ask for the button directly, but you have to correctly answer a really difficult Disney trivia question to get it!  My best friend and I got one each when we went up to ask for ""I'm Celebrating!"" buttons. The CM made a comment about how he was trying to get rid of more ""I'm Celebrating"" buttons, and I commented back about how everyone should be celebrating something. He ended up giving us the Honorary Citizen buttons for being ""so nice."" :)"

Disneyland,35mybu,chandelure,1 point,Tue May 12 16:32:46 2015 UTC,Same with me. I was told they weren't doing it anymore. I guess they are.
Disneyland,35mybu,NWSanta,5,Tue May 12 06:28:50 2015 UTC,"I went on it today too! It was so relaxing and interesting riding in it and learning a few facts about the Lilly Belle.   Honestly, I didn't know the Lilly Belle existed until today because my girlfriend wanted to ride in it."
Disneyland,35mybu,helloheartbreak,5,Tue May 12 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"For those wondering, in order to ride the Lilly Belle, you need to enter the park at rope drop and line up at the train station. Let the CMs at the front know you are there to make a reservation to ride the Lilly Belle. You'll have to wait for one hour in line.  You have to show up that early because that is when people start lining up, but they don't take reservations until an hour after park opening. They do 3 rides throughout the day and only if the conditions are right. It can't be hotter than 90 F and no rain basically.  Also as a tip, if you ask to sign the guest book and see the photo album, they'll take them out of the center table if you're lucky!"

Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,20,Tue May 12 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've been to the last three  24hr events, best time to arrive/be in line is after 6am  Friday morning (parked car, and ticket in hand). The lines to Dland and DCA are not terribly long as you'd imagine at 6am, tickets don't sell out that early either. The majority of the crowd comes in after 12 and the parks reach capacity around 2. This is from personal experiences. :)  good luck!"
Disneyland,35o7x8,PBI325,6,Tue May 12 07:37:51 2015 UTC,We planned out our first year (2013) and were on the buses at 6:30am! We got to ride everything we wanted to by like 8:30am and then just cruised and people watched the rest of the day. If you get in early I would agree that it's really not that bad. Just have to plan on doing nothing during the middle of the day.
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,3,Tue May 12 20:44:14 2015 UTC,I'm rather planning to use the middle of the day to rest and catch shows. I go once a month so other than the new Soarin and Haunted Mansion there are no rides I just have to ride. And they are on the top of my list so they will likely be done by noon or so.   Mainly this will be my shot to see world of color and such. I never get to cause of having to catch the bus by 9pm to be able to get home.   And I want to see the new parade. hopefully it will run 3/4 times during the evening and night and I get one good shot at taping it for my family overseas. They love my show videos.
Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,2,Thu May 14 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"Loll exactly what we do too. It's kind of nice to just people watch, especially when it was hot out! It really isn't that crazy in the mornings :)"
Disneyland,35o7x8,vanillavanille,4,Tue May 12 21:58:24 2015 UTC,Once they hit capacity do you remember about how long it takes for them to re-open? I had a special lunch plan for me and my friend around then but were planning on coming back and sticking for the night... I also really don't wanna miss the parade :'(
Disneyland,35o7x8,waterfox17,4,Tue May 12 14:05:33 2015 UTC,"Once they hit capacity, they hold the line at the entry gates.  After a certain number of people have left (which I believe is in an increment under 100), they'll let that exact number into the park from the entry gate line.  It all depends on how fast people leave.  Make sure that if you have lunch plans at a Table Service restaurant, that you have a reservation.  I'd make that reservation ASAP on Disney Dining, if I were you."
Disneyland,35o7x8,vanillavanille,2,Wed May 13 01:52:32 2015 UTC,"It wasn't at the parks :( it was this cute Taiwanese food place called Milk and Honey nearby. She's always wanted to try the food from there so I was going to take her there, then come back around 2 or 3. Looks like I'm gonna have to revise that (and I can't go early because they open at noon...)."
Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,2,Wed May 13 14:01:29 2015 UTC,What time do they close? :) perhaps you could go that route if it doesn't interfere with the parade!
Disneyland,35o7x8,vanillavanille,3,Thu May 14 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"They actually don't close until midnight! I'm thinking instead, we'll eat lunch inside the park, and after fireworks leave and go eat at the other place, and wait to come back until the morning, when things finally start dying down."

Disneyland,35o7x8,LTAN33DAR,7,Fri May 15 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to know as well, I gotta drop off my GF at the airport around noon (in San Diego), and was gonna spend the rest of the day there.  I wanted to see if I could try to get in and if at capacity hang around downtown Disney until they reopened. I just didn't want to waste a 2 hour drive if I get shut out completely."
Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,4,Tue May 12 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"I wish you luck!! It will most likely be nuts around the time you could swing by... I think you could come into the park, but the reason we parked hopped from Dland to DCA was because the crowd was insane, you literally had to walk against fences and find air by the  CM only entrances..."
Disneyland,35o7x8,EnglishMobster,3,Tue May 12 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the crowd levels. They might reopen once enough people have left, but that won't be until the wee hours of the morning, probably after the fireworks and both Paint the Nights. I don't have exact knowledge of the process, unfortunately. :("
Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,4,Tue May 12 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"When they hit capacity last time, I remember CMs said 2-3 hours during their peak hours (We were park hopping at 3pmish and hopped back to Dland around 9pm).  Every year though, they try to corral the crowd and implement new strategies to make people happy heh. It could be different this year, but who knows :/  I'd advise to stay through the parade, then leave and come back lol"
Disneyland,35o7x8,Bijanadactyl,3,Tue May 12 22:01:50 2015 UTC,So getting there around 9-10am won't stop us from getting in? My brother and I are AP holders flying into Santa Ana at 7:45AM that morning and have to drop stuff off at a hotel before we head over.
Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,2,Wed May 13 08:11:26 2015 UTC,"I want to say you'll get in guaranteed, but...I'm pretty sure you will. Park capacity doesn't happen often in the wee hours of the morning, mostly after school hours and when parents decide to skip work lol. It was a decent crowd at 10am but not crazy, I was able to get breakfast in 15 mins at River Belle and find a table."
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,2,Thu May 14 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"That sounds like my game plan will be possible. I'm hoping to be there just before 6, 7 at the latest. Grab a locker. Pop into DL to see if the Lilly Belle is running and get fantasmic fast pass. Maybe try to ride haunted mansion before it gets crazy lines. Then pop over to DCA for world of color fast pass and breakfast.   I was worried there would already be a crowd that early and it wouldn't be possible"

Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,2,Mon May 18 18:19:49 2015 UTC,You go to the Main Street station first thing and ask if there are tickets. They don't run it every trip or end every day.
Disneyland,35o7x8,MrFinch8604,1 point,Mon May 18 19:10:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! I never knew that
Disneyland,35o7x8,DDotJ,2,Mon May 18 20:13:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Do you know how park hopping works when the parks reach capacity?
Disneyland,35o7x8,gussiubao,2,Sat May 16 07:03:05 2015 UTC,"That, I have no idea, sorries."
Disneyland,35o7x8,robinsparkles87,2,Sat May 16 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"So, when I went the day after Christmas, BOTH parks reached capacity at 2:00 PM. When we asked a cast member how that would effect us and our party (my husband and I are pass holders, our party had park hoppers) they said as long as we scanned into both parks before the capacity was reached, we were allowed to come and go as we pleased. However, I am not sure how that will work for the 24 hour event."
Disneyland,35o7x8,waterfox17,14,Sun May 17 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"The parks can (and likely will) reach capacity repeatedly throughout the day.  From experience (as a CM) working the last few, best time to come is from midnight to 6am.  People start giving up and going home around 2-3am or so."
Disneyland,35o7x8,VersaceTupperware,6,Tue May 12 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"what about around 10am-4pm, or is that the peak?"
Disneyland,35o7x8,waterfox17,9,Tue May 12 07:19:40 2015 UTC,"That's definitely peak.  It's gonna be long lines, or a shutout.  People start lining up to get in reeeeeally early for opening, and it just gets worse from there."
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,3,Tue May 12 07:29:46 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm hoping to get in, get my fast passes for the shows and do my two must go rides by 10-11. Then just wander, people watch, check the street shows etc.  I don't generally bother with trying to get photos with characters, so I just stand to the side and try to catch the in between of folks. Generally I can get a decent shot."
Disneyland,35o7x8,Rdubya44,4,Thu May 14 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"This is good to know, hopefully we'll get there early enough to get in on Friday."
Disneyland,35o7x8,PBI325,3,Tue May 12 09:26:43 2015 UTC,"I believe you couldnt even get in at 10am last year, gates were closed. So yes, it would be a literal zoo around then!"
Disneyland,35o7x8,sunshinedaisy,3,Tue May 12 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"I don't remember it hitting capacity last year, or having trouble reentrring the park, though I do think it'll happen this year. If I were to unknowingly leave DCA to hop over to DL and it was at capacity would I be out of luck?"
Disneyland,35o7x8,waterfox17,5,Tue May 12 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what's going to happen, yes.  Due to Fire Marshal laws, they can't allow in ANYONE over capacity.  Disneyland is more likely to reach it than DCA.  I don't personally know who you would be able to ask to get information before you leave, either.  My best guess (and recommended course of action) would be to talk to the ticketing CMs at the EXIT of the park (there should be a few administering hand stamps) before you leave, asking if the other one is at capacity.  They /should/ be able to reach someone with that information, if they themselves don't know."
Disneyland,35o7x8,PapaFranzBoas,1 point,Wed May 13 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"Any suggestions on the best ""slow"" time to go? Would 3-4 am be good?"
Disneyland,35o7x8,waterfox17,1 point,Fri May 22 04:55:56 2015 UTC,"3-4am's usually pretty safe.  In DCA, things really slow down after 2am.  Radiator Springs Racers had a 15 minute line from 2am to close, if that's any indication."
Disneyland,35o7x8,imperialbeach,2,Fri May 22 11:03:13 2015 UTC,"I'm getting nervous about it hitting cap, since my fiance, sister in law, and I are all planning to go after work. I live in San Diego ava expect to get up here by 8pm or do lb Friday."
Disneyland,35o7x8,EnglishMobster,12,Sat May 16 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"This will probably be one of the most packed 24-hour events ever. This is the premiere of 3 new amazingly designed shows. The park will hit capacity, and it may remain that way until after the 3AM WOC show."
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,10,Tue May 12 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"Disneyland is supposed to be packed until 1:30 AM at the earliest. Expect to have parade ropes up with CMs directing traffic for the majority of the day on the 22nd. I believe the 23rd will also be very crowded to the extent that CMs will be there to direct traffic.  Please, listen to the CMs and go the direction they tell you to go, even if it'll take you out of your way. Ignoring them in a crowded environment can endanger your own safety as well as potentially the safety of others in the crowd.  It may seem like something is a more direct route, but swimming ""upstream"" to get there can slow you down, or there may be a safety reason why you're being directed down a certain pathway.  Expect to take roundabout routes to your destinations, and expect certain areas to be hard to get to due to crowding."
Disneyland,35o7x8,PBI325,2,Tue May 12 21:46:44 2015 UTC,Worst are folks that don't keep walking. I remember trying to get around during the Christmas fireworks. CMs were trying to keep walkways clear and folks would just stop and decide that's where they were going to watch.  I've started trying to watch from the train stations or the Ranch cause folks aren't jerks around there
Disneyland,35o7x8,PapaFranzBoas,1 point,Thu May 14 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Expect to take roundabout routes to your destinations, and expect certain areas to be hard to get to due to crowding.   Last time I was at the park that some Disneyland CMs opened up a side path that I'd never seen by the end of the parade route. It went behind all of the shops on the right hand side of main street and popped you out at the medical center/corn dog stand at the end of main street. Wonder if it will be open again, it was cool!"
Disneyland,35o7x8,EnglishMobster,1 point,Thu May 21 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"I realize I'm 10 days late on this thread. But is there an expected ""slow"" time? My wife and I live close and I was wanting to hit it up at it's slowest."
Disneyland,35o7x8,PapaFranzBoas,1 point,Fri May 22 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"Usually, yes. This year, however, it's not looking like there will be a slow time. Perhaps after 3 AM or so? The problem with coming in late is that there's a chance all the return times for that day will have been given away.  If you show up obscenely early (5 AM or so), you'll be on Main Street with all the people who are arriving there as I type this (people can start lining up at 10 PM tonight). You don't need to stay overnight, but showing up early is probably your best bet for when the lines will be shortest -- they're going to get crazy later.  You're basically going to need to hang out all day to have a good spot for the parade and fireworks. Park hopping is going to be nearly impossible -- I've gone into quite a bit of detail here."
Disneyland,35o7x8,DDotJ,1 point,Fri May 22 05:28:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! We live close buy and just were hoping to pop into the parks for a few hours late late in the night then go back home. I know I couldn't do a whole day when I'm supposed to be finishing up thesis proposals to submit.
Disneyland,35o7x8,MaLaCoiD,8,Fri May 22 06:05:43 2015 UTC,"If you want to see the 3 am WoC, do they distribute FP's  after the 9 and 10:15 FPs run out? Or do they distribute them simultaneously, like NYE?"

Disneyland,35o7x8,sunshinedaisy,7,Sun May 17 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"Do all the rides run all night? If not, which ones close?"
Disneyland,35o7x8,femmebot08,6,Tue May 12 04:36:20 2015 UTC,Last year when we walked in they gave us those little leaflets that tell you the events for the day. Some rides didclose early (like 2-3 am) but for the most part the rides ran all night.
Disneyland,35o7x8,EnglishMobster,2,Tue May 12 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!"
Disneyland,35o7x8,femmebot08,5,Wed May 13 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"Most rides will run all night, but expect at the very least Toontown and Fantasyland to close for the fireworks.  Some attractions may also have issues with running for so long and may close early. I don't know for sure which ones will have that issue, but I imagine it will probably be the usual suspects (like Indy). They should have this already planned out and should give you that information the day of.  I believe some restaurants may close early as well, but I don't have a full list of those."
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,6,Tue May 12 21:33:24 2015 UTC,Thank you. We have 2 a.m. reservations to the Blue Bayou that night. It's either going to be awesome or I'm going to nap in my Jambalaya...
Disneyland,35o7x8,PBI325,2,Wed May 13 01:38:07 2015 UTC,I might try to do that for Cafe Orleans. I bet some spicy food would wake me up

I really want to stay the whole time (or at least as late as I can take it), but sometimes I get really bad anxiety from being pushed and shoved and getting bad mom attitudes at me.  Sometimes I just need somewhere to hide so I can chill out lol"
Disneyland,35o7x8,PBI325,8,Tue May 12 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"As /u/mildly_interesting said Tom Sawyer's Island doesn't get busy, I haven't been to a 24 hour event before but I did nap on Tom Sawyer's Island once, just sort of passed out on some rocks near Ft. Wilderness, didn't mean to but it was quiet and shady and comfortable.   I plan on staying the full 24 hours and will probably spend some time in the Golden Horseshoe in the upstairs area, it's kind of dark and not typically too busy up there. My sister's friends napped in the Mainstreet Cinema at the last 24 hour event so that's an option  for downtime. Maybe hop on the train and ride it around a few times to relax and decompress.   Honestly I don't think anywhere will be really safe from the crowds but hopefully those areas will offer some time to just not be on your feet and fighting with people."
Disneyland,35o7x8,sunshinedaisy,7,Tue May 12 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"Tom Sawyers Island doesn't get very busy.  Also, the bottom deck of Hungry Bear is pretty empty, and it's very peaceful, especially when the Mark Twain floats by."

One is a 'cold' bag that will have snacks so I don't go nuts buying food. I do up ziplocks of nuts etc and keep them in a locker. I'll also possibly take a bit of a thicker jacket and maybe a pair of pants in case the night gets really chilly.   I have a small drawstring backpack that will have my water bottle, whatever of my snacks I have on me, sunscreen etc. and I have a little hip bag that keeps my pass and money in reach."
Disneyland,35o7x8,lego606,3,Thu May 14 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"So far it seems like my plan is to be there in line before opening, go straight for lockers, then do as much as we can until it starts getting unbearable around noon-ish. All we really wanted to ride lots of popular rides we missed last time and take a lot of photos, then shopping forever. Really my goal is to cross off our wishlist before lunchtime.  I'm still not sure on this (it depends on when the park hits capacity and whether or not it'll open before Paint the Night/Fireworks), but the plan was to duck out at noon and go to special lunch at this place a half hour away. I think that I'll just have to ask around while I'm there to see if I'll make it. Otherwise, we'll eat inside the park and then save this place for after the fireworks.  After fireworks, I'll probably be dead not much later, so we'll leave and not come back until the morning so just so we can see what it's like. Probably not to ride rides, just to sit around, really."
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,4,Thu May 14 18:52:32 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if there is a way to find out if a park is closed before trying to park hop? I have the Touring Plans Lines app so is that a feature of said app?
Disneyland,35o7x8,orangefreshy,3,Thu May 14 22:17:28 2015 UTC,The only thing you can really do is ask a CM. They'll be 100% sure.

I'm flying in to LAX at 11pm the night before and I was hoping I could sleep in the Esplanade or in the car in the parking lot instead of getting a motel room or parking in the street for a few hours.
Disneyland,35o7x8,lego606,6,Thu May 14 13:54:51 2015 UTC,They won't likely allow that. Probably boot everyone out about midnight or so and lock the lots until maybe 4:30 or 5.
Disneyland,35o7x8,EatingPizzaAllDay,3,Thu May 14 15:26:58 2015 UTC,I asked Disneyland Today over Twitter about this. They told me Pumbaa will open at 10pm on May 21 for early arrivals to the 24 hour day. So I guess I'm good!

We plan on heading back a couple hours before dinner. However, if the park is at capacity when we return, is it possible to still be let in to head to the restaurant?

Disneyland,35o7x8,DDotJ,3,Mon May 18 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"If you're going solo, you should be able to find a standing spot an hour before the 8:50 parade. Otherwise i'd suggest getting a spot 1.5-2 hours before. People will be getting a spot even sooner than that, being that it's the first performance of a new parade.   World of Color fast passes will be distributed as they normally are. So they won't be available at the the same time.  I'm hoping to get a 3 am fast pass around 8:30 or 9 am."

The park gets PACKED, like to the point where you can barely walk around w/o bumping into the people around you, especially during nighttime. When the park reaches full capacity, which it will, it's not as enjoyable.   If you don't have an AP and would need to pay for admission into the park, you're money would be better spent on a day when it's less busy, lines are less of a wait, and the park is more relaxed.   With that being said though, the resort does have some exciting updates to the park in celebration of the 60th that are going to be pretty cool to see!"

Disneyland,35o7x8,vanillavanille,2,Fri May 15 16:01:51 2015 UTC,How busy will the parks be from 12am to 6am? I know it won't be as crowded during that time but will it be slow enough to make the trip worth it?
Disneyland,35o7x8,Techsupportvictim,3,Wed May 13 08:44:47 2015 UTC,"To go from 12am to 6am? I'd say kind of worth, you'll get to catch the 3am world of color show"
Disneyland,35o7x8,nett90,2,Wed May 13 19:43:26 2015 UTC,I would like some insight on if my plan is ok... We're getting in line for dl at 3am and planning on being in dl til about 1030am then park hops to dca til about 330 then head back to dl til midnight or so then head back to dca for the rest of the night...you think that'll be doable or am I gonna be locked out at some point?
Disneyland,35o7x8,robinsparkles87,2,Wed May 13 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"People said Disneyland is likely to start hitting capacity at 3PM, so you might have to hop back a little early if you start catching wind that its hitting capacity."
Disneyland,35o7x8,manzbot,2,Thu May 14 10:05:06 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that also. I plan to lunch at DCA around noon ish, maybe 1pm. Then  head back over to DL for a few shows, character hunt etc. dinner there, catch the flag ceremony if they have it, parade. Pop back over to DCA for world of color if need be. Depends on which show I get a pass for."

In your opinion, out of the 24 hours, what times are the best to get on some of the popular rides (Matterhorn, Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, etc.) after the park has been open? I am talking about a wait time of an hour or less.. I am seeing 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, but what about after 7:00 PM or so?   You guys are so helpful!

Disneyland,35o7s4,komplextroh,1 point,Wed May 13 05:56:52 2015 UTC,I guess cause I'm in Canada I can't see much of the article! Can't wait to read and see more!
Disneyland,35o7s4,thatcaveman,5,Tue May 12 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"i cant do much for the pictures, but here's all the text from the article, hopefully this is more than you were able to see  The new “Disneyland Forever” fireworks show debuting this summer at the Anaheim theme park will feature an original soundtrack, projection mapping throughout the park and appearances by characters from “The Jungle Book” and “Peter Pan.”  Starting May 22, Disneyland’s new fireworks display joins a new nighttime parade as well as Disney California Adventure’s new World of Color water show as part of a diamond jubilee celebration that’s expected to stretch through the end of the year and beyond.  Disneyland has used projection mapping on Sleeping Beauty castle and It’s a Small World in the past with tremendous success, marrying animated imagery to the architecture of the buildings to create a digital skin that morphs and moves.  In hopes of thinning the gridlocked crowds on Main Street U.S.A. and spreading the teeming hordes throughout the park during the “Forever” fireworks show, Disneyland will introduce projection mapping on Matterhorn mountain and the Fantasmic stage area along the Rivers of America in addition to the castle and Small World locations.  During a recent press preview, I watched rough animation of “Forever” and was impressed by the projection mapping sequences planned for Main Street USA.  I’m looking forward to watching the new fireworks show from various locations in park to see how the experience changes from land to land.  What’s clear is that “Forever” will focus as much on storytelling as fireworks. There will still be as many pyrotechnics as your average Fourth of July, but this being Disney you can also expect plenty of animation, characters and emotion.  Spoiler alert: What follows is a detailed breakdown of the five acts of the “Forever” fireworks show as well as the opening and finale. Consider yourself forewarned.  “Forever” opens with the new “Live the Magic” theme song as Peter Pan is projected onto Sleeping Beauty Castle and Tinkerbell flies past on a wire. About 100 spotlights hidden throughout the park will beam like “diamonds in the sky.”  The first act, dubbed Clouds, features music from “Tangled” (“I See the Light”) and “Mary Poppins” (“Step in Time”). Projections mapped onto the Main Street USA facades will show silhouetted chimney sweeps dancing on rooftops before the Poppins” scene dissolves into a panoramic view of a London streetscape. During the “Tangled” segment, lighted lanterns will appear to hover in the air via the building projections.  The next act, called Enchanted Places, focuses on the world of Winnie the Pooh, with dripping honeycomb projections on the building fronts. At one point, the colorful visuals turn wildly psychedelic as the elephant-like heffalumps and honey-thieving woozles from Pooh’s imagination take center stage.  The third act, dubbed Jungle, features music from “The Lion King” (“Circle of Life”) and “The Jungle Book” (“I Want to Be Like You”). The visuals will transform from animals marching across the Pride Lands to lightning storms illuminating jungle temples.  Next the story travels “Under the Sea” with music from “The Little Mermaid” as bubble projections paint the surroundings and blue lasers create an ocean surface atop Main Street USA. As the story line turns to “Finding Nemo,” the Matterhorn will be transformed into Mt. Wannahockaloogie as the film’s namesake clownfish swims by on a wire high above Sleeping Beauty Castle.  The fifth act, known as Snow, turns the Matterhorn into Elsa’s ice castle as fake flakes fall on Main Street USA and the crowd sings along to “Let It Go” from “Frozen.”  The finale sees the return of the spotlights, Tinkerbell and Peter Pan to the music of “When You Wish Upon a Star” before transitioning into the new original song “Kiss Goodnight.”"

Disneyland,35rb12,mrnovember5,7,Tue May 12 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"The rides are amazing. Even if you don't care for Disney, the attractions are breath taking and exhilarating. It's also such a welcoming place with a wonderful ambience to it. There's a reason it's called the happiest place on earth.   That said, you may hate it. I don't know. I would assume that if you have two eyes and a beating heart you'll love it, but I could be wrong."
Disneyland,35rb12,champion_dave,2,Tue May 12 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"My friend went with me earlier this year with a similar background (not into Disney, no childhood nostalgia towards the park, her boyfriend outright hates it) and loved it so much she bought a pass. However, her explanation of why she liked it was she appreciated it secondhand: that is, she picked up on my enthusiasm and energy and that made her more receptive to it; she might not have been if she'd gone with her boyfriend or alone.    My personal feeling is there's something for everyone: there's good food, there's lots of shows like the Royal Theatre and the Hyperion where you could spend the whole day doing things without ever getting on a ride (I rarely ride rides unless I go with other people, tbh), and there's a feel that isn't found at other parks."

I didn't really realize there were a lot of non-ride attractions that weren't like carnival games. I'm looking more at the website now to see the shows and stuff.

Disneyland,35rb12,chandelure,2,Thu May 14 05:16:14 2015 UTC,"If you're a big foodie, see if you have time to check out DCA. The food on that side of the resort is so ridiculously good. Of course, there's neat stuff like the PB&J soda and the Dole Whip at Disneyland too."

I've only been twice and a couple times at Disney World (once for work and another time tagging along with the spouse's work & we took the kids too and they had a blast), so I'm no mouseketeer, but the parks themselves are fun, the rides are fun, if you go in with a plan, the crowds are manageable.  They really have spent a lot of time and talent and money to provide a fun time, just endless small details that are designed to engage you, even when (particularly when) you end up standing in line."
Disneyland,35rb12,SkySeaSkySeaaaa,2,Tue May 12 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"If you don't have much experience visiting amusement parks, then I would say do your research beforehand. Find out what rides you want to go on ahead of time, also be sure to utilize Fast Passes for popular attractions like Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, etc. As for your ride preference, the only swinging or spinning rides would be simple things like the Tea Cups or Dumbo. Look up restaurants and pick your favorites. If your family wants to check out any of the shows, you can look those up as well. Knowing what you want to do ahead of time helps a lot and saves a bunch of headaches.  It is really easy to have a fantastic time at the parks but at the same time you could possibly have a bad time as well if you just go in blind.   Feel free to check out the website and look under the 'Things to Do' bar at the bottom. They explain everything rather well. Hope you choose to come visit the parks!"

Disneyland,35prhc,Techsupportvictim,9,Tue May 12 14:39:55 2015 UTC,Magic Bands at the Disneyland Resort would be extremely hard to implement. Many of our park visitors are APs and come spontaneously. Having to plan out a park visit would take that away.  Bringing in that concept this summer is completely out of the question. Executives have enough on their plate with the diamond celebration. They don't need a stressful new system to worry about too.
Disneyland,35prhc,mildly_interesting,2,Tue May 12 15:52:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if they implemented Magic Bands without the Fastpass+ component. They could be making a fortune off of Magic Bands whose sole purpose was replacing your park ticket or AP.
Disneyland,35prhc,dodgepodge,3,Tue May 12 16:05:54 2015 UTC,Given the number of folks that walk around with smart phones I'm not getting why they haven't already moved to mobile payment support and mobile passcards. Forgetting needing the special bands at this point. Or even using it with fast passes. Passbook on the iPhone has been around for ages so it's not like that was sprung on them out of no where. And folks hand staff their phones all the time to take photos so pulling up a barcode and holding it out for a photo pass scan shouldn't be a huge deal.   It's up there with why there is no official Disneyland app. That would be a different office than the celebration etc. and there is the need for it. All the third party maps and wait time apps have proven that. So what's the hold up
Disneyland,35prhc,dodgepodge,2,Tue May 12 17:12:56 2015 UTC,"It's still shocking that there's no official Disneyland app. They could copy most of the features apps like Mousewait have (with a little more polish, of course) and we'd all be happy.  If they paired this with Magic Bands, they could even accurately track wait times. Oh, the possibilities..."
Disneyland,35prhc,callhersavage,3,Tue May 12 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"They have an official iPad app that shows photos of the different lands. Just add maps, schedules, menus and wait times even with the old system. Plus Passbook etc for your ticket/pass. Then for version two+ they could add character alerts, perhaps even based on using location services, reminders for tagged shows, searchable menus (ie ""where's the closest place to find a corn dog from my location), new wait time system, alerts of the gates being closed due to traffic, fast passes at least for the shows (you have a barcode or QR with your ticket number they scan it and the system records you have a pass) photo pass integration, ride photo integration. (Car has a QR you scan which adds a time code and you can look it up to buy your photos, view photos and buy in app. And so on.   They could do the wait times via a QR code system as well. Folks could volunteer to be wait trackers by signing up in app. They scan a QR at the beginning of the line and then at certain checkpoints throughout the line. System calculates wait times from how long it takes to move to each point. They could even still perhaps use the hang tags to supplement it. I know a lot of folks that would be happy to provide that info.   And then they could add the Magic bands for those without smartphones like kids. Or the privacy paranoid. Or use them in combo so if your phone battery dies you can pop it in a charging locker and use your magic band in the meantime"
Disneyland,35prhc,rextraverse,2,Tue May 12 17:52:19 2015 UTC,I would love if I could just link my AP and a debit and/or credit card to a band. It would make my life easier not having to worry about a wallet. FP+ could still be an option utilizing an app or even using the kiosks with a swipe option for the band instead of the card for updating on the go. I am hoping that we eventually get a similar system out here.
Disneyland,35prhc,cardassian_tailor,1 point,Tue May 12 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"Magic Bands at the Disneyland Resort would be extremely hard to implement. Many of our park visitors are APs and come spontaneously. Having to plan out a park visit would take that away.   However, hasn't the DLR management team been trying to reduce the number of annual passholders?  By implementing Magic Band in full in Anaheim, it could be an incredibly effective passive-agressive move to disincentivize passholders moreso than anything else they've already tried like eliminating pass categories (like SoCal), removing perks (parking add-on), or increasing the price.  Don't get me wrong, as a Deluxe AP, I would hate this a lot because I am part of that spontaneous park visitor demographic (I think I've only actually planned a trip to DLR well ahead of time maybe three times in the last five years) but essentially making Fastpasses a non-option for the spontaneous visit could be an incredibly effective deterrent."
Disneyland,35prhc,stevensokulski,1 point,Tue May 12 19:26:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but then I also think that Magic Bands are a terrible idea in the first place and was created because of CEOs only looking at increasing profits.    The Google and Apple pay systems are different and only require updated credit card readers for the NFC technology.  I believe this is already being implemented but OP was wondering when."
Disneyland,35prhc,izookie,3,Tue May 12 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"The big thing that would lead to contactless payments in the parks would be a wholesale replacement of the credit card terminals.  If Disney hasn't already implemented the EMV (chip-n-pin) technology, then we will probably see this sooner rather than later. There's a lability shift in October of this year that could see merchants being held responsible for fraud if they don't implement new security tech."
Disneyland,35prhc,thatcaveman,2,Tue May 12 17:07:35 2015 UTC,Given the number of terminals it seems silly if they haven't started the switch. But yes that is also a factor.
Disneyland,35prhc,stevensokulski,3,Tue May 12 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"I wen to WDW in Jan and I found myself using Apple Pay more than my Magic Band because it was easier to not have to type in the PIN. Also, I didn't want to rack up a balance on my hotel bill. Looking forward to getting Apple Pay at DLR. Shouldn't be too hard to swap out the pay terminals... They already have network connectivity."
Disneyland,35prhc,thatcaveman,2,Tue May 12 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"The Magicband project has already went wayy over budget in WDW which was the primary reason they halted production on Star Wars Land. If they do start anything like this in DL, expect ticket/AP prices to go up (once again).  The Magicband system is nice, but I think only tourists will get the most of it as the charging on the bands in WDW does not go directly to your card, but it goes to your hotel room. There is no charging on the Magicband if you don't have a hotel room. Just fastpasses, reservations, and some of the rides implement it. I thought the system was great when I went to WDW, but again I was a tourist and spent wayy more than should. I guess it worked, haha.  NFC payment (specifically Apple pay) is already coming to the parks."
Disneyland,35prhc,Albort,2,Tue May 12 16:00:31 2015 UTC,There's nothing to prevent them from letting you link a credit card without a room if it served a purpose. Perhaps a Chase VISA tie-in would let Disney cardholders use MagicBands in the parks.

Disneyland,35mhhl,SpikeDaPenguin,2,Wed May 13 21:58:07 2015 UTC,Haven't ridden it when that happens but what do they usually do in the Attic? Because that might help give an indication of what they'll do.

Disneyland,35mhhl,ALovelyTrouble,7,Mon May 11 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a matter of dialing it back... It's a matter of elevating what's already there. When I saw him I was like ""WOAH! That's amazing!... Now the rest of the mansion needs to catch up."""
Disneyland,35mhhl,there4igraham,5,Tue May 12 05:11:36 2015 UTC,Most definitely but I think the least they could have done was stick to the same color scheme. More green. Less blue.
Disneyland,35mhhl,ALovelyTrouble,8,Tue May 12 05:19:06 2015 UTC,I think his color was to compliment the bride. But I get what you're saying

Disneyland,35mhhl,Kiraspring7791,1 point,Tue May 12 20:39:20 2015 UTC,Is the Hatbox Ghost becoming a permanent resident at the mansion or is this just for the 60th anniversary
Disneyland,35mhhl,supercruiser,3,Mon May 11 20:19:42 2015 UTC,"Permanent. They specifically said they were bringing him back, no reason to take him away! Plus that's a lot of money to throw away on creating him just to take him away. Decorations are one thing that may cost a lot but since they cover the entire park, it's worth it. Compare that tot he money they spent on this individual animatronic and well, there's no reason to just take him away!"
Disneyland,35mhhl,Witt6,0,Tue May 12 09:48:54 2015 UTC,"Saw him on Saturday - So happy its there, but I felt the effect was a bit too much. Wish they kept it practical. Still very happy to see him there."
Disneyland,35mhhl,supercruiser,6,Mon May 11 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering, how possible the effect is, if done practical. Remember the original Hatbox Ghost was a practical effect and failed. I wouldn't doubt that through out the decades a few imagineers picked up the Hatbox Ghost idea to try to bring it back. Perhaps it's only now that with better lighting methods, specialized projection and the digital age are we able to get the effect right."
Disneyland,35mhhl,Witt6,5,Mon May 11 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"That's what I assumed it would be. I've actually worked for Disney doing production for various things in the past, and pretty much every project I've worked on has been ""it has to get done no matter what"". so for something so prominent and historical to the ride, I figured they would have found a way to make it work as a practical effect. I was incredibly impressed by the version they showed at D23 a few years back, its movement was very exaggerated and fluid, and at the time it had a sculpted face. I was not expecting to be there on the day that he ""reappeared"", it was a complete fluke. as we were going through the hallway, i noticed a lot of little pictures of him hanging on the wall, which I hadnt seen before. , Then right after the attic I realized there was a new sound that I didn't recognize. I thought the ""zap"" effect was cheeseball, and looked completely computerized along with his face, as well as his little movement, the ghost at d23 lunged and moved around in a strangely human way. I'm not knocking it too hard, I'm really happy he's finally there and I'm excited to see him again, but I just was a bit let down by the fact that they didn't pull out all the stops for him."
Disneyland,35mhhl,supercruiser,4,Mon May 11 23:03:12 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're referring to this Hatbox Ghost. They say in the video the A100 base model they are using is pretty top of the line. I'm going to guess that the Imagineers weren't able to get the budget to use a more top of the line model. So they had to settle for a model with less range of motion.
Disneyland,35mhhl,AressVeran,2,Mon May 11 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, that one."
Disneyland,35mhhl,supercruiser,6,Mon May 11 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"Me too! What's in place looks very ghost-like and ethereal, which I like. But it would've been nice to see a physical head on the body if they could've pulled it off without lapsing back into the same issues.  Random question: Did the buggy break down for you? Reading a few posts, I'm inclined to think that they stopped the ride for some people so they could get a good look at him. (Just a wild hypothesis. :-) )"
Disneyland,35mhhl,MonorailBlack,7,Mon May 11 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"It stopped a lot, but I wouldn't say that that was anything out of the norm - I noticed more than a few handicapped people in the line with us, they usually stop it to assist people in and out of the cars. it stopped just shy of him for us, so I heard it doing a few ""performances"""
Disneyland,35mhhl,AressVeran,7,Mon May 11 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"Having worked in attractions, rides aren't stopped so 1 or 2 random people here and there can check things out longer. It's just the usual stopping to allow people with mobility issues to board, or somebody boarding late."
Disneyland,35mhhl,MonorailBlack,3,Tue May 12 14:36:42 2015 UTC,I figured. But it was stopping a handful of times while I was on it and then I stopped exactly in front of him. My imagination got the better of me. :-)

The Fastpass systems aren't connected in the two parks (meaning you can have one from each park at a time), so you can take advantage of that. Here's what I did a couple months ago...   Arrive before open. Run to Space Mountain. Get Fastpass for Space Mountain. Ride Space Mountain. Ride Star Tours Ride Buzz By now, Space Mountain Fastpass is eligible. Get Fastpass for Indy. Ride Space with Fastpass Park Hop to CA. Get Fastpass for Radiator Springs. (Return time already at 4:15pm) Ride Singles Line for Radiator Springs. Park Hop to DL. By now, Indy Fastpass is eligible Get Fastpass for Thunder Mtn Ride Snow White Ride Indy Ride Haunted Mansion Eat lunch Hop to CA Get Fastpass for Tower of Terror (you can get another one two hours after you get one for Racers even if your time hasn't hit yet) Ride Midway Mania Ride Little Mermaid Ride Tower Get another Fastpass for Tower Hop to DL Ride Thunder   I don't really remember the rest, but you get the idea… :) We did 23 rides total - including Thunder, Space, Buzz, Star Tours, Indy, Tower, and Racers twice each.

So it was kind of ""off season"" (though DL doesn't really have an off season with so many locals nearby) ... but if you get there before the park opens, I think you'll at least be able to pull off some of this before it starts filling up. It got really busy around 4 when school let out.  When I was there, Soarin', Splash, Matterhorn, and Peter Pan were closed, so that eliminated a few of the bigger attractions from the mix... however all but Pan have a singles line, so you could utilize those if you're trying to cram as much in as possible."

Disneyland,35otp4,StevesRealAccount,1 point,Wed May 13 03:53:28 2015 UTC,Soarin is supposed to be open. Also the hatbox ghost just came back to haunted mansion so those lines could be nuts  I would say to get a space mountain fast pass and then run over to haunted mansion before it gets too nuts.  Radiator Springs Racers can get super busy but if you guys are willing to go single rider it may not be too bad

Disneyland,35op6x,mildly_interesting,8,Tue May 12 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"A few friends and I were eating breakfast over at Tomorrowland Terrance and just talking about the state of Tomorrowland.   My friend came up with a brilliant idea. How about a Wall-E ride? The whole movie itself takes place in the future. It'd be a nice change of pace from the upcoming Star Wars take over.  The only issue I see with it is the fact that Wall-E is a bit ""old"" now and they should have started the process way back then.  I do hope that with ""Tomorrowland"" coming out in theaters, it'll give the Resort the right boost to begin redesigning Tomorrowland."
Disneyland,35op6x,champion_dave,4,Tue May 12 17:33:09 2015 UTC,"I would love a Wall-E ride, but you're right that it's a bit old now. Also, I wonder how all the large people riding around in motorized wheelchairs would feel about the ride... I would hope they'd see the irony."
Disneyland,35op6x,iSkelly87,0,Tue May 12 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"For the state that we all see Tomorrowland is Disney is really putting a lot of attention on it.

Disneyland,35op6x,disneywizard,16,Tue May 12 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"Disney should make scented candle wax melts in the scents of the popular attractions and food of the park. Example would be a POTC water scented wax melt. I'd buy those.   Also, I think they should remodel one of the restaurants -not Blue Bayou - in New Orleans Square into an old fashioned Tiana's Restaurant. The movie fits right into the land - it's set right in 1920's New Orleans - and the food would be delicious!"
Disneyland,35op6x,centracing,2,Tue May 12 14:16:29 2015 UTC,There's a girl on easy that makes disney scented candles. She makes them all herself and gets lots of orders so it usually takes a while though.

Disneyland,35op6x,DOC_HOLLIDAY_1911,7,Wed May 13 05:54:50 2015 UTC,I wish they would do an overlay during Halloween for Space Mountain other than Ghost Galaxy. I feel they could do a great Nightmare Before Christmas sleigh scene in there. Police lights and sirens. And they would be shooting us out of the sky like in the movie
Disneyland,35op6x,wamoc,4,Tue May 12 19:29:38 2015 UTC,I think that would just light up Space Mountain too much. Part of the thrill of Space Mountain is you can't see where you are going.
Disneyland,35op6x,Kierz10TheRaven,2,Tue May 12 20:50:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not one for scary things, but ghost galaxy doesn't scare me at all. That's saying something. I think something funny like what you said would fit the Disney theme better since their attempt at ""scary"" doesn't really succeed. I never understood what the point of Ghost Galaxy was. It'd be cool if they could fit in Guardians of the Galaxy though, since tomorrow land houses marvel stuff now."
Disneyland,35op6x,izookie,3,Wed May 13 17:29:43 2015 UTC,Young people are showing off with social media at an alarming rate. The parks have become one big selfie backdrop. Character Meet & Greets have longer queues than E-ticket attractions.
Disneyland,35op6x,TheOnlyBongo,8,Wed May 13 03:23:02 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one a bit annoyed by all the Hatbox Ghost stuff everywhere? I was holding off from seeing it until I see it in person so I could have that 'wow' factor, but all the pictures and videos everywhere just about spoiled me of what to expect. And I wasn't even actively looking for it either. It usually stems from the preview icons which highlight the ghost in all its glory. It just automatically appeared everywhere, from MiceChat to YouTube and Reddit with everything else in between.  I don't like spoilers all too much because I want to experience it first hand myself. Maybe that's just me though."
Disneyland,35op6x,mildly_interesting,6,Tue May 12 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like I dropped the ball on the whole HatBox Ghost premiere. I really should have made a mega thread about it.   I'm in the same boat. Haven't had time to go to the park to see our new ghostly presence, but I've seen enough to know what to expect.   I know it'll totally blow me out of the water when I see it in person though :)"
Disneyland,35op6x,1234567ate,1 point,Tue May 12 18:16:47 2015 UTC,I think that the characters (live) should not be roaming or even in designated spot outside. Seeing random long lines doesn't give it the natural feel I'm sure they are expecting. Plus the character rides are always a little slower than the larger rides so maybe putting a special room at the end of the character rides to take your picture. So now you would have to go on the ride to see the character and it hides character lines.
Disneyland,35op6x,lego606,2,Tue May 12 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"Cool idea, and it might work in WDW. The Fantasyland rides here though are super tightly packed, with most show scenes sharing a back wall"
Disneyland,35paxl,PokethePoohBear,2,Tue May 12 12:11:12 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be too much of a difference (except for on weekends) between going to Disneyland in the beginning or in the middle of October. Early October might be a tad bit less crowded (from my experience) but not drastically so compared to the end of the month. Since you're doing 3 days I'd suggest trying to schedule at least two of those days during the week and not the weekends- both parks will get way more crowded on most weekends in October. Also, I know you said you aren't into the Halloween party nights, but you should still be aware of what nights that event is scheduled to happen during your trip because Disneyland will close early on those nights and you'll get kicked out of the park unless you have a Halloween party ticket (which is an extra cost on top of regular park admission).  As far as how to stop obsessing over Disney-related things...well...you're really asking in the wrong subreddit for help with that particular addiction dear sir/madam ;)"

Disneyland,35o9jr,Magold,1 point,Tue May 12 16:07:30 2015 UTC,I did just this! It was very weird to not rush throughout the day. A couple of attractions were close or had very long wait lines and it was nice to realize that I could just come back another day. I'm going to really enjoy not rushing.
Disneyland,35o9jr,dodgepodge,3,Thu May 14 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"If you're going in the morning, get a Radiator Springs Racers Fastpass (assuming you want to ride it). It's still way easier than waiting in the single-rider line, and you can stop by the Cozy Cone to get a breakfast cone OR have breakfast at Flo's V-8. The traditional breakfast there is great.  Aside from that, enjoy yourself. Don't feel pressured to go on everything. It's easy to burn yourself out as a passholder if you make every trip about going on every ride. Enjoy the things you might not usually make time for. For instance, I finally saw ""Frozen"" at the Royal Theater in Disneyland Saturday, and it was excellent. It's got plenty of stuff for kids to enjoy, but the jokes are definitely for the parents/adults in the crowd."

Don't count on getting a locker unless you get it really early. Don't count on normal nap spots to be open - they closed down Innoventions and some other hangout spots early, that we could have otherwise napped in.  I brought a bunch of 5 hour energy shots to take   We camped out for the 1am Fantasmic for about 2 hours and caught some rest, and ended up watching people trying to get across the area moving only 10 feet in an hour - there was horrible traffic issues, but they might have solved those.

They look for people who have personality and are able to tell a story and be interactive with anything. You are doing more than just forming lines for the characters as well. You are basically an entertainment host and could be doing anything.

Yes it's a little pricey but the silhouettes aren't normal size so you have to get them custom matted to fit in a frame.  Have fun!"
Disneyland,35k2tk,femmebot08,2,Mon May 11 13:50:38 2015 UTC,"It blew my mind how fast and accurate they were. The first one she did of me turned out too small and she said I looked like my husbands daughter...which was funny/weird. She whipped up another one of my and gave me the first one for free. What amazed me the most was how she was able to talk the whole time while cutting. I think her name was Bonnie, I wish now that I would have left a comment card because she was so awesome."
Disneyland,35k2tk,VersaceTupperware,2,Tue May 12 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"thats really cool, do you think they'll be able to make one of two people? and how much was it price-wise, to be specific?"
Disneyland,35k2tk,femmebot08,3,Mon May 11 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"YES!! The woman that did ours said they've done up to 8 people (maybe more, I can't remember)  It was pretty inexpensive. You can do it with our without the frame. I'm almost positive that it cost less than $20 with the frame. It's just so amazing because it's all done by hand."
Disneyland,35k2tk,CletusTSJY,5,Mon May 11 04:08:40 2015 UTC,I just got 3 silhouettes done in February. I remember not getting the frame because it was more than I wanted to pay. I think the silhouets may be around $10 but I think the frame adds $15 or more.
Disneyland,35k2tk,femmebot08,2,Mon May 11 06:45:10 2015 UTC,Thanks. My memory is a little foggy but that sounds about right.
Disneyland,35k2tk,centracing,2,Mon May 11 06:56:20 2015 UTC,That's so cool. I think we'll be doing that on our next trip. We got a little glitter painting thing done of use as pirates last time.

Disneyland,35k2tk,cardassian_tailor,11,Mon May 11 07:24:00 2015 UTC,I'm going to second /u/TalithaRabboni and recommend a visit to Trader Sam's.  I'm not sure if you are old enough to drink but you can still get food at some of the tables.  The pizza is out of this world.  If you can't order drinks hang around long enough and you'll see what happens when someone DOES order the drinks.    If you're under 21 you will have to go before 8PM but it is worth the detour to Disneyland Hotel.
Disneyland,35k2tk,TalithaRabboni,3,Mon May 11 10:35:29 2015 UTC,"I don't drink, so I had one of their ""no-booze brews."" The Schweitzer Falls is tropical fruit juices, ""Sam's Gorilla Grog"" (I have no clue what's in it), and Sprite, and I really liked it."
Disneyland,35k2tk,cardassian_tailor,1 point,Mon May 11 15:59:36 2015 UTC,Good to know!  I've saw they had those but haven't been back again to try them.  Do they do the effects if you order one?
Disneyland,35k2tk,TalithaRabboni,2,Tue May 12 05:32:40 2015 UTC,"There weren't any effects for the Schweitzer Falls, but I think there was one non-alcoholic drink that might have triggered effects. (I'm guessing because it comes with a souvenir cup, and the two effects I did see were triggered by people ordering drinks in souvenir cups.) But I was only in there for maybe an hour before I had to meet with the rest of my group, so I'm not really an expert."
Disneyland,35k2tk,TheOnlyBongo,18,Tue May 12 07:23:22 2015 UTC,"Sleep on the Disneyland Railroad. Most people go on the railroad to ride or to change destinations. However, it is the best place to take power naps if you're into it.  I go to the parks alone and sometimes I just can't take the day anymore. I board the railroad at the nearest station and take a seat at the first car closest to the engine and then start to doze off. The steady beating of the engines, the rocking of the cars, the blowing of the whistle, and the occasional blasting of the engine blowdown just make me feel relaxed and in the perfect mood to sleep. I think it's partially due to the fact that since I doze off near loud sounds to begin with, everything else just sort of fades away and you're sort of left on your own mentally.  Usually I conk out maybe 30 minutes to an hour before I wake up full of energy. Although there was that...one time...I was just so tired that day that I did my usual business. It was late in the day with the park being illuminated a brilliant golden yellow before dozing off. When I awoke I thought I still had my eyes closed so I opened them wide again. I started to freak out a little because I couldn't see anything and was about to say something out of fear. it was then i realized we were on the banks of the Rivers of America and it had already gone pitch black outside.  So remember kids, the Disneyland Railroad is a great place to nap, but please...do keep track of how long you sleep."

Disneyland,35k2tk,Fusionbomb,2,Mon May 11 04:27:26 2015 UTC,"You ride on the tender, not in it.  If you ask the conductor to ride in the tender he might be wondering where your swimsuit is since that's where the engine stores its water."

You'll have to do a full loop since that's the only platform long enough to load from. The engineers are always nice and are willing to answer questions.   As for the monorail, because it's a one way track you can ask if you can ride in front."

Disneyland,35k2tk,dukenuk12,6,Mon May 11 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"These are all great. I would also recommend seeing the Jedi academy in tomorrowland. My wife and I went early on a Wednesday and had breakfast at TLT and caught the show. It's actually pretty good and the kids are hilarious.   Check out the marine observation outpost experience on the nemo submarines. A nice air conditioned and well themed room with a video of the ride with cool graphics and extra animations.  I really enjoyed this and it's walk-on thru the exit so it's very quick.   I love the classic attractions no one talks about: Lincoln, tiki room, and the Davy Crockett canoes. The canoes people hate because kids splash and you have to row or else you don't go anywhere and the cast members will make fun of you. But I absolutely love it.   Fowler's harbor is a great quiet place to walk around. It's where the Columbia docks and it it a lot larger than you'd think! It also gives a great view of the splash mountain u-turn after the drop and some great views of Tom Sawyers island.   If it's running, rode the Columbia as well. It's fun and they fire the cannon and it has a different spiel than the mark twain  Check out the cigarillo animatronic in the new fantasyland just to the left of the castle. One of my favorite new additions to the park. Plus this area is dead and BEAUTIFUL at dusk/ night time.   Spend an hour on Tom Sawyers island. They've removed some of my favorite things to do there but the Pirates lair updates are very cool and fun.   Ride on one of the main st vehicles. This was never a tradition for my family growing up but I love them all! The omnibus is the double decker and riding up top gives you a VERY unique perspective of the park!  Take a walking tour. They have a walk in walt's footsteps and a horticultural tour. Both which have amazing information as well as being able to walk onto a few attractions.   Over at DCA: animation academy, turtle talk, and sorcerer's workshop are fun ways to pass the time and are well themed entertainment.   If you're of age, Sonoma Terrace is a quiet place to have a beer and rest right next to paradise bay. It's right next to the wine country trattoria on the left side. To the right of the restaurant is another cool place to have a glass of wine called the alfresco tasting terrace  At 10am there are free tours of the carthay circle theatre. Always fun  Redwood challenge trail is fun but full of kids. Not sure what time is best to go check it out with less crowds.   Take the back trail that goes behind and under grizzle river run. It's a quiet walkway that has a great view of the drop.   Have a drink at the hearthstone lounge just inside the grand Californian when coming from the DCA entrance by grizzly river run.   These are some of my favorite ""off the beaten path"" things to do. Hopefully some are new to you. :)"
Disneyland,35k2tk,dave2kdotorg,6,Mon May 11 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"I dont think you can ride the tender anymore. My fiance and I asked and a CM told us they stopped doing it.   If you like the vintage rides, check out the Snow White ride in Fantasy Land. Touch the golden apple in the queue line, try to grab the floating apple the witch offers you in the ride. The ride was updated to have a ""holographic"" apple, because of the old Grad Nite' tradition of stealing the apple off of the ride.   Sit in California Adventure by the grizzly river rapids at night and listen to the banjo and crickets.   Ride Soarin' and ask to be in the front row.   I know people may have already told you this but sitting down in the animation academy in California Adventure is actually pretty fun."
Disneyland,35k2tk,JalenJade,2,Mon May 11 08:08:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll try to find out a bit more about riding in the tender.   Hanging out by GRR at night sounds really nice and relaxing.  The Animation Academy is our favorite place to hang out when my brother is napping in his stroller haha  And I chuckled a bit about Soarin' because we haven't sat in the middle or back in several years. We always ask for the front even if we have to wait until the next ride. It made me realize how picky we actually are hahaha

Disneyland,35k2tk,NWSanta,5,Mon May 11 05:01:45 2015 UTC,I saw some people in the tail of the monorail earlier this week. I think it depends on how many CMs are working and how big of a crowd there is on the platform.

Disneyland,35mmgo,izookie,2,Tue May 12 05:55:35 2015 UTC,The two bits I've gotten are get a locker asap if you want one. And enter both parks are quick as you can. That way if the gates lock for crowding you'll be in the reentry group not the new arrivals. Reentries generally get let in faster. My plan is to try to hit haunted mansion and then go over to Flo's for breakfast.

At 10pm, I have to round up all of my students, and we head over to DCA with special ""Grad Nite"" tickets/wristbands.  It is ONLY open to Grad Nite students/chaperones.    I enjoy it because it's great seeing how excited everybody is to be done with high school, but for a non student/chaperone it would be extremely bad.  There are few attractions open (Extremely long lines), and thousands of teenagers trying to get that perfect #hashtag moment to impress their boo can get tiresome by 2am."

Disneyland,35ift6,Mr_McChicken_420,3,Mon May 11 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"Thousands of 16-18 year-olds with minimal supervision. In our school the student to chaperon ratio was maybe 12:1? But it's not like the adults follow you around so there's minimal to no supervision (save for Disney security, but a lot of kids don't know they're being watched). Combine that with everyone being pumped up by the music, lights, and just being at Disneyland you get some pretty hyper individuals. I remember hearing kids were getting in fights.   Every single ride our group tried to go on was a minimum of an 1.5 hour wait. Every attraction is PACKED. Like there is no breathing room at all in line. We went on 3 rides in a span of something like 7 hours? Also, the rides were breaking down a lot. I would bet that kids were goofing around causing the systems to be reset or shut off.   The music was not my thing. Back then they had 3 main areas, the Tomorrowland Terrace, the Castle and I heard there was another one but I didn't go looking for it. There were some sections just completely closed off, effectively funneling more traffic into the already major bottlenecks of the park (Adventure/Frontier land <-> Main Street and Tomorrowland <-> Main Street)."

We weren't aware that it was grad night when entering the park, but we were there for a ride or two and some food before leaving. We were just finishing up our meal when the grads were funneling into DCA. We got out of there pretty quickly after as there were just a huge influx of kids coming. For the grads, it's fun. But if you don't know any of them and they're screaming with excitement, it can get old pretty quickly."

Disneyland,35gv7l,ClockItClockIt,32,Sun May 10 05:48:16 2015 UTC,"Disney is on a synergy kick right now.  They have always been part of this concept with movies fueling childrens' desire to visit Disneyland and the rides fueling their desire to watch the movies.    It is a fairly efficient cycle.  If you notice the ""unbranded"" rides you mention are all thrill rides central to any theme park.  They're still themed in a way but molded into Disneyland and done with Disney's attention detail and quality.  They're also part of the old guard of rides back when Disneyland was still establishing its crowd and credibility as a major tourist destination.  I think most of what started at Disneyland were common themes of fairytale and imagination.  As it happened a lot of those fairytales and stories were made into Disney movies.  The original rides had visitors BE the character with the story happening around them.  People would complain that they didn't see their favorite character so much they had to change the concept of their ride to show the story with the characters in them.  It was only natural they realized that is what people wanted and how it might introduce people to other characters and their stories that happened to already be a Disney movie.    Sorry if you knew this already, I can be a bit verbose."
Disneyland,35gv7l,cardassian_tailor,3,Sun May 10 08:07:04 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with that first part.  The attractions that many people would consider to be all time classics; Haunted Mansion, the Mark Twain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jungle Cruise, Autopia, etc., were never based on any motion picture (though of course motion pictures were certainly made based on many of these attractions).  To me, basing a new attraction on an existing movie franchise has always seemed like taking the easy way out.  Sometimes it works to great effect of course, witness Radiator Springs Racers, but while Jungle Cruise continues to be a popular favorite after nearly 60 years, I doubt that Radiator Springs Racers will last nearly that long."
Disneyland,35gv7l,h_lehmann,2,Sun May 10 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"Jungle Cruise is, in part, based on a fantastic film called The African Queen, which was in turn based on a novel of the same name, however I believe Disney only drew inspiration from the film."
Disneyland,35gv7l,CalmDownOverThere,19,Wed May 13 05:16:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm assuming it has a lot to do with being less risky. If you come up with an idea for an original attraction, its success can not be known, whereas, an attraction based on an already successful franchise or film will most likely draw crowds. I remember reading an interview with Bob Iger where he mentions something along these lines I believe in reference to Star Wars, but I cannot find it at this time. Maybe someone knows of it and can post it.  There was a lot of ""unbranded"" attractions in old DCA as well that didn't go over well (Superstar Limo, Mulholland Madness, and Orange Stinger immediately come to mind). So perhaps Disney took this to mean that branding an  attraction is in fact a safer bet. Effectively, they ended up rebranding these attractions to make them bearable. Who knows, this could have led to their risk-averse nature being that ol' DCA 1.0 was not as successful as hoped.  I'm more interested in the quality of an attraction (particularly theme and detail and story, since that is what sets Disney apart) though over it's basis. If it's based on a film or something and it is still rich in detail, theme, story, and Disney magic, then I'm in. Just look at Indiana Jones. I would not complain if something of Indy's quality was built today based off another IP.  It's the magic that comes from theme, story, and attention to detail that are most important in my opinion."
Disneyland,35gv7l,blackseat,17,Sun May 10 07:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my biggest fear. Disney is moving on I guess.   My only concern is that we get another ""Nemo"" situation, where they take an old ride and shoehorn in a movie. Like adding Frozen to the Matterhorn, or turning Space Mountain into a Star Wars ride.   That is the darkest timeline."
Disneyland,35gv7l,EnglishMobster,20,Sun May 10 07:56:39 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't turn Space Mountain into a Star Wars ride, don't worry.  They'd turn it into a Marvel ride. Fly into space with Iron Man and Thor and help the Guardians of the Galaxy defeat Thanos! That actually sounded really cool once I typed it out."
Disneyland,35gv7l,ochaos,2,Sun May 10 08:37:30 2015 UTC,Fly into space with Iron Man and Thor and help the Guardians of the Galaxy defeat Thanos!   I'd ride this.  (Of course I loved the Tron overlay for the Peoplemover.)
Disneyland,35gv7l,syxtfour,8,Sun May 10 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"No problem there, they can't turn Space Mountain into a Star Wars ride; it's already based on a different sci-fi movie from the 1970's."
Disneyland,35gv7l,ArtemisAvenged2,3,Sun May 10 15:27:55 2015 UTC,It....is? Does it share the same name?
Disneyland,35gv7l,syxtfour,2,Sun May 10 18:27:01 2015 UTC,"Nope. Space Mountain is loosely based upon the movie ""The Black Hole"" from 1979. Both the ride and the movie feature a robot named V.I.N.CENT, who can be seen in the ride's loading area. Further, the unofficial ""plot"" of Space Mountain is that the roller coaster itself is a journey through the black hole and your escape out of it."
Disneyland,35gv7l,drawingonmyhands,2,Sun May 10 23:31:39 2015 UTC,I'm having a hard time finding picture or video of V.I.N.CENT in the loading area. Can you point me in the right direction?
Disneyland,35gv7l,syxtfour,7,Sun May 10 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"After doing some research myself, it appears I must be mistaken. With Space Mountain being launched at Disney World a few years before the release of ""The Black Hole"", there's no way the two can have a solid connection. Further, despite my best efforts, I can't find a photo of V.I.N.CENT either.   I apologize for this embarrassing error. It seems Space Mountain is indeed an original ride."
Disneyland,35gv7l,thievinstealsberg,2,Mon May 11 00:37:31 2015 UTC,"However, what became star tours in the 80s was actually going to be a motion simulator ride based on ""The Black Hole"" untill the movie was a financial failure."

Disneyland,35gv7l,cardassian_tailor,2,Sun May 10 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"I thought you were referencing the fact that they decided to make a movie out of the ride Pirates of the Caribbean, which led to adding the characters to the ride."
Disneyland,35gv7l,WilliamMButtliquer,14,Sun May 10 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"Actually the re-theming of DCA was in part by its low attendance and many surveys were used to focus why it wasn't popular.  The main answer people gave were it not being ""very Disney"", thus branding.  People asked why they would go into DCA when the brand wasn't particularly apparent.  People pay for Disney and wanted to see it.    Oh and I agree with you completely on the quality.  If anything ""brands"" as Disney, it has to be quality and attention to detail."
Disneyland,35gv7l,cardassian_tailor,11,Sun May 10 07:45:19 2015 UTC,"I loved the old California Adventure but I'm not from California and I loved the nostalgia of it. However, Radiator Springs, at night? Oh yeah, whatever they've got in mind seems to be working. I didn't even like Cars that much."
Disneyland,35gv7l,WilliamMButtliquer,5,Sun May 10 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"The old DCA might have worked if they made things with a bit more focus and quality.  A lot of the buildings and rides were lackluster.  If you compare the old facade outside Paradise Pier with how it is after the remodel you can see much more detail and craftsmanship in the molding and paint alone.    It was strange how bland some of the buildings were, not horrible, but not Disney standard.  I think when you theme an area you really need to make those details important or it becomes an obvious gimmick.  But if you make it with as much detail as possible you feel immersed and enjoy it.    It made sense for me because my favorite areas of the park before the renovation were Animation Academy (inside), Bugsland (even though I didn't enjoy any of the rides being an adult), and the Golden State area along Grizzly River Run to Condor Flats.  It's also why Carsland is so amazing.  Every detail of that area is fantastic to behold, and you're right, they captured that night scene so perfectly.  I'm actually surprised they're remodeling it but I guess it needed a bit more immersion.  I think my geology background enjoyed the rocks so much that was immersion enough for me :P"
Disneyland,35gv7l,cardassian_tailor,2,Sun May 10 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"Excellent points. Immersion certainly is key for the Disney experience as opposed to the less polished atmosphere of Knotts Berry Farm and to an even lesser extent, Six Flags. I liked the pier and the Beach Boys playing in the background but absolutely my favorite areas were in that Golden State area right at the entrance with Condor Flats and GRR. With Disney one should probably always expect innovations which is what makes it perpetually contemporary and relevant. Can't wait to see what they come up with next(please be Star Wars)."
Disneyland,35gv7l,OPWC,1 point,Sun May 10 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"The Star Wars talk is exciting but scary. It sounds like they could completely remodel the whole of Tomorrowland, not that it doesn't need it.    It sounds like a big challenge so I hope they really put effort into it before just making Star Wars Land"
Disneyland,35gv7l,blackseat,10,Sun May 10 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"Jim Hill discussed this somewhat on a recent podcast. Take it for what it's worth.  Walt was an absolute whore for putting in theme park versions of popular properties. The Swiss Family Robinson tree house (now Tarzan's Tree house in DL, of course) was conceived and installed inside of two years after the movie was a hit.  Frontierland was so heavily influenced by Davy Crockett that Fess Parker has his own window. Tom Sawyer's influence is obvious, too.  It's how it's always been, but I for one am getting a little tired of the Frozen blitz."
Disneyland,35gv7l,Puppy7505,2,Sun May 10 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"Great point. I think people often forget that Walt himself based a lot of what he put in the park off of his films/TV shows. There are people who think that this is a new thing, but it really isn't. Even Sleeping Beauty's Castle was named after a film.  I think there are just some people out there who just think that anything the current Disney/Disneyland administration does to the park is exactly the opposite of what Walt would have wanted."
Disneyland,35gv7l,Zandt88,2,Sun May 10 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"During the planning stages of Disneyland, Walt referred to the castle as Snow White's Castle.   However, with the the premiere of ""Sleeping Beauty"" just a few years away, plus the built-in publicity machine of a weekly television series, Walt saw a marketing opportunity to build buzz for a movie not yet released."
Disneyland,35gv7l,izookie,7,Mon May 11 22:43:15 2015 UTC,"But this is Disney. The whole concept to the rides was that each one has some back story. It's not just a haunted house ride, its ""The Haunted Mansion"" with the story of Mr. Gracey, The Bride, The Sea Captain. The whole idea was to give a level of depth to the rides by associating a story with them. This association and story, in the hands of imagineers (most of whom came from the animation studios) were complete enough to create the foundation for a movie or television show, as did happen (not well unfortunately) with the Haunted Mansion (fingers crossed for the next attempt), and the Pirates of the Caribbean (the movies then re-influenced the ride). So ... I believe that what is not already a movie in the parks... will be (take Tomorrowland as an example), and what in the parks is not movie themed will be. Its synergistic and makes it more than just another coaster at a park. The story drives the rides, and the rides drive stories."
Disneyland,35gv7l,veezy55,3,Sun May 10 11:55:22 2015 UTC,"Pirates of the Caribbean, for example did have somewhat of a backstory but the ride experience itself was less about a storyline and more about immersing the rider in the world of the pirates.  The fan fiction movement-esque treatment was applied and the universe was expanded then you had several longer-than-feature-length films with film characters jammed into the attraction."
Disneyland,35gv7l,dukenuk12,4,Sun May 10 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Along with the already mentioned idea that movies fuel desire for the park and vice versa, originality was necessary in the early days of Disneyland. There wasn't enough Disney material to fill all of Disneyland. Had Walt lived longer, I imagine we may have a few more great original rides, but no one can know for sure. I believe Disney themed rides are much more appealing and stand the test of time better. As long as they do not heavily alter original rides to adapt to later movies, I have no problem with it, I mean, look at how awesome Cars Land turned out."
Disneyland,35gv7l,chicklette,7,Sun May 10 08:25:55 2015 UTC,I miss this too but it's likely a thing of the past for US parks. I just wish the ones based on the movies weren't book report attractions. Come up with something new in the world of the film. I felt like Radiator Springs Racers did a good job of this while Mermaid is a book report.
Disneyland,35gv7l,dukenuk12,4,Sun May 10 15:59:54 2015 UTC,I felt like rsr was more like indiana jones - tells a story and brings you along for the ride.  I think its the best new ride at either park in forever.  :-)
Disneyland,35gv7l,Trabb_,2,Sun May 10 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"Me too. There's something about both of those, though, that are very skip-able for me. Probably the lines. I'll ride them if they're short lines but skip them if they're long."
Disneyland,35gv7l,Wonderground,3,Sun May 10 18:20:37 2015 UTC,The two newest rides in Hong Kong are original properties and both very great. I think we will see them come out still but clearly the company likes to use the properties they own and after just buying marvel and lucasfilm they have a lot of fresh story to use.
Disneyland,35gv7l,izookie,3,Sun May 10 09:21:57 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor, I would argue that those aren't original properties as they directly riff off of Big Thunder and Haunted Mansion. They're not exactly the same, but they're part of a formula that Disney knows is tried and true."
Disneyland,35gv7l,izookie,2,Sun May 10 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Mystic Manor was created because the cultural differences in how the people view ""ghosts"" and ""haunting"" in Hong Kong.  Still, I appreciate the uniqueness of the attraction.  I would say that Disney should test out characters in films, then I thought about how much the monkey in Mystic Manor looks and acts like Abu in Aladdin."
Disneyland,35gv7l,ThePaulAntonio,2,Sun May 10 19:53:13 2015 UTC,"Moreover, I dislike how popular characters are now Meet & Greet experiences rather than rides or shows.  Sometimes meeting Anna & Elsa is the longest wait at the Parks.  I know kids love it but it feels like the parks are going to become just a huge selfie opp."
Disneyland,35gv7l,Obie1,2,Sun May 10 19:57:24 2015 UTC,What would you consider original rides? Most of the attractions built are based off of some sort of already established entity.
Disneyland,35gv7l,elzbenz,6,Sun May 10 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"Space Mountain, Matterhorn, Big Thunder,  Jungle Cruise. There seems to be one in every ""land"" of Disneyland. In California Adventure there's also Screamin, Soarin', and Grizzly River Run. Might have missed one idk"
Disneyland,35gv7l,ihearttyty,2,Sun May 10 06:54:10 2015 UTC,Both Thunder and Jungle are based (albeit loosely) on movies.
Disneyland,35gv7l,ihearttyty,3,Sun May 10 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"This is probably a fact that is frequently regurgitated, however, it's interesting to note the the Jungle Cruise originally had strong origins in Disney's True-Life Adventures serials, and so, you could make a smart alec claim that it isn't in fact original.   And, you could also say, though more of a stretch, that Matterhorn Bobsleds was derived from the live action Disney movie ""Third Man on the Mountain"". Plus the Davy Crockett miniseries presence in frontierland.  It is said by some that the Disneyland synergy of the past is just less recognisable, rather than it not being present at all. However, I totally agree with all of this sediment.  Have had the pleasure to have ridden Mystic Manor, and it is incredible."
Disneyland,35gv7l,drawingonmyhands,7,Sun May 10 09:50:00 2015 UTC,I believe Tower of Terror was an original ride too! The Disney channel movie came out after the first ride was built.
Disneyland,35gv7l,lyssaaaa,4,Sun May 10 07:04:56 2015 UTC,"Ehhh a little bit of both. The Twilight Zone existed way before the ride. But yes, the episode that went with it wasn't made until after the ride."
Disneyland,35gv7l,LopsidedLolly,2,Sun May 10 07:10:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. I should've specified that. But did they actually make an episode about it? I thought they only made the movie."
Disneyland,35gv7l,Geeraff,2,Sun May 10 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"There was never an episode, just a made-for-TV movie."
Disneyland,35gv7l,SylviaPlathIsDead,1 point,Sun May 10 23:48:37 2015 UTC,I thought the movie came first! I didn't know it was the other way around... so weird.  .....I just looked it up...I probably thought that because I remember seeing the movie and then years  later the ride opening in California... I didn't know there was one in Florida at all.. this is wild!
Disneyland,35gv7l,invisiblette,2,Tue May 12 23:02:58 2015 UTC,"space mountain is based on a movie, matterhorn is too."
Disneyland,35gv7l,invisiblette,1 point,Mon May 11 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"It's a Small World, Astro-Orbiter, Innoventions, Autopia, Rivers of America (Mark Twain, Columbia)."
Disneyland,35gv7l,izookie,2,Sun May 10 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but here's a little bit of perspective: most of the original ride concepts (Pirates, Haunted, Matterhorn, etc) are original Walt Disney--- the man--- ideas, whereas now, in today's environment, it's easier to adapt existing concepts (Toy Story, Avatar, Frozen, etc) because of the built-in audience.  Why go original when you have such a catalog of great material to base rides on?  I'm not saying one way is better than the other, but sometimes you just go with the flow, especially when you don't have someone as singularly talented as Walt at the helm of the ship.  (For what it's worth, I do think original ride concepts are the best.)"
Disneyland,35gv7l,invisiblette,1 point,Sun May 10 06:56:13 2015 UTC,"I know movie-tagged rides were part of DL from the outset, but in the early days those movies were based mainly on classic novels and fairy tales (Tom Sawyer, Sleeping Beauty), so those rides felt less specifically branded than their later descendants."
Disneyland,35gv7l,ferryboatbill,1 point,Sun May 10 18:15:54 2015 UTC,"Branded rides don't give riders the reins, really -- they are more like forced extensions of the films than like separate unique individualizable experiences, whirlwinds of imagination as the original rides (It's a Small World, and the Matterhorn, for instance) were."
Disneyland,35gv7l,invisiblette,1 point,Sun May 10 18:18:45 2015 UTC,"Attractions need context.  The Disney difference is that the execution of the idea is top-notch from ride system to the texture of the rock-work, music and sound FX, and even scents.  The Matterhorn was inspired from a 1959 Disney film, Third Man on the Mountain.  Turns out that the attraction outlasted the popularity of the film.  If you think rides being overtly themed to Disney films, I think outright corporate sponsorships of attractions in the parks is more obnoxious (although, I recognized it could be FAR worse).  The thing is, Disney now has a HUGE library of films to give life and context to and Disney fans have come to expect their favorite Disney properties to be represented in the Parks.  Especially at Disneyland, attractions with lower ridership and less relevant context will have to give way (and room) to what kids (and kids-at-heart) today really want."

I was going to propose there because I know my wife likes our moments to be as private as possible but I knew its days were numbered so I picked an area that was more likely to be there as long as we're both alive so we can revisit it.
Disneyland,35gvvs,elmatador12,2,Sun May 10 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh this brought back a memory from childhood. I was in this exact spot with my mom when a couple characters came out.

Disneyland,35gvvs,Ferbooch,10,Sun May 10 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"OP posted a great spot.  A favorite place of mine is the walkway above the entrance to canoes. Timing is critical, you need to be there during the moment the Mark Twain sails by with a boatload of characters right after they cruise through Fantasmic. You can usually get a bunch of them to wave at you and it can be incredibly epic."

Disneyland,35gvvs,there4igraham,18,Sun May 10 14:29:47 2015 UTC,My wife and I always stop on the bridge next to Big Thunder where the train zips by. I proposed on that spot completely by accident. I was going to pop the question at the Court of Angels but I knew it was what Disney regarded as wasted space so I had a number of spots picked out. My wife had recently gotten into the habit of suggesting areas to propose around the park. We stopped at the bridge to watch the train and my wife cracked wise about me proposing and not dropping the ring in the water if I were to propose there.

So does seeing the characters out but ones like Mary Poppins and Snow White, even though I never much cared for them, they're so Disney that I get excited seeing them. The other magical spot would be the Peter Pan ride and Fantasyland in general. OR when you have the slow easy outside part of Splash Mountain and the music that's playing.   For DCA absolutely the racers ride, the whole thing is beautiful but I love when you enter their indoor radiator springs. Also nighttime around the bugs life area and in the bug theater.

Disneyland,35h0p7,NWSanta,1 point,Sun May 10 18:39:30 2015 UTC,I was talking with one of the employees there and he said right now they see about 75 K people a day through both parks. He anticipates after May 22nd that it will be over 125 K of people everyday!
Disneyland,35h0p7,inthedaylight,1 point,Sun May 10 18:46:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I will not be surprised if we hit max capacity multiple times.

Disneyland,35h0p7,inthedaylight,1 point,Sun May 10 21:01:10 2015 UTC,There is but it's not known how many guests that will take/
Disneyland,35h0p7,rextraverse,1 point,Sun May 10 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what everyone else has said, another metric to keep in mind with Disneyland attendance in the summer are the Annual Passholder blockout days - in particular the Deluxe.  Because of how Disneyland draws a significant number of  visitors from the local area, days where most passholders can't go may have slightly lower crowds than usual for a summer day (key phrase there being for a summer day)"
Disneyland,35gl5x,AXPendergast,3,Sun May 10 03:45:32 2015 UTC,I had no idea those were a thing. Where'd you get it?

They were only on sale for 3 days, and you could only buy one.  I think they may have been tied into the annual pass database, but I can't get a firm answer about that.  This is the Disneyland shirt.  For WDW, they had a ""Frozen"" theme, with Olaf on the front.    The Dopey shirt glows in the dark, while the Olaf shirt changes color in the sunshine."

I know it's not likely, but I'd love it if Disneyland went without the overlay for a year to give everybody a chance to enjoy the Hatbox Ghost."
Disneyland,35eh5h,drawingonmyhands,3,Sat May 9 21:56:09 2015 UTC,"I would guess that if they do the overlay this year, they won't take him out.  Maybe surround him with NBC props or even replace his face with something from the movie... but I bet he'll still be there."

Disneyland,35eh5h,geenaleigh,3,Sat May 9 21:37:28 2015 UTC,Just got to the park!!! First stop is the Hat Box ghost!!
Disneyland,35eh5h,MooMaddy,7,Sun May 10 20:02:50 2015 UTC,Here's a video!
Disneyland,35eh5h,verduccij,2,Sat May 9 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"Ok so I'm going later in the month and I don't want to spoil anything by watching the video, but what's the big deal with the hatbox ghost?"
Disneyland,35eh5h,NWSanta,4,Sun May 10 04:46:38 2015 UTC,The hatbox ghost is a bit of a Disney urban legend because it was an original animatronic when haunted mansion opened. It was removed shortly after the ride opened due to technical issues (?). Its now being brought back to the ride after 45 years with new tech.
Disneyland,35eh5h,DoomOne,2,Sun May 10 05:55:38 2015 UTC,Oh cool! Thanks for the explanation.
Disneyland,35eh5h,LibraryKrystal,2,Sun May 10 07:03:18 2015 UTC,Yeah it was removed because the ambient lighting of the ride wouldn't allow for the face to fully disappear before materializing in the hatbox therefor it was scrapped. But now with enough advancement in technology they are able to create the illusion the way it was envisioned. So excited to see it next weekend and the weekend after that. (Annual Passholder)
Disneyland,35eh5h,Vidogo,2,Sun May 10 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"Sad, that we missed that! Very cool! Missed it by a month!"
Disneyland,35eh5h,LibraryKrystal,2,Sun May 10 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen this guy on video dozens of times in varying conditions, and I still can't figure out how it's done. It will be years before I can go back."
Disneyland,35eh5h,Vidogo,2,Sun May 10 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"He looks really good!  Did they manage to actually use a head sculpt?  One thing I'm not digging is the sound effects when his head appears/disappears - it sounds too much like generic ""Disney magic."""
Disneyland,35eh5h,bwslayer,1 point,Sat May 9 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"In the Orlando Mansion, they replaced the mirrors for the hitch-hiking ghosts with CGI versions of them, that swap peoples heads around and/or blow them up like balloons... along with ridiculous cartoon sound effects. I'm not a fan of that change."
Disneyland,35eh5h,papersorplastics,1 point,Sun May 10 13:44:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen that in person a few times, but wasn't really bothered by the sounds (I don't remember them) so much as the flat appearance of the ghosts.  I'm sure kids get a huge kick out of that gag, though."
Disneyland,35eh5h,kekepania,0,Sun May 10 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, no doubt. Definitely a change for the kids - myself, it just made me nostalgic for the old effect."
Disneyland,35gsp3,yungthuglife,7,Sun May 10 05:14:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not a CP, I'm a CR.  I've said it a million times and I'll say it again. There are so many opportunities here at the Disneyland Resort, and it's up to you to take advantage of them. I've talked about my hope to spend my career here in the Broadcast Operations department, but I'd like to talk about a friend of mine this time.  My friend, AJ, we'll call him, came into the company with no clue what to do. He and I became friends and I started inviting him to all types of cast events. We've been VoluntEARS, auditioned for Traditions, even helped as Disney Reps during special events. We've both worked for less than a year.  A few months ago, he decided he wanted to continue his career here, but he was gonna go big. He wants to become the next CEO of Disney.   We've gone to the info sessions for Emerging Leaders and spoken to the managers about our goals here. Last week, AJ became a Lead.  To answer your questions, it really depends on you and how hard you work and how you take advantage of the programs here. It's going to be tough as a CP/CR, but if you really do want to stay here at the Resort, you gotta tough it out.   One key thing: figure out what you want to do. You can find a home in TDA at an office job. We have firefighters, nurses, and even veterinarians. There's a place for almost everyone here."
Disneyland,35gsp3,mildly_interesting,2,Sun May 10 18:13:42 2015 UTC,Do you know what the prospects are of being hired externally without any experience as a CM or CP in regards to TDA jobs? Do they hire from mostly from within or is it possible join without any park work experience?
Disneyland,35gsp3,blackseat,2,Sun May 10 21:43:47 2015 UTC,It's mostly internal
Disneyland,35gsp3,mildly_interesting,2,Sun May 10 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"From what I've been reading, it seems like only CMs get good hours since they pay for housing but CR hours vary which would make it hard to afford to live in Socal. Also I fear that it is easy to ""move up"" in the company since it has such a high turnover rate due to kids going back to college but at the same time how well do those lead jobs pay?"
Disneyland,35goyg,meeksters,5,Sun May 10 04:28:07 2015 UTC,"You would do this when you buy your pass, not when you enter the parks each time. So when you buy it, they'll ask to see your driver's license or some other form of ID. Maybe even a utility bill or paystub? Not too sure about that part."
Disneyland,35goyg,dodgepodge,3,Sun May 10 06:51:53 2015 UTC,"When you buy the pass at the ticket booth, you have to show some kind of proof that you live in Southern California. This can be any government issued ID or a utility bill that has your name and address. I used my CSULB ID when I first moved down here, as I didn't have anything else yet that said I lived in SoCal.  After you purchase your pass, they'll take your picture at the turnstiles that will be connected with your pass so you won't have to show your ID again after that first visit (takes a couple days for pic to sync)."
Disneyland,35goyg,kelsey0403,1 point,Sun May 10 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"They usually don't bother checking your ID since the pass comes with a photo, you just have to get your photo taken by PhotoPass and you're good to go. Some cast members working the turnstiles can ask you for an ID if you don't go get your picture taken but the times that I've had my pass without my photo taken, they usually politely direct me to go get my photo taken by a PhotoPass member."
Disneyland,35goyg,mikeezy6,1 point,Sun May 10 15:30:52 2015 UTC,"Also adding onto this, I'm not so sure of having to show proof of residency, but when you're applying to get an Annual Pass, you just have to put your address down and it checks if it's within boundary of Southern California and from there it should tell you if you qualify for that pass or not."
Disneyland,35goyg,mikeezy6,1 point,Sun May 10 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"If it's not super busy sometimes they do the photos right at the turnstiles. They are doing the more and more for other tickets as well. I think mainly multiple day ones. But I've gotten caught behind families getting theirs done at the entrance. The CM is always so apologetic about the wait. I just tell them that I'm cool and take their time. I mean I go at least once a month so if I miss something this time I can come back.   Sometimes for fun I'll toss a little FYI at the family that I just got stuck behind. Like last time, I knew that there were going to be a ton of characters at the ranch and they had four youngish kids with them. So I told the parents to be sure to go check out the baby goats and who knows who might be there. I ran into them later and it turns out Mickey and Minnie were there. And Pluto and Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh. The kids flipped out. dad said it made their day"
Disneyland,35gn4e,cmckzee,5,Sun May 10 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"We stayed at the Super 8 that's on Katella. $80/night. Not bad at all. About a 12 min walk to the entrance of the parks. The free breakfast isn't bad either. Better than a lot of other places I've been to. You could find a hotel for about $115 directly across the street. It just depends on how much you're willing to pay for how close. Next time we go, I want to stay right across to minimize walking time and energy spent walking (every little bit counts for me haha)."
Disneyland,35gn4e,ihearttyty,2,Sun May 10 07:12:07 2015 UTC,"Me and my gf stayed Menage..Minage? Not sure how its spelled or if that is even the exact name but its at least very similar to that. Its pretty close to the park and its very nice, i would compare it to a miniature version of the Wynn in las vegas. The price wasnt too bad when we went either it was actually very good compared to some of the dingy places around at the time."
Disneyland,35gn4e,wobba_fett,2,Sun May 10 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really call Hotel Indigo right across the street. I know technically, it is, but not from Main Gate. It's about a half mile walk to get to Main Gate from Indigo or the Super 8 that another mentioned. I've stayed at both and really like them, but my favorite is the Ramada Main Gate. It's literally 500 ft from the entrance. Great breakfast, comfy beds and a seriously decent price for how close you are. It you do some digging and plan it right, you can get rooms there for about 74 a night. We usually pay about 86. The extra few bucks compared to the Super 8 is totally worth it at the end of a long Disney day. Plus, we like our naps. :) Have fun!!"
Disneyland,35gn4e,CanYou_Not,1 point,Mon May 11 15:14:57 2015 UTC,And how does one get a room at the Ramada for $74 a night?
Disneyland,35gn4e,randomosis,2,Fri May 15 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"Last fall they ran a special in November that if you prepaid the rooms were $74 a night. I want to say there was a stipulation that you had to stay 3 nights or something like that. I just keep a super close eye on their specials and I am a member of the rewards program, so that helps a lot. I highly suggest it!"
Disneyland,35gn4e,CanYou_Not,2,Sat May 16 05:06:31 2015 UTC,Hotel indigo is the best value around and right across the street.
Disneyland,35gn4e,Christophercs,1 point,Sun May 10 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the hotels in the area are within walking distance or have a shuttle that drops you off and picks you up. I'm sorry I'm not much help on specific hotels since I'm a local, but check out any of the major chains in the area (Holiday Inn, Hilton, etc.). It looks like you're going right after the summer season ends, so you'll probably be able to get a good rate at any hotel."
Disneyland,35gn4e,stormeegedon,1 point,Sun May 10 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"I stayed t Quality Inns and Suits Anaheim at the park. It was within walking distance. My sister and I would walk up to the Grand Californian every morning and cut through there to get to the parks. I would also suggest looking at getting tickets to the ART transport, as that's how we got back every night so we wouldn't have to walk back."
Disneyland,35gn4e,FMFire,1 point,Sun May 10 21:02:30 2015 UTC,Homewood Suites is nice.  Also their breakfast buffet thing has a waffle iron.
Disneyland,35gn4e,CydonPrax,1 point,Mon May 11 04:19:03 2015 UTC,We stayed at the Holiday Inn around the corner and it seemed like a pretty good deal. Not a lot of ~magic~ in the actual hotel/room but it's a nice place to sleep and a pretty short walk to the parks and Downtown Disney.
Disneyland,35gn4e,leets-deets,1 point,Mon May 11 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"The most important part of my childhood was staying at the Peacock Suites EVERY time we went to Disneyland. My family was nowhere near as wealthy as we are now (we are avg. middle class now) and we have stayed there because of the price and size of the rooms. They recently updated all of the rooms and they are BEAUTIFUL! clean, comfortable, and close to the park. I suggest paying the 5 dollars and taking the shuttle to and from the park, unless you are driving.  Another favorite of mine is the Tropicana inn, which is not as clean or nice but is good enough and very very close to the park."
Disneyland,35gn4e,Valariie,1 point,Mon May 11 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"We stayed in the Best Western Courtesy Inn without issue during our last stay. I don't recall the exact price, but I always do a metric ton of research on things and it passed my ""bang-for-the-buck"" scrutiny. The room was nothing special, but all we did was sleep and shower there.   One of the biggest pros for me was that they didn't charge for parking and it was walking distance to the trams which saved us a bit in parking. One thing I should mention though is that the walk to the tram has stairs through the parking garage, so it is a little difficult for ADA or stroller-bound guests."

Disneyland,35fujo,lego606,1 point,Sun May 10 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"I booked DGC for the beginning of June for my honeymoon. My best advice is to call over and over and not get discouraged at the price. I called about 6 or 7 times and got 6 or 7 different stories on prices, availability, etc. eventually I got a girl who gave me 20% off. Like seriously, don't call and try to negotiate, just be polite and ask about specials and you will get a different story every time. Book the first one you like, and then call every week or so and change your reservation if they offer you something better. Good luck!"
Disneyland,35fujo,feedthekitty,1 point,Sun May 10 14:50:15 2015 UTC,Try booking through hotels.com instead of the Disney site. I just booked a room at the Grand Californian a couple weeks ago for the end of the month!
Disneyland,35fujo,kelsey0403,1 point,Sun May 10 15:57:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have a lot of great advice more than what others have said.   I checked a some time frames in August (I don't know the exact dates but I checked some of the weekends as  well as full weeks) and it looks the they should have availability for standard rooms but they start at $440 a night and go up from there.  Unfortunately the three Disney hotels are VERY expensive even for ""standard"" rooms in comparison to other hotels in the area.  Like others have said call and see if any deals can be made (be sure to mention the occasion). $400/night is pretty typical for the DLH especially in summer but hopefully Disney can help!"
Disneyland,35cbd5,hugitoutguys,11,Fri May 8 22:59:32 2015 UTC,My husband is currently on his fourth deployment. The week before he deployed we made one last trip to disneyland and he got this beautiful picture of a pink sunset behind screamin. We had just gotten off the ride. It was a great day and a beautiful memory. Our second wedding anniversary was two days ago and I had a huge box delivered that evening. He had the picture turned into a three canvas painting and shipped to me! I'm so happy to relieve that moment every day now.

If you stay at a Disney hotel, you'll get the new 60th room keys, stationary, etc. and 1 hour early entrance to whichever park is offering it that day.   Some of the hotels have special events on Christmas itself, otherwise they're just decorated and the Grand usually has holiday entertainment"
Disneyland,35cy8k,lego606,1 point,Sat May 9 05:06:19 2015 UTC,Thank-you so much!  Tough call but we may just skip it then... it's hard to swallow the cost of just 2 days at Disney.
Disneyland,35cy8k,Kierz10TheRaven,2,Sat May 9 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"With Christmas at Disneyland you get all the best decorations and some of the rides have holiday overlay like Small World (Jingle Bells), Haunted Mansion (Nightmare Before Christmas), and Jungle Cruise (Jingle Cruise). I know Disney is expensive but I know that in the future we will be saving up to plan a trip to the park around holiday times just so we can experience the park in a totally new way. My husband hasn't been at Halloween and hasn't experienced Mansion that way yet and I've never been at Christmas. Just something to take into consideration, it'll be something new!"

Disneyland,35csuf,Rhaylin,8,Sat May 9 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"That is a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, Disney will not allow you to get married in the park without buying one of their packages. If they catch you trying (and in front of the castle they probably will since that area sees so much foot traffic and they have photopass photographers standing around) they may kick you out...not a happy memory for your wedding day. I know someone who tried by snow whites wishing well, but it was nipped in the bud immediately and they had to leave. I hope you guys can figure something else out. Good luck and congratulations on the wedding!"
Disneyland,35csuf,Kbrittain27,6,Sat May 9 16:41:47 2015 UTC,Thank you! And that is an excellent point -- I don't want our wedding to end with us being kicked from the park! That would be a nightmare!
Disneyland,35csuf,stormeegedon,10,Sat May 9 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"As people have been mentioning, your plan will be shut down almost immediately. I think having your ceremony elsewhere and then going to Disneyland for your honeymoon with your son would be just as memorable. It's also worth a shot calling up the wedding/engagement phone line and explaining your situation. Maybe they'll be able to work out a small, 30 minute ceremony package for you for a lower price."
Disneyland,35csuf,laptopgirl42,3,Sat May 9 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"I think I am going to give that a shot! I checked the Disney weddings website and saw that there was a ""memories"" package which was almost everything I am looking for with the one (MAJOR) exception that it was only offered at Disneyworld! I was toying with the idea of contacting someone at Disneyland to see if there was a way to use the ""memories"" package in California instead of Florida! Fingers cross that they will be able to accommodate! :) but I definitely want it to be an enjoyable experience, not one where we had to break rules or be sneaky...!"
Disneyland,35csuf,laptopgirl42,5,Sun May 10 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"You can actually get married at the castle, but you have to do so either before the parks opens or after it closes, it has to be a relatively small wedding and all your guests have to pay for it.  If you're open to alternate locations, I would suggest trying the Grand California Hotel. It's the best hotel on disney property, and the wedding package is probably a bit cheaper there than inside the park. You can get married there at any time you chose and then go into the parks for some fun."
Disneyland,35csuf,mildly_interesting,2,Sat May 9 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"I will have to check that out! I saw the package to get married in front of the castle, but since there won't be any guests (just us and our boy) I thought that was wildly unnecessary!"

Disneyland,35csuf,BudgetFairyTale,6,Sun May 10 05:09:18 2015 UTC,You can pay disney $10k and have all guests pay for entry... that is about as cheap as it legally gets. We just had a nice wedding elsewhere and tastefully added a few disney accessories.

It's always interesting how people comment that about how Disneyland was built in less than a year, but they fail to realize how much has been completely replaced and redone and improved upon. As far as many kids know today, Jack Sparrow has always been in PotC, and PotC the ride has always been in the park since opening day.  It has taken 60 years to get where DL is now, and it is still far from perfect (I'm looking at you Tomorrowland!).  Walt was right, ""Disneyland will never be completed.  It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world."""

I live in California and for 9 years we've only ever talked online. We planned to meet and then go to both parks. We were both shy but we enjoyed the day nonetheless.   In the middle of New Orleans, after Pirates of the Caribbean, surrounded by people, we shared our first kiss. I told her I loved her during the fireworks and she said it right back.   One year later, we're going back to Disneyland on the 22nd for the Diamond celebration. I'm gonna steal another kiss at the same spot and we're gonna enjoy the fireworks all over again."

Disneyland,356tmh,Hyro0o0,2,Thu May 7 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. I was just thinking that since they had previews for the Frozen shows, they might do the same for Mad T Party.   Oftentimes in live theatre/performances they'll want to run it a few times with every aspect of what to expect during the run (costumes, lighting, sound, audience) so that they're fully prepared and comfortable during the grand opening.   I guess we'll see!"

Disneyland,3530ot,Not_Steve,5,Wed May 6 20:54:02 2015 UTC,Nothing is stopping you from buying the churro bites and importing them to Disneyland.

The black boat came out and was ready to push us back, but the mechanic got it running again."
Disneyland,355cmf,groovysqirrel,2,Thu May 7 23:19:00 2015 UTC,I've seen them use similar boats to prepare Fantasmic. One time I was on the last Mark Twain ride of the night and spotted these boats coming out from hidden areas.

Disneyland,355sjp,imOnWelfare,10,Thu May 7 10:15:27 2015 UTC,although the GC has a nicer bar   You hurt Sam's feelings.
Disneyland,355sjp,Mathavian,5,Thu May 7 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I would say yes for booking a hotel if you're doing 2 days but not Grand Californian because of the cost. If you can afford it, then yes. GC is very nice but if you are only going to sleep there then it doesn't really justify the cost especially if you only go for one day."
Disneyland,355sjp,Mistress_Amaya,4,Thu May 7 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's worth it. You can probably get a room at one of the nearby hotels for 1/3 of the price of a Disney hotel, so that would be the way to go regardless of how many days you're going.  That being said, will you be going in time to take advantage of the So Cal ticket deal? If so, definitely go for one park on each day."
Disneyland,355sjp,dodgepodge,2,Thu May 7 10:51:56 2015 UTC,"If cost is an issue, I'd recommend finding another hotel nearby. From personal experience, GC is nice but far too expensive. There are plenty of hotels within walking distance of the parks for a quarter of the price."
Disneyland,355sjp,jasonbamrad,2,Thu May 7 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"My wife and I do this Evey new years...and we live 20 minutes away.  Its totally worth it...but, not the grand Californian.  If you have the BS money to burn, then go for it.  Other wise, the disneyland hotel is pretty sweet."
Disneyland,355sjp,klaceo,2,Thu May 7 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it if you have the money. The best part of staying at a Disney property is the Magic Morning which gets you in the park an hour before the general public. The DCA Magic Mornings are the best as every attraction is open and you can ride them all in under an hour with no lines. Get in line for the park 30 minutes before the magic morning then go strait to Radiator Racers, then Toy Story, Screamin, Tower, then Soarin. Should be able to do it all in 1 hour and then you can enjoy the rest of the day without feeling like you are missing out on anything"
Disneyland,355sjp,Beebster1,1 point,Thu May 7 17:24:29 2015 UTC,Maybe decide ahead of time how much you feel comfortable spending then search around for a great deal?

GCH is never worth it if you're trying to determine whether or not you should part with your money. Like others have said, when you can afford not to ask this question, that is when GCH is worth it.

Disneyland,354g75,Bijanadactyl,2,Thu May 7 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"The Black Pearl is delicious! One of my personal favorites! Also, take a trip over to Trader Sam's at the Disneyland Hotel. Have your friend order a Kungaloosh, and ask for the old recipe."

Disneyland,354g75,jasonbamrad,3,Fri May 8 02:16:01 2015 UTC,"People have mentioned some of the special drinks - Fun Wheel, Black Pearl, Neverland. Another one that I do not think is on the menu, but is offered, is the Zombie (pretty potent). My girlfriend had the Fun Wheel, which she likes, and I've had the Neverland, which is quite delicious and potent as well. The table next to me had a lady order a couple rounds of the Zombie and she was having a great time.   You mentioned that you're not 21, so these drinks really don't apply. But, there are still a lot of food options. There aren't any secret food items, though. But, I recommend the Lobster Nachos. They are a fairly large portion and can be shared. Or you can be like me and eat an order to yourself. The views are great, but the lines can be long too, so be prepared for that."
Disneyland,354g75,SushiRoe,3,Thu May 7 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"Those damn Lobster nachos.  I remember a few years ago no-one ever went in the Cove Bar.  There was rarely more than half a dozen people there, and they weren't even set up to have a line waiting.  Then peeps on social media started talking about the lobster nachos and within a month or two, I started seeing a line outside and packed tables.  So crazy that it was an undiscovered jewel for so long, I wish it had stayed a little more secret. :D"
Disneyland,354g75,OrthodoxAtheist,2,Fri May 8 09:00:38 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the lobster nachos definitely have created a line to Cove Bar that will never go down.

Disneyland,354oko,centracing,2,Thu May 7 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain you'll have fireworks, Fantasmic, and World of Color on the first day, Sunday. After that, there are no guarantees. Plus, Disneyland will likely be closed at least one of the days during your trip for Mickey's Halloween Party. If at all possible, watch World of Color then.  I would imagine Paint the Night will run most nights."
Disneyland,354oko,dodgepodge,2,Thu May 7 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"Ya I've penciled in Fantasmic for Sunday. Going to do the Blue Bayou dining package. It's my fiancés birthday on the 6th so we're going all out. We may do the halloween party, depends on how it works on our schedule because we're only in the parks 3 nights, we fly out on the 7th after a half day in the parks."
Disneyland,354oko,dodgepodge,2,Thu May 7 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"If there are two Fantasmic shows on that Sunday, request tickets for the later one. You may be able to watch the parade beforehand AND watch the fireworks from the Rivers of America (it's not the same as watching in front of the castle, but it's not bad, and they play the music and even have some effects to emulate those in front of the castle."
Disneyland,354oko,dodgepodge,2,Thu May 7 02:38:34 2015 UTC,Ya worst comes to worst We can cram all the Disneyland shows into one day I suppose. With the dining package can you request what show you get tickets to?
Disneyland,352iem,bugboots,5,Wed May 6 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"Okay first off, we have no clue what will be going on next Feb. so don't get too wrapped up in planning shows etc.  Your plan is solid. Just keep checking for when you can book. So you can get that in right away.   Character breakfast at least once. First day might be an awesome kickoff. Park hoppers aren't as needed if you just plan that today is one park, tomorrow is another.   For the night you arrive there's not much in downtown Disney but it might be nice to just be chill. Settle in, finalize the game plan. There is the Lego store which the boys will love. Dinner at the rainforest cafe might be fun. You guys might want to get any tee shirts, ears etc at World of Disney that night rather than wait until you are in the park.  And make sure each of the kids has some kind of autograph book. Getting character autographs is a great keepsake. They can put a photo of them with the character on the facing page and even add photos from around the park. If possible make sure they all have some kind of camera, even just a 'cheap' disposable, so they can take their own photos of things they want to remember. That can help keep the 'buy me' down to a minimum.   And make sure everyone has some kind of bag to carry their own things. You'll get real tired of having to be the pack mule for windbreakers, water bottles etc. even just one of those drawstring bags that you can wear like a backpack is good."
Disneyland,352iem,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Wed May 6 16:35:52 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the response. The drawstring bag idea is great!
Disneyland,352iem,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Fri May 8 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"It's what I do. I happened upon a plain looking one at a Marshalls or such. Had a side pocket for a water bottle. Works great for holding my windbreaker, sunscreen etc. I have a hip bag I got at the park that is just the right size for my pass, money and such. With those I don't have to get a locker unless I go shopping. Which I will do during the holidays when I want to get peppermint fudge etc. when I go in a week or two I'll start looking for 60th stuff. I want the CD collection for sure. So I might get a locker for that stuff."
Disneyland,352iem,BuddyCheque,3,Fri May 8 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"I can't speak on booking as I don't know much on specifics and I think there are more knowledgeable people on that here.  I love the Grand Californian and I am also in a family of 5 (although older, my youngest brother is older than your oldest, 19, 16 and 13) but we found we had room space issues at the Californian ~5 years ago now and that was even with my dad not being able to come at the last minute and it being a family of 4. And the Californian is pricey. When we were in Disneyland last March we stayed at a place within walking distance and got two rooms. I don't want to dissuade from going to the Grand Californian, especially being your first time, because it is amazing IMO, I'm just giving you my family's recent experience. I've never done the Club Level and I don't entirely know what it is, but I never felt I missed out on anything with the amount of food options in Disneyland and in the surrounding area.   For the first night, I would say Downtown Disney would be your best bet. You won't be able to see any of the Park's shows inside Downtown Disney, but you can see the fireworks from most outside places around Disneyland.  Park Hopper is worth it if you want to do both parks on the same day and with a short trip, I would say it's better just so you have the opportunity to see more and you aren't stuck in one park each day, but again it's up to you. Magic Morning is only for Disneyland so you can't get to Radiator Springs with that.  For the Star Wars kid, definitely Tomorowland and Star Tours and I don't know what's happening with the Marvel stuff because it was in Innoventions (in Tomorrowland) and the last I heard it was up in the air about what's happening in there, especially with your time frame.  Waterbottles are good if you don't want to buy drinks every time you or your kids get thirsty and a small bag to carry things would be nice. And the pool depends on the hotel, I liked the Grand Californian one, and with me being from Canada I would think swimming in Anaheim wouldn't be a problem provided it wasn't grey or rainy.  You could play the Character Breakfast by ear, but I'm not sure about the specifics and the requirements for when to do it. The only time I've ever done one was my first time at Disneyland at a lot younger age.  I am also speaking as a person who has been to Disneyland multiple times and the first time I went was 11 years ago now so my family and I know what we personally want to do and what not to do just from our experiences, so some of my advice might not fit with you being at Disneyland for the first time and wanting a good time for your kids, especially when you say it could be their only time."
Disneyland,352iem,CanYou_Not,1 point,Wed May 6 16:43:28 2015 UTC,Thanks so much!
Disneyland,352iem,CanYou_Not,5,Fri May 8 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"First off, February is one of my absolute favorite times to go to Disneyland.(next to the Fall) If you get lucky, it will rain and you will have the park to yourself. I can't really comment on the GC because I have never stayed there, but only hear great things. We usually stay off property, but within like 500 feet of the main gate. It saves us a boatload of money and the rooms are comfy. Besides you'll spend most of your time in the park anyway.   Weekdays are great, should be nice and calm in the parks. I would suggest a park hopper. If for some reason one park gets super crowded, we jump over to the other one and it's a nice change of pace. I do like my Friday nights in the park. Not really sure what is different about it, maybe just because we get to stay later? I don't know, but I love it.   As far as gear goes, I would suggest a small backpack. I usually just carry a larger purse, but depending on your wife, that may be a burden to her. I suggest small snacks for throughout the day or in line and a couple water bottles. My personal favorite is a Hydroflask, available on amazon, they're great.  I have been in February the last two years. One year it was pouring and absolutely freezing, the other we were in tanks and shorts. California weather is fickle, dress in layers and you'll be golden!  Most importantly, have fun!!!"
Disneyland,352iem,Erinsonstage,2,Wed May 6 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"Afterthought:  This is our favorite off site hotel to stay at. It's literally a 3 minute walk from the main gate. If you decide to stay there, I suggest signing up for Wyndam Rewards to rack up some points, or check the actual website, sometimes they have AAA deals!"
Disneyland,352iem,Kbrittain27,1 point,Wed May 6 22:39:12 2015 UTC,Awesome! I will check out the Ramada.
Disneyland,352iem,okaywhatnowred,4,Fri May 8 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"Being a lifelong SoCal resident, AP holder, and now CM, I can't give the best travel/hotel advice but I will try to help out with everything else!   For your first night, doing dinner in Downtown Disney is a great option. They have a ton of wonderful options and the atmosphere is always fun, if slightly more quiet on weekdays.  As far as dining in the parks goes, Big Thunder Ranch is a great option. Plaza Inn is really good for lunch and dinner, Boardwalk Pizza and Pasta in DCA is great, and Pizza Port is always fun.   A big thing to keep in mind is that going in February does mean fewer crowds, but it also is off-peak season. Weekday hours are shorter (parks typically close at 8pm Monday-Thursday off-peak) and evening shows will most likely be limited. I'm not sure what the schedule will be, but I'd be willing to bet that Fireworks and possibly the new night parade and Fantasmic! Will only be available on Friday, but don't quote me on that. With this being the Diamond Anniversary year schedules might differ from the norm.   Marvel characters should be back in the parks in Tomorrowland by February, which is also where you will find the Jedi Training Academy, a must for any Star Wars fan. You can ask any Entertainment Host (they wear badges that say ""Ask Me About Characters"") about the Marvel characters, or go to City Hall and ask them to call Toon Finder.  In regards to weather, February can be quite cold and, or it can be 80° and sunny. This last year the last weekend of February the temps were in the 50's and it rained cats and dogs, but the week before that had been lovely and warm. Be prepared for any kind of weather, and be sure to check in advance!  For your Saturday morning, I definitely recommend the Storytellers Cafe character breakfast. The food is really good, and I think it's a nice send-off, even if you're not super into characters.   If you're interested in the Lilly Belle, definitely check in at the Main Street station first thing, and just be really friendly with the CM. It's been many years since I've been in the Lily Belle so I don't know the process of getting to ride in it these days, but I do know it's important to try early in the day! Another fun thing is asking to ride in the front of the Monorail.   That's everything I can think of, but if you have other questions don't hesitate to ask! :)"
Disneyland,352iem,okaywhatnowred,1 point,Wed May 6 16:51:00 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! I'm sure you'll see me more in the coming months. ;)
Disneyland,352iem,stacasaurusrex,2,Fri May 8 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have your trip extremely well planned! A few things I would like to mention. If you can afford to stay in the grand, stay in the grand! It is truly the best Disney has to offer (hotel wise) in CA, and it's worth doing once. The exclusive entrance to California Adventure is an awesome bonus. I have only stayed there once, but it was a great time.  As far as the day you arrive, downtown Disney is your best bet for a little Disney Magic before you arrive. I live in northern CA and before I had an annual pass, I would always got downtown Disney to boost my excitement level (not that it needed boosting). You Won't be able to see any shows, except for fireworks, which usually come on about 9:30. Still, walking through world of Disney and visiting some of the other shops is fun. If you need a little more Disney action on your first night and Downtown Disney does not do it for you, walk through the Disneyland hotel, I love looking at all the Disney stuff in there even though I have never been a guest.  As far as your ticket, I highly recommend getting the park hopper because the two parks are extremely close together and it's nice to be able to have the option to walk across the Esplanade to the other park if you want a different vibes or if crowds start to pick up. February is one of the best times to visit Disneyland. It is usually one of least crowded times to visit, although these days it seems like there is never a time where crowds are light, but still your best bet. Southern CA is tricky with its weather in Feb. It might be in the 90s one weekend and raining the next. A SoCal resident might be your best bet for this question, but in the last couple years I have been to Disneyland 3 times in February and it has been hot 2 times (shorts and tshirt) and freezing raining once (bundle up). It'll still be great either way, one of the bonuses to rain is it almost always detracts crowds, but then you don't really get to use the pool...either way you guys will have a great time. Another thing to think about is Disney usually closes rides for refurbishment after the busy holiday season, so some rides may be closed in February. When I was there in February, Peter Pan, Matterhorn, soarin, splash mountain, and Winnie the Pooh were all closed :( we have annual passes so it's not that big of a deal, but for a once in a lifetime visit that might be a bummer. February is still a great time to visit, but I just wanted to bring that to your attention. One thing I will note on character meals, I am sooo not a character person. I refuse to wait in lines for characters, but recently I did the plaza in character breakfast and it really warmed my heart. Seeing the characters interact with other guests and when they would come up to us was just so cool. If your kids grew up on Disney movies I would highly recommend it just once. I am 23 and thought it was a pretty magical experience.  As far as marvel things in the park, they recently closed innoventions which housed all the meet and greets with marvel characters and memorabilia from the films, I am sure their will be a new home for it by the time you guys get here, Disney has slowly been incorporating more marvel stuff in the parks, so who knows what could be there next feb.  a couple things I will add are to check out the night time shows in Disneyland and California adventure. World of color and fantasmic are not to be missed. I'm not a big fireworks person I will stop to watch them, but I don't like to camp out on Main Street for hours to get the perfect spot. If you are interested in viewing them in a decent spot, but don't want to wait hours try watching from the train station on Main Street. It's not the best spot but you definitely get a great view of the castle and fireworks!   I hope this helps, you guys will have a wonderful time!"

Disneyland,352iem,YoeSafBridge,2,Fri May 8 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"I have never stayed at the Grand California but if it was within my means, and I was on vacation, I would want to go all out - the hotel is beautiful, and it is pretty cool to get to walk right into California Adventure from the hotel. When I stayed in June, the magic morning alternated from day to day. I might suggest going for a weekend, perhaps Friday-Tuesday or so (as long as it isn't Valentine's day) because like many others have mentioned, most of the evening shows go dark in peak season during the week -- and some of the most impressive parts of the Disney experience.   I might suggest having dinner at Goofy's Kitchen at the Disneyland hotel if you are looking to have a Disney experience the night before. Aside from the giant Disney Store, Downtown Disney is mostly just an outdoor mall. Goofy's Kitchen is the only character meal served at dinner time -- there is a pretty large variety of food and 6-7 characters that come by each table. The kids will likely love getting to see the characters in this setting even if they aren't as into the characters...seeing/meeting disney characters is part of the Magic of Disney, and it's doubtful any of them will want to wait in line to meet any of them in the park.  (also, definitely try the Peanut butter and Jelly pizza - trust me, it is amazing)  World of Color and the Disneyland fireworks are absolute musts in my book. Paint the Night doesn't debut for a few weeks, but it looks extraordinary too. I highly recommend the World of Color dining package -- you get a pretty good 3 course meal with all the magic of Disney -- and you get VIP seating to World of Color which is worth the price of meal to me (will also save you a lot of wait time, as people tend to line up hours in advance because prime seating is preferred for this show.  When I go, I like to eat my way around the parks because I truly consider it part of the magic. Disney knows how to do food...specifically junk food.  Things you should definitely try during your stay -- fresh hot Mickey Mouse Beignets at The Cafe Orleans near pirates of the Carribean for breakfast one morning. Cheap, fast, Disney themed and delicious. (My mom and I make the 30 minute drive to disneyland just to have beignets and ride pirates some Sundays.) Big Thunder BBQ is delicious and all you can eat, so those growing boys will definitely get stuffed! The skewers at Bangle BBQ across from Indiana Jones are to die for (bacon.wrapped.asparagus.) Dole Whip, Churros, and I never leave the park without a matterhorn macaroon from the Jolly holiday bakery on Main Street. I'd skip Blue Bayou -- it's way over priced and you get crammed in there -- unless you are sitting by the water, it isn't worth eating there.   Try and utilize the fast pass program to the best of your advantage. For most rides, you can only have one fast pass out at a time but there are a few in California adventure you can have all at once. Radiator Springs Racers, California Screamin', and World of Color are off the grid. That means you can have all three of these fastpasses at the same time..  I suggest getting park hoppers going with the park hoppers because it really is nice to pop back and forth for a change of pass on a long day...  Hope you have an amazing time!!!"

Disneyland,352iem,OrthodoxAtheist,1 point,Fri May 8 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"I can't answer hotel questions but I will do my best for the others :)  -I think Downtown Disney will be awesome for you to do when you first arrive- you can shop in the stores for shirts or hats to wear the next day, and plan out what you want to do and see!  -When I was at the Disney park a couple weeks ago, the Innovations area was still closed, so I'm not aware if they've reopened it yet.   -Every time I pass by the Character Brunch, I see a ton of characters, even the rare Captain Hook. Maybe figure out which characters you haven't seen, and if the brunch is worth it (the one at the hotel I would assume have the same characters?), go so you can see the ones you didn't! I recommend going just because it looks like fun, and would be a nice way to end your trip!   -You HAVE to do a park hopper! Ca Adventure is so much fun in my opinion, and GREAT for adults because they have their wine and beer license! You can walk around the park and sip on wine :) The park hopper ticket allows you to go back and forth for the day between the two, as long as you get the hand stamp. You would benefit going early and getting fast passes for the popular rides- the roller coaster, and Radiator Springs! Maybe do CA Ad in the morning and get the big things taken care of, do your pool time, then return for dinner?   -Your youngest will hopefully like Tomorrowland! They have a large store he can shop through that has Avengers/Star Wars stuff in it! He can build his own Light Saber, buy memorabilia, etc! :)  -It was a tad breezy when I went two weeks ago, I wore shorts and a tank top, but wore a jacket in the morning. It tends to get HOT in the sun, so I would dress in lightweight clothes! It warmed up by the mid afternoon, but I was never miserable. It's been nice :)   -If your kids likes Cars, watch them light the street at sunset, it's super cute. They play the song that's played in the movie! Other little things? Let me think... I've had an annual pass for years and always try to find new things to see! They can find the hidden Mickeys, try to find the Club 33 enterance, look for Maleficent in the castle window!   You have PLENTY of time to help plan this out, and I'm sure you'll get a ton of advice along the way :)"
Disneyland,3538mk,cherie_amour,6,Wed May 6 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"So many, but the one that makes me smile the most: A friend and I had gone ahead of our other two friends (who were fighting), and we decided to go do Princess Fantasy Faire. We wait patiently for our turn, and finally go in. I had wanted to meet Aurora for the longest time (I kept missing her). So as I was telling my friend I was hoping to meet her, we turn and come face to face with her. After I calmed down a lot, Aurora and I talked for the longest time and it was amazing! Later on, my friend had told me he was worried that I was going to pass out from excitement.   TL;DR Met Aurora, and day was made  21 years old and my life was complete, to be honest"

I then stepped out of the way so they could continue their little skit but instead Hook turns around and starts chasing after me.

My absolute favorite moment was when my friend, who is 6'5, and I went to visit. Tigger is pretty tall, probably one of the tallest characters in the park, and when it was our turn, Tigger did the classic slow look up from my friends feet to his face. He totally acted all intimidated. When it was picture time, Tigger made my friend sit down so that Tigger could be taller in the picture.  Edit: I just texted my friend to see if he still has the picture, waiting on his response.  Eeyore. Holy crap. Totally adorable. We asked him how he was feeling and he just shrugged and shuffled his feet a bit. We told him that we were there to cheer him up so we picked a few flowers and we spent a while throwing them up in the air and playing with the leaves around us. My friend was friends with Pooh that day and she told me that Eeyore absolutely adored us."

Although, tbh, Meet & Greets get me kind of trapped in a ""I want to interact, but I know this isn't real and makes me feel socially awkward because you're real people and I feel uncomfortable being chummy with people I don't know.

Rapunzel is a family favorite because my niece is obsessed with Tangled (and none of us are weary of it like that other movie she can't let go.)  We did a princess lunch last trip and my aunt started crying when Rapunzel came out. She'll never live that down.  Rapunzel was thrown off a bit, but jumped right into character joking with her to get her to laugh.  Any time I see Mickey and the Magical Map I film Rapunzel's song and send it to her. Bonus that the distraction of recording keeps me from crying, that song always gets me.   And I always enjoy seeing Chip and Dale running around. They just seem like they're having so much fun."

Even though Mickey's Not So Scary was going on, so the main park closed at 7, it was still amazingly wonderful.  One recommendation though, and I speak from experience... do not.. DO NOT, no matter what you do, put a banana in your backpack. I spent a little chunk of time in New Orleans Square cleaning out the mess in the bottom of my backpack.  Highly not recommended.  At least I was waiting on a fastpass for Haunted Mansion, and I got to hear the jazz band play, so that was nice.  ;)"

Disneyland,34y3yw,Vidogo,9,Tue May 5 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"We did the fantasmic dining package on Sunday and it was absolutely worth it. Not only was the food at Blue Bayou amazing, we had front and center reserved seating for fantasmic. While all the regular Fastpass areas were packed to the brim, our area was sparsely populated and we could stretch out as much as we wanted. 10/10 would recommend."
Disneyland,34y3yw,champion_dave,2,Tue May 5 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the one I'm definitely planning on making. Want to eat at the Blue Bayou anyways, and while it would cost more than just a normal reservation there (since you have to get appetizer and dessert too), I think it'll definitely be worth it. Especially since Fantasmic will probably only be running one night during our trip."
Disneyland,34y3yw,leeshybobeeshy,1 point,Tue May 5 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"It'll also save you time- seeing WOC or fantastic otherwise would mean waiting before the show! Sometimes a full hour is needed to get a good spot, and that'll be the case for you guys since it'll be the only night playing!"
Disneyland,34y3yw,geekpoints,1 point,Tue May 5 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"I was gonna ask that too but forgot - if you go for the dining package, can you just show up right before showtime then? No need to show up much earlier than 5-10 minutes?  I got the dining package for Fantasmic at Hollywood Studios and it ended up being really nice, since the section right right there in the middle. By the time I showed up 20 minutes before the show, they were seating people in the far left sections."

Disneyland,34y3yw,Veearrsix,5,Tue May 5 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"Far as I can tell (spoke to someone on the reservation line) the Blue Bayou includes seated viewing. River Belle Terrace is a reserved standing spot, while the Aladdin's Oasis on-the-go thing is just like a regular fastpass.  Sort of the same over with World of Color - Carthay Circle is reserved seating, while (iirc) Wine Country Trattoria and Ariel's Grotto are both standing."
Disneyland,34y3yw,stevensokulski,2,Tue May 5 18:23:56 2015 UTC,Carthay Circle gives reserved seating for World of Color?  Did they tell you if it was a new thing or not?

Disneyland,351gos,imOnWelfare,10,Wed May 6 09:08:02 2015 UTC,"Considering the time frame that the word was used and more common may be an explanation but that would be my opinion. Plus it fits in with the Main Street side of things as for example, the Dapper Dan's have for their outfits."
Disneyland,351gos,heliattackpe,7,Wed May 6 11:14:35 2015 UTC,High designer is just silly cause it will get destroyed. But certainly one could be slick and 'dapper' with other looks. The real point is to not be in tee shirts etc.
Disneyland,351gos,Techsupportvictim,4,Wed May 6 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"It does kind of suck that everyone dresses from the 40's and 50's. I totally agree that it would be cool to see dressed in some high fashion. But here is my take:  The creater of Dapper Day himself said that there is no specific time period that people should dress from. But he did get inspiration from looking at old concept drawings of disneyland and saw that all the people in the concepts were dressed ""dapper"" (which was the 40's 50's). So he got his inspiration from dressing like people from old concept drawings.  And yes, as much as I want to wear high fashion to disneyland I wouldn't want to scuff any of it up. So I would also rather resort to finding something cheap and old in case I get it ruined."
Disneyland,351gos,jmccormack,3,Wed May 6 16:22:40 2015 UTC,"It was always explained to me that the point of Dapper Day was to dress like guests did when the park opened (1955), and it was loosened to include other eras because not everyone wants to put that much effort into their outfit. I'm someone who kind of just dresses up no matter what (I was there a few days before Dapper Day and a cast member said, ""you know Dapper Day is sunday, right?"" even though I was just wearing a modern dress and nice makeup), but I think people dressing from the 40s is mostly because people either don't understand the distinction between the decades or don't care. I also saw some flappers--if people just ""dressed up"" people wouldn't really recognise them as being part of ""Dapper Day"", because some people are there dressed nicely every day. You're definitely welcome to, of course!"
Disneyland,351gos,bubblesugarsocks,3,Wed May 6 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"Modern clothing is expensive, even if I'm not paying for a $900 designer label I still don't want to pay $60 for a dress that I could potentially ruin. I bought my vintage inspired dress for $15, it's adorable and will work well with a vintage theme without looking costumey, because it's modern made.   I agree some attendees do look like they're going to a costumed event but it's all really fun. I've seen clothing from across all eras, I don't see a lot of 40's, but 50's-early 60's seems to be popular.   Why don't you start your own day? Have couture day and have people who can afford the fancy designer high fashion looks all come together and do fancy high fashion people stuff. The vintage theme will always prevail for Dapper Day."

Then ride it like 8 times while everybody else is watching Fantasmic and enjoy the show from the ride in the spurts where you are outside. Now instead of standing around for hours you got to ride an awesome ride a bunch of times wthout waiting and get a cool view. The drop is awesome."

Disneyland,34ypz3,iheartmetal13,-5,Tue May 5 18:14:30 2015 UTC,What a sad day...
Disneyland,34ypz3,mini_moose_27,2,Tue May 5 18:25:21 2015 UTC,You can't do that anymore with the new FastPass system.
Disneyland,34ypz3,iheartmetal13,2,Tue May 5 18:15:49 2015 UTC,I guess I'm not going to disneyland enough!
Disneyland,34ypz3,incride,-4,Tue May 5 18:25:34 2015 UTC,I personally suggest getting a picnic blanket that zips up so you dont have to sit on the cement. it can get pretty hot.  http://www.target.com/p/picnic-time-vista-blanket-tote-multicolor/-/A-15957952#prodSlot=medium_1_1&term=picnic+blancket

Disneyland,34war5,Corwin90,1 point,Tue May 5 09:28:03 2015 UTC,Do they have any with Donald Duck on it?
Disneyland,34war5,golf4miami,2,Wed May 6 02:03:44 2015 UTC,....They have exactly what I posted. They usually only have one for the fourth and one for the fifth.
Disneyland,34war5,epotosi,2,Wed May 6 05:07:14 2015 UTC,I tried calling to order some May the 4th stuff over the phone and they wouldn't let me. This is what sucks about living in Ohio. :(
