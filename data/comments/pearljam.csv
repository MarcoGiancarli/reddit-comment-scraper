Then Cobains found dead at the same exact time period, Lyrics on the album have now been changed to reflect Kurt such as.. ""scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor..."" The little bit of info that was released around that time was that they found a cigar box next to cobains body that held his drivers license and heroin works.

He was at a Cubs Fantasy Camp, and they all got really drunk and ended up in a Karaoke bar. It starts with Eddie sitting there, listening to the intro to ""Streets have no name"" whilst some is yelling, ""I'm going Hungry"" in the background.  He then sings it, not well considering his state. But it sounds good.    Imagine being a huge Cubs and Pearl Jam fan.  You save your vacation and money for a Cubs fantasy camp, and get to play against your former heroes.  And one of the campers is your favorite musician.  Then, he drinks with you and then sings Karaoke.    That my friends would be a nocturnal emission from me."

If anyone has a chance to listen to it def check it out. The Red Rock shows from 95 are pretty great too.   I remember this was during the height of the Ticketmaster battle and I was worried they'd never tour again.

Something he hadn't imagined being. As the moving traffic passed, he found himself staring down, at his own hand. Not remembering the change, not recalling the plan. Was it...?"" It is a saddening tale of how a mans life has become a boring cycle and he can't recall how he reached this point in his life.  Immortality as well, ""Scrawled his all, cigar box on the floor"".

To me vitalogy was their way of purposefully refusing to cater to the 'grunge' crowd and making music they (meaning Eddie at the time) wanted to instead.  I mean, imagine being a casual PJ fan who loved Jeremy, Alive, black and daughter and buying Vitalogy and listening to it as you go to bed. Then waking up during stupid mop. That's enough for you to reevaluate how much you like this band lol."
pearljam,390uer,spinblackcircles,4,Mon Jun 8 18:53:04 2015 UTC,"I can't comment about REM, but WRT PJ they didn't so much whittle away their fanbase as separate the the chaff.

pearljam,390uer,Musikwala,2,Mon Jun 8 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"These bands didn't purposely sabotage their fan base or careers. As noted before they put out music that they enjoyed. No code is a great fucking album. They weeded out the bullshit ""fans"" and scenesters with this alternative alternative. It was to secure their relevance and the longevity of their sound. I for one applaud pj's progression, their natural ebb and flo. Haven't met a pj album I didn't like. Genuine music. No fluff."
pearljam,390uer,FeelFree2FeelFree,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:28:33 2015 UTC,I would guess that the writer doesn't really know the subject they are writing about. I doubt Pearl Jam would have had such a long successful career if they had tried to creatively stagnate. Instead they've hovered just below the popular radar like riding the edge of overwhelming success without going over. No code certainly stands the test of time and for me became much better with age- I think it's one the top 3 overall albums.

Kind of why I like PJ so much to begin with.  Can't wait until Let The Records Play comes on six years from now, I'm gonna love that shit.

pearljam,390j9n,nullmiah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:15:33 2015 UTC,Riot Act and Vs are my favorite albums. I didn't like Backspacer at all and the self-titled album wasn't good for me either. I have enjoyed Lightning Bolt more than their last 2.
pearljam,390j9n,yello_leadbelly,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:10:08 2015 UTC,Personally I love Riot Act. Cropduster is one of my favorite songs. Lighting Bolt has never clicked with me. I can't put my finger on why....which is kind of aggravating.

pearljam,38glpq,muthman74,14,Thu Jun 4 01:57:08 2015 UTC,I prefer Alice in Chains' over Nirvana's Unplugged. You can definitely hear how weak Kurt's voice was at the time from how he sang. But Pearl Jams is the best Unplugged imo.
pearljam,38glpq,megamando,2,Thu Jun 4 02:20:15 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I've always thought they had the best unplugged.  They picked the right songs and had great arrangements. That is my favorite version of ""Nutshell"". It was their first show in 2 1/2 years and one of the last with Layne."
pearljam,38glpq,UnicodeEmoticon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:53:54 2015 UTC,Obviously Layne was not in great condition but the set list and overall strength of performance by the band just felt better. Kurt trashed his voice so early by singing with poor technique which really is a shame.
pearljam,38glpq,megamando,4,Thu Jun 4 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"This was also my favourite version of 'Black', until i randomly stumbled upon the Marseille '06 version. It's heartbreaking."

I'd been on that tour from Lisbon to Glasgow, on the most amazing adventure of my life, making life-long friends along the way, and I still remember the shock and fear that some of them might have been injured only a few days later. (Some were, but not seriously.)  It's only on the rare occasion that they actually refer to what happened that day that you realise how much it affected and still affects them."
pearljam,38glpq,butterypowered,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"Marseille '06   Found here, image quality is super crap but the sound is from official bootleg and indeed it is a awesome version of Black thanks for the suggestion!  As for PJ on mtv unplugged i always tend to watch/listen to it every couple of months at least and i always find myself rocking out to it, it is seriously that good still after 23 years"
pearljam,38glpq,Haximaxi,5,Thu Jun 4 14:38:30 2015 UTC,Porch is my favorite song and this performance  of it will never be topped.  I love it!
pearljam,38glpq,Kazzie54,2,Thu Jun 4 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Pearl Jam, I think Nirvana's Unplugged is the best one."
pearljam,38glpq,Capthowdy1027,7,Thu Jun 4 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"The reason I also put unplugged Nirvana at #1 over Pearl Jam  is because Nirvana sounds like a completely different band unplugged. Grohl dramatically changed his drumming and the Kurt's singing is very different. Whereas pearl Jam sounded exactly like pearl Jam with all the energy of a plugged in performance. Nirvana really embraced what it meant to go unplugged, pearl Jam just rocked the house down using acoustic instruments. The latter is certainly an accomplishment, but artistically I think Nirvana's is more of an achievement. But it is choosing between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, they are both awesome and different in their own way and it just comes down to personal preference."
pearljam,38glpq,saratogacv60,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"Very well said, that's exactly how I see it."
pearljam,38glpq,Capthowdy1027,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:53:02 2015 UTC,This is exactly why the Pearl Jam unplugged really isn't nearly as popular as either Nirvana or Alice n' Chains. They didn't do anything different to make the unplugged experience different. They learned though and their Bridge School shows have always been spectacular.
pearljam,38glpq,if0rg0t2remember,0,Thu Jun 4 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"I love Pearl Jam, but Alice in Chains and Nirvana's performances were more important. If Pearl Jam had 4 years of material it may have been just as good, but, Pearl jam's performance was just not as emotionally affectionate as Nivana and AIC's show's were."
pearljam,38esnr,timewilltell44,5,Wed Jun 3 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I created this simply because no other tab online was as accurate as I wanted it to be. I studied multiple videos of Stone playing through multiple eras and I tabbed it out mostly by ear, so theoretically this should be the most accurate version that exists. I would love to hear any feedback or criticism from you guys though!"
pearljam,38esnr,megamando,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:32:33 2015 UTC,It looks very accurate. I'll have to play it when I get home. I'm very excited as I've always tried to find the right way to play but never could. If only giventowail.com still was active this would be perfect to add to it.
pearljam,38esnr,megamando,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:53:44 2015 UTC,I know! I'll probably be posting this in the general PJ forum soon as well. Stone is such a talented guitarist but my God his riffs are weird.
pearljam,38esnr,megamando,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:26:02 2015 UTC,"His playing style is very weird overall. Watching him play is very interesting. He doesn't play like your typical guitarist, there's a lot of groove but also it feels stiff and controlled."
pearljam,38esnr,bradyarmobile,2,Wed Jun 3 23:31:43 2015 UTC,"It's enthralling, but very difficult to capture in an online music software. One of these days I'll get around to making an actual video showing how to play it or at least a cover. Same with most of Ten."
pearljam,38esnr,LazyGamerMike,2,Wed Jun 3 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"One song I've always had trouble with is Alone, his style fits the riff so perfectly and it's impossible to copy or replicate at all."

pearljam,381bjv,Jencaasi,2,Mon Jun 1 03:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say the best bar band PJ covers are usually going to be the well known, sing-a-long songs. I'd say you'd do well with Daughter, Alive, the PJ version of Last Kiss, maybe Do The Evolution or Small Town, and the like.  Also, throwing in a few of the newer softie songs like Just Breathe, Sirens, and The End might go over well with the drunk slow dancing crowd."
pearljam,381bjv,Jencaasi,2,Mon Jun 1 12:12:53 2015 UTC,Sweet! Appreciate the suggestions.
pearljam,381bjv,Nippleboy22,2,Mon Jun 1 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, no worries! Whenever I go see bar bands and party bands, I wish they were playing Pearl Jam covers. So, I'm happy to lend some suggestions."
pearljam,381bjv,Incessant_Mace,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:34:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Stick to more of their popular work. Better man, Daughter, Yellow Ledbetter, Alive, Elderly Woman, Last Kiss, Animal, The Fixer would all be great songs to cover at a bar."
pearljam,381bjv,his_dude_ness14,3,Mon Jun 1 20:19:43 2015 UTC,Breath and Scream would be a good song.

Then, they released the audio from that performance as a Christmas single, like 18 years later. It's such a weird little tale."
pearljam,37nn2l,Jencaasi,1 point,Fri May 29 14:18:14 2015 UTC,I wish they expanded on it. It could've been on the next album!

pearljam,37j2td,Haximaxi,2,Thu May 28 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"Probably my favorite version of this song, and definitely my favorite PJ live show of all time.  To me 2003 was their peak, all things considered. Riot act isn't a perfect album but it is good and live they were just killing it every night. At that point they had maybe 3 songs I didn't thoroughly enjoy, all from riot act."

pearljam,37j2td,megamando,1 point,Thu May 28 23:30:18 2015 UTC,I personally think You Are is one of the top 3 on Riot Act. But I definitely agree with Ghost and Get Right. Not really the best songs they've produced.

pearljam,379m31,MrClutch7,3,Tue May 26 00:42:33 2015 UTC,I feel like the two voices kind of ruins the song tbh. I prefer the live versions. The song as a whole sounds like it could have been on Vitalogy tho.
pearljam,379m31,Jencaasi,2,Tue May 26 03:09:57 2015 UTC,"I was listening to Binaural this last week a lot and I have to say, I agree with you completely.

Nine Inch Nails fans, gathered as This One is On Us have produced and shared (for free) several video releases, including the following two which are truly remarkable:  Another Version of The Truth  On 5th May, 2008, Nine Inch Nails released The Slip for free via their website, as a gift to their fans. Or as Trent Reznor put it: ""This one’s on me"".  Later fans recorded the last show of the Lights In The Sky tour and over 400Gb of video from 3 shows from the same tour were unofficially released by the band.  The fan community created ""Another Version of the Truth"" – a 3 disc release bringing together numerous editors, designers, and web programmers to create a professional digital film, followed by a physical release created by fans for fans.  The Downward Spiral Live, in collaboration with The NIN Hotline  With over 10 High-Definition video sources, this release has been compared positively to professional outputs. Capturing the raw feel of a live Nine Inch Nails performance, this share-alike DVD presents impressive video and audio quality, to the extent that the band themselves took note."
pearljam,36mlg1,tgarron,2,Thu May 21 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"Occasionally, you can judge a band by the value of the fans. I love when super-fans get so dedicated. It makes for great unofficial content everyone."
pearljam,36mlg1,Jencaasi,2,Fri May 22 13:36:27 2015 UTC,"Long time coming... I can't believe it's done and can't wait to have it in my hands, Soundgarden Knights are obstinate fans, aren't we? But never in my wildest Soundgarden dreams I could have imagined such a great, professional and passionate work as this book. A well deserved homage and a huge thank you to the band, that's how I see it. Long live Soundgarden and our brother band, Pearl Jam! - Martha"

pearljam,36kr6y,deadaselvis,5,Wed May 20 15:19:13 2015 UTC,Eddie had a hard time in the mid 90''s dealing with the exposure  of himself and the band. That is why the videos stopped being made. He started touring in a small camper van instead of flying or traveling with the band.
pearljam,36kr6y,bigangry,4,Wed May 20 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"I think a phone call from The Who gave PJ the strength and determination to stay together and keep playing music after the Roskilde deaths, too."
pearljam,36kr6y,abillslife,1 point,Wed May 20 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"With the exception of Rosklide, I think the closest they came was around the making of Vitalogy. Eddie was having trouble dealing with the pressures of fame. Eddie and Jeff were basically not speaking to Dave Abruzzese. Stone was upset because Eddie had started taking a bigger role in the songwriting, which kind of pushed Stone's contributions to the side. Mike's drug problems came to a head and he eventually entered rehab.    Pretty dour time for the band. Still my favorite album of their's though."

I was at the KC show in June 2003 when it poored rain for the first half of the show. EV sang ""oh dear dad, can you see me now"" right as a huge flash of lightning flashed across the sky. Chills.  No Code. Off He Goes. Man. I love that song.   Black. Another great one.  Anytime they play a live version of Betterman and tag it with ""it's okay"" it just kills me.

pearljam,35lf8w,spinblackcircles,5,Mon May 11 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"The entirety of sleight of hand is probably my favorite song lyrically of all time. But this especially:  ""He found himself staring down/at his own hands  Not remembering the change/not recalling the plan Was it......?""  I pray if you've never had this feeling in your life that you never do. It so sadly illustrates how it feels to be someone and somewhere that means nothing to you, drifting through your life without purpose. Not knowing when you became this person that you wish you weren't, and not knowing when the hell that happened and how big you used to dream as a kid about who you'd be.....well it's a really shitty feeling.  ""Any new realizations would have to wait  till he had more time. More time....""  It's so powerful because the song is about realIzing one day you are someone you never thought you would be and not in a good way. And feeling completely lost. The way Eddie says 'more time...' and the way the music blasts at that moment is like saying 'well, how much more time do you really have? This is it man.' It kills me."

Rhythm and time signatures is a little more complicated to some and as someone pointed out in the discussion page, Matt's more technical of a drummer (with regards to time signatures/rhythm) than people give him credit."

pearljam,34yoak,placebo_button,3,Tue May 5 20:38:29 2015 UTC,Pearl Jam is pretty straight forward 4/4 rock for the most part. The first song that comes to mind though with some cool timing is Sleight of Hand which has some 5/4 in it.

Satan's Bed chorus, The Fixer beginning bit, uh, I know there's a lot more I'm missing.  Johnny Guitar has a 7/8 verse (I think).  Cropduster does crazy stuff.  Life Wasted has some 5/4 bars in it.  Push Me, Pull Me is 3/4 + 3/4 + 3/4 + 4/4 in the verse.  I think All Those Yesterdays has some weird time signature stuff in it.    I know I could keep finding more, but really, odd time stuff is all over the place on their records, even if it's just for a measure.  It's one of my favorite things about the band.

I've heard a similar review from people in many different types of seats at different levels, etc. from that night.  Of course, it didn't help that I was at the exact last row of the highest level, right in the center.   My favorite song is Long Road, and i haven't seen it once even in almost 30 shows. But I'm glad my first time wasn't there.  Edit: dc 08 was the one I was thinking of. DC 06 was... fine, I guess. DC is not their town, that much is for sure."

I definitely know what you mean, regarding the song's outro. I guess ""It's OK"" is very much a product of it's time. 2000, post-Roskilde, the fans and the band were desperate for an uplifting kind of call and answer bit."

pearljam,34eb4t,Haximaxi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"I've always liked it as an evolution of the songs meaning. There's the theme of abuse, which runs throughout the song, then the it's ok tag which came much later, but is like an extra chapter, years later in the character's life... that says, hey, shit happened, but it doesn't have to define you forever. It's ok. Be whoever you want to be. Which is, in my opinion, something that encapsulates pearl jam as a whole.  It's similar to the storytellers episode where ed describes alive as evolving from a curse to the fans reacting to the line ""I'm still alive"" at shows, and dancing and celebrating, and how it ""lifted the curse""."

pearljam,34dbk6,gamedemon24,3,Thu Apr 30 10:34:19 2015 UTC,"Some more activity and discussion would be nice yeah, i joined this sub when it had around 800 members and maybe 1 post a week/month and it has grown steady over the last few years to almost 4000 members today and a lot of new posts every day, i am not saying all of the posts are quality posts but activity wise it has improved a lot.  If you look back in the history you see some discussion posts made by /u/Jencaasi and they were stickied but i have not seen any of such posts in the last few months, perhaps its time to resurrect them?  Having said that at this point in time there is not much ""news"" we don't already know about PJ other then a new tour or new album or side projects by one of the members, but let me steal this quote from the guys over at gremmie.net    The other side of the equation is that Pearl Jam has been less prolific and more in control of their wares. Where once they released a b-side with each single (thank you Leatherman) and performed a laundry list of covers live, now they retain b-sides for albums like Lost Dogs or “the next record” (half of Lightning Bolt) and statistically have narrowed the scope of their live covers. A change like this was inevitable. As the band ages, everything slows down. Frankly, I’m elated they’re still producing worthwhile music. Most bands from the 90′s era have either disbanded (e.g. Soundgarden) or are still making music albeit at an empirically diminished quality (e.g. Soundgarden). However, music notwithstanding, the average age in the band is 49, and though it’s clear they’ll continue writing and performing in the short term, it would be silly to assume they’ll keep pace with previous decades. Mind the signs: extended time between records, shorter touring schedules, more side projects, etc.    Of course this does not mean we cant have an open discussion about anything Pearl Jam but in all fairness there is just less to talk about then lets say a few years ago"
pearljam,34dbk6,Haximaxi,3,Thu Apr 30 13:00:13 2015 UTC,"There's certainly enough Pearl Jam content that's been released officially and unofficially over the last several decades that we can keep posting and re-posting interesting bits of information for fans and new fans. But, of course /u/Haximaxi is right about the band's modern activity. They just don't do as much as they used to.  Near as I can tell, reddit interaction begets more reddit interaction. So, interesting posts, upvotes, positive comments, and interesting discussion will lead to more traffic.  This is a short term solution, but it's something I found fascinating over at /r/radiohead. They put together a subreddit album! Everyone participating in the sub got together over the course of several posts and voted on the sub's ""favorite"" Radiohead songs, then voted on a tracklist, artwork, album title, and the like. Then, they had someone mix it up. The album is very good."
pearljam,34dbk6,Jencaasi,3,Thu Apr 30 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"A subreddit album sounds like a great idea, tho /r/radiohead has a bit more subs then us with nearly 4k people i am sure we can make something good and hopefully get a fair few involved, i am all up for it!"

They announced that 25.000 tickets were sold already a month ago, and the stadium is for 50.000 people (for concerts).  In other cases, people just don't buy the tickets because they believe they are too expensive (production's fault) and just wait for them to be cheaper (sometimes happens when the show is near).

pearljam,33jjt6,megamando,11,Thu Apr 23 00:59:58 2015 UTC,I still listen to this album all the way through a lot.  Father's Son is the only weak point in my opinion.
pearljam,33jjt6,GSKashmir,8,Thu Apr 23 02:21:24 2015 UTC,I love Father's Son.
pearljam,33jjt6,soup_or_crackers,6,Thu Apr 23 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"I don't play it as much these days; though I think that is to be expected.   I still like it quite a bit.  It easily blows away Backspacer to me.  I didn't think Backspacer was a very good album.    Getaway is my favorite opener since Go.  I love that song.  Then it goes right into Mind Your Manners which is probably my favorite track on the album.  A true contender for best 1-2 punch right out of the gate for me.  Then comes the song that I probably skip more than I listen to.  If Let the Record Play was track 4 I would probably feel like Eddie was guilting me into not skipping Father's Son.  Sirens is great.  Lightning Bolt is good but something feels cheesy to me about chorus.  Infallible is a great song.  The album takes a slight dip for me from that point on.  Let the Record Play sounds so much like a Stone Temple Pilots song to me.  I kike STP, but the song doesn't feel PJ.  I really like Sleeping by Myself.  Yellow Moon is ok, but I am likely to be looking for my next album to que up at that point so I don't fall asleep to Future Days."
pearljam,33jjt6,Utenlok,7,Thu Apr 23 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"Strange, I feel backspacer is much better than this album.  Top Five 1. No Code 2. Vitalogy 3. Binaural 4. Vs. 5. Ten"

pearljam,33jjt6,TerdVader,3,Thu Apr 23 20:00:59 2015 UTC,My Father's Son is probably my most played song of the last two years. Lightning Bolt still ranks at number 6 but I fucking love it.   EDIT: Tracked down this older comment from another thread that sums up my feelings on LB.
pearljam,33jjt6,BoyWithHorns,3,Thu Apr 23 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"I still enjoy it. Personally hated Backspacer and thought this was much better. Its not my favorite PJ album by any means, but it has some songs that I am really enjoying still.   Though I will say that Future Days might be my least favorite Pearl Jam song of all time..."
pearljam,33jjt6,StewartDuck,3,Thu Apr 23 06:20:21 2015 UTC,"I think its much better then Backspacer, I love the LB album, I dont think theres a song that I dislike on it, and the songs are great live.  LB, Pendulum, Sleeping By Myself and Swallowed Whole are highlights for me."
pearljam,33jjt6,DrPuffinStuff,3,Thu Apr 23 10:57:40 2015 UTC,I still can't get into Lightning Bolt at all. There's nothing for me to relate to and the songs just seem so bland and uninspired. The last time I put it on I ended up skipping most of the songs like 30 seconds in.
pearljam,33jjt6,sumatran_tiger,3,Fri Apr 24 06:30:07 2015 UTC,"Infallible and Pendulum may be my favorite back to back tracks in their collection.  Love Getaway, MYM, Father's Son.  Let the Records Play is a little too on the nose for me.  I completely agree with you on Sleeping by Myself, and I don't care for Yellow Moon really.  And I think the title track is pretty awful.  I may give a slight edge to Backspacer, but it's close."
pearljam,33jjt6,soup_or_crackers,2,Thu Apr 23 02:40:30 2015 UTC,Sleeping by Myself is the only real weak point and the album would be better if it was shorter. I still rank it in the 2nd tier of albums.

pearljam,33jjt6,vbar44,8,Thu Apr 23 01:59:12 2015 UTC,Besides Father's Son I don't think any of the songs have that replay-ability that's so characteristic in other albums.  For this reason I think Backspacer is better too.  Unthought Known alone is better than any song on Lightning Bolt.
pearljam,33jjt6,dukefett,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:06:55 2015 UTC,"Getaway and Father's Son are my favorite songs on it, but I enjoy the whole album, if I skip any track it'd probly be Sirens."

I think it's only slightly better than Backspacer however. I actually rate both Albums quite high."
pearljam,33jjt6,Jencaasi,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:45:19 2015 UTC,"""Infallible"", ""Swallowed Whole"", ""Getaway"", ""Yellow Moon"", ""Mind Your Manners"", and especially ""Pendulum"" are high points, imo. Like Backspacer, it gets way too sappy in a couple places, for my tastes (re: ""Sleeping By Myself"", ""Future Days"", ""Sirens""). I agree that ""Sleeping By Myself"" didn't work. If they were going to dig into stuff they'd done in the past, I feel like they could have found something way better. The album could have used something like ""Of The Earth"" in there. Overall, it's uneven, but a pretty good record. I really like the artwork."
pearljam,33jjt6,sladederinger,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"The thing that bugged me about Sleeping By Myself was that aside from the uke, it hardly changed. If you are going to redo something, make it totally different. It's basically the same thing. Do it over but make it really fast/punky sounding or something. Like Lukin's intensity. That would have been neat-o :)"
pearljam,33jjt6,sladederinger,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:54:30 2015 UTC,I like the idea of adding something to it but I don't know if it would work as a fast punk type of song but I would definitely like to hear it that way.
pearljam,33jjt6,diandrarose,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"The fast/punk idea was more or less just an example, first thing that came to mind. I just thought if you're going to use already recorded tracks, make it interesting."

pearljam,33jjt6,gamedemon24,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"I think I have a different perspective on this album than some as a newer fan of the band (been 5/6 years). I didn't grow up alongside the band, I heard the whole discography is over a few months (albeit in order). As for Lightning Bolt, I enjoy it. As others have stated, I too don't listen to it often, but I enjoy MYM, Lightning Bolt, Yellow Moon to name a few off hand. It also helps that I saw the band shortly before the album (London Ontario, Premiere MYM live), so that and it being the first Pearl Jam album I was a conscious fan of to go out and buy it also helped.   Edit: Other than Future Days and Yellow Moon, I'll add, that I agree the first ""half"" up to Pendulum are the better songs of the album in my opinion."
pearljam,33jjt6,GravitationalConstnt,2,Thu Apr 30 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"Same with me. Became a true fan after PJ20, 2010, and never really grew along with the band but came in at a time where they are different from 1992 or 1993."

I'm an audio engineer, and I'd say it's the best record they've ever done from a production perspective, by a far enough margin that I often prefer it to records that arguably have much better songs. Song-wise, I still think it's great. Maybe a touch above Backspacer, but it's close. My favorites are My Father's Son, Getaway, and Lightning Bolt."
pearljam,33jjt6,designerdy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:12:14 2015 UTC,Never heard an audio engineer perspective. Can you go into some more detail about why its the best record?
pearljam,33jjt6,Mackncheeze,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"It's just really well done. It's got the kind of production values you see in much more commercial music, but the songs are still Pearl Jam. Everything is super tight and clear, and you can always clearly hear ever part, which is something I thought Backspacer was lacking in. The only one that might be better is Ten as it was re-released, with the Brendan O'Brian mixes."

pearljam,32kl7s,DanConnersGarage,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:24:05 2015 UTC,He was caught in some online child porn paysite. But Towsend being famous gave the excuse it was only for research that he was paying for. So I find it a bit off putting that he is running a charity  for teens now. I understood that this was his charity so that is how child porn is connected  to this charity.
pearljam,32kl7s,deadaselvis,2,Wed Apr 15 07:26:54 2015 UTC,Not an apologist but... He was cleared of charges because he was able to prove that he had never been on the site before and because he had no porn on his computer- he went through the same process and investigation as anyone else and had his name bandied about because he was famous.  His research allegedly was to show how easy the access is. I don't think being famous helped him get out of the charges.

VS - Rearviewmirror Vitalogy - Nothingman (with Better Man as a strong runner up, after a nasty break up last year which led to a lot of self reflection) No Code - Now and always, Present Tense Yield - I'm going with ""Do The Evolution"", just because I like the video and the way the song morphs into something entirely different live. Binaural - Insignificance or Light Years. That might be a tie. Riot Act - I Am Mine has really grown on me a lot over the years. I wish they still played it live. Avocado - Come Back Binaural - Got Some Lightning Bolt - Pendulum, strong contender for one of my favorite Pearl Jam songs of the last 10-15 years."

pearljam,319mny,fn3putt,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Crazy Mary is a perfect song for Boom. I like it very much, too."
pearljam,319mny,Jencaasi,6,Sat Apr 4 09:47:57 2015 UTC,"BOOOOOOOOOOM  Ok, now that that's out of the way, I've never really personally assessed what I think of Boom's contributions to the group, beyond the obvious keyboard heavy songs. I would say I actually thought his bit in RITFW was pretty groovy, though."
pearljam,319mny,redwinedrunk,2,Fri Apr 3 03:11:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't like his playing in Future Days.  Actually, I don't really like that song much on the album in general."
pearljam,319mny,sprgrss,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:42:17 2015 UTC,Same for me. I've been thinking the last three songs of Lightning Bolt would be better off on an EV solo album.
pearljam,317hy0,BOUQ,15,Thu Apr 2 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"I've listened to it all the way through twice... and the second time was on accident.  my take is that it was a big 'fuck you' to the record industry while simultaneously being personally meaningful to the band.    I'm sure it serves an artistic purpose to the story arc of the album, but it isn't listenable to me.  It is the only song of theirs that I feel this way."
pearljam,317hy0,bisepost,6,Thu Apr 2 16:48:30 2015 UTC,it's so creepy.
pearljam,317hy0,MrBinns,13,Fri Apr 3 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"I am 29 years old and I've been listening to Vitalogy, semi-regularly, for at least 17 years. And, this song still creeps me out when it comes on."
pearljam,317hy0,Jencaasi,2,Thu Apr 2 16:54:54 2015 UTC,YEEEEESSSSSSSSS. This exactly.
pearljam,317hy0,GuitarAntiStar,9,Fri Apr 3 01:58:04 2015 UTC,"Vitalogy is my favorite album.  The ""songs"" on there are sooooo good.  But for every 2.5 good songs, there's a WTF filler.    ""Pry, to"" - ok, whatever.  It's short enough.    ""Bugs"" - hmmm, that's interesting... weird accordion, Ed getting taken over by insects...   ""Aye Davanita""  - ah woo a ooo a ugghhhhhhhhhh.    Then finally ""heyfoxymophandlemamathatsme"" - Instant skip.  I made a playlist for my iPod of all the PJ albums, and various singles, to be played in order (starting at ""Once"") and this is the only song I couldn't justify putting on it.  I tried reasoning that I could always skip it, but then decided that the one time I could not skip it would be the time a group of people notice my music and forever judge me to be a horrible person.    If Vitalogy could remove those 4 songs and replace them with any 4 from No Code, it would hands down be one of the greatest albums of all time.    EDIT: Changed the ratio to represent all 14 tracks."
pearljam,317hy0,soup_or_crackers,8,Thu Apr 2 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, Bugs is one of my absolute favourite PJ songs :p"
pearljam,317hy0,LeftHandedGuitarist,3,Thu Apr 2 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"Haha.  I actually don't mind it or Pry, To - weird fun little jams.  But they are still filler."

pearljam,317hy0,megamando,2,Fri Apr 3 04:05:35 2015 UTC,"This is what I don't get when I see so many people list Vitalogy as their favorite album by the band. I love the actual songs on the album, but they clearly had a little too much fun fucking with everyone with these tracks. If you take out the four, then you have a really short, 8 song album. It'd be a really good album, and still one of the best, but I find it hard to believe that it's truly someone's most enjoyable album from the band."
pearljam,317hy0,magical_poop,3,Thu Apr 2 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"If you take the 4 out, you have 10 left.  10 really awesome songs - which is just short of their first album.  The only two I really don't like are A.D. and foxymop.  So that's 10 amazing songs, 2 meh throwaways, 1 annoying A.D., and 1 audible vomit handlemama."
pearljam,317hy0,soup_or_crackers,5,Thu Apr 2 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"whoops i tried to do a math too fast.  yeah, it would be an amazing album. but the fact of the matter is it has these 4 goofy tracks just thrown on for whatever reason, that i'm sure nobody seeks out and is like ""yeah man, this is great!""  audible vomit handlemama - haha!"
pearljam,317hy0,magical_poop,3,Thu Apr 2 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"Holy sweet Jesus, what a throwaway track that was!  I remember getting the vinyl copy of 'Vitalogy' and hearing that for the first time.  I was laying on the floor in my parent's basement, half-drunk.  So trippy, and non-commercial."
pearljam,317hy0,Scrumpilump2000,2,Thu Apr 2 22:21:33 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. The way the feedback builds, and the drums gradually come in and the bass line adds some order to the whole thing, it's more of a sonic collage than a song, but it's great. I could see a band using it as a sample to close a club show. Fits right in with some art rock and post rock stuff."

pearljam,317hy0,0utshined,2,Thu Apr 2 19:52:28 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, though I personally love it, but it is at least a semi-coherent song.

They probably wouldnt even come to my area, but Jeff is from here.  THAT's what I love about Pearl Jam (and Jeff).  They have never forgotten where they come from.  Jeff still helps with a bazillion charities in my area alone.    Back in '00, I lived with a couple of blokes who worked at a ""skate park"" (all above ground wooden ramps).  That paid 2/3 of our rent and the park was made possible by PJ and Jeff.   When I say that they have helped me as a band, I mean literal groceries in the pantry help...not just that thing they did for me with my first love and the song Black coinciding with every detail (although, of course, there was that too).   Years later, that town has a new and BADASS skatepark...also mostly organized/funed by PJ and Jeff...and Jeff just keeps building new skate parks around my state every year.    I used to folf (what we call disc golf...so sit on it, Potsie) not far from a nice place that Jeff bought for his parents.  Right in the middle of God's back yard.  Jeff is a good son to his parents and to Montana."

Me and my best friend saved our money and got my mom rip to buy us tickets to see PJ live plugged in see the first  time we saw them it was bridge school it was awesome. But I was really looking forward to see them plugged in. So we got our tickets to the show in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco my goodness the amount of people there that day  50,000 to 70,000 people bad religion opened. I wasn't  impressed with them but PJ really never has had great openers  except sonic youth was good but that is a different  story. Anyways PJ comes on plays maybe 3 to 5 songs then Eddie drops the bomb saying he is sick and can't continue  but Neil Young will play instead. I was so bummed I got up and left and have had a issue with Neil ever since. The walk back to my car hearing Neil play as I walked thru All those people just fucked me up emotionally I think.

Too many moments and not enough time for me to go back and try to go through them all. 2 enormous standouts, though.  Toronto 03 - the band went long. After the house lights were up and the final songs were playing, the nightly Ontario Place fireworks show began behind the amphitheater as RITFW was at it's strongest point. It was incredible.  Barrie 98 - my very first show. I was 18 and seeing my favourite band at an amazing (now defunct) venue, Molson Park. The atmosphere was just electric - a sunny summer day, RVs full of tailgaters and a festival atmosphere. I was absolutely euphoric.  We had rushed the stage as the gates opened to secure a spot at the front against the barricade. This was pre-Roskilde, at the end of the moshpit era. The band came out, 30 feet in front of me. The entire park was going mental. They play Corduroy as the opener.   The waiting drove me mad/you're finally here and I'm a mess  That moshpit was ridiculous. Had never been a part of anything like it before or since; there had to be 5,000 people in it. I'll never forget that day."

pearljam,308mk9,Shlenyhanna,2,Wed Mar 25 12:03:23 2015 UTC,Just put in Tokyo 3/3- Lukin into not for you!
pearljam,308mk9,Shlenyhanna,9,Wed Mar 25 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"Going to start by saying that I also really like Riot Act, but in terms of sound, I feel like it's an outlier.  The sound on the album is significantly darker and muddier than everything else they have put out.  Plus, people might not HATE Riot Act, but when they are forced to compare it to albums such as Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, and No Code/Yield/Binaural (arguing that these could be interchangeable for the purposes of rankings in a top 4 position), it's hard to place Riot Act in the top 5, especially when the sound is pretty different from stuff they put out before and after."
pearljam,308mk9,didnt_reg,4,Wed Mar 25 13:05:54 2015 UTC,Binaural does not belong with those other albums.
pearljam,308mk9,Utenlok,2,Wed Mar 25 18:58:58 2015 UTC,Except that it does because opinions differ.

pearljam,308mk9,Utenlok,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah its recording is definitely muddy and some of the songs just sound... uncomfortable to the ear. I have some favorites off of there personally (All or None and Save You especially), but I rarely listen to it all the way through."
pearljam,308mk9,jalalipop,7,Sun Mar 29 01:14:07 2015 UTC,Riot was my #1. It's literally my favorite album of all time.
pearljam,308mk9,fokerpace2000,4,Wed Mar 25 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"First 8 songs are amazing as are Help Help, 1/2 Full and All or None. Specifically Save You, LBC, You Are, Help Help, 1/2 Full and All or None are amazing. Ed's voice was on point that album and tour."
pearljam,308mk9,megamando,4,Wed Mar 25 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, Riot Act is a collection of really good PJ songs that just doesn't gel well as an album, like most of their other albums do.  Also, I personally can't stand ""Bu$hleaguer"". It's one of the few Pearl Jam album tracks that I can actually say I don't like.  Edit: One more thing, Riot Act is, more than any other PJ album imo, very much a product of it's era. I think it's possible its not as...timeless, thematically speaking, as their other older albums. That's just something I'm pondering right now, though."
pearljam,308mk9,Jencaasi,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:52:11 2015 UTC,"Bushleaguer was a pretty bush league attempt by Eddie as far as I'm concerned.   I'm fine with writing a political song to express your disapproval,  but that song just didn't deliver."
pearljam,308mk9,Utenlok,2,Wed Mar 25 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"I agree and I think it's too bad. The time was perfect for a genuinely great protest song. But, PJ put a bunch of name calling on top of a lifted Ramones music bed, instead.  I love the idea of Pearl Jam calling the Bush administration out on their bullshit, but that song just seemed juvenile."
pearljam,308mk9,Jencaasi,2,Wed Mar 25 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"Plus, the political climate at that time was weird, only a couple years after 9/11. Playing this song live during the 2003 tour was the only time I've ever heard a significant number of people actually boo the band during a show."
pearljam,308mk9,meatee,2,Wed Mar 25 19:32:06 2015 UTC,"I actually really like the song, especially live versions. But im from Britain so the political stuff isnt really relevant to me, I just like it as a song.  The one thing I like about this album is the way Eddies voice can sound happy and sad and sarcastic at the same time depending on how you look at it. Theres lots of conflicting emotions on this record which is maybe why it appeals to me."
pearljam,308mk9,manwhoel,4,Thu Mar 26 10:13:03 2015 UTC,"Well it's my personal favourite, probably for the sound of it. Foggy or muddy, so dark but humid. The flow of the album feels very natural to me. All of the following albums are too bright, somewhat cheerful and predictable musically speaking. I wish pearl jam went back and made some records like this again."
pearljam,308mk9,soup_or_crackers,3,Wed Mar 25 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"I liked Riot Act.  It ranks in my upper 50% of PJ albums, for the record. But ranking Pearl Jam records is like ranking players on an all-star team.  Even the weakest one is pretty damn good.  It's all perspective.  To me, Vitalogy is the best.  The amazing songs on that album outweigh the ridiculous amount of filler.  My least favorite is Binaural.  It starts off with one of the cheesiest, IMO, songs and doesn't get decent until track 7.  Again, all personal preference."
pearljam,308mk9,voicelessw,2,Wed Mar 25 20:25:37 2015 UTC,I was lucky enough to get to go to a bunch of shows on the 2003 tour so Riot Act holds a special place for me. I wish they'd play more Riot Act songs these days!
pearljam,308mk9,BoyWithHorns,2,Wed Mar 25 18:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's not we'll produced. Bushleaguer sounds great live and so apathetic on record. Get Right is my least favorite Pearl Jam song. For the me, the album is 8th, but doesn't mean I don't love it. I just love 7 others more."
pearljam,308mk9,nowmakeyourthrowaway,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Bushleaguer sounds great live    They haven't played it live in almost 8 years, so hopefully they have kicked it to the curb completely."
pearljam,308mk9,BoyWithHorns,2,Thu Mar 26 08:54:45 2015 UTC,"I don't expect them to ever play it again, which is the trouble with topical music."
pearljam,308mk9,nowmakeyourthrowaway,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"You might have a point about topical music in general, but it doesn't apply to Bu$hleaguer.  I think Bu$hleaguer is just a horrible song and it isn't certainly isn't because I'm a GWB fan."
pearljam,308mk9,BoyWithHorns,3,Fri Mar 27 07:40:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I disagree with that."

pearljam,308mk9,LazyGamerMike,1 point,Fri Mar 27 08:19:18 2015 UTC,"I asked a similar question a while back (albeit for a different album from PJ) and the answer I got I can agree with. It's not that the album's necessarily bad, but when compared to their other albums they enjoy them more and thus albums, like Riot Act and Backspacer get bumped down."
pearljam,308mk9,keith_ely,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:03:37 2015 UTC,"Although I think there are some big issues with Riot Act, I do think it's light years better than Binaural.    That being said I think Cropduster is one of my least favorite Pearl Jam songs.  And 1/2 Full kinda sucks too in my opinion."

pearljam,308mk9,Apwnalypse,0,Fri Mar 27 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"To me it feels like a punk / art rock record, which are genres I've always hated. I love pj for their melodic sensibilities and riot act just doesn't showcase that. I love self titled for this exact reason."

But, I can certainly try to mix them up.  I just mixed them together a little but I'm not sure where the edit should be made. Should the ramp up in Pendulum be omitted in favor of the entirety of Pendulumorphosis?"
pearljam,2zynsg,Jencaasi,2,Mon Mar 23 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, I have no experience with actual music production. But, I do work with a wave editor, so it was easy to throw them together into one track. I considered cutting them up, but I think that's above my pre-coffee, pre-breakfast ambitions today. I may do that, just for fun later though, if I think about it. Here's the link, for anyone who'd like it."
pearljam,2zynsg,Jencaasi,2,Wed Mar 25 05:40:19 2015 UTC,"This is great!  thank you.  I work on tour boats in Chicago, and this will certainly be a track I play during boarding."
pearljam,2zy550,achancesw,2,Sun Mar 22 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that I'm incorrect, but the only live version of ""Alive"" I can remember on CD single was the actual ""Alive"" single, which had a version of the song recorded at a Seattle radio station.  Otherwise, maybe the ""Dissident"" CD single/box set?"
pearljam,2zy550,Jencaasi,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Alive single didn't have a live version of Alive on it (unless you're referring to an import version I'm not familiar with). Most versions of the Alive single had Once and Wash as the B-sides. The live version of Alive that achancesw is looking for is either from the Oceans single (Live at Pinkpop '92) or the bonus track from the European version of Ten (the music video version with Matt Chamberlian on drums). I just uploaded them both so achancesw, check them out and see if one of these is what you're looking for. I'm guessing it's the Pinkpop one but both are good. I actually prefer the European Ten one.   https://www.sendspace.com/file/ajl1j3"
pearljam,2zy550,Ledbetterman10,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:26:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, now I think there's some confusion here. Unless I read something wrong somewhere along the way, the only version of ""Alive"" on the ""Alive"" single is a version recorded at RKCNDY in Seattle. The single doesn't contain the Ten version.  Edit: I just looked at Wikipedia and I guess I must be wrong. The RKCNDY version is the music video version and it doesn't say it was on the single. I guess I must be getting confused."
pearljam,2zy550,Jencaasi,2,Mon Mar 23 00:19:02 2015 UTC,I only know that sort of stuff because I was a huge nerd for the CD singles back in the 90's.

pearljam,2zm0y2,megamando,2,Thu Mar 19 21:07:57 2015 UTC,I think it's one of their top 3 albums just because it is so different.
pearljam,2zm0y2,PoppaTittyout,2,Fri Mar 20 01:23:25 2015 UTC,I never understood why Binaural didn't get more love. I'm a huge fan of Binaural and Backspacer way more so than Riot Act and Lightning Bolt.
pearljam,2zm0y2,Indosay,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Binaural, Backspacer, and the avocado album are 3 of my favs. Maybe throw Yield and Vitalogy in there for a top 5. God that's a hard list to make though haha."
pearljam,2zm0y2,beamfollower,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:49:38 2015 UTC,With you there. Got to see them in Dublin shortly after it was released. One of the best gigs I've ever been to. I bought a tour poster and had all my friends who got the bus down together to sign it. Its now framed and on my wall.
pearljam,2zm0y2,willbekins,5,Thu Mar 19 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"Love Binaural. This, Of the Girl, and Sleight of Hand are my favorites."
pearljam,2zm0y2,megamando,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:31:16 2015 UTC,Sleight of Hand has some of Ed's best lyrics of any of his compositions.
pearljam,2znxlk,Rudyjax,2,Fri Mar 20 03:50:10 2015 UTC,"Just checked my running playlists, the only ones you don't have are  Satan's Bed and WMA.  Good luck, I trained for my first 10k and then Cowtown got canceled."
pearljam,2znxlk,LoveBoneCaptain,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:15:26 2015 UTC,Oh that sucks. I went to go give Satans bed and WMA another listen and realized I only put this playlist on my phone.   WMA starts to slow for me. It like foreplay. It annoys me when I am running.   Satan's Bed: If I have a live version.   Thanks for responding.
pearljam,2znxlk,LoveBoneCaptain,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:33:14 2015 UTC,Added Satan's Bed and Got Some. Going to roll the dice and have only 1 Brain of J.

pearljam,2ziblt,LazyGamerMike,2,Wed Mar 18 20:34:11 2015 UTC,Alone is such a cool song.
pearljam,2ziblt,megamando,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:30:20 2015 UTC,It is indeed. I was happy to get to see it live there :)
pearljam,2ziblt,seekup41,2,Thu Mar 19 01:06:05 2015 UTC,Alone was easily the highlight of that show for me. It's a song I never thought I'd ever see
pearljam,2zj9ya,Stevie_Rave_On,0,Thu Mar 19 01:01:47 2015 UTC,That song reminds me so much of PJ20!  I had to go on a search and download it.  At that time I thought it was ol boom playing it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg3RXqkYeYk
pearljam,2zf6gp,forsbergisgod,2,Wed Mar 18 01:42:35 2015 UTC,The artist is a band favorite. The music is powerful. The theme is mystical. I think the band could turn this one into a new hit.

I imagine either October dates, or some winter dates, but due to harshness of traveling in Winter, I don't expect another larger tour until Spring 2016. Unfortunately :("

pearljam,2yv608,LazyGamerMike,6,Fri Mar 13 01:56:16 2015 UTC,Of the Girl from Newark 2010 is flawless. I was there...what a set list. Binaural is my favorite album... Sleight of Hand from Oslo '00 and Benaroya Hall 03 are my favorite versions.  Pearl Jam - Of the Girl (Newark '10): https://youtu.be/deRDtC9vfys
pearljam,2yv608,ASTRO2598,3,Fri Mar 13 04:28:35 2015 UTC,The MTV Unplugged version of Black is my favorite version of all time.

pearljam,2yv608,BellyFullOfSwans,5,Fri Mar 13 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"Indifference from Bologna, Italy (9-14-06) is my favorite version of that song. Always going to be upset that we'll never hear how Jeff Buckley would have sung it, because I remember Eddie mentioning when they met, Jeff sang part of it for him."
pearljam,2yv608,UtahGance,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:33:47 2015 UTC,Oh wow a Jeff Buckley version of Indifference would be heavenly
pearljam,2yv608,Tom_Anks,5,Fri Mar 13 19:52:01 2015 UTC,Check out Nothing As It Seems from Nurnberg 2000.
pearljam,2yv608,JRDAY1989,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:12:52 2015 UTC,This is my all time favorite version of Nothing as It Seems. McCready was on fire!

pearljam,2yv608,megamando,2,Sun Mar 15 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"IMO no version will ever trump the 2001 PJ20 Nothing as It Seems. For other songs I think the best version of Jeremy is Red Rocks 95(No Jeremy), Rats is the 94 Boston Orpheum, Save You from the House of Blues 2003, Indifference 94 Boston(Just Stone and Ed), Pendulum in Lincoln last tour, Last Exit Taipei Taiwan 95. Just to list some.   Edit:2001 not 2003 for NAIS"

pearljam,2yv608,bigangry,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:10:30 2015 UTC,"5/21/10 performance at MSG II in New York City had the definitive version of Lukin for me, since it was a 3 minute long SLOW version with just Ed *edit: and a strings section. Fantastic, melancholy version of it. You can listen over on gremmie.net here and see all their other signature live picks."
pearljam,2yt8v0,megamando,3,Thu Mar 12 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"Great song! And, I think it's a great example of an album opener as well."

pearljam,2yt8v0,Breylan,2,Thu Mar 12 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"I really love how this band seems to have brought Mike to become more comfortable as a songwriter in Pearl Jam. Certainly, Eddie's voice is magical but something about the layers that Layne achieved in these recordings (and Alice in Chains) is intoxicating.  This whole album is obviously fantastic but for some reason hearing I'm Above for the first time has always stuck with me."

pearljam,2yv9hg,megamando,3,Fri Mar 13 20:15:09 2015 UTC,Really hoping they're gearing up for a huge PJ25 next year.

We'll be releasing this month."" - The thing I hope they'll announce, that they definitely won't announce.  Edit: Seriously though, I feel spoiled because of the excellent USA midwest tour I got last year. But, I wouldn't feel bad at all if they said they were coming back to my area."
pearljam,2yl3t5,Jencaasi,2,Tue Mar 10 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"And If they already announced the bootleg, that means that they will announce something else. They did say announcement, not release. So tour is still in the picture"
pearljam,2yl3t5,whinniethepony,8,Tue Mar 10 21:58:14 2015 UTC,It's more than possibly a tour announcement.  Clicking the link in the newsletter gives you this.  It's most definitely a tour.
