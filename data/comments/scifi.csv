scifi,3e0085,kinyutaka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:05:03 2015 UTC,"No, that is just the image they used for the fact.   George was recast for Parts II & III, with the new actor in makeup and using camera tricks to fool the audience into believing that Crispin was involved in the movie.  Technically, they would have been okay with the newspaper clipping alone, as long as they paid the ""stock footage"" fee to Crispin.  But creating a lookalike, as opposed to simply finding a new actor with visual similarity, created a false impression of the acceptance of the original actor.  The irony of all this is that Crispin left the show because he wanted more money, but he was originally angry at the idea that George's success meant that he was wealthy now."

He felt that Marty having lots of wealth was not the right message and it should have just been happiness. He went over it in an Opie & Anthony interview a couple of years ago.

scifi,3e0085,celestialmartyr,3,Tue Jul 21 07:17:28 2015 UTC,Here he is talking about it.
scifi,3e0085,HeyZuesHChrist,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:16 2015 UTC,I always read he didn't think he was being paid enough.  The other actors (most of them) were established and his first big role was BTTF so they weren't paying him as much.  His claims that he didn't like the way the future was handled sounds ridiculous.  In the end he made a huge mistake not taking the role of George in BTTF2 and BTTF3.  I think his career would have been much bigger had he done those movies.    EDIT - After watching the Opie and Anthony interview he sounds like a fucking lunatic and I think he's full of shit.
scifi,3e0085,transmigrant,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:02 2015 UTC,You think he's a lunatic for protecting his image (i.e. business)? He basically set the rules so that studios can't do this shit now. Otherwise there'd be nothing stopping a random actor jumping into Daniel Day Lewis make up and selling a role as if DDL did it himself.
scifi,3e0085,HeyZuesHChrist,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:08:52 2015 UTC,"You think he's a lunatic for protecting his image (i.e. business)?   No, I don't think he's a lunatic for protecting his image.  I think he's a lunatic because he expects us to believe he refused to return for the sequels because he didn't like the ""future"" that Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis depicted in the movies or that he didn't like the idea of a 17-year old kid being enamored by a nice truck he could take his girlfriend out in.  What Crispin Glover didn't like was the paycheck he was offered for the sequels, which is why he didn't do it.  I think most people would be OK with this reason.  He sounds like a mad man when he starts talking about these other ridiculous reasons he didn't return.    In the end he really didn't do himself any favors.  BTTF was his breakout role.  He was a little known actor before then.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher LLoyd were already stars before the first movie.  He wasn't going to get paid what they got paid.  Lea Thompson also broke out because of the trilogy and do you know what she ended up with?  Her own sitcom in 1995 on NBC.  Do you know what Crispin Glover ended up with?  Yeah, neither do I.  He fell into obscurity for the most part after BTTF.  Tom Wilson was an unknown as well, but he made the smartest move he could make at the time, which was to reprise his role as Biff in the trilogy.  So no, Crispin Glover isn't a lunatic for protecting his image.  Actually, it was the right move.  He's a lunatic for turning down the role of George McFly in the sequels and then trying to make people believe it was for anything other than money (basically his ego)."

Those movies made his career and he can live off the residuals from those movies alone.    I remember Artie Lange saying that he receives like $20K/year for his role in Elf.  He was in one scene as Santa.  BTTF is played about 50 times more than Elf on TV each year and Tom Wilson's character had a major role in all three.

When you see a landscape full of trees and lush wildlife, with the enormous remains of a dead fire, you see a story.  You may not know the whole story, because maybe it was a wildfire or maybe it was an alien ship crash site, but upon further investigation you find an alien creature, battle worn and bleeding. Someone has to build that shit, and they have to tell a story with amazing attention to detail."
scifi,3dx9ro,seaneboy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"The director/producer is telling the story. Effects are tools, used to tell a story, but the effects company just creates what it is asked too, just as sound, lighting, dialogue, etc people do.   If you're building an office building, you don't just get a plumber and tell him to go plumb. You give him plans to follow, based on the building you want built (and that the architect designed for you). You can't build your building without him, but he's still just following your instructions. And you can't build a building out of just copper pipes, many other tradespeople are involved in making a building out of various parts so that it is habitable.  In the hands of a competent, dedicated storyteller, those tools can be used to craft a compelling story. In the hands of someone less skilled, the final product does not live up to the potential of its component elements.   A good baker can make a pie, which is better than just eating apples, flour, eggs, sugar, etc. A bad baker can take those ingredients and make an inedible mess, but it's not the apple's fault."

scifi,3e054e,Dyolf_Knip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you live your life. If you spend a lot of your time remembering the past. i.e thinking of past events, then your mind will retain those memories. I never think about the past and apart for maybe 10-25 events, my past ~40 years are mostly blank. Most of those events come without dates and many are very vague. I too only remember a general outline of my life.  My partner is one of those who remembers events, dates and people really well, but she doesn't remember technical skills that she learns for long. For me it's the other way around, I remember only technical stuff, but never past events. Can't even remember my last birthday and sometimes I even forget my age (an irrelevant number IMHO).  I can safely say that at my age, my mind is completely full. It's no longer possible for me to learn new things without degrading other memories.  So why is it like this? Well for me personally, I consider the past mostly irrelevant. I never think about the past, I never look at pictures I've taken of the past, and I never think about my deceased family members, and there are no photos in our household.  When you don't recall memories the neurons involved will eventually be re-tasked."

The theory being that they would be able to enter the time tunnel in the past, and go to the future.  Anyway, in the book some weird super-advanced aliens turn an explorer into a type of immortal ghost.  Nobody understands how that was done or what he is.  The universe is dying because some weird dark matter creatures are eating the stars, and everybody (that is still alive) bails from this universe.  A few million/billion years later the ghost guy is the only one left, past the heat death of the universe.  Because he is immortal, and doesn't even go insane, apparently.  He ends up drifting in the soup of neutrons, I think, forever.  Falls asleep or something.  The book is pretty depressing, frankly."

Stuff he wrote in the eighties is still being printed today. Hell, Watchmen has been continuously printed for almost three decades. Very, very few comics can claim as much.   Moore is a legend in the comic industry because his work has been a major influence on writers for decades.   Also, he's one of the few writers in any medium who actually refuses to receive royalties and checks for uses of his work that he disagrees with.  He's a pretentious, condescending asshat.

scifi,3du3s7,TotesMessenger,252,Sun Jul 19 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"Alan Moore makes a lot of great points.  Superhero fiction is an attempt to radically simplify the moral landscape of a chaotic world, and represents a retreat from adult life and a sort of cultural stunting. The fact that all of our superhero properties are holdovers from the previous century speaks to that as well.  I think his most salient point is that he takes a lot of flak for the prevalence of sexual violence in his work, whereas in the superhero genre generally non-sexual violence is explicitly glorified, whereas in real life crimes like rape are much more common than murder. If the appearance of a crime in fiction makes you uncomfortable, isn't that exactly the point?   The fact that we criticize this but endorse the conventional violence of superheroes says a lot about what we perceive the function of the genre to be - it's not to reflect on our nature or to be used as a discussion for widespread problems without obvious solutions; it's simple catharsis. Which we should find scary."
scifi,3du3s7,superkamiokande,161,Mon Jul 20 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know. As far as I can tell, there have pretty much always been fictional attempts to radically simplify the moral landscape of a chaotic world. That's practically why fiction was invented in the first place, if you ask me.   I've always viewed Superheroes as the mythology of our age, with the simple caveat that everyone knows they are fictional. The fact that they are holdovers from last century isn't all that surprising, and it's not like these stories are being told completely unchanged by the times. One of the things that make Superhero fiction so hard to put down is that it tends to move so easily with the times. Alan Moore himself helped push Superheroes into the modern era in the 80s and 90s with stories like Miracleman, Watchmen and Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? It makes sense that Superheroes would be holdovers from the previous century - we've only had some 15 years in this century to forge new characters and create cultural touchstones. That's not actually all that long, really.   I don't really endorse the view that it represents a retreat from adult life or cultural stunting any more than Sherlock Holmes did, or the entire genre of pulp fiction, with iconic characters like Conan, Tarzan, John Carter and the Shadow. Stories about simple catharsis have pretty much always existed and pretty much always will. I don't see what's so scary about that, to be honest."
scifi,3du3s7,Kiram,54,Sun Jul 19 15:11:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not frightened by their existence - escapism is nice at times, and I'm a big fan of Conan and John Carter and Star Wars. But I'm sort of bothered by the zeal that they generate. They've become more than just escapism to engage casually on our free time - for a lot of people, it's become part of their identities, and it's starting to inform our sense of selves and our culture. I don't know if that's a good thing."
scifi,3du3s7,superkamiokande,76,Sun Jul 19 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say this has happened before and it will happen again. Just look at the Sherlockians from the early 20th century for a fantastic example, or those who define themselves (or a large part of themselves) by allegiance to sports teams. In a very real way, we are what we do, and for some people, what they do is defined by some aspect of media, be it sport or fiction.  But beyond that, I was fairly serious when I talked about ""Modern Mythology"". Think about ancient heroes like Gilgamesh, Herakles or even the Biblical David, who's stories exist as one-part morality tale, one-part cultural touchstone, and one part pure entertainment and catharsis.   Superheroes are similar, with the caveat that everyone knows they are fictional. This doesn't rob them of their power, since they still exist as both entertainment, cultural touchstone and morality tale. It is interesting that we haven't seen too many newer examples of these things, but the Superhero may well be close to the Platonic ideal of a character like this - almost iconic, caught in a weird timelessness, and almost infinitely mutable."

scifi,3du3s7,DallasTruther,12,Sun Jul 19 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"Well, putting aside and accepting that we must run in very different circles,  since I actually have seen both of those things, my answer is threefold.   First, even without such direct references, have you never seen someone compared to a supervillain for being cartoonishly evil? Or seen cops or soldiers or firefighters or basically anyone who does a good thing compared to a superhero? Specific characters and situations might not be referenced, but trips and archetypes certainly are.   Secondly, and perhaps more tellingly, is that the situation very often works in reverse. Superhero stores have become one of our favorite places to touch on the fears, influences and situations in the world. We've seen Lex Luthor shift into a corrupt businesses man, and into the president of the United states. We've portrayed the Joker as an unpredictable terrorist. And we've had an evil presence infiltrate the national spying force, turning against the American people, and then had Captain America expose and destroy it.   This, to me at least, shows that someone asked ""What would Captain America do?"" And the movie was a wild success.   But thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, I think their power is evident in the simple fact that they are still around, and still popular, especially with kids. They have supplanted the cowboy and subsumed the detective and the adventurer in the stories we tell our children, in the way we show or values. After 77 years, they are still wildly popular. That has to say something about the power they have in our culture."
scifi,3du3s7,Kiram,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your points, but equating popularity with success is not one of them. A lot of things are popular and also worthless."

scifi,3du3s7,cold_war_kid,20,Mon Jul 20 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"You miss the point. The retreat from critical thinking related to complex social and moral issues toward a simplified black-and-white fancy that permeates comic book narratives reflects our widening detachment from reality. It is easy today to simply carve out a social niche that echos our own views, between the variety of social media outlets, 24/7 news stations, and blocking anyone on facebook that may disagree with us, that we as a culture are enclosed in an echochamber of our own making.  It isn't healthy as a society or a democracy, but we are electing to pick and choose what we want to hear and have reflected back at us by others because it is easier than tackling morally complex and grey issues that surround us. Issues we choose not to address in any meaningful discussion and that is is reflected in our criticism of authors creating content that incorporate these complex issues into popular culture. Instead of having a dialog we denounce them as being sexist or racist for even addressing the issue."
scifi,3du3s7,pinkwaffles,7,Mon Jul 20 10:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think that's to be somewhat expected due to the comparative ease of our times.  Very few of us face anything resembling life-threatening external threats anymore, (especially nasty wars, famines, diseases, very wretched poverty) and I think that means many aren't compelled to focus on anything besides vapid self-indulgence.  Wasting time on such things isn't going to make much of a difference on an individual level to an individual person.  Once a society faces a clearly recognizable monster which impacts our daily lives, I think it'll see a return to more industrious, complex, and productive forms of entertaining themselves.  The best men are made in the worst times."
scifi,3du3s7,SmegmataTheFirst,18,Sun Jul 19 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"Comic Books and super heroes have very little to do with this, though, because there have always been black and white moral fantasies for the public to retreat to, and they have unfailingly done so.   Now it's super heroes. In the 20s and 30s it was pulp detective novels and adventure stories.  Before that it was heroes in the vein of Sherlock Holmes.   And way, way before that, it was the stories of Herakles, Perseus, Gilgamesh, David and Guan Yu. Stories of King Aurthur, and Beowulf. People are always going to be drawn to black and white, good vs evil. The fact that ours now wear capes and masks are just a strange by-product of their origins."

But from its inception, the superhero has had a gigantic cultural impact. Just look at the millions that National Comics made with Superman. After the publication of Action Comics #1, the American publishing industry moved away from light comedy and Phillip Marlow/Doc Savage type pulp characters, to literally hundreds of Superman inspired characters almost instantly. The superhero and its predecessors have been massively influential cultural forces for the last century and beyond, and to ignore that or dismiss it as escapist fluff is to take the easy way out in truly analyzing the incredible impact that superhero fiction has in our everyday lives.  There's nothing wrong with fictional characters informing our lives and shaping our identities.

It's terrifying to me.  I think we've all seen the desire for justice go very wrong, especially on reddit.   The truth is that there are no truly evil people, and everyone (but the mentally ill) is acting rationally according to their circumstances.

scifi,3du3s7,superkamiokande,7,Sun Jul 19 17:40:09 2015 UTC,You are assuming rational= good. But a lot of our actions are irrational because they don't have a logical chain of reasoning to support then. Otherwise we are no more rational than a woodpecker.

As far as behavior having or not having a chain of reasoning to support it, that's true. Reasoning tends to be post-hoc. But our behaviors do have logical causal chains that make sense, predicated on imperfect knowledge, desires, and biases."
scifi,3du3s7,superkamiokande,3,Sun Jul 19 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"But you haven't explained why you think rationality matters.   A man might beat his girlfriend's face in because he's annoyed with her.  This is a ""rational"" action.  But I have no hesitation saying both that it's wrong and that we should use the power of the state to stop it.  Another person may kill a person of a different religion because he doesn't recognize their personhood.  Again, I have no problem with the state stepping in to punish that person.  It just doesn't matter whether the person was acting rationally.  It's not important.  Maybe hunter-gatherers 50,000 years ago raided strangers to take their property.  That's no justification for bank robbery today."

scifi,3du3s7,DharmaPolice,8,Sun Jul 19 18:30:17 2015 UTC,The relationship between superheroes and the law is ambiguous - in a lot of stories the heroes are explicitly working with the police and will not follow a particular course of action because it's not legal. Even where they're acting as vigilantes they usually end up handing the bad guys over to the authorities.  But personally I think the idea that you should always obey the law (no matter what) a much more disturbing and dangerous lesson to teach kids.

Captain America, for instance rarely works outside the law. The Flash has a damned museum built for him by the city and works mostly work the cops.   Spider-Man certainly works outside the law, and is often hunted by the police, as are various incarnations of Batman and the X-men.   Then there are all the weird edge cases like Wonder Woman, Namor, Aquaman, Thor, and Superman who are rulers of Representatives of other nations, and thus not really subject to our laws.   And violence also isn't always the answer. It often is, because fights make great action, and action is exciting and fun to read. But the Fantastic Four often find themselves thinking their way out of a situation. The Flash, again is often shown capturing criminals without injuring them, simply using his super speed to deposit them into a cop car or jail cell.   Actually, a lot of the Flash's action beats can revolve around him using his speed in novel ways, rather than punching badguys. Same with Superman. Putting out fires, saving crashing planes, even talking a jumper out of suicide in at least one unforgettable scene.   Basically, there are a ton of superheroes out there. Broad generalizations aren't going to get you anywhere when trying to talk about such a huge and long lasting genre."

Also, when do you see the desire for justice executing its post-hoc moral rationalization?  Is it post-hoc to developing a desire for power itself, or post-hoc to the actual achievement of power?"
scifi,3du3s7,jello_aka_aron,8,Sun Jul 19 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"I tend to view a lot about society and human interaction in terms of power, so take all of this with a grain of salt.  The pursuit of justice is all about correcting (perceived) power imbalances. People often talk about feeling powerless when they are victims, and justice serves to redress that imbalance by using existing power structures (the state, the community) to grant the victim more power (maybe the power to not be harassed, at the minimum, or the power to punish).  The biggest difference between this and what we would consider a psychopath pursuing power to simply have power over others is that justice requires moral vindication. If you're in the wrong, you aren't acting in the interest of justice. But then the question arises of how you know whether you're in the right or in the wrong, which is resolved by our capacity to make moral judgments.  One thing we know about moral decision making from psychology research is that people make decisions first and assign moral reasoning second. So the moral justification/rationalization happens only after you've decided that you're entitled to seek more power (or do whatever you've decided to do).  This is what scares me about justice - it's fundamentally dishonest. Two men can ""wrong"" each other and both feel entitled to justice, and both have decided that they are right before they decide why they are right. It happens constantly, and it's completely counterproductive to people's stated goals of wanting to improve their lives and the lives of others.  Feel free to disagree and add your two cents. I'm just glad to be able to have these discussions."
scifi,3du3s7,IvanDenisovitch,5,Sun Jul 19 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"All of which points to why decisions about justice have to be made slowly, deliberately, and by uninterested 3rd parties."

That's why the discourse here revolves around getting people to your side and discrediting people you disagree with. I think it's funny how people fight and yell at each other over the internet about stuff that should be (or is being) handled by the legal system - because there's a real value to the court of public opinion.   I call it social currency. People are always jockeying for more social currency, for more social support, more people on their side, agreeing with them. Because for social animals, support is power. And this ties in to the general discussion on justice, because fundamentally it's all about power.  Or were you implying that people behave differently in groups than they do alone?

Do you base your personal opinions on fictional characters? I don't recall myself EVER doing that.   an attempt to radically simplify the moral landscape of a chaotic world, and represents a retreat from adult life and a sort of cultural stunting   You could say that for a lot of things: gardening, meditation, games, TV... the fact that someone wants to retreat from real life doesn't really is a problem on itself, it MAY be a symptom of a problem however, but thats not generally the case, most people are mentally healthy enough to consume comic books for its entertainment value, and I go back to my point: who bases his decisions or actions on comic book characters? I can only expeculate that people that already have a mental problem in place, going back again: it's not a problem its just a symptom, consequence not cause.  We live in an age of consumism, people buy entertainment cause thats what you do when you have money to spare, and comics is just 1 grain of sand in the huge beach of things we buy to entertain ourselves.   And about the criticism he takes, well if you're public person and you do your work for the public it will ALWAYS have critics, and most of them have a narrow view of the problem, just as he has criticizing heroes, its the lack of undersanding humans and society that actually makes criticism ignorable material, just like someone criticizes him for violence cause violence is bad, they dont understand concepts like artistic freedom, the crafting of a good history, freedom of speech or even the intention of the artist in portrait certain situatior, let alone the context where the violence takes place or its consequences on the history.  What people dont understand (even for themselves) is that they usually dont have the full grasp and understanding of what they're criticizing.

The world is changing too fast. Future shock is a real thing, and it was inevitable. I don't think scapegoating superheroes will work.

These kind of stories are created as a means of exploring values, examining those values in the face of challenges, and observing how those values grow and change over time.  We use them to interpret and reinterpret everything form morality to traits that are simply admirable. We examine our own frailness, both physical and otherwise.

The isolationist elves, the exiled king - the stories are much more complex than your average Marvel movie and yet provide equal (if not superior) entertainment."
scifi,3du3s7,murphmeister75,6,Sun Jul 19 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"There isn't really the subtlety in the LotR movies. Denethor is pretty much an ass, having been robbed of any real redeeming complexity, Theoden was basically shown as having been mind controlled by Saruman, and Saruman was unambiguously evil. The elves weren't shown as dogmatically isolationist (even showing up at Helm's Deep to lend a hand), and there wasn't much of any exploration of Aragorn's feelings or motivations in regards to leadership. There is more nuance in the books (though it's still pretty simple) but there are also tons of comics out there that are more complex than ""your average Marvel movie"". You're comparing across media and that's not really fair."

He's good, helping Frodo and Sam destroy the ring, acting as a guide and escort and even fighting for them, as friends. In this good position, he is Smeagol.  And yet as Gollum,  he's duplicitous, and petty. In this version, he's seeking only one thing: the selfish possession of the ring.  You can argue that both together add complexity, or muddle the waters of whether he is good or evil. Instead, he is simply there to highlight how stark the difference between good and evil is. He is both, at once, and neither. Ultimately, his final act shows him to be evil, though his act is ultimately good for everyone.  For Gollum, morality is not a dial, but a switch. He is good, or he is evil. He's not much in between."

Characters can go from good to evil, and occasionally back from evil to good (can't have a Catholic morality tale without the chance for redemption/forgiveness), but they can never be somewhere in the middle. Saruman was good, then he fell and became evil due to his sin of pride. Gollum/Smeagol could only be good and evil by making him two characters in one body. Frodo fell to evil at the very last moment, but was saved when the object of his temptation, the object that led him into sin, was destroyed.   LotR is a very black and white tale that's inescapably intertwined with Catholic morality and ideas of sin."

scifi,3du3s7,Bugsysservant,4,Sun Jul 19 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"Frodo and Bilbo both becoming bad-guys, at heart, is deep stuff, though.  There's at least that one facet. And Saurumon thinking that Sauron would be better dealth with from the inside - and trying to get Gandalf to join him on the inside so that they could defeat Sauron together from the inside - and that being partly delusional on Saurumon's part - was also pretty deep."
scifi,3du3s7,bad_keisatsu,2,Sun Jul 19 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about the corruption of the ring bearers, but it's not hard to find comics which deal with similar issues on a similar level of depth: in many ways that's the entire premise of Irredeemable, for instance. Saruman's logic essentially just boils down to ""do the ends justify the means?"" and even in the books his arguments aren't particularly complex, and Tolkien never gives any real sense that he might be right. I would argue that dealing with questions on that level is pretty common with superheroes, particularly if you look outside the movies."
scifi,3du3s7,JustZisGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"The book has surprisingly little violence and it is easy to forget after watching Peter Jackson's films. Most of the violence of the movies is not detailed in the books, only implied before or after. The villain of the book is never involved in a fight, and he is killed by throwing the ring in a volcano.   As to good vs evil, Sauron is ultimate evil, but the hero of the story is unable to defeat him and needs the assistance of an evil character who was spared.   Even a shallow reading of the books shows far greater depth than Marvel's superhero blockbusters. I think your comparison does not support your argument."

The Scouring of the Shire succinctly describes one battle and Saruman has his throat cut. Even in that chapter, the war is summarized after the fact (there is a list of hobbits killed during the skirmishes). The chapter is mostly about bringing out the courage of the timid hobbits. I personally think the battle of Helm's Deep is the best counter-example since it is detailed from beginning to end.  Compare this to recent superhero films. Most recently I saw The Avengers 2. There is hardly a scene in the entire movie that does not involve a battle, much less implying that a battle took place but not showing one so you can get back to the character development. That is copious violence."

I mean, Watchmen was a major Hollywood movie, and Holywood has almost overdone gritty, morally-ambiguous superheroes. There have certainly been more complex ones.  So if his point is that they're a holdover from the last century, well, every generation since has changed these heroes to suit them -- they're more archetypes than they are characters. And if his point is that it's a retreat from the complexities of adult morality, then contemporary superheroes seem to be maturing with their audience.  I do think there's a difference the glorification of violence (versus sexual assault) -- generally, it's only glorified when the good guys do it. And while it's easy to put a hero in a position where physical violence is necessary, when would a hero need to sexually assault someone, instead of just violently assault them?  And I don't find it scary for something to be cathartic, either. Not every superhero needs to be complicated, or to encourage discussion of widespread problems without obvious solutions.

The heroes step in and save us from terror just as the government hopes we perceive them. The average citizen is always portrayed as an idiot or helpless or both and they must always be saved by someone wearing a costume. Whether that costume is a super heroes spandex or a military uniform or police uniform or a politicians uniform, the association is that uniforms, protection and law and order all go together in a nice neat package."

But I wouldn't say, categorically, that this infantilization is any more to blame on superhero movies than commercialization.  Products with wide appeal have the greatest potential for sale.  If everyone from the young to the old, brilliant to dumb as rocks can appreciate it, it's got a great potential to make quite a lot of money.  Making films for money, rather than the existence of comics, is probably more the cause of the sadly over-simple concepts which are most prevalent in film, and superhero movies are just the present medium vogue.  I'll not argue that they're anything but vapid, meaningless, self-indulgent wastes of time which leave you no better off for having watched them, but I don't think much in entertainment is any different.  edit oh, are we sad someone doesn't like our favorite man with his underpants outside?

Is there a lasting reason to question if our lives have any meaning/value whatsoever, or question the relationship between the sexes or the intent and structure of a possibly corrupt government?  It may just be my personal view, and frankly I would love for it to be torn apart, but for the majority of people, is it really a bad thing to keep your head down, feed your pets and use this medium as a means of escape?

Just like how humans have dehumanized and simplified outgroups for thousands of years. A recent set of examples are here:  'Chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body.

And don't give me the ""rape is much more common"" thing, IEDs are notorious for shredding soldier's genitals. The fact is castration, mutilation and rape are, unlike killing, never justifiable. If a villain does them, it's because he's indulging his extreme sadism and so instantly becomes utterly unsympathetic to the audience.  To use a recent example: Tywin was an asshole, but he was a fun villain who you didn't mind seeing win. The Boltons, by contrast, have none of that - the most entertaining thing they will ever do is die.   Besides, read Moore's Lovecraft book if you have any doubt.

Here are some other thoughts:   Do we have a fascination with castration and mutilation then, seeing as how we so rarely see those things in fiction as well?    To be fair, Saw and Hostel and the like are very popular. I never saw 24 but that was a very popular show that apparently indulged in lots of torture.    And don't give me the ""rape is much more common"" thing, IEDs are notorious for shredding soldier's genitals.    I think that's part of a different cultural issue: media about war are often glorifying war. I don't know if shredded genitals fit into the heroism motif. Even then, war stories show people's blown off heads and limbs and whatnot; any squeamishness about giving the same treatment to genitals only reinforces the idea that we (in the west at least) have an obvious cultural hangup about sex-related stuff."

I did not mean to imply our culture never explores those topics, only it requires a very specific type of story and setting to be able to without ruining the fun.   Imagine if the Joker in The Dark Knight had just castrated Harvey Dent, cut off Commissioner Gordon's hands, and raped Racheal for hours. Instantly the movie is an entirely different thing. Tv tropes calls this a ""moral event horizon"", and it's generally a bad idea to have your villain go across it.   any squeamishness about giving the same treatment to genitals only reinforces the idea that we (in the west at least) have an obvious cultural hangup about sex-related stuff.   We do indeed have cultural hang-ups about sex stuff. That's why rape is at the same level of bad in our media as mutilation - despite mutilation permanently reducing someone's ability to physically function. But the fact that both mutilation and rape are so rare in fiction is caused by the difficulty of incorporating such nakedly horrific behaviour into a story."

Stories like Buck Rodgers and Flash Gordon were fine a couple decades ago, but now that we're come to realize that we won't be whizzing around the universe in rocketships anytime soon, there's no interest in the characters anymore.

scifi,3du3s7,zap283,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"We can disagree with his opinion that superheroes are actively damaging the art of this generation, but he does speak some truth. Facts are facts: superheroes are a somewhat juvenile, simplified depiction of the chaos and unpredictability of life, and it's true that we cannot seem to move on from the ones we made 80-50 years ago and are instead just fixated on telling their stories long after they should have ended. In my mind, a good story is like a good bowel movement: it has to end at some point otherwise you're just squatting down, pushing needlessly for something that's never going to come out. And to be honest, after the MCU concludes, it's time that we retire a great many beloved superheroes, give them viking funerals and start from the ground floor again. The current Marvel and DC universes are cluttered messes of tired characters, deaths, rebirths and retcons; they've run their courses, time for a very long nap.  What we can debate, however, is whether or not this is culturally stagnating us. Perhaps a bit. But consider the idea that this culture is defining itself by remastering old stories that - now - don't hold up so well. We took the absurd camp of the Adam West Batman in the 50's and created The Dark Knight, a film that you can pull messages and historical context from like a candy bag. We took the similarly childish Marvel universe and created the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is arguably one of the most faithful and yet modernized remasters ever created. There's an old adage that there are only seven stories in the world and that we're just telling different versions of each one every generation, over and over; perhaps this is just a more pronounced version of that.  On the point of sexual violence, that's not hard to answer. Sexual violence isn't prevalent in art not because it's worse than murder as a crime, but because it can't be justified. You can justify murder: self-defense, wartime, ends-justify-means, lesser-of-two-evils, etc. But it takes a special kind of despicable, a horribly unique sort of sadist, to rape someone. It's something we reserve for the truly irredeemable characters that nobody wants to root for or get out alive: Ramsay Snow, Lt. Thorne from BSG, Alex from CWO, Freddy Krueger, etc."

But human cultures have done this for pretty much all of history. We all have our stories that get passed down through the generations. They grow and change over time, just as superhero stories. Our Superman today is not the Superman from 50 years ago, or even the one from 10 years ago, and yet he is paradoxically the same character. But our continuing reinterpretation of that character and what he means is not a retreat from anything- it's a critical analysis of our own culture and that of the people who came before us.  And this isn't anything new. Just look at how many stories there were about Hercules. His life, family, parentage, adventures, and death were changed over and over again, in order to suit the times and places his story was told. Heck, we haven't even stopped rewriting that story today. And each time it changes, we get one more link in a long chain that connects us to cultures past- a chain that's an invaluable historical tool, as well.  So yes, the stories are, taken as a whole, a mess of contradictions, retcons, deaths, and rebirths.  But that's okay.  They're not one single unified story.  They're just our modern mythology."

scifi,3dx9uy,Bikewer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"The question of consciousness transfer also explored in Dollhouse, the Joss Whedon TV show about uploading consciousnesses to bodies. It fits within the ""nearly infinite number of far weirder and more effective"" stories that do the concept well and don't just treat it like the non-implanted consciousness is permanently gone, no looking back, no complexity.  Initially (in viewing order) they just make ""new"" characters out of fragments of memories and personalities and put the original one back in once the body owner's contract as an ""Active"" is over, but the concept of implanting whole consciousnesses becomes more and more important as the show goes on. There's also the idea that each imprint can leave a remnant, at least for certain individuals. Very enjoyable show in my opinion, but I haven't seen a Joss Whedon film or show I didn't like.  Probably not a popular opinion, but I also like the book The Host by Stephanie Meyer on this topic. The setting reminded me a little bit of Half-Life 2 and The Invasion (with it being set after a successful self-righteous alien invasion, and there being a hunted human resistance) but with the interesting twist of the main character being a genuinely good person (in my opinion) who is a mind-controlling alien parasite. She has to struggle with the fact that unlike most bodies the parasites are put in, the original owner of this body is somehow still conscious deep inside, and is, in terms of complexity as a consciousness, her equal. That sparks the existential crisis of whether the alien is committing an atrocity simply by continuing to exist.  The critical and audience opinion of the film adaptation seems to be that it is doing that. I haven't seen it, but from watching some trailers I guess it focusses more on the love triangle elements (which I found kind of meh in the book) rather than the gritty, dark themes that made me like the book: what makes someone a good person, the morality of how we should interact with non-(whatever species one is) intelligences, whether we owe our culture loyalty, and the harsh body-and-mind-pushed-beyond-their-limits solitary survival elements."
scifi,3e0adn,kangaloo,5,Mon Jul 20 23:36:55 2015 UTC,It's a tossup between psychic powers and aliens being able to mate with each other. I give older scifi a pass there though. Or works based on that older material. The level of general scientific understanding the average layperson could be expected to have back then was just very different than today's standards.   When it pops up in modern day stories both will usually draw me out of the narrative for a bit. It's especially bad when psychic powers are used as some big reveal. I might roll my eyes if they're around at the very start of a story. But if everything seems properly science based at the start and then halfway through we're getting psychic powers and ghosts? That really throws me out of the story for a while.
scifi,3e0adn,TheseMenArePrawns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"Both of those bug me significantly. I get that the psychic power thing is a leftover from the golden age of sci-fi when everyone thought the next great step in humanity would be mental powers, but it bugs me a lot."

Something the author just made up is fine, the more outlandish the better, but when something is based on actual bad science, I just can't.   Example: When I read Y: The Last Man, I stopped at the big reveal, because the whole premise was based on a flawed scientific study. The study was even mentioned by one of the characters to explain everything. Still can't bring myself to finish that series."

scifi,3e0adn,Excelsior_Smith,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:53 2015 UTC,The mechanism of suspension of disbelief is to allow the writer/author/storyteller to propose their premise and then sustain it through the story. If a story has elements that undermine the premise  then the audience has been cheated of their time.   The worst offenses that disrupt the suspension of disbelief is typically poor research and the author writing about something they know nothing about.    A good example is when an author uses urban legends as scientific fact. The idea that a person only uses 10% of their brain is a falsehood but a lazy writer will use it without thinking to see if it is true.

scifi,3duzia,TheDudeNeverBowls,2,Tue Jul 21 07:56:58 2015 UTC,"Galaxy Quest, though, is a total satire on Star Trek fandom.  And it's a great fucking movie.  Personally, I think of it as the tenth Trek film, it was followed by Nemesis (11), which was not very good, then 2009 (12) which wasn't as bad as it seems in retrospect (it's actually a pretty solid film).  That was followed by ST:ID (13).  The next one will be good - as a Star Trek movie. It will probably fail as a tentpole picture, but I'm cool with that.  Hopefully Lin and Pegg don't take too much heat from the studio for it's eventual box office failure."
scifi,3duzia,NotWithoutIncident,2,Tue Jul 21 08:07:41 2015 UTC,"Nemesis is my least favorite Trek, which I would never have believed if you told me after Insurrection that there would be an even worse one. Why do you say the new one has to fail commercial to be a good Trek movie though? Wrath of Khan, Voyage Home and First Contact were all very successful at the box office.  In terms of Galaxy Quest I get where you're coming from, but just because it's a Star Trek parody I don't think that makes it more of a Star Trek movie than anything else. Was Austin Powers a James Bond movie? I'm sticking with my Matrix holodeck idea that I rather like :)"
scifi,3duzia,TheDudeNeverBowls,2,Tue Jul 21 09:03:51 2015 UTC,"Lol, that's cool with me :)  Anyway, it's about money.  Only II, III, V and the last two were summer movies.  If you look at their budgets, they were modest, even for that time.  The new Star Trek movies are behemoths.  They are 200 million dollar tentpole films for Paramount. Warners has DC.  Disney has Marvel AND Lucarfilms.  Heck, even Sony has Spiderman, sort of. Universal has done well with Minions and of course Jurassic World, but Paramount knows it's falling behind.  It used to be that Star Trek was one of the smaller films.  They were made for less than $50 million, and they usually did pretty darned good.  A movie at that price can afford to leave a young director alone with the project.  He/she gets to do what they want. This isn't the case for tentpole films.  By definition, a tentpole is what holds the tent up.  A tentpole film is what holds the studio up.  Paramount has a lot banking on this film.  The other two did really well - still not as good as the studio would have liked, but really well nonetheless. This one needs to blow the roof off the building as far as the studio is concerned.  I say, however, that in order to do that, it will have to be Jurassic World.  I don't know whether or not you've seen it, but it's severely lacking.  But that's another story.  My main point is that Lin and Pegg are true fans.  Orci was a fan, but he was also a Hollyweird hack.   Lin and Pegg are the real deal.  Obviously, Pegg's nerd credentials are pretty well documented.  Yeah, he made some snarky comments for ID, but who could blame him for defending something he'd spent a year of his life working on????  Lin credits TOS as one of the reasons he went into filmmaking. I saw Better Luck Tomorrow in the theaters.  It's a poignant, yet silly little movie that the guy maxed out ten credit cards to make. Neither Orci, Kurtzman, nor Abrahms ever did anything remarkably like that.  Sure, they had their own struggles coming up, but none had that level of dedication in my opinion.  I'm rambling and I haven't answered the question.    I think these guys are gonna make the nearest to perfect Trek film that we fans will gush over for decades to come.  It will spark the interest in a new series in a way that could never have been done before.  You think /r/startrek has grown since the beginning of nuTrek? No, this film will bring new fans in a way that will truly reinvent the franchise.  But will it win July 2016 - and that's the point - ? I say no. It has very little competition on opening weekend, so it will most likely win, but how much? The 4th of July will be a Monday, a three day weekend.  People will be rolling back home and getting settled in after spending all their money on the holiday. That weekend won't be a big weekend, and everyone knows it.  Then, Bourne 5 comes out the following weekend.  If my theory holds, then Star Trek 14 will be action packed, yet more cerebral than earlier installments.  Us nerds will love it forever.  But the summer moviegoing crowd (now done with their post-4th lethargy) will be relishing in Matt Damon returning to the action character that has changed all our minds about him as an actor. ESPECIALLY if The Martian is good.  Seriously, if The Martian is good (and I really hope it is), then Bourne 5 will destroy Star Trek 3 on it's second weekend. And that's where the money comes from.  Granted, my usage of the word failure when it comes to Hollyweird films isn't really failure.  The movie will have a $400 million or so worldwide gross.  But that won't be enough for Paramount on a $200 million dollar movie.  But it will be wonderful for us.  If Pegg and Lin can capture that balance between intriguing action and spirit that makes Trek great, then we will be in for a good time.  Look, this is what I hope to happen.  What will probably happen is that we'll get another nonsensical plot that has some nods to Star Trek, but enough action to keep everyone in China talking about the latest American summer movie.  It would be so amazing if you actually just read all that, lol.  Cheers :)"

scifi,3duzia,TheDudeNeverBowls,2,Tue Jul 21 09:57:27 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I really hope the best for it.  I hope Pegg can nail down a plot that works in the universe, and I hope Lin can make it work. Heck, Lin's work on the first two episodes of True Detective were pretty good given the shitty material he had to work with.  But, as you say, either way, it will be something that will be part of the franchise I love so much, and that's really the point.  Star Trek has been a helpful guiding force in my life.

By doing so he's violating the terms of his agreement with the government after the events at the end of the movie, since pre-crime was outlawed.  The show looked to be very promising, at a minimum because of all the cool tech and gadgets they have, but I didn't feel much chemistry between the cast.  Will be curious to see how it goes once the entire episode airs."

The Last Starfighter - the coming of age story about a boy stuck with no prospects for a better future, who rises to the challenge to achieve greatness and his destiny.  Kind of timeless, Joseph Campbell stuff.  Limitless - not old at all, so nothing much has changed there.  Minority Report - only thing I can think of how the meaning of this has changed might be about how survailance has increased since the movie came out, which kind of parallels the concept of the pre-cogs always watching us.

He never literally got sucked into the game, unless you mean figuratively sucked into the war, but in that case I just finished reading Armada by Ernest Cline (released a few days ago) and it's basically a reboot of The Last Starfighter for the 21st century.  It wasn't that great, but it's an example that the concept still applies today.  Your Minority Report points are interesting, but all relate to the book.

These days a lot of the mystery that video games once had is gone, you can look up all the secrets in a Wiki, you can watch a MakingOf on Youtube and game mechanics have become so drastically simplified that skill is most of the time completely irrelevant. Games with a meaningful high score are pretty rare these days, arcade cabinets are gone as well and  space sims have also gone out of fashion.  You can of course still make the plot work if you bend it enough, but there is a high risk of it just looking silly. Video games today are to much of a well understood product and there just isn't a lot of mystery left.  Tron 2 had kind of the same problem, it still ended up ok, but today we are just surrounded to much by computers for that plot to be plausible. Tron2 also ignored everything the Internet and modern computers have grown into, so the whole thing ended up being more retro-futurism then forward looking sci-fi."

As long as they aren't openingly doing it, it's hard to actually do anything real about it.   As for House Atreides, they had been building political standing with all the other Great Houses for years, and the Emperor saw a day when they would possess more actual power than the throne. While openly boosting Atreides, he gets some ride along standing. By secretly helping House Harkonnen, he makes sure they can wipe out Atreides, while all the ""bad karma"" for the destruction falls completely on the Harkonnen heads, losing them even more favor with the other houses.  And the Emperor side teamed with the Guild to charge enough money for the Saradukar and transport for all the troops, to drain them of a lot of the surplus cash they had built up over their management of Dune, leaving them cash weak, and with almost no political capital as well."

There is another Novel also originally written in French simply called the Twentieth Century by Albert Robida. But Its a great read. It make a lot of predictions some of them hilarious others weirdly accurate. The big ones are it predicts things like the 24 hour news cycle (at one point near the beginning there is a live news cast from a warzone), and the possibility of answering machines and leaving people voice mail. Globalization is also a thing, at one point when two characters are traveling around the world they note that they didn't stop in Tokyo as, its just another city and you could just as well be in Paris.    The author also picks the idea of universal suffrage and womens liberation but takes it in a curious direction. There are female characters who hold seats in Parliament, but they also challenge each other to duels (with swords) over points of fashion."

(Namely, that apparently, Catholics are awful, and specifically the Jesuits are going to take over the world.)   It's not a terribly influential book, but it is interesting in that it was published in 1733, probably one of the oldest books to take a speculative look into the future. So that's cool.  As a side note, I would watch so much more reality TV if all the petty arguments were settled with sword duels.

Francis Godwin wrote of men travelling to the Moon with a Utopian society in the 1620s.  He was even a Tolkien type nerd who made up a language and a Lunar script.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Moone  And how can we forget the Mayan's predictions of 2012? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon#Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar  which also turns up this tidbit: The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of Christopher Columbus, who was compiling a work called Libro de las profecias during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the ""Maia"" on Guanaja, an island off the north coast of Honduras.  Influenced by the writings of Bishop Pierre d'Ailly, Columbus believed that his discovery of ""most distant"" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the Apocalypse. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the Spanish Conquest as the result of popular astrological predictions in Europe of a second Great Flood for the year 1524.  A Jewish sect saw AD 66-70 as the end time  The Essene sect of Jewish ascetics saw the Jewish revolt against the Romans in 66–70 as the final end-time battle. By the authority of Simon, coins were minted declaring the redemption of Zion.  An Assyrian tablet dated 2800 BC asserted that those were the end days  An Assyrian clay tablet dating to around 2800 B.C. bears the inscription: “Our Earth is degenerate in these later days; there are signs that the world is speedily coming to an end; bribery and corruption are common; children no longer obey their parents; every man wants to write a book and the end of the world is evidently approaching.  If you want to get technical about it, there are plenty of stories about people time travelling back to the before the creation of the present universe, and talking about obviously future events.  The present issue of Green Lantern has the Green Lantern Corps travelling to a universe before the present one, and encountering characters that existed before the universe as well as a past version of Krona from at least 10 bya before he witnessed the creation of the universe.  You can't get any earlier than the prior to the creation of space-time, right?  In a related vein, when dealing with time travel, last month's issue of Action Comics speaks of their being no fixed future and no fixed past, you can only be sure of the present moment, which is a very Buddhist way of looking at things."

scifi,3dory3,crybannanna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:14:20 2015 UTC,"Mostly the stories themselves and their structure. They are often very much structured similarly to fables. Rather than being structured as historical literature, they often deliver a moral story like a fable does.   Historical texts don't have as much flowery language and they often don't have, when boiled down, a singular explanation for a natural phenomenon.   One could look at the entire story of Noah as simply the explanation for why rainbows exist. A complicated tale with moral teachings that ultimately answer a single question about the nature of a natural phenomenon.   When you look at the Old Testament stories comparing to other fables, it becomes hard to believe they weren't mostly written as such. With a few exceptions mixed in, which appear more historically relevant (if hyperbolic). The story of genesis is very clearly a fable, along with anthropomorphized animals. The story of Exodus reads more like an attempt at history. So it's a good mix of the two."
scifi,3dory3,Aristox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"You're judging what is and is not 'historical style' based on what is considered standard historical style in our modern era. The truth is that basically all historical texts and records written before the Common Era (ie the AD years) were written in that fable/myth style. That definitely makes them less reliable as historical resources, but it's not enough to say they were actually intended as fiction.  It might seem reasonable at a superficial glance that they were written as fictional stories, but basically every academic historian would disagree with you."
scifi,3dory3,crybannanna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:31 2015 UTC,"We don't really have too much historical writings from the era of the Old Testament from which to base a comparison, unless I'm wrong (which I often am).   This is admittedly just my thought on the matter, I can't really back it up unfortunately. I'm not well versed enough in ancient texts to really assess them.   I am curious what ancient historical accounts you are referring to though. Do they have accurate depictions of historical accounts?  If not, how are we to know that those too were not intended as fable/fiction? It's difficult to frame a comparison, in my mind, with other non-accurate writings from a long dead age. Perhaps there is some metric I am unaware of to assess.  I am curious and open to learn that I'm wrong.   My thought is just that there is a logical way to frame a historical account, versus a fictional story. The manner by which it is presented can be either factual, or flowery. For instance, when we write a historical work about others we tend not to describe the inner workings of a person's mind, because we can't know that. In fictitious works we can do this because the characters and their thoughts are invented by the writer. Perhaps in ancient times we tended to inflate our historical accounts. Though when we look at Ancient Greek mythology vs teachings of philosophers we can often discern fact from fiction. The writing style differed greatly between the fable and the history.   Considering the books of the bible were written by different authors and separated by a great deal of time we can see different styles at work. Some appear to be an attempt at a historical account, while others appear obviously fictitious to me (Jonah in the whale springs to mind). Yet others seem like a mix of history with fable.   I don't know how we can accurately assess the motivation of writers from 5000 years ago, especially when we don't even know who those authors were or anything about them. We can perhaps, try to understand what is reasonable knowledge for people at the time. If a story aligns with what could be considered reasonable knowledge, than it could be historical. If it diverges from that it would likely be fiction. Presumably ancient people witnessed accounts of large sea creatures attacking people... Presumably, being sea faring, they saw the way a large ocean predator ate. They would know that swallowing a person whole is a fanciful tale, they would know that a person wouldn't survive that encounter. But it could be a fun story to tell nevertheless.   Though perhaps I am giving ancient people more credit than they deserve, I often feel they are treated as complete simpletons when this seems unlikely.

scifi,3dory3,cleanedge,0,Sat Jul 18 14:03:32 2015 UTC,"Ever heard of the Book of Revelation?  There's a whole host of very specific predictions and numbers dealing with the end of the World, return of the Angelic host, plagues of locusts, the Rapture, the Four Horsemen, and the defeat of the Beast/Satan.  There's a lot of sci fi and fantasy based on Revelation too, like the Left Behind Series, the Day the Earth Stood Still, the Spawn Comics from Image, Job, a Comedy of Justice from Heinlein, futures with the Apocalypse character from Marvel Comics, and pretty much every work everywhere that's ever dealt with the Hebrew God and Apocalypse.  Shoot, probably every generation since Revelation has written how the events of Revelation will come to pass in the present generation, and history is littered with such predictions.  We definitely know this is true of the generation in which it was written, who believed that Christ would return in their lifetime after his crucifixion.  It is the original source of the Judgement Day narrative that Christ will return to defeat the anti-Christ.  Remember Prince's Party like it's 1999?  That's based on the Book of Revelation too."

I'm a sucker for supernatural/angelic stuff, which is what drew me in.   The writing is poor, the acting isn't much better, and the tropes are plentiful. There's some good stuff in there (the guy who plays the Devil, for example), but it's few and far between.   If you want an ""alien helps you save the human race"" series I'd actually recommend something a few years old - Odyssey 5.

More people need to see the Assembly Cut of Alien 3, which aside from a couple technical film issues(Bad audio in a couple places, bad CGI), is a vastly superior and different movie.  About the only thing the Theatrical Release beats it in is the ending scene is done better, even though the differences are purely aesthetic without any impact on the story.  You can find the Assembly Cut as part of the Alien Quadrilogy or Alien Anthology sets. It's not generally available standalone, and it's pretty annoying to find a torrent of, too.

Facehuggers create Panic and a flamethrower accidently torches Ripply's pod.   She survives, but her pod is damaged and she is in critical condition.   She gets shipped back to earth in a new pod for medical care.  Hick's is OK.   Sends Newt home on the same transport with Ripply.  Company has samples of the face hugger/egg that were in Bishop's pod.  Koreans try creating a bio weapon (just like Ripply feared WY would), they lose control because it's bigger and meaner than normal.  WY poses their research as ""cancer treatments"", but it's really bioweapon research with a PC twist.  They accidently create an airborne spore than can infect people, shocked when it escapes.  Also spreads via bite/claw.  Chest Bursters can grow inside you because you breathed it now.  Bummer.  Both stations get destroyed.   Hicks and a few other survivors escape on a transport.  Everyone is scared because no one knows for sure who might be infected.  Fun story, good read.  A few bad scenes, several good scenes, in general I think it had a lot more potential than the movies they ended up making."

Also, what exactly is the logic behind Korean controlled space? Are these star systems or sections of the solar system?  Taking only Bishop's head seems like complete plot BS. They just let the transport go home after stealing from it..... Uh..... There's no way WY will notice their android is missing.   But yes, it sounds better than Alien 3 was."
scifi,3dn30t,standish_,3,Fri Jul 17 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, that sound like Hicks is the main and Ripley doesn't even have a speaking part.   That is exactly the case.  Ripley has no spoken lines.   Sigourney Weaver didn't even need to be casted for the movie.   Also, what exactly is the logic behind Korean controlled space? Are these star systems or sections of the solar system?   They didn't exactly say.  I got the impression it was the radius around a specific system, but it's kinda secondary to the plot.   It was meant to be comparable to a flight accidentally crossing the NK border and being intercepted.   Taking only Bishop's head seems like complete plot BS. They just let the transport go home after stealing from it..... Uh..... There's no way WY will notice their android is missing.   The Koreans knew they would be discovered.  It wasn't secret, but the argument is that Bishop was confiscated as a weapon.  WY and Korea have a significant back and forth through the script arguing over the legal rights of an android.  WY says he's a citizen that needs to be returned, Korea says he's military hardware legally seized during a border infraction.  Eventually, once Korea was done downloading everything from Bishop and had collected all the spores they sent him back to WY.  He didn't have any value to them anymore so they wanted to trade him for political favor.  At the same time they knew that if he learned of the WY bio-weapon program he would try to stop it ""to preserve human life"".  Not exactly a ""sleeper agent"" but the hope he would interfere was there.   But yes, it sounds better than Alien 3 was.   Yeah it was.   On a side note, the Assembly Cut of Alien 3 was a huge improvement.  The theater release was morbidly bad, but the missing 30 minutes of dialog and character development that got readded did a lot to save the movie.  Still not as good as Alien or Aliens, but not a bad movie by itself anymore, it was ok.  If a fourth movie had been made I would have to pretend it never happened."

The ""space koreans"" as you call them(I don't actually recall them being Korean specifically in Gibson's awful script... The UPP is sort of ruso-asian though. Very communist, with an emphasis on a sort of shady-unethical soviet politics.).  You can see UPP space on the middle-right of the map. LV-426/Acheron is just one tiny system on that map, a few hyperspace jumps away.  The films have basically shunned the universe developed by novels, comics, and games, which is really unfortunate as there are a lot of good ideas, and well-thought-out concepts and storylines.

scifi,3dn30t,luaudesign,3,Sat Jul 18 06:53:56 2015 UTC,I just hope they don't let him direct it.
scifi,3dn30t,Used-Car-Salesman,11,Fri Jul 17 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Why not? He's a very good director. His scripts have been the weak point of his recent movies (and they're not even that bad, honestly). Take Elysium - it ended up being mediocre, but the direction was top notch. The action was pretty dope IMO.   By comparison, I think most JJ Abrams movies are pretty shit for the most part (with exceptions), but he's quite a good director as well. Same with M. Night and McG. Hell, Ridley Scott, the very guy who created Alien, gave us Prometheus - which again was well-directed.  I'll even say that a great story trumps a good OR bad director for the most part.   All of that aside - I question whether the world even needs another Alien movie. The logic in Hollywood seems to be, 'Hey, everyone liked X movie, right? Let's make another one!' We didn't need five Die Hards, and five Terminators, and we don't need however many Alien movies we're unofficially at depending on how you count them. And I may be in the minority here, but I think we should definitely leave Star Wars alone at this point.   Where's my film adaptation of The Forever War? Can we do that now?  To me, the problem seems to be that we are wasting good directors on lousy stories and played-out franchises."

scifi,3dn30t,JamoJustReddit,4,Sat Jul 18 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"What I am about to say is going to sound pretty cheesy.  Super 8 hit almost every beat that a classic Spielberg movie, but it lacked one thing - magic.  Told you it was going to be cheesy.  Classic Spielberg has a sort of 'movie magic' element that's hard to quantify. Abrams did a great job aping many classic Spielberg elements in Super 8, but there's just something missing there. That unquantifiable element that makes your eyes widen and leaves your jaw hanging open a little bit. A feeling of wonder, I think.   Super 8 hit the technical beats - decent kid actors behaving non-annoyingly; anamorphic lens flares, mysterious atmosphere - but that Spielbergian wonder wasn't quite there.  It would be unfair to criticize Abrams for making a film 'not as good as Spielberg', but the comparison must be drawn given that Super 8 is very obviously an attempt to make ape the formula."
scifi,3dn30t,AnticitizenPrime,3,Sat Jul 18 04:25:07 2015 UTC,"While I don't quite agree, I understand what you're saying.  I felt like the movie did have a bit of wonder, and that's why I enjoyed it.  Different strokes for different folks."

scifi,3dn30t,AnticitizenPrime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:27:50 2015 UTC,"Man, you had me until you questioned the need for another movie in the Alien Universe. When a creature like that is created, and you build such an incredibly detailed world in just two movies, I'd say that necessitates exploration.   I don't think focus on the characters is necessary (though if this movie is anywhere close to William Gibson's Alien3 treatment I would be OK with it) and you escape the feeling of a remake by placing a story in the same universe with new people to invest in. That is a successful story-telling tactic in the comic book industry, the serialization of a well-known fictional zeitgeist to tell a story within.   I think between Alien and Aliens we got enough of a universe built up through pieces of dialogue and set direction that a clever enough director could write a rom-com with xenomorphs in the mix and it could make sense. Like vampires or Cold War movies seeing a new era or style within the genre of Alien could be interesting and would get my $15 every time."

Even when the mythology starts to split into a thousand different pieces during episodes like the Biogenesis/Sixth Extinction run, there's a feeling of urgency and excitement that the MotW stories don't always generate.  The one-off MotW episodes are also some of my favorites (Pusher, Clyde Bruckman and Folie a Deux, to name a few), but it bothers me that so many of them seem to belong to a separate timeline where the mythology events never happened or were completely forgotten about. There are moments here and there where we see some character development (""the talk"" in Quagmire, basically all of Beyond the Sea), but these instances are few and far between. I'm sure that a lot of this has to do with the number of writers that worked on the show through the years...  Fringe always comes to mind when I think about this dichotomy. The first season of the show was essentially a season of MotW episodes that lifted heavily from the X-Files formula, but there was also an overarching plot (the Pattern) that linked many of them together. When Fringe shifted to a much more serial format in its second season, it became one of my favorite shows."

scifi,3dm74f,Turil,3,Sat Jul 18 06:17:15 2015 UTC,"Cypressgroove has a totally reasonable list, though I'd totally add:  S3E20: Jose Chung's From Outer Space  Utterly delightful, humorous satire of classic alien abduction stories (that used to be a big thing, but might be not so common these days).  There are a whole lot of stories that are very connected to the overall long term plot of Mulder and his sister which are fun to get into, but not necessary, I think, for understanding the new show, I imagine."
scifi,3dm74f,cypressgroove,2,Sat Jul 18 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say that depends - if you're looking for the whole 'mythos' overarching story you're probably going to need more than a day. That said, I was someone who preferred the 'monster of the week' episodes. In terms of the ones I'd always recommend to anyone I'd say you want:  S1E3 -  Squeeze & S1E21 - Tooms. (2 parter, arguably the most famous MOTW episodes)  S1E20 - Darkness Falls (Seems like a marmite episode, personally I loved it, written by Chris Carter himself)  S2E20 - Humbug (Featuring Jim Rose and The Enigma, who are real-life 'sideshow performers')  S2E23 - Soft Light (One of my favourite episodes written by Vince Gilligan, who you may know better these days for Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul)  S3E3 - D.P.O. (Jack Black costars, quite funny in places)  S3E4 - Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose (Dark humour, plus a fairly important reveal about a main character)  S3E17 Pusher and S5E8 Kitsunegari (Gilligan's best villain IMO, 2 parter in a way)  S6E21 - Field trip (Given the ending of this episode, probably a good one to end on)  Obviously tastes vary and I'm sure not everyone would agree with those choices but I tried to pick out the more memorable and unique ones from across the best seasons.  It's actually quite hard to limit to a day's worth of viewing as there were a LOT of great episodes across the seasons. Even later when they replaced Mulder and Scully there's some good ones, but you probably want to just watch it in full over a few weeks if you want to appreciate those ones.  I'm envious you're going to get to experience these all for the first time now, I think I must've watched the whole series at least 5 times over the years, it's one of the very few DVD boxsets I bought immediately upon release. Enjoy!"

It's just too good to miss, even if it's not really ""in character"" for the show. :-)  Oh, and I still have a fondness for the first episode I watched after I'd given up on the pilot (which was too scary/dark for me), which was season 2 ep 18, Fearful Symmetry, with the elephant and gorilla.

The author recounts a story his da told about wandering his college campus with a knife looking for a woman to kill.  Then the author dismisses his father's confession because he reckons his father was too much of a pussy to kill a woman.

If you did a film/show/book like that right now, it sort of wouldn't be ""sci-fi"" as in imagining things that have yet to come, using what we know as a starting point, but more like ""alternate history future"". There would simply be no reason to have CRT screens that would increase a ship's mass all the while being more inefficient when it comes to energy etc. But yes, I totally agree there very much is a charm to it."

scifi,3djpwv,superliminaldude,9,Thu Jul 16 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"I think it has the potential to be, even if it's not 'official'. There was much discussion of it around the video game Alien: Isolation because they wanted to keep that look exactly.  However, much of Cyberpunk tends to have that look in part, because Cyberpunk was largely an 80s invention. For instance the Shadowrun RPG (easy to see in to video game version Shadowrun Returns), has hackers called 'deckers' and they use these massive 'decks' that look like giant keyboard/synthesizers.  In this way it largely becomes a product of its time/an affectation rather than something deliberately 'retro' because sci-fi tends to demand things seem futuristic. There's definitely potential for it in the right medium, though."

But that's both a) The 80's and b) Connery.  But I forgive it those sins as a sign of it's time and because the movie is just so goddamned fun.  I have a special place in my heart for dirty industrial futures and sci-fi that is grounded.

It used to be a futuristic genre, but Society Marches On.   In other ways its closer to:    Raygun Gothic, aka Atompunk : (1940s - 1960s) The world of pulp sci-fi where everything from inter-galactic space ships to pens is atomic powered. The Fallout series is a great example, running on Science!   Aliens is pretty similar to Fallout's Universe.  Most computers are still analog,  and the Nostromo is probably Nuclear powered."

Think Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon. As proven by Fallout, this style works remarkably well when grunged up and destroyed.  Sidenote: What you are refering to as ""analog"" here isn't really all that analog. It's almost certainly digital, just with knobs and slides for controls. But if you just meant ""analog controls"" then that's totally cool. However! There are totally analog computer, both of mechanical and electronic variety. But the mechanical ones are cooler, and the type that fewer people know about.   They usually look like this - http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/Ordnance/FCS-Mark37/img/p43.jpg and rely entirely on gears, ball bearings, cams and the like.

Granted there was kind of Military/ working class vibe to it, but it definitely felt very sleek and advanced for the time.

To put that even more dramatically, Pluto's escape velocity is less than 500 times a typical human's jumping ability. And it should go without saying that there is no atmosphere or magnetosphere, and no solar power to speak of.  EDIT: I was wrong about the atmosphere. New Horizons has found that Pluto does have an atmosphere, though it's not one you'd be likely to find useful if you're a human. It's nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, ranging from 100,000 to one million times thinner than Earth's atmosphere (6.4 - 24 µbar; 0.65 - 2.4 Pa). These components 'rain' onto the surface. Nitrogen, the lightest of them is blowing away and into space at the rate of about 500 tons per hour.  I also note that I failed to note the considerably cold surface temperature, averaging just 44 K (-229 C). Minimum is 33 K, maximum 55 K. For those not familiar with this temperature zone, liquid nitrogen is warmer, and dry ice is three times as warm."

scifi,3dj8cc,pharmaceus,0,Fri Jul 17 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"I thought that's what the majority saw it as that at the time, an excuse, I'm probably wrong though. I didn't mean to seem uptight with my original statement, I was just stating a fact as I saw it, my apologies."
scifi,3dj8cc,Mr-Maguffin,0,Fri Jul 17 04:27:41 2015 UTC,Why do you apologize to me for being uptight?  You should apologize to everyone who read this for forcing politics (the stupid and harmful sort) into literature.  What you said is very relevant when discussing HPL as an author and a person in a discussion about history of literature. We are talking about his work. That means flying fucking fungi from Yuggoth! Speak about politics other than which Great Old One you see as ruling Earth and I am going to scoop your brain and put it in a can myself.

scifi,3djjek,Gogol1212,7,Thu Jul 16 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Pandora's Star, and it's sequel Judas Unchained!  The large cast of character's each have their own shifting POV chapters (like in ASOIAF). From page one, their stories start to get exponentially bigger and more epic!   A teaser like this one got me interested, but it's only a scratch of the plot at the beginning of the books.    The year is 2380. The Commonwealth of humanity, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds. Each interconnected, via train network, through a web of short-range wormholes.   Invented by the infamous Nigel Sheldon and Ozzie Isaacs in the 21st century, this network (and wormhole technology itself) is solely operated and owned by their company ""CST"", the largest corporate power in human history. Run, for centuries, by Sheldon himself it forms a column of the Commonwealth's political structure.  To those who can afford it, immortality has been a possibility of medical science for centuries. ""Rejuvenation"", a process which leaves the subject's body aged around 20, with adjustment made for personal preference, has reshaped the economics and philosophy of the human race. Even when threatened by the loss of their body, memory crystal implants and the ""secure store"" system enable a seamless transition between 'death' and any given human's 'next life'.   This economically driven immortality, creates a world where Intersolar Dynasties of rich and powerful families have developed. Their massive interstellar super-corporations struggle for power and control of entire worlds, as new wormholes are opened and the Commonwealth constantly expands.  At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, the aging and unimpressive Dudley Bose has used an entire lifetime to position himself perfectly in pursuit of the now ""dead science"" of Astronomy. Specifically working to solve a longstanding scientific mystery, a pair of distant stars who, without natural cause, are no longer visible to most of the Commonwealth.   Popular theory guesses that, in the distant past, they  may have been enclosed in theoretical ""Dyson Spheres"". But, while studying his long term observations, he see something impossible. Over a thousand light-years away from the Commonwealth, the first of these stars. . . vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole, or dim over the centuries as if it was artificially enclosed. It simply disappears. And moments later, so does it's twin."
scifi,3djjek,steppenwoolf,2,Fri Jul 17 01:12:02 2015 UTC,Seconded.
scifi,3djjek,daviator88,2,Fri Jul 17 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"I am about 200 pages into Pandoras Star and I'm thinking about giving up. I don't really like the prose, it feels kind of bland and reminds me a bit of old hard scifi. My biggest problem though is that everything is so terribly slow and spread between so many plots. Almost every chapter so far has been from a new POV and none of them have grabbed me. The most interesting part so far was the prologue when the captain of the Mars space ship talked about the future power struggle between Europe and the US and how the different cultures guided their progress in different directions.  Does it get any more interesting or does the pace pick up later on? Or will it just continue like this for the rest of the book? I got a lot of recommendations for this series so maybe it's just has a very slow start? I have a feeling that it might just be me not liking Hamilton's writing style at all."
scifi,3djjek,drainX,2,Fri Jul 17 12:54:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I enjoy the style change between characters  chapters. Their lives and stories branch in different ways and give different ideas and to explore as well as different insight into the plot.  Keep in mind that, in general, the two books crecendo and accelerate all the way through to the end of Judas Unchained which is a hell of a ride.  I don't want to spoil anything, it makes your questions hard to answer, but keep reading. At least finish Pandora's Star! You're less than a third through and the greater plot hasn't coalesced yet.  Events come to pass that mark a huge shifting point for all the characters. And it brings some clarity to what you have already read. It's a slow boil until then, but that gives you plenty of chances to try figure out how all these different characters are part of the same story.   If you were to pm me I would be happy to give a less spoiler free answer and be specific."
scifi,3djjek,steppenwoolf,11,Fri Jul 17 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"Describing what you liked exactly in mars trilogy, star wars and a song of ice and fire would be helpful... As it is I'll give you some hints:     Dune by Frank Herbert has the political feuds and revenge story aspect of ASOAIF, plus it's rather gritty and violent. Paul Atreides also has a lot in common with Jon Snow when I think about it. The various psychic powers reminiscent of magic might also remind you of the fantasy side of Star Wars. The Culture series  by Iain M. Banks is epic in scope and covers a lot of various and exotic alien, humanoid and AI pretty much like Star Wars. There's also political machinations a la ASOIAF."
scifi,3djjek,oneeyed2,4,Thu Jul 16 20:35:13 2015 UTC,Second both of these suggestions. May I add The Hyperion Cantos?
scifi,3djjek,Roderick111,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:44 2015 UTC,"Mars Trilogy: Hard science, and the guy knows a thing or two about politics. ASOIAF: Politics, complex argument. Star wars: the variety of alien species and their backstorys (EU) I also love that we are talking about lots of pages, I need something that can keep me entertained days, even months.   Dune is one of my favorite series ever. The Culture series seems pretty interesting, I think I will read it, thanks a lot!"
scifi,3djjek,Roderick111,5,Thu Jul 16 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"OP, you go read The Culture right now. Start with Player of Games."
scifi,3djjek,Lucas_Steinwalker,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:25 2015 UTC,I'm interested in reading them. Why start on the 2nd book?
scifi,3djjek,Roderick111,3,Fri Jul 17 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"Each book is self-contained, and Player of Games is widely considered to be the best book to start with. (I started with Excession and missed all the jokes on the first read.)"
scifi,3djjek,mapsandmusicgirl,2,Fri Jul 17 17:01:55 2015 UTC,"Player of Games was quite good. I haven't read any of the other Culture novels, but I plan on reading them. I'm just slow to actually read stuff."
scifi,3djjek,tenpastmidnight,8,Fri Jul 17 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"The Mote in God's Eye by Niven and Pournelle. It's an epic first contact story and includes politics, strange aliens, and a good dollop of action.   Leave the sequel alone though. It's OK, but nowhere near as good as Mote."
scifi,3djjek,TheDudeNeverBowls,4,Thu Jul 16 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"There was a good decade of my life when I read this book at least once a year.   Heck, I have it on my kindle app now. I don't open it often, but I'm in Dinner Party."
scifi,3djjek,GarthVolbeck,3,Thu Jul 16 22:08:19 2015 UTC,I've read it so many times and see it so vividly in my head I forget it's a book I have read/reread so many times and not a movie I've seen a bunch.
scifi,3djjek,TheDudeNeverBowls,4,Fri Jul 17 06:33:53 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way.  I've always imagined it as a mini-series.  A very high concept mini-series with a big budget. A single film wouldn't exactly capture the time it takes to tell the story.  The colonial aspect of the Second Empire would need to be made clear, as well as the cultural fear of the technology wrought in the First Empire.  Honestly, I hope it never gets made unless I can do it with a big budget but just for us fans.  What I'm saying is that if I were a billionaire I'd spend a tenth of my fortune and make the perfect ten part mini-series called The Mote in God's Eye.  You and I would love it :)"
scifi,3djjek,MotoRandom,8,Fri Jul 17 06:40:47 2015 UTC,"Hyperion and Endymion by Dan Simmons. Around 2000 pages for all four books. Grand Epic story on many planets and across huge periods of time. So many characters, so many stories, so many late nights with bleary eyes trying to absorb a little more in.   edit: corrected authors name."
scifi,3djjek,Roderick111,4,Thu Jul 16 23:10:36 2015 UTC,Dan Simmons isn't it?
scifi,3djjek,MotoRandom,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yes sir, you are correct. It's the Hyperion Cantos and I was a little challenged with all of the formatting for the hyperlinks."
