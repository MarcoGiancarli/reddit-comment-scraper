Saw this thing parked outside and the workers let me into their shop when they saw me taking pictures. Very nice people over at Palatov and they gave me an awesome tour. Yes it is fully assembled, but there is also a different shell option that covers the open wheel I believe. This is a track car that can also be driven on the street, weighs just 1900 pounds and has a 700hp LS3 engine! They also make several other track car models, one of which has even won the Pikes Peak Hill-climb unlimited class.

spotted,3dj1ms,K3R3G3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:40:04 2015 UTC,"Brake Horse Power (bhp)  This is the power output of any engine measured at the engine's flywheel. (A flywheel is a disc with teeth on it. It's connected to the rear of the engine and its purpose is for the smooth transfer of power to the transmission from the engine.)  Wheel Horse Power (whp)  Unlike bhp, whp is the power output measured at the wheels. This is the information a dyno run provides and usually reads around *15 per cent less than the power measured at the engine (bhp) - this is because power is lost in the driveline (including clutch and transmission).  *Four-wheel drive cars lose between 20-25 percent of their quoted bhp figure because of the increased friction."

Growing up with money is comfortable but you really have no idea what it means. Your friends are wealthy, everyone at your school is wealthy. When you go on vacation you stay at resorts with other wealthy people. So that's just life, you aren't really cognizant that life is any different for other people.   We had a ""fall"" period where we lost ~80% of our net worth. That was a tough time; obviously not worrying about food, it's not ""tough"" in the traditional sense-we had to sell 2/3 of our vacation houses and  downsize our main house and sell boats and shit, boo fucking hoo-but that kind of stuff inherently puts stress on relationships and feelings of failure and whatnot."

They look nothing at all like the previous generation, and it's weird to me. Look at the Mustang and Challenger, they kept their history and design cues and it worked out amazingly. Why do Nissan and Honda have to do the opposite :("
