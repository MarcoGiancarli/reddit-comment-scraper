spongebob,3e1ek7,ProblemSl0th,2,Tue Jul 21 05:30:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I think it was themysteriousmrenter that said in a spongebob review something along the lines of aiming not to disgust/annoy your viewers, but instead have them be more annoying/disgusting in theory or to other characters than they actually appear to us.  I think this is where gross out becomes bad, you shouldn't actually be trying to disgust the audience, instead, only show enough to get the idea across."

spongebob,3do0p0,Dodge_Viper2015,6,Fri Jul 17 20:53:04 2015 UTC,"What I found intriguing is the episode ""Tutor Sauce"". Mr. Krabs was willing to pay for Spongebob's ""mistakes"" and even gave his daughter Pearl some money. It was so out of character that I felt Stephen was trying to reverse the negative image Mr. Krabs had gained as an unlikeable stingy character.  Overall, it makes me think this show is on its way to improving itself significantly."
spongebob,3do0p0,shooterboss,4,Sun Jul 19 04:33:49 2015 UTC,"Well, that's who Mr. krabs was in the pre-movie seasons. He may have been greedy, but he knew what he was doing wrong (like when he sold spongebob to the flying dutchman) and tried to make amends.   EDIT: Fixed grammatical error."
spongebob,3do0p0,MichaelJahrling,5,Sun Jul 19 04:37:44 2015 UTC,"Was not a big fan of ""Lost in Bikini Bottom"". I watched it with some friends and I don't think we laughed once. ""Tutor Sauce"" was hilarious, though."
spongebob,3do0p0,Bi0Hazard64,5,Sat Jul 18 05:50:20 2015 UTC,It was definitely better than what we've been getting for the past decade or so. I also like how some of the characters returned to their former selves like squidward not being tortured for no reason and mr.krabs being a father figure for spongebob once again and not just a jerk who only cares about money (even though he tried to make $200 off spongebob) he felt like pre-movie mr.krabs.
spongebob,3do0p0,shell_in_the_ghost,4,Sat Jul 18 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously, at least mr. krabs used to know what he was doing wrong. I'm glad they're (sort of) returning him to his former self."
spongebob,3do0p0,TheTrain19,4,Sat Jul 18 20:55:24 2015 UTC,"I loved the animation! Squidward felt/move more smooth and 'squid-ish'. Spongebob's eyes were more rounded and expressive (I missed that 'frowny look' he used to sometimes make in earlier seasons). Oh and the sunrise at the begging of LIBB!! As for TS, I did enjoyed it and was refreshing seeing Mr.K supportive of spongebob, especially after being so willing to sacrifice him in the movie.

spongebob,3do0p0,WinnerOfEverything,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:54:14 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the episode but I thought the idea of it was stupid. Why would SpongeBob need a shortcut to the Krusty Krab if it is within walking distance from his house?
spongebob,3do0p0,ProblemSl0th,3,Fri Jul 17 22:33:58 2015 UTC,I actually like that part because the episode breaks the fourth wall by bringing it up several times with spongebob remaining oblivious.
spongebob,3do0p0,FistBomb060,10,Fri Jul 17 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"Although that was funny, spongebob's endless stubbornness and stupidity(seriously there is no shortcut when you're walking in a straight damn line) was not. I think it would have been more believable if he actually had to take a walk through to town to get work normally, but he doesn't, so the premise is a little contrived. I can't help but feel like they haven't returned spongebob's intelligence to him with hillenburg's return,because even though he was no genius, I can't believe he would be THIS dumb.  Some of the jokes along the way were still funny though."

With nothing but the undies underneath!) abuse finally brought down to Sponge EXPLODING WITH RAGE after all those nudges to Squid about stop slacking up. The sane and conscience core just cracked through and shone through his goofy looks, showing us that even he can have his boundaries and even he can be mad as everyone else.  Oh, and how SpongeBob dressed down Krabs afterwards hard because Eugene could not let go of Squid's (supposed) mistake down to Squid's quitting which costed everyone's lives.

spongebob,3ckeku,bigminiman12,3,Wed Jul 8 16:28:45 2015 UTC,Nope. The game was released in 3 parts.
spongebob,3ckeku,baba_944,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:07:42 2015 UTC,so there are no more than 3? ok
spongebob,3ckeku,baba_944,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:50:37 2015 UTC,Correct.
spongebob,3ckeku,nhl-mmv-gc,3,Wed Jul 8 20:52:34 2015 UTC,These menus are a little tricky.
spongebob,3ckeku,Mathistoohard,2,Thu Jul 9 01:59:39 2015 UTC,yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah
spongebob,3ckeku,CAPS_GET_UPVOTES,2,Thu Jul 9 15:02:08 2015 UTC,Did anyone ever beat that one Rock bottom game?
spongebob,3cfne9,JNisher,23,Tue Jul 7 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"I know I'm kind of ruining this, but I love that there's no comments on this, just upvotes because nothing more needs to be said"
spongebob,3cfne9,thedonuggs,7,Tue Jul 7 20:54:38 2015 UTC,OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EVIL
spongebob,3cfne9,skeddles,3,Wed Jul 8 13:51:24 2015 UTC,That's Kuro-Sensei.
spongebob,3cfne9,Rootbeer128,2,Wed Jul 8 00:35:41 2015 UTC,It's lemon scented!
spongebob,3ce5r9,JNisher,23,Tue Jul 7 05:19:42 2015 UTC,It's funny but I never got it
spongebob,3ce5r9,liamwearmouth,44,Tue Jul 7 10:19:49 2015 UTC,"In the scene before this, Patrick whistles to Sandy's bird. He ""sings like a canary"", which is what Italian mobsters would call snitching.   It's a damn good joke"
spongebob,3ce5r9,kirkom,39,Tue Jul 7 14:01:56 2015 UTC,And here I just thought it was funny because... birds don't speak Italian. That added a whole new depth to that joke.
spongebob,3ce5r9,IsaacBenning,5,Tue Jul 7 16:49:41 2015 UTC,Ooooohhhh
spongebob,3ce5r9,liamwearmouth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:48:04 2015 UTC,I thought the joke was that birds and crickets sounded similar.
spongebob,3ce5r9,BikiniBottomite,11,Thu Jul 9 16:10:46 2015 UTC,it's a reference to earlier in the episode
spongebob,3ce5r9,Toa_Ignika,27,Tue Jul 7 15:59:34 2015 UTC,Easily one of the funniest things I've ever heard on this show.

spongebob,3c8m8b,lancebtaylor,5,Mon Jul 6 03:28:47 2015 UTC,"I made these a while ago, however I could always make more. Just need a scene."
spongebob,3c8m8b,keytarin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:29:37 2015 UTC,Can you make a wallpaper of squidward live?
