North Dakota is far from a barren wasteland.   Unless it's November to March. Then just fuck it. Fuck it right in the frost bitten ear.

I needed to present a state issued copy of my birth certificate in addition to my current license to get my ND license. You have to pass a vision test like everyone else and maybe a written/driving test depending on your driving record and some medical stuff. Ironically, they didn't ask for proof of address. You have 150 days to do it."

Had to pick up some last minute supplies at Wal Mart last summer before TRNP and it was an interesting experience to say the least. Starting to get some restaurants that aren't a chain drive thru too.

northdakota,3dc19m,Fargonian,0,Wed Jul 15 21:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that a person shouldn't try to interfere with a person's life at all when, like you said, ""it involves two [or one] peoples' happiness and doesn't hurt you at all.""  It should apply based on the principle, not the subject, so when you say ""people should be equal, and certainly not equated to gun ownership,"" you're missing the point:  It doesn't matter if it's a person, gun, drug, etc, ""when it involves two [or one] peoples' happiness and doesn't hurt you at all,"" it should be left alone."

northdakota,3dc19m,CheetoX23,3,Thu Jul 16 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"Two because that is the situation we are talking about. I personally don't see an issue with multiple adults getting married. A lot of things would have to get worked out, but largely polygamists haven't expected more than being left alone and, at most, the marriages being recognized. Consenting adults is what the qualifying factor should be. I realize you are trying to dig to point out flaws, but stop being a child. If you are against people being happy, just say it, stop beating around the bush. Let's focus on this one right now, as it is literally no different than straight people being married. All can or none can; there doesn't get to be special treatment because of an archaic set of beliefs that only get half-followed at best."

Scarves and layers help too and maybe some good snow stomping boots.  Also, do not get fooled by bright blue sunny skies in the middle of winter.  That can be when it's coldest.  More challenging is winter driving if you've never driven on snow or ice.  The roads will be mostly cleared within hours of when heavy snow stops falling but there will still be ice and packed snow and sometimes limited visibility at intersections because of pile-up  snow.  You'll quickly master it but you should make certain you have good tires on your truck before winter hits and maybe throw some extra weight in the back to help with traction.  Buy a good snow scraper/window brush combination before the snow flies even if you find a place with indoor parking.  Get the truck winterized too (oil, washer fluid, etc.).  Put a winter survival kit in the car as soon as you can (blankets, first aid kit, candy bars, etc. - google what you need) because it's easy to get more than a mile from the nearest help just driving out of city proper.  Hope you like football.  People in Fargo are pretty proud of the Bison.  No one's really addressed your comment on wildlife areas.  Not exactly clear on what you're looking to find.  The bison and elk and wild horses can be found in Theodore Roosevelt NP, but that's four or five hours away to the west.  The moose and wolves and bears of northern MN and the BWCA are also about four or five hours away to the east and north.  There are a number of national wildlife refuges within a couple of hours that are great for birding and solitude.  Might not be your idea of fun, but catching the peak snow geese migration in spring at Sand Lake NWR in SD or Tewaukon NWR in ND is an amazing experience - hundreds of thousands of snow geese, canada geese, brandts along with other migrating birds in the air or in the fields or on the lakes at the same time.  If you want to explore country roads, recommend doing that in the spring, summer or fall.  Can do that during winter too, it's just a little more treacherous so be prepared.    A few ND recommendations for you, though some are quite the drive and more than a day trip - Sheyenne River Scenic Byway, Pembina Gorge, Sullys Hill National Game Preserve, Tewaukon and Sand Lake and other nearby NWR, International Peace Gardens, Bismarck with the Capitol and Heritage Center and Ft Lincoln SP across the river south of Mandan, and certainly Theodore Roosevelt NP.  Lots to explore in MN too but, again some are pretty long drives and maybe more than a day trip.  Drive around the lake country in the Detroit Lakes/Pelican Rapids area. Go to Itasca State Park and walk across that little river that empties out in the Gulf there by Louisiana. Duluth is great as is the North Shore in Minnesota.  Go to Mpls/STP on a weekend for some big city life and professional sports, if you miss that.  If you stay in the area during the summer, definitely consider a roadtrip to Badlands NP and the Black Hills of SD (Wind Cave NP, Custer SP, Jewel Cave NM, Mt Rushmore, Crazy Horse, etc.)."

northdakota,3bvrq2,QP2012,2,Thu Jul 2 15:50:51 2015 UTC,"As someone also from the south (Tennessee originally), I will let you know there is a totally different culture here.  People will find you charming, annoying, and some will even find you stupid solely based on your accent. Be prepared for that. Also be prepared for some weirdo racist stuff. Down south if someone is racist they will be straightforward about it, which still is racist but they are at least honest about it. Here there are less racists but they are also less forthright about it, so you might be North Dakota Niced, which isn't so nice.   So that's the bad. The good is that people are less nosey, and will quietly help out those in need. If your car gets stuck in the snow, you can always count on someone pulling in behind you, saddling up behind your car, and motioning you to hit the gas. Then they will leave without saying a word, before you even have a chance to thank them. People here really do take the paying it forward thing to heart and do it because it is the right thing to do. I have rarely found people in North Dakota to be showy, but have almost always found them to be willing to do the right thing simply because it is right. The rugged individuality of people from here runs deep, but so does the willingness to help. People here are generally harder to make friends with, but once you make those friends they are really strong friendships.   The culture is way different. You have no idea, and someone on the internet can't truly prepare you. My only suggestion is to get used to the idea of not calling people sir or ma'am :)"

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

Legend has it that two brothers, along with their mother, lived on the farm. Like many farmers of that time, they didn't trust banks. Instead, they stashed all of their savings away in a milk can, which they buried near the barn. One day, the brothers took to fighting. In anger, one brother grabbed a shotgun and shot the other. When he realized what he had done, he did himself in as well. The mother, saddened and embittered by the loss of her sons became a recluse, firing a rocksalt-loaded shotgun at anyone who tried to come check on her. She eventually passed away.

Yes, it sucks that things like this happen.  The industry tries it's best to avoid things like this, and by-and-large, they do a good job.    Taking a few incidents and ignoring the benefits makes it easy to make a blanket judgement like you made.  I would guess that you probably had some bias against the oilfield before they moved in though.  Not meaning to stir anything up.  Just sharing my thoughts.  Have a good day."
northdakota,353emj,Khatib,3,Thu May 7 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"ND was financially ahead because of their state bank before oil ever started booming again though.   That's not to say the boom hasn't had it's benefits, but the state has bent over backwards on regulations to ""keep the oil companies here"" when they aren't going fucking anywhere because the oil isn't either."
northdakota,353emj,Swichblade,3,Thu May 7 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"Really the big incidents like this are just part of it.  The reason I dislike the oilfield is how much it has changed the state.  My town has changed a bunch, more new houses have sprung up in the last 5 years than the last 10 before it.  A church closed and sold the building for oilfield housing.  The fault is also on people like that, that sold out to the oilfield, only caring about money.  I love North Dakota and the small towns because when I'm there I don't have to worry about the rest of the world, and the rest of the world pays me no mind.  Ever since the oilfield came, its like the world has been forcing its way in."
northdakota,353emj,cheezneezy,3,Thu May 7 19:55:27 2015 UTC,Oil is not good. Please explain these benefits you talk about. besides making a couple even more wealthier then they already are and having gas prices drop a little sometimes.

And she did not take measures to prevent a new birth (rape excluded) so she kinda brings this on herself. I have no issue in abortion due to rape or medical need (life in danger) but also concede that those are unfair to the child as well. Fortunately abortions for those reasons are quite rare.

northdakota,34hae9,59179,-6,Tue May 5 14:25:45 2015 UTC,Yes. Because putting human life on the same level as insects is normal. You lose this argument because you are so far off kilter right off the gate.

Also, most of those deaths were traffic fatalities, which would only be worse in North Dakota than other places because of the icy roads during the winter, and the fact that routes 2, 22 and 85 are inadequate for all the oilfield traffic. At least the the Watford City bypass will help ease the congestion a little.   Pure sensationalism."
northdakota,34d4qi,MacAnthony,3,Thu Apr 30 06:00:34 2015 UTC,"Partially this is a statistical anomaly. The story says ""56 workers killed on the job in 2013"" but that 84 out of every 100k people die in the oil/gas industry. That means there aren't even 100k people working in the industry. They have to inflate the numbers to match the scale.   To exaggerate this (by a lot), if 1 of 5 people had something happen and you inflate that to a scale of 100k, you would have to say that 20,000 people out of 100,000 experienced whatever you are tracking.  As an example, if there are only 10,000 people working in the industry, that 84/100000 rate is only 8 people.  Given that, leading this statistic 3 years in a row is a concerning trend."

The state is facing a huge downturn in revenues because of the current tax triggers, and Republicans are using this as an opportunity to lower the overall rate while they remove the trigger.  That means greater than baseline revenues now in exchange for lower revenues over the long run.  It also means there is no more built in tax incentive for drilling during low prices, but it increases the predictability of state revenues."

I've heard friends talk about going there too. If you head out there you might as well head over across the state line to Wibaux, MT and check out Beaver Creek Brewery- really nice place. Limited opening times though (I think it's just afternoon/evenings Thursday-Sunday). Also near here would be a hike around Sentinel Butte.  30 minutes out of town in the same direction is Medora and the badlands. Medora is fine, kind of lame in it's insistence on creating a contrived ""family atmosphere"" but the badlands and theodore roosevelt national park is spectacular and worth several day trips. Your car pass to get into the park will be good for a few days so may as well plan to use it a few days out of the week.  I'm going to second Wildcat as best pizza in town, and Bernie's as the best bar in town. I like it because big cities have fake dive bars, and this is 100% the real deal. They'll never re-create the vibe. More dance-y/hip-hop-y Liquid Assets or Army's over the weekend. If you want fancy cocktails and a fine dining experience- Brickhouse. If you want a sports bar w/ patio- Players/Sanfords.  Coffee shop- best coffee is Expresso (the owner knows his shit and is particular about the science/roasting/general background another bonus it's near the aforementioned taco truck), best atmosphere tho The Brew (converted church, chill)  I feel like I have tolerating living here down to an art. I couldn't have done it without an amazon prime membership though."

northdakota,32xhel,Creeping_Death,4,Fri Apr 17 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"I just gotta vent on this a little. I work for NDSU's IT Division. I don't know who these ""technology experts"" are that said it was unlikely they were automatically deleted, because the evidence is pretty clear. The huge smoking gun is the fact that the deletion of those messages happened 30 days to the day from when the University System turned on the 30-day auto delete function for all NDUS email. This policy automatically permanently deleted all messages that had been in the Deleted Items folder for 30 days or more. I have no doubt that the president of NDSU had deleted over 40,000 messages since he started. There was no policy in place that said he could not delete messages, since that normally only means they are moved to the Deleted Items folder. This was also a major reason behind NDSU moving to its own email tenant, rather than staying on the NDUS one.  The second major piece of evidence is Outlook. Have they ever used Outlook? Do you know what would happen if you tried to delete 40,000 messages at once? Outlook would crash so hard. There is also no way he did them in chunks, that would take forever and the messages were all removed with the same timestamp. Even if Outlook could handle deleting 40,000 messages at once, their timestamps of deletion would vary a little because it would not happen simultaneously.  I can't believe that this made front page news again. I don't know the details on why Franzen was fired, and maybe it was injustly, but making the claim that Breciani intentionally deleted those messages is definitely not the route to take. There is just no way he did."

It's in North Dakota's best interests to at the very least give the impression that there's a very rigorous rail safety and inspection program in-state. We need to be seen as taking rail safety VERY seriously.   ND is dependant on oil trains being able to travel unimpeded to their destinations - it wouldn't be good for us if some states (like Minnesota and Illinois) used congressional, federal power, or other types of leverage to impose restrictions and inspections on those trains. At that point who knows what they would impose, and who knows how easily the oil could get to market and at what cost.  If we have a rigorous inspection program, we can deflate many of their arguments that there needs to be separate safety/inspection programs, and keep the cards in our hands.  ND is going to want to be able to provide firm and convincing answers if the ""big wreck"" occurs in an urban area."

No, but I must have missed the memo that life is.  Furthermore, If I were to come out and did face discrimination, I would handle it myself instead of crying for government protection.

northdakota,314iu6,MrTomAce,13,Thu Apr 2 03:09:46 2015 UTC,That's because the gay community is extremely closeted in this unwelcoming community.

He's afraid of what would happen if he comes out. Meanwhile, across town, a woman has run a business for decades with her girlfriend and nobody cares, as well they shouldn't, because they do good work. I'm firmly of the belief that the smartest and best way for gay people to be accepted in western ND is for them to just be who they are without putting themselves on some sort of ""pride"" pedestal. Just be. Like everyone else. That, my friends, is equality."
northdakota,314iu6,callmepersnickety,6,Thu Apr 2 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean that it doesn't happen. There are no methods to report discrimination right now apart from crying foul to the media, which isn't really the best option given how you'd be outing yourself to everyone--family, friends, potential employers and landlords. It's also a very difficult thing for gay people to talk about. We live in a state where people hold strong to their religious values and perpetuate the sentiment that homosexuality is wrong. I struggled for a long time with my sexuality because of the way people would--and since--have treated me different. It's incredibly insensitive for someone to generalize that discrimination doesn't exist or even demand examples of it when they themselves are not the class experiencing the discrimination. Sexuality is complicated and speaking up about it in a very public manner is even more challenging. North Dakota has the lowest LGBT population in the US (Gallup) for a reason: they don't feel safe or accepted."
northdakota,314iu6,ohchristworld,-2,Thu Apr 2 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"But at the same time you're generalizing discrimination in a sense that because it has happened to you to some degree, it happens everywhere to every gay person. I'm glad we've had this discussion so I can see the other side of things and please let it be known that I'm on your side when it comes to gay marriage. I'm gonna vote for it if it ever comes up in ND (which may be a while). But I'm also a big believer in democracy. I believe that if we put elected officials in place to vote on something, then it's their job to vote on it as they believe their constituency would wish it to be voted on. That's why people are upset. Because they know it's not going to pass because of how conservative the House is. But isn't that how it's supposed to work. You may not like it. It may not be a perfect result in your eyes, but that is our system and its the best in the world."
northdakota,314iu6,callmepersnickety,2,Thu Apr 2 06:04:01 2015 UTC,"Nowhere did I say that discrimination is happening to every gay person, I'm saying that when it does happen to them, there are certain factors that would prohibit most of them from speaking up. Additionally, marriage will likely be decided by the Supreme Court; same-sex marriage bans violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment by excluding a group of people from marriage.   The US is a democratic republic, not simply a democracy; this system is designed so the interests of minorities aren't drowned out by sheer majority rule."

northdakota,314iu6,ohchristworld,-6,Thu Apr 2 04:27:19 2015 UTC,"The reason why drilling companies are is because they know the guys who they hire are. They're not exactly the best people of this world. (Cyclone anyone?) So, of course they're scared to hire qualified, capable gay men when they can't control what is going to happen to them on site.   Bigotry exists, yes. But in this country, those guys have the right and freedoms to be bigoted assholes just like the gay guy has the right to enjoy fucking assholes. Does it make it right? No. But we cannot be thought police either. We have to move forward as a nation naturally. We can't force shit down people's throats and tell them to like it. Nations have tried that. It fails.   Western ND is, as a whole, much more tolerant than we are made out to be.

northdakota,314iu6,ohchristworld,-3,Thu Apr 2 04:15:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's play devils advocate.   Why, if you're gay, would you WANT to work for a company that isn't accepting of your lifestyle? Why would you want to force them to be accepting of it, by law, when you know they're not? Why not apply at companies who are equal opportunity employers on a national/international level and have sexual orientation discrimination rules written into their company bylaws already?   I work in a gay-friendly industry and have worked with gay people. Only once has there been a problem. One guy sucked at his job so bad he had to be fired. It was for the betterment of the entire company that he be let go. He was never once legitimately discriminated against at work. That said, though he was a good person, many people didn't like him solely because he was bad at his job, didn't seem to care about his job and his work reflected poorly on the entire group. Because some people didn't like him because of this, he could have easily taken a ""it's because I'm gay, isn't it,"" response and tried to sue the company. Even though there was proof he was terrible at his job, what would have stopped him from doing that had this law been in place? My company would have looked bad from the outset because we fired the gay guy who people didn't like at the office, when in fact he was just shitty at his job and got the boot just like every other person who was shitty at their job in our company."
northdakota,314iu6,callmepersnickety,2,Thu Apr 2 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"You could use that argument for other protections as well. Mr. Lutheran over here wasn't doing so great at his job, so he got fired because of his performance. Mr. Lutheran misinterpreted it as being because of his beliefs, so he's suing his employer.

northdakota,314iu6,killerklaws,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:22:23 2015 UTC,Any employer worth their salt and who doesn't have their head up their ass clearly documents performance issues. Mr. Lutheran wouldn't sue if his employer has a stack of written warnings and corrections.

You want articles? I don't have that, only personal experience from having a gay best friend. I'm not talking the ""oh no someone called you a fag, better cry for help!"" pc bullshit. Here's one for you: My friend has the same job for six years, he's not Mr. superworker, but he's not a jerkoff either, he did what he was hired to do and did it well. So we're at the bar shooting the shit after work, him, his boyfriend, and me. Boss shows up, sees us sitting at the bar and comes over. Introductions are made, friends boyfriend puts his hand on my friends knee after shaking hands with his boss. Boss says ""this your boyfriend or something?"" my friend says yeah, it is. Boss says ""oooh I see, well goodnight"" and walks away. Next day my friend shows up for work and is told by the manager he is no longer employed there. Why? The boss said the job wasn't a good fit for him anymore and he should move on. Boss won't talk to him in person and has is manager do all the trigger work. Now that's some coincidence right? Must be I guess. Guy hires my friend, has him work for six years, gives him raises and benefits and then after these six years finally figures out ""hey this guy isn't a good fit for the job!"" after learning the previous night he's gay.  So should my friend have asked at the interview right off the bat: Do you have a problem with gays? Or should the Boss said ""hey I hope your not gay, because although you're qualified, it's just I don't like fags, so tough break."" It shouldn't matter. My friend is not out right gay, meaning you meat the guy and you have no idea, he doesn't talk about it just as I don't go around talking about being straight. Who fucking cares? His old employer's business has no apparent stance on any political or social issue stated or otherwise inferred, it's a business not a debate floor, it provides a service not an opinion. I don't have to go into an interview and ask my perspective employer if they have a problem with Lutherans because I don't have to worry about it, because I can't be fired for being Christian, not that it can't happen, but I at least have the privilege of having that protection extended to me by grace of the law. Plus to ask such a question during an interview would make it seem like I was crazy or looking for a problem right out the door. If I made it a point to make it an issue than I'd fire me too for disruption and creating an uncomfortable work place. If my friend got fired for talking about being gay all the time and making the place uncomfortable then fuck him, he would deserve to get fired for not shutting up, but he never did nor did he ever say anything about his sexual orientation at work. But it's okay after all, he's just a fag afterall."

northdakota,314iu6,bisonhmr,-3,Thu Apr 2 13:52:26 2015 UTC,Uber-baptist? Like 0.4% of religious people in this state are Baptist.

northdakota,30j804,sabresword00,4,Fri Mar 27 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"I would recommend living off campus. Housing is pretty cheap arond here, i pay 375 a month have one roommate and an extra room. I have never used public transportation but i know the busses run to the campus pretty regularly. I would advise a car though, depending on where you choose to live. Plenty of bike paths if you are into that kind of thing. 4 golf courses, a disc golf course plenty of bars. We have one of the better snow plow services in north dakota, so a car would be fine, thats what i drive."
northdakota,30j804,MFJones88,3,Fri Mar 27 21:10:18 2015 UTC,"I read on here that some people were saying you NEED a engine heater, remote starter, and 4wd. Do you find that at all accurate?"

northdakota,30j804,sosuhme,5,Fri Mar 27 22:18:24 2015 UTC,"People use hyperbole. As long as your car battery is good and you can park in doors, you should be fine most of the time. Keep a pair of jumper cables around just in case.  4wd isn't necessary in town, but you WILL want to drive extra cautiously during the winter without it.  Also, pssshhhh... Autostart is great if you can afford it, but by no means a must have. I'm 29 and I've never had it. I'm getting it for my wife before next winter, but it will probably be a few years before I get it for myself."
northdakota,30j804,joebothree,3,Fri Mar 27 22:21:25 2015 UTC,Is it common for apartments to have indoor parking? Around here only the nicest apartments have garage parking
northdakota,30j804,b6passat,3,Fri Mar 27 22:33:51 2015 UTC,Parking garages are usually sufficient. They keep the car from being directly exposed and are usually a few degrees warmer than actually being outdoors.

northdakota,30j804,sergeanttips,3,Fri Mar 27 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"UND Grad. A decent ONE BR apartment will be around $600-$800.  You can get anywhere in the town within 15 minutes so don't worry about living off campus. In fact, I would recommend it. The prices will be much cheaper. You should have a car."
northdakota,30j804,sergeanttips,3,Sat Mar 28 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"I live in Grand Forks and I'm originally from Johnstown.  It's much colder here than back in PA.  It can sometimes reach -30 Amber temp and -70 with windchill.   I don't have a block heater but did invest in a remote starter.  The cost for housing is quite high for this area.  This is due to the current status of the economy in ND which is currently doing real good.  The area's crime is significantly lower than Johnstown.  The people here are quite friendly.   If you have any questions,  PM me."
northdakota,30j804,ddn4t,3,Sat Mar 28 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"What grad school did you get into?  I went to UND School of Law and would be happy to answer any questions if that's the one you're going for.  I know there's a lot of grad programs, but just in case that's the one.  My husband went there for his Masters in Math.  When I lived there, the place I liked living the most was an apartment just a little south of Gateway drive.  They were cheap and a little slummy, but reasonably priced and pretty close to campus.  They had no common hallway, just a door from your apt. to the outside which I really liked.  And they allowed cats.  This was 2006-2007 btw.  My husband, then boyfriend lived way down by 36th ave south and it was really really inconvenient.  His apt. was a studio and crazy cheap, but it was also really small and really far away from campus."
northdakota,30j804,sergeanttips,3,Sat Mar 28 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"It's the School of Aerospace Sciences, which seems weird, because the program specifically I'm in is in Environmental Management. I'd love to hear any advice about the school your willing to share.  I've never really been to ND at all so I'm not really familiar with street names or anything,so I guess I should just start looking for places near the school and go from there. Sounds like I'm gonna have a car now, so that gives me some flexibility."
northdakota,30j804,ddn4t,6,Mon Mar 30 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said it's getting to be almost 10 years since I've been there and I live in Maine now so if I give information about anything that's changed hopefully someone else will correct me.  One thing you might notice about Grand Forks is that sometimes there is a weird smell.  North of the campus is a potato processing plant called Simplot, they make fries and other frozen potato products.  Sometimes it stinks, but not all the time.  Make sure you go to a hockey game at least once.  When I went there I actually only did get to go once and I don't follow hockey and I had the best time.  The atmosphere was really intoxicating.  When I went there a new movie theater had just been built in East Grand Forks (the Minnesota side) and it was really cool.  The Cuckoo's Nest (bar) used to do trivia in the early evening and you could win free movie tickets.  I would be surprised if they still did, but you never know.  Valley Dairy is a chain of gas stations, not an actual dairy.  Great Wall Buffet used to be the best chinese restaurant in town, but people have told me that it got bad.  I have no idea of the current status.  Maybe someone else could shed some light on that one.  That's all I've got for right now.  I'm originally from ND and grew up about an hour away and I enjoyed my time in grad school there.  Good luck!"

northdakota,30j804,theayylien,3,Sat Mar 28 02:07:00 2015 UTC,"Since I have lived there now for about 6 years, i'll give you some updates on this little ol' town.   Simplot still stinks  The Ralph still has an amazing atmosphere and now has Red Pepper locations inside (new this season) River Cinema (the movie theatre on the east GF side) has expanded...and expanded. It takes up most of that little mall now and has somewhere near 20 screens now. The Cuckoo's Nest is unfortunately closed for business. On the EGF side, restaurants like Whitey's is still around along with The blue moose. For /u/sabresword00, there are a bunch of cool bars and new restaurants in downtown Grand Forks and on the other side of the river in East Grand Forks.  There are even more Valley Dairy locations now Great Wall Buffet is still open and have never actually been there, but I much prefer China Garden. They are my go-to for Chinese.    Other Things   The campus is now completely surrounded by apartment buildings, many built in the past 5 years. For some reason (i'm guessing oil field workers somewhat), in the past 14 months, there are about 10 new hotels and 3 new apartment buildings along 42nd street south of demers. (it is no longer a stretch of road with nothing but the Alerus Center on it) The law library is getting an expansion put on it. It is actually near completion. Wilkerson hall is also getting completely redone as well. Both projects are looking really nice and i'm kind of excited to see what they end up looking like.   Purely for /u/sabresword00    Take your idea of cold weather and throw it out the window. The winters here tend to be harsh, unforgiving, and extremely cold due to the Red River dragging down cold air from Canada. A lot of buildings on campus, though, are connected through tunnels or skyways including many of the atmospheric sciences buildings on the edge of campus. On behalf of the University of North Dakota (I work for UND Athletics), welcome to our school. I wish you the best in your journey for your masters degree."

northdakota,2y5119,CampBenCh,3,Sat Mar 7 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"Native here living in my home town again. My job has changed my personality. I'm more skeptical of new people, but can see thru bullshit easier. I am much less social than my time in other areas because of the skepticism. As a night worker with no schedule, I can't plan a weekend. I can't join a pool or softball league. This means I have a tough time keeping contact with friends. Many just come and go. Even if I have a day off, they don't think to call me because chances are I'm at work or sleeping. 12 hour days don't allow for much socializing either. I rarely see my family, miss most holidays, and if I can make it to paddle fishing weekend it's not even worth buying a tag because it'll be night time or I'm on call and inevitably get called. There are also no women my age group to date really. This causes lonliness. My physical health has suffered as well, I've gained weight, I drink way more. I'm too tired at the end of the day to work out. I've also been involved in a few accidents that have affected my hand use. My knees are gone to the point I can't go jogging, but I can ride bicycle well. My feet and ankles ache constantly probably due to aggravating previous injuries.  Plus sides. My home is almost paid off. I own outright several vehicles, but never bought a snowmobile or atv. I have had the ability to say, I want that, and buy it, within reason. I have bought many adult toys like guns etc. The friends I've held onto are good friends, but like the boom they will slowly fade with it. I've also been able to accomplish some of my dreams like travel the usa by car. I'll finish the lower 48 this year. I've met lifelong friends on these journeys as well.  I've considered leaving the oilfield for a lesser paying 9-5 job like I had before. It allowed for more personal happiness and the ability to socialize. Leaving would mean moving away from all of my immediate family again, but would also increase the possibility of finding a mate.   This isn't meant to be a sob story by any means, I can leave at any time. But it's the good and the bad from a single guy prospective that grew up here."

I do have a soft spot for the NW though because its my home. I grew up in Tioga, ND and it goes make me sad that I can't just go home and see the city I left. My mom worked at the hospital there and now works in a group home. She has trouble making ends meet since her wage isn't really competing with oil-related jobs. Mostly the cost of food and gas are the problem since the house is near paid off. I'm thankful that she isn't living in a car or another make-shift home.  Other than that, the price of gas sucks up there. There are a lot of great people that have moved to the area, and a lot of people that aren't so great. Really its how you decide to evaluate your situation. Tioga now has a normal sized grocery store! One with more than two check-outs! Its great! I wouldn't mind not hearing police chases by my window every night, or the life-flight helicopters going out at all hours of the day/night. We don't have mineral rights, land, or a sand pit so we aren't seeing any money coming to us.  It's an experience that we need to get used to.

You won't get many pro oil answers here due to the liberal bias of this sub but fracing is the best thing to happen to that state in a long damned tim .   I'm a week late to this, but this guy speaks like a true oil boomer.  HE loved the boom because he got to come here and make some money, and then bail on the state.  It's not a liberal bias.  It's the bias of people who live here or grew up around here, and understand that people are going to continue living here.  And it's a very rural area that's booming, so if you ruin the environment, there goes farming and cattle grazing.  It's also the ""rougher"" country of the state, speaking in terms of terrain.  So it's the area that tends to be slightly more scenic, with national parks and grasslands that are being drilled right up against, and with companies seeking to drill IN them, which has a fairly high chance of ruining portions of them.  Of course the guy who came in, cashed out and moved away right away thinks it's just fine to have shit regulations and shit all over the environment.  He doesn't give a fuck about the state or the long term residents, so he sees low regulation as a plus, because he can make more money faster.  He says if not for family, he'd have stayed.  If he really loved it, he could probably get his family to relocate.  We have low unemployment across the state.  You can get plenty of jobs here outside the oil industry, in places that aren't as rough or crowded as the boomtowns.  He also has no sense of history.  That part of the country had a huge oil boom in the late 70s.  It then went bust.  A lot of local residents and families got burned kind of hard when that happened.  It's why there's been a lot of wariness and reluctance to jump right into building the infrastructure up for this boom.  North Dakota has been there before, and seen how it can go ""wrong.""  Given the Saudis tanking oil prices in the last few months, there have already been huge layoffs by major fracking companies, and I was just out there for my job (not oil related, and I live on the east side of the state) in December, and again last week -- and things are noticeably slower in only a few months time lapse.  Hell, my hotel room -- exact same room size at the exact same hotel, was down $50 a night from $210 to $160.  The boom has ended.  It's dying already.  It wasn't a great thing for that area of the state.  It was a great thing for people who got to come in, grab cash, and run away.  And fuck those people.  And that's why a bunch of locals aren't big on the boom.  We get it, the extra money is nice, but a TON of that money goes out of state anyways.  Oil taxes are something like 5% of the state's income.  The real reason the state is doing so well financially is the state owned, socialist bank, Bank of North Dakota.  It reinvests tax money with a specific agenda towards growing business in the state, better educating the kids who grow up here, and then taking the profits from those investments and rolling them back into the state. In every other state, all those investments and interest from tax payments, etc, go into private banks and away from the state. We had a surplus here before oil ever started booming again."

By noticeable I mean you can't drive anywhere without seeing at least 10 ""now hiring"" in the west half of the state.   With that also came more crime though. ND now has one of the fastest growing crime rates and considering how safe ND felt before, it's a damn shame. The state is nothing like it was ten years ago and in my opinion the change has been for the worse. I moved out of Bismarck 3 years ago to go to school and I have turned down job offers in Bismarck/Mandan because it doesn't feel like home anymore and I don't plan on going back. Yes, the oil brings in good money for the state but it's not like the average North Dakotan feels the impact for the better."
northdakota,2y5119,green_glasses,0,Fri Mar 6 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"North Dakota does not have one of the fastest growing crimes rates.  Yes, it has risen along with the population increase, but as a whole, the majority of North Dakota is as safe as it ever was."
northdakota,2y5119,SayOw,2,Fri Mar 6 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know how many people would describe the area as safe as it ever was because that's just not true.    Thus, although the Bismarck MSA saw a 92 percent increase in violent crimes between 2009 and 2013, as reported by 24/7 Wall St., Bismarck saw a more modest increase of 24 percent, according to data provided by the UCR.   A 24% increase is quite a bit and to ignore the surrounding areas is foolish since not everyone lives in Bismarck. A 92% increase in violent crimes is not to be taken lightly. Saying that this isn't relevant because it's including areas outside Bismarck is just arguing semantics.  I have many female friends that won't go to Walmart alone after dark anymore."
northdakota,2y5119,Ijustsaidfuck,2,Fri Mar 6 17:00:12 2015 UTC,But when they include the data from the Indian Reservation and say that is part of the Bismarck Metro is also ridiculous.

Making at least $15 an hour at Taco John's is nothing to scoff at and they still have trouble filling the positions.  The crime rate is an unfortunate side effect of population growth so it makes sense that with the boom comes an increase in crime. Many people speculate that this is because most of the influx of population is from out of state, the area is losing a bit of that ""North Dakota nice"" attitude that we and Minnesota like to boast so much about."

northdakota,2y5119,FateIsKing,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:11:14 2015 UTC,"Gas is a bi-product of oil extraction. The oil exploration and development has driven the economic progress in the region. The wages in other industries have had to adjust (upward) to accommodate the competition from oil related industries. The interesting thing to examine is historical prices for accommodation, whether home purchase or rental prices, and there adjustment over the boom.  The population pressure on existing dwellings and the subsequent market response to capitalize on it are remarkable. [4 years working in the region]"
northdakota,2y5119,dustballer,2,Sat Mar 7 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"Majority of Jobs are your general work jobs like wal-mart or fast food. They've had to bump the starting wage in many places to even get people.   Crime seems to have gone up proportional to how many more people we have, add to the fact that all we ever hear about are fights around the strip clubs in Williston, it seems rather one sided. Don't forget the fact that women are no largely outnumbered and many don't feel safe. My cousins that live in Williston don't go out after dark that much anymore just because of getting hassled by the rough necks.  Also think about the older generation. There are many retirees that had planned on living out their lives in small town North Dakota. Now rent has skyrocketed and many of them can't afford to even live in their own hometown on a pensioners budget anymore."

northdakota,2xwtnj,jarrettwold,9,Thu Mar 5 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"With rights come a certain amount of responsibility. Being a police officer also comes with responsibilities and expectations. This was not a simple personal conversation regarding the officer's personal business. This was in semi-public forum discussing a police matter. If you're a cop talking about police matters in a public setting, even if you're off-duty on your own Facebook page, you are a spokesperson for and representative of the department for which you work. The person to whom the officer was responding was probably being an asshole, but posting something like telling somebody to ""hang urself"" is staggeringly unprofessional, immature and unbecoming of an officer of the law. Acting like a childish asshole in response makes the officer and his department look foolish and reckless at a time when police across the nation are facing increasing public scrutiny for their perceived ability to act with impunity.   This is not a free speech issue. It's a judgement issue.   He, and many cops, need to learn how to exercise it. Freedom of speech is not a license to act like an idiot. This was a case where it would have been better to just keep his mouth shut. Not to mention the fact that there was a Fargo police officer who did kill himself in relatively recent history. Maybe he could have thought about the fact that suicide is pretty serious.  tl,dr: Not simply a free speech issue"

It's slightly more common in rural areas. It's more common in the Eastern half of the state (as the accent is more based on the stereotypical Minnesota accent). There are certain words where it's unavoidable. Boat, soda, and Minnesota are good examples. Anything with that hard O sound. But it's no where near as noticeable as a Canadian accent in that respect.  I grew up in and spent most of my life in Fargo. I lived in Philly for a year during college. Most people had no idea I had an accent unless I said a small list of specific words. Actually, it was colloquial language that gave me away more often (saying ""pop"" or occasionally dropping an oof-dah bomb)."
northdakota,2xu10h,sosuhme,16,Wed Mar 4 05:33:07 2015 UTC,"Not accurate at all. The movie has one scene in Fargo, the rest of it is in Minnesota. It's a slightly over exaggerated Minnesotan accent."

northdakota,2xu10h,dustballer,2,Wed Mar 4 05:26:31 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, that accent isn't heard very often in Fargo. It's an exaggerated version of the accent that mostly older people in small towns in northern Minnesota have. Fargo is a mid-sized city in North Dakota.

If you're into Geocaching there are plenty in the state, as well as quite a few Munzees if thats your thing. Since you like sausages, Wurst Bier hall in Fargo has some pretty good brats and sausages. In Grand Forks, you might want to check out the Farmers Market in the summertime. I know you said you didn't care for sports, but either Fargo or Grand Forks would have a hockey game.  Its a cultural experience and they've got some pretty good food. Medora has a musical in the summertime that would be neat to see. As far as your list from #2, Spending a Night on a Reservation would probably fall under #4, Places to Avoid.

northdakota,2xn94n,knoxjimbo,6,Mon Mar 2 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"I would recommend stopping by the Heritage Center in Bismarck. Lots of cool dinosaur bones, and interesting Native American artifacts as well as interesting things about the state's history.  Would also recommend eating at the Blarney Stone while you are here in town too. And if you want a giant greasy burger, Bob's. The Belle Mehaus also has some good shows every once in awhile - might want to check it out."

northdakota,2xn94n,FunctionalHuman,3,Mon Mar 2 13:30:32 2015 UTC,"Check out Section9 cyber cafe in downtown Fargo for gaming. I never got a chance to check it out myself but my brother went a few times. They have games there you can play at an hourly rate I believe.   Also in Fargo, go to Krolls Diner and get knoephla soup (potatoes and dumplings). A trip to North Dakota is not complete without trying it.  IIRC, there's a themed hotel on the enchanted highway that looks like a small castle.  I prefer the East Grand Forks store, but anywhere you see a Cabelas, they generally have a big taxidermy display that's always interesting to check out.  Hope you enjoy your trip!"
northdakota,2xn94n,knoxjimbo,4,Mon Mar 2 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you like taxidermy, visit Cabela's in East Grand Forks.  There are over a hundred beautifully preserved trophy animals.  In my opinion, the Myra Museum is rather boring in comparison."

northdakota,2xn94n,twoVices,3,Mon Mar 2 13:18:03 2015 UTC,"Second this, as a native to Jamestown, this is the best spot for Knoephla soup. They only offer it on certain days, so I would call ahead to find out which day."
northdakota,2xn94n,frozen_heaven,5,Mon Mar 2 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"On your way between Devils Lake and Grand forks, about 20 miles west and 10 miles north, there is a small town called Gilby.

northdakota,2xn94n,bisonhmr,4,Mon Mar 2 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"The reservations in ND could be avoided, but mostly because they aren't whimsical or ""keeping up the traditions"" of their respective tribes.  There ARE pow wows and other kinds of native American celebration, but I'm not sure if you'll find any in May.  When I was young, I  visited Ft. Mandan.  There were examples of the military fort as well as an earthen hut.  I found an antique nail on one of the foot paths there.    I'd also suggest the Heritage Center in Bismarck.  It's a great museum with lots to see."
northdakota,2xn94n,chobette,4,Mon Mar 2 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"Go to the Heritage Center and the State capitol building while in Bismarck. The Heritage Center just had a huge renovation and expansion and will give you a good overview of the history of the state. Mandan (just across the river from Bismarck) has a shop on Main St that has hand made art and crafts from local tribes. There is also Ft. Lincoln State Park that has a recreation of the old fort that Custer road out of on his way to Little Big Horn.  They also have a recreation of a Mandan Indian village.  Friend's Family Restaurant in Mandan is a good place to get local German food.  I suggest catching a rodeo if you can during your visit.  Even a small one in a small town can be a lot of fun!   While out West:  In Dickinson, see the Dinosaur museum.  In Watford City, eat at Outlaw's.  In Williston, The Williston has great food.  If you get a chance to, go by the International Peace Gardens (North of Rugby, along the Canadian border).  It is a park with beautiful gardens that straddles the US/Canadian border."
northdakota,2xn94n,chobette,3,Mon Mar 2 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"http://www.cityofmoorhead.com/departments/parks-and-recreation/hjemkomst-center there is a viking ship in this museum on the river across from fargo. I recommend not missing this. I lived there for a number of years before I got there, it was so awesome I was dissapointed in myself for not going earlier.  http://www.history.nd.gov/exhibits/ as previously mentioned is awesome. I liked it when I was only 10.  Also, since you are flying into minneapolis, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2124581/The-worlds-quietest-place-chamber-Orfield-Laboratories.html verified by guiness  world records as world's quietest room.  And dont forget museums in minneapolis. http://blogs.citypages.com/dressingroom/2013/05/top_10_museums_in_the_twin_cities.php  You might be disappointed in some of the other museums from what I remember, but that just saves time in going thru them faster. Also, if you like burgers, my opinion is smashburger in fargo or jd's BBQ in dickinson, they have something like 50 burgers on their menu with all kinds of toppings. My cousin recommends the mac and cheese burger."

northdakota,2xn94n,negativ_nein,3,Tue Mar 3 01:31:16 2015 UTC,Don't limit your time out west to 1-2 days. There's too much to see. The majority of the tourism in this state is west of Bismarck.
northdakota,2xn94n,AzraelBrown,3,Tue Mar 3 12:48:22 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good list to be honest. The enchanted highway might not blow your mind but it is what it is. Williston is a boom town, interesting place for someone who's never seen it, but you're from Singapore so traffic and congestion probably won't shock you. Fort Buford and Fort Union are good sites. The Garrison Dam is impressive, the coal mines are also awesome. Medora and the National Park there are absolutely fantastic. So much to see and do and the scenery is amazing. The geographical center and Rugby are very uneventful but it's right on your way from Minot to Grand Forks.  Lots of good advice from everyone in this post so far. As far as your additional questions:    It's not as exciting as you have been led to believe. I wouldn't go out of my way to make it happen.  There's no reason to do this unless you want to spend the night at a cheap casino. Reservations are typically just poor areas that have higher crime rate and higher unemployment. They still have all the modern amenities.  I can't help you with that, but there have been some good suggestions regarding that already.  North Dakota is a very safe place. Obviously western North Dakota and the reservations have the bad reputation, but it's nothing I'd be concerned with to be honest. I've lived in western North Dakota my whole life and yes, there is more crime, but I'm not personally scared of being harmed.   You have ten days, and North Dakota is a bigger state than a lot of people realize. Personally, I'd spend one or two days in Fargo, then a couple days/nights in Bismarck, then a couple days/nights in Medora, then a night in Williston, a night in Minot, a night in Grand Forks, then back to Fargo."
northdakota,2xn94n,knoxjimbo,3,Mon Mar 2 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm from Fargo, I'd recommend walking downtown. It's one of the more happening places in town. There's quite a few places down there you can grab a bite to eat, rhombus guys (pizza), toasted frog (only open after 4pm), scratch deli (sandwiches, soups, etc). You can visit the visitors center off of the highway (94), I don't know the hours. Personally I recommend Blarney Stone. It's 21 and older, but the food is really good and the staff has always been friendly. If you want something more upscale, there's always Maxwells, Mezzaluna, or Hodos. I would check the bonanzaville (haven't been since I was a little kid) schedule and see if they're up and running in the end of May. I find most things don't get going until June around here.  As someone else suggested I would check out The Depot in Jamestown. It's been around a long time and it's a local staple, especially for knoephla soup. (creamy soup with dumplings, pretty local to the upper midwest) Keep in mind the frontier fort doesn't really get going until after memorial day (May 25) and really is worth going to when the events get going."
northdakota,2xn94n,AzraelBrown,3,Mon Mar 2 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"Oh to add, they are having a wild-west shootout the weekend before Memorial Day on the 23rd, from 3-4pm at the Frontier Fort."
northdakota,2xn94n,LifeIsKarma,3,Tue Mar 3 04:30:57 2015 UTC,Go eat at Ebeneezers when you're in Minot
northdakota,2xn94n,wickster37,3,Tue Mar 3 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"Across the river from Fargo is Moorhead. Depending on your interests, you could check out the Hjemkomst Center or the Rourke Art Museum. There's also Junkyard Brewery in Moorhead, but you're a non-drinker.  Live music in Fargo at The Aquarium, Dempsy's, sometimes Studio 222. Some of the other bars have music, but usually just crappy cover bands.  Orange Records is worth checking out if you're  a music fan.  Food in Fargo at Monte's, Mezzaluna, Toscana, Wurst, Romo's, Quality Bakery, Sandy's Donuts. Look on Yelp.  There's an airplane museum in Fargo too, but I haven't been there.  I wouldn't recommend the Olive Garden in GF, or any Olive Garden for that matter. +1 for Rhombus Guys. Or the Red Pepper.  Mekoshika Park is cool. Glendive is a dump.  Medora is a trap.  Devil's Lake and Minot are pretty desolate."
northdakota,2xn94n,Eatinglue,5,Tue Mar 3 04:41:33 2015 UTC,"When in Fargo, you must eat at Duane's Pizza.  It is required.  The end of May won't be cold -- everything will be turning green then.  Bring a light jacket, but we're not Alaska, you won't need a parka in May.  As others have mentioned: North Dakota is big, as large as (if not larger than) many sovereign nations.  It takes 6 to 8 hours just to drive across it the long way; 10 days is probably plenty of time, but if you lose an hour a day due to sightseeing, you're going to be a long way from FAR when it's time to catch your flight.  ALSO: North Dakota has what are called ""blue laws"" -- it is explicitly illegal for (some) businesses to be open before noon on Sundays.  Before the 1990s, it was all day Sunday, and many business aren't open on Sundays at all.  Be aware of this -- it could really negatively affect your trip if you plan on getting someplace at 10am on a Sunday morning and have to wait 2 hours.  I'd also throw in Fort Abercrombie, 40miles south of Fargo, if you're looking for Frontier stories.  It has been almost twenty years since I visited Fort Buford, but IIRC there wasn't a whole lot there but a cemetery.  Reservations: I'm not sure what you're expecting -- there aren't teepees and feather bonnets and stuff.  Reservations look like most small towns, only a bit poorer -- there are some native American cultural aspects to them, but they're not touristy or for gawkers to look at.   If you do go to a reservation, find the local historical society -- that's the best place to see what the reservation is all about.  Seconding Fort Lincoln -- they have a very nice museum.  Also go to the State Capitol when you're in Bismarck: the state historical society museum is nice, and if you like tall buildings the state capitol building is, um, tall.  Also: there are quite a few county historical societies; they're going to be small museums on local history, easy to get through quickly but probably more intimate than the larger museums.    Regarding being female:  be careful out in the oil patch region; crime is on the rise out there.   For the most part people will treat you with respect -- quiet, reserved, and giving people their own personal space is generally the norm here.  The KVLY tower is just a tower in the middle of a field, just so you know -- there's nothing else around it.  Trivia: the broadcast call letters used to be KTHI -- ""HI"" because the tower was so ""high"".  Just down the road is its shorter cousin, the KXJB tower, which is a measly 628 meters tall.  Lastly: you'll be visiting during Memorial Day weekend -- when you arrive, ask around for Memorial Day events; there may be parades and other stuff going on.  Find yourself a small town parade and soak in the ambience: that'll be probably the realest American thing you can experience on your trip.  Edited to add ""some business"" to blue laws.  I didn't say ""all""."

northdakota,2xn94n,RelocationIssue,5,Mon Mar 2 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"There are some business classes that are exempt, like restaurants, but a lot of businesses are still required to be closed.  For instance, I tried to return a U-Haul at 11:40am this past Sunday and found the place closed.   I did note that in that link it says tourism is an exempt industry, which I didn't know.

You owe it to yourself – especially coming from such a large city – the opportunity to step back and appreciate the rugged, barren beauty of this country.
