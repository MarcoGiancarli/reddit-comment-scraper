malcolminthemiddle,3dypkd,alex617,7,Mon Jul 20 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"It's also one of those shows that if you see on TV, you can just watch and not have to think about where they are. Even though the series is just a long story about this family's life, each episode is almost completely stand-alone"
malcolminthemiddle,3dypkd,mjforever33,11,Mon Jul 20 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I find that once a year or so, I will watch the whole series, but when I am done, sometimes I will just throw on a random episode.  My go to episode is Pearl Harbor. That is the one where Jessica convinces Malcom and Reese that the other is gay. They spend the whole episode trying to be accepting of the other. At the end, when they find out what she did, they were arguing about something and one of them says ""I liked us better when we were gay."" I will watch that episode just for that line."
malcolminthemiddle,3dypkd,boblablaugh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"The acting isn't all that great IMHO -- it's the writing, casting and the scene setup that makes this show.  There are exceptions: Hal and Lois are the obvious choices, but seriously some of the side characters like Ida, Craig and Spengler kind of make it for me.   The kids do their best to act out the parts they're given and they usually deliver but it often feels rather forced upon them.   The moments where they're acting together as a family really shine more than anything.   That scene at Hals' family reunion where the kids take the golf cart into the pool and the clown fight come to mind as epic IMHO (where they pull off what feel like true and seriously hilarious family moments).  Overall though the writing stands out as amazing though.  I'll be thinking of some of their dialog later and will crack up -- the delivery may not have me laughing but the concept of what's being said is often off the charts.  Replaying it in your mind you find stuff that I still think is unmatched elsewhere IMHO."

Here's a bit from it:  Grandma Ida: The Saint killed our enemies, then went to hell to ask Jesus to increase the severity of their punishment, and you reward him with vomit? Big Kathy: You might as well wipe yourself with the beard of the Most Holy Patriarch. Lois: Why is my tart vomit? Grandma Ida: Stop your temper tantrum! Gorga: Look here. The 15th layer... you put apricots. Is that correct? Grandma Ida: The Saint didn't slaughter the peacemakers on the 15th. He waited till the 16th when they trusted him. Lois: This thing has, like, 35 layers. Who's gonna know where the apricots are? Gorga: So if you steal and no one knows, that makes it okay? Grandma Ida: I taught her better than that, till my arm was going to fall off. Gorga: She has to start over. Lois: What? This is ridiculous. (gasps as all the ladies put their cigarettes out in the tart)"

He does, however, want to associate with other people, this rules out Schizoid Personality Disorder. This means we have to look at other disorders that often manifest in mild social impairment.      To supplement this, we can include our knowledge of his intelligence. Malcolm is very smart and interested in mostly the math and science fields. He often speaks about things that are very interesting to him but not to other people, sometimes he doesn't understand this distinction. This is when we begin to suspect Autism Spectrum Disorder.    Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders are characterized by two things: 1) Trouble with interpersonal communication and relationships, 2) Restricted interests (such as a preoccupation with watching a computer simulation of his family), behaviors, and activities. Does this sound like anyone we know?     An theory about Autism Spectrum Disorder is that individuals with the disorder are very good at systematizing (the drive to understand the rules of a system, such as mathematical formulas, etc.) but not very good at empathizing (The ability to understand how a person himself is feeling or how others are feeling). Getting a little more sure?     Autism Spectrum Disorder is rated by severity, based on the deficits in socialization and restrictive/repetitive behaviors. Anything higher than Level 1 in socialization requires a person to only be able to speak in simple sentences, since Malcolm can be very articulate, he cannot qualify for this. Level 1 in socialization, however, indicates that a person can initiate conversation and participate adequately, but attempts at forming relationships are often strange and unsuccessful (asking out a girl he doesn't know on the first day of high school, anybody?)    Above Level 1 in the domain of restricted/repetitive behaviors requires the individual's behaviors and difficulty coping with change to be often observed by a casual observer. Level 1 says that inflexibility in behavior has to cause significant interference with functioning in several areas of life. Personally, I can't think of too many examples of this because, while Malcolm has a slightly restricted interest in several areas, he is also fairly spontaneous.     I would say that Malcolm has a very mild case of Autism Spectrum Disorder (what might have been called Aspergers prior to 2013).  Now let's take a minute to discuss Antisocial Personality Disorder. This is what people outside the psychological community might call Psychopathy, but such a term is not found in the DSM-5. What this disorder is, is a pervasive and relatively inflexible disregard for the rights of other people. 3 out of 7 criteria have to be met to diagnose this in an individual, in basic terms these are: 1) Repeatedly engaging in arrestable actions, 2) Lying (including the use of fake names and conning others), 3) Impulsiveness with a failure to plan ahead, 4) Aggressiveness or irritability, often leading to physical fights, 5) Disregard for others' safety, 6) Irresponsibility, 7) Lack of remorse after hurting or wrong doing another. Who does that sound like? Before you say Francis or Reese, there is another criteria that should stop you in your tracks. For a person to be diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder they must be 18    At least in my opinion, both Francis and Reese settled down around the time of reaching the age of 18. Thus I wouldn't diagnose them with APD. Conduct disorder, however, is another matter.    Conduct Disorder is (kind of) a childhood version of Antisocial Personality Disorder. It is a repetitive pattern of violating the rights of others and not following age appropriate rules.     There are 15 criteria of this disorder, only 6 are needed for diagnosis. These are broken into general categories 1) Aggression to other people and/or animals (such as bullying and fighting), 2) Destruction of property, 3) Deceitfulness/Theft, and 4) Serious violation of rules.    2) Francis and Reese: at their worst (best?) met many of these criteria. Therefore, I would say that they both suffered from a Conduct Disorder.  3) Dewey: Does he fit the bill of Autism Spectrum Disorder? For a lot of the series, he doesn't have many friends (except for Egg, if they were friends, I'm not sure if they really were), but when he did interact with other people, he seemed to have very little difficulty. His life wasn't hampered by an inability to socialize, so I don't think this diagnosis fits. But what about Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?     This disorder is defined simply as inattention and/or hyperactivity that interferes with functioning. There are three subtypes of ADHD: Inattentive, Hyperactive, and Combined. Which of these a person is diagnosed with is dependent on which symptoms they experience. There are 9 criteria for Inattention and 9 for Hyperactivity. A person needs to meet 6 of these criteria in either of these to meet that particular subtype, or 6 in each to meet the Combined subtype.    The inattention criteria include: 1) Failure to pay close attention, 2) Difficulty sustaining attention, 3) Difficulty listening when spoken to, 4) Not following through on instructions, 5) Difficulty with the organization of tasks, 6) Avoiding tasks that require considerable mental effort, 7) Loosing things, 8) Being easily distracted, and 9) Often being forgetful. To me, Dewey doesn't seem to meet enough of these criteria to be considered clinically inattentive. But what about hyperactivity?    Hyperactivity criteria include: 1) Fidgeting and squirming, 2) Standing up and walking around when expected to stay seated, 3) Often runs or climbs when not appropriate, 4) Difficulty being quiet, 5) Often highly energized and ""on the go"", 6) Excessive talking, 7) Blurting out answers or finishing others' sentences, 8) Difficulty waiting their turn, 9) Interrupting or intruding on others. In my opinion, Dewey, especially early in the series, meets enough of these criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD Hyperactive Presentation.  4) Hal: I feel that a case could be made that Hal may suffer from Bipolar Disorder (due to his occasional manic states), but it's been about 5 months since I've last watched the series, so I couldn't attest to evidence of the other half of the disorder (depression), so I do not feel comfortable diagnosing Hal with BPD.    Hal seems to be a mixed bag of Personality Disorders depending on the season and context. He fits some criteria for Paranoid Personality Disorder, others for Borderline Personality Disorder, and sometimes a few for Histrionic Personality Disorder. But he does not meet enough criteria in any of those stated to be truly diagnosed. Thus he may be diagnosed with Other Specified Personality Disorder, which doesn't require to full criteria to be met.     However, a loose case can be made for Hal and Dependent Personality Disorder. This disorder is essentially a need to be taken care of, leading to clingy behavior and fear of separation. Among it's 8 criteria, 5 must be met for diagnosis. The criteria Hal may meet are 1) Difficulty making decisions without the advice and reassurance of others (When he has to decide whether to remove his neighbor from life support), 2) Has difficulty disagreeing with people (In the entire series you can probably count the number of times he has said the word ""No"" on two hands and a foot), 3) Going to excessive lengths for others, often volunteering for tasks that they find unpleasant (fixing the roof, anyone?), 4) Urgently seeks another relationship for support when another ends (Doesn't he do something like this when Lois leaves to stay at her sister's when she is pregnant?), 5) Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left alone (He plans to kill himself shortly after Lois inevitably dies before him).    I would very tentatively diagnose Hal with Dependent Personality Disorder.  5) Lois: Lois has a need to be in control, when she is not in control, problems begin to arise. People have suggested that she has either Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). I would have to agree with the latter.    The difference between these two disorders, very basically, is that OCD is essentially an anxiety disorder in which people have fairly specific fears (Germs, Contamination, etc.), and when their fear of these things becomes very great they engage in very specific compulsions (actions) to dissipate the fear. An example of this is the case of a musician named Chad who has to wipe bad luck off himself anytime he sees an El Camino.    Lois doesn't have these specific fears, nor does she have any go-to compulsions. But boy does she need things to be controlled by her. This is where OCPD comes in. As a personality disorder, it is her default method of dealing with the world. It is a preoccupation with order, perfection, and control.     There are 8 criteria for this disorder, 4 are needed for diagnosis. The criteria I believe Lois meets are: 1) Preoccupation with order, details, etc., 2) Exclusive devotion to work to the point that it interferes with other areas of life, 3) Highly conscientious and inflexible about morals and values, 4) Reluctance to delegate tasks to others unless she can be sure that the task will be done her way, and 5) Shows rigidity and stubbornness.    I would diagnose Lois with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder.  *Disclaimer: I am only a second year psychology student, take my suggestions with a grain of salt"

They believe that their morality is superior to everyone else's  Examples include: when Lois won't admit she was at fault for a car accident, despite overwhelming evidence.  Malcolm when he creates a ""sims"" family.  Francis when he goes into AA even though he doesn't drink.  Pretty much any time any one of them says, ""What is wrong with YOU PEOPLE!"""

Hal sees alternate versions of himself and sometimes argues to himself.  Francis obsesses over proving his mother wrong and has a total desire to go against her will for no reason.  Reese has a 'crazy voice' in his head that tells him to not do what he is actually good at (cooking, school, etc.).  Malcolm talks to himself in his asides.  Dewey also has the 'crazy voice' and is told to do things by a toy on tv, an unborn fetus, a dog, and many other things.  Jamie is too young to diagnose, but he does almost kill Lois in one episode."

If you mean that Lois ignored Claire talking about her medical problems, and Claire died as a result of failing to address her medical problems, then maybe, but I don't think it was deliberate on Lois's part. Lois was just ignoring Claire because Claire was being so irritating. Although I do love how, when Lois tells Hal that Claire died, she adds ""I guess no one really saw it coming."""
malcolminthemiddle,31kopx,TrueButNotProvable,2,Mon Apr 6 00:39:17 2015 UTC,Yes. That's what I'm implying.   And her medical problems were shingles and arthritis. Neither of those are really life threatening. Especially anything that's just that sudden.
malcolminthemiddle,31kopx,TrueButNotProvable,7,Mon Apr 6 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"On their own, maybe not, but she also makes other complaints:   She just moved into a house that has dry rot -- mold can cause health issues, and she says that it hasn't been taken care of (""I must have called the guy 50 times"") She later mentions that the grout in her bathroom is filthy, and living in unsanitary conditions isn't a good thing. Six feet of her colon have been surgically removed (""You know what I call it now? My semi-colon!"") She has trouble sleeping. On its own, this isn't necessarily life threatening, but it could be symptomatic of another untreated condition, and it could exacerbate an existing condition. She says she has a condition called ""leaky gut"" -- although to be fair, from my 15 seconds of research, I'm not totally sure that leaky gut is a real condition. Still, within the show, it would seem to indicate that there's something wrong with her. She experiences recurring ringing in her ears."

malcolminthemiddle,2z36w2,monkeyumbrella,16,Sun Mar 15 03:19:32 2015 UTC,"Story-wise, it was well done.  EVeryone in MITM has their defininig trait ramped up - there are very few ""normal"" people. Old Mrs Old is incredibly bigoted, Daphne's mother is incredibly neurotic, Abe is... Abe. Even when you see the neighbors (such as in S5E08 ""Block Party"") they are all criminals/adulterers/drug addicts and the neighborhood dissolves into chaos once they stop uniting in their hates of the Nolastnames.   Kitty was introduced as an incredibly repressed person (remember the meal with the family during ""Dinner Out""? Lois licks her finger, puts it in Kitty's ear, and Kitty is so keen to avoid confrontation she sits there smiling). Stevie, when he first appears, is incredibly sheltered; he can only really sit and read comics with Malcolm. Malcolm, over the years,  is a huge influence on Stevie, so Stevie gradually comes out of his bubble; willingly breaking rules and getting into situations that he would never have done when he was younger. Kitty hates her life at the beginning of the series, saying as much when she was teaching Malcolm in S1E01. She snapped in S02E04 (Dinner Out) and since then was clearly having marital differences with Abe (3x01, Houseboat and the passive-agressive Scrabble game). She acts out, and being Malcolm in the Middle she doesn't just buy a new car or has an affair. She runs off and does everything and anything with everyone and anyone.  I love Malcolm in the Middle because all the characters develop in such a clever way - each episode having some small impact on their lives as a whole.  As a TV show, MITM always had a cast that constantly changed from season to season, especially in the earlier years. Characters like Francis's college friends constantly changed as different actors came and went, and I think Merrin Dunge may have just wanted to try something else with her career. As /u/moloizer said, she worked on Kings and Queens..."

I agree that it's an abusive thing to do in real life, but I think in the show it's funny enough that I can handle it, and I believe that it's something Hal would do as a character.  If you had said ""... therefore, it is an objectively bad episode and nobody should enjoy it"" I would take issue with that, but if it just makes you cringe a little too much to watch it, I'm okay with that, and I get it. There are some episodes that I feel uncomfortable watching, but I freely admit that it has more to do with me than with the show itself."

Hal is funny as the well-meaning, yet often misguided buffoon.  This episode stands out as the only time he is actually being a deceitful, terrible person, and it's weird.  It's one thing if the point of the comedy is that someone is a terrible person, but I don't get that vibe from the episode."

Hal: ""Oh, they were all bent out of shape, so I sent them out to that guy who fixes them.""  Lois: ""The fork-straightener?""  Hal: ""It's the man's work, Lois. I don't think we should make fun.""  I love Mono, when Malcolm and Lois are riffing on the Pizzazzler commercial. The episode was partly about Malcolm starting to see Lois as a human being rather than a monstrous tyrant, and I think that having them exchange sarcastic comments was an entertaining way to do that.  Malcolm: ""See, that's what we need.""  Lois: ""Amen. We've been screwing around with medicine and bedrest when all we needed were some shiny beads.""  Announcer: ""Quick, easy, fun and so simple to use. Do you think we can Pizzazzle this thick wool peacoat?""  Malcolm: ""I don't think they can!""  Lois: ""Impossible!""  Announcer: ""Pizzazz yes!""  Malcolm: ""Wow. I didn't see that coming.""  I'm also a sucker for the conversations that occur in sitcoms where two people are talking about two different things, so they interpret the same conversation in two different ways. Another example from Mono, where Ellie is in love with Hal but wants to break up with him, and Hal has no clue:  Hal: ""Should be a great party tonight. Steve's doing kebabs!""  Ellie: ""Hal, I thought about it, and it's just... too soon.""  Hal: ""Well, he did say 7:30.""  Ellie: ""I mean, I'm not... ready. I hope you understand.""  Hal: ""If you're not ready, you're not ready.""  Ellie: ""You have such an amazing attitude, Hal. Don't ever lose that.""  Hal: ""So, I guess I should just go.""  Ellie: [Nods, whispers] ""Goodbye, Hal.""  Hal: [Also whispers] ""Goodbye, Ellie.""  ... Or to take another example, Malcolm and Reese's conversation about sandwiches in Pearl Harbour, when each of them thinks the other is gay, but it's too embarrassing to talk about it openly, so they use the subject of sandwiches as a kind of code:  Reese walks in as Malcolm makes a ham sandwich.  Malcolm: ""Hey.""  Reese: ""Hey.""  Malcolm: ""Do you want half?""  Reese: ""I'll fix my own."" [Gets a jar of peanut butter out of the cupboard]  Malcolm: ""Peanut butter's good too. Nothing wrong with having peanut butter.""  Reese: ""What?""  Malcolm: ""Just because I'm having ham, doesn't mean you have to have ham.

It would be stupid if I tried to force you to like something I liked.""  Malcolm: ""Right. Plus, it wouldn't work anyway. People can't help what they like, it's just the way they're born.""  Reese: ""I know. Like me. I've never liked... ham.""  Malcolm: ""Really? 'Cause, maybe if you tried it...""  Reese: ""NO! But that's me. I'm not putting it down or anything.""  Malcolm: ""I hear you. There's no 'right' sandwich. So, um, the ABBA thing...""  Reese: ""Should be great!""  Malcolm: ""Yeah, absolutely, just great. Hey. Have a good snack.""  Reese: ""You too."""

malcolminthemiddle,2vv2ov,TrueButNotProvable,14,Sat Feb 14 10:31:22 2015 UTC,"1. Life is Unfair. As mentioned, this is a retelling of Pilot and Krelboyne Picnic (in that order, obviously). And honestly, it's an okay retelling.  But as I mentioned earlier, the books have less risque humour than the TV show. Take these quotes from the book and see if you can remember the iconic moments from the pilot:   ""Okay."" I'll speed through this at 100 mph. ""The car's shadow is going the wrong way, the steering wheel's on the wrong side, there's no break pedal, the words in the mirror should be backward, the guy's watch wouldn't say twelve o'clock if he's looking at a sunset, and I HAVE RED PAINT ALL OVER MY BUTT!"" I screamed.  . . .  After the doorbell rang again, Mom realized that she would have to get it. We rolled out of the way as she stomped past. She flung open the door wearing a pair of pants...and -- oh no! -- a bra!  . . .   ""I'm here because I think there's a real opportunity to... could you, you know, maybe put a blouse on?""  ""It's just underwear, lady,"" Mom defended. ""You probably got a drawer full of it yourself. And I'm sure yours are a lot more frilly than mine.""   Although, it is gratifying when one dirty joke does occasionally get through, perhaps by mistake:   Dewey piped up. ""I don't take my legs for granted, Mom!""  ""I know, honey,"" Mom replied. ""You're a good boy. Now quit playing with yourself and get ready for school.""   Naturally, there are jokes that make more sense visually than in a book. You might remember this moment from the pilot, where Malcolm is sitting alone at a table and the other students leave a radius of space around him:   I'm now lower than low. The king of social outcasts.  Don't believe me? Get this -- every time I shifted my body, the ""Zone"" moved with me. Being ""gifted"" is like being radioactive.   2. Water Park. A retelling of Water Park and Traffic Jam. It was published in November 2000, around the same time that Traffic Jam first aired. My guess is that Traffic Jam was already in production, if not already finished, by the time this novel was written.  I don't think that this is as successful as Life is Unfair as a retelling of two episodes of the series. The parts involving the family are fine, but both Water Park and Traffic Jam have subplots that Malcolm isn't present for, so it's a bit awkward to shove them into this story.  For example, Malcolm talks about how Dewey learns to get along with the babysitter (played by Bea Arthur in the show) but exhausts her to the point where she needs to be taken away in an ambulance (apparently Hal and Lois were smart enough to teach Dewey how to dial 911). What's more awkward, however, is Dewey's adventure in Traffic Jam, where he follows a balloon, gets lost, and finds himself innocently and naively going from one place to another until he finally ends up back home again. The joke is partly ruined by the fact that Malcolm is the one narrating it: part of the fun of the story is the fact that Dewey is the only one who knows about his adventure, and since he's a little kid, nobody will believe him when he tells them about it.  Francis's billiards story is fine (you already know how it goes if you've seen the episode). The story about him eating 100 marshmallow ""quacks"", however, goes by really quickly -- I guess some stories just aren't meant for the literary medium. Basically, one of the chapters ends with Francis putting a quack in his mouth and saying ""One"", then we go back to Malcolm and the rest of the family. Later on, suddenly, Francis has finished eating all the quacks, and we read about how the other cadets are debating the next big thing.  This means they skipped one of my favourite jokes in the episode, where Francis is eating the quacks and the other cadets are counting along. We see the cadets counting while Francis is off-screen:  Cadets: ""Sixty-one! Sixty-two! Sixty-three!"" [Pause] [Disgusted] ""Sixty-two... Sixty-one..."" [Excited again] ""Sixty-two!""  There are a couple annoying instances of censorship. Instead of sneaking a bottle of rum into the water park, Hal sneaks in chocolate bars for Lois and himself:   Dad held out a paper bag of candy bars and wagged it in front of my mom's eyes. ""We're not paying those concession stand prices.""  ""Oh, Hal,"" Mom gushed. ""You're so cute when you sneak in junk food.""   3. The Bad Luck Charm. This is the first book not to be based on a specific TV episode. I'm not in love with this story, but I'll give you a summary.  Dewey tells Lois that Malcolm and Reese slung him from a tree using her good pantyhose. Malcolm and Reese are mad, and they want to get revenge on Dewey for squealing. Later that day, the family stops by a yard sale (in the book they call it a ""tag sale"" -- I've never heard that word before. I'm guessing it's a regional term, like ""pop"" versus ""soda""?) and Malcolm and Reese see a stuffed monkey in a vest. The guy selling it calls the monkey ""Banana Joe"" and tells them an ominous legend of how everyone who owned the stuffed monkey and failed to show it respect had bad things happen to them. Malcolm and Reese buy Banana Joe for 68 cents so they can use it to scare Dewey into doing what they say.  Dewey takes it seriously, and starts worshipping Banana Joe. However, Malcolm and Reese start noticing that bad things are happening to them, as though they've suddenly gotten bad luck. In addition, it seems like Banana Joe has a will of his own -- he seems to move around at night, and when Malcolm and Reese try to throw Banana Joe in the garbage outside, he shows up in their room again.  Meanwhile, the school is about to hold Survivor Day, a series of competitive athletic games. Lois makes sure that Malcolm, Reese and Stevie are signed up on the same team -- she says that Malcolm and Reese have to learn to work together.  Malcolm tells Stevie about Banana Joe. Stevie is dismissive at first, but does some research on spirits and rituals. Dewey distracts Hal and Lois at night so that Malcolm, Reese and Stevie can sneak into a cemetary (using a shortcut Francis tells Malcolm about) and perform a ritual before they bury Banana Joe in the ground. They bury him in a backpack identical to the backpack they intend to use to carry their supplied for Survivor Day.  Survivor Day arrives. Since Dewey helped get rid of Banana Joe, Malcolm and Reese let him on their team, begrudgingly.  The Survivor Day events include a race through a forest, and a canoe race. I don't remember the school having access to a forest or a river, but let's ignore that for the time being.  Malcolm, Dewey and Reese get in the canoe for the race. Everything's going fine, until they open their backpack and see Banana Joe (obviously they buried the wrong backpack). All looks like it's lost, until they learn to work together, blah blah, they get second place.  The moral is some confused combination of ""it's important to work together"" and ""superstitious beliefs are silly, you just have to believe in yourself"". In the end, of course, it turns out that all the supernatural events had a logical explanation. The reason Banana Joe was moving around at night was because Malcolm, Dewey and Reese were constantly shifting him around so he wasn't facing each of them. And the reason he came back from the garbage can was because Lois took him back into the house, because she noticed Dewey playing with it earlier and thought Malcolm and Reese were just getting rid of it because Dewey liked it.  So, there's an intersection of two plots (the Banana Joe plot and the Survivor Day plot) neither of which I find particularly compelling. The Banana Joe story is a fairly standard plot about otherwise rational people being overcome with superstition. And the Survivor Day plot seems like it was forced in as a marketing thing, e.g. ""We want boys age 8-11 to buy this book. Boys age 8-11 like reading about athletic competitions. Therefore, this book needs to have an athletic competition as its climax."""
malcolminthemiddle,2vv2ov,HunterSTolkien,10,Sat Feb 14 10:33:08 2015 UTC,"4. The Exchange Student. I really like this one.  Malcolm brings home a form from school asking parents if they'd be interested in taking care of an exchange student for a week. Much to Malcolm's chagrin, Lois signs the family up, and they host a girl from Oakdale (not sure which Oakdale, possibly California?) named Camellia for a week. She takes the boys' room, while the boys have to share the couch.  Camellia is just a little too perfect, and Malcolm is jealous of the attention she's getting. She has an IQ of 166 (Malcolm's is 165), she knows how to keep Dewey from squealing on her, and Hal and Lois love her. Malcolm sees her as driving a wedge into the gears of the family, which is a problem for him, because he relies on his ability to predict what everyone in the house is going to do at all times:   Let me show you something. I'm going to take a waffle and put it on the empty plate in the middle of the table. First Reese will call it. Then Dewey will claim he's contaminated it somehow. Mom will yell at them and Dad will get the waffle. Watch.  ""It's mine!"" says Reese.  ""I already spit on it!"" says Dewey.  ""Will you two stop arguing?!"" yells Mom.  And Dad's already eating the waffle without even noticing them.  Isn't that cool? It's like I made all that happen. I'm controlling them and no one knows it.   To make matters worse, in the attic (apparently they have an attic?) Malcolm finds old baby clothes with the name ""Camellia"" on them -- it seems that every time Hal and Lois were about to have another child, their plan was to name the child Camellia if it was a girl.  Mother's Day is coming up, and the boys have to find something to give Lois. They find some jaguar-shaped earrings in a jewelry store, and decide they would make a really cool gift. This leads to another suggestive line that apparently got under the censors' radar:   ""And jaguars are perfect for your mother,"" said Dad. ""Grrrrrrrr.""  We all looked at him strangely.   Unfortunately, Dewey swallows the earrings just before the family (and Camellia) go out for Mother's Day dinner. So, Malcolm and Reese keep an eye on Dewey and follow him whenever he goes into the bathroom. I can't help but wonder if this is a plot that the writers were thinking about for a while, and didn't get around to it until S07E15, A.A. when Dewey claims to have swallowed a car key.  This leads to an amusing moment where Hal catches Malcolm, Reese and Dewey in the same bathroom stall at the restaurant where they're having dinner. Without missing a beat, he asks ""What did he swallow?"" He advises the boys to be patient and just come back to the dinner table to avoid arousing suspicion.  Of course Malcolm, Reese and Dewey get into an argument at the table and cause a scene in the restaurant. Desserts are thrown, and Mother's Day dinner is ruined.  The ending is surprisingly poignant: Malcolm, Reese and Dewey apologize to Camellia. In the end, Malcolm realizes that he and Camellia are more alike than they are different, and he can appreciate that without having to be jealous. And the boys learn that their parents love them and don't want to replace them.  One more bit of trivia: There was a thread in this subreddit a while ago asking where Francis would have slept before he went to Military School. In this book, Malcolm vaguely refers to Francis's ""part"" of the room:   There aren't many things that me and my brothers agree on? But one of them is Francis. He's the coolest and nobody goes in his part of the room, even when he isn't there.   I don't think this can be taken as canon, although it does conform with Krelboyne Picnic where we see Francis sleeping on a mattress in the boys' room.  5. Malcolm for President. Not my favourite. The plot is pretty much what you'd expect: the Krelboynes nominate Malcolm to run for class president. Stevie is his self-appointed campaign manager. Malcolm doesn't want to run, so he doesn't really take the campaign seriously. This offends Stevie, and prompts him to run against Malcolm.  Malcolm still doesn't want to be class president, but he also has too much of an ego to drop out of the race. He enlists Reese as his new campaign manager. Reese finds some embarassing photos of Stevie in a superhero costume, which puts Malcolm in a dilemma: does he humiliate his best friend by making these photos public, or risk losing the election?  Hopefully you can see my problem with this story already: Why would Malcolm even consider hurting his best friend to win an election he doesn't want to win? I mean, I get that it's supposed to be about him having too much pride to drop out of the election, but in this case, it just seems like the authors had Malcolm act stupidly because otherwise they'd have no plot. In case you're curious: in the end, Malcolm doesn't reveal the photos, and instead gives a half-hearted speech, and hopes that Stevie will win. Stevie does not win: some other, more popular kid in the school wins.  There is another subplot, where Francis comes home and has tickets to an rock concert. His plan was to find a date, but Lois says he has to bring one of his brothers. So, Malcolm and Reese have to compete for Francis's love. This should sound familiar: as I mentioned earlier, the authors of this book, Tom Mason and Dan Danko, also have writing credits for the episode Malcolm vs. Reese. This book was published in May 2001, and Malcolm vs. Reese first aired in April 2001.  As in the TV episode, the contest devolves from Malcolm and Reese competing for Francis's love into Malcolm and Reese each trying to get the other grounded before the concert. But do you remember earlier, when I said that the boys aren't as destructive in the books as they are in the show? Here are Francis's ground rules for the competition:   ""Let's go over the rules,"" Francis said. ""Nothing gets broken. That's rule number 1."" He turned to me. ""Stay away from dishes and windows and Dad's old disco albums.""  Francis turned to Reese. ""And you, Reese, have to stay away from Malcolm's arms and legs. Also, neither of you can burn anything or steal anything.""  Reese started to laugh as if he'd already won.  ""Say good-bye to Dewey,"" Reese whispered sinisterly to me.  ""And leave Dewey alone,"" Francis quickly added.  ""Awwww. You're taking the fun out of this already,"" Reese moaned and slumped.   As a certain former president might have said, I feel your pain, Reese."
malcolminthemiddle,2vv2ov,Erekai,11,Sat Feb 14 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"6. The Hostage Crisis. This was kind of a disappointing one. From the summary, I was expecting better. The tagline on the front cover says ""Crooks in Malcolm's house? Dude, what were they thinking?""  It's a Saturday morning. Malcolm wants to go see Predatory Aliens 6 at a matinee with the other Krelboynes. But his plans are ruined when a couple of dimwitted criminals on the run from the law, Don and Delores, break into the house and take the family hostage.  Hal and Lois escape first. This is my first problem with the story: Hal and Lois are separated from the others, which isn't really what I was hoping for. I was hoping that the family would be together for this ordeal, and we could get some interesting back-and-forth between the parents and the kids in this emergency situation. But no, Lois is outside the house and yells at the police to do something to save the boys.  Meanwhile, Francis is looking for an excuse to get out of a 10-mile hike the students of Marlin Academy have to go on. He sees his family's house in the news and jumps at the opportunity to tell Spangler that he has to be available for his family in his time of need. When Spangler finds out that Francis's family is in danger, he organizes Francis and his friends into (according to the back cover) an ""elite commando rescue team"". For the rest of the story, Francis and his friends experience a series of inconveniences, and they never do end up making it in time to save the family.  Meanwhile, inside the house, Dewey is annoying Don and Delores with his non-stop stream of childlike questions. Reese is trying to suck up to them so he can join them in their life of crime. And Malcolm just wants to get out of the house so he can see the movie.  Anticlimactically, it turns out Don and Delores don't even have weapons with them. They're basically harmless. In the end, Malcolm does what Dewey would later do in episode S04E18, Reese's Party -- he calls their mothers (actually, the bad guy in Reese's Party is named Donnie, so that's kind of neat).  7. Krelboyne Parrot. I like this one.  The Krelboyne class has a parrot named Hitchcock (an obvious reference to The Birds). They're trying to teach the parrot to recite Shakespeare. They take turns taking care of Hitchcock at home each weekend. Malcolm's turn comes earlier than he expected, which is unfortunate, because Hitchcock really hates Malcolm for some reason.  Meanwhile, Lois borrows a vacuum cleaner from the Lucky Aide to clean out the boys' room. She describes it as ""the strongest vacuum that's legal in this state."" She gets Malcolm to vacuum up the room, but he accidentally sets the vacuum cleaner to too high a setting, and with a shoomp! it sucks up the parrot. Reese finds out about this, and he and Malcolm find another, identical parrot to replace it. (Now that Reese has dirt on Malcolm, Malcolm has to do whatever Reese says for the rest of the story).  The rest of the story primarily focusses on Malcolm's feelings of guilt. However, there's a subplot about Malcolm, Reese, Dewey and Hal preparing for a mini-truck racing competition. I think this subplot mostly serves the same purpose as the Survivor Day subplot in The Bad Luck Charm -- boys age 8-11 like trucks and competitions, so we need to put a truck racing competition in this book. The subplot also, however, serves as motivation for Malcolm: if Lois finds out that Malcolm killed the class parrot, she might ground him and not let him be part of the competition.  In addition, Dewey is obsessed with a children's show called Mr. Wiffle's Playhouse. There's a song from the show that Dewey keeps singing, that goes like this:   ""Tell your mom or tell your dad  You made a mistake and you've been bad.  You'd better do what you've been taught  'Cause you're gonna get caught, you're gonna get caught.""   ... which, naturally, serves to exacerbate Malcolm's feelings of guilt. I wonder if, in-universe, Mr. Wiffle's Playhouse is also supposed to be the source of the infamous song ""Nice is Good, Mean is Bad"" from Red Dress.  Malcolm's guilt overcomes him, and eventually he tells Lois about it. Instead of punishing him, Lois has a heart-to-heart conversation with Malcolm, almost like in the episode Guilt, appropriately enough. She says that the reason he feels guilty is because he has a conscience, and it's ultimately up to him whether he wants to tell the rest of the class what he's done -- but if he doesn't admit to it, then he'll just keep feeling guilty.  So, Malcolm tells the class what he's done. He says he killed Hitchcock, so the new parrot is technically Hitchcock 2.  ""Make that Hitchcock 3"", says one of the other Krelboynes -- it turns out, the student who had Hitchcock the previous weekend also killed him and replaced him with another parrot. In fact, every single Krelboyne in the class who took Hitchcock home for the weekend ended up accidentally killing him and replacing him with another parrot. I thought that was a rather amusing twist.  Oh, and Malcolm, Reese, Dewey and Hal win the mini-truck race, in case you were wondering.  There's a running gag throughout the story: whenever Malcolm refers to the parrot being dead, he talks about it in a different way, in a reference to the Monty Python Dead Parrot sketch:   ""So you're saying the parrot you went home with... expired?"" my teacher asked.  How much more clear could I make it? ""Yes,"" I said. ""He's gone to meet his maker. He's a stiff. Pushing up the daisies. He's bought the farm.""  ""Shuffled off his mortal coil!"" cried Hitchcock 2.   Also, I like the very minor plot about Malcolm and Reese convincing Dewey to ""grow up"" with respect to his taste in television. At the beginning of the story, as I mentioned, Dewey's obsessed with Mr Wiffle's Playhouse. But near the end, while Dewey's watching his show, Malcolm changes the channel to a cartoon called Ninja Robots vs. Skeletrons and Dewey quickly becomes hooked.   Thanks to me and Reese, Dewey was back on track. That's what family's for.   CONCLUSION  So, those are my observations on the books. As I said, they're a snapshot of a time when MITM was in a state of uncertainty: it looked like it might have been FOX's next cash cow, but the characters were not fully developed and the show had not quite found its identity yet.  As far as pre-teen chapter books go, I've certainly read worse. If you're interested in the books for entertainment value, I'd personally rank them, from my favourite to least favourite, as follows:   The Exchange Student Krelboyne Parrot Life is Unfair Water Park The Bad Luck Charm The Hostage Crisis Malcolm for President   If you have any further questions about the books, I'd be happy to answer them -- but first, I'd like to get some sleep."

malcolminthemiddle,2v8dyj,TacoJuans,2,Mon Feb 9 02:02:29 2015 UTC,Aaaah too much nostalgia.
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,madetobend,10,Fri Feb 6 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"This is just too of my head but Malcolm: the episode where he turns his brain off and the episode where he joins the play. For his more psychotic aspect his first car is funny.  Reese: the brain off episode as well and Backwards Forwards. The water park episode was good too.  Dewie: the sewer episode was funny, but I think he is best in the episode where Lois ruins his chances in the competition.  Francis: really any episode"
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,Clestonlee,6,Fri Feb 6 19:52:27 2015 UTC,Stevie: What'd you get for problem 17?  Malcolm: I drew a tank!
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,127crazie,10,Sun Feb 8 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"These are in no particular order other than the order in which they occurred to me.  Dewey: Waterpark, especially Part 2, when he gets lost, goes on a crazy adventure, and ends up back home just in time for nobody to notice he was gone.  Francis: At the Grotto, when Otto's nephew plays piano music while Francis does stuff.  Hal: I love almost everything Hal does, but if I had to pick one episode, I'd go with Health Insurance. It has some of my favourite moments and lines in the series, and has Hal being Hal. Runners up include Burning Man and Buseys Run Away (with Hal's army of strong men).  Reese: Experiment, where Reese accidentally helps Reese and Stevie with their biology experiment. ""I'm gonna name it... Blellow!""  Lois: Probably Hot Tub. My favourite scene is when she walks into the house to see Hal reading a newspaper, Malcolm studying, Reese listening to music on some headphones while reading a magazine, and Dewey playing quietly, and suddenly shouts ""I'm sick of all the noise in this house!"" so she can send them away while she enjoys the hot tub.  Malcolm: I'm going to go with Dirty Magazine.  Ida: Ida's Boyfriend, by far.  Jamie: Dewey's Opera, where he falls in love with, and has his heart broken by, another baby he sees out the window, all set to opera music.    That covers the family. I can think of favourite episodes for some of the other characters as well.  Lionel Herkabe: It's hard to beat his first appearance, in Emancipation.  Craig Feldspar: Health Insurance. I think of Craig whenever I hear the song Mony Mony.  Otto: Dirty magazine, when Francis teaches him how to dance."
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,TrueButNotProvable,2,Fri Feb 6 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"Some other commenters have posted favourite episodes for combinations of characters, and I don't want to miss out on the fun, so:  Reese and Malcolm: Pearl Harbour, where Jessica tricks each of them into thinking the other is gay.  Reese and Dewey: Jessica Stays Over, where Reese sends himself to China.  Malcolm, Dewey and Reese: Mini-bike. I like when they team up.  Malcolm, Dewey, Reese and Francis: Home Alone 4.  Lois and Hal: Tie between Dewey's Opera and Hal's Christmas Gift. ""You couldn't have said twice as good as Disneyland?""  Whole Family: If Boys Were Girls."

malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,mvpetri,2,Mon Feb 9 01:43:17 2015 UTC,Agree completely with Herkabe's first appearance with the student ranking board.  That might even rank as my favorite episode of all-time.
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,Erekai,5,Mon Mar 2 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"Hal - Rollerskates or New Neighbors  Lois - I'm not sure, but she's definitely the most consistent character in the show  Francis - Boys At Ranch  Reese - Reese Drives  Malcolm - Malcolm's Girlfriend  Dewey - Water Park or Dewey's Dog  The whole family - Krelboyne Picnic, Lois' Birthday or Family Reunion"
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,macshordo,3,Sat Feb 7 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"Malcolm - The last one, when he goes to Harvard. I know it is cheesy, but after seeing every episode, the last one makes us proud of him!  Reese - The one where he think he is sending himself to China!  Francis - I like Francis a lot, but I really like the episode where he must do his History report at the military school (very very far from his home) due to the next day but he keeps procrastinating. At the same day Malcolm is giving a party bigger than what he expected. At some point he is worrying about the mess and in the background you can see Francis drinking and enjoying the party!  Malcolm and Reese - The Forwards and Backwards episode. Also the one Ida made them fight with each other to see who was the man of the family*  Francis, Reese and Malcolm - Boys at Ranch, one of my favorite of all time!  Dewey - For sure the one he from the first season where he is dancing Abba's Fernando song with his baby sitter, and after her heart attack he start his adventure!  Hal - Wow, so many are popping on my head right now. Such a wonderful character. The bee episode, or the one he is arrested because someone from work set him up... I love when he tries to disarm the bomb!  Louis - When the store is being robbed and Craig confess he loves her and she break his heart. I don't know, I always think that it will be more fair to do like this than to feed any hope.  Louis and Hal - The episode where Hal is upset with some driver that runs on the street, and they steal the car at the end.  The entire family - Krelboyne Picnic. I don't know, I just feel so happy watching this episode."
malcolminthemiddle,2uzx07,mvpetri,2,Mon Feb 9 02:01:53 2015 UTC,"Malcolm: when he thinks before speaking and gives himself an ulcer.  Reese: when he becomes a cheerleader or when he wastes time telling Malcolm and Stevie about how he got the enzymes to seperate, by listing through his day.  Dewey: when Hal says no to the piano and he steals stuff to make his own while simultaneously driving Hal crazy.  Francis: when he and Spangler play pool and are both trying to lose.  Hal: when Lois is out of town and he goes crazy and builds the killer robot.  Lois: when she goes to visit Francis at military school after he gets his appendix out.  Jamie: when he is a delinquent because Reese is feeding him sugary energy drinks."

malcolminthemiddle,2txw72,samlee405,2,Wed Jan 28 07:50:08 2015 UTC,If the goal was to aim for something that resembled chemistry why not go for the real deal. They could have just put propanol up their instead of whatever that monstrosity is.
malcolminthemiddle,2txw72,Mr_A,2,Wed Jan 28 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"Because they're not chemists. They're filmmakers making a comedy show, not a science special."
malcolminthemiddle,2txw72,samlee405,2,Wed Jan 28 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"No one denies that. The issue here is that we're looking for an explanation to an otherwise odd situation. If there isn't some intended joke by the drawing, why not just keep propanol as propanol?"

There probably is no explanation other than they just chucked up some sciencey shit and got on with their days. Was it not enough that I went through the cast and crew for that specific episode and tracked down its original air date for you? There's only so much I can find out about this writing in the background of an episode of a TV show from almost exactly ten years ago before you have to accept the fact that I'm operating on limited resources.  I don't know the answer to your question, but I have given you all the best explanations that I am capable of.  If you're still not happy with that, that's not my problem."

In one of these carbons you have a hydroxyl group (the OH in the image). But alcohols have OH groups that can only form one bond. Here in this image you have OH groups making a chain (OH-HO-HO). It is an impossible molecule and even if someone could make it, it would not be an alcohol at all."

They were initially made for non widescreens TV, so the actual scene is a square that crop out the borders.  I was re watching the show and I saw lots of cameras, and also people. There's two that I remember:  The first is from the Pilot: Stevie is trying to tell a joke. In the widescreen version you can see a head make movements in the same rhythm of Stevie's voice. Probably to help him with his character.  The second I will not remember the episode, because it is from that short clips at the beginning of every episode. Hal gets home and Louis is sitting on the couch. While he pass behind her and go to the kitchen he asks where the boys are and she replies they aren't at home and they're alone. As soon as she finish the sentence he comes naked behind her. In the widescreen version you can see him undress :P"

I just rewatched Graduation, and although I agree that it looks like the guy is saying ""Nolastname"", my guess is that that's what the director (or whoever) told him to say, since he had to say something.  Francis could easily be lying about his name at work -- he officially emancipated himself from the family in Season 3, so I wouldn't put it past him to start using another name (he went by ""Pete Zahut"" in the Marlin Academy yearbook.)  In any case, ""Nolastname"" only appears in the one episode, so I wouldn't take it too seriously -- it might have just been an inside joke among the cast and crew, since their last name is so rarely used."

Wilkerson is in the show, and the creators have confirmed it.   Wilkerson.  The writers original wanted to keep the family's surname a mystery but it was already revealed on the show. The last name of the family has been revealed only twice in the show, in Malcolm in the Middle: Pilot (#1.1), where Francis wears the name tag ""Wilkerson"" on his school uniform (it can be seen best in the scene where he is talking with his family on the phone). Also, though unaired, it appears in a joke from the original pilot script. In that script, Malcolm was walking to school when a neighborhood kid came running up shouting, ""Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm. I was talking to my parents last night - I was listening to them talk, and what's your last name?"" ""Wilkerson, why?"" Malcolm replied. ""Oh. Who are the Pariahs?"" said the other kid. The joke was eventually cut.  A special feature on the season 1 DVD stated also that their surname was Wilkerson.  A trailer on the UK channel Sky One in early 2006 advised viewers to spend time with The Simpsons and ""The Wilkersons,"" advertising Sunday night new episodes of both series. Another trailer was released to advertise the last episodes, of 24 and Malcolm in the Middle: it claimed ""Say Goodbye to the Wilkersons.""  In Malcolm in the Middle: Graduation (#7.22), when Malcolm is being introduced for his graduation speech, his last name is not heard due to feedback from the microphone. Just before Malcolm gives his graduation speech, Francis drops his employee ID on the ground and it clearly shows his name as ""Francis Nolastname"", a nod to the fact that the family surname has barely been mentioned."

malcolminthemiddle,2sfbyt,Red_sled,14,Wed Jan 14 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"not that this is the answer you're looking for, but I think this show doesn't get enough credit as one of the first American live action single cam shows where a character breaks the 4th wall. At the time it began airing, standard three-cam sitcoms with a laugh track were still the norm for comedies and over the period of time since then those have died out and the single cam is now the preferable format."

malcolminthemiddle,2sfbyt,violentlyshy,3,Wed Jan 14 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a middle child in a 3 brother family that adopted a 4th brother later.   So many things resonate with this show it's hard to find a place to start.  My older brother freely admits to being like Reese.   We were talking at Christmas about the show and how my little brother reminds us both of Dewey.  I think the unspoken character on the screen that is often the focus of most episodes is the general relationships that all families have -- MITM has a way of lampooning the zany way that things spiral out of control or blow up that you never expected.     I have to say that it stands alone in TV history as such an anomaly -- it cast its own mold -- nothing is like it IMHO.   Most comedies are so one-dimensional in comparison.   It's got a slapstick element that is rarely pulled off with such precision (think ""The Three Stooges"" with more of an intellectual element).   It's got all of the wild Hal/Lois dynamics and the way the brothers fit in there (or don't) make it all work -- this isn't the way most comedies work.   And yet, it's endearing and if there's anything positive it's a show about Family importance.    The intellectual humor of the show is another dimension -- it makes my geeky guy jeans chuckle so often when I watch it.     And I used to hear it being announced on the radio (new episode tonight) and I'd think ""What the hell is that?""  -- I didn't watch it until it was all over -- I happened to be staying at a hotel and caught a couple of episodes and was simply blown away.  I couldn't believe someone had a show that lampooned these kinds of things and wrapped it up so wonderfully."

We were raised by a single mom and it wasn't horrible or anywhere near that, it was just lonely at times. I love Hal, he's the kind of father I wish I'd had. Loveable, goofy, totally human and imperfect. When I was younger I didn't like Lois much, I respected how she was always there for her kids but didn't really ""get"" her.  I totally understand Lois so much better with age. She was just the lone woman in the sea of testosterone, and she had hopes and dreams. She is trying to survive day to day and make her children into better people. She has respect for other people and is always looking out for the underdog. Lois is the kind of person I want to be. She kind of reminds me of my mom, stressed, underpaid and overworked, but loving and caring about her family. She just wants them to do better and be better people.   Now that I'm 27 going on 28, most of my friends have kids. I see now what it's like to have all boys, my bff from high school has 4 boys and one on the way (girl!!) and I see how it is in her house.

They, and both of the other books, are told from Malcolm's point of view. All references to pool in Francis's Water Park subplot have been changed to billiards, for some reason. Different monologues for Malcolm replace the ones from the episodes, though they do still partially exist through his narration. Most profanity is removed, though 'crappy' still remains for the most part  I am surprised by how little was changed considering these books were targeted towards kids/preteens  If there are any scenes you guys want to read the book's version of, let me know  The other two are completely original stories, and I'll fill you guys in on them once I've had a chance to read them.

malcolminthemiddle,2px3p7,Tebeku,2,Sun Dec 21 10:27:13 2014 UTC,"I like to think that they are the exact same story through different lenses.  Hal/Walter leads a very traumatic life for his family, while having insecurities about his children. In order to not blame himself for his family's shortcomings, he projects his insecurities onto Walter Jr, in such a way that these shortcomings were inevitable rather than being the result of bad parenting. He even applies Stevie's handicap upon ""Walter Jr"" (his first three children) to help make his families hardships out of his control rather than being his fault.   ""Flynn"" reflects Francis and Reese, who Hal doesn't think are good enough. ""Walter Jr"" is the reflection of Malcolm, who might redeem him. Missing from this narrative is Dewey, not because he isn't in the Breaking Bad universe, but merely because Hal/Walter is so determined to salvage his family through Malcolm, that he only acknowledges Walter Jr, rather than Flynn, and leaves Dewey out completely.   All of Walter's wrongdoings are justified through his care for, and protection of, Lois/Skylar and Malcolm/Walter Jr. But, this is harmful to everyone in the story other than them (and even them, to a lesser degree.)   Breaking Bad is the story of Hal/Walter's demise, through a lens that he attempts to use to justify his own failures.   Dewey, with a proclivity for an imaginative memory, and a loose understanding of reality, copes with Hal/Walter's failures as a father by altering reality into a more comical rendition. The central conflict in Dewey's life growing up is that his existence is over shadowed by the family's problems.  Dewey, in the MitM narrative, feels ignored often. Hal/Walter doesn't even acknowledge him in the Breaking Bad narrative.  If memory serves me, most if not all of the ""serious scenes"" between Hal and Lois in Malcolm in the Middle seem to be viewed through Dewey's point of view. These are the exact same scenes as Walter and Skylar discussing Walter's meth-dealing situations in Breaking Bad. The reason their discussions often revolve around Hal not making enough money at his pencil-pushing job that he never seems to go to is that Dewey is skewing reality as a coping mechanism.   When Hal/Walter is clearly associated with meth production, Dewey projects the blame onto those guys who set up shop in their garage that one time, who are Pinkman, Badger, Skinny P, etc.   Dewey catches on to the fact that Hal/Walter is leading a secret life and is flush with cash, but imagines it as being much more tame and simple, as seen in the scene with the ""Brother Bot"" and the ""perfect pants.""  Dewey is often at the scenes of Breaking Bad's violent situations such as gunfights in the desert, but is not noticed by Hal/Walter in the Breaking Bad narrative. He copes with the trauma by imagining that they are at a music festival and Hal accidentally blew up the RV cooking meat (when he hears ""meth,"" he alters the reality to ""meat"" in his head.) When they are having gunfights in the desert outside of the RV, he imagines they are on a military testing site and the whole thing is an accident.   The parallels go on and on.   TL;DR - In my headcanon, Breaking Bad and Malcolm in the Middle are the same story told through two very different lenses. The factual differences are the result of delusions and reality-skewing coping mechanism that reflect the central themes in the lives of Hal/Walter and Dewey."

Spangler finds out from the local police that Francis has been out at local bars hustling, and is upset that he has been letting him win. He insists that Francis play his best game of pool against him, while his fellow cadets tell him he has to lose so Spangler doesn't get upset. Because if Francis wins, the cadets are going to torture him with hours of educational programing on PBS. They end up in a battle as to who can play a more spectacularly bad game of pool, pulling trick shots to scratch on the eight-ball.

malcolminthemiddle,2ds7jp,ssk360,1 point,Sun Aug 17 13:13:07 2014 UTC,I don't remember the episode number but you're wrong. This is the one where they are feuding with the neighbors but Hal forgot to mail the insurance cheque so he locks the boys inside and ends up breaking his leg.

malcolminthemiddle,2d1l4z,hrbw,3,Sat Aug 9 03:54:40 2014 UTC,Either Francis-Malcolm or Malcolm-Reese.   Francis-Malcolm because Francis is the Wilson / Mr. Feeney of the series to Malcolm.   Malcolm-Reese because it's the classic straight man/funny guy act.
malcolminthemiddle,2d1l4z,jxl180,3,Sat Aug 9 16:54:05 2014 UTC,"I submit Reese-Dewey as a better example of the classic straight man/funny guy act. Malcolm and Reese are intellectually miles apart, but they have a lot of the same priorities, and a lot of the same flaws which are used for comedy (in particular, Malcolm is very quick to anger, and he overthinks things a lot). If Reese and Malcolm fit into an archetype, I think they'd fall under the category of Id (Reese) and Superego (Malcolm).  When Reese and Dewey get together, it usually lends itself more to the classic straight man/funny guy act you talk about. I am thinking, in particular, about when Dewey tricks Reese into thinking he's in a box headed to China, or when Dewey tries to teach Reese how to use Jamie as a slave. However, there are also times when we see how much Dewey and Reese have in common: in many ways, Reese still has the mind of a child, and Dewey, bright as he is, still has a child's priorities. We see them collaborate in episodes like ""Vegas"" with Dewey's pet rabbit, and ""Hal Grieves"" where they take advantage of Hal attempting to buy their love."
malcolminthemiddle,2d1l4z,TrueButNotProvable,3,Sun Aug 10 14:17:44 2014 UTC,"For entertainment value, I really like Reese and Malcolm.  Reese and Malcolm are very different from each other, but they also have a lot in common (as you said, they're close to each other in age). They're at the same stage in their lives, so they have a lot of the same priorities and the same problems. Neither of them has very good people skills, and they both struggle for popularity among their peers in school. This leads to a lot of interesting collaborations (e.g. ""Stupid Girl"", ""Chad's Sleepover"") as well as a lot of interesting rivalries (e.g. ""Malcolm vs. Reese"", ""Forwards Backwards"")."
malcolminthemiddle,2d1l4z,TrueButNotProvable,1 point,Sun Aug 10 14:06:52 2014 UTC,"Very cool question. If by best you mean most entertaining I'd have to say Reese and Malcolm. Whether it's teaming up (in the episode with the Swedish girls) or battling each other (Forwards/Backwards), it's always hilarious and you know it's an exciting episode. However, by the most interesting dynamic, I'd have to say Francis and Dewey simply for being the two most unlike characters. Like you said Francis is similar to Reese is similar to Malcolm... and then there's Dewey. However since the younger three live together, you never really consider the Francis/Dewey dynamic. This makes it all the cooler when they do have parallels.   What about adding in the parents? All in all there are 15 combinations now. We should make a chart! I think that'd be cool to see all of the different interactions."
malcolminthemiddle,2d1l4z,CapitanPeluche,1 point,Mon Aug 11 07:49:41 2014 UTC,"My favourite brothers combo is when Reese and Malcolm would team up pull the older brother pranks on Dewey, just the small quips are awesome."
malcolminthemiddle,2d1gv6,hrbw,7,Sat Aug 9 02:57:55 2014 UTC,"Well, I think the show being mostly all about Malcolm kind of answers that question, but it's wonderful to see that both Dewey and Reese are exceptionally gifted in certain things, no matter how shadowed they get by Malcolm's intellect.  Plus, it's not like Malcolm ever asked to be the family's chosen child. In fact, he resents it and would much rather just live his own life like Francis has been able to do. Francis may have been the original problem child, but he was able to live life on his own terms, even in the confines of home and military academy. I think that's what Malcolm wants, but he's too much of a pushover to fight back against his parents."
malcolminthemiddle,2d1gv6,Tru-Queer,7,Sat Aug 9 03:04:45 2014 UTC,"Those are very good points. I never considered that about Francis. All the brothers (first 4 I mean) are extremely unique, deep characters and I love what the writers did with each of them. I still would have liked some focus on Reese going to culinary school and Dewey being on track for a music conservatorium or something like it.  Also though, I feel that Malcolm's idolization of Francis sort of stopped halfway through the series. In the pilot Malcolm described Francis as ""the only brother he liked"", but they never showed any real closeness past the first couple seasons. One way to divide the series is by Francis: military school, Alaska, Otto, and post-Otto. Malcolm and Francis were only really close in military school-era and a bit of Alaska-era. Otto and post-Otto it was all Francis-Dewey. Francis and Dewey ended up as one of the best relationships of the entire series and Malcolm was just an afterthought at that point. Malcolm may only be truly close to Reese when it comes down to it, and that's probably only because of their age proximity; they're closer in age than any of the other two brothers and therefore had parallel maturation stages and had to form a team to ""battle"" against Lois. What do you think of how it changed? Malcolm-Francis seemed to be the original plan for the series, but it shifted to Dewey-Francis and Malcolm-Reese. Reese-Dewey should also be noted as an intriguing and close relationship, but Malcolm isn't nearly as close to Francis as seemed to be originally planned.  edit: actually I've just made a thread about this. Feel free to post in there."

malcolminthemiddle,2d1gv6,franktopus,5,Sat Aug 9 07:43:52 2014 UTC,"Money. Malcolm barely gets into college, and its not like Reese was getting any scholarships. Plus when he moves into Craig's i think it shows him taking care of some of the cooking."
malcolminthemiddle,2d1gv6,Captain_Fantastik,1 point,Sun Aug 10 00:59:49 2014 UTC,"Always wondered the same thing.... It looked like it was heading that way then they just, kind of, dropped it... As tru-queer mentioned, I Also think it's because of Malcolm being the focus. Reeses talents weren't really discovered to toward the end, and by then they were trying to tie everything up. Perhaps it was a creative decision...  I like to imagine that he picked it up again later, but the creative focus needed to stay on Malcolm toward The end."
